# Byrd declares Bork 'doomed'

WASHINGTON â€” Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd, joining a growing list of
moderate and conservative Democrats, an
nounced yesterday that he would oppose the
Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork
and declared that Bork's bid for confirmation
is "doomed."
Byrd's announcement, along with a similar
one by Democrat Dennis DeConcini of
Arizona, brings to eight the number of
senators of the 14-member Senate Judiciary
Committee who have pledged to vote against
Bork. Barring last-minute maneuvering by
Bork's supporters when the committee meets
today, opponents of the nomination now ap
pear to have the margin to make Bork the
first Supreme Court nominee this century to
receive a negative recommendation from the
committee.
Two Republican senators who are not
members of the panel, Lowell Weicker Jr. of
Connecticut and John Chafee of Rhode Is
land, also announced yesterday they would
oppose Bork, becoming the third and fourth
Republicans to break ranks with President
Reagan on the issue.
Reagan, however, gave no indication that
he would withdraw the nomination. "Over
my dead body," he said, when told by a

reporter earlier in the day that the committee
likely would reject Bork's nomination.
"it's getting tougher, but we're still
working on it," White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said after hearing of Byrd's
announcement.
"We're kind of down to the only way to
deal with it is personal persuasion, one-on
one," he said. "The president is calling
people, and Bork is making visits on the
Hill."
Republican adviser Tom Korologos, who
has been leading the pro-Bork lobbying effort
in the Senate for the White House, said that
while "we keep losing votes every time I turn
around, . . . arithmetically, it's still possi
ble."
"Until someone looks me in the eye and
says, 'I'm voting against,' or, I'm voting
for,' 1 don't write it down. That's the vote
counters' first law," Korologos said.
But the day's four announcements of oppo
sition probably have sealed the nominee's
fate, most Bork opponents and many Bork
supporters agreed.
Campaigning for his party's presidential
nomination in Algona, lowa, Senate Republi
can Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said of the

nomination: "Right now, it's sort of hanging
by a thread."
Based on counts of prospective votes that
so far have proven accurate during the Bork
debate, at least 51 of the 1(H) senators now
either have announced opposition to Bork or
are considered likely to vote that way. Forty
two are either committed to support him or
likely to do so. Seven senators are considered
undecided.
DeConcini and California Sen. Alan
Cranston, the Democrats' assistant majority
leader and chief vote-counter, said yesterday
that they counted 53 votes against Bork.
Some Republican senators also are becom
ing restive about being pressed to vote for a
controversial nominee who might lose
anyway, increasing the pressure on the White
House to abandon the campaign, several
GOP staff aides said.
Byrd and DeConcini went out of their way
in their statements to emphasize that defeat
was inevitable and that a prolonged effort for
Bork would jeopardize Reagan's chances of
getting another nominee approved this year.
"Someone has to tell this president this
isn't going to go," DeConcini said.
