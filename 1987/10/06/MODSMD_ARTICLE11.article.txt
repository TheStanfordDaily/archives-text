# High Court rules on Deaver
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Su
preme Court, refusing to block
the perjury trial of former White
House aide Michael Deaver,
declined to decide yesterday
whether the independent counsel
law was unconstitutional.
The one-sentence order
removed the last obstacle before
the scheduled Oct. 19 trial.
However, the court order said
virtually nothing about how the
justices viewed Deaver's argu
ment that the 1978 Ethics in Gov
ernment Act violated the Consti
tution's separation of powers
doctrine.
Attorneys for Deaver, former
National Security Council aide
Lt. Col. Oliver North and other
former government officials have
contended in court papers that,
under the Constitution, the exec

utive branch has "exclusive au
thority" to prosecute federal
crimes. By contrast, under the
1978 law, independent counsels
are appointed by a three-judge
panel, part of the judicial branch.
Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111, as well as such
predecessors as Griffin Bell
during the Carter administration,
have also believed the law to be
unconstitutional. The law was
enacted in the wake of the
Watergate scandal to ensure in
dependent government investiga
tions.
The Supreme Court yesterday
joined a series of lower courts in
resisting efforts to decide the
constitutionality question before
an actual conviction.

In most cases, the Supreme
Court refuses to intervene until
the lower courts have completed
their work. Deaver, a longtime
confidant of President Reagan
and his wife, Nancy, has yet to
be tried.
Without comment, the justices
refused to hear Deaver's appeal.
Deaver resigned as deputy
White House chief of staff in
1985 to form a lucrative lobbying
firm. A year later, an indepen
dent counsel was appointed to in
vestigate charges that he had vio
lated federal conflict-of-interest
laws by lobbying his former
White House colleagues.
Deaver pleaded not guilty to
the conflict-of-interest charges
but was charged in March, 1987,
with five counts of lying to a

grand jury and to a House sub
committee investigating possible
ethics violations in his lobbying
on behalf of Canada and other
clients.
In urging the Supreme Court to
consider their pleas on the con
stitutional challenge before the
trial, Deaver's attorneys said it
would be "a monumental waste
of government resources, as well
as a severe and massive intrusion
in individual rights" to let the tri
als proceed.
"We think it fair to say that
there is no more openly debated
and publicly important question
of law today than the con
stitutionality of the independent
counsel," Deaver's lawyers told
the Court.
