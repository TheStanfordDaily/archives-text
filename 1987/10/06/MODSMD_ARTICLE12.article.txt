# Residents block Foothill development
## Youth hostel plans delayed 
### Mary Elizabeth McNitt 
A proposal to create in the
Stanford Foothills a youth hos
tel that supporters believe will
attract Stanford student use has
again been delayed because of
local residents' concerns about
the environmental impact of
the plan.
Santa Clara Superior Court
Judge Read Ambler has issued
a temporary restraining order
halting the transformation of an
aging building into the hostel
until a court considers the idea
Oct. 14.
Residents living near John
Marthens Lane, the proposed
access road for the hostel, con
tended that the road would be
unable to handle the increase in
traffic created by visitors to the
hostel.
The proposed hostel site is
an old building known to resi
dents of the area as "the
House."
" I he House" sits at the end
of Marthens Lane in the middle
of the Arastradero Preserve, a
599-acre publicly-held conser
vation property located be
tween Alpine Road and Page
Mill Road.
The Palo Alto City Council
approved plans for the hostel

several times, most recently on
Sept. 14, despite objections of
nearby residents. Hut the Sept.
28 restraining order stopped the
Golden Gate Council of Ameri
can Youth Hostels, Inc., from
making any improvements on
the house or lane until the up
coming hearing.
Resident Paul Reimer said he
and his neighbors have "no ob
jections to the hostel," but only
to the fact that "it represents a
hazardous condition.
Reimer, a civil engineer, said
the access road has no curbs or
sidewalks, making it especially
dangerous for bicyclists and
pedestrians.
The city should either
"improve the road to standards
that would be safe or build a
road through its own prop
erty," he said.
In presenting their case to
the court, Reimer, his wife
Kathryn and fellow residents
Robert and Betty Jo Davis,
John and Rosemary Young and
Gregory and Kimberly
McCarthy indicated concern
about the city's refusal to do an
environmental impact report.
They expressed fear that the
improvements could bring
about several problems, includ
ing water contamination, noise

Collution, fire, vandalism and
ealth risks to local residents
resulting from an inadequate
septic tank.
In their appeal to the court,
the residents claimed that not
only were the proposed im
provements inadequate for the
safety of visitors to the hostel,
but such improvements would
cause "irreparable and irrever
sible environmental damage."
The plan calls for making the
one-half mile road impen
etrable to water, which resi
dents claim would cause in
creased run-off and erosion.
Barbara Wein, executive di
rector of the Golden Gate
Council of AYH, countered the
complaints of the residents.
"The city council has consis
tently voted in favor of having a
hostel up there," she said.
"It's a matter of the public
good over the interests of a few
people."
Wein also said the property
is ideal for a hostel because of
its proximity to recreational
and hiking areas.
The proposed hostel would
accomodate scouts, church
groups and families, Wein said.
"We think that Stanford stu
dents would use it quite a bit."
