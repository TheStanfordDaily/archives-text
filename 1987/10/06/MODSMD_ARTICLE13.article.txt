# Prof. resumes lawsuit
## 
### Jason Bloomstein 
Stanford computer scientist
Clifford Johnson, whose lawsuit
against Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger was dis
missed last April, has filed an ap
peal with the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals in San Francisco.
Johnson has contended
throughout his three-and-a-half
year-old case that a launch-on
warning nuclear weapons sys
tem, which he believes the
United States possesses in order
to ensure retaliation in the event
of nuclear attack, is unconstitu
tional and presents a "clear and
present" threat to his life.
Citing the constitutional provi
sion that empowers only
Congress to declare war, John
son maintains that a launch-on
warning system has not been au
thorized by Congress and allows
a computer to fight a nuclear
war.
"It is unconscionable to dele

gate authority (over nuclear
weapons) to a computer,''
Johnson said. He said the system
is extremely prone to error in sig
naling a false attack and initiating
retaliation.

"If the courts fol
low the law, we'll
win."

In an article in the May, 1987
American Bar Association Jour
nal, a study by former Lockheed
Corp. missile designer Robert
Aldridge, Sen. Barry Goldwater
( R-Ariz.) and former Sen. Gary
Hart (D-Colo.) indicated that
more than 255 erroneous missile
alerts have occurred in the previ

ous 10 years.
Johnson's case was thrown out
of court last spring on the
grounds that it was a question for
politicians, not judges, to decide.
"The district court decision
was correct," said Asst. U.S.
District Attorney George Stoll,
who has studied the case.
"Johnson wanted a judicial deci
sion where one properly belongs
between the presid •• t and
Congress."
Others have lately come to
agree with Johnson. In February,
the Bay Area Lawyers Alliance
for Nuclear Arms Control in San
Francisco took an interest in the
case and helped Johnson file his
appeal Aug. 14.
Johnson is receiving the assis
tance for free. The lawyers com
mittee is using a $.*><)()<) grant from
the Plowshares Fund, an organi
zation that promotes arms con
trol.
"This is an extremely impor
tant issue and a good case," said
Thomas Robertson, a member of
the Bay Area Alliance who is
helping Johnson in his appeal.
"It is a remarkable thing Cliff
Johnson began fighting alone.
The lawyers alliance is pleased to
be involved in the appeal. If the
courts follow the law, we'll
win."
Johnson is not as optimistic.
"It's not likely that we will win,"
he said. "If the courts do decide
that the case is a judicial ques
tion, they will probably find an
other technicality."
Despite the bleak outlook,
Johnson sees advantages in
pursuing the case. "My case will
keep pressure on the military and
also educate the American
people," he said. Twice he has

forced Weinberger to recant
statements he has made about
the case by providing contradic
tory evidence.
Johnson said he initially
became interested in questions of
nuclear war after the United
States deployed cruise missiles
outside London, his home town.
He was educated in computers
and math and said he gained an
informal education in law after
suing Bank of America for tiring
him after he found computer inef
ficiency at that company.
The combination of his fields
of study, according to Johnson,
allows him to pursue the legal
matters involved in technical op
erations.
He is currently manager of
computer performance in the Ad
ministrative Center at Stanford.
His job, which he has held for six
years, involves maintaining an
efficient computer network at
Stanford. Before coming to Stan
ford, he was a professor at Sus
sex University in Hngland.

win."
— Thomas Robertson

In an article in the May, 1987
American Bar Association Jour
nal, a study by former Lockheed
Corp. missile designer Robert
Aldridge, Sen. Barry Goldwater
( R-Ariz.) and former Sen. Gary
Hart (D-Colo.) indicated that
more than 255 erroneous missile
alerts have occurred in the previ

ous 10 years.
Johnson's case was thrown out
of court last spring on the
grounds that it was a question for
politicians, not judges, to decide.
"The district court decision
was correct," said Asst. U.S.
District Attorney George Stoll,
who has studied the case.
"Johnson wanted a judicial deci
sion where one properly belongs
between the presid •• t and
Congress."
Others have lately come to
agree with Johnson. In February,
the Bay Area Lawyers Alliance
for Nuclear Arms Control in San
Francisco took an interest in the
case and helped Johnson file his
appeal Aug. 14.
Johnson is receiving the assis
tance for free. The lawyers com
mittee is using a $.*><)()<) grant from
the Plowshares Fund, an organi
zation that promotes arms con
trol.
"This is an extremely impor
tant issue and a good case," said
Thomas Robertson, a member of
the Bay Area Alliance who is
helping Johnson in his appeal.
"It is a remarkable thing Cliff
Johnson began fighting alone.
The lawyers alliance is pleased to
be involved in the appeal. If the
courts follow the law, we'll
win."
Johnson is not as optimistic.
"It's not likely that we will win,"
he said. "If the courts do decide
that the case is a judicial ques
tion, they will probably find an
other technicality."
Despite the bleak outlook,
Johnson sees advantages in
pursuing the case. "My case will
keep pressure on the military and
also educate the American
people," he said. Twice he has

forced Weinberger to recant
statements he has made about
the case by providing contradic
tory evidence.
Johnson said he initially
became interested in questions of
nuclear war after the United
States deployed cruise missiles
outside London, his home town.
He was educated in computers
and math and said he gained an
informal education in law after
suing Bank of America for tiring
him after he found computer inef
ficiency at that company.
The combination of his fields
of study, according to Johnson,
allows him to pursue the legal
matters involved in technical op
erations.
He is currently manager of
computer performance in the Ad
ministrative Center at Stanford.
His job, which he has held for six
years, involves maintaining an
efficient computer network at
Stanford. Before coming to Stan
ford, he was a professor at Sus
sex University in Hngland.
