# Stanford seeks NIH grant

-1 he University has asked the National Institute
ot Health (NIH) for more than half a million dollars
to fund a new interdisciplinary program in im
munology, one of the fastest-growing areas of med
ical research. University officials have said.
Stanford has asked for about $23, MX) annually
for each of six students who will enter the program
over the next five years, according to Patricia
Jones, associate professor of Biological Sciences.
I he money will he needed to provide stipends and
tuition for each student.
Although Jones remains "pretty confident"
about receiving the funding, she expressed concern

over the decline in government support for training
programs in recent years. The final decision on
funding will not he announced officially until Janu
ary.
Unanimously approved by the Faculty Senate
Thursday, the five-year doctoral program is sched
uled to begin in September, 1988, according to
Jones, who will head the program.
German Studies Prof. Russell Berman, who
chairs the Committee on Graduate Studies, said the
new program is necessary to "set up a formal
structure in which the students and faculty
specializing in immunology will be able to work to-
gether and interact more
profitably."
Although Stanford is thought
to have one of the strongest
groups of immunologists at any
university in the nation, Jones
said, the 22 Stanford faculty
members currently involved with
research on the immune system
are scattered throughout nine de
partments â€” in both the School
of Medicine and the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
The field of immunology, the
study of how the human body
protects itself against disease or
infection, has been steadily
growing since the mid-1970s be
cause of its applications in organ
transplants, genetic engineering
and AIDS prevention.
"It's a very exciting field that

keeps getting more and more
publicity," Jones said.
As scientists have begun to
recognize the importance of the
immune system in the study of
many diseases, "immunology
has emerged as an increasingly
important area in biomedical re
search. especially regarding the
treatment of diseases like AIDS
and cancer," Berman said.
Currently, immunology is an
extremely attractive field for
graduate students. In both
academia and the biotechnology
industry, job prospects in the
next few years appear to be aus
picious, Jones said.
However, despite the growing
popularity of the field and the
number of top immunologists on
campus, Stanford probably does
not "attract the top graduate stu
dent candidates because (the
University) lacks a formal im
munology Ph.D. program,"
Jones said in her proposal to the

Faculty Senate.
By instituting a nationwide
recruiting campaign, Jones said
she hopes that the program will
attract the top students inter
ested in specializing in immunol
ogy.
Berman predicted a successful
future for the immunology pro
gram. "There is evidence of all
sort of resources for its suc
cess," he said, "including its ef
fective leadership and faculty."
The Stanford program will be
similar to interdepartmental doc
toral programs in immunology at
other universities, including Har
vard, Johns Hopkins and the UC-
San Francisco.
The main focus of the program
will be to give doctoral candi
dates a solid foundation in im
munology, after which they may
specialize in a certain field of
study, such as cancer biology or
pathology.
