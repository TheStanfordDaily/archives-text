## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Vote against Bork 
### 
The U.S. Senate should vote to reject Su
preme Court nominee Robert Bork.
There are valid arguments for and against con
firmation of Bork. Certainly, he is an experi
enced, accomplished jurist whose keen intellect
and knowledge of law would add much to Court
deliberations.
But a host of voices have been raised against
confirmation of Bork, and they demand listen
ing. Many of the voices are those of civil rights
organizations like the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU). Opposition to Bork is inspired
primarily by what one national magazine
referred to as his "pugnacious conservatism."
If confirmed, the ACLU and other opponents
say, Bork would swing the Court to the other
side of many issues of fundamental personal
freedom, including equal protection, privacy and
the right of a woman to get an abortion.
But Bork's prospective stand on any one issue
is not the most troublesome aspect of his nomi
nation.
Much more troubling — and indeed, what has
really hindered his progress through the confir
mation process since his nomination early this
summer — is his general approach to the U.S.
Constitution.
Bork is a self-styled, strict constructionist and
outspoken advocate of judicial restraint. His
view of the Court is that it should be a
deliberative body only, deferring to the
legislature and executive in the shaping of and
making of laws.
His view, if put into action, would send the
Court in a radically different direction from the
socially activist role it has taken over the last
two decades, particularly in the late '60s and

early '70s.
Such a departure from social activism by the
Court could not be more ill-timed.
During the Reagan administration, the United
States has drifted away from the progressive
ideals that inspired laws protecting personal
rights and freedoms in the '60s and '70s. The Su
preme Court has begun to mirror that drift.
Americans are now lighting the last candles on
the 200 th birthday cake for the nation's Consitu
tion. The fact that the Constitution has survived
in almost its exact original form for two cen
turies is a testimony not only to the wisdom and
foresight of the men who framed the document,
but also to the flexibility of the governmental
system which it outlined. However, in many
ways, the Constitution is still a remnant of the
18th century: its framers could not have an
ticipated the broad range of social, biomedical
and personal issues to which it would be applied
in the next 200 years.
The Constitution, especially when applied to
modern social issues, cries out for broad inter
pretation.
In an era when the Justice Department is
doing little if anything to protect principles of
equal opportunity in the courts and the White
House is exercising more and more control over
Congress, it is imperative that the Supreme
Court take an active role in interpreting the Con
stitution and giving it a broad reading that will
ensure progress in protecting and advancing the
rights of individual Americans.
Given that Robert Bork does not support this
type of progressive role for the Supreme Court,
he would be an unacceptable justice for the
Court.
