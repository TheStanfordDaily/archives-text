Picking of student
reps, unfair
In the wake of last spring's stu
dent protests against the treat
ment of minorities at this univer
sity, President Kennedy estab
lished a Commission on Minority
Life at Stanford. The purpose of
this commission is to study insti
tutional racism at the University.
The commission is to include
four student representatives.
Student representatives on Uni
versity committees are usually
nominated by the Nominations
Commission. Nom Com ad
vertises the available positions,
and all interested students are
invited to apply. Candidates are
interviewed by Nom Com mem
bers, and Nom Com then
nominates students to fill the
positions. These nominations are
usually approved by the ASSU
Senate.
On Sept. 30 the Senate ap
proved a bill to change this nor
mal selection process for student
representation on the Commis

sion on Minority Life at Stan
ford. The bill allows the Black
Student Union (BSU), Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO), Asian American Student
Association (AASA) and
MECHA to each nominate one of
the members to the commission
instead of having Nom Com in
terview and nominate students.
This is not a fair method of
choosing student representa
tives. This selection process does
not allow other minority or inter
ested students to apply and be
considered for this committee.
While the problems the above
minority groups face are serious
and should be studied by the
commission, these are not the
only minority groups on campus.
This is an important commission,
and all interested students should
at least be allowed the chance to
be considered for one of the posi
tions.
The following are possible al
ternatives for allowing the above
four groups to each choose one
member to the commission. Let
Nom Com interview and nom
inate all four members to the

Commission with the BSU,
SAIO, AASA and MECHA each
recommending one of its mem
bers. This would allow people
who are not members of these
groups to interview for positions
on this committee. Another alter
native would be to increase the
number of students on the com
mittee to six. Four of the stu
dents would be chosen by the
ethnic minority groups, and the
other two could be nominated by
Nom Com. Both of these possi
bilities are much fairer than the
method currently proposed by
the Senate.
The Commission on Minority
Life will have a lot to study in the
coming months. Its recommen
dations will probably have some
effect on Stanford's treatment of
minority students. The President
has set up one, not several com
mittees to study institutionalized
racism. All students who feel that
they have something to contrib
ute should at least be given the
chance to apply for a spot on this
commission.
