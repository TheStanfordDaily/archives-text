# Stanford's own feudalism
## 
### 
In ancient times serfs worked their master's
land, rented housing from their masters, bought
food from their masters and followed their master's
laws. Today, as students, we take Stanford classes,
work at Stanford jobs, live in Stanford housing, eat
Stanford dining hall food and obey Stanford rules.
For these privileges we pay Stanford prices.

For both serfs and students, someone exercises
an enormous degree of control over their lives.
While it is true that serfs could not leave and we at
Stanford do have that option, leaving Stanford is
not simple. A prospective leaver must pay Stanford
what Stanford says it is owed, or his or her tran
script will be impounded. And, financial considera
tions aside, transferring to another school is not a
simple task, especially for graduate students.
In addition, the strong ties between University
divisions allow some groups, most notably housing
and food services, to survive despite their over
priced services.
This enormous control over so many facets of
one's life can cause many problems. It is easy for
problems in one area to spill over into others.
While academic problems rarely intrude on non
academic life, the converse is true.
Stanford bureaucfats are very quick to place
holds on registrations, often on the slightest of fi
nancial pretexts. It is much easier for a bureaucrat
to place a registration hold and wait for his victim
to complain than it is take the time to ascertain the
actual situation.
The victim of such a hold has few options; he
must either convince Stanford that it made a
mistake (no easy task, no matter what the situa
tion), or he must pay up. A hold on a transcript is
an incredibly powerful weapon to use against a stu
dent. Even the threat of a hold can be a strong psy
chological weapon in any disagreement.
Unfortunately, holds are often placed indis
criminately. This summer 1 had a hold placed on
my registration for a $17.50 cleaning bill from Es
condido Village. I was not consulted first. After I
talked with him, the head of the Escondido mainte
nance office agreed to waive the charge. However,
it took two months and many visits to the bursar's
office to get the hold removed. At least I was not
alone; there were at least two other students in the
same position. A situation like this is hard to imag
ine in the real world. Any other company that
treated customers so shabbily would quickly go out
of business.
This is not an isolated example. Every returning
dorm resident has heard about unwarranted bills
for damage to housing facilities. At Hammarskjold
House, where I was the University liaison for two

years, the bills for charges which were eventually
reversed was over $50() a year. This was a large
percentage of the total hillings of the house.
The charges included items that we were hilled
for twice, bills for damage caused by University
contractors, bills for inventory miscounts, and bills
for damages that were many years old. A large
percentage of these charges appeared on June bills,
when few students are around to complain. Outside
Stanford, if a landlord feels that you have damaged
something, at most he can keep your security
deposit and sue you for the rest. In court, the bur
den of proof is on him. Here Stanford has the threat
of a transcript hold to use as weapon.
Besides this weapon, Stanford's non-academic
units get another major benefit from their academic
relatives. Their close ties give them a quasi
monopoly on their services. Cost control or value
is just not an issue. For example, a double in Wil
bur or Stern Hall costs about $250 per month per
person for a room with no kitchen and a bathroom
down the hall. For $500 and a little luck two
roommates could rent a small studio apartment,
even in parts of Palo Alto.
Besides the basic rent, Stanford charges a lot for
other items, such as maintenance. Who else would
charge $174 to unclog a toilet?
Stanford can't get away with these charges be
cause living on campus has many inherent advan
tages, most notably convenience. The residential
education system is also a definite plus.
Food Service is a similar story. On a per meal
basis, food service costs about the same as an inex
pensive sit-down restaurant. How many people
would to to Food Service to eat if it was an off
campus restaurant?
While some of these problems arc inevitable in a
university environment, there is much that could
be done to alleviate others. A good first step would
be to greatly reduce the ties between Stanford's ac
ademic and non-academic divisions. The use of
registration holds to insure financial control should
become a weapon of last resort, preferably under
faculty control.
Ihe faculty gives grades, so it should decide
when those grades can be withheld. Some sort of a
formal hearing should be required, where both
sides can present their stories to an impartial judge.
Second, housing and food services need to be
drastically streamlined to reduce costs to a
reasonable level. One first step would be to
decouple housing and food services and introduce a
variety of semi-competing meal plans. If students
could live in one dorm and eat in another, they
would go where they were offered the best deal.
The best plans would prosper and grow, while the
worst would atrophy and die.
Finally, the bureaucracy has got to change. The
general contempt for students and the "Let's bill
the students to see if they complain" practices are
not conducive to improving the quality of student
services.
