## Racism and a responsible individual 
### 
In his recent speech to incom
ing freshmen, President Kennedy
admits "that institutions like
Stanford . . . are sometimes
guilty of forms of racism them
selves."' He encourages
"personal responsibility" by im
ploring the individual ... to ac
cept responsibility ... by en
countering incidents directly, by
speaking out and finally by using
what the University makes
available for their resolution."

The focus of this viewpoint is
the plight of Charlie Barnard.
Charlie is a senior science and
engineering technician who has
worked on digital circuitry at
Stanford Linear Accelerator
(SLAC). He is black, has spoken
out against and has resisted the
racism he has encountered there.
In 1983 Charlie and his union
steward met with SLAC manage
ment to protest its unfair treat
ment of Charlie. When the union
steward tried to raise the issue of
racial discrimination, Charlie's
supervisor ejected the steward
(who is also black) from the
meeting. After his steward was
ejected, Charlie told his supervi
sor not to raise his voice against
him and said, "I am not your
slave." The supervisor's re
sponse was, "Yes, you are my
slave," and the other managers
joined in his laughter.
Charlie, however, did not see
the humor. This was only one of
many discriminatory acts that
Charlie had been subjected to at
SLAC. He filed a grievance
charging SLAC management
with treating him disparately,
harrassing him and denying him
advancement opportunities.

The "means . . . available for
their resolution" for the Stanford
worker are defined in the union
contract. Unfortunately, the
"responsible individual" who
uses these means, who expresses
outrage at social injustice and
demands equal treatment in the
workplace, is often labeled dis
ruptive, insubordinate and unde
sirable. Unlike the student, the
worker who protests disparate
treatment may have to confront
continual harrassment and threat
of job loss.

Finally, Charlie's case went to
arbitration this summer. At the
arbitration, SLAC management
made contradictory statements
such as "The supervisor did not
refer to the grievant as his slave,
or if he did, it was understood by
all participants to be a joke."

The supervisor's response was, "Yes,
you are my slave," and the other
managers joined in his laughter.

The arbitrator was not im
pressed with SLAC management
and agreed that it had treated
Charlie "disparately" and had
violated the United Stanford
Workers contract. This decision
was a victory for union workers
who believe in fair and equal
treatment of all workers.
We are encouraged by this de
cision. However, shortly after it
was handed down, SLAC man
agement charged Charlie with

being insubordinate and disrup
tive and threatened him with
"further discipline, including dis
charge." This is retaliation.
The Stanford community
should join union workers in
voicing their intolerance of this
retaliation. Instead of being har

rassed further, Charlie should be
commended for having the
courage to speak out against and
challenge the discriminatory
treatment he and other workers
have gone through at SI.AC.
Charlie s courage benefits the
entire community.
