## Heeere's Bug Me He's digging ditches, crunching numbers for you 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
There are three questions
that I've been asked repeatedly
this week, so I thought I'd clear
them up before we get to the
important stuff:

Don't you just make up the
questions? No! All questions
answered in this column are
given to me by real people.
People just like you. Well,
maybe not with such a big
nose, but pretty much like you.
Bring or send your questions to
Bug Me, Storke Bldg., Stan
ford Daily, Stanford CA,
94305. Or send them to Bug-Me
(not B.Bug-Me) at the Trag
edies on LOTS.
Do / have to ask about Stan
ford stuff? No! You can ask
about anything you can dream
up. The stranger and harder the
better. ("The Stranger and
Harder the Better" is available
on videocassette for $21.95.

For sale to adults over 21 only.)
Are you really saving your
self for Susanna Hoffs of the
Bangles? No! I'd gladly accept
Gloria Estefan of Miami Sound
Machine as a compromise.
Dear Bug: As I was walking
on the embankment around Dry
Hole Lag near the Elliot Pro
gram Center, I noticed there
was a fence along the edge. At
first I thought it was real nice
of the administration to put up
a fence so that you don't fall off
into the ditch. Then I realized
that it was a barbed wire fence
that would impale anyone it
saved from falling. So why the
fence? The golf course is over
there, but it's got its own fence.
So what are they trying to keep
my out of? The ditch?
Don't Fence Me In.
What were you doing over
there anyway? Seeing as how
the lake is pretty inoperative
this time of the year, and that
the particular embankment you
mention leads off into the
middle of nowhere, I can only
guess that you were sneaking
around there for the purpose
of: Stealing golf balls from the
driving range! You cad.
You are correct, however,
that the barbed-wire fence is
really there, although it's too
beaten-up and broken-down to
keep anybody but a velcro
coated leprechaun out of the
ditch. As it turns out, the fence

is a remnant from the pre-
Governor's Corner days. Way
back when Stern Hall was
"that nifty, brand-new dorm."
Governor's Ave. (which is
now called Governor's Ave.
East, and is little more than a
bike path) extended past where
the Elliot Program Center now
stands, and continued on
across what is now the back of
the driving range.
Governor's Ave. was
nicknamed "Lover's Lane" in
those days, which should give
you some indication as to just
how quiet that — if you'll
excuse the phrase —neck of the
woods was. The fence is not
there to keep out lovers.
The ditch you mention is in
fact a drainage ditch, which,
when the season is right, con
tains copious amounts of
flowing water which eventually
reaches a drainage pipe. Back
in the good old days, kids from
the neighborhood used to sneak
into the ditch and attempt to
plug up the drainage pipe.
Voila! Lake Lagunita 11.
The Stanford grounds
workers erected the barbed
wire fence in order to keep the
kids out and the water flowing
freely; they just never took it
down once the construction of
Governor's Corner drove the
Young Dam Builders of Palo
Alto out of the area.

Dear Hug Me: After buying all
my nice new hooks at the
Bookstore today, I noticed that
each of them had a line on the
copyright page that reads just "0
9876543 2 IA Jew of them
even got tricky and had these
numbers in the reverse order.
Why are these numbers there,
and what do they mean?
A Stum/>ed Sophomore.
First of all, "stumped sopho
more" is a redundancy, and if
you studied the CONTENTS of
the textbook half as long as you
perused the copyright page, you
might not be so stumped any

more.
A publisher never prints too
many copies of a hook at once,
because (a) people might not buy
it, or (b) it might become a New
York Times Number One Be
stseller, in which case they
would want to print the book
with ;t new cover that says
"Orgasmieally Unbelievable
Nationwide Number One Bestsel
ler," with quotes on the back by
famous ex-Presidents who think
the book surpasses the Bible.
The consecutive descending or
ascending numbers tell how
many times they have printed a
new batch of that edition of the
book; the lowest being the print
ing of the book. Thus, if the num
bers in your textbook say "9876
5 4," you can proudly inform the
dweeb sitting next to you that

you have the fourth printing of
"Skeletal System of the Postal
Worker."
The reason they list the whole
series of numbers is that the
pages of a book are produced on
a photographic film, and rather
than create a whole new film with
a different printing number, they
need only cover up the last num
ber in the sequence to indicate a
new printing.
A new printing doesn't mean
the text of the book has been
changed; only a new edition
means the text has changed. To
you, the consumer, the only dif
ference a later printing makes is
that it means it cost more for the
materials to print the book —
hence, more bucks at the regis
ter.

Dear Hug Me: After buying all
my nice new hooks at the
Bookstore today, I noticed that
each of them had a line on the
copyright page that reads just "0
9876543 2 IA Jew of them
even got tricky and had these
numbers in the reverse order.
Why are these numbers there,
and what do they mean?
A Stum/>ed Sophomore.
First of all, "stumped sopho
more" is a redundancy, and if
you studied the CONTENTS of
the textbook half as long as you
perused the copyright page, you
might not be so stumped any

more.
A publisher never prints too
many copies of a hook at once,
because (a) people might not buy
it, or (b) it might become a New
York Times Number One Be
stseller, in which case they
would want to print the book
with ;t new cover that says
"Orgasmieally Unbelievable
Nationwide Number One Bestsel
ler," with quotes on the back by
famous ex-Presidents who think
the book surpasses the Bible.
The consecutive descending or
ascending numbers tell how
many times they have printed a
new batch of that edition of the
book; the lowest being the print
ing of the book. Thus, if the num
bers in your textbook say "9876
5 4," you can proudly inform the
dweeb sitting next to you that

you have the fourth printing of
"Skeletal System of the Postal
Worker."
The reason they list the whole
series of numbers is that the
pages of a book are produced on
a photographic film, and rather
than create a whole new film with
a different printing number, they
need only cover up the last num
ber in the sequence to indicate a
new printing.
A new printing doesn't mean
the text of the book has been
changed; only a new edition
means the text has changed. To
you, the consumer, the only dif
ference a later printing makes is
that it means it cost more for the
materials to print the book —
hence, more bucks at the regis
ter.
There are three questions
that I've been asked repeatedly
this week, so I thought I'd clear
them up before we get to the
important stuff:

Don't you just make up the
questions? No! All questions
answered in this column are
given to me by real people.
People just like you. Well,
maybe not with such a big
nose, but pretty much like you.
Bring or send your questions to
Bug Me, Storke Bldg., Stan
ford Daily, Stanford CA,
94305. Or send them to Bug-Me
(not B.Bug-Me) at the Trag
edies on LOTS.
Do / have to ask about Stan
ford stuff? No! You can ask
about anything you can dream
up. The stranger and harder the
better. ("The Stranger and
Harder the Better" is available
on videocassette for $21.95.

For sale to adults over 21 only.)
Are you really saving your
self for Susanna Hoffs of the
Bangles? No! I'd gladly accept
Gloria Estefan of Miami Sound
Machine as a compromise.
Dear Bug: As I was walking
on the embankment around Dry
Hole Lag near the Elliot Pro
gram Center, I noticed there
was a fence along the edge. At
first I thought it was real nice
of the administration to put up
a fence so that you don't fall off
into the ditch. Then I realized
that it was a barbed wire fence
that would impale anyone it
saved from falling. So why the
fence? The golf course is over
there, but it's got its own fence.
So what are they trying to keep
my out of? The ditch?
Don't Fence Me In.
What were you doing over
there anyway? Seeing as how
the lake is pretty inoperative
this time of the year, and that
the particular embankment you
mention leads off into the
middle of nowhere, I can only
guess that you were sneaking
around there for the purpose
of: Stealing golf balls from the
driving range! You cad.
You are correct, however,
that the barbed-wire fence is
really there, although it's too
beaten-up and broken-down to
keep anybody but a velcro
coated leprechaun out of the
ditch. As it turns out, the fence

is a remnant from the pre-
Governor's Corner days. Way
back when Stern Hall was
"that nifty, brand-new dorm."
Governor's Ave. (which is
now called Governor's Ave.
East, and is little more than a
bike path) extended past where
the Elliot Program Center now
stands, and continued on
across what is now the back of
the driving range.
Governor's Ave. was
nicknamed "Lover's Lane" in
those days, which should give
you some indication as to just
how quiet that — if you'll
excuse the phrase —neck of the
woods was. The fence is not
there to keep out lovers.
The ditch you mention is in
fact a drainage ditch, which,
when the season is right, con
tains copious amounts of
flowing water which eventually
reaches a drainage pipe. Back
in the good old days, kids from
the neighborhood used to sneak
into the ditch and attempt to
plug up the drainage pipe.
Voila! Lake Lagunita 11.
