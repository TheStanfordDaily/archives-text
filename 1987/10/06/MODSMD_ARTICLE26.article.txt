# Now there's more in Store
## 
### Carl Andersen 
After a short summer renova
tion, the Store is open once
again, and it is under new man
agement. Saga Corp., which also
operates Tresidder Food
Services, will manage the Store
for the next three years.
Over the summer, The Store
underwent extensive renova
tions. Older, freestanding
refrigeration units have disap
peared; the new ones are built
into the wall, increasing floor
space. Furthermore, The Store
has a new counter designed to
speed up long lines. Lastly, the
snelves have been shifted
around, creating far more space
than existed in the old Store.
A glance at the shelves reveals
further changes. The Store has
dropped some low-volume items:
The natural breads baked by The
Black Muslims, for instance, are
gone. However, a posted "gripe
sheet" invites customers to write
down items they miss — the staff
plans to bring back some of these
lost favorites.
The lists are overflowing, but
Store Manager Tracy Kerns, a
Saga employee, says some of the
items people miss are still in the
Store." People have to look
around," she said.
In addition. The Store has
added some popular features,
uch as a larger fruits and
vegetables section, a soda foun
tain and even motor oil.
Prices, says Kerns, are gener
ally lower than those at the old
Store, though some items have
sharply increased in price. Busi
ness is slightly behind last year's
pace, but Kerns blames this on
public confusion about when The

Store would reopen and on a
planned University power outage
in September. Both of these have
kept away some customers, she
said.
Kerns went on to say it is
"much too early" to evaluate
The Store's performance, as
Saga has only been operating it
for a month.
Behind the scenes. Kerns, her
two student managers, and the
many cashiers/stockers are en
thusiastic about the new arrange
ment. Several employees who
worked for both Stores com
mented on the increased

"professionalism" at The Store,
especially with regard to its
cleaner, more efficient appear
ance.
Currently, everyone, espe
cially the managers, works long
hours trying to restock and reor
ganize The Store. Although new
employees' wages have been cut
to $4.75 from the University min
imum wage of $5 % 85, those who
worked at the old Store did not
recieve a wage cut.
Student managers, however,
are paid more by Saga than they

had been under the old manage
ment.
Customer reactions to the new
Store are mixed. Many students
reacted favorably to the Store's
new setup, citing increased
space, better lighting and cleaner
facilities. "It's roomier, and the
lines go a little bit faster," said
junior Mia Jackson.
While several commented that
they missed items dropped from
the Store's shelves, others
praised new offerings, such as
the fruits and vegetables section
and the soda fountain.

However, some objected to
having unused space. "I don't
see why they need all that space.
It's better to have more things to
buy," one student commented.
Some patrons said they missed
the homey, comfortable feeling
of the old Store. "It was like fam
ily before; now it's like a depart
ment store," said junior Ziad
Sarkis.
The Tresidder Board of Direc
tors announced in June the
switchover from a Tresidder
managed Store to one operated
by Saga. The Union Board cited
"flattening sales" and a percep
tion of high prices as reasons for
the change in management.
Saga, which runs 16 other
campus stores across the

country, was chosen over other
bids after examining several
criteria, including student em
ployment opportunities, manage
ment expertise, and purchasing
power. It is hoped that Saga's
size will enable The Store to pay
wholesale, bulk prices and pass
its savings on to its customers.
Grant Kim, a cashier at The
Store, was "disappointed that
prices had not decreased" signif
icantly. Kerns said prices are
lower than the old Store, though
she said The Store still has an
"image problem" of high pricing.
Kerns and her student
managers also said they hope to
increase efficiency at The Store
by computerizing their inventory
and other measures.

down items they miss — the staff
plans to bring back some of these
lost favorites.
The lists are overflowing, but
Store Manager Tracy Kerns, a
Saga employee, says some of the
items people miss are still in the
Store." People have to look
around," she said.
In addition. The Store has
added some popular features,
uch as a larger fruits and
vegetables section, a soda foun
tain and even motor oil.
Prices, says Kerns, are gener
ally lower than those at the old
Store, though some items have
sharply increased in price. Busi
ness is slightly behind last year's
pace, but Kerns blames this on
public confusion about when The

Store would reopen and on a
planned University power outage
in September. Both of these have
kept away some customers, she
said.
Kerns went on to say it is
"much too early" to evaluate
The Store's performance, as
Saga has only been operating it
for a month.
Behind the scenes. Kerns, her
two student managers, and the
many cashiers/stockers are en
thusiastic about the new arrange
ment. Several employees who
worked for both Stores com
mented on the increased

"professionalism" at The Store,
especially with regard to its
cleaner, more efficient appear
ance.
Currently, everyone, espe
cially the managers, works long
hours trying to restock and reor
ganize The Store. Although new
employees' wages have been cut
to $4.75 from the University min
imum wage of $5 % 85, those who
worked at the old Store did not
recieve a wage cut.
Student managers, however,
are paid more by Saga than they

had been under the old manage
ment.
Customer reactions to the new
Store are mixed. Many students
reacted favorably to the Store's
new setup, citing increased
space, better lighting and cleaner
facilities. "It's roomier, and the
lines go a little bit faster," said
junior Mia Jackson.
While several commented that
they missed items dropped from
the Store's shelves, others
praised new offerings, such as
the fruits and vegetables section
and the soda fountain.

However, some objected to
having unused space. "I don't
see why they need all that space.
It's better to have more things to
buy," one student commented.
Some patrons said they missed
the homey, comfortable feeling
of the old Store. "It was like fam
ily before; now it's like a depart
ment store," said junior Ziad
Sarkis.
The Tresidder Board of Direc
tors announced in June the
switchover from a Tresidder
managed Store to one operated
by Saga. The Union Board cited
"flattening sales" and a percep
tion of high prices as reasons for
the change in management.
Saga, which runs 16 other
campus stores across the

country, was chosen over other
bids after examining several
criteria, including student em
ployment opportunities, manage
ment expertise, and purchasing
power. It is hoped that Saga's
size will enable The Store to pay
wholesale, bulk prices and pass
its savings on to its customers.
Grant Kim, a cashier at The
Store, was "disappointed that
prices had not decreased" signif
icantly. Kerns said prices are
lower than the old Store, though
she said The Store still has an
"image problem" of high pricing.
Kerns and her student
managers also said they hope to
increase efficiency at The Store
by computerizing their inventory
and other measures.
After a short summer renova
tion, the Store is open once
again, and it is under new man
agement. Saga Corp., which also
operates Tresidder Food
Services, will manage the Store
for the next three years.
Over the summer, The Store
underwent extensive renova
tions. Older, freestanding
refrigeration units have disap
peared; the new ones are built
into the wall, increasing floor
space. Furthermore, The Store
has a new counter designed to
speed up long lines. Lastly, the
snelves have been shifted
around, creating far more space
than existed in the old Store.
A glance at the shelves reveals
further changes. The Store has
dropped some low-volume items:
The natural breads baked by The
Black Muslims, for instance, are
gone. However, a posted "gripe
sheet" invites customers to write
down items they miss — the staff
plans to bring back some of these
lost favorites.
