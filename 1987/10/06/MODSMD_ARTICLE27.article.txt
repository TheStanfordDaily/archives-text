# Course teaches about disability
## Psych 185 examines the lives of handicapped persons 
### Shikha Ghosh 
The term "handicapped" is
one everybody recognizes, but
few really understand what it
means to be handicapped.
Psychology 185 is a course that
has long challenged students at
Stanford to take a comprehen
sive look at a number of hand
icaps and examine the life experi
ences of the individuals afflicted.
Students in the course also
closely examine those involved
in the lives of disabled persons.
Titled "Experience Based
Study on the Meaning of Being
Handicapped," the course
combines talks given by guest
speakers with weekly volunteer
work that enables students to dis
cover and question their reac
tions, opinions and biases regard
ing the handicapped. The class
exposes students to the realities
of working with and relating to
disabled persons.
Psych 185 is taught by Betty
Wright and Margaret Hauck,
both of whom work at the Com
munity Association for the

Retarded (CAR). Wright,
resource specialist for CAR and
founder of the Betty Wright
Swim Center, which teaches
swimming to disabled people,
has been involved in the course
for over 10 years.
"It's a shame that many stu
dents do not take advantage of
this," Wright said. Despite the
fact that it is offered all three
uuarters, few students enroll in
tne course. Fall quarter enroll
ment is especially low, because
many students are unfamiliar
with the course offerings, she
said.
Although the course is offered
through the Psychology Depart
ment, it is not limited to students
majoring in psychology. The only
prerequisite is a commitment to
working with people.
Senior Andy Merritt believes
so strongly in the course that he
is taking it a second time.
"Students who take the class
become very loyal to the pro
gram," Hauck said.
Senior Cammie Kahn is an
other student enrolled in the

course again. She believes that
the course is "the best of every
thing that volunteer work can
be."
Students can fulfill the course
requirement of three hours of
volunteer work per week by be
coming involved in one of several
programs at CAR. The most
well-known is the swim program,
in which volunteers teach
therapeutic swimming to dis
abled people.
Other programs include Crea
tive Recreation, in which volun
teers work with school-age
children, and Infant Stimulation,
which helps parents and small
children.
The class is offered on
Thursday evenings in Room 60-
61A from 7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.
Wright stressed that students are
welcome to join the class at any
time in the quarter.
"Student awareness is key,"
Wright said. Psych 185 seems to
be a course that not only teaches
awareness but gives students an
opportunity to practice it.
