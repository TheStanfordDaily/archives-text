## Satellites probe relativity 
### Eric Krock 
Stanford physicists and en
gineers are building a satellite to
test for the first time parts of
Einstein's General Theory of
Relativity. The results of the test
may call into question Einstein's
predictions and require that the
theory he amended.
The satellite, called Gravity
Probe B. will be tested aboard a
space shuttle in 1992 and pro
pelled into polar orbit in 1994.
For two years, the satellite will
monitor the angles of spin of four
gyroscopes inside it. Physicists
will compare these angles to
those predicted by Einstein's
general theory of relativity, ac
cording to Bradford Parkinson,
professor of aeronautics and
astronautics at Stanford.
Einstein's general theory of
relativity states that space and
time are linked in a fabric called
"space-time," and that this
fabric is bent by gravity, just as
cloth is bent by a heavy ball.
Einstein's general theory of
relativity has been much harder
to test than his special theory of
relativity. The special theory of
relativity predicts that clocks will
slow down near massive objects
or when moving close to the
speed of light. The special theory
has been well tested, according
to Parkinson.
The general theory predicts
certain observable effects, which
scientists then use to test its
validity. Among these effects are
the bending of starlight by
gravity, "geodetic precession"
and "frame-dragging," accord
ing to a brochure prepared by the
Gravity Probe B project.
The bending of starlight by
gravity was confirmed in the
19605, but until now it has been
impossible to test geodetic

precession and frame-dragging.
Using Stanford's newly-devel
oped, high-precision gyroscopes
and telescopes, these can now be
tested, according to project sci
entists.
The gyroscopes manufactured
in the Stanford High Energy
Physics Lab are close to the most
perfectly circular objects on
Earth. Parkinson said such preci
sion is necessary because the
gyroscopes will have to spin in
place for two years, and any im
balance could ruin their perform
ance.
A spinning bicycle wheel is an
example of a gyroscope; if
you've ever held one in your
hands and tried to turn it on its
side, you know that the spinning
wheel tries to stay in place.
Geodetic precession is the turn
ing of a gyroscope's axis caused
by its movement through curved
space. Frame-dragging is the
twisting of space-time by
massive rotating bodies.
Because the expected effects
due to geodetic precession and
frame-dragging are so slight, it

has taken decades of engineering
breakthroughs to make the Stan
ford satellite test possible.
Parkinson said that planning
and building the components of
this satellite has become the larg
est engineering project on
campus. It involves 32 people
full-time and draws from both the
School of Engineering and the
School of Humanities and
Sciences.
Although it is being funded by
NASA, the projected $185 mil
lion effort is being conducted
largely at Stanford.
The gyroscopes to be used in
the test satellites are coated with
niobium, a metal that is capable
of superconducting at low tem
peratures. Superconductors offer
no resistance to electrons flowing
through them.
The superconducting coating
allows scientists to measure the
gyroscopes' angle of spin. When
the gyroscopes are spinning in
space, the superconducting
coating causes the gyroscopes to
act like tiny magnets, with poles
along the axes of spin.
