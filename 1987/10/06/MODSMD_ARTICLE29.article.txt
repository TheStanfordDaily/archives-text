# Allergy shots stem asthma

Californians who suffer from wheezing, stuffy
noses and itchy eyes during the summer may
soon be cured of all three symptoms by the same
treatment, according to a study done by a Stan
ford scientist.
Many Californians are allergic to a type of pol
len made by rye grass. Dr. Richard Moss, assis
tant professor of pediatrics at Stanford's
Children's Hospital, found that allergy shots for
rye grass pollen not only quell hay fever
symptoms, but also asthma in those people suf
fering from both.
Moss calls rye grass pollen "the most impor
tant" allergy in California. Because of the abun
dance of the pollen here, more Californians ex
perience allergic reactions to rye grass pollen
than to any other substance, and the symptoms
provoked by the pollen are also more severe.
Moss' colleagues on the study gave a group of
10 allergic individuals a series of allergy shots
containing rye grass extract over a period of
months. During this time, he gave a second
group of 10 a placebo, a nonactive allergy ex
tract. Neither the doctors nor the patients knew
which group received the placebo injection until
they saw the results of the study, according to
Moss.
When Moss compared the allergic reactions of
the two groups the following season, he found
that the people who received the grass pollen ex
tract were experiencing fewer and less severe
symptoms than the people in the control group.
Moss concluded from these results that the
allergy shots were effective in controlling
asthma as well as hay fever in cases where the
same environmental substance causes both.
Moss said there are very few studies that show
allergy shots work to prevent asthma. He said
his finding is not widely appreciated by the gen
eral medical community, although it is by many
allergists. Doctors usually use a different
medication for asthma.
Moss used several lines of evidence to link the
asthma and hay fever to a single cause. He found
that the amount of grass pollen in the air on a
given day is directly proportional to the severity

of the symptoms that asthma patients experience
on that day. Blood tests confirm these findings.
Pollen counts also correlated with the number
of emergency room and regular hospital visits
for asthma patients. In addition, these patients
suffered asthmatic reactions when forced to
breathe the grass pollen.
From these observations, Moss concluded
that more people with asthma should have
allergy evaluations. Allergies are an important
cause of asthma in people up to age 50, he said.
Allergic reactions are caused when the body
makes too much of a certain type of protein upon
exposure to the allergic substance or allergen.
The protein causing the allergic reactions
belongs to a class of molecules called antibodies.
Most types of antibodies are produced by the
body in order to fight infection, but a special
type of antibody, called IgE, causes allergic re
actions.
Allergy shots must be given in small, but
gradually increasing, doses in order to build up
the patient's immunity without provoking an
allergic reaction, according to Moss. Moss ad
ministered the shots in his study over a period of
several months. In regular clinical practice,
allergy patients go through this treatment for a
number of years.
Scientists have known since 1910 that allergy
shots will help decrease allergic symptoms but
Moss said that today "we are still in the dark
about how they work inside the body."
Some facts about the way allergy shots work
are known. Allergy shots increase the number of
disease-fighting antibodies in the patient's body.
This is determined via blood tests. These lgG an
tibodies block the allergic reaction. It is not
known, however, how they block the reaction.
Moss is now looking carefully at how the IgG
antibodies react with cells inside the body and
whether there is a particular subgroup of these
molecules that is responsible for blocking the
allergic reaction.
"Asthma is more complex than hay fever,"
Moss said, noting that this is why doctors in the
past did not think an allergy shot could help quell
asthmatic symptoms. Some types of asthma are
allergic in origin and some are not, according to
Moss.
