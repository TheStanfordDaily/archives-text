# Campbell enjoys being dark horse

Law Prof. Pom Campbell is a
busy man, but he's still got a
sense of humor. When he is
reminded that Rep. Ernie Kon
nyu, his opponent in June's Re
publican primary for the 12th

Campaign '88

Congressional District, summed
up Campbell's chances of defeat
ing him by saying, "Nobodies
don't get elected to Congress,"
Campbell laughs.
"One of my students sugges
ted a campaign slogan,"
Campbell said. " 'Nobody's per
fect.' 1 like that."
The all but-officially declared

candidate has a somewhat impish
grin that belies his choirboy face.
Campbell, 35, knows what it's
like not to be taken seriously at
first glance, and he relishes the
position.
"I don't think Konnyu knows
much about me yet," Campbell
said. "That will change, indue
time."
"He's attempting to call me a
Carter Democrat. That line has
gotten more laughter from my
colleagues."
Last week Campbell officially
set up an "exploratory" commit
tee to begin organizing his cam
paign against the first-term in
cumbent. Campbell plans to
remain low-key for the immedi
ate future.
