# Campbell enjoys being dark horse

### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Law Prof. Pom Campbell is a
busy man, but he's still got a
sense of humor. When he is
reminded that Rep. Ernie Kon
nyu, his opponent in June's Re
publican primary for the 12th

Campaign '88

Congressional District, summed
up Campbell's chances of defeat
ing him by saying, "Nobodies
don't get elected to Congress,"
Campbell laughs.
"One of my students sugges
ted a campaign slogan,"
Campbell said. " 'Nobody's per
fect.' 1 like that."
The all but-officially declared

candidate has a somewhat impish
grin that belies his choirboy face.
Campbell, 35, knows what it's
like not to be taken seriously at
first glance, and he relishes the
position.
"I don't think Konnyu knows
much about me yet," Campbell
said. "That will change, indue
time."
"He's attempting to call me a
Carter Democrat. That line has
gotten more laughter from my
colleagues."
Last week Campbell officially
set up an "exploratory" commit
tee to begin organizing his cam
paign against the first-term in
cumbent. Campbell plans to
remain low-key for the immedi
ate future.
"I will be talking to individuals
until January, but I won't be
making public appearances or
speeches," he said, emphasizing
that he will continue his work
through the end of the semester
at the Law School, where he
teaches antitrust law, transaction
law and international business
law. If all goes according to plan,
a special leave of absence for the
spring will be worked out with
approval of the Law School ad
ministration.
Campbell has a prodigious
resume, having worked for two
presidents and a Supreme Court
justice. He knows, though, that
resumes don't win elections. "I
would like to meet every voter I
can," said Campbell, cautioning
that the supposedly "safe" Re
publican 12th District, stretching
from affluent parts of southern
San Mateo County through Stan
ford and down to San Jose,

"could very well be won by the
Democrats.
"When people say it's a safe
district, that's relative. The 1980
gerrymandering gave us as
Republicans a district as possible
within the Bay Area, but that's
no guarantee.
"Konnyu's position is weak,
but that doesn't mean the winner
of the primary will stroll through
the general election." he said.
When asked about the prob
lems facing the incumbent,
Campbell cited a poll illustrating
the impact of charges made in an
early August San Jose Mercury
News article that Konnyu
sexually harassed two of his
female staff members and an
gered House Republican leaders
in an alleged name-calling inci
dent.
"From a poll of 400 district
voters, 34 percent want a change,
and 28 percent were happy with
the incumbent. When told of the
allegations in the Mercury News
article, those figures change to 58
percent who want a new repre
sentative and 15 percent who ap
prove of the incumbent. The

party needs to act," Campbell
said.
In 1981, at age 29, Campbell
had the responsibility of oversee
ing 200 employees and a $15 mil
lion budget as President
Reagan's director of the Bureau
of Competition at the Federal
Trade Commission.
But Campbell lights up most
when discussing his year spent as
a clerk to Supreme Court Justice
Byron White. "1 learned will, de
termination and conscience from
Byron White," said Campbell in
a tone of reverence.
Campbell is unafraid to discuss
issues, but he tiptoes around the
controversy surrounding Kon
nyu. He says he wants to
promote himself positively and
stay out of a mudslinging contest.
Some of his political philosophy:
• "To be conservative is to
save, preserve — not to lose
what we've achieved. To try to
correct the budget deficit is con
servative."
• "To protect the American
position in the world with respect
to trade is conservative. Trade
laws should be changed. We

have completely unsatifactory
levels of protection for entrepre
neurs. We need explicitly, as part
of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, a commitment
to protect American intellectual
property, which translates to our
copyrighted software from
Silicon Valley. This is a real
issue, and Krnie Konnyu lacks
knowledge and command of the
problem."
• "We have come far, hut not
far enough, on civil rights. I sup
port Judge Bork (President
Reagan's nominee to the Su
preme Court). I won't retreat
from that."
Campbell calls the Bork confir
mation hearings, where he
testifed in defense of Bork's
labor record, a seminal event for
today's college generation.
"The civil rights struggle and
Vietnam War were the molding
events of my generation. In my
generation the end result was
everything,'" Campbell said.
"Now we talk about fine
points. The theoretical struggles
are more important than the end
result, it seems."

Law Prof. Tom Campbell's Congressional campaign is still in the early
stages, but his political experience may make him a force to be reckoned
with in the June Republican primary.
