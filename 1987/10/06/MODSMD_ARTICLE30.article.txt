## Stanford licks its wounds 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
Despite an 0-4 overall record and an
0-2 mark in league play, there is at least
one optimistic note for the Stanford
football team as it heads into its third
Pacific 10 Conference game of the
season Saturday at Washington State.
There are no injuries.
Should the rest of the week be
injury-free, the Cardinal will have the
services of tailback Brad Muster and
linebacker Barry McKeever in the
same game for the first time this
season.
Muster, hampered by a severely
sprained ankle since the beginning of
fall practice, and McKeever, recover
ing from knee surgery last spring, are
crucial players for the Cardinal.
Muster was the leading Stanford
rusher last year and was named the
Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year.
He was considered to be a leading can
didate for the Heisman Trophy before
missing three of Stanford's first four
games, including both league contests.
McKeever, the leading returning tack
ier from last year's squad, saw his first
action of the season Saturday against
UCLA.

Muster and McKeever will both be
needed against the Cougars (2-2, 0-0).
Offensively, the Cardinal is averaging
just 92 yards rushing per game, after
managing only .7 yards per carry
against the Bruins. Muster rushed for
over 1000 yards last year and is averag
ing 4.2 yards per carry in his career.
On the other side of the ball, Stan
ford is surrendering a whopping 265
yards rushing and 480 yards of total of
fense per game. McKeever collected 94
tackles last season, second only to
Dave Wyman.
Fullback Marshall Dillard should
also see action this week after sitting
out last week's contest with recurring
back spasms. Dillard is second on the
team with 108 yards rushing (quarter
back Greg Enms leads with 128), and
he averages 4.3 yards per carry.
"When Muster is in the lineup, that
makes for a heck of a lineup, especially
with Dillard, too," Washington State
Head Coach Dennis Erickson said.
"With them coming back, that takes
the pressure off of Ennis or (Scott)
Stark, whoever plays."
Ah, whoever plays. . . .
That's been the question for the last
week. Stark didn't seem to be the an
swer against UCLA, Ennis has been in

consistent, and sophomore Brian
Johnson, who came in for the last 1:28
Saturday, has compounded the prob
lem. "I think he's great," Klway said
of Johnson. "And he's in the picture.
So who starts against the Cougars?
"I'm open to a lot of things," Elway
said. "We have to look at this day by
day and week by week.
"Greg has to concentrate on the
point of attack as far as the passing
game is concerned," Elway added.
"Stark had a lot of pressure on him,
and they changed up a lot against him.
We were overwhelmed by an outstand
ing defense. We've got to ultimately
get settled at the quarterback posi
tion."
Card notes
Washington State Coach Krickson was
the offensive coordinator at San Jose State
for three years (1979-81) under Elway. "1
had some great times at San Jose," Krick
son said. "Jack was fun to work for. That
was a great three years 1 spent with Jack at
San Jose State."

Plunkett, the Heisman Trophy winner.
