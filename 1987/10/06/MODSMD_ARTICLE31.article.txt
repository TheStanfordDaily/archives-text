# Athletes seek gold in 1988
## 
### 
Traditionally people have
headed to California in search of
gold, hut recently two young
Stanford women have turned
back to the East in their quest for
the precious metal.

Michelle Griglione and Debi
Thomas, who are now in
Alexandria, Va., and Boulder,
Co., respectively, are not
seeking the gold in them thar
hills, though. Instead they are
looking for the gold found in
Olympic medals.
While Griglione, a swimmer
hoping to compete in this sum
mer's Games in Seoul, and
Thomas, a skater gearing up for

the Winter Games in Calgary, are
pointing toward different com
petitions, both are world-class
athletes who have decided their
Stanford educations can take a
temporary back seat to their
Olympic hopes.
This Olympiad will likely be
the only chance for both to
realize their Olympic dreams.
Thomas will probably sign a
lucrative pro contract after the
Games are completed, and
Griglione competes in a sport
where athletes mature quickly
and the next new phenom is only
a major championship away from
bursting on the scene.
Therefore, Thomas' decision
to stop out comes as no surprise.
Her grueling practice and compe
tition schedule leaves little time
for her equally demanding work
as a pre-med, and she had said as
early as her freshman year that
she planned to take a break from
Stanford prior to the Olympics.
Her decision was also influenced
by the closing of her practice rink

in Redwood City and her desire
to train at high altitude in
Boulder.
While Thomas was unavailable
for comment, one of her
spokespeople reported that
Thomas is living with a family
and their young daughter in
Boulder. She is working out six
hours a day with her coach, Alex
McGowan, and skating at the
Colorado University Student
Recreation Center rink. She is
also taking a few classes during
the fall semester before entering
the final leg of her Olympic push.
She plans to return to Stanford in
the fall of 1988.
Griglione's departure was
more unexpected, although it's
not unusual for top swimmers to
take time off in an Olympic
season. Former California star
Mary T. Meagher did so before
the Los Angeles Games, and a
handful of other collegians plan
to sit out this year.
