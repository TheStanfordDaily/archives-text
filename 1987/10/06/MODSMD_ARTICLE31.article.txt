# Athletes seek gold in 1988
## 
### 
Traditionally people have
headed to California in search of
gold, hut recently two young
Stanford women have turned
back to the East in their quest for
the precious metal.

Michelle Griglione and Debi
Thomas, who are now in
Alexandria, Va., and Boulder,
Co., respectively, are not
seeking the gold in them thar
hills, though. Instead they are
looking for the gold found in
Olympic medals.
While Griglione, a swimmer
hoping to compete in this sum
mer's Games in Seoul, and
Thomas, a skater gearing up for

the Winter Games in Calgary, are
pointing toward different com
petitions, both are world-class
athletes who have decided their
Stanford educations can take a
temporary back seat to their
Olympic hopes.
This Olympiad will likely be
the only chance for both to
realize their Olympic dreams.
Thomas will probably sign a
lucrative pro contract after the
Games are completed, and
Griglione competes in a sport
where athletes mature quickly
and the next new phenom is only
a major championship away from
bursting on the scene.
Therefore, Thomas' decision
to stop out comes as no surprise.
Her grueling practice and compe
tition schedule leaves little time
for her equally demanding work
as a pre-med, and she had said as
early as her freshman year that
she planned to take a break from
Stanford prior to the Olympics.
Her decision was also influenced
by the closing of her practice rink

in Redwood City and her desire
to train at high altitude in
Boulder.
While Thomas was unavailable
for comment, one of her
spokespeople reported that
Thomas is living with a family
and their young daughter in
Boulder. She is working out six
hours a day with her coach, Alex
McGowan, and skating at the
Colorado University Student
Recreation Center rink. She is
also taking a few classes during
the fall semester before entering
the final leg of her Olympic push.
She plans to return to Stanford in
the fall of 1988.
Griglione's departure was
more unexpected, although it's
not unusual for top swimmers to
take time off in an Olympic
season. Former California star
Mary T. Meagher did so before
the Los Angeles Games, and a
handful of other collegians plan
to sit out this year.

Figure skater l)ebi Thomas and swimmer Michelle Griglione have stopped out of school to train for the 1988
Olympics.
Griglione has decided to return
home in hopes of regaining the
momentum that took her to the
top of the swimming world but
then left her during a disappoint
ing and frustrating freshman year
in the pool.
Griglione arrived at Stanford
fresh off a second-place finish in
a 400-meter individual medley
race she felt she could have won
at the World Championships.
She had gone toe-to-toe with the
East Germans and Russians and
held her own. She was touted as
the next Tracy Caulkins.
By the end of her first year,
though, she was visibly strug
gling as she finished a distant
second in a mediocre 400-yard
1M field at the NCAA Champion
ships. A season that began with
such promise was crashing down
around her, and the roof caved in
at the U.S. Championships when
she could only manage a sixth in
the 400-meter IM.
Her tailspin showed no signs of
ending, and it was the night of
her U.S. Championships disap
pointment that she decided to
return home.
Now she's back in Alexandria,
swimming at the YMCA across
the street from her house and

taking a psychology class at
Northern Virginia Community
College.
Griglione is back in the nor
mal, comfortable surroundings
that originally nurtured her tal
ent, and she's quick to empha
size that her departure should not
reflect poorly on Stanford swim
ming.
"Everybody has the impres
sion it's because of (Stanford
Coach) George (Haines) and
Stanford's program," Griglione
said. "That's totally wrong. I
think Stanford's program is the
best. Everybody else did fine, so
obviously it wasn't Stanford's
problem. It was mine, so that's
what prompted me to come
home."
Haines trains champions. In
the past he has coached such
luminaries as Mark Spitz, and he
currently guides Stanford super
stars Jenna Johnson and Susan
Rapp. Griglione's problems in
the pool were more a result of her
trying to fit her Stanford educa
tion and swimming career into
the same schedule. While others
have done it. Griglione, who is
intense even as top athletes go,
found that her swimming suf
fered.
"I didn't uphold my end of the
deal," she said. "It's so hard to
be at Stanford and think about
swimming, because there are so
many things to do. I'm sort of an

intense person. It was a real jolt,
the change in lifestyle. It was
hard. Weight was a really big
problem, because I was about 10
pounds overweight even before
the season started. It took me the
whole year to get it off. It wasn't
fair to George.
"I miss Stanford a lot, (but) I
figure it will be there next year.
I'm going to come back next
year."
At home Griglione will not
have to worry about problem sets
and exams or any other distrac
tions, instead concentrating
solely on her swimming.
Meanwhile, the rest of the
squad has resumed fall workouts.
With Griglione, Stanford would
have been favored to topple four
time champion Texas at next
spring's NCAAs. Without her,
the Cardinal can probably be
considered only the slight favor
ite in what is already shaping up
as a battle royal between the two
heavyweights of the collegiate
women's swimming world.
Most people never get a
chance for Olympic fame, so
Griglione and Thomas are trying
to make the most of a rare oppor
tunity. As Griglione said, Stan
ford will always be here, but for
both young women this will
likely be their once-in-a-lifetime
shot at the Olympics. They're
doing what they can to make
their golden dreams come true.

Co., respectively, are not
seeking the gold in them thar
hills, though. Instead they are
looking for the gold found in
Olympic medals.
While Griglione, a swimmer
hoping to compete in this sum
mer's Games in Seoul, and
Thomas, a skater gearing up for

the Winter Games in Calgary, are
pointing toward different com
petitions, both are world-class
athletes who have decided their
Stanford educations can take a
temporary back seat to their
Olympic hopes.
This Olympiad will likely be
the only chance for both to
realize their Olympic dreams.
Thomas will probably sign a
lucrative pro contract after the
Games are completed, and
Griglione competes in a sport
where athletes mature quickly
and the next new phenom is only
a major championship away from
bursting on the scene.
Therefore, Thomas' decision
to stop out comes as no surprise.
Her grueling practice and compe
tition schedule leaves little time
for her equally demanding work
as a pre-med, and she had said as
early as her freshman year that
she planned to take a break from
Stanford prior to the Olympics.
Her decision was also influenced
by the closing of her practice rink

in Redwood City and her desire
to train at high altitude in
Boulder.
While Thomas was unavailable
for comment, one of her
spokespeople reported that
Thomas is living with a family
and their young daughter in
Boulder. She is working out six
hours a day with her coach, Alex
McGowan, and skating at the
Colorado University Student
Recreation Center rink. She is
also taking a few classes during
the fall semester before entering
the final leg of her Olympic push.
She plans to return to Stanford in
the fall of 1988.
Griglione's departure was
more unexpected, although it's
not unusual for top swimmers to
take time off in an Olympic
season. Former California star
Mary T. Meagher did so before
the Los Angeles Games, and a
handful of other collegians plan
to sit out this year.

Figure skater l)ebi Thomas and swimmer Michelle Griglione have stopped out of school to train for the 1988
Olympics.
Griglione has decided to return
home in hopes of regaining the
momentum that took her to the
top of the swimming world but
then left her during a disappoint
ing and frustrating freshman year
in the pool.
Griglione arrived at Stanford
fresh off a second-place finish in
a 400-meter individual medley
race she felt she could have won
at the World Championships.
She had gone toe-to-toe with the
East Germans and Russians and
held her own. She was touted as
the next Tracy Caulkins.
By the end of her first year,
though, she was visibly strug
gling as she finished a distant
second in a mediocre 400-yard
1M field at the NCAA Champion
ships. A season that began with
such promise was crashing down
around her, and the roof caved in
at the U.S. Championships when
she could only manage a sixth in
the 400-meter IM.
Her tailspin showed no signs of
ending, and it was the night of
her U.S. Championships disap
pointment that she decided to
return home.
Now she's back in Alexandria,
swimming at the YMCA across
the street from her house and

taking a psychology class at
Northern Virginia Community
College.
Griglione is back in the nor
mal, comfortable surroundings
that originally nurtured her tal
ent, and she's quick to empha
size that her departure should not
reflect poorly on Stanford swim
ming.
"Everybody has the impres
sion it's because of (Stanford
Coach) George (Haines) and
Stanford's program," Griglione
said. "That's totally wrong. I
think Stanford's program is the
best. Everybody else did fine, so
obviously it wasn't Stanford's
problem. It was mine, so that's
what prompted me to come
home."
Haines trains champions. In
the past he has coached such
luminaries as Mark Spitz, and he
currently guides Stanford super
stars Jenna Johnson and Susan
Rapp. Griglione's problems in
the pool were more a result of her
trying to fit her Stanford educa
tion and swimming career into
the same schedule. While others
have done it. Griglione, who is
intense even as top athletes go,
found that her swimming suf
fered.
"I didn't uphold my end of the
deal," she said. "It's so hard to
be at Stanford and think about
swimming, because there are so
many things to do. I'm sort of an

intense person. It was a real jolt,
the change in lifestyle. It was
hard. Weight was a really big
problem, because I was about 10
pounds overweight even before
the season started. It took me the
whole year to get it off. It wasn't
fair to George.
"I miss Stanford a lot, (but) I
figure it will be there next year.
I'm going to come back next
year."
At home Griglione will not
have to worry about problem sets
and exams or any other distrac
tions, instead concentrating
solely on her swimming.
Meanwhile, the rest of the
squad has resumed fall workouts.
With Griglione, Stanford would
have been favored to topple four
time champion Texas at next
spring's NCAAs. Without her,
the Cardinal can probably be
considered only the slight favor
ite in what is already shaping up
as a battle royal between the two
heavyweights of the collegiate
women's swimming world.
Most people never get a
chance for Olympic fame, so
Griglione and Thomas are trying
to make the most of a rare oppor
tunity. As Griglione said, Stan
ford will always be here, but for
both young women this will
likely be their once-in-a-lifetime
shot at the Olympics. They're
doing what they can to make
their golden dreams come true.
Traditionally people have
headed to California in search of
gold, hut recently two young
Stanford women have turned
back to the East in their quest for
the precious metal.

Michelle Griglione and Debi
Thomas, who are now in
Alexandria, Va., and Boulder,
Co., respectively, are not
