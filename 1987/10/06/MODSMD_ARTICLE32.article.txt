### Chris Cruder Editorial staff 
After winning the Jostens Invitational tourna
ment Friday night, the Stanford women's volley
ball team will look to add another win tonight when
it travels to San Jose State to face the Spartans for
the unofficial South Bay championship.
Unlike last year, when the Spartans twice beat
Stanford, the Cardinal comes in as the favorite
tonight. Fifth-ranked Stanford is "on a bit of a roll
now," according to Coach Don Shaw. The Cardi
nal is on a five-match winning streak and has won
15 of 16 games over that period, including sweeps
of No. II Texas and No. 13 UC-Santa Barbara.
The 10-3 Cardinal will definitely get a challenge
from the lOth-ranked Spartans, who are 8-1. San
Jose comes in fresh from its first loss of the season,
against No. 14 Long Beach State on Saturday in
Long Beach.
San Jose returns only two starters from the team

that was ranked first in the nation for a few weeks
last year, but those two are having fine seasons.
Setter Danielle Spier is running a well-balanced at
tack, and middle blocker Barbara Higgins posted
career highs with 34 digs and 23 kills in a match two
weeks ago.
Gina Watson has stepped into her starting role
well, already having reached the 20-kill mark
several times, and Kari Roberson has been tallying
a lot of blocks opposite Higgins in the middle.
The Cardinal is led by seniors Teresa Smith and
Jostens MVP Nancy Reno, who have 176 and 174
kills, respectively. Defensively, senior Wendi Rush
has 144 digs, followed by junior Amy Hayes' 138,
and Reno has 49 total blocks.
The Cardinal is presently 4-1 in Pacific 10 Con
ference action and will try to use tonight's match as
a springboard for matches at Oregon State and
Oregon this weekend. The Cardinal is currently
trailing the Ducks, who are 6-0 in league, and
UCLA (5-1).
