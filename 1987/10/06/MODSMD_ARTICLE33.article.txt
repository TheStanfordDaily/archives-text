# Students propose award for virtue
## 
### Gordon Stephenson 
Two members of the ASSU Speakers
Bureau have proposed an annual award to be
given to an individual who best combines
several virtues — humanitarianism, integrity,
honor, responsibility and the pursuit of lofty
goals — in his profession.
Sophomores Andy Berke and Ira Lit con
ceived of the idea in order to "provide the im
petus for these people to come speak on
campus."
Nominations for the proposed award will
be accepted from anyone involved with the
University, and finalists will be selected by a
10-member committee.
Lit and Berke said the members of the se
lection committee would represent as many
different sectors of the campus community as
possible.
Two ASSU senators (one graduate and one
undergraduate) two Speakers Bureau mem
bers (Lit and Berke), a COP representative
and the Speakers Bureau chair, Terri James,
will serve on the committee.
Faculty and University staff members will
include Catherine Milton from the Public Ser
vice Center, one member of the Faculty Sen

ate and one representative from both the
Provost's Office and the Office of Student Af
fairs.
"It won't be a perfect representation of the
University. But it's a good start," Berke
said.
"As we go through the year, and in years
to come, revisions of the selection process
can and will be made to improve the award,"
he added.
In order to be eligible for the honor, the
recipient must actually come to Stanford
sometime in the spring to make an accept
ance speech at an award presentation cere
mony.
Unlike other notable speakers brought to
campus by the Speakers Bureau, this individ
ual will receive no honorarium or other cash
benefits. Travel and related expenses will be
paid for, but the actual award will be a plaque
indicating the honor and the prestige that
would go along with receiving such a distinc
tion.
While other universities have "Man of the
Year" awards, Lit said the award would be
different because the accomplishments of the
recipient would not be the only basis for se
lection.

In their proposal, Ira and Berke said the
"award should he given to an individual who
has managed to combine great achievement
in his or her field with honor and
humanitarianism."
The original intent of Harvard's "Hasty
Pudding Award" may have been similar to
this proposal's, but it is now nothing more
than a forum for entertainers to come speak
at that university. Lit and Berke said, noting
that recent recipients included Bill Murray
and Sylvester Stallone.
Berke and Ira said they hope that a typical
recipient of the Stanford award will be some
one like Albert Einstein, who not only
reached the upper limits of his field, but also
managed to exhibit extremely humanitarian
ethics.
Beginning tomorrow and lasting two
weeks, the initial nominations will be ac
cepted at a booth in While Plaza. There will
also be boxes in the ASSU and Daily offices
where names can be submitted.
The selection committee will discuss the
top six nominees along with three nominees
chosen by the Speakers Bureau chair.
The committee hopes to pick the finalist by
the end of fall quarter in order to notify him in
time for a spring appearance.
