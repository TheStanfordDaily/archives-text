### Priya Agarwal 
Congress should consider
various forms of financial assis
tance to black labor unions in
South Africa, according to Law
Prof. William Gould.
In a Sept. 25 speech to the
Congressional Black Caucus
foreign policy meeting in Wash
ington, D.C., Gould suggested
that there are several possible
avenues to provide such aid.
The first would be to use the
same approach used in giving
funds to the Solidarity labor
movement in Poland.
Another method of aid, he
said, would be to encourage uni
versities, including Stanford, "to
bring unionists and other officers
to American or other universities

for training in trade union organi
zation and collective bargain
ing."
The third possibility would in
volve assisting American labor
unions such as the AFL-CIO to
provide black labor unions with
funds.
Gould called such financial aid
"the most vital and significant
anti-apartheid effort."
He said that the black trade un
ion movement is the only anti
apartheid group that is a
"coherent, institutionalized or
ganization.
"They are by definition organ
ized with over one million mem
bers," Gould said. "They repre
sent workers who are in a posi
tion to disrupt the economy."
Gould said his comparison be

tween black labor unions in
South Africa and the Polish
Solidarity movement is appropri
ate because there are the "same
phenomena in both countries."
He pointed out the hostility of
both governments, the social
concerns of both labor organiza
tions and the lack of democratic
avenues for the workers to make
clear their opinions.
Gould said the United States'
failure to support South African
unions suggests that "a double
standard exists in American
foreign policy.
"The Reagan administration
has an interest in Solidarity, but
it is an interest that is not focused
on the social aspects of the
movement, but on East-West
conflict," he said.

Gould said he believed he
received "affirmative interest"
in his idea at the meeting, adding
that the presence of Rep. William
Gray (D-Mich.), chairman of the
budget committee, was a solid in
dication of interest.
According to Gould, Stanford
has taken constructive steps
toward eliminating apartheid by
beginning programs to educate
black South Africans. Gould said
he felt that devising programs
and courses for unionists would
be a particularly good way to im
plement the program.
Gould, a black American,
teaches labor law. He visited un
ion leaders and others in South
Africa in 1977 and 1979 but was
denied a visa when he tried to
return in 1984.
