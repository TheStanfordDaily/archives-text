## 'Block Bork' efforts continue 
### Jennifer Schmid Liz Chang 
Stanford students will join students nationwide
today in an effort to convince the Senate Judiciary
Committee not to approve Supreme Court nominee
Robert Bork.
Students at more than 36 campuses in about 13
states are joining in rallies, sit-ins. candlelight vigils
and massive letter-writing campaigns to U.S.
senators in an effort to show the committee their
opposition to Bork's nomination.
The so-called National Block Bork Day is being
organized by the National Student Action Commit
tee in Washington, D.C. Protest organizers said the
activities have been planned because they believe
Bork's ascension to the Supreme Court would dis
rupt the balance of the court and lead to dangerous
infringements of personal rights.
Barb Voss. press representative for the Block
Bork Movement at Stanford, said students here
plan to concentrate on letter-writing campaigns to

Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) and other senators who
support the nomination.
Voss said a table will be set up in White Plaza
today from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. where students can
write their senators in protest of the nomination.
She said she hoped for 200 letters today, noting
that a table set up Friday yielded 50 letters in the
first hour of operation.
Voss said that, because she believes letter writing
is the most effective way to influence the Senate
committee, the Stanford Block Bork Movement
has no additional activities planned. She stated,
however, that Stanford may plan activities with
UC-Berkeley students in the future if Bork's nomi
nation continues to be tightly contested.
Voss said she objects to Bork because he
"doesn't see the big picture very well.
"1 think his interpretation of the Constitution is
flawed, because he doesn't see the human ele
ment," she said.
"Bork sees the Constitution as
a static document when, in fact,
it is not," Voss added.
Voss also said she hopes that
President Reagan will withdraw
his nomination of Bork. But he
cause withdrawal is unlikely, she
said, letter-writing campaigns are
important in order to defeat Bork
on the Senate floor.
Bork's nomination has created
controversy because of the views
he has expressed on civil rights,
abortion, the First Amendment,
the constitutional right to privacy
and other issues.
Mary Preston, legislative di
rector of the Washington-based
U.S. Students Association, said
she believes Bork's nomination
will fail. "There's been
widespread opposition to Bork

— students, women, white
males, people of color," Preston
said. "All these group have come
out against the nomination."
Preston said further that the
reason Bork is so unpopular is
that "Bork is simply behind the
times" in his views on civil rights
and other issues.
The Block Bork Day will be
more than just symbolic, accord
ing to Preston. She said that on
going activites, such as letter
writing to various senators, have
already forced legislators to take
notice of public opinion.
Activities similar to those at
Stanford are planned elsewhere.
Nels Henderson, a student at
UC-Santa Barbara, said that uni
versity will provide students with
letter-writing materials and
telephones to contact senators in
Washington today.
UCSB will also host speakers
from Planned Parenthood and the

American Civil Liberties Union,
Henderson said.
At UC-Berkeley, Barbara Wil
lits, the University Affairs Coor
dinator, said that university is
also hosting many anti-Bork ac
tivities.
Willits said the university has
already sponsored speeches by
political activist Angela Davis
and San Francisco attorney
James Brosnahan, as well as on
going letter campaigns to
Congress.
She said the letter campaign
has yielded about 2000 letters
and postcards to date.
Anti-Bork activities yesterday
included a sit-in at Wilson's of
fice at the Federal Building in
San Francisco, a free-speech
demonstration at the same loca
tion and an evening candlelight
vigil. Those activities were
hosted by the Civil Rights Coali
tion and the Northern Californian
Coalition against Bork.

included a sit-in at Wilson's of
fice at the Federal Building in
San Francisco, a free-speech
demonstration at the same loca
tion and an evening candlelight
vigil. Those activities were
hosted by the Civil Rights Coali
tion and the Northern Californian
Coalition against Bork.
Stanford students will join students nationwide
today in an effort to convince the Senate Judiciary
Committee not to approve Supreme Court nominee
Robert Bork.
Students at more than 36 campuses in about 13
states are joining in rallies, sit-ins. candlelight vigils
and massive letter-writing campaigns to U.S.
senators in an effort to show the committee their
opposition to Bork's nomination.
The so-called National Block Bork Day is being
organized by the National Student Action Commit
tee in Washington, D.C. Protest organizers said the
activities have been planned because they believe
Bork's ascension to the Supreme Court would dis
rupt the balance of the court and lead to dangerous
infringements of personal rights.
Barb Voss. press representative for the Block
Bork Movement at Stanford, said students here
plan to concentrate on letter-writing campaigns to

Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) and other senators who
support the nomination.
Voss said a table will be set up in White Plaza
today from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. where students can
write their senators in protest of the nomination.
She said she hoped for 200 letters today, noting
that a table set up Friday yielded 50 letters in the
first hour of operation.
Voss said that, because she believes letter writing
is the most effective way to influence the Senate
committee, the Stanford Block Bork Movement
has no additional activities planned. She stated,
however, that Stanford may plan activities with
UC-Berkeley students in the future if Bork's nomi
nation continues to be tightly contested.
Voss said she objects to Bork because he
"doesn't see the big picture very well.
"1 think his interpretation of the Constitution is
flawed, because he doesn't see the human ele
ment," she said.
"Bork sees the Constitution as
a static document when, in fact,
it is not," Voss added.
Voss also said she hopes that
President Reagan will withdraw
his nomination of Bork. But he
cause withdrawal is unlikely, she
said, letter-writing campaigns are
important in order to defeat Bork
on the Senate floor.
Bork's nomination has created
controversy because of the views
he has expressed on civil rights,
abortion, the First Amendment,
the constitutional right to privacy
and other issues.
Mary Preston, legislative di
rector of the Washington-based
U.S. Students Association, said
she believes Bork's nomination
will fail. "There's been
widespread opposition to Bork

— students, women, white
males, people of color," Preston
said. "All these group have come
out against the nomination."
Preston said further that the
reason Bork is so unpopular is
that "Bork is simply behind the
times" in his views on civil rights
and other issues.
The Block Bork Day will be
more than just symbolic, accord
ing to Preston. She said that on
going activites, such as letter
writing to various senators, have
already forced legislators to take
notice of public opinion.
Activities similar to those at
Stanford are planned elsewhere.
Nels Henderson, a student at
UC-Santa Barbara, said that uni
versity will provide students with
letter-writing materials and
telephones to contact senators in
Washington today.
UCSB will also host speakers
from Planned Parenthood and the

American Civil Liberties Union,
Henderson said.
At UC-Berkeley, Barbara Wil
lits, the University Affairs Coor
dinator, said that university is
also hosting many anti-Bork ac
tivities.
Willits said the university has
already sponsored speeches by
political activist Angela Davis
and San Francisco attorney
James Brosnahan, as well as on
going letter campaigns to
Congress.
She said the letter campaign
has yielded about 2000 letters
and postcards to date.
Anti-Bork activities yesterday
included a sit-in at Wilson's of
fice at the Federal Building in
San Francisco, a free-speech
demonstration at the same loca
tion and an evening candlelight
vigil. Those activities were
hosted by the Civil Rights Coali
