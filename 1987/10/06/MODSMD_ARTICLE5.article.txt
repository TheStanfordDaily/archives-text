## 'Block Bork' efforts continue 
### Jennifer Schmid Liz Chang 
Stanford students will join students nationwide
today in an effort to convince the Senate Judiciary
Committee not to approve Supreme Court nominee
Robert Bork.
Students at more than 36 campuses in about 13
states are joining in rallies, sit-ins. candlelight vigils
and massive letter-writing campaigns to U.S.
senators in an effort to show the committee their
opposition to Bork's nomination.
The so-called National Block Bork Day is being
organized by the National Student Action Commit
tee in Washington, D.C. Protest organizers said the
activities have been planned because they believe
Bork's ascension to the Supreme Court would dis
rupt the balance of the court and lead to dangerous
infringements of personal rights.
Barb Voss. press representative for the Block
Bork Movement at Stanford, said students here
plan to concentrate on letter-writing campaigns to

Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) and other senators who
support the nomination.
Voss said a table will be set up in White Plaza
today from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. where students can
write their senators in protest of the nomination.
She said she hoped for 200 letters today, noting
that a table set up Friday yielded 50 letters in the
first hour of operation.
Voss said that, because she believes letter writing
is the most effective way to influence the Senate
committee, the Stanford Block Bork Movement
has no additional activities planned. She stated,
however, that Stanford may plan activities with
UC-Berkeley students in the future if Bork's nomi
nation continues to be tightly contested.
Voss said she objects to Bork because he
"doesn't see the big picture very well.
"1 think his interpretation of the Constitution is
flawed, because he doesn't see the human ele
ment," she said.
