# Asbestos removal finished
## 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
The removal and cleanup of as
bestos found in the basement of
Lagunita Court is complete, ac
cording to John Hughes, assis
tant provost for Management and
Budget.
All student storage areas
passed final clearance tests over
the weekend and will be opened
this week, he said. The Univer
sity has been returning student
belongings from those rooms
since Thursday.
Hughes said crews will con
tinue to remove remaining as

bestos in some of the basement's
mechanical rooms. That process,
however, "shouldn't have any
impact on Stanford students'
daily lives," he said.
The $200,000 cleanup, which
began in August, was scheduled
to end last Tuesday, but ran
overtime because of unexepected
problems with the removal of the
asbestos from the basement's
electrical wiring.
Officials had planned to clean
Lagunita sometime during the ac
ademic year, but the project's
starting date was moved up when
electrical workers realized their

work would damage pipe casings
containing asbestos.
The Lagunita cleanup is just
one in a series of projects to
remove the carcinogenic fiber
from campus.
Hughes has said that most
campus buildings constructed
before 1976 probably contain
some asbestos, but that there is
no risk from the fibers.
Cleanup efforts around cam
pus are expected to continue for
"a very long time," Hughes said.
Workers are currently surveying
sites around campus to deter
mine which project should be un
dertaken next.
