# Pacific Rim trip planned
## Orchestra may tour 
### Suha Jhaveri Staff writer 
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra will
tour the Pacific Rim next summer, pend
ing approval by the University adminis
tration.
The tour, which is scheduled to take
place June 16 to July 3, could include per
formances in Taiwan, South Korea,
Japan, Hong Kong. Singapore and Shan
ghai. The orchestra will probably play in
three places, depending on the availabil
ity of housing and possible concert
schedules.
The symphony has proposed a budget
of $161,000. "This is a worst-case
budget. It will come to this if we have to
pay cash for all food, accomodations and
concert halls," said Charles Barber, as
sistant conductor of this year's orchestra.
At the moment the proposal rests in the
hands of Peter Stansky, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences. If approved by
Stansky, it will continue to the Office of
the Provost's.
Michael Ramsey-Perez, director of

Student Organization Services, has
worked with the tour committee through
out the summer in an effort to secure a
feasible proposal.
"I'm very optimistic. It will be a very
visible promotion of the arts," he said,
adding that the only possible drawback
would be the size of the budget. "There
may be concern on the provost's part as
to if there is enough time to raise the
money."
To date, the orchestra has earned more
than $11 .(KM) from performances over the
summer and other fund-raising efforts.
An additional $48.(MX) is expected from
participants' contributions.
Paul Nghiem, chairman of the sym
phony's tour, said the budget would be
met not only by members' contributions
and performances, but also by cutting
costs.
"We hope for homestays in the
countries we're touring in,"he said.
"Already we have saved thousands of
dollars on airfare with a special deal
we've made."


If the University administration approves its proposal, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra will make a grand tour of at least
three Pacific Rim countrk>s next summer.
