Ortega, opposition begin dialogue
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — President Daniel Ortega in
augurated a dialogue yesterday with political opposition groups
under terms of the Central American peace plan, as U.S.
diplomats said the embassy here is adopting a new activism in
support of that opposition.
Ortega, the only speaker at the opening ceremonies, asked the
12 opposition groups that attended, ranging from ultra
conservative to Marxist-Leninist, to limit the discussions to
how best to carry out the peace accord.
Signed Aug. 7 in Guatemala by the five Central American
presidents, the plan obliges Nicaragua to end a five-year-old
state of emergency and facilitate political pluralism.
Ortega called on the participants to "put aside our philosophi
cal and ideological positions" and "not to use the dialogue to
provoke a confrontation among party positions." Opposition
leaders said they will raise broad issues, such as the separation
of the ruling Sandinista party from the state and the Army.
Two previous attempts at dialogue since October, 1984 ended
in failure.
Friction over procedural details remained and the substantive
talks will not begin until Thursday, Sandinista officials said. Or
tega started the dialogue yesterday so it would be at least for
mally under way when he addresses the U.N. General Assem
bly Thursday, one of his aides said.
AIDS doctors disappointed by AZT
NEW YORK — Many of the first AIDS patients treated with
the much-heralded medication AZT appear to be wasting away
during their second year on the drug, and their doctors are now
pessimistic about their chances for continued survival, it was re
ported here yesterday.
Doctors from the University of Miami School of Medicine
said patients on long-term AZT are losing the weight they had
gained during the first months of therapy and are developing the
life-threatening infections that seemed to have been forestalled
by the drug.
"AZT appears to be a palliative form of treatment that
prolongs life and reduces suffering, but . . . once you get out
beyond 18 months, you see deterioration," said Dr. Gordon
Dickinson, one of the Miami researchers.
He presented the study at the Interscience Conference on An
timicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, an infectious diseases
meeting with about 10,(XX) participants.
The data are potentially significant for the estimated 16,000
people with AIDS or AIDS-related complex who are now re
ceiving AZT, the only anti-AIDS medication approved for mar
keting in the United States. The vast majority started treatment
within the last year.
Salvadoran officials, rebels confer
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Salvadoran government
officials and leftist guerrilla leaders talked into the night yester
day, holding the longest round of peace negotiations in nearly
eight years of civil war.
It was not clear whether the prolonged, two-day session indi
cated progress or a deadlock between President Jose Napoleon
Duarte and commanders of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front.
"They have entered into issues of substance," said Auxiliary
Bishop of San Salvador Gregorio Rosa Chavez, who is acting as
spokesman tor the dialogue. "1 think there is a clear conscious
ness of the responsibility both delegations have to give the
people results, not just tell them there were problems."
Two previous negotiating sessions in 1984 lasted four hours
and 12 hours and ended without substantial agreements. Sun
day's negotiations lasted six hours, and the two sides were still
talking yesterday after nine hours.
Neither the U.S.-backed government nor the guerrillas have
significantly altered their basic positions since the 1984 talks.
The government argues that the guerrillas should put down
their arms and join the existing political system. The guerrillas
say there are two powers in El Salvador and that there should be
a new constitution, integrated armies and a transition govern
ment in which their power would be officially recognized.
Democrats: Trim debate frequency
CHICAGO — Democratic presidential candidates, complain
ing of "too much of a good thing," have launched an effort to
limit the number of debates and joint appearances.
Candidates, faced with invitations to 70 debates or joint ap
pearances by mid-March, complain that they are having little
time to do anything except prepare for and travel across the na
tion for such events. '
The effort to control the "pacing and proliferation" of
debates and forums is expected to come to a head tomorrow af
ternoon when Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair
man Paul Kirk Jr., who has promoted such events as healthy for
the party, is scheduled to meet with the managers of the six
remaining Democratic candidates-.
"None of us are complaining about debates," Rep. Richard
Gephardt, (D-Mo.) said. "It s just we can only do so many."
Candidates are also having trouble deciding which debates to
attend, and are hoping the DNC will help "broker" such events,
according to spokesmen.
It seems that almost every special-interest group and media
outlet in the early primary and caucus states wants its own
debate or forum.
Hite reports women 'dissatisfied''
NEW YORK — A massive new study of American women
and their attitudes toward love shows great dissatisfaction,
alienation and emotional isolation.
Presenting a synopsis of her seven-year study of 4500 women
at a press conference yesterday, cultural historian Shere Hite
said that 98 percent of the women she surveyed reported they
were not satisfied with some aspect of their relationships with
men.
Many of the complaints, the author of two earlier volumes on
male and female sexuality said, concerned "emotional with
holding and distancing by men. Emotional and psychological
harassment from men with whom they have love relationships
was reported by 95 percent of Hite's respondents. She said that
70 percent of the women married at least five years were having
extramarital affairs, nearly equal to the 75 percent of men
married at least five years who said they are having affairs.
Hite found further that only 13 percent of women married
more than two years said they were "in love" with their hus
bands, while 82 percent said they "love" their husbands in a
friendly, but not necessarily passionate, way.
But while study results, published as Volume 3 of "The Hite
Report, Women and Love: A Cultural Revolution in Progress"
(Alfred A. Knopf), paint a less-than-rosy picture of women's
views about love in this country, Hite said yesterday that the
news about men, women and love was not all gloomy.

AIDS doctors disappointed by AZT
NEW YORK — Many of the first AIDS patients treated with
the much-heralded medication AZT appear to be wasting away
during their second year on the drug, and their doctors are now
pessimistic about their chances for continued survival, it was re
ported here yesterday.
Doctors from the University of Miami School of Medicine
said patients on long-term AZT are losing the weight they had
gained during the first months of therapy and are developing the
life-threatening infections that seemed to have been forestalled
by the drug.
"AZT appears to be a palliative form of treatment that
prolongs life and reduces suffering, but . . . once you get out
beyond 18 months, you see deterioration," said Dr. Gordon
Dickinson, one of the Miami researchers.
He presented the study at the Interscience Conference on An
timicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, an infectious diseases
meeting with about 10,(XX) participants.
The data are potentially significant for the estimated 16,000
people with AIDS or AIDS-related complex who are now re
ceiving AZT, the only anti-AIDS medication approved for mar
keting in the United States. The vast majority started treatment
within the last year.
Salvadoran officials, rebels confer
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Salvadoran government
officials and leftist guerrilla leaders talked into the night yester
day, holding the longest round of peace negotiations in nearly
eight years of civil war.
It was not clear whether the prolonged, two-day session indi
cated progress or a deadlock between President Jose Napoleon
Duarte and commanders of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front.
"They have entered into issues of substance," said Auxiliary
Bishop of San Salvador Gregorio Rosa Chavez, who is acting as
spokesman tor the dialogue. "1 think there is a clear conscious
ness of the responsibility both delegations have to give the
people results, not just tell them there were problems."
Two previous negotiating sessions in 1984 lasted four hours
and 12 hours and ended without substantial agreements. Sun
day's negotiations lasted six hours, and the two sides were still
talking yesterday after nine hours.
Neither the U.S.-backed government nor the guerrillas have
significantly altered their basic positions since the 1984 talks.
The government argues that the guerrillas should put down
their arms and join the existing political system. The guerrillas
say there are two powers in El Salvador and that there should be
a new constitution, integrated armies and a transition govern
ment in which their power would be officially recognized.
Democrats: Trim debate frequency
CHICAGO — Democratic presidential candidates, complain
ing of "too much of a good thing," have launched an effort to
limit the number of debates and joint appearances.
Candidates, faced with invitations to 70 debates or joint ap
pearances by mid-March, complain that they are having little
time to do anything except prepare for and travel across the na
tion for such events. '
The effort to control the "pacing and proliferation" of
debates and forums is expected to come to a head tomorrow af
ternoon when Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair
man Paul Kirk Jr., who has promoted such events as healthy for
the party, is scheduled to meet with the managers of the six
remaining Democratic candidates-.
"None of us are complaining about debates," Rep. Richard
Gephardt, (D-Mo.) said. "It s just we can only do so many."
Candidates are also having trouble deciding which debates to
attend, and are hoping the DNC will help "broker" such events,
according to spokesmen.
It seems that almost every special-interest group and media
outlet in the early primary and caucus states wants its own
debate or forum.
Hite reports women 'dissatisfied''
NEW YORK — A massive new study of American women
and their attitudes toward love shows great dissatisfaction,
alienation and emotional isolation.
Presenting a synopsis of her seven-year study of 4500 women
at a press conference yesterday, cultural historian Shere Hite
said that 98 percent of the women she surveyed reported they
were not satisfied with some aspect of their relationships with
men.
Many of the complaints, the author of two earlier volumes on
male and female sexuality said, concerned "emotional with
holding and distancing by men. Emotional and psychological
harassment from men with whom they have love relationships
was reported by 95 percent of Hite's respondents. She said that
70 percent of the women married at least five years were having
extramarital affairs, nearly equal to the 75 percent of men
married at least five years who said they are having affairs.
Hite found further that only 13 percent of women married
more than two years said they were "in love" with their hus
bands, while 82 percent said they "love" their husbands in a
friendly, but not necessarily passionate, way.
But while study results, published as Volume 3 of "The Hite
Report, Women and Love: A Cultural Revolution in Progress"
(Alfred A. Knopf), paint a less-than-rosy picture of women's
views about love in this country, Hite said yesterday that the
news about men, women and love was not all gloomy.

Ortega, opposition begin dialogue
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — President Daniel Ortega in
augurated a dialogue yesterday with political opposition groups
under terms of the Central American peace plan, as U.S.
diplomats said the embassy here is adopting a new activism in
support of that opposition.
Ortega, the only speaker at the opening ceremonies, asked the
12 opposition groups that attended, ranging from ultra
conservative to Marxist-Leninist, to limit the discussions to
how best to carry out the peace accord.
Signed Aug. 7 in Guatemala by the five Central American
presidents, the plan obliges Nicaragua to end a five-year-old
state of emergency and facilitate political pluralism.
Ortega called on the participants to "put aside our philosophi
cal and ideological positions" and "not to use the dialogue to
provoke a confrontation among party positions." Opposition
leaders said they will raise broad issues, such as the separation
of the ruling Sandinista party from the state and the Army.
Two previous attempts at dialogue since October, 1984 ended
in failure.
Friction over procedural details remained and the substantive
talks will not begin until Thursday, Sandinista officials said. Or
