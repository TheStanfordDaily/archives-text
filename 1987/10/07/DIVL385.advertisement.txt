We know that a
cheap calculator can
cost you blood, sweat
and time.
Investing in a
Hewlett-Packard cal
culator, on the other
hand, can save you
time and again.
HP calculators not
only have better func
tions. They function
better. Without stick
ing keys and bad
connections.
Through October
31, you can get the
cream of the calcula
tors at a non-fat price.
We're cutting $10
off the HP-12C. That
buys you more built
in functions than any
one else's financial
calculator.
And we're giving
away a free Advantage
Module, a $49 value,
with every HP-41
Advanced Scientific
calculator you buy.
This 12K-byte plug
in, menu-driven ROM
was designed spe
cially for students.
So drop by your
campus bookstore and
compare HP calcula
tors with the rest. By
midterm, you'll see
what a deal this is.
