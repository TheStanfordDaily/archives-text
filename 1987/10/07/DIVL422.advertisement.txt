NOTE-TA^^^^^j
Whatever the assignment, Pilot has the formula
JOBWr for writing comfort and precision.
Pilot's Better Ball Point Pen, in medium and fine points,
'" lets you breeze through long note-taking sessions. In fact,
we've made writer's fatigue a thing of the past! This crystal barreled
veteran of the campus has a ribbed finger grip for continuous comfort
and is perfectly balanced for effortless writing. Best of all, you'll never
throw it out because it's refillable.
The perfect teammate to the Better Ball Point
Pen is Pilot's Penciler 0.5 mm mechanical pencil. It
has a continuous lead feed system and a cushion tip
that helps eliminate the frustration of lead breakage.
The Pencilier's jumbo eraser does the job cleanly
S while the ribbed grip offers the same comfort as the
Better Ball Point Pen.
