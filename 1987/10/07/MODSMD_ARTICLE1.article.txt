# Scholars seek end to Pacific tensions
## 
### Susan McKean 
A joint team of American and
Soviet scholars concluded a
week of meetings here Monday
by proposing a program to
reduce tensions and improve se
curity in the Asian-Pacific
region.
In a statement released here
and at the Soviet Embassy in
Washington, D.C., John W.
Lewis, director of the Interna
tional Strategic Institute, and
Mikhail Titarenko, director of
the Institute of Far Eastern
Studies of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, introduced a plan call
ing for the eventual reduction of
conflict and promoting con
structive relations in the Asian-
Pacific area.
The "Program for Strength
ening Security and Reducing the
Risk of War in the Asian-Pacific
Region" resulted from two years
of work by Soviet and American
scholars exploring new paths
towards peace and cooperation
in the region.
While the plan was proposed
by academics rather than
politicians or diplomats, Lewis
said that both the Soviet and
American governments are "in
terested" in the plan.
In releasing the program, the
directors of the two institutes
said their purpose is to bring the
recommendations to the atten
tion of scholars and
policymakers in the Soviet Un
ion, the United States and
countries in the Asian-Pacific
region.
They have asked leaders and
policymakers in these countries
to join them "in trying to im
prove the concepts and proposals
embodied in the document and
working to realize its aims."
The core of the proposal
recommends "confidence
building measures," which, ac
cording to Lewis, "would
prepare the way for future agree
ments."
While "confidence-building
measures" are not arms control
argreements, they introduce a
climate of cooperation in the area
and are vital to furthering
broader negotiation, Lewis said.
Similar measures were also
developed for Europe at the
Stockholm Disarmament Confer
ence of 1985, which succesfully
paved the way for the recent
agreement on medium-range
missiles there.
Some of the measures success
fully employed in Europe which
could be applied to the Asian-
Pacific area include:
• advance notification of im
pending military exercises;
• use of on-site inspections;
• communication of information
on future military activities and;
• halting of military exercises
used solely for intimidation.
However, the Asian-Pacific
plan proposes a process of estab

lishing constructive relations in
the region that is different from
the multi-lateral regionwide con
ference format used in Stock
holm.
Instead, it encourages inter
ested states to "contact prospec
tive negotiating partners through
diplomatic channels to inquire
about the possibility of negotiat
ing a program of confidence
building measures . . . the
timing, participation and location
of subsequent talks would be a
matter for the parties directly in
volved to settle. The substance
of any negotiations also would be
in the hands exclusively of the
parties directly involved."
Lewis noted that the more
fragmented, volatile environment
of the Asian-Pacific region
coupled with an unproven record
of negotiation among the states
necessitate a different, more indi
vidualized format.
Lewis will be traveling to
North and South Korea in two
weeks to present the proposal to
regional leaders and offer the
suggestions outlined in the pro
gram.
For the past four years, he has
worked with Chinese, Japanese,
Soviet and Korean scholars as
Director of the Stanford-based
project on Peace and Coopera
tion in the Asian-Pacific Region,
part of the International Strategic
Institute at Stanford.
