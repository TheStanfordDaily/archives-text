# Sen. committee says no to Bork
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — In a historic move, the
Senate Judiciary Committee recommended
yesterday, by a vote of 9-5, that the Senate
reject the Supreme Court nomination of
Judge Robert Bork. The blow was sharpened
for the White House by the opposition of an
influential Southern conservative, Sen.
Howell Heflin (D-Ala.).
The panel's negative vote, only the second
such vote in this century, dealt a severe blow
to Bork's chance of confirmation. Tom
Korologos, the chief Republican lobbyist, de
scribed Bork's prospects after the action as
"a long shot."
"A lot of them will follow Heflin,"
Korologos said, referring to other Southern
Democrats and specifically mentioning Sens.
Sam Nunn of Georgia and Richard Shelby of
Alabama. "You start losing (votes) and
pretty soon you run out of undecideds," he
said.
President Reagan continued to insist that
he would press on with the nomination, but
his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said that
the White House was disappointed by the
vote, adding, "It's tough, there's no doubt
about it."
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the minority
leader, said Bork told him after the vote that
he "wanted us to continue to look at the op
tions" and promised to get back to Dole
today. Dole, in an interview with NBC News,
said Bork shares his assessment that "it
looks pretty grim" but that he "hasn't
crossed (the) bridge" of withdrawing.

If the nomination is not withdrawn, debate
in the Senate probably would begin late next
week.
The setback from Heflin's decision, an
nounced as the committee prepared to vote,
came after Sen. Robert Stafford of Vermont
became the fifth Republican to oppose Bork.
The White House drive to win confirmation
in the Democrat-controlled Senate has
depended on keeping Republicans from
breaking ranks and winning over Democratic
conservatives.
The private tallies of the administration's
own vote counters now show a majority of
the Senate likely to vote against Bork.
Stafford, declaring that he regrets voting
for the first time against a presidential
nominee, said, "At this time in our history,
the American people look for a uniting force,
not one that stirs fear and apprehension.
Judge Bork's nomination comes at the wrong
time for the wrong place."
The other Republicans who have declared
opposition to Bork include Sens. Alien Spec
ter of Pennsylvania, the only Republican on
the Judiciary Committee to vote against him,
Bob Pack wood of Oregon, John Chafee of
Rhode Island and Lowell Weicker Jr. of Con
necticut.
Bork's defeat in committee was not unex
pected. Except for Heflin, all of those on the
14-member panel had declared their positions
earlier.
The committee voted in the historic
Caucus Room, where the panel had con

ducted three weeks of hearings on the nomi
nation, with a capacity audience pressing
against the marble columns that give the
chamber distinction.
Heflin, in voting against Bork, said he was
in a "quandary as to whether this nominee
would be a conservative justice who would
safeguard the living Constitution and prevent
judicial activism or ... an extremist who
would use his position on the Court to ad
vance a far-right, radical judicial agenda.
Heflin, chief justice of the Alabama Su
preme Court before he joined the Senate, said
he was following "an old saying: 'When in
doubt, don't.' ... A lifetime position on the
Supreme Court is too important to risk to a
person who has continued to exhibit — and
may still possess — a proclivity for ex
tremism in spite of confirmation protesta
tions."
He said he found Bork's "life and lifestyle
indicates a fondness for the unusual, the un
conventional and the strange."
Heflin noted that as a young man, Bork had
been a socialist, that "he gave considerable
attention to becoming a Marxist," then
returned to socialism, after which he moved
to libertarianism. As Bork grew older, he
became a "New Deal liberal," then a "strict
constructionist" law professor, Heflin said.
"It now appears from his oral declarations at
these hearings that he has turned another cor
ner and is moving back toward the center."

Heflin, in voting against Bork, said he was
in a "quandary as to whether this nominee
would be a conservative justice who would
safeguard the living Constitution and prevent
judicial activism or ... an extremist who
would use his position on the Court to ad
vance a far-right, radical judicial agenda.
Heflin, chief justice of the Alabama Su
preme Court before he joined the Senate, said
he was following "an old saying: 'When in
doubt, don't.' ... A lifetime position on the
Supreme Court is too important to risk to a
person who has continued to exhibit — and
may still possess — a proclivity for ex
tremism in spite of confirmation protesta
tions."
He said he found Bork's "life and lifestyle
indicates a fondness for the unusual, the un
conventional and the strange."
Heflin noted that as a young man, Bork had
been a socialist, that "he gave considerable
attention to becoming a Marxist," then
returned to socialism, after which he moved
to libertarianism. As Bork grew older, he
became a "New Deal liberal," then a "strict
constructionist" law professor, Heflin said.
"It now appears from his oral declarations at
these hearings that he has turned another cor
ner and is moving back toward the center."

WASHINGTON — In a historic move, the
Senate Judiciary Committee recommended
yesterday, by a vote of 9-5, that the Senate
reject the Supreme Court nomination of
Judge Robert Bork. The blow was sharpened
for the White House by the opposition of an
influential Southern conservative, Sen.
Howell Heflin (D-Ala.).
The panel's negative vote, only the second
such vote in this century, dealt a severe blow
to Bork's chance of confirmation. Tom
Korologos, the chief Republican lobbyist, de
scribed Bork's prospects after the action as
"a long shot."
"A lot of them will follow Heflin,"
Korologos said, referring to other Southern
Democrats and specifically mentioning Sens.
Sam Nunn of Georgia and Richard Shelby of
Alabama. "You start losing (votes) and
pretty soon you run out of undecideds," he
said.
President Reagan continued to insist that
he would press on with the nomination, but
his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said that
the White House was disappointed by the
vote, adding, "It's tough, there's no doubt
about it."
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the minority
leader, said Bork told him after the vote that
he "wanted us to continue to look at the op
tions" and promised to get back to Dole
today. Dole, in an interview with NBC News,
said Bork shares his assessment that "it
looks pretty grim" but that he "hasn't
crossed (the) bridge" of withdrawing.

If the nomination is not withdrawn, debate
in the Senate probably would begin late next
week.
The setback from Heflin's decision, an
nounced as the committee prepared to vote,
came after Sen. Robert Stafford of Vermont
became the fifth Republican to oppose Bork.
The White House drive to win confirmation
in the Democrat-controlled Senate has
depended on keeping Republicans from
breaking ranks and winning over Democratic
conservatives.
The private tallies of the administration's
own vote counters now show a majority of
the Senate likely to vote against Bork.
Stafford, declaring that he regrets voting
for the first time against a presidential
nominee, said, "At this time in our history,
the American people look for a uniting force,
not one that stirs fear and apprehension.
Judge Bork's nomination comes at the wrong
time for the wrong place."
The other Republicans who have declared
opposition to Bork include Sens. Alien Spec
ter of Pennsylvania, the only Republican on
the Judiciary Committee to vote against him,
Bob Pack wood of Oregon, John Chafee of
Rhode Island and Lowell Weicker Jr. of Con
necticut.
Bork's defeat in committee was not unex
pected. Except for Heflin, all of those on the
14-member panel had declared their positions
earlier.
The committee voted in the historic
Caucus Room, where the panel had con

ducted three weeks of hearings on the nomi
nation, with a capacity audience pressing
against the marble columns that give the
chamber distinction.
Heflin, in voting against Bork, said he was
in a "quandary as to whether this nominee
would be a conservative justice who would
safeguard the living Constitution and prevent
judicial activism or ... an extremist who
would use his position on the Court to ad
vance a far-right, radical judicial agenda.
