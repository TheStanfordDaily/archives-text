# Stock market plunges 91 points
## 
### 
Fears of rising interest rates
and pessimistic forecasts by
some leading market analysts
prompted a major sell-off in the
stock market yesterday, with the
Dow Jones average of 30 indus
trial stocks falling 91.55 points,
its biggest one-day point drop
ever.
The fall in the Dow, to a close
of 2548.63, was yet another indi
cation of how investor uncer
tainty has triggered sharp point
swings in that key market index.
Investors appear to be increas
ingly fickle, alternating between
fears of an impending bear mar
ket and optimism that the five

year-old bull market still has a lot
of life left.
Only two weeks ago, on Sept.
22, the Dow set an all-time
record for a single-day gain,
soaring 75.23 points amid op
timism that interest rates might
not rise as much as had been
feared.
"It's late in the (bull market),
and a lot of people are very ner
vous," Michael Metz, market
strategist at the Wall Street firm
of Oppenheimer & Co., said in
explaining Yesterday's decline.
The 91.55-point fall surpassed
the previous record single-day

decline of 86.61 points, set Sept.
11, 1986. Then, as was the case
Yesterday, the sell-off was fueled
by bad news on interest rates and
by computer-driven stock-selling
programs initiated by big institu
tional investors.
But on a percentage basis, the
Dow fell only 3.47 percent on
Yesterday, less than the 4.61 per
cent drop on Sept. 11 last year
and far less than the record 12.82
percent decline on Oct. 28, 1929.
That 38.33-point drop in the
Dow, to a close of 260.64,
marked the beginning of the
Great Depression.
Yesterday's sell-off was

sparked in part by falling bond
prices early in the day, driven
down by investor fears that the
Federal Reserve Board would
tighten credit and raise interest
rates. Bond prices fall when in
terest rates rise.
The decline also was triggered
by concerns that recent sharp
rises in bond yields would
prompt institutional investors to
switch money out of stocks into
bonds, analyst Metz said. Yields
on four-year Treasury notes rose
Yesterday to the highest level in
two years, attracting vigorous
buying.
