# Dean Fred set to speak
## 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
Dean Fred is coming back —
but just for one night.
Fred Hargadon, the former
dean of undergraduate admis
sions who became a legend
during his 15 years here, will
address the class of 1988 — the
last class he admitted to Stan
ford — Saturday night as the
featured event in an all-day
senior celebration.
"Dean Fred never had a
chance to speak to our class as
a group," said Keith Yama
shita, one of the senior class
presidents, the four-member
group that organized the
events. "We feel he's so much
a part of what makes our class
special. It's the perfect way for
us as a class to start the year
off."

Hargadon, now senior vice
president for administration at
the College Board in Princeton,
N.J., said yesterday that he
planned to use the speech to
explore what seniors can ac
complish in their last seven
months at Stanford.
"It's always great to come
back," Hargadon said. "I wish
it were a week following some
thing other than a 49-zip
(football game) score. But it
will be a great chance to meet
with some of the members of
the class."
Hargadon's return will fit
neatly into a slate of activities
the presidents have planned for
this year in order to promote
class unity, the presidents said.
"He is an inspiration to the
class of '88, and this program is
another way for the class to be
together," said Stacey Estrella,

one of the senior class presi
dents. "It's a way to have class
unity. Come June, we won t
have that opportunity any
more."
Hargadon's speech will cap a
slate of presentations beginning
at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium. Other events in
clude a performance by the
Stanford Choir, and speeches
by English Prof. Robert Pol
hemus, new Dean of Under
graduate Studies Thomas
Wasow and KGO-TV reporter
Laura Coverson, a member of
the class of 1976.
The presidents also plan a
"Disorientation" festival ear
lier in the day on the intramural
fields near Maples Pavilion.
"It'll be like Orientation, ex
cept you'll know more peo
ple," said Liz Marks, one of
the presidents.
