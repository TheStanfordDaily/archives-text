# Stanford shows commitment to public service
## Nearly 70 groups participate in 4th annual Service Faire 
### Burke Smith 
Sixty-five to 70 non-profit
community service organizations
participated in yesterday's fourth
annual Community Service Faire
in White Plaza. Although 10 to 15
organizations failed to attend as
scheduled, organizer Patricia
Barrera characterized the event,
which was organized by the Stan
ford Volunteer Network and the
Public Service Center, as a suc
cess.
Barrera said the no-show or
ganizations were predominantly
from San Francisco and probably
decided the distance was too
great to travel. But the turnout of
agencies was still twice that of
last year's faire.
The one-day event is designed
primarily to allow students to
take advantage of the wealth of
.comruuiuty service opportunities
fin the Stanford and Palo Alto
| areas.
According to Barrera, another
goal of the event is to open stu
dents' minds to the need in soci
ety for public service and the
reasons behind that need.
Represented agencies ranged
from social service organizations
that work with disadvantaged

young people to environmental
groups. Any non-profit group
that expressed an interest was
invited to attend the faire.
Agency representatives were
very positive about the reception
given them by Stanford students,
Barrera said. Many groups, par
ticularly those working in the
nearby community, depend on
Stanford students for as much as
a third of their volunteer forces.
A representative from Hidden
Villa, an environmental and so
cial service group, said Stanford
students are, on the whole,
"very serious and hardwork
ing."
Students surveying the booths
seemed glad to have an opportu
nity to become involved in volun
teer work. "Too often as stu
dents we become wrapped up in
our own little world. This type of
community work allows us to
change that," junior Anita Car
lucci said.
When asked why the faire was
important to Stanford, both stu
dents and organization represen
tatives echoed Barrera's senti
ments. "Volunteer work is im
portant, because it makes stu
dents examine important issues
more deeply," she said.
