### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
"I really want to thank all of
you," said University President
Donald Kennedy to a crowd of
about 75 students gathered yes
terday at Owen House, Stan
ford's Public Service Center.
"This entire great venture, this
whole idea, runs on the fuel of
student enthusiasm," he added.
The Stanford Public Service
Center has its roots in a 1983
Commencement speech by Ken
nedy, in which he said Stanford
students have a definite responsi
bility to serve their communities.
Later that year, Kennedy com
missioned Special Assistant to
the President Catherine Milton to
complete a study on opportuni
ties for public service at Stan
ford.
Milton's work resulted in the
establishment of the Public Ser
vice Center, which she was then
assigned to direct. "The idea was
to get a lot more students in
volved.' Milton said yesterday.
According to statistics
compiled by the center, the num
ber of student volunteers for
Reach Out Today, an annual day
of community work, has risen by
about 200 participants each year
since its inception in 1984.
Over the last two years, the

number of Stanford students ser
ving in the Peace Corps and Vol
unteers in Asia has nearly
tripled. And the number of Stan
ford graduates planning to teach
at public schools has quadrupled.

\ . . this entire
great venture, this
whole idea, runs on
the fuel of student
enthusiasm.'

This year, Milton said the
number will likely increase again.
"Right now, we feel a lot of mo
mentum and a lot of enthusiasm
on the part of the students," she
said. "It's still too early to have
any numbers on student partici
pation. but everything looks
good so far."
Projects at the Center this year
will include food drives, tutoring
projects in East Palo Alto, sum
mer fellowships for students in
terested in public service, and
the Stanford-in-Government pro
gram for internships in both
Sacramento and Washington,
D C. The Center will also
administer the new Stanford-in-
Washington program.
