They came to their senses â€” and it didn't take
long for them to do it.
The School of Humanities and Sciences has
reversed a Music Department funding cut that
forced the department to all but eliminate begin
ning music lessons for non-majors.
The cut would have meant that students eager
to add an element of music to their education
would have been faced with a department offer
ing no beginning piano classes, no beginning
classical guitar classes and only a limited num
ber of beginning flute classes.
At first glance, such cuts might seem minor,
but they would in fact reflect a major inconsis
tency between the stated goals of undergraduate
education at Stanford and efforts to achieve
those goals. Stanford officials say that the Uni
versity seeks to provide students with a liberal
education characterized by a breadth, as well as

depth, of learning.
Music, along with the other fine arts, must, by
anyone's standard, be considered an essential
part of a broad-based education. Already, the
fine arts at Stanford are sorely lacking. The
Music Department's decision was one that
would have undermined the University's goal of
providing students with a liberal education.
In a university that seeks to provide a liberal
education, students should be encouraged to
develop every facet of their potential talent. The
elimination of music classes for non-majors is an
action clearly contrary to that goal.
Congratulations to the School of Humanities
and Science for moving to provide funding from
its discretionary reserve, and to the Provost's
Office, which is currently helping to bring the
Music Department's budget up to last year's
level.
