## Bible groups alienate 
### 
At the beginning of every year, whether we are
aware of it or not, social patterns form in the
dorms, and these social patterns help shape the
identity of a dorm for the rest of the year. Small de
cisions being made now will have lasting repercus
sions on the social and spiritual well-being of every
member of each dorm.
There is, however, one rarely discussed decision
that deserves attention. Because of its potential to
divide a community, dorms should consider care
fully the impact of a decision to host a Bible study
group.

Bible study is an activity in which a group of
Christians from a particular denomination — often
quite religious — meet in a dorm once a week to
discuss the Bible and confirm their faith. These
groups usually meet in the lounge of a dorm with
the dorm's permission, or if unsanctioned by the
dorm they meet in the privacy of a room of an indi
vidual member of the dorm.
However, it is my experience that no matter how
private a Bible study — or for that matter how
public — the results are always negative. Bible
studies only serve to create strains of isolation and
religious competitiveness or closemindedness that
will eventually undermine the solidarity of any
dorm.
First of all, I must explain that I'm not anti
religious. I am a practicing Jew, with an amorphous
but definite belief in a God. I attend synagogue and
celebrate most of the Jewish holidays. I say this to
establish that I understand the need to be linked to
a tradition, that there is security in religion and that
it is not my goal through manipulation to deprive
Stanford students of their spiritual sustenance.
However, I firmly believe that the dorms are no
place for organized religion.
To discuss religion, especially with those who
share different views than your own, is undoubt
edly a worthwhile activity for a dorm: it is part of a
growth and learning process. Religious discussion,
debate and comparison should all take place within

dorms. However, if a group of people feels the
need to join together to affirm their beliefs, to pray,
to take solace in each other's company, they
should move out of the dorms.
First, there is the question of comfort in the dorm
— and to some small extent we are responsible for
not making other members of our dorm uncomfort
able. In most cases, all members of the host dorm
are invited to participate in the Bible study if they
wish. But for people who are not Christian, being
told or encouraged to attend a Bible study can be ir
ritating and even insulting. Moreover, for those
non-Christians who attend, the results are even
worse.
Bible studies alienate people of other faiths be
cause, unlike a discussion where members of non-
Christian faiths may participate and be respected,
during Bible studies the Christian faith is confirmed
and extolled in its righteousness.
Secondly, Bible studies often become the center
of a subtle religious hierarchy. Good Christians at
tend the sessions regularly, but better Christians at
tend more. Christians who do not attend feel subtle
pressure to do so — or so my friends tell me — or
else, with absence, their own form of religion is not
taken seriously by other Christians in the dorm.
Finally, there is also the question of dorm reputa
tion and atmosphere. The religious nature of the Bi
ble study meetings creates an inhibiting atmos
phere for other dorm members.
Furthermore, dorms with Bible studies get a rep
utation on campus as being "religious dorms." My
sophomore dorm had such a pervasive reputation
around campus as a religious dorm that we held a
house meeting to discuss it. During the meeting
someone asked, "So what's wrong if we're known
as being The Christian Dorm'?" The answer is that
in a dorm not everyone is religious and not every
one is Christian.
Moving out of the dorms is not a problem. There
are places outside the dorms where Bible study
groups can meet. Now is the time that dorms must
make conscious decisions and take responsibility
for their long-term well-being. Bible studies will
best meet the needs of the students they serve and
least offend everyone else if they are outside the
dorms.
