Hot football
games require
cool refreshment
I do not wish to enter into a
debate over underage drinking
and Stanford's alcohol policy. I
would, however, like to raise an
issue regarding consumption of
alcohol at football games and any
University plans to forbid that
activity.
Unlike many of the univer
sities which are being touted as
precedents for the dry stadium
issue, Stanford is located in an
extremely hot and dry climate.
Spectators at those other univer
sities are likely to suffer numb
toes and runny noses; Stanford
fans frequently suffer sunburns,
heat exhaustion and even
heatstroke. That is a real prob
lem.
If the human body wants to
survive a Stanford football game
— four hours in the intense Cali
fornia sun — it needs fluids to
cool and rehydrate it. Debate will
rage on the appropriateness and
legality of some of the beverages
chosen for this purpose, but it is
a fact that some type of liquid

refreshment is necessary.
The University should under
stand this before it implements
any new policies at Stanford
Stadium. Any scheme which
hopes to be enforceable and
respected must forbid all bever
age containers — cans, bottles,
coolers, thermoses, wine skins.
Stanford students will certainly
find ways to abuse anything less
than a total exclusion policy and
thereby make it ineffectual and a
mockery.
But such a policy would neces
sarily prevent more "legitimate"
beverages — water, soda, fruit
drinks, etc. — from being
consumed, and that absence of li
quids could be very dangerous.
Yes, beverages can be purchased
from concession stands, but it is
the concessionaires' outrageous
prices and long lines which force
people to bring their own drinks;
they cannot be called upon'to al
leviate this problem.
I do not have a solution to the
problems at Stanford Stadium. I
would just like the University to
realize that reactionary and ill
considered measures may cause
more illness and injury than they
prevent.

The funniest thing happened to
me on the way to my 1:15 class. I
was giving a bikeless friend a ride
so he would not be late to his
chemistry class, and all I
received in return was a ticket for
breaking the law.
Officially I was written up for a
21200a-22450 (failure to stop at a
stop sign), but the sheriff could
have also cited me for the posses
sion of an extra passenger and
riding with an unregistered
bicycle. He chose to give a ticket
to me rather than the 500 or so
other people who "neglected" to
stop at the same sign, because I
was driving recklessly (i.e. giving
my friend a ride). I thanked the
officer for his generosity, and I
actually felt thankful that he plea
bargained on my behalf.
I broke the law, so I apparently
have no recourse. However, I
believe that I (and others who
received similar tickets) were
treated unfairly. Most Stanford
residents have not been ac
customed to strict enforcement
of bicycle laws. Last year, I rode
through many stop signs, often
carried a second passenger and
went without a bike registration
while never once hearing I was in

violation of school policy. Then
the first day of my sophomore
year I receive a ticket for this
"irresponsible" and illegal be
havior.
Due to the circumstances, a
30-day grace period would have
been appropriate to allow com
munity residents an opportunity
to foster new bike-riding habits.
After a month of verbal warnings
from police and sheriff patrols,
occasional newspaper coverage
and word-of-mouth, most Stan
ford "regulars" would have the
chance to decide whether they
wish to obey the rules or risk
violating the law.
I admire the University's ef
forts to cut down on the alarming
number of injurious bike acci
dents at Stanford. Strict enforce
ment of bicycle laws to ensure
bicyclists' own safety may pos
sibly be the solution. However,
in an attempt to ensure my safety

lated my right to fair and just
treatment.

laws uniformly
The funniest thing happened to
me on the way to my 1:15 class. I
was giving a bikeless friend a ride
so he would not be late to his
chemistry class, and all I
received in return was a ticket for
breaking the law.
Officially I was written up for a
21200a-22450 (failure to stop at a
stop sign), but the sheriff could
have also cited me for the posses
sion of an extra passenger and
riding with an unregistered
bicycle. He chose to give a ticket
to me rather than the 500 or so
other people who "neglected" to
stop at the same sign, because I
was driving recklessly (i.e. giving
my friend a ride). I thanked the
officer for his generosity, and I
actually felt thankful that he plea
bargained on my behalf.
I broke the law, so I apparently
have no recourse. However, I
believe that I (and others who
received similar tickets) were
treated unfairly. Most Stanford
residents have not been ac
customed to strict enforcement
of bicycle laws. Last year, I rode
through many stop signs, often
carried a second passenger and
went without a bike registration
while never once hearing I was in

violation of school policy. Then
the first day of my sophomore
year I receive a ticket for this
"irresponsible" and illegal be
havior.
Due to the circumstances, a
30-day grace period would have
been appropriate to allow com
munity residents an opportunity
to foster new bike-riding habits.
After a month of verbal warnings
from police and sheriff patrols,
occasional newspaper coverage
and word-of-mouth, most Stan
ford "regulars" would have the
chance to decide whether they
wish to obey the rules or risk
violating the law.
I admire the University's ef
forts to cut down on the alarming
number of injurious bike acci
dents at Stanford. Strict enforce
ment of bicycle laws to ensure
bicyclists' own safety may pos
sibly be the solution. However,
in an attempt to ensure my safety
1 believe the University has vio
lated my right to fair and just
treatment.

Hot football
games require
cool refreshment
I do not wish to enter into a
debate over underage drinking
and Stanford's alcohol policy. I
would, however, like to raise an
issue regarding consumption of
alcohol at football games and any
University plans to forbid that
activity.
Unlike many of the univer
sities which are being touted as
precedents for the dry stadium
issue, Stanford is located in an
extremely hot and dry climate.
Spectators at those other univer
sities are likely to suffer numb
toes and runny noses; Stanford
fans frequently suffer sunburns,
heat exhaustion and even
heatstroke. That is a real prob
lem.
If the human body wants to
survive a Stanford football game
— four hours in the intense Cali
fornia sun — it needs fluids to
cool and rehydrate it. Debate will
rage on the appropriateness and
legality of some of the beverages
chosen for this purpose, but it is
a fact that some type of liquid

refreshment is necessary.
The University should under
stand this before it implements
any new policies at Stanford
Stadium. Any scheme which
hopes to be enforceable and
respected must forbid all bever
age containers — cans, bottles,
coolers, thermoses, wine skins.
Stanford students will certainly
find ways to abuse anything less
than a total exclusion policy and
thereby make it ineffectual and a
mockery.
But such a policy would neces
sarily prevent more "legitimate"
beverages — water, soda, fruit
drinks, etc. — from being
consumed, and that absence of li
quids could be very dangerous.
Yes, beverages can be purchased
from concession stands, but it is
the concessionaires' outrageous
prices and long lines which force
people to bring their own drinks;
they cannot be called upon'to al
leviate this problem.
I do not have a solution to the
problems at Stanford Stadium. I
would just like the University to
realize that reactionary and ill
considered measures may cause
more illness and injury than they
prevent.
