# A 						fowl fling with death
## 
### 
Now that most of this year's "Hi, my name is
. . . business is over, I have one suggestion.
Quite frankly, only a highly trained eye can learn
anything about people when they're forced to
describe themselves in terms like where they're
from, what they're majoring in and a few brief
nowhere sentences that invariably end with a dead.
Novocain smile and perhaps a giggle. You've seen
it, too, and if it doesn't bother you, you've been
doing it yourself for too long.

1 think the rules should change. What if people
customarily had to introduce themselves with a
brief anecdote from their lives? Something stupid
or interesting has happened to everyone at one time
or another. One could make something up if neces
sary. Even vulgar lies are more fun to listen to than
"I'm a senior and live in Burbank," and they're
much more memorable.
Wouldn't you rather be remembered as "the guy
whose date laughed so hard she wet her dress at the
prom," or "the woman with a scar she got from a
boating accident, which is curiously shaped like
Africa?"
I would. Those stories are much more telling
than the superficial characteristics that suddenly
become so tremendously important when someone
approaches us with his or her hand stretched out.
In fact, that's what I'll do right now. You have
absolutely no clue who the hell I am, so I'll give
you some idea by telling you a story from my past.
I'll even up the stakes, by recounting a monumen
tal event that has a direct bearing on my current ex
istence: my first encounter with death. My own
death. (Some sort of ominous soundtrack music
should throb in your mind right now.)
It was spring some three- and-a-half years ago,
and I was a content high school senior who had
decided to respond to Stanford's thick envelope
above the others. A familiar story so far. To cele
brate, my family had turkey for dinner one night. In
April. Somehow the two don't mesh comfortably in
my mind, either, but we had a very large turkey for
dinner— kind of a mock Thanksgiving.
The next day, 1 drove home from my high school
at noon to fix myself a lunch and to let the dog out.
Whether I was allowed to leave campus or not was
unimportant to me; it was spring, I'd been accepted
to Stanford, and life was good.
Well, I was alone in the house. I opened our
sliding glass door, let out our yellow lab and went
into the kitchen. The turkey sat menacingly on the
platter in our refrigerator, looking like a dismem
bered burn victim. (To think, I could have just
eaten a couple of Popsicles instead, and this would
be the end of the story.) I carved off some slivers of
white meat, put them on bread and headed for the

living room with the sandwich and a glass of milk.
I clicked on the TV, and"The Andy Griffith
Show" was whistling cheerfully away. I am con
vinced it comes on weekdays at noon everywhere
in the universe. Anyway, I ate my sandwich and
drank my milk in front of the tube, glancing through
the back door on occasion to make sure the dog
wasn't drinking stagnant water or eating a bush.
To this day I can't remember what the joke was,
but Aunt Bea or Don Knotts did something so in
credibly stupid that I started to laugh. I had just
taken a large bite of the sandwich. Because the
urge to laugh had hit me so quickly, I gasped with
out swallowing first and sent a chunk of the dry
white meat right down my windpipe.
For a split second, while 1 could still hear the
laugh track from the television program, I felt like
laughing even harder. Yes, I was about to become
the first human being in the world to fall victim to
"The Andy Griffith Show." The papers would read
"Local honor student chokes watching 'Andy Grif
fith Show," I was being murdered by Aunt Bea.
Then 1 was terrified. No one was around, and I
was having difficulty talking. "Can you speak?" I
asked myself in my head. I tried to say something
but could only wheeze. I threw the sandwich
against the wall and kicked over the glass of milk
onto our shag carpet. What dramatic gestures. At
any rate, the dog came running heroically through
the open back door, and she could sense something
was wrong. 1 was wheezing at her and rolling
around in the spilt milk, trying to give myself the
Heimlich maneuver.
"You're going to die," I thought. "The last thing
you're ever going to see is Don Knotts mugging at
you. Your parents are going to come home from
work and find you blue, sprawled out on the floor,
with cartoons playing over your dead body."
The dog stared at me and shook nervously. This
wasn't a game. I got up off the rug when I remem
bered that one can do the maneuver over the back
of a chair if no one else is nearby. I looked franti
cally around the room and saw our La-Z-Boy
recliner in the corner. The top of the chair was way
too high to fit under my ribs, and even in my
panicked state, I knew that I'd only spring out the
reclining mechanism. So I knelt down and dropped
myself onto one of the chair's arms again and
again. I even kicked over the floor lamp next to it.
1 doubt that these antics had anything to do with
the piece of turkey getting dislodged, but somehow
it was freed from my throat. I was so happy that I
was going to live that I wept. I turned off the TV,
curled up on the floor and crawled into the kitchen,
where I called my mom at work and asked her to
telephone the high school for me. I wouldn't be
going back today. 1 had had my first serious
encounter with death, and 1 wasn't interested in sit
ting through English and civics class.
It was good to meet you. Or good to meet me.

above the others. A familiar story so far. To cele
brate, my family had turkey for dinner one night. In
April. Somehow the two don't mesh comfortably in
my mind, either, but we had a very large turkey for
dinner— kind of a mock Thanksgiving.
The next day, 1 drove home from my high school
at noon to fix myself a lunch and to let the dog out.
Whether I was allowed to leave campus or not was
unimportant to me; it was spring, I'd been accepted
to Stanford, and life was good.
Well, I was alone in the house. I opened our
sliding glass door, let out our yellow lab and went
into the kitchen. The turkey sat menacingly on the
platter in our refrigerator, looking like a dismem
bered burn victim. (To think, I could have just
eaten a couple of Popsicles instead, and this would
be the end of the story.) I carved off some slivers of
white meat, put them on bread and headed for the

living room with the sandwich and a glass of milk.
I clicked on the TV, and"The Andy Griffith
Show" was whistling cheerfully away. I am con
vinced it comes on weekdays at noon everywhere
in the universe. Anyway, I ate my sandwich and
drank my milk in front of the tube, glancing through
the back door on occasion to make sure the dog
wasn't drinking stagnant water or eating a bush.
To this day I can't remember what the joke was,
but Aunt Bea or Don Knotts did something so in
credibly stupid that I started to laugh. I had just
taken a large bite of the sandwich. Because the
urge to laugh had hit me so quickly, I gasped with
out swallowing first and sent a chunk of the dry
white meat right down my windpipe.
For a split second, while 1 could still hear the
laugh track from the television program, I felt like
laughing even harder. Yes, I was about to become
the first human being in the world to fall victim to
"The Andy Griffith Show." The papers would read
"Local honor student chokes watching 'Andy Grif
fith Show," I was being murdered by Aunt Bea.
Then 1 was terrified. No one was around, and I
was having difficulty talking. "Can you speak?" I
asked myself in my head. I tried to say something
but could only wheeze. I threw the sandwich
against the wall and kicked over the glass of milk
onto our shag carpet. What dramatic gestures. At
any rate, the dog came running heroically through
the open back door, and she could sense something
was wrong. 1 was wheezing at her and rolling
around in the spilt milk, trying to give myself the
Heimlich maneuver.
"You're going to die," I thought. "The last thing
you're ever going to see is Don Knotts mugging at
you. Your parents are going to come home from
work and find you blue, sprawled out on the floor,
with cartoons playing over your dead body."
The dog stared at me and shook nervously. This
wasn't a game. I got up off the rug when I remem
bered that one can do the maneuver over the back
of a chair if no one else is nearby. I looked franti
cally around the room and saw our La-Z-Boy
recliner in the corner. The top of the chair was way
too high to fit under my ribs, and even in my
panicked state, I knew that I'd only spring out the
reclining mechanism. So I knelt down and dropped
myself onto one of the chair's arms again and
again. I even kicked over the floor lamp next to it.
1 doubt that these antics had anything to do with
the piece of turkey getting dislodged, but somehow
it was freed from my throat. I was so happy that I
was going to live that I wept. I turned off the TV,
curled up on the floor and crawled into the kitchen,
where I called my mom at work and asked her to
telephone the high school for me. I wouldn't be
going back today. 1 had had my first serious
encounter with death, and 1 wasn't interested in sit
ting through English and civics class.
It was good to meet you. Or good to meet me.

Now that most of this year's "Hi, my name is
. . . business is over, I have one suggestion.
Quite frankly, only a highly trained eye can learn
anything about people when they're forced to
describe themselves in terms like where they're
from, what they're majoring in and a few brief
nowhere sentences that invariably end with a dead.
Novocain smile and perhaps a giggle. You've seen
it, too, and if it doesn't bother you, you've been
doing it yourself for too long.

1 think the rules should change. What if people
customarily had to introduce themselves with a
brief anecdote from their lives? Something stupid
or interesting has happened to everyone at one time
or another. One could make something up if neces
sary. Even vulgar lies are more fun to listen to than
"I'm a senior and live in Burbank," and they're
much more memorable.
Wouldn't you rather be remembered as "the guy
whose date laughed so hard she wet her dress at the
prom," or "the woman with a scar she got from a
boating accident, which is curiously shaped like
Africa?"
I would. Those stories are much more telling
than the superficial characteristics that suddenly
become so tremendously important when someone
approaches us with his or her hand stretched out.
In fact, that's what I'll do right now. You have
absolutely no clue who the hell I am, so I'll give
you some idea by telling you a story from my past.
I'll even up the stakes, by recounting a monumen
tal event that has a direct bearing on my current ex
istence: my first encounter with death. My own
death. (Some sort of ominous soundtrack music
should throb in your mind right now.)
