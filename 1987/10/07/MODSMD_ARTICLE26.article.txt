## Student TA's role is vital 
### Lisa Brooks Staff writer 
Although the professor may be
the focus of attention in Stanford
classes, many students find that
it is the student assistant who ul
timately makes or breaks a class.
"Students feel more comforta
ble with TAs in discussion sec
tions", said Dr. Michele Marin
covich of the Center for Teaching
and Learning.
"They are closer to the under
graduate experience and can of
ten provide more help," she
added.
In addition, student assistants
are vital to research universities
like Stanford for financial
reasons. Without their aid, Stan
ford would have to hire more
professors to teach lower divi
sion classes and would be unable
to offer as many graduate level
courses.
There are three types of stu
dent appointments at Stanford;
all are given the general label of
TA.
The first is a teaching fellow,
or a matriculated graduate stu
dent who has full charge and re
sponsibility for a course. In most
cases one course per quarter in
volves 20 hours of work per week
and is considered a half-time ap
pointment.

Teaching assistants are
graduate students who are subor
dinate to the faculty members
teaching a course. Their primary
duty is to meet with class sec
tions, usually once or twice a
week.
Course assistants fall into the
third category of student appoin
tees and can be either graduates
or undergraduates, depending on

the department. These people
might lead review or problem
sections, assist faculty members
in preparing lectures, or grade
papers.
Requirements for each posi
tion vary from department to de
partment as do the numbers of
students involved in teaching.
