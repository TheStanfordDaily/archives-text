## Student TA's role is vital 
### Lisa Brooks Staff writer 
Although the professor may be
the focus of attention in Stanford
classes, many students find that
it is the student assistant who ul
timately makes or breaks a class.
"Students feel more comforta
ble with TAs in discussion sec
tions", said Dr. Michele Marin
covich of the Center for Teaching
and Learning.
"They are closer to the under
graduate experience and can of
ten provide more help," she
added.
In addition, student assistants
are vital to research universities
like Stanford for financial
reasons. Without their aid, Stan
ford would have to hire more
professors to teach lower divi
sion classes and would be unable
to offer as many graduate level
courses.
There are three types of stu
dent appointments at Stanford;
all are given the general label of
TA.
The first is a teaching fellow,
or a matriculated graduate stu
dent who has full charge and re
sponsibility for a course. In most
cases one course per quarter in
volves 20 hours of work per week
and is considered a half-time ap
pointment.

Teaching assistants are
graduate students who are subor
dinate to the faculty members
teaching a course. Their primary
duty is to meet with class sec
tions, usually once or twice a
week.
Course assistants fall into the
third category of student appoin
tees and can be either graduates
or undergraduates, depending on

the department. These people
might lead review or problem
sections, assist faculty members
in preparing lectures, or grade
papers.
Requirements for each posi
tion vary from department to de
partment as do the numbers of
students involved in teaching.

There are no readily available
statistics on how many student
assistants are at Stanford, hut
Marincovich estimated the num
ber to be around 900.
Most departments require
graduates to teach at least one
course during the time they
spend at Stanford.
"Almost all graduate students
TA at some point in this depart
ment," Mathematics Prof. Greg
Brumfiel said. "Out of the 12 stu
dents we accept every year, only
two or three in the period of a
few years might not teach for
various reasons,"
The situation is the same in
other departments. According to
Marincovich, many departments
have a teaching requirement and
students will be unable to obtain
a doctorate degree without teach
ing at least one course.
Student assistants are a
valuable resource to Stanford,
but problems can occur. One of
the biggest is the real and imag
ined communication barriers be
tween undergraduates and
foreign graduate students.
Stanford used to have many
problems in the past, but in 1982
a screening process was created
to separate graduates who speak
English well from those whose
use of the language is not fluent.
Now when a prospective
teaching fellow or teaching assis
tant has difficulties communica
ting, he is required to take a class

in English as a foreign language
before being allowed to teach a
class.
"This year alone, 150 people
were screened, and those who
passed will be allowed to teach
during the winter and spring
quarters," Marincovich said.
While a few years ago a stu
dent may have been rightfully
concerned about having a foreign
graduate student teaching his
class, Marincovich said that now
there is not as much reason for
concern.
Instead, she said, many of the
problems now stem from stu
dents holding preconceived, un
fair notions about foreign TAs.
Because of those attitudes, she
said, some students don't give
foreign graduate students a fair
chance to teach.
"Some students panic. It's
hard to know if there really is a
problem or if the students have
created it themselves," Marin
covich said.
Brumfiel agreed. "I think
Stanford freshmen need to give
teaching fellows a chance. It
takes some time to get used to an
accent, and very often students
get panicky when their teacher
doesn't speak like an Ameri
can," he said.
Being a teaching assistant can
be a difficult job, especially when
finals are in the immediate fu
ture. Still, those who do it find
the experience to have rewards
that go beyond the salary and ac
ademic credit they receive.
"I like it and think it's worth
the effort," said sophomore
Neela Bhakta in explaining why
she is a calculus course assistant.

"It's pretty cool when someone
who is struggling finally under
stands a concept because of your
help."
Fourth-year graduate student
Kathy O'Shaughnessy, one of
the two winners of the first Paul
Harmon Kirkpatrick award for
excellence in undergraduate
physics teaching, concurred.
O'Shaughnessy is in charge of
evaluating all physics TAs, and
she also helps out with some of
the first-year students.
"My job is to get people to
communicate with their stu
dents," she said.
"Sometimes we get someone
who has trouble communicating
with the class and I go in and see
what is happening before making
recommendations," O'Shaugh
nessy added.
Marincovich said that the only
trouble with the student assistant
program is that people do not
take enough advantage of the
TAs.
"There is a perception of a gulf
between graduates and under
graduates, and TAs alleviate this
problem," she said. "Students
could use their TAs to get to
know a scholar well or to get
their feet wet and see if they are
interested in academic life".
Student assistants are impor
tant to Stanford now, and Marin
covich believes that their teach
ing experience will be a tremen
dous asset to them in the future.
"Forty percent of Stanford
Ph.Ds plan to be faculty, and an
increasing number of colleges
want evidence that an applicant
knows how to teach before they
will hire him or her," she said.

Stanford used to have many
problems in the past, but in 1982
a screening process was created
to separate graduates who speak
English well from those whose
use of the language is not fluent.
Now when a prospective
teaching fellow or teaching assis
tant has difficulties communica
ting, he is required to take a class

in English as a foreign language
before being allowed to teach a
class.
"This year alone, 150 people
were screened, and those who
passed will be allowed to teach
during the winter and spring
quarters," Marincovich said.
While a few years ago a stu
dent may have been rightfully
concerned about having a foreign
graduate student teaching his
class, Marincovich said that now
there is not as much reason for
concern.
Instead, she said, many of the
problems now stem from stu
dents holding preconceived, un
fair notions about foreign TAs.
Because of those attitudes, she
said, some students don't give
foreign graduate students a fair
chance to teach.
"Some students panic. It's
hard to know if there really is a
problem or if the students have
created it themselves," Marin
covich said.
Brumfiel agreed. "I think
Stanford freshmen need to give
teaching fellows a chance. It
takes some time to get used to an
accent, and very often students
get panicky when their teacher
doesn't speak like an Ameri
can," he said.
Being a teaching assistant can
be a difficult job, especially when
finals are in the immediate fu
ture. Still, those who do it find
the experience to have rewards
that go beyond the salary and ac
ademic credit they receive.
"I like it and think it's worth
the effort," said sophomore
Neela Bhakta in explaining why
she is a calculus course assistant.

"It's pretty cool when someone
who is struggling finally under
stands a concept because of your
help."
Fourth-year graduate student
Kathy O'Shaughnessy, one of
the two winners of the first Paul
Harmon Kirkpatrick award for
excellence in undergraduate
physics teaching, concurred.
O'Shaughnessy is in charge of
evaluating all physics TAs, and
she also helps out with some of
the first-year students.
"My job is to get people to
communicate with their stu
dents," she said.
"Sometimes we get someone
who has trouble communicating
with the class and I go in and see
what is happening before making
recommendations," O'Shaugh
nessy added.
Marincovich said that the only
trouble with the student assistant
program is that people do not
take enough advantage of the
TAs.
"There is a perception of a gulf
between graduates and under
graduates, and TAs alleviate this
problem," she said. "Students
could use their TAs to get to
know a scholar well or to get
their feet wet and see if they are
interested in academic life".
Student assistants are impor
tant to Stanford now, and Marin
covich believes that their teach
ing experience will be a tremen
dous asset to them in the future.
"Forty percent of Stanford
Ph.Ds plan to be faculty, and an
increasing number of colleges
want evidence that an applicant
knows how to teach before they
will hire him or her," she said.
Although the professor may be
the focus of attention in Stanford
classes, many students find that
it is the student assistant who ul
timately makes or breaks a class.
"Students feel more comforta
ble with TAs in discussion sec
tions", said Dr. Michele Marin
covich of the Center for Teaching
and Learning.
"They are closer to the under
graduate experience and can of
ten provide more help," she
added.
In addition, student assistants
are vital to research universities
like Stanford for financial
reasons. Without their aid, Stan
ford would have to hire more
professors to teach lower divi
sion classes and would be unable
to offer as many graduate level
courses.
There are three types of stu
dent appointments at Stanford;
all are given the general label of
TA.
The first is a teaching fellow,
or a matriculated graduate stu
dent who has full charge and re
sponsibility for a course. In most
cases one course per quarter in
volves 20 hours of work per week
and is considered a half-time ap
pointment.

Teaching assistants are
graduate students who are subor
dinate to the faculty members
teaching a course. Their primary
duty is to meet with class sec
tions, usually once or twice a
week.
Course assistants fall into the
third category of student appoin
tees and can be either graduates
or undergraduates, depending on

the department. These people
might lead review or problem
sections, assist faculty members
in preparing lectures, or grade
papers.
Requirements for each posi
tion vary from department to de
partment as do the numbers of
students involved in teaching.

There are no readily available
statistics on how many student
assistants are at Stanford, hut
Marincovich estimated the num
ber to be around 900.
Most departments require
graduates to teach at least one
course during the time they
spend at Stanford.
"Almost all graduate students
TA at some point in this depart
ment," Mathematics Prof. Greg
Brumfiel said. "Out of the 12 stu
dents we accept every year, only
two or three in the period of a
few years might not teach for
various reasons,"
The situation is the same in
other departments. According to
Marincovich, many departments
have a teaching requirement and
students will be unable to obtain
a doctorate degree without teach
ing at least one course.
Student assistants are a
valuable resource to Stanford,
but problems can occur. One of
the biggest is the real and imag
ined communication barriers be
tween undergraduates and
foreign graduate students.
