# Canoeist goes 1700 miles
## Senior spends three months paddling to Hudson Bay 
### Kathy Lachenauer Staff writer 
Lewis and Clark conquered
the Great Northwest's wilder
ness, but who knows if they
could have taken on Stanford's
history and mechanical engi
neering departments as well.
Stanford senior Scott Ander
son, who is studying in both of
these fields, proved that he is
capable of both academia and
adventure by canoeing 1700
miles in 85 days this summer.
With much fanfare from the
local press and television, An
derson and lifelong friend Steve
Baker left their Duluth, Minn.,
homes on a stormy day last
May, walked to the shore of
Lake Superior and set their 18-
and-a-half foot Wenonah canoe
in the 50-degree water for three
months of paddling.
"The trip was something we
figured we had to do," said An
derson, who stopped out during
his senior year to travel and or
ganize the canoe trip. Ander
son explained that canoeing is a
way of life in Duluth and that

this summer's adventure was a
childhood dream.
"Before we left we had every
mile dotted out," Anderson
said. The took the duo up Lake
Superior, through Lake Win
nipeg and to a Canadian trading
post on Hudson Bay.
"We spent $200 on maps, but
$1 a day on food," Anderson
said, adding that the trip was

cheaper than staying at home
for a summer.
According to Anderson, the
press coverage helped with ex
penses. People who recognized
them waved them to shore and
fixed dinner for the two pad
dlers when they stopped for the
night.

"It was really funny. For three
days we could watch ourselves
on TV (when we stopped at
people's houses)," Anderson
said.
But the trip was not all
publicity and pampering. It was
mostly hard work.
According to Anderson, 20-25
miles is the average daily dis
tance for a canoe trip, but his and
Baker's mileage was sporadic,
because they did not know what
to expect from the winds and
tides.
"On a good day we paddled all
night, about 40 miles. We also
had to spend 10 days sitting on
one shore (waiting for the wind to
change)," Anderson said.
The canoeists also spent part
of the excursion helping the Cree
Indian tribe in Canada.
The tribe did not have enough
mechanical understanding to
work the machinery needed to
rebuild the hardwood floor in its
church, but Anderson and Baker
did. For two weeks they lived
with the Crees while they sanded
and varnished the floor.
To thank them, the tribe's
chief paid for a plane ticket so
that Anderson could fly home for
a friend's weddin'g in the middle
of the canoe trip.
"They (the Indians) taught me
their perspective on things," said
Anderson, who has concentrated
on North American and

Canadian history while at Stan
ford. "I also learned a lot about
the fur trade." Anderson added.
Looking back on the whole ad
venture, Anderson said, "I had
the greatest time possible."
Anderson said he has an inter
est in returning to Canada after
graduation to help build a dam,
or he said might use his engineer
ing know-how "to revolutionize

the canoe paddle."
Despite all he learned from the
Indians and from his own per
severance, Anderson admitted
that Stanford also has a lot to of
fer him.
Anderson said he misses Min
nesota's woods and changing
seasons, but said "at Stanford I
really do learn so much from the
people around me."


Senior Scott Anderson spent three months on a canoe trip that took him
and a friend over 17(H) miles this summer.

publicity and pampering. It was
mostly hard work.
According to Anderson, 20-25
miles is the average daily dis
tance for a canoe trip, but his and
Baker's mileage was sporadic,
because they did not know what
to expect from the winds and
tides.
"On a good day we paddled all
night, about 40 miles. We also
had to spend 10 days sitting on
one shore (waiting for the wind to
change)," Anderson said.
The canoeists also spent part
of the excursion helping the Cree
Indian tribe in Canada.
The tribe did not have enough
mechanical understanding to
work the machinery needed to
rebuild the hardwood floor in its
church, but Anderson and Baker
did. For two weeks they lived
with the Crees while they sanded
and varnished the floor.
To thank them, the tribe's
chief paid for a plane ticket so
that Anderson could fly home for
a friend's weddin'g in the middle
of the canoe trip.
"They (the Indians) taught me
their perspective on things," said
Anderson, who has concentrated
on North American and

Canadian history while at Stan
ford. "I also learned a lot about
the fur trade." Anderson added.
Looking back on the whole ad
venture, Anderson said, "I had
the greatest time possible."
Anderson said he has an inter
est in returning to Canada after
graduation to help build a dam,
or he said might use his engineer
ing know-how "to revolutionize

the canoe paddle."
Despite all he learned from the
Indians and from his own per
severance, Anderson admitted
that Stanford also has a lot to of
fer him.
Anderson said he misses Min
nesota's woods and changing
seasons, but said "at Stanford I
really do learn so much from the
people around me."


Senior Scott Anderson spent three months on a canoe trip that took him
and a friend over 17(H) miles this summer.
