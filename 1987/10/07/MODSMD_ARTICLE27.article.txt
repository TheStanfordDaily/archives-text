## Senior spends three months paddling to Hudson Bay

Lewis and Clark conquered
the Great Northwest's wilder
ness, but who knows if they
could have taken on Stanford's
history and mechanical engi
neering departments as well.
Stanford senior Scott Ander
son, who is studying in both of
these fields, proved that he is
capable of both academia and
adventure by canoeing 1700
miles in 85 days this summer.
With much fanfare from the
local press and television, An
derson and lifelong friend Steve
Baker left their Duluth, Minn.,
homes on a stormy day last
May, walked to the shore of
Lake Superior and set their 18-
and-a-half foot Wenonah canoe
in the 50-degree water for three
months of paddling.
"The trip was something we
figured we had to do," said An
derson, who stopped out during
his senior year to travel and or
ganize the canoe trip. Ander
son explained that canoeing is a
way of life in Duluth and that

this summer's adventure was a
childhood dream.
"Before we left we had every
mile dotted out," Anderson
said. The took the duo up Lake
Superior, through Lake Win
nipeg and to a Canadian trading
post on Hudson Bay.
"We spent $200 on maps, but
$1 a day on food," Anderson
said, adding that the trip was

cheaper than staying at home
for a summer.
According to Anderson, the
press coverage helped with ex
penses. People who recognized
them waved them to shore and
fixed dinner for the two pad
dlers when they stopped for the
night.
