# Band hopes to improve image

### Brent Chism 
It's 7:30 a.m. Saturday morn
ing. The Band is assembling at
the Band Shak to put the finish
ing touches on props for its per
formance, run through the
pregame and halftime shows and
enjoy a nourishing breakfast of
milk and doughnuts.
According to a recent article
on the Band in Rolling Stone
Magazine, this is a typical morn
ing for the "new" Band, which is
hoping to clean up its reckless
behavior. The article, which took
an insightful look at the group's
daily life, painted a picture of a
Band that is spending less time
partying and more time working.
"It was a very honest article,"
Band Manager Todd Olson said.
"I think it has made people un
derstand the Band better."
Olson said he agreed that
changes are being made within
the organization.

After last year's run-in with
the University administration
after several Band members
urinated on the field after a foot
ball game — an incident that
resulted in the Band being placed
on probation — the Band is striv
ing to mend its ways. As a result
of the incident, members are no
longer allowed to drink alcohol
during games.
"Their risk-taking hasn't
changed," Athletic Director
Andy Geiger said. However,
"the awareness of the risks they
are taking has .... They now
have a better understanding of
the pressures on me (as a result
of their actions) that they didn't
have before," Geiger said.
Olson concurred and said that
among the Band members there
is renewed self-awareness and
awareness of the audience.
"The questioning of society is
still there," Olson said of the
Band's famous irreverence, "but

now it's tempered with deeper
thought."
This new capacity for reflec
tion in the Band, according to
Geiger, is a crucial change.
"When you accept the respon
sibility to perform on the field in
front of 60 to 70 thousand
people," you can't appeal to a
particular group's sense of
humor, he said.
"I'm not looking for something
to be bad. The Band is not my
enemy. They are strong support
ers of our teams and our activi
ties ... . The Band has a lot to
be proud of," he added.
The change, which Olson
called "a change in attitude but
not in style," seems to have
become apparent to the public.
Some spectators at last week's
football game said they thought
the Band sounded better. Others
thought the group seemed
"dignified, cleaner," or that it
was funnier.

One spectator said she thought
the difference was that "more of
them had their jackets on." An
other said, that "They're always
going to be obnoxious. It's won
derful."
Individual Band members' re
actions to the changes in their
style were overwhelmingly posi
tive. "I really can't remember
the Band sounding better," drum
major Pete Adamy said.
A smaller number of Band
members, however, said they
found the changes disheartening.
"I'm disappointed with the
band's spirit. There's a lot less
energy in the shows this year,"
one member said. "There is an
absence of a spine in the manage
ment. We didn't used to care if
we offended somebody."
According to Olson, "We're
still fundamentally off the wall,
that's key.
"If we lose that, we lose a
lot."

not in style," seems to have
become apparent to the public.
Some spectators at last week's
football game said they thought
the Band sounded better. Others
thought the group seemed
"dignified, cleaner," or that it
was funnier.

One spectator said she thought
the difference was that "more of
them had their jackets on." An
other said, that "They're always
going to be obnoxious. It's won
derful."
Individual Band members' re
actions to the changes in their
style were overwhelmingly posi
tive. "I really can't remember
the Band sounding better," drum
major Pete Adamy said.
A smaller number of Band
members, however, said they
found the changes disheartening.
"I'm disappointed with the
band's spirit. There's a lot less
energy in the shows this year,"
one member said. "There is an
absence of a spine in the manage
ment. We didn't used to care if
we offended somebody."
According to Olson, "We're
still fundamentally off the wall,
that's key.
"If we lose that, we lose a
lot."

After conflicts with the Athletic Department last year over its behavior,
the Band is undergoing some changes which include not drinking at
football games.
