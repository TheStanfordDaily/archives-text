## There's light at the end of Bruce's 'Tunnel' 
### Michael Newman Senior staff writer 
For Bruce Springsteen, "Tun
nel of lx>ve" marks both a con
tinuation and a departure. The al
bum, released Monday, forms a
stark counterpoint to the hard
rocking "Born in the U.5.A.,"
his last studio LP. But the ab
sence of the E Street Band — it's
only Springsteen and drummer
Max Weinberg on six of the LP's
12 songs — gives "Tunnel of
Love" a clean, sparse sound
reminiscent of "Nebraska."
"Tunnel of Love" has its roots
in that 1982 LP, and the new al
bum treats many of the same
themes Springsteen wrestled
with in "Nebraska": loneliness,
the struggles of "an honest man"
(a prominent character on both
albums), and the tensions of rela
tionships. And, like "Ne
braska," "Tunnel of Love"
raises more problems than it
solves.
There are no traditional girl
meet s-boy-and-they-both-live
happily-ever-after love songs
here. Springsteen has never been
one for easy answers, and
"Tunnel of Love" contains
none. "It ought to be easy, ought
to be simple enough/ Man meets
woman and they fall in love," he
sings in the album's title song.
"But the house is haunted and
the ride gets rough/ And you've
got to learn to live with what you
can't rise above."
"Tunnel of Love" is filled with
such somber reminders of the dif
ficulty of love. But it also reaf
firms the will to survive; in
"Spare Parts," a jilted wife
doesn't brood for long before she
takes her wedding dress and en
gagement ring to a pawn shop for
some "good cold cash." Spring
steen has always tempered even
his most idealistic anthems with a
healthy dose of reality.
That vision of reality is what
separates Springsteen from all
other rock artists. Springsteen
often describes life's sad, lonely,
apparently hopeless happenings

— listen to "Johnny 99,"
"Darkness on the Edge of
Town," even "Born in the
U.S.A." — but he always affirms
the possibilty for improvement.
In "Tunnel of Love," he main
tains his brilliant balance be
tween hope and desparation, be
tween dreams and reality, and —
most emphatically here — be
tween love and loneliness. The
result is a quiet, reflective mas
terpiece.
It is Springsteen's first album
since he was married in 1985, and
all its songs have* something to
say about love. But what he says
isn't all good. In characteristic
fashion, Springsteen describes
the complexity of love, and the
problems of sustaining a relation
ship.
In "Two Faces," Springsteen
sings of ambivalent feelings, of a
character who makes his lover
happy one day and sad the next.
"Two faces have I," he sings.
"One that laughs and one that
cries/ One says hello one says
goodbye/ One does things 1 don't
understand/ Makes me feel like
half a man." This song isn't sim
ply another ditty about a lover
having mixed feelings; Spring
steen's character looks into him
self and struggles with his own
intentions.
This kind of introspection is
also evident on the album's first
single, "Brilliant Disguise."
Once again, Springsteen spurns
the cliche-ridden conventions
that plague most rock'n'roll love
songs. He sings about a man who
worries about his partner's
fidelity, but is also unsure of his
own ability to remain faithful: "I
wanna know if it's you I don't
trust/ 'Cause I damn sure don't
trust myself."
"Valentine's Day," a pretty,
lilting song on which Springsteen
plays all the instruments (guitar,
drums, piano and synthesizer),
contains no such self-doubt. It is
one of the album's most affecting
tracks, about a man deep in
