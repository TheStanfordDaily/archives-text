## There's light at the end of Bruce's 'Tunnel' 
### Michael Newman Senior staff writer 
For Bruce Springsteen, "Tun
nel of lx>ve" marks both a con
tinuation and a departure. The al
bum, released Monday, forms a
stark counterpoint to the hard
rocking "Born in the U.5.A.,"
his last studio LP. But the ab
sence of the E Street Band — it's
only Springsteen and drummer
Max Weinberg on six of the LP's
12 songs — gives "Tunnel of
Love" a clean, sparse sound
reminiscent of "Nebraska."
"Tunnel of Love" has its roots
in that 1982 LP, and the new al
bum treats many of the same
themes Springsteen wrestled
with in "Nebraska": loneliness,
the struggles of "an honest man"
(a prominent character on both
albums), and the tensions of rela
tionships. And, like "Ne
braska," "Tunnel of Love"
raises more problems than it
solves.
There are no traditional girl
meet s-boy-and-they-both-live
happily-ever-after love songs
here. Springsteen has never been
one for easy answers, and
"Tunnel of Love" contains
none. "It ought to be easy, ought
to be simple enough/ Man meets
woman and they fall in love," he
sings in the album's title song.
"But the house is haunted and
the ride gets rough/ And you've
got to learn to live with what you
can't rise above."
"Tunnel of Love" is filled with
such somber reminders of the dif
ficulty of love. But it also reaf
firms the will to survive; in
"Spare Parts," a jilted wife
doesn't brood for long before she
takes her wedding dress and en
gagement ring to a pawn shop for
some "good cold cash." Spring
steen has always tempered even
his most idealistic anthems with a
healthy dose of reality.
That vision of reality is what
separates Springsteen from all
other rock artists. Springsteen
often describes life's sad, lonely,
apparently hopeless happenings

— listen to "Johnny 99,"
"Darkness on the Edge of
Town," even "Born in the
U.S.A." — but he always affirms
the possibilty for improvement.
In "Tunnel of Love," he main
tains his brilliant balance be
tween hope and desparation, be
tween dreams and reality, and —
most emphatically here — be
tween love and loneliness. The
result is a quiet, reflective mas
terpiece.
It is Springsteen's first album
since he was married in 1985, and
all its songs have* something to
say about love. But what he says
isn't all good. In characteristic
fashion, Springsteen describes
the complexity of love, and the
problems of sustaining a relation
ship.
In "Two Faces," Springsteen
sings of ambivalent feelings, of a
character who makes his lover
happy one day and sad the next.
"Two faces have I," he sings.
"One that laughs and one that
cries/ One says hello one says
goodbye/ One does things 1 don't
understand/ Makes me feel like
half a man." This song isn't sim
ply another ditty about a lover
having mixed feelings; Spring
steen's character looks into him
self and struggles with his own
intentions.
This kind of introspection is
also evident on the album's first
single, "Brilliant Disguise."
Once again, Springsteen spurns
the cliche-ridden conventions
that plague most rock'n'roll love
songs. He sings about a man who
worries about his partner's
fidelity, but is also unsure of his
own ability to remain faithful: "I
wanna know if it's you I don't
trust/ 'Cause I damn sure don't
trust myself."
"Valentine's Day," a pretty,
lilting song on which Springsteen
plays all the instruments (guitar,
drums, piano and synthesizer),
contains no such self-doubt. It is
one of the album's most affecting
tracks, about a man deep in

thought while driving his car
home late at night. Recent events
have invigorated him: "A friend
of mine became a father last
night/ When we spoke in his
voice I could hear the light/ Of
the skies and the rivers the tim
berwolf in the pines."
The song presents an interest
ing contrast. Certainly, Spring
steen has sung about people
driving in cars often enough; the
imagery, though, is unusually
vivid, and the subject matter is
uncharted territory for the Boss.
He uses familiar imagery to pres
ent new themes.
And there is a lot of familiar
imagery and common Spring
steen phrases in "Tunnel of
Love." Many of the songs on the
album use words like "honey"
and "baby," and many of them
have references to cars and the
night. But Springsteen has
matured.
On other albums, cars pro
vided a means of escape; on
"Thunder Road'" from the
"Born To Run" album, Spring
steen sang about the exhiliration
of the road at night: "So roll
down the window/ And let the
wind blow back your hair/ This
night's bustin' open/ These two
lanes will take us anywhere."
In "Tunnel of Love," the im
agery is there, but it doesn't al
ways provide escape. "Cautious
Man," about "a man of the
road" named Bill Horton who
forsakes his peripatetic life to
marry, provides a sobering
reassesment of the values of the
road:
One night Hilly awoke from a ter
rible dream call in' his wife's
name
She lay breathing beside him in a
peaceful sleep, a thousand miles
away
He got dressed in the moonlight
and down to the highway he
strode
When he got there he didn 't find
nothing but road
Familiar or not, Springsteen
hasn't lost his knack for turning a
phrase. His lyrics are a delight.
In "One Step Up," Springsteen
says a girl across the bar "ain't
lookin' too married": in "Tunnel
of Love," the man at an amuse
ment park "takes the money
from my hand while his eyes take
a walk all over you." His grasp
of the language is certainly better
than most other rock'n'roll art
ists.
Musically, Springsteen shows

a remarkable versatility in
"Tunnel of Love." The arrange
ments are minimal, and he
records most tracks by himself;
the title track is really the only
song on the album that has
anywhere near a full complement
of the E Street Hand. The album
is mostly a Springsteen solo proj
ect, with occasional help from
Weinberg and organist Danny
Federici. Clarence Clemons
makes one brief appearance, and
that's only to sing backup vocals;
his saxophone remains silent
throughout the album.
The sparse sound of the songs,
though, creates a quiet, under
stated tone that fits the LP well.
Springsteen is singing about love
here, and the soft, gentle
melodies would probably have
seemed cluttered with added in
strumentation. On many of the
songs, Springsteen's voice is
more prominent than any of the
instruments.

Springsteen's voice is strong
yet vulnerable in "Walk Like a
Man," perhaps the album's best
track. The song asks for the
strength to fulfill a commitment.
It is the only song on the album in
which Springsteen speaks of the
role of parents in marriage.
At the altar on his wedding
day, a bridegroom remembers
how his mother used to take him
and his sister to the local church
to watch happy couples get
married. As his mother steps
away and leaves him at the altar,
he asks for the strength to "walk
like a man." Later, years after
the wedding, he reflects on what
has happened since: "I didn't
think there'd be so many steps/
I'd have to learn on my
own. . . ./ Now I'll do what I
can/ I'll walk like a man."
This song is not only about the
challenge of fulfilling marriage
vows; it's about the example one
generation sets for another. The
groom is trying to please his wife
and please his mother. Not many
rock'n'roll songs would look at
marriage from that angle.
But then, Bruce Springsteen
isn't just any rock'n'roll artist. If
nothing else, this album proves
that. "Tunnel of Love" is a
thoughtful, insightful album, and
with it Springsteen has once
again produced a work of uncom

than most other rock'n'roll art
ists.
Musically, Springsteen shows

a remarkable versatility in
"Tunnel of Love." The arrange
ments are minimal, and he
records most tracks by himself;
the title track is really the only
song on the album that has
anywhere near a full complement
of the E Street Hand. The album
is mostly a Springsteen solo proj
ect, with occasional help from
Weinberg and organist Danny
Federici. Clarence Clemons
makes one brief appearance, and
that's only to sing backup vocals;
his saxophone remains silent
throughout the album.
The sparse sound of the songs,
though, creates a quiet, under
stated tone that fits the LP well.
Springsteen is singing about love
here, and the soft, gentle
melodies would probably have
seemed cluttered with added in
strumentation. On many of the
songs, Springsteen's voice is
more prominent than any of the
instruments.

Springsteen's voice is strong
yet vulnerable in "Walk Like a
Man," perhaps the album's best
track. The song asks for the
strength to fulfill a commitment.
It is the only song on the album in
which Springsteen speaks of the
role of parents in marriage.
At the altar on his wedding
day, a bridegroom remembers
how his mother used to take him
and his sister to the local church
to watch happy couples get
married. As his mother steps
away and leaves him at the altar,
he asks for the strength to "walk
like a man." Later, years after
the wedding, he reflects on what
has happened since: "I didn't
think there'd be so many steps/
I'd have to learn on my
own. . . ./ Now I'll do what I
can/ I'll walk like a man."
This song is not only about the
challenge of fulfilling marriage
vows; it's about the example one
generation sets for another. The
groom is trying to please his wife
and please his mother. Not many
rock'n'roll songs would look at
marriage from that angle.
But then, Bruce Springsteen
isn't just any rock'n'roll artist. If
nothing else, this album proves
that. "Tunnel of Love" is a
thoughtful, insightful album, and
with it Springsteen has once
again produced a work of uncom
mon sensitivity.

For Bruce Springsteen, "Tun
nel of lx>ve" marks both a con
tinuation and a departure. The al
bum, released Monday, forms a
stark counterpoint to the hard
rocking "Born in the U.5.A.,"
his last studio LP. But the ab
sence of the E Street Band — it's
only Springsteen and drummer
Max Weinberg on six of the LP's
12 songs — gives "Tunnel of
Love" a clean, sparse sound
reminiscent of "Nebraska."
"Tunnel of Love" has its roots
in that 1982 LP, and the new al
bum treats many of the same
themes Springsteen wrestled
with in "Nebraska": loneliness,
the struggles of "an honest man"
(a prominent character on both
albums), and the tensions of rela
tionships. And, like "Ne
braska," "Tunnel of Love"
raises more problems than it
solves.
There are no traditional girl
meet s-boy-and-they-both-live
happily-ever-after love songs
here. Springsteen has never been
one for easy answers, and
"Tunnel of Love" contains
none. "It ought to be easy, ought
to be simple enough/ Man meets
woman and they fall in love," he
sings in the album's title song.
"But the house is haunted and
the ride gets rough/ And you've
got to learn to live with what you
can't rise above."
"Tunnel of Love" is filled with
such somber reminders of the dif
ficulty of love. But it also reaf
firms the will to survive; in
"Spare Parts," a jilted wife
doesn't brood for long before she
takes her wedding dress and en
gagement ring to a pawn shop for
some "good cold cash." Spring
steen has always tempered even
his most idealistic anthems with a
healthy dose of reality.
That vision of reality is what
separates Springsteen from all
other rock artists. Springsteen
often describes life's sad, lonely,
apparently hopeless happenings

— listen to "Johnny 99,"
"Darkness on the Edge of
Town," even "Born in the
U.S.A." — but he always affirms
the possibilty for improvement.
In "Tunnel of Love," he main
tains his brilliant balance be
tween hope and desparation, be
tween dreams and reality, and —
most emphatically here — be
tween love and loneliness. The
result is a quiet, reflective mas
terpiece.
It is Springsteen's first album
since he was married in 1985, and
all its songs have* something to
say about love. But what he says
isn't all good. In characteristic
fashion, Springsteen describes
the complexity of love, and the
problems of sustaining a relation
ship.
In "Two Faces," Springsteen
sings of ambivalent feelings, of a
character who makes his lover
happy one day and sad the next.
"Two faces have I," he sings.
"One that laughs and one that
cries/ One says hello one says
goodbye/ One does things 1 don't
understand/ Makes me feel like
half a man." This song isn't sim
ply another ditty about a lover
having mixed feelings; Spring
steen's character looks into him
self and struggles with his own
intentions.
This kind of introspection is
also evident on the album's first
single, "Brilliant Disguise."
Once again, Springsteen spurns
the cliche-ridden conventions
that plague most rock'n'roll love
songs. He sings about a man who
worries about his partner's
fidelity, but is also unsure of his
own ability to remain faithful: "I
wanna know if it's you I don't
trust/ 'Cause I damn sure don't
trust myself."
"Valentine's Day," a pretty,
lilting song on which Springsteen
plays all the instruments (guitar,
drums, piano and synthesizer),
contains no such self-doubt. It is
one of the album's most affecting
tracks, about a man deep in

thought while driving his car
home late at night. Recent events
have invigorated him: "A friend
of mine became a father last
night/ When we spoke in his
voice I could hear the light/ Of
the skies and the rivers the tim
berwolf in the pines."
The song presents an interest
ing contrast. Certainly, Spring
steen has sung about people
driving in cars often enough; the
imagery, though, is unusually
vivid, and the subject matter is
uncharted territory for the Boss.
He uses familiar imagery to pres
ent new themes.
And there is a lot of familiar
imagery and common Spring
steen phrases in "Tunnel of
Love." Many of the songs on the
album use words like "honey"
and "baby," and many of them
have references to cars and the
night. But Springsteen has
matured.
On other albums, cars pro
vided a means of escape; on
"Thunder Road'" from the
"Born To Run" album, Spring
steen sang about the exhiliration
of the road at night: "So roll
down the window/ And let the
wind blow back your hair/ This
night's bustin' open/ These two
lanes will take us anywhere."
In "Tunnel of Love," the im
agery is there, but it doesn't al
ways provide escape. "Cautious
Man," about "a man of the
road" named Bill Horton who
forsakes his peripatetic life to
marry, provides a sobering
reassesment of the values of the
road:
One night Hilly awoke from a ter
rible dream call in' his wife's
name
She lay breathing beside him in a
peaceful sleep, a thousand miles
away
He got dressed in the moonlight
and down to the highway he
strode
When he got there he didn 't find
nothing but road
Familiar or not, Springsteen
hasn't lost his knack for turning a
phrase. His lyrics are a delight.
In "One Step Up," Springsteen
says a girl across the bar "ain't
lookin' too married": in "Tunnel
of Love," the man at an amuse
ment park "takes the money
from my hand while his eyes take
a walk all over you." His grasp
of the language is certainly better
than most other rock'n'roll art
ists.
Musically, Springsteen shows

thought while driving his car
home late at night. Recent events
have invigorated him: "A friend
of mine became a father last
night/ When we spoke in his
voice I could hear the light/ Of
the skies and the rivers the tim
berwolf in the pines."
The song presents an interest
ing contrast. Certainly, Spring
steen has sung about people
driving in cars often enough; the
imagery, though, is unusually
vivid, and the subject matter is
uncharted territory for the Boss.
He uses familiar imagery to pres
ent new themes.
And there is a lot of familiar
imagery and common Spring
steen phrases in "Tunnel of
Love." Many of the songs on the
album use words like "honey"
and "baby," and many of them
have references to cars and the
night. But Springsteen has
matured.
On other albums, cars pro
vided a means of escape; on
"Thunder Road'" from the
"Born To Run" album, Spring
steen sang about the exhiliration
of the road at night: "So roll
down the window/ And let the
wind blow back your hair/ This
night's bustin' open/ These two
lanes will take us anywhere."
In "Tunnel of Love," the im
agery is there, but it doesn't al
ways provide escape. "Cautious
Man," about "a man of the
road" named Bill Horton who
forsakes his peripatetic life to
marry, provides a sobering
reassesment of the values of the
road:
One night Hilly awoke from a ter
rible dream call in' his wife's
name
She lay breathing beside him in a
peaceful sleep, a thousand miles
away
He got dressed in the moonlight
and down to the highway he
strode
When he got there he didn 't find
nothing but road
Familiar or not, Springsteen
hasn't lost his knack for turning a
phrase. His lyrics are a delight.
In "One Step Up," Springsteen
says a girl across the bar "ain't
lookin' too married": in "Tunnel
of Love," the man at an amuse
ment park "takes the money
from my hand while his eyes take
a walk all over you." His grasp
of the language is certainly better
than most other rock'n'roll art
ists.
Musically, Springsteen shows

a remarkable versatility in
"Tunnel of Love." The arrange
ments are minimal, and he
records most tracks by himself;
the title track is really the only
song on the album that has
anywhere near a full complement
of the E Street Hand. The album
is mostly a Springsteen solo proj
ect, with occasional help from
Weinberg and organist Danny
Federici. Clarence Clemons
makes one brief appearance, and
that's only to sing backup vocals;
his saxophone remains silent
throughout the album.
The sparse sound of the songs,
though, creates a quiet, under
stated tone that fits the LP well.
Springsteen is singing about love
here, and the soft, gentle
melodies would probably have
seemed cluttered with added in
strumentation. On many of the
songs, Springsteen's voice is
more prominent than any of the
instruments.

Springsteen's voice is strong
yet vulnerable in "Walk Like a
Man," perhaps the album's best
track. The song asks for the
strength to fulfill a commitment.
It is the only song on the album in
which Springsteen speaks of the
role of parents in marriage.
At the altar on his wedding
day, a bridegroom remembers
how his mother used to take him
and his sister to the local church
to watch happy couples get
married. As his mother steps
away and leaves him at the altar,
he asks for the strength to "walk
like a man." Later, years after
the wedding, he reflects on what
has happened since: "I didn't
think there'd be so many steps/
I'd have to learn on my
own. . . ./ Now I'll do what I
can/ I'll walk like a man."
This song is not only about the
challenge of fulfilling marriage
vows; it's about the example one
generation sets for another. The
groom is trying to please his wife
and please his mother. Not many
rock'n'roll songs would look at
marriage from that angle.
But then, Bruce Springsteen
isn't just any rock'n'roll artist. If
nothing else, this album proves
that. "Tunnel of Love" is a
thoughtful, insightful album, and
with it Springsteen has once
again produced a work of uncom
mon sensitivity.

For Bruce Springsteen, "Tun
nel of lx>ve" marks both a con
tinuation and a departure. The al
bum, released Monday, forms a
stark counterpoint to the hard
rocking "Born in the U.5.A.,"
his last studio LP. But the ab
sence of the E Street Band — it's
only Springsteen and drummer
Max Weinberg on six of the LP's
12 songs — gives "Tunnel of
Love" a clean, sparse sound
reminiscent of "Nebraska."
"Tunnel of Love" has its roots
in that 1982 LP, and the new al
bum treats many of the same
themes Springsteen wrestled
with in "Nebraska": loneliness,
the struggles of "an honest man"
(a prominent character on both
albums), and the tensions of rela
tionships. And, like "Ne
braska," "Tunnel of Love"
raises more problems than it
solves.
There are no traditional girl
meet s-boy-and-they-both-live
happily-ever-after love songs
here. Springsteen has never been
one for easy answers, and
"Tunnel of Love" contains
none. "It ought to be easy, ought
to be simple enough/ Man meets
woman and they fall in love," he
sings in the album's title song.
"But the house is haunted and
the ride gets rough/ And you've
got to learn to live with what you
can't rise above."
"Tunnel of Love" is filled with
such somber reminders of the dif
ficulty of love. But it also reaf
firms the will to survive; in
"Spare Parts," a jilted wife
doesn't brood for long before she
takes her wedding dress and en
gagement ring to a pawn shop for
some "good cold cash." Spring
steen has always tempered even
his most idealistic anthems with a
healthy dose of reality.
That vision of reality is what
separates Springsteen from all
other rock artists. Springsteen
often describes life's sad, lonely,
apparently hopeless happenings

— listen to "Johnny 99,"
"Darkness on the Edge of
Town," even "Born in the
U.S.A." — but he always affirms
the possibilty for improvement.
In "Tunnel of Love," he main
tains his brilliant balance be
tween hope and desparation, be
tween dreams and reality, and —
most emphatically here — be
tween love and loneliness. The
result is a quiet, reflective mas
terpiece.
It is Springsteen's first album
since he was married in 1985, and
all its songs have* something to
say about love. But what he says
isn't all good. In characteristic
fashion, Springsteen describes
the complexity of love, and the
problems of sustaining a relation
ship.
In "Two Faces," Springsteen
sings of ambivalent feelings, of a
character who makes his lover
happy one day and sad the next.
"Two faces have I," he sings.
"One that laughs and one that
cries/ One says hello one says
goodbye/ One does things 1 don't
understand/ Makes me feel like
half a man." This song isn't sim
ply another ditty about a lover
having mixed feelings; Spring
steen's character looks into him
self and struggles with his own
intentions.
This kind of introspection is
also evident on the album's first
single, "Brilliant Disguise."
Once again, Springsteen spurns
the cliche-ridden conventions
that plague most rock'n'roll love
songs. He sings about a man who
worries about his partner's
fidelity, but is also unsure of his
own ability to remain faithful: "I
wanna know if it's you I don't
trust/ 'Cause I damn sure don't
trust myself."
"Valentine's Day," a pretty,
lilting song on which Springsteen
plays all the instruments (guitar,
drums, piano and synthesizer),
contains no such self-doubt. It is
one of the album's most affecting
tracks, about a man deep in

thought while driving his car
home late at night. Recent events
have invigorated him: "A friend
of mine became a father last
night/ When we spoke in his
voice I could hear the light/ Of
the skies and the rivers the tim
berwolf in the pines."
