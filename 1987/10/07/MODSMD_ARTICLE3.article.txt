# Honor Code violations on the rise

### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
The number of Stanford students found
guilty of Fundamental Standard and Honor
Code violations has increased over the last
four years, according to a report issued
recently by the University Judicial Affairs
Office.
The number of violations rose from 18 in
the 1982-83 academic year to 37 during 1986-
87, but Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole said
this rise might be due only to an increase in
reported violations.
Cole said the University has made
"deliberate" efforts in recent years to
publicize the Fundamental Standard and the
Honor Code through dormitory visits and an
nual reports. Those efforts "may have
resulted in more reporting of possible viola
tions," she said.
While the number of Honor Code viola
tions decreased slightly from 1985-86 to 1986-
87, Cole said the decrease is misleading be

cause some of the cases in 1985-86 relate to a
large-scale cheating scandal which occurred
during a spring quarter final exam for Intro
duction to Psychology two years ago.
"A few of those cases were handled immedi
ately after, and the rest, approximately eight,
were done last year," Cole said.
Last year the Judicial Affairs Office inves
tigated 11 violations of the Fundamental
Standard, a University policy established in
1906 which requires students to show respect
for "order, morality and the individual rights
of others."
The Judicial Affairs Office also investi
gated 26 violations of the Honor Code, which
Cole described as "applications of the Fun
damental Standard to academic work."
Fundamental Standard violations included
incidences of drunk driving and destruction
of campus property, while cheating on an ex
amination was a typical Honor Code viola
tion.
Cole suggested that one reason for the in
crease in Fundamental Standard violations is

a decreasing University tolerance for alcohol
abuse.
"We should expect both more initiatives
and more responses to alcohol-related mis
conduct,'' Cole said in the report.
In spite of numerous cases in which stu
dents knew of violations but did not take ac
tion, Cole said more and more students were
reporting Honor Code violations each year.
The report encouraged students and fac
ulty to have the "courage to speak out when
confronted with abuse."
"I think the faculty and other instructors
can remind people of their Honor Code
obligations," Cole said.
Cole also urged faculty to clarify and ex
plain rules because "a rule that makes sense
is more likely to be observed." Cole added,
however, that while an instructor's lack of
clarity in explaining rules can sometimes ex
plain Honor Code violations, it does not ab
solve the student of responsibility for his or
