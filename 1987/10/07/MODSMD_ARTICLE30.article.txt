# Stylish 'Slamdance' stumbles
## 
### Jennifer Reese 
It's the old movie story of a
likeable flake who stumbles into
a crime story and is sucked in
deeper and deeper, despite ef
forts to escape. We've seen it in
"Bedroom Window," in "Blow
Out," in "Body Heat," in a
hundred different movies. It has
become a formula, but it's a good
one. The viewer falls time and
again for the eerie twists of plot
as the flake-hero is drawn into a
world he doesn't understand.
Director Wayne Wang uses
this formula in his new movie,
"Slamdance," which attempts to
portray the emptiness and sur
realism of the Los Angeles un
derworld. This flake's name is
Drood; he's a flirty and irrespon
sible cartoonist estranged from
his beautiful wife and young
daughter. He's now living and
working in a cold, renovated
bathhouse rented by a batty old
woman. The movie kicks into ac
tion after Drood has an affair
with a mysterious blonde he
meets at a Hollywood rock club.
She is murdered, and he is im
plicated. In his search for the
truth he slides into the sordid
L.A. underworld of prostitution
and police corruption.
There's plenty of meat here for
an interesting story. A lot of the
details are really bizarre.
Drood's mad old landlady, who
steals his mail, is a creepy
enough figure; the punky thug
who assaults Drood is a strange
mixture of sympathy and
brutality; the whole atmosphere
is sinister and truly disturbing.
Yet, despite quite a few intrigu
ing set-ups, the movie as a whole
packs no punch. It's a collection
of mildly good ideas slapped to
gether in a sloppy, rambling
movie.
Too many questions remain
unanswered. We're never clued
into the relationships at the core
of the movie. The affair between
Drood and the mysterious blonde
is never explained: Does he love
her? Is there some explosive pas
sion between them? The flash
backs to this relationship are
quick and unsatisfying.
Equally unsatisfying is the
treatment of Drood's triangle
with his wife and his best friend.
What is going on? Why are all
these characters even here? It's
all set up right, but never ex
plained, never given emotional
weight. It doesn't even seem to

matter that Drood's wife has
been sleeping with his best
friend. Drood looks shocked
throughout the scene when he
makes this discovery, but later
the whole thing seems to be for
gotten. What are we to make of
this?
Too little in this movie is effec
tively explained; hence, none of
it really ever matters. In addition
there are no original turns to the
plot, and there are few surprises.
Only one scene — in which
Drood takes a hammer and chisel
to a dead man's teeth so the
police won't be able to identify
the corpse — is unforgettable.
And that scene is remarkable
only because it is so unexpected
and grotesque.
On the whole, the acting is
good, though Tom Hulce is the
wrong choice for Drood. Unfor
tunately, he hasn't shed the facial
expressions and hysterical giggle
he used to such great effect in
"Amadeus." The bratty Ama
deus laugh is extremely irritating
here.
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio
is stately and pretty as Drood's
wife, but her role is very sketchy,
which is too bad because she's
much more likable than Drood.
Harry Dean Stanton, playing a
police officer and looking charac
teristically like a burned-out '60s
reject, gives another one of his
patented dry, understated perfor
mances to good effect; but again,
the role is too sketchy.
In spite of a few scenes that
make you sit up and take notice,
some good actors and some puz
zling questions that are raised,
there isn't a lot to be said for this
movie. The viewer leaves the
theater with eyebrows raised,
wondering, "What's the point?
What happened? Do I care?"
Ultimately, this is another film
that inundates itself with preten
tious visuals in order, quite self
consciously, to create a stylish,
moody atmosphere. The movie
has atmosphere all right, but the
atmosphere's so thick you can
practically cut it with a knife.
Ever since the success of MTV
and "Miami Vice," most up-and
coming, hot shot movie directors
think that all they have to do to
satisfy an audience is dazzle
them with art deco styling and
flashy camera tricks. Underneath
all the surface gloss, in the effort
to cover up inadequacies in plot
structure and character develop
ment, substance is being sac
rificed to style.
