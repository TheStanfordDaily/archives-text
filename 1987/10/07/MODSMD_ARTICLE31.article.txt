## Play-calling lacks last year's spunk 
### 
By now, just about everyone
on campus should know that the
Stanford football team is not
having a good season. Although
the fact that the Cardinal still
hasn't won a game is probably a
good clue, the 49-0 thrashing Sat
urday at the hands (paws?) of the
UCLA Bruins must have given it
away.
All of this probably comes as
something of a surprise to the
average Stanford student, who
most likely arrived on campus to
find the Cardinal already 0-3.
"What happened?" you wonder.
"We were so good last year."
But things, including the Stan
ford football team, are not as bad

as they seem. So the Cardinal is
now 0-4. So they lost to San Jose
State — an event that hasn't hap
pened sinee Jack Elway himself
was coaching at San Jose State.
So they were thrashed by UCLA
after upsetting the Bruins two out
of the last three years. There are
actually reasons for all of this.
Honest.
First of all. there's the
schedule. This category is often
used as The Big Justification for
a poor record, hut in the Pac-10,
just playing league opponents is a
pretty tough assignment. Sched
uling is a downright legitimate
excuse.
Not only do you have UCLA,
USC and Washington, you also
have the Arizona schools. Heck,
you can't even count out Oregon
these days. And. as Stanford
knows all too well, the California
Bears can play their best when
Cal is at its worst, especially if
the opponent happens to wear
red. Or cardinal.
To make matters worse, Stan
ford goes and gets bowl teams
like Colorado and Sun Jose State
as its non-conference opponents.
For a school that's supposed to
be smart, Stanford sometimes
isn't very smart: starting next
year, the Cardinal will play Notre
Dame, and it's a long-term con
tract. You think the school would
learn its lesson after having the
10th toughest schedule in the
country this year.
The second reason for the Car
dinal's poor start has been pretty
well publicized, especially by
ABC, the network which had the
misfortune of broadcasting last
Saturday's travesty in the same
time slot as the NBC baseball
game of the week — an extra
inning pennant-race cliffhanger

between Detroit and Toronto.
That reason is Brad Muster, the
tall, broad-shouldered young
man who has the good taste to
wear a Boston Red Sox cap on
the sidelines.
The problem with Muster is
that he has spent too much time
on the sidelines this season. A
Heisman Trophy candidate
before his now-famous left ankle
kept him out of three of Stan
ford's first four games. Muster is
the heart of the Cardinal offense.
He can run. He can catch. That
doesn't sound that impressive,
since many people and a number
of golden retrievers can do the
same things, but most people and
golden retrievers aren't also the
leading returning all-purpose run
ner in college football.
How important is Muster to
the Stanford offense? The Cardi
nal averaged .7 yards per run
against UCLA Saturday. That's
two feet per carry. Most people
fall forward about three feet fur
ther than that. Brad might not be
able to salvage the entire football
season, but he could keep things
from getting so embarrassing.
Other key injuries have also
hurt the team, but that tends to
be a common problem in foot
ball. This week has been fairly
devoid of pain, however, and it
looks like just about everyone,
including Marshall Dillard and
Barry McKeever. should be able
to play against Washington State
Saturday.
The third reason for the Cardi
nal's struggles — the quarterback
thing — has been blown a little
out of proportion. All three Stan
ford quarterbacks looked over
matched against UCLA. All
three of them on the field at once
probably wouldn't have made
much difference — the Bruin
defense was just too good. All
three have different strengths:
Greg Ennis is a great runner,
Scott Stark has a good arm, and
Brian Johnson is just plain excit
ing.
The whole situation simply
hasn't been handled too well, and
that brings us to Stanford's
fourth problem: coaching. The
second-guesser's favorite cate
gory. The columnist's favorite
category. Particularly in this
case.
In terms of strategy, the quar
terback moves have not made
sense. At the beginning of the
season. Coach Jack Elway said
that Ennis had talent but just
didn't have the experience.
Three games later, after Ennis
had gained experience, Elway
started Stark — who didn't have
a down of college experience —
against UCLA.
Furthermore, Elway didn't
have Stark throw long, even
though the sophomore ostensibly


Susan
Slusser
started because he has the better
arm. It's not a knock against
Stark, but if Stanford is going to
stick with the short passing,
option-type game, Ennis is better
suited for it because he's a better
runner. UCLA is a difficult team
to throw long against anyway,
and especially tough for someone
without a down of college experi
ence.
Once Elway decides on which
offense he wants to run and with
which quarterback, 1 hope he
comes up with a more interesting
game plan as well. Granted, it's
difficult to run any offense with
out your best player, but even
with Muster the play-calling has
been conservative at best and ut
terly lacking in imagination at
worst.
The San Jose State game is a
good example. The Cardinal
moved the ball fine until the team

got in scoring position, and then
it was Muster up the middle, Dil
lard up the middle, Muster up the
middle. On first and goal, why
not give the ball to your leading
rusher — Ennis? Why not fake a
field goal? Anything but the run
ning game which just hasn't been
too effective (see above, against
UCLA).
In Stanford's big upsets last
year, Elway pulled out all the
stops. The fake field goal against
Arizona, for instance. The play
calling in Cardinal losses, espe
cially the USC game, was boring
and conservative.
Let's face it, Stanford isn't
going to a bowl game this year.
There's no need to be conserva
tive now — the worst part of the
season is over. Muster and the
rest of the team are relatively
injury-free and all three quarter
backs have ability. Why not just
go for it? Go for the long bombs,
the trick plays, the fake forma
tions and mix it up. Healthy and
well-coached, Stanford still has a
shot at a respectable finish near
the middle of the Pac-10.
By now, just about everyone
on campus should know that the
Stanford football team is not
having a good season. Although
the fact that the Cardinal still
hasn't won a game is probably a

fourth problem: coaching. The
second-guesser's favorite cate
gory. The columnist's favorite
category. Particularly in this
case.
In terms of strategy, the quar
terback moves have not made
sense. At the beginning of the
season. Coach Jack Elway said
that Ennis had talent but just
didn't have the experience.
Three games later, after Ennis
had gained experience, Elway
started Stark — who didn't have
a down of college experience —
against UCLA.
Furthermore, Elway didn't
have Stark throw long, even
though the sophomore ostensibly


Susan
Slusser
started because he has the better
arm. It's not a knock against
Stark, but if Stanford is going to
stick with the short passing,
option-type game, Ennis is better
suited for it because he's a better
runner. UCLA is a difficult team
to throw long against anyway,
and especially tough for someone
without a down of college experi
ence.
Once Elway decides on which
offense he wants to run and with
which quarterback, 1 hope he
comes up with a more interesting
game plan as well. Granted, it's
difficult to run any offense with
out your best player, but even
with Muster the play-calling has
been conservative at best and ut
terly lacking in imagination at
worst.
The San Jose State game is a
good example. The Cardinal
moved the ball fine until the team

got in scoring position, and then
it was Muster up the middle, Dil
lard up the middle, Muster up the
middle. On first and goal, why
not give the ball to your leading
rusher — Ennis? Why not fake a
field goal? Anything but the run
ning game which just hasn't been
too effective (see above, against
UCLA).
In Stanford's big upsets last
year, Elway pulled out all the
stops. The fake field goal against
Arizona, for instance. The play
calling in Cardinal losses, espe
cially the USC game, was boring
and conservative.
Let's face it, Stanford isn't
going to a bowl game this year.
There's no need to be conserva
tive now — the worst part of the
season is over. Muster and the
rest of the team are relatively
injury-free and all three quarter
backs have ability. Why not just
go for it? Go for the long bombs,
the trick plays, the fake forma
tions and mix it up. Healthy and
well-coached, Stanford still has a
shot at a respectable finish near
the middle of the Pac-10.
By now, just about everyone
on campus should know that the
Stanford football team is not
having a good season. Although
the fact that the Cardinal still
hasn't won a game is probably a
good clue, the 49-0 thrashing Sat
urday at the hands (paws?) of the
UCLA Bruins must have given it
away.
All of this probably comes as
something of a surprise to the
average Stanford student, who
most likely arrived on campus to
find the Cardinal already 0-3.
"What happened?" you wonder.
"We were so good last year."
But things, including the Stan
ford football team, are not as bad

as they seem. So the Cardinal is
now 0-4. So they lost to San Jose
State — an event that hasn't hap
pened sinee Jack Elway himself
was coaching at San Jose State.
So they were thrashed by UCLA
after upsetting the Bruins two out
of the last three years. There are
actually reasons for all of this.
Honest.
First of all. there's the
schedule. This category is often
used as The Big Justification for
a poor record, hut in the Pac-10,
just playing league opponents is a
pretty tough assignment. Sched
uling is a downright legitimate
excuse.
Not only do you have UCLA,
USC and Washington, you also
have the Arizona schools. Heck,
you can't even count out Oregon
these days. And. as Stanford
knows all too well, the California
Bears can play their best when
Cal is at its worst, especially if
the opponent happens to wear
red. Or cardinal.
To make matters worse, Stan
ford goes and gets bowl teams
like Colorado and Sun Jose State
as its non-conference opponents.
For a school that's supposed to
be smart, Stanford sometimes
isn't very smart: starting next
year, the Cardinal will play Notre
Dame, and it's a long-term con
tract. You think the school would
learn its lesson after having the
10th toughest schedule in the
country this year.
The second reason for the Car
dinal's poor start has been pretty
well publicized, especially by
ABC, the network which had the
misfortune of broadcasting last
Saturday's travesty in the same
time slot as the NBC baseball
game of the week — an extra
inning pennant-race cliffhanger

between Detroit and Toronto.
That reason is Brad Muster, the
tall, broad-shouldered young
man who has the good taste to
wear a Boston Red Sox cap on
the sidelines.
The problem with Muster is
that he has spent too much time
on the sidelines this season. A
Heisman Trophy candidate
before his now-famous left ankle
kept him out of three of Stan
ford's first four games. Muster is
the heart of the Cardinal offense.
He can run. He can catch. That
doesn't sound that impressive,
since many people and a number
of golden retrievers can do the
same things, but most people and
golden retrievers aren't also the
leading returning all-purpose run
ner in college football.
How important is Muster to
the Stanford offense? The Cardi
nal averaged .7 yards per run
against UCLA Saturday. That's
two feet per carry. Most people
fall forward about three feet fur
ther than that. Brad might not be
able to salvage the entire football
season, but he could keep things
from getting so embarrassing.
Other key injuries have also
hurt the team, but that tends to
be a common problem in foot
ball. This week has been fairly
devoid of pain, however, and it
looks like just about everyone,
including Marshall Dillard and
Barry McKeever. should be able
to play against Washington State
Saturday.
The third reason for the Cardi
nal's struggles — the quarterback
thing — has been blown a little
out of proportion. All three Stan
ford quarterbacks looked over
matched against UCLA. All
three of them on the field at once
probably wouldn't have made
much difference — the Bruin
defense was just too good. All
three have different strengths:
Greg Ennis is a great runner,
Scott Stark has a good arm, and
Brian Johnson is just plain excit
ing.
The whole situation simply
hasn't been handled too well, and
that brings us to Stanford's
fourth problem: coaching. The
second-guesser's favorite cate
gory. The columnist's favorite
category. Particularly in this
case.
