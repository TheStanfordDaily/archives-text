# Card whips SJSU

### Chris Cruder Editorial staff 
San Jose — The Indian may be gone,
but his spirit still appears to be with Stan
ford. In Spartan Gym on a hot Indian
summer night, the San Jose State
women's volleyball team couldn't stand
the heat and proved to be relatively easy
pickings for the Cardinal, which cruised
to victory 15-13, 4-15, 15-4, 15-7.
After the first two games, the Spartans
just wilted, allowing Stanford to roll to its
sixth consecutive win. The Cardinal is
now 11-3, having won 18 of its last 20
games dating back to last season, while
the No. 12 Spartans lost their second
straight, falling to 10-2.
As is becoming usual, the No. 4 Cardi
nal was led by its trio of seniors. Setter
Wendi Rush dished out 53 assists, be
coming the first player in school history
to break the 4000-mark for a career. She
also had a match-high 15 digs and two
service aces.
Teresa Smith continued to assert her
claim as the top outside hitter in the
country as she totaled 15 kills and a .481
hitting percentage, while middle blocker
Nancy Reno led the team with 17 kills
and three total blocks. On the season, the
two are tied for the team lead with 191
kills.
Leading the way for the Spartans was
senior All-America candidate Barbara
Higgins. The Santa Clara native, one of
eight Spartans from Northern California
playing in a sport dominated by Southern
Californians, had a match-high 19 kills to
go with a .500 hitting percentage.
The 5-foot-11 middle blocker also was
the top blocker on the evening, with two

block solos and two block assists to go
with her match-high 15 digs.
"We had some trouble tonight," Smith
said, "but I think we were strong in that
we came back as a team. I think that's a
real strong point in tonight.
Game one started well, as Stanford
raced to a 3-0 lead, but that margin
evaporated like a puddle in this week's
sun, and SJSU was soon on top, 12-8.
Stanford fought back, however, and kills
by sophomore Lara Asper and junior
Amy Hayes and a net by Spartan setter
Danielle Spier gave the first game to the
Cardinal.
The second game wasn't even close as
Higgins and Gina Watson led San Jose in
a romp. The pair had eight kills for the
game, while Stanford as a whole had only
10. The Cardinal also had 10 hitting errors
in that game, and setter Rush actually led
the team with three kills — not a good
sign.
The third game was also a blowout, but
this time in the other direction, as the
Cardinal rode the play of Smith, Reno
and Asper to a 2-1 lead in games.
The final point was scored, rather ap
propriately, by seniors Reno, Rush and
Smith, who combined for a triple block
on SJSU's senior star, Higgins.
SJSU Coach Dick Montgomery started
getting concerned at this point, and while
he wished he could pull 1987 grads — and
1986 starters — Christa Cook and Maria
Healy out of the audience and suit them
up, he instead looked for help from fresh
men Betsy Welsh and Mary Ann Wagner
and sophomore setter Susie Laymon.
