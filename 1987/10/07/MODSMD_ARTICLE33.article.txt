# Men's soccer hosts Fresno St.
## 
### Debbie Spander 
With momentum on its side,
the Stanford men's soccer team
is looking for its second victory
ever against Pacific Soccer Con
ference rival Fresno State.
After defeating nationally
ranked San Francisco Saturday,
the Cardinal, which has a .500
record for the year, hosts the
perennially powerful Bulldogs at
3 p.m. today at Maloney Field.
Stanford, which has not beaten
Fresno State since 1978. hopes to
improve its 1-8 all-time record
against the Bulldogs. The Cardi
nal also seeks to avenge last
year's disputed 1-0 loss, in which
a Bulldogs player scored from
what Stanford Coach Sam Koch
believed was an offside position.
The Bulldogs, 8-2-1 on the
year, will be a tough opponent,
but Koch believes the Cardinal
has the talent and desire to pull
off a second straight upset.
"We beat a really good USF
squad this past weekend. When
we beat them (USF) two years
ago they were having an off year,
but they are very strong this
season. If we can play mistake
free, we have a legitimate chance
of defeating the Bulldogs," Koch
said.
To win, the Cardinal will have
to contain Fresno's two out
standing forwards, senior Femi
Olukanni and sophomore Bill

Wiskel. As a junior, Olukanni led
the Bulldogs to the NCAA semi
finals and was selected by Soccer
America magazine as the NCAA
Most Valuable Player.
"Olukanni and Wiskel are both
potent goal scorers," Koch said.
Both Koch and his players be
lieve that Stanford can win the
match. "We're playing well; we
just need to play well with con
sistency," Koch said.
"We need to play together as
we did against USF. We have to
play really hard with lots of team
spirit, capitalize on our chances
and make the least mistakes,"
senior midfielder Pat Sheehy
said.
According to Koch, injured
sophomore forward Chris Porch
is "getting into shape" and will
play this afternoon. Midfielder
Luke Garrott will also be able to
start. Other than these additions,
the starting lineup will resemble
that of the USF game. Injured
co-captain Mike Mossmer is still
not healthy enough to be in the
opening lineup, but will probably
see some action in the match.
A victory over Fresno State
would not only give the Cardinal
a winning record , but would, ac
cording to Koch, "mean we are
legitimate, that we are here."
A win over the Bulldogs would
be a major step in the Cardinal's
pursuit of a spot in postseason
action.
