# Card romps at NorCal sloop
## 
### Hugh Bethell Staff writer 
With two veteran seniors and a talented new
freshman aboard, the Stanford sailing team
surprised few observers when it captured the
Northern California Sloop Championship last
weekend at Santa Cruz.
By winning this early season-regatta, the team of
seniors Dan Buckstaff and Doug Hagen and fresh
man David Dowd qualified for the Pacific Coast
Sloop Championship next weekend.
In what was largely a light-wind regatta, the Car
dinal defeated five strong teams from across North
ern California. Because of a shortage of the Moore
24 class sailboats in which the regatta was held,
each team participated in four of the six races that
made up the championship. Stanford's record of
two second-place finishes and two first-place
finishes earned the Cardinal first place, while Cali
fornia captured second and UC-Santa Cruz took
third. San Francisco State, Sonoma and Cal Poly-
San Louis Obispo brought up the rear.
For Buckstaff, this weekend provided the rare
opportunity to race in a heavy keelboat instead of
the light centerboard flying junior boats that Stan
ford normally competes in. Despite early problems
with boathandling, Buckstaff pleased his coach

with his improving skills.
"When Dan began the regatta, it was obvious
that he hadn't been sailing in keelboats much. By
the end of the fourth race, though, his racing had
improved dramatically. It was very encouraging to
see," Stanford Coach Blake Middleton said.
In the fourth and final race for Stanford, Buck
staff, Dowd and Hagen managed to build such a big
lead that the nearest competitor was barely visible
as the Stanford boat crossed the finish line.
"It was a real horizon job. A big part of that was
Dave's work on the spinnaker," Middleton said of
Dowd. "Considering that he's very new to the
team, Dave's contribution was outstanding. To
gether with Doug, he showed a lot of finesse in his
crew work."
While preparing for the next level of sloop com
petition, the sailing team will also be pursuing four
other national championships. In the immediate fu
ture, several Cardinal sailors will be looking to the
singlehanded eliminations in the coming weeks. At
the same time, the whole Stanford squad will be
practicing for the start of the regular season, which
will lead into the dinghy racing, team racing and
women's championships in the spring. Both the
dinghy and team championships will be hosted by
Stanford in conjunction with the Richmond Yacht
Club.
