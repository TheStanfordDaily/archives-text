ST. LOUIS (AP) — Emer
gency starter Greg Mathews
blew away pressure and the
Giants, pitching four-hit ball for
seven-and-a-third innings and
blooping a key two-run single last
night as the St. Louis Cardinals
beat San Francisco 5-3 in the first
game of the National League
playoffs.
Even with Mathews' effort and
the largest crowd in Busch
Stadium history (55,331), St.
Louis had to hold on in the eighth
when the Giants scored once and
loaded the bases with two outs.
Reliever Ken Dayley retired Will
Clark on a long fly ball to end the
inning and then finished for a
save.
The Cardinals, plagued by in
juries all season and playing
without ailing first baseman Jack
Clark, were not hurt this time
after scheduled starter Danny
Cox came down with a stiff neck.
Mathews, told four hours before
the game he would pitch,
responded coolly.
