# Fleming a Card hot-shot

Field hockey excellence requires not only good
stick-handling, controlled passing and a hard and
accurate shot, but the knowledge of when, where
and how to use those skills. That kind of knowledge
sets players like Stanford junior midfielder Dana
Fleming apart from the crowd.
"She has a lot of different maneuvers and is not
afraid to use them during a game," Stanford Coach
Sheryl Johnson said of Fleming.
In addition to her stick-handling, Fleming has "a
good instinct for the game and a very hard shot,"
Johnson commented.
According to Johnson, Fleming has the hardest
and most accurate shot on the team this year. She
is the shooter for both the penalty corner and the
penalty stroke, similar to the corner and penalty
kicks in soccer.
"She looks for her scoring opportunities," said
Johnson, "but always looks to set up other players
as well."
Fleming demonstrated her stick-handling and
passing abilities in Saturday's 2-1 victory over San
Jose State. She set up the first goal with a beautiful
flick pass down the line, and helped create the
second goal, taking control of a muffed penalty cor
ner, weaving her way through three defenders and
popping a quick shot at the SJSU keeper. The
rebound was put in by junior Alison Smith.
Throughout the game, Fleming demonstrated
why she is so effective. Because she is such a fine
shooter, she attracts a lot of attention from the op
postion's defense, opening space for her
teammates. On numerous occasions, such as the
flick pass that set up the first goal Saturday,
Fleming was double-teamed, leaving teammates
free to handle her deft passes.
Fleming began her hockey career in eighth grade
when a friend's coach gave her a stick while she

was waiting for her friend to finish practice. "After
practice he asked me to travel with the team on its
next trip," Fleming said.
After graduating from high school, Fleming took
a year off to play in West Germany, where the
sport is more popular.
Although she currently plays midfield, Fleming
spent last year at sweeper due to a hack injury that
impaired her stick-handling.
"She learned to take her drives and turn them
into clears," Johnson said.
Fleming now teams with Smith to form one of the
best midfield one-two punches in the country. Al
though most teams use three midfielders, Johnson
uses only two.
"We've been playing together for over two years
now, and to have only two of us in the middle al
lows us to work together much better," Smith said.
One big factor in field hockey strategy is the
surface used for play. According to Johnson, Stan
ford plays about half of its games on natural grass
and the other half on artificial turf. While Fleming
feels that artificial turf is harder on the body, she
agrees with Johnson and Smith that the game is
faster, more interesting and better suited to Stan
ford's style of play.
Fleming, Smith and senior Ami Chitwood are tri
captains of the team this year, and the squad looks
to them for leadership.
"Her (Fleming's) enthusiasm and love for the
game show, especially when we're down," Smith
said. "The team can always count on her for sup
port."
Fleming is thinking about the 1992 Olympics, as
is Smith, who currently is a member of the U.S.
Junior National Team. But Fleming feels she needs
to keep herself motivated as well as healthy.
"You just have to want to be the very best you
can be. Otherwise you're just cheating yourself,"
she said.
