# Quad work continues

Landscaping and other con
struction in the northeast corner
of the Quad is nearing comple
tion, but some students are ignor
ing warning signs in the area, cre
ating what project engineer John
Kennedy said is a "really bad"
problem.
The project, which will im
prove the tarmac surface,
drainage systems and the overall
aesthetic quality of the area be
hind the Math Building, has tem
porarily disrupted normal pe
destrian and bicycle traffic routes
in the area.
Kennedy said he wanted to
begin the project last June so it
would be completed before
school started, but summer con-

ferences delayed the work. Ac
cording to Kennedy, students are
ignoring barriers and signs warn
ing that construction is in prog
ress, and are moving about the
area.
"I'm surprised that people
simply ignore the caution signs,
(although) I can understand the
students' views because we
shouldn't be constructing during
courses," he said.
Kennedy urged students to
avoid the area, especially from
Oct. 12 to Oct. 14, when fresh
blacktop will be applied. "It is
critical for students to stay out of
that courtyard during that time,"
he said.
Construction plans include
repaving walkways, enclosing
dumpsters in screened-in areas,

increasing bicycle parking and
constructing new seating areas
away from vehicle paths, Ken
nedy said.
He added that he hopes the
project will clearly distinguish
between bicycle and vehicle
lanes, because in the past,
bicycles have sometimes im
peded fire truck entrances.
According to Kennedy, the im
provements will cost $200,000.
About $170,000 will pay for con
struction costs, and the rest will
pay for designers and other
workers. The project is being
financed by Stanford's General
Plan for Improvement (GPI),
which assigns money to various
landscaping and underground
utility projects.
