An Atherton lawyer who is
very involved in the Stanford
Centennial Campaign has been
appointed to the University's
Board of Trustees. The new
trustee, John Freidenrich, said
yesterday that one of his top
priorities as a trustee will be to
strengthen the humanities at
Stanford.
Freidenrich will continue to
serve as co-chair of the Uni
versity's Centennial Campaign
major gifts committee. The
major gifts committee plays an
important role in allocating
large gifts to various Univer
sity programs.
"So far I've been to only
one (board) meeting â€” this is a
period of learning for me,"
said Freidenrich, who was
elected to the board in Sep
tember.
In order to strengthen the

humanities, Freidenrich said,
the miyor gifts committee will
allocate funds for both theater
and art projects, and will also
sponsor humanities professor
ships.
In addition, there are plans
to provide more undergradu
ate scholarships in all depart
ments. Freidenrich empha
sized that the plan to
strengthen humanities at Stan
ford is a "large component" of
a total campaign to benefit all
academic departments.
Freidenrich has been
actively involved with the
University for the past 20
years. After taking part in nu
merous Stanford fund-raising
activities, he became a Stan
ford Associate in 1979.
Freidenrich is a trustee of the
Athletic Department and
serves on the boards of direc
tors for the Stanford Hospital
and Children's Hospital.
