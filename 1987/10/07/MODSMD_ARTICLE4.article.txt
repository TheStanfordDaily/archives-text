# Iran-contra slides shown
## North hoped to use them at congressional hearings 
### Goodwin Liu 
A pro-contra slide show that
almost was introduced as
evidence during this summer's
Iran-contra hearings drew a
crowd of over 3(H) at Branner
Hall last night.
The Branner screening of
"The Soviet Threat in the West
ern Hemisphere" was the first
time the slide show was shown in
the Bay Area, according to
senior Keith Nashawaty, who or
ganized the event. The slide
show was originally used by
North and conservative members
of Congress to raise contra funds
from private donors.
Although Nashawaty prefaced
the program by saying that the
slide show was to be

"educational (and) not a forum
for any one cause," the evening
resulted in debate between Politi
cal Science Prof. Terry Karl and
Hoover Senior Fellow Angelo
Codevilla, a former senior staff
member of the Senate Select In
telligence Committee.
And nearly fifteen minutes into
the slide show, an opponent of
contra aid from the audience
knocked over the carousel
projector, shouting. "The con
tras are killing people in
Nicaragua!" The demonstrator
was knocked down by a Branner
resident assistant and immedi
ately escorted outside without
further incident.
Accompanied by North's
script, the slide show began with
a description of the strategic po

sition of Central American
countries and alleged Soviet
threats from Cuba and Grenada.
The pictures then shifted to
Nicaragua and its many ports,
airfields and military bases built
with Soviet assistance. These el
ements, according to the script
read by Nashawaty, establish
contra vulnerability.
The slide show went on to
profile and warn against key
leaders who strictly adhere to an
alleged Marxist-Leninist doctrine
of domestic and foreign policy,
such as Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega, Cuban leader
Fidel Castro and Libyan leader
Muommar Khadafi.
