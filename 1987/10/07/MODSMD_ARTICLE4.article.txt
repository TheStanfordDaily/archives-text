# Iran-contra slides shown
## North hoped to use them at congressional hearings 
### Goodwin Liu 
A pro-contra slide show that
almost was introduced as
evidence during this summer's
Iran-contra hearings drew a
crowd of over 3(H) at Branner
Hall last night.
The Branner screening of
"The Soviet Threat in the West
ern Hemisphere" was the first
time the slide show was shown in
the Bay Area, according to
senior Keith Nashawaty, who or
ganized the event. The slide
show was originally used by
North and conservative members
of Congress to raise contra funds
from private donors.
Although Nashawaty prefaced
the program by saying that the
slide show was to be

"educational (and) not a forum
for any one cause," the evening
resulted in debate between Politi
cal Science Prof. Terry Karl and
Hoover Senior Fellow Angelo
Codevilla, a former senior staff
member of the Senate Select In
telligence Committee.
And nearly fifteen minutes into
the slide show, an opponent of
contra aid from the audience
knocked over the carousel
projector, shouting. "The con
tras are killing people in
Nicaragua!" The demonstrator
was knocked down by a Branner
resident assistant and immedi
ately escorted outside without
further incident.
Accompanied by North's
script, the slide show began with
a description of the strategic po

sition of Central American
countries and alleged Soviet
threats from Cuba and Grenada.
The pictures then shifted to
Nicaragua and its many ports,
airfields and military bases built
with Soviet assistance. These el
ements, according to the script
read by Nashawaty, establish
contra vulnerability.
The slide show went on to
profile and warn against key
leaders who strictly adhere to an
alleged Marxist-Leninist doctrine
of domestic and foreign policy,
such as Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega, Cuban leader
Fidel Castro and Libyan leader
Muommar Khadafi.
The remainder of the program
showed tents, medical aid and
maps provided by U.S. contra
aid and also claimed to expose
the difficulties faced by the
Nicaraguan people from govern
ment oppression.
The show concluded with a
slide of a cross marking a contra
grave and North's script reading,
"The U.S. is able to offer (the
contras) more than the chance to
die for what they believe in."
Karl's brief commentary after
the slides traced the problems in
Central America to the concen
tration of land ownership and the
unfair treatment of peasants by
governments.
Karl, who has led congres
sional delegations to Central
America, disagreed with what
she termed Reagan's "East-
West" vision of the Central
American conflict, which blames
"external actors" like the Soviet
Union for the unrest.
"It is (the domestic) conditions

that create the environment for
external actors," she said.
Karl concluded that "Oliver
North's story is not the true
story. It is a piece of the story."
But Codevilla disagreed with
Karl, expressing concern that
Soviet aggression may eventually
result in a confrontation at the
U.S.-Mexico border.
Codevilla also said the U.S.
has not shown enough commit
ment to overthrow Nicaragua's
Saridinista government.
"There's a war going on, and
in wars only one side is going to
win. Which side will that be?. . .
The Reagan Administration
deserves everything it's getting
(from the Iran-contra scandal),
but the American people and the
Central American soldiers do
not," he said.
When asked whether the slide
show would have convinced tele
vision viewers to support the
contras, Steve Doctor, a Stan
ford Law School alumnus, said,
"1 don't think it would have
swayed anyone."
