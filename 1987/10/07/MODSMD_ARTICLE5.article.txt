# Minority panel nears readiness
## Commission will meet in 2 weeks 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
Pending appointment next week of one faculty member and four
student committee members, the newly-created University Commit
tee on Minority Issues will begin to re-evaluate ethnic minority life at
Stanford.
The committee, which has slated its first meeting for Oct. 20, will
be composed of six faculty members, four staff members, four stu
dent representatives of the black, chicano, American Indian and
Asian communities, four outside members who have no particular
University affiliation and a number of non-voting contributors.

Assoc. History Prof. Al
Camarillo, committee chair, said
the group will initially pursue is
sues brought to public attention
by the protests last May by the
Rainbow Agenda, an 8-month
old student group organized to
address concerns of ethnic
minorities on campus.
"Our intention is exploration,
fact-finding, resolution and rec
ommendation," he said. "Our
first course of action will be to
examine the complex set of
demands from the Rainbow
Agenda."
According to Camarillo, the
committee will discuss student
problems, propose solutions to
the appropriate University de
partments and oversee imple
mentation of its recommenda
tions. â€¢
The committee was formed as
a direct result of a list of demands
presented by the Agenda calling
for a committee to examine eth
nic minority life.
During the summer, the
Provost's Office worked with
four students to draft a charter
under which the minority com
mittee would operate. After
drafting the charter, an ad hoc
committee of faculty, staff and
students was assembled to select
members of the minority commit
tee.
At present, nine of the 10 fac
ulty and staff committee mem
bers have been selected.
According to senior Bill King,
chair of the Black Student Un
ion, the minority communities
are seeking student representa
tives at this time and will inde
pendently choose committee
members by Oct. 13, before offi
cial confirmation at next Tuesday
night's ASSU Senate meeting.
Camarillo said the process of
selecting the four outside mem
bers may not be completed until
late October or early November,
but that the committee will
proceed with the first meeting
without those representatives.
"These issues are just too im
portant," he said. "We can't
wait."
The ad hoc committee drafted
during the summer is responsible
for appointing the 10th faculty
member and the four outside
members.
Though he was not willing to
officially release the names of
committee members, Camarillo
