### Michael Tylman 
Last night marked the unoffi
cial opening of a new Asian-
American activities center in the
Old Union Clubhouse, and the
introduction of Julian Low, a
new assistant dean of Student Af
fairs who will deal with Asian
students' concerns.
The new center and dean s po
sition were requested last spring
by the Asian-American Students'
Association (A AS A) as part of a
series of demands by the Rain
bow Agenda, a coalition of
campus ethnic minority groups.
According to Michael Jackson,
assistant dean of Student Affairs,
the general theme of AASA's re
quests was "that the University
pay more attention to the con
cerns of Asian-American stu
dents."
As assistant dean of Student
Affairs for campus affairs. Low
will work closely with the AASA
to encourage student participa
tion in the group and to assist the
Student Affairs Office in dealing
with Asian students.
Yesterday's open house gave
interested students a chance to
learn about AASA and to see the
new center, which replaces the
previous one in the Old
Firehouse.
According to Jackson, AASA
will officially open the center
within the next two weeks after
organizing more publicity for stu
dents and faculty.
Sophomore Derick Lin, issues
vice chair for AASA and an
ASSU senator, said the new cen
ter is only temporary until the ad
ministration can find a better
one.
Senior Vivian Woo, a resident
assistant at Okada, the Asian-
American theme house, ex
plained that although the new
center is a definite improvement
from the old one. University offi
cials still consider the facility in
appropriate for its intended pur
pose.
According to Woo, too many
other activities go on in the same
building, and it is not secure
enough from intruders.
Before coming to Stanford,
Low worked for nine years with
Chinese community organiza
tions in both San Francisco and
Boston. Low will assume his offi
cial position here in two weeks.
"I'm excited," he said. "I'm
looking forward to working

here."
Low said he will help students
become acquainted with AASA
and assist in organizing programs
and activities. He will also act as
a liaison between students and
the administration.
There was an overall positive
feeling among the students over
the new changes in AASA. "I'm
glad [the administration] is finally
listening to our concerns," said
senior Jinny Shinsato, an AASA
intern. "This is great."
Lin echoed those sentiments:
"We've been fighting to get the
new place for 10 years. We're
pretty happy."
