# Music Dept. cuts delayed
## 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
I he School of Humanities
and Sciences has reversed a
previous decision to cut Music
Department funds. University
officials announced Friday.
The Music Department
budget will he restored to last
year's funding level. The addi
tional money will come jointly
from the Office of the Provost
and from the School of
Humanities and Science's
discretionary reserve fund, ac
cording to Wallace Falcon, as
sociate dean of Humanities and
Sciences.
"The good news is that we're
going to put things back on
track for this year," Falcon

said. The cancellation of the
cutbacks will be accompanied
by a thorough review and re
structuring of the long-term
budget, he said.
"It's sensible to take the ad
ditional time to re-look the
budget and re-look the fees in
stead of creating animosity,"
Falcon said, although he called
the proposed reductions "quite
modest."
"We [realizel the educa
tional value of a broad-based
music program, and we're
going to look once more at the
possibilities available to fund
it,"he added.
Prior to Friday's reversal,
the Music Department faced a
request to cut $25,000 from its
budget. Allocations for teach

ers' salaries were to be reduced
by 10 percent, and introductory
classes for non-music majors
were to be limited because of
the spending cuts.
The Music Department
planned to reduce or eliminate
piano, flute and classical guitar
lessons for non-majors. Despite
the reinstatement of funds,
elementary piano and guitar
classes will not be offered this
quarter because "it's too hard
to find all the student's we've
turned away," said John Plant
ing, Music Department admin
istrator. The courses will be
available winter quarter.
Sophomore flutist Julie
Yamato, who pays $240 a quar
ter for 10 private 50-minute les
sons, is one student who would
have been affected by the reduc
tion in classes. She said it was
"sad that a prestigious institution
such as Stanford University can
not accommodate music stu
dents, especially with a rise in
tuition and a $240 lesson fee."
But fees paid by students
cover less than half the expense
of lessons, while expenditures
for lessons and lectures have
grown more than 50 percent in

the last few years, according to
Falcon. The growth in costs was
not reflected in the budget, he
said.
"The current arrangement,
where the spending is not cov
ered in the budget, cannot go
on," Falcon said.
"We're trying to get both ade
quate budget and fee income,"
he said. "In the long run, Stan
ford's ]expenses[ cannot con
tinue to grow. Tough choices
must be made."
The Music Department is
"very happy with the decision,"
Planting said. "The issue is not
dead, but it's resolved temporar
ily."
