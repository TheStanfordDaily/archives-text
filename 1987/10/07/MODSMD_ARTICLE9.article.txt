Reagan will endorse peace plan
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, in a shift of adminis
tration strategy, will express support today in a speech to the
Organization of American States for a Central American peace
plan designed to end armed conflict in Nicaragua and other na
tions of the region, White House officials said yesterday.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan's
speech will "emphasize his support for the Guatemalan Plan,"
which he has previously described as "fatally flawed." The pro
posal was initiated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
The plan was adopted by presidents of the five Central Ameri
can nations, including Nicaragua, at an August meeting in
Guatemala City after the leaders rejected a rival proposal sub
mitted by Reagan and House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex.
Administration officials said that Reagan remains suspicious
of the leftist Sandinista rulers of Nicaragua but recognizes that
he must take a more conciliatory approach if he hopes to obtain
even humanitarian aid for the contra rebels opposing the gov
ernment. Secretary of State George P. Shultz has said the ad
ministration will seek an additional $270 million in military aid
for the contras.
Libya makes alliance with Algeria
PARIS — Libya's Col. Muommar Khadafi has forged a politi
cal alliance with Algeria that significantly sets back the U.S.
campaign to isolate the volatile Arab leader, diplomatic sources
disclosed yesterday.
The alliance takes the form of a political union that is due to
be announced on Nov. I. Western and Arab diplomats fear it
could represent a dramatic shift in the regional balance of power
in North Africa, where Algeria has acted as a restraining force
on Khadafi's efforts to destabilize Tunisia.
Since coming to power in 1969, Khadafi has struck union
agreements with Morocco, Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Tunisia and Al
geria. Each one failed to take effect or quickly came undone.
The Libyan leader's erratic behavior and failure to deliver on
economic promises have usually been key factors in the
repeated failure of his efforts to enlarge his political base
through agreements with other Arab countries.
But the timing of his projected union with Algeria and the cau
tious manner in which Algerian President Chadli Benjedid un
dertakes foreign commitments, have persuaded some policy
makers in Washington and Paris that the new union agreement
has to be taken as a potential threat to western interests, accord
ing to diplomatic sources.
Talks in Salvador net commission
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — After 20 hours of closed
door talks, the Salvadoran government and leftist guerrillas yes
terday agreed to form a commission to negotiate a cease-fire un
der the Central American peace plan.
The announcement was more than had been expected from
the two-day meeting, but both sides emphasized that prospects
for a cease-fire accord were slim.
Between the government and guerrilla positions, "the dis
tances are great and the contradictions are marked," guerrilla
commander Schafik Jorge Handal said.
President Jose Napoleon Duarte warned that if there is no
agreement in the next month, he will declare a unilateral cease
fire to comply with the Central American peace plan.
Duarte did not give any details of the government's plan,
which, according to military sources, the army has been drafting
for weeks.
In neighboring Nicaragua, the Sandinistas declared a uni
lateral cease-fire that goes into effect Today in three areas of the
country.
The peace plan, signed by the five Central American presi
dents Aug. 7, calls for cease-fires in the region's insurgencies,
and for amnesty programs and democratic reforms by Nov. 7.
The plan also calls for an end to foreign aid to insurgents and
says that the Central American governments will not provide
logistical or military support to the rebels of another country.
Congress bans all Iranian imports
WASHINGTON — Both the Senate and House, angered by
news that Iran is using American dollars to fund its assault on in
ternational shipping in the Persian Gulf, voted overwhelmingly
Yesterday to ban all U.S. imports of crude oil and other prod
ucts from Iran.
The legislation, which will be sent to President Reagan's desk
after differences between the House and Senate bill are re
solved, would immediately halt all imports from Iran unless the
administration requests a six-month delay. The ban would not
be lifted until Iran ends its belligerent acts against gulf shipping.
Unlike the Senate version, which passed 93-0, the House
measure would authorize the president to enter into negotiations
with other countries to convince them to join the embargo. The
House bill was adopted 407-5.
Proponents of the legislation acknowledged that it would have
little or no impact on Iran's ability to wage war. Nevertheless, it
was advocated by Republicans as well as Democrats as a sym
bolic way to express U.S. opposition to Iranian actions in the
gulf.
Japan won't send minesweepers
WASHINGTON — Japan has decided not to send mine
sweepers or coast guard vessels to help protect sea lanes in the
war-torn Persian Gulf, but will finance a new "precision naviga
tion" system to assist ships of all nations in avoiding mines
there, Japanese and U.S. officials said yesterday.
The Japanese program, to be announced by Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone this morning in Tokyo, also includes the
prospect of a substantial increase in Japan's share of the cost of
keeping 50,000 U.S. military personnel in Japan as a way to
compensate the United States for the cost of its naval escort and
mine-sweeping operations in the gulf.
The Reagan administration, which has urged Japan to take a
share of the burden of protecting the oil lifeline in the gulf, is
likely to accept the plan as a "first step" in this direction.
Nakasone had hoped to do more, U.S. officials said, but since
his five years as prime minister come to a close later this month,
"this was the best he could do."
More than half the petroleum that fuels Japan's formidable in
dustry comes from the gulf. With U.S. and West European
naval and air forces protecting gulf oil shipping — with much of
it bound for Tokyo's factories — the growing international call
for Japanese contributions has embarrassed the Nakasone gov
ernment.
Nakasone promised President Reagan in their Sept. 21
meeting in New York that he would make a decision about gulf
assistance before leaving office this month. The measures to be
announced Wednesday, following Nakasone's decision last
week to purchase a U.S. jet for the next generation Japanese
fighter-bomber rather than build a Japanese plane, were de
scribed by officials on both sides as Nakasone's final gesture to
Reagan and to U.S.-Japan relations.

tration strategy, will express support today in a speech to the
Organization of American States for a Central American peace
plan designed to end armed conflict in Nicaragua and other na
tions of the region, White House officials said yesterday.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan's
speech will "emphasize his support for the Guatemalan Plan,"
which he has previously described as "fatally flawed." The pro
posal was initiated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
The plan was adopted by presidents of the five Central Ameri
can nations, including Nicaragua, at an August meeting in
Guatemala City after the leaders rejected a rival proposal sub
mitted by Reagan and House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex.
Administration officials said that Reagan remains suspicious
of the leftist Sandinista rulers of Nicaragua but recognizes that
he must take a more conciliatory approach if he hopes to obtain
even humanitarian aid for the contra rebels opposing the gov
ernment. Secretary of State George P. Shultz has said the ad
ministration will seek an additional $270 million in military aid
for the contras.
Libya makes alliance with Algeria
PARIS — Libya's Col. Muommar Khadafi has forged a politi
cal alliance with Algeria that significantly sets back the U.S.
campaign to isolate the volatile Arab leader, diplomatic sources
disclosed yesterday.
The alliance takes the form of a political union that is due to
be announced on Nov. I. Western and Arab diplomats fear it
could represent a dramatic shift in the regional balance of power
in North Africa, where Algeria has acted as a restraining force
on Khadafi's efforts to destabilize Tunisia.
Since coming to power in 1969, Khadafi has struck union
agreements with Morocco, Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Tunisia and Al
geria. Each one failed to take effect or quickly came undone.
The Libyan leader's erratic behavior and failure to deliver on
economic promises have usually been key factors in the
repeated failure of his efforts to enlarge his political base
through agreements with other Arab countries.
But the timing of his projected union with Algeria and the cau
tious manner in which Algerian President Chadli Benjedid un
dertakes foreign commitments, have persuaded some policy
makers in Washington and Paris that the new union agreement
has to be taken as a potential threat to western interests, accord
ing to diplomatic sources.
Talks in Salvador net commission
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — After 20 hours of closed
door talks, the Salvadoran government and leftist guerrillas yes
terday agreed to form a commission to negotiate a cease-fire un
der the Central American peace plan.
The announcement was more than had been expected from
the two-day meeting, but both sides emphasized that prospects
for a cease-fire accord were slim.
Between the government and guerrilla positions, "the dis
tances are great and the contradictions are marked," guerrilla
commander Schafik Jorge Handal said.
President Jose Napoleon Duarte warned that if there is no
agreement in the next month, he will declare a unilateral cease
fire to comply with the Central American peace plan.
Duarte did not give any details of the government's plan,
which, according to military sources, the army has been drafting
for weeks.
In neighboring Nicaragua, the Sandinistas declared a uni
lateral cease-fire that goes into effect Today in three areas of the
country.
The peace plan, signed by the five Central American presi
dents Aug. 7, calls for cease-fires in the region's insurgencies,
and for amnesty programs and democratic reforms by Nov. 7.
The plan also calls for an end to foreign aid to insurgents and
says that the Central American governments will not provide
logistical or military support to the rebels of another country.
Congress bans all Iranian imports
WASHINGTON — Both the Senate and House, angered by
news that Iran is using American dollars to fund its assault on in
ternational shipping in the Persian Gulf, voted overwhelmingly
Yesterday to ban all U.S. imports of crude oil and other prod
ucts from Iran.
The legislation, which will be sent to President Reagan's desk
after differences between the House and Senate bill are re
solved, would immediately halt all imports from Iran unless the
administration requests a six-month delay. The ban would not
be lifted until Iran ends its belligerent acts against gulf shipping.
Unlike the Senate version, which passed 93-0, the House
measure would authorize the president to enter into negotiations
with other countries to convince them to join the embargo. The
House bill was adopted 407-5.
Proponents of the legislation acknowledged that it would have
little or no impact on Iran's ability to wage war. Nevertheless, it
was advocated by Republicans as well as Democrats as a sym
bolic way to express U.S. opposition to Iranian actions in the
gulf.
Japan won't send minesweepers
WASHINGTON — Japan has decided not to send mine
sweepers or coast guard vessels to help protect sea lanes in the
war-torn Persian Gulf, but will finance a new "precision naviga
tion" system to assist ships of all nations in avoiding mines
there, Japanese and U.S. officials said yesterday.
The Japanese program, to be announced by Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone this morning in Tokyo, also includes the
prospect of a substantial increase in Japan's share of the cost of
keeping 50,000 U.S. military personnel in Japan as a way to
compensate the United States for the cost of its naval escort and
mine-sweeping operations in the gulf.
The Reagan administration, which has urged Japan to take a
share of the burden of protecting the oil lifeline in the gulf, is
likely to accept the plan as a "first step" in this direction.
Nakasone had hoped to do more, U.S. officials said, but since
his five years as prime minister come to a close later this month,
"this was the best he could do."
More than half the petroleum that fuels Japan's formidable in
dustry comes from the gulf. With U.S. and West European
naval and air forces protecting gulf oil shipping — with much of
it bound for Tokyo's factories — the growing international call
for Japanese contributions has embarrassed the Nakasone gov
ernment.
Nakasone promised President Reagan in their Sept. 21
meeting in New York that he would make a decision about gulf
assistance before leaving office this month. The measures to be
announced Wednesday, following Nakasone's decision last
week to purchase a U.S. jet for the next generation Japanese
fighter-bomber rather than build a Japanese plane, were de
scribed by officials on both sides as Nakasone's final gesture to
Reagan and to U.S.-Japan relations.
