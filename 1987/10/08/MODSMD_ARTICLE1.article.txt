# Trustee quits AIDS panel
## 
### Vivian Rogers With wire reports 
The chair and vice chair of
President Reagan's AIDS com
mission resigned yesterday,
charging that the commission is
indecisive and lacks representa
tion from the health care field.
Dr. Woodrow Myers, a
recently appointed Stanford trus
tee and vice chair of the commis
sion, resigned from the embattled
panel just hours after Chair Dr.
W. Eugene Mayberry.
Knowledgeable sources said
Mayberry left because of
longstanding unhappiness with
the commission's makeup and its
"internal politics and bickering."
Myers, who was handpicked
by Mayberry for vice chair, told
The Daily last night that his deci
sion to leave the commission was
hastened by Mayberry's resigna
tion, as well as his own outside
commitments.
"I feel I can no longer be effec
tive in attempting to reach the
goals outlined in the president's
order creating the commission,"
he said.
Myers, who is also Indiana's
health commissioner, told an In
diana legislative study committee
that he hoped the individuals se
lected to replace them would
have established public health
backgrounds or experience in
caring for AIDS patients.
Myers said health profession
als were not adequately rep
resented on the panel and that it
was deadlocked on key AlDS
related issues.
"There were divisions on the
commission, both in ideology
and in personalities," he said.
Myers said last night he
worries that federal departments
such as the Department of Edu-
cation are being "led astray" on
the information about AIDS and
the policies for educating stu
dents.
He also said he had
"problems" with certain govern
ment officials but would not elab
orate.
But, Myers said, "I believe the
Health and Human Services
(employees) are doing a very tine
job."
Congressional sources said
there were personality conflicts
within the 13-member commis
sion. Mayberry told White
House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker Jr. that he would resign
unless two members (the sources
could not identify them) were
removed.
The panel, which is charged
with advising the president on a
national strategy to combat the
AIDS epidemic, is due to issue
its first report Dec. 7. Sources
said Mayberry believes the panel
is so divided that it "will never
arrive at a consensus report."
Myers has been an alumni
elected trustee since September.
He received his bachelor's in bio
logical sciences here in 1974 and
earned his MBA in 1983. As an
undergraduate, Myers was in
strumental in the founding of a

black pre-professional society.
"He seems to be a fair and ob
jective man," said Dr. Linda
Hawes Clever, a member of the
Board of Trustees. Myers is
"well-informed about issues that
deal in his field," Clever said.
The AIDS panel has been be
set with controversy since its in
ception. The White House ini
tially was criticized for resisting
pressure to appoint an openly
homosexual member to the com
mission. although a gay, Frank
Lilly, chair of genetics at the Al
bert Einstein University Medical
Center in New York, eventually
was named.
After its members were an
nounced, the commission was
further attacked for its failure to
include more individuals with

wider AIDS expertise, and for in
cluding some individuals whose
views conflict with widely ac
cepted medical evidence about
the disease.
Finally, the commission's ex
ecutive director, Linda Sheaffer,
was forced last month to resign
by some commission members â€”
against the wishes of Mayberry.
who had selected her. The ouster
appeared to undercut May
berry's authority and intensified
the turmoil within the commis
sion.
Dr. Edward Brandt Jr., chair
of the National Leadership Coali
tion on AIDS, predicted the loss
of Mayberry and Myers would
"impede the commission's effec
tiveness."
