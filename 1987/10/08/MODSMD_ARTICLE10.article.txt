# Bork may withdraw name soon

### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan,
meeting with Supreme Court nominee Robert
Bork, vowed yesterday to forge ahead with
efforts to win his Senate confirmation, but
other Republican supporters said they be
lieve Bork is wavering in the face of near
certain defeat and could withdraw as early as
today.
"The president was very strong about
staying with it, fighting it on out," said a
senior White House official after Reagan met
for 25 minutes with Bork, Vice President
George Bush, Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111 and White House chief of staff
Howard Baker Jr.
"The judge listened," the official said.
"The judge has not made a final decision."
Tom Korologos, the chief Republican lob
byist, conceded that any mathematical
chance that the Senate might yet confirm
Bork had all but disappeared after 10 more
senators came out against him yesterday. The
10, all Democrats, consisted of three who had
been undecided and seven who had been
thought to be leaning against Bork.
This raised to 48 the number of senators
who have declared their opposition to confir
mation, with nine others leaning against it,
according to a Los Angeles Times count.
Bork opponents said that they were con
centrating on getting 51 firm votes to prove to
Reagan and Bork that they have no chance.
At the same time, however, Korologos,
who attended a "sincere, honest-to-God
rally" for Bork in the office of Sen. Bob
Dole, (R-Kan.) said that the pep session had a
"salutary effect" on the nominee. "He has to

think twice about what his decision will be."
During the event, 16 senators cheered and
shouted: "Don't quit!"
As he pondered his course the day after the
Senate Judiciary Committee voted to recom
mend his rejection, Bork was left to choose
between withdrawing, to spare himself the
ordeal of a prolonged, apparently doomed,
campaign, and pressing on, to force his oppo
nents to cast recorded votes against him that
would create a potential political issue for the
1988 election.
Although the White House advocates the
latter strategy, Bork is "not a guy who is
going to be used," one source said.
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), who attended
the surprise rally and escorted the nominee
and his wife, Mary Ellen, to their car outside
the Capitol, said: "He wanted to think about
it. He wanted to talk to his wife and talk to his
children."
A longtime acquaintance of Bork, who
would speak only anonymously, noted that
the nominee is "a scrapper who takes pride in
having been a Marine and would revel in
coming back from odds as long as these. But
he's also able to step back and detach himself
for a realistic look" at the prospects.
One source said Bork's decision was ex
pected tomorrow.
The 10 announcing their opposition yester
day included seven Southern senators, a
regional group that had represented the ad
ministration's best chance for winning Demo
cratic support. They are Sens. John Breaux
of Louisiana, Lawton Chiles and Bob
Graham of Florida, Wyche Fowler Jr. of

Georgia, Albert Gore Jr. and Jim Sasser of
Tennessee and Richard Shelby of Alabama.
The other three are Sens. Kent Conrad of
North Dakota, Alan Dixon of Illinois and J.
James Exon of Nebraska.
"Judge Bork does not understand the Con
stitution," Gore, a candidate for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination, declared. "He
says he would interpret the Constitution ex
actly as the framers would have, 200 years
ago. But 2(H) years ago, black people were
property and women couldn't vote. . . . Not
only have we added amendments to our Con
stitution, we have changed the context in
which it should be read."
Fowler said he rejected Bork's "particular
form of strict construction" in interpreting
the Constitution. "It has prevented hard facts
— the actual injustices, hardships, discrimi
nation miseries and oppression experienced
by real people in an imperfect society — from
penetrating the world of pure theory," he
said.
Conrad, listing his reasons for opposing
confirmation, cited Bork's actions as solicitor
general in 1973 in firing Watergate special
prosecutor Archibald Cox on orders of then-
President Nixon.
"In my view, Robert Bork did not rise to
the challenge of restoring public confidence
in the rule of law . . Conrad said. "As a
top law enforcement officer, he acted in a
way that could have allowed massive abuse
of presidential power to go unchecked."

"The judge listened," the official said.
"The judge has not made a final decision."
Tom Korologos, the chief Republican lob
byist, conceded that any mathematical
chance that the Senate might yet confirm
Bork had all but disappeared after 10 more
senators came out against him yesterday. The
10, all Democrats, consisted of three who had
been undecided and seven who had been
thought to be leaning against Bork.
This raised to 48 the number of senators
who have declared their opposition to confir
mation, with nine others leaning against it,
according to a Los Angeles Times count.
Bork opponents said that they were con
centrating on getting 51 firm votes to prove to
Reagan and Bork that they have no chance.
At the same time, however, Korologos,
who attended a "sincere, honest-to-God
rally" for Bork in the office of Sen. Bob
Dole, (R-Kan.) said that the pep session had a
"salutary effect" on the nominee. "He has to

think twice about what his decision will be."
During the event, 16 senators cheered and
shouted: "Don't quit!"
As he pondered his course the day after the
Senate Judiciary Committee voted to recom
mend his rejection, Bork was left to choose
between withdrawing, to spare himself the
ordeal of a prolonged, apparently doomed,
campaign, and pressing on, to force his oppo
nents to cast recorded votes against him that
would create a potential political issue for the
1988 election.
Although the White House advocates the
latter strategy, Bork is "not a guy who is
going to be used," one source said.
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), who attended
the surprise rally and escorted the nominee
and his wife, Mary Ellen, to their car outside
the Capitol, said: "He wanted to think about
it. He wanted to talk to his wife and talk to his
children."
A longtime acquaintance of Bork, who
would speak only anonymously, noted that
the nominee is "a scrapper who takes pride in
having been a Marine and would revel in
coming back from odds as long as these. But
he's also able to step back and detach himself
for a realistic look" at the prospects.
One source said Bork's decision was ex
pected tomorrow.
The 10 announcing their opposition yester
day included seven Southern senators, a
regional group that had represented the ad
ministration's best chance for winning Demo
cratic support. They are Sens. John Breaux
of Louisiana, Lawton Chiles and Bob
Graham of Florida, Wyche Fowler Jr. of

Georgia, Albert Gore Jr. and Jim Sasser of
Tennessee and Richard Shelby of Alabama.
The other three are Sens. Kent Conrad of
North Dakota, Alan Dixon of Illinois and J.
James Exon of Nebraska.
"Judge Bork does not understand the Con
stitution," Gore, a candidate for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination, declared. "He
says he would interpret the Constitution ex
actly as the framers would have, 200 years
ago. But 2(H) years ago, black people were
property and women couldn't vote. . . . Not
only have we added amendments to our Con
stitution, we have changed the context in
which it should be read."
Fowler said he rejected Bork's "particular
form of strict construction" in interpreting
the Constitution. "It has prevented hard facts
— the actual injustices, hardships, discrimi
nation miseries and oppression experienced
by real people in an imperfect society — from
penetrating the world of pure theory," he
said.
Conrad, listing his reasons for opposing
confirmation, cited Bork's actions as solicitor
general in 1973 in firing Watergate special
prosecutor Archibald Cox on orders of then-
President Nixon.
"In my view, Robert Bork did not rise to
the challenge of restoring public confidence
in the rule of law . . Conrad said. "As a
top law enforcement officer, he acted in a
way that could have allowed massive abuse
of presidential power to go unchecked."

WASHINGTON — President Reagan,
meeting with Supreme Court nominee Robert
Bork, vowed yesterday to forge ahead with
efforts to win his Senate confirmation, but
other Republican supporters said they be
lieve Bork is wavering in the face of near
certain defeat and could withdraw as early as
today.
"The president was very strong about
staying with it, fighting it on out," said a
senior White House official after Reagan met
for 25 minutes with Bork, Vice President
George Bush, Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111 and White House chief of staff
Howard Baker Jr.
