# Campus being sprayed to eliminate Oriental fruit fly
## 
### Michael Chen 
County health officials have
begun spraying insecticides on
selected campus trees to combat
an infestation of Oriental fruit
tlies in the area.
Yesterday marked the first day
of a three-month plan by the
Santa Clara County Agricultural
Commission and the California
Department of Food and
Agriculture to spray campus
trees to eradicate the infestation.
The spraying will occur daily
for an entire week and will be fol
lowed by another week without
spraying. This application cycle
will be repeated at least three
times.
Later in the season the cycle
may be extended to adapt to the
fruit fly's longer lifespan during
colder weather. Officials have set
up additional traps in the area to
monitor the insects' population.
If the traps show no indication of
continued infestation by early
December — or after three
generations of fruit flies — then
the spraying will stop.
The insecticide contains
Diprom, an organic phosphate
that is highly toxic to Oriental

fruit flies, and methyl eugenol, a
sex lure for male flies.
Although the toxin in the in
secticide is highly effective,
"There's such a small amount in
there it represents no health haz
ard to pets, animals and
humans," according to John
Connell, program supervisor of
the California Department of
Food and Agriculture. He added
that workers stop spraying when
people are walking near the tar
geted trees.

It represents no
health hazard to
humans/

State workers will use a pistol
attached to a tank to spray a
small amount of insecticide onto
local trees about every 200 feet.
They spray the insecticide at
least six feet high to minimize
chances of contact with humans
and animals.
Connell said the spraying "is
based on trapping results. Treat
ment will cover at least three

generations of negative entrap
ment — that's our goal."'
The spraying was precipitated
by the Sept. 28 discovery of a
fruit fly in a trap that the state
regularly maintains. Another
fruit fly was found in a trap on
College Avenue in Palo Alto.
"The reproductive capacity of
this fly is si> great that if you
catch two, that indicates a major
infestation," Connell said.
The area to be sprayed covers
7.5 square miles and includes
most of campus and part of Palo
Alto. If the infestation were
allowed to spread, the damage to
California produce could amount
to "hundreds of millions of dol
lars," Connell said. The exter
mination process is expected to
cost between $80,000 and
$100,000.
According to Herb Fongof the
Stanford Operations, Mainte
nance and Utilities Department,
this is the first time that the
campus has experienced an
Oriental fruit fly infestation.
Connell said he suspects that
the fruit tlies came into the area
by way of fruit shipped through
first-class mail that cannot be in
spected.


Nearly the entire Stanford campus, and large sections of Palo Alto, are being sprayed with insecicide in an at
tempt to combat suspected fruit fly infestation.
