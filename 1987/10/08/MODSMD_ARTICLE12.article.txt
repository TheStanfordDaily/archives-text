## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Policy is inadequate 
### 
Every first-year law student is aware that a
rule without a remedy is essentially worthless.
The administration at Stanford Law School,
however, does not appear to be so aware.
The Law School's stated non-discrimination
policy lacks effective enforcement procedures
and well-defined sanctions, rendering it illusory
and inadequate.
Last week, several law students convened a
special meeting to discuss the fact that a major
law firm, Baker & McKenzie, had not been
prohibited from recruiting at the Law School
despite the fact that a former Baker & McKenzie
attorney filed a claim, which the New York State
Department of Human Rights preliminarily
deemed meritorious, charging he had been fired
for having AIDS.
The Baker & McKenzie case has revealed the
inadequacy of the Law School's non
discrimination policy. The policy does not define
discriminatory conduct, specify what amount of
evidence is required to support a conclusion of
discrimination or name sanctions.
Law School Assoc. Dean Tom Mc√üride
argued that nothing short of a court ruling that a
firm has discriminated would induce the Law
School to bar a firm from recruiting. But most al
legations of discrimination never receive a day in

court. This is especially true when recruiting at
torneys make gratuitous and offensive remarks
to women and minority students. This has been
the typical allegation of discrimination in the
past.
The Law School's non-discrimination policy
should provide for an internal adjudicative pro
cedure in such cases that would be open to the
public. Such a procedure would provide a fair
hearing for the aggrieved student, as well as of
fer an effective way to determine whether an em
ployer has violated the Law School's policy.
In a case external to the Law School, such as
the AIDS discrimination claim against Baker &
McKenzie, a decision by a state human rights
agency or the federal Equal Employment Oppor
tunity Commission that the claim appears
meritorious ought to be sufficient for the Law
School to ban the firm from using its services
and facilities.
The school's policy should also provide for
specific sanctions tailored to the nature and ex
tent of the offense, including severe penalties for
repeat offenders.
In order to ensure that its policy is not merely
an empty promise, the Law School needs to
revise its policy to provide for open and well
defined enforcement procedures and sanctions.
