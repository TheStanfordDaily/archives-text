Despite the summer's frantic and heady ac
tivities — academic discovery, personal
growth and steamy short-lived romances — I
had the opportunity to keep a finger on the
pulse of American culture by way of the mass
media. Simply put, I saw more than a few
movies and watched quite a lot of television.

I also made the obligatory effort to stay
abreast of the daily news of the world, and al
though I was undoubtedly only marginally
sucessful in this effort, I was struck by an in
teresting and disturbing trend in ihe col
lective American sensibility which, on fur
ther reflection, I have concluded has existed
for quite some time.
A scene from this summer's blockbuster,
"The Untouchables," provides some illustra
tion: Mobster Al Capone is sitting in his
luxurious office surrounded by a personal en
tourage of manicurists, hairstylists, atten
dants and other lackeys, as well as not a few
fawning newspaper reporters.
The reporters laugh seemingly on cue at
Capone's stabs at the forces of law and order,
and they lap up the fabricated denials of any
wrongdoing. The audience is at once amused
and appalled; Capone is charming, but he is
also a ruthless criminal.
As the film progresses we see variations of
the same scene; the public and press playing
right into the hands of a criminal. The truth
seems so obvious to those who care to look
for it, and yet so many seem blinded by the

charm, bravado and glamorous lifestyle of
the criminal. They fail to see that it is they
who must ultimately pay for the luxury
Capone enjoys.
The scenes in"The Untouchables" may
seem unrealistic or overdone. The press and
general public aren't that gullible, that easily
dazzled, that dimwitted. One would hope so.
However, in light of recent events, sucn con
viction may well elude the thoughtful obser
ver.
I saw "The Untouchables" as the Iran
contra debacle was really heating up on the
nightly news. As evidence mounted, and the
congressional hearings drew out incriminat
ing testimony and contradictory denials from
top military and executive officials, the cer
tainty and the magnitude of the crimes
became inescapable.
Finally we found the culprit — or at least
everyone had a whipping post. If Lt. Col.
North was telling the truth, the entire affair
was his fault.
He confessed, justice could be served and
the guilty punished.
Or so I thought.
The events that followed proved this as
sumption to be quite wrong. Not only did
North not become a whipping post, but he
turned into a national hero! Olliemania swept
the country. The public was that gullible, that
easily dazzled, that dimwitted.
The parallels between the aftermath of
North's testimony before Congress and Al
Capone's success in deceiving the press and
public in"The Untouchables" are fairly
obivous.
Granted, North is not a mobster, but the
implications of his actions for society are per
haps as insidious. Both men knowingly
diregarded the law; and given the present mil
itary posture of Iran it is difficult to maintain
that Capone's crimes cost more in human

carnage and suffering than did North's.
One can argue questions of intent; and
indeed the semi-fictional Capone's intent was
more vile than North's, hut North's actions
can he compared to firing a rifle into a res
taraunt to get someone's attention — the in
tent is not to harm anyone, hut the act dis
plays an attitude of reckless indifference.
In legal terms, North's actions could best
be termed negligence of the most severe
degree. Given this fact, why Olliemania?
Part of the answer seems to lie in a long
standing disposition of Americans to glorify
crime and criminals. Perhaps this tendency is
rooted in America's history as a nation of
successful rebels against established imperial
authority. Heroes of the Revolution defied
the law in such feats of daring as the Boston
Tea Party even before war was declared.
In any case, it is clear that a glorification of
crime is a part of American folklore. This
folklore includes a veritable rogues' gallery of
murderers, thieves, confidence artists, smug
glers, pirates and persons of ill repute. Al
Capone, Billy the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde,
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and the
Dukes of Hazzard are, of course, only a frac
tion of the real and fictional criminals
glorified in song and legend.
Indeed, a 19th century railroad tycoon,
after whose son a prestigious California uni
versity is named, has been refered to more
than once as a "robber baron," and not with
out reason.
Ronald Reagan once said that ours was not
a nation without heroes. Perhaps he was cor
rect, for it certainly is not without criminals.
When Bernard Goetz, Ivan Boesky and
Oliver North are the celebrities of the day, it
seems it is time to choose our heroes more
carefully.
