## 'Cultural literacy' lacks purpose 
### 
"Cultural literacy" is in. I
mean really in. In past summers
we've had Lee laccoca, the
"Official Preppie Handbook"
and tofutti (my personal favor
ite). We've also had countless
reports, "crises" and task forces
on the frequently mediocre state
of American education. But
never before have we had such a
combination of the scholarly and
the hyped, the tofutti and the
lecture hall.

For those of you who missed
the uproar, it all started with two
books, both by university profes
sors, both unlikely candidates for
best-sellerdom: "The Closing of
the American Mind" by a Uni
versity of Chicago philosophy
professor named Allen Bloom
and "Cultural Literacy" by E.D.
Hirsch of the University of Vir
ginia. The basic argument of both
books is that education is failing
in America, high school students
don't know what they should,
universities have abandoned
their proper function.
Bloom's book, the more
serious of the two, argues that in
the 1960s universities gave up
their traditional role as the pur

veyors of a canon of "classic"
literary works and values in pur
suit of "relevance." Plato gave
way to feminist and various eth
nic studies; Aristotle became lost
in a maze of "social studies" that
replaced philosophy and history.
At the heart of Bloom's cri
tique is a disdain for what is
usually referred to as "moral
relativism," that is, the belief
that there are no intrinsic values
of worth, quality, good and evil,
but instead only a series of
equally valued ideas and
ideologies.
The argument is that relativism
saps a society's internal strength
and the individual's ability to act
in an ethical, socially productive
and, well, just plain "good"
manner. For Bloom, the key to
recapturing a clear distinction be
tween good and evil lies with the
accepted Western classics — that
$300 worth of paperbacks that
every Stanford (if it's Tuesday,
this must the"The Iliad") fresh
man plows through.
Bloom overlooks the fact that
there is no infallible, handy
dandy, all-purpose guide to the
"good" (a sort of "Everything
You Always Wanted to Know
About Virtue But Had Too Many
Midterms to Ask"). Look at
Plato, look at Voltaire, look at
Cervantes, look at (well, on
second thought, maybe just look

at the Cliff Notes) Nietzsche.
They're positively dripping with
"relativism" — if by that we
mean an acknowledgement of
more than one way of viewing
the world, of seeing the world as
relative.
But, hey, if Bloom s book gets
people talking about education
and putting new emphasis in uni
versities on ethics and questions
of individual right and wrong
(even if there aren't the black and
white answers that Bloom
paints), what the hell, why not?
Well, for one thing there is
value in the sort of interdiscipli
nary social science programs that
Bloom skewers. If Germain
Greer or George Will or Herbert
Marcuse gets you thinking about
your own life and values why not
go for it? The point is that the
purpose of the humanities, is
supposedly to get you thinking
about the nature of the human
being ("human" and
"humanities," cute how that
works out, huh?) and about the
life of the human mind. Though
an important part, there's more
to the mind than just Aristotle
and Plato.
What it basically comes down
to is that these classics don't
serve that humanistic function by
themselves. What's important is
the interaction between the

reader and the book. That is,
these books, no matter how bril
liant they may be, can't be an end
in themselves. They can only be
a means to begin thinking about
and questioning our own lives
and assumptions. Being able to
quote "Hamlet" won't do you
much go unless you make the
connection between "Hamlet"
and the life about you.
And that's where Hirsch, in
the summer's second big cultural
literacy book, misses the point.
For Hirsch ends with a huge list
of names, sayings and dates that
we should all supposedly have
heard of in order to be
"culturally literate."
But who really cares if I can
tell you who Greta Garbo is?
What good does it do me to su
perficially have heard of Don
Quixote if I've neither read the
book nor used it to examine my
own life? Hirsch's list is kind of
fun, sort of an upscale Trivial
Pursuit, but it has about as much
to do with education as Joan Col
lins has to do with marital bliss.
Now the cry is over a lack of
skill in the humanities. The gen
eral problem's still the same.
Now, it's just been covered with
tofutti and become the hit of the
beach. Anyone for a pet rock?

in a maze of "social studies" that
replaced philosophy and history.
At the heart of Bloom's cri
tique is a disdain for what is
usually referred to as "moral
relativism," that is, the belief
that there are no intrinsic values
of worth, quality, good and evil,
but instead only a series of
equally valued ideas and
ideologies.
The argument is that relativism
saps a society's internal strength
and the individual's ability to act
in an ethical, socially productive
and, well, just plain "good"
manner. For Bloom, the key to
recapturing a clear distinction be
tween good and evil lies with the
accepted Western classics — that
$300 worth of paperbacks that
every Stanford (if it's Tuesday,
this must the"The Iliad") fresh
man plows through.
Bloom overlooks the fact that
there is no infallible, handy
dandy, all-purpose guide to the
"good" (a sort of "Everything
You Always Wanted to Know
About Virtue But Had Too Many
Midterms to Ask"). Look at
Plato, look at Voltaire, look at
Cervantes, look at (well, on
second thought, maybe just look

at the Cliff Notes) Nietzsche.
They're positively dripping with
"relativism" — if by that we
mean an acknowledgement of
more than one way of viewing
the world, of seeing the world as
relative.
But, hey, if Bloom s book gets
people talking about education
and putting new emphasis in uni
versities on ethics and questions
of individual right and wrong
(even if there aren't the black and
white answers that Bloom
paints), what the hell, why not?
Well, for one thing there is
value in the sort of interdiscipli
nary social science programs that
Bloom skewers. If Germain
Greer or George Will or Herbert
Marcuse gets you thinking about
your own life and values why not
go for it? The point is that the
purpose of the humanities, is
supposedly to get you thinking
about the nature of the human
being ("human" and
"humanities," cute how that
works out, huh?) and about the
life of the human mind. Though
an important part, there's more
to the mind than just Aristotle
and Plato.
What it basically comes down
to is that these classics don't
serve that humanistic function by
themselves. What's important is
the interaction between the

reader and the book. That is,
these books, no matter how bril
liant they may be, can't be an end
in themselves. They can only be
a means to begin thinking about
and questioning our own lives
and assumptions. Being able to
quote "Hamlet" won't do you
much go unless you make the
connection between "Hamlet"
and the life about you.
And that's where Hirsch, in
the summer's second big cultural
literacy book, misses the point.
For Hirsch ends with a huge list
of names, sayings and dates that
we should all supposedly have
heard of in order to be
"culturally literate."
But who really cares if I can
tell you who Greta Garbo is?
What good does it do me to su
perficially have heard of Don
Quixote if I've neither read the
book nor used it to examine my
own life? Hirsch's list is kind of
fun, sort of an upscale Trivial
Pursuit, but it has about as much
to do with education as Joan Col
lins has to do with marital bliss.
Now the cry is over a lack of
skill in the humanities. The gen
eral problem's still the same.
Now, it's just been covered with
tofutti and become the hit of the
beach. Anyone for a pet rock?

"Cultural literacy" is in. I
mean really in. In past summers
we've had Lee laccoca, the
"Official Preppie Handbook"
and tofutti (my personal favor
ite). We've also had countless
reports, "crises" and task forces
on the frequently mediocre state
of American education. But
never before have we had such a
combination of the scholarly and
the hyped, the tofutti and the
lecture hall.

For those of you who missed
the uproar, it all started with two
books, both by university profes
sors, both unlikely candidates for
best-sellerdom: "The Closing of
the American Mind" by a Uni
versity of Chicago philosophy
professor named Allen Bloom
and "Cultural Literacy" by E.D.
Hirsch of the University of Vir
ginia. The basic argument of both
books is that education is failing
in America, high school students
don't know what they should,
universities have abandoned
their proper function.
Bloom's book, the more
serious of the two, argues that in
the 1960s universities gave up
their traditional role as the pur

veyors of a canon of "classic"
literary works and values in pur
suit of "relevance." Plato gave
way to feminist and various eth
nic studies; Aristotle became lost
in a maze of "social studies" that
replaced philosophy and history.
