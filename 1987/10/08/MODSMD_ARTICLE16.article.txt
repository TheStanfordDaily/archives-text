Progress not
stalled on
Area One change
Friday's Daily proclaims in
hold headlines that the "Western
Culture debate is stalled." The
article under the headline is a
report of Thursday's meeting of
the Faculty Senate at which the
annual report of the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies (CUS)
was presented.
One line in the report stated
that the results of the evaluation
of last spring's experimental
third quarter alternative Western
culture course weie not known to
CUS as of September. This is not
surprising since there has been
no meeting of CUS since the con
clusion of last spring quarter.
There is no justification from
the CUS report or the proceed
ings of the Faculty Senate
meeting for the claim that
"Western Culture Debate is
Stalled." It is also blatant mis
reporting to claim in the opening
sentence "... members of the
Faculty Senate expressed con
cern about the IWestern Culture

Program | Committee's progress
in suggesting revisions of the
Western Culture program." No
such statements were made in
the meeting.
Quite to the contrary of your
headline, the Task Force on Area
One report has been submitted to
the Provost and to CUS. It was
extensively discussed at the
Western Culture Faculty Sympo
sium, and it is the main agenda
item for the first meeting of CUS
for 1987-88.
Consideration of revisions for
the Western Culture program is
proceeding apace, and it is hoped
that it will benefit from con
structive involvement of both
faculty and students. A valuable
atmosphere of cooperation in this
important task is ill served by in
flammatory, erroneous head
lines.
Fortunately, the same issue of
The Daily carries an article
("Agenda optimistic about West
ern Culture changes") that gives
a more accurate view of the proc
ess we'll be engaged in this quar
ter with respect to reviewing of
the recommendations of the Area
One Task Force.
