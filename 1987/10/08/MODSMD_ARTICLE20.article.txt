## Bike Aid '87 Cyclists ride to combat poverty 
### David Dirks 
It was a crisp, sunny day in
Seattle this June 17 when 36
bicyclists stood on a pier and
dipped their tires in the Pacific to
start their trek across the
country.
That same day, groups also
headed off from Portland, Ore.,
San Francisco and Los Angeles.
A month later, a group leaving
Austin, Texas pushed the total
amount of riders to 150.
The event was Bike Aid '87,
started last year by Stanford stu
dent Sean Skelton. Organizers
call the event the "largest cross
country bike-a-thon in America's
history."
Putting their bodies to the test,
the bicyclists covered as much as
3600 miles, raising money to
combat poverty around the
globe.
At present, over $220,000 has
been collected through pledges to
the cyclists. The total is expected
to reach at least $280,000 when
all the donations are in.
This year the annual ride
raised three times as much
money as Bike Aid '86, and in
cluded twice as many cyclists.
"The first few weeks were
painful," said David Strelneck,
leader of the Seattle route. He
added, however, that "this has
been the best summer I have ever
had."
"The weather varied a lot. We
biked through days of rain and

lightning in North Dakota. While
all the cars had pulled over to the
side of the road, we continued to
ride," he said.
After almost two months of
riding, all five groups converged
in Washington, D.C., and rode
together to New York, where a
celebration was held at the
United Nations hosted by UNI
- the United Nations' Inter
national Children's Emergency
Fund.
Kimberly Cox, one of the na
tional coordinators of Bike Aid
'87, called this year's ride a great
success, "especially for riders
personally. Doing everything to
gether you learn a lot about
working with people."
"In the long run, Bike Aid
leaves people very disturbed . . .
knowing that so much is in their
hands," said National Coordina
tor Mary Beth Kroetch. She ex
plained that the riders placed a
great deal of importance on what
they were doing. "That's the
best thing about it."
Most accommodations for the
bicyclists were donated by
churches, schools and groups
such as the Lions Club. Other ex
penses incurred by the event
were paid for by large private
donations. Nearly 100 percent of
the pledge money remained for
aid projects.
Tne bicyclists came from all
over the United States, as well as
India, Japan, China and England.
They ranged in age from 15 to 60,

and in ability from those who had
never bicycled before to an Eng
lish group that was making a
world cycling tour.
Although Bike Aid's organi
zers are reluctant to expand the
ride into other countries for fear
of being unable to properly or
ganize it, a group of five
Americans this year rode from
Warsaw, Poland, to London.
They then flew to Washington,
where they joined Bike Aid
riders for the East Coast seg
ment.
The Bike Aid network is
composed of almost a 100 organi
zers, most of them volunteers.
Cox described the job of national
coordinator as requiring "25

hours of work a day."
"The most difficult part was
finding volunteers. On campus
we have an advantage, but off
campus it just wasn't there ... if
we'd had more hands, we could
have accomplished more." Cox
said.
The ride is sponsored by the
Overseas Development Net
work, a national student organi
zation. The organization, accord
ing to its promotional literature,
exists to "promote student in
volvement in low-cost, long-term
international development ef
forts."
