## Bike Aid '87 Cyclists ride to combat poverty 
### David Dirks 
It was a crisp, sunny day in
Seattle this June 17 when 36
bicyclists stood on a pier and
dipped their tires in the Pacific to
start their trek across the
country.
That same day, groups also
headed off from Portland, Ore.,
San Francisco and Los Angeles.
A month later, a group leaving
Austin, Texas pushed the total
amount of riders to 150.
The event was Bike Aid '87,
started last year by Stanford stu
dent Sean Skelton. Organizers
call the event the "largest cross
country bike-a-thon in America's
history."
Putting their bodies to the test,
the bicyclists covered as much as
3600 miles, raising money to
combat poverty around the
globe.
At present, over $220,000 has
been collected through pledges to
the cyclists. The total is expected
to reach at least $280,000 when
all the donations are in.
This year the annual ride
raised three times as much
money as Bike Aid '86, and in
cluded twice as many cyclists.
"The first few weeks were
painful," said David Strelneck,
leader of the Seattle route. He
added, however, that "this has
been the best summer I have ever
had."
"The weather varied a lot. We
biked through days of rain and

lightning in North Dakota. While
all the cars had pulled over to the
side of the road, we continued to
ride," he said.
After almost two months of
riding, all five groups converged
in Washington, D.C., and rode
together to New York, where a
celebration was held at the
United Nations hosted by UNI
- the United Nations' Inter
national Children's Emergency
Fund.
Kimberly Cox, one of the na
tional coordinators of Bike Aid
'87, called this year's ride a great
success, "especially for riders
personally. Doing everything to
gether you learn a lot about
working with people."
"In the long run, Bike Aid
leaves people very disturbed . . .
knowing that so much is in their
hands," said National Coordina
tor Mary Beth Kroetch. She ex
plained that the riders placed a
great deal of importance on what
they were doing. "That's the
best thing about it."
Most accommodations for the
bicyclists were donated by
churches, schools and groups
such as the Lions Club. Other ex
penses incurred by the event
were paid for by large private
donations. Nearly 100 percent of
the pledge money remained for
aid projects.
Tne bicyclists came from all
over the United States, as well as
India, Japan, China and England.
They ranged in age from 15 to 60,

and in ability from those who had
never bicycled before to an Eng
lish group that was making a
world cycling tour.
Although Bike Aid's organi
zers are reluctant to expand the
ride into other countries for fear
of being unable to properly or
ganize it, a group of five
Americans this year rode from
Warsaw, Poland, to London.
They then flew to Washington,
where they joined Bike Aid
riders for the East Coast seg
ment.
The Bike Aid network is
composed of almost a 100 organi
zers, most of them volunteers.
Cox described the job of national
coordinator as requiring "25

hours of work a day."
"The most difficult part was
finding volunteers. On campus
we have an advantage, but off
campus it just wasn't there ... if
we'd had more hands, we could
have accomplished more." Cox
said.
The ride is sponsored by the
Overseas Development Net
work, a national student organi
zation. The organization, accord
ing to its promotional literature,
exists to "promote student in
volvement in low-cost, long-term
international development ef
forts."
Half of the money raised will

the world.
go to self-help projects spon
sored by the Overseas Develop
ment Network in Africa, Asia
and Latin America. The rest is to
be divided between Oxfam
America, an international devel
opment agency, self-help proj
ects in Appalachia, a Latin
American internship program for
college students and interna
tional organizations working to
combat hunger and poverty.
While touring poverty-stricken
areas of the country, a number of
the cyclists said they were dis
turbed that most of the money
raised by Bike Aid would go to
Third World countries, and very
little of it to aid the poverty they
came into contact with in the
U.S.
According to Kroetch, the
same amount of money goes fur
ther toward aiding Third World
countries than at home. "It
would take so much to make a

difference (in America)" because
billions of dollars in aid have al
ready been raised to combat
poverty, she added.
The Overseas Development
Network contributes funds
primarily to grass roots organiza
tions, rather than to larger aid
programs.
Sharla Fett, one of the coor
dinates of Bike Aid, said that
"it's not an either/or situation.
People are much more globally
connected than we realize."
"We were really trying to
stress the educational side," said
Janet Gwilyn, a rider on the
Portland route, as well as a coor
dinator for the ride.
In order to expose riders to the
reality of poverty, organizers set
up visits to food banks, reserva
tions and shelters.
They also volunteered at proj
ects on their rest days. Educa
tional presentations were given
by the group at some of the
towns they visited, and riders sat
in on lectures in some others.

Strelneck said that the media
focused on the actual ride even
though the participants tried to
emphasize the purpose of the
program. His group decided to
answer the most often asked
question, "What has been the
most difficult part of the ride?"
by saying "Getting the media to
cover why we're doing it."
A few accidents occurred, but,
as Gwilyn said, "People were so
generous, even in the cities."
She said her point was proven
when, after a woman rider was
hit by a drunk motorcyclist
outside of Reno, Nev., a local
bicycle shop offered to fix her
bike for free. After spending a
day in the hospital, she continued
the ride.
With the summer of '87 over,
plans for Bike Aid '88 are already
under way. "This is a very cru
cial year," Kroetch said, ex
plaining that the first two years
were very formative, and that '88
will lay a foundation for rides to
come. Kroetch will be riding with
Bike Aid in '88, as she did in '86.

Roughly 150 riders cycled across the United States this past summer as
part of "Bike Aid '87. The event raised money to combat poverty around
the world.
go to self-help projects spon
sored by the Overseas Develop
ment Network in Africa, Asia
and Latin America. The rest is to
be divided between Oxfam
America, an international devel
opment agency, self-help proj
ects in Appalachia, a Latin
American internship program for
college students and interna
tional organizations working to
combat hunger and poverty.
While touring poverty-stricken
areas of the country, a number of
the cyclists said they were dis
turbed that most of the money
raised by Bike Aid would go to
Third World countries, and very
little of it to aid the poverty they
came into contact with in the
U.S.
According to Kroetch, the
same amount of money goes fur
ther toward aiding Third World
countries than at home. "It
would take so much to make a

difference (in America)" because
billions of dollars in aid have al
ready been raised to combat
poverty, she added.
The Overseas Development
Network contributes funds
primarily to grass roots organiza
tions, rather than to larger aid
programs.
Sharla Fett, one of the coor
dinates of Bike Aid, said that
"it's not an either/or situation.
People are much more globally
connected than we realize."
"We were really trying to
stress the educational side," said
Janet Gwilyn, a rider on the
Portland route, as well as a coor
dinator for the ride.
In order to expose riders to the
reality of poverty, organizers set
up visits to food banks, reserva
tions and shelters.
They also volunteered at proj
ects on their rest days. Educa
tional presentations were given
by the group at some of the
towns they visited, and riders sat
in on lectures in some others.

Strelneck said that the media
focused on the actual ride even
though the participants tried to
emphasize the purpose of the
program. His group decided to
answer the most often asked
question, "What has been the
most difficult part of the ride?"
by saying "Getting the media to
cover why we're doing it."
A few accidents occurred, but,
as Gwilyn said, "People were so
generous, even in the cities."
She said her point was proven
when, after a woman rider was
hit by a drunk motorcyclist
outside of Reno, Nev., a local
bicycle shop offered to fix her
bike for free. After spending a
day in the hospital, she continued
the ride.
With the summer of '87 over,
plans for Bike Aid '88 are already
under way. "This is a very cru
cial year," Kroetch said, ex
plaining that the first two years
were very formative, and that '88
will lay a foundation for rides to
come. Kroetch will be riding with
Bike Aid in '88, as she did in '86.
It was a crisp, sunny day in
Seattle this June 17 when 36
bicyclists stood on a pier and
dipped their tires in the Pacific to
start their trek across the
country.
That same day, groups also
headed off from Portland, Ore.,
San Francisco and Los Angeles.
A month later, a group leaving
Austin, Texas pushed the total
amount of riders to 150.
The event was Bike Aid '87,
started last year by Stanford stu
dent Sean Skelton. Organizers
call the event the "largest cross
country bike-a-thon in America's
history."
Putting their bodies to the test,
the bicyclists covered as much as
3600 miles, raising money to
combat poverty around the
globe.
At present, over $220,000 has
been collected through pledges to
the cyclists. The total is expected
to reach at least $280,000 when
all the donations are in.
This year the annual ride
raised three times as much
money as Bike Aid '86, and in
cluded twice as many cyclists.
"The first few weeks were
painful," said David Strelneck,
leader of the Seattle route. He
added, however, that "this has
been the best summer I have ever
had."
"The weather varied a lot. We
biked through days of rain and

lightning in North Dakota. While
all the cars had pulled over to the
side of the road, we continued to
ride," he said.
After almost two months of
riding, all five groups converged
in Washington, D.C., and rode
together to New York, where a
celebration was held at the
United Nations hosted by UNI
- the United Nations' Inter
national Children's Emergency
Fund.
Kimberly Cox, one of the na
tional coordinators of Bike Aid
'87, called this year's ride a great
success, "especially for riders
personally. Doing everything to
gether you learn a lot about
working with people."
"In the long run, Bike Aid
leaves people very disturbed . . .
knowing that so much is in their
hands," said National Coordina
tor Mary Beth Kroetch. She ex
plained that the riders placed a
great deal of importance on what
they were doing. "That's the
best thing about it."
Most accommodations for the
bicyclists were donated by
churches, schools and groups
such as the Lions Club. Other ex
penses incurred by the event
were paid for by large private
donations. Nearly 100 percent of
the pledge money remained for
aid projects.
Tne bicyclists came from all
over the United States, as well as
India, Japan, China and England.
They ranged in age from 15 to 60,

and in ability from those who had
never bicycled before to an Eng
lish group that was making a
world cycling tour.
Although Bike Aid's organi
zers are reluctant to expand the
ride into other countries for fear
of being unable to properly or
ganize it, a group of five
Americans this year rode from
Warsaw, Poland, to London.
They then flew to Washington,
where they joined Bike Aid
riders for the East Coast seg
ment.
The Bike Aid network is
composed of almost a 100 organi
zers, most of them volunteers.
Cox described the job of national
coordinator as requiring "25

hours of work a day."
"The most difficult part was
finding volunteers. On campus
we have an advantage, but off
campus it just wasn't there ... if
we'd had more hands, we could
have accomplished more." Cox
said.
The ride is sponsored by the
Overseas Development Net
work, a national student organi
zation. The organization, accord
ing to its promotional literature,
exists to "promote student in
