# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM

When at Rice . . .
Rice University's freshman orienta
tion includes an event called Matricula
tion, which marks the formal enrollment
of the freshman class. The Matriculation
ceremony has traditionally been charac
terized by "rowdy cheers and chants,"
most engineered by several of the eight
residential colleges in which freshmen
are housed, according to The Rice
Thresher student newspaper.
This year, however, school officials
wanted to tone down behavior at the cer
emony. Originally the university's vice
president for student affairs placed a
complete ban on cheering at Matricula
tion, but the ban was subsequently
lifted.
Orientation Week coordinators in turn
agreed to reduce the duration of cheers
and remove obscenities and derogatory
references to other colleges.
Three of the eight colleges cooperated
in the effort. Two opted for silent forms
of cheer, including wearing festive
Mardi Gras masks. The other used an
edited version of its college cheer, in
serting university President George
Rupp's last name in place of the tradi

tional string of profanities.
The five other residential colleges all
cheered out loud, repeating college
names and singing songs.

Stanford may have an unguaranteed
year, but at least the University houses
all its freshman. The same can't be said
for the University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor.
Faced with a 112-percent occupancy
rate in residence halls, Michigan has
been forced to convert 402 double rooms
into triples and lodge 15 students in the
lounges of residence halls.
The University of Texas in Austin is
having similar difficulties. About 170 UT
students are living in dormitory study
rooms while they wait for space to open
in the university's crowded residence
halls.
Neither the displaced students nor
school officials know when the situation
will change. The problem apparently is a
common one at UT. In the past students
have remained in study rooms for as
long as an entire semester.
But Don Wisthuff, the associate direc

tor of business services for the univer
sity's Housing and Food Service office,
had reassuring words for the students
living in study rooms.
He said the university overbooks its
residences because there are always
some students who cancel their leases.
"There'll be students who'll withdraw
from their classes due to catastrophes or
homesickness," he said.

Every other year, when the Stanford
Band travels to UC-Berkeley's
Memorial Stadium to perform in Big
Game, the Band braces itself for an all
out assault by Cal students throwing,
shooting, slingshotting and funnelating
fruit from the stands.
Apparently it's not just Stanford that
inspires this unique and highly mature
behavior on the part of Cal students. An
article in the USC Daily Trojan (sounds
like a form of birth control) student
newspaper late last month bemoaned the
hazards faced by the mighty Trojan
Marching Band whenever it visits
Berkeley.

The article reported that band mem
bers have suffered myriad injuries — in
cluding split lips (definitely a problem
for trumpeters), cut hands, knee sprains
and concussions dark — after being hit
by frozen fruit and vegetables. Two
band members have been taken to the
hospital since I9KI.
The offending items included eggs,
potatoes, tomatoes and even artichokes.
"Everywhere we go, every rally we
do . . . people try to nail us with fruit
and eggs," said Jack Swaton, the
trombone section leader for the Trojan
Marching Band. "Very few get us . . .
but there are enough direct hits to make
you want to kick 'em in the teeth."
But Cal students say that campus fra
ternities are to blame. "It's the frater
nity types that bring the fruit into the
stadium and all the students pick up on
the idea," said Gary Caffey, a Cal
junior. "The object of the tomatoes was
to have it stick in the bristles of the old
USC helmets. They did it in fun, not to
harm anyone."
But USC officials say the problem lies
with the whole Cal student section at
games. "They are the most undis
ciplined rooting section in the United

States," said Arthur Bartner, director of
the marching hand.
"Until the Berkeley administration is
willing to go into their rooting section
the minute fruit starts to fly, yanking the
people out and suspending them, it's just
going to continue until someone gets
seriously hurt."

Members of the Delta Delta Delta
sorority at Washington State University
in Pullman were alarmed late in August
when they woke up one morning to find
"a hunch of people" running through
their house, the Daily Evergreen student
newspaper reported.
"Some people, 1 don't want to spec
ulate who, entered the house and stole
some underwear and a calculator," Offi
cer Rick Peringer of the Pullman Police
Department said.
Peringer estimated that the total value
of the stolen items was about $235 — $50
for the calculator and $185 for the under
wear.
The case is under investigation.
