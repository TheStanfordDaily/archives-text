## Tailgaters keep football tradition 
### Milada Vachudova 
Every year, Stanford football
fans look forward to a long list of
traditions — Stanford winning
the Big Game, the Band's antics
and tailgating before the game.
As at last Saturday's Stanford-
UCLA game, a large crowd of
fans gather at every home game
to continue the tradition of tail
gating.
Three to four hours before
kickoff, the parking lot becomes
a maze of parked cars and small
picnics, often staged on the
tailgates of cars and motor
homes.
The turnout, always diverse,
includes alumni, families of cur
rent students, faculty members
and community supporters.
Applied Physics Prof. Ralph
Smith and his wife, Louise, have
been coming to enjoy the tail
gaters and the games for about 30
years, ever since they moved on
campus.
"We're just loyal Stanford
supporters, hoping for a win,"
Louise said.
Edward Brenner, Class of '53,
and Bob Conrad, Class of '47,
have been buying season tickets
and enjoying Barbara Conrad's
exquisite lunches before the
games for over 20 years.
Alumna Judy Brenner said
"the spirit has not changed since
my parents went to school here.
The feel of football day ... it's
honest-to-God tradition."
"We know they're going to
lose, but where else can you have
such a great picnic?" Conrad
said.
Another alumnus, Jim
Campbell, has been picnicking
before the games with family and
friends for the last 12 years. The
Campbells' picnic, like many
others, features a tasty menu of
fering such dishes as salmon,
spinach casserole, several
salads, fresh fruit and lots of
champagne. The champagne,
Campbell said, is always "the
highlight of the day."
While some tailgaters stick to

the basics — sandwiches and
salads — others go to more ex
treme lengths.
Last Saturday, one elaborate
group even hired a bartender and
brought a feast for 35, in addition
to having enough soda pop to
treat the entire Stanford Band
when it came by to play.
Another unique tailgater was
shared specifically at the
Stanford-UCLA game, as it has
been for the last eight years:
Every year, Harry and Ina Kes
hishian, their daughter Mary
Boesiger, who is an alumnae, and
their friends from UCLA alter
nate the traveling and the
cooking.
"We have fun . . . that's the
important part of the game,"
they said.
Most tailgaters involve a small
group of season ticket holders
who strongly support the team.

talk of traveling to see them play
and even reminisce about the
good old Stanford Indians. One
older man, donning a red
feathered hat, still wanders the
parking lots, keeping up that tra
dition.
Tailgating also extends to
major organized events, put to
gether not only by the the Alumni
Association, but also by local
clubs and companies.
See's Candy, founded by Stan
ford graduate Larry See, offers
season tickets and a delicious
"Bubba-que" for employees.
Similar arrangements are made
by Hyatt and Xerox.
The question of whether drink
ing will be allowed in the stadium
was not a big issue among tail
gaters last Saturday. Most said
an alcohol ban in the stands
wouldn't affect them because
they do their drinking in the

parking lot before the game,
Brian Bolitho, the son of a
retired Stanford administrator
and a fan since 1971, echoed a
common thought that behavior at
the games doesn't seem to be
such a problem.
"Stanford is the most blase,
laid-back crowd I've ever seen,"
he said.
Another tailgater noted wryly
that "what we're more con
cerned with is that they let good
players into the stadium."
Although issues such as this
one may change some Stanford
football traditions, eating and so
cializing before the games is
bound to persist. Thirty years
from now, many current students
may find themselves pulling into
the dusty parking lot with friends
and fine cuisine to enjoy the at
mosphere of camaraderie before
going to cheer Stanford on.
