# Frozen yogurt a 'Cool' treat
## 
### Becky Eisenberg 
"I just want people to know
that not all yogurt is created
equal," Brad Permenter, the
daytime manager of Cool
Licks, said with a smile.
If you are ever in the mood
for that ever-popular Califor
nia frozen treat and are
looking for a change of pace
from the familiar Corner
Pocket scene, you might try
traveling a little farther into
Palo Alto to taste some Cool
Licks frozen yogurt.
Cool Licks seems to be a
friendly place to go. Accord
ing to Permenter, he and his
brother Bubba, Cool Licks's
nighttime manager, know 90
percent of their regular cus
tomers by their first names.
During the recent heat
wave, people were flocking
into the cool shelter of the
Palo Alto shop, yet Permenter
took time out of his work
schedule at Cool Licks and the
Stanford Pub to share some
inside information — and
some yogurt, too.
The majority of frozen yo
gurt shops around, according
to Permenter, receive their yo
gurt from the same dairies,
either Honey Hill Farms or
Continental. It arrives in
packages that resemble milk
cartons and is fed into
machines that mix the powder
with water and air to create
the finished product.
While each store's yogurt
comes from the same or
similar source, Permenter at
tributes the differences in taste
to three main factors: the type
of machine used to whip and
freeze the yogurt, the amount
of air mixed into the yogurt
and the cleaning and freshness

standards of the store.
He opened up his metal
machines for me, asserting
that the yogurt at Cool Licks,
at least on this occasion, was
fresh. Permenter also bragged
of the correctness in the
amount of air his machines
mix into the frozen yogurt,
creating what he insists is the
best taste and texture possi
ble.
Cool Licks always offers at
least 15 dry toppings, includ
ing "tropical trail mix," carob
sprinkles, yogurt-covered
raisons, yogurt-covered pea
nuts, "peanut pokies" (fake M
& Ms), carob raisins, granola,
peanut butter chips, coconut,
chocolate-covered nuts, a nut
mixture and Cool Licks' spe
cial fresh strawberries.
My favorite was "Cool
Licks Mix," — a combination
of all of the above except
strawberries.
Cool Licks always offers six
different yogurt flavors. Two
of these flavors are always
non-fat, plus Cool Licks al
ways offers chocolate and
natural-vanilla.
Permenter correctly as
serted that the store attracted
much business. Within the
short hour or so in which I in
terviewed him behind the fro
yo counter, at least 25 yogurt
eaters came in to order their
share of his treat, which is 96.5
percent fat-free and has 20 tO
30 calories per ounce.
So, the next time you feel
the craving for that 10-cal So-
Cal treat, realize that to many,
the frozen yogurt business is a
very serious business. Cool
Licks, established in 1963 and
located next to the Stanford
Pub on Emerson, is a friendly
change of pace.
