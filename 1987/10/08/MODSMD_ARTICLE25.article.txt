## Card muzzles No. 4 Bulldogs 
### Debbie Spander 
For the second time in as many
games the Stanford men's soccer
team upset a nationally ranked
team. By defeating fourth-ranked
Fresno State 1-0 yesterday at
Maloney Field, the Cardinal
raised its overall record to 5-4-2
and remained unbeaten (2-0) in
Pacific Soccer Conference play.
"To beat two nationally
ranked teams (San Francisco and
Fresno State) within four days is
a tremendous boost for the Stan
ford soccer program," Stanford
co-Sports Information Director
Bob Vasquez said.
Although the score was close,
Stanford thoroughly defeated the
Bulldogs. In only its second win
over the Bulldogs in Cardinal his
tory, Stanford not only played
brillant defense, but controlled
the pace of the game for the
entire second period.
"Today's effort was sweet,"
Stanford Coach Sam Koch said.
"The defense played great, and
we moved the ball very well, es
pecially during the second half."
"We played a solid game
defensively," fullback David
Thorpe said. "Whenever an op
ponent is shut out it means your
team is playing well."
Thorpe scored the only goal of
the game 28 minutes into the first
half on an assist from senior Tim
Westergren. It was Thorpe's
second goal of the season. The
Cardinal had a total of eight shots
on goal, and harrassed Fresno
State goalie Mark Dougherty for
the entire final period.
"It was a very well played
game," Fresno State Coach Jose
Elgorriaga said. "Stanford did a
good job. They deserved to
win."
Koch credits the victory to a
team effort and consistency.
"We scored the goal early and
didn't give up," he said. "We
kept up the intensity the entire
game, which we had not been
doing earlier in the season."'
Koch mentioned sophomore

midfielder Mark Semioli in par
ticular. "Semioli performed
magic," he said. "He was unbe
lievable."
The Cardinal held control of
the match throughout, but the
fact that the Bulldogs played
without the aid of star forward
Femi Olukanni cannot be over
looked. Because of a knee injury,
Olukanni, one of the top players
in the nation, saw only limited
action during the second half.

Because Stanford was coming
off its biggest win of its season,
over USF, and Fresno State had
just lost to UCLA in overtime,
both teams were especially
primed for the contest and ten
sions were high.
Each team recorded 12 fouls,
and a shoving match broke out
on the field five minutes into the
final period. Coaches and players
on both squads lodged numerous
complaints to the referees about

poor officiating and the players'
conduct.
The Cardinal feels it has finally
reached a consistently high level
of play, and is looking forward to
the ATT/Pacific West Soccer
Classic at Maloney Field this
weekend as well as the remainder
of its season. No one on the
squad, however, wants to
become overconfident.

Fresno State in consecutive games.
"It's crucial to keep this victory in
perspective," midfielder Pat Sheehy
said. "We're going to win our confer
ence but we still have to defeat weaker
teams. We have to make sure we don't
celebrate too much before we have the
games."
"I hope we can keep up our inten
sity." Thorpe said. "We have two
tough games coming up (the tourna

ment). It will be easy to get up for
teams such as the University of Wash
ington, but its the non-ranked squads
w ho tend to give us problems."
The win has given the squad visions
of postseason accolades. The players
believe Stanford now has a legitimate
shot at receiving an NCAA tournament
invitation.
"We played like we know how to
play, junior Luke Garrott said. "We
have to see how the rest of the year
goes, but right now we're in a good po
sition for a NCAA playoff bid."

Even though it has lost four games
this year, the Cardinal players hope to
gain a national ranking of their own
after defeating two top-five squads.
"We're now going to be expected to
win," Koch said. "1 don't know how
long it's going to be before they realize
we belong in the rankings."
If Stanford continues to improve at
the rate it has the past few matches it fs
going to be noticed.
"We're playing extremely well,'.'
Koch said. "But the team can play
even better."

"We played like we know how to
play, junior Luke Garrott said. "We
have to see how the rest of the year
goes, but right now we're in a good po
sition for a NCAA playoff bid."

Even though it has lost four games
this year, the Cardinal players hope to
gain a national ranking of their own
after defeating two top-five squads.
"We're now going to be expected to
win," Koch said. "1 don't know how
long it's going to be before they realize
we belong in the rankings."
If Stanford continues to improve at
the rate it has the past few matches it fs
going to be noticed.
"We're playing extremely well,'.'
Koch said. "But the team can play
even better."
For the second time in as many
games the Stanford men's soccer
team upset a nationally ranked
team. By defeating fourth-ranked
Fresno State 1-0 yesterday at
Maloney Field, the Cardinal
raised its overall record to 5-4-2
and remained unbeaten (2-0) in
Pacific Soccer Conference play.
"To beat two nationally
ranked teams (San Francisco and
Fresno State) within four days is
a tremendous boost for the Stan
ford soccer program," Stanford
co-Sports Information Director
Bob Vasquez said.
Although the score was close,
Stanford thoroughly defeated the
Bulldogs. In only its second win
over the Bulldogs in Cardinal his
tory, Stanford not only played
brillant defense, but controlled
the pace of the game for the
entire second period.
"Today's effort was sweet,"
Stanford Coach Sam Koch said.
"The defense played great, and
we moved the ball very well, es
pecially during the second half."
"We played a solid game
defensively," fullback David
Thorpe said. "Whenever an op
ponent is shut out it means your
team is playing well."
Thorpe scored the only goal of
the game 28 minutes into the first
half on an assist from senior Tim
Westergren. It was Thorpe's
second goal of the season. The
Cardinal had a total of eight shots
on goal, and harrassed Fresno
State goalie Mark Dougherty for
the entire final period.
"It was a very well played
game," Fresno State Coach Jose
Elgorriaga said. "Stanford did a
good job. They deserved to
win."
Koch credits the victory to a
team effort and consistency.
"We scored the goal early and
didn't give up," he said. "We
kept up the intensity the entire
game, which we had not been
doing earlier in the season."'
Koch mentioned sophomore

midfielder Mark Semioli in par
ticular. "Semioli performed
magic," he said. "He was unbe
lievable."
The Cardinal held control of
the match throughout, but the
fact that the Bulldogs played
without the aid of star forward
Femi Olukanni cannot be over
looked. Because of a knee injury,
Olukanni, one of the top players
in the nation, saw only limited
action during the second half.

Because Stanford was coming
off its biggest win of its season,
over USF, and Fresno State had
just lost to UCLA in overtime,
both teams were especially
primed for the contest and ten
sions were high.
Each team recorded 12 fouls,
and a shoving match broke out
on the field five minutes into the
final period. Coaches and players
on both squads lodged numerous
complaints to the referees about

poor officiating and the players'
conduct.
The Cardinal feels it has finally
reached a consistently high level
of play, and is looking forward to
the ATT/Pacific West Soccer
Classic at Maloney Field this
weekend as well as the remainder
of its season. No one on the
squad, however, wants to
become overconfident.

"It's crucial to keep this victory in
perspective," midfielder Pat Sheehy
said. "We're going to win our confer
ence but we still have to defeat weaker
teams. We have to make sure we don't
celebrate too much before we have the
games."
"I hope we can keep up our inten
sity." Thorpe said. "We have two
tough games coming up (the tourna

ment). It will be easy to get up for
teams such as the University of Wash
ington, but its the non-ranked squads
w ho tend to give us problems."
The win has given the squad visions
of postseason accolades. The players
believe Stanford now has a legitimate
shot at receiving an NCAA tournament
invitation.
