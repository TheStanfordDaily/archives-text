# Stanford for real
## 
### 
At University of Connecti
cut men's soccer games there
is a tradition that with 10
minutes left in each half, the
five or ten thousand fans on
hand rise to their feet and
cheer at the top of their lungs
for sixty seconds.

For the Stanford commu
nity, a couple of the words in
the previous sentence may
seem out of place when refer
ring to the sport of soccer. The
word tradition has been
reserved for the Cardinal foot
ball team's untimely 1987
slogan, "The Tradition Con
tinues."
And five or ten thousand
fans is the amount Stanford
draws in five years, not one
game.
Wake up, folks. This year's
Cardinal team may be good
enough to start a tradition and
at the same time finagle more
fans into attending games.
Yesterday afternoon about
300 spectators came out to
Maloney Field to witness
Stanford upset the fourth
ranked Fresno State Bulldogs
by a 1-0 score. Last week the
contentious Cardinal team
also stunned No. 2 San Fran
cisco by a 1-0 margin.
Before yesterday's game
Stanford Coach Sam Koch
said that beating the Bulldogs
would prove that the Cardinal
was for real.
Accordingly, the reality
today is that Stanford, not
Fresno State, looked like the
No. 4 team. Cardinal players
out-hustled and out

maneuvered the i lldogs and
confidently created many
more scoring opportunities
than the Fresno squad.
It is difficult to describe how
different and more fulfilling
watching a college soccer
game is than watching a col
lege football game.
Obviously, I'm trying to talk
you into going to see a Cardi
nal soccer game or two
(Stanford hosts Washington,
UCLA and California this
weekend). So let's stop
beating around the bush and
simply list some reasons:
• There are no television time
outs. You'll see 90 minutes of
continuous action interrupted
by only a brief halftime (no
marching bands, but you can
watch a bunch of little kids run
plays in the goal).
• Cardinal sophomores Mark
Semioli and Chris Porch may
have All-America caliber tal
ent. Semioli runs the Stanford
defense and made some short
upfield runs yesterday that
boggled the mind's eye.
Porch's posture on the field
gives fans the feeling that he
could strike at any second.
• Even near misses are
eminently enjoyable. A
puzzled fan yesterday asked,
"We cheer when somebody
misses a shot? [In baseball) a
guy just misses hitting a home
run, and we groan because he
made an out, but here if (a
player) misses we clap and
whistle?" Yeah, buddy, be
cause dingers come a dime a
dozen. Yesterday's lone goal
started with a long throw-in by
Cardinal Luke Garrott. The
ball skimmed off teammate
Tim Westergren's head and
David Thorpe then snapped it
off his own forehead and past
the Bulldog goalie for the
score.
• And yes, gulp, this is the
best "football" team on
campus this year.
