# Sophomore under the gun
## Stark, Elway still believe 
### David Earnest 
As he walked off the practice field Monday,
Scott Stark playfully drop-kicked the football
through the temporary goalposts. The ball fluttered
harmlessly into the net under the crossbar. He and
teammate chuckled. It was a surpringly relaxed
scene for two players on an 0-4 team.
But Stark's strength is not in his leg. The sopho
more is the Cardinal's heir apparent to senior Greg
Ennis at quarterback. And the team's recent
troubles have prompted Coach Jack Elway to
platoon the two quarterbacks. This Saturday, Stark
started against UCLA and played two quarters
before giving way to the more experienced Ennis.
"Scott is young and inexperienced," Elway said.
"The problems we had with UCLA were not his
fault. We were simply matched against a superior
ball club."
UCLA's defense proved too much for the young
quarterback. For his work on the day, Stark totaled
six completions in 15 attempts for 43 yards. He had
two passes picked oft'. His substitutes, however,
fared little better. The totals for the Cardinal quar
terbacks were 13 of 30 for 125 yards with 6 inter
ceptions.
Stark willingly accepts his role in the defeat. "I
wasn't pleased with the way I played. But no one
player is to blame for our problems," he said.
"We're just not putting it all together. It's just a
question of execution."
His maturity and modesty is typical of his role as
a team leader. Although a quiet person by nature,
Stark's confidence is tangible and convincing. And
what he lacks in experience he makes up for in ath
letic ability.
No one is more supportive of the young quarter
back than Elway. "Scott has great mechanics and a
very strong arm, and is an excellent all-around ath
lete," Elway said. "He just lacks the on-field ex
perience. This weekend he had a tough first outing
against an excellent team."
Elway's praise is anything but hollow. At
Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo,
Stark set a career passing record for Orange
County and finished second on the California all
time passing yardage list. In addition to lettering in
both basketball and baseball. Stark was named to
the California All-State football team. He also

received honorable mention All-America distinc
tion. "I had a pretty good senior year," he said.
But now Stark finds himself thrust into the spot
light, a position he has gracefully accepted. At a
school with a rich tradition of great quarterbacks,
including John Paye, Jim Plunkett and John Elway,
Stark admits feeling the pressure of the legacy he
has inherited.
"I think the fans, the students and the alumni all
expect an exciting passing game," Stark said.
"That hasn't come easily for us recently."
Redshirted his freshman year, Stark has three
more seasons of eligibility at Stanford. But when
asked about his future aspirations, he modestly
returns to the questions of the present.

'No one player is to blame
for our problems. We're
just not putting it together.
It's just a question of
execution.'

"I think every player on this team has hopes of
playing professional football. But that is the least of
our concerns," he said.
"Right now we just want to coneentrate on the
rest of the season. We have no problems as far as
team unity is concerned. We've practiced well, and
Greg has been very helpful."
In talking about the team's troubles Stark main
tains a positive and optimistic perspective for the
rest of the season. "In both the Washington and
Colorado games, we played well for three quar
ters," Stark said. "We could easily be 3-1 right
now. We're going to turn it around."
More than anything. Stark has a winning atti
tude. He is a leader by example. Stark doesn't like
to talk about his potential, his leadership ability or
who is going to be the starter next week. He just
wants to talk about a win.

Despite a disappointing performance in his first collegiate start against UCLA last Saturday and the Cardi
nal's 0-4 record, sophomore quarterback Scott Stark remains confident in his and his team's ability.
As he walked off the practice field Monday,
Scott Stark playfully drop-kicked the football
through the temporary goalposts. The ball fluttered
harmlessly into the net under the crossbar. He and
teammate chuckled. It was a surpringly relaxed
scene for two players on an 0-4 team.
But Stark's strength is not in his leg. The sopho
more is the Cardinal's heir apparent to senior Greg
Ennis at quarterback. And the team's recent
troubles have prompted Coach Jack Elway to
platoon the two quarterbacks. This Saturday, Stark
started against UCLA and played two quarters
before giving way to the more experienced Ennis.
"Scott is young and inexperienced," Elway said.
"The problems we had with UCLA were not his
fault. We were simply matched against a superior
ball club."
UCLA's defense proved too much for the young
quarterback. For his work on the day, Stark totaled
six completions in 15 attempts for 43 yards. He had
two passes picked oft'. His substitutes, however,
fared little better. The totals for the Cardinal quar
terbacks were 13 of 30 for 125 yards with 6 inter
ceptions.
Stark willingly accepts his role in the defeat. "I
wasn't pleased with the way I played. But no one
player is to blame for our problems," he said.
"We're just not putting it all together. It's just a
question of execution."
His maturity and modesty is typical of his role as
a team leader. Although a quiet person by nature,
Stark's confidence is tangible and convincing. And
what he lacks in experience he makes up for in ath
letic ability.
No one is more supportive of the young quarter
back than Elway. "Scott has great mechanics and a
very strong arm, and is an excellent all-around ath
lete," Elway said. "He just lacks the on-field ex
perience. This weekend he had a tough first outing
against an excellent team."
Elway's praise is anything but hollow. At
Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo,
Stark set a career passing record for Orange
County and finished second on the California all
time passing yardage list. In addition to lettering in
both basketball and baseball. Stark was named to
the California All-State football team. He also

received honorable mention All-America distinc
tion. "I had a pretty good senior year," he said.
But now Stark finds himself thrust into the spot
light, a position he has gracefully accepted. At a
school with a rich tradition of great quarterbacks,
including John Paye, Jim Plunkett and John Elway,
Stark admits feeling the pressure of the legacy he
has inherited.
"I think the fans, the students and the alumni all
expect an exciting passing game," Stark said.
"That hasn't come easily for us recently."
Redshirted his freshman year, Stark has three
more seasons of eligibility at Stanford. But when
asked about his future aspirations, he modestly
returns to the questions of the present.
