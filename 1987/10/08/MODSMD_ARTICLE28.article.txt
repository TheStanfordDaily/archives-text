# Reveno injured, may redshirt
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian 
After the finest season in his Stan
ford basketball career last year, senior
center Eric Reveno may have to sit out
the 1987-88 season because of a back
injury.
Reveno suffered the injury lifting
weights last spring. He underwent
therapy in Redwood City over the sum
mer and is now working at home with
weights to strengthen his lower back
and abdominal muscles.
"I want to play more than anything
this year," Reveno said. He cautioned,
however, that he must be careful to
prevent the injury from becoming a
permanent one.
If he misses this year, Reveno is con
cerned his performance might be ad
versely affected the following season.
He cites increased confidence as the
reason for his standout performance
last year, and the momentum he gained
could be lost if he were to miss this
season.
Reveno averaged 5.5 rebounds and
8.8 points per game last season, up
from 2.1 rebounds and 2.2 points per
game as a sophomore. Perhaps his best
game last year was at Maples Pavilion
against Arizona State, when he scored
a career-high 28 points and grabbed 13
rebounds in helping the Cardinal to a
97-92 overtime win.

Reveno said that "performing well
as an individual" is an important goal,
"hut team goals are more important."
Keveno's play could help propel Stan
ford to its first postseason tournament
since 1942.
The final decision on whether to red
shirt Reveno is up to the coaching staff.
As of this moment, according to Asst.
Coach Denny Houston, Reveno's fu
ture this season is on a "wait and see,
day to day basis."
Houston was reluctant to make any
predictions on the team's performance,
either with or without Reveno, but said
the coaches "will have to do some ad
justing if he can't play."
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery
stressed Reveno's importance to this
year's squad. "We're kind of counting
on Eric and are approaching the season
as if he is going to play," he said.
Reveno will not be ready to start
working out with the team when it
begins practice Oct. 15. However,
since he is a senior and knows
Montgomery's system well, Reveno's
late start should not hurt his or the
team's performance. Reveno's aggres
sive style and his jump hook shot make
him a particularly important part of
Stanford's 1987 plans.
"If he got the ball in the color he
could score," Montgomery said.
Reveno's "tremendous work ethic
and desire to succeed," Montgomery

said, are the main reasons for his out
standing numbers last season. In addi
tion, Stanford's style of play last year
emphasized Reveno's strengths and
enabled him to gain confidence in him
self.
In the event of Reveno's absence
from the starting lineup, Montgomery
said his game plan would not change
drastically. If he were to substitute an
other player for Reveno at the center
position, Montgomery said he would
"deal with the individual's talent."
If Reveno's back condition contin
ues to improve, however, it is unlikely
that he will sit out the entire season.
Montgomery would prefer to have
Reveno for the last six weeks of the
1987-1988 season than wait until
year to use him. "He is the best centel
we have right now," Montgomery said;
There are replacements for Reveno
at the center position. 6-foot-8 junior
Howard Wright, 7-0 senior Greg Butler
and 6-10 junior Derek Bruton are at the
top of the list to take over for Reveno.;
Reveno said the team could perform
well with or without him in the lineup.
He sees the Cardinal Finishing third of
higher in the Pacific 10 Conference;
The conference title is "a long shot,
but not quite in the dream category,'!
Reveno said.
Only time will tell what the future
holds for Eric Reveno and the Cardinal
basketball squad.

As of this moment, according to Asst.
Coach Denny Houston, Reveno's fu
ture this season is on a "wait and see,
day to day basis."
Houston was reluctant to make any
predictions on the team's performance,
either with or without Reveno, but said
the coaches "will have to do some ad
justing if he can't play."
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery
stressed Reveno's importance to this
year's squad. "We're kind of counting
on Eric and are approaching the season
as if he is going to play," he said.
Reveno will not be ready to start
working out with the team when it
begins practice Oct. 15. However,
since he is a senior and knows
Montgomery's system well, Reveno's
late start should not hurt his or the
team's performance. Reveno's aggres
sive style and his jump hook shot make
him a particularly important part of
Stanford's 1987 plans.
"If he got the ball in the color he
could score," Montgomery said.
Reveno's "tremendous work ethic
and desire to succeed," Montgomery

said, are the main reasons for his out
standing numbers last season. In addi
tion, Stanford's style of play last year
emphasized Reveno's strengths and
enabled him to gain confidence in him
self.
In the event of Reveno's absence
from the starting lineup, Montgomery
said his game plan would not change
drastically. If he were to substitute an
other player for Reveno at the center
position, Montgomery said he would
"deal with the individual's talent."
If Reveno's back condition contin
ues to improve, however, it is unlikely
that he will sit out the entire season.
Montgomery would prefer to have
Reveno for the last six weeks of the
1987-1988 season than wait until
year to use him. "He is the best centel
we have right now," Montgomery said;
There are replacements for Reveno
at the center position. 6-foot-8 junior
Howard Wright, 7-0 senior Greg Butler
and 6-10 junior Derek Bruton are at the
top of the list to take over for Reveno.;
Reveno said the team could perform
well with or without him in the lineup.
He sees the Cardinal Finishing third of
higher in the Pacific 10 Conference;
The conference title is "a long shot,
but not quite in the dream category,'!
Reveno said.
Only time will tell what the future
holds for Eric Reveno and the Cardinal
basketball squad.

Defensive plays like this rejection by center Eric Reveno may be hard to come by next
season for the Stanford men's basketball team. Reveno, a senior, may be forced to redshirt
this season.
After the finest season in his Stan
ford basketball career last year, senior
center Eric Reveno may have to sit out
the 1987-88 season because of a back
injury.
Reveno suffered the injury lifting
weights last spring. He underwent
therapy in Redwood City over the sum
mer and is now working at home with
weights to strengthen his lower back
and abdominal muscles.
"I want to play more than anything
this year," Reveno said. He cautioned,
however, that he must be careful to
prevent the injury from becoming a
permanent one.
If he misses this year, Reveno is con
cerned his performance might be ad
versely affected the following season.
He cites increased confidence as the
reason for his standout performance
last year, and the momentum he gained
could be lost if he were to miss this
season.
Reveno averaged 5.5 rebounds and
8.8 points per game last season, up
from 2.1 rebounds and 2.2 points per
game as a sophomore. Perhaps his best
game last year was at Maples Pavilion
against Arizona State, when he scored
a career-high 28 points and grabbed 13
rebounds in helping the Cardinal to a
97-92 overtime win.

Reveno said that "performing well
as an individual" is an important goal,
"hut team goals are more important."
Keveno's play could help propel Stan
ford to its first postseason tournament
since 1942.
The final decision on whether to red
shirt Reveno is up to the coaching staff.
As of this moment, according to Asst.
Coach Denny Houston, Reveno's fu
ture this season is on a "wait and see,
day to day basis."
Houston was reluctant to make any
predictions on the team's performance,
either with or without Reveno, but said
