# Republicans uncertain; Democrats hopeful
## Pols prep for House race 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Democrats and
the Stanford College Republicans
are looking forward with great in
terest to the 1988 race for U.S.
Rep. Ernie Konnyu's seat in the
12th Congressional District.
Campus partisans agree that
Konnyu, a first-term Republican
from Saratoga, faces a tough pri
mary challenge from Law Prof.
Tom Campbell. But they dis
agree as to whether a tough fight
in the Republican primary will
greatly affect the outcome of the
general election.
Senior Mark Lemley, political
director for the Stanford Demo
crats, said he believes the com
petition in the Republican party

bodes well for campus Demo
crats. "Pete McCloskey and Ed
Zschau represented this district
as mavericks since 1967. Neither
were traditional Republicans,"
he said.
"Konnyu is the opposite. He's
on the far right, a traditional Re
publican in a moderate district,"
Lemley said. "Campbell, on the
other hand, is relatively un
known and faces the added prob
lem that Republicans don't like
divisiveness. Konnyu is vulnera
ble, but he has inertia going for
him."
Lemley predicted that a Demo
cratic candidate would benefit
from Republican infighting. "For
the first time, a Democrat has a
good chance of winning this dis
trict." he said.

The 12th District, which ex
tends from southern San Mateo
County through Stanford to San
Jose, has traditionally been Re
publican. The GOP has held the
seat for the past 20 years.
Lemley named Democrat Jim
Garrison, a Mountain View busi
nessman, as a "strong potential
challenger to the Republican
nominee.
Junior Jason Dominguez, vice
chair for the Stanford College
Republicans, said the group will
endorse neither Konnyu nor
Campbell until the primary is
over.
"We're definitely going to
invite them both to speak on
