# Comparative Literature
## New department created 
### Ted W. Lieu 
Comparative Literature, which
began as a program 18 years ago
here, has now become the 28th
department in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
According to Norman Wes
sells, dean of the school, Com
parative Literature has always
been "one of our strongest extra
departmental Ph.D. and teaching
programs."
As a department. Comparative
Literature will now be able to
hire and retain faculty, according
to English Prof. John Bender.
Bender will co-chair the new de
partment with Assoc. German
Prof. David Wellbery.
The creation of the department
will make it easier for the pro
gram to attract faculty, Wessells
said. According to Bender, the
new department will "provide

for a more continuous and stable
course offering for graduate stu
dents," Bender said.
Undergraduate students,
however, will not witness a sig
nificant change in the depart
ment. According to Bender,
"one undergraduate course is
being assembled, and it will not
be ready for at least a couple
years."
A new long-range undergradu
ate major in Comparative
Literature is also being consid
ered, but it will not be ready for
at least five years, Bender said.
This major will likely be more ac
cessible and less demanding than
the current undergraduate
honors major now being offered.
Wellbery and Bender were ap
pointed two years ago to decide
whether Comparative Literature
should become a department.

After one year, they concluded
that the quality of the program
warranted an upgrade in status.
In order to become a depart
ment, the program had to be ap
proved by the dean, the provost,
a faculty advisory board. Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
and finally by the University
Board of Trustees.
Now that Comparative
Literature is finally a depart
ment, literary studies at Stanford
should increase in prominence
and flexibility, Bender said.
According to Wellbery, "The
departmentalization of Compara
tive Literature is a testimony . . .
to the success of our very tine
students. We look forward to an
exciting and productive future as
a department and to intense col
laboration with our sister depart
ments within the University."
