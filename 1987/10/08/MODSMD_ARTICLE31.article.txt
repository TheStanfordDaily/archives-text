## 75 years have passed since Abdu'l Baha visited Stanford 
### Erik Johnson 
The Baha'is of Stanford and
those of the surrounding com
munity celebrated the 75th an
niversary of Abdu'l-Baha's
visit to Stanford last night with
a ceremony at Stanford
Memorial Church and a recep
tion afterward at Oak Lounge
West in Tresidder Union.
University President David
Starr Jordan invited Abdu'l-
Baha, known as "the Baha," to
Stanford in 1912 when he was
traveling through the United
States on an 8-month tour of
major cities. The Baha had just
gained his freedom from prison
when he embarked on his jour
ney.
The Baha'i religion bases its
beliefs primarily on the notion
of the unity of mankind. As a
result of this belief, the Baha'is
promote a progressive message
of peace and racial harmony.
However, despite their
pacifist message, Baha'is have
suffered persecution in the land
of their religion's origin,
present-day Iran. Government
soldiers and police have orders

to shoot to kill on sight any
known Baha'is.
In addition, according to
Frank Raymond, a member of
the Palo Alto House of Justice
for area Baha*is, the Iranian
government routinely denies
Baha'is public education,
public medical treatment and
their shares of food rations.
The Iranian government jus
tifies the discrimination by
claiming the Baha'is as a sub
versive political group.
The Baha'i religion began in
1844 when the Bab, a forerun
ner of the Baha'i movement
who predicted the arrival of a
prophet. That prophet arrived
for the Baha'is in the form of
Abdu'l-Baha.
Though not formally consid
ered a prophet by his religion,
the Baha is thought of as the
center of the Baha'is covenant
and the prime example of what
all men should strive to be.
In his 1912 address to the
Stanford community, the Baha
praised men of science as the
"noblest body of men," while
the best of centers "is a center
devoted to the study of
sciences and the arts."

The supreme being of man is
impelled by his gift of mind to
seek for "the realities of
things," according to the Baha.
While God maintains the
highest form of being, man is
his greatest creation. As such,
man must not only seek
answers. But, for the Baha'is,
he must also seek ways to end
the divisions of man found in
war and persecution.
The Baha'is have no
centralized hierarchy of leader
ship. Rather, elected assem
blies of nine adults represent
the respective communities of
Baha'is. In turn, each nation
with any Baha'i population has
a National House of Justice.
The United House of Justice,
the worldwide branch of the
Baha'is, resides in Haifa, Is
rael, the "Promised Land" for
Baha'is.
Stanford will host the local
convention of Baha'is, in which
representatives for the Na
tional House of Justice will be
chosen, Oct. 17.
The Daily regrets the
profound irrelevance of this ar
ticle.
