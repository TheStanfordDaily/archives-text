# Task force to call for course changes
## Western Culture report due today 
### Raina Jackson 
The long-awaited report of the
Western Culture Task Force to
be issued today will call for major
changes in the Area One Re
quirement, according to mem
bers of the Committee on Under
graduate Studies.
Members of the task force met
with the CUS yesterday to
outline their proposals for
changes in the requirement.
The report calls for a modifica
tion of the current Western Cul
ture requirement, and contains
three central recommendations:
• the study of at least one non-
Western culture in all tracks,
• the abolishment of a core
reading list for all tracks, and
• a substantial increase in the
representation of women and
minorities in the curriculum.
Craig Heller, chairman of the
CUS, said he anticipates that the
recommendations will be accept
able to the Rainbow Agenda, and
said that if they are not, they
should be adapted until they do.
The Rainbow Agenda, formed
last spring, is a coalition of
campus ethnic minority groups
that pressed the University to
create the task force.
One of the groups central con
cerns has been reform of the
Area One Requirement. Mem
bers say most tracks ignore the
accomplishments of women and
minorities to Western culture.
The CUS will invite faculty
and students to evaluate the
report after its release. Accord
ing to Heller, this will be a
"lengthy process" but "a real
honest effort to change Area One
in the way it should be changed.
Its not easy, but it's an impor
tant step forward."
The CUS has scheduled an
open meeting to evaluate the
report, tentatively set for Oct.
28.
History Prof. Paul Seaver,
chairman of the task force, said
he believes the CUS reception to
the proposal will be favorable.
"It will hopefully go to the
(Faculty) Senate and will be

welcomed. I think we have a
good report. The CUS seems
receptive. 1 '
Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Tom Wasow, an ex
officio member of the CUS, said
he believes yesterday's meeting
was inconclusive. "There's no
decision as to what will be done
yet. We have many options. We
can amend it or reject it and send
it to the senate or we could pro
pose an alternative."

Wasow also said he is not sure
if the Rainbow Agenda will agree
to the recommendations.
Junior Jon Indaofthe Rainbow
Agenda said that while he
couldn't speak for the Agenda as
a whole, he believes it would be
"ideal if the proposal passes and
is implemented in the next few
years.
Inda called the proposal "the
most that could be asked for."
The task force was formed by
Provost James Rosse last Sep
tember in response to demands
of the Rainbow Agenda. The task
force's initial report, released
last spring, received much
criticism.
Critics charged the report ad
vocated the study of cultural di
versity but still ignored women,
minorities and the non-elite.
