# Geologists renew link with China

### Jay Swan 
Last summer, Stanford Earth Science pro
fessors and graduate students trekked
through northwestern China, renewing an old
tradition linking Stanford with Chinese geol
ogy.
Early in this century, geologist Bailey Wil
lis traveled throughout China, conducting the
first Western geological study of that
country. Willis, who would later become a
professor at Stanford, was accompanied by
Eliot Blackwelder, a paleontologist who also
laterjoined the Stanford faculty. Blackwelder
eventually became chairman of Stanford's
geology department.
The pair traveled by foot and by mule.

sleeping on the floors of temples and at one
point rafting down the Yangtze River. Willis'
travels became the stuff of legends in China,
where he is still revered among geologists
today.
The Stanford connection with the Far East
was broken after World War II when China
became closed to the West.
This summer's expeditions were in part the
result of a request made by the Chinese gov
ernment in 1985. At that time. Stanford
geologists were asked to join in research in
the Xinjiang province, an area rich in natural
resources.
In response, Stanford created the Stanford-
China Earth Sciences industrial Affiliates
Program, an association of both University

and oil company scientists interested in
Chinese geology.
As part of the program, Stanford will host
meetings of scientists from various compan
ies, government agencies and American uni
versities in return for contriubtions support
ing scholarly research in China. The first of
these meetings will he held in December,
when a party of Chinese scientists w ill arrive
for a six-week stay at Stanford.
Three Stanford professors worked in China
this summer: Robert Coleman and Steve
Graham of the geology department and Mike
McWilliams of the geophysics department.
Coleman, who taught Chinese
students at Stanford several
years ago and subsequently
returned with them to China,
was partly responsible for
renewing the Stanford-China
connection.
McWilliams described the
Xinjiang province as mostly a
large, flat area of dune sand
called the Tarim basin, cover
ing about 550,000 square
kilometers — roughly three
times the area of Texas.
McWilliams compared the ter
rain to that of Nevada.
The southern part of the
province includes the Kunlun
mountain range, and the
northern part includes the
Tianshan mountains. McWil
liams' research was conducted
at the edges of the Tarim
basin, where the group of re
searchers lived in large, com
fortable tent camps. They
were provided with down
quilts, washing machines and
even camp cooks.
"It was really nice. We
didn't have to concern our
selves with anything but geol
ogy — all the little chores of
camp life were taken care of.
My wife was pleasantly

surprised." McWilliams said.
McWilliams' research un
covered some interesting in
formation: Parts of the Asian
land mass are much younger
than was originally thought.
The Indian sub-continent is
the "newest" part of Asia,
created by a process called
collision and accretion. In this
process, stable plates of earth
called cratons accrete, or
come together, and become
part of preexisting cratons.
McWilliams plans to return
to China next summer to con
duct research in the southwes
tern part of the country, near
the border with Pakistan.
Graham's work in China last
summer was in the field of
basin analysis. The parts of
the country his group studied,
he says, have persisted as
basins for a very long time,
making them prime areas in
which to search for natural re
sources.
Graham's research was con
ducted out of the "geologic
city," an enormous base camp
that enables scientists to work
self-sufficiently in remote,
rugged areas. The camp
Graham stayed in was entirely
self-contained, with homes, an
Olympic size swimming pool and
a movie theater. Some people
may spend their entire careers in
such "geologic cities," Graham
said.
There are 22 such camps in
China, each working in a specific
area of research. A camp may be
involved in oil studies or gold
mining, for example.
Graham also had the opportu
nity to visit an enormous
petrified forest, similar to the one
in Arizona. After driving over
100 miles through the desert, the
researchers came upon long fal
len trees and stumps, some of
which were still rooted in the
ground — a rare find in petrified
forests. One fallen tree measured
83 feet, and the largest stump
was 23 feet in circumference.
"It looks like someone just
came along and hacked the trees
off a few feet above the ground,"
Graham said. The presence of

fossilized dinosaur remains
nearby suggests the trees may
have been fodder for relatives of
the brontosaurus.
Overall, according to the sci
entists, the research in China has
proven valuable, both from a sci

entific standpoint and an eco
nomic one. Much geological
knowledge has been accum
ulated; and Xinjiang province ap
pears to have promising oil fields
and seems to he a future frontier
for mineral resources.
