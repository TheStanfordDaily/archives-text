# Geologists renew link with China

### Jay Swan 
Last summer, Stanford Earth Science pro
fessors and graduate students trekked
through northwestern China, renewing an old
tradition linking Stanford with Chinese geol
ogy.
Early in this century, geologist Bailey Wil
lis traveled throughout China, conducting the
first Western geological study of that
country. Willis, who would later become a
professor at Stanford, was accompanied by
Eliot Blackwelder, a paleontologist who also
laterjoined the Stanford faculty. Blackwelder
eventually became chairman of Stanford's
geology department.
The pair traveled by foot and by mule.

sleeping on the floors of temples and at one
point rafting down the Yangtze River. Willis'
travels became the stuff of legends in China,
where he is still revered among geologists
today.
The Stanford connection with the Far East
was broken after World War II when China
became closed to the West.
This summer's expeditions were in part the
result of a request made by the Chinese gov
ernment in 1985. At that time. Stanford
geologists were asked to join in research in
the Xinjiang province, an area rich in natural
resources.
In response, Stanford created the Stanford-
China Earth Sciences industrial Affiliates
Program, an association of both University

and oil company scientists interested in
Chinese geology.
As part of the program, Stanford will host
meetings of scientists from various compan
ies, government agencies and American uni
versities in return for contriubtions support
ing scholarly research in China. The first of
these meetings will he held in December,
when a party of Chinese scientists w ill arrive
for a six-week stay at Stanford.
Three Stanford professors worked in China
this summer: Robert Coleman and Steve
Graham of the geology department and Mike
McWilliams of the geophysics department.
