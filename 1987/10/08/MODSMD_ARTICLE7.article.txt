# Students to join gay rights march
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth 
Five Stanford students will
travel to the nation's capital this
weekend to participate in the Na
tional March on Washington for
Lesbian and Gay Rights, which
will be held Sunday at the
( apitol.
Seniors Atticus Tysen. Ann
Mei Chang and BarbVoss, along
with two unnamed graduate stu
dents, will be joining what na
tional organizers estimate will be
over 3(H),(XH) people marching for
lesbian and gay rights.
Chang said she hopes the
march will "make people aware
that a sizable gay and lesbian
population exists that refuses to
succumb to oppression."
The marchers are primarily de
manding passage of the Congres
sional Lesbian and Gay Rights

Bill, which ends discrimination
on the basis of sexual preference,
and a massive increase in funding
of AIDS education, research and
care.
"1 predict the march will be
very orderly and organized and
will be an elegant and eloquent
statement demanding our rights
and demanding them now,"
Tysen said.
"There are a large number of
gays and lesbians who are tired
of being closeted and vvant to
stand up for their civil rights." he
added. "Gays and lesbians are an
invisible minority, so people like
to say they don't exist. I think
this march will surprise people at
just how many there are."
The march will coincide with
the unveiling of the Names Proj
ect, a massive quilt of 3000 3-by
6-foot panels serving as a

memorial to people who have
died because of AIDS.
According to Tysen. six mem
bers of the Stanford community
are represented in the quilt. "The
Names Project takes note of the
thousands who have died from
AIDS and the millions more that
will die," he said.
The five are primarily paying
their own way, but they received
some funds in the form of grants
from the Palo Alto chapter of the
National Organization for
Women, which contributed $3(M)
to Voss and Chang so that they
could attend.
The activities surrounding the
march include a mass wedding on
Saturday, where hundreds of
same-sex couples will take part
in a non-sectarian ceremony to
emphasize the demand that gay
and lesbian couples should have

the same rights as heterosexual
couples.
A non-violent civil dis
obedience demonstration is
scheduled for Tuesday at the Su
preme Court, but the Stanford
group will not be participating
because of "conflicts with
classes," Chang said.
The first gay and lesbian Na
tional March on Washington took
place in 1979. According to
Gerard Koskovich. Stanford
alumnus and coordinator of the
Stanford Lesbian and Gay Ar
chives Project, many items on
this year's agenda are the same
as the original march because
that march received little media
coverage.
Four Stanford students partici
pated in the 1979 march carrying
the Stanford Gay People > Union
banner, he said.
