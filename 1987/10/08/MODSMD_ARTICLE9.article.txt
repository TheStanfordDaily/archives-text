Quake site declared disaster area
LOS ANGELES — President Reagan declared Los Angeles
and Orange counties federal disaster areas yesterday, clearing
the way for emergency officials to set up relief assistance offices
and dispense aid to thousands of earthquake victims.
Red Cross officials said that the numbers of displaced victims
staying in agency shelters surged again, reaching 2235 by yester
day. As quake-strained inner city apartment houses continued
to be declared unsafe, forcing poverty-stricken renters to seek
help at shelters, relief agency officials said volunteers feared a
shortage of long-term housing for quake victims.
With the president's declaration, government disaster offi
cials moved quickly to set up emergency offices in Los Angeles
and the devastated cities of the San Gabriel Valley to funnel aid
to quake victims.
Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said seven
disaster offices will open Sunday — three in Los Angeles and
others in Whittier, Rosemead, Alhambra and La Habra. There,
quake victims can apply for federal funds for temporary
housing, grants of up to $500() for individuals and families, low
interest loans to cover uninsured property and business losses
and other programs to supplement state and local recovery ef
forts.
Howard Beach murder trial opens
NEW YORK — A special prosecutor charged yesterday that
a group of white teen-agers watched an automobile kill a 23-
year-old black man they had chased into traffic on a busy high
way and then, "without missing a beat," went on to beat one of
his companions, whose mercy pleas they ignored.
More than nine months after the quiet Queens neighborhood
of Howard Beach was turned into a national symbol of urban ra
cial violence, trial opened for four defendants charged with
causing the death of Michael Griffith and the beatings of two of
his companions. The case of the three black men who were as
saulted when their car broke down near Howard Beach
heightened racial tensions in other parts of New York City.
Special New York State Prosecutor Charles Hynes told the
jury in his opening statement that three of the defendants
watched the car hurl Griffith "12 to 15 feet into the air," then
raced down another street to beat Cedric Sandiford, who
pleaded with his attackers: "I have a son like you, 17 years old.
Don't kill me."
"The response," Hynes added, "was to slam a baseball bat
into his face."
Hynes said that Griffith ran onto the Belt Parkway because he
saw no other means of fleeing his attackers. The prosecutor said
that as Griffith raced down a narrow street with fences in front
of property, the street "became in every sense a tunnel, the only
escape from which became to put the traffic on the Belt
Parkway between himself and his pursuers."
Manila coup rumors close stations
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine President Corazon
Aquino ordered the closure yesterday of at least three
opposition-controlled radio stations and deployed Army tanks
around her palace after loyal military leaders reported that an
other, "much more serious" attempted coup d'etat will be
staged against her before this month's end.
The disclosure came after a marathon series of Cabinet
meetings Tuesday night and yesterday, in which Mrs. Aquino's
armed forces chief Gen. Fidel Ramos said the coup plot in
volved a powerful new "tactical alliance' 1 between all major
right-wing opposition leaders and hundreds of renegade sol
diers, among them Col. Gregorio Honasan, who staged the
nearly successful Aug. 28 coup attempt.
Citing military intelligence reports and "voluminous docu
ments" seized in Tuesday night raids on five Manila hideouts
being used by the renegade troops, Ramos asserted that
deposed President Ferdinand Marcos and his close friend,
Eduardo Cojuangco, were both involved in the plot.
Several reliable government sources doubted Marcos' in
volvement in the plot. They speculated that the allegation was
part of a government campaign to discredit the still popular
Honasan, who also helped to carry out the coup that overthrew
Marcos in February 1986.
Study says defections will increase
WASHINGTON — A Senate staff study of Soviet and East
ern bloc defections to the United States predicts that "a
noticeable increase" will occur within the next few years, ironi
cally because of internal reforms being pushed by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
The study by the Senate Governmental Affairs permanent
subcommittee on investigations, to be released at a hearing
today, declares that "following periods of internal reform,
defections increase rather than decrease for a period of time ...
in part due to thwarted expectations after the reform period
ends."
But the study, a copy of which was obtained by the Los An
geles Times, says the U.S. government and private organiza
tions are failing to meet the resettlement needs of most defec
tors, thereby wasting potentially valuable human resources.
The subcommittee staff said its two-year study of the defector
problem was spurred by the case of KGB agent Vitaly Yur
chenko, who defected to the United States in August 1985 but
returned to the Soviet Union three months later after walking
away from his CIA handler at a Georgetown restaurant.
Although Yurchenko's reasons for re-defecting still are
debated by U.S. intelligence experts, the staff report criticizes
"United States government mishandling of his case," a case
which led to "needed improvements" made by the CIA in the
handling and protection of high-level defectors like Yurchenko.
Myerson indicted in bribery trial
NEW YORK — Bess Myerson, the former Miss America
whose political charm helped Edward Koch win election as
mayor, was indicted yesterday on charges that she illegally in
fluenced a state judge to reduce alimony required to be paid by
Myerson's lover.
Myerson, 63, who served as Koch's cultural affairs commis
sioner until she was forced to resign in April, hired the judge's
daughter as a $19,000-a-year aide in exchange for having the
divorce case fixed, according to the six-count indictment
returned by a federal grand jury here.
Myerson's millionaire boyfriend, Carl A. (Andy) Capasso, 45,
a city sewer contractor who began serving a four-year prison
term for tax evasion last spring, is also charged in the case, as is
Hortense Gabel, 74, who recently stepped down as a Manhattan
Supreme Court judge.
If convicted, Myerson could face up to 30 years in prison and
$513,000 in fines. The three defendants are charged with mail
fraud, conspiracy and bribery-related charges. Myerson is also
charged with obstruction of justice.
