# Sakharov may speak here at arms conference
## 
### Bruce LeDesma 
Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov
heads a list of prominent world figures invited to
participate in a major symposium on arms control
to be held at Stanford in December.
The free public conference, titled "Building a
Safer 21st Century," includes such public figures
as former National Security Adviser McGeorge
Bundy, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead,
three U.S. senators and several Soviet officials.
The symposium will consider possible measures
to enhance international security, manage regional
conflicts and reduce the threat of nuclear war.
Sakharov discussed the event with Stanford
physicist Sidney Drell last June in Moscow and has
expressed keen interest in coming to the United
States to participate in the symposium.
However, Drell, who is chairman of the Stanford
Center for International Security and Arms Control
(CISAC), which is helping organize the event, em
phasized yesterday that Sakharov's attendance is
still pending. "It could happen, it may not," he
said. "We've presented our case to the Russians,
and we're waiting."
Asked what the chances are of Sakharov receiv
ing permission from the Soviet government to at
tend, Drell said the more time Moscow takes to
respond, the less likely it is Sakharov will be
allowed to participate. "My betting odds change
with time," he said.
David Bernstein, a professor at the Arms Control
Center and a member of the symposium planning
committee, seemed more confident. "The Soviets
will certainly get a lot of brownie points in the
world by letting (Sakharov) come," he said. "He
certainly wants to participate. It's a question of
whether or not the Soviets will let him. . . . We're
optimistic."
A letter sent to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
from University President Donald Kennedy and
the presidents of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Princeton University urged the So
viet leader to "help in making it possible for
Academician Sakharov to be able to visit our insti
tutions."
Although Sakharov's appearance at the sympo
sium is still uncertain, the Soviet Union has already
agreed to send some officials. "They have said
they will provide speakers, although we do not
know if they will send the ones we've requested,"
Bernstein said.
The conference is u part of the
University's Centennial Celebra
tion and is co-sponsored by Stan
ford and the Carnegie Corp. of
New York. Global Outreach and
the Arms Control Center are or
ganizing the event.
According to a statement of
purpose released by the Univer
sity, "The conference is intended
to address the prospects for im
proving international security in
general and U.S.-Soviet relations
in particular during the remaining
years of this century."
The release states that "the
primary focus is not on immedi
ate political issues, but on a long
range view of the challenges we
face in strategic relations among
the United States, the Soviet Un
ion and other nations. Our pur
pose will be to develop a vision
of how these relations might be
improved over the next two
decades."
The three U.S. senators who
will attend the symposium are
Alan Cranston of California,
Timothy Wirth of Colorado and
Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas.
Some others on the long list of
scheduled speakers include
former Undersecretary of
Defense William Perry; U.S.
Ambassador James Goodby;
Japanese Ambassador Ryukichi
Imai; Strobe Talbott, Washing
ton bureau chief of Time maga
zine; David Hamburg, president
of the Carnegie Corp. of New
York; Karren House, correspon
dent for the Wall Street Journal;
and Philip Habib, President
Reagan's former special envoy to
Central America and the Middle
East.
