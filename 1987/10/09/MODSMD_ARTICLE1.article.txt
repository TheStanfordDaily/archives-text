# Sakharov may speak here at arms conference
## 
### Bruce LeDesma 
Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov
heads a list of prominent world figures invited to
participate in a major symposium on arms control
to be held at Stanford in December.
The free public conference, titled "Building a
Safer 21st Century," includes such public figures
as former National Security Adviser McGeorge
Bundy, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead,
three U.S. senators and several Soviet officials.
The symposium will consider possible measures
to enhance international security, manage regional
conflicts and reduce the threat of nuclear war.
Sakharov discussed the event with Stanford
physicist Sidney Drell last June in Moscow and has
expressed keen interest in coming to the United
States to participate in the symposium.
However, Drell, who is chairman of the Stanford
Center for International Security and Arms Control
(CISAC), which is helping organize the event, em
phasized yesterday that Sakharov's attendance is
still pending. "It could happen, it may not," he
said. "We've presented our case to the Russians,
and we're waiting."
Asked what the chances are of Sakharov receiv
ing permission from the Soviet government to at
tend, Drell said the more time Moscow takes to
respond, the less likely it is Sakharov will be
allowed to participate. "My betting odds change
with time," he said.
David Bernstein, a professor at the Arms Control
Center and a member of the symposium planning
committee, seemed more confident. "The Soviets
will certainly get a lot of brownie points in the
world by letting (Sakharov) come," he said. "He
certainly wants to participate. It's a question of
whether or not the Soviets will let him. . . . We're
optimistic."
A letter sent to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
from University President Donald Kennedy and
the presidents of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Princeton University urged the So
viet leader to "help in making it possible for
Academician Sakharov to be able to visit our insti
tutions."
Although Sakharov's appearance at the sympo
sium is still uncertain, the Soviet Union has already
agreed to send some officials. "They have said
they will provide speakers, although we do not
know if they will send the ones we've requested,"
Bernstein said.
