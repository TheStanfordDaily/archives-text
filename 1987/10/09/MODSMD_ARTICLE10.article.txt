# 53 senators now oppose Bork

### 
WASHINGTON — As Senate
opposition to the Supreme Court
nomination of Judge Robert Bork
swelled yesterday to a majority
of 53 votes, President Reagan for
the first time softened his insis
tence that the full Senate vote
Bork up or down.
Asked by reporters whether he
would withdraw the nomination,
Reagan responded that Bork
"has a decision to make."
Associates described Bork as
tempted to push for a full Senate
vote so that he could get his side
of the story told on the cham
ber's floor to an extent not possi
ble during the recent Judiciary
Committee hearings. After three
weeks of hearings, the committee
voted 9-5 to recommend that the
Senate reject the nomination.

White House and Department
of Justice sources said yesterday
morning that they expected Bork
to appear at the White House
later in the day with Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111. They
predicted that withdrawal of his
nomination would then be an
nounced.
But after Bork and Meese met
for 40 minutes at the Department
of Justice, Reagan's spokesman,
Marlin Fitzwater, said Meese
was not coming and that he did
not expect Bork.
"It's up to Judge Bork to
decide," said a senior White
House official, indicating mount
ing frustration there over the in
action that has left the nomina
tion dangling, despite the in

creasing majority of senators
committed to vote against him.
The official indicated the frustra
tion extended to Meese for ap
parently slowing the process.
"We are looking for Bob Bork
to tell us what he is doing," he
said.
Another senior official at the
White House said Bork "was
really negative when he went
over to Justice. We would hope
that whatever happens happens
soon."
Meese's spokesman, Terry
Eastland, insisted that Meese did
not try to advise Bork either
way. Meese "lent a sympathetic
ear," he said, and "supports
Judge Bork in whatever decision
he makes."

Bork's spirits were said to be
buoyed by family encourage
ment. Bork's wife, Mary Ellen,
who accompanied him to the De
partment of Justice, and three
children were described by one
Bork associate as being angered
over his being "pummeled
around" during the hearing, and
thus found merit in the argument
put forward by Sen. Alan
Simpson (R-Wyo.).
Simpson, who repeatedly
charged during the hearings that
opponents had treated him un
fairly, told Bork Wednesday that
only a full debate on the Senate
floor would avoid history's
characterizing him as "some gar
goyle of judicial disruption."
