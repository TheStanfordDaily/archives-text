# Editor's apology:
## 
### 
A story in yesterday's Daily
contained a thoughtless and
insensitive sentence that
demeaned the group about
which the article was written.
The sentence, which ap-
peared in the story "Baha'is
celebrate anniversary," was
an unfortunate and completely
inappropriate joke inserted
during the editing process. At
no time was the remark meant
for publication.

Our conduct was unaccept
able, both professionally and
ethically. A newspaper is
worth little if its readers can
not trust its accuracy and sin
cerity.
We extend deepest apolo
gies to members of the Baha'i
community for the distress we
have caused them, and to our
readers for violating their trust
in us.
