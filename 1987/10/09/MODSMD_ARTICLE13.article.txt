Catherine Tierney, assistant to
the director of Stanford libraries,
said she was pleased with the
report's findings but was not
"overcome" by the numerical
ranking. Instead, she emphasized
Stanford's quality of service
rather than the mere quantitative
factors the ARL index
recognized.
Over the years, Stanford's li
braries have been ranked highly
in comparison to other univer
sities because of "Stanford's
commitment to excellence in re
search and learning support
through the University's libra
ries," Tierney said.
