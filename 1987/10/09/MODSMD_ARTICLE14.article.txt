# Law school controversy
## Recruiting policy change favored 
### James Wetmore 
After last week's visit to Stan
ford by a law firm that allegedly
fired an employee on the basis of
his sexual preference, the Law
School administration and a
number of Law students agree
that the school's anti
discrimination policy must
change.
Although the Law School's
policy prohibits any firm that dis
criminates to interview students
on campus, representatives of
several student groups claim the
policy is inadequate.
Several members of the Stan
ford Law School Multicultural
Council — a coalition of ethnic
minority, women's, lesbian and
gay groups — criticized the
policy as too weak.
Michael Adams, co-chair of
the Gay and Lesbian Law Stu

dents Association, called for
more definite procedures to ban
firms that discriminate.
"The fact is that there are no
guidelines as to when a law firm
is guilty. The policy lacks spe
cific language," Adams said.
According to Law School
Dean Paul Brest, the policy
needs to include more specific
language covering two areas:
how to determine whether a firm
engages in discrimination and
what the appropiate penalty
should be if such discrimination
is evident.
David Cavicke, president of
the Stanford Federalist Society,
also criticized the policy, but on
different grounds. He said pre
venting organizations which dis
criminate on the basis of sexual
preference from interviewing
prevents those organizations

themselves from being changed
from within.
"It is unfortunate that while
some in the Stanford Law School
claim to want people to go into
government, they ban the CIA
and Defense Department. They
prevent people (from trying) to
change these organizations from
within."
In addition to disagreement
over the theory behind the
policy, there has been dispute
over what action should be taken
with regard specifically to Baker
& McKenzie, the firm involved
in the dispute.
Members of the Multicultural
Council urged that Baker &
McKenzie, one of the largest law
firms in the country, be banned
immediately from interviewing
on campus.
Jesus Bernal, co-chair of the
Stanford Latino Law Students

Association, said, "We can more
or less reasonably conclude"
that the firm discriminated
against an AIDS victim.
"Up until this point it has not
been clarified what the Law
School will do. We want immedi
ate sanctions taken," said Peter
Haviland, co-chair of the Coali
tion for Affirmative Action in
Law Faculty Hiring.
Cavicke, however, said ban
ning Baker & McKenzie would
be a premature course of action
to take since the courts have not
rendered any verdict. He added
that sentiment to immediately
ban the firm demonstrates a
"lack of concern over due proc
ess."
Brest said the Law School is
not prepared to ban Baker &
McKenzie until more concrete
evidence concerning possible
discrimination is revealed.
