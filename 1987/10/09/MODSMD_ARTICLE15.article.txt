# Rare manuscript exhibit to begin

### Ted Lieu 
Original and rare historical documents
relating to the U.S. Constitution will go on
display in the Rotunda of Green Library
starting Monday.
Among the displays will be original edi
tions of works by Thomas Jefferson, Alexan
der Hamilton, Noah Webster, James
Madison and other prominent figures in U.S.
history. Other pieces of interest include Paul
Revere's famous engraving of the Boston
Massacre, the first public printing of the Con
stitution and a Harvard Commencement pro
gram.
The exhibit was organized and conceived

by Charles Tanenbaum, a prominent New
York lawyer and noted book collector. Ac
cording to Tanenbaum, "This will be the
major exhibit on the West Coast."
The original documents were selected by
Tanenbaum from various sources, including
the American Antiquarian Society and the
extensive collections of Marvin Weiner and
Michael Zinman.
Two themes Tanenbaum said he wants to
emphasize are union and government. There
are displays devoted to the evolution of state
and federal government, as well as docu
ments stressing colonial unity.
He has written a story catalog of the ex
hibit titled, "To Frame a Union: A Collec

tor's View of the Constitution on its Bicenten
nial."
Tanenbaum, who majored in mathematics
at Harvard and received a law degree from
Yale, has been collecting historical docu
ments for 25 years.
"The 125 or so documents represent a
dream collection for me," Tanenbaum said.
The exhibit begins at 3 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium Sunday with an illustrated
lecture by Jack Rakove, associate professor
of history, and a commentary by Andrew
Hoyem, printer and publisher of the Arion
Press. The exhibit will run until Jan. 6 and is
free and open to the public.
