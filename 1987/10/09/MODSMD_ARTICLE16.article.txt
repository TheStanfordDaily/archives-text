## The
						Stanford Daily Encore for Dean Fred 
### 
An Independent Newspaper

Yale has Whiffenpoofs, and Princeton has
clubs — institutions acquired with age that lend
the schools a personality.
Stanford, on the other hand, is still young.
While that youth gives us a flexibility of opportu
nity and an openness of spirit not found at our
ivied sisters, it also limits our contact with the
colorful sidelights of university life. Tomorrow,
however, the senior class will get the chance to
greet that colorful Stanford institution: ex-Dean
of Admissions Fred Hargadon.
Although he never met them, Dean Hargadon
profoundly shaped the lives of the Class of '88.
After all, he admitted them — his last class — to
Stanford, marking their acceptance letters with a
characterisitic "Great!" and the signature which
became his persona: "Dean Fred."
Indeed, Dean Fred was famous at Stanford
precisely because of his ability to create and
maintain that persona. He was able to break out
of his official duties and integrate himself into
the life of the campus as a whole. In so doing, he
became Dean Fred.
He attended nearly every Stanford sports
event, joining with the students and the Band in
cheers. He kept a high profile on campus, lunch-

ing with students at the Union or in dorms as of
ten as with University power-brokers at the Fac
ulty Club. He drove a stock '66 Mustang — fast
— with the personalized license plate
"ADMITS."
The Daily's comic strip capitalized on his
humanity by accusing him of using an Oijua
board on tough admissions cases, a charge that
Dean Fred never denied. But Hargadon guided
Stanford through its maturing phase in the 19705,
bringing together a talented and diverse student
body and an increasingly well-known faculty.
Students, faculty and administrators can learn
from the example set by Dean Fred. His distinct
personality, one without the reserve typical of
an academic dean, provided Stanford with a
living institution.
Too often, all of us at Stanford find ourselves
caught up in the day-to-day grind, performing
our appointed tasks without color or flair. Dean
Fred's success indicates the richness a sense of
play can bring to our school. We should remem
ber that it is out of such play, combined with
dedication and effort, that great institutions are
created.
