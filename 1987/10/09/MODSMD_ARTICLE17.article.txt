Invective against
prof, unwarranted
Clint Smith does not deserve
the invective directed by senior
Michael Yoffie to your Letters
section on Oct. 2. Rather, he
deserves our thanks for taking
time from a busy non-University
career to volunteer a sorely
needed course on a topic not
taught by Stanford faculty,
"Problems in U.S.-Mexico Rela
tions" (Latin American Studies
191.)
Two years ago, International
Relations Chair David Abernethy
encouraged Latin American
Studies to develop offerings on
diplomatic relations in this
hemishpere. Smith — whose ex
pertise draws upon 2X yuan* of
duty in the Foreign Service, prin
cipally in Latin America —
generously volunteered to teach
one course last year about U.S.-
Mexico diplomatic history, a
topic that current Stanford fac
ulty do not include in their teach
ing.
Demand for the course ex
ceeded expectations, and at my
request Smith agreed to offer a
similar course once again this au
tumn on a limited enrollment
basis as a seminar.
Yoffie can be forgiven for
resenting that the Time Schedule
mis-listed the room for the
course, and Latin American
Studies is to blame for not recog
nizing the error and correcting it
in Once Around the Quad. And
Yoffie's irritation at not being in

eluded among the seminar's lim
ited enrollment can be under
stood.
But to accuse Smith of sinister
motives and fradulent tactics in
setting and screening enrollment
for his class is unforgivable and
unfair. Any regular faculty mem
ber has the right to set reasonable
prerequisites for his or her
courses and to limit enrollment in
a seminar, and this prerogative
most certainly extends to non
faculty who donate their talents
to our programs in areas in which
they are lacking.

No one can chase
away Holy Spirit
In response to Leslie Kauf
man's viewpoint, "Bible groups
alienate" (Oct. 7), does Kauf
man, who claims to be a practic
ing Jew, realize that God is
everywhere?
For non-Christians, Bible
studies should offer them the
ideal chance to get to know
Christ more personally. How
else could Kaufman and the likes
of her know Jesus better if they
themselves resist meeting prac
ticing Christians? Let's face it:
Nobody, not even non-Christians
or atheists, can ever chase away
the Holy Spirit — be it in brot
hels or in dorms.
