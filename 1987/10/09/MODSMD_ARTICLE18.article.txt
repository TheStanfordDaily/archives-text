## Addressing a heckler's remarks 
### 
This is the editorial I thought about writing
last year after a heckler repeatedly disrupted
an Ed Zschau campaign stop here at Stan
ford. Tuesday night 1 saw Oliver North's
"Contra Slide Show" at Branner. About
halfway through the show someone tried to
grab the projector, saying (if I remember cor
rectly), "This is propaganda. It's a bunch of
lies. It's garbage. The contras are killing
people." I assume this was meant as an ex
planation or justification for his attempt to
end the slide show. I would like to address his
points.

Kurt Elieson

The slide show presented numerous
"facts" to support its conclusion. These
"facts" can be relatively easily verified or
proven false. According to the scientific
method now being taught in all Texas high
schools, that makes Oliver North's theory a
good one. If the "facts" are correct we
should be allowed to hear them. If they are
flimsy, that can be demonstrated, and there is
no need to disrupt the slide show.
"It's propaganda." It is okay for critics to
be biased against a theory, this helps them
make a stronger case. But proponents should
also be allowed to make the strongest possi
ble case in support of their position. There is
no real victory — or in this case certainty —
over a half-hearted defense That is
propaganda. Is the prize to be given for
silencing all further discussion or for bringing
new life to it?
"It's a bunch of lies." Maybe. Maybe not.
The lady with the Central American accent
sitting behind me didn't think so. If this per

son presents no further evidence to support
his claim, who am I supposed to believe?
Besides, if I am that easy to convince I would
not have wasted the evening becoming better
informed. I could simply have taken Presi
dent Reagan's word on the matter. Or my
mother's. And did he mean to make such a
sweeping statement and allow no rebuttal?
"It's garbage." Or in other words, it has no
value. The slide show explained well the
Reagan administration's view of a controver
sial national policy. That makes it worth un
derstanding. Even if I reject most of the pre
sented assumptions and conclusions, is he
sure that such a widely held view can offer
me nothing?
"They're killing people." Of course. No
one disputes that there is an armed conflict.
A condemnation that broad would include the
American Revolution, the Civil War and
World War 11. Did he expect everyone to do
that? The question is why and under what
conditions. Again, I would like to hear the
justification and a rebuttal.
But what most disturbed me was that he
thought his attempt to disrupt the meeting
was justified. The issue is dictatorship v.
democracy. (This can also serve as a con
demnation of most groups on both sides of
the Bork nomination battles, but I won't get
into that here.)
Dictators who seek moral legitimacy do so
based on a social agenda. This includes both
Gorbachev and Pinochet. We can call this
content. The people are not consulted about
this agenda, but that is OK because the dic
tator is right. In fact, he often protects the
people from learning what is wrong so that
eventually everyone will be enlightened
enough to agree on his agenda.
There is only one problem: How do we
decide who is right? One effective compro

mise is democracy. In a democracy everyone
gets to be equally right and have an equal
vote. The social agenda is not fixed; it is up to
the people to decide on. This works best
when the people can become informed. I'm
glad I live in a country where everyone has
agreed to do this. Everyone that is, except
certain government officials and someone
last Tuesday night. He complains about
Oliver North helping to deny people in
Central America their rights, while he denies
me mine under the First Amendment.

It is okay for critics to be
biased against a theory . . .
But proponents should also
be allowed to make the
strongest possible case in
support of their position.

I still have unanswered questions about our
country's policy in Central America. On the
left, how do we deal with countries that insist
on exporting the revolution to their neigh
bors? On the right, how do we deal with
countries where the man on the street is
forced to look for alternatives to a capitalism
that doesn't help him the way it does in the
United States?
I ask only that people not interfere with my
search for answers to these questions be
cause they will affect how I vote, how I exer
cise my chance to be right.

This is the editorial I thought about writing
last year after a heckler repeatedly disrupted
an Ed Zschau campaign stop here at Stan
ford. Tuesday night 1 saw Oliver North's
"Contra Slide Show" at Branner. About
halfway through the show someone tried to
grab the projector, saying (if I remember cor
rectly), "This is propaganda. It's a bunch of
lies. It's garbage. The contras are killing
people." I assume this was meant as an ex
planation or justification for his attempt to
end the slide show. I would like to address his
points.

Kurt Elieson

The slide show presented numerous
"facts" to support its conclusion. These
"facts" can be relatively easily verified or
proven false. According to the scientific
method now being taught in all Texas high
schools, that makes Oliver North's theory a
good one. If the "facts" are correct we
should be allowed to hear them. If they are
flimsy, that can be demonstrated, and there is
no need to disrupt the slide show.
"It's propaganda." It is okay for critics to
be biased against a theory, this helps them
make a stronger case. But proponents should
also be allowed to make the strongest possi
ble case in support of their position. There is
no real victory — or in this case certainty —
over a half-hearted defense That is
propaganda. Is the prize to be given for
silencing all further discussion or for bringing
new life to it?
"It's a bunch of lies." Maybe. Maybe not.
The lady with the Central American accent
sitting behind me didn't think so. If this per

son presents no further evidence to support
his claim, who am I supposed to believe?
Besides, if I am that easy to convince I would
not have wasted the evening becoming better
informed. I could simply have taken Presi
dent Reagan's word on the matter. Or my
mother's. And did he mean to make such a
sweeping statement and allow no rebuttal?
"It's garbage." Or in other words, it has no
value. The slide show explained well the
Reagan administration's view of a controver
sial national policy. That makes it worth un
derstanding. Even if I reject most of the pre
sented assumptions and conclusions, is he
sure that such a widely held view can offer
me nothing?
"They're killing people." Of course. No
one disputes that there is an armed conflict.
A condemnation that broad would include the
American Revolution, the Civil War and
World War 11. Did he expect everyone to do
that? The question is why and under what
conditions. Again, I would like to hear the
justification and a rebuttal.
But what most disturbed me was that he
thought his attempt to disrupt the meeting
was justified. The issue is dictatorship v.
democracy. (This can also serve as a con
demnation of most groups on both sides of
the Bork nomination battles, but I won't get
into that here.)
Dictators who seek moral legitimacy do so
based on a social agenda. This includes both
Gorbachev and Pinochet. We can call this
content. The people are not consulted about
this agenda, but that is OK because the dic
tator is right. In fact, he often protects the
people from learning what is wrong so that
eventually everyone will be enlightened
enough to agree on his agenda.
There is only one problem: How do we
decide who is right? One effective compro

mise is democracy. In a democracy everyone
gets to be equally right and have an equal
vote. The social agenda is not fixed; it is up to
the people to decide on. This works best
when the people can become informed. I'm
glad I live in a country where everyone has
agreed to do this. Everyone that is, except
certain government officials and someone
last Tuesday night. He complains about
Oliver North helping to deny people in
Central America their rights, while he denies
me mine under the First Amendment.

It is okay for critics to be
biased against a theory . . .
But proponents should also
be allowed to make the
strongest possible case in
support of their position.

I still have unanswered questions about our
country's policy in Central America. On the
left, how do we deal with countries that insist
on exporting the revolution to their neigh
bors? On the right, how do we deal with
countries where the man on the street is
forced to look for alternatives to a capitalism
that doesn't help him the way it does in the
United States?
I ask only that people not interfere with my
