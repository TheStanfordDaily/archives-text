I he United States should not allow
fundamental differences between it and
the Soviet Union to stand in the way of
international cooperation and commu
nication. according to Vladimir Pozner,
a prominent Soviet political observer
who spoke in Dinkeispiel Auditorium
last night.
Delivering a talk entitled "Realities
and Mythology in Soviet-American Re
lations" to an audience of about 300
people. Pozner pointed to key dis
similarities in American and Soviet
thought as well as basic economic and
political differences as the cause of

American reluctance to "work together
with the Soviet Union."
Pozner, a journalist and columnist in
the Soviet Union who has frequently
appeared on the ABC news program
"Nightline," said that the countries'
different interpretations of freedom and
human rights should not interfere with
cooperation or communication be
tween the two nations.
Pozner said the U.S. view of human
rights characterizes rights as being
"God-given," while the Soviets believe
that rights result from fulfilling certain
responsibilities in society.
"If we can't agree as to which rights

are the most important, can t we
at least agree that each side has a
viewpoint, rather than simply
dismiss the other side as not
having any rights at all?" Pozner
said.
He said the American media
perpetuates myths about the So
viet Union that began after the
Russian Revolution in 1918, and
as a result, many Americans fear
the Soviet Union.
As an example, Pozner cited
an editorial cartoon that ap

peared in the New York Times in
1918 depicting a large, bearded
man in a fur coat with a knife in
his teeth, holding a bomb in one
hand and an American flag in the
other. He said this initiated "a
fear that Soviet Russia will
destroy the American way of
life."
He also cited a report done by
American journalist Walter Lip
man that called the New York
Times' coverage of the Russian
Revolution "misleading news,
which is worse than none at all."
Pozner also mentioned more
recent articles as further ev
idence of biased American
reporting. He contended that a
Sept. 30 New York Times article

on a report by the human rights
group Amnesty International em
phasized the "harsh" Soviet
treatment of its inmates over
Chinese use of torture and the
death penalty.
But he conceded that the So
viet media is also biased.
"It would be far from balanced
to say that the Soviet Union has
not done the same," said Pozner,
who received his elementary and
high school education in New
York city before moving to the
Soviet Union to attend Moscow
University.
"The media in the Soviet Un
ion have tended to focus on some
of the negative aspects in the
U.S., such as homelessness,

drug abuse and crime, thereby
creating a picture that is not
balanced."
But Pozner characterized the
Soviet bias as being more
"benign."
"I have never seen a hatred or
a fear of Americans in the Soviet
Union. The Soviets are deeply
interested in America. We are in
fact far more interested in you
than the reverse," he said.
Noting the recent talks on in
termediate nuclear forces be
tween the United States and the
Soviet Union, Pozner said he
hoped increased cooperation will
eventually lead to a positive
change in American and Soviet
perceptions of each other.

of the negative aspects in the
U.S., such as homelessness,

drug abuse and crime, thereby
creating a picture that is not
balanced."
But Pozner characterized the
Soviet bias as being more
"benign."
"I have never seen a hatred or
a fear of Americans in the Soviet
Union. The Soviets are deeply
interested in America. We are in
fact far more interested in you
than the reverse," he said.
Noting the recent talks on in
termediate nuclear forces be
tween the United States and the
Soviet Union, Pozner said he
hoped increased cooperation will
eventually lead to a positive
change in American and Soviet
perceptions of each other.
