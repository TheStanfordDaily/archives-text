# Bork deserves high court seat
## 
### 
The Senate should confirm the nomination
of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.
Simply put, the case against Bork is not
strong enough to reject his appointment.
Charges of right-wing extremism are unjus
tified. People like Gerald Ford, Warren
Burger and Lloyd Cutler do not testify on be
half of right-wing extremists.

In fact, Bork's record both as solicitor gen
eral and as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court
of Appeals places him firmly within the main
stream of current legal thought. That is why
only one person Uohp Frank, $n attorney
from Phoenix, Ariz.) has challenged
(unsuccessfully) Bork's record as a prac
ticioner of the law.
No one doubts Bork's qualifications. Not
even the far left disputes Bork's professional
competence or judicial temperament.
No, of course not. The controversy swells
around what Bork has said or written in the
past. Conservatives have tried to dismiss
these attacks, defending Bork's writing as
provocative, tentative or irrelevent.
This will not do. It is high time Bork's sup
porters meet the critics head on and get to the
heart of these issues. These arguments are
not going to go away with simple assurances
of Bork's "mainstreamness."
Bork is a principled man, and he has not
hesitated to expand on those principles in the
past. In no uncertain terms, he has criticized
such landmark Supreme Court decisions as
Griswold v. Connecticut (striking down a law
outlawing contraception — Bork called the

law "nutty" but disagreed with the court's
reasoning) and Roe v. Wade, (legalizing abor
tion — Bork called it "wholly unconstitu
tional").
He has also challenged the court's recent
definition of "a general right to privacy."
Within an hour of the nomination, Senator
Kennedy was on the Senate floor arguing that
in "Judge Bork's America" women were
second class, blacks were not welcome at the
table and women seeking abortion would
return to the back alley butchers. Rhetorical
overkill, to be sure, but why haven't the
White House strategists buried these claims
in the nearest grave?
The answer to that is unclear, but a little
perspective will go a long way.
Bork respects precedent. He may disagree
with a decision, but that does not give carte
blanche to overturn it the first chance he gets.
As Bork testified, there are strong reasons
pot a precedent. Furthermore,
when Bprk criticizes a decision, he is not nec
essarily criticizing the result. For example,
he rejected Roe v. Wade because he felt the
matter should be left to the state and local au
thorities.
Similarly, Bork's qualm with the so called
"general right to privacy" is that it is unde
fined. The Constitution guarantees certain
privacies, such as freedom of religion and as
sembly, but does it protect the right of a
mother to molest her child in her home? Bork
is concerned that this "free-floating" right to
privacy could lead to dangerous results that
even its supporters do not anticipate. This is
certainly not an unwarranted fear on Bork's
part, and his critics should be just as con
cerned.
Some opponents have raised the question
of "balance" on the court, and have
compared the current situation to FDR's
court-packing scheme back in the 19305.

Consider the following: What if the same
logic had been used in the past? Would Plessy
v. Ferguson have been replaced by Brown v.
Board of Education? Would all of the
"progress" of the last 30 years, so valued by
Bork's opponents, have occurred? I doubt it.
Claims of "confirmation conversion" and
flip-flops against Bork have been exagger
ated. For example, Bork used to believe that
the government should not regulate interac
tion between the races. He has since con
cluded that sometimes it is necessary for the
government to step in and make the process
more efficient and more humane. That is the
kind of change a thoughtful, open- minded
man makes after serious deliberation.
The strongest argument against Bork is the
Ninth Amendment: "The enumeration in the
Constitution of certain rights shall not be con
strued to deny or disparage others retained
by the people."
A good case can be made that whfen
ideas of original intent and judicial restraint
fall short of justifying a desireJ result, (such
as the right to use contraception) Bork should
buttress the decision on the Ninth Amend
ment. But reasonable men can and do differ
on these legal issues, and there is nothing
heretical about saying that judges should try
to discern the intent of the framers of the
Constitution or defer to the judgement of the
American people.
Senator Warren Rudman said it best at the
Iran-contra hearings: "The American people
have the right to be wrong." If we make a bad
law, the judge must uphold it. People don't
seem to like that.
My crystal ball says Bork is probably
finished, and that's too bad. Bork would have
been a fine addition to the court and may
have proved a lot of his critics wrong.

such landmark Supreme Court decisions as
Griswold v. Connecticut (striking down a law
outlawing contraception — Bork called the

law "nutty" but disagreed with the court's
reasoning) and Roe v. Wade, (legalizing abor
tion — Bork called it "wholly unconstitu
tional").
He has also challenged the court's recent
definition of "a general right to privacy."
Within an hour of the nomination, Senator
Kennedy was on the Senate floor arguing that
in "Judge Bork's America" women were
second class, blacks were not welcome at the
table and women seeking abortion would
return to the back alley butchers. Rhetorical
overkill, to be sure, but why haven't the
White House strategists buried these claims
in the nearest grave?
The answer to that is unclear, but a little
perspective will go a long way.
Bork respects precedent. He may disagree
with a decision, but that does not give carte
blanche to overturn it the first chance he gets.
As Bork testified, there are strong reasons
pot a precedent. Furthermore,
when Bprk criticizes a decision, he is not nec
essarily criticizing the result. For example,
he rejected Roe v. Wade because he felt the
matter should be left to the state and local au
thorities.
Similarly, Bork's qualm with the so called
"general right to privacy" is that it is unde
fined. The Constitution guarantees certain
privacies, such as freedom of religion and as
sembly, but does it protect the right of a
mother to molest her child in her home? Bork
is concerned that this "free-floating" right to
privacy could lead to dangerous results that
even its supporters do not anticipate. This is
certainly not an unwarranted fear on Bork's
part, and his critics should be just as con
cerned.
Some opponents have raised the question
of "balance" on the court, and have
compared the current situation to FDR's
court-packing scheme back in the 19305.

Consider the following: What if the same
logic had been used in the past? Would Plessy
v. Ferguson have been replaced by Brown v.
Board of Education? Would all of the
"progress" of the last 30 years, so valued by
Bork's opponents, have occurred? I doubt it.
Claims of "confirmation conversion" and
flip-flops against Bork have been exagger
ated. For example, Bork used to believe that
the government should not regulate interac
tion between the races. He has since con
cluded that sometimes it is necessary for the
government to step in and make the process
more efficient and more humane. That is the
kind of change a thoughtful, open- minded
man makes after serious deliberation.
The strongest argument against Bork is the
Ninth Amendment: "The enumeration in the
Constitution of certain rights shall not be con
strued to deny or disparage others retained
by the people."
A good case can be made that whfen
ideas of original intent and judicial restraint
fall short of justifying a desireJ result, (such
as the right to use contraception) Bork should
buttress the decision on the Ninth Amend
ment. But reasonable men can and do differ
on these legal issues, and there is nothing
heretical about saying that judges should try
to discern the intent of the framers of the
Constitution or defer to the judgement of the
American people.
Senator Warren Rudman said it best at the
Iran-contra hearings: "The American people
have the right to be wrong." If we make a bad
law, the judge must uphold it. People don't
seem to like that.
My crystal ball says Bork is probably
finished, and that's too bad. Bork would have
been a fine addition to the court and may
have proved a lot of his critics wrong.

The Senate should confirm the nomination
of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.
Simply put, the case against Bork is not
strong enough to reject his appointment.
Charges of right-wing extremism are unjus
tified. People like Gerald Ford, Warren
Burger and Lloyd Cutler do not testify on be
half of right-wing extremists.

In fact, Bork's record both as solicitor gen
eral and as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court
of Appeals places him firmly within the main
stream of current legal thought. That is why
only one person Uohp Frank, $n attorney
from Phoenix, Ariz.) has challenged
(unsuccessfully) Bork's record as a prac
ticioner of the law.
No one doubts Bork's qualifications. Not
even the far left disputes Bork's professional
competence or judicial temperament.
No, of course not. The controversy swells
around what Bork has said or written in the
past. Conservatives have tried to dismiss
these attacks, defending Bork's writing as
provocative, tentative or irrelevent.
This will not do. It is high time Bork's sup
porters meet the critics head on and get to the
heart of these issues. These arguments are
not going to go away with simple assurances
of Bork's "mainstreamness."
Bork is a principled man, and he has not
hesitated to expand on those principles in the
past. In no uncertain terms, he has criticized
such landmark Supreme Court decisions as
Griswold v. Connecticut (striking down a law
