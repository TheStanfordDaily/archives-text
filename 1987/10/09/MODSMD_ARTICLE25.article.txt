## Concert Network struggles to overcome past snafus 
### Vivian Rogers 
Fans of popular artists David
Bowie and Madonna were disap
pointed last May when proposals
fell through for concerts by either
artist in Stanford Stadium. The
"Bowie-Madonna fiasco," as it
is now known by members of the
Stanford Concert Network,
seemed to many to be just an
other blunder by that organiza
tion.
According to Jim Durkin,
former director of the Concert
Network, controversy about the
Network last year revolved
around three general problems: a
lack of funds to bring a popular
rock group to campus, poor rela
tions with Bay Area concert
promoter Bill Graham and
reduced program funding as a
result of high staff salaries.
Compounding the Network's
problems, Business Manager
Tim Self resigned last March,
and Director Patrick O'Hara also
quit his position after the spring
Grateful Dead concert.
This year is the group's first as
part of the ASSU. With new
management and a new staff, the
organization hopes to improve its
effectiveness.
Last week's concert in the
Quad, featuring the Tubes, was a

first step in this direction. The
event, sponsored jointly by the
ASSU and the Concert Network,
was the first of its kind after the
ASSU criticized the Network
and came close to voiding the or
ganization's fee assessment last
year.
Durkin, now a Council of
Presidents member, said the
event went smoothly because of
the Concert Network's involve
ment.
"We're trying to build some
groundwork now so that in the
future Stanford will be a concert
location for bands coming
through the Bay Area," said Phil
Klein, this year's Concert Net
work director. "Our major prob
lem now is (reserving the)
facilities on campus.'
According to Klein, the
"Bowie-Madonna fiasco" re
sulted from a lapse in communi
cation between the University
and the Concert Network.
Problems arose after a South
ern California promotor ap
proached a member of the Net
work's administration board
about the possibility of holding a
concert in the stadium this past
summer. Before waiting for Uni
versity approval, the board mem
ber spoke to the ASSU about the
proposal.

" The University thought we
were going behind their back by
announcing the concert before
we had University approval,"
Klein said.
According to a column that
Durkin wrote for the Daily
("Gotta have some rock n'
roll," Feb. 17), monetary prob
lems hampered the Network's
ability to organize a large-scale
concert. A fee assesment of

$36,750 "isn't enough to make it
in the major concert production
business," Durkin said.

Durkin said he also believed
that staff member salaries total
ling a few thousand dollars a year
combined with a $8,000-a-year
salary for a faculty adviser
drained the group's resources.
However, Concert Network
General Manager Tim Wood
disagreed. "We are not draining

funds," he said. "The Grateful
Dead concert is our most consis
tent money-making event." The
Dead concert, along with com
edy and jazz shows, brings in
enough money to pay for em
ployee salaries, according to
Wood.
Although the salary for the fac
ulty adviser was not approved by
the student body in last spring s
elections, Tresidder Union will
pay for the position.
"The position is important
enough to us to have lobbied for
funds," Klein said.
Of this year's Concert Net
work budget, $25,000 is ear
marked for concerts, with $5000
allotted for each show.
Durkin said he believes the
new budget will help bring better
groups to Stanford. "The Con
cert Network can try for better
concerts knowing they can lose
up to $5000 if they have to," he
said, adding that this year's staff
has the potential to do a better
job than last year's staff.
"We have a fantastic staff this
year. We're supported also by a
good board (of directors)," Klein
added.
According to Klein, the
group's main objective this year
is to locate a place to host a con
cert.

Currently under consideration
is Maples Pavilion, which is un
dergoing a study to see if it will
support capacity crowds.
"Memorial Auditorium would
be great," Klein said, "but we're
living with the legacy of the Red
Hot Chili Peppers."
Memorial Auditorium was
damaged considerably by the au
dience attending Red Hot Chili
Peppers concert two years ago.
"We didn't expect the band to
come out on the stage and yell for
people to 'rip the place apart,'
which is what they did," Klein
said.
Another problem facing the
Network is that scheduling for
Memorial Auditorium is done a
year ahead of time. Reservations
cannot be made without the
name of the group that will be
performing. "We don't know
who will be available until a
couple of months before the
date," Klein said.
"I understand their problem,
but it would be unfair to other
groups if Memorial Auditorium
was left empty on an available
night because we let the Concert
Network reserve a date without a
group." said Lois Wagner, direc
tor of University Events and
Services.
