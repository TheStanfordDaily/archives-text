## Creativity is the main fatality 
### James Lujan Editorial Staff 
OK, here it is — one more ex
ample of a film director being
pressured to compromise his or
her artistic integrity in order to
appeal to a wider audience and
make a lot of money for the
studio. I'm talking about "Fatal
Attraction."
"Fatal Attraction" has
become one of the most success
ful fall releases since Crocodile
Dundee left his Aussie homeland
to come to America. The un
precedented popularity of "Fatal
Attraction" is mostly well
deserved. On the surface, it's a
highly entertaining, slickly well
made, bite-your-nails psycholog
ical thriller directed by Adrian
Lyne (who also made "Flash
dance" and "9 Ml Weeks").
Beneath the surface, however,
there are some mixed messages
about loneliness, infidelity and
feminism that never quite make
the impact they should. This film
could have been a great deal
darker, deeper and more power
ful than it is, but instead it ends
up selling out to the mass-market
commercial mentality which has
ruined so many movies in the
past.
In the film, Glenn Close plays
Alex Forrest, a lonely, emotion
ally unstable woman who, after a
brief fling with married man Dan
Gallagher (played by Michael
Douglas), simply won't leave him
alone despite his tactful attempts
to tell her that they can't see each
other anymore. Furthermore,

she tells him that she loves him,
she wants to be with him and,
later, that he has a responsibility
to their unborn child.
Douglas, playing the part of a
decent enough guy, uses every
logical means at his disposal to
get Alex ofThis back. He eventu
ally spills out the truth to his
wife, but even that fails to work.
Alex persists in her pursuit of
Gallagher's love; it's an obses
sion that gradually grows more
and more passionate and violent.
Now, that right there is some
pretty scary stuff. Indeed, the
first three-fourths of this movie is
enthralling — it's one of the most
evocative thrillers I've seen in
years. Its heartbreakingly vivid,
yet disturbingly unnerving depic
tion of Close's character gets you
feeling sorry for her and dreading
her at the same time.
The incidents which comprise
the last fourth of the film totally
obliterate the intelligent, solid
foundation upon which the plot
has been built. If you haven't
seen the movie and you want to,
don't read any further. If you
have seen the movie, then you
know that it winds up with a
climax reminiscent of every
"Halloween" ripoff west of
Golan-Globus.
I for one could not believe it
when 1 saw that the film's climax
actually contained one of those
"the killer is not really dead"
scenes. You know the one,
where Alex, supposedly dead
after supposedly having been

drowned in the tub by Gallagher,
suddenly rises from the bathtub
to attack him, only to be shot in
the nick of time by Gallagher's
wife. With this scene, any hint of
realism is tossed out the window
and replaced by a calculated at
tempt to milk all the potential
cheap thrills in order to satiate an
entertainment-starved audience
with a gratuitous, happy ending.
The worst part is that the end
ing didn't have to be this way.
The movie was originally in
tended to conclude with Alex
committing suicide, having previ
ously arranged it so that Gallag
her would be set up to take the
blame. The producers apparently
felt that this ending would be a
real bummer, so they re-filmed it
to give it a neat, conveniently ex
citing conclusion that would be
eaten up by moviegoers.
In doing this, the producers
sacrificed the artistic integrity of
the project, thereby subverting
any message which may have
been trying to get through.
With the re-filmed ending,
audiences get a clear-cut view of
Alex as a wildly deranged psyc
hopath who winds up trying to
kill Gallagher and his wife, and
who turns out to have no more
emotional depth than the
maniacs in "Friday the 13th."
On the other hand, the original
ending intensifies and justifies

her anger toward men by symbol
izing their inconsiderate,
manipulative, selfish ways. Also,
Alex becomes more of a
desperately lonely, tragic figure
who cries out for attention, affec
tion and love but never gets any
of them.

This film could have
been a great deal
darker, deeper and
more powerful than
it is, but instead it
ends up selling out.

Without the original ending,
Alex's implicit feminist message
of being treated like dirt by a man
is twisted around to favor the in
ference that Gallagher is a man
endangered by a frenzied killer.
Granted, this ending is a real
downer, but it provides a suitable
capper for a powerful theme that
is blunted if not lost by the
crowd-pleasing ending actually
used in the film.
Now, don't get me wrong here.
I can enjoy a mindless slice-'em
and-dice-'em flick just as much
as the next guy. But "Fatal At
traction" isn't mindless. It had
the potential to be much, much
more, but it fell short.
