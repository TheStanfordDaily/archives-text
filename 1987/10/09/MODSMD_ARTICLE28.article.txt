# 'Maurice:' a visual delight
## 
### Valentin T. Aguirre 
"Maurice," directed by
James Ivory, is an excellent
new film based on the book of
the same title by E.M.
Forster, who wrote such
greats as "A Room With a
View" and "A Passage to In
dia."
This visually delicious film
chronicles the story of
Maurice Hall, a Cambridge
student who comes to grips
with being gay in the early
1900s. Maurice, a typical Eng
lish student, confronts his
homosexuality after falling in
love with a fellow student, a
love which was then referred
to as the "unspeakable vice."
The movie begins with
Maurice as a young teenager
being told about the "birds
and the bees" from a
schoolmaster, who offers the
adolescent information about
sex. Of course, as is the case
with most sex education even
today, the schoolmaster
ignores mentioning homo
sexual relationships, which
underscores how Maurice is
immediately made to believe
that he is abnormal and abhor
rent. Nevertheless, the scene

illustrates problems that gay
teenagers like Maurice face
during adolescence, while also
preparing the audience for the
meat of the movie.
When we next see Maurice,
well played by James Wilby,
he is at Cambridge in 1909.
The cinematography, in the
way that it captures the beauti
ful scenery of the school, is
stunning. The film recreates a
period of formality and beauty
that Cambridge in the early
1900s offered, a distinct con
trast to the palm trees and Ber
muda shorts here at Stanford.
On the colorfully romantic
campus, Maurice, after initial
hesitation, befriends a student
by the name of Clive Durham.
It takes a year for the two to
advance to anything more than
a friendship, and even then
they don't become sexual
partners. Maurice comes to
realize that his love is
restricted by society's
demands, specifically because
gay relations are considered
by the upper class to be illegal
and highly scandalous.
The film deals with issues
other than gay love, such as
class struggle and love between
upper and lower classes. At first
glance the characters seem to ex
ist on equal levels, but a second
look shows that societal standing
presents many problems in the

love-life of Maurice.
The story also inadvertantly
displays how snobbish and sexist
Maurice becomes when he sup
presses his true identity, present
ing the audience with a complex
character who transcends the
time period of the movie and
becomes relevant to the present,
when gay issues are most contro
versial.

The movie is a little choppy in
the beginning, and the English
spoken is sometimes hard to fol
low, but the acting is excellent
and the photography is breath
taking. It does help if the book is
read before seeing the movie, as
the director is very faithful to
Forster's writing.
But it isn't very important,
since the movie stands very well

on its own. The movie is one that
will definitely cross over from
gay moviegoers to non-gay
moviegoers. And for those of you
wondering, there are no sex
scenes in the movie, but there are
some scenes that are very sen
sual. The movie is rated R, and,
yes, it is one that you can see
with your mom, if she has good
taste in movies.
