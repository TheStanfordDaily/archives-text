## Cardinal seeks first win at Washington State 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
The Stanford football team
finds itself in the same situation
that it was in last week heading
into the UCLA game: Tailback
Brad Muster is out and a sopho
more quarterback may make his
first collegiate start.
Tomorrow, however, the win
less Cardinal (0-4 overall and 0-2
in the Pacific 10 Conference) will
be at Washington State (2-2, 0-0),
and the new quarterback may be
Brian Johnson.
Johnson, who mopped up at
the end of last week s 49-0 fiasco
against UCLA, has had a good
week of practice, according to
Stanford Coach Jack Elway. In
his one minute and four seconds
at the Cardinal helm against the
Bruins, Johnson completed three
of four passes for 37 yards and
moved the ball from the Stanford
20 to the UCLA 32-yard line
before his final pass was inter
cepted.
Earlier this week, Elway said
that Johnson was "doing a great
job" and that the sophomore was
"in the picture" at quarterback
along with sophomore Scott
Stark, who started against
UCLA, and senior Greg Ennis,
who started the first three games
of the season. Elway said all
three would get work in practice
this week, but Johnson and Stark

have gotten most of the repeti
tions.
Although Elway reported on
Monday that the team was
"injury free," Muster has not
practiced this week and is
unlikely to play tomorrow. The
senior running back, who missed
Stanford's first two games with a
severely sprained left ankle, did
not play against UCLA after
bruising ligaments in the same
ankle Sept. 30.
Ankle injuries must be in
vogue, because Washington
State has three of them. Defen
sive backs James Hasty and
Artie Holmes, the fourth and
fifth-leading tacklers on the
team, respectively, have ankle
problems and are not at full
strength, although both should be
available. Defensive tackle Steve
Cromer also has a bad ankle and
is listed as doubtful for the game.
Defensive back Shawn
Landrum will start, despite un
dergoing eye surgery for a
detached retina last week.
The Cougars started off the
season well, winning their first
two games under new Coach
Dennis Erickson. Washington
State then fell to Michigan before
a crowd of 103,521 at Ann Arbor,
and lost at Colorado a week later.
Washington State was idle last
week before facing Stanford, and
along with some extra rest, the
Cougars have some extra incen
tive. Not only is tomorrow the

Pac-10 opener for WSU, but it is
also homecoming it Pullman â€” a
prett> big deal up there, where
not much else happens. The
Cougars would also like to vind
icate a 42-12 loss at Stanford last
season.
"They're operating with a lot
of confidence," Elway said of
Washington State. "They're
moving the football and scoring a
lot of points."
In fact, the perenially unpre
dictable Cougars are second in
the conference in scoring, with
an average of nearly 30 points per
game. Credit for this success
goes to quarterback Timm
Rosenbach, who has thrown
seven touchdown passes and run
for two others. Rosenbach has
completed 93 of 165 passes for
1068 yards, and is first in the Pac
-10 in total offense, averaging
291.5 total yards per game. The
sophomore has, however,
thrown seven interceptions.
"Like any young quarterback,
he's had some growing pains,"
Erickson said. "He's made some
mistakes, but he's also made
some big plays for us."
Rosenbach's favorite target is
tight end Chris Leighton, who
has 24 receptions for 235 yards.
Sophomore receiver Tim Stall
worth, cousin of Pittsburgh
Steeler star John Stallworth, is
averaging 21.4 yards per catch,

Junior Scott Kschelman has seen a lot of playing time in the Cardinal backfield with the nagging injuries to
Brad Muster and Marshall Dillard, and Muster figures to miss tomorrow's contest at Washington State as
well.
