# Jewish Studies program launched

Observant students will notice
a new section in this year's
Courses and Degrees: the pro
gram in Jewish Studies that was
organized last fall.
Consisting of a series of
courses about Jewish history,
culture and religion, the program
does not include a major, al
though students may declare
Jewish Studies as an individually
designed major.
According to John Felstiner, a
professor of English and a mem

ber of the Jewish Studies Faculty
Advisory Committee, the pro
gram was formed because it is a
central field of study that has
been almost "totally neglected"
at Stanford.
Lawrence Berman, professor
of religious studies and a member
of the Jewish Studies Faculty
Advisory Committee, said the
program was formed to fill a need
for dealing with Jewish history,
culture, religion and literature,
all of which form an important,
but missing, dimension in the
study of the humanities and the

social sciences at Stanford.
However, Arnold Eisen, asso
ciate professor of religious
studies and co-director of the
Jewish Studies program, said
that although Stanford was be
hind other universities in estab
lishing this program, the Jewish
studies programs at Harvard,
Yale and Brown were only estab
lished in the last decade.
Although the idea for the pro
gram at Stanford was conceived
in 1975, it was not until a couple
of years ago that a committee of
concerned people came together

to discuss the formation of the
program.
Last year, with the help of
Amos Funkenstein, professor of
history and a co-director of the
Jewish Studies program, and
Eisen, an Aaron Roland Fellow
in the Department of Religious
Studies, the program was finally
created.
Stanford's acquisition of the
Salo Baron Library was a great
windfall for the Jewish Studies
program. This collection of rare
Jewish manuscripts, books and
medieval texts belonged to Salo
Baron, who Eisen calls the
"greatest living Jewish histo
rian." The library, which con
tains over 20,000 books, was pur
chased by Stanford last year for
one million dollars.
Felstiner said he believes that
Baron sold his collection to Stan
ford rather than to other univer
sities with older Jewish Studies
Programs because he thought
that Stanford is riding on a
"wave of immense popularity"
right now. Although Stanford's
program is new. Baron believed
that the librarians here would
treat his collection well, Felstiner
said.
The library is currently housed
in Green Library, with the more

rare books housed in the library's
Special Collections section.
Both Eisen and Felstiner said
they feel that more students, in
cluding graduates, are taking
courses in Jewish Studies now
that it has become a program. Al
though only three courses are of
fered this quarter, more will be
offered next quarter and in the
years ahead.
The ratio of Jewish to non-
Jewish students taking these
courses is about equal, Eisen
said, adding that he finds these
figures encouraging.
According to Felstiner, a stu
dent majoring in Jewish Studies
would have to be dedicated be
cause the major, which is self
designed, would be non-tra
ditional. Most students will
double major in Jewish Studies
and a traditiorÂ»aUfield, such as

history or humanities, he said.
In order to establish a major in
the Jewish Studies program, the
directors must follow a path
similar to the one that was fol
lowed by the Values, Technol
ogy, Science and Society depart
ment, which began to offer a
major a couple of years ago.
To set this process in motion,
enough students must form indi
vidually designed majors (IDM)
in Jewish Studies so that the IDM
Committee recommends that the
program petition the Committee
in Undergraduate Studies to offer
a major.
Lastly, the Faculty Senate
must give final approval. Berman
said that while he expects many
more students to declare Jewish
Studies as a major, it will be four
or five years before the I DM
Committee will recommend that

the Jewish Studies program of
fers a major.
Eisen said he plans to develop
the program through meetings
with the faculty, the administra
tion and the community.
The Jewish community at
Stanford has formed an advisory
board to raise funds and to give
advice on how the program will
benefit Stanford and the sur
rounding community.
Felstiner said he hopes to es
tablish an overseas center in
Jerusalem by 1988. The center
will be an "integral part of the
major," he said.
Presently, Eisen is working on
an exchange between Stanford,
UC-Berkeley and the Graduate
I heological Union, whereby stu
dents from the three institutions
would be able to take classes at
the other schools.
