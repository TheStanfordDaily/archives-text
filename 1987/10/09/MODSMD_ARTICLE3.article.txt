Observant students will notice
a new section in this year's
Courses and Degrees: the pro
gram in Jewish Studies that was
organized last fall.
Consisting of a series of
courses about Jewish history,
culture and religion, the program
does not include a major, al

social sciences at Stanford.

Jewish Studies program, said
that although Stanford was be

studies programs at Harvard,
Yale and Brown were only estab

Although the idea for the pro
gram at Stanford was conceived
in 1975, it was not until a couple
of years ago that a committee of
concerned people came together

to discuss the formation of the
program.
Last year, with the help of
Amos Funkenstein, professor of
history and a co-director of the
Jewish Studies program, and
Eisen, an Aaron Roland Fellow
in the Department of Religious
Studies, the program was finally
created.
Stanford's acquisition of the
Salo Baron Library was a great
windfall for the Jewish Studies
program. This collection of rare
