# No. 1, No. 2 meet in Berkeley
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
When these two water polo teams
meet, it's not a question of how good
the match will he, it's a question of
how great the match will be.
The two teams are the Stanford Car
dinal and the California Golden Hears,
and to understand the magnitude of
each meeting between these two pro
grams, one needs only to understand
one simple fact: In the past 14 years,
Stanford and Cal have each won six
NCAA championships, usually with
the other as runner-up, leaving only
two for the rest of the country's Divi
sjpn I teams.
According to Stanford Coach Dante
Dettamanti, whose team plays at Cal's
Spieker Pool tonight at 7 p.m., the 1979
championship, won by UC-Santa Bar
bara, "was one of those fluky things —
Cal or Stanford probably should've
won." And in 1982, the Cardinal
finished second to UC-Irvine. So even
the titles won by the "other guys"
could just as easily have been taken by
one of the cross-bay rivals.
Over the 14 years, the series record
has Stanford well ahead at 32-20-3, on
the strength of two undefeated
seasons. The Cardinal's victory over
Cal in last season's title game was its
sixth against the Bears in a season that
saw Stanford beat its opponents by an
average score of 14-5.
As it stands right now, the odds are
in favor of another Cardinal or Bear
championship, with the teams alternat
ing between the No. 1 and No. 2
rankings since the season began. But
three other schools are threatening,
each of which Dettamanti considers
very dangerous. Last week Stanford
(12-2) was on top, but after winning
"only" two of three matches over the
weekend, it has dropped to No. 2, with
Cal (11-2), by virtue of wins over

UCLA and Irvine over the weekend,
rising to the No. I position it had occu
pied two weeks ago.
Already this fall, Stanford and Cal
have met twice, with each team taking
one victory. On Sept. 20 at Irvine,
having earlier in the day beaten UC-
Irvine in overtime, the Cardinal fell 10-
8 at the paws of the Bears. A week
later, Stanford got its revenge, winning
4-2 at Cal.
The latter match was marked by
lenience on the part of the referees,
who called only one kickout. Conse
quently, the play was physical and the
offenses stifled. Both Stanford and Cal
have characteristics which come to the
fore in a slow game of set plays. The
Cardinal's holemen are led by Erich
Fischer, considered the best in the na
tion at a position around which set of
fenses usually center. Meanwhile, the
Bears are bigger at most positions than
their Stanford counterparts, giving
them a slight edge in physical play.
While the teams' strengths offset
each other in a slow game, a faster
game, such as the one Dettamanti ex
pects tonight, would highlight the real
heart of both teams: speed, bench
strength and counterattacks that can
win a game in a matter of minutes.
Of course, when any competitors
meet, the physical aspects of the match
often take a back seat to, or at least are
a direct consequence of, mental
strength and maneuvering.
In the strength department, Det
tamanti sees the Cardinal with a slight
edge. "I don't think Cal respects us.
They just don't want to think that
highly of us — at least some of their
players don't," he said. "It could be
that they'll try too hard to score. They
feel they can shoot from anywhere and
the balls are going to go in the cage."
However, as quickly as the Bears
might denounce a Stanford team that

lost five starters, their ever-animated
coach Pete Cutino cautioned his team
against any overconfidence. "He
respects us," Dettamanti said.
As it always has been since Det
tamanti took over the Cardinal pro
gram 11 years ago and first coached a
Stanford team against Cutino's Bears,
fans can take leave of the excitemtnt in
the pool and find excitement of equal
or greater enjoyment on the pool's
decks, where Cutino — with shaven
head, silver moustache and intimidat
ing build — attempts to outdo the less
physically imposing (but equally Sten
torian) Dettamanti in a shouting match,
drowning out all but the most
vociferous crowds.
Coaching will be especially vital if
either of the teams gains a six-on-five
advantage following the ejection of a
physical player. "It's going to be a
chess game on the advantages," Det
tamanti said.
Cal is led by senior Kirk Everist and
often sparked by senior Matt Biondi
(the same Biondi who holds the world
record in the 100-meter freestyle), who
can strike quickly with his speed or
powerful right arm, which has been
known to propel scoring shots from far
outside the usual range. In contrast to
the new makeup of the Cardinal, the
Bears have lost nobody from last
season's No. 2 team.
Stanford's most recent statistics
show Fischer far ahead of his
teammates with 31 goals. Matt Tingler,
Grant Stanley and Jeff Oeding each
have 12, one ahead of Erik Blum and
Andrew Lawson. The Cardinal hopes
to close the gap between Fischer and
the rest by generating more offense in
the frontcourt. Tonight's game is Stan
ford's second Pacific 10 Conference
match of the season. The Cardinal lost
its first to UCLA last Saturday.

Cardinal's holemen are led by Erich
Fischer, considered the best in the na
tion at a position around which set of
fenses usually center. Meanwhile, the
Bears are bigger at most positions than
their Stanford counterparts, giving
them a slight edge in physical play.
While the teams' strengths offset
each other in a slow game, a faster
game, such as the one Dettamanti ex
pects tonight, would highlight the real
heart of both teams: speed, bench
strength and counterattacks that can
win a game in a matter of minutes.
Of course, when any competitors
meet, the physical aspects of the match
often take a back seat to, or at least are
a direct consequence of, mental
strength and maneuvering.
In the strength department, Det
tamanti sees the Cardinal with a slight
edge. "I don't think Cal respects us.
They just don't want to think that
highly of us — at least some of their
players don't," he said. "It could be
that they'll try too hard to score. They
feel they can shoot from anywhere and
the balls are going to go in the cage."
However, as quickly as the Bears
might denounce a Stanford team that

lost five starters, their ever-animated
coach Pete Cutino cautioned his team
against any overconfidence. "He
respects us," Dettamanti said.
As it always has been since Det
tamanti took over the Cardinal pro
gram 11 years ago and first coached a
Stanford team against Cutino's Bears,
fans can take leave of the excitemtnt in
the pool and find excitement of equal
or greater enjoyment on the pool's
decks, where Cutino — with shaven
head, silver moustache and intimidat
ing build — attempts to outdo the less
physically imposing (but equally Sten
torian) Dettamanti in a shouting match,
drowning out all but the most
vociferous crowds.
Coaching will be especially vital if
either of the teams gains a six-on-five
advantage following the ejection of a
physical player. "It's going to be a
chess game on the advantages," Det
tamanti said.
Cal is led by senior Kirk Everist and
often sparked by senior Matt Biondi
(the same Biondi who holds the world
record in the 100-meter freestyle), who
can strike quickly with his speed or
powerful right arm, which has been
known to propel scoring shots from far
outside the usual range. In contrast to
the new makeup of the Cardinal, the
Bears have lost nobody from last
season's No. 2 team.
Stanford's most recent statistics
show Fischer far ahead of his
teammates with 31 goals. Matt Tingler,
Grant Stanley and Jeff Oeding each
have 12, one ahead of Erik Blum and
Andrew Lawson. The Cardinal hopes
to close the gap between Fischer and
the rest by generating more offense in
the frontcourt. Tonight's game is Stan
ford's second Pacific 10 Conference
match of the season. The Cardinal lost
its first to UCLA last Saturday.

Junior Jeff Oeding is tied for third in scoring on a Cardinal team which has rotated be
tween No. 1 and No. 2 with C'al the last two weeks.
When these two water polo teams
meet, it's not a question of how good
the match will he, it's a question of
how great the match will be.
The two teams are the Stanford Car
dinal and the California Golden Hears,
and to understand the magnitude of
each meeting between these two pro
grams, one needs only to understand
one simple fact: In the past 14 years,
Stanford and Cal have each won six
NCAA championships, usually with
the other as runner-up, leaving only
two for the rest of the country's Divi
sjpn I teams.
According to Stanford Coach Dante
Dettamanti, whose team plays at Cal's
Spieker Pool tonight at 7 p.m., the 1979
championship, won by UC-Santa Bar
bara, "was one of those fluky things —
Cal or Stanford probably should've
won." And in 1982, the Cardinal
finished second to UC-Irvine. So even
the titles won by the "other guys"
could just as easily have been taken by
one of the cross-bay rivals.
Over the 14 years, the series record
has Stanford well ahead at 32-20-3, on
the strength of two undefeated
seasons. The Cardinal's victory over
Cal in last season's title game was its
sixth against the Bears in a season that
saw Stanford beat its opponents by an
average score of 14-5.
As it stands right now, the odds are
in favor of another Cardinal or Bear
championship, with the teams alternat
ing between the No. 1 and No. 2
rankings since the season began. But
three other schools are threatening,
each of which Dettamanti considers
very dangerous. Last week Stanford
(12-2) was on top, but after winning
"only" two of three matches over the
weekend, it has dropped to No. 2, with
Cal (11-2), by virtue of wins over

UCLA and Irvine over the weekend,
rising to the No. I position it had occu
pied two weeks ago.
Already this fall, Stanford and Cal
have met twice, with each team taking
one victory. On Sept. 20 at Irvine,
having earlier in the day beaten UC-
Irvine in overtime, the Cardinal fell 10-
8 at the paws of the Bears. A week
later, Stanford got its revenge, winning
4-2 at Cal.
The latter match was marked by
lenience on the part of the referees,
who called only one kickout. Conse
quently, the play was physical and the
offenses stifled. Both Stanford and Cal
have characteristics which come to the
fore in a slow game of set plays. The
Cardinal's holemen are led by Erich
Fischer, considered the best in the na
tion at a position around which set of
fenses usually center. Meanwhile, the
Bears are bigger at most positions than
