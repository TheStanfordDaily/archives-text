# Spikers face Ducks, Beavers
## 
### Chris Trader Editorial staff 
Hunting season has now been
officially opened in the Pacific
Northwest.
The Cardinal women's volley
ball squad travels to Oregon
State and Oregon this weekend
with the sole intention of shoot
ing down both the Beavers and
the Ducks. The match at Corval
lis is tonight at 7:30 p.m., while
Stanford takes on Oregon Satur
day night in Eugene.
The Beavers aren't expected
to provide much of a challege —
they are 1-10 this year, 0-6 in
Pacific 10 Conference play — but
they gave the Cardinal all they
could handle last year. The
Beavers stretched Stanford to
five games at Corvallis last
season, and the fourth-ranked
Cardinal cannot afford to take
the match lightly.
OSU does appear weaker this
year, as they have not won since
their season opener against
Lewis and Clark and have a Pac
-10 low .081 team hitting per
centage. The Beavers are also
last in blocking, digging and kills,
but the young squad is improving
rapidly and is eager for a league
victory.
The top player for OSU is
middle blocker Tami Good, who

leads the team in many statistical
categories and, as a senior, pro
vides leadership for the young
Beavers.
After the OSU match, Stan
ford will look to shoot down the
high-flying Ducks. Oregon is now
ranked 11th in the country and is
nesting high above the Pac-1()
with a 6-0 league mark.
The Ducks have two of the big
gest guns in the country in senior
Teri Kramer and sophomore
Michele Krebsbach. Kramer has
a shot at becoming only the
second person in NCAA history
to record 2(XM) kills in a career,
and may even break the national
record, held, coincidentally, by a
former Duck, Sue Harbour.
Krebsbach also had a tremen
dous season last year, as she was
in the top five nationally in kills
most of last year and was named
the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year.
The big reason for the Ducks'
success this season, however, is
that sophomore setter Stephanie
Snyder has used her other hitters
more effectively, and the likes of
Pac-10 blocking leader Lauri
Krejcha, Eva Windlin and
Monica Camp have spelled trou
ble for opposing teams.
The Cardinal seems ready for
the challenge, though. While
Oregon has a nine-match win
streak, the Cardinal has won six

straight, including consecutive
wins over No. 14 UC-Santa Bar
bara, No. 10 Texas and No. 12
San Jose State.
Leading the Stanford attack is
senior middle blocker Nancy
Reno. The Glen Ellyn, 111., native
was named the Pac-10 Player of
the Week for last week, as she
was named the MVP of the Jos
tens Invitational Tournament last
weekend. She had 50 kills and 55
digs in only nine games last
week.
Reno was named to the All-
Pac-10 second team last season,
and if the first month of this
season is any indication, she ll
exchange that honor for All-
America recognition this year.
She leads the team in kills and
blocks this season, and is third in
Jigs
Senior Teresa Smith and junior
Laura Olesen have also carried a
big part of the offensive load and
should have a lot of sets come
their way this weekend. De
fensively, junior outside hitter
Amy Hayes and senior setter
Wendi Rush are second and
third, respectively, in the confer
ence in digs.
The Cardinal will look to
avenge a five-game loss at Mc Ar
thur Court last year, a loss which
