# Unbeaten Cal hosts Stanford
## 
### Robert Pardington Staff writer 
NBC News will be in Berkeley
tonight as the Stanford women's soccer
team takes on California at 7 p.m.
Stanford senior forward Jen Hill is
the reason for the media coverage. Hill
is involved in a lawsuit against the
NCAA over the administration of drug
tests on college athletes. Hill's argu
ment is based on her belief that the
drug tests violate the Constitution. The
Today Show is doing a feature on Hill.
"I'm confident that my lawyers have
done a good job," Hill said. "But the
outcome is still uncertain." 1 he case
will be decided Tuesday.
The undefeated Bears have a strong
foundation in soccer. Led by Coach
Jean-Paul Vorhees, California has ex
traordinary talent. In fact, the Bears
outmatch Stanford at almost every po
sition.
"We will have to work very hard to
minimize their advantages," Stanford
Coach Berhane Andeberhan said. "It
can't be a bunch of individual duels."
Last year, the Cardinal fell to Cali
fornia 4-1, making the all-time series 2-
0 in Cal's favor. The Bears are 7-0-1

this season, having most recently
defeated St. Mary's Wednesday.
Stanford, 1-5-2, has been plagued by
illnesses lately. Nine players came
down with a virus this week, making
practicing difficult. The sicknesses
have been linked to food poisoning ol
some kind.
The heat has also been a problem.
Temperatures in the 90s have shor
tened practices and led to fatigue. In an
effort to give the players some rest,
Andeberhan canceled Wednesday's
practice. Yesterday, Andeberhan
noticed an improvement in the players'
health.
At Berkeley, the players will have
some adjusting to do. The contest will
be played under the lights and on
astroturf. The field is also a little
smaller than regulation size. Stanford
will try to take advantage of the dimen
sions by slowing down the game and
frustrating the Bears with tough
defense.
The astroturf is "a poor surface,"
Andeberhan said. "Balls bounce and
roll farther. We'll have a longer warm
up than usual, just to get used to the
field."
Sophomore Vija Brookshire will

probably start in goal for the Cardinal.
Junior Elise Edwards is healthy again
and is scheduled for some time in the
goal. Andeberhan will rotate players at
all other positions as well.
The players are realistic, but hopeful
for an upset. "We have to cut down on
their running game,'" junior co-Captain
Kristy McDevitt said. "The turf makes
the game fast. We have to keep the ball
away from their better people.
The Cardinal effort will rely on a
"strong supporting team game,"
McDevitt said.
"We want to make them play a mid
field game," freshman halfback Denise
Denney added.
"The team has played well, but it
just hasn't been coming through,"
freshman defender Anne Pusch said.
"We must play tough defensively."
Stanford's general philosophy is "to
play low-pressure detense with a
strong back line,' Stanlord Asst.
Coach Dori Kovanen said. "Our attack
should be team-oriented, with good
passing." .
That strategy should carry into the
Cal game, with a little extra emphasis
on defensive pressure.
