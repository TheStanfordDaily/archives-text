### 
MINNEAPOLIS (AP)â€”Tim
Laudner and Dan Gladden drove
in two runs each, and the Twins
dealt Jack Morris his first major
league loss in the state ol Minne
sota, beating the Detroit Tigers 6-
3 in the second game of the
American League playoffs last
night.
The Twins, who were 0-6 in
playoff games before Wednesday
night's 8-5 victory, took a 2-0
lead in games in the best-of

seven series, which moves to
Detroit for Game 3 tomorrow.
Detroit will send Walt Terrell,
17-10, against Twins rookie Les
Straker, 8-10.
Morris, a Minnesota native
and 11-0 in his career against the
Twins in the Twin Cities, allowed
a two-run double to Laudner in a
three-run second inning and a
two-run single to Gladden in the
fourth. The runs all were scored
with two out.

Morris, 18-10, also gave up a
fifth-inning homer to Kent
Hrbek, who led the Twins with
34 during the season.
Bert Blyleven. who pitched for
the Twins the last time they were
in the playoffs in 1970, worked 7
1-3 innings and limited Detroit to
Chet Lemon's second-inning
homer, a two-run shot, and an
eighth-inning solo homer by Lou
Whitaker. Juan Berenguer got
the final five outs, four on

strikeouts, for the save.
This game very easily could
have become a home-run hitting
contest. Blyleven, 15-12 on the
season, led the majors allowing
46 homers, and Morris gave up
39. The Tigers led the majors
with 225 homers; the Twins had
196.
Morris had a 1-0 playoff and 2-
0 World Series record, all
compiled in 19K4 when the I igers
won the Series.
