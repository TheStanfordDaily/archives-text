# Card field hockey faces off with Bears
## 
### Mark Anderegg 
There is still something to
he said for the home field ad
vantage. Especially when one
is talking about playing field
hockey at Stanford University
on grass.
Stanford's field hockey
team is hoping the home field
edge, coupled with its recent
surge of confidence, will
propel it past the 16th-ranked
California Golden Bears to
morrow.
Cal plays and practices on
artificial turf, as do most of
Stanford's opponents. The
fact that tomorrow's game will
be played on the unpredictable
surface of grass should help
the Cardinal. But more than
just the home field advantage
should be going Stanford's
way when the two teams take
the field tomorrow morning at
11 a.m.
' The team is looking more
consistent," Stanford Coach
Sheryl Johnson said. "They
seem to be a little more confi
dent."
Stanford will need to be es
pecially consistent against the
Bears, however, as Cal will
certainly be hungry to become
the first Northern Pacific Con
ference foe to knock off the
Cardinal this season. San Jose
State tried last weekend but
came up short by the score of
2-1.
The Bears are coming off a
tough East Coast road trips
where they went a disappoint
ing I-1-1 against some very
tough competition. Intermixed
with a win over Springfield
was a tie with the University
of Massachusetts and a loss to
highly-touted Connecticut.
The Bears, however, remain

quite a formidable opponent.
"They have a very experi
enced sweeper ... a real good
passer," Johnson said. "Their
center forward is consistently
a part of the U.S. system.
They're a tough squad."
Stanford presently seems at
least as tough, however, with
the confidence and consis
tency Johnson spoke of being
reflected more and more in
Stanford's play. The improve
ment in the play of the fresh
men is just one indication of
how strongly the Cardinal is
coming on. Freshman Patricia
McJennet scored last week's
winning goal.
Although most Stanford
teams have a real sense of
heated rivalry with Cal, the
field hockey squad has a
friendly sense of mutual
respect for their cross-bay ad
versaries. "They enjoy play
ing the game," Johnson said.
"The skill level of the two
teams is very equal."
That should not be inter
preted as a hint that the Cardi
nal will take the game lightly,
however, as the importance of
this game is very clear. A win
for Stanford would give the
team a one-and-a-half game
lead over the Bears heading
into the second half of the
Northern Pacific season. A
loss would drop Stanford one
half game behind Cal.
According to Johnson, the
real concern over the past two
weeks has been Stanford's in
ability to score. The Cardinal
has managed only three goals
in its last four games. Thus,
the team has been working
hard on offensive drills this
week in practice. "We should
score some goals," Johnson
