# AT&T tourney lures top clubs
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Coming off two upset vic
tories, the Cardinal men's soccer
team hosts the AT&T/Pacific
West Soccer Classic this week
end. The annual tournament con
sists of Pacific 10 Conference
members Stanford, UCLA, Cali
fornia and Washington.
"This will be a top quality
tournament," Stanford Coach
Sam Koch said. "Washington is
loaded with scoring talent.
UCLA is in pursuit of an NCAA
playoff berth, and Cal is a team
that is coming on strong."
In tomorrow's first round,
defending NCAA-champion.
UCLA faces the Golden Bears at
noon. The Cardinal then meets
undefeated Washington at 2 p.m.
The consolation match is sched
uled for Sunday at noon, with the
championship game kicking off at
2 p.m. All matches will be held at
Maloney Field.
"This weekend we're going to
play two tough teams," Koch

said. "It's going to be a lot of
fun."
The No. 18 Bruins are the fa
vorite, but any of the four squads
has a realistic chance of taking
the title.
Although Stanford has never
won the four-year-old tourna
ment, the streaking squad
realistically feels it can come out
on top this weekend. With vic
tories over No. 2 San Francisco
and No. 4 Fresno State within
the last week, the Cardinal is
ready to take on the Pac-10
schools.
"If we continue to play consis
tently well, I think we have a real
good chance to take the tourna
ment," Koch said.
In order to win the Classic
Stanford must defeat a potent
Washington team in the first
round. In nine games the Huskies
have outscored their opponents
51-5, including four shutouts.
The Stanford defense will have to
contain high-scoring forward
Craig Beeson and midfielder
Daryl Green.
