# Oski, a revolutionary, bears true color
## 
### 
After a poor showing by last
week's Guest Greek, Steve Rac
zynski of the Stanford Sports In
formation Department, former
California mascot Oski the Bear
takes over in an effort to improve
on his predecessor's record.
Oski, you may remember,
waltzed away from the stifling at
mosphere in his glass cage at
Berkeley last year. After a year
of partying with his beloved,
newfound Stanford friends, the
bear wandered into the friendly
confines of the Daily sports of
fice, where he was accepted
warmly and courteously by the
Daily sports staffers.
Oski proved to be the life of
the evening as he gave the most
profound, interesting, and telling
picks of the Greek artists, though
he may not come out on top after
the tallying because of his
unlikely, yet intriguing pick of an
8-8 tie between Illinois and
Purdue. His choice on this game,
along with that of sports editor
Robert Portnoy, makes a pene
trating statement about the
quality of Big Ten football.
Oski, not surprisingly, would
rather watch Stanford defeat Cal
than have to sit through a 48-
minute debacle between any Big
Ten run-up-the-middle teams (or
is there a difference at all, he
wonders?).
In a prodigious burst of insight,
Oski provided penetrating and
enlightening observations on all
the games.

Stanford proved to be the
easiest pick of the day. "Hey,
these dudes can party," Oski
said, drool cascading down his
matted muzzle, making him a
wholly inappropriate pick to
replace the rumored-to-be-dead
Spuds McKenzie party animal as
the standard-bearer for Bud
Light.
"At least 1 don't seem more
alive here than the humans
around me," Oski commented on
his new home.
Oski voted gainst Cal in about
the time it took him to strip the
beard off the cherubic features of
former Greek, Ken "Grizzly
Adams" Stevens. "Those guys
are all drones," he said. "I
couldn't bare to stay there any
more."
Oski did, however, admit that
his glass case in the Berkeley stu
dent union was one of the more
exciting places to be on the Cal
campus on a Saturday night.
Although he said he normally
is accustomed to eating and not
betting on ducks, Oski went with
Oregon to upset the Trojans of
use.
Oski admitted that he was
"bearish" on any school facing
an animal team. He thereby
proceeded to select all his favor
ite mascots.
Huskies, Wolverines, Tigers
and the Buffaloes will all go on to
victory. One exception is Oski's
pick of Notre Dame to topple the
Panthers of Pitt. "Go with the

heavy drinkers," the great flea
infested sack of rotting intestines
said, belching out a wind of stale
generic beer which caused the
paint to peel off the newly
painted walls of The Daily.
Although he claimed that he
had never heard of the Ivy
League, Oski had little trouble
going with the Bears of Brown.
"Brown is a nice color," he said.
When asked to pick between
the lllini and the Boilermakers,
Oski responded with a yawn.
"What the hell is an lllini,
anyway. And as for a boiler
maker, only old ladies who play
pinnocle drink them."

There have been rumors that
Oski may show up at Big Game
in Cardinal red, but the reports
are not yet confirmed. One
would have to wonder about the
effects of such an act on the fans
and players of Berkeley, who are
hopelessly hoping for a second
consecutive Big Game upset.
Should such a travesty occur,
Oski has confirmed that his alle
giance to the Cardinal will be un
dying.
Oski promised to eat whoever
out-prognosticates him this
weekend. "It beats dinner at
Stern," he said, dancing out the
door.

Sports editor Matt Bodman
and Card Today editor Chris
Crader were tops among the reg
ular Greeks in last week's picks,
despite picking Washington to
beat Oregon. Veteran Greeks
Chris Fialko and Susan Slusser,
the only prognosticators to cor
rectly pick that upset, both
finished at 6-4 along with sports
editor Rob Portnoy. Suprise
Greek of the week was Card
Today editor Evan Tuchinsky,
who batted a mighty .700 and
holds third place alone.
Raczynski, who picked the
Cardinal to beat UCLA and
Princeton (where Raz worked

before coming to Stanford) to
beat Brown, said, "I let my heart
go over my head," but explained
that he failed "on purpose" so
that "no one will ask me those in
cessant questions about who will
win the game anymore."
Tuchinsky's knowledge cannot
be doubted when it comes to
things such as softball and vol
leyball, but he is quick to back
down when questioned if he
should be considered the heir ap
parent to Jimmy " The Greek"
Snyder.
"I just don't believe it. How
did 1 do it?" he asked, flabber
gasted.

After a poor showing by last
week's Guest Greek, Steve Rac
zynski of the Stanford Sports In
formation Department, former
California mascot Oski the Bear
takes over in an effort to improve
on his predecessor's record.
Oski, you may remember,
waltzed away from the stifling at
mosphere in his glass cage at
Berkeley last year. After a year
of partying with his beloved,
newfound Stanford friends, the
bear wandered into the friendly
confines of the Daily sports of
fice, where he was accepted
warmly and courteously by the
Daily sports staffers.
Oski proved to be the life of
the evening as he gave the most
profound, interesting, and telling
picks of the Greek artists, though
he may not come out on top after
the tallying because of his
unlikely, yet intriguing pick of an
8-8 tie between Illinois and
Purdue. His choice on this game,
along with that of sports editor
Robert Portnoy, makes a pene
trating statement about the
quality of Big Ten football.
Oski, not surprisingly, would
rather watch Stanford defeat Cal
than have to sit through a 48-
minute debacle between any Big
Ten run-up-the-middle teams (or
is there a difference at all, he
wonders?).
In a prodigious burst of insight,
Oski provided penetrating and
enlightening observations on all
the games.

Stanford proved to be the
easiest pick of the day. "Hey,
these dudes can party," Oski
said, drool cascading down his
matted muzzle, making him a
wholly inappropriate pick to
replace the rumored-to-be-dead
Spuds McKenzie party animal as
the standard-bearer for Bud
Light.
"At least 1 don't seem more
alive here than the humans
around me," Oski commented on
his new home.
Oski voted gainst Cal in about
the time it took him to strip the
beard off the cherubic features of
former Greek, Ken "Grizzly
Adams" Stevens. "Those guys
are all drones," he said. "I
couldn't bare to stay there any
more."
Oski did, however, admit that
his glass case in the Berkeley stu
dent union was one of the more
exciting places to be on the Cal
campus on a Saturday night.
Although he said he normally
is accustomed to eating and not
betting on ducks, Oski went with
Oregon to upset the Trojans of
use.
Oski admitted that he was
"bearish" on any school facing
an animal team. He thereby
proceeded to select all his favor
ite mascots.
Huskies, Wolverines, Tigers
and the Buffaloes will all go on to
victory. One exception is Oski's
pick of Notre Dame to topple the
Panthers of Pitt. "Go with the

heavy drinkers," the great flea
infested sack of rotting intestines
said, belching out a wind of stale
generic beer which caused the
paint to peel off the newly
painted walls of The Daily.
Although he claimed that he
had never heard of the Ivy
League, Oski had little trouble
going with the Bears of Brown.
"Brown is a nice color," he said.
When asked to pick between
the lllini and the Boilermakers,
Oski responded with a yawn.
"What the hell is an lllini,
anyway. And as for a boiler
maker, only old ladies who play
pinnocle drink them."

There have been rumors that
Oski may show up at Big Game
in Cardinal red, but the reports
are not yet confirmed. One
would have to wonder about the
effects of such an act on the fans
and players of Berkeley, who are
hopelessly hoping for a second
consecutive Big Game upset.
Should such a travesty occur,
Oski has confirmed that his alle
giance to the Cardinal will be un
dying.
Oski promised to eat whoever
out-prognosticates him this
weekend. "It beats dinner at
Stern," he said, dancing out the
door.

Sports editor Matt Bodman
and Card Today editor Chris
Crader were tops among the reg
ular Greeks in last week's picks,
despite picking Washington to
beat Oregon. Veteran Greeks
Chris Fialko and Susan Slusser,
the only prognosticators to cor
rectly pick that upset, both
finished at 6-4 along with sports
editor Rob Portnoy. Suprise
Greek of the week was Card
Today editor Evan Tuchinsky,
who batted a mighty .700 and
holds third place alone.
Raczynski, who picked the
Cardinal to beat UCLA and
Princeton (where Raz worked

before coming to Stanford) to
beat Brown, said, "I let my heart
go over my head," but explained
that he failed "on purpose" so
that "no one will ask me those in
cessant questions about who will
win the game anymore."
Tuchinsky's knowledge cannot
be doubted when it comes to
things such as softball and vol
leyball, but he is quick to back
down when questioned if he
should be considered the heir ap
parent to Jimmy " The Greek"
Snyder.
"I just don't believe it. How

gasted.

After a poor showing by last
week's Guest Greek, Steve Rac
zynski of the Stanford Sports In
formation Department, former
California mascot Oski the Bear
takes over in an effort to improve
on his predecessor's record.
Oski, you may remember,
waltzed away from the stifling at
mosphere in his glass cage at
Berkeley last year. After a year
of partying with his beloved,
newfound Stanford friends, the
bear wandered into the friendly
confines of the Daily sports of
fice, where he was accepted
warmly and courteously by the
Daily sports staffers.
Oski proved to be the life of
the evening as he gave the most
profound, interesting, and telling
picks of the Greek artists, though
he may not come out on top after
the tallying because of his
unlikely, yet intriguing pick of an
8-8 tie between Illinois and
Purdue. His choice on this game,
along with that of sports editor
Robert Portnoy, makes a pene
trating statement about the
quality of Big Ten football.
Oski, not surprisingly, would
rather watch Stanford defeat Cal
than have to sit through a 48-
minute debacle between any Big
Ten run-up-the-middle teams (or
is there a difference at all, he
wonders?).
In a prodigious burst of insight,
Oski provided penetrating and
enlightening observations on all
the games.

Stanford proved to be the
easiest pick of the day. "Hey,
these dudes can party," Oski
said, drool cascading down his
matted muzzle, making him a
wholly inappropriate pick to
replace the rumored-to-be-dead
Spuds McKenzie party animal as
the standard-bearer for Bud
Light.
"At least 1 don't seem more
alive here than the humans
around me," Oski commented on
his new home.
Oski voted gainst Cal in about
the time it took him to strip the
beard off the cherubic features of
former Greek, Ken "Grizzly
Adams" Stevens. "Those guys
are all drones," he said. "I
couldn't bare to stay there any
more."
Oski did, however, admit that
his glass case in the Berkeley stu
dent union was one of the more
exciting places to be on the Cal
campus on a Saturday night.
Although he said he normally
is accustomed to eating and not
betting on ducks, Oski went with
Oregon to upset the Trojans of
use.
Oski admitted that he was
"bearish" on any school facing
an animal team. He thereby
proceeded to select all his favor
ite mascots.
Huskies, Wolverines, Tigers
and the Buffaloes will all go on to
victory. One exception is Oski's
pick of Notre Dame to topple the
Panthers of Pitt. "Go with the

heavy drinkers," the great flea
infested sack of rotting intestines
said, belching out a wind of stale
generic beer which caused the
paint to peel off the newly
painted walls of The Daily.
Although he claimed that he
had never heard of the Ivy
League, Oski had little trouble
going with the Bears of Brown.
"Brown is a nice color," he said.
When asked to pick between
the lllini and the Boilermakers,
Oski responded with a yawn.
"What the hell is an lllini,
anyway. And as for a boiler
maker, only old ladies who play
pinnocle drink them."

There have been rumors that
Oski may show up at Big Game
in Cardinal red, but the reports
are not yet confirmed. One
would have to wonder about the
effects of such an act on the fans
and players of Berkeley, who are
hopelessly hoping for a second
consecutive Big Game upset.
Should such a travesty occur,
Oski has confirmed that his alle
giance to the Cardinal will be un
dying.
Oski promised to eat whoever
out-prognosticates him this
weekend. "It beats dinner at
Stern," he said, dancing out the
door.

Sports editor Matt Bodman
and Card Today editor Chris
Crader were tops among the reg
ular Greeks in last week's picks,
despite picking Washington to
beat Oregon. Veteran Greeks
Chris Fialko and Susan Slusser,
the only prognosticators to cor
rectly pick that upset, both
finished at 6-4 along with sports
editor Rob Portnoy. Suprise
Greek of the week was Card
Today editor Evan Tuchinsky,
who batted a mighty .700 and
holds third place alone.
Raczynski, who picked the
Cardinal to beat UCLA and
Princeton (where Raz worked

before coming to Stanford) to
beat Brown, said, "I let my heart
go over my head," but explained
that he failed "on purpose" so
that "no one will ask me those in
cessant questions about who will
win the game anymore."
Tuchinsky's knowledge cannot
be doubted when it comes to
things such as softball and vol
leyball, but he is quick to back
down when questioned if he
should be considered the heir ap
parent to Jimmy " The Greek"
Snyder.
"I just don't believe it. How
did 1 do it?" he asked, flabber
gasted.
