# Forum on use of lab animals scheduled
## 
### Burke Smith 
A forum on the use of laboratory animals at
Stanford will be held at Kresge Auditorium
Oct. 21, announced yesterday by the Stan
ford Panel on Laboratory Animal Care.
The announcement of the forum follows a
summer of heated debate over proposed con
struction of a new animal research facility on
campus. Animal rights activists have claimed
the panel does not give them an opportunity
to voice their concerns on the issue of animal
rights.
Larry Horton, associate vice president for
Public Affairs, said the forum is designed to
provide community members a "means of in
put" on the subject.
The panel is charged with assuring that all
vertebrate animals used in research or teach
ing at Stanford are treated humanely and with

proper care in accordance with federal laws
and government regulations.
Lise Giraud, a board member of the Palo
Alto Humane Society and an employee of
Green Library, said the planned forum
"follows closely on the heels of a (Santa
Clara County Board of Supervisors) request
to open up (the panel] to the animal rights
community." The board made the recom
mendation in August, Giraud said.
Giraud expressed concern that the panel
might be "stacked" with people who are not
likely to seriously challenge animal research
on campus.
"[We are! concerned over the fact that
Stanford is the only institution in the area to
have specifically excluded a member of the
humane community chosen by the humane
community," Giraud said.
According to University policy, however,
issue-oriented representatives are prohibited

from serving on any Stanford committee.
Tom Mack, a long-time member of the
board of the Peninsula Humane Society, used
to serve on the panel. But according to Rich
ard Ward, executive director of the Peninsula
Humane Society, Mack was "a man whose
views on laboratory animals did not agree
with the mainstream of the animal rights com
munity."
According to Robert Street, vice provost
and dean of Research, the panel is looking for
someone to replace Mack. Street added that
Stanford has expressed a willingness to
"receive nominations from the Palo Alto
Humane Society for the panel."
Giraud said she and other members of the
animal rights community "are hoping it is not
only a public relations gimmick," and added
that the University's stipulation that appli
cants be veterinarians was "unnecessary."
