### Lisa Hamilton 
The two biggest problems in
the modern world are eco
nomic and psychic insecurity,
according to Shambu Siva
nanda, a yogic monk who
spoke last night at the Bechtel
International Center.
Sivananda said the unequal
distribution of wealth between
developed and under
developed countries is the
cause of economic insecurity
in the world. He noted that
millions of people go without
the basic necessities of life
every day and said a solution
to this inequality should be the
first priority of every world
leader.
Sivananda explained psy
chic insecurity as people
"living in fear." Citing West
ern society as an example, he
said many people spend most
of their time and energy ac
cumulating money. Even
when their goals are accom
plished, he said, they still live
with "feelings of helplessness
and hopelessness.
"If we can solve these prob
lems, the world could be an in
teresting and exciting place,"
he said.
Sivananda stressed that ma
terial possessions cannot bring
people satisfaction. He said
more people must see beyond
the material aspects of life
before international economic
imbalances can be resolved.
"Are we here only to eat and
to sleep, to reproduce and
then die? What for?" Siva
nanda asked.
In an optimistic tone, he
said solutions to impending
economic crises do exist but

are difficult to discover as long
as people are materialistic.
Sivananda predicted that a
massive economic depression
will occur around 1990. His
solution to this allegedly im
pending crisis involves "rais
ing human consciousness to a
higher level." He said every
individual needs to acquire a
new world view.
Sivananda noted that every
10 years the United Nations
names a new decade of devel
opment, but that the gap be
tween rich and poor countries
continues to widen. Sivananda
suggested a world society,
divided into regional zones,
which would incorporate "the
vigor of capitalism with the
lack of competition in commu
nism." The new system must
take into account both the in
dividual and his spiritual life,
he said.
Sivananda said the task of
problem-solving lies with each
citizen, not with governments.
According to his world view,
international stability begins
with individual satisfaction.
"What is good for the individ
ual is good for society, and
what is good for society is
good for the individual," he
said.
Sivananda grew up in India.
At age 20, he moved to the
United States to complete his
Ph.D at the University of
Pennsylvania. In 1979, he
became a yogic monk. Since
then, he has done social work
in Africa, the Middle East and
Europe.
