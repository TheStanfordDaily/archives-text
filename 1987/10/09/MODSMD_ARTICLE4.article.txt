# School board election heats up
## Candidates address PTA 
### Alicia Kent Staff writer 
Focusing attention on the district's financial defi
cit, seven candidates for the Palo Alto School
Board, including one Stanford professor, faced off
in a debate last night at Nixon Elementary School.
The two-hour debate, sponsored by the joint
PTAs of the Palo Alto Unified School District,
drew an audience of over 100 parents and students.
Because of financial limitations and declining en
rollment, the current school board adopted a plan
in February that calls for closing Jane Leland Stan
ford Middle School in 1989 and converting Gunn
Senior High School into a middle school.
This reconfiguration plan will leave the district
with one high school, Palo Alto High School, for
10th through 12th grade, and one middle school for
seventh through ninth grade.
The candidates, who are running for three board
positions, addressed the reconfiguration plan last
night. Three of the candidates — Henry I.evin.
Diane Reklis and Terry Trumbull — said the
merger decision was unneccesary and unjustified,
while the other candidates — Ivan Koloszvari, Pam
Marsh, Debbie Mytels and Joe Simitian — said the
merger decision was justified based on the financial
evidence.
Beginning the debate, Levin, a professor at the

School of Education, arjjued that the decision to
close schools was a negative response to a situation
that needs more evaluation. "I've become increas
ingly concerned about the negative content of dis
cussion about shool closure." Levin said. "In a
richly endowed community, we have the cultural,
intellectual and economic sources to be an exem
plary district."
Levin suggested the board investigate other op
tions, such as business and firm donations and gov
ernment grants, to reduce the $2.4 million deficit.
In response. Marsh, an aide to state As
semblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) emphasized
the need to continue planning for a growing deficit
because of unreliable property tax revenues. "To
depend on unsure property tax funds is irrespon
sible," said Marsh, a mother of three.
Simitian, who voted to merge the two high
schools in February's 4-to-I decision, said the
merger was both necessary and beneficial. He said
the result would be smaller classes, a broader aca
demic curriculum, a wider variety of extra
curricular activities and more after-school sports
options.
Reklis, the only candidate aligned with the Com
mittee tor Better School Strategies, opposed the
large school theory. "We can't afford mediocre
schools in Palo Alto," she said.
The election will be held Nov. 3.
