# Western Culture
## Approval likely for panel report 
### Russell Korobkin Editorial staff 
Key faculty members close to
the debate over altering the
Western Culture program agreed
yesterday that the forthcoming
report of the Western Culture
Task Force will likely be ap
proved by the Faculty Senate
this year.
The report, scheduled to be
released yesterday, still has not
been made public due to techni
cal and administrative difficul
ties. According to Task Force
Chair Paul Seaver, it will proba
bly be released today.
Although its exact content is
still unclear, it appears the report
will mandate that each track that
wishes to fulfill the Area One dis
tribution requirement (Western
Culture) must include the study
of at least one non-European cul
ture along with one European
culture. The report will also re
quire an increase in the represen
tation of women and minorities in
the curriculum, abolish the core
list of readings and change the
name of the requirement from
"Western Culture'' to "Cul
tures, Ideas and Values."
According to Seaver, if the
report is approved by the senate,
tracks will be required to meet
the new guidelines by fall quar
ter, 1989.

Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) Chair Craig Heller
and Paul Robinson, chair of the
Western Culture Program Com
mittee (WCPC), said they sup
ported the position of the task
force and that they thought the
senate would approve its recom
mendations.
Heller's committee must ap
prove the task force report
before it can be considered by
the senate. Robinson's commit
tee has no legislative power in
the matter, but its position on the
report could be crucial to the fate
of its passage. The WCPC was
extremely critical of the first
draft of the task force report, dis
tributed in April.
Seaver agreed that chances are
"very good'' for "the essence"'
of the task force report to be ap
proved. He said "some of the
critics (of April) have been won
over" and others find the new
report less offensive than the first
draft.
In addition to key faculty
members, the task force recom
mendations are receiving support
from campus minority communi
ties.
Seaver said he thinks the
report, if adopted, will cause sub
stantive change in the Western
Culture program over the next
