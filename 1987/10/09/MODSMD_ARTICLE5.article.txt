# Western Culture
## Approval likely for panel report 
### Russell Korobkin Editorial staff 
Key faculty members close to
the debate over altering the
Western Culture program agreed
yesterday that the forthcoming
report of the Western Culture
Task Force will likely be ap
proved by the Faculty Senate
this year.
The report, scheduled to be
released yesterday, still has not
been made public due to techni
cal and administrative difficul
ties. According to Task Force
Chair Paul Seaver, it will proba
bly be released today.
Although its exact content is
still unclear, it appears the report
will mandate that each track that
wishes to fulfill the Area One dis
tribution requirement (Western
Culture) must include the study
of at least one non-European cul
ture along with one European
culture. The report will also re
quire an increase in the represen
tation of women and minorities in
the curriculum, abolish the core
list of readings and change the
name of the requirement from
"Western Culture'' to "Cul
tures, Ideas and Values."
According to Seaver, if the
report is approved by the senate,
tracks will be required to meet
the new guidelines by fall quar
ter, 1989.

Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) Chair Craig Heller
and Paul Robinson, chair of the
Western Culture Program Com
mittee (WCPC), said they sup
ported the position of the task
force and that they thought the
senate would approve its recom
mendations.
Heller's committee must ap
prove the task force report
before it can be considered by
the senate. Robinson's commit
tee has no legislative power in
the matter, but its position on the
report could be crucial to the fate
of its passage. The WCPC was
extremely critical of the first
draft of the task force report, dis
tributed in April.
Seaver agreed that chances are
"very good'' for "the essence"'
of the task force report to be ap
proved. He said "some of the
critics (of April) have been won
over" and others find the new
report less offensive than the first
draft.
In addition to key faculty
members, the task force recom
mendations are receiving support
from campus minority communi
ties.
Seaver said he thinks the
report, if adopted, will cause sub
stantive change in the Western
Culture program over the next
five years. Robinson agreed,
saying that the addition of non-
European cultures will make the
program "substantially differ
ent."
According to Heller, CUS will
solicit written opinions on the
report from members of the com
munity, meet with the task force
and the WCPC, and hold an open
meeting before voting on recom
mending the report to the senate.
"1 think (the report) looks very
good," Heller said, adding that
he hoped it would go to the sen
ate "and be passed very
quickly." He said he thinks the
other members of CUS are also
sympathetic to the report.
CUS support is likely to
translate into senate approval.
"The Faculty Senate tends to
take the recommendations of its
committees," Robinson said.
The current proposal is the
task force's fifth draft. Seaver
said that after the uproar that fol
lowed the release of the first
draft, subsequent versions were
circulated only among faculty
members and interested groups.
He called the response to the
fourth draft "positive," and
added he "didn't get the sense of
hostility" that he did from the
first draft.
According to Seaver, the
report calls for the alteration of
the Western Culture program to
include the study of at least one
non-European culture that has
contributed to the formation of
Western society. He said this did
not imply that the course should
necessarily give "equal time" to
that culture.
Much criticism was focused on
the original draft's recommenda

tion that all tracks "study at least
one culture inside and at least
one outside the European family
of cultures. Each culture shall be
treated on its own terms as well
as in terms of its interactions
with other cultures."
Robinson called this recom
mendation the "main sticking
point" of the first draft, saying it
rendered the report "im
practical" because few faculty
members could teach a course in
both European and non-
European cultures. He said he is
"pleased" with the present draft.
Seaver said the task force's po
sition on non-European cultures
has not changed since the first
draft, but that it has made its po
sition more clear.
He explained the task force
believes that historical events
should be viewed, "when appro
priate, through the eyes of I non-
European) people." He sugges
ted as an example that instead of
reading Amerigo Vespucci's let
ters about enslaving Indians, a
track could read an account of a
non-European who had been
enslaved or poorly treated by
Europeans.
Robinson said, to the best of
his understanding, the current
draft mandates the incorporation
of literary works from non-
European cultures, whereas the
original draft suggested the
teaching of an entire second cul
ture.
Seaver said he wasn't sure
whether campus minority groups
would find the new prescriptions
strong enough, but Black Student
Union Vice Chair Amanda Kemp
said her orgainization "gener
ally" supports the report. "We
think it's an improvement over
the present program," she said,
adding that any new legislation
"opens the door for students to
make more significant changes."
Kemp said her main fear was

that the reports' wording would
be too weak and allow some
tracks to get away with making
only "token changes."
Perhaps the most controversial
plank of the current report is its
recommendation to abolish the
"core list" of readings, which
was also suggested in the April
draft.
Often seen as the feature that
unifies the eight Western Culture
tracks, the core lists have formed
the basis of the Western Culture
program since the requirement
was adopted in 1980.
In Seaver's estimation, the
core list is impractical because
"it is extremely hard to get a
bunch of professional intellectu
als to agree on what |the great
works] are." He said "the core
list represents a whole series of
compromises" that no one is
truly happy with.
He also said the list has
"become a kind of symbol of in
tellectual imperialism," offen
sive to campus minority groups
that have campaigned for
changes in the Western Culture
requirement.
In an April letter responding to
the original draft, Robinson
wrote that his committee feared
"tracks could degenerate into
narrow thematic disciplinary en
terprises" in the absence of a
core reading list of some kind.
Seaver said yesterday he did not
think the abolition of the core list
would "lead to intellectual
anarchy," because there are
some literary works and some
problems that all tracks will
choose to deal with.
Seaver considers the current
legislation, if passed, as only an
intermediate step in the altera
tion of the Area One require
ment. "We don't think that
we've seen the end of this proc
ess," he said.

added he "didn't get the sense of
hostility" that he did from the
first draft.
According to Seaver, the
report calls for the alteration of
the Western Culture program to
include the study of at least one
non-European culture that has
contributed to the formation of
Western society. He said this did
not imply that the course should
necessarily give "equal time" to
that culture.
Much criticism was focused on
the original draft's recommenda

tion that all tracks "study at least
one culture inside and at least
one outside the European family
of cultures. Each culture shall be
treated on its own terms as well
as in terms of its interactions
with other cultures."
Robinson called this recom
mendation the "main sticking
point" of the first draft, saying it
rendered the report "im
practical" because few faculty
members could teach a course in
both European and non-
European cultures. He said he is
"pleased" with the present draft.
Seaver said the task force's po
sition on non-European cultures
has not changed since the first
draft, but that it has made its po
sition more clear.
He explained the task force
believes that historical events
should be viewed, "when appro
priate, through the eyes of I non-
European) people." He sugges
ted as an example that instead of
reading Amerigo Vespucci's let
ters about enslaving Indians, a
track could read an account of a
non-European who had been
enslaved or poorly treated by
Europeans.
Robinson said, to the best of
his understanding, the current
draft mandates the incorporation
of literary works from non-
European cultures, whereas the
original draft suggested the
teaching of an entire second cul
ture.
Seaver said he wasn't sure
whether campus minority groups
would find the new prescriptions
strong enough, but Black Student
Union Vice Chair Amanda Kemp
said her orgainization "gener
ally" supports the report. "We
think it's an improvement over
the present program," she said,
adding that any new legislation
"opens the door for students to
make more significant changes."
Kemp said her main fear was

that the reports' wording would
be too weak and allow some
tracks to get away with making
only "token changes."
Perhaps the most controversial
plank of the current report is its
recommendation to abolish the
"core list" of readings, which
was also suggested in the April
draft.
Often seen as the feature that
unifies the eight Western Culture
tracks, the core lists have formed
the basis of the Western Culture
program since the requirement
was adopted in 1980.
In Seaver's estimation, the
core list is impractical because
"it is extremely hard to get a
bunch of professional intellectu
als to agree on what |the great
works] are." He said "the core
list represents a whole series of
compromises" that no one is
truly happy with.
He also said the list has
"become a kind of symbol of in
tellectual imperialism," offen
sive to campus minority groups
that have campaigned for
changes in the Western Culture
requirement.
In an April letter responding to
the original draft, Robinson
wrote that his committee feared
"tracks could degenerate into
narrow thematic disciplinary en
terprises" in the absence of a
core reading list of some kind.
Seaver said yesterday he did not
think the abolition of the core list
would "lead to intellectual
anarchy," because there are
some literary works and some
problems that all tracks will
choose to deal with.
Seaver considers the current
legislation, if passed, as only an
intermediate step in the altera
tion of the Area One require
ment. "We don't think that
we've seen the end of this proc
ess," he said.
Key faculty members close to
the debate over altering the
Western Culture program agreed
yesterday that the forthcoming
report of the Western Culture
Task Force will likely be ap
proved by the Faculty Senate
this year.
The report, scheduled to be
released yesterday, still has not
been made public due to techni
cal and administrative difficul
ties. According to Task Force
Chair Paul Seaver, it will proba
bly be released today.
Although its exact content is
still unclear, it appears the report
will mandate that each track that
wishes to fulfill the Area One dis
tribution requirement (Western
Culture) must include the study
of at least one non-European cul
ture along with one European
culture. The report will also re
quire an increase in the represen
tation of women and minorities in
the curriculum, abolish the core
list of readings and change the
name of the requirement from
"Western Culture'' to "Cul
tures, Ideas and Values."
According to Seaver, if the
report is approved by the senate,
tracks will be required to meet
the new guidelines by fall quar
ter, 1989.

Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) Chair Craig Heller
and Paul Robinson, chair of the
Western Culture Program Com
mittee (WCPC), said they sup
ported the position of the task
force and that they thought the
senate would approve its recom
mendations.
Heller's committee must ap
prove the task force report
before it can be considered by
the senate. Robinson's commit
tee has no legislative power in
the matter, but its position on the
report could be crucial to the fate
of its passage. The WCPC was
extremely critical of the first
draft of the task force report, dis
tributed in April.
Seaver agreed that chances are
"very good'' for "the essence"'
of the task force report to be ap
proved. He said "some of the
critics (of April) have been won
over" and others find the new
report less offensive than the first
draft.
In addition to key faculty
members, the task force recom
mendations are receiving support
from campus minority communi
ties.
Seaver said he thinks the
report, if adopted, will cause sub
stantive change in the Western
Culture program over the next
five years. Robinson agreed,
saying that the addition of non-
European cultures will make the
program "substantially differ
ent."
According to Heller, CUS will
solicit written opinions on the
report from members of the com
munity, meet with the task force
and the WCPC, and hold an open
meeting before voting on recom
mending the report to the senate.
"1 think (the report) looks very
good," Heller said, adding that
he hoped it would go to the sen
ate "and be passed very
quickly." He said he thinks the
other members of CUS are also
sympathetic to the report.
CUS support is likely to
translate into senate approval.
"The Faculty Senate tends to
take the recommendations of its
committees," Robinson said.
The current proposal is the
task force's fifth draft. Seaver
said that after the uproar that fol
lowed the release of the first
draft, subsequent versions were
circulated only among faculty
members and interested groups.
He called the response to the
fourth draft "positive," and
added he "didn't get the sense of
