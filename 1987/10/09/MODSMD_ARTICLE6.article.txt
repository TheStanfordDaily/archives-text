# Fraternities create alcohol task force
## 
### Scott Renshaw 
The Interfraternity Council
discussed the formation of an al
cohol awareness task force, the
formation of a committee to
study minority representation in
fraternities, and the re-evaluation
of Rush procedures at a meeting
Wednesday, council president
Vinny Frost said yesterday.
Frost said the alcohol task
force, to be formed before the
IFC's next meeting Oct. 21, will
likely include Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano and Louise
Miller of the Health and Educa
tion Project at Cowell Health
Center, as well as representa
tives from each of Stanford's fra
ternities.
The task force will study ways
to educate people about alcohol
abuse and may re-evaluate
guidelines concerning the serving
of alcohol at open fraternity par
ties. Plans to hold individual fra

ternity house meetings on alco
hol abuse have been put on hold
pending the findings of the task
force.
Regarding the current debate
surrounding the Stanford Sta
dium alcohol policy, Frost said
the IFC advocates maintaining
the University's present policy of
allowing alcohol in the stadium
and encouraging better fraternity
behavior at football games. Frost
said Athletic Director Andy
Geiger had hoped to attend Wed
nesday's meeting but was unable
to do so because of a previous
commitment.
Addressing the issue of
minority representation in frater
nities, Frost said the IFC
recognized the importance of ra
cial issues and wanted to be part
of discussions on them.
The committee on minority
representation would be intended
to open communication between
the fraternities and leaders of the
Rainbow Agenda and other
campus ethnic minority groups,
according to Frost.
The committee to examine
minority representation will be
chaired by Stuart Levy, IFC vice

president and a member of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon.
The planned Rush Committee
will review information gen
erated by last year's Rush card
procedures and provide recom
mendations for future Rush
policy. Rushees last year had to
carry the cards to gain entrance
to all Rush functions.
The Rush Committee plans to
circulate questionnaires for those

who did and did not decide to
rush in an effort to generate stu
dent feedback.
A strengthening of the IFC
through increased participation
of the individual fraternities was
also discussed. Mandatory atten
dance at IFC meetings by at least
one representative of each frater
nity and greater support for IFC
decisions by fraternity presidents
were suggested, with the imposi

tion of fines and loss of Rush
privileges considered as possible
punishment.
Frost said the IFC wanted to
improve the perception of frater
nities on campus through in
creased communication with
University leaders and ongoing
public service projects. Planned
events include an IFC Halloween
Haunted House for local children
and physical education instruc
tion in East Palo Alto schools.
