Ortega lashes out in U.N. speech
UNITED NATIONS — President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua
assailed President Reagan's Central American policy yesterday
from the rostrum of the United Nations General Assembly, but
concluded with a plea for dialogue with Washington to ensure
the security of both nations.
The vehemence of Ortega's attack prompted an indignant
Ambassador Vernon Walters to lead a walk-out by the U.S. del
egation. Walters called the speech "revolutionary babble" and
a falsification of history.
"He insulted repeatedly not just the government of the
United States but the incumbent president of the United
States," Walters told reporters outside the hall. "The people of
Nicaragua may have to sit and listen to him, but I don't."
Ortega charged that the United States, by supporting half a
century of dictatorship under the Somoza family, had "bled the
Nicaraguan people dry." After the Sandinistas succeeded in
overthrowing President Anastasio Somoza in 1979, Ortega said,
he sought a "relationship of respect" with Washington but was
offered the role of a slave.
Ortega said the U.S.-backed contras, who he asserted were
responsible for the deaths of 400,000 Nicaraguans, "have al
ready met defeat" and that only 6500 remain in the field.
Reagan, he said, is "running out of time" as the end of his term
approaches.
Robertson asks for forgiveness
PHILADELPHIA — Pat Robertson, candidate for president,
moral crusader and pioneer television preacher to millions, said
yesterday that he was counting on forgiveness from supporters
following disclosure that his son was conceived out of wedlock
and that he fudged the date of his marriage to hide the fact.
On the campaign stump, Robertson acknowledged that the
sudden controversy about his rakish past — and about his mis
leading account of his wedding date — was embarrassing and
painful.
But he added at a Philadelphia press conference "This isn't
going to have a negative impact on me, because the people who
support me understand forgiveness."
Robertson is now the fourth candidate for president — the
first Republican — in this turbulent pre-election year to be
shown in public as different and less virtuous than they pre
sented themselves to be on the campaign trail. Two of them,
Gary Hart and Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., dropped out be
cause of the revelations.
The Wall Street Journal ignited the controversy this week
with an account of Robertson's life before his religious conver
sion — falling in love with his wife, Adelia, known as "Dede,"
getting married Aug. 27, 1954, and having their first of four
children, a son, 10 weeks later.
That triggered a story printed yesterday in the Washington
Post. The Post said it previously was told by Robertson that he
was married March 22, 1954, five months earlier than he really
was. In an interview with The Post, Robertson acknowledged
giving a misleading account and moving his wedding date back
to March 22, which actually was the date the couple's son was
conceived.
Senate compromises on arms sale
WASHINGTON — President Reagan reached a compromise
yesterday with key Senate opponents of a proposed arms sale to
Saudi Arabia, apparently assuring congressional Support for-a
$1 billion package that will exclude the most controversial
weapon — 1600 Maverick anti-tank missiles — but include 12
additional F-15 jet fighters.
At the same time, the White House agreed to drop plans to
provide sophisticated Stinger surface-to-air missiles to the Per
sian Gulf sheikhdom of Bahrain.
Four key senators who had opposed the administration's ini
tial $1.4 billion proposal announced the compromise agreement,
indicating they would support it. One, Sen. Howard Metzen
baum (D-Ohio), predicted the accord would avoid another con
frontation between Congress and the White House over U.S.
arms sales to the Saudi kingdom.
The agreement came after two weeks of negotiations between
Senate opponents and Reagan's national security adviser, Frank
Carlucci.
It comes as the administration seeks added Saudi support for
U.S. military forces operating in the Persian Gulf protecting
Kuwaiti oil tankers and facing a threat from Iran.
Angry Falwell steps down at PTL
Rebuffed in their financial reorganization proposal for PTL,
the Rev. Jerry Falwell and his board of directors resigned yes
terday from the beleaguered evangelistic empire with a parting
shot at the ministry's disgraced founder, Jim Bakker.
Calling Bakker's leadership of PTL "the greatest scab and
cancer on the face of Christianity in 2000 years," Falwell never
theless predicted that Bakker would eventually return to the
television network and resort at Fort Mill, S.C.
"If the people (at PTL) need us and want us, we'll be back as
fast as we can get there," Bakker said in a telephone interview
with the Los Angeles Times from his home in Gatlinburg, Tenn.
"We will go back to help get PTL back together again."
Last March, Falwell was asked to assume control of PTL by
Bakker, who announced that he had sex with a church secre
tary, Jessica Hahn, in 1980 and arranged to pay her money to
keep the encounter quiet. Amid later disclosures of lavish
salaries and bonuses given to the television evangelist and his
wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, the Assemblies of God removed
Bakker's ministerial credentials in May for misconduct, includ
ing "alleged bisexual activities."
Las Vegas porn king indicted
WASHINGTON — A man described by authorities as the
largest distributor of pornography in the world has been charged
by a federal grand jury in Las Vegas, Nev., with racketeering
and illegally shipping X-rated videotapes, the Department of
Justice announced yesterday.
Department of Justice officials said the indictment of Reuben
Sturman, 62, who keeps residences in Los Angeles and
Cleveland, is the biggest development in a stepped-up, year
long federal campaign to crack down on the trafficking of
obscene materials.
Sturman, who controls more than 200 corporations world
wide, was indicted Wednesday along with four associates who
operate the "Talk of the Town" bookstore in Las Vegas.
It is at least the third time federal officials have attempted to
prosecute Sturman. He was acquitted in federal court in 1978 on
similar charges that he had engaged in interstate transportation
of obscene materials. He has been free on bail on a 1985 federal
indictment charging that he evaded $3 million in income taxes.
In that case, investigators said they had uncovered a far-flung
pornography business that allegedly laundered hundreds of
thousands of dollars through foreign banks.

Ortega lashes out in U.N. speech
UNITED NATIONS — President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua
assailed President Reagan's Central American policy yesterday
from the rostrum of the United Nations General Assembly, but
concluded with a plea for dialogue with Washington to ensure
the security of both nations.
The vehemence of Ortega's attack prompted an indignant
Ambassador Vernon Walters to lead a walk-out by the U.S. del
egation. Walters called the speech "revolutionary babble" and
a falsification of history.
"He insulted repeatedly not just the government of the
United States but the incumbent president of the United
States," Walters told reporters outside the hall. "The people of
Nicaragua may have to sit and listen to him, but I don't."
Ortega charged that the United States, by supporting half a
century of dictatorship under the Somoza family, had "bled the
Nicaraguan people dry." After the Sandinistas succeeded in
overthrowing President Anastasio Somoza in 1979, Ortega said,
he sought a "relationship of respect" with Washington but was
offered the role of a slave.
Ortega said the U.S.-backed contras, who he asserted were
responsible for the deaths of 400,000 Nicaraguans, "have al
ready met defeat" and that only 6500 remain in the field.
Reagan, he said, is "running out of time" as the end of his term
approaches.
Robertson asks for forgiveness
PHILADELPHIA — Pat Robertson, candidate for president,
moral crusader and pioneer television preacher to millions, said
yesterday that he was counting on forgiveness from supporters
following disclosure that his son was conceived out of wedlock
and that he fudged the date of his marriage to hide the fact.
On the campaign stump, Robertson acknowledged that the
sudden controversy about his rakish past — and about his mis
leading account of his wedding date — was embarrassing and
painful.
But he added at a Philadelphia press conference "This isn't
going to have a negative impact on me, because the people who
support me understand forgiveness."
Robertson is now the fourth candidate for president — the
first Republican — in this turbulent pre-election year to be
shown in public as different and less virtuous than they pre
sented themselves to be on the campaign trail. Two of them,
Gary Hart and Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., dropped out be
cause of the revelations.
The Wall Street Journal ignited the controversy this week
with an account of Robertson's life before his religious conver
sion — falling in love with his wife, Adelia, known as "Dede,"
getting married Aug. 27, 1954, and having their first of four
children, a son, 10 weeks later.
That triggered a story printed yesterday in the Washington
Post. The Post said it previously was told by Robertson that he
was married March 22, 1954, five months earlier than he really
was. In an interview with The Post, Robertson acknowledged
giving a misleading account and moving his wedding date back
to March 22, which actually was the date the couple's son was
conceived.
Senate compromises on arms sale
WASHINGTON — President Reagan reached a compromise
yesterday with key Senate opponents of a proposed arms sale to
Saudi Arabia, apparently assuring congressional Support for-a
$1 billion package that will exclude the most controversial
weapon — 1600 Maverick anti-tank missiles — but include 12
additional F-15 jet fighters.
At the same time, the White House agreed to drop plans to
provide sophisticated Stinger surface-to-air missiles to the Per
sian Gulf sheikhdom of Bahrain.
Four key senators who had opposed the administration's ini
tial $1.4 billion proposal announced the compromise agreement,
indicating they would support it. One, Sen. Howard Metzen
baum (D-Ohio), predicted the accord would avoid another con
frontation between Congress and the White House over U.S.
arms sales to the Saudi kingdom.
The agreement came after two weeks of negotiations between
Senate opponents and Reagan's national security adviser, Frank
Carlucci.
It comes as the administration seeks added Saudi support for
U.S. military forces operating in the Persian Gulf protecting
Kuwaiti oil tankers and facing a threat from Iran.
Angry Falwell steps down at PTL
Rebuffed in their financial reorganization proposal for PTL,
the Rev. Jerry Falwell and his board of directors resigned yes
terday from the beleaguered evangelistic empire with a parting
shot at the ministry's disgraced founder, Jim Bakker.
Calling Bakker's leadership of PTL "the greatest scab and
cancer on the face of Christianity in 2000 years," Falwell never
theless predicted that Bakker would eventually return to the
television network and resort at Fort Mill, S.C.
"If the people (at PTL) need us and want us, we'll be back as
fast as we can get there," Bakker said in a telephone interview
with the Los Angeles Times from his home in Gatlinburg, Tenn.
"We will go back to help get PTL back together again."
Last March, Falwell was asked to assume control of PTL by
Bakker, who announced that he had sex with a church secre
tary, Jessica Hahn, in 1980 and arranged to pay her money to
keep the encounter quiet. Amid later disclosures of lavish
salaries and bonuses given to the television evangelist and his
wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, the Assemblies of God removed
Bakker's ministerial credentials in May for misconduct, includ
ing "alleged bisexual activities."
Las Vegas porn king indicted
WASHINGTON — A man described by authorities as the
largest distributor of pornography in the world has been charged
by a federal grand jury in Las Vegas, Nev., with racketeering
and illegally shipping X-rated videotapes, the Department of
Justice announced yesterday.
Department of Justice officials said the indictment of Reuben
Sturman, 62, who keeps residences in Los Angeles and
Cleveland, is the biggest development in a stepped-up, year
long federal campaign to crack down on the trafficking of
obscene materials.
Sturman, who controls more than 200 corporations world
wide, was indicted Wednesday along with four associates who
operate the "Talk of the Town" bookstore in Las Vegas.
It is at least the third time federal officials have attempted to
prosecute Sturman. He was acquitted in federal court in 1978 on
similar charges that he had engaged in interstate transportation
of obscene materials. He has been free on bail on a 1985 federal
indictment charging that he evaded $3 million in income taxes.
In that case, investigators said they had uncovered a far-flung
pornography business that allegedly laundered hundreds of
thousands of dollars through foreign banks.
