# U.S. fires on Iranian ships

WASHINGTON — U.S. military helicop
ters sank three Iranian patrol boats in the
northern Persian Gulf after the Iranian boats
fired on an unarmed U.S. Navy observation
helicopter, the Pentagon reported yesterday.
There were no U.S. casualties or damage
to U.S. helicopters, the Pentagon said. A
U.S. patrol boat picked up six Iranian sur
vivors of the attack, three of whom were re
ported in serious condition. No estimate of
the number of Iranians killed in the attack
was immediately available.
The attack occurred at 9:50 p.m. local time
(2:50 p.m. EDT) and apparently lasted only a
few minutes, Pentagon officials said. It took
place in international waters about 15 miles
southwest of Iran's Farsi Island.
The incident was the second time in three
weeks that U.S. forces have fired on Iranian
boats in the gulf, and it was the first time that
Iranian forces have fired on Americans. On
Sept. 21, American helicopter gunships dis
abled an Iranian amphibious ship, the Iran
Ajr, after it was observed laying mines off the
island of Bahrain, near an anchorage for U.S.
warships.
Five Iranians were killed and 26 were
captured in the Iran Ajr incident. The
Iranians were later returned to Iran and the

ship was sunk.
In yesterday's action, three or four Iranian
speedboats apparently opened fire on a U.S.
Navy observation helicopter that was on
"routine patrol" in the vicinity of Farsi Is
land, Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman
said in a briefing.
The Navy crew radioed for help from es
cort helicopter gunships, probably U.S.
Army Special Sorces MH-1 attack helicop
ters, which were nearby and responded in
minutes, Hoffman said. The helicopter gun
ships fired on the Iranian boats with machine
guns and rockets, Hoffman said.
While the Pentagon did not say where the
Iranian boats were based, it was believed that
they operated out of Farsi Island, a naval
base operated by Iranian Revolutionary
Guards in the gulf about halfway between
Saudi Arabia and the Iranian mainland.
U.S. officials believe that it was from Farsi
Island that the Iranians set the mine that blew
a hole in the Kuwaiti supertanker Bridgeton
in July, an incident that many regard as the
first volley in the increasingly violent con
frontation between Iran and the United
States.
Last Saturday, the Iranians sent a small
flotilla of gunboats toward the Saudi Arabian

oil loading facility of Has al Khatji, 30 miles
off the Saudi coast.
The gunboats turned back after U.S. war
ships moved to intercept them and the Saudi
Air Force scrambled jet fighters. However,
the Iranians have maintained a substantial
number of small boats in the area since last
weekend, Pentagon officials said.
Before yesterday's clash was dislcosed,
Tehran Radio quoted a commander of
Revolutionary Guards naval forces as saying
that Iran was planning an operation in the gulf
against U.S. forces.
"The Americans and the reactionaries of
the region are now frightened by even routine
movements of Iran," the radio quoted the
unnamed commander as having said. "But
they should know that our operation will not
be such that they would know about it in ad
vance. We will carry out our operation with
the element of surprise fully in place," the
radio said.
In response to the action in the gulf, the
Senate scheduled a vote today on a proposal
to invoke the provision of the 1973 War
Powers Resolution, which requires American
troops to be withdrawn from hostilities within
90 days unless Congress votes otherwise.
