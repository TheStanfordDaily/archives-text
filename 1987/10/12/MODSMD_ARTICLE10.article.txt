Senators eager to move past Bork
WASHINGTON — Senate leaders from both parties
professed eagerness yesterday to speed final action on the nomi
nation of Judge Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court, but Dem
ocrats warned that they will scrutinize any other nominee Presi
dent Reagan submits if Bork is rejected as expected.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and assistant
majority leader Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) agreed during a joint
appearance on ABC's televised "This Week With David
Brinkley" that the sooner the curtain goes up on the final act of
the Bork nomination, the better. Fifty-three of the Senate's 100
members are on record against confirmation.
Dole suggested that it might even be possible to take up the
apparently foredoomed nomination tomorrow and bring it to a
vote "late this week." Cranston, asked if Democrats planned
delays so that action on another appointment would be deferred
into 1988, said he was ready for a vote "at any time."
The Judiciary Committee's chairman, Sen. Joseph Biden Jr.
(D-Del.) said that prospects for the next nominee would depend
on how the Bork debate is handled by the Republicans. If ad
ministration forces "beat a dead horse" so that debate is drawn
out until after Thanksgiving, Biden said, "I think there's no pos
sibility of confirmation of a new nominee until well into the next
year."
Kim Dae Jung confronts military
SONGNAM, South Korea— Kim Dae Jung declared yester
day that he wants to run for president to deny "politically
motivated military leaders" a veto power over whom the South
Korean people can elect as their leader.
Aides called Kim's statement, made to a crowd of about
120,000 people at a rally in this bedroom suburb of Seoul, a de
facto proclamation of his candidacy, which he is expected to an
nounce formally later this week.
With Kim in the race, the opposition will be divided in the
presidential election scheduled to be held by Dec. 20. Kim
Young Sam, 59, Kim Dae Jung's chief rival in the opposition, of
ficially proclaimed his candidacy Saturday. Both Kims are
members of the principal opposition body, the Reunification
Democratic Party.
With his speech, Kim Dae Jung, 63, squarely confronted the
facts that there is widespread opposition to him among South
Korea's armed forces and that his election to the presidency
could provoke another coup d'etat in this country.
"I find it difficult to abandon running because of the logic of a
'veto group' being discussed by some people in our party —
namely, that I cannot be a candidate because the military
dislikes me," said the man who was the opposition candidate
the last time direct presidential elections were held here in 1971.
Fight causes panic at Wailing Wall
JERUSALEM — Arabs and Jews clashed atop the biblical
Temple Mount yesterday morning in a confrontation that caused
hundreds of Jewish worshippers and tourists to flee in panic
from the nearby Wailing Wall.
The trouble began when hundreds of Palestinian demonstra
tors sought to block entry to the religious area to ultraorthodox
Jewish nationalists who had come to pray at the site, which con
tains two mosques and is sacred to both Moslems and Jews.
Police escorting the Jews fired tear gas canisters and shot in the
air to disperse the rock-throwing crowd.
The tear gas wafted over the Wailing Wall, Judaism's holiest
site, which is just below the mosques. Hundreds of Jewish wor
shippers there to celebrate the autumnal festival of Succot were
forced to flee.
Meanwhile, a young Jewish man who was shot in the head
Saturday night in Jerusalem's Old City, in a separate incident,
died of his wounds. In the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip — where
four Palestinians and an Israeli internal security agent were
killed in a shootout earlier this week — rioting erupted for the
fifth straight day.
The Temple Mount, in the southwest corner of the Old City,
is reputedly the site of King Solomon's Temple and the spot
from which Moslems believe the Prophet Mohammed ascended
to Heaven.
Amnesty assails Commonwealth
VANCOUVER, British Columbia — The Commonwealth
Heads of Government, gathering for what has become a biennial
attack on South Africa's apartheid system, came under attack
yesterday for "deplorable" and widespread violations of human
rights.
Amnesty International, a private agency that monitors human
rights practices around the world, charged that two-thirds of the
Commonwealth, made up of Britain and its former colonies and
dominions, systematically engage in abuses ranging from torture
to illegal detention.
Pointing out that the Commonwealth has been on record since
1971 condemning human rights violations, Amnesty Interna
tional said in a detailed report that "we are not encouraged by
the evidence" that the organization's members are ending
"violations of those rights they claim to respect."
The Commonwealth Heads of Government meet every two
years to deal with common concerns, although increasingly the
sessions have been dominated by attacks on South Africa's
policy of racial separation and by demands that the wealthier na
tions impose economic sanctions on the Pretoria government.
However, Amnesty International, without equating apartheid
with other human rights violations, said that 33 of the 49 Com
monwealth members fail "to respect the fundamental human
rights" called for by international law.
The 14-page report detailed documented instances of torture,
detentions without trial of people arrested "because of their po
litical or religious beliefs," increased use of the death penalty
and arbitrary violence by officials.
W. German official found dead
BONN, West Germany — Uwe Barschel, the former premier
of a West German state who had resigned under fire over an
election scandal last month, was found dead yesterday in a room
of the luxury Beau Rivage Hotel in Geneva.
A hotel spokesman said that Barschel, 43, former head of the
state of Schleswig-Holstein, was discovered lifeless in a filled
bathtub. The Hamburg-based newspaper Bild Zeitung reported
that Barschel had taken his own life, but Geneva police reported
that a preliminary investigation showed no signs of suicide. Nor
were there any signs of violence.
They said an autopsy was being performed yesterday with the
results to be disclosed today.
Barschel was last seen alive about 5 p.m. Saturday in the
hotel.
Barschel, considered one of West Germany's rising
politicians in the ruling Christian Democratic Party, resigned
Sept. 25 after charges that he had participated in a "dirty tricks"
campaign to discredit his opponent in the Sept. 13 state election.
