## Convoy gets heavy U.S. guard 
### 
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The
United States deployed unprecedented sea
and air safeguards yesterday as a new convoy
of Navy-escorted tankers steamed through
the Persian Gulf. The precautions were ap
parently sparked by concerns that Iran may
launch a retaliatory strike at U.S.-flagged
shipping.
In the Iran-Iraq War, Iran sent a huge
missile slamming into a residential area of
Baghdad, killing a number of civilians, while
Iraqi warplanes attacked an Iranian oil
tanker, killing two crewmen.
Concern over the safety of U.S. shipping in
the gulf has been escalating since Sept. 21,
when U.S. helicopters attacked an Iranian
vessel, the Iran Ajr, as it reportedly was
laying mines in the gulf north of Bahrain.
Fears were heightened following last
Thursday's attack on four Iranian gunboats
by U.S. helicopters and the subsequent dis
covery that Iran had obtained deadly U.S.

Stinger anti-aircraft missiles.
Those fears were plainly evident yesterday
as a new convoy of U.S.-flagged ships
steamed through the Strait of Hormuz and
began the 550-mile journey to Kuwait.
The convoy, the 11th since the United
States agreed to reflag 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers,
consisted of four tankers: the Gas King, Gas
Princess, the Sea Isle City and the Ocean
City.
A Navy spokesman maintained throughout
yesterday that the convoy was accompanied
by only three Navy frigates and a fourth ves
sel, the amphibious landing ship Mount Ver
non, making its first appearance in the gulf.
But television film crews who have char
tered private helicopters to keep track of the
convoy found the security to be about twice
what the Pentagon admitted.
Footage clearly showed two Navy tugboats
leading the convoy dragging anti-mine equip
ment. The tugs were followed by a warship.

the four tankers and four more warships.
Two other warships guarded the convoy's
flanks — a total of nine warships.
For the first time, reporters saw Marine
Corps helicopter gunships patrolling the
perimeters of the convoy. In addition, Navy
Cobra gunships buzzed press helicopters and
ordered them to stay five miles from the con
voy. Previously, the press was kept two miles
away.
Iran has vowed retaliation for the capture
of the Iran Ajr and Thursday's attack on the
gunboats, in which one was sunk and two
others were disabled, saying the United
States has embroiled itself in another Viet
nam.
Western experts have tended to discount
the threats, suggesting that they are intended
more to influence the debate in Congress
over whether the War Powers Resolution
should be invoked.
