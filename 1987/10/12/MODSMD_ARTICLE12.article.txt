# Gays stage Washington protest

WASHINGTON — Un
daunted by gray and chilly skies,
more than 200,(KM) gays, lesbians
and their political supporters
marched on the White House
yesterday to demand increased
funding for AIDS research and
federal anti-discrimination legis
lation. Sponsors said it was the
largest such demonstration in the
nation's history.
The festive, upbeat crowd
shouted slogans, waved placards
and sang songs as they gathered
at the foot of the Washington
Monument and began a long,
winding march that ended up on
the lawn in front of the Capitol.
While the size of the march,
estimated by U.S. Park Police,
did not live up to sponsors' pre
dictions of 500,000 or more, they
still called it a ringing success.

"Today, we mark a major
turning point for gays and les
bians all over America. . . .
Today is a day for every gay per
son to look at themselves and be
proud of who they are," said
Kay Ostby, a Washington, D.C.,
attorney and one of three na
tional organizers of the march.
"What's important is that we
have built bridges to other
groups, such as blacks, women
and labor," she said, noting the
presence of presidential candi
date Jesse Jackson, Eleanor
Smeal, former president of the
National Organization of
Women, and Cesar Chavez,
president of the United Farm
Workers, all of whom spoke
briefly.
Late in the gray afternoon,
Jackson told the big crowd that

stretched for a dozen blocks
along the mall below the Capitol:
"Let's find a common ground of
humanity. We share the desire
for life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness, equal protection un
der the law. Let's not dwell on
distinctions."
There was standing applause
when Jackson declared: "We can
fight AIDS and every form of
death. Let's give life a chance."
Smeal told the throng it num
bered 500,000— more than twice
the police estimate — and called
on her listeners to "feel the polit
ical power of the moment."
The march, which sponsors
said was endorsed by religious
groups, civil rights organizations,
political associations and com
munity activists across the na

tion, came off smoothly and was
unmarred by violence or injuries,
according to Washington, D.C.,
police.
As they made their way
through the streets, many dem
onstrators embraced each other
with great emotion and held
hands. A group of AIDS patients,
some in wheelchairs and others
walking with canes, raised fists in
triumph as crowds along the
downtown route cheered.
But for others it was a day of
anger. Numerous marchers held
signs charging that the Reagan
administration has not allocated
enough funds for AIDS research.
Others mocked the president's
AIDS Commission, saying some
of its members are homophobic
and know little about the disease.
