An address by former Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions
Fred Hargadon highlighted the
evening's program in Memorial
Auditorium, titled "The Senior
Event," which followed the af
ternoon party on the intramural
fields near Maples Pavilion.
The afternoon gathering of
about 350 seniors resembled
the annual Field Day event of
freshman Orientation. "It's
kind of like our last hurrah at
the beginning of the year," said
senior Paige Mazzoni, Dis
orientation chair. "It's like a
condensed Orientation for the
seniors."

Disorientation organizers
said the event met their expec
tations of bringing the senior
class together at the start of
their most important year at
Stanford. "The whole day
really united the class. It was a
great start to our senior year,"
said Keith Yamashita, one of
the four senior class presidents.
Liz Marks, another of the
class presidents, agreed that
the celebration was a success.
"In Dean Fred's words, 'It
went great,' " she said.
Besides playing frisbee, en
joying hula dancing by, the
Hawaiian Club, listening to
music and chatting with
friends, a 60-person Twister
game and square dancing high
lighted the afternoon's activi
ties.
The evening's program in
cluded talks by Hargadon, Eng
lish Prof. Robert Polhemus,
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow, KGO-TV
reporter Laura Coverson and
Alumni Association Director

Bill Stone. In addition to per
formances by the Fleet Street
Singers and Counterpoint, the
Band ran onto the stage and
performed to cap off the day's
festivities.
In an inspirational speech,
Hargadon compared students'
lives after Stanford with his life
in New York since leaving the
University in 1984.
Alluding to Garrison Kel
ler's novel, "Lake Woebegone
Days," Hargadon called Stan
ford a place where "all the men
and women are strong and
beautiful, and everyone is
above average." But, he
reminded, the world outside
the University is no such place.
According to Stacey
Estrella, one of the class presi
dents, the appearance of Dean
Fred at Disorientation was a
special treat for the seniors.
"Dean Fred came out and
signed everyone's Disorienta
tion T-shirts and talked to the
seniors. Everyone loved having
him there," she said.
