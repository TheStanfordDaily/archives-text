## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Report lacks structure 
### 
The Western Culture task force last week pro
posed changes aimed at giving greater voice to
the contributions of women and minorities in
Western culture. Unfortunately, in trying to
make everyone happy, the task force has
produced a weak compromise that does little to
guarantee stronger emphasis on peripheral
voices and threatens to undermine the consis
tency and intellectual rigor of the Western Cul
ture requirement.
The report recommends that the study of one
non-European culture's impact on the West be
incorporated into the three-quarter sequence. It
advocates eliminating the core reading list and
sets no guidelines concerning time frame except
to say that the last six to eight centuries should
be stressed.
We agree that a Stanford education should
emphasize the contributions of women and
minorities more than it now does and that some
change in the Area One Requirement is needed.
This report, however, serves only to muddy the
waters, stripping Western Culture of its
pedagogical backbone and offering vague, un
structured suggestions in its place.
In its present form, Western Culture serves a
dual purpose: It introduces freshmen to central
ideas that have shaped the thought and institu
tions of the society in which they live, and it

unites the freshmen in a common, year-long aca
demic experience.
Without the core reading list, individual tracks
may degenerate into thematic courses covering
only a fraction of the time span or topics cur
rently studied. Antiquity may well be lost in the
rush to include modern non-Western works.
On the other hand, the report offers no con
crete guidelines for including the study of non
elites. The same professors who neglect women
and minorities in present Western Culture
courses might well skate around the vague sug
gestions contained in the task force report.
Some broadening of Western Culture is
needed, but it remains questionable whether
tinkering with the Area One requirement can
solve the entire problem. The fact that a new
"second-chance" Western Culture course is
being offered to seniors this year raises doubt
whether the present tracks can adequately cover
Western culture alone.
The core reading list should be retained to give
the tracks consistency and depth, and a pool of
non-Western core readings should be adopted
for professors to choose from in organizing
courses. In addition, the University ought to
beef up the non-Western distribution require
ment, which is too often fulfilled with "mick"
courses taken pass/no credit.
