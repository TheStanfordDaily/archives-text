## Article on Baha'is erroneous and insulting 
### 
On Thursday, The Daily committed a grave
mistake that deeply affected members of the Baha'i
Faith. In reporting on the Baha'i's 75th anniversary
celebration of Abdu'l-Baha's visit to this Univer
sity, there appeared in the paper a story riddled
with error and concluding with the libelous remark,
"The Daily regrets the profound irrelevance of this
article."

Stanford Baha'is

Admittedly, at first we were outraged by the
story's grossly insulting nature. Moreover, we
strongly condemned such a blatant example of un
ethical, irresponsible journalism. It is in the spirit
of the Baha'i Faith, however, to regard the origin of
most human evil and wrongdoing as resulting from
ignorance and immaturity. In order to rectify this
situation, therefore, we will take this opportunity
to broaden The Daily's vision, which was evidently
too narrow to fully comprehend and appreciate the
true significance of last week's event. Motivated by
genuine feelings of forgiveness and good will, the
following explanation serves to make the facts and
relevancy of Abdu'l-Baha's visit to Stanford
clearly known.
First, who was Abdu'l-Baha? Contrary to last
week's article which identified him as a prophet of
the Baha'i Faith, Abdu'l-Baha was actually the
prophet's eldest son. Baha'u'llah, meaning "the

glory of God," was the actual founder of the Baha'i
Faith. Tragically, during his own time (mid-19th
century) his native land of Persia perceived his so
cial and religious teachings as radical and threaten
ing. Consequently, most of his life was spent in
exile and imprisonment. His son, Abdu'l-Baha,
therefore, became the chief spokesperson and per
fect exemplar of Baha'u'llah's teachings. In 1912,
following his own release from 40 years in prison,
Abdu'l-Baha began an eight-month tour of America
in a noble effort to bridge the gap between East and
West through the power of his father's message. It
was during this tour that, by invitation from the
University's eminent first president, David Stan-
Jordan, Abdu'l-Baha visited Stanford and ad
dressed the faculty and student body.
Now that the facts of Abdu'l-Baha's identity are
clear, it is important to pursue the question of
relevance. Why is it significant that 75 years ago an
elderly Persian man dressed in cloak and turban
visited Stanford and addressed our institution? One
primary reason Abdu'l-Baha's visit is relevant to
Stanford people today pertains to the faith he
represented.
In essence, the teachings of the Baha'i Faith, as
outlined by Baha'u'llah, offer nothing less than a
far reaching, comprehensive plan for the realiza
tion of peace on earth. Most recently, this plan has
been delineated in a Baha'i Statement on Peace
authored by the Universal House of Justice, the su
preme governing body of the Baha'i Faith today.
Already this document has been received

positively by numerous world leaders, including
President Ronald Reagan.
Among other important concepts, the Baha'i
view identifies racism, sexism, the disparity be
tween rich and poor, unbridled nationalism and re
ligious strife as some of the greatest barriers to
peace. Moreover, it upholds as some of the greatest
prerequisites to world peace the recognition of the
oneness of humanity, the equality of the sexes, uni
versal education and improved global communica
tion through the adoption or creation of an interna
tional auxiliary language.
Clearly then, far from being irrelevant, the
Baha'i message applies directly to the most out
standing issues of this-age . The
Baha visited Stanford as a prominent leader of a
doctrine so worthy of interest and admiration
makes his visit significant to all members of the
Stanford community interested in visions of a just
and peaceful world future.
The second reason Abdu'l-Baha's visit to Stan
ford is relevant pertains to the actual content of his
remarks to our University. In keeping with the fun
damental Baha'i belief in the essential harmony be
tween science and religion, the body of his talk
contained a scientific discourse explaining the in
trinsic oneness of all phenomena, a concept only
recently supported by the latest findings of modern
physics. Based on this principle of oneness,
Abdu'l-Baha then appealed to all members of the
University to recognize the senselessness of war,
and urged each of us to use our talents wisely as "a

faithful standard-bearer of peace and bonds of
agreement between the hearts of men."
It is in this address, which ultimately calls upon
the responsibility of educators and learners to see
the intimate connection between education and
peace, that the real significance of Abdu'l-Baha's
visit becomes specifically relevant to Stanford as a
whole. Such conviction serves as a fantastic
reminder of the roots of this institution's philoso
phy. Originally, through the leadership of President
Jordan, a pacifist and active advocate of world
peace, a Stanford education was meant to involve
centering one's thoughts and ambitions around the
ideal of service to mankind and toats
uplift iind .bf.UQlTOifiQl.â€žjSuch roots, as embodiedjn
Abdu'l-Baha's address, must be remembered in
Stanford's centennial years as we meditate upon
our past and deliberate upon our course for the fu
ture.
In closing, we hope the facts and relevancy of
Abdu'l-Baha's visit to Stanford have now been
made clear. Furthermore, we want to thank The
Daily for the apology it has already extended with
regard to this incident, along with the dozens of
others who have given the Baha'i community their
support during this time. Above all, it is our
greatest hope that The Daily will use its mistake
constructively, learning the important lesson that
excellence in journalism depends primarily on ac
curacy and depth of reporting, a broad vision and,
above all, integrity.
