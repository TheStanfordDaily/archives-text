# Diabolical tales of deregulation
## 
### 
Some people will tell you they think the
worst disaster to befall this country in the
past decade is Ronald Reagan or Mary Lou
Retton. There are others who will remind us
that the 80s produced both Twisted Sister
and Welch's Squeezable Grape Jelly. I beg to
differ, although I must admit that squeezable
jelly is an unfortunate idea. -<g

I personally nominate airline deregulation
as national bogeyman and can supply rele
vant data, gleaned from experience, to hack
my claim. Anyone who has flown on a do
mestic flight recently will support me when I
say the airlines have gotten, say, a tad sloppy
about their business. It would be impossible
to recount the unabridged story of my
maltreatment at the hands of airlines, but I
think that an excerpt will dramatically illus
trate that someone, and I don't care who, had
better regulate the hell out of the airlines, and
soon.
Continental Airlines has reserved its own
space in hell, as far as I'm concerned,
through careful and consistent application of
flight cancellation. Nothing is worse than a
cancelled flight. Not Tammy Faye. Not jello
salad. Not even little girls singing
"Tomorrow'' in grade school talent shows.
The first time it happened was when my
best friend, Ryan, flew down from Portland
to visit me last year. He was supposed to
arrive on Continental at the San Jose airport.
When I arrived to pick him up, I discovered
that Flight 1233 had been cancelled, and no
one at the Continental desk could tell me
what had become of Ryan. They said he
might be on another airline's flight, or a later
one of theirs, or waiting until the next day or
currently in Des Moines. They just didn't

know. Basically, they lost him like a piece of
errant luggage.
I found him hours later after a spate of fran
tic phone calls to my parents, his parents and
the Portland airport. He came in a few hours
late, and after all the trouble the airline had
caused, they still lost his luggage.
Alas, this was not my last brush with Con
tinental. After another cancellation, two
delays and one seafood meal that left me ill
for three days, I found myself again flying on
the same wretched airline for my return to
school this fall. My fears that they would
seek to destroy what little sanity I had left
after a month home in suburbia proved to be
well grounded.
Upon arriving at the airport and getting
into the luggage-check line, my eye fell upon
the words CANCELLED, preceded immedi
ately by my flight number.
I took several deep breaths and ground my
teeth together. Empathy for Dirty Harry and
Rambo swept over me in great, blood-lusting
waves as I approached the ticket counter. I
found myself face to face with the per
sonification of Continental Airlines.
He was thin, with wispy brown hair, a pat
hetic little beard and a knit tie. His nametag
said "Merv." Need I say more?
I looked at him and smiled the kind of smile
that Jason makes under his hockey mask
while butchering a coed with his chain
saw/power drill/electric can opener. "You
have cancelled my flight," I remarked coldly.
Me, sir'.* he laughed. "Me personally?"
"Then someone in your moronic company
has. Someone who should have his pancreas
removed with a very dull ice pick." My tone
indicated that he, too, might meet an equiva
lent fate.
After 20 minutes of frenzied button
pushing, he got me on an Alaska Airlines
flight that was leaving in a few hours. I
checked my baggage, said goodbye to my
parents and headed off to Gate 61 to await my
plane.
I was still upset, of course. Who wouldn't
be? It was a plot, and I knew it. 1 wasn't ex
actly sure what 1 did to incur the wrath of
Continental. Perhaps I had made fun of one
of their commercials or forgot their birthday

once too often. Maybe it was just spite on
their part.
But at the Alaska gate, my anger was
abated somewhat. On a table they had pro
vided cheese, crackers and cans of soda for
our consumption as we waited. I noted that a
passing Alaska stewardess was not attired in
a polyester jumpsuit, nor did the name on her
nametag end with an "i". I began to think I
had been hasty in assuming that everything
even remotely connected with the airline in
dustry had been tainted by deregulation. It
was a reassuring thought.
However, after two Cokes, I found that I
needed to go to the restroom. So I strolled
down the terminal to the men's room, feeling
better about humanity than I had since
Three s Company went off the air.
1 entered and approached the urinal.
Before I could even unzip, the thing began to
flush. Startled, I jumped back. I neared an
other one. It too began to spurt water
furiously. Then I saw it: an electric-eye sys
tem had been installed so that when the
urinee came in for a landing, so to speak, he
would interrupt the beam, thus causing the
urinal to flush on its own.
I was furious. Urinals and automatic doors
are not supposed to have anything in com
mon. I prefer it that way. This was obviously
the worst abuse yet, and I am certain that the
airlines are behind it. The right of every man
to decide whether to flush or not flush should
be unalienable. How dare the airlines inter
fere in this, one of the most private and sa
cred rights we possess.
This, in my view, is the clincher of my ar
gument.
I won t even go into the flight thai followed
— the sleeping Avon Lady type on my right
and the avid duck hunter on my left — al
though I will say that anyone who asks
Hunt much.' more than five times on one
flight should be impaled on his own rifle.
I think that between the flight cancellations
and the urinals, it should be fairly obvious
that the airlines have gotten way out of hand.
They need to be re-regulated — and quickly.

to visit me last year. He was supposed to
arrive on Continental at the San Jose airport.
When I arrived to pick him up, I discovered
that Flight 1233 had been cancelled, and no
one at the Continental desk could tell me
what had become of Ryan. They said he
might be on another airline's flight, or a later
one of theirs, or waiting until the next day or
currently in Des Moines. They just didn't

know. Basically, they lost him like a piece of
errant luggage.
I found him hours later after a spate of fran
tic phone calls to my parents, his parents and
the Portland airport. He came in a few hours
late, and after all the trouble the airline had
caused, they still lost his luggage.
Alas, this was not my last brush with Con
tinental. After another cancellation, two
delays and one seafood meal that left me ill
for three days, I found myself again flying on
the same wretched airline for my return to
school this fall. My fears that they would
seek to destroy what little sanity I had left
after a month home in suburbia proved to be
well grounded.
Upon arriving at the airport and getting
into the luggage-check line, my eye fell upon
the words CANCELLED, preceded immedi
ately by my flight number.
I took several deep breaths and ground my
teeth together. Empathy for Dirty Harry and
Rambo swept over me in great, blood-lusting
waves as I approached the ticket counter. I
found myself face to face with the per
sonification of Continental Airlines.
He was thin, with wispy brown hair, a pat
hetic little beard and a knit tie. His nametag
said "Merv." Need I say more?
I looked at him and smiled the kind of smile
that Jason makes under his hockey mask
while butchering a coed with his chain
saw/power drill/electric can opener. "You
have cancelled my flight," I remarked coldly.
Me, sir'.* he laughed. "Me personally?"
"Then someone in your moronic company
has. Someone who should have his pancreas
removed with a very dull ice pick." My tone
indicated that he, too, might meet an equiva
lent fate.
After 20 minutes of frenzied button
pushing, he got me on an Alaska Airlines
flight that was leaving in a few hours. I
checked my baggage, said goodbye to my
parents and headed off to Gate 61 to await my
plane.
I was still upset, of course. Who wouldn't
be? It was a plot, and I knew it. 1 wasn't ex
actly sure what 1 did to incur the wrath of
Continental. Perhaps I had made fun of one
of their commercials or forgot their birthday

once too often. Maybe it was just spite on
their part.
But at the Alaska gate, my anger was
abated somewhat. On a table they had pro
vided cheese, crackers and cans of soda for
our consumption as we waited. I noted that a
passing Alaska stewardess was not attired in
a polyester jumpsuit, nor did the name on her
nametag end with an "i". I began to think I
had been hasty in assuming that everything
even remotely connected with the airline in
dustry had been tainted by deregulation. It
was a reassuring thought.
However, after two Cokes, I found that I
needed to go to the restroom. So I strolled
down the terminal to the men's room, feeling
better about humanity than I had since
Three s Company went off the air.
1 entered and approached the urinal.
Before I could even unzip, the thing began to
flush. Startled, I jumped back. I neared an
other one. It too began to spurt water
furiously. Then I saw it: an electric-eye sys
tem had been installed so that when the
urinee came in for a landing, so to speak, he
would interrupt the beam, thus causing the
urinal to flush on its own.
I was furious. Urinals and automatic doors
are not supposed to have anything in com
mon. I prefer it that way. This was obviously
the worst abuse yet, and I am certain that the
airlines are behind it. The right of every man
to decide whether to flush or not flush should
be unalienable. How dare the airlines inter
fere in this, one of the most private and sa
cred rights we possess.
This, in my view, is the clincher of my ar
gument.
I won t even go into the flight thai followed
— the sleeping Avon Lady type on my right
and the avid duck hunter on my left — al
though I will say that anyone who asks
Hunt much.' more than five times on one
flight should be impaled on his own rifle.
I think that between the flight cancellations
and the urinals, it should be fairly obvious
that the airlines have gotten way out of hand.
They need to be re-regulated — and quickly.

Some people will tell you they think the
worst disaster to befall this country in the
past decade is Ronald Reagan or Mary Lou
Retton. There are others who will remind us
that the 80s produced both Twisted Sister
and Welch's Squeezable Grape Jelly. I beg to
differ, although I must admit that squeezable
jelly is an unfortunate idea. -<g

I personally nominate airline deregulation
as national bogeyman and can supply rele
vant data, gleaned from experience, to hack
my claim. Anyone who has flown on a do
mestic flight recently will support me when I
say the airlines have gotten, say, a tad sloppy
about their business. It would be impossible
to recount the unabridged story of my
maltreatment at the hands of airlines, but I
think that an excerpt will dramatically illus
trate that someone, and I don't care who, had
better regulate the hell out of the airlines, and
soon.
Continental Airlines has reserved its own
space in hell, as far as I'm concerned,

flight cancellation. Nothing is worse than a
cancelled flight. Not Tammy Faye. Not jello
salad. Not even little girls singing
