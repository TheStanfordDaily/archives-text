# Area One report released
## Task force crafts compromise on Western Culture 
### Russell korobkin Editorial staff 
The recently released Western
Culture Task Force proposal,
which appear? to be headed for
passage in the Faculty Senate

News Analysis

this year, will likely result in
slight, but not revolutionary,
change in the Area One require
ment.

The proposal is, above all,
moderate. The task force has ap
proached an emotional and
polarizing issue and taken a
middle-of-the-road position that
both traditionalists and pro
gressives can support.
To fulfill the Area One require
ment, which would be renamed
"Cultures, Ideas and Values"
(CIV), courses would have to in
clude works from "at least one of
the non-European cultures that
have become components of our
diverse American society" in ad
dition to works from "at least

one of the European cluster of
cultures."
The proposal also mandates
the "study of works by women,
minorities and persons of color,"
and abolishes the core list of
readings currently required of all
Western Culture tracks.
Key faculty members on the
task force, the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies and the
Western Culture Program Com
mittee, along with track chair
men and instructors, support the
proposal and agree opposition
will probably be slight.
The proposal is acceptable to
progressives because it re
presents some movement away
from the Eurocentrism many
accuse the Western Culture pro
gram of embodying. It is accepta
ble to traditionalists who are sus
picious of change in the require
ment, because it only redefines
the notion of Western Culture,
rather than abolishing it.
The proposal contends that
"central to the liberal education
of Stanford undergraduates
should be the study of the diverse
ideas and values that have helped
shape the kind of people we are
and the kind of society in which
we live." While CIV will be a
study of Western society, the no
tion of "Western" will be under
stood as a conglomeration of
European and non-European in
fluences, rather than a single tra
dition.
What this will probably mean,
in practice, is only slight change
in the present Western Culture
tracks. Even History Prof. Paul
Seaver, chair of the task force,
suspects "changes will be in
cremental" and that the present

tracks are "Eurocentric and
likely to remain so."
While professors teaching in
established Western Culture
tracks and track chairs generally
feel that a move to incorporate
non-European influences is ac
ceptable, many think their tracks
have already moved in this direc
tion. History track Chair Jim
Sheehan said he doesn't think his
track will have a "big problem"
adjusting to the new guidelines.
English Prof. Charles Fifer, chair
of Literature and the Arts, said
his track has already made
changes consistent with the task
force recommendations.
The possibility for the most
change lies with new tracks
which can produce syllabi cen
tered on non-European or non
elite cultures before applying to
the Area One Program Commit
tee for accreditation. Seaver is
banking on these new tracks to
produce profound change.
To a large degree, they are also
what Black Student Union Chair
Bill King is banking on. While
King, who is a member of the
task force, thinks the proposal
should be interpreted to mandate
sweeping change in the existing
tracks, he hopes that the open
ness of the proposal's wording
will allow for the implementation
of new tracks that "have a
revolutionary approach."

While support for the proposal
seems strong, the abandonment
of the core list of required read
ings will likely generate some op
position. Fifer said the core list,
which includes works such as
Plato's ' Republic," Dante's
"Inferno" and Marx's "Commu
nist Manifesto," ensures that
freshmen will have a common in
tellectual experience, one which
he would not want to see lost.
Perhaps the most serious result
of the core list's demise will be
the gradual omission of the study
of antiquity from the Area One
requirement. The original West
ern Culture charter never men
tions a time span various tracks
must cover.
The task force proposal in no
way requires the study of anti
quity in the tracks and, on the
contrary, states that "the past six
to eight centuries in particular
deserve to be treated in a sub
stantial manner." Presently, an
tiquity is taught by non-experts
in a number of tracks. With no
pressure to keep the ancient
world on the syllabus, coupled
with a mandate to increase the
presence of non-European cul
tures, minorities and women in
the Area One requirement, the
ancient world may become the
biggest casualty of the emerging
CIV era.

Plato's ' Republic," Dante's
"Inferno" and Marx's "Commu
nist Manifesto," ensures that
freshmen will have a common in
tellectual experience, one which
he would not want to see lost.
Perhaps the most serious result
of the core list's demise will be
the gradual omission of the study
of antiquity from the Area One
requirement. The original West
ern Culture charter never men
tions a time span various tracks
must cover.
The task force proposal in no
way requires the study of anti
quity in the tracks and, on the
contrary, states that "the past six
to eight centuries in particular
deserve to be treated in a sub
stantial manner." Presently, an
tiquity is taught by non-experts
in a number of tracks. With no
pressure to keep the ancient
world on the syllabus, coupled
with a mandate to increase the
presence of non-European cul
tures, minorities and women in
the Area One requirement, the
ancient world may become the
biggest casualty of the emerging
CIV era.
The recently released Western
Culture Task Force proposal,
which appear? to be headed for
passage in the Faculty Senate

News Analysis

this year, will likely result in
slight, but not revolutionary,
change in the Area One require
ment.

The proposal is, above all,
moderate. The task force has ap
proached an emotional and
polarizing issue and taken a
middle-of-the-road position that
both traditionalists and pro
gressives can support.
To fulfill the Area One require
ment, which would be renamed
"Cultures, Ideas and Values"
(CIV), courses would have to in
clude works from "at least one of
the non-European cultures that
have become components of our
diverse American society" in ad
dition to works from "at least

one of the European cluster of
cultures."
The proposal also mandates
the "study of works by women,
minorities and persons of color,"
and abolishes the core list of
readings currently required of all
Western Culture tracks.
Key faculty members on the
task force, the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies and the
Western Culture Program Com
mittee, along with track chair
men and instructors, support the
proposal and agree opposition
will probably be slight.
The proposal is acceptable to
progressives because it re
presents some movement away
from the Eurocentrism many
accuse the Western Culture pro
gram of embodying. It is accepta
ble to traditionalists who are sus
picious of change in the require
ment, because it only redefines
the notion of Western Culture,
rather than abolishing it.
The proposal contends that
"central to the liberal education
of Stanford undergraduates
should be the study of the diverse
ideas and values that have helped
shape the kind of people we are
and the kind of society in which
we live." While CIV will be a
study of Western society, the no
tion of "Western" will be under
stood as a conglomeration of
European and non-European in
fluences, rather than a single tra
dition.
What this will probably mean,
in practice, is only slight change
in the present Western Culture
tracks. Even History Prof. Paul
Seaver, chair of the task force,
suspects "changes will be in
cremental" and that the present

tracks are "Eurocentric and
likely to remain so."
While professors teaching in
established Western Culture
tracks and track chairs generally
feel that a move to incorporate
non-European influences is ac
ceptable, many think their tracks
have already moved in this direc
tion. History track Chair Jim
Sheehan said he doesn't think his
track will have a "big problem"
adjusting to the new guidelines.
English Prof. Charles Fifer, chair
of Literature and the Arts, said
his track has already made
changes consistent with the task
force recommendations.
The possibility for the most
change lies with new tracks
which can produce syllabi cen
tered on non-European or non
elite cultures before applying to
the Area One Program Commit
tee for accreditation. Seaver is
banking on these new tracks to
produce profound change.
To a large degree, they are also
what Black Student Union Chair
Bill King is banking on. While
King, who is a member of the
task force, thinks the proposal
should be interpreted to mandate
sweeping change in the existing
tracks, he hopes that the open
ness of the proposal's wording
will allow for the implementation
of new tracks that "have a
revolutionary approach."

While support for the proposal
seems strong, the abandonment
of the core list of required read
ings will likely generate some op
position. Fifer said the core list,
which includes works such as
Plato's ' Republic," Dante's
"Inferno" and Marx's "Commu
nist Manifesto," ensures that
freshmen will have a common in
tellectual experience, one which
