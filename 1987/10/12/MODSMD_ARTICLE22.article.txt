Do you know who "SMUT"
is? Can you explain what hap
pens at the Band's annual
"Grovel" ceremony?
If not, "Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching
Band â€” The First 95 Years," is a
must for your reading list.
The book, which will be out in
stores in the Bay Area by next
year's homecoming game, is
being written by Stanford band
alumnus Phil Cline and profes
sional writer George Hawkins of
Palo Alto.
Hawkins conceived the idea
for the book last November when
he was working on another book
about Big Game at Stanford.
However, Hawkins said he
soon became aware of the tre

mendous amount of media atten
tion that the Stanford Band at
tracted, and he decided to change
the subject of his book.
Band leaders then directed
Hawkins to Cline, the Band his
torian who had spent the greater
part of his summer compiling five
scrapbooks on the Band. The
two have since been working to
gether.
"The history of the Band is so
interesting; that's why we're
writing about it," Hawkins said.
According to John Mannion,
assistant Band manager, the
book is needed to record the
Band's colorful history.
"It's a matter of longevity,"
Mannion said. "We're going into
our 25th year of mayhem and
scatter formations. It's about
time to start chronicling that."

Were going into
our 25th year of
mayhem and scatter
formations.'

Consisting of only 56 pages in
its first draft, the book has grown
to over 100 pages and will include
various topics, including the his
tory of the Band, the uniforms,
Bandspeak, the Dollies, mascots,
the music and even a description
of what it is actually like to be a
member of the Stanford Band.
The book will include pho
tographs in color and in black
and white, taken by Band pho

tographer Robbie Beyers. One of
the greatest tasks involved in
compiling the book will be choos
ing from among Beyers' 10,000
photographs, according to Haw
kins.
Although the history of the
Band will not be the focus of the
book, it will figure in the final
product.
Cline and Hawkins said they
plan to begin their history in
1892, when the Stanford Univer
sity Marching Band began as a
military group.
The two authors will include
high points as well as low points
in the history of the Band. In
cluded will be past Band Director
Julius Schuchat's unexpected
firing in 1963, led to the
