# Book examines the Band's history

Do you know who "SMUT"
is? Can you explain what hap
pens at the Band's annual
"Grovel" ceremony?
If not, "Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching
Band — The First 95 Years," is a
must for your reading list.
The book, which will be out in
stores in the Bay Area by next
year's homecoming game, is
being written by Stanford band
alumnus Phil Cline and profes
sional writer George Hawkins of
Palo Alto.
Hawkins conceived the idea
for the book last November when
he was working on another book
about Big Game at Stanford.
However, Hawkins said he
soon became aware of the tre

mendous amount of media atten
tion that the Stanford Band at
tracted, and he decided to change
the subject of his book.
Band leaders then directed
Hawkins to Cline, the Band his
torian who had spent the greater
part of his summer compiling five
scrapbooks on the Band. The
two have since been working to
gether.
"The history of the Band is so
interesting; that's why we're
writing about it," Hawkins said.
According to John Mannion,
assistant Band manager, the
book is needed to record the
Band's colorful history.
"It's a matter of longevity,"
Mannion said. "We're going into
our 25th year of mayhem and
scatter formations. It's about
time to start chronicling that."

Were going into
our 25th year of
mayhem and scatter
formations.'

Consisting of only 56 pages in
its first draft, the book has grown
to over 100 pages and will include
various topics, including the his
tory of the Band, the uniforms,
Bandspeak, the Dollies, mascots,
the music and even a description
of what it is actually like to be a
member of the Stanford Band.
The book will include pho
tographs in color and in black
and white, taken by Band pho

tographer Robbie Beyers. One of
the greatest tasks involved in
compiling the book will be choos
ing from among Beyers' 10,000
photographs, according to Haw
kins.
Although the history of the
Band will not be the focus of the
book, it will figure in the final
product.
Cline and Hawkins said they
plan to begin their history in
1892, when the Stanford Univer
sity Marching Band began as a
military group.
The two authors will include
high points as well as low points
in the history of the Band. In
cluded will be past Band Director
Julius Schuchat's unexpected
firing in 1963, led to the
Band's strike and eventually to
the hiring of the present director,
Arthur Barnes.
Also planned for the book is an
explanation of how the Band's
famous rendition of the Stanford
Star Spangled Banner, which
begins with the solo trumpeter,
was created.
The primary market for the
book, according to its authors,
will be Stanford students, alumni
and Band alumni.
Cline and Hawkins recently
sent questionnaires to Band
alumni asking if they would be in
terested in reserving a copy of
the book.
According to Hawkins, the
response was tremendous. Al
ready 450 past Band members
said they are interested in buying
the book. This response has

generated a great deal of excite
ment for the authors. "I have a
gut feeling that the book will be
successful," Hawkins said.
The authors maintain there is a
great deal of support within the
Stanford administration for the
book.

'The history of the
Band is so interest
ing .. . were
writing about it.'

According to Hawkins and
Cline, the Stanford Book Club is
supporting the project by offering
to match any money that the pair
raises for the book.
The authors also said they
hope the Alumni Association will
publish the book. The organiza

tion is currently considering un
dertaking this task.
Publicity for the book will in
clude advertisements in news
papers and magazines, and the
Band will probably be selling
books at football games.
Hawkins and Cline said they
hope that Rolling Stone maga
zine, which recently published an
article on the Band, will review
the book.
Some may wonder if there is
actually enough interest about
the Band to justify a book that
chronicles its life at Stanford.
Cline said, however, that last
year's controversy surrounding
the banning of the Band gen
erated so much interest that the
appearance of the book should be
timely.
The Band is always interest
ing, Hawkins added. "The image
of college life is embodied in the
Band, and [the Stanford Band is]
so different from [bands at] other
colleges," he said.

The book will include pho
tographs in color and in black
and white, taken by Band pho

tographer Robbie Beyers. One of
the greatest tasks involved in
compiling the book will be choos
ing from among Beyers' 10,000
photographs, according to Haw
kins.
Although the history of the
Band will not be the focus of the
book, it will figure in the final
product.
Cline and Hawkins said they
plan to begin their history in
1892, when the Stanford Univer
sity Marching Band began as a
military group.
The two authors will include
high points as well as low points
in the history of the Band. In
cluded will be past Band Director
Julius Schuchat's unexpected
firing in 1963, led to the
Band's strike and eventually to
the hiring of the present director,
Arthur Barnes.
Also planned for the book is an
explanation of how the Band's
famous rendition of the Stanford
Star Spangled Banner, which
begins with the solo trumpeter,
was created.
The primary market for the
book, according to its authors,
will be Stanford students, alumni
and Band alumni.
Cline and Hawkins recently
sent questionnaires to Band
alumni asking if they would be in
terested in reserving a copy of
the book.
According to Hawkins, the
response was tremendous. Al
ready 450 past Band members
said they are interested in buying
the book. This response has

generated a great deal of excite
ment for the authors. "I have a
gut feeling that the book will be
successful," Hawkins said.
The authors maintain there is a
great deal of support within the
Stanford administration for the
book.

'The history of the
Band is so interest
ing .. . were
writing about it.'

According to Hawkins and
Cline, the Stanford Book Club is
supporting the project by offering
to match any money that the pair
raises for the book.
The authors also said they
hope the Alumni Association will
publish the book. The organiza

tion is currently considering un
dertaking this task.
Publicity for the book will in
clude advertisements in news
papers and magazines, and the
Band will probably be selling
books at football games.
Hawkins and Cline said they
hope that Rolling Stone maga
zine, which recently published an
article on the Band, will review
the book.
Some may wonder if there is
actually enough interest about
the Band to justify a book that
chronicles its life at Stanford.
Cline said, however, that last
year's controversy surrounding
the banning of the Band gen
erated so much interest that the
appearance of the book should be
timely.
The Band is always interest
ing, Hawkins added. "The image
of college life is embodied in the
Band, and [the Stanford Band is]
so different from [bands at] other
colleges," he said.

Members of the 1892 Stanford Marching Band would hardly recognize
today's LSJUMB. Ninety-five years ago the Band began as a military
group.
Do you know who "SMUT"
is? Can you explain what hap
pens at the Band's annual
"Grovel" ceremony?
If not, "Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching
Band — The First 95 Years," is a
must for your reading list.
The book, which will be out in
stores in the Bay Area by next
year's homecoming game, is
being written by Stanford band
alumnus Phil Cline and profes
sional writer George Hawkins of
Palo Alto.
Hawkins conceived the idea
for the book last November when
he was working on another book
about Big Game at Stanford.
However, Hawkins said he
soon became aware of the tre

mendous amount of media atten
tion that the Stanford Band at
tracted, and he decided to change
the subject of his book.
Band leaders then directed
Hawkins to Cline, the Band his
torian who had spent the greater
part of his summer compiling five
scrapbooks on the Band. The
two have since been working to
gether.
"The history of the Band is so
interesting; that's why we're
writing about it," Hawkins said.
According to John Mannion,
assistant Band manager, the
book is needed to record the
Band's colorful history.
"It's a matter of longevity,"
Mannion said. "We're going into
our 25th year of mayhem and
scatter formations. It's about
time to start chronicling that."

Consisting of only 56 pages in
its first draft, the book has grown
to over 100 pages and will include
various topics, including the his
tory of the Band, the uniforms,
Bandspeak, the Dollies, mascots,
the music and even a description
of what it is actually like to be a
member of the Stanford Band.
