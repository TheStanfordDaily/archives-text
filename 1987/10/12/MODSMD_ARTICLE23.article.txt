# Starting over
## Transfers look for new beginning

"When you're starting all
over again, you really have to
want to do it. The pain was
hard enough the first time. I
have to go out of my way to
make it work," junior Tia
Kirby said, voicing a senti
ment expressed by many
transfer students.
The start of each year at
Stanford brings not only
droves of confused freshmen
to campus, but also a group of
older, more experienced stu
dents — the transfer students.
This year, transfers represent
a select group of highly qual
ified, very talented individ
uals, according to William
Tingley, dean of transfer ad
missions.
1987 was good as far as
transfer enrollment was con
cerned. Applications were
received from 1457 students
and 118 were offered admis
sion. These numbers translate
to an acceptance rate of
roughly eight percent, as
compared to the freshman ac
ceptance rate of 15 percent,
Tingley said. At the beginning
of fall quarter, 94 transfer stu
dents were officially enrolled
with the registrar's office.
In the past, Tingley added,
most of Stanford's transfers
came from community col
leges. During the past 10 to 15
years, however, Stanford's
policies and applicant pools
have changed so that currently
most transfers (88 percent of
the incoming group) are stu
dents from four-year colleges
and universities.
Describing the criteria used
for admitting transfers,
Tingley said, "We strive for
diversity in the transfer admis
sions process. We look for stu
dents who are energetic and
involved doers — who bring a
whole range of backgrounds
and experiences with them.
We regard them as an integral
part of the University commu
nity."
Transfer students are in

many ways different than the
student body at large. Often
they are people who at one
time decided to leave school to
work, travel, marry or start
families.
Sophomore Greg Cumber
ford, one of this year's new
transfers, brings with him a
wealth of memories from his
year-long sailing odyssey in
1986. Before coming to Stan
ford, he left Deep Springs Col
lege in California to do a slide
documentary on his main in
terest, small scale tropical
agricultures.
Work on the documentary
took him and his family to
such South Pacific locales as
the Galapogos Islands, the
Turkas Caicos Islands, Jamai
ca, the San Bias Islands in
Panama, Tahiti and Bora
Bora.
Many transfer students
choose to leave their schools
because of ideological differ
ences or a feeling that some
thing was missing in their
lives. Bob Mac Lean is one
such student. Mac Lean is a
junior transfer from the Air
Force Academy in Colorado
Springs, Colo. His strong
dislike of the restrictive, con
formist policies of the military
brought him to Stanford.
"I really didn't fit into the
rigid military mold. I wanted
to study the same kinds of
things but in a different en
vironment. The military is not
for everyone," Mac Lean said.
Comparing Stanford to the
Air Force Academy, Mac Lean
said, "It's good to be going to
a real university."
Transfer student Kirby,
who came from Bryn Mawr
College in Philadelphia, Pa.,
transfered to Stanford because
she felt that the academic life
at Bryn Mawr was rigorous
and unfulfilling. "I always
thought that college was sup
posed to be a time when you
