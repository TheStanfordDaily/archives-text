# Starting over
## Transfers look for new beginning 
### K. Kay Devgan 
"When you're starting all
over again, you really have to
want to do it. The pain was
hard enough the first time. I
have to go out of my way to
make it work," junior Tia
Kirby said, voicing a senti
ment expressed by many
transfer students.
The start of each year at
Stanford brings not only
droves of confused freshmen
to campus, but also a group of
older, more experienced stu
dents — the transfer students.
This year, transfers represent
a select group of highly qual
ified, very talented individ
uals, according to William
Tingley, dean of transfer ad
missions.
1987 was good as far as
transfer enrollment was con
cerned. Applications were
received from 1457 students
and 118 were offered admis
sion. These numbers translate
to an acceptance rate of
roughly eight percent, as
compared to the freshman ac
ceptance rate of 15 percent,
Tingley said. At the beginning
of fall quarter, 94 transfer stu
dents were officially enrolled
with the registrar's office.
In the past, Tingley added,
most of Stanford's transfers
came from community col
leges. During the past 10 to 15
years, however, Stanford's
policies and applicant pools
have changed so that currently
most transfers (88 percent of
the incoming group) are stu
dents from four-year colleges
and universities.
Describing the criteria used
for admitting transfers,
Tingley said, "We strive for
diversity in the transfer admis
sions process. We look for stu
dents who are energetic and
involved doers — who bring a
whole range of backgrounds
and experiences with them.
We regard them as an integral
part of the University commu
nity."
Transfer students are in

many ways different than the
student body at large. Often
they are people who at one
time decided to leave school to
work, travel, marry or start
families.
Sophomore Greg Cumber
ford, one of this year's new
transfers, brings with him a
wealth of memories from his
year-long sailing odyssey in
1986. Before coming to Stan
ford, he left Deep Springs Col
lege in California to do a slide
documentary on his main in
terest, small scale tropical
agricultures.
Work on the documentary
took him and his family to
such South Pacific locales as
the Galapogos Islands, the
Turkas Caicos Islands, Jamai
ca, the San Bias Islands in
Panama, Tahiti and Bora
Bora.
Many transfer students
choose to leave their schools
because of ideological differ
ences or a feeling that some
thing was missing in their
lives. Bob Mac Lean is one
such student. Mac Lean is a
junior transfer from the Air
Force Academy in Colorado
Springs, Colo. His strong
dislike of the restrictive, con
formist policies of the military
brought him to Stanford.
"I really didn't fit into the
rigid military mold. I wanted
to study the same kinds of
things but in a different en
vironment. The military is not
for everyone," Mac Lean said.
Comparing Stanford to the
Air Force Academy, Mac Lean
said, "It's good to be going to
a real university."
Transfer student Kirby,
who came from Bryn Mawr
College in Philadelphia, Pa.,
transfered to Stanford because
she felt that the academic life
at Bryn Mawr was rigorous
and unfulfilling. "I always
thought that college was sup
posed to be a time when you
learned so much and still had
time for friends," she said. "One
day I asked myself what kind of
empty memories I'd have when I
left. After all, there is something
more to college than just
studies."
"It's important to me to bal
ance my life," Kirby said. "I
don't want to be one-sided."
This quarter, she plans to take a
larger variety of classes, includ
ing synchronized swimming and
clay modeling.
Ann Podlozny, a junior trans
fer from Ithaca College in New
York, feels that transfers have to
make an extra effort to get in

volved in student activities.
An example of the energy and
focus that most transfers bring to
the campus, Podlozny has al
ready become actively involved
in Stanford's drama department.
Later this quarter she will appear
in the Drama Department's pro
duction of the radio broadcast
"The Bagman."
Podlozny's interest in theater
stems from her experiences at It
haca, where she played a lead
role in Jean Claude Von Itallie's
exploratory theater piece, "The
Serpent." She expresses a deep
interest in the role of the arts in
society and plans to stop out next
year to do a worldwide tour with
her exploratory theater group.
"I left school for a purpose —
to sort out my life and get my
priorities straight," Podlozny

said. "I was working and
working but not getting a lot out
of it. As far as future plans go, I
have no regrets about leaving
again in a year. At the rate I'm
going, I won't be getting my
degree until I'm well past child
bearing age anyway.
"But that's not important,"
she added. "What is important is
that I'm going to be doing some
thing that I enjoy and getting the
personal satisfaction that should

be the essential element of any
person s life."
Senior John Johnston, a prod
uct design major, was a mid-year
transfer student who left UC-San
Diego to come to Stanford two
years ago. He is now a well
established member of the Stan
ford community who has taken
an active role in such activities as
Ram's Head Theater, Gaieties,
the Original Winter One Acts and
the Orientation Volunteer pro
gram. In addition, Johnston is a
resident assistant at Cardenal.
But life did not always go so
smoothly for Johnston. "Trans
ferring represented a period of
my life where I had to grow, had
to evaluate everything I believed
in,"he said. "I had to deal with
questions like how to define suc
cess, how important is it to have

money over happiness. Every
thing that I had always taken for
granted had to be re-evaluated
and pointed in the direction that I
wanted it to take."
In the future, Johnston hopes
to join a creative toy firm like
Mattel Toys. If that doesn't work
out, he said, true to form for a
transfer student, "I'm willing to
make my own openings in life."
Not all transfer students are so
certain of their future paths.
Sophomore Neilie Fletcher, from
Georgetown University, and
junior Eric Wahlgren, from UC-
Berkeley, are still exploring the
options that are open to them.
Fletcher left what she termed a
very pre-professional school and
is happy to to be at a more
flexible school, where people
want to learn and not just

graduate.
"A lot of people get so cynical
and cerebral about school that
they don't want to get involved
with anything. But it's important
to be at a school that is flexible to
your needs, that helps students
find and pursue their interests,"
Fletcher said.
Similarly, Wahlgren, who en
joys international relations and
Latin American studies, believes
that individuals must always fol
low their interests and avoid
going after what is easiest to
achieve.
Said Wahlgren: "At first you
may be uncertain about your de
cision — unsure if you're going
to find what you're looking for —
but once you start to get in
volved, you begin to make a
comfortable place for yourself."

compared to the freshman ac
ceptance rate of 15 percent,
Tingley said. At the beginning
of fall quarter, 94 transfer stu
dents were officially enrolled
with the registrar's office.
In the past, Tingley added,
most of Stanford's transfers
came from community col
leges. During the past 10 to 15
years, however, Stanford's
policies and applicant pools
have changed so that currently
most transfers (88 percent of
the incoming group) are stu
dents from four-year colleges
and universities.
Describing the criteria used
for admitting transfers,
Tingley said, "We strive for
diversity in the transfer admis
sions process. We look for stu
dents who are energetic and
involved doers — who bring a
whole range of backgrounds
and experiences with them.
We regard them as an integral
part of the University commu
nity."
Transfer students are in

many ways different than the
student body at large. Often
they are people who at one
time decided to leave school to
work, travel, marry or start
families.
Sophomore Greg Cumber
ford, one of this year's new
transfers, brings with him a
wealth of memories from his
year-long sailing odyssey in
1986. Before coming to Stan
ford, he left Deep Springs Col
lege in California to do a slide
documentary on his main in
terest, small scale tropical
agricultures.
Work on the documentary
took him and his family to
such South Pacific locales as
the Galapogos Islands, the
Turkas Caicos Islands, Jamai
ca, the San Bias Islands in
Panama, Tahiti and Bora
Bora.
Many transfer students
choose to leave their schools
because of ideological differ
ences or a feeling that some
thing was missing in their
lives. Bob Mac Lean is one
such student. Mac Lean is a
junior transfer from the Air
Force Academy in Colorado
Springs, Colo. His strong
dislike of the restrictive, con
formist policies of the military
brought him to Stanford.
"I really didn't fit into the
rigid military mold. I wanted
to study the same kinds of
things but in a different en
vironment. The military is not
for everyone," Mac Lean said.
Comparing Stanford to the
Air Force Academy, Mac Lean
said, "It's good to be going to
a real university."
Transfer student Kirby,
who came from Bryn Mawr
College in Philadelphia, Pa.,
transfered to Stanford because
she felt that the academic life
at Bryn Mawr was rigorous
and unfulfilling. "I always
thought that college was sup
posed to be a time when you
learned so much and still had
time for friends," she said. "One
day I asked myself what kind of
empty memories I'd have when I
left. After all, there is something
more to college than just
studies."
"It's important to me to bal
ance my life," Kirby said. "I
don't want to be one-sided."
This quarter, she plans to take a
larger variety of classes, includ
ing synchronized swimming and
clay modeling.
Ann Podlozny, a junior trans
fer from Ithaca College in New
York, feels that transfers have to
make an extra effort to get in

volved in student activities.
An example of the energy and
focus that most transfers bring to
the campus, Podlozny has al
ready become actively involved
in Stanford's drama department.
Later this quarter she will appear
in the Drama Department's pro
duction of the radio broadcast
"The Bagman."
Podlozny's interest in theater
stems from her experiences at It
haca, where she played a lead
role in Jean Claude Von Itallie's
exploratory theater piece, "The
Serpent." She expresses a deep
interest in the role of the arts in
society and plans to stop out next
year to do a worldwide tour with
her exploratory theater group.
"I left school for a purpose —
to sort out my life and get my
priorities straight," Podlozny

said. "I was working and
working but not getting a lot out
of it. As far as future plans go, I
have no regrets about leaving
again in a year. At the rate I'm
going, I won't be getting my
degree until I'm well past child
bearing age anyway.
"But that's not important,"
she added. "What is important is
that I'm going to be doing some
thing that I enjoy and getting the
personal satisfaction that should

be the essential element of any
person s life."
Senior John Johnston, a prod
uct design major, was a mid-year
transfer student who left UC-San
Diego to come to Stanford two
years ago. He is now a well
established member of the Stan
ford community who has taken
an active role in such activities as
Ram's Head Theater, Gaieties,
the Original Winter One Acts and
the Orientation Volunteer pro
gram. In addition, Johnston is a
resident assistant at Cardenal.
But life did not always go so
smoothly for Johnston. "Trans
ferring represented a period of
my life where I had to grow, had
to evaluate everything I believed
in,"he said. "I had to deal with
questions like how to define suc
cess, how important is it to have

money over happiness. Every
thing that I had always taken for
granted had to be re-evaluated
and pointed in the direction that I
wanted it to take."
In the future, Johnston hopes
to join a creative toy firm like
Mattel Toys. If that doesn't work
out, he said, true to form for a
transfer student, "I'm willing to
make my own openings in life."
Not all transfer students are so
certain of their future paths.
Sophomore Neilie Fletcher, from
Georgetown University, and
junior Eric Wahlgren, from UC-
Berkeley, are still exploring the
options that are open to them.
Fletcher left what she termed a
very pre-professional school and
is happy to to be at a more
flexible school, where people
want to learn and not just

graduate.
"A lot of people get so cynical
and cerebral about school that
they don't want to get involved
with anything. But it's important
to be at a school that is flexible to
your needs, that helps students
find and pursue their interests,"
Fletcher said.
Similarly, Wahlgren, who en
joys international relations and
Latin American studies, believes
that individuals must always fol
low their interests and avoid
going after what is easiest to
achieve.
Said Wahlgren: "At first you
may be uncertain about your de
cision — unsure if you're going
to find what you're looking for —
but once you start to get in
volved, you begin to make a
comfortable place for yourself."

"When you're starting all
over again, you really have to
want to do it. The pain was
hard enough the first time. I
have to go out of my way to
make it work," junior Tia
Kirby said, voicing a senti
ment expressed by many
transfer students.
The start of each year at
Stanford brings not only
droves of confused freshmen
to campus, but also a group of
older, more experienced stu
dents — the transfer students.
This year, transfers represent
a select group of highly qual
ified, very talented individ
uals, according to William
Tingley, dean of transfer ad
missions.
1987 was good as far as
transfer enrollment was con
cerned. Applications were
received from 1457 students
and 118 were offered admis
sion. These numbers translate
to an acceptance rate of
roughly eight percent, as
compared to the freshman ac

many ways different than the
student body at large. Often
they are people who at one
time decided to leave school to
work, travel, marry or start
families.
Sophomore Greg Cumber
ford, one of this year's new
transfers, brings with him a
wealth of memories from his
year-long sailing odyssey in
1986. Before coming to Stan
ford, he left Deep Springs Col
lege in California to do a slide
documentary on his main in
terest, small scale tropical
agricultures.
Work on the documentary
took him and his family to
such South Pacific locales as
the Galapogos Islands, the
Turkas Caicos Islands, Jamai
ca, the San Bias Islands in
Panama, Tahiti and Bora
Bora.
Many transfer students
choose to leave their schools
because of ideological differ
ences or a feeling that some
thing was missing in their
lives. Bob Mac Lean is one
such student. Mac Lean is a
junior transfer from the Air
Force Academy in Colorado
Springs, Colo. His strong
dislike of the restrictive, con
formist policies of the military
brought him to Stanford.
"I really didn't fit into the
rigid military mold. I wanted
to study the same kinds of
things but in a different en
vironment. The military is not
for everyone," Mac Lean said.
Comparing Stanford to the
Air Force Academy, Mac Lean
said, "It's good to be going to
a real university."
Transfer student Kirby,
who came from Bryn Mawr
College in Philadelphia, Pa.,
transfered to Stanford because
she felt that the academic life
at Bryn Mawr was rigorous
and unfulfilling. "I always
thought that college was sup
posed to be a time when you
learned so much and still had
time for friends," she said. "One
day I asked myself what kind of
empty memories I'd have when I
left. After all, there is something
more to college than just
studies."
"It's important to me to bal
ance my life," Kirby said. "I
don't want to be one-sided."
This quarter, she plans to take a
larger variety of classes, includ
ing synchronized swimming and
clay modeling.
Ann Podlozny, a junior trans
fer from Ithaca College in New
York, feels that transfers have to
make an extra effort to get in

volved in student activities.
An example of the energy and
focus that most transfers bring to
the campus, Podlozny has al
ready become actively involved
in Stanford's drama department.
Later this quarter she will appear
in the Drama Department's pro
duction of the radio broadcast
"The Bagman."
Podlozny's interest in theater
stems from her experiences at It
haca, where she played a lead
role in Jean Claude Von Itallie's
exploratory theater piece, "The
Serpent." She expresses a deep
interest in the role of the arts in
society and plans to stop out next
year to do a worldwide tour with
her exploratory theater group.
"I left school for a purpose —
to sort out my life and get my
priorities straight," Podlozny

said. "I was working and
working but not getting a lot out
of it. As far as future plans go, I
have no regrets about leaving
again in a year. At the rate I'm
going, I won't be getting my
degree until I'm well past child
bearing age anyway.
"But that's not important,"
she added. "What is important is
that I'm going to be doing some
thing that I enjoy and getting the
personal satisfaction that should

be the essential element of any
person s life."
Senior John Johnston, a prod
uct design major, was a mid-year
transfer student who left UC-San
Diego to come to Stanford two
years ago. He is now a well
established member of the Stan
ford community who has taken
an active role in such activities as
Ram's Head Theater, Gaieties,
the Original Winter One Acts and
the Orientation Volunteer pro
gram. In addition, Johnston is a
resident assistant at Cardenal.
But life did not always go so
smoothly for Johnston. "Trans
ferring represented a period of
my life where I had to grow, had
to evaluate everything I believed
in,"he said. "I had to deal with
questions like how to define suc
cess, how important is it to have

money over happiness. Every
thing that I had always taken for
granted had to be re-evaluated
and pointed in the direction that I
wanted it to take."
In the future, Johnston hopes
to join a creative toy firm like
Mattel Toys. If that doesn't work
out, he said, true to form for a
transfer student, "I'm willing to
make my own openings in life."
Not all transfer students are so
certain of their future paths.
Sophomore Neilie Fletcher, from
Georgetown University, and
junior Eric Wahlgren, from UC-
Berkeley, are still exploring the
options that are open to them.
Fletcher left what she termed a
very pre-professional school and
is happy to to be at a more
flexible school, where people
want to learn and not just

graduate.
"A lot of people get so cynical
and cerebral about school that
they don't want to get involved
with anything. But it's important
to be at a school that is flexible to
your needs, that helps students
find and pursue their interests,"
Fletcher said.
Similarly, Wahlgren, who en
joys international relations and
Latin American studies, believes
that individuals must always fol
low their interests and avoid
going after what is easiest to
achieve.
Said Wahlgren: "At first you
may be uncertain about your de
cision — unsure if you're going
to find what you're looking for —
but once you start to get in
volved, you begin to make a
comfortable place for yourself."
