## Cheng's odyssey through Cultural Revolution 
### Clara Wu 
Life and Death in Shanghai
By Nien Cheng
The Grove Press, New York
$19.95
Survivors of the Chinese Cul
tural Revolution are telling their
stories. Their testimonials have
gradually increased in number as
the tragedy of those 10 years in
China writes itself into the book
of world history. Each has par
ticulars to recount, lost relatives
to remember, obliterated lives to
retrieve, but Nien Cheng's expe
riences told in "Life and Death in
Shanghai'' are unique.
Few could write a story as
Cheng has. The memories she
recalls in this book — from house
arrest and confinement to 12
years of imprisonment, torture,
sickness and poor nutrition —
are horrors that could not have
been endured by many. Her
courage and determination to
remain firm under pressure is
remarkable when one considers
the mental and physical torture
the revolution delivered to its
victims.
Educated at the prestigious
London School of Economics
and serving as general manager
for Britain's Shell Oil Corp. in

Shanghai, Cheng's background
made her a prime target of the
anti-Western feeling prevalent
during the Cultural Revolution.
The position at Shell allowed her
to live in financial comfort and
cultural sophistication. The

opening lines of the book intro
duce us to the elegance of her
lifestyle. Cheng's home is de
scribed as beautifully decorated
and softly lit, filled with rare
books, plush pillows, stacks of
classical music phonographs and

a collection of artwork that in
cludes oil paintings and fine
Chinese porcelain — all kept tidy
and presentable by a staff of
obedient servants.
This unquestionable affluency
initially makes us reluctant to
sympathize with Cheng, espe
cially when we compare it to the
extreme poverty of the Chinese
peasantry. Ultimately, however,
we are won over when we realize
that Cheng earned her prominent
position by applying the very
ideals of hard work and self
realization with which the West
and its large middle classes have
traditionally alligned themselves.
After this glimpse of Cheng's
Shanghai in its golden years of
wealth, culture and sophistica
tion, the grim results of the Cul
tural Revolution seem even more
disturbing.
Cheng invites us to sympathize
with the plight of the common
people, the innocent, defenseless
victims of the government's mad
ness. Thousands were swallowed
into mass jailings and executions,
mysterious disappearances and
unexplained accidents. Included
in this group was Cheng's
daughter Meiping, whose cause
of death was officially recorded
as suicide though she was in fact
murdered by the Red Guards.

The fate of the country was,
Cheng writes, "at the mercy of
Mao's whims." Even the Red
Guards, she claims, were nothing
hut blind followers of the move
ment. When they first stormed
her home in August, 1966, they
recklessly shattered her fine
vases against the ground. When
Cheng asked for an explanation,
she received only the recitation
of one of the epigrams from
Mao's "Little Red Book:" "If
we do not destroy, we cannot es
tablish."
Cheng also describes the ma
nipulation of the public at gov
ernment trials and community
meetings. On these occasions,
when enemies of the class system
were denounced, all attending
were forced to enthusiastically
shout revolutionary slogans.
Their faces remained expression
less, however, and when party
officials would leave the cham
ber, the people would file out be
hind them, weary and silent,
without a trace of revolutionary
spirit. They were aware that if
one did not faithfully follow
Mao's commands, torture would
inevitably follow.
Cheng notes that her own
brother was forced to make an in
dictment against her. He submit
ted to authority as did many

Chinese, finding it easier to
"bend with the wind to survive
the hurricane."
Life following imprisonment
was full of constant supervision
for Cheng, and the task of recon
structing her identity was not
easy. Everything had to be ac
complished by connections,
"through the back door." In this,
we see how much the Cultural
Revolution has shaped the
Chinese mindset of today. Per
sonal contacts are still what
make things go — when, in fact.

Cheng predicts a future
of more ideological in
doctrination

they do go. Jiang Qing, Mao's
wife and one of the Gang of Four
(the cabal convicted of plotting
the Cultural Revolution), was fa
mous for statements, such as
"We would rather have social
ism's lower production figures
than capitalism's abundance,"
and "We would rather have
socialism's trains that are behind
schedule than capitalism's trains
that are on time." These atti
tudes have their legacies in the

continuing reluctance ot the
Chinese to work hard and run
buses and trains according to
schedule.
Cheng fails throughout the
hook to he concise, and she often
writes in a rambling style. For
example, we find heavy doses of
political analysis juxtaposed with
daily descriptions of the author's
impressions of waking each
morning. These personal details,
when cumbersome, make her in
formative journalism a repetitive
diary.
Ultimately, we are left with the
impression that although the
traditions and culture of the
Chinese were sacrificed to the
Cultural Revolution, their
humanitarianism survived. The
people never lost their warm
heartedness, Cheng claims, but
they did not have the strength to
tight the oppressive system.
As time now passes, condi
tions improve in China, but the
scars of the Cultural Revolution
still run deep. Cheng predicts a
future of more ideological in
doctrination. If the Chinese
people continue to bend with the
wind, a just political system may
not blow their way. Cheng's
fighting spirit and commitment to
principle should be a lesson to
all.

Life and Death in Shanghai
By Nien Cheng
The Grove Press, New York
$19.95
Survivors of the Chinese Cul
tural Revolution are telling their
stories. Their testimonials have
gradually increased in number as
the tragedy of those 10 years in
China writes itself into the book
of world history. Each has par
ticulars to recount, lost relatives
to remember, obliterated lives to
retrieve, but Nien Cheng's expe
riences told in "Life and Death in
Shanghai'' are unique.
Few could write a story as
Cheng has. The memories she
recalls in this book — from house
arrest and confinement to 12
years of imprisonment, torture,
sickness and poor nutrition —
are horrors that could not have
been endured by many. Her
courage and determination to
remain firm under pressure is
remarkable when one considers
the mental and physical torture
the revolution delivered to its
victims.
Educated at the prestigious
London School of Economics
and serving as general manager
for Britain's Shell Oil Corp. in

Shanghai, Cheng's background
made her a prime target of the
anti-Western feeling prevalent
during the Cultural Revolution.
The position at Shell allowed her
to live in financial comfort and
cultural sophistication. The

opening lines of the book intro
duce us to the elegance of her
lifestyle. Cheng's home is de
scribed as beautifully decorated
and softly lit, filled with rare
books, plush pillows, stacks of
classical music phonographs and

a collection of artwork that in
cludes oil paintings and fine
Chinese porcelain — all kept tidy
and presentable by a staff of
obedient servants.
This unquestionable affluency
initially makes us reluctant to
sympathize with Cheng, espe
cially when we compare it to the
extreme poverty of the Chinese
peasantry. Ultimately, however,
we are won over when we realize
that Cheng earned her prominent
position by applying the very
ideals of hard work and self
realization with which the West
and its large middle classes have
traditionally alligned themselves.
After this glimpse of Cheng's
Shanghai in its golden years of
wealth, culture and sophistica
tion, the grim results of the Cul
tural Revolution seem even more
disturbing.
Cheng invites us to sympathize
with the plight of the common
people, the innocent, defenseless
victims of the government's mad
ness. Thousands were swallowed
into mass jailings and executions,
mysterious disappearances and
unexplained accidents. Included
in this group was Cheng's
daughter Meiping, whose cause
of death was officially recorded
as suicide though she was in fact
murdered by the Red Guards.

The fate of the country was,
Cheng writes, "at the mercy of
Mao's whims." Even the Red
Guards, she claims, were nothing
hut blind followers of the move
ment. When they first stormed
her home in August, 1966, they
recklessly shattered her fine
vases against the ground. When
