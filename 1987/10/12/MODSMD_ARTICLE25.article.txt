## Johnson, Cardinal spank Cougars 44-7 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
PULLMAN, Wash. â€” Stanford has
found a quarterback. And a tailback.
And, finally, a win.
Sophomore quarterback Brian Johnson
and sophomore running back Jon Volpe
led the Cardinal to a 44-7 win over Wash
ington State Saturday before a crowd of
31,538 at Martin Stadium. The first vic
tory of the year for Stanford gives the
squad a 1-4 record and a 1-2 mark in the
Pacific 10 Conference. The Cougars
dropped to 2-3 overall and 0-1 in league
play.
"I'm relieved and elated," said Stan
ford Coach Jack Elway, a Washington
State alumnus who, appropriately
enough, returned to his alma mater
during Homecoming. "They're all must
wins, but this was one we sure as hell
needed, and they earned it."
Stanford earned the win without star
tailback Brad Muster, who did not even
make the trip. Still suffering from a
severely sprained ankle, Muster did not
practice last week.
Filling in for Muster, Volpe almost
looked like a smaller (5-foot-7) version of
his senior running mate, rushing for 105
yards on 26 carries. Volpe is the first
Stanford player other than Muster to run
for over 100 yards in a game since
Thomas Henley accomplished the feat
against California in 1984. (Muster rushed
for 204 yards in the same contest.)
"Jon did a hell of a job," Stanford cen
ter Andy Sinclair said. "He slammed it in
there and stayed on his feet."

"He likes to compete, and he likes to
play," Elway said. "He's a tough little
runner."
The biggest story of the day, however,
was Johnson, who was previously better
known for playing on the NCAA cham
pion Stanford baseball team than for
playing football. Johnson's only prior ex
perience at quarterback was one minute
and four seconds of mop-up duty in the
Cardinal's 49-0 loss to UCLA. The soph
omore was the third quarterback to start
for Stanford in the last three weeks, fol
lowing the heels of senior Greg Ennis and
sophomore Scott Stark.
If Johnson's performance against
Washington State is any indication, Stan
ford won't be making any more changes
at quarterback in the near future.
"We've found a quarterback," Elway
said. "Brian did a heck of a job. ... He
had a big day today. He's a competitor.
Don't ask me why I didn't do it (start
Johnson) earlier."
"I was hoping I could do the job," said
Johnson, who completed 12 of 23 passes
for 278 yards and two touchdowns. "I
really didn't try to think that far ahead. It
was a situation where I saw after the
UCLA game that we had to do something
at my position, and I saw I had an oppor
tunity."
Johnson certainly took advantage of all
the opportunities Washington State gave
Stanford to score in the first half, leading
the Cardinal to a 41-7 advantage at
halftime. The 41 points was more than the

Sophomore Jon Volpe (20) proved Saturday against Washington State that the Stanford ground attack can function without
injured senior Brad Muster. Volpe rushed for 105 yards and two touchdowns on 26 carries.
