## Johnson, Cardinal spank Cougars 44-7 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
PULLMAN, Wash. — Stanford has
found a quarterback. And a tailback.
And, finally, a win.
Sophomore quarterback Brian Johnson
and sophomore running back Jon Volpe
led the Cardinal to a 44-7 win over Wash
ington State Saturday before a crowd of
31,538 at Martin Stadium. The first vic
tory of the year for Stanford gives the
squad a 1-4 record and a 1-2 mark in the
Pacific 10 Conference. The Cougars
dropped to 2-3 overall and 0-1 in league
play.
"I'm relieved and elated," said Stan
ford Coach Jack Elway, a Washington
State alumnus who, appropriately
enough, returned to his alma mater
during Homecoming. "They're all must
wins, but this was one we sure as hell
needed, and they earned it."
Stanford earned the win without star
tailback Brad Muster, who did not even
make the trip. Still suffering from a
severely sprained ankle, Muster did not
practice last week.
Filling in for Muster, Volpe almost
looked like a smaller (5-foot-7) version of
his senior running mate, rushing for 105
yards on 26 carries. Volpe is the first
Stanford player other than Muster to run
for over 100 yards in a game since
Thomas Henley accomplished the feat
against California in 1984. (Muster rushed
for 204 yards in the same contest.)
"Jon did a hell of a job," Stanford cen
ter Andy Sinclair said. "He slammed it in
there and stayed on his feet."

"He likes to compete, and he likes to
play," Elway said. "He's a tough little
runner."
The biggest story of the day, however,
was Johnson, who was previously better
known for playing on the NCAA cham
pion Stanford baseball team than for
playing football. Johnson's only prior ex
perience at quarterback was one minute
and four seconds of mop-up duty in the
Cardinal's 49-0 loss to UCLA. The soph
omore was the third quarterback to start
for Stanford in the last three weeks, fol
lowing the heels of senior Greg Ennis and
sophomore Scott Stark.
If Johnson's performance against
Washington State is any indication, Stan
ford won't be making any more changes
at quarterback in the near future.
"We've found a quarterback," Elway
said. "Brian did a heck of a job. ... He
had a big day today. He's a competitor.
Don't ask me why I didn't do it (start
Johnson) earlier."
"I was hoping I could do the job," said
Johnson, who completed 12 of 23 passes
for 278 yards and two touchdowns. "I
really didn't try to think that far ahead. It
was a situation where I saw after the
UCLA game that we had to do something
at my position, and I saw I had an oppor
tunity."
Johnson certainly took advantage of all
the opportunities Washington State gave
Stanford to score in the first half, leading
the Cardinal to a 41-7 advantage at
halftime. The 41 points was more than the

offense had scored in three
straight previous games
combined and was the highest
point total in one half for a Stan
ford team since Stanford beat
UCLA 82-0 in 1925.
The Cougars decided to pres
sure the young Stanford quarter
back heavily early on, and it
proved to be a mistake. Johnson,
demonstrating a great deal of

poise and confidence, repeatedly
took advantage of the WSU blitz
by waiting for the rush and then
firing passes over the Cougar
defense and into the emptied-out
middle.
In fact, that's exactly what
happened on the team's first
touchdown. On Stanford's
second possession, the Cardinal
had second down and 10 yards to
go, when WSU blitzed. The
Cougars over-blitzed, leaving
Volpe all alone in the middle of
the field — wide open, no one
near him or behind him. Johnson

spotted him (he was impossible
to miss) and the result was a 65-
yard score.
"They (WSU) brought
everybody," Johnson said. "1
held off as long as I could to try
and get it to him (Volpe). It's a
good sign when you look upfield
and all you see are the goal
posts."
"1 kind of hesitated a little
bit," Volpe said, "and then I
said. Hey. there's the end zone,'
and I just took off. That doesn't
happen too often, and when it
does, you have to take advantage

oi n.
Not nearly so pleased with the
play, WSU Coach Dennis Erick
son said, "We had a blitz called,
then the guy responsible for the
back obviously missed his as
signment."
Obviously. The Cougars kept
trying to blitz, however, and the
results were similar. On the next
Stanford possession, faced with
third and eight at the WSU 45-
yard line, Johnson, under pres
sure, threw to Jeff James on the
left side. The senior receiver
made a leaping catch and took

the ball 33 yards. Two plays
later, Volpe ran the ball in from
the 5-yard line.
"Brian has the poise and the
intelligence and the athletic abil
ity," James said. "He's what we
needed right now. He doesn't get
rattled, and he gets the plays ex
ecuted."
The Cougars have a sopho
more quarterback of their own,
highly touted Timm Rosenbach,
who was second in the confer
ence in passing going into the
Stanford game. He scored
WSU's only touchdown on a

one-yard run in the first quarter
after an 86-yard drive, but the
Cardinal defense held the
Cougars scoreless the rest of the
game. Rosenbach finished with
188 yards on 23-for-37 passing.
The WSU defense was not
having nearly as much success
against Johnson, who hit tight
end Jim Price on another of those
over-the-middle specials on the
third play of the second quarter.
On the next Stanford drive, the
Cardinal quarterback hit James
for a 35-yard gain and drove the
offense down to the WSU 13
before John Hopkins came in to
boot a 30-yard field goal, the first
of three three-pointers on the day
for the freshman kicker.
Minutes later, on the next Car
dinal possession, Johnson com
pleted a 24-yard pass to Volpe
and a 20-yarder to James on a
drive which culminated in a
Volpe 9-yard touchdown run.
"Somebody told me last week
that 1 hadn't caught a pass for
over eight yards," said James,
who finished with six receptions
for 115 yards. "I'm happy now.
Brian put the ball out on my
shoulders a little bit so 1 could get
downfield."
At this point, Stanford led 31-
7, but things got even worse for
Washington State, simply spoil
ing Homecoming altogether.
First Alan Grant returned a punt
77 yards for a Stanford score,
then WSU's Elmer Thomas
fumbled the ensuing kickoff and
the Cardinal recovered at the
Cougar 14-yard line. Stanford
settled for another 30-yard kick
by Hopkins to lead 41-7 at the
half.
Things calmed down a bit in
the second half, with just one
score, an 18-yard field goal by
Hopkins, early in the third quar
ter.
