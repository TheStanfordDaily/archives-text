## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer
team has arrived.
By winning the AT&T/Pacific
West Soccer Classic over the
weekend, the Cardinal not only
gained the respect of opposing
coaches and players, but it gar
nered national attention as well.
By defeating UCLA 1-0 yester
day at Maloney Field, the streak
ing Cardinal increased its win
ning streak to four and raised its
record to 7-4-2. It was Stanford's
first win ever over the nationally
ranked Bruins.
"It was a great victory and a
fantastic way to finish the last
nine days (victories over San
Francisco, Fresno State, Wash
ington and UCLA)," Stanford
Coach Sam Koch said.
UCLA attacked early, quickly
moving the ball into Stanford ter
ritory and controlling the pace of
the match. But the Cardinal
rallied, pressuring Bruin goalie
Anton Nistl and playing superb
defense. Though Stanford out
shot UCLA 5-3 during the first
period, neither team scored and
the game went into the second
half tied 0-0.
The winning goal was scored
by senior midfielder Pat Sheehy
two-and-a-half minutes into the

final period. The strike came
when Sheehy followed the
rebound of a shot by defender
Tim Westergren.
"It's the most exciting goal
I've ever made," Sheehy said.
"But winning the game land the
tournament) is the highlight of
my career."
Although the Cardinal fol
lowed its goal with two more
potent shots, UCLA was able to
switch the match's momentum
and take control of the remainder
of the contest.
In the final 30 minutes, the
Bruins took eight shots on goal
and the game was played almost
entirely in Cardinal territory. But
behind the outstanding defensive
play of sweeper Mark Semioli
and goalie Chris Helling, Stan
ford was able to shut down stan
dout Bruin forward Jeff Hooker
and the entire Bruin offense.
"We played well and fought
hard,'" UCLA Coach Sigi
Schmid said. "We created a fair
amount of chances but paid the
price for our one mistake."
"UCLA is a great team,"
Koch said. "They moved the ball
very well during the second half.
Their defense put a lot of pres
sure on us the last 30 minutes."
Stanford advanced to yester
day's championship by defeating
Washington in the first round.

Two late goals gave the Cardinal
a 2-1 victory over the Huskies
Saturday at Maloney Field.
Down 1-0 at the half, Chris
Porch scored five minutes into
the second period to tie the
score. With two minutes remain
ing. defender David Thorpe
headed a Porch cornerkick past
Husky goalie Jeff Koch for the
winning goal.
"At half time we settled
down," Koch said. "We realized
that we were a much better team
than we were showing on the
field. We knew we could turn the
game around in our favor."
In the other semifinal, UCLA
also came back from a 1-0
halftime deficit. Bruin defender
Peter Pelle and midfielder Will
Steadman both scored during the
second period to give the Bruins
the victory over California.
The consolation game between
Cal and Washington, held prior
to the championship match yes
terday, almost went into
overtime. With seven seconds
remaining and the score tied 2-2,
Cal defender Peter Woodring
scored to give the Golden Bears a
third-place finish.
Cardinal sweeper Semioli was
named Most Valuable Player of
the tournament. "Mark is a very
commanding player," Schmid

said. "He was deserving as the
choice for MVP."
Five other Stanford players
joined Semioli on the All-
Tournament Team. Sheehy,
Thorpe, Porch and for
ward/midfielder Brian Mahaffey
were also selected.
The rising Cardinal has not
only won its past four games, but
it has shut out three of its last
four opponents and held the
fourth to one goal.
The team credits its turn
around from the beginning of the
season to cohesiveness and ex
perience gained during its East
Coast roadtrip and a tough loss to
Sacramento State. "We've had
some really inspirational play,"
Semioli said. "We pulled to
gether after the disappointing
loss to Sacramento State and
won our next four."
In addition to Cardinal players
talking about postseason action,
opposing coaches also said Stan
ford deserves a NCAA tourna
ment invitaion. "They've got to
be a playoff team now," Schmid
said. "The NCAA can't look
past them now."
Stanford faces San Jose State
in its next game Wednesday at 3
p.m. at Maloney Field. Losing 12
seniors from the 1986 roster, the
Spartans are in a rebuilding year.
