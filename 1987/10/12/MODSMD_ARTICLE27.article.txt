# Stanford bows to No. 1 Bears

BERKELEY â€” Friday night at California's
Spieker Pool, the Stanford water polo team started
something it couldn't finish, scoring more times in
the first quarter than it would the rest of the game.
After Erich Fischer's spectacular goal at 1:11 in
the first quarter put No. 2 Stanford (12-3) ahead 2-0
against No. 1 California (12-2), the Cardinal's level
of play dropped sharply while the Bears raised their
execution a notch. Cal ran off seven goals, inter
rupted by only one Stanford tally, winning 7-3 and
confirming its top ranking.
A record crowd of 2500 cheered the Bears and
jeered at the Cardinal, as Cal proved itself a quicker
and fiercer team than its arch rival. The contest was
in many respects a lesson of the value of an experi
enced team.
The Bears that won Friday night are virtually the
same Bears who lost to the Cardinal in the 1986
NCAA championship final. Cal also has the added
bonus this season of senior Matt Biondi, a three
time All-America (yes, in water polo) who took last
year off to concentrate on his legendary swimming
career. On the other hand, the heart of Stanford's
1985 and 1986 national championship squad has
graduated.
"We haven't been playing together for more than
six months," senior Bob Abbott said. "1 think, if
anything, [the loss] will bring us a little closer to
gether and help us know our strengths and weak
nesses."
The strengths were obvious in the first quarter
when the Cardinal's quick start silenced the crowd
and startled the Bears.
With less than two minutes gone off the game
clock. Stanford's potent counterattack struck when
Cardinal Captain and All-American Matt Tingler
carried goalkeeper Obi Greenman's outlet pass all
the way down the left side to score past Cal's junior
goalie Jeff Brush.
