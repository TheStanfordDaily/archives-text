# Stanford bows to No. 1 Bears

### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
BERKELEY — Friday night at California's
Spieker Pool, the Stanford water polo team started
something it couldn't finish, scoring more times in
the first quarter than it would the rest of the game.
After Erich Fischer's spectacular goal at 1:11 in
the first quarter put No. 2 Stanford (12-3) ahead 2-0
against No. 1 California (12-2), the Cardinal's level
of play dropped sharply while the Bears raised their
execution a notch. Cal ran off seven goals, inter
rupted by only one Stanford tally, winning 7-3 and
confirming its top ranking.
A record crowd of 2500 cheered the Bears and
jeered at the Cardinal, as Cal proved itself a quicker
and fiercer team than its arch rival. The contest was
in many respects a lesson of the value of an experi
enced team.
The Bears that won Friday night are virtually the
same Bears who lost to the Cardinal in the 1986
NCAA championship final. Cal also has the added
bonus this season of senior Matt Biondi, a three
time All-America (yes, in water polo) who took last
year off to concentrate on his legendary swimming
career. On the other hand, the heart of Stanford's
1985 and 1986 national championship squad has
graduated.
"We haven't been playing together for more than
six months," senior Bob Abbott said. "1 think, if
anything, [the loss] will bring us a little closer to
gether and help us know our strengths and weak
nesses."
The strengths were obvious in the first quarter
when the Cardinal's quick start silenced the crowd
and startled the Bears.
With less than two minutes gone off the game
clock. Stanford's potent counterattack struck when
Cardinal Captain and All-American Matt Tingler
carried goalkeeper Obi Greenman's outlet pass all
the way down the left side to score past Cal's junior
goalie Jeff Brush.
Following Cal errors on two
excellent counterattack scoring
opportunities, Stanford struck
again when Fischer controlled
the ball in the hole and, without
so much as a glance at the cage,
backhanded the ball by Brush.
On the next series, the Bears
earned their first six-on-five ad
vantage when Abbott was
ejected. Fifteen seconds later
Cal's Rich Ambidge brought the
score to 2-1 with a goal from four
meters.
Ambidge's tally came just at
the end of a quarter which ex
emplified improved offenses on
both sides since the two teams
met on Sept. 26, when Stanford
won 4-2.
The Cardinal slowed down a
bit in the second quarter, but Cal
picked up the pace. Less than a
minute into the period, Joel
Thomas evened the score at 2-2
on a Bear counterattack.
The Cardinal then earned its
first of what would be only two
six-on-five advantages for the
match. It looked like Stanford
would capitalize when a lob shot
from Fischer made its way over
Brush's head and toward the far
post. On what Stanford Coach
Dante Dettamanti called "a great
play," however, Cal's Tom
Hermstad saved the day for the
Bears with quick weak-side
defense, catching the ball just
before it reached the net. Neither
team had another good scoring
opportunity until 1:32 remained
in the half.
A few seconds later, Tingler
carried the ball past his defender

after a convincing fake, causing a
four-meter penalty shot to be
called. The prized, but pressure
filled, honors went to Jeff
Oeding, who shot to Brush's
right. The Cal goalkeeper lunged
quickly as the shot grazed his
hand, hit the post and bounced
out of the goal mouth.
After the game, Dettamanti
pointed to that sequence as the
game's biggest moment. "If
you're going to pick a turning
point, that was it," Dettamanti
said. "From then on, it went
downhill."

'We played a super
first half; we just
played a lousy second
half. I don't know what
it was. We certainly
created some pretty
decent shots.'

Cal Coach Pete Cutino agreed
that the missed penalty shot was
important but said its importance
should not be exaggerated, be
cause it came "so early" in the
game. "Obviously you pick up
some momentum," Cutino said.
"When something like that hap
pens, the kids really get
excited."
In fact, the Bears were
"excited" enough to score on the
very next series when Andre
Weiglein rifled in a shot from
several meters out.
Stanford, though, countered
immediately when senior Grant

Stanley redirected a lob pass
from Fischer past Brush to tie the
score at 3-3 with just 30 seconds
left in the half.
Stanley's goal was the last Car
dinal goal of the game. The
second half was all Cal: Bear
size, Bear speed, Bear defense.
The first goal came less than 25
seconds into the third quarter
and the last with one minute
remaining in the fourth, when
Rob Solomon tallied Cal's
seventh goal of the match.
"The score was 7-3," Cutino
said, "but it was a hard 7-3. . . .
I'm a realist to know that if
[Stanford] makes its extra man
and penalty count, it's a 7-6
game."
"We played a super first half;
we just played a lousy second
half," Dettamanti said. "I don't
know what it was. We certainly
created some pretty decent
shots. We created the penalty
shot, we created two six-on
fives, we got shots at the end of
our counter. Brush had a real
good game, but we weren't
taking real tough shots at him. 1
don't think we challenged
enough.
"Cal played a real good
game," Dettamanti added.
"They made the goals when they
had to."
Cal's victory, though, should
not make the Bears too confident
or the Cardinal too disappointed,
according to Cutino and Brush.
"The competition is so tight this
year, I think every team will have
to improve and will improve,"
Cutino said.
"I like to think we're not going
to lose any more games," Brush
said. "We have a real good team,
but so does Stanford. They're
surprising a lot of people."
