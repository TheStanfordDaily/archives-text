There's no better way to enjoy a Sun
day than with a little roast duck.
The Stanford women's volleyball team
returned home from the state of Oregon
yesterday after taking first place in the
Pacific 10 Conference away from the
Oregon Ducks. The Cardinal beat Oregon
State Friday night, 15-5, 12-15, 15-3, 15-7,
then beat Oregon Saturday night 15-8, 19-
17, 15-11.
Those two wins, coupled with Califor
nia's five-game upset over the Ducks on
Friday, gave Stanford sole possession of
first place in the Pac-10 with a 6-1 mark.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal is now 13-3
overall and in the midst of an eight-match
winning streak, the longest for the team
since 1985.
Oregon fell from first to third as the
Ducks are now 9-5, 6-2 in Pac-10 play and
percentage points behind UCLA's 5-1
mark. Oregon State remained on the
other end of the standings as its 12th con
secutive loss dropped the Beavers to I
-12,0-8.
The trip didn't look as promising early
Friday night. Stanford raced out to a big
lead against Oregon State as senior
outside hitter Teresa Smith jump-served
eight straight points to open game one.
The Cardinal coastcd to a 15-5 win but
was not completely satisfied.
"Wc started out really slow," sopho
more Jenny Chaffee said. "Everybody
had a bad warmup."
Oregon State took the second game
before Stanford finally got going. "It
(losing game two) pretty much opened
our eyes. We realized we needed to get
going," Chaffee said.
Ciet going they did, proving how hap
less the Beavers really are. The Cardinal
took games three and four in fine fashion,
led by senior Nancy Reno. The middle

blocker had 12 kills and posted a .647 hit
ting percentage as well as a team-high
five blocks.
Smith also pitched in with nine kills
and a .438 hitting percentage in the vic
tory.
"It was obvious that we were looking
ahead to Oregon." Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said.
While the Stanford win was important,
perhaps a bigger match for the Cardinal
was taking place simultaneously in
Eugene. Unranked California pulled off a
stunning upset of No. 11 Oregon, beating
the Ducks 15-12, 13-13, 4-15, 3-15, 15-8.
This set the stage for a Stanford-Oregon
matchup the following night which would
be a battle for sole possession of first
place in the Pac-10.
The key word for the match against
Oregon was blocking. The Cardinal held
Oregon to a .109 hitting percentage, due
mostly to 15 blocks. Reno had six, while
junior Laura Olesen added five blocks.
The first game, in front of nearly 25(H)
fans at McArthur Court, went to Stanford
15-8, but then the momentum switched
when the Ducks charged out to a 12-4
lead in game two.
The Cardinal then began a tremendous
comeback. "We steadied out," Shaw
said. "We started siding-out."
Stanford came back to 12-all before al
lowing another point. The Ducks scored
twice then, but when they served for the
game, they hit a net serve. Stanford tied
the score, but Oregon scored again and
served for the game at 15-14.
A kill by sophomore Lara Asper gave
Stanford a side out, and two points later
the Cardinal had the chance to go two
games up. This time, though, Stanford
committed a serving error of its own on
game point.
