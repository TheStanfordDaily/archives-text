# Spikers win two, grab Pacific 10 lead

### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
There's no better way to enjoy a Sun
day than with a little roast duck.
The Stanford women's volleyball team
returned home from the state of Oregon
yesterday after taking first place in the
Pacific 10 Conference away from the
Oregon Ducks. The Cardinal beat Oregon
State Friday night, 15-5, 12-15, 15-3, 15-7,
then beat Oregon Saturday night 15-8, 19-
17, 15-11.
Those two wins, coupled with Califor
nia's five-game upset over the Ducks on
Friday, gave Stanford sole possession of
first place in the Pac-10 with a 6-1 mark.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal is now 13-3
overall and in the midst of an eight-match
winning streak, the longest for the team
since 1985.
Oregon fell from first to third as the
Ducks are now 9-5, 6-2 in Pac-10 play and
percentage points behind UCLA's 5-1
mark. Oregon State remained on the
other end of the standings as its 12th con
secutive loss dropped the Beavers to I
-12,0-8.
The trip didn't look as promising early
Friday night. Stanford raced out to a big
lead against Oregon State as senior
outside hitter Teresa Smith jump-served
eight straight points to open game one.
The Cardinal coastcd to a 15-5 win but
was not completely satisfied.
"Wc started out really slow," sopho
more Jenny Chaffee said. "Everybody
had a bad warmup."
Oregon State took the second game
before Stanford finally got going. "It
(losing game two) pretty much opened
our eyes. We realized we needed to get
going," Chaffee said.
Ciet going they did, proving how hap
less the Beavers really are. The Cardinal
took games three and four in fine fashion,
led by senior Nancy Reno. The middle

blocker had 12 kills and posted a .647 hit
ting percentage as well as a team-high
five blocks.
Smith also pitched in with nine kills
and a .438 hitting percentage in the vic
tory.
"It was obvious that we were looking
ahead to Oregon." Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said.
While the Stanford win was important,
perhaps a bigger match for the Cardinal
was taking place simultaneously in
Eugene. Unranked California pulled off a
stunning upset of No. 11 Oregon, beating
the Ducks 15-12, 13-13, 4-15, 3-15, 15-8.
This set the stage for a Stanford-Oregon
matchup the following night which would
be a battle for sole possession of first
place in the Pac-10.
The key word for the match against
Oregon was blocking. The Cardinal held
Oregon to a .109 hitting percentage, due
mostly to 15 blocks. Reno had six, while
junior Laura Olesen added five blocks.
The first game, in front of nearly 25(H)
fans at McArthur Court, went to Stanford
15-8, but then the momentum switched
when the Ducks charged out to a 12-4
lead in game two.
The Cardinal then began a tremendous
comeback. "We steadied out," Shaw
said. "We started siding-out."
Stanford came back to 12-all before al
lowing another point. The Ducks scored
twice then, but when they served for the
game, they hit a net serve. Stanford tied
the score, but Oregon scored again and
served for the game at 15-14.
A kill by sophomore Lara Asper gave
Stanford a side out, and two points later
the Cardinal had the chance to go two
games up. This time, though, Stanford
committed a serving error of its own on
game point.

Senior Nancy Reno (II) and junior Amy Hayes (6) each contrib
uted to the Cardinal's strong blocking performance over the
weekend. Reno had six out of Stanford's 15 hktcks against Oregon
on Saturdav.
With another chance, the
Ducks took a 17-16 lead, and
after a great dig, senior Teri
Kramer hit for the game. Al
though she is one of the most
prolific hitters in NCAA history,
her back row attack on Oregon's
third game point sailed long.
Reno then came up with a solo
block, teamed with Smith for an
other block and dropped in a dink
for three points and the game, 19-
17.
Shaw was impressed with the
comeback. "We've been doing
that all year," he said. "We're
hanging in there, and we're find
ing a way to win these games."
The third game was almost an
ticlimactic as Oregon's spirit was
broken, and Stanford continued
its winning ways.

Stanford was again led by
Smith and Reno, who had 13 and
12 kills, respectively, while
Olesen added 10.
The Cardinal also managed to
slow down Oregon's offense.
Kramer was held to 11 kills and a
.125 hitting percentage, while the
Ducks' other outside hitters
fared even worse. Michele
Krebsbach, the Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year last season, had only
five kills while hitting -.065, and
Melissa Terzian hit .000.
"It was a real good effort,"
Shaw said. "Our blocking and
defense were as good as they've
been all year. . . . We really did a
job on them (Oregon's outside
hitters)."
Chaffee thought the loss to Cal
had taken a lot out of Oregon.
"They were pretty flat," she
said, "and we took it to them.
They didn't look that up for it."
The Pac-10 race is now a mess
at the top. Stanford leads with its

only league loss having come at
the hands of UCLA, while the
Bruins are a half game back
(having lost at Oregon two weeks
ago). The Ducks are also a half
game back, and USC remains in
the running with a 4-2 league
mark.
The Cardinal returns to action
Friday night when Arizona State
comes to town. Saturday night
the Cardinal hosts Arizona.

17, 15-11.
Those two wins, coupled with Califor
nia's five-game upset over the Ducks on
Friday, gave Stanford sole possession of
first place in the Pac-10 with a 6-1 mark.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal is now 13-3
overall and in the midst of an eight-match
winning streak, the longest for the team
since 1985.
Oregon fell from first to third as the
Ducks are now 9-5, 6-2 in Pac-10 play and
percentage points behind UCLA's 5-1
mark. Oregon State remained on the
other end of the standings as its 12th con
secutive loss dropped the Beavers to I
-12,0-8.
The trip didn't look as promising early
Friday night. Stanford raced out to a big
lead against Oregon State as senior
outside hitter Teresa Smith jump-served
eight straight points to open game one.
The Cardinal coastcd to a 15-5 win but
was not completely satisfied.
"Wc started out really slow," sopho
more Jenny Chaffee said. "Everybody
had a bad warmup."
Oregon State took the second game
before Stanford finally got going. "It
(losing game two) pretty much opened
our eyes. We realized we needed to get
going," Chaffee said.
Ciet going they did, proving how hap
less the Beavers really are. The Cardinal
took games three and four in fine fashion,
led by senior Nancy Reno. The middle

blocker had 12 kills and posted a .647 hit
ting percentage as well as a team-high
five blocks.
Smith also pitched in with nine kills
and a .438 hitting percentage in the vic
tory.
"It was obvious that we were looking
ahead to Oregon." Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said.
While the Stanford win was important,
perhaps a bigger match for the Cardinal
was taking place simultaneously in
Eugene. Unranked California pulled off a
stunning upset of No. 11 Oregon, beating
the Ducks 15-12, 13-13, 4-15, 3-15, 15-8.
This set the stage for a Stanford-Oregon
matchup the following night which would
be a battle for sole possession of first
place in the Pac-10.
The key word for the match against
Oregon was blocking. The Cardinal held
Oregon to a .109 hitting percentage, due
mostly to 15 blocks. Reno had six, while
junior Laura Olesen added five blocks.
The first game, in front of nearly 25(H)
fans at McArthur Court, went to Stanford
15-8, but then the momentum switched
when the Ducks charged out to a 12-4
lead in game two.
The Cardinal then began a tremendous
comeback. "We steadied out," Shaw
said. "We started siding-out."
Stanford came back to 12-all before al
lowing another point. The Ducks scored
twice then, but when they served for the
game, they hit a net serve. Stanford tied
the score, but Oregon scored again and
served for the game at 15-14.
A kill by sophomore Lara Asper gave
Stanford a side out, and two points later
the Cardinal had the chance to go two
games up. This time, though, Stanford
committed a serving error of its own on
game point.

Senior Nancy Reno (II) and junior Amy Hayes (6) each contrib
uted to the Cardinal's strong blocking performance over the
weekend. Reno had six out of Stanford's 15 hktcks against Oregon
on Saturdav.
With another chance, the
Ducks took a 17-16 lead, and
after a great dig, senior Teri
Kramer hit for the game. Al
though she is one of the most
prolific hitters in NCAA history,
her back row attack on Oregon's
third game point sailed long.
Reno then came up with a solo
block, teamed with Smith for an
other block and dropped in a dink
for three points and the game, 19-
17.
Shaw was impressed with the
comeback. "We've been doing
that all year," he said. "We're
hanging in there, and we're find
ing a way to win these games."
The third game was almost an
ticlimactic as Oregon's spirit was
broken, and Stanford continued
its winning ways.

Stanford was again led by
Smith and Reno, who had 13 and
12 kills, respectively, while
Olesen added 10.
The Cardinal also managed to
slow down Oregon's offense.
Kramer was held to 11 kills and a
.125 hitting percentage, while the
Ducks' other outside hitters
fared even worse. Michele
Krebsbach, the Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year last season, had only
five kills while hitting -.065, and
Melissa Terzian hit .000.
"It was a real good effort,"
Shaw said. "Our blocking and
defense were as good as they've
been all year. . . . We really did a
job on them (Oregon's outside
hitters)."
Chaffee thought the loss to Cal
had taken a lot out of Oregon.
"They were pretty flat," she
said, "and we took it to them.
They didn't look that up for it."
The Pac-10 race is now a mess
at the top. Stanford leads with its

only league loss having come at
the hands of UCLA, while the
Bruins are a half game back
(having lost at Oregon two weeks
ago). The Ducks are also a half
game back, and USC remains in
the running with a 4-2 league
mark.
The Cardinal returns to action
Friday night when Arizona State
comes to town. Saturday night
the Cardinal hosts Arizona.

The Stanford women's volleyball team

yesterday after taking first place in the
Pacific 10 Conference away from the
Oregon Ducks. The Cardinal beat Oregon
