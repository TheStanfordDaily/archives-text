# Cardinal overwhelms Cal 2-0
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
Junior Kat Thomas scored six
minutes into the first half, and the Stan
ford field hockey team went on to
cruise to a relatively easy 2-0 win Sat
urday over visiting California.
Thomas' goal came off the rebound
of a set play that the Cardinal started
from its own end of the field. It was "a
great passing combination," Stanford
Coach Sheryl Johnson said.
"Fortunately, Kat was there to knock
in the rebound."
The remainder of the first half was
played evenly as both teams were able
to mount consistent attacks. If not for
the play of junior goalie Karen Jones,
however, the Cardinal may have easily
found itself behind at the end of the
first 35 minutes of play.
"Karen Jones made some outstand
ing saves," Johnson said. "She was
able to tip two or three excellent Cal
opportunities just past the cage."
The second half saw the seesaw bat
tle continue as each team continued to

attack relentlessly.
Despite many chances on both sides,
the only goal scored in the second pe
riod came with 54 seconds left to play.
Junior Dana Fleming scored for the
fifth time this season when she ex
ecuted her third successful penalty
stroke of the year. Fleming, the Cardi
nal's leading scorer, now has a total of
11 points this year.
Overall, Johnson was pleased with
her team's performance. "We played
well and got a good win. I thought 2-0
was a good score for us," she said.
Johnson, however, did not dismiss
the quality of the Bears' effort.
"California played an excellent game,"
she said. "There was a lot of good
hockey. It was a good game to watch."
It was clearly an exciting game to
watch. The two teams combined for 27
shots on goal (Stanford had 13) as the
action remained fast-paced throughout.
Both goalies, however, responded to
the pressure and had excellent games.
Jones finished with eight saves, while
Cal's Ciera Cox had nine.
In upping its record to 7-3 (4-0 in

Northern Pacific Conference play), the
ninth-ranked Cardinal put itself in posi
tion to run away with the league title. If
Stanford is able to win the title, the
Cardinal will be assured of its third
consecutive NCAA tournament berth.
The team is also hoping to finish the
season ranked in the nation's top four,
which would gain it a bye in the first
round of the NCAA tournament.
The Cardinal next faces Pacific at
home Wednesday afternoon.
"Pacific is improving with every
game," Johnson said. "They are
definitely getting much better as they
gain game experience. We can't afford
to take them lightly, even though I ex
pect to win the game."
After Wednesday's game, the Cardi
nal will enjoy a break in the regular
season for the alumni game Oct. 17.
Stanford won't resume conference play
again until the California Invitational
Oct. 24-25, followed by San Jose State
on Oct. 26. The Cardinal concludes the
regular season at home Nov. 2 against
Chico State.
