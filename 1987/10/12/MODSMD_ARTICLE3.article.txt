# Former activist joins Law School faculty
## Inside

In some ways Janet Cooper resembles
Norma Rae, the title character in the film
by the same name. Rae crusaded for fel
low workers' rights in much the same
way that Cooper, associate professor at
the Law School, has acted to change so
ciety for the better.
Over the past 16 years. Cooper has
protested the Vietnam War. worked to
improve union representation of female
clerical workers and been involved with
securities law as a partner in a prestigious
San Francisco law firm.
As a graduate student at Stanford in
1971, Cooper was suspended for radical
behavior in protesting the Vietnam War.
She returned to Stanford only recently,
this time as an associate professor.
Cooper's return to the institution that
she once spoke out against illustrates
how she has worked from inside as well
as outside the establishment to promote
change.
"I still have some ideals that I believe
strongly in, but 1 am no longer an activ
ist," Cooper said, adding that she is poli
tically more conservative today. "I am
not a Marxist," she said.
Since her political ideology has shifted
and her activism has mellowed. Cooper
has worked through established channels
to promote societal change. She has
brought the history of these struggles to
Stanford.
Cooper, who is now married, was
known as Janet Weiss as an undergradu

ate. After her senior year at Stanford she
went on to study for a Fh.D in English in
hopes of teaching.
However, the United States' involve
ment in Vietnam interrupted her studies.
"We felt that (the war) was contrary to
ideals we had about this country,"
Cooper said. "That's why it was terribly
divisive â€” people on both sides had
strong, idealistic opinions."
In January, 1971, Cooper demon
strated against a Hoover Institution
sponsored speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge, then U.S. ambassador to South
Vietnam. Lodge planned to speak on
America's role as world peacekeeper.
About 200 people protested, Cooper
said. Stanford charged seven of the
protesters, including Cooper, with dis
rupting Lodge's speech. Two weeks later
the Office of Judicial Affairs tried the
protesters. Stanford students vocally
protested the charges, turning the event
into what the Stanford Daily called a
"verbal free-for-all." Spectators filled
the courtroom, and 130 crowded outside
to listen.
According to Law School Professor
Emeritus Howard Williams, who
presided at the trial, Cooper told the
court that those accused would not par
ticipate in the trial and plead no contest to
the charges against them because Presi
dent Nixon had allowed the invasion of
Laos.
The court suspended Cooper for four
