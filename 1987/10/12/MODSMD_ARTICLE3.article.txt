# Former activist joins Law School faculty
## Inside 
### Sarah McCraw 
In some ways Janet Cooper resembles
Norma Rae, the title character in the film
by the same name. Rae crusaded for fel
low workers' rights in much the same
way that Cooper, associate professor at
the Law School, has acted to change so
ciety for the better.
Over the past 16 years. Cooper has
protested the Vietnam War. worked to
improve union representation of female
clerical workers and been involved with
securities law as a partner in a prestigious
San Francisco law firm.
As a graduate student at Stanford in
1971, Cooper was suspended for radical
behavior in protesting the Vietnam War.
She returned to Stanford only recently,
this time as an associate professor.
Cooper's return to the institution that
she once spoke out against illustrates
how she has worked from inside as well
as outside the establishment to promote
change.
"I still have some ideals that I believe
strongly in, but 1 am no longer an activ
ist," Cooper said, adding that she is poli
tically more conservative today. "I am
not a Marxist," she said.
Since her political ideology has shifted
and her activism has mellowed. Cooper
has worked through established channels
to promote societal change. She has
brought the history of these struggles to
Stanford.
Cooper, who is now married, was
known as Janet Weiss as an undergradu

ate. After her senior year at Stanford she
went on to study for a Fh.D in English in
hopes of teaching.
However, the United States' involve
ment in Vietnam interrupted her studies.
"We felt that (the war) was contrary to
ideals we had about this country,"
Cooper said. "That's why it was terribly
divisive — people on both sides had
strong, idealistic opinions."
In January, 1971, Cooper demon
strated against a Hoover Institution
sponsored speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge, then U.S. ambassador to South
Vietnam. Lodge planned to speak on
America's role as world peacekeeper.
About 200 people protested, Cooper
said. Stanford charged seven of the
protesters, including Cooper, with dis
rupting Lodge's speech. Two weeks later
the Office of Judicial Affairs tried the
protesters. Stanford students vocally
protested the charges, turning the event
into what the Stanford Daily called a
"verbal free-for-all." Spectators filled
the courtroom, and 130 crowded outside
to listen.
According to Law School Professor
Emeritus Howard Williams, who
presided at the trial, Cooper told the
court that those accused would not par
ticipate in the trial and plead no contest to
the charges against them because Presi
dent Nixon had allowed the invasion of
Laos.
The court suspended Cooper for four
quarters for violating the Univer
sity's Fundamental Standard of
student conduct.
"It's easy to forget how differ
ent things were then," Cooper
said. To bring about change, "we
did lots of things: we wrote
newspapers, letters to Congress,
held vigils," she said, explaining
that none of the paths established
to bring about change succeeded
in doing so.
According to Cooper, society,
the world and the issues are no
longer the same today because
"we've learned something from
all that [activism]."
Cooper eventually received a
masters degree from Stanford
and went on to do clerical work
for three years. During this time,
she helped to change the leader
ship of the union protecting the
workers in her company.
She and other union members
brought women into the union's
leadership, which until that time
had been predominantly male
while the workers were mostly
female.
After the majority of the union
offices were filled with women,
Cooper was elected vice presi
dent of the union.
Cooper's interest in law grew
out of her union involvement,

and she subsequently enrolled at
UC-Berkeley's Boalt Law
School.
"She was the best we've ever
had — an outstanding academic
record and a classic career,"
Dean of Boalt Jesse Choper said
of Cooper's years at Berkeley.
After law school, she clerked
first for California Supreme
Court Justice Shirley Hufstadler
and then for U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Thurgood Marshall.
After having daily exposure to
the court system. Cooper said,
she gained a high regard for the
legal system in the United States,
replacing the cynicism she felt
for the system as a student.
"The Supreme Court functions
better than just about any institu
tion," she said.
Cooper spent two years
working for the small Washing
ton, D.C. law firm Califano, Ross
& Heineman, and returned to the
Bay Area in 1982. After two
years at the San Francisco firm
Morrison & Foerster, Cooper
v/as made a partner.
She said she enjoyed her Cali
fornia practice more than her
Washington practice. In Wash
ington, she said, her cases al
ways involved lobbying or
"trying to get the government to
change its mind."

In San Francisco, she worked
on cases in business, securities,
employment, fraud, health care
and constitution law, where she
could "piece things out like a
detective novel" and see the
changes that resulted from her
work.

In May, 1987, Cooper resigned
her partnership and returned to
Stanford. Cooper referred to her
successful law career as prepara
tion for teaching law, rather than
as a success or end in itself.

In 1971, Janet Cooper was suspended from Stanford for radical behav
ior. Today, she is a professor at the Law School.
According to Cooper, practic
ing law gives her credibility as a
female professor as well as a per
spective she otherwise would not
have.
Cooper said she hopes that
teaching corporate law will serve
as a role model for female stu
dents, who traditionally shy
away from business courses.
The Boalt Law School also of
fered Cooper a teaching position.
"If Stanford Law School gets a
few more professors like her,
they might become as good as we
are," Choper joked.
Cooper said she doesn't mind
the attention and publicity her
activist past has brought her. If
she wanted to be left alone, she
added, she could have taught at
Berkeley, where a radical past is
unremarkable.
