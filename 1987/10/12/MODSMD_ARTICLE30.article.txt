### Hugh Bethell Staff writer 
Demonstrating its talent in Laser class sailboat
competition, the Stanford sailing team took four of
the top eight qualifying spots at the Northern Cali
fornia Singlehanded Eliminations Saturday and
Sunday at San Francisco State.
Because of strong performances by all four of the
Cardinal sailors competing in the regatta, Stanford
will be represented well in the Pacific Coast
Singlehanded Championship regatta scheduled for
Oct. 24-25.
The Cardinal was led this weekend by veteran
Laser ace Tom Kuhnle, who scored eight victories
and three second-place finishes on his way to win
ning the regatta. Sophomore Al Sargent came in
third place, registering one victory. Stanford co-
Captain There duPont also won a race and finished
sixth overall, and sophomore Robert Brown was

close behind in eighth place.
In all, 15 sailors from Northern California com
peted against the Cardinal foursome for the right to
represent the district in the Pacific Coast champi
onship.
"When we decided to send four sailors to this
regatta, I was hoping that at least two would
qualify, so I'm very pleased by the outcome,"
Stanford Coach Blake Middleton said. "The results
show that in Kuhnle we have a really hot talent,
and in Sargent and Brown we have real potential."
"Tom Kuhnle and I have been working on Laser
technique together for a long time, and it's nice to
see that work pay off," said junior Rita Snape.
Before Stanford resumes its effort to capture the
singlehanded championship, Kuhnle and Snape
and the other Stanford combinations will pair up
again for the Stoney Burke regatta Oct. 17-18. The
