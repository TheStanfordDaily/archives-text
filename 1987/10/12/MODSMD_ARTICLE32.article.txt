# No. 3 California crushes Cardinal 5-0 in Berkeley
## 
### Robert Pardington Staff writer 
California had an ambush waiting for
the Stanford women's soccer team when
the Cardinal visited Berkeley Friday
night.
The No. 3 Golden Bears used their su
perior speed to trounce Stanford 5-0.
With the loss, the Cardinal dropped to 1-
6-2, while Cal improved to 8-0-1.
While it aided Cal, the fast astroturf
field hurt Stanford's slower-paced attack.
"On three of the goals, we were simply
outrun," Stanford Coach Berhane An
deberhan said. "However, some of those
goals may have been offsides on Cal."
The officiating may have been some
what questionable, but Andeberhan made
a point of downplaying that factor in his
talk to the players at halftime.
"I told them that they were playing
very well, and not to worry about the
calls," Andeberhan said. "We have no
excuses. We just played an excellent
team."
Despite the lopsided loss, there were
several positive aspects that surfaced for
the Cardinal. Each member of the team
was healthy and fully recovered from the
virus that had plagued the team last
week.
Andeberhan substituted freely during
the game, giving all 18 players some game
time.

Sophomore fullback Kristy McDevitt
had an outstanding game, as did the
entire midfield. In the second half, Stan
ford's offense mounted some good coun
terattacks but could not capitalize on its
opportunities.
In goal, sophomore Vija Brookshire
played most of the game. Despite allow
ing five goals, Brookshire stopped many
shots on goal. Elise Edwards returned to
the lineup and contributed a few saves.
As each game has been for the young
Cardinal this year, this one was a learning
experience.
"We must retain confidence and com
posure in the center of the field," An
deberhan said. "We have to look for
combinations and dominate the ball."
Finishing opportunities has been a
problem for Stanford. On the season, the
Cardinal has been outscored 15-6. Sopho
more Tonya Antonucci has scored three
goals, but only Amy Geisse, Jenny
Rowland and Blair Elliott have added
tallies for the Cardinal this season.
Stanford is now 0-3 against the Bears
since the Cardinal program began three
years ago. Last year, Cal ran away from
Stanford 4-1.
The Cardinal will again try to better its
record Wednesday as it travels to San
Francisco.
