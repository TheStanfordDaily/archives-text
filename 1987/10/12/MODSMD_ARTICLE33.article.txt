# Diplomat calls for nuclear free zone
## 
### Burke Smith 
Arguing that Scandinavia is
not crucial to the international
strategic balance, a Finnish
diplomat speaking here Friday
advocated the creation of a
"Nordic Nuclear Free 7x)ne"
in the region.
In a wide-ranging talk to an
audience of about 30 people at
the Hoover Institution, Jukka
Valtasaari, deputy public af
fairs director at the Finnish
Ministry for Foreign Affairs,
also addressed Finland's ref
ugee problem and his
country's relations with the
Soviet Union.
According to Valtasaari, the
Finnish government has been
lobbying for the creation of a
Scandinavian nuclear free
zone since 1963.
The plan, known as the
"Nordic Nuclear Free Zone,"
mandates the unilateral re
moval of nuclear weapons
from Scandinavia. Finland, as
a neutral nation, is primarily
"concerned not so much
about the numbers (of weap
ons), but the effect on sta
bility,' Valtasaari said.
Valtasaari explained that al
though Finland considers "an
isolated attack against Finland
out of the question," many in
that country favor a nuclear
free zone because they fear
the use of Finnish air space as
a route for superpower cruise
missiles launched in either di
rection.
At present, the nuclear free
zone idea is being discussed
informally by the Scandi
navian countries, he said.
Noting that Norway, in par
ticular, may be reluctant to
agree to the plan, Valtasaari

said he does not forsee crea
tion of a nuclear free zone in
the near future.
An expert on security policy
and disarmament, Valtasaari
also said he did not consider
Finland to be a part of the
"northern balance" that
preoccupies NATO countries.
Finland, which at the end of
World War II chose not to join
NATO, has tried to "empha
size interaction rather than
isolation" as a means of
peaceful coexistence with the
Soviet Union, Valtasaari said.
Valtasaari added that this
policy has led to a situation in
which most Finnish exports go
to the Soviet Union.
Finnish nationals attending
the forum expressed concern
about this situation, arguing
that by "tailoring industry to
the needs of the Soviets," Fin
land has become a "puppet"
of the Soviet Union.
Valtasaari responded by
saying that because the So
viets have been such good cus
tomers for Finnish products,
especially in the area of ship
building, certain concessions
to Soviet needs have been
made.
Another point of contention
between many of those attend
ing the speech and Valtasaari
was the issue of Soviet ref
ugees in Finland. Finland's na
tional government discourages
political refugees from the So
viet Union from seeking
asylum in Finland.
Audience members also
accused the Finnish govern
ment of returning refugees to
the Soviet Union against their
will.
