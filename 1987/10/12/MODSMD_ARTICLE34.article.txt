Apple Computer Co. is attempting to lead
American industry into the 21st century, ac
cording to John Sculley, the company's presi
dent and CEO who spent several hours here
Friday autographing copies of his new book.
At the Bookstore signing copies of his new
book, "Odyssey: From Pepsi to Apple,"
Sculley attributed much of Apple's success to
universities like Stanford. He added that he
hopes to maintain the close ties that already
exist between Apple and Stanford.
"I feel that the real solutions (to economic
problems) are going to be reached by the gen
eration of people who are in the schools and
universities today but are going to be living in
the 21st century," he said.
Sculley said his book outlines some new
ways that corporations and countries can
solve their economic problems. "The only

way you're really going to get a productivity
change is to give people ways of working bet
ter, not just working faster," he said.
He added that his book also details the cir
cumstances of his departure from Pepsi,
where he was a top executive and his early
difficulties at Apple.
Sculley said his move to Apple was
motivated more by his desire to help with the
integration of computers into American life
than by personal economic motives.
"The whole focus (of the computer indus
try) is on creating new markets and building
new technologies to change the world," Scul
ley said. "So I am much more of a builder
and architect now,"
Looking to the future, Sculley said he plans
to speak out about education as much as he
can. "Nothing can make as big a difference"
for the future as improving the minds of
young people, he said.

He also mentioned that he would like to
make education an important issue during the
1988 elections.
Sculley said "Odyssey" was inspired by
his hope for the future. "Rather than writing
business memoirs looking back," Sculley
said, "I wanted to write a story about things
that I think people could do right now that
could change the world while I am still
around."
Sculley s appearance at the Bookstore was
part of an extensive promotional tour for his
book, which will include a television spot on
the Today Show and other high-exposure
publicity efforts.
But Sculley said his decision to make an
appearance at Stanford stemmed more from
his personal commitment to the University
than from business concerns. Sculley cur
rently serves on the Graduate School of Busi
ness Advisory Board.
