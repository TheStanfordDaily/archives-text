Junior Ileana Vasu broke
several ankle bones and
cracked her pelvis after
losing control of her car on
the way home to Santa Bar
bara Friday night, accord
ing to her sister Mary Vasu,
a freshman.
Ileana remains in stable
condition at Cottage Hospi
tal in Santa Barbara, where
she was taken after she
swerved off the road and hit
the center divider while
driving south on U.S. 101 at
about 9 p.m. Friday.
"She was really tired,
and her car went off the
road," said Mary, who ex
plained that Ileana had
pulled off the road for a half
an hour before trying to
complete the drive home.
"The car rolled over a
couple of times, and she
was unconscious when she
was found," said Mary,
who lives in Casa Zapata.
Ileana, a resident of
Cedro who recently
declared a mathematics
major, was traveling home
for the weekend. Her sister
was following her in a dif
ferent car. According to
Mary, the two sisters had
intended to return to Stan
ford in a single vehicle.
"She can't roll over, and
the doctors said that it will
be at least two or three
weeks before she can return
to school, but she might not
make it back this quarter,"
Mary said.
"She wants me to send
her notes from her clas
ses," Mary added.
The accident was first re
ported Saturday in the
Santa Barbara News Press,
but the specifics of lleana's
injuries were not available
until yesterday.
