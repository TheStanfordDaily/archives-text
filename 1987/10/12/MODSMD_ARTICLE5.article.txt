## Boskin could lead Reagan's economic council 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
The White House announced
Saturday that Stanford Econom
ics Prof. Michael Boskin is the
leading candidate for an upcom
ing appointment to chairman of
President Reagan's Council of
Economic Advisers.
Boskin, who spent last Friday
meeting with top administration
officials in Washington, said it
was too soon to say whether, if
offered the post, he would ac
cept. But he added that "it would
be a difficult job to turn down."
If appointed by Reagan and
confirmed by the Senate, Boskin
will fill the vacancy that will be
created when present chairman

Beryl Sprinkel steps down at the
end of November.
"My economic policy is
broadly consistent with that of
the present council, and 1 sup
port President Reagan's econom
ics wholeheartedly," Boskin
said.
According to an article appear
ing in The New York Times on
Saturday, Boskin has been the
only person interviewed for the
position.
Boskin, 42, said he did not
know if any other candidates had
been interviewed, but expected
that the White House would
search internally among present
government economists and in
other sectors of the economics

community for possible appoin
tees.
According to Boskin, a deci
sion is expected from the White
House "in a couple of weeks.
A registered Republican, Bos
kin has on several occasions
acted as an adviser to President
Reagan, Treasury Secretary
James Baker and many members
of Congress.
Boskin said he has advised
government officials of both par
ties, wherever his advice has
been solicited.
"Quite independent of political
service, public service is one of
the highest duties of a citizen,
and I am excited by the possibil
ity," he said.
Boskin said he was ap
proached for presidential ap
pointments in 1981 and 1985 but
declined both times for personal
reasons.
A microeconomist, Boskin is
largely concerned with what he
describes as reliance on the
private sector and opposition to
massive government programs.
According to Economics Prof.
Ken Arrow, Boskin's interests
are directly related to issues
about tax policy regulation and
incentives.

"He is well-qualified as an
economist for the position," Ar
row said. " The difficulty will be
in stimulating people and ideas
and manuevering through an
tagonistic situations on a council
that has been subordinated
during the Reagan administra
tion."
" I think he possesses the
skills to do that," Arrow said.
Boskin, who is currently
teaching Introductory Econom
ics, said that even if he were ap
pointed and confirmed, the new
job would not begin until Decem
ber. Therefore, it would not in
terfere with his coursework this
quarter, he said.
Boskin's wife, Chris, is an ad
vertising executive in San
Francsco.
