# Scientist predicts rapid advance
## AIDS vaccine called likely 
### Kathy Lachenauer Staff writer 
Stanford Medical School Prof.
Hugh McDevitt predicted Friday
that within 10 years scientists
will develop a vaccine to prevent
the AIDS virus from infecting
those not previously exposed to
the disease.
Speaking at a San Francisco
symposium honoring the 100 th
year of the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), a federal agency
that is the world's largest sup
porter of biomedical research,
McDevitt's statements stirred his
listeners from a lull created by
the fact-packed biotechnological
presentations made earlier that
afternoon.
According to McDevitt, "If re
search of the last 10 years contin
ues at the same rate for the next
10," the scientific community
will be able to stop the spread of
the disease or even eliminate it
altogether.
The AIDS virus attacks and
eliminates special helper T-cells
needed by the immune system
for recognizing foreign proteins,
viruses and bacteria that can
cause infection, explained
McDevitt, a microbiologist who
has concentrated his work on the
molecular basis for genetic differ
ences in the immune response to
foreign proteins.

How the AIDS virus
eliminates helper T-cells is still
not very clear, McDevitt said,
adding that many other questions
concerning the virus' complex
mechanisms still leave research
ers baffled.
Despite the unanswered ques

tions, AIDS researchers will
develop a "polyvalent vaccine"
composed of complex protein
groups that will eliminate the
AIDS virus in those already in
fected, McDevitt predicted.
