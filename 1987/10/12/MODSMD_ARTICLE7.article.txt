# Animal rights groups assailed

In perhaps his strongest
remarks on the subject to date.
University President Donald
Kennedy attacked animal rights
activists in a speech Friday night,
labeling their political activism a
threat to the future of scientific
research.
"These new attitudes, even
more than the adequacy and the
stability of research support, are
the enemies of scientific re
search," Kennedy said at the
centennial dinner of the National
Institutes of Health in San Fran
cisco.
Kennedy attributed the lack of
public support for animal re
search to "ignorance and fear of
science itself and of the institu
tions in which it is done.
"At Stanford various mam
mals — mostly genetic strains of
several rodent species — are es
sential for research on the

immune system, cancer genetics,
developmental biology and
various inherited diseases of
childhood," Kennedy said.
He said that animal activists
are able to influence public
opinion more on the basis of their
organization and visibilty than
the merits of their cause.
"Animal lovers come together
more easily than the parents of
cystic fibrosis children, who are
busy caring for their youngsters
and supporting research efforts,"
he said. "They are strong adv
ocates, but only after they recog
nize the threat."
Kennedy questioned the sin
cerity of many animal activists,
who claim their main concern is
that some of the animals used for
research may be suitable pets.
Kennedy was also skeptical
about the claims of animal rights
activists who say they want more
humane care for laboratory
animals then block construction
efforts to that effect.
He pointed to an incident
which occurred this summer at
Stanford, in which the construc
tion of a state-of-the-art animal
research facility was delayed be
cause of opposition by a coalition
headed by the Palo Alto Humane
Society.
"The movement says it wants
better housing and treatment of
animals yet does its best to
prevent construction of facilities
that will provide them." Ken
nedy said. "Not only here, but at
the University of California and
elsewhere.
"When you think they sound
moderate, you want to watch
what they do," he added.

In addition to the activist
movement, Kennedy identified
pork-barreling of research funds
and the indirect costs that inves
tigators incur as two other
threats to the well-being of future
research efforts.
"Neither of these things
should be happening." he said.
"Instead, the universities' ca
pacity to support scientific work
should be shored up — by direct
government support for building
and equipment, and by the pay
ment of full audited indirect as
well as direct costs of doing
sponsored research."
Two common forms of indirect
costs are upkeep of a research fa
cility and upgrading the labora
tory equipment to improve the
quality of experiments.
Pork-barreling, a process by
which research grants are given
directly to an institution instead
of going through the normal
channels of competitive review.

jeopardizes the integrity of re
search because it does not guar
antee that money will fall into the
hands of the most capable inves
tigator, Kennedy said.
"The woeful state of capital
facilities and the absence of any
orderly program to address this
clearly identified and well
documented problem has led to
direct appropriations — or set
asides — for specific facilities
projects, based not on compara
tive peer assessments of merit
but on political imperatives," he
said.
"We can now buy mediocrity
at the expense of excellence," he
added.
"All this adds up to consider
able squeeze on the investigator,
who is likely to be funded for a
relatively short time, funded for
less than the approved budget
and working within an infrastruc
ture that has gradually fallen into
disrepair," he said.

tion of a state-of-the-art animal
research facility was delayed be
cause of opposition by a coalition
headed by the Palo Alto Humane
Society.
"The movement says it wants
better housing and treatment of
animals yet does its best to
prevent construction of facilities
that will provide them." Ken
nedy said. "Not only here, but at
the University of California and
elsewhere.
"When you think they sound
moderate, you want to watch
what they do," he added.

In addition to the activist
movement, Kennedy identified
pork-barreling of research funds
and the indirect costs that inves
tigators incur as two other
threats to the well-being of future
research efforts.
"Neither of these things
should be happening." he said.
"Instead, the universities' ca
pacity to support scientific work
should be shored up — by direct
government support for building
and equipment, and by the pay
ment of full audited indirect as
well as direct costs of doing
sponsored research."
Two common forms of indirect
costs are upkeep of a research fa
cility and upgrading the labora
tory equipment to improve the
quality of experiments.
Pork-barreling, a process by
which research grants are given
directly to an institution instead
of going through the normal
channels of competitive review.

jeopardizes the integrity of re
search because it does not guar
antee that money will fall into the
hands of the most capable inves
tigator, Kennedy said.
"The woeful state of capital
facilities and the absence of any
orderly program to address this
clearly identified and well
documented problem has led to
direct appropriations — or set
asides — for specific facilities
projects, based not on compara
tive peer assessments of merit
but on political imperatives," he
said.
"We can now buy mediocrity
at the expense of excellence," he
added.
"All this adds up to consider
able squeeze on the investigator,
who is likely to be funded for a
relatively short time, funded for
less than the approved budget
and working within an infrastruc
ture that has gradually fallen into
disrepair," he said.
