In perhaps his strongest
remarks on the subject to date.
University President Donald
Kennedy attacked animal rights
activists in a speech Friday night,
labeling their political activism a
threat to the future of scientific
research.
"These new attitudes, even
more than the adequacy and the
stability of research support, are
the enemies of scientific re
search," Kennedy said at the
centennial dinner of the National
Institutes of Health in San Fran
cisco.
Kennedy attributed the lack of
public support for animal re
search to "ignorance and fear of
science itself and of the institu
tions in which it is done.
"At Stanford various mam
mals — mostly genetic strains of
several rodent species — are es
sential for research on the

immune system, cancer genetics,
developmental biology and
various inherited diseases of
childhood," Kennedy said.
He said that animal activists
are able to influence public
opinion more on the basis of their
organization and visibilty than
the merits of their cause.
"Animal lovers come together
more easily than the parents of
cystic fibrosis children, who are
busy caring for their youngsters
and supporting research efforts,"
he said. "They are strong adv
ocates, but only after they recog
nize the threat."
Kennedy questioned the sin
cerity of many animal activists,
who claim their main concern is
that some of the animals used for
research may be suitable pets.
Kennedy was also skeptical
about the claims of animal rights
activists who say they want more
