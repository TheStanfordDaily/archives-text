# Japanese scholarship fund created
## 
### Mike MacCrystall 
A new scholarship fund for Japanese and
Japanese-American students has been established
at Stanford with some very old money.
When the United States began to place Japanese-
Americans into internment camps in 1942, Stan
ford's Japanese Student Association was forced to
close. In August of this year, the group's original
$6000 and 42 years of accrued interest resurfaced,
and the $27,500 was donated to the Financial Aids
Office in the form of a scholarship fund.
For over four decades the funds of the defunct or
ganization were in the care of Yoshio Okumoto,
Class of 1928, a former member of the organization
and the live-in caretaker of the Japanese Student
Association House. He handled the S6(KK) fund and
the group's belongings as a favor to the organization
even while he was interned at the Heart Mountain
Relocation Center in Wyoming.
When Okumoto returned to Stanford in 1945, in
sufficient interest in the Japanese Student Associa
tion prompted him to store the house's many relics.
He said he continued to tend the interest-bearing
account but was unable to put the assets to use
since he was not an elected official of the organiza
tion.
According to Okumoto, members of the pre-war
Japanese Student Association got together in 19K5
for a post-Big Game dinner party here. The issue of
the dormant bank account was raised, and
Okumoto suggested the money be given to Stan-
ford. With the legal help of Fred
Hartwick, associate director of
the Office of Development, the
scholarship fund was estab
lished.
Inouye Hirouske, also a
former member of the associa
tion, explained that "since the
organization was originally at
Stanford, we thought it would be

best to give the money back to
Stanford."
Ann Bilodeau, director of the
University's Annual Fund, called
the unsolicited donation a boost
for the Centennial Campaign,
which aims to raise $40 million
for financial aid by 1991.
In the Centennial Campaign as
a whole, which is timed to mark
Stanford's 100 th anniversary, the
University is seeking to raise
$1.1 billion over six years, the
largest fund-raising effort ever
undertaken by an American uni
versity.

Over the years, Okumoto has
had to explain his complicated
story on several occasions to
various bank and state officials.
Seven years ago he went to the
State of California to request the
return of the money, which had
been given to the state after a
bank teller had deemed the ac
count "dead."
But Okumoto is humble about
his role in donating the money to
the University.
"I just wanted to be relieved of
the responsibility," he said.
"Now I can die in peace."
