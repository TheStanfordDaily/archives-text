### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees today will likely ap
prove the construction of new art studios in the
Stanford Foothills and the divestment of stock in
three companies with holdings in South Africa,
board members said yesterday.
Members of the board discussed their plans
and listened to student concerns during informal
meetings with students last night in University
residences.
The 33-member board met earlier in the day to
discuss University policies on investment, land
management and academic growth.
If the art facility plan is approved, a cluster of
one-story studios will be built in the Foothills ad
jacent to the Stanford golf course, the National
Bureau for Academic Research and the Center

for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.
Newly elected trustee Herb Dwight, a mem
ber of the trustees' Special Committee on In
vestment Responsibility, told students at Toyon
that Stanford intends to divest from three com
panies with South African holdings that, in the
University's opinion, have not made an effort to
effect social change in that country.
The University will announce all of the
board's decisions today. Board members
declined to provide more details of the divest
ment plan last night.
Trustee Diane Geocaris, speaking to students
at La Casa Italiana, said that schematic drawings
of a Westin Hotel to be built on Stanford land off
Sand Hill Road will be submitted to the board
within 30 days. Plans for the hotel must be ap-

before construction can begin.
The board also votes today on
plans to modify Tresidder Union
and improve the University's
recreational athletic facilities,
Geocaris said.
The trustees yesterday also ex
plored plans for construction of a
biological studies building in the
Near West Campus and a com

Geocaris noted that funds
generated by the Centennial

Campaign were being used par
tially to "continue strong empha
sis on humanities and social
sciences" in the form of
endowed professorships and bet
ter library resources.
"The push for humanities and
social sciences accompanies the
physical growth in the sciences in
renewing the board's commit
ment to undergraduate educa
tion," she said.
Three-year trustee Vernon An
derson explained the overall op
eration of the board to students
at Hurlburt, citing student feed
back as one of the board"s most
valuable attributes.
"They lend an instrumental
credibility to decision-making,"
he said.
