# Rep. anticipates â€˜generational change'
## 
### Scott Renshaw 
Predicting an upcoming shift
in American politics. Demo
cratic Rep. James Jones of
Oklahoma told students last
night to prepare for a period of
"generational change" similar
to that of the 19605.
Jones, a former special assis
tant to the White House chief of
staff under President Lyndon
Johnson, urged the next genera
tion of voters to look for presi
dential candidates with an
"honest approach to the is
sues." Speaking at a meeting of
the Stanford Democrats, he
also addressed economic and
foreign policy issues.
Jones opened his remarks by
saying that the period American
politics are about to enter will
be similar to that of the adminis
tration of John Kennedy, with
new leadership paying attention
to "substance and ideas," as
opposed to President Reagan's
"feel-good politics." He said
student involvement will be es
sential to this change.
Jones, chair of the House
Budget Committee from 1981-
85, also said that the Reagan ad
ministration's economic poli
cies had created the threat of a
recession.
"We don't have a range of
options to lessen the downturn
in the economy," Jones said,

adding that the next downturn
could be "very, very deep."
Jones said he believed a IX*mo
cratic candidate would be
"more able to deal with such a
downturn."
Jones also addressed the
issue of the federal budget defi
cit, saying, "Yes, we could get
out of [the deficit], but only in a
bipartisan way."
"Somebody is going to have
to say, 'Yes, we need to raise
taxes,' " Jones said, noting that
such an admission would re
quire that both parties work to
gether.
"No political party is going to
get out on that limb and let the
other party chop it off," he
said.
Jones added that he did not
anticipate a significant
downturn in the economy in the
near future. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan is
very aware of fluctuations in
the economy, Jones said. "He
may tighten down (on the
money supply) in spring," with
a subsequent loosening of the
money supply about election
time in 1988.
Jones also discussed U.S.
policy toward Nicaragua, ur
ging the next administration to
"convey an attitude of support
for a region- wide peace plan."
In answer to a student's ques
tion about Reagan's commit

ment to the Nicaraguan rebels,
Jones said "He has the in
stinctive sense of timing of a
labor negotiator," but is
"simply stubborn" on certain
Nicaraguan issues.

When the discussion was
briefly disturbed by a group in a
nearby meeting room singing
"Amazing Grace," Jones joked
with the audience, asking, "Is
Pat Robertson holding a rally?"
