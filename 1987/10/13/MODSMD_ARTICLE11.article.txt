# COP member calls meeting with women
## 
### David kazanjian 
Council of Presidents member
Maria Canas will meet this after
noon with a group of Stanford ad
ministrators and students active
in women's issues to explore
ways of increasing communica
tion among campus women's
groups.
"The various groups in the
women's community each have
their own goals," said
Canas,"but often they don't
know what each other are
doing."
Canas used as an example the
Rape Education Project's invita
tion of Gloria Steinem to speak
on campus. "If there were a good
network, maybe the Speakers
Bureau could have helped REP
to get her."
Among those who will attend
the meeting are representatives
of the Graduate Women's Net
work, the Intersorority Council,
the Speakers Bureau, the
Women's Center, the Rape Edu
cation Project, SURE escort ser
vice, English Prof. Adrienne
Rich, Feminist Studies Chair
Diane Middlebrook and Dean of
Admissions Jean Fetter.
Canas said the woman's com
munity has great potential to
cooperate in sharing ideas and
meeting goals. "I don't just want
us to embrace each other as a

happy family, I want us to work
together constructively," she
said.
"When I came to Stanford,"
Canas continued, "I was in
volved in REP, and I felt it was
so far away from everything, like
it was peripheral. Just because
there are differences (among the
groups), that doesn't mean we
can't work together."
Canas said she felt strongly
that groups should maintain their
individuality. "I will not attempt
to speak for all women," she
said, emphasizing the need for a
forum to pool ideas and con
cerns.
Elaborating on her hopes for
this meeting, Canas said she did
not want it to be "too political."
"When I say building a
stronger community,' I don't
mean making it so political and
so theoretical," she said.
"Anyone can sit around and
theorize. I would rather see solid
programs and projects come out
of this, something concrete that
you can grab onto. I want it to be
practical networking."
Canas also said she felt that
making the meeting "too politi
cal" would alienate some people.
"If people don't want to take a
political stand, at least they can
make contacts."
