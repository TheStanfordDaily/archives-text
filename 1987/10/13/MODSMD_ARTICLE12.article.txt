Both the Athletic Department and the Univer
sity as a whole should be commended for their
role in challenging the NCAA drug-testing pro
gram.
A hearing is scheduled for today in Santa
Clara County Superior Court to determine
whether the NCAA should preliminarily be
prohibited from conducting drug tests of Stan
ford student athletes pending the outcome of a
suit filed by Stanford athletes Jennifer Hill and
Barry McKeever with the assistance of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
The University entered into the suit in July,
ostensibly to ensure that it would not be a party
to illegal activity in the event the NCAA drug
testing requirements were found by the courts to
violate the California constitution.
The University's position has not been merely
one of self-interest, however.
Rather, members of the University adminis
tration, such as Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
have repeatedly and publicly stated their princi
pled opposition to NCAA drug testing.
Mandatory drug testing is degrading and fun

damentally intrusive. Although the U.S. Consti
tution provides no privacy protection in this case
because the NCAA is not a government body,
California's constitution does contain a right to
privacy applicable to non-governmental groups
such as the NCAA.
If NCAA drug testing is found to violate the
California constitution, all student athletes in
California will benefit, and the NCAA drug
testing program nationally will be seriously, per
haps fatally, compromised by the existence of a
legal exception for California student athletes.
Stanford students have been at the forefront of
the battle against the NCAA. Former Stanford
diver Simone LeVant won a preliminary injunc
tion for herself last spring in the nation's first
challenge of collegiate drug testing before her
case was rendered moot by her graduation.
The University was behind LeVant at that
time, and it continues to support its students in
their fight to vindicate a basic civil liberty. In
doing so the University has provided a lesson in
community service by example of which we can
all be proud.
