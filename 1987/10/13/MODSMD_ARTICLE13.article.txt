Daily neglects
black diversity
I feel compelled to congratu
late President Kennedy on his in
spirational words to the incoming
freshmen Sept. 25 (Daily, Oct.
7). According to Kennedy, "one
of Stanford's greatest strengths is
its multiracial and multicultural
society." To deliberately refuse
to "explore" racial differences is
"too common" in our commu
nity.
The Daily, for instance, does
not see the importance in Ken
nedy's words. I say this because
last year The Daily seemed to be
biased in deciding which stories
to cover. Last year, The Daily
covered most of the popular
campus events, but somehow
iphored one of the bigge&t ex
tffivaganzas of the yearj .Club
Ujamaa. Close to 4006 people
(mostly students) attended this
grand event last January, yet our
beloved Daily has not seen fit to
cover this affair for the last four
years.
Stanfunk, a yearly talent show
organized by members of the
black community, is another
event overlooked by The Daily.
Stanfunk celebrated its ninth
year last spring. With show
stopping performances by the
Mendicants, some tappers and
some rappers, Stanfunk had its
audience rocking for hours.
Yes, I know that it seems out
rageous that The Daily would
ignore the hard work done by
members of its community, but it
seems unbelievable to me that

nothing has been done about this
for so long.

Dorm Bible study
is mind-opening
I found Leslie Kaufman's
viewpoint claiming that "Bible
studies alienate" quite alarming
yet very informative. It is a
shame that an activity that has
added a great deal to my educa
tion at Stanford, and my life as a
whole, has made such a bad im
pression on her.
I'd first like to refute the idea
that "Bible studies only serve to
create strains of isolation and re
ligious competitiveness or close
mindedness." I wonder if it's the
act of having a Bible study or
more likely the people in, or
outside, the Bible study that
creates the isolation she men
tions.
I've always found Bible
studies very mind-opening.
When people stop studying and
allow others to study for them,
and interpret for them, the
results can be quite dangerous. I
encourage anyone who would
question a religious idea, act or
authority to take their questions
to the scriptures and not rely on
people alone for the answers.
As far as religion goes, any
Christian will tell you Christian
ity is not a religion but a relation
ship â€” a way of life. It is a daily
walk with God and cannot pos
sibly be reserved to a church or
temple on Sundays only. The

purpose of many Bible studies is
to encourage and care for one an
other and learn more about God,
which is exactly what the Bible
tells us to do.
Also, finding a place to meet
outside of a dorm is easier said
than done. To reserve a space
with the University requires that
a group be an official club of the
ASSU, which is a hassle in itself
and not possible for a group of
two or three people.
I doubt that Kaufman's
frustrations with Bible studies
and with being in a "Christian
dorm" have much to do with the
fact that a Bible study met in a
room in her dorm. They probably
have more to do with her rela
tionships with the people in the
study and with the people outside
the dorm branding her dorm as
"Christian."
Yet, I would like to thank her
for bringing to light conditions
which many Christians may be
unaware of or ignoring. 1 implore
Christians to please be con
siderate of others around you.
Never look down on someone for
not coming to a study, always
show that your care for them
does not depend on their actions,
realize that there is no such thing
as a good Christian or a bad one
and always encourage those with
different views to attend Bible
studies.
Finally, I'd like to ask anyone
who is having problems with Bi
ble studies to bring it to the atten
tion of those in charge of the
study. Christians are usually
quite accommodating.
