## Bible groups open to all 
### 
After reading Leslie Kaufman's viewpoint in last
Wednesday's Daily, I wanted to offer a slightly dif
ferent slant on the role of Bible studies in dorms.
Kaufman objects to them on the basis that they
are unhealthy for dorm interaction. Even if this
were true, it sets an undesirable precedent for de
ciding what will go on in the dorms. If "potential to
divide a community" is used as a criterion for al
lowing activities or events in the dorms, it will
become difficult to justify many of the interesting
political forums and debates that go on there.
Taken to its logical extreme, this view suggests
that we do nothing when there is a chance that we

might disagree. A community that counts on lack of
disagreements, rather than working through issues
together in order to achieve community, seems
pretty bland.
I agree that dorm unity can be affected by the
presence of many Christians in one dorm.
However, I don't believe the responsibility for divi
sion or feelings of alienation lies solely with the
people involved in a Bible study. And certainly the
solution to this problem is not to move the Bible
studies out of the dorms.
More likely, both those involved and those not
involved are guilty of misperceptions. People in
volved in a Bible study might tend to spend a lot of
time together, as would people involved in Ram's
Head or people who have spent a quarter together
overseas. But somehow this group of friends is per
ceived as less approachable. Perhaps this stems
from misunderstandings of what goes on in these
Bible studies.
Certainly, if the studies were like what the author
of the viewpoint described, they wouldn't appeal to
me very much, either. She stated that Bible study
groups meet in order to "discuss the Bible and con
firm their faith," also that these groups "alienate
people of other faiths because, unlike a discussion
where members of non-Christian faiths may partici
pate and be respected, during Bible studies the
Christian faith is confirmed and extolled in its
righteousness."
Having been involved in dorm Bible studies with
inter-varsity Christian Fellowship for three years
now, I find this description to be quite foreign to
what I have experienced. The idea of "confirming
faith" conjures up images for me of a group of

people shutting themselves off from the world and
its nagging problems and issues, trying to convince
each other that this approach to life is "righteous"
and actively seeking to squelch all outside influen
ces that might penetrate their closed and frightened
world view.
This is not at all an accurate picture of the inter
action within a dorm Bible study. Instead, I have
found that people in them are willing to face prob
lems and grapple with real life issues.
Neither can I identify with the idea of a group
that disrespects and discourages participation from
people of other faiths. Admittedly, we are studying
the Bible, not the Koran. But our purpose is not to
explore world religions.
Rather, we want to take a look at who Jesus is,
what he said and what he did. Why did he make
such extravagant and egotistical claims about him
self? Yet he is still acclaimed as a great moral
teacher or as a genuinely nice guy. Which is true?
What is he about?
So, if our purpose is to look at Jesus Christ, see if
he has anything relevant to say to us and, if so, to
respond, probably the best thing to do is to study
the Bible.
In the studies I've been involved with, no one
leader dictates "this is the way it is"; rather, the
approach is to ask "what do you think the passage
is saying?" Everyone's input is welcomed and ap
preciated, regardless of religious affiliation. Proba
bly the times I've er\joyed the most and learned the
most have been when people who don't agree
speak their minds instead of assuming that no one
wants to hear a disagreement.
The suggestion to move the Bible studies out of
the dorms would only compound the alienation
problem. The people involved in a study would
spend a lot more time away from the dorm, and
those who wanted to check out what was happen
ing by going to one or two meetings would probably
never make it, increasing the division in the dorm.
One reason the studies meet in dorms is so that
people can get to know each other on many differ
ent levels at the same time. Also, eliminating Bible
studies from dorms would send the signal that
talking about beliefs and religious ideas is a taboo
subject inside the dorms, the very setting in which
beliefs should be discussed, questioned, challenged
and acted on.
It will not serve the dorms to remove the Bible
studies. What will serve the dorms is more open
discussion to reduce misperceptions on both sides.
