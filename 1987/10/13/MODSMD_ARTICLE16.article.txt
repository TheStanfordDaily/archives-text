# Coping with cultural schizophrenia
## 
### 
Ever watched "Kung Fu"?
It's an old TV series about a priest from
China who wanders around America's Old
West, looking for his half-brother. This dude
knows some pretty nasty chop-socky. Most
of the time he tries not to fight, but invariably
someone or something forces him to use his
kung fu moves.
Of course, situations like these are not ne
cessary to keep viewers from switching the
channel, but in this case they do provide
some pretty good entertainment.

That's not the reason I like "Kung Fu" so
much, however. I'm attracted to it because it
also deals with a problem that rarely receives
much attention, but that many, many people
face. You can't avoid it because you're born
with it; and if you don't learn how to handle
it, it can drive you crazy.
It's being a "half-breed."
You see, the main character in "Kung
Fu," Kwai Chang Caine, is only half
Chinese. His father is American. Even
though he isn't a true Chinaman, people treat
him like one, which means they often misun
derstand him, degrade him or discriminate
against him. The plight of those with hybrid
heritages is so rarely represented on the
screen that shows such as "Kung Fu" and
"Star Trek" stand out. That's why Kwai
Chang and Mr. Spock are two of my favorite
TV characters. Like me, they're half-breeds.
Nearly everyone encounters some diffi
culty relating to, and eventually feeling com
fortable with, his or her ethnic background.

Most people here either explore and retain
some of their own cultural heritage or chuck
it all and become full-blown Americans, god
dammit. But when your parents come from
two single, radically different ethnic back
grounds, the search for cultural identity is
much harder. Whether you're mulatto, half
Hispanic or half Asian, like me, you've got to
strike a comfortable balance between both
your backgrounds. And sometimes it ain't
easy.
Half-breeds face all sorts of annoying prob
lems. Take college applications, for example.
If you're half white and half Mexican, what
should you check under "ethnic group?"
Hispanic? Caucasian? Does your background
qualify you as a member of a minority group
or not?
My own parents are Danish and Chinese,
so I guess that makes me Eurasian, but the
applications never seemed to have a box for
that. Most of the time I checked "Asian
American'' because I didn't consider myself
to be full Caucasian, but then I started receiv
ing all sorts of information about opportuni
ties for minorities. It took me a while to figure
out that I should just put "other" and leave it
at that. Maybe colleges could start adding
boxes that say, "Half-breed, OK? Don't
ask."
Or looks. If you're a true half-and-half, you
probably look a little different. If people can't
figure out what you are, they usually decide
for you. I still remember the first time anyone
ever called me "Chink." It was a little boy,
younger than me, and when he did it I was
shocked. Until then I hadn't realized that to
almost all of my classmates, I looked more
Chinese than Caucasian. Or the time I told a
curious classmate that I was half Danish: She
studied my face carefully and then declared,
"No you're not. You're Chinese." Oh. Hey,
just because I don't have blond hair or blue
eyes doesn't mean I can't be half white too.
Even everyday socializing, for me, can
sometimes be confusing. I feel such strong

pulls from both my heritages that sometimes 1
really feel out of place. Around Caucasian
people, I feel like I'm Chinese, and I think
sometimes both they and I subconsciously
act as if that's true.
But to most Chinese people, I'm stark
white. It's especially apparent in Chinatown.
My family has gone there for years, but we
still get funny looks. Even the waiters give us
knives and forks instead of chopsticks. If I
weren't so interested in the food, I'd be in
sulted.

If people can't figure out
what you are, they
usually decide for you.

Looking hack on all these gripes, heing a
half-hreed sounds pretty had, doesn't it? I
don't mean to say that it's a devastating, hor
rible affliction that will haunt you all of your
life and twist your every waking moment into
a living hell.
I just wish that the problems associated
with mixed parentage were more well
known, because they do exist. I can only
imagine how hard it must be for those who
are, say, half Asian and half black, or for i
children such as those born to Vietnamese
mothers and American fathers during the
Vietnam War. It's taken me awhile, but I've
accepted my own background, and I'm glad
I'm the way I am. I've had enough cultural
schizophrenia for now.
Then again, maybe I'll go watch
"Buckaroo Banzai" a few more times.
