# NCAA hearing opens
## Case may set precedent on drug-testing issue 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Hearings that may determine the fate of the
NCAA's drug-testing program begin this morning
in San Jose.
Backed up by the University, Stanford student
athletes Jennifer Hill and Barry McKeever will
seek a preliminary injunction against enforcement
of the drug-testing program on the grounds that it
violates athletes' right to privacy under the Calfior
nia constitution.
According to University attorneys, an injunction
might force the NCAA (National Collegiate Athle
tic Association) to scrap its year-old policy of test
ing college athletes for evidence of drug use.
Judge Conrad Rushing of the Santa Clara County
Superior Court will hear arguments today from at
torneys representing Hill and McKeever, Stanford
and the NCAA. According to University Counsel
Debra Zumwalt, who will present Stanford's case
in court, the hearings are expected to last three or
four days.
Rushing issued a temporary restraining order
Aug. 26 exempting Stanford student athletes from
signing consent forms submitting themselves to
random drug testing. The NCAA policy requires
consent to testing as a precondition for competing
in intercollegiate athletics.
The NCAA has consistently maintained that the

program is necessary in order to maintain fairness
in competition.
Stanford joined Hill and McKeever's case July
20 as a third party. "We're not a plaintiff; we're an
intervener," said Zumwalt, who emphasized that
the University and the students have different in
terests at stake in the case.
"If the program's constitutionality is upheld,
Stanford may be sanctioned if we don't enforce it,"
she said. "The individual students don't have that
kind of worry."
Zumwalt and attorney Susan Harriman, who will
argue for Hill and McKeever, said that the legal
strategy they are using against the NCAA hasn't
changed since March, when Simone LeVant, who
was then captain of the Stanford women's diving
team, won a preliminary injunction exempting her
from signing the drug test consent form.
"The legal arguments haven't changed," Har
riman said, "but the factual arguments are different
because we have different plaintiffs. The main dif
ference is that there will be live testimony."
Scheduled to testify for Stanford today are Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger and Paul Walters, direc
tor of the Cowell Student Health Center. Other wit
nesses for Stanford include Baseball Coach Mark
Marquess, Women's Soccer Coach Berhane An
derberhan. Women's Gymnastics Coach Homer
Sardina and Law Prof. Jack
Friendenthal, who is Stanford's
faculty representative to the
NCAA.
LeVant argued in March that
testing violated her right to
privacy, which is guaranteed in
the California constitution. But
because she graduated in June,
the diver's claim has since been
declared moot.
Hill, a senior and co-captain of

the women's soccer team, joined
LeVant's case in February.
McKeever, a senior linebacker
on the football team, added his
name to the case in July.
Geiger, who has been out
spoken in his attacks on drug
testing, said, "I'm not supportive
of the program. It's overbroad
and invasive of privacy."
"The court should not apply
the (drug-testing) program
selectively," Zumwalt added.
"If the program is judged uncon
stitutional, the NCAA will proba
bly take it back to [ its | members
and let them decide the next
course of action."
