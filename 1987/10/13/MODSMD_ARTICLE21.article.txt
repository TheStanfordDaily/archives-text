## It's a Bug Me He's trashing terminals and tipping cows for you 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
Dear Bug Me,
I am in LOTS 11. Even as I
write, I am stricken with im
mense hunger, yet I cannot so
much as nibble a Snickers or
sip a Coke without incurring
the wrath of the Great Thump-

ing LOTS SOARcrs. Eating is
encouraged at Sweet Hall, and
I have never been interrupted
whilst enjoying a Hostess
Cupcake at Terman. So why
are we not allowed to eat or
drink at LOTS 11, but permited
to everywhere else?
—Wonderduck
Let me get this straight. Do
you mean to say that you are
such a computer nerd that you
can't even take Jive minutes off
from the terminal to go scarf a

Snickers? If you really feel a
primal need to eat a four
course candlelit dinner while
programming in Pascal, per
haps you need to do a little
reassessment of your life.
But here's the deal. Duck.
Sweet Hall houses those nifty
little Zenith terminals that cost
the LOTS folks 100 bucks
apiece to replace. Eating and
drinking is actually against the
rules at Sweet, but it would
cost them more to hire people
to enforce the rule than to just
replace one or two terminals a
year when they get chicken
soup poured on the keyboard.
LOTS 11, by contrast, has
those rockin' IBM compatibles
that cost roughly $10,000 each.
If you want to drop some Jello
pudding onto one of those
babies, it'll be the most expen
sive dessert you've ever had.
Hence, they have asked the
Tresidder SOAR folks to en
force the no food and drink
laws as if their lives depended
on it.
Terman ain't run by LOTS,
so they make their own rules.
However, if you sit down at a
PC with an RC, chances are
they'll take you out back and
shoot you.
Dear Bug Me,
While walking the Dish ear
lier this week, I noticed the J'a

mous Foothills con s did not
yet appear to be in residence.
Do they get a summer break,
too? Who do the cows belong
to, anyway, since they graze on
Stanford property? Are they
registered as tuition-paying
students? Can I take mine
home with me? {And can I pick
it out or is one already as
signed to me?)
-Non-'' Wilbur Vealbird' -eater
Geez, what's your beef?
After I herd this question I
decided to take the bull by the
horns and steer you toward an
answer. Figuring that I had
nothing at steak, I called the
Stanford Real Estate Division
and milked them for answers.
They said that for 50 years the
Roger Piers Farm has leased
1750 acres of land from Stan
ford for raising cattle. Piers'
weaned calves come from
Texas, Oregon and Montana to
winter here and fatten up.
Unfortunately, last year's
cows couldn't hide, and now
they are helping out at Food
Service; and I don't mean has
hing.
No, you can't have a cow. If
you decide to take one, you
will have to meat the police.
And 1 know you wouldn't want
to call your dad and tell him to
send $1000 to bail you out of
jail for rustling.
