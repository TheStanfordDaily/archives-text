## Rain forest destruction endangers ecosystem 
### Lisa Mendel 
"The destruction of the rain forests is
the greatest biological disaster we've
ever experienced," Denise Voelker of
the Rain Forest Action Network told a
local audience last week. "It is rivaling
the extinction of the dinosaurs in terms
of the numbers of animals and plants be
coming extinct."
In a slide presentation last Wednesday
at the Peninsula Conservation Center in
Palo Alto, Voelker warned that the
world's rain forests are being destroyed
at a rate of 50 acres per minute. If this
rate of destruction continues, she said,
all rain forests and their complex biosys
tems will have disappeared by the year
2050. Already, over half the world's
tropical rain forests have been lost. Most
of this rain forest destruction occurred
after World War 11, she said.
Voelker explained that people chop
down rain forest trees for wood or burn
them to clear the land for agriculture or
for construction of dams for hydro
electric power systems.
The world's rain forests, at present,
cover 2 percent of the Earth's surface,
an area about the size of the contiguous
United States. They contain about 50
percent of all living species and are esti
mated to be an invaluable component of
the global ecosystem, Voelker said.
Species destruction in rain forests is
more severe than in temperate forests.
Twenty acres in a rain forest typically
houses up to 240 different species, while
an equal space in a temperate forest con
tains only about 20 species. Thus,
Voelker said, destroying 20 acres of for
est inevitably kills unique species.
The world's rain forests remain so
biologically diverse because evolution
ary processes have continued undis
turbed there until very recently.
Voelker suggested that the rain
forests' most important role in the world
ecosystem is acting as "oxygen
supplying lungs to the Earth." Plants
take up carbon dioxide and water from

the atmosphere for food and release
oxygen. Some believe the rain forests
are vital for maintaining the balance be
tween oxygen and carbon dioxide on
Earth.
Voelker said that destroying the rain
forests contributes to the "greenhouse
effect", or the gradual warming of the
Earth's atmosphere. Large scale burning
of rain forest biomass releases large
amounts of carbon, which increase the
concentration of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere. The carbon blanket then
blocks the exit of heat energy from the
earth's atmosphere, Voelker explained.
Rain forest destruction also contri
butes to the greenhouse effect in a
second way, Voelker said. When the
canopy of the rain forest is removed,
sunlight is reflected back to the sky and
so additional energy is trapped by the
carbon blanket. The end result is a
gradual warming of the Earth's tempera
ture and removal of moisture from the
atmosphere.
Voelker said that such changes have
already been detected in the micro
climates of some deforested areas.
"Hypothetically," she qualified, "the
global effect could be catastrophic for
human beings."
Rain forests prevent erosion and
floods and also protect supplies of fresh
water. Because the soil of the rain forest
is too thin to retain water, Voelker said,
the dense forest canopy plays an impor
tant role in that it filters falling rain,
keeping it from rushing all at once into
the rivers.
In recently deforested rain forest
areas, Voelker said, there is drought at
certain times during the year. Drought
and erosion have become particular
problems in deforested rain forest areas
near urban centers, she said.
Clearing the rain forests also means
destroying the homelands of millions of
indigenous people, Voelker said. She
related an incident in which a tribe in
Borneo, after failing through legal
measures to keep loggers off their land.

gathered hundreds of thousands of its
people to block the paths of lumber
trucks. They also brought in the press,
thus keeping the military from forcing
them off the land and into camps.
Voelker said she hopes the logging proj
ect in Borneo will be abandoned.
Voelker added that many rain forest
plants are the ancestors of such common
foods as corn, rice, bananas, citrus
fruits, coffee and peanuts. Calling the
rain forest a "food storehouse," Voelker
pointed out that the splicing of a rain for
est plant with common rice recently
saved the rice crops of southern Asia
from a blight.
Rain forest plants are also sources of
both common medicines and cures, most
of which are known only to the in
digenous peoples, Voelker said. The long
period of evolution of rain forest plant
species has enabled them to develop es

pecially strong immune structures. Ac
cording to Voelker, alkaloid drugs
derived from the rain forest's rosy
periwinkle, for example, have raised the
chance of survival for children suffering
from leukemia from 20 percent to 80 per
cent.
Voelker warned that many of these
plants remain unstudied and that many
unknown plants are being destroyed
before they can be discovered and iden
tified.
It is large Western corporations in
search of short-term economic gain that
are most responsible for this mass
destruction, Voelker argued.
The World Bank is the largest sup
porter of projects causing widespread
deforestation, Voelker said.
More than a quarter of Central Ameri
can rain forests have been destroyed and
converted to pasturelands, Voelker said.

About 90 percent of the beef raised on
these converted lands becomes U.S.
hamburgers, she said.
After about five to 10 years of grazing,
Voelker said, an area becomes com
pletely depleted of nutrients and farmers
move further into the rain forest.
In August, Voelker said. Burger King
cancelled a $70 million contract with
Costa Rica that would have supplied the
corporation with beef for one year; she
credited this action to public pressure.
The Rain Forest Action Network,
Voelker explained, uses direct action to
inform the public and to attempt to
prevent rain forest destruction. The
group's actions include public educa
tion, letter-writing campaigns, boycotts
and conferences.
The Network also works with other
environmental groups and governments
around the world to find alternate solu
tions to destroying forests for agricul
tural and energy needs, Voelker said.
She noted that there are ways to log
and farm that do not endanger the rain
forest environment. For example, she
said, if a small area is cleared, the bal
ance of the forest ecosystem is not
destroyed, and new trees actually grow
very quickly. The open space will allow
for more penetration of sunlight to the
seedlings on the ground and the sur
rounding plant life will supply nutrients.
Victories such as the Burger King can
cellation make the supporters of the
Rain Forest Action Network and other
environmental groups hopeful, Voelker
said.
Through letter-writing campaigns they
hope to help pass two bills in the United
States that would benefit rain forest pre
servation. The Meat Labelling Act,
which would require all meat and
produce to be labeled with its country of
origin, would make it possible to identify
Central American beef. The other bill,
the Tropical Rain Forest Protection Act
would make it more difficult for the
World Bank to fund development in rain
forest areas.
