## Optimism reigns as Card prepares for SDSU 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
The Stanford football team finally
has a win to its credit, and the atmos
phere surrounding the team has sud
denly gone from gloomy to optimistic.
"I think from here on out we'll be a
different football team," Stanford run
ning back Jon Volpe said after the Car
dinal defeated Washington State 44-7 in
Pullman Saturday.
"I'm hoping guys will learn from this
and remember how we did this — the
attitude and hard work this took,"
Stanford receiver Jeff James said.
"Hopefully we'll get back on track. A
7-4 season is not out of the question."
It's not inconceivable, but to finish
7-4, Stanford would have to win the
remainder of its games, including con
tests against USC, Arizona and sur
prisingly tough Oregon. Colorado
started off 0-5 last year, however, and
wound up going to a bowl game with a
6-5 record.
The Cardinal is currently 1-4 overall
and 1-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference
heading into Saturday's non
conference matchup with San Diego
State. SDSU is 1-5 on the season and 1-
3 in the Western Athletic Conference,
but the Aztecs played well against
Oregon, losing 25-20, and narrowly fell
to Texas-El Paso, 34-33, last weekend.
"Last year Stanford was a bowl
team, and we were a bowl team," San
Diego State Head Coach Denny Stolz
said. "Football is a funny game."
Stolz said that the Cardinal's
blowout of Washington State may
change the Aztecs' approach to Stan
ford. "Our evaluation of Stanford has
changed a little bit," Stolz said. "They
played a great game at Washington
State. They had all the changes at quar

terback and lost a great running back in
Brad Muster, who's probably the best
player in the Pac-10 offensively. . . .
We have a lot of respect for them."
Muster, who rushed for 115 yards
and one touchdown on 26 carries and
caught seven passes for 51 yards
against the Aztecs last year, has missed
four of Stanford's first five games with
a sprained left ankle. The senior tail
back did not practice all last week, did
not make the trip to Pullman and is
listed as "day-to-day" this week.
Filling in for Muster, Volpe had 26
carries for 105 yards and two touch
downs against Washington State, and
also caught two passes for 89 yards and
one score. For his efforts, Volpe was
nominated for Pac-10 Offensive Player
of Week by the Stanford coaching
staff. "I guess I'm probably harder to
tackle than most people because my
center of gravity is lower," the 5-foot-7
sophomore explained. "Tacklers go
over me rather than through me."
Fellow sophomore Brian Johnson
continued to draw accolades after his
successful debut as Stanford's starting
quarterback. "Brian passed his first
game experience test at this level with
flying colors," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said. "Obviously, he feels good
about it, the team feels good about it
and I know 1 feel good about it."
Elway also felt good about the Stan
ford defense, which surrendered just
one early score to the Cougars, who
were second in the conference in
scoring offense going into the contest.
"Washington State is a good football
team, and the win was a tribute to our
defense," Elway said. "They kept
everything in front of them."
"The first half we came together
defensively," said linebacker Barry
McKeever, who recorded six tackles in

his first extensive action since under
going knee surgery last spring.
"Everyone had a big game."
Special teams, consistently Stan
ford's best unit this season, also had a
big game. The squad is getting recogni
tion for its performance, as Alan Grant
was named Pac-10 Special Teams
Player of the Week this week for his 77-
yard punt return, his second touch
down on a punt return this year and the
third longest punt return in Stanford
history. Grant is third in the country in
punt returns, averaging 20.1 yards per
return.
Punter Doug Robison is now leading
the nation in punting with a 48.1 yards
per kick average, and Stanford is
second in the country in net punting
with a 43.9 yards per punt average.
Card notes
Volpe has taken over the team lead in
rushing with 165 total yards on the year.
Senior quarterback (ireg Knnis is second
with 128.
The sophomore tailback also has four re
ceptions for 103 yards (a 25.8 yards per
catch average). "Coach Elway didn't know
you could catch the hall so well," Elway
told Volpe at the weekly football press con
ference yesterday. "Thanks," replied
Volpe, who had just eight receptions his
senior year of high school.
Johnson and Volpe were named Stanford
Offensive Players of the Week. Johnson did
not throw an interception in the first start of
his career, although Cougar defensive back
Shawn Landrum should have picked off one
pass in the end zone in the second quarter.
"That pass was broken up by Shawn
Landrum on his numbers," said the Wash
ington State public address announcer.
Stanford quarterbacks threw 11 intercep
tions in the first four games of the season.

defensively," said linebacker Barry
McKeever, who recorded six tackles in

his first extensive action since under
going knee surgery last spring.
"Everyone had a big game."
Special teams, consistently Stan
ford's best unit this season, also had a
big game. The squad is getting recogni
tion for its performance, as Alan Grant
was named Pac-10 Special Teams
Player of the Week this week for his 77-
yard punt return, his second touch
down on a punt return this year and the
third longest punt return in Stanford
history. Grant is third in the country in
punt returns, averaging 20.1 yards per
return.
Punter Doug Robison is now leading
the nation in punting with a 48.1 yards
per kick average, and Stanford is
second in the country in net punting
with a 43.9 yards per punt average.
Card notes
Volpe has taken over the team lead in
rushing with 165 total yards on the year.
Senior quarterback (ireg Knnis is second
with 128.
The sophomore tailback also has four re
ceptions for 103 yards (a 25.8 yards per
catch average). "Coach Elway didn't know
you could catch the hall so well," Elway
told Volpe at the weekly football press con
ference yesterday. "Thanks," replied
Volpe, who had just eight receptions his
senior year of high school.
Johnson and Volpe were named Stanford
Offensive Players of the Week. Johnson did
not throw an interception in the first start of
his career, although Cougar defensive back
Shawn Landrum should have picked off one
pass in the end zone in the second quarter.
"That pass was broken up by Shawn
Landrum on his numbers," said the Wash
ington State public address announcer.
Stanford quarterbacks threw 11 intercep
tions in the first four games of the season.

Defensive tackles Lester Archanibeau (on ground) and Sean Scheller, here wrapping up
Washington State quarterback Timm Rosen bach, are part of a Stanford defense that
made a dramatic turnaround in Stanford's 44-7 win over the Cougars.
The Stanford football team finally
has a win to its credit, and the atmos
phere surrounding the team has sud
denly gone from gloomy to optimistic.
"I think from here on out we'll be a
different football team," Stanford run
ning back Jon Volpe said after the Car
dinal defeated Washington State 44-7 in
Pullman Saturday.
"I'm hoping guys will learn from this
and remember how we did this — the
attitude and hard work this took,"
Stanford receiver Jeff James said.
"Hopefully we'll get back on track. A
7-4 season is not out of the question."
It's not inconceivable, but to finish
7-4, Stanford would have to win the
remainder of its games, including con
tests against USC, Arizona and sur
prisingly tough Oregon. Colorado
started off 0-5 last year, however, and
wound up going to a bowl game with a
6-5 record.
The Cardinal is currently 1-4 overall
and 1-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference
heading into Saturday's non
conference matchup with San Diego
State. SDSU is 1-5 on the season and 1-
3 in the Western Athletic Conference,
but the Aztecs played well against
Oregon, losing 25-20, and narrowly fell
to Texas-El Paso, 34-33, last weekend.
"Last year Stanford was a bowl
team, and we were a bowl team," San
Diego State Head Coach Denny Stolz
said. "Football is a funny game."
Stolz said that the Cardinal's
blowout of Washington State may
change the Aztecs' approach to Stan
ford. "Our evaluation of Stanford has
changed a little bit," Stolz said. "They
played a great game at Washington
State. They had all the changes at quar

terback and lost a great running back in
Brad Muster, who's probably the best
player in the Pac-10 offensively. . . .
We have a lot of respect for them."
Muster, who rushed for 115 yards
and one touchdown on 26 carries and
caught seven passes for 51 yards
against the Aztecs last year, has missed
four of Stanford's first five games with
a sprained left ankle. The senior tail
back did not practice all last week, did
not make the trip to Pullman and is
listed as "day-to-day" this week.
Filling in for Muster, Volpe had 26
carries for 105 yards and two touch
downs against Washington State, and
also caught two passes for 89 yards and
one score. For his efforts, Volpe was
nominated for Pac-10 Offensive Player
of Week by the Stanford coaching
staff. "I guess I'm probably harder to
tackle than most people because my
center of gravity is lower," the 5-foot-7
sophomore explained. "Tacklers go
over me rather than through me."
Fellow sophomore Brian Johnson
continued to draw accolades after his
successful debut as Stanford's starting
quarterback. "Brian passed his first
game experience test at this level with
flying colors," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said. "Obviously, he feels good
about it, the team feels good about it
and I know 1 feel good about it."
Elway also felt good about the Stan
ford defense, which surrendered just
one early score to the Cougars, who
were second in the conference in
scoring offense going into the contest.
"Washington State is a good football
team, and the win was a tribute to our
defense," Elway said. "They kept
everything in front of them."

McKeever, who recorded six tackles in
