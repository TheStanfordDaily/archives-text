# Recruiting time for Mike Montgomery
## 
### 
Forget about UCLA at Pauley
Pavilion or California at Harmon
Gym; the toughest contests Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery and his
basketball staff will face are being
played out right now.

It's the height of college basketball
recruiting season, and Montgomery
is trying to wrap up next year's fresh
man class by Nov. 9, the early na
tional letter of intent signing date.
Recruits are the lifeblood of a bas
ketball program. In many ways a
coach's recruiting talents are far
more important than his bench
coaching skills, and Montgomery and
his staff are now in the midst of what
may be their most important recruit
ing year in their struggle to build the
Stanford program.
With Cardinal stars Todd Lichti
and Howard Wright entering their
junior seasons and no apparent
replacements of their caliber waiting

in the wings, Montgomery needs to
bring in support now so that next
year's freshmen can receive a year of
seasoning before being thrown into
the fray.
"This year and next year are abso
lutely critical for us. We've got to get
some quality young players,"
Montgomery said recently. "We
think we're going to be a good bas
ketball team the next two years. I
think it's very important for us to
maintain that momentum so athletes
look at us as a viable alternative."
Finding players who can step in
and immediately contribute as Lichti
and Wright did their freshman year is
complicated by Stanford's unique
combination of Ivy-level admissions
and Pacific 10 Conference competi
tion.
Of those, he can realistically hope
to recruit maybe five, going down to
the wire on two or three. When one
reaches the rarified atmosphere of
these top athletes, the competition is
rough. Everyone wants the top ath
lete.
Montgomery often finds himself
recruiting against Eastern basketball
and academic powers such as Duke,
Virginia and Vanderbilt, and, if the
player is good enough, the Ken
tuckys and Syracuses of the college
basketball world can't be far behind.

Montgomery's task is further com
plicated by the fact that potential
recruits must complete their applica
tions by November so he can get
some preliminary feedback on their
chances for admission. Montgomery
talks of a 3.0 GPA and 1000 on the
SATs as bare minimums.
Try telling a hot-shot senior to
complete a Stanford application with
no guarantee of acceptance when
Notre Dame is telling him they can
make him a saint, Kentucky is offer
ing to name the Derby winner after
him and other schools are telling him
the toughest thing he'll have to do is
decide whether he wants a Porsche or
Ferrari.
"Sometimes reality is not a big part
of recruiting for these kids,"
Montgomery said. "We're asking
them to write essays and do other
stuff. They don't want to hear that.
We've got to follow up. All we can
say is, 'Look, part of what makes
Stanford special is that the admis
sions process is very thorough, and
as a result you'll most likely
graduate.'
"When they start to realize they're
going to be recruited by Kentucky,
Notre Dame, North Carolina, Duke
and Syracuse then things start to
change, and their interest peaks or
lessens. If it lessens, you know their

interest is more in basketball than the
big picture," Montgomery said.
Operating within these parameters,
Montgomery and his staff run one of
the most comprehensive recruiting
processes in the nation. While the
powers can concentrate on the super
stars, Montgomery initially considers
thousands of athletes and the pool is
gradually winnowed down to a dozen
or so who visit Stanford in the fall of
their senior year.
"We really feel we have to recruit
nationally to find the top 10 or 15 stu
dent athletes. It's just a matter of get
ting a break," Montgomery said.
"What's really important is, given an
adequate level of ability, you look for
a guy who's a competition"
Despite all the hurdles,
Montgomery believes he may be on
the verge of a top-notch recruiting
season as he enters the final stretch
of the process. Last Wednesday was
the final day Montgomery and his as
sistants were allowed to visit recruits
at their homes or schools, and the
Stanford staff will spend the last
month of recruiting season trying to
maintain contact through calls and
letters and by hosting recruits on
their weekend visits.
"A very large part of our job is
recruiting. You've got to have
players," Montgomery said.
