# Third World emphasis
## Feminist lecture series planned 
### Natalie Pickering 
An annual Stanford lecture se
ries on feminist issues will focus
this fall on struggles and achieve
ments of women in the Third
World.
English and Feminist Studies
Prof. Adrienne Rich conceived of
the idea for the Jing Lyman
Lecture Series to have an inter
national focus this year and
feature women of diverse ethnic
backgrounds involved in aca
demic research and political ac
tivism.
Rich said she felt it was impor
tant to invite "women doing the
ory who are also active working

with women as well as writing
about women."
The series will include sessions
dealing with the Middle East,
Africa, Latin America and the
Pacific Islands.
Rich said she hopes insights
into the grass roots struggles of
feminists in Third World nations
will remind younger women that
feminism as an "intellectual dis
cipline did not spring from an
other intellectual discipline, but
rather from social movements."
She said she hopes the series
will illustrate that "looking
globally, the women's movement
is very much alive. Incredible
networking and interchanges of
ideas are taking place."

Rich said that in order to see
the similarities and differences of
women's struggles worldwide, it
is important for students to at
tend a number of the lectures,
not just those focusing on a single
country or area of interest.
The series will begin tomorrow
at 7:30 p.m. in Cubberly
Auditorium with introductory
remarks from Rich and a panel
discussion featuring noted Third
World scholars, including Lioba
Moshi, a Stanford lecturer in lin
guistics; Raquel Sancho, deputy
director of the Tandang Sora
Women's Center; Salvadoran ac
tivist Ana Perla; and Sylvia
Wynter, Stanford professor of
Spanish and Portuguese. Subse

quent lectures will he held Wed
nesdays at noon in the Law
School.
The series, coordinated by the
Institute for Research on Women
and Gender, was originally
endowed by Jing Lyman, the
wife of former Stanford president
Richard Lyman. The program
began in 1976 and has addressed
women's issues in areas such as
employment, art, race and reli
gion.
Rich said she hopes this year's
series will emphasize "both the
global nature of women's experi
ences and the fact that women all
over the world are organizing un
der the most extreme condi
tions."
