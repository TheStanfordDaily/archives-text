# Stanford libraries get state grant
## 
### Gordon Stephenson 
Stanford's library system has
been selected to administer a
$296,430 grant to develop a major
policy study on the changing eth
nic character of California and
the implications this might have
for the state's library and infor
mation services.
The funding for the grant is
being provided by the California
State Library, a state-supported
organization.
Robert Trujillo, head of the
University's Foreign Language

Department and curator of Stan
ford's Mexican-American Col
lection, is co-chair of the plan
ning committee that submitted
the successful bid for the grant.
The Rand Corporation has
been awarded the contract to
prepare the policy study which
will focus on the theme, "A State
of Change: California's Ethnic
Future and Libraries." The
report will be released in April
1988, and a conference, to be
held in San Diego a month later,
will generate an agenda of related
policy issues to be addressed by
the state.

How the state will deal with
the rapid influx of ethnic
minority groups, especially
Mexicans, has been been an
issue of prominent concern in
California state government in
recent years.
Studies suggest that within 20
years the state will become
predominantly ethnic; that is,
blacks, Hispanics, Asians and
Native Americans will outnum
ber Caucasians.
"The emergence and eventual
population dominance of citizens
with a variety of needs, values

and interests presents the library
field with new challenges and op
portunities," Trujillo said.
"This policy study will con
sider the cultural, educational
and social implications to libra
ries of this change."
Following the San Diego con
ference, "awareness forums"
will be held throughout the state
in June and July, 1988. These
smaller conferences will be held
so that local libraries and public
information agencies will have an
opportunity to express their
views on the study's findings.
