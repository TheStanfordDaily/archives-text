# Finding Library Materials
## Catalogs 
### 
There are two kinds of catalogs at
Stanford—the online catalog and the
card catalog—and, since neither cata
log is complete, you will need to be
come familiar with both in order to
locate library materials.
Socrates, the online catalog, is
usually the best place to begin your
search since new materials will only be
found in Socrates and the computerized
access to the catalog offers search capa
bilities that are not available with the

manual card catalogs. Socrates con
tains records for approximately 64% of
the libraries' collections: all items in
the Meyer Memorial Library and rec
ords for items processed since 1973 for
Green Library and the branches. Rec
ords for materials acquired before 1973
are gradually being added to Socrates.
Records for the Coordinate Libraries
have been added to Socrates since
1977.
Socrates can be searched from ter
minals located in Green, Meyer, the
branch libraries, the Hoover Institu
tion, and the Robert Crown Law Li
brary. Printing facilities are available
at Green and Meyer and will be in
stalled at other locations. Socrates can
also be searched from outside the li
braries using terminals or computers
that are connected to the Data Center at
Forsythe Hall. Faculty, students, and
staff may obtain free accounts which
provide twenty-four hour access to
Socrates. Inquire at library service
desks.

Socrates is easy to use, and new
users can be self-tutored by following
online instructions. Users can also
refer to the two-page Reference Guide
to Socrates, found near Socrates termi
nals, or Socrates: a user guide, avail
able at public service desks. Short
workshops on Socrates searching will
be held this Fall. Consult library staff,
or check the online announcements on
Socrates, for times and dates.
The card catalog located near the
entrance to the East Wing of Green
Library contains cards listing many
holdings of the Libraries of Stanford.
Since August 15, 1986, however, cards
for newly processed books have not
been filed in this card catalog or in most
of the other campus library card cata
logs. Records for these newer materials
will be found only in Socrates. The card
catalogs still contain many thousands
of records for items that do not yet
appear in Socrates, and in order to be
sure Stanford does or does not have a
particular item, users should check the
card catalog as well as Socrates.
The Green Library card catalog
does not contain cards for books in the
Meyer Library (all of Meyer's holdings
are in Socrates) nor for most of the
holdings of the Jonsson Library of
Government Documents. In addition,
cards listing the holdings of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Library are not
included in this catalog. Finally, much
of the non-book materials (printed
music, sound recordings, manuscripts
and archives, audio visual materials,
etc.) held by the Stanford University
Libraries are not represented in this
catalog.
