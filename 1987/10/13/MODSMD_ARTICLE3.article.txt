### Haru Connolly Erin Martin Staff writers 
The Asian-American, Native
American, Chicano-Latino and
black communities selected stu
dent representatives last night to
serve as members of the Univer
sity's Committee on Minority Af
fairs.
Chosen at meetings of the indi
vidual ethnic minority groups,
the representatives will seek con
firmation by the ASSU Senate at
tonight's meeting.
The committee, composed of
faculty, staff, students and indi
viduals from outside the Stanford
community, will explore and
seek improvements in the condi
tion of minority life here.
The students chosen for the

committee are: sophomore
Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza of the
Chicano-Latino community;
graduate student David Porter of
the black community; Joey
Thomas, a Native American; and
junior Brian Kim. an Asian-
American.
"It's going to be exhausting
because a lot of changes have to
be made," said Lopez Mendoza.
"But I'm very excited."
According to Porter, "At the
core of all demands are problems
of institutional racism and under
lying prejudices."
PorteT, who received a bache
lor's degree in industrial engi
neering from Stanford last year,
intends to pursue an increase in
minority admissions at both the
undergraduate and graduate
levels.

"I think a lot can be done by
diversifying the way Stanford
recruits," he said.
Lopez Mendoza agreed with
Porter, saying that Stanford
needs to re-examine its recruiting
policies.
Another issue of considerable
importance to both Lopez Men
doza and Porter was an increase
in minority professors and ad
ministrators "at all levels of the
University," Porter said.
