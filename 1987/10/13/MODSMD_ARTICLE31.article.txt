### 
Reference librarians throughout
the library system are expert in locating
elusive library materials, in providing
instruction in the use of library cata
logs, in explaining the use of reference
materials, and in answering all ques
tions involving effective use of the li
braries. Reference librarians and the
curatorial staff (librarians with respon
sibilities for the collections in particu
lar disciplines or geographical/lan
guage areas) will also recommend
appropriate strategies or techniques for
locating materials for research projects
ranging from term papers to disserta
tions. To arrange a consultation, call or
stop by the reference desk in the library
serving your discipline. Contact with
the subject specialist in your field will

be extremely valuable in helping you
find research materials scattered
throughout the Stanford libraries as
well as materials held at other institu
tions.
One service offered by reference
staff is computerized searching of on
line databases. This service, called the
Computer Search Service, provides
access to hundreds of online databases,
covering virtually all fields â€”business
and management, engineering and
technology, life and physical sciences,
social and behavioral sciences, hu
manities and current events.
The databases, some of which cor
respond to familiar printed indexing
and abstracting services, include refer
ences to published articles, books, con
ference proceedings, technical reports,
government documents, and in some
cases, actual data or full text. A com
puter search of the appropriate data
bases can save you much time and
enormous effort, and may identify in
formation not available in printed form.
Not all references retrieved from data

base searches are necessarily available
in campus libraries, although materials
may easily be obtained on interlibrary
loan or through document delivery
services. Funding for database
searches is available to eligible stu
dents from "Support for Online Search
ing" (5.0.5.).

databases.

The Computer Search Service is a
collaborative effort between a librar
ian/search analyst, who has knowledge
of available databases and the search
protocols, and the researcher, who has
knowledge of the subject area. Re
cently, librarians at the Swain Library
of Chemistry and Chemical Engineer
ing and at the Branner Library of Earth
Sciences have begun teaching inter-

ested faculty and graduate students
how to search the Chemical Abstracts
database on their own. The Libraries
are also investigating other do-it-your
self search options such as CD-ROM
(compact disk read only memory) tech
nology.
The Data and Information Serv
ices Librarian at Green Library (725-
1054), or any member of the libraries'
public service staff, will be happy to
provide you with further information
about reference services, the Computer
Search Service, and other online infor
mation resources.
