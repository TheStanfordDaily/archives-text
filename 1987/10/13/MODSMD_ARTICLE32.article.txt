# Using Library Materials
## Circulation 
### 
Borrowing Materials
Borrowing regulations have been
developed to meet the varying research
and instructional needs of faculty, stu
dents, and other members of the Stan
ford community. Loan periods range
from one week to an academic year. All
eligible borrowers must present appro
priate identification cards to check out
library materials. Current University
ID cards serve as library cards for fac
ulty, students, and staff. For specific in
formation, contact the Privileges Desk
in the East Wing of Green Library (723-
1491) or the loan desks of all libraries.
Renewing Loans
Procedures for renewing charged
materials vary according to your uni
versity status (faculty, student, etc.)
and to the regulations of the particular
library from which the material was
borrowed.
Recalling Materials
If the material you need is charged
to another borrower who has used the
material for at least two weeks, most
campus libraries will recall the material
for you. Recall slips are available at the
circulation desk in each library. Recalls

generally take about seven days. If
material you have charged out is re
called, return the materials promptly
for the use of others. Fines for overdue
recalls are high, since another person is
inconvenienced by the delay.
Returning Materials
To avoid fines for lost or overdue
library materials, always return
charged materials on time to the library
from which the material was borrowed.
Fastbook
A book and photocopy delivery
service, called FASTBOOK, is offered
by the University Libraries to faculty,
graduate students, and staff. FAST
BOOK will deliver materials for loan
from the holding library (including the
Stanford Auxiliary Library) to the li
brary which you frequent, send photo
copies to offices, homes, or campus
libraries, or notify you if the material is
unavailable. Requests for loan or pho
tocopy may be made at any time by
calling 723-FAST or by sending an
electronic mail message to
CN.lLS(a)Forsythe. There is a charge
of $.10 per page for photocopies plus
applicable sales tax.
