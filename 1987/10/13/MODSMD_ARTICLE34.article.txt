### 
Research Libraries Group
The Research Libraries Group
(RLG) is a consortium of over 36 major
research institutions and libraries in
cluding Stanford, Yale, Columbia, the
New York Public Library, University
of Michigan, UC Berkeley, Princeton,
Cornell, and University of Pennsylva
nia. RLG member institutions may
borrow materials from each others'
collections with minimal restrictions.
The RUN (Research Libraries Infor
mation Network) database provides
access to the cataloging records (cur
rently over 11 million and growing rap
idly) of the members' collections and
can be searched by reference desk staff.
In addition to interlibrary loan, faculty
and students of RLG member institu
tions have on-site access privileges at
fellow member libraries.
Interlibrary Loan
Faculty, registered students, and
staff may submit interlibrary loan re
quests for materials that are not avail
able at Stanford but which are needed
for research. Forms are available at the

Reference Desk in Green and at public
service desks in other libraries. Re
quests should be submitted in person at
the desk where the forms were ob
tained. The Interlibrary Loan Service
of the Stanford University Libraries
(located in Room 151, Green East) is
able to acquire about 85% of the re
quested items, and many of those re
quests are filled within two weeks from
RLG libraries.
Berkeley/Stanford Research
Library Cooperative Program
This program makes the library
resources of the U.C. Berkeley and the
Stanford University Libraries available
to faculty, academic staff, and currently
registered graduate students from both
institutions. The program provides
participants with reciprocal borrowing
privileges at both campuses, campus to
campus delivery of materials, and ac
cess to one another's bibliographic rec
ords. Registered participants can re
quest materials directly from Berkeley
by dialing 964-B AKER on a special toll
free telephone in Green Library. Mate

rials will he delivered to the Green
Loan Desk where materials can he
picked up and returned. To register for
the program, contact the Privileges
Desk in Green Library. A brochure on
the program is available at public serv
ice desks.

transportation between the Stanford
and Berkeley campuses. The bus
makes two runs each day, Monday
through Friday (except holidays).
Departure times from Stanford are 8:30

the Green Library service vehicle area
between Hoover and Green Library.
