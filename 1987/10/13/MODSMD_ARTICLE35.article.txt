As members of the
Stanford community we
benefit from 100 years of
planning, building, growing,
and caring. Much of the
libraries' collections here for
you today have been here for
many years, and their value
and usefulness to students
develop and change with the
decades. But unfortunately
many factors conspire to
shorten the life of library
materials. The libraries are
committed to the preserva
tion of our collections but
we cannot do the job alone.
When you use library
materials we ask that you
accept the role of "care
taker." You help to preserve
Stanford's legacy of learning
for another 100 years when
you:
—Keep food and drink
away from library materials.
Food and beverage spills
damage paper, obscure text,
attract insects, and generally
make library materials un
pleasant to use.
—Make notes, comments,
etc., on scrap paper instead of
marking library materials.
Ink, in particular, may con
tribute to the deterioration of
book papers.
—Use bookmarks to hold
your place instead of creasing
page corners. Dog-eared or
creased comers weaken pa
per.
—Handle books carefully
when photocopying. Severe
damage to bindings can result
when pressure is applied
while photocopying.
