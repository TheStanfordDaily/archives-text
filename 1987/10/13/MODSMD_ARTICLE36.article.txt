The University Libraries' holdings

Stack in the basement level under

accessible only through the East Wing.
Older materials are located in auxiliary
storage and can be paged. During the
1987-88 academic year, many collec
tions normally housed in the West and
South Stacks are being temporarily
shelved in the Stanford Auxiliary Li
