The bulk of the University Librar
ies' collections in science and engineer
ing are assembled in the seven branch
libraries described below. In each a
reference librarian is available to pro
vide information and bibliographic
assistance in the use of the collections.
Biology Library
(Falconer)
(Biological Science Center, Herrin
Building, 3rd floor; Joe Wible, Head
Librarian; 723-1110); The Falconer
Biology Library contains over 80,000
volumes, including 2,000 serials titles.
There are strong collections in the areas
of cell and developmental biology, ge
netic and molecular biology, and popu
lation biology. The Jasper Ridge Pa
pers and the Senior Honors Papers are
two small special collections main
tained in the library. Photocopy ma
chines are available in the library in
cluding a photocopy service provided
by the Biology Department.
Chemistry and Chemical
Engineering Library (Swain)
(Organic Chemistry Building, west
end; Joe Wible, Acting Head Librar
ian; 723-9237); The Swain Library of
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering
houses collections in catalysis, fluid
mechanics, bio-engineering, polymers,
surface science, kinetics, electrochem
istry, organic, inorganic, physical and
biophysical chemistry, and chemical

engineering. The library also main
tains collections of dissertations earned
by Stanford chemistry and chemical
engineering students since 1950.
Earth Sciences Library
(Branner)
(Mitchell Earth Sciences Building, 2nd

ian; 723-2746); The Branner Library
supports the undergraduate, graduate,
and special programs of the School of
Earth Sciences. Its collections include
current and retrospective materials in
all fields of applied earth sciences,
geology, geophysics, and petroleum
engineering. State and foreign geologi
cal, hydrological, natural hazards, and
natural resources maps and topographi
cal quadrangles of the U.S. Geological
Survey form a large part of the 100,000
sheet map collection. Reports and
theses produced by the School of Earth
Sciences are also kept on file.
Engineering Library

Research. In addition to reference ma

terials, monographs and serials, the
library houses a large number of techni
cal reports both in hard copy and micro
fiche. Course reserves, including a
large number of videotapes, are avail
able at the loan desk. The library pro
vides access to many online biblio
graphic retrieval systems (including
DIALOG, NASA/RECON, BRS, and
ORBIT) which cover Engineering In
dex, the lEEE Abstracts, and other
important reference sources.

includes the University Libraries' ma
jor holdings in marine biology with
special emphasis on biological
rhythms, developmental biology, ma
rine botany, marine ecology, marine
zoology, neurobiology, and the physi
ology of marine organisms. Holdings
are listed in Socrates as well as in the
main catalog in Green Library. Users
interested in obtaining these materials
should contact staff in the Falconer
Biology Library, the Branner Earth
Sciences Library, or Interlibrary Serv
ices at Green, or call Alan Baldridge
