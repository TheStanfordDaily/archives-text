# Survivors take out new lease on life
## 
### Jennifer Collins 
With an increasing number of people
beating the odds and surviving cancer, some
have decided that it is time to applaud these
victories.
The 1987 Cancer Survivor Celebration held
Saturday at the Medical Center was designed
to do just that by providing a "celebratory at
mosphere" for the growing ranks of cancer
survivors in the Bay Area.
According to Susan Weisberg, a social
worker in the Medical Center Department of
Therapeutic Radiology and one of the event's
organizers, the Cancer Survivor Celebration
was also planned to "change stereotypical
thinking about cancer," which is character
ized by fear and misunderstanding.

The day-long event was sponsored by the
Medical Center and by chapters of the Ameri
can Cancer Society in Alameda, San Fran
cisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara.
Activities throughout the day included in
formative displays prepared by various can
cer patient support groups, two panel discus
sions, musical performances by several
groups who donated their time for the event,
and an "open mike" that gave survivors the
chance to share their personal experiences
with the crowd.
Saturday's celebration was the first of its
kind in this area, but similar gatherings in
Texas, Philadelphia and Boston took place
earlier this year, said Pat Fobair, also a social
worker with the Department of Therapeutic
Radiology. "This is the year for this kind of

celebration," she said.
The recent increase in cancer survivor fes
tivals across the country may be due to both
the growing number of Americans surviving
the disease and to an increasing emphasis on
"survivorship" by cancer support groups,
according to Nannette Kinsberg, director of
Service and Rehabilitation at the San Mateo
Cancer Society.
Some of the groups participating Saturday
included the National Coalition of Cancer
Survivorship and Coping magazine.
According to Kinsberg, survivors were
asked before the celebration to bring art
work, poetry and prose for an anthology to be
distributed to all survivors registered for the
event.
At the celebration, written
thoughts of survivors, their
families and friends were collec
ted on paper balloons and con
nected to form a growing mural
of personal messages, such as
one anonymous survivor's ad
vice, "The secret is, 'Keep
Laughing.' "
A panel of survivors and their
relatives shared personal experi
ences and advice with the audi
ence. Panelists included Wendy
Traber, a graphic designer; Brad
Zebrack, a teacher and cyclist;
Karen Vagshenian, a wife and
mother of two; and Steve Eigsti,
father of Shannon Eigsti, a can
cer survivor and high school
senior.
Steve Eigsti gave the audience
an optimistic report on his
daughter's future, saying the
score was "Shannon - 1, Cancer
-0."
"Survivorship means a choice
to live," Zebrack said, explain
ing that the emphasis among sur
vivors attending the celebration
was on life. Zebrack then added
an account of his recent partici
pation in a one-day, 100 mile
bicycle event, and of his plans to
bicycle across America for one
year to promote awareness of
cancer survivorship.
Survivor Nora Lunt-Boyarsky
reaffirmed the panel's positive
message, saying, "It's not dying
of cancer, it's living with can
cer."
Lunt-Boyarsky also empha

sized the importance of family
support in battling the disease.
Speaking of her husband, Geof
frey Boyarsky, who attended
with her, she said she depended
on his "love and sense of
humor" during her struggle and
added, "He's a survivor, too."

Laura Hayes, who recently un
derwent chemotherapy treat
ment, came to the celebration
with her husband and children to
gather information on cancer
support groups and on
"networking" with other sur
vivors. By lunchtime, she said
she had already met another sur
vivor who lives around the cor
ner from her home.
Ruth Hall said she brought her
daughter, Jamie, who is currently
undergoing radiation therapy, to
see that "other people have been
through what she's going
through."

Jamie nodded when asked if
she was enjoying the celebration,
which included magic shows,
clowns, juggling and face
painting to entertain the children
present.
For those in search of commu
nity support, the celebration was
"the place to be," according to
Alice Green, a Palo Alto resident
who, over the past 10 years, has
personally housed over 250 can
cer patients undergoing treat
ment at the Medical Center.
Green is a recipient of the Medi
cal Center's Distinguished Ser
vice Award.
Mel Ciena, a psychologist and
disc jockey who served as master
of ceremonies for the day's en
tertainment, read a series of sup
portive greetings sent to the
event by various public figures,
including U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson
and Governor George Deuk
mejian.
"There is life after diagnosis,"
Ciena, himself a cancer survivor,
said. "Whether you live two
days or ninety years, you can live
a full life until that time is
over. . . . That's survival."
The celebration concluded
with a release of balloons carry
ing names and addresses of at
tending survivors.
Saturday's turnout of about
500 people was considered a suc
cessful one by celebration organ
izers. Kinsberg said the Ameri
can Cancer Society will try to
coordinate future survivor
celebrations in order to
"promote a broader national
awareness of survivorship."

"the place to be," according to
Alice Green, a Palo Alto resident
who, over the past 10 years, has
personally housed over 250 can
cer patients undergoing treat
ment at the Medical Center.
Green is a recipient of the Medi
cal Center's Distinguished Ser
vice Award.
Mel Ciena, a psychologist and
disc jockey who served as master
of ceremonies for the day's en
tertainment, read a series of sup
portive greetings sent to the
event by various public figures,
including U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson
and Governor George Deuk
mejian.
"There is life after diagnosis,"
Ciena, himself a cancer survivor,
said. "Whether you live two
days or ninety years, you can live
a full life until that time is
over. . . . That's survival."
The celebration concluded
with a release of balloons carry
ing names and addresses of at
tending survivors.
Saturday's turnout of about
500 people was considered a suc
cessful one by celebration organ
izers. Kinsberg said the Ameri
can Cancer Society will try to
coordinate future survivor
celebrations in order to
"promote a broader national
awareness of survivorship."

With an increasing number of people
beating the odds and surviving cancer, some
have decided that it is time to applaud these
victories.
The 1987 Cancer Survivor Celebration held
Saturday at the Medical Center was designed
to do just that by providing a "celebratory at
mosphere" for the growing ranks of cancer
survivors in the Bay Area.
According to Susan Weisberg, a social
worker in the Medical Center Department of
Therapeutic Radiology and one of the event's
organizers, the Cancer Survivor Celebration
was also planned to "change stereotypical
thinking about cancer," which is character
ized by fear and misunderstanding.

The day-long event was sponsored by the
Medical Center and by chapters of the Ameri
can Cancer Society in Alameda, San Fran
cisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara.
Activities throughout the day included in
formative displays prepared by various can
cer patient support groups, two panel discus
sions, musical performances by several
groups who donated their time for the event,
and an "open mike" that gave survivors the
chance to share their personal experiences
with the crowd.
Saturday's celebration was the first of its
kind in this area, but similar gatherings in
Texas, Philadelphia and Boston took place
earlier this year, said Pat Fobair, also a social
worker with the Department of Therapeutic
Radiology. "This is the year for this kind of

celebration," she said.
The recent increase in cancer survivor fes
tivals across the country may be due to both
the growing number of Americans surviving
the disease and to an increasing emphasis on
"survivorship" by cancer support groups,
according to Nannette Kinsberg, director of
Service and Rehabilitation at the San Mateo
Cancer Society.
Some of the groups participating Saturday
included the National Coalition of Cancer
Survivorship and Coping magazine.
According to Kinsberg, survivors were
asked before the celebration to bring art
work, poetry and prose for an anthology to be
distributed to all survivors registered for the
event.
At the celebration, written
thoughts of survivors, their
families and friends were collec
ted on paper balloons and con
nected to form a growing mural
of personal messages, such as
one anonymous survivor's ad
vice, "The secret is, 'Keep
Laughing.' "
A panel of survivors and their
relatives shared personal experi
ences and advice with the audi
ence. Panelists included Wendy
Traber, a graphic designer; Brad
Zebrack, a teacher and cyclist;
Karen Vagshenian, a wife and
mother of two; and Steve Eigsti,
father of Shannon Eigsti, a can
cer survivor and high school
senior.
Steve Eigsti gave the audience
an optimistic report on his
daughter's future, saying the
score was "Shannon - 1, Cancer
-0."
"Survivorship means a choice
to live," Zebrack said, explain
ing that the emphasis among sur
vivors attending the celebration
was on life. Zebrack then added
an account of his recent partici
pation in a one-day, 100 mile
bicycle event, and of his plans to
bicycle across America for one
year to promote awareness of
cancer survivorship.
Survivor Nora Lunt-Boyarsky
reaffirmed the panel's positive
message, saying, "It's not dying
of cancer, it's living with can
cer."
Lunt-Boyarsky also empha

sized the importance of family
support in battling the disease.
Speaking of her husband, Geof
frey Boyarsky, who attended
with her, she said she depended
on his "love and sense of
humor" during her struggle and
added, "He's a survivor, too."

Laura Hayes, who recently un
derwent chemotherapy treat
ment, came to the celebration
with her husband and children to
gather information on cancer
support groups and on
"networking" with other sur
vivors. By lunchtime, she said
she had already met another sur
vivor who lives around the cor
ner from her home.
Ruth Hall said she brought her
daughter, Jamie, who is currently
undergoing radiation therapy, to
see that "other people have been
through what she's going
through."

Jamie nodded when asked if
she was enjoying the celebration,
which included magic shows,
clowns, juggling and face
painting to entertain the children
present.
For those in search of commu
nity support, the celebration was
