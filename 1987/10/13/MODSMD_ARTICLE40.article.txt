Media Collections
The Media Center for the Univer
sity Libraries is located on the first floor
of Meyer Library. A wide variety of
media are housed there including films,
video tapes, sound recordings, audio
tapes, and slides. A general listening
area as well as rooms for group listen
ing or viewing are available.
Other valuable resources for au
dio-visual materials are: the Archive of
Recorded Sound which maintains an
historical collection of sound record
ings of all kinds; the Music Library
which has an extensive collection of
sound recordings supporting the re
search and teaching of the Music De
partment; several science branch li
braries which make video tapes of
classroom lectures available; and the
University Archives which collects
media documenting the history of Stan
ford.
Computer Workstations
Two clusters of IBM microcompu
ters are located in Green Library. A
cluster of six IBM Personal Computers
is available for use by Stanford stu
dents, faculty, and staff. Software is not
provided at this cluster, so users bring
their own. Cluster users present their
Stanford ID to the Green Library Loan
Desk to gain access to the cluster.
The other Green Library cluster,
which consists of six IBM AT's and
printing facilities, is for dissertation
preparation by Stanford graduate stu
dents advanced to candidacy. To use
this "dissertation lab" students should
possess a Doctoral Borrower's Card,
available from the Privileges Desk at
Green Library. Doctoral candidates in
the schools of Humanities and Sciences
and Education receive priority use of
the dissertation lab.
In addition to the IBM clusters,
three terminals are available in Green
Library communications rooms (lo
cated near the main stairway in the East
Wing) for unrestricted use by those
with Data Center or Folio accounts.
Use of the microcomputer clusters
in the Meyer and Engineering Libraries
is primarily for those students with
course assignments requiring use of the
computers. If machines are available
other students, faculty, or staff may use
them.
Manuscripts
The Department of Special Collec
tions and University Archives houses
important collections of manuscripts.
At the University Archives you can find
the papers and letters of Stanford fac
ulty members and presidents. See page
3 for a fuller description of this depart
ment.

The Hoover Institution Archives
has a world renown manuscript collec
tion, numbering over 36.7 million
pieces, consisting of the papers of per
sons and organizations involved in
education, journalism, scholarship,
politics, and the military.
Machine-Readable
Data Files
A wide variety of machine-read
able research and reference data is
available through the libraries. Social
science data files covering a wide range
of topics are described on page 3.
Bibliographic reference files as well as
some full text data bases can also be
searched online (see page 1). Ask at
reference desks for more information.
Maps
Maps may be found in several
locations on campus. Branner Earth
Sciences Library maintains a large
collection of maps including natural
resources maps and the topographical
quadrangles of the U.S. Geological
Survey. The Central Map Collection
(Green Library, West Wing, 2nd floor)
houses the general collection of topo
graphic maps, ethnolinguistic maps,
street maps, maps showing population
distributions and natural vegetation,
aeronautical and nautical charts, gazet
eers of place names, and cartographic
reference works. Few maps are repre
sented in the catalogs so it is wise to
consult with the map specialist, Karyl
Tonge.
Microform
The libraries widely collect micro
text materials. Green Library's collec
tions in microforms are housed in the
Current Periodicals and Microtext
Room located on the lower level of the
East Wing. A small sampling of the
collections includes: Presidential Pa
pers, the History of Women Collection,
Early American Imprints, the Human
Relations Area File, AEC Technical
Reports, the Goldsmith's-Kress Collec
tion, and census reports dating from
179(). Each of these microform collec
tions contain many individual titles but
Socrates, for the most part, does not
include records for the separate titles.
Printed guides which do provide de
tailed access to the microform collec
tions are available in the Microtext
Room. In addition to microform read
ers, machines which produce paper
copies from microfilm and microfiche
are available. There are also portable
microform readers available for loan.
The Education, Engineering, and
Government Documents Libraries also
have extensive microtext collections
covering subject areas in their disci
plines.

Periodicals and Newspapers
Periodicals form an integral part of
the library collections at Stanford. So
crates provides information about most
periodicals in Green, Meyer, the branch
libraries and most of the Coordinate
Libraries. The appropriate library
should be consulted in order to deter
mine holdings and shelving locations.
In Green current issues of periodicals
are shelved in the Current Periodicals
and Microtext Room on the lower level
the East Wing.
Newspapers - - current and back
issues - - are also housed in the Current
Periodicals and Microtext Room in
Green. Although newspapers are not
included in the main catalogs, a card
file of available titles is located in the
Current Periodicals and Microtext
Room. Meyer Library subscribes to
several domestic newspapers and
keeps them for one week. The titles
held in Meyer can be found in Socrates.
The libraries of the Hoover Institution
maintain a large collection of both
domestic and foreign newspapers.
