Action Boxes
User comments and recommenda
tions are encouraged and will receive
prompt attention by library staff.
"Action Boxes" are located in the cata
log area in the East Wing of Green and
on the second floor of Meyer. Similar
boxes are located in other campus li
braries. Suggestions can also be di
rected to the library via the Socrates
"Suggest" command. Responses to
comments are posted on a bulletin
board in the hallway between the East
and West Wings in Green Library and
near the stairway on the second floor in
Meyer Library. If you include your
name and address, we will respond to
you directly.
Lockers
Lockers in the Green Library are
available to provide patrons with se
cure places to keep personal belongings
while using the library and to hold
properly checked out library materials
between visits to the library. All lock
ers assignments are made by the Stack
Division (room 42A, lower level.
Green East). Locker assignments must
be renewed each quarter.
Photocopy
Photocopy machines are located
throughout the library system. Copies
cost $. 10 each. Change machines are
located near photocopy machines.
Using a COPICARD, a plastic card

similar to a credit card, eliminates the
need to have correct change and offers
reduced rates for volume purchasers.
COPICARDS may be purchased in
denominations ranging from 100-
5,000 copies at Nuts & Mudd in Ter
man, or in Green Library at the COPI
CARD sales office (hours: Monday-
Thursday, 1:00-4:30 p.m.). The Photo
copy Center, located at the Graduate
School of Business, may be used for
large copying jobs or when high quality
copying is desired.
Services for the
Physically Limited
The University Libraries staff is
committed to providing the opportu
nity for all members of the Stanford
community to benefit fully from library
resources and services. The Green and
Meyer libraries are accessible to per
sons with limited mobility and the
public service staff will be happy to
provide these patrons with hints on
accessing the collections. Not all
branch libraries are readily accessible,
so physically limited patrons should
call ahead to make arrangements that
are mutually satisfactory. All libraries
provide paging services.
Typewriters
Three coin-operated, self-correct
ing, electric typewriters are available
for use on the second floor of Meyer
Library.
