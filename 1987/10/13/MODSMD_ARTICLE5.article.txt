## South African author reads from work 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
Noted South African writer
Nadine Gordimer illustrated the
plight of South Africans living
under apartheid in a reading last
night from her latest novel, "A
Sport of Nature."
Gordimer is the author of over
60 short stories, novels and
books, most dealing with life in
South Africa.
"Nadine Gordimer is first and
last a writer, and not a propagan
dist, " Knglish Prof. John
L'Heureux told the crowd of
about 4(X) in his introduction of
Gordimer.
L'Heureux, director of the
Stanford Writing Program, noted
that because Gordimer writes
about the people of South Africa,
she must necessarily write about
apartheid.

"Apartheid is the world which
her characters inhabit," he said.
"She sees the essential weak
nesses of even good people, but
does not excuse them."
In the two excerpts Gordimer
read from her newly-published
novel, she portrayed the reac
tions to apartheid by two white
South Africans.
The first episode Gordimer
read described a couple that had
left South Africa so that the hus
band could serve in the
headquarters of the African Na
tional Congress, a South African
revolutionary group.
The wife, who is white, wit
nesses her black husband's as
sassination in their own kitchen.
The second excerpt is written
in the form of a letter to the same
woman several years later from
her cousin, with whom she had

had an affair about 20 years
before.
The cousin, the son of a white,
progressive mother, is in prison

for supporting the black cause in
South Africa.
He writes that "the reasons I
am in here are not negotiable.
You can t find justice in a
country with our kinds of laws."
Despite his seemingly
miserable situation ("All the
things you've read about have
happened to me."), he assures
his cousin that he's "always had
the feeling that I've won. From
jail, I'm free to say anything.
There's nothing more to dread, is
there?"
Gordimer is an honorary mem
ber of both the American Acad
emy of Art and Literature and
the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences and has received
numerous awards, including the
Italian Malaparte Prize and the
West German Nelly Sachs Prize.
She presently resides in West
Johannesburg, South Africa.
