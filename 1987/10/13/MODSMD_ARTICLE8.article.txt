MIT geneticist awarded Nobel Prize
Susumu Tonegawa, a Japanese-born geneticist at the Massa
chusetts Insitute of Technology, yesterday won the 1987 Nobel
Prize in Medicine for explaining how the immune system is able
to make a seemingly limitless variety of antibodies to protect the
body from foreign substances.
The $340,000 prize capped more than 11 years of work by
Tonegawa, 48, for research which has broad applications for un
derstanding diseases that attack the immune system, for coun
tering the body's natural response to reject transplanted organs
and for improving therapy for allergies and other immunological
disorders.
"1 hope the information we got will be useful in developing
responses to a number of diseases, including cancer and pos
sibly even AIDS," Tonegawa told a news conference in New
ton, Mass., that also was attended by his wife, Mayumi, and
their 9-month-old son, Hidde.
"If we understand how the (immune) system works, that in
formation will be helpful in understanding what (can go) wrong
with it,"he said.
Tonegawa is the first Nobel winner required by the Internal
Revenue Service to pay taxes on his prize. The tax revision law
enacted last year provides that scientific and literary awards are
subject to federal taxation unless the recipients give their win
nings to charity.
Soviets plan space shuttle launch
The Soviet Union plans to launch a space shuttle orbiter
similar to the vehicle built in the United States within the next
few years, several prominent aerospace experts said yesterday.
The Soviets, who are becoming increasingly open about their
once highly secret space program, invited about 500 people from
around the world to a two-day conference called the Space Fu
ture Forum in Moscow earlier this month. According to aero
space experts in this country, about 160 American space en
gineers, scientists and former astronauts were invited.
Aerospace experts and several industry trade publications
said that the Soviets offered some details of plans to launch a
space shuttle orbiter, possibly as early as 1989.
Aviation Week & Space Technology, a prestigious industry
trade publication, said in Monday's editions that the Soviets are
practicing takeoffs and landings with a jet-powered version of a
space shuttle in preparation for a flight. U.S. aerospace experts
said yesterday that the Soviet orbiter has flown four times from
a new 15,000-foot runway.
Aviation Week said that the first orbital flight is to be un
manned. Soviet officials are quoted in the magazine as saying
that the first flight will depend on how quickly problems with the
shuttle's flight-control system and booster rockets can be
solved.
Tutu critical of Reagan, Thatcher
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — Anglican Archbishop Des
mond Tutu has suggested that the United States and other
countries that have failed to apply adequate anti-apartheid pres
sure on South Africa be held accountable through punitive trade
measures, assuming power is eventually transferred to the black
majority.
.Tutu, a Nobel peace laureate who has been in the forefront of
advocating sanctions against South Africa, said that strategic
minerals could be withheld from countries with a poor
"preliberation" stance toward Pretoria.
"In the end, we are going to be free. We are going to have to
take account of who assisted us and who impeded us," Tutu
told a group of visiting journalists and news executives in his
Bishops Court residence Saturday night.
Tutu was sharply critical of President Reagan and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for not applying harsh
enough economic sanctions against South Africa. He said inef
fective measures had encouraged the government of President
Pieter W. Botha to drag its feet on power-sharing.
"You have got to make a moral decision. I'm not talking eco
nomics, I'm talking morality . . . The pre-liberation record will
be an important factor. We are going to be a country that got to
this point," said Tutu.
Tutu said some countries, including Sweden, Norway and
Denmark, had applied effective economic pressure on South
Africa, but he said large countries capable of forcing change had
taken inadequate measures.
Indian intervention proving costly
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Fierce fighting between Indian
troops and Tamil Tiger guerrillas raised death tolls on both sides
yesterday , increasing the bloody price that India is paying for
its military intervention in this island nation, according to Indian
and Sri Lankan officials.
The continued combat in densely populated areas also
produced concerns over civilian casualties.
India also moved yesterday against guerrilla camps across the
Palk Strait in the nearby Indian state of Tamil Nadu, seizing an
important communications center used by the Tigers to direct
fighting on the island, Indian news agencies reported.
Head-to-head fighting with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, largest and most powerful of the Tamil separatist guer
rilla groups, spread to the eastern region near Batticaloa, where
residents reported heavy artillery fire as a battle raged all yester
day afternoon.
"Since 11 this morning there has been an engagement be
tween the Liberation Tigers and the Indian peacekeeping force
near Morakottachenai (Batticaloa district)," said Indian
diplomat Laksmi Puri by evening, "Fighting is still continuing."
Battles also continued in three urban areas of the Jaffna pen
insula, including the old fort area of Jaffna city and the grounds
of a Hindu temple that Indian military officers were using as an
evacuation site for Tamil civilians.
Kansas 9 Alf Landon dead at 100
Death came yesterday to Alfred "Alf Landon, the plain
spoken Kansas Republican who lost the 1936 presidential elec
tion in an unprecedented landslide but won the enduring respect
and affection of his countrymen with his grace and dignity in
defeat.
Landon was 100 years old. He died at his home in the elegant
Colonial-style mansion he built on the outskirts of Topeka,
Kan., in 1937.
Physically vigorous until his l()th decade, Landon had been in
declining health since the spring of 1979.
He was hospitalized for several days in May 1979, after expe
riencing an irregular heart beat, and in January 1980, after expe
riencing a slight dizzy spell. In March 1980, he was afflicted with
a painful skin condition called shingles but remained active
around his 14-room home, kept a hand in his oil and radio en
terprises and maintained his lifelong and lively interest in
politics.

Soviets plan space shuttle launch
The Soviet Union plans to launch a space shuttle orbiter
similar to the vehicle built in the United States within the next
few years, several prominent aerospace experts said yesterday.
The Soviets, who are becoming increasingly open about their
once highly secret space program, invited about 500 people from
around the world to a two-day conference called the Space Fu
ture Forum in Moscow earlier this month. According to aero
space experts in this country, about 160 American space en
gineers, scientists and former astronauts were invited.
Aerospace experts and several industry trade publications
said that the Soviets offered some details of plans to launch a
space shuttle orbiter, possibly as early as 1989.
Aviation Week & Space Technology, a prestigious industry
trade publication, said in Monday's editions that the Soviets are
practicing takeoffs and landings with a jet-powered version of a
space shuttle in preparation for a flight. U.S. aerospace experts
said yesterday that the Soviet orbiter has flown four times from
a new 15,000-foot runway.
Aviation Week said that the first orbital flight is to be un
manned. Soviet officials are quoted in the magazine as saying
that the first flight will depend on how quickly problems with the
shuttle's flight-control system and booster rockets can be
solved.
Tutu critical of Reagan, Thatcher
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — Anglican Archbishop Des
mond Tutu has suggested that the United States and other
countries that have failed to apply adequate anti-apartheid pres
sure on South Africa be held accountable through punitive trade
measures, assuming power is eventually transferred to the black
majority.
.Tutu, a Nobel peace laureate who has been in the forefront of
advocating sanctions against South Africa, said that strategic
minerals could be withheld from countries with a poor
"preliberation" stance toward Pretoria.
"In the end, we are going to be free. We are going to have to
take account of who assisted us and who impeded us," Tutu
told a group of visiting journalists and news executives in his
Bishops Court residence Saturday night.
Tutu was sharply critical of President Reagan and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for not applying harsh
enough economic sanctions against South Africa. He said inef
fective measures had encouraged the government of President
Pieter W. Botha to drag its feet on power-sharing.
"You have got to make a moral decision. I'm not talking eco
nomics, I'm talking morality . . . The pre-liberation record will
be an important factor. We are going to be a country that got to
this point," said Tutu.
Tutu said some countries, including Sweden, Norway and
Denmark, had applied effective economic pressure on South
Africa, but he said large countries capable of forcing change had
taken inadequate measures.
Indian intervention proving costly
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Fierce fighting between Indian
troops and Tamil Tiger guerrillas raised death tolls on both sides
yesterday , increasing the bloody price that India is paying for
its military intervention in this island nation, according to Indian
and Sri Lankan officials.
The continued combat in densely populated areas also
produced concerns over civilian casualties.
India also moved yesterday against guerrilla camps across the
Palk Strait in the nearby Indian state of Tamil Nadu, seizing an
important communications center used by the Tigers to direct
fighting on the island, Indian news agencies reported.
Head-to-head fighting with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, largest and most powerful of the Tamil separatist guer
rilla groups, spread to the eastern region near Batticaloa, where
residents reported heavy artillery fire as a battle raged all yester
day afternoon.
"Since 11 this morning there has been an engagement be
tween the Liberation Tigers and the Indian peacekeeping force
near Morakottachenai (Batticaloa district)," said Indian
diplomat Laksmi Puri by evening, "Fighting is still continuing."
Battles also continued in three urban areas of the Jaffna pen
insula, including the old fort area of Jaffna city and the grounds
of a Hindu temple that Indian military officers were using as an
evacuation site for Tamil civilians.
Kansas 9 Alf Landon dead at 100
Death came yesterday to Alfred "Alf Landon, the plain
spoken Kansas Republican who lost the 1936 presidential elec
tion in an unprecedented landslide but won the enduring respect
and affection of his countrymen with his grace and dignity in
defeat.
Landon was 100 years old. He died at his home in the elegant
Colonial-style mansion he built on the outskirts of Topeka,
Kan., in 1937.
Physically vigorous until his l()th decade, Landon had been in
declining health since the spring of 1979.
He was hospitalized for several days in May 1979, after expe
riencing an irregular heart beat, and in January 1980, after expe
riencing a slight dizzy spell. In March 1980, he was afflicted with
a painful skin condition called shingles but remained active
around his 14-room home, kept a hand in his oil and radio en
terprises and maintained his lifelong and lively interest in
politics.

MIT geneticist awarded Nobel Prize
Susumu Tonegawa, a Japanese-born geneticist at the Massa
chusetts Insitute of Technology, yesterday won the 1987 Nobel
Prize in Medicine for explaining how the immune system is able
to make a seemingly limitless variety of antibodies to protect the
body from foreign substances.
The $340,000 prize capped more than 11 years of work by
Tonegawa, 48, for research which has broad applications for un
derstanding diseases that attack the immune system, for coun
tering the body's natural response to reject transplanted organs
and for improving therapy for allergies and other immunological
disorders.
"1 hope the information we got will be useful in developing
responses to a number of diseases, including cancer and pos
sibly even AIDS," Tonegawa told a news conference in New
ton, Mass., that also was attended by his wife, Mayumi, and
their 9-month-old son, Hidde.
"If we understand how the (immune) system works, that in
formation will be helpful in understanding what (can go) wrong
with it,"he said.
Tonegawa is the first Nobel winner required by the Internal
Revenue Service to pay taxes on his prize. The tax revision law
