HOUSTON —Vice President George Bush
officially declared his candidacy for the Re
publican presidential nomination here yester
day, calling on Americans to "remember who
we are," vowing not to raise their taxes, and
promising them "a taxpayer's bill of rights."
Addressing about 2000 applauding support
ers here where he launched his political
career two decades ago, Bush, flanked by his
wife, children and grandchildren, touched
only briefly on specific problems confronting
the nation. For the most part he sought in the
sober, 30-minute speech to establish a lofty
tone for his candidacy, an objective that ap
peared to reflect his status as the front-runner
in the struggle to become the GOP nominee.
The speech, which Bush read almost word
for word from a text prepared for a
Tele Prompter, also reflected the 63-year-old
Bush's reputation as a pragmatist and centrist
since nearly every specific point he made was
balanced by a counterpoint.
"We must continue — and accelerate —
our efforts to cut the federal budget deficit,"
he said. But he also told his audience that he
would not try to break the impasse over the
budget deficit "by breaking you. I am not
going to raise your taxes — period."
Similarly Bush declared that he did not
hate government and was proud of his own
long career in public service.
But he complained that "for too long the
rules of the game," including the authority of
the Internal Revenue Service "have been
cloaked in deliberate ambiguity."
He asserted that the time had come for "a
bill of rights that spells out explicitly what the
limits of IRS power are," and he promised to
"put the force of my presidency" behind the
proposal.
Looking abroad, the vice president hailed
the anticipated agreement with the Soviet
Union limiting intermediate-range nuclear
missiles as historic, and called for further
talks on "strategic arms, conventional weap

ons, chemical weapons, biological — all
those things."
But he cautioned that in dealing with the
Soviets the proper U.S. attitude should he:
'Praise God — and keep your guard up."
For the most part though Bush seemed de
termined to use the speech to demonstrate his
fitness to take advantage of what he de
scribed as "the incomparable opportunity"
offered by the presidency to exercise moral
leadership. Much of his rhetoric on this point
seemed aimed more at the general electorate,
which will decide the election November
1988, than at the Republican voters who will
choose among Bush and his five rivals for the
party's nomination.
"We don't need radical new directions,"
as a nation, he said. "We don't need to
remake society — we just need to remember
who we are."
While lauding the economic achievements
of the Reagan administration, Bush said that
what the nation needed was not just
prosperity, but "prosperity with a purpose."
He defined that as "helping your brothers
and sisters, whoever they are, wherever they
are, whatever their needs."
"Where is it written that Republicans must
act as if they do not care, as if they are not
moved?" he asked. "We are the party of Lin
coln. Our whole history was protecting those
who needed our protection and making this a
kinder nation."
Bush decried "those who have dropped
their standards along the way ... as if ethics
were too heavy and slowed their rise to the
top." He charged that there is "greed on
Wall Street and graft in City Hall and
influence-peddling in Washington — and it's
all so shameful."
Calling for a return to the early spirit of
America, Bush said "We weren't saints, but
we lived by standards." He warned: "We
make ourselves small by pursuing small

things. And I find myself saying to my
children: 'You've got to live by values if you
want to live a life of meaning.' "
Earlier in the day, chatting with reporters
aboard Air Force Two en route here from
Washington, Bush dismissed the notion ad
vanced by some of his aides that as of now he
has a new job, as candidate for president,
which would put his vice presidential duties
in second place. "I'll be both," he said,
though he conceded that he would have to oc
casionally "shift gears from the present to the
future."
Bush is the fifth Republican to declare for
the presidency, the others being New York
Rep. Jack Kemp, former Secretary of State
Alexander Haig Jr., former television evan
gelist Pat Robertson and former Delaware
Gov. Pierre "Pete" du Pont IV. Kansas Sen.
Bob Dole, regarded as Bush's chief rival for
the nomination, is planning to make his an
nouncement next month.
Bush's strategists are counting on the fa
vorable attention they anticipate the vice
president will receive during his weeklong an
nouncement trip to help offset the negative
impact of a series of recent events. First Bush
was embarrassed by Robertson, whose sup
porters outpointed Bush's backers in a much
heralded straw poll in the strategically vital
lowa battleground.
Next, Robertson embarrassed Bush again
by combining forces with Kemp to win a
procedural victory over Bush in Michigan,
threatening Bush with ultimate defeat when
that state's Republicans pick their delegation
to the national convention next January.
Then Bush embarrassed himself during a
trip to Europe, when in praising the skill of
Soviet mechanics he suggested that they
should be sent to Detroit, a notion that stirred
a predictable storm of protest and forced a
vice presidential apology.
