-He real world I.
»
Just as the university seems removed from the "real world", the reality of life
in a very different culture is also difficult to imagine while living in the familiar
environment of Stanford.
Volunteers in Asia provides an unparalleled opportunity for a student to
better understand part of this "real world." VIA volunteers go to China,
Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan to teach English, serve
as English resource persons, or work with appropriate technology.
Undergrads go for six or twelve months; graduates go for one or two years.
You don't need to know an Asian language when you apply and the
experience can be applied toward internship requirements in Human
Biology and International Relations.
\
As a volunteer, you live in an Asian setting (often as a member of an Asian
family) and become part of a local neighborhood. It can be a tough, mind
stretching, and patience-building experience. It also can bring some close
friendships and an education not found in books or within the confines of a
college campus.
So, get plugged in! If you're interested in an educational experience that will
broaden your view of the world, we'd like to talk with you about Volunteers in i
Asia. Also, come hear and visualize the VIA experience:
