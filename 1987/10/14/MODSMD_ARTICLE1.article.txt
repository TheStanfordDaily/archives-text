# Trustees OK additional divestment
## 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
Completing two days of meetings, the Stanford
Board of Trustees yesterday gave approval for
more divestment from three companies with hold
ings in South Africa, construction of new athletic,
art and computer science facilities and a $5.9 mil
lion expansion of Tresidder Memorial Union.
Upon the recommendation of the Commission on
Investment Responsibility (CIR), the Trustees Spe
cial Committee on Investment Responsibility
(SCIR) voted to divest from Air Express and Ferro
Corp. The University holdings in the two compan
ies total nearly $ 1 (H).(XK).
The board also voted to bar stock purchases of a
third company, CBl Industries, though the Univer
sity has already sold its shares in the company due
to other financial considerations.
A SCIR report attributed divestment to an unwill
ingness on the part of the companies to "work
actively for change in South Africa."
Operations Research Prof. Frederick Hillier, co
chair of CIR, said the Stanford portfolio presently
contains 43 companies with interests in South
Africa.
"That figure is a little over half of what it was a
year ago," Hillier said. "We are making progress."
The CIR, an advisory committee composed of
faculty, staff, students and alumni, reports to the
SCIR, a subcommittee of the Board of Trustees.
Hillier said the board is "very receptive" to the
ideas of the CIR.
The $35 million plan for long-range athletic ex
pansion will include two new athletic complexes de
signed to better accommodate all University stu
dents, faculty and staff, not just varsity athletes.
"The Athletic Department recognized the over
crowded conditions of athletic facilties and has
been anxious to improve for a long time," said Alan
Cummings, associate director of athletics.
According to the two-stage plan, the University
first will build the Athletics Quad East, a cluster of
buildings including a remodeled Old Pavilion and
Encina Gymnasium as well as a new fieldhouse.
In addition, a grassy amphitheater called Sports
Plaza will be constructed between Encina Gym and
the new fieldhouse.
The second complex, located near the Stanford
Barn, will include a 50-meter pool, basketball and
racquetball courts and other physical education
facilities. Tennis courts were recently constructed
at the site.
Cummings stressed the fact that the new facilities
will serve the entire Stanford community.
Cummings said $15 million in Centennial cam
paign funds was allocated for the new complexes.
"Right now we have $6 million in commitments,"
he said. "We hope the remainder of the funding will
come throughout the Centennial and over the next
10 years."
Cummings also said groundbreaking for the Ath
letics Quad East should begin early in 1989. The
quad will be complete by 1990.
