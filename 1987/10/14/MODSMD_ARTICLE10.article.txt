# Canada angry over subpoena
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Indepen
dent counsel Whitney North
Seymour Jr. has told the
Canadian government that unless
Ambassador Allan Gotlieb tes
tifies at the perjury trial of former
White House aide Michael
Deaver, prosecutors will be
"forced ... to place much
greater emphasis at trial on the
unlawful acts engaged in by
Deaver when he was working for
the Canadian government."
Seymour, who tried to sub
poena Gotlieb earlier this year,
renewed his attempts to obtain
the ambassador's testimony in an
Oct. 2 letter to Stuart Pierson, a
lawyer advising Canada. The let
ter has triggered outraged
protests from the Canadian gov
ernment, the State Department
and the Justice Department.
The Canadian Embassy, in a
blistering complaint to the State
Department last Friday, called
the letter a "shocking and ex
traordinary tactic" and said it
"wishes to protest in the
strongest terms this attempted in

timidation." External Affairs
Minister Joe Clark assailed
Seymour's action as "out
rageous."
State Department legal adviser
Abraham Sofaer yesterday wrote
Deputy Attorney General Arnold
Burns, saying that Seymour's ac
tions "have caused considerable
embarrassment to both the gov
ernments of the United States
and Canada."
Justice Department spokes
man Patrick Korten said Sey
mour had violated departmental
guidelines and an earlier agree
ment, reached after his attempt
to subpoena Gotlieb, that ap
proaches to foreign governments
would be made through
diplomatic channels. "We will go
to the court and ask them to in
sist that that agreeement on his
part be abided by," Korten said.
Seymour declined to comment
yesterday, saying, "It is obvi
ously a private letter."
Deaver is to go on trial Mon
day on five counts of lying to a
grand jury and a House subcom

mittee. One of the counts alleges
that Deaver lied to the grand jury
about the extent of his involve
ment with the acid rain problem
before he resigned as deputy
White House chief of staff to
work as a lobbyist.
In June, U.S. District Court
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
quashed Seymour's attempt to
subpoena the ambassador and his
wife, Sondra Gotlieb, to testify at
Deaver's trial, ruling that Gotlieb
was shielded by diplomatic im
munity and had not waived that
immunity by agreeing to answer
written questions from Seymour.
Seymour argued that Gotlieb is
a "key prosecution" witness
whose testimony is "essential."
The indictment alleges that
Deaver falsely testified that he
did not recall a Jan. 5, 1985, lun
cheon with the Gotliebs, which
occurred while Deaver was still
at the White House and the
United States and Canada were
preparing for a summit at which
acid rain was to be a major issue.
"The stark fact is that there

are no available witnesses to tes
tify about Denver's crucial lun
cheon meeting,"' Seymour said in
court papers. "Only four persons
were present: Mr. and Mrs.
Deaver and Mr. and Mrs. Got
lieb. . . . Mrs. Deaver cannot be
expected to testify against her
husband. That leaves exacty two
witnesses: Ambassador Gotlieb
and his wife."
In the letter to Pierson,
Seymour said the Canadian gov
ernment's refusal "to permit
even limited testimony by Am
bassador Gotlieb has forced us to
place much greater emphasis at
trial on the unlawful acts engaged
in by Deaver when he was
working for the Canadian gov
ernment, including his various
contacts with Drew Lewis
(President Reagan's envoy on
acid rain) and the River Club
meeting on Oct. 25, 1985, in
which Mr. Gotlieb and Mr.
(Fred) Doucet (an aide to Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney) partici
pated."

the letter a "shocking and ex
traordinary tactic" and said it
"wishes to protest in the
strongest terms this attempted in

timidation." External Affairs
Minister Joe Clark assailed
Seymour's action as "out
rageous."
State Department legal adviser
Abraham Sofaer yesterday wrote
Deputy Attorney General Arnold
Burns, saying that Seymour's ac
tions "have caused considerable
embarrassment to both the gov
ernments of the United States
and Canada."
Justice Department spokes
man Patrick Korten said Sey
mour had violated departmental
guidelines and an earlier agree
ment, reached after his attempt
to subpoena Gotlieb, that ap
proaches to foreign governments
would be made through
diplomatic channels. "We will go
to the court and ask them to in
sist that that agreeement on his
part be abided by," Korten said.
Seymour declined to comment
yesterday, saying, "It is obvi
ously a private letter."
Deaver is to go on trial Mon
day on five counts of lying to a
grand jury and a House subcom

mittee. One of the counts alleges
that Deaver lied to the grand jury
about the extent of his involve
ment with the acid rain problem
before he resigned as deputy
White House chief of staff to
work as a lobbyist.
In June, U.S. District Court
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
quashed Seymour's attempt to
subpoena the ambassador and his
wife, Sondra Gotlieb, to testify at
Deaver's trial, ruling that Gotlieb
was shielded by diplomatic im
munity and had not waived that
immunity by agreeing to answer
written questions from Seymour.
Seymour argued that Gotlieb is
a "key prosecution" witness
whose testimony is "essential."
The indictment alleges that
Deaver falsely testified that he
did not recall a Jan. 5, 1985, lun
cheon with the Gotliebs, which
occurred while Deaver was still
at the White House and the
United States and Canada were
preparing for a summit at which
acid rain was to be a major issue.
"The stark fact is that there

are no available witnesses to tes
tify about Denver's crucial lun
cheon meeting,"' Seymour said in
court papers. "Only four persons
were present: Mr. and Mrs.
Deaver and Mr. and Mrs. Got
lieb. . . . Mrs. Deaver cannot be
expected to testify against her
husband. That leaves exacty two
witnesses: Ambassador Gotlieb
and his wife."
In the letter to Pierson,
Seymour said the Canadian gov
ernment's refusal "to permit
even limited testimony by Am
bassador Gotlieb has forced us to
place much greater emphasis at
trial on the unlawful acts engaged
in by Deaver when he was
working for the Canadian gov
ernment, including his various
contacts with Drew Lewis
(President Reagan's envoy on
acid rain) and the River Club
meeting on Oct. 25, 1985, in
which Mr. Gotlieb and Mr.
(Fred) Doucet (an aide to Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney) partici
pated."
