# Doctor speaks on AIDS
## 
### Burke Smith Staff writer 
Noted cancer and AIDS re
searcher Dr. Robert Gallo was
cautiously optimistic about the
possibility of developing an
AIDS vaccine but warned
about the potential spread of a
closely linked leukemia virus.
Although unwilling to spec
ulate on when a vaccine might
be available, Gallo told a Medi
cal Center audience last night
he "wouldn't be shocked if we
had a vaccine in three or five
years.'' But he added, "I also
wouldn't be shocked if we
didn't see a vaccine until the
next century."
Gallo, chief of the National
Institute of Health Laboratory
of Tumor Cell Biology, headed
the team which discovered the
virus responsible for Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS) and developed an accu
rate method of detecting it.
Gallo also focused on the
roadblocks currently prevent
ing discovery of a vaccine. One
of the major problems facing
any possible vaccine is the
complicated nature of the
AIDS virus, he said.
AIDS researchers are also
hampered by a shortage of
suitable animal subjects for im
portant testing. The AIDS virus
can only effect "a given chimp,
which is on the endangered
species list,'' Gallo said.
"Unable to end on a positive
note" regarding any potential
vaccine, Gallo admittedly con
tradicted many scientists pre
dicting the discovery of a suc
cessful vaccine within the next
decade. Gallo pointed to the
fact that "no animal has been
successfully vaccinated."
Gallo cited statistics showing
the predominance of a leu
kemia virus in intravenous drug
users. In some cases, 50 per

cent of intravenous drug users
tested carried the leukemia
virus while as little as .5 per
cent carried the AIDS virus.
The rapid spread of viral in
fections among intravenous
drug users is a national prob
lem, and far more must be done
beyond the U.S. Surgeon Gen
eral's "education program," he
said.
"If it involves going into the
population and providing clean
needles and syringes, educating
those people to the risks," it
must be done, Gallo said.
Noting the rapid spread of a
virus for which "transmission
is very difficult," Gallo said the
psychological desire of risk
groups to maintain their
lifestyles caused them to be
lieve incorrect theories about
the disease. People looked for
"evidence that if you just

changed your lifestyle a little
bit, you would be all right," he
said.
Gallo reiterated the long-held
belief that AIDS is not an easily
transmittable disease. Al
though "no one can rule out the
freak event," Gallo said the
disease is generally spread by
sexual contact, use of dirty
needles, blood transfusions,
and from mother to unborn
child.
Gallo said that recently
publicized cases involving two
laboratory workers who be
came inexplicably infected with
the virus are isolated cases of
either poor technique or faulty
protective equipment.
Gallo advocated complete
testing of the nation's blood
supply for all viruses in the
same category as the AIDS
virus.
