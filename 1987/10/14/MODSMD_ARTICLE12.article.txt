# Hostel plans discussed
## 
### Mary Elizabeth McNitt 
The fate of the proposed con
version of a Palo Alto house into
a youth hostel will remain un
settled until a Nov. 5 settlement
meeting between American
Youth Hostels and area residents
who are opposed to the move.
A hearing on the issue
scheduled for today was can
celled after the City of Palo Alto
decided not to contest a tempo
rary restraining order that
blocked the renovation of the
house and its access road.
If the November meeting
proves inconclusive, the renova
tions will be delayed again until a
trial hearing on March I.

In early September, the city
approved a request by the
Golden Gate Council of Ameri
can Youth Hostels to renovate a
building — known to locals as
"The House' — that sits in the
599-acre Arastradero Preserve in
the Stanford Foothills. Improve
ments were also slated for John
Marthens Lane, the access road
to the building.
Judge Read Ambler issued a
restraining orcer on Sept. 28
after residents 01 the lane submit
ted a petition claiming that the
renovations were unacceptable.
Residents Paul and Kathryn
Reimer, Robert and Betty Jo
Davis, John and Rosemary

Young and Gregory and Kim
berly McCarthy complained that
the proposed improvements were
not sufficient to ensure safety on
the "steep and narrow" road
leading to the house.
Paul Reimer suggested that the
city either "improve the road to
standards that would be safe or
build a road through their own
property."
The residents' complaint cited
fear of noise pollution, fire, van
dalism, health risks and environ
mental damage.
Reimer and his neighbors con
tended that the renovations
would also result in soil erosion,
run-off and contamination of tho
surrounding grasslands.
