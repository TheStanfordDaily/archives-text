### 
The Daily has called before for the elimination
of the housed fraternity system at Stanford. Our
complaints have fallen into two broad
categories: those problems inherent in the sys
tem and those which can, perhaps, be altered.
This past week we were pleased — and surprised
— to see the Interfraternity Council establish
task forces to explore the latter category of prob
lems.
We commend the IFC for recognizing the
problems of alcohol abuse and minority under
representation in the fraternity system and for
creating special committees to address these is
sues.
However, we are skeptical about the task
forces' ability to effectively correct these prob
lems. The line between those evils largely inher
ent in the fraternity system, such as sexism, and
those that are correctable is a thin one.
Even theoretically alterable problems like al
cohol abuse and minority under-represeutation
are so much a part of the housed fraternity sys
tem that it seems unlikely they can be cleared up

through a simple in-house investigation.
There are, however, two obvious ways in
which the fraternities could act to bring about ef
fective reform.
• First, Rush should be completely dry. For no
other class of University residence is drinking an
almost compulsory part of the application proc
ess (by peer pressure and/or tradition, if not by
rule). Members thus initiated into fraternity life
will naturally tend to overemphasize alcohol.
• Second, the IFC task force on minority issues
should work closely with the newly created Uni
versity Committee on Minority Affairs to
resolve minority problems related to fraternities.
The Commission should be able to help the fra
ternities become more representative, or at least
to create an atmosphere less likely to passively
foster racism.
We are skeptical; but we are also encouraged
by the IFC's action and willing to be surprised.
We hope the IFC is serious about reform and
that its new task forces on alcohol abuse and
minority issues will take their jobs seriously.
