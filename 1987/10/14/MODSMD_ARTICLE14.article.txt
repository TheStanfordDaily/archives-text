# A 						very real oppression
## 
### 
It was one of those "only in California" kind of
stories you read about in the Chronicle from time to
time.
The article was about the growing men's move
ment, and, quite frankly, I thought the whole idea
of a men's movement to be more than a little ludi-

crous. We men are, after all, so oppressed. Right.
We are forced to control the economic, political
and, in most sects, religious power structures of
our society. The women, gays and racial minorities
and their movements just don't seem to understand
the essential angst of the straight white male in
American society and how hard we try to feel bad
about the societal dominance we have to struggle
so subtly to maintain. 1 tell you, it makes me want
to go grab some brews with the bros for some sym
pathetic male bonding whenever I think about just
how oppressed we are.
Now, don't misunderstand me. The societal
problems that continue to inhibit the lives of
women and minorities are much more important in
virtually every way than the oppression faced by
men.
However, the "oppression'" of men is pervasive
and largely unexamined, and, furthermore, may
well be inextricably linked to why progress in these
other issues has been so impeded. Men are emo
tionally repressed. Men must not cry.
I think it's fairly well agreed that men are dis
couraged in such ways from displaying their emo
tions, and yet I believe that the harm that such re
pression causes to our society is not generally un
derstood. There is this vague notion that if emo
tions are not adequately vented, they may "build
up," causing occasional, untoward outbursts. This
kind of argument is used to explain such things as
suicide, violent crime, spouse abuse and so on,
and, while there is a large amount of evidence to
support such a theory, to believe that the harm of
emotional repression is limited to such explicit pa
thologies is an error. Emotional repression affects
our lives every day in surprisingly concrete ways.
Contrary to popular opinion, men need to
nurture and be nurtured in relationships other than
sexual ones. In fact, to place the entire burden of

emotional support on any lover is an excellent way
to create a perfectly stifling and constrictive rela
tionship guaranteed to self-destruct rapidly. I know
I've lost my share of girlfriends that way. We must,
therefore, strive to eliminate prejudice against
gays, not because of the social inequities it creates
for that 10 percent of the population, but because it
interferes with our own lives as men, our own
happiness and our own well-being.
Another way emotional repression affects our
lives is that it gives us a rather peculiar idea of what
it means to be strong. In a society where displaying
emotions is an unmistakable sign of weakness (Pat
Schroeder is, after all, one of the weaker sex, so
what did you expect?), the manner in which you
display your power and influence must be through
calculation and aggression, rather than cooperation
and empathy. We are competitive in virtually every
aspect of our lives precisely because we are taught
that the fundamental acts of affection, sharing and
intimacy must be limited to a rather constrictive set
of acceptable relationships.
Our success in life is measured, not by how many
we can care for. but by how many we can best, not
by how well we can supports but by how well we
can use. and not by how happy we are7V>ut by how
successful we appear. We have bought the idea that
force and strength are the same thing, and yet if
strength is truly our capacity to affect desirable
changes in any situation, then force and coercion,
competition and aggression are certainly limited
tools indeed.
I believe that real strength resides in self
knowledge and the capacity to realize the potential
of situations, and both of these components are
impeded by the prohibition against the sharing of
our hearts.
Emotions are not a shame, and expressing those
emotions is neither abnormal nor weak. The key to
what the men's movement is all about is not activ
ism, but rather about actively trying to change our
personal attitudes by becoming more open to
sharing our emotional lives with others, starting to
question the humor in vicious jokes about gays and
beginning to realize the strength inherent in accept
ing our emotional vulnerability as men and as
humans.
Men, all of us, are blessed with a fantastic
capacity to care at a primal, visceral level about
ourselves, about our world and about each other.
We have the right to laugh, the right to fear, the
right to love.
We have the right to cry.
