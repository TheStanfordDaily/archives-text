## A 						profound, healthy religious questioning 
### 
I read with interest the article by Leslie
Kaufman about dorm-based Bible study. I
expect there will be a flurry of ardently
argued pros and cons. The thoughts and per
ceptions expressed in the article are impor
tant ones for a dorm to discuss and share
opinions about.

I am not sure where I personally come out
on the issue of Bible studies in dorms, but her
article moved my thinking away from the is
sues she initially raises. Posing the issue as to
whether there should be dorm-based Bible
studies misses what I think is the heart of the
issue: that is, the place of religion in an insti
tution of higher education and, particularly,
how religion is cast here at Stanford.
I share many of the perceptions expressed
by Leslie, and have my own frustrations
about groups that exclude and divide people
into neat, but false, groupings. Easy self
righteousness and narrow truth-confirmation
are not healthy attributes for any learning and
growing endeavor, be it geology or theology.
Yet, they unfortunately often exist in both.
We must be honest and vigilant in avoiding
them wherever they may exist both around
and in us.
However, I am bothered by something else

and make the above points, in all probability,
only to make a further one. I see no reason
why Christian Bible studies must foster
"strains of isolation and religious competi
tiveness and closemindedness" (although I
am not taking issue with the accuracy of
Leslie's descriptions).
1 know of groups that find in the study of
the Bible not simple answers to simply con
structed questions, but rather the tools for
constructing searching questions of meaning
and for illuminating profound personal
struggles. I know of people who, in the study
of the Bible, experience not the comfort of
self-assuring certainty, but rather encounter
the mystery of God s ways and an intensify
ing of life's journey. But I don't find many of
these kind of Bible studies at Stanford.
Religion, and particularly Christianity at
Stanford, has been restricted to a very nar
row form of expression. 1 have worked on the
Stanford campus for 11 years, and I have
known only a few people who are interested
in the mosaic of forms and expressions that
Christianity has been and still is.
I have not found much of a voracious
hunger for learning from the experiences and
theologies of, for example, Latin Americans
and feminists — yet these two groups have al
tered significantly the Church's liturgy and
worship and, even more fundamentally, its
self-understanding. I have not discovered the
creative interplay that is currently happening

in churches between philosophy and science
and theology (1 don't mean creationism and
evolution) around the serious issues of peace
and justice, nor about the sensitive feelings
and concerns of sexuality.
I overstate the case. I do know such Chris
tians. However, they feel for the most part
overwhelmed by and alienated from a
dominating identity of what being a Christian
entails that they do not share. I do not blame
the "Christians" entirely for this. I blame
equally a campus ambience that can see no
place for encouraging the exploration of reli
gion, can find no intellectual value for it and
would like to segment religion from all truly
worthwhile academic activity.
Such an attitude only encourages the com
partmentalization of religion, out of which
the things that trouble Leslie arise. Finally, I
blame myself. Maybe I have not been the role
model that I might have been and have not
found the ways to encourage a more open and
creative Christianity on campus.
I have been troubled by these things for
some time. For what it is worth, 1 don't find
Leslie to be at all anti-religious. Quite the
contrary, I discovered in her article a
profound religious questioning that I think is
quite healthy. I hope that there will be more
of this kind of thinking at Stanford, and 1
thank Leslie for stirring the Spirit in me.

by Leslie, and have my own frustrations
about groups that exclude and divide people
into neat, but false, groupings. Easy self
righteousness and narrow truth-confirmation
are not healthy attributes for any learning and
growing endeavor, be it geology or theology.
Yet, they unfortunately often exist in both.
We must be honest and vigilant in avoiding
them wherever they may exist both around
and in us.
However, I am bothered by something else

and make the above points, in all probability,
only to make a further one. I see no reason
why Christian Bible studies must foster
"strains of isolation and religious competi
tiveness and closemindedness" (although I
am not taking issue with the accuracy of
Leslie's descriptions).
1 know of groups that find in the study of
the Bible not simple answers to simply con
structed questions, but rather the tools for
constructing searching questions of meaning
and for illuminating profound personal
struggles. I know of people who, in the study
of the Bible, experience not the comfort of
self-assuring certainty, but rather encounter
the mystery of God s ways and an intensify
ing of life's journey. But I don't find many of
these kind of Bible studies at Stanford.
Religion, and particularly Christianity at
Stanford, has been restricted to a very nar
row form of expression. 1 have worked on the
Stanford campus for 11 years, and I have
known only a few people who are interested
in the mosaic of forms and expressions that
Christianity has been and still is.
I have not found much of a voracious
hunger for learning from the experiences and
theologies of, for example, Latin Americans
and feminists — yet these two groups have al
tered significantly the Church's liturgy and
worship and, even more fundamentally, its
self-understanding. I have not discovered the
creative interplay that is currently happening

in churches between philosophy and science
and theology (1 don't mean creationism and
evolution) around the serious issues of peace
and justice, nor about the sensitive feelings
and concerns of sexuality.
I overstate the case. I do know such Chris
tians. However, they feel for the most part
overwhelmed by and alienated from a
dominating identity of what being a Christian
entails that they do not share. I do not blame
the "Christians" entirely for this. I blame
equally a campus ambience that can see no
place for encouraging the exploration of reli
gion, can find no intellectual value for it and
would like to segment religion from all truly
worthwhile academic activity.
Such an attitude only encourages the com
partmentalization of religion, out of which
the things that trouble Leslie arise. Finally, I
blame myself. Maybe I have not been the role
model that I might have been and have not
found the ways to encourage a more open and
creative Christianity on campus.
I have been troubled by these things for
some time. For what it is worth, 1 don't find
Leslie to be at all anti-religious. Quite the
contrary, I discovered in her article a
profound religious questioning that I think is
quite healthy. I hope that there will be more
of this kind of thinking at Stanford, and 1
thank Leslie for stirring the Spirit in me.
