## A 						hypocrisy in our values 
### 
In the United States most people believe that
each individual should have the right to life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness. When the people of
another country do not share this same ideal, many
of us have a hard time understanding.

As Soviet journalist Vladimir Pozner stated in his
speech to the Stanford community last Thursday,
we believe these rights to be "God-given."
Pozner and many Soviet people have a different
conception of the rights each citizen should pos
sess. They believe in such things as the rights to
work, to have an education, and to have a roof over
their heads. "Without these things," Pozner
stated, "freedom of speech means nothing. "
The people of the United States and the Soviet
Union have fundamental differences: cultural, his
torical, economic, and most of all, ideological. To
suggest, as many do, that the way to a peaceful re
lationship between our two countries is for them to
adopt our ideals ignores these basic disparities be
tween our respective citizens.
Within the framework of their ideals, the Soviets
have begun to ease much of the oppression that has
stifled their economic, as well as intellectual ad
vancement. Surely the Soviets' new "glasnost"
policies may seem like superficial, even token,
concessions being used simply to garner a more
positive media image; but beyond *he obvious, -
there do seem to be deeper, more monumental
changes occurring within the Soviet Union.
So how do we, as United States citizens, encour
age this progress? It is very hard for the United
States to assist and cooperate with the Soviet Un
ion when we (and 1 speak for the majority) not only

mistrust them, but also harbor great animosity
toward their differing ideals. This is evident in all
forms of American mass media that, by focusing
predominantly on the negative aspects of the So
viet Union, portray the government as cunning and
devious and the people as oppressed and unwilling
prisoners.
This same overwhelming media bias occurs in
the Soviet Union, as Pozner freely admitted, where
the media emphasize the many problems of our
United States (i.e. crime, poverty, unemployment).
The point is that the truth is accessible, and it is
our responsibility to seek it. Surely, we have many
reasons to find great fault with the Soviet govern
ment, be it human rights violations, aggressive mili
tary policies or ecological exploitation; but we
must also consider the part our own government
plays in these very same evils. By striving to attain
a more balanced view, we may come to understand
that very rarely does the fault lie completely on one
side or the other and that positive solutions can
only be effected through mutual efforts and com
promise.
There is an obvious need for more responsible
journalism, but the accuracy of our media is only a
reflection of our desire for the truth. Our first step
toward a reconciliation with the Soviet Union is to
realize that a passive acceptance of the animosity
that has been erected between us serves as a silent
approval of our government s current method of
addressing our differences, namely the full-scale
production of larger and more efficient nuclear
weaponry.
Our willingness to complacent about dis
covering tfi'e truth and our insistence on perpetuat
ing the myth that the Soviet Union is some sort of
''evil empire" displays a hypocrisy in the very
values we profess, reduces any hope of global
peace and amplifies the potential for mutual and
total destruction.
