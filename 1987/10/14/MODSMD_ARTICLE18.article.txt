School's policy
perfectly adequate
The editorial in Thursday's
Daily declared that the Law
School's non-discrimination
policy is inadequate. In regard to
the Law School's allowing the
firm of Baker & McKenzie to
recruit on campus, this policy
was perfectly adequate.
The case of the former attor
ney who claims to have been
fired for having AIDS is still in
court in New York. The New

York State Department of
Human Rights deemed the claim
meritorious. It may well appear
so without the defendant's tes
timony, which is still being pre
sented. The court has made no
decision in favor of the plaintiff.
It is totally unfair to bar a firm,
not proven guilty of an atrocity
such as firing an attorney for
having AIDS, from recruiting on
campus.
The Daily was either sloppy in
its research or deliberately
ignored crucial facts, implying
that Baker & McKenzie is guilty
of discrimination. This implica

tion is a twisted presumption in
favor of the plaintiff.
Furthermore, the claimant
worked in Baker & McKenzie's
New York office, which does not
even recruit at Stanford. The San
Francisco office, which does
recruit at Stanford, had nothing
to do with the tiring of an associ
ate in New York.
If and when the courts find
Baker & McKenzie or any other
firm guilty of discrimination,
only then should Stanford con
sider prohibiting that firm from
recruiting.
