## Chilean may return to homeland Exile lifted for Stanford professor 
### Ben Wecht 
Fourteen years ago, Prof. Fer
nando Alegria of Stanford's
Spanish and Portuguese Depart
ment was forced out of his home
in his native Chile. He was finally
allowed to return this summer.
Alegria is a Chilean novelist
and poet, and the event that
forced him from his home was
the 1973 military coup in which
the country's government was
overthrown by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet Ugarto.
At that time, Alegria was
working as the cultural attache to
the Chilean Embassy in Wash
ington, D.C., where he served
until the coup. Alegria was ap
pointed to the position by a close
friend, Dr. Salvador Allende
Gossens, then-president of Chile.
"Keeping me out of Chile for
13 years was an act of blind
cruelty," Alegria said of his
exile.
It was "an attempt to cut me
off from the mainstream of
Chilean cultural and social life,
[but | it didn't work. My books
continue to be read by young
people, my poems are published
in cassettes, books and journals
in Chile," he said.
Alegria learned in August that
he would be allowed to return to
Chile when he wished. The news
came to him during a trip to Chile
on a 30-day visa that was granted
by the government.
During his stay, a Chilean
radio station telephoned him,
asking him if he would listen to
an official announcement and
then make a brief statement.
The announcement reported
that 28 previously exiled
Chileans were free to enter and

leave the country at will.
Alegria's name was the first on
the list, the latest of several pub
lished by the Chilean government
over the last few years.
According to Alegria, his
change in status resulted from
the combined efforts of the
Chilean Human Rights Commis
sion, the Catholic Church of San
tiago and the Vicary of Solidarity
in Chile.
"My first reaction was of great
happiness, and I decided to cele
brate with all my friends,"

Alegria said. "But then I realized
that I had only received permis
sion to stay in my own home. It is
a very strange feeling to be told
that."
Alegria first came to the
United States in the early 1940s
to study at UC-Berkeley. He
earned his doctorate in romance
languages in 1947 and taught at
UC-Berkeley until 1968, when he
came to Stanford.
On Sept. 4, 1973, Alegria left
Washington for Chile to inter
view Allende for a biography he

was writing on the president.
Within a week the government
had been overthrown, Allende
was dead and Alegria had been
placed on a list of persons
prohibited from re-entering
Chile.
It is a period of time that the
writer is reluctant to discuss.
According to Alegria, there
was never any official reason
given for his exile.
"I was never accused of any
thing," explained Alegria, who is
continuing to work on his book
about Allende. "Obviously, they
were punishing people who made
statements against the political
situation in Chile and partici
pated in demonstrations to
protest the abuses against human
rights.
"I suppose the fact that I
served as counselor and cultural
attache in the embassy of Chile
during the Allende government
counted against me in the eyes of
the military government," he
said.
One of the most serious and
far-reaching implications of the
coup was the introduction of cen
sorship, a political reality com
mon to many dictatorships.
Alegria described the parameters
of cultural freedom in Chile as
"an invisible chalk circle where
the lines move constantly.
"You can say pretty much
what you want, but then, all of a
sudden, a particular issue of a
magazine might disappear, for
example, and those involved in
its writing will be arrested." he
said.
"From the cultural viewpoint,
there is a clearly defined pater

lifted recently, plans to divide his time between Chile and California,
both of which he calls home.
