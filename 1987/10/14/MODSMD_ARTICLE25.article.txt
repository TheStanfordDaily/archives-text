## Chilean may return to homeland Exile lifted for Stanford professor 
### Ben Wecht 
Fourteen years ago, Prof. Fer
nando Alegria of Stanford's
Spanish and Portuguese Depart
ment was forced out of his home
in his native Chile. He was finally
allowed to return this summer.
Alegria is a Chilean novelist
and poet, and the event that
forced him from his home was
the 1973 military coup in which
the country's government was
overthrown by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet Ugarto.
At that time, Alegria was
working as the cultural attache to
the Chilean Embassy in Wash
ington, D.C., where he served
until the coup. Alegria was ap
pointed to the position by a close
friend, Dr. Salvador Allende
Gossens, then-president of Chile.
"Keeping me out of Chile for
13 years was an act of blind
cruelty," Alegria said of his
exile.
It was "an attempt to cut me
off from the mainstream of
Chilean cultural and social life,
[but | it didn't work. My books
continue to be read by young
people, my poems are published
in cassettes, books and journals
in Chile," he said.
Alegria learned in August that
he would be allowed to return to
Chile when he wished. The news
came to him during a trip to Chile
on a 30-day visa that was granted
by the government.
During his stay, a Chilean
radio station telephoned him,
asking him if he would listen to
an official announcement and
then make a brief statement.
The announcement reported
that 28 previously exiled
Chileans were free to enter and

leave the country at will.
Alegria's name was the first on
the list, the latest of several pub
lished by the Chilean government
over the last few years.
According to Alegria, his
change in status resulted from
the combined efforts of the
Chilean Human Rights Commis
sion, the Catholic Church of San
tiago and the Vicary of Solidarity
in Chile.
"My first reaction was of great
happiness, and I decided to cele
brate with all my friends,"

Alegria said. "But then I realized
that I had only received permis
sion to stay in my own home. It is
a very strange feeling to be told
that."
Alegria first came to the
United States in the early 1940s
to study at UC-Berkeley. He
earned his doctorate in romance
languages in 1947 and taught at
UC-Berkeley until 1968, when he
came to Stanford.
On Sept. 4, 1973, Alegria left
Washington for Chile to inter
view Allende for a biography he

was writing on the president.
Within a week the government
had been overthrown, Allende
was dead and Alegria had been
placed on a list of persons
prohibited from re-entering
Chile.
It is a period of time that the
writer is reluctant to discuss.
According to Alegria, there
was never any official reason
given for his exile.
"I was never accused of any
thing," explained Alegria, who is
continuing to work on his book
about Allende. "Obviously, they
were punishing people who made
statements against the political
situation in Chile and partici
pated in demonstrations to
protest the abuses against human
rights.
"I suppose the fact that I
served as counselor and cultural
attache in the embassy of Chile
during the Allende government
counted against me in the eyes of
the military government," he
said.
One of the most serious and
far-reaching implications of the
coup was the introduction of cen
sorship, a political reality com
mon to many dictatorships.
Alegria described the parameters
of cultural freedom in Chile as
"an invisible chalk circle where
the lines move constantly.
"You can say pretty much
what you want, but then, all of a
sudden, a particular issue of a
magazine might disappear, for
example, and those involved in
its writing will be arrested." he
said.
"From the cultural viewpoint,
there is a clearly defined pater

nalistic dictatorship, where they
tell you, 'Do and say what you
want, but watch out.' And the
results depend on the way you
take their advice," he added.
Alegria described the people
who monitor the arts and deter
mine what is and is not appropri
ate for publication as "unknown
commisars, nameless czars who
work in offices without doors and
without windows. You experi
ence their power when copies of
your books get burned in the
streets or go rotten in wet base

ments of police headquarters.
"In order to survive," Alegria
said, "a newspaper in Chile must
play according to the rules of the
game imposed from above."
He described the recent efforts
of a Chilean magazine, "Apsi,"
to publish an issue devoted to
humor in the life of President
Pinochet. Its editor and assistant
editor were arrested, and the
issue was never published.
"Publishing a newspaper un
der a dictatorship," Alegria ex
plained, "is like putting out a
weather report in the Sahara
Desert. 'Clear, warm and sunny,'
they say. The reader knows this
means hell."
According to Alegria, how
ever, this censorship has in

directly created a large and thriv
ing underground movement, both
in literature and the fine arts. He
said the creation of such an un
derground is inevitable under a
dictatorship.
"If you touch upon certain
subjects that are unofficially
taboo and you know that in doing
so you are running the risk of
being imprisoned and perhaps
tortured and exiled .... then
you know that you've become a
writer of the underground."
According to Alegria, the un
derground in Chile is a thriving
community. "Young writers,"
he said, "are changing the tone
of the Chilean literary discourse
. . . A new voice and a new view
of social problems is emerging,
slowly, but in such a powerful
way that it will transcend the
limitations imposed on Chilean
literature by censorship."
He predicted that "five, 10 or
20 years from now, people are
going to realize that there was a
great movement going on in
terms of artistic expression."
Alegria said he is not a political
writer. "1 am not what one might
call a traditional realist," he said,
"but 1 never forget the reality of
Latin American society when 1
am writing. You cannot ignore
the facts that mold the characters
in your stories, the circum
stances that make them silent or
vociferous, the quality of life that

makes of their days and nights a
never-ending nightmare."
Alegria's work includes nov
els, poetry, literary criticism and
essays. Among his books are
"The Fun House," "Chilean
Spring," "Instructions for
Undressing the Human Race"
and "War Chorale."

Chile for 13 years

cruelty.'
— Fernando Alegria

Alegria said he is not inter
ested in propagandizing any
thing, provoking anyone or pass
ing judgment on anyone's politics
in Chile. However, Alegria is
willing to discuss Chilean
politics, including the ban on po
litical opposition parties that
Pinochet lifted this March after
10 years.
"My sense is that by lifting this
ban. Gen. Pinochet, or those who
are advising him, are acting in a
very clever manner," Alegria
said, "because the more political
leaders he allows to be active in
the country, the more divided the
opposition will be."

According to Alegria, Chileans
would like to see a new form of
government replace their current
martial government. Most
Chileans want unity, he said.
"They want social and economic
justice. They want human rights.
They want peace and democ
racy," he said. "What kind of
democracy? The only one that
makes sense — democracy with
freedom, with direct elections
and the right to disagree."
Alegria, who is married with
four grown children and six
grandchildren, all of whom live in
the United States, said he plans
to retire next year and devote
himself to his writing. His inten
tion is to commute between Chile
and California, both of which he
considers home.
In addition, he recently sold
the movie rights for one of his
novels. The movie will be called
"My Horse, Gonzalez," and will
be filmed in San Francisco in the
near future. He is also continuing
work on the Allende biography
that he began 14 years ago.
Trying to define what life in
exile has meant to him, Alegria
quoted the Chilean poet Pablo
Neruda: "Exile is the worst pun
ishment against an individual, be
cause it never ends."
That's particularly true in the
case of Chile, Alegria said: "You
might find yourself still exiled
when you get home."

Fourteen years ago, Prof. Fer

your books get burned in the

ments of police headquarters.
"In order to survive," Alegria
said, "a newspaper in Chile must
play according to the rules of the
game imposed from above."
He described the recent efforts
of a Chilean magazine, "Apsi,"
to publish an issue devoted to
humor in the life of President
Pinochet. Its editor and assistant
editor were arrested, and the
issue was never published.
"Publishing a newspaper un
der a dictatorship," Alegria ex
plained, "is like putting out a
weather report in the Sahara
Desert. 'Clear, warm and sunny,'
they say. The reader knows this
means hell."
According to Alegria, how
ever, this censorship has in

directly created a large and thriv
ing underground movement, both
in literature and the fine arts. He
said the creation of such an un
derground is inevitable under a
dictatorship.
"If you touch upon certain
subjects that are unofficially
taboo and you know that in doing
so you are running the risk of
being imprisoned and perhaps
tortured and exiled .... then
you know that you've become a
writer of the underground."
According to Alegria, the un
derground in Chile is a thriving
community. "Young writers,"
he said, "are changing the tone
of the Chilean literary discourse
. . . A new voice and a new view
of social problems is emerging,
slowly, but in such a powerful
way that it will transcend the
limitations imposed on Chilean
literature by censorship."
He predicted that "five, 10 or
20 years from now, people are
going to realize that there was a
great movement going on in
terms of artistic expression."
Alegria said he is not a political
writer. "1 am not what one might
call a traditional realist," he said,
"but 1 never forget the reality of
Latin American society when 1
am writing. You cannot ignore
the facts that mold the characters
in your stories, the circum
stances that make them silent or
vociferous, the quality of life that

makes of their days and nights a
never-ending nightmare."
Alegria's work includes nov
els, poetry, literary criticism and
essays. Among his books are
"The Fun House," "Chilean
Spring," "Instructions for
Undressing the Human Race"
and "War Chorale."

'Keeping me out of
Chile for 13 years
was an act of blind
cruelty.'
— Fernando Alegria

Alegria said he is not inter
ested in propagandizing any
thing, provoking anyone or pass
ing judgment on anyone's politics
in Chile. However, Alegria is
willing to discuss Chilean
politics, including the ban on po
litical opposition parties that
Pinochet lifted this March after
10 years.
"My sense is that by lifting this
ban. Gen. Pinochet, or those who
are advising him, are acting in a
very clever manner," Alegria
said, "because the more political
leaders he allows to be active in
the country, the more divided the
opposition will be."

According to Alegria, Chileans
would like to see a new form of
government replace their current
martial government. Most
Chileans want unity, he said.
"They want social and economic
justice. They want human rights.
They want peace and democ
racy," he said. "What kind of
democracy? The only one that
makes sense — democracy with
freedom, with direct elections
and the right to disagree."
Alegria, who is married with
four grown children and six
grandchildren, all of whom live in
the United States, said he plans
to retire next year and devote
himself to his writing. His inten
tion is to commute between Chile
and California, both of which he
considers home.
In addition, he recently sold
the movie rights for one of his
novels. The movie will be called
"My Horse, Gonzalez," and will
be filmed in San Francisco in the
near future. He is also continuing
work on the Allende biography
that he began 14 years ago.
Trying to define what life in
exile has meant to him, Alegria
quoted the Chilean poet Pablo
Neruda: "Exile is the worst pun
ishment against an individual, be
cause it never ends."
That's particularly true in the
case of Chile, Alegria said: "You
might find yourself still exiled
when you get home."

Fourteen years ago, Prof. Fer
nando Alegria of Stanford's
Spanish and Portuguese Depart
ment was forced out of his home
in his native Chile. He was finally
allowed to return this summer.
Alegria is a Chilean novelist
and poet, and the event that
forced him from his home was
the 1973 military coup in which
the country's government was
overthrown by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet Ugarto.
At that time, Alegria was
working as the cultural attache to
the Chilean Embassy in Wash
ington, D.C., where he served
until the coup. Alegria was ap
pointed to the position by a close
friend, Dr. Salvador Allende
Gossens, then-president of Chile.
"Keeping me out of Chile for
13 years was an act of blind
cruelty," Alegria said of his
exile.
It was "an attempt to cut me
off from the mainstream of
Chilean cultural and social life,
[but | it didn't work. My books
continue to be read by young
people, my poems are published
in cassettes, books and journals
in Chile," he said.
Alegria learned in August that
he would be allowed to return to
Chile when he wished. The news
came to him during a trip to Chile
on a 30-day visa that was granted
by the government.
During his stay, a Chilean
radio station telephoned him,
asking him if he would listen to
an official announcement and
then make a brief statement.
The announcement reported
that 28 previously exiled
Chileans were free to enter and

leave the country at will.
Alegria's name was the first on
the list, the latest of several pub
lished by the Chilean government
over the last few years.
According to Alegria, his
change in status resulted from
the combined efforts of the
Chilean Human Rights Commis
sion, the Catholic Church of San
tiago and the Vicary of Solidarity
in Chile.
"My first reaction was of great
happiness, and I decided to cele
brate with all my friends,"

Alegria said. "But then I realized
that I had only received permis
sion to stay in my own home. It is
a very strange feeling to be told
that."
Alegria first came to the
United States in the early 1940s
to study at UC-Berkeley. He
earned his doctorate in romance
languages in 1947 and taught at
UC-Berkeley until 1968, when he
came to Stanford.
On Sept. 4, 1973, Alegria left
Washington for Chile to inter
view Allende for a biography he

was writing on the president.
Within a week the government
had been overthrown, Allende
was dead and Alegria had been
placed on a list of persons
prohibited from re-entering
Chile.
It is a period of time that the
writer is reluctant to discuss.
According to Alegria, there
was never any official reason
given for his exile.
"I was never accused of any
thing," explained Alegria, who is
continuing to work on his book
about Allende. "Obviously, they
were punishing people who made
statements against the political
situation in Chile and partici
pated in demonstrations to
protest the abuses against human
rights.
"I suppose the fact that I
served as counselor and cultural
attache in the embassy of Chile
during the Allende government
counted against me in the eyes of
the military government," he
said.
One of the most serious and
far-reaching implications of the
coup was the introduction of cen
sorship, a political reality com
mon to many dictatorships.
Alegria described the parameters
of cultural freedom in Chile as
"an invisible chalk circle where
the lines move constantly.
"You can say pretty much
what you want, but then, all of a
sudden, a particular issue of a
magazine might disappear, for
example, and those involved in
its writing will be arrested." he
said.
"From the cultural viewpoint,

ment was forced out of his home
in his native Chile. He was finally
allowed to return this summer.
Alegria is a Chilean novelist
and poet, and the event that
forced him from his home was
the 1973 military coup in which
the country's government was
overthrown by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet Ugarto.
At that time, Alegria was
working as the cultural attache to
the Chilean Embassy in Wash
ington, D.C., where he served
until the coup. Alegria was ap
pointed to the position by a close
friend, Dr. Salvador Allende
Gossens, then-president of Chile.
"Keeping me out of Chile for
13 years was an act of blind
cruelty," Alegria said of his
exile.
It was "an attempt to cut me
off from the mainstream of
Chilean cultural and social life,
[but | it didn't work. My books
continue to be read by young
people, my poems are published
in cassettes, books and journals
in Chile," he said.
Alegria learned in August that
he would be allowed to return to
Chile when he wished. The news
came to him during a trip to Chile
on a 30-day visa that was granted
by the government.
During his stay, a Chilean
radio station telephoned him,
asking him if he would listen to
an official announcement and
then make a brief statement.
The announcement reported
that 28 previously exiled
Chileans were free to enter and

leave the country at will.
Alegria's name was the first on
the list, the latest of several pub
lished by the Chilean government
over the last few years.
According to Alegria, his
change in status resulted from
the combined efforts of the
Chilean Human Rights Commis
sion, the Catholic Church of San
tiago and the Vicary of Solidarity
in Chile.
"My first reaction was of great
happiness, and I decided to cele
brate with all my friends,"

Alegria said. "But then I realized
that I had only received permis
sion to stay in my own home. It is
a very strange feeling to be told
that."
Alegria first came to the
United States in the early 1940s
to study at UC-Berkeley. He
earned his doctorate in romance
languages in 1947 and taught at
UC-Berkeley until 1968, when he
came to Stanford.
On Sept. 4, 1973, Alegria left
Washington for Chile to inter
view Allende for a biography he

was writing on the president.
Within a week the government
had been overthrown, Allende
was dead and Alegria had been
placed on a list of persons
prohibited from re-entering
Chile.
It is a period of time that the
writer is reluctant to discuss.
According to Alegria, there
was never any official reason
given for his exile.
"I was never accused of any
thing," explained Alegria, who is
continuing to work on his book
about Allende. "Obviously, they
were punishing people who made
statements against the political
situation in Chile and partici
pated in demonstrations to
protest the abuses against human
rights.
"I suppose the fact that I
served as counselor and cultural
attache in the embassy of Chile
during the Allende government
counted against me in the eyes of
the military government," he
said.
One of the most serious and
far-reaching implications of the
coup was the introduction of cen
sorship, a political reality com
mon to many dictatorships.
Alegria described the parameters
of cultural freedom in Chile as
"an invisible chalk circle where
the lines move constantly.
"You can say pretty much
what you want, but then, all of a
sudden, a particular issue of a
magazine might disappear, for
example, and those involved in
its writing will be arrested." he
said.
"From the cultural viewpoint,
there is a clearly defined pater

lifted recently, plans to divide his time between Chile and California,
both of which he calls home.
nalistic dictatorship, where they
tell you, 'Do and say what you
want, but watch out.' And the
results depend on the way you
take their advice," he added.
Alegria described the people
who monitor the arts and deter
mine what is and is not appropri
ate for publication as "unknown
commisars, nameless czars who
work in offices without doors and
without windows. You experi
ence their power when copies of
your books get burned in the
streets or go rotten in wet base

ments of police headquarters.
"In order to survive," Alegria
said, "a newspaper in Chile must
play according to the rules of the
game imposed from above."
He described the recent efforts
of a Chilean magazine, "Apsi,"
to publish an issue devoted to
humor in the life of President
Pinochet. Its editor and assistant
editor were arrested, and the
issue was never published.
"Publishing a newspaper un
der a dictatorship," Alegria ex
plained, "is like putting out a
weather report in the Sahara
Desert. 'Clear, warm and sunny,'
they say. The reader knows this
means hell."
According to Alegria, how
ever, this censorship has in

directly created a large and thriv
ing underground movement, both
in literature and the fine arts. He
said the creation of such an un
derground is inevitable under a
dictatorship.
"If you touch upon certain
subjects that are unofficially
taboo and you know that in doing
so you are running the risk of
being imprisoned and perhaps
tortured and exiled .... then
you know that you've become a
writer of the underground."
According to Alegria, the un
derground in Chile is a thriving
community. "Young writers,"
he said, "are changing the tone
of the Chilean literary discourse
. . . A new voice and a new view
of social problems is emerging,
slowly, but in such a powerful
way that it will transcend the
limitations imposed on Chilean
literature by censorship."
He predicted that "five, 10 or
20 years from now, people are
going to realize that there was a
great movement going on in
terms of artistic expression."
Alegria said he is not a political
writer. "1 am not what one might
call a traditional realist," he said,
"but 1 never forget the reality of
Latin American society when 1
am writing. You cannot ignore
the facts that mold the characters
in your stories, the circum
stances that make them silent or
vociferous, the quality of life that

makes of their days and nights a
never-ending nightmare."
Alegria's work includes nov
els, poetry, literary criticism and
essays. Among his books are
"The Fun House," "Chilean
Spring," "Instructions for
Undressing the Human Race"
and "War Chorale."

Chile for 13 years

cruelty.'

Alegria said he is not inter
ested in propagandizing any
thing, provoking anyone or pass
ing judgment on anyone's politics
in Chile. However, Alegria is
willing to discuss Chilean
politics, including the ban on po
litical opposition parties that
Pinochet lifted this March after
10 years.
"My sense is that by lifting this
ban. Gen. Pinochet, or those who
are advising him, are acting in a
very clever manner," Alegria
said, "because the more political
leaders he allows to be active in
the country, the more divided the
opposition will be."

According to Alegria, Chileans
would like to see a new form of
government replace their current
martial government. Most
Chileans want unity, he said.
"They want social and economic
justice. They want human rights.
They want peace and democ
racy," he said. "What kind of
democracy? The only one that
makes sense — democracy with
freedom, with direct elections
and the right to disagree."
Alegria, who is married with
four grown children and six
grandchildren, all of whom live in
the United States, said he plans
to retire next year and devote
himself to his writing. His inten
tion is to commute between Chile
and California, both of which he
considers home.
In addition, he recently sold
the movie rights for one of his
novels. The movie will be called
"My Horse, Gonzalez," and will
be filmed in San Francisco in the
near future. He is also continuing
work on the Allende biography
that he began 14 years ago.
Trying to define what life in
exile has meant to him, Alegria
quoted the Chilean poet Pablo
Neruda: "Exile is the worst pun
ishment against an individual, be
cause it never ends."
That's particularly true in the
case of Chile, Alegria said: "You
might find yourself still exiled
when you get home."

ment was forced out of his home
in his native Chile. He was finally
