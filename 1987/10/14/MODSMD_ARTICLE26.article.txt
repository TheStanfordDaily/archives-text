# Center stresses date rape danger
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Staff writer 
An unidentified man called
the "ski mask rapist," who
has assaulted over 21 women
in the Peninsula area since last
April, is not as dangerous to
the public as less conspicuous
acquaintance rapists, accord
ing to Palo Alto Rape Crisis
Center Coordinator Laurie
Wedemeyer.
Acquaintance rapists are
more worrisome than attack
ers like the "ski mask rapist''
because they can assault more
people and never be accused,
Wedemeyer said, adding that
80 percent of all rapes are
committed by a person who
knows the victim.
Wedemeyer urged students
to stay alert to potential rape
acquaintance relationships.
"Someone who does not listen
to what you need, and some
one who displays a lot of angry
behavior are [the people] to
watch out for," she said.
"One in four women will be
sexually assaulted by age 18,"
Wedemeyer said. That statis
tic is especially relevant to
Stanford undergraduates, be
cause students may have been
sexually abused at home and
cannot come to terms with the
situation until they are away at
school, she added.
The Rape Crisis Center and
an on-campus program called
the Rape Education Project
are designed to help students
in that process of coming to
terms with rape.
Wedemeyer said she feared

that Stanford students affected
by rape rarely get the counsel
ing they need. "Stanford stu
dents feel like they have to he
tougher (than most people)
and feel had about asking for
help," she said. "They will
make the initial appointments
(at the crisis center) and do not
follow through (with counsel
ing) because they think it is a
sign of weakness."
According to Wedemeyer,
one Stanford student was as
saulted last spring break when
she left a bar alone. A man at
tacked her in the parking lot of
the bar, and she had difficulty
freeing herself.
The woman came to Palo
Alto's Rape Crisis Center and
used Wedemeyer as a sound
ing board to re-enact the inci
dent but never came back for
more help.
A male Stanford student
came to the crisis center last
year to talk to Wedemeyer
about his girlfriend, who was
just then remembering an in
cestuous relationship from her
childhood. "He didn't really
understand how to respond to
her sexually and came for
help" more than once,
Wedemeyer said.
Unlike that student, who
was willing to discuss his
problem, Stanford students
generally avoid discussing the
issue of rape, according to
Wedemeyer. "Stanford stu
dents really don't want to talk
about rape," she said.
Established in 1974, Palo
Alto's Rape Crisis Center is open
to Palo Alto residents and mem
bers of the Stanford community
who need help coping with the
trauma of rape.
Wedemeyer and her staff of 40
trained volunteers man the cen
ter's 24-hour rape crisis hotline,
accompany victims to the hospi
tal and police station, and pro
vide short-term counseling for
rape victims-
Wedemeyer stressed the cen
ter's availability to Stanford stu
dents. "We are off campus, so
we are completely confidential
and we will see people three to
five times for no charge," she
said.
Education, rather than coun
seling, is the primary purpose of
the Rape Education Project
(REP) at Stanford.
Rape is an unavoidable issue,
said Ted Des Maisons, a spokes
man for the Rape Education Proj
ect.
REP staff members help stu
dents confront the reality of rape
throughout the year by traveling
from dorm to dorm with a video
entitled "Rethinking Rape" and
leading discussions after the film,
Des Maisons said.

that Stanford students affected
by rape rarely get the counsel
ing they need. "Stanford stu
dents feel like they have to he
tougher (than most people)
and feel had about asking for
help," she said. "They will
make the initial appointments
(at the crisis center) and do not
follow through (with counsel
ing) because they think it is a
sign of weakness."
According to Wedemeyer,
one Stanford student was as
saulted last spring break when
she left a bar alone. A man at
tacked her in the parking lot of
the bar, and she had difficulty
freeing herself.
The woman came to Palo
Alto's Rape Crisis Center and
used Wedemeyer as a sound
ing board to re-enact the inci
dent but never came back for
more help.
A male Stanford student
came to the crisis center last
year to talk to Wedemeyer
about his girlfriend, who was
just then remembering an in
cestuous relationship from her
childhood. "He didn't really
understand how to respond to
her sexually and came for
help" more than once,
Wedemeyer said.
Unlike that student, who
was willing to discuss his
problem, Stanford students
generally avoid discussing the
issue of rape, according to
Wedemeyer. "Stanford stu
dents really don't want to talk
about rape," she said.
Established in 1974, Palo
Alto's Rape Crisis Center is open
to Palo Alto residents and mem
bers of the Stanford community
who need help coping with the
trauma of rape.
Wedemeyer and her staff of 40
trained volunteers man the cen
ter's 24-hour rape crisis hotline,
accompany victims to the hospi
tal and police station, and pro
vide short-term counseling for
rape victims-
Wedemeyer stressed the cen
ter's availability to Stanford stu
dents. "We are off campus, so
we are completely confidential
and we will see people three to
five times for no charge," she
said.
Education, rather than coun
seling, is the primary purpose of
the Rape Education Project
(REP) at Stanford.
Rape is an unavoidable issue,
said Ted Des Maisons, a spokes
man for the Rape Education Proj
ect.
REP staff members help stu
dents confront the reality of rape
throughout the year by traveling
from dorm to dorm with a video
entitled "Rethinking Rape" and
leading discussions after the film,
Des Maisons said.
