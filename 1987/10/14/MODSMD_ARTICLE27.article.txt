## Three Broadway hits liven up S.F. theaters 
### Marc Borsak 
A cockney Englishman, a
group of tap-dancing nuns and a
trio of talented performers sing
ing about love are the principal
characters in three musicals cur
rently playing in San Francisco.
"Me and My Girl," starring
Tim Curry of "Rocky Horror
Picture Show" fame, opened last
Thursday at the Golden Gate
Theater, "Nunsense" has been
playing at the Marines Memorial
Theater since June, and
"Starting Here, Starting Now" is
nearing the end of its four-week
engagement at the Waterfront
Theater in Ghirardelli Square.
The biggest of the three pro
ductions is "Me and My Girl," a
lavishly produced piece of fluff
which originally was staged in
London in 1937 and then revived
there in 1985 in its present in
carnation.
It was brought to New York in
August, 1986, and has been
playing to packed houses there
since its opening. This national
touring production proves a
worthy companion to the produc
tions in New York and London.
Director Mike Ockrent must
be credited with the success of
"Me and My Girl." The material
he is working with is certainly
not all that exciting or original. A
cockney man finds that he is the
inheritor of a large fortune and is
now a wealthy lord. Of course,
he must be educated and marry
within the proper social class,
jeopardizing his relationship with
Sally, the cockney girl of the
play's title.
Ockrent somehow manages to
find charm in all this nonsense
and brings it bubbling right up to
the play's surface. What could
have been a tired period piece
comes alive as a whimsical jaunt

to a time when musicals made no
claims to self-importance.
In the role of Bill Snibson,
Curry is a charming leading man,
delivering his jokes with the
relish of a child in a candy store,
and he has a pleasant voice with
which to deliver composer Noel
Gay's lilting melodies. As Sally,

Donna Bullock is less mem
orable, although she too has a
pleasant voice.
Gillian Gregory's choreog
raphy is fast and athletic, espe
cially in the hyperactive en
semble numbers, and Chris
Walker's brassy orchestrations
add a bang to the more ordinary

numbers. "Me and My Girl" will
be at the Golden Gate Theater
through Dec. 13.
"Nunsense," a thoroughly ir
reverent and unrelentingly hys
terical little musical, lies on the
borderline between good-natured
offensiveness and true rudeness.
It is, however, a rousing time for
all.
The Little Sisters of Hoboken,
as our friendly nuns call them
selves, have a big problem. Their
infamous chef made some soup
that killed 52 nuns instantly.
Forty-eight of the deceased nuns
were buried, but then Mother Su
perior decided to buy a Betamax
video recorder, leaving no
money in the convent bank ac
count to pay for burial of the four
remaining sisters.
The convent also runs the
Mount St. Helens Catholic
School, where the remaining
sisters decide to stage a show to
raise money so they can bury the
remaining bodies, which are tem
porarily residing in the basement
freezer.
It sounds rather macabre, but
all the better; these singing,
dancing, foot-stomping nuns
show everyone one helluva good
time. Maybe it's those songs:
"Nunsense is Habit-Forming,"
"Tackle that Temptation With a
Time Step," "We've Got to
Clean Out the Freezer" and the
rousing "Holier than Thou."
Marilyn Farina and Semina
DeLaurentis of the original New
York cast are both excellent as
Sisters Mary Cardelia and Mary
Amnesia, respectively, and
Sharon McNight sings up a storm
during the final number.
Dan Goggin directs in the true
spirit of his material, straddling
the fence between camp and mu
sical comedy, and choreographer
Felton Smith keeps the nuns

spinning, shimmying and kicking
throughout the evening. The
humor is low, but the laughs are
hearty, and "Nunsense" is
worth a visit. It will be at the
Marines Memorial Theater indef
initely.
"Starting Here, Starting
Now" is an entertaining revue
made up of songs written by
Richard Maltby Jr. and David
Shire for various earlier col

laborations.
The show was first produced in
the mid-1970s off-Broadway,
where it did quite well, and has
been produced hundreds of times
since then in various locales. It
purports to tell about love, rela
tionships and self-awareness,
and though one may not learn
much from the show, the songs

are still pretty, and the three
leads form an attractive trio.
Karen Mason, Faith Prince
and Brent Barrett are all talented
performers with many credits to
their names. Mason has a power
ful alto voice which is perfect on
songs like the hard-edged "What
About Today" and the humorous
"Crossword Puzzle." Prince
shows great cornedic talent as a
makeup counter attendant at
Bloomingdale's singing "I'm
Going to Make you Beautiful,"
and also puts across soft songs
like "Autumn" with just the right
amount of poignancy.
Barrett is a handsome leading
man with a pleasant tenor voice
that comes across best in"I
Don't Remember Christmas," a
bitter song about a failed rela
tionship.
In a minimalist show like this
one, production design and
choreography are quite impor
tant. In this production, the sets
by Scale Design and the
costumes by Stanley Simmons
are rather lackluster. The second
act costumes are especially un
flattering. The choreography, al
though cute, also lacks the
originality seen in other produc
tions of this show.

characters in three musicals cur
rently playing in San Francisco.
"Me and My Girl," starring
Tim Curry of "Rocky Horror
Picture Show" fame, opened last
Thursday at the Golden Gate
Theater, "Nunsense" has been
playing at the Marines Memorial
Theater since June, and
"Starting Here, Starting Now" is
nearing the end of its four-week
engagement at the Waterfront
Theater in Ghirardelli Square.
The biggest of the three pro
ductions is "Me and My Girl," a
lavishly produced piece of fluff
which originally was staged in
London in 1937 and then revived
there in 1985 in its present in
carnation.
It was brought to New York in
August, 1986, and has been
playing to packed houses there
since its opening. This national
touring production proves a
worthy companion to the produc
tions in New York and London.
Director Mike Ockrent must
be credited with the success of
"Me and My Girl." The material
he is working with is certainly
not all that exciting or original. A
cockney man finds that he is the
inheritor of a large fortune and is
now a wealthy lord. Of course,
he must be educated and marry
within the proper social class,
jeopardizing his relationship with
Sally, the cockney girl of the
play's title.
Ockrent somehow manages to
find charm in all this nonsense
and brings it bubbling right up to
the play's surface. What could
have been a tired period piece
comes alive as a whimsical jaunt

to a time when musicals made no
claims to self-importance.
In the role of Bill Snibson,
Curry is a charming leading man,
delivering his jokes with the
relish of a child in a candy store,
and he has a pleasant voice with
which to deliver composer Noel
Gay's lilting melodies. As Sally,

Donna Bullock is less mem
orable, although she too has a
pleasant voice.
Gillian Gregory's choreog
raphy is fast and athletic, espe
cially in the hyperactive en
semble numbers, and Chris
Walker's brassy orchestrations
add a bang to the more ordinary

numbers. "Me and My Girl" will
be at the Golden Gate Theater
through Dec. 13.
"Nunsense," a thoroughly ir
reverent and unrelentingly hys
terical little musical, lies on the
borderline between good-natured
offensiveness and true rudeness.
It is, however, a rousing time for
all.
The Little Sisters of Hoboken,
as our friendly nuns call them
selves, have a big problem. Their
infamous chef made some soup
that killed 52 nuns instantly.
Forty-eight of the deceased nuns
were buried, but then Mother Su
perior decided to buy a Betamax
video recorder, leaving no
money in the convent bank ac
count to pay for burial of the four
remaining sisters.
The convent also runs the
Mount St. Helens Catholic
School, where the remaining
sisters decide to stage a show to
raise money so they can bury the
remaining bodies, which are tem
porarily residing in the basement
freezer.
It sounds rather macabre, but
all the better; these singing,
dancing, foot-stomping nuns
show everyone one helluva good
time. Maybe it's those songs:
"Nunsense is Habit-Forming,"
"Tackle that Temptation With a
Time Step," "We've Got to
Clean Out the Freezer" and the
rousing "Holier than Thou."
Marilyn Farina and Semina
DeLaurentis of the original New
York cast are both excellent as
Sisters Mary Cardelia and Mary
Amnesia, respectively, and
Sharon McNight sings up a storm
during the final number.
Dan Goggin directs in the true
spirit of his material, straddling
the fence between camp and mu
sical comedy, and choreographer
Felton Smith keeps the nuns

spinning, shimmying and kicking
throughout the evening. The
humor is low, but the laughs are
hearty, and "Nunsense" is
worth a visit. It will be at the
Marines Memorial Theater indef
initely.
"Starting Here, Starting
Now" is an entertaining revue
made up of songs written by
Richard Maltby Jr. and David
Shire for various earlier col

laborations.
The show was first produced in
the mid-1970s off-Broadway,
where it did quite well, and has
been produced hundreds of times
since then in various locales. It
purports to tell about love, rela
tionships and self-awareness,
and though one may not learn
much from the show, the songs

are still pretty, and the three
leads form an attractive trio.
Karen Mason, Faith Prince
and Brent Barrett are all talented
performers with many credits to
their names. Mason has a power
ful alto voice which is perfect on
songs like the hard-edged "What
About Today" and the humorous
"Crossword Puzzle." Prince
shows great cornedic talent as a
makeup counter attendant at
Bloomingdale's singing "I'm
Going to Make you Beautiful,"
and also puts across soft songs
like "Autumn" with just the right
amount of poignancy.
Barrett is a handsome leading
man with a pleasant tenor voice
that comes across best in"I
Don't Remember Christmas," a
bitter song about a failed rela
tionship.
In a minimalist show like this
one, production design and
choreography are quite impor
tant. In this production, the sets
by Scale Design and the
costumes by Stanley Simmons
are rather lackluster. The second
act costumes are especially un
flattering. The choreography, al
though cute, also lacks the
originality seen in other produc
tions of this show.
Overall, however, "Starting
Here, Starting Now" is an enter
taining. if modest, revue and the
Waterfront Theater is a pleasant,
