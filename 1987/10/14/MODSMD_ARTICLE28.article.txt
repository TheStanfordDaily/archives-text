# Mill Valley fest has its own Hollywood glitz
## 
### Mark Tompkins Editorial Staff 
It's a rewarding experience,
going to a film festival. You ex
pect to stride through the
proceedings with an air of disaf
fection, with a seen-it-all pose
preventing you from gawking at
anything. But then, of course,
you catch sight of some
recognized luminary, and all
your iconoclastic impulses imme
diately get chucked out the win
dow.
This happened to me at the
10th Annual Mill Valley Film
Festival last Saturday. Upon
seeing actors like Harry Dean
Stanton and Edward James
Olmos (Lt. Castillo on "Miami
Vice"), I suddenly felt like the
Mill Valley correspondent for
Tiger Beat. The adolescent girls
who were there shrieked "Oh my
God, it's Castillo!" on seeing
Olmos. Actually, it wasn't quite
that bad, but it was close.
The most glamorous people
there were the glitzy, laquered
Marin County locals, if we ac
cept funny new haircuts and
clothes that should be on Top 40
radio as a definition of glamor.
Harry Dean Stanton, on the
other hand, seemed to have
barely dusted himself off from
some Sam Shepard landscape
before coming to Mill Valley. In
other words, he looked as mar
velously grungy as ever when
yours truly spotted him trying on
clothes in the local Banana
Republic.
Seeing a favorite actor try on
the latest trendy safari gear is a
difficult experience to top, so I
settled for a seminar on

"Pitching: The Do's and Don'ts
of Presenting Your Project." The
seminar was basically a two-hour
panel discussion by various Hol
lywood production heads on how
would-be writers, directors and
producers can catch their atten
tion.
The seminar did have an
enthralling subtext, namely that
of pleading desperation on the
audience's part. There were doz
ens of clenched-fist, feverish
looking characters wandering
around, each inevitably carrying
a briefcase loaded with copies of
the screenplay that had lan
guished in their grandmother's
attic for years and years.
During a break in the discus
sion, the panelists were besieged
by these people asking to have
their scripts read. It was the kind
of situation that never fails to dis
comfort everyone involved.
The panelists themselves were
no less entertaining. The star was
undoubtedly John Daly, chair
man of Hemdale Films, the com
pany that financed "Platoon,"
"Salvador," "Platoon," "Riv
er's Edge," "Hoosiers" and, as
the moderator kept informing us,
"Platoon." An independent
company, Hemdale is fast be
coming known as a maker of low
budget, high-quality films that
turn a profit.
In short, it's everyone's dream
film company. Thus, at times the
whole seminar verged on becom
ing one huge John Daly Appreci
ation Society, and perhaps
deservedly so. Daly was a model
of British decorum and seemed
genuinely sympathetic with the
audience's interests.
Another panelist was Mara

Manus, Stanford class of '81 and
a production vice president for
Universal Studios. Manus was a
communications major, thereby
disproving the belief that com
munications as a major is a bot
tomless pit from which no one
ever emerges again.
The alleged moderator was
RKO Pictures Vice President
Barbara Boyle, whose grating
style provided an abject lesson in
how brittle personalities can
become after long years in show
business. Boyle specialized in
cutting off other panelists before
they could answer the audience's
questions.
A few key themes emerged
from what the panelists said.
Apart from the issue of min
imized risk — Hollywood's
guiding principle — the panelists
acknowledged film production's
vicious circle, in which it's im

possible for new talent to get ex
perience when film companies
will only listen to ideas from ex
perienced talent.
Would-be writers did receive a
few dollops of useful information
on how to sell their works (i.e.
how to seduce the executives).
Scripts should be literate,
professional-looking, should not
require a $40 million budget,
should not be written for specific
stars, and so on.
In pitching an idea, the
panelists said, writers should
also pitch the sub-text or under
lying theme of their material.
Presumably the thought of a sub
text helps the production heads
feel better about some of the
movies they summon into being.
Overall, it was hard not to feel
a bit cynical about the seminar.
While it was kind of John Daly to
walk off with an armload of

amateur scripts, which he
promised to look through, too of
ten the panelists seemed to con
sider themselves to be creative
talents, as if writers and directors
were beholden to them, rather
than vice versa.
Worse, there was a lot of big
talk about "integrity," "great
ideas," and "passion" in the
movies being made today, as if
every film were a "Salvador" or
"Platoon." The question of Hol
lywood venality, as in "Howard
the Duck" or "Beverly Hills Cop
II," was never discussed.
As if in answer to this, I later
got to see a project in which in
tegrity and passion were more
than just catch phrases.
"Walking On Water," based on a
true story, tells how in 1982 a
Bolivian math teacher turns
around the lives of a group of
Hispanic kids in a run-down.

East Los Angeles high school.
The teacher (played by Ed
ward James Olmos with a star
tling, De Niro-like change in
physical appearance) runs into
racism and seeming resistance
when he does so, all of which the
movie captures. Made by two
Hispanic UCLA grads, the film
cost $1 million. (That's one
fortieth the cost of "lshtar." The
moral should be blindingly obvi
ous).
Members of the cast and crew
were present after the screening
to answer questions, and my hair
stood on end when Olmos ap
peared. The star of "Zoot Suit"
and"The Ballad of Gregorio
Cortez" was dressed all in white,
completely different from his
doom-laden Lt. Castillo role on
"Miami Vice."
As Castillo, for example,
Olmos doesn't just do something
— he stands there. Few actors
today can suggest so much with
so little, or seem so intense
onscreen, which is why it was so
much fun to see him in the tlesh,
beaming at his many well
wishers.
In his presence one feels oddly
elevated. It's exhilirating — the
feeling. I imagine, that a film fes
tival hopes to provide. So much
for that seen-it-all pose.
The Mill Valley Film Festival
continues today and concludes
tomorrow with more seminars,
screenings and chances to gawk
at famous people. It's just over
the Golden Gate Bridge, and all
the events are reasonably low
priced. A schedule of events is
available at Tresidder or any
HASS ticket outlet.
