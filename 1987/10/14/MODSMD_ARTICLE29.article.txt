# CDs revive forgotten classical works
## 
### Jose Bowen 
Classical music has seen a
phenomenal resurgence in recent
years as a direct result of the in
credible sound quality made pos
sible by compact discs. How
ever, with 30 or more CD ver
sions of Beethoven's Symphony
No. 9, a new recording of that
work must compete simultane
ously against the great perfor
mances of today as well as
against recordings made over the
last 40 years. Besides, you can
only hear so many versions of the
same thing before your ears start
to melt down.
This has led to a movement to
rediscover forgotten works of
earlier periods. There are many
"new" old CD recordings that
are not only high-quality but that
also present performances new
to most listeners' ears.
From London comes a brand
new digital recording of Zem
linsky's "The Mermaid," (Lon
don 417 450-12) conducted by
Riccardo Chailly. Zemlinsky, if
remembered at all after his death
in 1942, is noted for being the
teacher of Arnold Schoenberg
and Alma Mahler. "The Mer
maid" (or "Die Seenjungfrau")
was premiered in January, 1905,
with Schoenberg's "Pelleas and
Melisande." It was clear that the
audience preferred Schoenberg's
work, and Zemlinsky was so
crushed that he cancelled all fu

lure performances of the work.
Zemlinsky's music at times
hears a slight resemblance to the
music of Richard Strauss and
Gustav Mahler, but, for the most
part, Zemlinsky has a unique
style worth hearing. The Radio
Symphony Orchestra of Berlin
and its chorus also perform Zem
linsky's "Psalm XIII, op. 24,"
putting 54 minutes on this disc.
Handel's fame and skill as a
composer of oratorios is no mys
tery, but he wrote so many
oratorios that most are not
known to 20th century audi
ences. John Eliot Gardner shows
us what can be accomplished
with the original instruments and
vocal techniques in his new re
cording of Handel's "Solomon"
(Phillips 412 612-2 English
Baroque Soloists and the Mon
tiverdi Choir).
The complete oratorio (136
minutes long) is found on two
discs and contains many of
Handel's best and most intricate
choruses (seven of them are in
eight parts). The full chorus at
the end of the second act,
however, is not intricate, with
mostly block choral writing, but
the addition of trumpets and
drums to the lively tune make it
one of the most memorable mo
ments in "Solomon."
The extraordinary Nimbus
Records has released several
new recordings of music for

string orchestra written in the
20th century by different English
composers. Individual discs are
devoted to the string works of El
gar (NIM 5008), Britten (NIM
5025) and Vaughan Williams
(NIM 5019), while Butterworth,
Parry and Bridge are represented
together on a recent release
(NIM 5068).
The most interesting and unus
ual works are Benjamin Britten's
"Variations on a Theme by Frank
Bridge" and the "Suite for Large
String Orchestra," by Frank
Bridge himself. All four of these
recordings feature the clear, ex
pressive playing of the English
String Orchestra, conducted by
William Boughton.
These recordings, like all
Nimbus recordings, are made
using one microphone in an
acoustically appropriate room for
the ensemble. Nimbus also tries
to deliver unspliced recordings
and is one of the few companies
to actually manufacture its own
CDs.
All of this care and emphasis in
quality leads to a notable differ
ence in the product. The sound is
indeed "natural" (they call it
Nimbus Natural Sound) and the
performances seem much more
live than other studio recordings.
As if that weren't enough, three
of these four discs offer more
than 60 minutes of music.
The complete symphonies of
an unknown Swedish composer

may seem like too much of a
good thing, but the complete
symphonies of Franz Berwald
("Four Symphonies," Deutsche
Grammophon 415 502-2) are ex
tremely charming.
The music is much like that of
Berlioz in that it is indescribably
unique in its musical language.
The works are somewhat like the
Schumann symphonies in size
and general period, but are much
lighter in both melody and or
chestration. They are especially
unusual in their rhythmic feel.
Neeme Jarvi conducts the Got
henburg Symphony Orchestra on
two CDs.
Finally, from Telarc comes a
spectacular digital recording of
Hindemith's "When Lilacs Last

in the Dooryard Bloom'd, A Re
quiem for Those We Love"
(Robert Shaw, Atlanta Sym
phony Orchestra and Chorus
Telarc). The work is based on the
Whitman poem of the same name
and was written in 1946.
The "Requiem" was written
just after Hindemith's "Sym
phony in E flat" and the "Sym
phonic Metamorphosis of
Themes of Carl Maria von
Weber." Though similar in style,
it has never shared the popular
success of either of those earlier
works. This performance, with
Robert Shaw conducting (Shaw
conducted the premiere and com
missioned the work), is a power
ful recording of a neglected
work.
