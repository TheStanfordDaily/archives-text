## Geiger knocks drug testing 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
sharply criticized the NCAA
drug-testing program yesterday
in San Jose in the first of several
hearings to determine the con
stitutionality of the controversial
year-old program.
Geiger was the University's
first witness in a hearing before
Judge Conrad Rushing of the
Santa Clara County Superior
Court. Stanford is requesting a
preliminary injunction that would
allow Stanford athletes to com
pete in intercollegiate sports
without signing a consent form
requiring them to submit to ran

An injunction would remain in
effect until the outcome of a suit
brought against the National Col
legiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) by senior Jennifer Hill,
captain of the Stanford women's

McKeever, a linebacker on the
Stanford football team. Hill and
McKeever currently have a tem
porary restraining order against
the testing, issued by Rushing on
Aug. 26.
Under questioning from Uni
versity attorney Debra Zumwalt,
Geiger pointed out inadequacies

in the NCAA's efforts to educate
athletes about drugs. "We've
never received any significant
drug education materials," he
said, adding, "1 believe they
once sent some posters."
Geiger advocated education
and counseling as a better ap
proach to treating drug abuse
cases, pointing out that
"Stanford has an excellent coun
seling program at Cowell Student
Health Center." Geiger said two
Stanford athletes are currently in
counseling for substance abuse.
During his testimony, Geiger
also spoke about the testing of
the football team before Janu
ary s Gator Bowl. "It was an
awkward situation," he said.
"There were several television
cameras at the testing site, ob
serving athletes coming and
going from the testing."
Geiger concluded that "it is
impossible to keep the process
confidential."
Richard Archer presented the
opening argument for the NCAA.
"As long as the right to compete
in intercollegiate athletics is a
privilege, we can require as a
condition a hard choice," he
said. "You can either agree to
our procedure, if it is reasonable,
