## Resurgent Card faces SJSU 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Coming off four consecutive
victories over nationally ranked
squads (San Francisco, Fresno
State, Washington and UCLA)
and a first place finish in the
AT&T/Pacific West Soccer Clas
sic over the weekend, the Stan
ford men's soccer team will try to
maintain its momentum today
against a less formidable oppon
ent.
The Cardinal, 7-4-2 overall and
2-0 in the Pacific Soccer Confer
ence, hosts league rival San Jose
State at 3 p.m. at Maloney Field.
The Spartans are 3-5-3 on the
year, 1-1-1 in conference play.
Although the Cardinal of late
has demonstrated balance on
both offense and defense, shut
ting out USF, Fresno State and
UCLA while scoring five goals in
the past four matches, Stanford
is wary of San Jose State.
Several players said the team has
had a tendency in the past to per
form well against highly regarded
opponents and slack off when
meeting unranked teams.
"It is going to be a hard
game," senior midfielder Pat
Sheehy said. "We've beaten
tough teams, and it is going to be
a true test to see whether we can
hold up against all types."
According to team members,
the Cardinal doesn't keep up its
level of play against weaker op
ponents because it is given more
freedom on the field, and players
tend to stray from a team concept
of soccer.
To win this afternoon, Stan
ford must continue to play well
as a team, as it has for the past
four contests, and maintain its
cohesiveness for the entire game.
"We can't take anyone for
granted," Stanford Coach Sam
Koch said.
Although the Spartans have
won only three games this
season, today's matchup should
not be written off as an easy vic
tory, according to Koch. San
Jose State is a good all-around
team, well-coached and strong
on defense, he said.
