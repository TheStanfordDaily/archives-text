# 1987 a quirky year for college football
## 
### 
It's been a strange year in col
lege football so far, and we're not
even halfway through the season.
I'm not talking about Stan
ford's 0-4 start or Brad Muster's
infamous left ankle. Those were
unexpected events, but not really
all that weird.
Weird is Ralphie 11, the
Colorado mascot, kicking off the

night of the Stanford-Colorado
game. The Buffaloes won the
game, but lost a buffalo, as the
12-year old female bison died of
heart failure after the 31-17
Colorado victory.
"I'm told Ralphie died with a
smile on her face," Colorado
Coach Bill McCartney said.
"Her last game was a victory."
Ralphie II led the Buffs onto
the field for eight seasons, but
the half-ton quadruped had not
been well this year, missing the
Oregon game (which Colorado
lost — coincidence?) and spend
ing the Stanford game in a trailer
on the sidelines.
Bringing a sick buffalo out
against Stanford may have been a
mistake. The Stanford Band did
roadtrip to Boulder, and one the
ory holds that the shock of
hearing the "world's largest rock
'n roll band" may have contrib
uted to Ralphie 11' s untimely
demise.
Drum major Pete Adamy
denied the charges, however. "I
doubt it had anything to do with
us," he said, "although I think
the Colorado fans were a little
shocked with us. I don't know if
it carried over to their buffalo."
A ceremony for the late
Ralphie II was held on the field
before the Washington State
game, which Colorado won with
a substitute from a livestock
show standing in as mascot. A
plaque portraying the charging

Buff was presented to Colorado
president Gordon Gee, a moment
of silence was observed and the
Colorado band played "Home on
the Range" in honor of the dearly
departed wooly one.
Two-year-old Ralphie 111 (how
do they keep coming up with
these imaginitive names?) will
make her debut this Saturday
against Kansas.
Other Weird Things II: Heis
man Hype. Of course, "Heisman
hype" has become a redundant
phrase in this age of overzealous
sports information departments.
Everyone knows all about
Gaston Green (i.e., "Gas," "The
Green Rash") and his Humph
rey Bogart fixation. Gordy Lock
baum has put Holy Cross on the
map by the mere fact that he
plays both offense and defense.
The massive publicity campaign
of the Holy Cross sports informa
tion people hasn't hurt his cause
either, helping land Lockbaum
on numerous talkshows.
The Outland Trophy, given to
the nation's outstanding interior
lineman, has to have inspired the
top entry for this year's Most
Overdone Publicity Campaign
award. The Arizona State sports
information directors have put
out a cassette tape hyping senior
offensive guard Randall
McDaniel (his name alone should
win him some kind of award) for
the Outland Trophy.
"We hope you'll find the cas
sette informative, personal,
curious and refreshing," the
ASU media release said. "It's a
unique approach for a unique
student-athlete."
It was certainly refreshing to
find that this unique student ath
lete considers lifting weights
"kind of like a hobby." I'm
happy to be informed of the
curious fact that McDaniel can,
from a flat-footed stance, do a
360-degree spin and slam dunk a
basketball.
The cassette also contains
comments about Rhyming Ran
dall from various college coaches
and professional scouts, as well
as narrator Tom Dillon gushing,
"Even with all this attention,


Susan
Slusser
Randall McDaniel remains the
humble, happy, down-to-earth
person he was brought up to be
by strong family ties."
Best of all is the sticker cover
ing the cassette itself. It's enti
tled, "Randall McDaniel and the
Outland: 'A Tale of the Tape,"
and indeed, all of McDaniel's vi
tal statistics are enumerated on
the sticker — including his
percentage of body fat (10.4 per
cent, but then he's an offensive
lineman) and the amount of
weight he can lift from a full
squat (640 pounds).
OK, it's weird, but Randall
McDaniel will almost certainly
win the Outland Trophy. When
was the last time an offensive
lineman inspired a cassette tape?
No one will be able to forget him
after all of this overkill.
Weird Things Continued:
Where are all these ties coming
from, and how did Cal manage to
tie Arizona? How could three
Southeastern Conference teams
all tie (Auburn matched Tennes
see 20-20, fellow SEC power
LSU tied Ohio State 13-13) on
the same day?
One More Weird Thing: Well,
there are a lot more weird things
going on in college football, but
the strangest thing of all could
turn out to be, fittingly enough,
the Rose Bowl. Oregon and Min
nesota in Pasadena on New
Year's Day?

Ralphie II led the Buffs onto
the field for eight seasons, but
the half-ton quadruped had not
been well this year, missing the
Oregon game (which Colorado
lost — coincidence?) and spend
ing the Stanford game in a trailer
on the sidelines.
Bringing a sick buffalo out
against Stanford may have been a
mistake. The Stanford Band did
roadtrip to Boulder, and one the
ory holds that the shock of
hearing the "world's largest rock
'n roll band" may have contrib
uted to Ralphie 11' s untimely
demise.
Drum major Pete Adamy
denied the charges, however. "I
doubt it had anything to do with
us," he said, "although I think
the Colorado fans were a little
shocked with us. I don't know if
it carried over to their buffalo."
A ceremony for the late
Ralphie II was held on the field
before the Washington State
game, which Colorado won with
a substitute from a livestock
show standing in as mascot. A
plaque portraying the charging

Buff was presented to Colorado
president Gordon Gee, a moment
of silence was observed and the
Colorado band played "Home on
the Range" in honor of the dearly
departed wooly one.
Two-year-old Ralphie 111 (how
do they keep coming up with
these imaginitive names?) will
make her debut this Saturday
against Kansas.
Other Weird Things II: Heis
man Hype. Of course, "Heisman
hype" has become a redundant
phrase in this age of overzealous
sports information departments.
Everyone knows all about
Gaston Green (i.e., "Gas," "The
Green Rash") and his Humph
rey Bogart fixation. Gordy Lock
baum has put Holy Cross on the
map by the mere fact that he
plays both offense and defense.
The massive publicity campaign
of the Holy Cross sports informa
tion people hasn't hurt his cause
either, helping land Lockbaum
on numerous talkshows.
The Outland Trophy, given to
the nation's outstanding interior
lineman, has to have inspired the
top entry for this year's Most
Overdone Publicity Campaign
award. The Arizona State sports
information directors have put
out a cassette tape hyping senior
offensive guard Randall
McDaniel (his name alone should
win him some kind of award) for
the Outland Trophy.
"We hope you'll find the cas
sette informative, personal,
curious and refreshing," the
ASU media release said. "It's a
unique approach for a unique
student-athlete."
It was certainly refreshing to
find that this unique student ath
lete considers lifting weights
"kind of like a hobby." I'm
happy to be informed of the
curious fact that McDaniel can,
from a flat-footed stance, do a
360-degree spin and slam dunk a
basketball.
The cassette also contains
comments about Rhyming Ran
dall from various college coaches
and professional scouts, as well
as narrator Tom Dillon gushing,
"Even with all this attention,


Susan
Slusser
Randall McDaniel remains the
humble, happy, down-to-earth
person he was brought up to be
by strong family ties."
Best of all is the sticker cover
ing the cassette itself. It's enti
tled, "Randall McDaniel and the
Outland: 'A Tale of the Tape,"
and indeed, all of McDaniel's vi
tal statistics are enumerated on
the sticker — including his
percentage of body fat (10.4 per
cent, but then he's an offensive
lineman) and the amount of
weight he can lift from a full
squat (640 pounds).
OK, it's weird, but Randall
McDaniel will almost certainly
win the Outland Trophy. When
was the last time an offensive
lineman inspired a cassette tape?
No one will be able to forget him
after all of this overkill.
Weird Things Continued:
Where are all these ties coming
from, and how did Cal manage to
tie Arizona? How could three
Southeastern Conference teams
all tie (Auburn matched Tennes
see 20-20, fellow SEC power
LSU tied Ohio State 13-13) on
the same day?
One More Weird Thing: Well,
there are a lot more weird things
going on in college football, but
the strangest thing of all could
turn out to be, fittingly enough,
the Rose Bowl. Oregon and Min
nesota in Pasadena on New
Year's Day?
It's been a strange year in col
lege football so far, and we're not
even halfway through the season.
I'm not talking about Stan
ford's 0-4 start or Brad Muster's
infamous left ankle. Those were
unexpected events, but not really
all that weird.
Weird is Ralphie 11, the
Colorado mascot, kicking off the

night of the Stanford-Colorado
game. The Buffaloes won the
game, but lost a buffalo, as the
12-year old female bison died of
heart failure after the 31-17
Colorado victory.
"I'm told Ralphie died with a
smile on her face," Colorado
Coach Bill McCartney said.
