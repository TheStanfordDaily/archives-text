# Stanford looks for fifth straight victory
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
"The Twelve Days of
Christmas" cites an extra-special
item on the fifth day: golden
rings. The number five also
weighs heavily today on the
minds of Stanford's field hockey
players.
Today the Cardinal takes on
Pacific at 3 p.m. at home in an ef
fort to win its fifth consecutive
Northern Pacific Conference
game of the season. Stanford's
overall record would climb to 8-3
with a victory.
UOP checks in with a disap
pointing 1-3 conference record
and is looking for a big victory to
get its season untracked. Cer
tainly there would be no better
way for the Tigers to do so than
to knock off the first-place Cardi
nal.
"Obviously, I expect we'll
win," Stanford Asst. Coach Andi
Wolpert said. "They are one of
the weaker teams in our confer
ence."
Stanford, however, is showing
no signs of overconfidence. The
team has been working very hard
in practice since the California
game last Saturday in an effort to
eliminate all doubt about today's
outcome.
Although the win over Cal was
a good one, there were some

noticable weaknesses in the Car
dinal's performance.
"We can definitely play bet
ter," Wolpert said. "We need to
attack around the goal and force
more corners."
While there has been the con
cern with the offense, Stanford's
defense has been virtually un
touchable this year. The ninth
ranked Cardinal enters the game
with a very impressive .60 goals
against average and has only
given up two goals in its last four
outings. Stanford shut out Pacific
3-0 in the two teams' last
meeting, Sept. 19.
Junior goalie Karen Jones has
done the job all year long and
should have no problem contain
ing the Tiger attack once again,
with some help from the rest of
the squad.
"Karen made some incredible
saves," Wolpert said of Jones'
earlier performance against
UOP. "If not for her play, that
game would have been a lot
closer."
Stanford has been forced to
prepare for today's game without
Coach Sheryl Johnson. Johnson
has been in Los Angeles with the
U.S National Team preparing for
the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. She
will be back in Palo Alto for
today's game but will then have
to leave again immediately.

"We've done OK without
her," Wolpert said, "but we're
happy that she will be back for
the game."
After the contest against UOP,
the Cardinal will have some time
to relax and enjoy Saturday's
alumni game. According to Wol
pert, who played with Stanford
for four years until her gradua
tion last fall, the players always
like to play in the alumni game.

Stanford will have a week off
following that contest to get
ready for the California Invita
tional. The tournament has no
bearing on the conference stand
ings but could affect the Cardi
nal's national ranking.
Stanford is hoping to finish the
year ranked in the top four na
tionally in order to gain a bye in
the first round of the NCAA
championships. Due to the na

ture of its schedule, however,
that goal will be difficult to reach.
"We have a hard time getting a
good ranking because we play all
the tough East Coast schools
early in the year," Wolpert said.
"A lot of times they'll just say
that those teams weren't at their
peak yet. Also, we play the same
teams over and over later on be
cause we are in such a small con
ference."
