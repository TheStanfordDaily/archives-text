# Stanford sailing ends regatta third
## 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff Writer 
When three Stanford sailors
won last year's Pacific Coast
Sloop Championship and went
on to an impressive fourth
place finish at the Sloop Na
tional Championships, they
set a high standard for future
Cardinal sloop sailors.
Last weekend, despite a
string of strong finishes, the
team of senior Dan Buckstaff,
freshman David Dowd and
sophomore Chris Hollenbeck
fell just short of matching last
year's performance, finishing
third at the Pacific Coast
Championship in Long Beach.
For the Cardinal, last week
end's regatta was a prolonged
battle against two strong
teams from Southern Califor
nia. USC, led by last year's
Pacific Coast singlehanded
champion, took first place in
the regatta, just ahead of UC-

Irvine's Charles Pickney,
According to Stanford
Coach Blake Middleton, the
top three teams were in "a
fleet by themselves," leaving
the other four competitors be
hind in most of the regatta's
seven races.
"The top three teams all
sailed very solidly, which isn't
surprising because those three
skippers are some of the best
on this coast. We fought hard,
but we just came up a little
short this year," Middleton
said.
Behind the Cardinal at the
regatta's end were the teams
from Orange Coast College,
Hawaii, UC-Santa Cruz and
California.
At the start of the regatta,
all seven teams had trouble
with light winds that shifted
dramatically. According to
Middleton, Buckstaff and his
crew were at their fastest as
the winds grew in strength.
