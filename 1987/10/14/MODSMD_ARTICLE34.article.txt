# Cardinal squares off against USF
## 
### Robert Pardington Staff writer 
Patience is a must if you're a
Stanford women's soccer fan.
After beginning the season
with five losses before garnering
its only win, the 1-6-2 Cardinal
takes on San Francisco today at
San Francisco in its second road
game in a row.
Stanford fell to California 5-0
last Friday, but the players are
confident about their chances
against the Dons.
"We have a strong chance of
winning at San Francisco,"
junior fullback Christy McDevitt
said. "The team is up for it."
The Cardinal has played the
Dons only once before in its brief
existence as a varsity program,
defeating USF 2-0 in 1985. That
victory came in only the second
year of the women's soccer pro
gram at Stanford. In this, the
fourth year, the Cardinal has
gained experience and talent.
"If we play as well as we did
against Cal, we'll be in good
shape," Stanford Coach Berhane
Andeberhan said.
The intense atmosphere and
the playing conditions played a
large role in the game against the
Bears. Cal's field is artificial turf,
a tough surface for a soccer
game, and the match was at
night.
"Playing in Berkeley is harder
than playing anywhere else,"
McDevitt said.
The game at San Francisco
should be played under more or
dinary circumstances. To
prepare for the Dons, Andeber

han has run his players Ihrough
drills designed to improve
scoring, a problem for the Cardi
nal all season.
"We've been working on
shooting in practice/' freshman
fullback Anne Pusch said.
"We have to tighten the con
nection between defenders and
midfielders, and from the mid
field to the forwards," McDevitt
said. "We want to use one-touch
passes as much as possible."
Andeberhan has been pleased
with the development of his team
this year. At the start of the
season, Andeberhan said he
wanted all of his players to im
prove and to begin laying a foun
dation for coming years.
"We are accomplishing the
goals I had set for us," Andeber
han said. "I'm thrilled with the
work rate and effort of every
body."
The players are taking each
game one at a time but have long
range goals as well. The team is
pointing toward the game at
third-ranked Colorado College.
"We have three games right in
a row that should be ours,"
McDevitt said. " Then we go to
Colorado. That game will be
tough, but we might pull it off."
The next three games are im
portant for Stanford's overall
record because they are against
relatively weak teams and should
give the Cardinal a few wins.
After the USF contest, Stan
ford plays Portland Friday at 3
p.m. and Chico State Sunday at 2
p.m. Both games take place at
Maloney Field.
