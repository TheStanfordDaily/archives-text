Stanford will conduct a $I(K),(KK) environ
mental impact study of projected campus de
velopment through the year 2CKH) in order to
satisfy the requirements of a Santa Clara
County general use permit, according to the
University Planning Office.
I he general use permit, covering the area
from hi C amino Real to Junipero Serra
Boulevard, "enables Stanford to apply for in
dividual building approval from the Architec
ture and Site Approval Committee," said
C harlotte Strem, a planner at the University
Planning Office. Ihe permit does not cover
specific buildings.
Stanford has hired an independent consult
ing firm, EIP Associates, to study possible
environmental impact of further campus con
struction. Campus flora and fauna, transpor
tation and safety are some of the issues that
will be addressed by the study.

"It will also include those significant im
pacts that cannot be resolved," Strem said.
But she added that no prospective problem
seems unsolvable at this time.
Stanford officials hope a draft of the impact
report will be available for public review at
the end of November. The report will then go
to the county planning commission for dis
cussion before a final version is filed in early
1988.
While the study is taking place, the Univer
sity will apply to the planning commission for
approval of future construction. Projected
plans include additional student housing and
faculty housing, a new gymnasium on the
west side of campus, renovation in the sci
ence quad and expansion of the Medical Cen
ter.
Two years ago, the University tried to
modify an existing permit but withdrew the
application. "Modifying the permit was very
confusing to people," Strem said. The

modified permit would have applied differ
ently to individual cases.
The existing permit, drafted in 1962, did
not require that an environmental impact
report be submitted. The modified report
would have "required changes in the permit
in some projected development and not in
others," Strem said.
"Instead we decided to start all over with a
new impact report for the whole campus,"
she said.
EIP Associates is also doing impact reports
for Stanford on a proposed psychiatry center
and research animal facility. Reports for the
Campus West development and the
Children's Hospital were previously done by
the same company.
A public information workshop to discuss
the report's evaluation of campus population
growth and the impact of proposed construc
tion will be held at 7 p.m. Oct. 20 in Kresge
Auditorium.
