The Stanford Department of

a.m. to 2 p m. in White Plaza.
Among the groups participat
ing in "Quake Fest '87" will he
the San Jose Search and Rescue
team, the Santa Clara County

Department of Public Health and
the Stanford Amateur Radio
Group.
The Quake Fest is an annual
event and was not precipitated
by the recent Los Angeles earth
quake, according to Ben Suh of
the Stanford Department of
Public Safety.
The Department of Public
Safety also plans to distribute
next week "The New Stanford

Farm Almanac," which contains
earthquake preparedness tips.
Some of the more important
guidelines contained in the
pamphlet are the following:
• Before an earthquake, know
the location of your residence's
emergency assembly point, and
arrange your bed with its head
away from windows and heavy
objects.
• During an earthquake, try to

stay calm and, if indoors, get un
der a desk, table or doorway.
• After an earthquake, go to your
residence emergency assembly
point. Be prepared for after
shocks, listen to the radio for ac
curate information ( KZSU- 90.1
FM) and leave phone lines open
for disaster services.
