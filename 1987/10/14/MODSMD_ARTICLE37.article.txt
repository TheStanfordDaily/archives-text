# Women's groups meet
## 
### Michael W. Chen 
Council of Presidents mem
ber Maria Canas met yester
day with administrators, fac
ulty and representatives from
several student groups to dis
cuss how to improve commu
nication between various
campus women's groups.
During the hour-long lunch
time meeting, each student in
troduced herself and the pur
pose of the organization she
represented. The organiza
tions at the meeting included
the SURE escort service, the
Rape Elimination Project, the
Women's Center, the
Speakers Bureau, the
Graduate Women's Network
and the Intersorority Council.
According to sophomore
Suha Jhaveri, COP assistant
on women's issues, the main
issue and purpose of the
meeting was networking. "We
decided there was a real need
for a meeting every quarter,"
she said. The next meeting,
scheduled for Dec. 1, will
focus on plans for winter quar
ter.
One of the ideas discussed
at the meeting was a women's
calendar that will enable dif
ferent women's groups to
avoid conflicts with each other
in scheduling events.
Jhaveri said Canas was re

sponsible for bringing the
groups together. "We took the
head of various women's
groups and said, 'Here's the
deal. We have all these groups
on campus for women. If we
unite together, we can reach
out to women at Stanford.'
Assistant to the Provost Mi
chael Jackson and English
Prof. Adrienne Rich were also
present at the meeting. After
the meeting, Dean of Admis
sions Jean Fetter said, "It's al
ways helpful for women inter
ested in the same issues to get
together and organize. Efforts
have been made every year
since I've been at Stanford to
coordinate these groups, but
so much depends on the indi
vidual."
