# ASSU Senate criticizes Law School
## 
### Goodwin Liu 
The ASSU Senate last night called
on the Law School to implement ef
fective enforcement procedures and
clearly defined sanctions to holster
its controversial non-discrimination
policy.
The senate also confirmed four stu
dent representatives to the Univer
sity Committee on Minority Issues, a
committee estahished to study the
quality of minority life at Stanford,
and approved a big budget hike for
the autumn general election so that
automatic voting machines can be put
into use.
Graduate Senator Don Gagliardi
authored the senate resolution that
aims to create mechanisms for en
forcement of the Law School's non
discrimination policy and provide for
sanctions of legal employers who dis
criminate.
Employers presently utilize the

services and facilities of the Law
School to recruit students. Possible
sanctions against such employers
would be a just and substantive
response to discrimination claims
made by students, Gagliardi said.
"Students have become extremely
critical," he said. "It's important to
have mechanisms for enforcement
and sanctions because it's too simple
to say, 'We don't like discrimina
tion.'
Gagliardi suggested that when a
student makes an allegation of dis
crimination, the employer should
have the burden of proof that dis
crimination did not occur. He also
hinted at placement of tape recorders
in interview rooms as an extreme
measure.
The confirmed nominees to the
Committee on Minority Issues are
Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza of the
Chicano-Latino community; David
Porter of the black community; Joey

Thomas, a Native American; and
Brian Kim. an Asian-American.
These representatives were chosen at
meetings of their respective ethnic
groups.
Headed by Assoc. History Prof. A 1
Camarillo, the committee has sched
uled its first meeting for Oct. 20.
In other business, the senate ap
proved an additional $1000 for the
Speakers Bureau to pay the $3500
honorarium asked by Stanford
alumnus Robert Owen, the Wash
ington-Nicaragua courier in the Iran
contra affair. Owen, an assistant to
Lt. Col. Oliver North, will speak
tonight at Memorial Auditorium on
the Iran-contra affair.
The senate also approved the
budget for the autumn general elec
tion. The school-wide November
election seeks to fill five to nine va
cant Graduate Senate seats and three
seats on the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC).

At a substantial cost, the election
will use automatic voting machines
from Santa Clara County to reduce
the likelihood of counting errors that
marred the general election last
spring.
Considerable debate took place
over the practicality of an election
that will exceed $8500 in budgeted
expenses. Much of the cost stems
from salaries to be paid to the voting
machine programmers. However, the
senate adopted the use of the
machines as a long-term investment.
Once the machines are programmed,
the elections will become less expen
sive.
Council of Presidents member Jim
Durkin spoke in support of the new
election technology, telling oppo
nents they are "standing in the way
of progress."
The senate also approved 66 ap
pointments to University and ASSU
committees.
