# Krakow program will move to spring

The Stanford Program in
Krakow, Poland, will be avail
able for students spring quarter
of this academic year, rather than
during the summer as it has been
in the past, the Overseas Studies
Office announced.
The switch, authorized by
Stanford and the Polish govern
ment, will allow Stanford stu
dents to live and study with their
Polish counterparts for the first
time in recent memory. The pro
gram in Krakow was begun on a
trial basis two years ago.
For several years, the Univer
sity has lobbied the Polish gov
ernment to allow the program to
be switched from summer to
spring in order to provide more
opportunities for interaction be
tween Poles and Americans. Few
Polish students and faculty
remain at Krakow's Jagiellonian
University, where the program is
based, during the summer recess.
According to Law Prof. Thom
as Heller, director of Overseas
Studies, the Polish government
permitted this "tremendous
breakthrough'' not only because
of pressure from Stanford, but
also because it believes the

switch will enhance Polish-
American relations.
"The openings going on there
— in other words, glasnost —
have also contributed to the fa
vorable reaction from Poland,"
Heller said.
The switch from summer to
spring was greeted enthusiastic
ally by both Stanford students
and faculty. Heller said the
change will make the decision to
go overseas for a quarter easier
for many students.
Debbie Lloyd, one of the
teaching assistants who will ac
company Stanford students to
Krakow in the spring, agreed
with Heller's assessment."Most
students want a real vacation
during summer. Having this pro
gram take place during spring
will stir up a lot more interest
among the students," she said.
Another change in the program
is the addition of a course featur
ing a topic discussion session in
which Stanford students will ex
change ideas and debate on a va
riety of topics with students from
Poland and other Fast European
countries.
