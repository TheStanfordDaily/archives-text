# Law school stance draws fire
## Students protest interview policy 
### Mike MacCrystall 
The Stanford Law School's
non-discrimination policy was
again called into question yes
terday morning as angry law
students confronted attorneys
from a Los Angeles law firm
accused of irresponsible hiring
procedures and racial discrimi
nation.
The heated exchange
prompted Law School Dean
Paul Brest to hold a second
forum later in the day to specifi
cally discuss the policy and its
implementation.
An article by law student Vic
tor Minjares in this month's edi
tion of the Stanford Law Jour
nal contends that the Los An
geles firm — Allen, Matkins,
Leek, Gamble & Mallory — im
properly used race as a factor in
denying him a position with the
firm.
In the first forum, moderated
by Brest, over KM) law students
fired sharp questions at the at
torneys of the firm. Many stu
dents claimed Minjares was
denied the job because of his
race and his complaints to the
firm about a racial epithet

leveled at him by a firm associ
ate.
A majority of the students
were also angry at the Law
School for having the forum at
all, arguing that the Law
School, by holding the forum,
violated its own non-dis
crimination policy which bars
companies that discriminate
from access to Stanford
facilities.
Minjares would not say he
had been dealt with unfairly by
the Law School in setting up the
forum, but he said he and other
students were not given "ade
quate time to prepare for the
forum.
"When the Law School
called me, the meeting had al
ready been set up, and he
(Brest) asked me if 1 would be
there," Minjares said. "Faced
with the choice of either being
here or not being here, I felt
that to stand by what I said I
had to show up — although, I
didn't find it a very pleasant ex
perience."
The firm learned about the ar
ticle Friday afternoon and
quickly made arrangements to
participate in the forum.

Brest defended his decision
to allow the firm to present its
view of the dispute. "While it
became quite clear at the forum
that the firm screwed up," he
told the students at the second
meeting, "I thought it would be
only fair to offer them the

chance to defend themselves
against the accusations leveled
against them by Victor
Minjares."
Assuming responsibility for
the decision to allow the forum,
Brest encouraged the students
to suggest ways to handle
similar situations in the future.
