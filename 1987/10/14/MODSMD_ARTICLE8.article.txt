Gay demonstration leads to arrests
WASHINGTON — Police officers, many wearing rubber
gloves, arrested more than 600 gay rights protesters outside the
Supreme Court yesterday in a mass demonstration designed to
draw attention to their cause and denounce last year's landmark
decision upholding a Georgia state sodomy law.
The peaceful demonstration marked the largest mass arrest
ever to take place at the court and the largest in Washington
since the Vietnam era, police said. Arrests were made through
out the morning as group after group of demonstrators climbed
the court's steps, crossed police barriers and sat down in the
plaza in front of the building, where protests are prohibited.
"Civil disobedience is not new to gays and lesbians," said Pat
Norman of San Francisco, co-chairman of the National March
on Washington, which organized the demonstration and a
massive weekend rally that preceded it. "Every day in our lives
we commit the act of civil disobedience by loving another. We
demand an end to this idiocy."
The demonstrators condemned the 1986 high court decision
on the Georgia law, which bans homosexual conduct. In a bit
terly divided decision, the court ruled that the Constitution does
not protect homosexual relations between consenting adults,
even in the privacy of their own homes.
That decision "left lesbians and gays constitutionally home
less," claimed Susan Cavin, a visiting lecturer at Rutgers Uni
versity. Other demonstrators wore T-shirts bearing the slogan:
"Legalize my love."
The orchestrated demonstration turned occasionally raucous
as protesters trampled through hedges in search of a back en
trance to the court and shouted at police, ridiculing those who
had donned surgical gloves as well as riot gear out of fear of con
tracting AIDS or other communicable diseases.
' Lesbians are low-risk," some yelled as glove-wearing police
began to arrest a dozen lesbians who had formed the first wave
of protesters. "Your gloves don't match your shoes," they
shouted later.
Iranian missile hits Baghdad school
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — In one of the most devas
tating missile attacks of the Persian Gulf war, an Iranian war
head smashed into a Baghdad schoolyard yesterday, killing 29
children and three adults and wounding more than 200 people in
neighboring buildings demolished by the blast, according to
Iraqi officials and western diplomats.
Iraq's military command issued a harsh warning after the at
tack, saying Iran "wanted a war of the cities, so let it be. Iraq's
patience has run out and it has become our right, but also our
duty, to reply to this ugly crime."
Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps said in Teheran that the
surface-to-surface missile was fired at Iraq's Defense Ministry
compound in retaliation for Iraqi bombing attacks on civilian
targets in Iran, including an attack Monday on an Iranian school
in Sohail, in Lorestan Province.
The missile, believed by analysts to be a long-range Scud-B of
the type Iran purchased from Libya, fell 12 miles from the
Defense Ministry. Iraqi officials did not allow publication of the
precise location of the school under a policy designed to prevent
Iran from learning the accuracy of its missile strikes.
Iraqi officials said that at least 98 people were seriously
wounded by the missile, which destroyed 30 houses and blew
out windows in hundreds of buildings within a one-mile radius of
the impact zone in central Baghdad.
Iraqi officials allowed 50 foreign diplomats and journalists to
view the destruction. It was the fourth Iranian missile attack in
eight days and appeared certain to draw retaliatory bombing
raids by Iraq's air force on Iranian economic and civilian tar
gets.
Court widens use of death penalty
SACRAMENTO — The new and more conservative Califor
nia Supreme Court, overturning the most significant capital pun
ishment decision issued under former Chief Justice Rose
Elizabeth Bird, ruled yesterday that the death penalty can be
imposed without a finding that the defendant intended to kill his
victim.
The widely awaited ruling came less than a year after a bitter
fall election campaign focusing on the old court's death penalty
record and the subsequent ouster by the voters of Bird and two
other liberal justices.
The new court, now with a new majority of appointees of Re
publican Gov. George Deukmejian, held in a 6-1 decision that
juries need not specifically find intent to kill when the defendant
kills in the commission of a felony, such as robbery, rape or bur
glary.
I he justices, citing recent rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court,
reversed a 1983 decision by the Bird court in a case that had re
quired an intent finding before the death penalty could be
imposed in felony murder cases.
That ruling forced penalty retrials in 13 subsequent capital
cases — and state prosecutors warned that death judgments in
at least 29 other pending cases were likely to be reversed unless
the 1983 ruling was overturned.
In yesterday's decision, the court also reversed a 1984 ruling
that had required a finding of intent to kill in cases involving
multiple murders.
The new ruling thus will affect all future cases, as well as doz
ens of pending cases that had been tried before the Bird court
rulings and in which juries had not been instructed they must
find intent to kill.
Reagan pledges more controversy
WHIPPANY. N.J. — President Reagan charged yesterday
that the Senate had turned the Supreme Court confirmation bat
tle over Judge Robert Bork into a "political joke" and defiantly
promised to find another high court nominee "that they'll object
to as much as they did to this one."
Reagan's ad-libbed remarks to a reception for Republican
campaign contributors shattered a strategy engineered by White
House chief of staff Howard Baker Jr. to tone down presidential
rhetoric about Bork and focus on obtaining a replacement
nominee who can win Senate approval.
As Reagan spoke, a 54th senator, Harry Reid (D-Nev.), an
nounced his opposition to Bork. Democratic and Republican
leaders may decide today on the timing of the debate and final
vote on Bork, with a Friday vote probably the earliest possible.
With their eyes on the nominee who will come after Bork, the
White House staff had deleted from Reagan's main speech a
statement in which Reagan asserted that "Judge Bork has been
the victim of a sophisticated campaign of smears and lies," and
they removed a Hollywood-based anecdote from the movie,
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"in which Reagan likened
himself to the hero fighting valiantly for a lost cause in a Senate
chamber filled with lies.
In the original text of this combative speech to the New Jer
sey Chamber of Commerce, the president blamed Bork's plight
on a few liberal special interests [that ] have declared a war of
conquest on the American system of justice."
