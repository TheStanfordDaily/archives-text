## Arias wins Nobel Peace Prize 
### 
OSLO, Norway â€” Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias, the author of a peace plan for
Central America signed in August by the
region's five presidents, yesterday was
awarded the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize.
Arias, the fourth Latin American to win the
prize in its 86-year history, was cited by the
Norwegian Nobel Committee "for his work
for peace in Central America."
In San Jose, Arias told a group of reporters
that "all five presidents of Central America
deserve the award." He said he would use
the estimated $340,000 in prize money to
form a "foundation for Costa Rica's neediest
citizens."
The announcement came as a surprise to
many observers, and is believed to have been
decided only in the past few days by the five
member committee, appointed for six-year
terms by the Norwegian Parliament. Arias,
46, was not even mentioned on a rumored
short list that included Philippine President
Corazon Aquino, who led her country's
return to democracy, and two perennial can
didates, former U.N. peace forces organizer
Brian Urquhart and the World Health Organi
zation.
In its statement, the committee called the
Arias plan, which is scheduled to take effect
Nov. 7, "an outstanding contribution to the
possible return of stability and peace to a

region long torn by strife and civil war." It
called him a "strong spokesman" for
"democratic ideals, with freedom and
equality for all." The monetary award and a
gold medal are to be presented here by the
king of Norway on Dec. 10.
President Reagan, asked to comment on
the award as he left Washington yesterday for
a trip to New Jersey, said, "I congratulate
him."
A statement issued later by the White
House said that Arias "fully deserves the
peace prize for having started the Central
American region on the road to peace. This
award should inspire all of us to renew our ef
forts to ensure that enduring peace and
democracy eventually come to the region."
House Speaker James Wright Jr., who co
sponsored a similar plan with Reagan before
the Arias plan was approved, said the award
ing of the prize to Arias would "impose a
strong moral call on the U.S. to act to see that
it (the peace plan) is implemented."
House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-
Calif.) said the prize could end any hopes of
congressional approval of an administration
request for new aid to Nicaraguan rebels.
"This kills it; it's dead," Coelho said.
The award was questioned, however, by
congressional supporters of administration
policy in Central America, including aid to

the rebels, who suggested that it was
premature and might unduly influence events
in the region.
Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) said, 'They
ought to save the peace prize until they see
what happens in the future." House Minority
Leader Bob Michel (K-III.) said it was not
clear whether the Arias plan was "the means
to achieve" the administration's goal of
"peace and freedom for the people of
Nicaragua.
"1 don't know that the Norwegians got all
that much to say about what goes on in
Central America," Michel said.
The administration has offered only
lukewarm backing for the peace plan and is
concerned that its popularity has undercut al
ready dim prospects of winning congressional
support for the $270 million requested for the
Nicaraguan rebels.
In a speech last week to the Organization
of American States, Reagan called the plan
"a step in the right direction," but insisted
that it "does not address U.S. security con
cerns in the region." The administration has
said the accord is flawed because it does not
commit the Sandinista government in
Managua to the immediate withdrawal of
Cuban and Soviet military personnel and im
mediate new elections.
