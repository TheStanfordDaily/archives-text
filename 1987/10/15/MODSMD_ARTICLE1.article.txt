# BSU rejects Area 1 report
## 
### Haru Connolly Staff writer 
The Black Student Union will oppose the West
ern Culture Task Force's proposed changes in the
University's Area One requirement because the
report "lacks strong language," BSU Chair Bill
King said yesterday.
The task force's document advocates greater in
tegration of non-European cultures into the West
ern Culture tracks. King, who serves as a member
of the task force, said the BSU will not endorse the
report unless the task force attaches to it further
amendments.
King had supported the document until a BSU
general meeting Monday, when members voted
"heavily against it,"he said. "I have to abide by
the wishes of the members."
However, King said he has always had reserva
tions about the proposal. He said his changed posi
tion was "not a big movement for me.
"On the [task force), we backed down from a
hard line," King said. "It was watered down by the
fourth version."
BSU member Cheryl Taylor agreed. "This pres
ent proposal doesn't meet the standards we've
worked for," she said. "We should still hold out
for something we want instead of taking a half-step
forward."
Even though BSU has worked six years for this
proposal, "we shouldn't settle for something we
don't want," she added. "There is still room for
improvement."
Arguing that the push to add amendments to the
document would not delay the implementation of
the proposals. King said the report could be altered
in the next few weeks by the Committee for Under
graduate Studies and at Faculty Senate meetings.
"We could even add amendments at the task
force meeting next week," King said, adding that
the BSU did not want to contest the "meanings of
words," because that could prolong implementa
tion.
However, according to King, if the process
becomes too lengthy the BSU will have to re
evaluate the feasibility of continuing to pursue
changes. "It could be a another year of freshmen
going through the Western Culture program (as it
now stands)," he said.
The BSU's position on the document. King said,
is that the report "has a good philosophy, but the
details are not all spelled out."
Calling the enforcement clause a "primary con
cern," King said the BSU would like to see the ap-
pointment of a committee
composed of women, faculty and
representatives of the minority
community to enforce the docu
ment.
Even if the University were to
enforce the document. King said,
the proposal still would not be
adequate. "As it is now, faculty
can interpret the clauses in nar
row terms," King said. "They
don't have to change."
King said the BSU is looking
toward two new proposed West
ern Culture tracks for change and
momentum, saying that there has
been slow progress in the present
tracks.
The report, released earlier
this week by the task force, calls
for the abolishment of the West
ern Culture core reading list, an
increase in representation of
women and minorities in the cur
riculum and a reqirement that at
least one non-Western culture be
studied in all tracks.
