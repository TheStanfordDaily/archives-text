# Alcohol panel urges self-restraint

I he Student Alcohol Task Force
decided last night to adopt a two-part
program to combat alcohol abuse at
Stanford Stadium.
The task force, which will finalize its
plans today, decided that students
should take responsibility to educate
themselves about the alcohol policy
and monitor behavior in the stands.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger said
he was "encouraged and very excited
by what they (the task force) are
doing."
Present at last night's meeting were
student members of the Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education, and
Recreation (CAPER) and the Council
of Presidents, as well as Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons, Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robin
son, Geiger and a representative of the

Stanford Police Department.
The committee will decide today on
the formation of a student monitoring
system in the stadium. ASSU Senate
Chair and Task Force member Dave
Smolen, a senior, noted that there is
presently no form of authority in the
stands and said the committee will
probably suggest a system similar to
the Axe Committee's student monitors
at Big Game rallies.
COP member Leonard Adler, a
junior, said possibilities include desig
nating a student representative from
each dorm or fraternity and providing
T-shirts for them to wear. The Athletic
Department has offered financial sup
port for whatever measures the com
mittee endorses, he said.
In adddition, the committee will pro
pose publicizing existing alcohol
policies through advertising and letters
to resident assistants. Adler said many

students may not be aware of some
aspects of the alcohol policy, such as
the rule that spectators may not leave
the stadium and return with alcohol,
the size limitation on containers and
the fact that police have recently cited
spectators for underage drinking.
CAPER member Tracy Schmidt, a
junior, emphasized that "the student
body as a whole is responsible. . . . It's
everybody's problem, or else it will be
President Kennedy's problem. Which
would you prefer?"
Schmidt and Smolan said the admin
istration is giving students a chance to
bring the alcohol problem under con
trol so that it will not have to take more
drastic measures, such as banning alco
hol from the stadium.
The task force was assembled in
response to concern over a number of
incidents linked to alcohol — including
fights in the stands and one death — at
recent football games.
