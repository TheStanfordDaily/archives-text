# Freshman injured in motorcycle accident

### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
A Gavilan resident was injured at
about 11:30 last night when she rode a
motorcycle up a curb and hit her head
against a wall outside of Alondra
House, according to an eyewitness ac
count.
The victim, freshman Judy Wu of
Spokane, Wash., was learning how to
ride a motorcycle when the accident oc
curred. She was at a standing stop while
the man teaching her how to ride,
whom a Gavilan resident assistant
called "a friend of hers (visiting) from
Berkeley," was giving her instructions.
Wu then apparently "popped the
clutch" and the bike lurched forward.
The motorcycle rode up over the

curb, tipped and skidded. Wu hit her
head against a cement wall surrounding
a group of trees. She was not wearing a
helmet at the time.
The fire department was first to
respond to the call for help and rushed
Wu to Stanford Hospital. Hospital
sources said Wu "was pretty banged
up," but that her injuries were not
believed to be serious.
Preliminary X-rays were negative
and as of 2:30 a.m. it was unlikely she
would be admitted to the hospital.
Immediately after the accident Wu
complained of shoulder and back pains.
Witnesses speculated that she may
have suffered a concussion, but a nur
sing supervisor at the hospital said
Wu's injuries were not that serious.
