Melville of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences had a lunch meeting with
eight Stanford professors yesterday to
discuss the new "openness" in Soviet
politics and the implications for U.S.-
Soviet relations.
Melville, who is visiting this country
in an attempt to promote a better un
derstanding between the United States
and the Soviet Union, also gave an in
formal lecture on the "new political
thinking."
Melville said he was optimistic about
the "change in the political and psy
chological climate" occurring in the
Soviet Union. He pointed out that
there has been a significant change in
the Soviet foreign policy outlook.
"We can define the change as a shift
from a bipolar model to a concept of in
terdependence," he said. In light of
what Melville called the "nuclear
reality," he said the Soviet Union "has
to change its perceptions in this inter
national system."

Melville also spoke on the variety of
views now being expressed in Soviet
society. "In America, there is a
widespread image of the Soviet Union
as a concrete monolith." he said.
"This never was the case."
"There was always a spectrum of
views, but these were not always dis
cussed." he said. Melville said there is
now a "war of ideas" raging in the So
viet Union on domestic issues.
However, he added that differing
opinions are not "expressed in defense
and foreign policy issues."
Melville was quick to emphasize that
these changes represent only a small,
initial modification in Soviet political
thinking. "Everything I say does not
represent a consensus in the Soviet so
ciety,' he said. "The exciting part is
that we disagree; there are no ready so
lutions."
He characterized the new political
thinking as being like "the American
way of experimenting with what works
and what doesn't work."
Political Science Prof. Jan Triska,
commenting that he was impressed

with Melville, said, "Here is a man
who is a product, both inside and
outside, of the new Soviet policy. I
have been studying Soviet foreign
policy tor 30 years — the change is as
tonishing."
Political Science Prof. Condoleezza
Rice characterized Melville as part of
the "younger breed of Soviet
scholars. She said she was impressed
that Melville spoke openly, adding that
Melville himself was indicative of a
new flexibility and willingness" on
the part of the Soviets. She cautioned,
however, that basic Soviet objectives
have not changed. "They still intend to
be a major power."
Prof. Alexander Dallin, director of
Russian and Eastern European
Studies, said the dialogue between
Melville and faculty members was very
congenial. "Andrei makes it especially
easy. . . . We made headway rather
rapidly. If we ran Soviet-American re
lations, it would be pretty easy."
