### 
This week the Reagan administration denied a
request from Rear Adm. Harold Bernson, the
U.S. military commander in the Persian Gulf, to
extend naval protection to non-U.S. flagged
tankers threatened by Iranian attacks. If
honored, this proposal would have significantly
increased a military presence whose justification
is already unconvincing.
Beginning this summer, U.S. forces have at
tempted to police Gulf shipping lanes made
hazardous from activities related to the Iran-Iraq
War. This policy, it would seem, is twofold: to
maintain the free flow of oil vital to a stable
world economy and to reaffirm American mili
tary authority abroad.
It is not particularly clear that oil prices are
dependent upon a safe Gulf. Many of the OPEC
nations, including Saudi Arabia and Iraq, export
their oil by land pipelines. The crude index, in
fact, has dropped during the recent period of
missile warfare and forced American reflagging
of the Kuwaiti tankers; the fear is not of an oil
shortage, but of a surplus brought about by ille
gal OPEC overproduction. Stable international
prices will not be bought with the U.S. Navy.
They depend on long-term cooperation within
the world oil community. Nor can the Navy
ensure stable domestic prices without a healthy
U.S. oil industry to back them up.
However, the country's oil producers have
found themselves bankrupt as a result of the
drop in the international crude index. The

Reagan administration should focus on what's
not getting pumped in Texas and Oklahoma and
how to invigorate those lost industries, as
opposed to what must be done to keep Iran
pumping.
American dominion overseas also has a cost,
and it is one that the country may no longer be
able to afford. In the face of an ever-increasing
deficit, the operation of a world defense network
is becoming a burden. The State Department
alone estimates a shortage of $84 million in funds
for fiscal 1988. Consulates and civil servants will
be eliminated. Better to staff embassies than
man warships.
The coupling of America's fading economic
situation with the lessons the Iran arms scandal
taught us about the abuse of executive power
both point to the sensibility of a U.S. withdrawal
from the Gulf. Congressional leaders have
rightly threatened to invoke the War Powers
Act, legislation that would, in principle, force
the executive to either declare official war inten
tions or remove all forces 60 days after their
deployment.
The Reagan administration has correctly
decided not to escalate its involvement in the
Gulf; what is needed now is swift evacuation.
That a disaster on the level of the Beirut Em
bassy bombing has been avoided can only be
considered lucky. The Gulf is a dangerous water
for U.S. foreign policy.
