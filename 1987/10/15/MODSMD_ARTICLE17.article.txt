# Bringing out the pinko commie
## 
### 
This summer, for the first time in my life, I
really paid attention to current events. It's
kind of scary, isn't it? I've lived for 19 years
on this planet and, until recently, I couldn't
sit still through Dan Rather. But I hit school
now with a feeling of concern for what's
going on around me.

The transformation would be a result, my
parents would argue, of hanging around too
many pinko commies at that damn radical
school I go to. Pinko commie, by the way, is
a term I learned courtesy of a friend who pos
sesses the ability to polarize the world into
two distinct camps: pinko commie radicals
and fascist baby killer pigs. My parents
picked up the former title with rapid and
good-natured ease in their dealings with me
this summer.
1 wish they could have spent freshman year
with me. Then they could have lived with a
roommate whose home was 10,000 miles
from Palo Alto and whose regard for Ameri
can beef, baseball and the Bill of Rights
wasn't quite as reverent as I d have liked it to
be. How could you be homesick, 1 wondered,
in the land of opportunity, the greatest nation

on earth? Didn't everyone want to be an
American? I thought she'd be dazzled; in
stead she was dazed and depressed. We
argued occasionally. Whatever America does
to Khadafi is OK, I told her at one point, be
cause Khadafi is a jerk. Granted, Hiroshima
and Nagasaki were a mess, I explained
defensively, but the Japanese were asking for
it. It's embarrassing to claim that attitude that
deems everything we Americans do, no mat
ter how ugly or brutal, as right.
I'm glad to say she's much happier now,
but I've curbed my tongue from saying that
she has "assimilated." The forum on racism
last spring, plus the new course. Western
Culture: An Alternative View, offered some
good questions — assimilated into what cul
ture? Should we all melt into anonymity in
the great white pot that should be, some say,
America?
One thing I'm assured of is a variety of ex
posure to new issues and ideas at every cor
ner of this University. I don't want to be
proud of everything my country does before I
know all the facts. Neither do 1 want to assert
that Stanford is essentially liberal or conser
vative. I could have attended the forum on
racism and formed a totally different opinion,
or I didn't have to go at all. I could have
laughed off my roommate, ignored any pro
fessors or avoided any friends whose views
made me uncomfortable. There are a lot of
students left at this University who can still
think for themselves. I think, therefore, that
the "pinko commie" in me was just waiting
to come out.

Sometimes I feel so filled with new ideas
and the assurance that this "wisdom" is cos
mic truth, that I have a hard time finding pa
tience with those who don't. Call it the self
righteousness of liberalism or conservatism.
Everyone is guilty of it at some point — espe
cially if you realize, as I do, just how unstable
or transient convictions can be. You have to
be realistic.
So as I vacillate between ranting and
reasoning, I get the twinge that hit actress
Glenn Close in"The Big Chill." "I'd hate to
think it was just . . . fashion," she says, as
the characters reminisce about their "cause"
in their sixties college experience. That's
what I wonder: How long will the fervor last,
and what will I do with all these novel resolu
tions and ideas? You become a lot more
idealistic during college, assaulted as you are
with so many ideas that preach the ultimate,
or the way things should be. So are we
looking at the world via ideals that a lot of
"the real world" has forgotten?
Maybe I'll emerge from Stanford with a
couple convictions clinging to me — convic
tions influenced by the Utopian ideals as well
as the diversity of opinion 1 experience at
Stanford. Force feeding is not what I'm here
for; I have to keep my ears open and wit
primed for the arguments I receive from all
sides. 1 like to keep in mind the quotation in
the "Approaching Stanford" booklet from a
very wise Stanford student: "Assume you'll
change your mind."
