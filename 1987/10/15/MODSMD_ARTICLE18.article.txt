## Stanford isn't a sheltered island 
### 
Is the University cracking
down on alcohol abuse by Stan
ford students? Yes. Are the
police also enforcing the public
law with more vigor? Again, yes.
Why? Have things changed all
that much? It can't be news that
some students get drunk and
cause trouble. ... So what's
going on?

James Lyons

I've heard these questions fre
quently during the past two
weeks and hope here to eliminate
some of the confusion about the
University's alcohol policy, Cali
fornia law and how the two relate
to student use — and misuse —
of alcohol.
First: Why the differences be
tween University policy and
police policy regarding alcohol
use by minors? It's a good ques
tion to raise just now.
Basically, the policies are dif
ferent because different institu
tions created them in response to
different needs and goals.
Indeed, University policies that
merely duplicate public laws
serve no purpose at all, because
public laws apply with equal
force on the campus as well as
off.
University policies exist to
promote our educational mis
sions and safeguard the quality of
campus life. The University
policy on alcohol does not ad
dress student age, because those
who crafted the policy many

years ago thought it more impor
tant to address the value of self
regulation, the need to dis
courage alcohol abuse and
protect members of the commu
nity from the behaviors that fre
quently accompany drunken
ness, and the need to educate
students about California law.
These are the foundations of
Stanford's policy, which was de
signed to maintain the appropri
ate educational environment. It
assumes that students are adults,
responsible for decisions about
how they will live their lives and
accountable for the conse
quences of those decisions.
It would be a mistake to con
clude that the absence of a Uni
versity rule about underage
drinking means that Stanford
condones it. It does not. We ex
pect all members of the Univer
sity to be law-abiding citizens.
A number of reasons account
for public laws: public safety,
prevailing notions of morality
and assuring that license fees,
beverage and sales taxes are as
sessed and paid. Even though
some may regard many of these
laws as inconsistent with current
norms of behavior, they remain
on the books and are enforced.
Enforcement may be uneven; but
take care — the absence of regu
lar enforcement doesn't mean the
law is gone. It's still there, and
the campus is not a refuge from
enforcement.
Back to student use of alcohol.
Attitudes toward alcohol use and
abuse are changing — on our
campus, in California and across

the country. There appears to be
less alcohol consumption by
adults, and there is ever
increasing impatience with
drunken behavior that has
destructive consequences.
Hence the crackdown on
campus, both by the Stanford
police and by the administration.

It would be a
mistake to conclude
that the absence of a
[rule about drinking]
means that Stanford
condones it.

It is a simple fact that public
events where alcohol is served
will draw more attention than
private events. If minors are
being served at the public events,
or if anyone is served to excess,
the odds of escaping notice
decrease and the odds of police
enforcement increase. Or when
the police respond to a noise
complaint and observe illegal be
havior: It will not be ignored, nor
should anyone expect it to be.
Strict adherence to University al
cohol policies and to party and
noise guidelines, however,
should help student groups avoid
situations that are troublesome.
Civil law raises a broader set of

questions. What happens when
someone drinks too much at a
party and then drives a car and
crashes? Who's responsible?
Who agonizes over a death, a
serious injury, a lost friend? And
who gets sued? Drivers, of
course — hut also those who did
the serving if those served were
underage or left the party drunk.
The bucks in such matters are big
— very big. The real impact,
however, transcends the law and
material consequences — and
that's the reality of having on
one's conscience the death or in
jury of another. Worry about this
more than the laws.
Stanford is not a rule
conscious place. Many of us hold
to that Utopian idea that good
judgment and personal and col
lective responsibility are better
than elaborate enforcement sys
tems. The Fundamental Standard
of conduct is simplicity itself and
has served us well since 19<)6.
Students at Stanford are ex
pected to show both within and
without the University such
respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this will be
sufficient cause for removal from
the University.
The Fundamental Standard
works well so long as everyone
pitches in to make it work.
But let's not kid ourselves.
We're not a tight little island
sheltered from public laws and
their enforcement.

dent affairs at Stanford.

courage alcohol abuse and
protect members of the commu
nity from the behaviors that fre
quently accompany drunken
ness, and the need to educate
students about California law.
These are the foundations of
Stanford's policy, which was de
signed to maintain the appropri
ate educational environment. It
assumes that students are adults,
responsible for decisions about
how they will live their lives and
accountable for the conse
quences of those decisions.
It would be a mistake to con
clude that the absence of a Uni
versity rule about underage
drinking means that Stanford
condones it. It does not. We ex
pect all members of the Univer
sity to be law-abiding citizens.
A number of reasons account
for public laws: public safety,
prevailing notions of morality
and assuring that license fees,
beverage and sales taxes are as
sessed and paid. Even though
some may regard many of these
laws as inconsistent with current
norms of behavior, they remain
on the books and are enforced.
Enforcement may be uneven; but
take care — the absence of regu
lar enforcement doesn't mean the
law is gone. It's still there, and
the campus is not a refuge from
enforcement.
Back to student use of alcohol.
Attitudes toward alcohol use and
abuse are changing — on our
campus, in California and across

the country. There appears to be
less alcohol consumption by
adults, and there is ever
increasing impatience with
drunken behavior that has
destructive consequences.
Hence the crackdown on
campus, both by the Stanford
police and by the administration.

It would be a
mistake to conclude
that the absence of a
[rule about drinking]
means that Stanford
condones it.

It is a simple fact that public
events where alcohol is served
will draw more attention than
private events. If minors are
being served at the public events,
or if anyone is served to excess,
the odds of escaping notice
decrease and the odds of police
enforcement increase. Or when
the police respond to a noise
complaint and observe illegal be
havior: It will not be ignored, nor
should anyone expect it to be.
Strict adherence to University al
cohol policies and to party and
noise guidelines, however,
should help student groups avoid
situations that are troublesome.
Civil law raises a broader set of

questions. What happens when
someone drinks too much at a
party and then drives a car and
crashes? Who's responsible?
Who agonizes over a death, a
serious injury, a lost friend? And
who gets sued? Drivers, of
course — hut also those who did
the serving if those served were
underage or left the party drunk.
The bucks in such matters are big
— very big. The real impact,
however, transcends the law and
material consequences — and
that's the reality of having on
one's conscience the death or in
jury of another. Worry about this
more than the laws.
Stanford is not a rule
conscious place. Many of us hold
to that Utopian idea that good
judgment and personal and col
lective responsibility are better
than elaborate enforcement sys
tems. The Fundamental Standard
of conduct is simplicity itself and
has served us well since 19<)6.
Students at Stanford are ex
pected to show both within and
without the University such
respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this will be
sufficient cause for removal from
the University.
The Fundamental Standard
works well so long as everyone
pitches in to make it work.
But let's not kid ourselves.
We're not a tight little island
sheltered from public laws and
their enforcement.
James Lyons is the dean of stu
dent affairs at Stanford.
Is the University cracking
down on alcohol abuse by Stan
ford students? Yes. Are the
police also enforcing the public
law with more vigor? Again, yes.
Why? Have things changed all
that much? It can't be news that
some students get drunk and
cause trouble. ... So what's
going on?

I've heard these questions fre
quently during the past two
weeks and hope here to eliminate
some of the confusion about the
University's alcohol policy, Cali
fornia law and how the two relate
to student use — and misuse —
of alcohol.
First: Why the differences be
tween University policy and
police policy regarding alcohol
use by minors? It's a good ques
tion to raise just now.
Basically, the policies are dif
ferent because different institu
tions created them in response to
different needs and goals.
Indeed, University policies that
merely duplicate public laws
serve no purpose at all, because
public laws apply with equal
force on the campus as well as
off.
University policies exist to
promote our educational mis
sions and safeguard the quality of
campus life. The University
policy on alcohol does not ad
dress student age, because those
who crafted the policy many

years ago thought it more impor
tant to address the value of self
regulation, the need to dis
courage alcohol abuse and
protect members of the commu
nity from the behaviors that fre
quently accompany drunken
ness, and the need to educate
students about California law.
