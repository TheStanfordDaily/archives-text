Ignoring quality
is the tragedy
Although 1 am familiar with
only the main tenets of both
"The Closing of the American
Mind" and "Cultural Literacy,"
it is apparent that the authors'
points are well-taken, especially
in light of their "critique" by
Steve Bryan in the Oct. 8 view
point. Bryan's "relativist" asser
tion that it doesn't matter what
one studies as long as it "gets
you thinking about your own life
and values" is mistaken. Quality
is not relative.
The pool of allusions and as
sociations we share as a medium
for discourse has a direct bearing
on the development of the mind.
When that pool is filled with ma
terial from watered-down,
"safe" textbooks as well as from
vapid media vehicles and person
alities, the courses of conversa
tion and writing cannot rise to

any level of intellectual advance
ment.
Bryan's dismissal of Hirsch's
book with the single line "it has
about as much to do with edu
cation as Joan Collins has to do
with marital bliss" typifies the
shallowness of leaving aside
serious analysis in favor of easily
accessible "pop" comparisons
that require no directed thought.
Perhaps the danger lies in being
too "culturally literate".
Instead of choosing certain
works or personalities to con
sider further (the method through
which everyone from Plato to
Roman Polanski survives), most
allow themselves to accept
whatever is displayed to them on
the screen, radio or in book
stores. Much more tragic than ig
noring the "classics," however,
is this ignorance of quality
which, sadly, hinders the crea
tion of progressing, first-rate
works in our own time.
