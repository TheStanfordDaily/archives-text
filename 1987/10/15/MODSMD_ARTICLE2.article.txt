# Doctors testify against NCAA
## 
### Nick Anderson Mike MacCrystall Staff writers 
Two pharmaceutical experts
called the NCAA's drug-testing
methods inaccurate and un
reliable yesterday in the second
day of hearings to determine the
constitutionality of the NCAA
drug-testing program.
Asked by Robert Van Nest, at
torney for Stanford athletes Jen
nifer Hill and Barry McKeever,
whether the NCAA's tests were
accurate enough to determine a
player's eligibility, Dr. Randall
Basele, a forensic and clinical
toxicologist, testified that "for
the vast majority of the drugs
being tested, I would say,
'No.' "
Judge Conrad Rushing of the
Santa Clara County Superior
Court, presiding over the case,
may rule next week whether to

grant Stanford athletes a prelimi
nary injunction exempting them
from the nationwide drug testing
program.
Basele, director of the Chemi
cal Toxicology Institute in Foster
City, was joined on the witness
stand by Dr. David Lowenthal,
director of clinical pharmacology
at the Sinai School of Medicine in
New York. Both were called to
testify by the students' attor
neys.
The doctors were critical of
current drug-testing techniques.
The chemical nature of many
drugs, especially steroids,
prevents accurate analysis of an
athlete's urine in the search for
such illegal drugs, explained
Lowenthal under cross-exam
ination by NCAA attorney Rich
ard Archer.
Basele said it was impossible
to determine the presence of a

specific drug in an athlete's sys
tem. "Steroids and their primary
compounds are numerous, and
many are present naturally in the
body," he said.
"Testing methods used by the
NCAA provide no information
regarding when the drugs were
taken, in what dosage, and what
effect, if any, the drugs had on
the athlete," he added.
Basele expressed concern that
many drug-testing laboratories
across the country employ differ

ent standards in interpreting test
results, contending that different
technicians within the same lab
may render different judgments
on similar results.
"The way it is now, one tech
nician might call the result posi
tive and another call it negative,"
he said.
Lowenthal argued that many
of the drugs on the NCAA's
banned drug list are present in
over-the-counter cold and asth
ma remedies. "The metha
amphetamine present in a Vieks
inhaler would produce a positive
result in a drug test," he said.
Lowenthal cited the case of
Clarence Nunn, a football player

at San Diego State University,
who was barred from playing in a
bowl game last year because a
drug test administered to him
prior to the game turned up posi
tive. Nunn claimed to have taken
a nasal decongestant the day
before for a cold.
The remaining two days of
hearings should include tes
timony by McKeever, a senior
linebacker on the football team.
Paul Walters, director of the
Cowell Student Health Center,
and Women's Gymnastics Coach
Homer Sardina. The NCAA also
plans to call expert witnesses on
its behalf.
