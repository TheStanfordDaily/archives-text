## Food Service explains Labor costs lead to high prices 
### Thomas Vajda 
High prices and mandatory meal plans
are common complaints among Stanford
students to University Food Service. Many
students see themselves paying exorbitant
prices for the same type of meal service
other universities provide at lower cost.
Although food service is a favorite topic
of abuse among students everywhere, com
plaints about high prices at Stanford are
grounded in fact. A 1986 ASSU survey of
80 universities affiliated with the National
Association of College and University
Food Services showed Stanford's food ser
vice to be among the most expensive in the
country.
The cost of a meal plan varied greatly
among different universities (see chart).
Some cases in point: 20 meals per week at
Tufts University cost only $1040 a year,
while at William and Mary 19 meals per
week cost $1588. Brandeis offered the most
expensive meal plan listed in the ASSU
summary — 21 meals per week at a cost of
$2350 per year.
At Stanford, by comparison, a 19-meal
plan cost $2495 last year. This year that fig
ure has jumped to $2657, an increase of
over 6 percent. The least expensive plan of
fered by Food Service, the 10-meal plan
available only in the Row Houses, will cost
$2366.
However, the prices charged by different
schools are not set arbitrarily. Instead, they
are directly dependent upon factors such as
overhead, food waste and the wages of un
ion and student workers.
According to James Keeton, manager of
Food Service, high prices at Stanford are
directly related to the environment in which
Food Service operates. Expensive board
plans are due primarily to the existence of
many small dining facilities instead of a few
large ones. This creates great inefficiencies
in the system, he said.
For example, at most major universities
there are usually two or three dining halls
— at Stanford there are 16. According to
Keeton, the existence of so many small
dining units greatly increases labor costs.
"Fewer locations would require fewer
Food Service workers, because they could
handle higher volumes," Keeton said.

There are currently 117 full-time profes
sional Food Service workers employed by
the University. Of these, 15 to 20 are in
management positions. Most of these
managers earn between $33,000 and
$38,000 per year. Student hashers are also
paid well. The $5.80-an-hour wage is far
better than the equivalent at UC-Berkeley,
according to Keeton.
High labor costs are the primary reason
Food Service is so expensive. "Forty-five
percent of each food dollar goes to wages,"
Keeton said. High prices are therefore in
evitable. "[lt's] the nature of the beast,"
Keeton said.
The University could cut costs by con
solidating the number of dining halls and
thus take advantage of economies of scale
— cooking meals in high volume lowers the
cost per meal. Saving money through
economies of scale, however, is not the
first priority of University Food Service.
Eating meals with fellow students is a
major component of residential education
and is the rationale for the organization of
Food Service into numerous separate
dining halls. It also explains the mandatory
nature of meal service at all houses,
whether or not they are run by the Univer
sity.
University officials hope that interaction

among students and between students and
faculty can take place in the comfortable,
close-knit atmosphere that exists in
smaller, dorm-based dining areas. "The
smaller unit is at the heart of the program,"
according to Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson. University Food Ser
vice must also cover building costs and
debt services. Additionally, due to Univer
sity regulations, Food Service is required to
pay 15 percent of its income to help cover
the overhead of other University offices
that earn no money directly — such as the
fire and police departments. In fact, only
about 30 percent of a student's board bill
goes toward the cost of food.
Differences in cost between the 10-, 14-
and 19-meal plans are minimal. In deter
mining prices for the various plans, only the
cost of food is taken into consideration,
since it is the only variable.
This explains the otherwise suspicious
fact that the difference in the yearly price of
a 19-meal plan and a 10-meal plan is only
$291. In other words, a 47 percent reduc
tion in meals taken corresponds to only an
11 percent savings.
In the prices of the different plans, there

is also a built-in "missed meal
factor." This means that in
budgeting costs it is assumed that
students with smaller meal plans
will miss fewer meals than stu
dents with larger plans.
It is not only high prices th.it
trouble students, however. Con
venience and quality are also
areas that many feel need atten
tion. In an effort to meet some of
these needs, the Council of Presi
dents is forming a food service
task force this year to investigate
students' complaints and sugges
tions.
Goals include extended dinner
hours at one of the dor
mitory complexes, a 10-meal
plan option at all dorms and the
ability to use meal cards at Tres
idder Union on a credit basis.
While many would welcome
these changes, cost is still the
paramount concern. Since only a

lower costs, high food service
prices will continue.
Of course, for those who feel
that the type of dorm atmosphere
promoted by Office of Residen
tial Education is not worth the
cost, there is always the option of
living in Mirrielees, Manzanitaor
Mountain View. While this may
not be the best choice, it is the
only alternative available.
