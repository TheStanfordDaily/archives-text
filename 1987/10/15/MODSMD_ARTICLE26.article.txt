# New weapon used in war on heart disease
## Education about cholesterol is the key 
### Lydia Selling Staff writer 
Despite a steady decline in
coronary heart disease mortality
since the 19605, cardiovascular
diseases are still the leading
cause of death in the United
States. While many factors, in
cluding heredity, can contribute
to the development of heart
disease, an estimated 46 percent
of all deaths are attributable to
high blood cholesterol levels.

Cholesterol is a fat-like sub
stance produced by the body and
found in all animal tissues. It is
dangerous because it can accu
mulate in the heart's arterial
walls and impede blood flow to
the heart's muscles. This can
eventually result in heart attack
and death.
Cholesterol comes in two
forms: the low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) variety and
the high-denstity lipoprotein
(HDL) variety. It is LDL
cholesterol that is dangerous, be
cause it contains large amounts
of cholesterol and very little
protein.
HDL-cholesterol, on the other
hand, contains small amounts of
cholesterol and other fats, as well
as large amounts of protein. High
levels of HDL are actually good
for the body, because they are
believed to protect against coro
nary heart disease.
By 1990, the United States De
partment of Health and Human
Services hopes that through im
proved nutrition American adults

will reduce cholesterol levels to
200 milligrams per deciliter of
blood (mg/dl) — a level currently
exceeded by over 50 percent of
adults. The goal was set because
there is a direct correlation be
tween levels over 200 mg/dl and
cardiovascular disease.
According to the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute,
this goal might not go far enough.
The institute recommends an
LDL level of 130 mg/dl and sug
gests that a level over 160 mg/dl
puts one at great risk for heart
disease.
In an attempt to ameliorate the
situation, the institute has
launched a National Cholesterol
Education Program. The pro
gram's objectives are to
reduce the risk of heart disease
through improved detection,
diagnosis and treatment of high
blood cholesterol levels.
Recently issued guidelines
from the National Cholesterol
Education Program pertain to
people age 20 and older; young
people are not immune from
cholesterol buildup. Dr. David
Maron, director of the Pre
ventive Medicine Clinic at the
Stanford Center for Research in
Disease Prevention, said, "If you
are old enough to vote, you are
old enough to have your choles
terol taken."
For its part, Stanford asks en
tering students to provide their
cholesterol levels on their medi
cal forms, according to Dr. John
Dorman, assistant director of the
Cowell Student Health Center. If
there is a family history of high
blood pressure or other risk fac
tors, the student's physician will
usually recommend a cholesterol
level test.
Joel Preston, vice president of
Corporate Planning and Commu
nications for the American Heart

Association, said his organiza
tion has recently launched a
cholesterol education program
for physicians that aims to train
one out of every four primary
care physicians in the early de
tection and treatment of choles
terol problems.
Preston said the program is in
part a response to a growing
awareness among physicians
about the dangers of cholesterol.
A 1983 study showed that only
one-third of doctors surveyed
thought lowering blood choles
terol level would lower the risk of
heart disease. In 1986, however,
a similar survey found that two
thirds of the physicians thought
decreasing blood cholesterol
would reduce the risk of heart
disease.
Now, according to Preston,
"reasonable persons looking at
the evidence will definitely say
there is a link. The public has

been way ahead of the medical
community in this regard."
The Heart, Lung and BI»od In
stitute recommends that all
Americans adopt a "heart
smart" diet in which 15 percent
of one s caloric intake comes
from protein, 55 percent from
carbohydrates and only 30 per
cent from fat. Calories from
saturated fats should be limited
to 10 percent or less of the total
intake.
Dietary cholesterol should not
exceed 300 milligrams per day —
a level almost doubled by the
average American, who con
sumes about 500 milligrams
daily. The average American
woman consumes about 320 mil
ligrams.
Major reductions in choles
terol levels to recommended
amounts are possible, but not
without some self-sacrifice.
"Depending on the baseline diet
and motivation, if you are eating
the average American diet and
willing to go on a Pritikin-type
diet, you can see a 20 percent fall
in [your cholesterol level],"

Maron said. "The question is to
what extent are Americans will
ing to adopt a low-fat diet?".
Nutritionists with Stanford
University Food Services try to
help students lower their choles
terol intake by offering white
meat, fish, chicken or turkey at
each meal. "This is a conscious
decision," said Lois Ohms, as
sistant manager and dietitian for
University Food Service.
Ohms said Food Service has
tried to limit the number of times
French fries and hamburgers are
served, uses more baked fish
than fried fish and gives students

the choice of margarine or butter.
Some residence halls are offering
just skim and lowfat milk.
Ana Marcovich-Kozlowski,
Health Promotion Specialist for
Nutrition and Fitness in the
Health Promotion Program at
Cowell, is analyzing data on stu

"Some students think if they
have a salad that they are having
a low-fat meal. But with salad
dressing, etc., they end up with a
3000-calorie salad. They would
be better off going through the
food line," Marcovich-
Kozlowski said.
To combat ignorance, the pro
gram will aim to provide
nutritonal messages before stu
dents enter the food line.

disease, an estimated 46 percent
of all deaths are attributable to
high blood cholesterol levels.

Cholesterol is a fat-like sub
stance produced by the body and
found in all animal tissues. It is
dangerous because it can accu
mulate in the heart's arterial
walls and impede blood flow to
the heart's muscles. This can
eventually result in heart attack
and death.
Cholesterol comes in two
forms: the low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) variety and
the high-denstity lipoprotein
(HDL) variety. It is LDL
cholesterol that is dangerous, be
cause it contains large amounts
of cholesterol and very little
protein.
HDL-cholesterol, on the other
hand, contains small amounts of
cholesterol and other fats, as well
as large amounts of protein. High
levels of HDL are actually good
for the body, because they are
believed to protect against coro
nary heart disease.
By 1990, the United States De
partment of Health and Human
Services hopes that through im
proved nutrition American adults

will reduce cholesterol levels to
200 milligrams per deciliter of
blood (mg/dl) — a level currently
exceeded by over 50 percent of
adults. The goal was set because
there is a direct correlation be
tween levels over 200 mg/dl and
cardiovascular disease.
According to the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute,
this goal might not go far enough.
The institute recommends an
LDL level of 130 mg/dl and sug
gests that a level over 160 mg/dl
puts one at great risk for heart
disease.
In an attempt to ameliorate the
situation, the institute has
launched a National Cholesterol
Education Program. The pro
gram's objectives are to
reduce the risk of heart disease
through improved detection,
diagnosis and treatment of high
blood cholesterol levels.
Recently issued guidelines
from the National Cholesterol
Education Program pertain to
people age 20 and older; young
people are not immune from
cholesterol buildup. Dr. David
Maron, director of the Pre
ventive Medicine Clinic at the
Stanford Center for Research in
Disease Prevention, said, "If you
are old enough to vote, you are
old enough to have your choles
terol taken."
For its part, Stanford asks en
tering students to provide their
cholesterol levels on their medi
cal forms, according to Dr. John
Dorman, assistant director of the
Cowell Student Health Center. If
there is a family history of high
blood pressure or other risk fac
tors, the student's physician will
usually recommend a cholesterol
level test.
Joel Preston, vice president of
Corporate Planning and Commu
nications for the American Heart

Association, said his organiza
tion has recently launched a
cholesterol education program
for physicians that aims to train
one out of every four primary
care physicians in the early de
tection and treatment of choles
terol problems.
Preston said the program is in
part a response to a growing
awareness among physicians
about the dangers of cholesterol.
A 1983 study showed that only
one-third of doctors surveyed
thought lowering blood choles
terol level would lower the risk of
heart disease. In 1986, however,
a similar survey found that two
thirds of the physicians thought
decreasing blood cholesterol
would reduce the risk of heart
disease.
Now, according to Preston,
"reasonable persons looking at
the evidence will definitely say
there is a link. The public has

been way ahead of the medical
community in this regard."
The Heart, Lung and BI»od In
stitute recommends that all
Americans adopt a "heart
smart" diet in which 15 percent
of one s caloric intake comes
from protein, 55 percent from
carbohydrates and only 30 per
cent from fat. Calories from
saturated fats should be limited
to 10 percent or less of the total
intake.
Dietary cholesterol should not
exceed 300 milligrams per day —
a level almost doubled by the
average American, who con
sumes about 500 milligrams
daily. The average American
woman consumes about 320 mil
ligrams.
Major reductions in choles
terol levels to recommended
amounts are possible, but not
without some self-sacrifice.
"Depending on the baseline diet
and motivation, if you are eating
the average American diet and
willing to go on a Pritikin-type
diet, you can see a 20 percent fall
in [your cholesterol level],"

Maron said. "The question is to
what extent are Americans will
ing to adopt a low-fat diet?".
Nutritionists with Stanford
University Food Services try to
help students lower their choles
terol intake by offering white
meat, fish, chicken or turkey at
each meal. "This is a conscious
decision," said Lois Ohms, as
sistant manager and dietitian for
University Food Service.
Ohms said Food Service has
tried to limit the number of times
French fries and hamburgers are
served, uses more baked fish
than fried fish and gives students

the choice of margarine or butter.
Some residence halls are offering
just skim and lowfat milk.
Ana Marcovich-Kozlowski,
Health Promotion Specialist for

"Some students think if they
have a salad that they are having
a low-fat meal. But with salad
dressing, etc., they end up with a
3000-calorie salad. They would
be better off going through the

To combat ignorance, the pro

nutritonal messages before stu
