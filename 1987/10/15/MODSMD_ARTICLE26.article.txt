# New weapon used in war on heart disease
## Education about cholesterol is the key 
### Lydia Selling Staff writer 
Despite a steady decline in
coronary heart disease mortality
since the 19605, cardiovascular
diseases are still the leading
cause of death in the United
States. While many factors, in
cluding heredity, can contribute
to the development of heart
disease, an estimated 46 percent
of all deaths are attributable to
high blood cholesterol levels.

Cholesterol is a fat-like sub
stance produced by the body and
found in all animal tissues. It is
dangerous because it can accu
mulate in the heart's arterial
walls and impede blood flow to
the heart's muscles. This can
eventually result in heart attack
and death.
Cholesterol comes in two
forms: the low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) variety and
the high-denstity lipoprotein
(HDL) variety. It is LDL
cholesterol that is dangerous, be
cause it contains large amounts
of cholesterol and very little
protein.
HDL-cholesterol, on the other
hand, contains small amounts of
cholesterol and other fats, as well
as large amounts of protein. High
levels of HDL are actually good
for the body, because they are
believed to protect against coro
nary heart disease.
By 1990, the United States De
partment of Health and Human
Services hopes that through im
proved nutrition American adults

will reduce cholesterol levels to
200 milligrams per deciliter of
blood (mg/dl) â€” a level currently
exceeded by over 50 percent of
adults. The goal was set because
there is a direct correlation be
tween levels over 200 mg/dl and
cardiovascular disease.
According to the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute,
this goal might not go far enough.
The institute recommends an
LDL level of 130 mg/dl and sug
gests that a level over 160 mg/dl
puts one at great risk for heart
disease.
In an attempt to ameliorate the
situation, the institute has
launched a National Cholesterol
Education Program. The pro
gram's objectives are to
reduce the risk of heart disease
through improved detection,
diagnosis and treatment of high
blood cholesterol levels.
Recently issued guidelines
from the National Cholesterol
Education Program pertain to
people age 20 and older; young
people are not immune from
cholesterol buildup. Dr. David
Maron, director of the Pre
ventive Medicine Clinic at the
Stanford Center for Research in
Disease Prevention, said, "If you
are old enough to vote, you are
old enough to have your choles
terol taken."
For its part, Stanford asks en
tering students to provide their
cholesterol levels on their medi
cal forms, according to Dr. John
Dorman, assistant director of the
Cowell Student Health Center. If
there is a family history of high
blood pressure or other risk fac
tors, the student's physician will
usually recommend a cholesterol
level test.
