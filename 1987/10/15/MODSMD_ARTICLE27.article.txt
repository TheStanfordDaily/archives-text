## Culinary tramps discover the Row's delights 
### Susan Stellin Ceri Jones 
We ate. We ate a lot. Begin
ning as wide-eyed innocents
weaned on Branner and Wilbur
Food Service, we became, in
short, culinary tramps.
"We" are Rusty and Billi, two
redheaded coeds endeavoring to
discover the gastronomic perils
and pleasures of "The Row."
Our choice of establishments was
randomly generated by the home
office in Gilroy. We do
apologize, however, for the
omission of a fraternal represen
tative. Sigma Chi social engage
ments appeared to preclude our
reservation.
Day One: 558 May field Ave.
We decided to start at the top.
Stepping apprehensively into the
elegant foyer of 558 May field, we
were enveloped by an aroma of
what we initially perceived to be
sweet and sour. There was, in
fact, nothing to support our as
sumption of Chinese fare. That
evening we dined on barbecued
chicken, Caesar salad, fresh
fruit, rice pilaf and steamed corn.
All the same, the meal was a
joy to the senses. Rusty felt the
barbecue sauce sang lightly upon
her tongue. However, a com
panion averred that she was, per
haps, tone deaf. Billi was partial
to the poultry's accompani
ments, lauding the abundance of
Caesar salad and the intricately
carved watermelon basket.
The crescendo of the entree al
most overshadowed our disap
pointment at of missing out on
the most important course of any
meal — dessert. We learned our
first lesson of Row dining that
night: Move it or lose it — espe
cially when it comes to home
made brownies. House residents

assured us the pastry treats were
divine, though Billi was some
what consoled by an Eskimo pie.
Rusty wasn't.
558 can only be compared to a
ski lodge in the Swiss Alps — or
so we understand, never having
sojourned in one. The only jar
ring note appeared in the un
sightly form of an avocado green
refrigerator standing obtrusively
near the dining room's entrance.
Residents seemed pleased with
their cuisine, but there was one
complaint: "We don't have big
strawberries." Despite this grave
deficiency, we understand why
558 edged out Storey in last
year's Draw.
Day Two: Columbae
Feeling brave after a success
ful first review, we decided to go
out on a limb. Still relative
neophytes, we ventured into the
unknown territory of cooperative
living. (Actually, we cheated.
Two friends of ours were cooking
that evening.)
Approaching from the side
walk, we were greeted by an as
sortment of Columbians, er . . .
Columbaeans, feasting upon the
front steps or, actually, feasting
upon pasta while seated upon the
front steps. Rusty was concerned
about the possibility of food
"running out," but her fear was
allayed by the sight of a full wok,
easily two feet in diameter,
balanced on the dining room
table.
Rummaging in the kitchen for
dishes, Billi unearthed two pot
tery bowls, a plastic cup and an
avocado green mug. Rusty
searched the silverware drawer,
conveniently placed on the table,
discovering a pair of chopsticks
for herself and a spoon for her
companion.

The pasta was good. Honestly.
Prepared with 40 "handfuls" of
spinach noodles, it was cooked
with the proper vegetarian en
semble of fresh tomatoes, corn,
mushrooms and green beans. Op

tional seasoning was provided,
and Rusty liberally festooned her
bowl with garlic salt — from a
two-pound box.
Remembering the lesson of the
previous evening, Billi was quick

to get to the kitchen at the smell
of dessert wafting from the oven.
The honey-coconut bars were
more reminiscent of the former,
as was conceded by one of their
creators.
Rusty labelled the dining room
"comfortable," appreciating the
French doors, a spider plant
mural and a poster of Martin Lut
her King Jr. The atmosphere was
friendly, as evidenced by one
resident's concern that house
members catch a view of an im
pending sunset. Rules of the
Kitchen were limited to three: I)
Don't use meat; 2) Cook enough;
and 3) Don't burn down the
kitchen. Cooperative living at its
finest.
Day Three: Storey House
We knew it was going to hap
pen sometime. We just didn't
know where, and we didn't know
when. "It" was Mexican food,
the bane of Billi's existence.
Rusty, always partial to
Mexican fare, expressed no
similar chagrin, heaping her taco
"boat" with ground beef, beans,
lettuce, tomatoes and sour
cream. Praising the boat as
"revolutionary," she was never
theless bothered by the
"awkwardly shredded lettuce."
Billi resigned herself to
"making your own salad," but
was pleasantly surprised by the
choice of poppy seed dressing.
The fruit bowl was a surprise as
well, appearing to be a mixture of
apples and oranges, but in reality
consisting of jicama and oranges,
a combination foreign to this
reviewer's Midwestern palate.
Rusty went into rhapsodies
over dessert, a choice between
two flavors of Dreyer's ice
cream, warm Mexican chocolate
cake. Weight Watchers' frozen

orange bars or all of the above.
We limited ourselves to choco
late chocolate chip ice cream and
cake, which was notable for the
subtle hint of Mexico in its frost
ing.
Despite our preoccupation
with the food, one eye was al
ways open to Storey's ambiance
— which is open only to those
with draw numbers considerably
lower than most mortals'. The
pine tables and chairs allowed
comfortable seating for the whole
family, and the plastic tumblers
further gave the air of a gracious
home.
The walls, done in an original
Navajo white, were simply
graced by a Vandenberg print,
entitled "See Horse," portraying
a seahorse impaled on the tines
of a dinner fork. The fork theme
came back to haunt us when a
fork shortage was announced.
While we may have been
suspected of causing the crisis,
we refused to relinquish our
utensils.
At Storey we didn't find the
casual atmosphere characteristic
of other Row houses, but dinner
was appetizing all the same.
Even Billi left sated, in spite of
the (gasp!) Mexican meal.
Day Four: I.a Maison Francaise
It was to be a magical evening,
a brush with culture, a night of
transfiguration. We dreamed of
La Tour Eiffel, crepes and
Camembert. . . . Instead, we ex
perienced Chinese cuisine.
While Billi was somewhat put
out by the ethnic mix-up. Rusty
was enthralled by the beef stir
fry's subtle finger flavor. The
tender main course rested on a
bed of fluffy, white rice and was

accompanied by the typical salad
bar, a fruit melange and a second
choice of fruit salad.
One apparent reference to the
French theme was the presence
of authentic baguettes on each
long, wooden table.
The decor had what could only
be described as "character,"
consisting of six tables sturdy
enough to survive a Parisian
lycee, windows opening onto a
secluded patio, and the ever
present Navajo white walls.
Needless to say, we were
charmed.
Day Five: American Studies
House
Our task, by this time, had
begun to wear thin, and so had
our sense of humor. Unfortun
ately, our taste buds hadn't.
As one resident aptly de
scribed eating at American
Studies, "I had no idea that I was

the American and the studies
would be to determine just what I
was eating."
That evening's meal consisted
of pizza with a mosaic of top
pings: mushroom, pineapple,
bacon, onion, pepperoni, ham
and green pepper. Green pepper,
Billi's nemesis, was apparent in
every combination.
If you don't mind cold cereal
for dinner, AmStud dining is a
unique experience — as long as
you have something else to come
home to.
Day Six: Grove >
Day six found us at the end of
our rope, er . . . road, and stand
ing before us were the worn steps
and chipped pillars of 584
Mayfield Ave. All we wanted
was a meat and potatoes meal: no
surprises, no Vandenberg prints,
no chopsticks and no green pep
pers. We got it.
We feasted upon prime rib,
baked potatoes, French cut green
beans and homemade biscuits.
We "made our own sundaes" for
dessert. Thanksgiving never
tasted better.
We ate. We ate a lot. Begin

We limited ourselves to choco
late chocolate chip ice cream and
cake, which was notable for the
subtle hint of Mexico in its frost
ing.
Despite our preoccupation
with the food, one eye was al
ways open to Storey's ambiance
— which is open only to those
with draw numbers considerably
lower than most mortals'. The
pine tables and chairs allowed
comfortable seating for the whole
family, and the plastic tumblers
further gave the air of a gracious
home.
The walls, done in an original
Navajo white, were simply
graced by a Vandenberg print,
entitled "See Horse," portraying
a seahorse impaled on the tines
of a dinner fork. The fork theme
came back to haunt us when a
fork shortage was announced.
While we may have been
suspected of causing the crisis,
we refused to relinquish our
utensils.
At Storey we didn't find the
casual atmosphere characteristic
of other Row houses, but dinner
was appetizing all the same.
Even Billi left sated, in spite of
the (gasp!) Mexican meal.
Day Four: I.a Maison Francaise
It was to be a magical evening,
a brush with culture, a night of
transfiguration. We dreamed of
La Tour Eiffel, crepes and
Camembert. . . . Instead, we ex

accompanied by the typical salad
bar, a fruit melange and a second
choice of fruit salad.
One apparent reference to the
French theme was the presence
of authentic baguettes on each
long, wooden table.
The decor had what could only
be described as "character,"
consisting of six tables sturdy
enough to survive a Parisian
lycee, windows opening onto a
secluded patio, and the ever
present Navajo white walls.
Needless to say, we were
charmed.
Day Five: American Studies
House
Our task, by this time, had
begun to wear thin, and so had
our sense of humor. Unfortun
ately, our taste buds hadn't.
As one resident aptly de
scribed eating at American
Studies, "I had no idea that I was

the American and the studies
would be to determine just what I
was eating."
That evening's meal consisted
of pizza with a mosaic of top
pings: mushroom, pineapple,
bacon, onion, pepperoni, ham
and green pepper. Green pepper,
Billi's nemesis, was apparent in
every combination.
If you don't mind cold cereal
for dinner, AmStud dining is a
unique experience — as long as
you have something else to come
home to.
Day Six: Grove >
Day six found us at the end of
our rope, er . . . road, and stand
ing before us were the worn steps
and chipped pillars of 584
Mayfield Ave. All we wanted
was a meat and potatoes meal: no
surprises, no Vandenberg prints,
no chopsticks and no green pep
pers. We got it.
We feasted upon prime rib,
baked potatoes, French cut green
beans and homemade biscuits.
We "made our own sundaes" for
dessert. Thanksgiving never
tasted better.
We ate. We ate a lot. Begin
ning as wide-eyed innocents
weaned on Branner and Wilbur
Food Service, we became, in
short, culinary tramps.
"We" are Rusty and Billi, two
redheaded coeds endeavoring to
discover the gastronomic perils
and pleasures of "The Row."
Our choice of establishments was
randomly generated by the home
office in Gilroy. We do
apologize, however, for the
omission of a fraternal represen
tative. Sigma Chi social engage
ments appeared to preclude our
reservation.
Day One: 558 May field Ave.
We decided to start at the top.
Stepping apprehensively into the
elegant foyer of 558 May field, we
were enveloped by an aroma of
what we initially perceived to be
sweet and sour. There was, in
fact, nothing to support our as
sumption of Chinese fare. That
evening we dined on barbecued
chicken, Caesar salad, fresh
fruit, rice pilaf and steamed corn.
All the same, the meal was a
joy to the senses. Rusty felt the
barbecue sauce sang lightly upon
her tongue. However, a com
panion averred that she was, per
haps, tone deaf. Billi was partial
to the poultry's accompani
ments, lauding the abundance of
Caesar salad and the intricately
carved watermelon basket.
The crescendo of the entree al
most overshadowed our disap
pointment at of missing out on
the most important course of any
meal — dessert. We learned our
first lesson of Row dining that
night: Move it or lose it — espe
cially when it comes to home
made brownies. House residents

assured us the pastry treats were
divine, though Billi was some
what consoled by an Eskimo pie.
Rusty wasn't.
558 can only be compared to a
ski lodge in the Swiss Alps — or
so we understand, never having
sojourned in one. The only jar
ring note appeared in the un
sightly form of an avocado green
refrigerator standing obtrusively
near the dining room's entrance.
Residents seemed pleased with
their cuisine, but there was one
complaint: "We don't have big
strawberries." Despite this grave
deficiency, we understand why
558 edged out Storey in last
year's Draw.
Day Two: Columbae
Feeling brave after a success
ful first review, we decided to go
out on a limb. Still relative
neophytes, we ventured into the
unknown territory of cooperative
living. (Actually, we cheated.
Two friends of ours were cooking
that evening.)
Approaching from the side
walk, we were greeted by an as
sortment of Columbians, er . . .
Columbaeans, feasting upon the
front steps or, actually, feasting
upon pasta while seated upon the
front steps. Rusty was concerned
about the possibility of food
"running out," but her fear was
allayed by the sight of a full wok,
easily two feet in diameter,
balanced on the dining room
table.
Rummaging in the kitchen for
dishes, Billi unearthed two pot
tery bowls, a plastic cup and an
avocado green mug. Rusty
searched the silverware drawer,
conveniently placed on the table,
discovering a pair of chopsticks
for herself and a spoon for her
companion.

The pasta was good. Honestly.
Prepared with 40 "handfuls" of
spinach noodles, it was cooked
with the proper vegetarian en
semble of fresh tomatoes, corn,
mushrooms and green beans. Op

tional seasoning was provided,
and Rusty liberally festooned her
bowl with garlic salt — from a
two-pound box.
Remembering the lesson of the
previous evening, Billi was quick

to get to the kitchen at the smell
of dessert wafting from the oven.
The honey-coconut bars were
more reminiscent of the former,
as was conceded by one of their
creators.
Rusty labelled the dining room
"comfortable," appreciating the
French doors, a spider plant
mural and a poster of Martin Lut
her King Jr. The atmosphere was
friendly, as evidenced by one
resident's concern that house
members catch a view of an im
pending sunset. Rules of the
Kitchen were limited to three: I)
Don't use meat; 2) Cook enough;
and 3) Don't burn down the
kitchen. Cooperative living at its
finest.
Day Three: Storey House
We knew it was going to hap
pen sometime. We just didn't
know where, and we didn't know
when. "It" was Mexican food,
the bane of Billi's existence.
Rusty, always partial to
Mexican fare, expressed no
similar chagrin, heaping her taco
"boat" with ground beef, beans,
lettuce, tomatoes and sour
cream. Praising the boat as
"revolutionary," she was never
theless bothered by the
"awkwardly shredded lettuce."
Billi resigned herself to
"making your own salad," but
was pleasantly surprised by the
choice of poppy seed dressing.
The fruit bowl was a surprise as
well, appearing to be a mixture of
apples and oranges, but in reality
consisting of jicama and oranges,
a combination foreign to this
reviewer's Midwestern palate.
Rusty went into rhapsodies
over dessert, a choice between
two flavors of Dreyer's ice
cream, warm Mexican chocolate
cake. Weight Watchers' frozen

orange bars or all of the above.
We limited ourselves to choco
late chocolate chip ice cream and
cake, which was notable for the
subtle hint of Mexico in its frost
ing.
Despite our preoccupation
with the food, one eye was al
ways open to Storey's ambiance
— which is open only to those

sightly form of an avocado green
refrigerator standing obtrusively
near the dining room's entrance.
Residents seemed pleased with
their cuisine, but there was one
complaint: "We don't have big
strawberries." Despite this grave
deficiency, we understand why
558 edged out Storey in last
year's Draw.
Day Two: Columbae
Feeling brave after a success
ful first review, we decided to go
out on a limb. Still relative
neophytes, we ventured into the
unknown territory of cooperative
living. (Actually, we cheated.
Two friends of ours were cooking
that evening.)
Approaching from the side
walk, we were greeted by an as
sortment of Columbians, er . . .
Columbaeans, feasting upon the
front steps or, actually, feasting
upon pasta while seated upon the
front steps. Rusty was concerned
about the possibility of food
"running out," but her fear was
allayed by the sight of a full wok,
easily two feet in diameter,
balanced on the dining room
table.
Rummaging in the kitchen for
dishes, Billi unearthed two pot
tery bowls, a plastic cup and an
avocado green mug. Rusty
searched the silverware drawer,
conveniently placed on the table,
discovering a pair of chopsticks
for herself and a spoon for her
companion.

The pasta was good. Honestly.
Prepared with 40 "handfuls" of
spinach noodles, it was cooked
with the proper vegetarian en
semble of fresh tomatoes, corn,
mushrooms and green beans. Op

tional seasoning was provided,
and Rusty liberally festooned her
bowl with garlic salt — from a
two-pound box.
Remembering the lesson of the
previous evening, Billi was quick

to get to the kitchen at the smell
of dessert wafting from the oven.
The honey-coconut bars were
more reminiscent of the former,
as was conceded by one of their
creators.
Rusty labelled the dining room
"comfortable," appreciating the
French doors, a spider plant
mural and a poster of Martin Lut
her King Jr. The atmosphere was
friendly, as evidenced by one
resident's concern that house
members catch a view of an im
pending sunset. Rules of the
Kitchen were limited to three: I)
Don't use meat; 2) Cook enough;
and 3) Don't burn down the
kitchen. Cooperative living at its
finest.
Day Three: Storey House
We knew it was going to hap
pen sometime. We just didn't
know where, and we didn't know
when. "It" was Mexican food,
the bane of Billi's existence.
Rusty, always partial to
Mexican fare, expressed no
similar chagrin, heaping her taco
"boat" with ground beef, beans,
lettuce, tomatoes and sour
cream. Praising the boat as
"revolutionary," she was never
theless bothered by the
"awkwardly shredded lettuce."
Billi resigned herself to
"making your own salad," but
was pleasantly surprised by the
choice of poppy seed dressing.
The fruit bowl was a surprise as
well, appearing to be a mixture of
apples and oranges, but in reality
consisting of jicama and oranges,
a combination foreign to this
reviewer's Midwestern palate.
Rusty went into rhapsodies
over dessert, a choice between
two flavors of Dreyer's ice
cream, warm Mexican chocolate
cake. Weight Watchers' frozen

orange bars or all of the above.
We limited ourselves to choco
late chocolate chip ice cream and
cake, which was notable for the
subtle hint of Mexico in its frost
ing.
Despite our preoccupation
with the food, one eye was al
ways open to Storey's ambiance
— which is open only to those
with draw numbers considerably
lower than most mortals'. The
pine tables and chairs allowed
comfortable seating for the whole
family, and the plastic tumblers
further gave the air of a gracious
home.
The walls, done in an original
Navajo white, were simply
graced by a Vandenberg print,
entitled "See Horse," portraying
a seahorse impaled on the tines
of a dinner fork. The fork theme
came back to haunt us when a
fork shortage was announced.
While we may have been
suspected of causing the crisis,
we refused to relinquish our
utensils.
At Storey we didn't find the
casual atmosphere characteristic
of other Row houses, but dinner
was appetizing all the same.
Even Billi left sated, in spite of
the (gasp!) Mexican meal.
Day Four: I.a Maison Francaise
It was to be a magical evening,
a brush with culture, a night of
transfiguration. We dreamed of
La Tour Eiffel, crepes and
Camembert. . . . Instead, we ex
perienced Chinese cuisine.
While Billi was somewhat put
out by the ethnic mix-up. Rusty
was enthralled by the beef stir
fry's subtle finger flavor. The
tender main course rested on a
bed of fluffy, white rice and was

accompanied by the typical salad
bar, a fruit melange and a second
choice of fruit salad.
One apparent reference to the
French theme was the presence
of authentic baguettes on each
long, wooden table.
The decor had what could only
be described as "character,"
consisting of six tables sturdy
enough to survive a Parisian
lycee, windows opening onto a
secluded patio, and the ever
present Navajo white walls.
Needless to say, we were
charmed.
Day Five: American Studies
House
Our task, by this time, had
begun to wear thin, and so had
our sense of humor. Unfortun
ately, our taste buds hadn't.
As one resident aptly de
scribed eating at American
Studies, "I had no idea that I was

the American and the studies
would be to determine just what I
was eating."
That evening's meal consisted
of pizza with a mosaic of top
pings: mushroom, pineapple,
bacon, onion, pepperoni, ham
and green pepper. Green pepper,
Billi's nemesis, was apparent in
every combination.
If you don't mind cold cereal
for dinner, AmStud dining is a
unique experience — as long as
you have something else to come
home to.
Day Six: Grove >
Day six found us at the end of
our rope, er . . . road, and stand
ing before us were the worn steps
and chipped pillars of 584
Mayfield Ave. All we wanted
was a meat and potatoes meal: no
surprises, no Vandenberg prints,
no chopsticks and no green pep
pers. We got it.
We feasted upon prime rib,
baked potatoes, French cut green
beans and homemade biscuits.
We "made our own sundaes" for
dessert. Thanksgiving never
tasted better.
We ate. We ate a lot. Begin
ning as wide-eyed innocents
weaned on Branner and Wilbur
Food Service, we became, in
short, culinary tramps.
"We" are Rusty and Billi, two
redheaded coeds endeavoring to
discover the gastronomic perils
and pleasures of "The Row."
Our choice of establishments was
randomly generated by the home
office in Gilroy. We do
apologize, however, for the
omission of a fraternal represen
tative. Sigma Chi social engage
ments appeared to preclude our
reservation.
Day One: 558 May field Ave.
We decided to start at the top.
Stepping apprehensively into the
elegant foyer of 558 May field, we
were enveloped by an aroma of
what we initially perceived to be
sweet and sour. There was, in
fact, nothing to support our as
sumption of Chinese fare. That
evening we dined on barbecued
chicken, Caesar salad, fresh
fruit, rice pilaf and steamed corn.
All the same, the meal was a
joy to the senses. Rusty felt the
barbecue sauce sang lightly upon
her tongue. However, a com
panion averred that she was, per
haps, tone deaf. Billi was partial
to the poultry's accompani
ments, lauding the abundance of
Caesar salad and the intricately
carved watermelon basket.
The crescendo of the entree al
most overshadowed our disap
pointment at of missing out on
the most important course of any
meal — dessert. We learned our
first lesson of Row dining that
night: Move it or lose it — espe
cially when it comes to home
made brownies. House residents

assured us the pastry treats were
divine, though Billi was some
what consoled by an Eskimo pie.
Rusty wasn't.
558 can only be compared to a
ski lodge in the Swiss Alps — or
so we understand, never having
sojourned in one. The only jar
ring note appeared in the un
sightly form of an avocado green
refrigerator standing obtrusively
near the dining room's entrance.
Residents seemed pleased with
their cuisine, but there was one
complaint: "We don't have big
strawberries." Despite this grave
deficiency, we understand why
558 edged out Storey in last
year's Draw.
