## SJSU shocks Cardinal 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
History does repeat itself.
After defeating four strong opponents in a row,
the Stanford men's soccer team fell to a relatively
weak squad yesterday. This kind of loss, however,
was nothing new to the Cardinal.
Unheralded San Jose State upset Stanford yes
terday at Maloney Field 2-0. The loss dropped the
Cardinal to 7-5-2 and gave the squad its first Pacific
Soccer Conference defeat of the year.
Even as champion of last weekend's
AT&T/Pacific West Soccer Classic, Stanford was
premature to predict a victory over the Spartans.
The Cardinal has had a tendency both this season
and in past years to defeat top teams (such as San
Francisco and UCLA) and bow to less formidable
opponents. Earlier in the season Stanford lost to
Sacramento State, and two seasons ago the squad
defeated USF and went on to lose to the Spartans.
Neither team performed well yesterday, but the
Cardinal in particular played below par. Stanford
showed none of the form it used in the victories
over Washington and UCLA last weekend.
The first half ended up as a race to see which
team could find its game plan first. San Jose State
won, but barely. The Cardinal finally began
working as a unit five minutes before halftime but
was unable to put any goals on the board. The first
period ended 0-0.
Stanford lost its cohesiveness as the second half
began. Not only was it unable to pass the ball

smoothly, hut its defense also fell apart. Nineteen
minutes into the period. Spartan forward Ingi In
gason was able to get past the Cardinal backfield
and scored the first goal of the game.
Halfway through the period, the Cardinal was
able to come together and challenge the Spartans.
In one five-minute period Stanford took six shots
on goal, but each attempt either hit the goal post or
was saved by SJSU goalie Jerry Nelson.
With eight minutes left in the game, Cardinal
midfielder Juan Garcia scored a goal, but it was
nullified when the referee called Stanford offside.
The Cardinal was not able to get another shot into
the net.
"Our defense put it together," SJSU Coach
Julius Menendez said. "The guys played a dis
ciplined game."
Jon Ragnarsson scored SJSU's second goal with
six minutes remaining in the match. Stanford
protested that Ragnarsson was offside when he
received the ball, but the goal stood.
"The refereeing was suspect," Stanford Coach
Sam Koch said. "Their second goal was offsides by
a mile."
The Cardinal, however, did not make excuses.
"We had no intensity," Koch said. "San Jose took
advantage of it, and we gave them the game."
"We played to their (low) level of competitive
ness," Stanford midfielder Mike Mossmersaid.
In addition to the questionable officiating contri
buting to the Cardinal's loss, Stanford players also
noted they were unprepared for the Spartans' style
of play.
