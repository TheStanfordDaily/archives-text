# Canadian Thorpe fits right in

Many athletes make up for a lack of
natural talent with an unyielding desire
to win. Rather than possessing either
one or the other trait, junior fullback
David Thorpe of the Stanford men's
soccer team is both talented and
motivated.
"He's one of our greatest players,"
defensive teammate Mark Semioli said.
"He has the best attitude of anyone on
the team, and he picks everyone up
whether it's a big game or a regular
one."
Thorpe, who hails from Sas
katchewan, Canada, came to Stanford
"mostly because of soccer." He
wanted to attend college where he
could practice year-round, since in his
home province he "can only play three
or four months out of the year."
Thorpe also considered Bay Area
archrival California, but he chose the
Cardinal because of Stanford Coach
Sam Koch. "It's great playing with him
because you can talk to him and hang
out with him outside of practice,'
Thorpe said of his coach.
Entering Stanford from Canada and
playing college soccer in the United
States prompted some adjustments in
Thorpe's soccer style.
During his first month at Stanford,
Thorpe made some changes in his game
plan. Canadians tend to play more zone
defense, whereas in the United States
man-to-man defense is emphasized.
Americans play a "faster game, with
a lot more running." he said. While this
usually makes the American version of
soccer more exciting, Thorpe said it

does not necessarily improve the
quality of play.
Having played on a few regional
select teams in high school that were
represented in the Canada Games,
Thorpe said those teams compare fa
vorably with NCAA teams, although
"there are not as many quality athletes
or as much depth."
Heading the ball is, in Thorpe's es
timation, his best skill. His vertical
leap, important for a defender, is well
over 30 inches and contributes greatly
to his mastery of heading. "I think his
vertical leap is better than anyone in
the country who plays socccer," Semi
oli said. "He's only 6-foot, but he plays
like someone who is 6-5 or 6-6."

"I think his (Thorpe's)
vertical leap is better than
anyone in the country who
plays soccer/

On corner kicks and throw-ins, his
teammates try to get the hall to him be
cause "there are only a few guys in the
league with the same heading ability,"
Thorpe said.
Indeed, his teammates often rely on
his ability to score goals on head balls.
"On set pieces, you definitely look for
him.' senior midfielder Pat Sheehy
said. That confidence has paid off
recently, with Thorpe scoring game
v. inning goals in two recent contests
against nationally ranked Fresno State
and Washington.
Those goals were probably the most

important goals of Thorpe's Cardinal
career, yet he speaks modestly about
them. "It's a strange feeling with
everyone around you jumping. It
doesn't hit you right away," Thorpe
said. "It does give you an extra burst
of energy toward the end of the game."
One person who is not surprised at
Thorpe's recent success is Koch. He
spoke of Thorpe's "incredible vertical
leap" and "tremendous physical
strengths."
Koch recalled a time when Thorpe
sprained his ankle in a game and still
outleaped his opponents using one foot
to get a header. Thorpe is "great to
coach," said Koch, because he is an
unselfish player who works hard to im
prove his skills.
Despite Thorpe's recent success,
Koch maintains that Thorpe has not
yet reached his full potential, because
in some games he "still tends to float
and lose his mark.
"I may be a little harder on him, be
cause 1 know how much better he can
be." Koch said.
After he leaves Stanford, Thorpe
would like to return to his native
Canada to try out for the World Cup or
Olympic soccer teams. He had a taste
of professional soccer last summer
when he practiced with the Edmonton
club in the Canadian Soccer League.
T his year's Cardinal, despite today's
loss to lowly San Jose State, looks like
it has a chance at the NCAA tourna
ment and a national ranking. After a
tough trip on the East Coast, the team
went 4-0 and gained national recogni
tion. Stanford can thank David Thorpe
for much of the comeback.
