# Biology building will be delayed
## Kennedy asks for environmental study 
### Erik Johnson 
Under intense pressure from local environmental
groups, University President Donald Kennedy an
nounced yesterday that Stanford will request an en
vironmental impact report (EIR) on the proposed
construction of a new $33 million biology building.
In a letter to the Santa Clara County Planning
Commission, Kennedy expressed "regret and re
luctance" at the decision and said he was confident
of the University's case. "The merit of our position
would be sustained through the appeals process,"
he wrote.
Kennedy acknowledged, however, that the delay
and cost of taking the case to court would
"adversely affect" the University's biological re
search programs. The delay caused by the prepara
tion of an EIR will cost between $750,000 and $1
million.

al it ion. the group that spearheaded the local protest
action, said he was both happy and relieved at the
decision. "Stanford finally saw the light," Smith
said.
"1 think they realized we were right," he added.
"This is the ultimate right-to-know issue. It takes a
technological arrogance to go ahead with this type
of project without some community oversight."
The building in question is an annex to the Herrin
Laboratories, near the Old Chemistry Building. Re
searchers plan to study recombinant DNA theory
in the new building.
It was this research that prompted the initial ac
tion by the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. Smith
claimed the University was withholding important
data about the possible health dangers the research
might produce.
Recombiant DNA research is defined under five
categories under federal regulations. Category five
is considered the most dangerous. The new build

ing, however, had been scheduled to host only
categories one and two, which require no special
laboratory equipment.
Noting that Stanford is one of the world leaders
in biological research. Smith said he believes the
University should adopt the policy now in effect in
Cambridge, Mass., where Harvard and MIT con
duct similar research.
Cambridge has passed an ordinance mandating
that any research institution within city limits be
monitored by a community oversight group. The
statute also establishes a medical monitoring sys
tem for workers and residents in the city.
The EIR will include an analysis on the potential
effect of the building on the surrounding air. and
water, and plant and animal life.
In addition, the EIR will include estimates on the
resulting changes in the environment for the human
population.
