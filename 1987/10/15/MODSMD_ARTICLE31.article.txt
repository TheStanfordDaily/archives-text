# Card salvages 3-2 victory
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
It was certainly too close.
Stanford's surging field hockey squad was
pushed to overtime yesterday by lowly Pacific
before emerging with a hard-earned 3-2 victory.
Junior Kat Thomas scored with a mere one min
ute remaining in the first overtime period to put
away the upstart visitors. Thomas pushed in the
rebound from a rocket of a shot by classmate Dana
Fleming. It was Thomas' second score of the game
and her fifth of the season.
"I never gained control of the ball, I just put it
in," Thomas said.
"Kat played an excellent game," Stanford
Coach Sheryl Johnson said. "Obviously that last
goal was especially important."
The win upped Stanford's overall record to 8-3
and kept the team undefeated in Northern Pacific
Conference play with a 5-0 mark. The 12th-ranked
Cardinal also recorded its fourth consecutive vic
tory with the triumph and has not lost since falling
to powerful Delaware Sept. 26.
After playing to a I-1 tie through the first half,
the Cardinal seemed ready to take control of the
game when sophomore Tracy Steiglitz punched in
an unassisted goal from short range 11:42 into the
second half.
Stanford's euphoria was short-lived, however, as
Pacific was able to knot the score just 34 seconds
later when senior Wisti Gaunce took a pass from
freshman Julia Waters and pushed the ball past lun
ging Stanford goalie Karen Jones.
"I don't know if Karen ever saw the ball,"
Johnson said. "There was a scramble in front of the
net, and things got messy. Ii wasn't a great shot,
but I don't think our goalie saw it until the very last
second."
Although play centered around the Tigers' goal
for most of the first half. Pacific drew proverbial
first blood when freshman Nita Bruner pounded a

marvelous shot past Jones 21 minutes into the ini
tial period of play. The goal developed off a flaw
lessly executed penalty corner play by the Tigers.
Stanford didn't even the count until 10 minutes
later when Thomas got her stick on a free shot by
junior Alison Smith and directed it toward the left
corner of the cage. It was Smith's second assist of
the year.
The final four minutes of the half passed without
incident, and the Cardinal had to be satisfied with a
I-1 score at the end of the first 35 minutes of play.
The second half brought more of the same. Stan
ford took 27 shots (Pacific had four) but was able to
convert only one into a goal. "At the end of the
first half we got flustered. We didn't want to tie,"
junior Missy Jolley said.
"When it gets close like that, we try too hard,"
Johnson said. "The underdog doesn't have any
thing to lose and can play a real loose, relaxed
game. As the favorite, we tend to press too much."
It looked as if the 10-minute overtime period
would simply be a microcosm of the rest of the
game. But finally, nine minutes, four penalty cor
ners and seven shots later, the Cardinal knocked
home the winning goal.
Stanford's reaction was, more than anything,
one of relief. "No, we didn't play well," Johnson
said, "but we won."
Pacific, which has finished second in the NorPac
for three consecutive years, is in the midst of what
Pacific Coach Carla Conant termed a "rebuilding
year." Indeed, the Tigers start six freshmen.
"We're very happy (with the effort)," Conant
said. "To be able to score our first conference
goals of the season against Karen Jones is very ex
citing. We were hungry to score."
Despite the sub-par performance by the Cardinal
as a whole, there were some solid individual perfor
mances. Thomas and Steiglitz, who accounted for
all of the Cardinal's scoring, both played "real
well," according to Johnson.

Stanford's surging field hockey squad was
pushed to overtime yesterday by lowly Pacific
before emerging with a hard-earned 3-2 victory.
Junior Kat Thomas scored with a mere one min
ute remaining in the first overtime period to put
away the upstart visitors. Thomas pushed in the
rebound from a rocket of a shot by classmate Dana
Fleming. It was Thomas' second score of the game
and her fifth of the season.
"I never gained control of the ball, I just put it
in," Thomas said.
"Kat played an excellent game," Stanford
Coach Sheryl Johnson said. "Obviously that last
goal was especially important."
The win upped Stanford's overall record to 8-3
and kept the team undefeated in Northern Pacific
Conference play with a 5-0 mark. The 12th-ranked
Cardinal also recorded its fourth consecutive vic
tory with the triumph and has not lost since falling
to powerful Delaware Sept. 26.
After playing to a I-1 tie through the first half,
the Cardinal seemed ready to take control of the
game when sophomore Tracy Steiglitz punched in
an unassisted goal from short range 11:42 into the
second half.
Stanford's euphoria was short-lived, however, as
Pacific was able to knot the score just 34 seconds
later when senior Wisti Gaunce took a pass from
freshman Julia Waters and pushed the ball past lun
ging Stanford goalie Karen Jones.
"I don't know if Karen ever saw the ball,"
Johnson said. "There was a scramble in front of the
net, and things got messy. Ii wasn't a great shot,
but I don't think our goalie saw it until the very last
second."
Although play centered around the Tigers' goal
for most of the first half. Pacific drew proverbial
first blood when freshman Nita Bruner pounded a

marvelous shot past Jones 21 minutes into the ini
tial period of play. The goal developed off a flaw
lessly executed penalty corner play by the Tigers.
Stanford didn't even the count until 10 minutes
later when Thomas got her stick on a free shot by
junior Alison Smith and directed it toward the left
corner of the cage. It was Smith's second assist of
the year.
The final four minutes of the half passed without
incident, and the Cardinal had to be satisfied with a
I-1 score at the end of the first 35 minutes of play.
The second half brought more of the same. Stan
ford took 27 shots (Pacific had four) but was able to
convert only one into a goal. "At the end of the
first half we got flustered. We didn't want to tie,"
junior Missy Jolley said.
"When it gets close like that, we try too hard,"
Johnson said. "The underdog doesn't have any
thing to lose and can play a real loose, relaxed
game. As the favorite, we tend to press too much."
It looked as if the 10-minute overtime period
would simply be a microcosm of the rest of the
game. But finally, nine minutes, four penalty cor
ners and seven shots later, the Cardinal knocked
home the winning goal.
Stanford's reaction was, more than anything,
one of relief. "No, we didn't play well," Johnson
said, "but we won."
Pacific, which has finished second in the NorPac
for three consecutive years, is in the midst of what
Pacific Coach Carla Conant termed a "rebuilding
year." Indeed, the Tigers start six freshmen.
"We're very happy (with the effort)," Conant
said. "To be able to score our first conference
goals of the season against Karen Jones is very ex
citing. We were hungry to score."
Despite the sub-par performance by the Cardinal
as a whole, there were some solid individual perfor
mances. Thomas and Steiglitz, who accounted for
all of the Cardinal's scoring, both played "real
well," according to Johnson.
