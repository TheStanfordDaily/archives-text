Just call them the miracle workers.
The Stanford women's soccer team rallied to pull
off a 3-2 win at San Francisco yesterday afternoon
to improve its record to 2-6-2.
Although it dominated throughout the game, the
Cardinal scored all of its goals in the last 25
minutes. Senior midfielder Amy Geisse kicked in
the game-winner with only four minutes showing
on the clock.
Coming into the game, the Cardinal was favored
to win. Thus far this season, the dignity of being
favorites in a contest has been foreign to the
players.
"We weren't the underdogs, so everyone wasn't
so nervous beforehand,'' sophomore fullback
Kelly McDevitt said.
In the first half, Stanford was frustrated and un
motivated. The Dons scored two quick goals,
deflating the Cardinal's morale.
"For 15 or 20 minutes in the first half, we lost our
concentration," freshman midfielder Jenny
Bloomer said. "We were also a little unlucky."
"We lost heart," freshman Darsi Rueda said.
"Passing was a problem, and we weren't trapping
well."
At halftime, Stanford Coach Berhane Andeber
han had his job cut out for him. Andeberhan tried a
different kind of speech to rekindle his squad.
"Berhane gave us a lot of technical advice,"

McDevitt said, "something he usually doesn't do.
He also gave us a pep talk."
Whatever Andeberhan conveyed to the team, it
worked. Fifteen minutes into the second half,
Bloomer scored her first goal of the season.
"Carolyn Denney clashed with a San Francisco
defender in front of the goal," Bloomer said. "The
ball squirted out, and I kicked it over the goalie's
hands."
Soon after the first strike, midfielder Jenny
Rowland knocked in her second score of the
season. Then, with Don supporters staring in dis
belief, Geisse volleyed in a shot off the crossbar.
"Being two goals up, San Francisco expected to
win," freshman Valerie Goetz said. "They let up
on defense."
Statistically, the Cardinal got off 30 shots to the
Dons' 10. It was just a matter of time before Stan
ford captitalized.
Stanford's defense was in high gear in the second
half in particular. Junior fullback Christy McDevitt
had her second stellar performance, marking up
with the top Don scoring threat.
In goal, sophomore Vija Brookshire played the
first half, and freshman Elise Edwards came in for
the second.
"Vija could not have stopped either of their
goals," Bloomer said.
Edwards is likely to start in the Cardinal's next
game, however.
Stanford returns home to play Portland at 3 p.m.
Friday and Chico State Sunday at 2 p.m. Both
games take place at Maloney Field.
