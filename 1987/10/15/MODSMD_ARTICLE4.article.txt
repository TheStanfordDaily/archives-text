# Asbestos levels low, University says
## 
### Alicia Kent Staff writer 
Although the University is still
refusing to release a report that
locates potentially dangerous as
bestos sites and reveals plans for
removal of the asbestos, Asst.
Provost John Hughes said the
amounts found in student
residences and classrooms are
negligible.
The report is part of an on
going physical survey conducted
every six months in order to keep
a close watch on the deteriora
tion of the asbestos and to set
priorities for its removal.
Hughes and Alain Decleve, di
rector of Health and Safety, esti
mated that at least 90 percent of
the buildings on campus contain
some form of asbestos — but

most is non-friable and of no dan
ger to students.
According to Hughes, all stu
dent residences except Sterling
Quad and the Moore houses on
the Row have asbestos in the
form of "lagging materials
around pipes and in mechanical
places."
The low-rise apartments in Es
condido are the only student
residences known to have as
bestos sprayed onto the ceilings.
Thirteen buildings are known
to have friable asbestos and are
under close monitoring, accord
ing to Hughes. They are:
Durand, Jordan Hall, Math Cor
ner, Building 170, Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, Herrin Hall
and Labs, Mitchell Earth
Sciences, the Graduate School of
Business, Skilling Auditorium.

Memorial Hall, Education, En
cina Hall and Green Library. All
are being surveyed periodically
and have undergone partial as
bestos removal.
"Now our intent is to survey
every building on campus,"
Hughes said. He estimated that
the campus-wide survey and as
bestos removal could cost "at
least $2 million."
Galson Technical Services, the
firm the University consulted for
asbestos study, was called in to
do "a room-by-room inventory
to determine the presence of as
bestos."
According to Chuck Siu of
Galson, "The bulk of the report
is a bunch of numbers about the
condition of the materials, the
number of people occupying the
space and the time of exposure."

The fibers of non-friable as
bestos are harmful only if the as
bestos is cut, sanded, broken,
drilled or otherwise damaged.
Friable asbestos, on the other
hand, is a potential health risk
because it crumbles easily under
pressure or contact and can
degenerate over time. All of the
friable asbestos in the dorms has
"been taken care of," according
to Hughes.
Hughes said that in a few
weeks an informational letter will
be distributed to provide dorm
residents with the correct facts
about asbestos hazards and
"what to be careful of."
In late August, construction
workers delayed work on the the
wiring system in the basement of
Lagunita Court because they
feared their work would damage
pipe insulation which contained
asbestos. If the pipe lagging were
damaged, it could release car
cinogenic fiber into the air.

After an air sample in the base
ment revealed .005 fibers per
cubic centimeter, the University
began abatement, the proscess of
isolation and removal. The abate
ment was completed Oct. 8.
Although the national recom
mendation for safety is 0.1 fibers
per cubic centimeter, the Univer
sity's policy is to remove any as
bestos above the level of .001.
"There are no standards, na

tional or state, for people in
dorms or offices. We've tried to
determine what we think would
be a prudent level," said
Hughes.
In March, 1985, Durand was
shut down for three months in or
der to remove sprayed-on
fireproofing containing asbestos
in the building's air supply
structure.

because it crumbles easily under
pressure or contact and can
degenerate over time. All of the
friable asbestos in the dorms has
"been taken care of," according
to Hughes.
Hughes said that in a few
weeks an informational letter will
be distributed to provide dorm
residents with the correct facts
about asbestos hazards and
"what to be careful of."
In late August, construction
workers delayed work on the the
wiring system in the basement of
Lagunita Court because they
feared their work would damage
pipe insulation which contained
asbestos. If the pipe lagging were
damaged, it could release car
cinogenic fiber into the air.

After an air sample in the base
ment revealed .005 fibers per
cubic centimeter, the University
began abatement, the proscess of
isolation and removal. The abate
ment was completed Oct. 8.
Although the national recom
mendation for safety is 0.1 fibers
per cubic centimeter, the Univer
sity's policy is to remove any as
bestos above the level of .001.
"There are no standards, na

tional or state, for people in
dorms or offices. We've tried to
determine what we think would
be a prudent level," said
Hughes.
In March, 1985, Durand was
shut down for three months in or
der to remove sprayed-on
fireproofing containing asbestos
in the building's air supply
structure.
