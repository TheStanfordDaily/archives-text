# Iran-contra insiders exchange views

### Sean Kinch 
Two prominent figures in the Iran-contra
affair described their experiences in the arms
for-hostages operation to a crowd of about
120 last night in Memorial Auditorium.
Dale Van Atta, the Washington Post
reporter and columnist who first broke the
story of the operation, said the scandal was
evidence of the Reagan administration's
"national hypocrisy."
Robert Owen, the Washington-to-
Nicaragua courier who worked under Lt.
Col. Oliver North, explained the intentions of
the operation in Nicaragua and said he
believes "that what we did was right."
The program was organized by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau and was moderated by
Larry Horton, University vice president for
Public Affairs.
Van Atta accused the Reagan administra
tion of a disinformation campaign to cover up
its dealings with Iran. In order to divert
media attention away from Iran, the adminis
tration spread propaganda condemning Libya

as "the world's greatest terrorist threat.'
Van Atta said.
Owen, who earned his bachelor's degree in
political science here in 1978. described his
first trips to Central America. He said the
visits convinced him that the Sandinistan
government would never become demo
cratic, its own promises to the contrary not
withstanding.
Owen described North as "a man who
cared about people." He said North's first
concern was in providing the people in
Nicaragua with enough food and medical
supplies.
Van Atta said that in February 1986 Presi
dent Reagan told him that printing the story
of the operation would endanger the lives of
the hostages, so he decided not to run it ini
tially.
"My definition of a threat to national secu
rity is something which might threaten the life
of an American," Van Atta said.
Van Atta said he changed his mind two
months later when he decided he could no
longer trust the administration.

"It is unforgivable that the United States
waged war on Libya after [Libya] bombed a
disco and killed two people," Van Atta said.
Furthermore, he said, it was unacceptable
that the United States agreed to sell arms to
Iran even though that country was responsi
ble for the deaths of 2M people during that
same time.
Owen said that even though he disagreed
with the operation in Iran, the initiative to aid
the contras was just. He conceded, however,
that the plan to accomplish that goal was not.
"The administration had the right idea to
change the government in Nicaragua away
from a communist regime . . . but they did it
the wrong way," Owen said.
He called communism "the greatest
tyranny in the world and said the Sandinis
tas are undoubtedly a communist regime.
After each speaker had given a 30-minute
presentation, the crowd was invited to ask
questions. Most of the questions were di
rected to Owen and concerned the United
States' role in Nicaragua.
