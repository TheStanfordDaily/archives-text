IBM researchers win Nobel prize
Two IBM scientists whose work last year touched off a world
wide race to develop high-temperature superconductors, were
awarded the Nohel Prize in Physics yesterday.
J. Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Mueller, of IBM's Zurich Re
search Laboratory, won the prize barely a year after discovering
superconductivity in a new class of ceramics at temperatures
higher than had previously been considered possible.
The Royal Swedish Academy, which selects the winners, also
awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry yesterday, citing two
Americans and a Frenchman for determining how to make
relatively simple molecules that mimic the functions of far more
complex molecules produced by living cells.
In awarding the physics prize, the academy said the work of
Bednorz, 37, and Mueller, 60, served as "the introduction to an
explosive development in science" that set off an "avalanche"
of advances in producing better superconductors at higher tem
peratures. Eventually, researchers hope that room-temperature
superconductors will be found.
Superconductors can carry energy without the wasteful resis
tance found in normal conductors. Finding a practical supercon
ductor could revolutionize most uses of electricity and save bil
lions of dollars in energy costs by permitting electricity to flow
freely without the losses that are unavoidable in conventional
wires.
Mueller was in Naples yesterday for a scientific meeting. As
soon as he heard the news, he and his wife threw their clothes in
a bag and raced to the airport to return to Zurich. Bednorz
began the day as he normally does, conducting an experiment in
their lab.
Reagan damns Bork/s opponents
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, charging in a televised
address that the confirmation process of Supreme Court
nominee Judge Robert Bork became "an ugly spectacle . . . cas
ting aside normal rules of decency and honesty," yesterday
urged Americans to protest to their senators to preserve an inde
pendent judiciary.
Reagan unleashed some of his most stinging condemnations
yet of Bork's opponents in his address, which followed weeks of
pleas from Bork supporters that he speak on television to cham
pion the nominee. But the long-expected call-to-arms came only
after the nomination appears doomed and was further marred by
the refusal of the three major television networks to broadcast it
live.
In a desk-pounding response for the Democrats, Sen. Terry
Sanford of North Carolina declared that it was "slanderous" to
suggest that the Republican senators who also opposed Bork
"have been swayed by anything but conscientious intellect"
and added that senators "are tired of having our integrity im
pugned . . . our intelligence insulted."
The speeches of both Reagan and Sanford were broadcast by
Cable News Network. The sharp exchange, despite Bork's call
for a lower volume in the debate, appeared to foreshadow a
prolonged, high-decibel battle over filling the Supreme Court
vacancy.
Bush takes a walk on supply side
ATLANTA — Midway through his presidential campaign an
nouncement swing. George Bush suddenly called yesterday for
a big tax cut for wealthy investors, saying it would fuel greater
economic growth in the country.
The vice president, speaking before Atlanta businessmen,
proposed a reduction in the capital gains tax from a maximum of
28 percent today to 15 percent. Bush insisted this tax reduction
would not add to the estimated $175 billion 1988 federal budget
deficit.
"Such an incentive would not cost the government money. It
would gain additional revenue by stimulating growth," he said.
This supply-side theory, in which less tax means more growth
and more tax revenue, was denounced in general terms by Bush
in his first presidential campaign seven years ago as "voodoo
economics." Economists remain mixed about the effects of al
tering the tax on investment earnings or capital gains. It was
lowered in 1978, then increased again by the landmark 1986 tax
reform bill from a previous maximum of 20 percent to 28 percent
this year and 33 percent next year. A majority of economic
theorists, however, believe a major reduction would add to the
deficit.
Bush has said his week-long, seven-state announcment tour
was designed to bring his own ideas out from underneath the
shadow of the Reagan presidency he has served for two terms.
Hammer: Afghan king may return
MOSCOW — Los Angeles industrialist Armand Hammer, in
the middle of what he describes as a one-man shuttle mission to
end the war in Afghanistan, said here yesterday that he thinks a
settlement based on bringing back the Afghan king can be com
pleted at the Soviet-American summit likely to be held later this
year.
Hammer said that Afghanistan's Communist president, who
uses the single name of Najibullah, told him during a meeting in
Kabul on Tuesday that he was willing to share power with the
king and with rebel groups who have been fighting a series of
Soviet-backed Afghan governments since 1978.
Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan amidst worsening turmoil
there in December. 1979, installing Babrak Karmal as the
country's strongman. But what was reportedly envisioned as a
quick military operation has dragged on for eight years, tying
down about 115.000 Soviet troops. Looking for a way out, the
Soviets arranged Karmal's replacement with Najibullah in May,
1986.
South Africa will keep clamps on
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — South Africa's minister for
law and order, Adriaan Vlok, says that while the 16-month-long
state of emergency has succeeded in cooling the country's
revolutionary climate, it will have to remain in force for the
foreseeable future.
Vlok said that before seriously considering lifting the emer
gency, the government will have to finish addressing the black
majority's demands for upgrading their living conditions and
make significant progress in power-sharing negotiations.
"We would like to lift the emergency, but it would be ir
responsible if we don't once again have stable communities and
if we don't accomplish our three main goals," Vlok said in an in
terview this week with Katharine Graham, chairman of the
board of The Washington Post Co.
Those goals, Vlok said, are: imposing security-police actions
to bring short-term stability to black townships; upgrading living
conditions for blacks; and finding a political solution that will
give South Africa's 23 million blacks a role in governing the
country.
He acknowledged that achieving these goals would take time,
although he offered no timetable.
