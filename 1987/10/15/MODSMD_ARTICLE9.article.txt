# Market takes record plunge

### 
NEW YORK — A new dose of bad news
about the U.S. trade deficit helped send a
panicky stock market into full retreat yester
day and dropped the Dow Jones industrial
average 95.46 points, its largest one-day point
decline.
The fall, which outstripped last week's
record 91.55-point decline, brought the key
indicator to 2412.70, down 309.72 points
since its Aug. 25 peak. "Disaster may not be
too strong a word," said Gene Jay Seagle,
chief market analyst at Gruntal & Co., after
watching the day's ever-deepening decline.
The close of trading marked the first time
since early 1984 that the Dow has receded 10
percent from its all-time peak. The 11.4 per
cent decline since August seemed to lend
fresh support to prognostications that the
market is due for a setback after the bull mar
ket's five-year rampage.
Analysts were quick to note that the
decline was nowhere near the severity of the

daily percentage declines recorded during the
1929 crash. Yesterday's slide represented a
loss of 3.8 percent in the Dow's value,
compared to the record 12.8 percent loss re
corded Oct. 28, 1929.
Many on Wall Street have argued that the
long buying trend has driven stock prices to
levels that are out of line with corporate earn
ings. The Dow has gained nearly 250 percent
since the beginning of the bull market in Au
gust, 1982, when the index stood at 776.92.
The recent rises in interest rates and the
weakness of the dollar have added to inves
tors' worries.
Still, a large group of market professionals
assert that the decline may be only tempo
rary. They point to predictions of continued
strong corporate earnings and contend that
the huge cash pools in mutual funds and the
continuing flow of money from foreign inves
tors will keep the market alive.
Last week's record decline came on a day

when trading was relatively light, a fact that
encouraged analysts. But yesterday's New
York Stock Exchange volume reached 207.35
million shares, compared to 175.60 million
during the Oct. 6 session and 172.87 million in
Tuesday's trading.
"As the day got going, it brought out
everybody's worst Tears," said Eugene
Peroni, director of technical market analysis
at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
"The psychology of the market has been very
brittle."
On Sept. 22 the market set an all-time
record for a one-day gain, advancing 75.23
points amid hope that interest rates would
stabilize.
Peroni, who has predicted a retreat
in the market for some time, said analysts in
his office are now watching only about 30
stocks that they consider promising, down
from hundreds during the peak of the bull
market.
