TRAIN WITH THE
NUCLEAR INDUSTRY'S LEADER,
AND YOU COULD END UP
LEADING THE INDUSTRY.
"* * »•*"
Ka^s!nPß
Over half the nuclear reactors in America are
operated by one organization. The United States Navy.
The technology is the most advanced in the world.
The men in charge are the industry's best. That's why
the Navy Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate Program
is among the most sophisticated training available.
It has to be!
College juniors and seniors who qualify for the
program can earn $1,000 a month while still in school.
In addition, you get a $4,000 bonus upon entrance into
the program and an additional $2,000 when you
complete your Naval studies.
And, as an officer in today's Nuclear Navy, you
receive a year of paid graduate level training — graining
the experience and credentials that can put you at the
forefront of the nuclear industry.
You must be a U.S. citizen, 25 years of age or
younger upon commissioning, working toward a
bachelor's or master's degree. You must also have
completed a minimum of one year each of calculus
based physics with a "B" average or better.
If you're thinking about a career in the nuclear field,
start at the top. And lead the adventure as a Navy officer.
You can apply after your sophomore year. Call Navy
Management Programs for more information.
Sign up for Interviews at
the Career Placement Center
scheduled for October 19th
OFFICER.
LEAD THE ADVENTURE.
