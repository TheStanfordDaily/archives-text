# Panel sets stadium policy

### Elizabeth Howton 
The Student Alcohol Task Force yesterday
decided on new tactics to control alcohol abuse
at Stanford Stadium, including designating stu
dent monitors to patrol the student section and
limiting the amount of beer that each spectator
can bring into the stadium to one six-pack.
According to task force member Anthony
Mosse, spectators over age 21 may bring only
one six-pack of beer into the stadium. Previously
the limit was one case per person. In addition,
no one may leave the stadium and return with
more alcohol.
In one of two meetings last night, the task
force decided to send two kinds of student
monitors into the stadium. The first group will
wear special T-shirts and will roam the student
section, reminding students of the alcohol
guidelines.
Senate Chair and task force member David
Smolen said the monitors were an attempt to
"do something identifiable" about the alcohol
problem.
The monitors probably will be members of a
sports team and will receive money from the
Athletic Department for patrolling.

The other student monitors will be student
representatives from each dorm and fraternity.
These representatives will be responsible for the
conduct of their respective groups.
At the second meeting, task force members
decided to send flyers, newspaper ads and let
ters to residence assistants to inform students of
the regulations.
The flyers will emphasize that underage
drinkers may be cited by the police and that if
there is not a significant improvement in behav
ior in the stands, spectators could lose the
privilege of drinking alcohol in the stadium al
together.
Vinny Frost, president of the Interfraternity
Council, said he felt the combination of the alco
hol limit and designating fraternity presidents as
monitors would bring the problems caused by
fraternities under control. "The IFC will take
action against those who don't behave" he said,
adding that the IFC had not yet decided what
type of action it would take.
Also present at the meetings were members of
the Council of Presidents, the Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation,
the Intersorority Council and the Graduate Stu
dent Organization.
