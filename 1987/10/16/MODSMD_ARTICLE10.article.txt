WASHINGTON — Secre

announced yesterday that he
would resign his Cabinet post
to become chairman of Repub
lican Sen. Bob Dole's presi
dential campaign — a develop
ment Dole called "a home run
with the bases loaded."
Brock said at a Department
of Labor news conference that
in making the move, which
becomes effective Nov. 1, he
would "embark on a new mis
sion, a mission that 1 believe is
critical to the future of this na
tion, the election of the next
president of the United
States."
The 56-year-old Brock, a
former GOP national chairman
who has led the Department of
Labor since April 1985, called
Dole "a conservative public
servant with a demonstrated
compassion" and said the can

seek backing from organized
labor.

Cabinet member to resign to
work in the Dole campaign,

wife, Elizabeth, who quit her
post as transportation secre

to bolster Dole's effort in the
South. Elizabeth Dole is a
native of North Carolina, and

Administration officials said
consideration of possible suc
cessors for Brock was only in
the preliminary stages. Brock
said he was unaware of
"anything like a short list."
After making his announce
ment, Brock appeared with
Dole on Capitol Hill and then
gave a pep talk to supporters
at Dole's campaign head
quarters.
Dole, the Senate minority
leader, will formally announce
his candidacy Nov. 9.
Observers opined that with
the appointment of Brock to
run his campaign. Dole has
taken another stride toward
clearing two of the three
hurdles in his effort to firmly
establish himself as the chal
lenger to Vice President Bush.
