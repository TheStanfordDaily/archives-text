# CEO urges change
## 
### Brian Rhoads Staff writer 
The U.S. economy will need a boost
in service sector productivity in order to
maintain current economic growth, the
chairman and chief executive officer of
Citicorp said here yesterday.
John Reed, who has headed Citicorp
since 19K4, challenged a lunchtime
crowd in a packed Bishop Auditorium
to develop a new business language to
cope with changing economic times.
According to Reed, the shift in the
U.S. economy from manufacturing
goods to providing services is a sign that
business practices must also change.
Because 70 percent of the U.S. eco
nomy is based on providing services
such as medicine, banking and
software. Reed said, "the ability of the
service sector to become more produc
tive over the next 20 years is going to be

the determinant factor in the degree to
which our economy and our life can ex
pect to continue to grow as it has in the
past."
The ability of the business sector to
force change in service productivity will
depend on the ability of the next genera
tion of businessmen "to come up with
the language and the mechanics and the
approaches to produce these gains,"
Reed said.
He also warned that businesses today
will soon find it harder to turn a profit
because interest rates are not declining
as fast as they once did. "We're living
in a world that offers less opportunity to
make money than the last five years."
Reed said he has kept Citicorp away
from competition with regional banks
by limiting his corporation s role in
small bank loans. Citibank deals only
with larger global business loans and
with the opposite extreme — retail busi
ness, such as individual credit accounts.
