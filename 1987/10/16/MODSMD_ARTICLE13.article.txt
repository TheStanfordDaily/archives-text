# New service drives for drunks

Thanks to a new service that began
Wednesday night, Stanford students
not fit to drive home safely from a
party can now get a safe ride from a fel
low student.
The Safe Transportation Program, or
"STOP," is a volunteer program that
provides drunk students with an alter
native to driving home their own cars.
"I hear all the time people say
Dude, I wouldn't let myself drive if I
was drunk," and I know the guy's had
nine beers," said junior Glen Rosen
baum, a STOP volunteer. "I just don't
want that guy to drive."
The program operates from 10 p.m.
to 2 a.m., Wednesday through Satur
day night. Intoxicated students can call
a STOP volunteer, who will then pick
up and drive home the potential drunk
driver.
Rosenbaum said he and junior
Andrew Lawson have enlisted volun
teers from several fraternities and all of
the campus sororities.
"We have plenty of people to fill the
shifts," Rosenbaum said. "The
response has just been amazing. "

Senior Charlie Ahern, who started
STOP last spring, is helping to promote
the program. Ahern said the reaction to
the program this year has been favor
able.
"We are getting a lot of good feed
back from the campus," Ahern said.
"Everyone knows there is a problem,
and they want to do something about
it."
Rosenbaum also said the program
has received help from five community
sponsors. These sponsors are provid
ing business cards, promotional fliers
and food for the drivers, Rosenbaum
said.
According to Rosenbaum, there will
always be three volounteers â€” a dis
patcher and two drivers on duty. When
a STOP volunteer receives a call, he or
she asks the name of the caller and how
many people are in the caller's group,
he said.
Rosenbaum explained that even
though the program is designed solely
to serve Stanford students, STOP
workers only ask the caller to give his
or her student identification number if
he or she is calling from a great dis
tance.

Ahern said that considering the pro
gram's limited advertising, STOP was
successful last year. The program pro
vided rides for 126 students during
spring quarter, said Ahern, who added
that he got the idea for the program
after his sister had been in a car acci
dent.
According to Ahern, the program
received "about $6000"' from the
ASSU fee assessment last year. That
money will be used to inform students
about the service, he said.
"The big thing we're concentrating
on this year is advertising," Rosen
baum said. "We want everyone to
know about the service."
Rosenbaum, a member of Sigma Al
pha Epsilon fraternity, said the pro
gram is "pretty much a Greek thing,''
but that STOP would welcome any stu
dent volunteers.
Rosenbaum added that he hoped the
program would be used by all students,
"not just those in the Greek system."
He said that most fraternities already
have a pick-up policy for members who
need rides.
