# Free zone would exclude Stanford

### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
An upcoming Palo Alto ballot initia
tive that would make the city a nuclear
free zone will probably have no direct
impact on Stanford even if area voters
approve it Nov. 3, according to Judi
Levine, one of the initiative's organi
zers.
The University, which receives mil
lions of dollars in Defense Department
contracts, is a separate municipality,
Levine said.
Although Stanford would remain un
affected by the Palo Alto ordinance,
members of Stanford Action for Nu
clear Disarmament (STAND) said they
are beginning research that they hope
will lead to a similar nuclear-free zone
campaign on campus.

The Palo Alto ordinance would
prohibit work within city limits related
to the production of nuclear weapons
and would force city residents and
businesses to minimize all contracts
and investments with anyone
knowingly involved in any form of nu
clear weapons production. The mea
sure, if approved, would be imple
mented by a seven member commis
sion appointed by the Palo Alto City
Council.
According to STAND spokesperson
Diane Honigberg, most of Stanford's
defense work is in the area of basic re
search, a category that would be
allowed under the Palo Alto ordinance.
Honigberg said, however, that there
are many businesses operating on Stan
ford land that would be subject to a
University measure establishing a

nuclear-free zone.
"Most of the professors' work is
basic research, but the nuclear weap
ons work on University land is quite
extensive," Honigberg said. She added
that Hewlett-Packard is one business
working on Stanford property cur
rently involved in nuclear weapons re
search.
Outlining STAND'S plans for this
quarter, Honigberg said STAND will
spend this quarter compiling informa
tion on what specific Defense Depart
ment contracts are being completed on
campus. Beginning winter quarter, the
group hopes to promote the idea of a
nuclear-free campus through petitions
and demonstrations.
Currently, 134 cities in the United
States have declared themselves
nuclear-free zones.
