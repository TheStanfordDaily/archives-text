### 
When on-campus residents at UC-Berkeley
entered their dorm rooms this fall, they were met
by a welcome surprise — telephone lines in the
rooms were already connected.
This means that Cal residents knew their
respective telephone numbers the moment they
walked into their new homes and could make on
campus and local phone calls right away. In or
der to sign up for long-distance service, the stu
dents only had to contact the university's tele
communications office for an authorization
code.
At UCLA and USC telephone numbers are
automatically assigned to dorm rooms and
remain the same from year to year. As at Cal,
students at UCLA and USC know their tele
phone numbers at the start of the school year.
Here at Stanford, on the other hand, students
living in University housing must undergo frus
tration and confusion during the first couple of
weeks of the school year because no one has a
working telephone line — much less a phone

number. For most students the first two weeks
of school are a time for planning classes and ac
tivities, not to mention a time to catch up with
old friends. Needless to say, telephone numbers
are crucial to all this organization.
Stanford should be able to provide better tele
phone service for its students. Knowing phone
numbers in advance would speed up the produc
tion of the student directory. Instead of putting
out an incomplete and hopelessly delayed direc
tory sometime in late November or early De
cember, the University might actually be able to
put one together within the first month of
classes.
Also, automatic designation of phone numbers
would enable freshmen to give numbers to their
Earents and friends in August when they receive
ousing assignments.
If Stanford is committed to raising the quality
of residential life, one step the University can
take right away is to improve on-campus tele
phone service.
