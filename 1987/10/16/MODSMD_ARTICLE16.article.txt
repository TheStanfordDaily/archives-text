Minorities not
always diverse
In a recent Daily article,
graduate student David Porter
and undergraduate Jerilyn Lopez
Mendoza were quoted as saying
they intend to use the newly
formed Committee on Minority
Affairs (of which they are mem
bers) as a vehicle to pursue an in
crease in minority admissions to
Stanford (Daily, Oct. 13).
Was this the intended purpose
of the panel? The same article
states that the committee was es
tablished to "explore and seek
improvements in the condition of
minority life here." Where is
there mention of recruiting and
admissions policy? It seems that
the group is going beyond the
supposed parameters of its pur
pose.
I assume the reason the com
mittee members feel it is "fair"
to call for increased minority
recruitment is that 1) it would
further diversify the Stanford
community, and 2) it would
"compensate" for the economic
and attitudinal barriers in place
that make minority admissions
relatively more difficult.
However, other policies could
more equitably realize these
goals. Indeed, targeting admis--
sion could have a detrimental ef
fect on the Stanford student
body.
On both issues of "diversity"
and "fairness" I question why
the two members' comments had
to focus on minorities. If the goal
is to have a student population
with a broad range of back
grounds, this is definitely a cir
cuitous way of getting there. In
stead of automatically equating
minorities with diversity, we
should instead look at clearer as
sociations.
For example, should not inner
city students, regardless of race,

be targeted? Recruitment of
white inner city students of lower
socio-economic backgrounds to
attain admissions fairness and
population diversity would make
just as much sense as recruiting
minorities. From the fairness
perspective, do not inner city
whites have similar economic,
educational and social barriers
hindering them?
And from Stanford's perspec
tive, would these white students
diversify Stanford any less than
minority students? Indeed, the
committee's plan would likely
result in an increase of minority
students who grew up in the sub
urbs. This would be relatively far
less diversifying for Stanford
than targeting inner city stu
dents.
One must also remember that
targeting admissions (by defini
tion) gives unfair advantage to
some. This would preclude
basing acceptance strictly on
meritorious grounds and unfairly
penalize those students who are
not minorities. This is quid pro
quo reverse discrimination.
Of course many of the faults of
targeting admissions would likely
be amplified by the members of
the committee. The committee
gives unfair weight to Asian-
American, Native American,
Chicano-Latino, and black
minority organizations, each of
whom was allowed to internally
select its own panel representa
tive. Besides not representing
other racial minorities, this spe
cial representation creates an im
plicit definition of minorities that
excludes religious minorities (do
the Baha'is feel discriminated
against after the recent article in
The Daily?). While Porter's in
tentions seem to be good, the
result would only be a lessening
of the caliber of the Stanford stu
dent with only a minimal tradeoff
in increased diversity.
