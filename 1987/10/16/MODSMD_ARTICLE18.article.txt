# Protect democracy, not capitalism

1 cannot agree with those who think it is
not the business of the United States to stop
oppression where we can. Oppressors, when
confronted, will always charge that we are
meddling in their internal affairs. The same
self-righteous fury can be seen in the face of
any wife beater or child beater whose pre
rogative is intruded upon. A marine rifle butt
can be exactly what is called for.

I would not stand by while an act of thug
gery was perpetrated across the street. Nei
ther would it matter whether the street were a
border. Neither would 1 hesitate to call others
and act collectively in carrying out a neces
sary police action. The only question is how
to discern a necessary police action.
Unfortunately, with a few noble excep
tions. the United States has been more prone
to oppress than to Fight oppression. The U.S.
invasion of Grenada was the first instance in
the history of U.S. relations with the Third
World that the United States toppled a dicta
torship in favor of democracy. Every other
U.S. intervention was to topple a democracy
or a popular government in favor of a
"friendly" dictatorship. Guatemala, Chile
and Iran were model CIA "successes."
But the fact that we have done wrong in the
past does not mean that we should do nothing
now. Two wrongs do not make a right. The
implication for the present of having done
wrong in the past is that we have no
credibility. We must credit the skepticism of
those who regard our demands for pluralism
as a Trojan horse for another U.S.-sponsored
dictatorship. With that constraint in mind, we
can formulate the correct principles for in
terceding in the affairs of other nations.
First, we must get straight that our concern
is for democracy, not property rights. The
three aforementioned CIA "successes" sub
verted democracy in an attempt to protect
capitalism, in particular to protect private
U.S. economic interests. Never did these
economic interests begin to compare with the

national interests (including other economic
interests) that were damaged by the subver
sion of popular governments.
President Reagan still thinks that
capitalism, not democracy, is what America
stands for. The basis of Reagan's foreign
policy — Jeane Kirkpatrick's distinction be
tween "authoritarian" and "totalitarian"
regimes — is simply a plea to fight socialist
dictatorships while being friendly to capitalist
dictatorships.
Reagan thinks that communism and
socialism are the same thing: He actually
thought the French had thrown away their
democracy when they elected Francois Mit
terand as president in 1981. But better men
than he have made the same mistake. The
blame goes back to Marx himself.
Karl Marx was a great hater. The injustices
he saw were unmitigated by democracy, so
he hated democracy. Marx marred his own
work by placing it in the service of dictator
ship. Following Marx's lead, anti-democratic
Marxists have been able to equate capitalism
with democracy for a century. If there is any
thing to despise Marx for, it is that.
A Ronald Reagan plays into the hands of
the anti-democratic leftists. They charge that
representative government in a capitalist so
ciety represents only the accumulations of
economic power.
Nicaragua is a good case study for formu
lating proper foreign policy. Leninist Mar
xism is nothing but the science of monopoliz
ing power, along with a supporting ideology.
Powerful elements of the Sandinista leader
ship — Thomas Borge and his ilk — are com
mitted Marxist-Leninists.
There are good sides to the Sandinistas,
too. They are concerned with the plight of
Nicaragua's poor, which is most
Nicaraguans. Political imprisonment and
torture are miniscule compared to, say,
Chile. The Sandinistas do not have to be
removed; we just have to foil them in their at
tempts to monopolize power. You wouldn't
stand by while a neighbor hog-tied his
brother. As a nation we should not stand by
while any dictatorship consolidates its
power, unless there is nothing we can do. In
Nicaragua there is plenty we can do, if we
have our priorities straight.
We should say to the Sandinistas, "You
can hate capitalism all you want. You can na
tionalize every piece of chattel in the
country. But you must allow freedom of

speech and free political activity, and you
must win an honest election every 'x' years
or relinquish power to whoever does. Abide
by these conditions and we will offer you
every economic carrot. Violate them and we
will hit you with every economic stick. Par
ticipate in any aggression and we will crack
you like a nut."
The pressures applied would be primarily
economic. In principle we need not shy away
from using military force to remove anti
democratic governments where we are able.
In practice, military solutions will rarely be
desirable, especially with our history of fight
ing for capitalism rather than for democracy.
Economic pressure, conditioned solely on
whether or not a government is willing to sub
mit to the will of its people, would clarify our
position and establish our credibility. Ideally,
we would publish our short list of demands
and a single set of economic carrots and
sticks that would apply to every nation on
earth, from Chile to the Soviet Union to our
democratic allies (One might also make a
case for exempting traditional monarchies,
but not, I think, if they are despotic, and not
if their people clamor for democracy).
Dictatorships that make pretensions to
being popular governments, like the Sandi
nistas, would find themselves on the hot seat.
The Nicaraguan people would not long be
happy paying a heavy economic price for
their leaders' unwillingness to submit to
popular approval.
Military intervention, on the other hand,
only muddies the waters. It polarizes the situ
ation and lumps the democrats with the
capitalists, enabling the anti-democrats to
claim they are fighting imperialism. For
decades the CIA has intentionally muddied
the waters, toppling elected Marxists in order
to maintain the myth that electing a Marxist
means throwing away the democracy. It must
be made clear that the CIA s crimes against
democracy are the gravest of crimes, never to
be repeated.
Reagan has called for "full democracy" in
Nicaragua, as a ruse (so far) for derailing the
new Central American peace process. Let us
hear him call for it in earnest. Let us hear him
welcome the Sandinistas if they are willing to
become the founding party of an open
democracy.

1 cannot agree with those who think it is
not the business of the United States to stop
oppression where we can. Oppressors, when
confronted, will always charge that we are
meddling in their internal affairs. The same
self-righteous fury can be seen in the face of
any wife beater or child beater whose pre
rogative is intruded upon. A marine rifle butt
can be exactly what is called for.

I would not stand by while an act of thug
gery was perpetrated across the street. Nei
ther would it matter whether the street were a
border. Neither would 1 hesitate to call others
and act collectively in carrying out a neces
sary police action. The only question is how
to discern a necessary police action.
Unfortunately, with a few noble excep
tions. the United States has been more prone
to oppress than to Fight oppression. The U.S.
invasion of Grenada was the first instance in
the history of U.S. relations with the Third
World that the United States toppled a dicta
torship in favor of democracy. Every other
U.S. intervention was to topple a democracy
or a popular government in favor of a
"friendly" dictatorship. Guatemala, Chile
and Iran were model CIA "successes."
But the fact that we have done wrong in the
past does not mean that we should do nothing
now. Two wrongs do not make a right. The
implication for the present of having done
wrong in the past is that we have no
credibility. We must credit the skepticism of
those who regard our demands for pluralism
as a Trojan horse for another U.S.-sponsored
dictatorship. With that constraint in mind, we
can formulate the correct principles for in
terceding in the affairs of other nations.
First, we must get straight that our concern
is for democracy, not property rights. The
three aforementioned CIA "successes" sub
verted democracy in an attempt to protect
capitalism, in particular to protect private
U.S. economic interests. Never did these
economic interests begin to compare with the

national interests (including other economic
interests) that were damaged by the subver
sion of popular governments.
President Reagan still thinks that
capitalism, not democracy, is what America
stands for. The basis of Reagan's foreign
policy — Jeane Kirkpatrick's distinction be
tween "authoritarian" and "totalitarian"
regimes — is simply a plea to fight socialist
dictatorships while being friendly to capitalist
dictatorships.
Reagan thinks that communism and
socialism are the same thing: He actually
thought the French had thrown away their
democracy when they elected Francois Mit
terand as president in 1981. But better men
than he have made the same mistake. The
blame goes back to Marx himself.
Karl Marx was a great hater. The injustices
he saw were unmitigated by democracy, so
he hated democracy. Marx marred his own
work by placing it in the service of dictator
ship. Following Marx's lead, anti-democratic
Marxists have been able to equate capitalism
with democracy for a century. If there is any
thing to despise Marx for, it is that.
A Ronald Reagan plays into the hands of
the anti-democratic leftists. They charge that
representative government in a capitalist so
ciety represents only the accumulations of
economic power.
Nicaragua is a good case study for formu
lating proper foreign policy. Leninist Mar
xism is nothing but the science of monopoliz
ing power, along with a supporting ideology.
Powerful elements of the Sandinista leader
ship — Thomas Borge and his ilk — are com
mitted Marxist-Leninists.
There are good sides to the Sandinistas,
too. They are concerned with the plight of
Nicaragua's poor, which is most
Nicaraguans. Political imprisonment and
torture are miniscule compared to, say,
Chile. The Sandinistas do not have to be
removed; we just have to foil them in their at
tempts to monopolize power. You wouldn't
stand by while a neighbor hog-tied his
brother. As a nation we should not stand by
while any dictatorship consolidates its
power, unless there is nothing we can do. In
Nicaragua there is plenty we can do, if we
have our priorities straight.
We should say to the Sandinistas, "You
can hate capitalism all you want. You can na
tionalize every piece of chattel in the
country. But you must allow freedom of

speech and free political activity, and you
must win an honest election every 'x' years
or relinquish power to whoever does. Abide
by these conditions and we will offer you
every economic carrot. Violate them and we
will hit you with every economic stick. Par
ticipate in any aggression and we will crack
you like a nut."
The pressures applied would be primarily
economic. In principle we need not shy away
from using military force to remove anti
democratic governments where we are able.
In practice, military solutions will rarely be
desirable, especially with our history of fight
ing for capitalism rather than for democracy.
Economic pressure, conditioned solely on
whether or not a government is willing to sub
mit to the will of its people, would clarify our
position and establish our credibility. Ideally,
we would publish our short list of demands
and a single set of economic carrots and
sticks that would apply to every nation on
earth, from Chile to the Soviet Union to our
democratic allies (One might also make a
case for exempting traditional monarchies,
but not, I think, if they are despotic, and not
if their people clamor for democracy).
Dictatorships that make pretensions to
being popular governments, like the Sandi
nistas, would find themselves on the hot seat.
The Nicaraguan people would not long be
happy paying a heavy economic price for
their leaders' unwillingness to submit to
popular approval.
Military intervention, on the other hand,
only muddies the waters. It polarizes the situ
ation and lumps the democrats with the
capitalists, enabling the anti-democrats to
claim they are fighting imperialism. For
decades the CIA has intentionally muddied
the waters, toppling elected Marxists in order
to maintain the myth that electing a Marxist
means throwing away the democracy. It must
be made clear that the CIA s crimes against
democracy are the gravest of crimes, never to
be repeated.
Reagan has called for "full democracy" in
Nicaragua, as a ruse (so far) for derailing the
new Central American peace process. Let us
hear him call for it in earnest. Let us hear him
welcome the Sandinistas if they are willing to
become the founding party of an open
democracy.
