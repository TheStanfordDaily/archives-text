## Minority panel selection justified 
### 
There has recently been some controversy
surrounding the ASSU Senate's decision to
allow the four organizations for students of
color (the Black Student Union, the Asian
American Student Association, MEChA and
the Stanford American Indian Organization)
to choose their own nominees for the Com
mittee on Minority Affairs. To understand
the senate's reasoning, one needs to know
why this committee was ever set up in the
first place.

Last spring, students from the black,
Chicano, Asian-American and Native Ameri
can communities joined together to form the
Rainbow Agenda, which defined minority
needs that were not being met by Stanford.
They felt that normal means and usual chan
nels were proving unresponsive to students
of color, and thus they went "outside the sys
tem'' â€” through protests, a sit-in and a lot of
pressure they fought to make Stanford recog
nize the existence of racism here.
As a result of these protests, the Commit
tee on Minority Issues was set up to investi
gate the conditions and problems faced by
students of color. Such a study was one of the
demands of the Rainbow Agenda. This is an
unusual committee set up for a special mis

sion, and its decisions will have long-lasting
impact. It is essential that the student repre
sentatives on this committee have a full un
derstanding of the needs of the minority com
munities in order to represent them on the
committee. We in the ASSU feel that the
Third World communities themselves are
better qualified than we are to determine who
can best represent their concerns on this
committee.

The Third World
communities themselves
are better qualified than we
are to determine who can
best represent their
concerns.

Just as the students of color had to go
outside the system to have their particular
needs met, we are going outside normal pro
cedures to be able to address problems of rac
ism on campus. For too long other people
have been claiming to understand and repre
sent the minority communities and have
proven insensitive and inadequate; only the
communities themselves can define their

needs, and they therefore deserve the right to
choose their own representatives. And
indeed, they want this right: At the senate
meeting where we made this decision, all four
student-of-color organizations brought num
bers of students to lobby the senate; it was
one of our largest public turnouts in years.
One other concern the senate raised sur
rounded the title of the commission. The term
"minority" also includes disabled people,
gays and lesbians, Jews and other groups.
Originally, students of color had sought a title
such as "Committee on Institutional Rac
ism," which would have been clearer, but
this title was not accepted by the administra
tion. Thus the senate is now suggesting that
the title be changed to "Commission on Eth
nic Minority Issues" for clarification
purposes.
And just to clarify an inaccuracy that ap
peared in a recent Daily viewpoint: all stu
dents were still able to apply for this commit
tee. Applications that came to the ASSU of
fice were referred to one of the four minority
communities.
We hope that this process has resulted in
the most qualified persons being selected for
such a crucial and badly needed committee.
We also hope that it will enable us to continue
to build mutually cooperative relations be
tween student government and students of
color at Stanford.
