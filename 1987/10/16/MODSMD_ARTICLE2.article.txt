# Crucial time for Centennial ahead
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
Despite the record-setting $198.5 million
raised last year for the Centennial Campaign,
University Provost James Rosse described
Stanford's fund-raising situation as both
"good and worrisome" in a meeting with the
Faculty Senate yesterday.
"The good news is that we received partic
ular strength from individual donors, but the
mix of gifts in terms of those designated for
'featured objectives' and those for general
use was less encouraging," Rosse said.
"Featured objectives" are specific proj
ects for the University, and Rosse said that
the University must emphasize this area
more if the Centennial Campaign is to be suc
cessful. Last year, the campaign set a na
tional fund-raising record for the second con

secutive year.
"It takes a while to develop an interest in
featured objectives," Rosse said. "The chal
lenge is to excite donors in this area, and this
is where the involvement of the faculty is the
key."
According to Rosse, the University Devel
opment Office regards the next three months
as "crucial" in determining the progress of
the campaign.
A Faculty Senate committee for oversight
and advice to the campaign is scheduled to
report on its progress this February.
In other business, Political Science Prof.
David Danelski outlined the new Stanford-in-
Washington program, which he will direct.
The Washington, D.C., program will ar
range high-level internships for 30 students
(although only 16 will participate in the pilot
program this spring) in organizations such as

the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the
State Department and the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, according to Danelski.
"The Stanford presence in the capital will
be important," Danelski said, adding that the
program could result in closer ties between
the Stanford faculty and "decision makers"
in Washington.
Students in the Stanford-in-Washington
program will have to submit a paper or proj
ect relating to the internship, and will also
participate in theme tutorials relating to their
policy interest and a seminar taught by a
Stanford faculty member.
Both students and faculty will live in an
apartment complex in the DuPont Circle area
of the city. Danelski said that the facility
might also be used for summer housing for
