# ASSU fees pay for student activities
## 
### Sherrell Evans 
This is the first in a series on
how the ASSU spends its
money. The next installment
will appear next Friday.

Every registered Stanford
student pays $24 to the ASSU
each quarter, but few give any
serious thought to the alloca
tion of those funds.
The sum of these fees makes
up the budget that the ASSU
uses to fund most programs
run by student organizations
on campus. Financing the ac
tivities of these organizations
is one of the most important
responsibilities of the ASSU.
According to Council of
Presidents member Leonard
Adler, the ASSU only funds
specific programs that student
groups organize, and not the
groups themselves.
The money that goes to
these programs makes up two
fees in the ASSU: the $150,000
General Fee of the Program
Board and the Special Fee
totaling approximately
$658,000 this year.
Surprisingly, the substan
tially larger Special Fee is
traditionally allocated to a
small number of the largest
campus groups, while the
remaining 100-plus organiza

tions are funded by the smaller
General Fee.
This year, 14 student groups
will benefit from the Special
Fee funds. Some of these in
clude the Axe Committee, the
Black Student Union, The
Daily, KZSU and the Stanford
Band.
To determine which pro
grams will receive ASSU
funding, a group of seven at
large students, called the Pro
gram Board, holds six discre
tionary cycles a year. At these
times, groups who have peti
tioned to the board may
receive funds from the Gen
eral Fee.
In addition, the student pop
ulation votes once every year
on how to distribute the Spe
cial Fee among groups on the
ASSU spring election ballot.
Student organizations
petitioning the board for fund
ing from the General Fee must
"be educational and open to
the Stanford population and
nonpolitical â€” (providing) a
beneficial educational experi
ence for the community," ac
cording to senior Mark
Garner, ASSU Program Board
director.
Adler noted that the ASSU
does not fund any political
groups.
