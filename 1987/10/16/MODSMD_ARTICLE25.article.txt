# ASSU fees pay for student activities
## 
### Sherrell Evans 
This is the first in a series on
how the ASSU spends its
money. The next installment
will appear next Friday.

Every registered Stanford
student pays $24 to the ASSU
each quarter, but few give any
serious thought to the alloca
tion of those funds.
The sum of these fees makes
up the budget that the ASSU
uses to fund most programs
run by student organizations
on campus. Financing the ac
tivities of these organizations
is one of the most important
responsibilities of the ASSU.
According to Council of
Presidents member Leonard
Adler, the ASSU only funds
specific programs that student
groups organize, and not the
groups themselves.
The money that goes to
these programs makes up two
fees in the ASSU: the $150,000
General Fee of the Program
Board and the Special Fee
totaling approximately
$658,000 this year.
Surprisingly, the substan
tially larger Special Fee is
traditionally allocated to a
small number of the largest
campus groups, while the
remaining 100-plus organiza

tions are funded by the smaller
General Fee.
This year, 14 student groups
will benefit from the Special
Fee funds. Some of these in
clude the Axe Committee, the
Black Student Union, The
Daily, KZSU and the Stanford
Band.
To determine which pro
grams will receive ASSU
funding, a group of seven at
large students, called the Pro
gram Board, holds six discre
tionary cycles a year. At these
times, groups who have peti
tioned to the board may
receive funds from the Gen
eral Fee.
In addition, the student pop
ulation votes once every year
on how to distribute the Spe
cial Fee among groups on the
ASSU spring election ballot.
Student organizations
petitioning the board for fund
ing from the General Fee must
"be educational and open to
the Stanford population and
nonpolitical — (providing) a
beneficial educational experi
ence for the community," ac
cording to senior Mark
Garner, ASSU Program Board
director.
Adler noted that the ASSU
does not fund any political
groups.
Although the personal
preferences of the individual Pro
gram Board members might in
fluence the allocation of these
funds, Garner said that "we do
our best not to (let personal
opinions interfere)."
"The Program Board is made
up of {members from J the overall
population — male, female,
minorities, different classes, dif
ferent majors (and) different
(ASSU) programmatic back
grounds," Garner said emphasiz
ing the board's appeal to a wide
variety of student interests.
If an organization is denied its
request for funding, it can
restructure its program and
reapply for funds during the next
discretionary cycle. Garner said,
emphasizing that the programs,
and not the organization itself,
are important in deciding
whether or not to finance a
Kroup.
The 31 student members of the
ASSU Senate ultimately vote on
all funding recommendations
made by the Program Board.
Student organizations occa
sionally petition to the senate's
Appropriations Committee with
complaints. The committee,

usually composed of six
senators, reviews the Program
Board's recommendations before
the final senate vote.
A group may petition if it dis
agrees with a Program Board de
cision, Garner said.
Last year, for example, the
Appropriations Committee over
turned the Program Board's deci
sion not to grant funds to Stan
ford Out of South Africa.
If, however, a group exhausts
all these means to secure ASSU
funds, or prefers to find alternate
sources of financing, it may turn
to Student Organization Services
(SOS) or to the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs, both of
whom provide limited funds for
campus activities.
"In order to get funded by [the
ASSU, student organizations]
must look to outside funding
sources as well. We will not fund
the entire program," Garner
said.
Student organizations may
also turn to alternate sources of
funding through various depart
ments or schools of the Univer
sity, Adler said.
Council of Presidents member
Roechelle Smith, who belongs to
both the Program Board and to
the senate's Appropriations
Committee, said she does not be
lieve that the ASSU is overbur
dened by the funding requests of

almost all of Stanford's student
organizations.
"For some organizations it's
easier to get funding elsewhere.
For others it isn't," she said.
To ensure that student organi
zations are satisfied with the
ASSU funding process, Smith
said she is making it her personal
concern to conduct a survey of
the treasurers of all clubs.
The survey "is mainly directed
at student treasurers and the
process they go through to get
funding for their organizations,"
she said, explaining that the proj
ect is designed to determine the
fairness of the funding allocation
process.
One of the principal reasons
the ASSU student fee assess
ment was raised to $24 this year
from last year's $17 fee is the fact
that students must now contrib
ute to the Community Service
Fee Program. "The fee was set
up to provide money for organi
zations that do primarily commu
nity service and projects not
primarily focused at the Stanford
population," Garner said.
Students voted to create the
Community Service Fee in the
ASSU election last spring.
Before this year, student groups
could only seek financial assis
tance for most service projects
from the Public Service Center or
from the Dean of Student Affairs.
