## Students study outdoor sports 
### Davina Butt 
Starting this year, a group of
Stanford students will earn
course units while taking part in
outdoor sports activities through
a new program called the Out
door Education Project.
Developed by two graduate
students and funded by the
ASSU, the Outdoor Education
Project (OEP) is being offered for
the first time this quarter.
Courses will also be offered win
ter and spring quarters.
As an introduction to hiking
and camping for beginning stu
dents, the class of 11 took its first
trip last weekend to Big Basin
State Park.
The group's next trip will be to
the Sierra Nevada..
"We're really excited. The
people worked well together, and
they enjoyed the walks and dis
cussing the ecology. 1 think it's
great," OEP course instructor
and co-founder Susanna Loeb
said of the class's first excursion.
Libby Logerwell, also a course
instructor, was equally enthusi
astic. "I think it's going real well.
What's most exciting is how well
the students work together," she
said.
The course, which carries one
unit of physical education credit,
requires a fee of about $80 to
cover food and equipment re
placement costs. Equipment and
transportation to and from sites
are provided.
Loeb said she and graduate
student Wally Mann designed the

course because they saw a need
for a comprehensive outdoor ed
ucation program at Stanford.
Although Stanford Outdoor
Adventures and Recreation
(SOAR) offers weekend rfcck
climbing and backpacking trips,
that program attracts primarily
graduate students. While
graduates may enroll in OEP, the
course is geared more toward un
dergraduates who would other
wise never discover the outdoors
for lack of expensive equipment,
a safe environment and willing
friends, according to OEP's

course description.
OEP plans to go beyond the
scope of SOAR by teaching the
skills and knowledge necessary
for students to enjoy the out
doors on their own.
Although OEP teaches
primarily those outdoor skills ap
propriate to Northern California,
the program also offers instruc
tion in skills that are applicable to
most wilderness structures, in
cluding communication, use of
safety equipment and basic first
aid.
According to course instructor

Wally Mann, "the first class was
really fun. Everyone was really
psyched. Everyone is having a
really good time."
Having started with only two
instructors, OEP now has a staff
of ten "really enthusiastic in
structors," Mann said, adding
that "there's been quite a gelling
(in the course) in the last month
or so."
Other universities, such as
UC-Davis and Vanderbilt Uni
versity, Mann's alma mater.

have courses similar to the OEP.
Mann said he modeled Stan
ford's OEP after the program at
Vanderbilt when he realized that
Stanford did not offer any "really
organized opportunity for begin
ners to learn about and experi
ence the outdoors." Mann said
he views this course as an at
tempt to fill that gap.
He added that he hopes to ex
pand the course winter quarter to
two sessions with ten students
each. "1 would say that the pro
gram is going much better than
expected," he said.
Both course directors said they
hope to eventually expand OEP
by offering advanced courses
that would focus on specific
skills.
Although the program is cur
rently limited by a shortage of
funds, Mann said he is optimistic
about the program's future. "The
ASSU has been very generous,
but any help from philanthropic
groups would be appreciated,"
he said.
According to Zenon Kuc, a
student in the class this quarter
and a fourth-year graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering,

OEP "is a wonderful class. It's
something that's unexpected at
Stanford. I just needed to get out
of the lab and back into nature.
This is my fourth year at Stan
ford and I'd still never been to
Yosemite before."

k [OEP] gives you a
chance to do things
you wouldn't other
wise get to do in a
college environ
ment. It's a great
opportunity to learn
outside the lecture
hall/ — Patty
Marby, freshman

Kuc described the program as
"the perfect opportunity to go
out with a good group of
people." He added that "it's un

believable how we work together
as a group. I didn't have a con
cept of what hiking was all
about."
Kuc also said the OEP offers
him a chance to explore opportu
nities he would otherwise never
dream of. "We're supposed to
take a trip over Thanksgiving —
a no food weekend. I'm a little in
timidated, but also kind of
excited about learning to live off
the land."
Like many other students cur
rently enrolled in the course,
Kuc hopes to continue his partic
ipation in the program. "Given
the chance, I'd love to take it
again. They're going to go cross
country skiing winter quarter and
rock climbing in the spring."
Freshman Patty Marby, who is
also enrolled in OEP this quarter,
said the program "gives you a
chance to do things you wouldn't
otherwise get to do in a college
environment. It's a great oppor
tunity to learn outside the lecture
hall. I saw the redwoods, and
they were so tall. It was
amazing."
"It's a broadening experience
just being out alone in nature
with a couple of crickets and
deer," one student said. "The
feeling you get. . . . It's hard to
explain."
