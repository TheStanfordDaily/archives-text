## Students study outdoor sports 
### Davina Butt 
Starting this year, a group of
Stanford students will earn
course units while taking part in
outdoor sports activities through
a new program called the Out
door Education Project.
Developed by two graduate
students and funded by the
ASSU, the Outdoor Education
Project (OEP) is being offered for
the first time this quarter.
Courses will also be offered win
ter and spring quarters.
As an introduction to hiking
and camping for beginning stu
dents, the class of 11 took its first
trip last weekend to Big Basin
State Park.
The group's next trip will be to
the Sierra Nevada..
"We're really excited. The
people worked well together, and
they enjoyed the walks and dis
cussing the ecology. 1 think it's
great," OEP course instructor
and co-founder Susanna Loeb
said of the class's first excursion.
Libby Logerwell, also a course
instructor, was equally enthusi
astic. "I think it's going real well.
What's most exciting is how well
the students work together," she
said.
The course, which carries one
unit of physical education credit,
requires a fee of about $80 to
cover food and equipment re
placement costs. Equipment and
transportation to and from sites
are provided.
Loeb said she and graduate
student Wally Mann designed the

course because they saw a need
for a comprehensive outdoor ed
ucation program at Stanford.
Although Stanford Outdoor
Adventures and Recreation
(SOAR) offers weekend rfcck
climbing and backpacking trips,
that program attracts primarily
graduate students. While
graduates may enroll in OEP, the
course is geared more toward un
dergraduates who would other
wise never discover the outdoors
for lack of expensive equipment,
a safe environment and willing
friends, according to OEP's

course description.
OEP plans to go beyond the
scope of SOAR by teaching the
skills and knowledge necessary
for students to enjoy the out
doors on their own.
Although OEP teaches
primarily those outdoor skills ap
propriate to Northern California,
the program also offers instruc
tion in skills that are applicable to
most wilderness structures, in
cluding communication, use of
safety equipment and basic first
aid.
According to course instructor

Wally Mann, "the first class was
really fun. Everyone was really
psyched. Everyone is having a
really good time."
Having started with only two
instructors, OEP now has a staff
of ten "really enthusiastic in
structors," Mann said, adding
that "there's been quite a gelling
(in the course) in the last month
or so."
Other universities, such as
UC-Davis and Vanderbilt Uni
versity, Mann's alma mater.
