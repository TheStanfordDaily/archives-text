## Banal 'Bride' lacks satiric edge 
### Charon Kim 
Rob Reiner's first movie — the
amiably dull "This is Spinal
Tap" — was framed as a spoof
documentary, but long before the
bass player's closing credit
monologue about the job of
mediating between fire and ice
("I'm like lukewarm water") was
over, the movie's framework had
already given way to the stress of
too much heavy farce.
Although a few of the fake in
terviews and concert scenes in
"Spinal Tap" were really funny,
they made the musicians look
ridiculously, impossibly stupid
— more than simply pretentious
and inept (in a way that a star
struck director might mistake for
brilliant).
Fortunately, however, the
splintered frame remained, or
enough of it at least so that we
would always remember Christo
pher Guest's defense of his
band's amplification equipment
("Ours go to eleven") without
feeling as if we had inadvertently
recalled some movie parody from
Mad magazine. Lacking any
clear creative motivation,
however, "Spinal Tap" was not
much better sustained than one
of those pointless Mad parodies.
Nowadays, Reiner is getting
enthusiastic praise for his latest
movie, "The Princess Bride."
Certainly this new film has some
pretty good jokes and clever
caricatures in it, but ultimately
it's as structurally inconsistent as
"Spinal Tap."
In "Bride," an old man
(played by Peter Falk) begins
reading a fairy tale to his skepti
cal 10-year-old grandson to prove
that a good story can be as excit

ing and satisfying as any televi
sion show. Of course, this isn't
really fair, because we get to see
the book as a movie, with all the
attention-grabbing sensory bom
bardment that the boy is reluc
tant to do without.
But Reiner seems to be after a
weird kind of synthesis between
books and movies in"The
Princess Bride." Early in the
film, as the actual story begins,
there are sudden breaks in the ac
tion when the boy interrupts his
grandfather; and then the story
resumes with perhaps a small
omission or repetition, giving us
a sense of the freedom movies
don't allow us — to vary pace
and emphasis as we choose. In
those first few minutes, we can
almost believe that Falk is
reading what we're seeing.
This illusion soon disappears.
This movie has a William
Goldman ("Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid," "All the
President's Men") script, which
means that most of the lines and
scenes have a self-indulgent,
unctuous polish to them, applied
with a kind of cynicism not well
suited for anything short of broad
satire.
It's hardly a surprise, then,
that the script takes a turn in this
direction, even though the result
is a leveling of the movie's
structure. We may laugh at an
ancient miracle-worker (Billy
Crystal) who talks like a Catskills
comedian, or at a giant (played
by wrestler Andre the Giant) who
feels uncomfortable carrying out
an assassination in an un
sportsmanlike manner, or at the
way the heroine (Robin Wright)
rolls down a hill to reach the hero
(Cary Elwes), but what we're

really laughing at is the genre it
self — at how dopey it is.
The little boy, however, is
supposed to take it all straight;
and, having listened up to the last
page of the book, he lets his
grandfather read the "kissing
part" (though he refused to hear
a similar passage from the begin
ning) because by now,
presumably, the love story has
touched his heart. We don't
groan at this, perhaps, but we
might have if we hadn't already
dismissed the plot as hopeless an
hour before.
Most of the actors perform
well — especially Mandy

Patinkin as a kind-hearted outlaw
who has spent his life on a
revenge quest (Maybe the reason
he stands out is that the sparkle
in his eye looks genuine; he's
surprising in the way that
Timothy Dalton was surprising
as the new James Bond).
Unfortunately, the lovers are
not a very engaging pair. They
can't seem to express much of
anything — either to each other
or to us.
But Reiner is a master of in
consequence. His movies are too
harmless to dislike, and there are
times when we aren't interested
in anything more than that.

("Ours go to eleven") without
feeling as if we had inadvertently
recalled some movie parody from
Mad magazine. Lacking any
clear creative motivation,
however, "Spinal Tap" was not
much better sustained than one
of those pointless Mad parodies.
Nowadays, Reiner is getting
enthusiastic praise for his latest
movie, "The Princess Bride."
Certainly this new film has some
pretty good jokes and clever
caricatures in it, but ultimately
it's as structurally inconsistent as
"Spinal Tap."
In "Bride," an old man
(played by Peter Falk) begins
reading a fairy tale to his skepti
cal 10-year-old grandson to prove
that a good story can be as excit

ing and satisfying as any televi
sion show. Of course, this isn't
really fair, because we get to see
the book as a movie, with all the
attention-grabbing sensory bom
bardment that the boy is reluc
tant to do without.
But Reiner seems to be after a
weird kind of synthesis between
books and movies in"The
Princess Bride." Early in the
film, as the actual story begins,
there are sudden breaks in the ac
tion when the boy interrupts his
grandfather; and then the story
resumes with perhaps a small
omission or repetition, giving us
a sense of the freedom movies
don't allow us — to vary pace
and emphasis as we choose. In
those first few minutes, we can
almost believe that Falk is
reading what we're seeing.
This illusion soon disappears.
This movie has a William
Goldman ("Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid," "All the
President's Men") script, which
means that most of the lines and
scenes have a self-indulgent,
unctuous polish to them, applied
with a kind of cynicism not well
suited for anything short of broad
satire.
It's hardly a surprise, then,
that the script takes a turn in this
direction, even though the result
is a leveling of the movie's
structure. We may laugh at an
ancient miracle-worker (Billy
Crystal) who talks like a Catskills
comedian, or at a giant (played
by wrestler Andre the Giant) who
feels uncomfortable carrying out
an assassination in an un
sportsmanlike manner, or at the
way the heroine (Robin Wright)
rolls down a hill to reach the hero
(Cary Elwes), but what we're

really laughing at is the genre it
self — at how dopey it is.
The little boy, however, is
supposed to take it all straight;
and, having listened up to the last
page of the book, he lets his
grandfather read the "kissing
part" (though he refused to hear
a similar passage from the begin
ning) because by now,
presumably, the love story has
touched his heart. We don't
groan at this, perhaps, but we
might have if we hadn't already
dismissed the plot as hopeless an
hour before.
Most of the actors perform
well — especially Mandy

Patinkin as a kind-hearted outlaw
who has spent his life on a
revenge quest (Maybe the reason
he stands out is that the sparkle
in his eye looks genuine; he's
surprising in the way that
Timothy Dalton was surprising
as the new James Bond).
Unfortunately, the lovers are
not a very engaging pair. They
can't seem to express much of
anything — either to each other
or to us.
But Reiner is a master of in
consequence. His movies are too
harmless to dislike, and there are
times when we aren't interested
in anything more than that.

Rob Reiner's first movie — the
amiably dull "This is Spinal
Tap" — was framed as a spoof
documentary, but long before the
bass player's closing credit
monologue about the job of
mediating between fire and ice
("I'm like lukewarm water") was
over, the movie's framework had
already given way to the stress of
too much heavy farce.
Although a few of the fake in
terviews and concert scenes in
"Spinal Tap" were really funny,
they made the musicians look
ridiculously, impossibly stupid
— more than simply pretentious
and inept (in a way that a star
struck director might mistake for
brilliant).
Fortunately, however, the
splintered frame remained, or
enough of it at least so that we
would always remember Christo
pher Guest's defense of his
band's amplification equipment
("Ours go to eleven") without
feeling as if we had inadvertently
recalled some movie parody from
Mad magazine. Lacking any
clear creative motivation,
however, "Spinal Tap" was not
much better sustained than one
of those pointless Mad parodies.
