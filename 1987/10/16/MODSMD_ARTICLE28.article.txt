# Woods scores a 'Best Seller'
## 
### Mark Tompkins Editorial Staff 
"Best Seller" is a movie
that races through a number of
genres, but which thankfully
manages to trash all the
cliches associated with those
genres.
"Best Seller" is part buddy
movie, road movie and black
comedy, as well as being a vio
lent and fast-paced thriller.
Generic labels don't readily
apply here.
Best of all, though, "Best
Seller" has James Woods. A
lot of big name actors could
learn a few things from
Woods. He's an actor who
makes any role interesting. I
don't even remember who
won Best Actor this year, but
it should have been Woods for
his role in "Salvador."
In "Best Seller," Woods
plays Cleve, a corporation ex
ecutive in charge of 'liabilities
removal.' Assassination, that
is. Cleve is a dedicated,
buttoned-up professional, only
his duties are rigging murders
to look like accidents, with the
occasional blatant 'hit' thrown
in for good measure.
The problem is, Cleve has
just been let go by the in
dustrialist Madlock (Paul
Shenar), who used him to get
to the top. It seems that any
time someone with a guilty
conscience got in Madlock's
way, he had Cleve take care of

things. But now Cleve is on
the streets, without any
reward for his efforts. Cleve
wants respect, so he goes to
the Joseph Wambaugh-like
character of Dennis Meechum
(Brian Dennehy) for help.
Meechum is a cop who writes
best-selling novels on the side,
only now he can't come up
with any good ideas, and his
publishers are talking about
lawsuits.
Cleve wants Meechum to
write the story of how he
brought an industrialist to
power with his talent for mur
der. Cleve will show Meech
um all the murder sites and
corporate records as proof;
the resulting book, he hopes,
will be a best seller for Meec
hum and will allow him to get
back at the boss who spurned
him.
"Best Seller" builds nicely,
thanks to the relationship be
tween the two leads. Wiry and
agitated, Woods is perfectly
complemented by the impos
ing Brian Dennehy.
As you might expect, the
Cleve character attracts a lot
of violence, so there's an im
pressively high body count
scored in the film.
"Best Seller" is, essen
tially, a pretty good movie. It
has wit, intelligence and great
acting — and the gun fights in
it are a lot better than the ones
in "Maurice." What are you
waiting for?
