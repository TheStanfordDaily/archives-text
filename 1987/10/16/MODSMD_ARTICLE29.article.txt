## Stanford seeks second win at San Diego Si. 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
The Stanford football team doesn't
have really fond memories of Jack
Murphy Stadium.
That was the site of San Diego
State's 41-22 drubbing of the Cardinal
two years ago, a game in which Stan
ford compiled 498 yards of total offense
but gave up 513 yards in return. Cardi
nal quarterback John Faye completed a
school record 4() passes in 56 attempts
for 385 yards, while counterpart Todd
Santos was 18 of 24 for 320 yards —
and four touchdowns.
"Last time at Jack Murphy Stadium
was probably one of the worst games of
the year as far as we were concerned,"
Stanford Coach Jack El way said.
"That was one of those things you
just don't forget," Stanford linebacker
Barry McKeever added.
Jack Murphy Stadium will be the site
of tommorrow evening's rematch, but
it will be freshman quarterback Brian
Johnson opposing Heisman Trophy
candidate Santos, who missed last
year's game at Stanford with a broken
wrist.
Stanford's own preseason Heisman
Trophy candidate, however, may miss
this season's contest. Running back
Brad Muster, who rushed for 115 yards
in the 17-10 Cardinal win over the Az
tecs last year, was in for just one play
this week in practice. The senior has
been able to do some running on his

own, but is unlikely to play in the non
conference matchup with San Diego
State.
Fullback Charlie Young is also
doubtful, with a thigh bruise suffered
on the first play of the 44-7 win over
Washington State last week. Safety
Bruce Richardson missed the first two
days of practice this week with a
pinched nerve in his neck, but should
be available to play. Offensive tackle
Jon Summers will play, despite break
ing two fingers against the Cougars last
week.
With the many injuries at running
back, Stanford (1-4 overall, 1-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) will again be
relying on tailback Jon Volpe, who
rushed for 105 yards and two touch
downs on 26 carries last week. The
sophomore also caught two passes for
89 yards, including a 65-yard score. "I
like catching the ball," Volpe said.
"With the routes I run, there's usually
no one around me when I catch it."
For the first time in weeks, there is
no speculation about who the man
throwing those passes will be. Sopho
more Brian Johnson will make his
second straight start after going 12-of
-23 for 278 yards and two touchdowns
against Washington State. "Brian
Johnson did an excellent job," Elway
said. "He showed poise, he threw ac
curately and demonstrated good judge
ment.''
There's no question who the Aztec
quarterback will be, either. Santos

needs just 219 yards to move into
eighth place on the NCAA all-time
career passing list, and has thrown for
1577 so far this year. The senior has
thrown 11 touchdown passes and six
interceptions.
In last week's last-second 34-33 loss
to Texas-El Paso, Santos was 21-for-37
for 192 yards and two touchdowns, but
the team rushed for more yardage than
it gained in the air, with 226 yards on
the ground. Junior tailback Paul Hewitt
raced for 149 yards and leads the squad
with 435 yards and six touchdowns.
Hewitt also has 16 receptions for 156
yards.
Second-leading rusher Tommy
Booker is listed as day-to-day with an
ankle injury (sound familiar?), and
receiver Randy Peterson is out after
undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his
knee.
"We've been a very, very healthy
football team all year," San Diego
State Coach Denny Stolz said."We're
as close to full strength as anyone
could be this time of year."
Although health hasn't been a prob
lem for the Aztecs, getting wins has.
San Diego State is 1-5 overall and 1-3 in
the Western Athletic Conference, due
in part to poor scheduling, which had
the Aztecs on the road four of their first
five games. The Aztecs lost all four
road contests, including games at
UCLA (47-14) and at Oregon (25-20),

but have won one of two at
home.
"We've certainly been disap
pointing in our record," Stolz
said. "A couple of games we
played very, very poorly. . . .
It's an asinine schedule, our ath
letic director won't let that hap
pen again."
Elway isn't about to take San

Diego State lightly. "They can
run and they are physical," he
said.

"We've certainly been disap
pointing in our record," Stolz
said. "A couple of games we
played very, very poorly. . . .
It's an asinine schedule, our ath
letic director won't let that hap
pen again."
Elway isn't about to take San

Diego State lightly. "They can
run and they are physical," he
said.

Despite the overall record. Stan

with its 1-2 conference record.
UCLA and Oregon, who meet tom

records.
The Stanford football team doesn't
have really fond memories of Jack
Murphy Stadium.
That was the site of San Diego
State's 41-22 drubbing of the Cardinal
two years ago, a game in which Stan
ford compiled 498 yards of total offense
but gave up 513 yards in return. Cardi
nal quarterback John Faye completed a
school record 4() passes in 56 attempts
for 385 yards, while counterpart Todd
Santos was 18 of 24 for 320 yards —
and four touchdowns.
"Last time at Jack Murphy Stadium
was probably one of the worst games of
the year as far as we were concerned,"
Stanford Coach Jack El way said.
"That was one of those things you
just don't forget," Stanford linebacker
Barry McKeever added.
Jack Murphy Stadium will be the site
of tommorrow evening's rematch, but
it will be freshman quarterback Brian
Johnson opposing Heisman Trophy
candidate Santos, who missed last
year's game at Stanford with a broken
wrist.
Stanford's own preseason Heisman
Trophy candidate, however, may miss
this season's contest. Running back
Brad Muster, who rushed for 115 yards
in the 17-10 Cardinal win over the Az
tecs last year, was in for just one play
this week in practice. The senior has
been able to do some running on his

own, but is unlikely to play in the non
conference matchup with San Diego
State.
Fullback Charlie Young is also
doubtful, with a thigh bruise suffered
on the first play of the 44-7 win over
Washington State last week. Safety
Bruce Richardson missed the first two
days of practice this week with a
pinched nerve in his neck, but should
be available to play. Offensive tackle
Jon Summers will play, despite break
ing two fingers against the Cougars last
week.
With the many injuries at running
back, Stanford (1-4 overall, 1-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) will again be
relying on tailback Jon Volpe, who
rushed for 105 yards and two touch
downs on 26 carries last week. The
sophomore also caught two passes for
89 yards, including a 65-yard score. "I
like catching the ball," Volpe said.
"With the routes I run, there's usually
no one around me when I catch it."
For the first time in weeks, there is
no speculation about who the man
throwing those passes will be. Sopho
more Brian Johnson will make his
second straight start after going 12-of
-23 for 278 yards and two touchdowns
against Washington State. "Brian
Johnson did an excellent job," Elway
said. "He showed poise, he threw ac
curately and demonstrated good judge
ment.''
There's no question who the Aztec
quarterback will be, either. Santos

needs just 219 yards to move into
eighth place on the NCAA all-time
career passing list, and has thrown for
1577 so far this year. The senior has
thrown 11 touchdown passes and six
interceptions.
In last week's last-second 34-33 loss
to Texas-El Paso, Santos was 21-for-37
for 192 yards and two touchdowns, but
the team rushed for more yardage than
it gained in the air, with 226 yards on
the ground. Junior tailback Paul Hewitt
raced for 149 yards and leads the squad
with 435 yards and six touchdowns.
Hewitt also has 16 receptions for 156
yards.
Second-leading rusher Tommy
Booker is listed as day-to-day with an
ankle injury (sound familiar?), and
receiver Randy Peterson is out after
undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his
knee.
"We've been a very, very healthy
football team all year," San Diego
State Coach Denny Stolz said."We're
as close to full strength as anyone
could be this time of year."
Although health hasn't been a prob
lem for the Aztecs, getting wins has.
San Diego State is 1-5 overall and 1-3 in
the Western Athletic Conference, due
in part to poor scheduling, which had
the Aztecs on the road four of their first
five games. The Aztecs lost all four
road contests, including games at
UCLA (47-14) and at Oregon (25-20),
