# Washington campus nears readiness
## 
### C.R. Douglas Ted Lieu 
Beginning this March, 16 Stanford students
will have the chance to live and study in
Washington, D.C. — the latest site in Stan
ford's expanding "overseas" program.
The Washington campus, which will be
housed in a refurbished hotel recently pur
chased by the University, is located on Con
necticut Avenue, just minutes by subway
from downtown Washington. The University
Board of Trustees earlier this week allocated
over $3 million for the purchase of the build
ing.
The idea for a satellite campus in the na
tion's capital was the brainchild of University
President Donald Kennedy. "To say I am
thrilled is to understate my feelings. It's a
dream come true," Kennedy said.
Kennedy spent over three years in the

-1970s working in Washington as director of
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
When he returned to Stanford in 1980, Ken
nedy pushed hard for the establishment of a
Stanford center in Washington.
"Kennedy was determined that Stanford
should play a larger role in the Washington,
D.C., political scene, and that students
should ne better prepared to take on roles in
public service,'' University Provost James
Rosse said.
Modeled in part after the overseas campus
in Oxford, the Stanford-in-Washington pro
gram will have three major components:
tutorials, internships and weekly seminars.
"This program will provide a great oppor
tunity for students to learn directly about
public policymaking in Washington," said
Political Science Prof. David Danelski, direc
tor of the Washington program.
"We will try to capitalize on the great re

sources Stanford has in Washington. Intern
ship supervisors will provide insights and un
derstanding that students won't get out of a
seminar alone," Danelski said.
The seminars, which will be taught by visit
ing Stanford faculty, will focus on the institu
tions, processes and content of public policy.
The tutorials and internships will cater to a
broader spectrum of academic interests.
Students will be matched with "internship
supervisors" — people in their area of inter
est working in Washington — who will serve
as mentors for students, according to
Danelski.
Danelski, who will do the matching, said he
hopes to secure interships in congressional
offices, government agencies and private lob
bying firms.
Although the program is sure to attract stu-
dents interested in government,
Danelski said, "It is not just for
political science and economics
majors."
"I envision students in intern
ships at the National Gallery, the
National Institutes of Health and
the Washington Post," he said.
The tutorials are intended to
give students a chance to com
plement their hands-on work in

internships with an academic ex
perience in the same subject
area.
According to Danelski, the
tutors will be Washington-based
experts in various fields.
While other non-Washington
colleges and universities have
programs in the nation's capital,
Danelski said he thinks Stan
ford's will be one of the "most
comprehensive" among them.
"No (non-Washington) school
will have as full a residence pro
gram as ours," he added.

Danelski said he considers the
program ideal for those students
who have a focused interest, who
learn fast and who write well.
Sixteen students will be taken
for the pilot program next spring,
after which the program will ex
pand to take 30 students.
Students will be admitted to
the program on the basis of
several factors: a statement of
purpose, a transcript, a writing
sample and two letters of recom
mendation. The application
deadline for spring quarter is
Nov. 4.

Danelski said he considers the
program ideal for those students
who have a focused interest, who
learn fast and who write well.
Sixteen students will be taken
for the pilot program next spring,
after which the program will ex

Students will be admitted to

sample and two letters of recom
mendation. The application
deadline for spring quarter is
Nov. 4.
