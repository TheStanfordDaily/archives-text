# Spikers host Devils, Cats
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
The month of October is usually a great time to
vacation in California. The sun is pleasantly warm,
the land looks beautiful, and it never rains. The
only possible problem might be an impolite host.
The women's volleyball teams of both Arizona
State and Arizona have traveled to California for
the weekend, but they aren't expecting much of a
vacation against Stanford. The Sun Devils meet the
Cardinal at 7:30 tonight at Maples Pavilion, and the
Wildcats visit tomorrow night.
Stanford has not been a very obliging host this
year, as the sth-ranked Cardinal is 5-0 at home and
has dropped only one game there this season.
Going back to last season, Stanford has triumphed
eight straight times at home and is 11-0 in Pacific 10
Conference matches at Maples.
Stanford showed that it could also play on the
road last weekend as it beat both Oregon and
Oregon State to move into first place in the Pac-10.
The Cardinal is on an eight-match winning streak
and is now 13-3, 6-1 in the Pac-10.
lonight's foe, ASU, has not had such an easy
time of it lately. The Sun Devils come into the
match with an 8-6 mark and are all the way down in
seventh place in the league with a 3-4 mark, a far
cry from last year's 27-7, 14-4.
A big reason for ASU's downturn has been the
loss of All-Americans Tammy Webb and Valentina
Vega to graduation, but the Devils returned four
starters from last year. Their top player is All-
America senior setter Regina Stahl. Stahl is averag
ing nearly 11 assists per game this season and is in
the top 10 in the Pac-10 in service aces.
Also returning are outside hitters Tracey Bar
berie and Christy Nore, both of whom were on the
U.S. World University Games team this past sum
mer, and middle blocker Sue Nord, a Pac-10 All-
Freshman selection last season.
Junior Dawn Meidinger (41 blocks this year) is
the other middle blocker, while freshman Mindy
Gowell was the other starter on the outside before
suffering a knee injury three weeks ago. She will be
replaced by either sophomore Trade Kisro (.318

hitting percentage) or freshman Kelly Plaisted (2.3
digs per game).
The I7th-ranked Arizona Wildcats have had a
better season than their arch-rivals so far this year.
They are off to a 12-5 start and are tied with Califor
nia for fifth place in the league (4-3) going into their
match at California tonight.
The Wildcats have been led by setter Lindsay
Hahn so far this year. The sophomore from volley
ball powerhouse Mira Costa High School ranks
fourth in the Pac-10 with 11.43 assists per game and
is also in the top 10 in digs.
She has two big targets in the middle in 6-foot-1
senior Stephanie Murry (89 blocks already this
season) and 6-foot-2 sophomore Kelly Waage, as
well as junior Leigh Halliwell, who started last year
opposite Hahn as a setter/middle blocker.
Arizona's outside attack is led by Canadian
Kiyomi Morino, who has been named Pac-10
Player of the Week once already this year. Sopho
more Mary Linton also comes from north of the
border, completing the team's Canadian hitting tan
dem.
Tonight will be a tough match for the Wildcats,
as they challenge a young Golden Bear squad that
is finally coming together. Arizona will be looking
to challenge USC for fourth nlace in the conference
and hopes for a big upset at Maples tomorrow.
Standing in the way of the two Arizona schools
will be a Cardinal squad that is playing its best ball
of the season. Seniors Teresa Smith and Nancy
Reno are both averaging more than 3.9 kills per
game to lead the No. 2 offense in the Pac-10 (.254
hiitng percentage).
Senior setter Wendi Rush is currently eighth in
the nation in assists and is third in the conference in
digs, right behind junior Amy Hayes. Junior Laura
Olesen and sophomore Lara Asper round out the
Cardinal's top six, a squad with more consistency
than last year's NCAA semifinalists.
Looking ahead. Stanford hosts San Jose State
Tuesday, then gears up for the second half of Pac
-10 play. The Cardinal looks for revenge against
Pacific here Nov. 3. A showdown with UCLA,
likely to decide the league title, occurs Nov. 19th,
and a Cardinal trip to the islands for a pair against
top-ranked Hawaii follows soon after.
