# UOP, Trojans face Cardinal
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Playing water polo in the Pacific 10 Conference is
I sort of like taking an upper-level physics class. With
each new week's match, or problem set. ground
gained the week before can be lost, or ground lost
I the week before can be gained.
It's a precarious situation when each week
presents a challenge as difficult as the one pre
sented just a week before, but it's also a situation
which provides ample opportunity to learn from
one's mistakes and to compensate for previous mis
fortune. For the Stanford water polo team, which
has received an ' A +' for each of its past two terms,
tomorrow's match provides it with a chance to
make up for the relatively low grades it would
receive for its conference play so far in the 1987
$ term.
However, before welcoming No. 5 USC to
deGuerre Pool tomorrow for its third Pac-10 contest
of the fall, the No. 2-ranked Cardinal will host No.
10 University of the Pacific today at 3 p.m. While
this afternoon's match will not be a Cakewalk, it is
tomorrow's game that holds special significance as
its result will either keen the Cardinal in the confer
ence race or put it well nehind the leaders.
Going into the weekend Stanford has a win-loss
record of 12-3 and has yet to win a conference
game; the Card lost to C alifornia last Friday and
UCLA the previous Saturday. For USC (12-2), to
morrow's game is the first conference match of the
season. No. 1 Cal is atop the Pac-10 at 2-0, 12-2
J overall. No. 3 UCLA is 1-1 in the conference. At
No. 4. UC-lrvine holds the only spot among the na
tion's top five teams not held by a Pac-10 member.
