# UOP, Trojans face Cardinal
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Playing water polo in the Pacific 10 Conference is
I sort of like taking an upper-level physics class. With
each new week's match, or problem set. ground
gained the week before can be lost, or ground lost
I the week before can be gained.
It's a precarious situation when each week
presents a challenge as difficult as the one pre
sented just a week before, but it's also a situation
which provides ample opportunity to learn from
one's mistakes and to compensate for previous mis
fortune. For the Stanford water polo team, which
has received an ' A +' for each of its past two terms,
tomorrow's match provides it with a chance to
make up for the relatively low grades it would
receive for its conference play so far in the 1987
$ term.
However, before welcoming No. 5 USC to
deGuerre Pool tomorrow for its third Pac-10 contest
of the fall, the No. 2-ranked Cardinal will host No.
10 University of the Pacific today at 3 p.m. While
this afternoon's match will not be a Cakewalk, it is
tomorrow's game that holds special significance as
its result will either keen the Cardinal in the confer
ence race or put it well nehind the leaders.
Going into the weekend Stanford has a win-loss
record of 12-3 and has yet to win a conference
game; the Card lost to C alifornia last Friday and
UCLA the previous Saturday. For USC (12-2), to
morrow's game is the first conference match of the
season. No. 1 Cal is atop the Pac-10 at 2-0, 12-2
J overall. No. 3 UCLA is 1-1 in the conference. At
No. 4. UC-lrvine holds the only spot among the na
tion's top five teams not held by a Pac-10 member.

Sophomore Jon Swerdloff, one of Stanford's best wing players, has a virus and is
listed as Questionable for this weekend's games. Pacific comes to de(iuerre at 3 p.m.
today and I ISC' visits at II a.m. tomorrow.
According to Cardinal Head
Coach Dante Dettamanti, al
though any of the top five teams
is very capable of beating any of
the other top five teams, the level
of excellence takes a marked
drop when it comes to the na
tion's second five. Therefore,
while Pacific cannot be taken

lightly, it should not present a
problem to Stanford, even if the
Cardinal plays a little below its
capability.
"Pacific is definitely not one of
the nation's strongest teams,"
Dettamanti said. "We shouldn't
have any problem with them, but
we certainly can't look past them
to USC." Dettamanti hopes his
starters get off to an early lead
and allow him to substitute freely
and provide a lot of playing time
for second- and third-string
players.

Unlike their namesakes in the
safe sex department, the Trojans
of USC do not provide especially
good protection, and it is this rel
ative weakness on the defensive
end that Stanford will be looking
to exploit tomorrow. "|USC|'s
got a real good goalie (Kevin
Stringer), and we had trouble
with them last year," Dettamanti
said. "Their strength is offense,
but they don't have a lot of team
speed; they're a little weak on
defense."
Contrary to the Trojan's lack

of speed and defense, Stanford's
game is exactly that: solid
defense and the quick counterat
tacks afforded by it. Thus far this
season, however, the Cardinal
has not had the consistent rapid
fire counterattack offense of
which it is capable. Instead, the
offense has found itself mired in a
half-court set which is too reliant
on Cardinal standout and 1986
First Team All-American Frich
Fischer.
Fischer's 32 goals leave Stan
ford's second-leading scorers,

seniors Matt Tingler and Grant
Stanley with 13 each, well be
hind. And while a slight disparity
between Fischer and his
teammates was expected, a dis
parity of 19 goals is too much,
and the defensive strategy
against the Cardinal has been too
obvious for Stanford to really be
able to get its offense into full
gear.
To remedy the situation, the
team has been emphasizing
movement among the wing
players and de-emphasizing the

less complicated maneuver of
simply tossing the ball inside to
Fischer at two meters.
In light of a touch of over
zealousness on the part of the
Cardinal players during the last
week's practice sessions
however, Dettamanti said he
may have overdone his effort to
emphasize movement.
"I've been stressing more in
tensity on offense," Dettamanti
said, "But now there's so much
intensity that there's no disci
pline."
