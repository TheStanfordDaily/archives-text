No team will outwork the
Stanford women's soccer team
this season.
That much is certain when the
Cardinal faces the University of
Portland this afternoon at 3 p.m.
at Maloney Field.
The game is the first women's
soccer match ever between Stan
ford and Portland. After losing to
Cal and beating San Francisco,
both on the road, the 2-6-2 Cardi
nal returns home brimming with
confidence. Stanford came from
behind to defeat the Dons 3-2
Wednesday, and it will try to use
its new-found offensive power
today.
"At San Francisco, we were
more dominant than in any game
this year," Stanford Coach
Berhane Andeberhan said. "We
learned some lessons and won
the game at the same time."
The deciding factor in many of
the Cardinal's games this year
has been mental preparation and
concentration. In the second half
of the San Francisco game. Stan
ford kept its head in the game and
was able to overcome a two-goal
deficit.
"Soccer coaches always em
phasize to their players that the
mental game is the key," An

deberhan said.
"We're just now keeping our
minds in the game," freshman
Jenny Rowland said. "At the
start of classes we were a little
distracted. Now we're getting
into it."
Along with the psychological
edge, Stanford has put some
flavor in its offense with a new
formation designed to increase
scoring. The 4-4-2 setup allows
four forwards to be in the game at
the same time. Andeberhan has
tried the 4-4-2 for short spans all
season, but may use it ex
tensively against Portland. A
criticism of the lineup is that it is
soft on defense, with only two
fullbacks. But Stanford needs
scoring.
"The 4-4-2 works well. It lets
more players into the attack,"
sophomore fullback Christine
Martin said.
Anchoring the defense against
the Pilots will be freshman goalie
Elise Edwards. Edwards was
very impressive against San
Francisco, as was junior
goalkeeper Vija Brookshire. In
the field, junior fullback Christy
McDevitt has continued to
impress. Several freshmen arc
also developing well.
