# Women's golf soaked in Seattle

### Win Reis 
Senior Kay Cornelius captured
sixth-place honors, and freshman
Jodi Figley finished 10th as the
Stanford women's golf team took
fourth place this week at the 12-
team Washington Intercollegiate
at the Sahalee Country Club in
Redmond, Wash.
Arizona won the team title
with a three-round total of 932,
beating out host Washington by
six strokes. One stroke back of
Washington was New Mexico
State, with Stanford behind them
at 950. Twenty strokes separated
fifth-place Brigham Young from
the Cardinal.
"I think we had a great trip,"
Cornelius said. "1 think it might
have been a little adjustment pe
riod for the freshmen (to the level
of play in collegiate golf)."
"We could've done better,"
Figley said, "but considering the
conditions we played under, 1
was pleased."
Wednesday's final round was
plagued by temperatures in the
40s and torrential rains. "It was a
nightmare," Figley said.
"It (the rain and cold) affects
everybody," said Figley. "It's
just a matter of not getting tight
and lazy."
Nancy Kessler of Washington
carded an opening-day 70 on her
way to winning the individual
title with a score of 228. Second
by a stroke was Laurie Poling of
New Mexico State at 229, fol
lowed by teammate C.C. Scuder
at 230. Martina Koch of Arizona
was fourth at 231, and Robin

Crowther of New Mexico State
finished fifth at 232.
Cornelius was sixth at 233, tied
with Beth Britt of Washington.
"1 had mixed emotions about
how I played," Cornelius said.
"It was nice to take sixth, but it
would have been nicer if 1 had
won it."
"She (Cornelius) played
great," said teammate Clare
Dolan. "1 think she's going to
have a great year."
Cornelius struck the ball well,
but felt her putting was not up to
par. Cornelius has spent consid
erable time over the past six
months working on fundamental
swing changes. "1 feel like I can
see my swing changes taking ef
fect," she said.
Figley carded a second-round
76 to go with a pair of 81s to
make a strong showing. "1
could've done better, but I
played well the second day." In
shooting her 76 Figley bogeyed
the final two holes, so her score
"could have been even lower."
"My short game went really
well," she added. "I just
couldn't keep it in the fairway."
Dolan opened strong with a 79-
77, but ran into trouble on Wed
nesday, finishing with a frustrat
ing 85. "I putted well," she said,
"but overall I really wasn't strik
ing the ball well."
Freshman Michele Lyford also
fell victim to the inclement
weather as she limped in with a
final round 88 that crippled her
opening rounds of 80 and 77. "I
lost all feel in my hands and
arms," she said.
