# Runners compete at Cal Poly-SLO
## 
### Ed Pike 
The Cal Poly Invitational cross
country race this Saturday will
be a steppingstone for the Cardi
nal in its quest for the Pacific 10
Conference title. Coach Brooks
Johnson said he places the
greatest emphasis on "getting the
fourth and fifth runners back in
the ballgame" to back up the
front-line talent on the men's and
women's teams.
With several top finishers in
each race, the team has been hurt
most by a lack of veterans to pick
up the rest of the load. With just
three upperclassmen, both teams
have great potential but no expe
rienced runners to fill the gaps.
The Cal Poly meet is replacing
the Arizona Invitational as the
tune-up meet for the Pac-lOs at
Stanford Nov. 2. The competi
tion will not be as tough as at the
Stanford Invitational, leaving the
women a good chance to win and
the men plenty of opportunity to
improve on their disappointing
sixth-place finish at the Stanford
Invitational.
There are several runners who
are key figures for the women.
Seniors Carol Gray and Cory
Schubert are coming on strong,
along with junior Kim Stevens.
In addition, freshmen Melanie
Bloch, Mary Mendoza, Wendy
Neely and Jamie Fallon should
continue to improve throughout
the season.
Gray, a track and cross

country All-American, made her
season debut with a 17:42.1 SK,
just seconds away from her All-
America 17:39 in the NCAA
Championship last year.
Schubert is coming back from
injuries and is on her way to a
great year. She has run 17:30 for
the 5K in her last two races and
ran a 16:17.2 on the track as a
freshman. The only senior on the
womens' roster, she will be an
essential part of the women's
season.
The men are led by James Al
borough and the Mastalir broth
ers, Eric and Mark. Alborough, a
junior, cracked the top 100 in last
year's NCAA Championship
meet and is the team leader. The
Mastalirs are both sophomores
from whom much is expected.
Eric ran an 8:07.6 3000 meters at
Jesuit High School in
Sacramento, the second-fastest
high school time ever. Mark has
been the consistent third man on
the team this year.
Steve Schadler, David Rees,
Scott Forest and Bill Crowley
will be counted on to move up
and bridge the gap between the
front-runners and the rest of the
team. Schadler and Forest are
the two seniors on the team,
while Rees is a junior and Bill
Crowley is a sophomore.
There are also a number of
promising freshmen on the
roster. Among them, Jason Mar
tin was sixth at the Meeting of
the Minds.
