# Soccer travels to Berkeley
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer team is
mad.
After being defeated by a less-than
formidable San Jose State squad 2-0
Wednesday, the Cardinal will be
seeking revenge this weekend at the
Golden Bear Soccer Classic in
Berkeley.
The tournament, in its first year,
consists of California, the University of
Pennsylvania, Simon Fraser and Stan
ford. Matches will be held in Cal's
Memorial Stadium.
The Cardinal, which dropped to 7-5-
3 overall, 2-1 in conference play, will
meet Simon Fraser tomorrow at 1 p.m.
Although it does not compete in a diffi
cult conference, Simon Fraser does
boast a 9-3 record and is highly re
garded by opponents.
"Simon Fraser is an excellent

team," Stanford Coach Sam Koch
said. "They will be really tough."
Stanford will battle Pennsylvania
Sunday. The Quakers, 4-2-1 for the
season, are known as a tough squad
with a fighting attitude. Their style of
play is likened to that of San Jose,
making them a formidable opponent for
the inconsistent Cardinal team.
"Penn will be difficult as well,"
Koch said. "We will just have to take
one game at a time."
"We have to watch out. They're not
spectacular, but they're tough,"
midfielder Mike Mossmer said.
In addition to losing the home field
advantage it had for the AT&T/Pacific
West tournament last weekend, the
Cardinal will be playing its matches on
a foreign substance. Stanford will be
competing on Astroturf for the first
time this season.
According to Cardinal players,
Astroturf greatly changes the tempo.

and to a lesser extent, the strategy, of
the game. It is a much faster surface
than grass and requires that soccer
players use more bail-handling skills.
"But attitude is much more impor
tant than the surface," Koch said.
Unfortunately, this weekend injuries
will once again play a role in the Cardi
nal's effectiveness. Stanford's co
captains, Brian Mahaffey and Moss
mer, were both injured for the San Jose
game. Mahaffey was unable to play at
all, and Mossmer saw only limited ac
tion. Both are listed as questionable for
this weekend's matches.
Despite these reservations, the Car
dinal squad feels it has the talent and
desire to be victorious in the Golden
Bear Classic.
"Coming off a loss like this (San
Jose) we have a pretty good chance to
take the tournament," Mossmer said.
"We're going to win this weekend
because we're so upset," midfielder
Pat Sheehy added.
