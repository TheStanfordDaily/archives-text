# Knight Fellow assumes Greek role
## 
### 
This week, a real professional
joins the Daily Greek staff. Bos
ton Globe sportswriter Larry
Whiteside, currently a Knight
Journalism Fellow at Stanford,
gives his expert advice on Satur
day's major college football
games in an attempt to better the
pathetic record compiled by pre
vious guest Greeks.
Last week's guest, the il
lustrious Oski the Bear, went a
mouldy 4-6, although the car
nivorous beast did correctly pick

Oregon's upset of USC. The
furry one did not anticipate his
former school's tie with Arizona,
however.
"Cal can't even lose right," he
sniveled.
Football writer Susan Slusser,
in a magnificant return to last
year's championship form, was
the only Daily staffer to pick
Oregon, as she swept into second
place behind sports editor Matt
Bodman. The rest of the staff is
packed in the middle, except for

sports editor Rob Portnoy, who
is dangerously close to being
passed by the guests.
Whiteside moves up to the
Daily staff this week after 14
years with that lesser paper in
Boston — The Stanford Daily of
the East, as it were. A native
Chicagoan and a graduate of
Drake University in Des Moines,
lowa (yes, they have a football
team; no, it's not Division 1),
Whiteside got his start at The
Drake Times-Delphic — The

Daily of the Midwest (or some
thing like that).
Whiteside, who is on leave
from the Globe while he takes
classes and attends seminars at
Stanford for the year, is auditing
classes such as Labor Law this
fall. Since he's covered three
baseball strikes, a football strike
and basketball strikes, this could
come in handy.
"It's certainly a change of
life," Whiteside said of his year
at Stanford.
