Former U.S. Rep. Pete McCloskey and State As
semblyman John Vasconcellos will head the list of
speakers at a political education conference here
tomorrow on individual initiative in a democracy.
The non-partisan conference, entitled "People,
Power, Politics: How You Can Make a Difference
in the Political Process," aims to reaffirm the politi
cal importance of the individual in American
democracy, according to Sylvia Rogers, co-chair of
the conference planning committee.
"Individuals think that one person can't make a
significant difference politically," Rogers said.
"This seminar is designed to show the many
avenues and actions that one person can take to
change government policy and accomplish worthy
social goals."
The event, the first of its kind at Stanford, will
begin with lectures and panel discussions on elec
toral, legislative and media processes. The keynote
speaker will be Vasconcellos, chair of the Califor
nia Assembly Ways and Means Committee and the
creator of the California Task Force to Promote
Self-Esteem and Social Responsibility.
Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush and As-

semblywoman Jacqueline Speier will appear in a
morning panel discussion on "The Grit and Glory
of Getting Elected," which will be followed by a
discussion of the "Ins and Outs of Enacting Legis
lation."
At 1:15 p.m., McCloskey, who once represented
the 12th Congressional District, will speak on
"Grassroots Action in a Democracy." The final
panel discussion, "Media Magic," will take place
at 1:45 p.m.
The program will be held in Kresge Auditorium.
The rest of the afternoon will be devoted to
various workshops in Crown Quadrangle dealing
with how individuals and groups can enter politics
and effectively influence the political environment.
Workshop topics include "So You Want to Run for
Office," "Opportunities for Volunteers" and
"Questions and Answers for the Press."
"The day has a lot of potential. I'm pleased with
the interest of students so far. I think that's very
important," Rogers said.
Stanford organizations sponsoring the event are
Stanford Action for Nuclear Disarmament and
Physicians for Social Responsibility.
Registration for Saturday's conference begins at
8 a.m. The $10general and $8 student fees include a
box lunch and a wine and cheese reception at the
conclusion of the event.
