# McKeever takes stand Stanford athlete criticizes NCAA drug tests
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Stanford football player Barry McKeever
criticized the scope and method of the NCAA drug
testing program yesterday in Santa Clara County
Superior Court.
McKeever testified before Judge Conrad Rush
ing in the third day of hearings to determine
whether Stanford athletes will win a preliminary in
junction against the NCAA's year-old drug-testing
program.
Also testifying were Dr. Paul Walters, director of
the Cowell Student Health Center, and Women's
Gymnastics Coach Homer Sardina. The witnesses
were called by Robert Van Nest, the attorney
representing plaintiffs McKeever and Jennifer Hill,
a Stanford soccer player.
McKeever described the drug tests he had to un
dergo before the Stanford football team played in
January's Gator Bowl. McKeever testified that he
gave a urine sample under the observation of a
NCAA representative, whom McKeever did not
know and who stood five feet behind the football
player.
"The hardest part is that it's not voluntary,"
McKeever testified "You know that you have to
give 100 milliliters and that the sample could affect
your future. It's difficult when someone says, 'Do
it now and give KX) milliliters.'
Richard Archer, an attorney for the NCAA,
asked McKeever in cross-examination what the
difference was between urinating in a public men's
restroom and urinating before an NCAA official.
McKeever replied that in a public restroom, "the

guy next to you is not there to watch you, but the
only reason the NCAA official is there is to watch
you."
McKeever testified that he had never taken any
performance-enhancing drugs.
Last December, two Stanford football players,
Tony Leiker and John Zentner, were declared in
eligible for the Gator Bowl after testing positive for
anabolic steroids. Responding to reporters during a
recess, McKeever said lie did not know of any
members of the current squad who use steriods.
McKeever also attacked the breadth of the drug
testing. He said that a few weeks before the Gator
Bowl tests, he had had a cold and wanted to use
Sudafed, an over-the-counter medicine. He was
advised by the team trainers not to use the decon
gestant unless it was a "life-or-death" situation,
because Sudafed contains a drug that is on the
NCAA's banned-drug list.
The NCAA has published a list of over 3000
drugs to avoid before testing.
McKeever told Archer that he would have diffi
culty choosing between playing football and signing
the drug-testing consent form. "1 was put in a situa
tion where it was 'sign it or you can't play.' Foot
ball is the most important thing in my life,' 1 said
McKeever, who has one year of college football
eligibility remaining.
Walters, who chairs Stanford's Sports Medicine
Committee, testified that he believed the NCAA
program to be a "one-cylinder" effort designed
only for detection and punishment.
Walters emphasized that Stanford's policy on
