# McKeever takes stand Stanford athlete criticizes NCAA drug tests
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Stanford football player Barry McKeever
criticized the scope and method of the NCAA drug
testing program yesterday in Santa Clara County
Superior Court.
McKeever testified before Judge Conrad Rush
ing in the third day of hearings to determine
whether Stanford athletes will win a preliminary in
junction against the NCAA's year-old drug-testing
program.
Also testifying were Dr. Paul Walters, director of
the Cowell Student Health Center, and Women's
Gymnastics Coach Homer Sardina. The witnesses
were called by Robert Van Nest, the attorney
representing plaintiffs McKeever and Jennifer Hill,
a Stanford soccer player.
McKeever described the drug tests he had to un
dergo before the Stanford football team played in
January's Gator Bowl. McKeever testified that he
gave a urine sample under the observation of a
NCAA representative, whom McKeever did not
know and who stood five feet behind the football
player.
"The hardest part is that it's not voluntary,"
McKeever testified "You know that you have to
give 100 milliliters and that the sample could affect
your future. It's difficult when someone says, 'Do
it now and give KX) milliliters.'
Richard Archer, an attorney for the NCAA,
asked McKeever in cross-examination what the
difference was between urinating in a public men's
restroom and urinating before an NCAA official.
McKeever replied that in a public restroom, "the

guy next to you is not there to watch you, but the
only reason the NCAA official is there is to watch
you."
McKeever testified that he had never taken any
performance-enhancing drugs.
Last December, two Stanford football players,
Tony Leiker and John Zentner, were declared in
eligible for the Gator Bowl after testing positive for
anabolic steroids. Responding to reporters during a
recess, McKeever said lie did not know of any
members of the current squad who use steriods.
McKeever also attacked the breadth of the drug
testing. He said that a few weeks before the Gator
Bowl tests, he had had a cold and wanted to use
Sudafed, an over-the-counter medicine. He was
advised by the team trainers not to use the decon
gestant unless it was a "life-or-death" situation,
because Sudafed contains a drug that is on the
NCAA's banned-drug list.
The NCAA has published a list of over 3000
drugs to avoid before testing.
McKeever told Archer that he would have diffi
culty choosing between playing football and signing
the drug-testing consent form. "1 was put in a situa
tion where it was 'sign it or you can't play.' Foot
ball is the most important thing in my life,' 1 said
McKeever, who has one year of college football
eligibility remaining.
Walters, who chairs Stanford's Sports Medicine
Committee, testified that he believed the NCAA
program to be a "one-cylinder" effort designed
only for detection and punishment.
Walters emphasized that Stanford's policy on
drugs is to educate, counsel and
treat all students, not just student
athletes.
"The majority of students in
this community don't abuse
drugs," Walters told reporters
after his testimony. "We prefer
to locate target problem groups
and use counseling."
Sardina said that the testing
was difficult to apply to gymnasts
because gymnasts usually are not
able to give a urine sample after a
meet due to limited fluid intake.
The gymnasts must therefore
consume large amounts of fluid
after a meet in order to be tested,
which Sardina called "harmful."
The NCAA called its first wit
ness late in the afternoon. Judith
Holland, assistant athletic direc
tor at UCLA, described the drug
testing program there as one

which tests for fewer drugs, of
fers voluntary counseling and al
lows athletes in violation of the
rules to petition for reconsidera
tion before being suspended.
Archer hailed the UCLA pro
gram as the kind of model the
NCAA had hoped to encourage
with its own program. But Susan
Harriman, one of the attorneys
for McKeever and Hill, said she
was elated at the UCLA tes
timony.
"The UCLA program does
everything the NCAA's doesn't.
We were happy they called her,"
said Harriman, who added that
the UCLA program is still not the
best alternative.
Harriman said the students had
closed their case. Jennifer Hill
will not testify, according to Har
riman, because she did not un
dergo testing herself.
Harriman said she expected
few surprises to emerge from

remaining testimony, adding that
she had filed an additional brief
in response to a criticism that
arose from Archer's opening
statement Tuesday.
Archer's statement had ques
tioned the applicability of the
California constitution's right to
privacy clause when Stanford
athletes compete out of state.
Judge Rushing acknowledged the
gray area, noting, "That's a
tricky area of the law."
Harriman said the brief
responded adequately to the
challenge. "A court order clearly
is effective outside the state in
this case because both parties are
residents of California," she
said.
Scheduled to testify tomorrow
and Monday for the NCAA are
Dr. Robert Voyd of the United
States Olympic Committee and
Ruth Burkee, assistant executive
director of the NCAA.
