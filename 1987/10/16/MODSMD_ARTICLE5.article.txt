Stanford is still the top under
graduate institution in the United
States, according to a U.S. News
& World Report survey released
yesterday.
The results of a survey of col
lege presidents conducted by the
magazine showed Stanford
edging out Harvard by one
percentage point. Yale, Prince
ton, UC-Berkeley, Dartmouth,
Duke, the University of Chicago,
the University of Michigan at
Ann Arbor and Brown finished
out the top ten.
Stanford has finished first in
each of three polls the magazine
has conducted since it began the
college survey in 1983.
The survey asked 1329 univer
sity presidents to name the top 10
undergraduate schools in the

country based on "quality of
teaching, cohesiveness of curric
ulum, relationships between fac
ulty and students and the atmos
phere of learning fostered by the
campus," according to Paul
Vizza, editorial publicity coordi
nator for U.S. News & World
Report.
A school's rating is computed
based on the percentage of presi
dents who ranked it among the
top 10. The presidents were not
asked to rank schools in specific
order. Sixty-five percent of the
responding presidents selected
Stanford.
Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions Jean Fetter said that
some controversy still remains
over the legitimacy of the poll be
cause it involves "highly subjec
tive appraisals."
"It's difficult to sort out all of

the effects, but it certainly does
not hurt," she said.
In a similar vein, Stanford Vice
President for Development
Henry Riggs noted that "we
don't pay a great deal of attention
to 'beauty contests,' but any fa
vorable publicity tends to help
us."
Vizza said the purpose of the
survey was to provide "the most
objective information we can on
higher education in America."
Keith Light, a Stanford
graduate and former admissions
officer who now works for the
admissions office at Harvard,
said that "within the university
(Harvard) we don't take it too
seriously." But he added that the
poll could influence potential stu
dents. "I think it does make a dif
ference. Students take notice of
articles like these," he said.
