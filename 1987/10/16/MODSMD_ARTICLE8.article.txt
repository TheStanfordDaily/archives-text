Iranian missile harms ship in Gulf
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — In its first successful
missile strike on Kuwaiti territory, Iran yesterday blasted a 10-
by- 13-foot hole in a U.S.-owned supertanker anchored off
Kuwait's main oil port, setting the ship ablaze within sight of
lour other tankers that had arrived Tuesday under U.S. Navy
escort.
U.S. officials in the region and in Washington said they
believed the Iranian missile was a Chinese-made Silkworm fired
from Iranian-controlled territory on Iraq's Faw Peninsula, about
50 miles to the north.
Kuwait immediately protested the attack to the United Na
tions. A Kuwaiti Defense Ministry statement said, "Kuwait
holds Iran responsible for this act/'
The missile attack presented the Reagan administration with a
new threat of escalation in the Persian Gulf, where U.S. forces
last month took military action against Iran when a mine-laying
vessel threatened another anchorage in the central gulf used by
U.S. flag oil tankers and warships.
In addition, the missile struck a few miles from where the
U.S. Navy was preparing to moor a second ocean-going barge
rigged and armed as an offshore U.S. "fort" near Kuwait,
which has not granted U.S. basing facilites for aircraft or war
ships engaged in the protection of Kuwaiti shipping.
Three other long-range missiles, two of them identified as
Silkworms, were fired at Kuwaiti territory last month, one of
them landing harmlessly on a beach near an oil refinery complex
in the same area where Thursday's missile struck.
Contra leaders will lobby Ortega
WASHINGTON — Nicaragua's contra political leadership,
executing a surprise public relations stroke in the war against
that nation's socialist regime, said yesterday three of its mem
bers will fly to Managua soon in an attempt to force Sandinista
President Daniel Ortega to talk directly with them about a cease
fire.
The dramatic visit will take place before the Nov. 7 deadline
for a halt to the region's guerrilla wars stipulated in a peace ac
cord signed in August by Nicaragua and its four Central Ameri
can neighbors. At least three U.S. congressmen will accompany
the contra leaders as observers, the rebels' six-member political
directorate said at a news conference in the Capitol.
Contra leader Alfonso Robelo, one of the directorate mem
bers who will make the journey, said that by traveling to
Managua, contra leaders are not accepting Ortega's offer of am
nesty for rebels who return to Nicaragua or signaling any change
in the war.
He did say that the rebels would consider calling a short truce
in the war inside Nicaragua during the Managua visit.
The eontras' overture shifts the focus of the Central American
peace debate from the rebels to Ortega, who repeatedly has
rejected face-to-face meetings with the rebels, despite public
pressure to do so from the originator of the plan, Costa Rica
President Oscar Arias Sanchez, and other Central American po
litical figures.
Howard Beach victim takes stand
NEW YORK — A victim of a racial attack in Howard Beach
in the Queens section of New York, testified yesterday that he
brandished a knife after being taunted by a group of white teen
agers armed with sticks, a bat and an iron pipe, and said that he
was struck in the back by a stick as he fled his pursuers.
Testifying as an important prosecution witness in the murder
and manslaughter trial of four white teen-agers, Timothy
Grimes, 19, said that one of his attackers pounded the ground
threateningly with the bat while other members of the group
shouted racial epithets.
Grimes managed to outrun his attackers, but his two com
panions were less fortunate. Prosecutors charge that the youths
chased Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old black man, into traffic
where he was killed on a busy highway and also seriously beat
Cedric Sandiford, 36, as he pleaded for mercy. Sandiford is ex
pected to testify later in the trial.
Grimes, who admitted on the witness stand he had an arrest
record on robbery, assault and drug charges, demonstrated how
he held the knife in front of him when he faced his attackers.
The junior high school dropout had told the grand jury investi
gating the Howard Beach case that he was unarmed, but later
changed his story in interviews with prosecutors.
Defense lawyers say the fact that Grimes pulled a knife indi
cated their clients were not instigators of the confrontation.
Under questioning by special New York state prosecutor
Charles Hynes, Grimes said that he first faced his attackers
when he and two companions emerged from a pizzeria late in
the evening of Dec 19. Grimes said that he was met by "three
guys with things in their hands." He said one of the whites
pounded a bat into the ground twice and shouted to the others,
"Hit the niggers."
Balanced budget fight is imminent
WASHING TON —T he Democratic-controlled Congress and
the White House yesterday began hurtling toward a collision
over the federal budget that some lawmakers predict could ulti
mately yield "deep and crippling" spending cuts in programs al
ready hobbled during the Reagan era.
Beginning a five-week countdown required by the nation's
new balanced-budget law, the Congressional Budget Office
I hursday detailed how spending on everything from student
loans to AIDS research will be indiscriminately slashed next
month if Congress and the Reagan administration cannot find
other means of reducing the federal deficit.
The CBO report on the likely impact of $23 billion in across
the-board spending cuts begins what promises to be the final act
in the budget-and-tax stalemate that has preoccupied the execu
tive and legislative branches for more than 10 months, an act
that may spell defeat for the Democratic strategy of forcing
Reagan to accept a tax increase.
Under the revised Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law
signed by President Reagan last month, agencies will begin to
feel the first pinch of the automatic cuts next week when the ad
ministration's budget office issues its version of Thursday's
CBO report. Spending would be frozen at the levels mandated
by the Office of Management and Budget beginning Tuesday
and would become final Nov. 20 when OMB files an updated es
timate.
I he $23 billion cut would be apportioned 50-50 between
defense and domestic spending programs, but because of ex
emptions and special rules only 20 percent of the federal budget
is at risk. In most cases, spending would still exceed last year's
levels because the base from which the reductions are made is
calculated from 1987 appropriation levels plus 4.2 percent infla
tion and the cost of salary increases.

escort.
U.S. officials in the region and in Washington said they
believed the Iranian missile was a Chinese-made Silkworm fired
from Iranian-controlled territory on Iraq's Faw Peninsula, about
50 miles to the north.
Kuwait immediately protested the attack to the United Na
tions. A Kuwaiti Defense Ministry statement said, "Kuwait
holds Iran responsible for this act/'
The missile attack presented the Reagan administration with a
new threat of escalation in the Persian Gulf, where U.S. forces
last month took military action against Iran when a mine-laying
vessel threatened another anchorage in the central gulf used by
U.S. flag oil tankers and warships.
In addition, the missile struck a few miles from where the
U.S. Navy was preparing to moor a second ocean-going barge
rigged and armed as an offshore U.S. "fort" near Kuwait,
which has not granted U.S. basing facilites for aircraft or war
ships engaged in the protection of Kuwaiti shipping.
Three other long-range missiles, two of them identified as
Silkworms, were fired at Kuwaiti territory last month, one of
them landing harmlessly on a beach near an oil refinery complex
in the same area where Thursday's missile struck.
Contra leaders will lobby Ortega
WASHINGTON — Nicaragua's contra political leadership,
executing a surprise public relations stroke in the war against
that nation's socialist regime, said yesterday three of its mem
bers will fly to Managua soon in an attempt to force Sandinista
President Daniel Ortega to talk directly with them about a cease
fire.
The dramatic visit will take place before the Nov. 7 deadline
for a halt to the region's guerrilla wars stipulated in a peace ac
cord signed in August by Nicaragua and its four Central Ameri
can neighbors. At least three U.S. congressmen will accompany
the contra leaders as observers, the rebels' six-member political
directorate said at a news conference in the Capitol.
Contra leader Alfonso Robelo, one of the directorate mem
bers who will make the journey, said that by traveling to
Managua, contra leaders are not accepting Ortega's offer of am
nesty for rebels who return to Nicaragua or signaling any change
in the war.
He did say that the rebels would consider calling a short truce
in the war inside Nicaragua during the Managua visit.
The eontras' overture shifts the focus of the Central American
peace debate from the rebels to Ortega, who repeatedly has
rejected face-to-face meetings with the rebels, despite public
pressure to do so from the originator of the plan, Costa Rica
President Oscar Arias Sanchez, and other Central American po
litical figures.
Howard Beach victim takes stand
NEW YORK — A victim of a racial attack in Howard Beach
in the Queens section of New York, testified yesterday that he
brandished a knife after being taunted by a group of white teen
agers armed with sticks, a bat and an iron pipe, and said that he
was struck in the back by a stick as he fled his pursuers.
Testifying as an important prosecution witness in the murder
and manslaughter trial of four white teen-agers, Timothy
Grimes, 19, said that one of his attackers pounded the ground
threateningly with the bat while other members of the group
shouted racial epithets.
Grimes managed to outrun his attackers, but his two com
panions were less fortunate. Prosecutors charge that the youths
chased Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old black man, into traffic
where he was killed on a busy highway and also seriously beat
Cedric Sandiford, 36, as he pleaded for mercy. Sandiford is ex
pected to testify later in the trial.
Grimes, who admitted on the witness stand he had an arrest
record on robbery, assault and drug charges, demonstrated how
he held the knife in front of him when he faced his attackers.
The junior high school dropout had told the grand jury investi
gating the Howard Beach case that he was unarmed, but later
changed his story in interviews with prosecutors.
Defense lawyers say the fact that Grimes pulled a knife indi
cated their clients were not instigators of the confrontation.
Under questioning by special New York state prosecutor
Charles Hynes, Grimes said that he first faced his attackers
when he and two companions emerged from a pizzeria late in
the evening of Dec 19. Grimes said that he was met by "three
guys with things in their hands." He said one of the whites
pounded a bat into the ground twice and shouted to the others,
"Hit the niggers."
Balanced budget fight is imminent
WASHING TON —T he Democratic-controlled Congress and
the White House yesterday began hurtling toward a collision
over the federal budget that some lawmakers predict could ulti
mately yield "deep and crippling" spending cuts in programs al
ready hobbled during the Reagan era.
Beginning a five-week countdown required by the nation's
new balanced-budget law, the Congressional Budget Office
I hursday detailed how spending on everything from student
loans to AIDS research will be indiscriminately slashed next
month if Congress and the Reagan administration cannot find
other means of reducing the federal deficit.
The CBO report on the likely impact of $23 billion in across
the-board spending cuts begins what promises to be the final act
in the budget-and-tax stalemate that has preoccupied the execu
tive and legislative branches for more than 10 months, an act
that may spell defeat for the Democratic strategy of forcing
Reagan to accept a tax increase.
Under the revised Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law
signed by President Reagan last month, agencies will begin to
feel the first pinch of the automatic cuts next week when the ad
ministration's budget office issues its version of Thursday's
CBO report. Spending would be frozen at the levels mandated
by the Office of Management and Budget beginning Tuesday
and would become final Nov. 20 when OMB files an updated es
timate.
I he $23 billion cut would be apportioned 50-50 between
defense and domestic spending programs, but because of ex
emptions and special rules only 20 percent of the federal budget
is at risk. In most cases, spending would still exceed last year's
levels because the base from which the reductions are made is
calculated from 1987 appropriation levels plus 4.2 percent infla
tion and the cost of salary increases.

Iranian missile harms ship in Gulf
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — In its first successful
missile strike on Kuwaiti territory, Iran yesterday blasted a 10-
