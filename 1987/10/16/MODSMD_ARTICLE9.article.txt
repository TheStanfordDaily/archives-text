# Stocks plummet for second day
## 
### 
Stock sellers overwhelmed
buyers in the final hour of trading
yesterday after a see-saw
struggle that eventually drove the
Dow Jones industrial average
down 57.61 points on near-record
volume.
The Dow closed at 2355.09,
bringing the average's two-day
loss to 153.07 points, or 6.1 per
cent. The Dow lost 95.46 points
Wednesday, the largest one-day
point drop in history, as trade
deficit and interest rate worries
swamped the market.
At the close of trading yester
day, 263 million shares had
changed hands on the New York
Stock Exchange. It was the
fourth-busiest session on record.
Declining issues outnumbered
advances by nearly 5 to I.
From its Aug. 25 high of
2722.42, the Dow has now fallen
367.33 points, or 13.5 percent. It
is the biggest market correction
since 1984.
The Dow opened 15 points
lower on selling by foreign inves
tors but then moved higher,
gaining 15 points by 12:30 p.m.
After moving up and down most
of the afternoon, the average

took a sharp downward turn be
tween 3:30 p.m. and 4 p.m. and
closed down 57.61 points.
"All of a sudden, they just
pulled the rug out from under the
market," said Charles Comer,
market analyst for Moseley Se
curities.
Comer questioned whether the
five-year-old bull market was still
intact. The market's recent
declines, he said, "represent the
strongest challenge yet to the
overall viability of the bull mar
ket," and he said that it would
take "extensive work" to restore
stock prices to their earlier
levels.
The stock and bond markets,
meanwhile, appeared to shake
off the move by Chemical Bank
of New York to raise its prime
rate to 9.75 percent from 9.25
percent. Chemical's move was
not immediately followed by any
other bank.
The prime is the rate charged
to a bank's best corporate cus
tomers and is used as a bench
mark for the setting of rates on a
variety of corporate and con
sumer loans.
