If your answer is Ghost Busters, we want to wish you all
the best and have a nice day If you answered "TRW",
here's the rest of the story.
The U.S. Air Force asked us to build a ground based
electro optical surveillance system that could identify
an object the size of a soccer ball from 22,300 miles in
space. We did it, utilizing 3 telescopes and a large com
puter system. Then they asked us to build four more.
Quite an achievement, but it's just one example of
TRW's impact on the future.
TRW offers you the freedom to move among a wide
variety of opportunities in microelectronics, high
energy lasers, large software systems, communica
tions, and scientific spacecraft. If you're majoring in
engineering, computer science, math, or physics, and
want to be with a company that's driving technology
into the next century, it's not too soon to talk. Tomor
