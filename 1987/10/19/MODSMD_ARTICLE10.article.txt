# Palestinians snub Shultz overture
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — A small group of Pales
tinians, carefully selected by the U.S. gov
ernment for their moderate views, refused to
meet with Secretary of State George Shultz
yesterday, a snub that Shultz blamed on in
timidation by "enemies of peace" in the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
"I think they have missed something by
not taking part in an invitation to a dialogue,"
Shultz told a press conference. "As I under
stand it, a number of them were threatened.
That only reminds us that peace has
enemies."
Earlier in the day, in remarks interpreted
as a rebuke to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, Shultz warned that "no one helps the
chances for peace by doing nothing."
Shamir, who opposes suggestions for an in
ternational peace conference on the Middle
East, is known to believe that time is on Is

rael's side, so the Jerusalem government can
afford to wait for its Arab neighbors to meet
its conditions for a settlement of the Arab-
Israeli conflict.
"Each day must bring a commitment to
seize opportunities which present them
selves," Shultz said after receiving an
honorary degree from the Weizmann Insti
tute of Science near Tel Aviv. "We know
that no one — not the United States, not Is
rael, not the Arabs — improves the chances
for peace by doing nothing at all."
At his press conference later in the day,
Shultz was asked specifically if he had di
rected his remarks at Shamir. The secretary
of state diplomatically responded, "I was just
exhorting myself and everyone else to keep
working at it."
Nevertheless, the comments seemed to be
a tailored response to Shamir, who has told

associates that the current Arab-Israeli con
flict should be read in terms of millenniums of
Jewish history. In the long view, he has said,
things are improving steadily, so this is no
time for Israel to make concessions.
During his visit to Israel which began
Friday, Shultz met separately with Shamir
and his chief political rival. Foreign Minister
Shimon Feres, to discuss ways of reviving the
stalled peace process. Peres maintains that
Israel should be willing to attend an interna
tional conference to set the stage for direct
negotiations with Jordan, while Shamir
opposes that plan.
King Hussein of Jordan has said that he
will negotiate with Israel only in the context
of such a conference. Shultz flies to London
today to confer with Hussein.
