# Nobel laureate gives chem lecture
## 
### Thomas Vajda 
A 1987 Nobel Prize winner
in chemistry gave a talk on
"chemistry beyond the
molecule at an organic
chemistry symposium here
Saturday.
Jean-Marie Pierre Lehn
closed the second annual
William S. Johnson Sympo
sium with a lecture on
supramolecular chemistry —
the area of research that
earned him the coveted award
Tuesday.
Lehn, a Frenchman, shared
the award with two Ameri
cans, Donald Cram of UCLA
and Charles Pederson, for
merly a chemist with E. I. du
Pont de Nemours & Co.
Addressing about 300
people in a crowded Braun
Auditorium, Lehn delivered a
highly technical lecture titled
"Supramolecular Chemistry
— Scope and Perspectives."
According to Tuesday's
Nobel announcement by the
Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences, Lehn, Pederson and
Cram have laid the founda
tions of one of the most active
and expanding fields of chemi
cal research.
The academy said the award
was given for the scientists'
work in the development and
use of molecules that can
"recognize each other and
choose with which other
molecules they will form com
plexes."

The New York Times re
ported last week that Lehn, a
professor at the lnstitut de
Chimie at the Universite Louis
Pasteur de Strasbourg, is crea
tive in confronting problems
and inpires his colleagues with
his imaginative and compelling
ideas.
At 48, Lehn is relatively
young for so distinguished an
honor. Lindi Bauman, one of
the symposium's organizers,
noted that "there is consider
able astonishment and delight
that a man so young has won
[the Nobel Prize]."
Lehn reportedly said he was
"surprised, but very pleased"
to have received the award.
The symposium, named for
Chemistry Prof. Emeritus
William Johnson, sought to
bring together distinguished
chemists from universities and
private industry.
The primary purpose of the
symposium, according to
Chemistry Prof. Paul Wender,
was to discuss and examine
some of the many aspects and
phases of organic chemistry.
Wender, a co-organizer of
the event, called it "a spectac
ular success," rated by the
speakers and those in atten
dence as one of the best such
programs they have attended.
Bauman added that the sym
posium and the people it at
tracted were "a tribute to
William Johnson, who started
the organic chemistry depart
ment here."
