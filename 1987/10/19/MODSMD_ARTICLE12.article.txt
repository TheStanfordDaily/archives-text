In a sometimes shocking
presentation, Pulitzer Prize
winning black poet and author
Gwendolyn Brooks shared her
work and experiences with a
large audience last night at Bran
ner Hall.
Earlier in the day, Brooks led a
smaller poetry workshop, offer
ing criticism and suggestions to
young authors.
Brooks spoke here as the first
lecturer in the "Poetry, Prose
and Politics" series. The
presentation was sponsored by
the ASSU Speakers Bureau and
the Afro-American Studies De
partment.
"I am going to speak about
love, light, loss, liberty, lunacy
and laceration," Brooks said as
she introduced her poetry at the
evening presentation.
The 70-year-old author and
poet read a small sample of her
work covering such diverse top
ics as romantic love, suicide,
abortion, art and black identity.
Addressing apartheid in South
Africa, Brooks read a poem titled
"Near Johannesburg Boy." In
conclusion, she explained.
"there is no punctuation at the
end, because there is no punctua
tion to the situation as of yet."
Brooks also read "The Life of
Lincoln West," which she called
an "identity poem" about a
black child rejected by its parents
and society. She prefaced the
poem by explaining that the title
character was a black child.
"This little boy had a plump
little nose and lips," she
said."He was no Michael Jack
son. Those things do not make
you a popular person in this soci
ety."

The author of 14 volumes of
poetry, a novel and two an
thologies of her work. Brooks
was very informal with her audi
ence, often pausing to give them
advice.
Before reading "To the Young
Who Want to Die," she said.
"There are nourishments and ex
hilarations in this world. I want
to tell you to have patience.
Everything nets better with

time." She then read: "You do
not have to die this certain
day. . . . Death will wait."
At a poetry workshop she gave
yesterday afternoon. Brooks
advised 30 to 40 budding poets in
the Ujamaa House lounge to be
honest when writing.
"Tell w//r truth. Don't sugar it
up; don't make it nice or proper
or normal or smooth or even
edged because life is not nice or

proper or normal or smooth or
even-edged," she said. "Don't
try to imitate what other poets
have said. You are just as impor
tant as they are."
Brooks told her listeners to
have faith in themselves. "Don't
be afraid if you write something
unlike anything you've seen
before," she said. "You may
have just invented something
new."
