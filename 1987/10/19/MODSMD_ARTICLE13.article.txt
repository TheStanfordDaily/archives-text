Presumably, the University doesn't go out of
its way to schedule on-campus construction
projects in such a way as to inconvenience stu
dents as much as possible.
It just seems that way sometimes.
Over the last few years there has been at least
one large repair or construction project launched
every fall, either just before or just after students
arrive on campus for the fall quarter. Witness
the repair of Santa Teresa Street two years ago
and the landscaping project between Larkin
House and Sweet Hall last fall. This year, it's the
renovation of the Math Corner courtyard.
Certainly, it's nice to see the University ex
panding its facilities and improving existing
ones. And the work being done in the Math Cor
ner doesn't pose a really severe hardship to stu
dents or faculty. But much more disconcerting
than any inconvenience the work may or may
not cause is the misplacement of priorities il
lustrated by the timing of the work.
The University could have scheduled the con
struction during the summer, at the risk of incon
veniencing the small number of students on
campus for summer quarter and the larger num
ber of non-students who flock here for summer

conferences. Instead, the University, at the be
hest of the Conference Office, chose to schedule
the project for the interim period between sum
mer and fall quarters, at the risk of having the
work spill over into the academic year and im
pact regular students, as it has.
At an institution whose primary mission os
tensibly is to educate young men and women
year-round, and not to host various cheerleaders
and corporate executives and who are here for
three months out of the year, that kind of con
struction agenda is wrongheaded.
Many of the projects launched in the fall, it
seems, could quite easily be shifted to the sum
mer, when they would have a smaller impact on
the student population that is supposedly the
focus of Stanford's existence. The school's
Facilities Project Management Office should be
able to work more closely with the Conference
Office to arrange scheduling and room assign
ments for conferences so that summer conferees
are disrupted as little as possible.
Such a change in scheduling and prioritization
of work is a small favor to ask, but it would
markedly improve the quality and ease of life on
campus.
