# In search of a real, old- fashioned barber shop
## 
### 
You don't see too many barber shops
around these days, and I think that's a
shame. Back in the small town where I
live in New York, we have a real barber
shop. Although the traditional rotating
red-and-white-striped pole was removed
years ago, the floor is still checkered
with green and white tiles, and the bar
ber, Tony, knows all of his customers
personally.

Tony is a no-frills barber. You walk
in, take your seat, and Tony cuts your
hair the way he knows you like it. You
then pay a no-frills price and go about
your business, satisfied that your hair
will be fine for another four weeks. That
is the way haircuts should be.
Unfortunately, Tony and his barber
shop are now 3000 miles away, and so
last week I had to go elsewhere to get my
haircut. I won't identify the place where
I ended up, but I will say that they
loudly, boldly and often proclaim that

they are the "BEST HAIRCUT IN THE
BAY AREA." How exactly they a
chieved this distinction was not re
vealed, but in any case, I doubt it.
My ordeal started when a youngish
looking girl who we'll call Sue led me to
the chair. No sooner had I sat down
when she stared at me disapprovingly
and demanded, "How long has it been
since your last haircut?" This is a point
that hairdressers often catch me on,
being that I'm terrified of anyone who
has hair that looks more complicated
than my CS 110 textbook, and who also
has an intention to cut my hair.
Making a mental resolution that I
would not be pushed around by this girl
Sue, even if she was a haircutting
goddess, I looked her straight in the
eyes. "Oh, let's see, that would be four
weeks ago Tuesday," I lied, trying hard
to sound as if 1 was completely confident
about the whole thing.
"Urn hmm," she nodded, obviously
not fooled.
Determined to do better on the next
question, and knowing that it would be
the inevitable. "How do you like it
cut?" I took the initiative. "I like my
hair about the way it is now, just
shorter," I declared, and the thrill of vic
tory spread warmly throughout my
body. Alas, my victory turned out to be
short-lived. As those of you who have

had the Bay Area's Best Haircut before
undoubtedly know, their trained profes
sionals will not accept such imprecise
descriptions. In my case. Sue wanted to
talk inches.
Since she didn't know how to con
tinue interrogating me. Sue began the
cutting process by spraying so much
water into my hair that trickles of it
began to flow down my neck and into my
shirt. It was at this point that I vowed to
return with one of those Uzi-style fully
automatic machine gun water pistols and
really let her have it. No one is going to
soak me and get away with it.
As my dreams began to escalate
toward bigger and bigger water balloons,
Sue started cutting. After just a few
tentative snips, she stopped, looked at
me accusingly and sniffed, "You just
had your hair cut by a barber, didn't
you?" I could only stare at her in as
tonishment. "Yes, I can tell. You see,
barbers use different methods than we
do." From her tone, it was obvious that
she meant, "Barbers do it wrong."
As if this wasn't enough, she went on
to explain that while barbers only had
500 hours of training, hairdressers like
herself had 1600. Now I'm not a man
who changes his mind all that easily, but
I began to think: if studying God, Self,
and World is worth five units, and Sue
has the equivalent of 55 units in the art of

haircutting, maybe she really is an ex
pert haircutter. 1 thought that maybe I
had stumbled onto a higher truth in hair
cuts, and that soon, in just half an hour,
my hair would be transformed into a
glorious work of art that would look bet
ter than 1 had ever hoped possible.
Sue quickly wiped this notion from my
mind, however, when she matter-of
factly informed me that it was physically
impossible to cut my hair the way I
wanted it. Either my scalp curvature
was all wrong, or my hair wasn't the
right type, or . . . whatever it was, all I
knew was that old Tony had accom
plished the impossible with no problem
every month for the past 10 years.
The next 15 minutes weren't pretty.
The scissors snapped constantly, and
Sue brushed my hair back and forth so
often, and held it at such ridiculous
angles, that there was no way to tell
what it would look like when she was fi
nally done. Numerous times 1 was afraid
that she hadn't understood what I
wanted, but, like the guy who's baffled
by the calculus lecture because he's five
weeks behind, I was too afraid to speak
up.
When she stopped cutting, my hair
looked awful. Noting the expression on
my face, she told me not to worry â€” she
wasn't done yet. But instead of resuming
with the scissors, she dispensed gobs

and gobs of that mousse stuff onto her
hand and then proceeded to pound it all
into my scalp. Having thus changed my
hair to the consistency of a wire hanger,
she was then able to mold it into a
resemblance of what I had wanted in the
first place.
This was little consolation to me,
though; 1 certainly wouldn't be able to
duplicate that molding process the next
morning. And besides, having already
lived 19 happy years without mousse in
my hair, 1 saw no need to make my
morning routine any more complicated
than it was. There's only 15 precious
minutes between the time my alarm goes
off and the time lecture begins, and as it
is I often miss my shave. Idiotic as
Nancy Reagan may be, in this case I
have to agree that you really should just
say no to hair drugs. I explained all this
to Sue, but she just couldn't understand
why any human would want to spend
less than two hours a day working on his
hair.
Sue and 1 parted then, but the memory
will long be with me. At least as long as
eight weeks, when I can go home and get
a real haircut. Until then, I can only
dream and hope that one day the barber
shops will return.
