Disappointed
with attitudes
As IFC vice-president and
chairman of the Committee on
Minority Relations, I was very
disappointed with the Daily edi
torial on Oct. 14. The attitude of
the editorial was degrading:
"sunrise" at seeing the Interfra
ternity Council trying to rectify
internal problems; implications

that "alcohol abuse," "sexism"
and "other evils are largely in
herent in the fraternity system;"
and skepticism toward the coun
cil's ability to make corrections.
It is exactly this kind of attitude
and stereotyping that fraternities
are trying to combat, and
editorials like yours only
strengthen them and make our
job harder.
Probably the most disturbing
aspect of your article is its inac
curacy. As committee chairman.

I was very surprised to find this
editorial discussing the affairs of
my committee without me having
had the opportunity to talk with
anyone on the Daily staff. The
editorial states that the Commit
tee on Minority Relations (not
"minority under-represen
tation") will do a "simple in
house investigation," and it
recommends that the committee
"work closely with the newly
created University Committee on
Minority Affairs." The fact is

that for the past two weeks 1
have been working with Joey
Thomas, who is a member of the
University committee, as well as
with Carol Demattei, the Inter
sorority Council President.
The committee will not be
doing an in-house investigation.
Our goal is not to count the num
ber of blacks, Hispanics, Asians
and other minority groups pres
ent in fraternities. Our goal is to
improve relations with minority
groups, letting them know that

we are concerned about their
demands (e.g.. Rainbow Agenda)
and their well-being. We also
want them to realize that fraterni
ties welcome all students and
that fraternities do not take away
people's individuality nor force
them to lose their ethnicity. This
IFC committee plans to have re
ceptions and mixers with mi
nority groups, as well as discus
sions, forums, programs and par
ties beginning this quarter and
continuing throughout the year.

This will be an active, rather
than a passive, committee, and
our goal is for the fraternities and
sororities to better understand
minority groups and their con
cerns, and for minority groups to
better understand the Greek sys
tem and the benefits it has to of
fer. I believe that the best rem
edy for eliminating stereotypes
and ignorance is bringing people
together.
