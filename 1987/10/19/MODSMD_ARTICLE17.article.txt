## Maintain intellectual depth, diversity 
### 
Although the issue has already been sub
jected to one major task force and much
heated student debate, it appears that the
problem of a lack of recognition of "non-
Western" cultures in the required Stanford
curriculum has not been satisfactorily solved.
While I laud those students who have com
mitted themselves to correcting this problem,
I feel the proposed solution is entirely the
wrong approach.

There is a need in undergraduate education
to study a complete progression of ideas.
Since American culture owes much to the
Western intellectual heritage, and since this
heritage is the one closest to the majority of
the students, Western Culture is the most
logical choice of intellectual heritages to
study.
Given that the Western Culture planners
are not overtly bigoted in the selection proc
ess, this selection criterion is precisely what
has been used for the present Western Cul
ture program. Yet we see a glaring lack of any
authors who are not white males, or even of
any authors who are not white male aris
tocrats. This does not conflict with the goal of
Western Culture, which is to give students
exposure to the development of ideas. A

problem arises from the naive assumption
that is so often derived from this
homogeneity of authors, namely that white
aristocratic males are the only ones capable
of producing intellectual works of any value.
Another misunderstanding could arise
from the assumption that since Western Cul
ture is the only culture studied in depth, it is
somehow "superior" to other cultures. The
economic and military superiority of Western
nations might be used as further "evidence"
for this by those fostering the opinion that
one culture may be "superior" to another.
I agree that there is a problem here. It is a
terrible thought that a person could complete
a bachelor's degree at Stanford while still
believing (through lack of contact, not
through personal evaluation) that the West
ern nations, and in particular the men of
Western nations, are the only people with an
intellectual development. The solution,
however, lies not in changing the Western
Culture program. Scrambling to include some
works written by women and minorities who
have contributed to the development of
Western Culture will not prevent people from
reaching a conclusion of white, male, aris
tocratic intellectual supremacy.
The real change must come, I believe, in
the non-Western distribution requirement.
This must be expanded to be more rigorous,
maybe constituting an area in itself rather
than being a mere appendage of another dis
tribution area. It is vital to study other

cultures, not only to dispel stereotypes over
"superiority," hut also in order to under
stand our own culture even better.
Losing part of the current studies in West
ern Culture in order to study other influences
is a "robbing Peter to pay Paul" mentality
that will only hinder the understanding and
development of the student. Western Culture
requires a full year to complete even a survey

course of the development of that heritage.
We need in addition to it a more thorough
study of other cultures, so we may step out of
the Western heritage to see others and our
selves more clearly.
It is the intellectual depth and diversity at
Stanford that I think we all should be fighting
to maintain or improve.
