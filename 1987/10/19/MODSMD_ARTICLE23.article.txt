A larger than life statue of
Leland Stanford's family may
soon be relocated to Memorial
Court, according to Art Prof.
Nathan Oliveira, chairman of the
University's Panel on Outdoor
Art.

The bronze statue displays
Leland and Leland Jr. standing
and gazing into the distance
while Jane kneels at their feet. It
is currently housed in Ryan Lab
oratories, where it is undergoing
restoration and cleaning.
The statue was commissioned
by Jane Stanford in Florence in
1890 from Larkin Mead, "a dis
tinguished artist of the time," ac
cording to Oliveira.
Originally placed in the center
of Memorial Court, it was
removed to the Stanford
Museum in 1915. In 1967 the
statue was installed on the porch
of the Stanford art gallery, but it
was removed after it was van
dalized in 1978.
The most likely placement for
the statue will be on the western
side of Memorial Court facing
east, according to Oliveira and
University Planner Phil Wil

liams. Asked whether the Stan
ford statue would detract from
the two Rodin sculptures cur
rently in Memorial Court,
Oliveira said there is a "stylistic
compatibility" among the statues
that would allow the Stanford
statue to fit in well. Oliveira cau
tioned, however, that the piece
"should not be looked at as a
Rodin, but as an emotional
portrayal of the founders of the
University."
Oliveira said the site chosen
for the statue should be close to
the "emotional focal point of the
University" because of its con
nection with the Stanford family.
He said other possible place
ments for the statue included the
center of Memorial Court, the
Oval, beside Memorial Church,
and one of the six planted oases
in the Inner Quad.
Because of the statue's original
placement in the center of
Memorial Court, some —
notably Art Prof. Albert Elsen —
have advocated returning the
statue there. Positioning of the
statue to the side of the Court is
"a bad idea," he said.
The Stanford Historical Soci
ety, however, said it favors the
side location for the statue in or
der to preserve the view through
the Inner Quad to Memorial
Church. According to a state
ment from the Society,
"aesthetic and practical reasons
dictate" placing the statue to the
side.
The view to Memorial Church
was specifically incorporated
into the original plan for the Uni
versity by its architect, Frederick
Law Olmsted.

After Jane Stanford's death in
1905, the University trustees had
the statue quietly removed under
the cover of a rainy Saturday
morning. They said the statue
was suffering under the elements
and had to be removed to an in
door location in order to allow
for its preservation.
Students immediately an
nounced a petition drive to return
the statue to its former central
position in Memorial Court.
According to Karen Bar
tholomew, editor of the Stanford
Observer and co-editor of the
Stanford Historical Society bul
letin, the trustees may have used
the excuse of decay as a "kind of
smokescreen" to restore the
original view to Memorial
Church.
In addition to the statue of the
Stanford family, a second statue
bought by Jane Stanford for
merly adorned the center of the
Oval.
The 12-foot rendition of Faith',
bought by Mrs. Stanford, was
placed atop an 18-foot concrete
column. This was described in
the Daily Palo Alto of Jan. 15,
1915 as "promptly destroying
whatever artistic value the statue
ever possessed." The statue has
since disappeared.
Oliveira cautioned that some
sites being considered, such as
the Oval, would present a secu
rity risk to the statue. "I can
imagine what the UC (Berkeley)
guys would do" if the statue was
placed in a sight as prominent as
the center of Memorial Court,
Oliveira said. The statue already
has traces of blue paint in some

places, probably due to van
dalism by a Berkeley student
during Big Game week.
The statue may not be safe
from Stanford students either. In
1978, according to Oliveira, the
forefinger of Leland Jr. was sawn
off by a vandal. The culprit was
presumably a graduating Stan
ford senior wanting a souvenir.

The finger has since been
replaced.
Williams said the installation
of the statue is particularly
timely. "The sculpture
represents the founding fathers
and mothers of the University. It
is especially appropriate (that it]
go out on display for the Centen
nial," he said. He added that the

current plans for installing the
statue are being catalyzed by a
planned removal of Ryan Labs.
Asked about timing for the in
stallation of the statue, Oliveira
said he would be "happy to see
the statue up by the end of the
quarter, assuming we get ap
proval and agreement" from the
Office of the President.

A larger than life statue of
Leland Stanford's family may
soon be relocated to Memorial
Court, according to Art Prof.
Nathan Oliveira, chairman of the
University's Panel on Outdoor
Art.

The bronze statue displays
Leland and Leland Jr. standing
and gazing into the distance
while Jane kneels at their feet. It
is currently housed in Ryan Lab
oratories, where it is undergoing
restoration and cleaning.
The statue was commissioned
by Jane Stanford in Florence in
1890 from Larkin Mead, "a dis
tinguished artist of the time," ac
cording to Oliveira.
Originally placed in the center
of Memorial Court, it was
removed to the Stanford
Museum in 1915. In 1967 the
statue was installed on the porch
of the Stanford art gallery, but it
was removed after it was van
dalized in 1978.
The most likely placement for
the statue will be on the western
side of Memorial Court facing
east, according to Oliveira and
University Planner Phil Wil

liams. Asked whether the Stan
ford statue would detract from
the two Rodin sculptures cur
rently in Memorial Court,
Oliveira said there is a "stylistic
compatibility" among the statues
that would allow the Stanford
statue to fit in well. Oliveira cau
tioned, however, that the piece
"should not be looked at as a
Rodin, but as an emotional
portrayal of the founders of the
University."
Oliveira said the site chosen
for the statue should be close to
the "emotional focal point of the
University" because of its con
nection with the Stanford family.
He said other possible place
ments for the statue included the
center of Memorial Court, the
Oval, beside Memorial Church,
and one of the six planted oases
in the Inner Quad.
Because of the statue's original
placement in the center of
Memorial Court, some —
notably Art Prof. Albert Elsen —
have advocated returning the
statue there. Positioning of the
statue to the side of the Court is
"a bad idea," he said.
The Stanford Historical Soci
ety, however, said it favors the
side location for the statue in or
der to preserve the view through
the Inner Quad to Memorial
Church. According to a state
ment from the Society,
"aesthetic and practical reasons
dictate" placing the statue to the
side.
The view to Memorial Church
was specifically incorporated
into the original plan for the Uni
versity by its architect, Frederick
Law Olmsted.

After Jane Stanford's death in
1905, the University trustees had
the statue quietly removed under
the cover of a rainy Saturday
morning. They said the statue
was suffering under the elements
and had to be removed to an in
door location in order to allow
for its preservation.
Students immediately an
nounced a petition drive to return
the statue to its former central
position in Memorial Court.
According to Karen Bar
tholomew, editor of the Stanford
Observer and co-editor of the
Stanford Historical Society bul
letin, the trustees may have used
the excuse of decay as a "kind of
smokescreen" to restore the
original view to Memorial
Church.
In addition to the statue of the
Stanford family, a second statue
bought by Jane Stanford for
merly adorned the center of the
Oval.
The 12-foot rendition of Faith',
bought by Mrs. Stanford, was
placed atop an 18-foot concrete
column. This was described in
the Daily Palo Alto of Jan. 15,
1915 as "promptly destroying
whatever artistic value the statue
ever possessed." The statue has
since disappeared.
Oliveira cautioned that some
sites being considered, such as
the Oval, would present a secu
rity risk to the statue. "I can
imagine what the UC (Berkeley)
guys would do" if the statue was
placed in a sight as prominent as
the center of Memorial Court,
Oliveira said. The statue already
has traces of blue paint in some

places, probably due to van
dalism by a Berkeley student
during Big Game week.
The statue may not be safe
from Stanford students either. In
1978, according to Oliveira, the
forefinger of Leland Jr. was sawn
off by a vandal. The culprit was
presumably a graduating Stan
ford senior wanting a souvenir.

The finger has since been
replaced.
Williams said the installation
of the statue is particularly
timely. "The sculpture
represents the founding fathers
and mothers of the University. It
is especially appropriate (that it]
go out on display for the Centen
nial," he said. He added that the

current plans for installing the
statue are being catalyzed by a
planned removal of Ryan Labs.
Asked about timing for the in
stallation of the statue, Oliveira
said he would be "happy to see
the statue up by the end of the
quarter, assuming we get ap
proval and agreement" from the
Office of the President.
