June 12, 1906. The most cele
brated talents in theater gathered
in London's Drury Lane to cele
brate Ellen Terry's 50th year on
stage. The collection of
celebrities and the throngs of ad
mirers and well-wishers man
ifested the nation's great love for
the actress. But how had an
actress, a "public woman", won
this love?
The public woman was deeply
suspected in Victorian England.
Women's roles were defined
domestically, and there was no
place for women in the public
arena. The very term, "public
woman," connoted not only per
former, but prostitute as well.
Nina Auerbach's biography,
"Ellen Terry, a Player in Her
Time," suggests that the actress
was able to command national
admiration only at the expense of
self-definition. As "a player in
her time," Ellen Terry's predica
ment became that of the Vic
torian woman — in order to be
loved she had to become what
others wanted her to be.
As indicated by her jubilee
celebration — a celebration of
both the actress and the mother
— Terry had become what others
had wanted her to be. Mother of

two (they, too. influential in the
theater) and grand dame at
Henry Irving's Lyceum since
1878. Terry had become the very
embodiment ofVictorian woman
hood, a womanhood in which
motherhood played, by defini
tion, a significant part. Her roles
at the Lyceum, an institution
devoted to performing Shake
spearean plays in an atmosphere
initially hostile to such produc
tions, ushered her into respec
tability after a somewhat less
than respectable past.
Born Feb. 27, 1848, into a
stage family, Terry knew of no
life other than the stage. Her
father's decision to act had deter
mined the family's future, for in

mid-Victorian England, a wide
gulf separated actors from their
public. As a woman, belonging to
a family of actors gave Terry one
of the only opportunities for a
public life that society allowed.
Terry's first roles were male;
from them, she developed an in
dependence of spirit and an abil
ity to define herself.
Victorian dress codes carried
over to stage attire. In her male
roles, Terry could display her
legs sheathed in tights, some
thing unheard of for a woman.
Auerbach's analysis of the un
conscious motivation underlying
the Victorian mandate against the
display of female anatomy goes
beyond a simply sexual one. She
suggests that women's legs were
covered in voluminous material
because men had legs as well;
that there were not proscriptions
against the display of female
breasts and shoulders in this pe
riod seems to bear her analysis
out. "The very existence of
female legs was unnerving,"
Auerbach writes, "because it
presumed upon the male sphere
of activity, mobility and power."
As Terry matured into an un
mistakably female person, the
self-knowledge she had acquired
through playing male roles was
deteriorated. Her 1864 marriage
to painter George Frederic Watts
(she was 17, he was 46) brought
her for the first time squarely up
against conventional constraints
on Victorian women. Terry was
not schooled in the appropriate
behavior for women. She had not

learned that her primary respon
sibility as a wife was to support
her husband; she had assumed
her relationship with Watts
would be an artistic partnership.
Terry was happiest when in the
studio with her husband, for it
was there that her vision of their
marriage was fulfilled. The ex
perience of modeling for Watts
prepared her for stardom, but
also taught her much about
adapting herself to the expecta
tions of others.

Auerbach's study is
effective because it
points to the ways in
which women's lives
were stunted by the
demands placed upon
them by their families
and their society.

The marriage failed after a
year, and Terry was sent home to
live with her parents. She found
this return to childhood stifling
and went back to the stage. In
1867 she ran off to the country
with architect William Godwin.
She remained there for six years
and bore two children. For Auer
bach this elopement was Terry's
"one great leap beyond the
boundaries of her life."

By transgressing social codes
that stipulated that women only
live and hear children with men
to whom they are married, Terry
was able to redefine herself. Her
imagination was limited such that
she could not see beyond the ob
vious choices available, to her:
She could be a good woman, or
she could be a fallen woman. She
chose the latter. When Terry
returned to the stage in the 1870s,
she projected a new self
possession — that of an individ
ual perceived by Victorians as
living on a grander scale than the
ordinary woman.
Auerbach suggests that
Terry's longtime association with
Henry Irving, stage manager and
actor, and his theater, the
Lyceum, both ushered her into
respectability and undermined
her independence. In response to
Irving's continued miscasting of
her in "ingenue" roles, Terry
deliberately forgot her lines,
refused to learn new ones or
broke into laughter on stage. An
examination of her scripts
reveals that Terry rarely made
notes on the characters she
portrayed, though she did make
elaborate character analyses of
both major and minor characters.
It is in moments like these that
Auerbach's argument opens it
self to scrutiny. By positing that
ferry was forced to repress her
desire for personal power in the
male sphere, Auerbach's
presentation of this life provides
an intriguing way of examining
the motivations of an important

Victorian woman. For a
woman in Victorian England,
Terry commanded a great deal of
influence and respect; at the peak
of her career her earnings, 200
pounds per week, made her the
highest paid woman in England
after the Queen. In addition,
Terry was legendary among her
contemporaries for her ability to
get things done her way.
Auerbach's study is effective
because it points to the ways in
which women's lives were
stunted by the demands placed
upon them by their families and
their society. It is also a compel
ling account of one individual's
sometimes successful struggle
against these forces.

June 12, 1906. The most cele
brated talents in theater gathered
in London's Drury Lane to cele
brate Ellen Terry's 50th year on
stage. The collection of
celebrities and the throngs of ad
mirers and well-wishers man
ifested the nation's great love for
the actress. But how had an
actress, a "public woman", won
this love?
The public woman was deeply
suspected in Victorian England.
Women's roles were defined
domestically, and there was no
place for women in the public
arena. The very term, "public
woman," connoted not only per
former, but prostitute as well.
Nina Auerbach's biography,
"Ellen Terry, a Player in Her
Time," suggests that the actress
was able to command national
admiration only at the expense of
self-definition. As "a player in
her time," Ellen Terry's predica
ment became that of the Vic
torian woman — in order to be
loved she had to become what
others wanted her to be.
As indicated by her jubilee
celebration — a celebration of
both the actress and the mother
— Terry had become what others
had wanted her to be. Mother of

two (they, too. influential in the
theater) and grand dame at
Henry Irving's Lyceum since
1878. Terry had become the very
embodiment ofVictorian woman
hood, a womanhood in which
motherhood played, by defini
tion, a significant part. Her roles
at the Lyceum, an institution
devoted to performing Shake
spearean plays in an atmosphere
initially hostile to such produc
tions, ushered her into respec
tability after a somewhat less
than respectable past.
Born Feb. 27, 1848, into a
stage family, Terry knew of no
life other than the stage. Her
father's decision to act had deter
mined the family's future, for in

mid-Victorian England, a wide
gulf separated actors from their
public. As a woman, belonging to
a family of actors gave Terry one
of the only opportunities for a
public life that society allowed.
Terry's first roles were male;
from them, she developed an in
dependence of spirit and an abil
ity to define herself.
Victorian dress codes carried
over to stage attire. In her male
roles, Terry could display her
legs sheathed in tights, some
thing unheard of for a woman.
Auerbach's analysis of the un
conscious motivation underlying
the Victorian mandate against the
display of female anatomy goes
beyond a simply sexual one. She
suggests that women's legs were
covered in voluminous material
because men had legs as well;
that there were not proscriptions
against the display of female
breasts and shoulders in this pe
riod seems to bear her analysis
out. "The very existence of
female legs was unnerving,"
Auerbach writes, "because it
presumed upon the male sphere
of activity, mobility and power."
As Terry matured into an un
mistakably female person, the
self-knowledge she had acquired
through playing male roles was
deteriorated. Her 1864 marriage
to painter George Frederic Watts
(she was 17, he was 46) brought
her for the first time squarely up
against conventional constraints
on Victorian women. Terry was
not schooled in the appropriate
behavior for women. She had not

learned that her primary respon
sibility as a wife was to support
her husband; she had assumed
her relationship with Watts
would be an artistic partnership.
Terry was happiest when in the
studio with her husband, for it
was there that her vision of their
marriage was fulfilled. The ex
perience of modeling for Watts
prepared her for stardom, but
also taught her much about
adapting herself to the expecta
tions of others.

Auerbach's study is
effective because it
points to the ways in
which women's lives
were stunted by the
demands placed upon
them by their families
and their society.

The marriage failed after a
year, and Terry was sent home to
live with her parents. She found
this return to childhood stifling
and went back to the stage. In
1867 she ran off to the country
with architect William Godwin.
She remained there for six years
and bore two children. For Auer
bach this elopement was Terry's
"one great leap beyond the
boundaries of her life."

By transgressing social codes
that stipulated that women only
live and hear children with men
to whom they are married, Terry
was able to redefine herself. Her
imagination was limited such that
she could not see beyond the ob
vious choices available, to her:
She could be a good woman, or
she could be a fallen woman. She
chose the latter. When Terry
returned to the stage in the 1870s,
she projected a new self
possession — that of an individ
ual perceived by Victorians as
living on a grander scale than the
ordinary woman.
