### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
SAN DIEGO — San Diego State quar
terback Todd Santos completed a Her
culean 40 passes in 60 attempts for 536
yards against Stanford Saturday evening
at Jack Murphy Stadium, hut fell one
completion short of a win.
Cardinal cornerback Alan Grant batted
away a pass intended for San Diego
State's receiver Alfred Jackson in the
right corner of the end zone with no time
remaining on the clock to deny Santos his
sixth scoring pass of the game, and Stan
ford held on to win by a score of 44-40 in
a game riddled with penalties, turnovers,
broken records and a crucial two-point
conversion attempt that failed.
"It was probably more like a war
movie than a football game, especially in
the last minute there," said Stanford run
ning back Jon Volpe, who started in place
of the injured Brad Muster and ran for
over 100 yards for the second straight
game.
The win upped Stanford's overall
record to 2-4. The Cardinal remained 1-2
in the Pacific 10 Conference. San Diego
State dropped to 1-6 overall and stayed 1-
3 in the Western Athletic Conference.
Santos proved himself to be a strong
contender for the Heisman Trophy with
his astonishing assault on the record
books. The senior set school records for
completions, attempts and yards passing
in a game, and his five scoring strikes
gave Santos 60 touchdown passes in his
career, the most in San Diego State his
tory (Former Aztec great Dennis Shaw
threw for 58 touchdowns.).
Santos also moved past four other
quarterbacks, including former Stanford
quarterback John Elway and the Chicago
Bears' Jim McMahon, into fifth place on

the all-time NCAA passing list with 9606
yards.
"He had an outstanding night," Stan
ford Coach Jack El way said. "He picked
our zone apart — did he break the world
record for passing?
"He's got to be the best quarterback
I ve seen this year — that's for damn
sure."
Stanford reached milestones of its
own. Receiver Jeff James became only
the fifth receiver in Stanford history to
record over 2000 yards in career receiv
ing yardage.
James' two touchdown catches against
the Aztecs gave him 16 career touchdown
receptions and moved him past Emile
Harry (who had 15) and into a fourth
place tie with James Lofton and Darrin
Nelson on the Stanford all-time touch
down reception list.
The first Cardinal touchdown was all
James, who went 65 yards for the score
on a pass from Brian Johnson with 9:43
left in the first quarter. "I came under
neath, and Brian made a good play to put
it in there," said James, who was left all
alone in the middle of the field when an
Aztec linebacker went for the intercep
tion.
On the third play of the Aztecs' next
series, running back Ron Slack (who led
the Aztecs with 53 yards rushing and
caught eight passes for 42 yards)
tumbled, and Rob Hinckley recovered for
the Cardinal at the Stanford 29-yard line.
Three straight Volpe runs failed to get a
first down, and left-footed kicker John
Hopkins came in to kick the longest field
goal of his Stanford career, a 43-yarder
that gave the Cardinal a 10-0 lead.
"When we tackle, we try to strip the


Sophomore running hack Jon Volpe had another outstanding dav carrying the football for the Cardinal in place ofinjured
starter Brad Muster. J
