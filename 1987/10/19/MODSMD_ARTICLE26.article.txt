## Card nips Aztecs in scoring fest, 44-40 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
SAN DIEGO — San Diego State quar
terback Todd Santos completed a Her
culean 40 passes in 60 attempts for 536
yards against Stanford Saturday evening
at Jack Murphy Stadium, hut fell one
completion short of a win.
Cardinal cornerback Alan Grant batted
away a pass intended for San Diego
State's receiver Alfred Jackson in the
right corner of the end zone with no time
remaining on the clock to deny Santos his
sixth scoring pass of the game, and Stan
ford held on to win by a score of 44-40 in
a game riddled with penalties, turnovers,
broken records and a crucial two-point
conversion attempt that failed.
"It was probably more like a war
movie than a football game, especially in
the last minute there," said Stanford run
ning back Jon Volpe, who started in place
of the injured Brad Muster and ran for
over 100 yards for the second straight
game.
The win upped Stanford's overall
record to 2-4. The Cardinal remained 1-2
in the Pacific 10 Conference. San Diego
State dropped to 1-6 overall and stayed 1-
3 in the Western Athletic Conference.
Santos proved himself to be a strong
contender for the Heisman Trophy with
his astonishing assault on the record
books. The senior set school records for
completions, attempts and yards passing
in a game, and his five scoring strikes
gave Santos 60 touchdown passes in his
career, the most in San Diego State his
tory (Former Aztec great Dennis Shaw
threw for 58 touchdowns.).
Santos also moved past four other
quarterbacks, including former Stanford
quarterback John Elway and the Chicago
Bears' Jim McMahon, into fifth place on

the all-time NCAA passing list with 9606
yards.
"He had an outstanding night," Stan
ford Coach Jack El way said. "He picked
our zone apart — did he break the world
record for passing?
"He's got to be the best quarterback
I ve seen this year — that's for damn
sure."
Stanford reached milestones of its
own. Receiver Jeff James became only
the fifth receiver in Stanford history to
record over 2000 yards in career receiv
ing yardage.
James' two touchdown catches against
the Aztecs gave him 16 career touchdown
receptions and moved him past Emile
Harry (who had 15) and into a fourth
place tie with James Lofton and Darrin
Nelson on the Stanford all-time touch
down reception list.
The first Cardinal touchdown was all
James, who went 65 yards for the score
on a pass from Brian Johnson with 9:43
left in the first quarter. "I came under
neath, and Brian made a good play to put
it in there," said James, who was left all
alone in the middle of the field when an
Aztec linebacker went for the intercep
tion.
On the third play of the Aztecs' next
series, running back Ron Slack (who led
the Aztecs with 53 yards rushing and
caught eight passes for 42 yards)
tumbled, and Rob Hinckley recovered for
the Cardinal at the Stanford 29-yard line.
Three straight Volpe runs failed to get a
first down, and left-footed kicker John
Hopkins came in to kick the longest field
goal of his Stanford career, a 43-yarder
that gave the Cardinal a 10-0 lead.
"When we tackle, we try to strip the


Sophomore running hack Jon Volpe had another outstanding dav carrying the football for the Cardinal in place ofinjured
starter Brad Muster. J
ball if we get a chance," said
Hinckley, who finished with 11
tackles and two sacks. "A good
hard hit will also knock the ball
loose. Tonight we got a combina
tion of both."
San Diego State opened the
second quarter by taking the ball
all the way down to the Stanford
3, but on third and goal from the
5-yard line, the Cardinal defense
came up with a big play, as line
backer Darron Bennett picked
off a Santos pass at the 2 and
returned it 68 yards to the San
Diego State's 30-yard line. Again
Hopkins was called in, and the
freshman booted a 31-yard field
goal.

The Aztecs countered with a
field goal attempt of their own,
but Tyler Ackerson missed a 51-
yard attempt wide right. The Car
dinal took over on its own 34,
and on the second play of the
brief, 17-second drive, Johnson
waited for the Aztec blitz and
dumped the ball off in the middle
to a wide open James, who raced
for a 66-yard score and a 20-0
Stanford lead.
"That one was just a delay,"
James said. "It was designed to
look like I was blocking. 1 went
underneath, and I saw nothing
but green."
Monty Gilbreath returned the
ensuing kickoff 43 yards to the
Aztec 45-yard line. A shoe-string
tackle by kicker Hopkins was all
that saved a touchdown on the
return, but Santos took care of
that on the very next play, tos
sing a 55-yard scoring pass to
Jackson for the first San Diego
State touchdown.
Momentum suddenly began to
shift ever so slowly to the Az
tecs. On Stanford's next posses
sion, a Johnson pass was tipped
by tight end Jim Price and inter
cepted by linebacker Morey
Paul. Ackerson made good on a
33-yard field goal, then hit a 37-
yarder on the next San Diego
State drive. Going into halftime,
the Aztecs trailed by just one

touchdown.
Stanford started off hot again
in the third quarter, as Brad
Humphreys (who led the Cardi
nal with 14 tackles) recovered
Slack's second fumble of the
game at the San Diego 32-yard
line. Volpe later bolted up the
middle for a three-yard score.
On the next Stanford posses
sion, Johnson was blind-sided by
Milt Wilson and fumbled. Brett
Farynairz recovered at the Cardi
nal 9, and on third and goal from
the Stanford 8-yard line, Santos
found tailback Paul Hewitt near
the goal line, and the junior
eluded Jono Tunney to get in for
the score.
The Cardinal remained fumble

prone on the next drive, as both
James and Volpe lost the ball on
Stanford gains. But in each case
receiver Ed McCaffrey fell on the
ball to retain Cardinal posses
sion. On second and goal from
the 1-yard line, Johnson took it in
himself on a keeper.
"That was kind of fun," John
son said. "(Center) Andy
Sinclair told me we had that play
a couple of plays earlier. Then
they (the coaches) finally called
it. I guess they figured I was too
dumb to call it myself, so they
called it for me."
Fumbleitis was contagious.
Three plays into the ensuing Az
tec drive, Santos was hit by Ray
Huckestein, and Stanford line

backer Bruce Lang recovered the
sixth fumble of the game at the
San Diego State 15-yard line.
Once again, the Cardinal capital
ized, as Volpe carried two yards
for the touchdown, putting Stan
ford up 41-20
Then Santos got serious. The
Aztec quarterback engineered a
94-yard scoring drive which cul
minated in an 1 1-yard touchdown
pass to Gilbreath. San Diego
State regained possession on an
other fumble, as Clarence Nunn
stripped James of the ball. A
roughing-the-passer penalty
against Stanford gave San Diego
State a first and 10 at the Cardi
nal 14. and Santos hit Hewitt
again for the score.

Stanford had to settle for a 41-
yard Hopkins field goal on the
team's next drive, and San Diego
State came right back with a 79-
yard drive. With 3:26 left in the
game, Santos connected from
four yards out with Hewitt for
yet another touchdown pass.
Trailing 44-40, San Diego State
Coach Denny Stolz decided to go
for the two-point conversion,
hoping that if the play was suc
cessful, a field goal would put the
Aztecs on top.
It failed, however. Santos'
throw into the end zone fell in
complete. The Aztecs now
needed a touchdown to take the
lead — a field goal would not
even earn the Aztecs a tie.

"It's easy to second guess
something like that," Stanford
linebacker Barry McKeever said.
"But if they'd made the two
point conversion, Stolz would
look like a genius. I don't know
how they could risk something
like that."
With plenty of time left and the
Cardinal out in front by four
points, James helped out the
Stanford cause with a brilliant 65-
yard kickoff return to the San
Diego State 33 yard-line. The of
fense chewed up some time, but
couldn't come up with a first
down, and for the first time in the
game, Hopkins missed a field
goal attempt, this one from 45
yards.
