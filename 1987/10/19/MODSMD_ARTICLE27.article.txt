The Boston Celtics have the
Garden, the Minnesota Twins
have the Teflon-dome, and the
Stanford Cardinal has Roscoe
Maples Pavilion.
I he Stanford women's vol
leyball team is adding itself to
the list of teams with a domi
nant record in their home
arenas. With a 15-6. 15-10, 15-
10 win over Arizona State
Friday night and a 15-9. 15-9,
15-8 triumph over Arizona
Saturday, the fifth-ranked
Cardinal ran its home mark to
7-0 this year. Stanford, victori
ous in its last 10 matches, is
now 15-3 and atop the Pacific
10 Conference standings with
an 8-1 record.
Going back to last year, the
Cardinal has won 10 straight
matches at home and is 21-1 in
games here this season. The
team is also 13-0 in home con
ference matches since the
women's Pac-10 was formed
before last season.
Friday night's contest
against the Sun Devils show
eased the Cardinal of 1987.
The team has spent the whole
year coming back in games,
and this match was no excep
tion.
After winning the first
game, Stanford fell behind 8-3
in game two. The Cardinal
rallied, however, behind some
strong blocking and effective
hitting, winning the game 15-
10.

Game three was more of the
same. The Cardinal trailed 10-
4 when a side-out sent senior
captain Nancy Reno back to
serve. And serve. And serve.
Reno served 11 balls, Stanford
scored 11 points and the match
was over.
In addition to her serving
heroics, the 5-foot-11 middle
blocker was a force at the net.
She recorded a match-high 15
kills hitting from the middle,
the outside and even from the
back row without a single hit
ting error, giving her a .556 hit
ting percentage. The Illinois
native also tallied six blocks,
while the Sun Devils as a team
had only four.
Stanford came up with 11
total blocks, disrupting
Arizona State's attack. Senior
setter Wendi Rush recorded
many of her five blocks
alongside Reno, while senior
Teresa Smith got in on four
blocks. Due to the big Cardi
nal wall at the net, the Devils
hit only . 102, compared to .280
for Stanford.
Offensively, Stanford was
more than a one-player team
as well. Smith had 10 kills to
follow Reno, and junior Laura
Olesen pitched in with eight.
Even Rush got into the of
fense, recording a .667 hitting
mark and spiking successfully
for the last two points of the
match.
