# Golf takes eighth at Stanford links
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
In what may be considered a
rebuilding year, the Stanford
men's golf team made a fair
showing this weekend in its fall
home tournament, the Stanford
Pepsi Intercollegiate.
The Stanford A team fired
rounds of 297, 300 and 305 on the
par-71 Stanford Golf Course to
finish eighth with a 902 total in
the 18-team invitational. Arizona
State won the tournament with a
three-round total of 873, followed
by USC at 881. UC-Santa Bar
bara was a close third at 888.
Pacific, which is hosting the Car
dinal men this week in Stockton,
was an impressive fourth at 892.
Mississippi and Weber State
tied for fifth at 894. San Jose
State, not playing quite as well as
its nationally-ranked women's
team, came away with seventh at
898. Stanford edged Washington
by four strokes. Oregon's 911
was good enough for 10th.
In an exciting three-way, sud
den death playoff, Aaron Ben
goechea of Pacific edged Missis
sippi's Dave Miley and Arizona
State's Jim Strickland for first
place individual honors. All three
carded 216 totals.
Bengoechea was consistent
with rounds of 72, 73 and 71.
Miley and Strickland both were a
bit rocky on the first day, shoot
ing 74 and 75. respectively. Miley
then came back in Friday's after
noon round and Saturday's final
round with a pair of 71s, while

Strickland went 70-71.
Mike Blewett of USC and
ASU's Tom Stankowski were
one stroke from entering the
playoff, with Miguel Tola of
Weber State two shots back of
the winner.
Current U.S. Amateur cham
pion Bill Mayfair of Arizona
State tied Mark Singer of San
Jose State for seventh at 219, and
Oregon's Bob Rannow and
USC's James Kim rounded out
the top 10 at 220. Mayfair's
seventh-place finish was rather
uncharacteristic.
Stanford's John Mahon shot a
solid 221 to finish on the leader
board, and sophomore Steve
White gave the Cardinal one of
its few bright moments, shred
ding the course with a final-day
69 — the second lowest round of
the tournament — to finish at
224.
Mark Funseth's 226 and 228s
by Brad Joondeph and Roger
Miraglia rounded out Stanford's
top five scorers.
For the Stanford B team. Brad
Benbrook shot 232, Josh Zander
recorded a 233 and Don Christen
son finished at 234. Mike Hubley
and Mike VanAlstyne struggled,
each finishing at 244.
Much of the Cardinal team is
comprised of young, inexperi
enced players who have not
played a lot of competitive golf at
the collegiate level. After suffer
ing a severe drop-off last year be
cause of graduation, Stanford
looks this year for steady im
provement in its play-
