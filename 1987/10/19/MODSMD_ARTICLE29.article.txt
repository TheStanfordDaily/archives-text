# Water polo splits at home
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Saturday afternoon in deGuerre Pool, the Stan
ford water polo team lost 6-4 to USC despite out
playing the Trojans. Many shots were taken by the
Cardinal, but few reached their goal.
After an easy victory over No. 10 Pacific (6-10)
Friday in which nine different Stanford players
scored en route to a 15-4 win, the No. 2 Cardinal
(12-4) came out in full force and at top intensity
against No. 6 USC (13-3) but could not finish off its
inspired offensive charges more than four times. It
was Stanford's third Pacific 10 Conference loss
against no wins. The Trojans are I-1 in conference
play, having lost 6-5 at California Friday night.
A fourth quarter of suffocating tension had the
Cardinal faithful frequently rising to their feet in an
ticipation, (hen just as quickly returning to their
seats in disappointment. Stanford recovered from a
5-2 deficit and had a number of excellent chances to
tie the match in its waning moments before USC's
Steve Schroeder scored a strictly academic goal
with five seconds left. For the Trojans it was the
end of a long slump against Stanford, while for
Stanford it was the continuation of a scoring slump
its players and coaches can't quite figure out.
"That was the first time I have ever beaten Stan
ford in three years of starting here." Trojan
goalkeeper Kevin Stringer said. "I wanted to play
the best game I've ever played. . . . I'm just happy
to get out of here with a win. It was a big win for us,
we needed it."
"We outplayed them in every aspect of the

game," Cardinal sophomore Steve Milhani said,
"except for getting down to the final thing and put
ting the hall away, which is obviously what makes
the difference."
Milham continued, citing a drill the team went
through during the week. "We shot the ball from 10
meters and were making almost every one," Mil
ham said, "but, you know, we get in the game and I
don't know. Nerves maybe, maybe afraid to shoot
the ball, heat it up. I don't know what it is. 1 think it
could be just a bad day."
Its frustrating as hell. We've got to regroup,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "1 told the
guys. You played a great game; we're playing
good water polo, we're doing everything right but
put the ball in the goal'. ... I don't know if the
guys are too uptight, if they're trying too hard to
score, or what it is. We're in a slump as far as put
ting the ball in the goal."
With 2:50 remaining in the game and USC up 5-4,
a sequence of plays started that epitomized the
game's plot. The Cardinal held the ball for over a
minute and a half, with one shot bouncing off the
crossbar, the next attempt blocked out of bounds
and the final opportunity snuffed out by the Trojan
defense right in front of the cage.
With under a minute remaining, good Cardinal
defense led to an offensive counterattack that even
tually put senior Erich Fischer ahead of the pack
with only Trojan goalie .Stringer to beat. But Fis
cher's shot got away from him and flew over the
cage.

From then on, it was simply a
question of USC's ability to hold
the ball for 30 seconds.
Amid offensive disappoint
ment, the Cardinal continued to
play excellent defense, contain
ing USC for most of the match
despite fine play from Trojan
stars Giacomo Rossi, Robert
Lynn and Schroeder. As
opposed to the Stanford offense,
which capitalized on only one of
five six-on-five advantages, the
Trojans, given only two such
chances, made the most of their
opportunities.
It was Rossi who opened up
the match's scoring within a min
ute of the opening whistle, and
Lynn's advantage tally late in the
third quarter gave USC its fifth
and winning goal. Schroeder's
game-ending goal completed a
hat trick for the Trojan junior.
While almost every Stanford
player who hit the water took at
least one shot, only Fischer and
Andrew Lawson were able to
connect. Fischer's hat trick
upped his team-dominating goal
total to 37, far ahead of Jeff
Oeding's second-place total of
15.

Saturday afternoon in deGuerre Pool, the Stan
ford water polo team lost 6-4 to USC despite out
playing the Trojans. Many shots were taken by the
Cardinal, but few reached their goal.
After an easy victory over No. 10 Pacific (6-10)
Friday in which nine different Stanford players
scored en route to a 15-4 win, the No. 2 Cardinal
(12-4) came out in full force and at top intensity
against No. 6 USC (13-3) but could not finish off its
inspired offensive charges more than four times. It
was Stanford's third Pacific 10 Conference loss
against no wins. The Trojans are I-1 in conference
play, having lost 6-5 at California Friday night.
A fourth quarter of suffocating tension had the
Cardinal faithful frequently rising to their feet in an
ticipation, (hen just as quickly returning to their
seats in disappointment. Stanford recovered from a
5-2 deficit and had a number of excellent chances to
tie the match in its waning moments before USC's
Steve Schroeder scored a strictly academic goal
with five seconds left. For the Trojans it was the
end of a long slump against Stanford, while for
Stanford it was the continuation of a scoring slump
its players and coaches can't quite figure out.
"That was the first time I have ever beaten Stan
ford in three years of starting here." Trojan
goalkeeper Kevin Stringer said. "I wanted to play
the best game I've ever played. . . . I'm just happy
to get out of here with a win. It was a big win for us,
we needed it."
"We outplayed them in every aspect of the

game," Cardinal sophomore Steve Milhani said,
"except for getting down to the final thing and put
ting the hall away, which is obviously what makes
the difference."
Milham continued, citing a drill the team went
through during the week. "We shot the ball from 10
meters and were making almost every one," Mil
ham said, "but, you know, we get in the game and I
don't know. Nerves maybe, maybe afraid to shoot
the ball, heat it up. I don't know what it is. 1 think it
could be just a bad day."
Its frustrating as hell. We've got to regroup,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "1 told the
guys. You played a great game; we're playing
good water polo, we're doing everything right but
put the ball in the goal'. ... I don't know if the
guys are too uptight, if they're trying too hard to
score, or what it is. We're in a slump as far as put
ting the ball in the goal."
With 2:50 remaining in the game and USC up 5-4,
a sequence of plays started that epitomized the
game's plot. The Cardinal held the ball for over a
minute and a half, with one shot bouncing off the
crossbar, the next attempt blocked out of bounds
and the final opportunity snuffed out by the Trojan
defense right in front of the cage.
With under a minute remaining, good Cardinal
defense led to an offensive counterattack that even
tually put senior Erich Fischer ahead of the pack
with only Trojan goalie .Stringer to beat. But Fis
cher's shot got away from him and flew over the
cage.

From then on, it was simply a
question of USC's ability to hold
the ball for 30 seconds.
Amid offensive disappoint
ment, the Cardinal continued to
play excellent defense, contain
ing USC for most of the match
despite fine play from Trojan
stars Giacomo Rossi, Robert
Lynn and Schroeder. As
opposed to the Stanford offense,
which capitalized on only one of
five six-on-five advantages, the
Trojans, given only two such
chances, made the most of their
opportunities.
It was Rossi who opened up
the match's scoring within a min
ute of the opening whistle, and
Lynn's advantage tally late in the
third quarter gave USC its fifth
and winning goal. Schroeder's
game-ending goal completed a
hat trick for the Trojan junior.
While almost every Stanford
player who hit the water took at
least one shot, only Fischer and
Andrew Lawson were able to
connect. Fischer's hat trick
