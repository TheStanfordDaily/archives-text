# Doctors call drug tests 'adequate'
## 
### Mike MacCrystall Staff writer 
A former medical specialist for the U.S. Olympic
Committee was one of two expert witnesses to tes
tify in support of the NCAA's collegiate drug
testing program Friday.
Dr. Robert Voy was the first medical expert
called by the National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion in its Santa Clara County Superior Court battle
against Stanford seniors Barry McKeever and Jen
nifer Hill, who are seeking a restraining order
against the NCAA's drug-testing policy. The Uni
versity is acting as a third party supporting
McKeever and Hill.
Voy testified that the policy of testing athletes is
necessary to counter the "incredible evidence of
drug abuse" in many athletic programs.
Although he did not specify any particular school
or sport, football ranked as the sport in which drugs
were most abused, according to 1985 NCAA
statistics presented at the hearings Tuesday.
Of the 34 NCAA athletes disqualified because of
positive drug tests in that year, Voy said 31 were
football players. Most of the athletes who were dis
qualified tested positive for presence of anabolic
steroids in their urine.
Voy, who headed the medical team for the U.S.
Olympic Committee at the 1984 Sarajevo Winter
Olympics, played an integral part in developing the
drug-testing program implemented by the Interna
tional Olympic Committee.
The NCAA program was modeled after the suc
cessful implementation of the lOC program in the
1984 Games. He said his experience has lent him a
great deal of knowledge over the years about "the
effects of drugs on athletes."
