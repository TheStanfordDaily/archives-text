# Doctors call drug tests 'adequate'
## 
### Mike MacCrystall Staff writer 
A former medical specialist for the U.S. Olympic
Committee was one of two expert witnesses to tes
tify in support of the NCAA's collegiate drug
testing program Friday.
Dr. Robert Voy was the first medical expert
called by the National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion in its Santa Clara County Superior Court battle
against Stanford seniors Barry McKeever and Jen
nifer Hill, who are seeking a restraining order
against the NCAA's drug-testing policy. The Uni
versity is acting as a third party supporting
McKeever and Hill.
Voy testified that the policy of testing athletes is
necessary to counter the "incredible evidence of
drug abuse" in many athletic programs.
Although he did not specify any particular school
or sport, football ranked as the sport in which drugs
were most abused, according to 1985 NCAA
statistics presented at the hearings Tuesday.
Of the 34 NCAA athletes disqualified because of
positive drug tests in that year, Voy said 31 were
football players. Most of the athletes who were dis
qualified tested positive for presence of anabolic
steroids in their urine.
Voy, who headed the medical team for the U.S.
Olympic Committee at the 1984 Sarajevo Winter
Olympics, played an integral part in developing the
drug-testing program implemented by the Interna
tional Olympic Committee.
The NCAA program was modeled after the suc
cessful implementation of the lOC program in the
1984 Games. He said his experience has lent him a
great deal of knowledge over the years about "the
effects of drugs on athletes."
Besides protecting the health
of the athletes, Voy emphasized
that drug testing "insures fair
competition among athletes."
Under cross-examination by
Robert Van Nest, an attorney
representing McKeever and Hill,
Voy argued that "testing has
proven to deter drug use.
Documentation of the policy sup
ports the results of [the lOC]
drug-testing program."
The NCAA also called Robert
Dugal, director of the National
Institute of Scientific Research in
Montreal, to testify on its behalf.
Dugal discounted the argu
ments of critics who claim the
program is questionable because
the test fails to indicate the

regularity of substance use, when
drugs were taken and how much
performance may have been en
hanced.
"The tests show that the ath
letes had drugs in their body at
some point. That is sufficient, as
far as I'm concerned, to dis
qualify an athlete," he said.
Richard Archer, an attorney
for the NCAA, said he thinks the
hearings will conclude tomor
row. At that point, Judge Conrad
Rushing must decide whether to
grant Stanford athletes a prelimi
nary injuction exempting them
from the nationwide drug-testing
program.
Rushing indicated Friday that
the NCAA may request that the
hearings be redesignated as a
trial. If this is done, the verdict of
the trial would set a legal prece
dent and be subject to appeal
only in a higher court.
