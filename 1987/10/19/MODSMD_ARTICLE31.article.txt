# Women's soccer gains win and tie
## 
### Robert Pardington Staff writer 
The Cardinal earned a little
respect over the weekend, as the
Stanford women's soccer team
downed the University of
Portland 2-0 on Friday and then
tied Chico State 0-0 yesterday.
The games, played at Maloney
Field, put the Cardinal at 3-6-3 on
the year. Above all, they showed
that Stanford's youngest sports
team is now maturing.
In the Portland match, Stan
ford was right at the Pilots'
throats from the kickoff. Ten
minutes into the contest, senior
forward Jen Hill took a pass from
freshman defender Anne Pusch
and lofted it into the net.
"We were seeing options and
connecting very well," Hill said.
In the second half, Portland
came out enthused and seemed
to be winning more balls. But the
Pilots couldn't score. With 15
minutes remaining, junior mid
fielder Carolyn Denney tapped in
the Cardinal's second goal from
five feet away. Freshman
midfielder Denise Denney and
junior forward Stacey Keare
were credited with the assists.
Possessing a comfortable lead,
Stanford Coach Berhane An
deberhan cleared the bench with
large-scale substitutions.
"We avoided mistakes and
stayed composed/' Andeberhan
said. "Being ahead, the ad
renaline gave us energy."
For the game, Stanford had 19
shots on goal to the Pilots' seven.
Elise Edwards had five saves
playing goalkeeper for the Cardi
nal, and Portland's Gwen
Thompson had three.
"We were flat," Pilot Coach
Jim Tursi said. "They wanted it.
We just went through the mo
tions."
A key to any soccer game is
control of the middle of the field.
Stanford's Denise Denney and
senior midfielder Amy Geisse
dominated the center of the field
in this game, heading balls out of
the air and beating the Pilots to
the ball on the ground. Portland's
game plan was destroyed.
"We generally don't do well
on California road trips," Tursi
said.

The Pilots dropped to 11-3-2 on
the season, with games at Santa
Clara and St. Mary's this week.
Stanford rested Saturday and
then geared up for Chico State,
which beat the Cardinal 1-0 last
year and is a perennial power in
the Northern California Athletic
Conference.
The game was fast paced, but
the teams were evenly matched
and cancelled each other's offen
ses with great defenses.
Sophomore Vija Brookshire
and Edwards split time in goal for
Stanford. Brookshire and Ed
wards were locked into a duel
with Chico goalie Becky Osgood.
The keepers made flying saves all
afternoon, with Edwards ac
cumulating 10 stops, Brookshire
four and Osgood 12.

k We were flat. They
wanted it. We just
went through the mo
tions.'
â€” Pilot Coach Jim
Tursi

The Cardinal got off 22 shots to
Chico's 19. None connected,
however, and the game ended in
a scoreless tie after two 15-
minute overtimes.
Play was very rough through
out the game. Chico State was
penalized 24 times on fouls, and
Stanford had 11 infractions.
"They played a little too ag
gressively," Stanford freshman
midfielder Lisa Sime said.
However, the official kept
fairly good control of the game.
"I liked the way he took con
trol," Andeberhan said. "He
was fair, and he let the players
know the reasons for his calls."
Chico State Coach Bob Russ
was surprised by the team bal
ance of Stanford. "They were
well-coached and well-round
ed," Russ said. "We had a hard
time finding a weakness to ex
ploit."
Russ praised the Cardinal
defense for shutting down his of
fensive wings. He also said that
Chico State sweeper Kim Hat

field had an extraordinary game.
Stanford stuck with its starting
lineup for most of the game,
while Chico State used sub
stitutes extensively. The Cardi
nal had this luxury because of its
well-conditioned squad. In the
overtimes, however, the starters
began to tire.
Andeberhan played Sime for
an extended period in the second
half. Sime responded with two
near goals on breakaways.
"Lisa Sime was on fire," An

deberhan said. "She used her
speed to maximum advantage."
Overall, the match was a tough
defensive battle with several near
misses. "It was a very physical
game in which the defenses
played great," Osgood said.
Chico State now stands at 8-4-
2.
Stanford gets a breather from
action before traveling to North
Colorado, Colorado College and
George Washington University
next weekend.
