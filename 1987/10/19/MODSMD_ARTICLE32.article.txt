# Gray rolls at Cal Poly
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Marc Olesen set a new course
record for the men's five-mile
circuit, and Carol Gray broke the
17-minute barrier in the women's
five-kilometer race, highlighting
the Stanford cross country
team's success Saturday at the
Cal Poly Cross Country Invita
tional.
Olesen, a graduate who has
one year of eligibility remaining
in track and field but is compet
ing unofficially in cross country,
covered the five miles in 23:59.6
to capture the victory. Gray
finished the five-kilometer race
in fifth place with a time of 16:53.
The top offical Stanford scorer
for the men's team was Eric Mas
talir, who ran a 24:17 five-mile to
place eighth. Mastalir's brother
Mark finished in 24:50 for 23rd
place. James Alborough was 34th
with a time of 24:58. All three ran
sub-five-minute-mile pace for the
first time this season.
Gray replaced Cory Schubert
as the women's top runner, as
Schubert was resting a foot in
jury. Kim Stevens ran 17:40 to
place second on the team and
31st overall.

The next four Cardinal finis
hers were freshmen. Wendy
Neely and Mary Mendoza
finished just behind Stevens in
36th and 41st, respectively, as
each had her best outing of the
season. An injured Melanie
Bloch and Jamie Fallon finished
69th and 7()th.
The women's team finished in
fifth place overall with 182
points. UCLA, which had beaten
the Cardinal by just one point at
the Stanford Invitational, won
Saturday with 74 points. Vet, the
Stanford freshman team of
Neely, Mendoza, Bloch, Fallon
and Cindi Moothart beat UCLA
53-83 to capture the freshman
title.
In addition, five of the top six
Stanford finishers had their fast
est times of the year.
The story was much the same
on the men's side. Eric Mastalir
cut almost one-and-a-half
minutes off his five-mile time at
the Meeting of the Minds last
month, and Mark took more than
a minute from his previous time.
In fourth place was Steve
Schadler, placed fourth and 50th
overall, an improved 15 seconds
behind Alborough. In fifth place
was Bill Crowley in 25:58.

The team's unofficial tally put
the Cardinal in fourth place, al
though official scoring was
delayed. Stanford demonstrated
on the fast course at Cal Poly that
it has a solid top four. The team
will need a strong fifth man who
can run with the pack and an out
standing team effort if it is to win
the Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionship Nov. 2 at Stanford.
Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson was counting on Satur
day's race to prove that certain
individuals were ready for this
type of race. The women moved
within range of their ultimate
goal, a 17:30 five-kilometer time.
"It's nice to see Carol Gray back
with her fastest time of the year,
and we need to get Melanie and
Cory back with Carol," Johnson
said.
"We went into the meet to in
crease the speed of our fourth or
fifth runners. I feel optimistic
we'll get a fourth or fifth run
ner," he added.
Johnson feels that an outstand
ing effort by both the men's and
the women's team will give them
a good chance to win the Pac-10
championship, which the men's
team won in 1985 when Olesen
took individual honors.

to capture the victory. Gray
finished the five-kilometer race
in fifth place with a time of 16:53.
The top offical Stanford scorer
for the men's team was Eric Mas
talir, who ran a 24:17 five-mile to
place eighth. Mastalir's brother
Mark finished in 24:50 for 23rd
place. James Alborough was 34th
with a time of 24:58. All three ran
sub-five-minute-mile pace for the
first time this season.
Gray replaced Cory Schubert
as the women's top runner, as
Schubert was resting a foot in
jury. Kim Stevens ran 17:40 to
place second on the team and
31st overall.

The next four Cardinal finis
hers were freshmen. Wendy
Neely and Mary Mendoza
finished just behind Stevens in
36th and 41st, respectively, as
each had her best outing of the
season. An injured Melanie
Bloch and Jamie Fallon finished
69th and 7()th.
The women's team finished in
fifth place overall with 182
points. UCLA, which had beaten
the Cardinal by just one point at
the Stanford Invitational, won
Saturday with 74 points. Vet, the
Stanford freshman team of
Neely, Mendoza, Bloch, Fallon
and Cindi Moothart beat UCLA
53-83 to capture the freshman
title.
In addition, five of the top six
Stanford finishers had their fast
est times of the year.
The story was much the same
on the men's side. Eric Mastalir
cut almost one-and-a-half
minutes off his five-mile time at
the Meeting of the Minds last
month, and Mark took more than
a minute from his previous time.
In fourth place was Steve
Schadler, placed fourth and 50th
overall, an improved 15 seconds
behind Alborough. In fifth place
was Bill Crowley in 25:58.

The team's unofficial tally put
the Cardinal in fourth place, al
though official scoring was
delayed. Stanford demonstrated
on the fast course at Cal Poly that
it has a solid top four. The team
will need a strong fifth man who
can run with the pack and an out
standing team effort if it is to win
the Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionship Nov. 2 at Stanford.
Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson was counting on Satur
day's race to prove that certain
individuals were ready for this
type of race. The women moved
within range of their ultimate
goal, a 17:30 five-kilometer time.
"It's nice to see Carol Gray back
with her fastest time of the year,
and we need to get Melanie and
Cory back with Carol," Johnson
said.
"We went into the meet to in
crease the speed of our fourth or
fifth runners. I feel optimistic
we'll get a fourth or fifth run
ner," he added.
Johnson feels that an outstand
ing effort by both the men's and
the women's team will give them
a good chance to win the Pac-10
championship, which the men's
team won in 1985 when Olesen
took individual honors.
