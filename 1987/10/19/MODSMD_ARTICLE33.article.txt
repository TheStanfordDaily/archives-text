# Cardinal winless at Berkeley event
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Talk of the Stanford men's
soccer team receiving a
postseason invitation to the
NCAA tournament may have
been premature.
After Stanford defeated four
highly regarded, nationally
ranked squads (San Francisco,
Fresno State, Washington and
UCLA) in a nine-day period,
there was much speculation
about the team competing in the
NCAA tournament in November
and receiving a ranking of its
own. But the Cardinal has failed
to win a game in its last three
matches, losing two and tying the
third.
The team went 0-1-1 in the
Golden Bear Soccer Classic this
weekend. Stanford's record just
barely remained above .500. The
loss and tie dropped the squad to
7-6-3 overall. Its Pacific Soccer
Conference tally remains at 2-1.
Saturday Stanford was
defeated 2-1 by Simon Fraser in
California's Memorial Stadium.
It took the Cardinal the entire
first half to warm up. By the time
the squad was in game form, it
was down 2-0.
"During the first half we just
didn't have an offense," Stan
ford co-Captain Mike Mossmer

said. "And on defense, we were
shaky on Simon Fraser's coun
ter-offensive."
Stanford woke up during
halftime and controlled the game
the entire second period, but was
not able to catch up. The Cardi
nal's one goal was scored by
midfielder/fullback Kevin Wood
house.
The most the squad could
muster yesterday against Penn
sylvania was a tie. The match
ended without either squad able
to produce a goal. Although the
Cardinal felt it dominated the
entire match, the team was
unable to score on several oppor
tunities. Stanford had at least
four shots directly in front of the
goal, but each was either saved
by Pennsylvania's goalie or was
misfired by the goal.
"Pennsylvania has a really
good goalie, and we were just
unable to get the ball in the net,"
Mossmer said.
When the 90 minutes of regula
tion time ended with the score at
0-0, the game extended into an
overtime of two 10-minute
halves. But again, neither team
was able to record an official
goal. The Cardinal actually
scored with less than one minute
remaining in overtime, but the
goal was called back because the
Quakers thought time was out.
