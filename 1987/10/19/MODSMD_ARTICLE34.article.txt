# Fired Prof. Franklin gets Rutgers tenure
## 
### Kelly Brown 
H. Bruce Franklin, who in
1972 became the only Stanford
professor to have his tenure
revoked, has been offered an
endowed chair in English at
Rutgers University in New
Jersey, the Times Tribune re
ported Thursday.
Franklin, a self-proclaimed
Maoist revolutionary, lost his
tenure as an English professor
here after being accused of
"urging and inciting" violence
on the campus in 1972.
University officials at the
time charged Franklin, long an
outspoken opponent of the
Vietnam War, of having
incited students at a White
Plaza rally to occupy the Uni
versity's computer center,
which was then being used for
military strategic planning.
He was also accused of ur
ging and participating in the
heckling of a campus speech
by then-U.S. Ambassador to
South Vietnam Henry Cabot
Lodge.
Franklin s dismissal was
recommended by the Univer
sity's Advisory Board, a fac
ulty committee headed by Bi
ology Prof. Donald Kennedy.
Kennedy, now president of
the University, and Religion
Prof. Robert Brown were the
only members of the seven
member board to vote against
firing Franklin and in favor of
a lesser penalty.
Kennedy recommended
suspending Franklin for two
quarters, while Brown asked
for a one-quarter suspension.
Later that year. Franklin
filed a lawsuit against Stanford
claiming he had been fired
soley because of his radical
political views. The case un

derwent several appeals
during the 1970s and early
1980s. Franklin lost a final ap
peal in 1986.
Franklin tried unsuccess
fully during the '70s to prove
that the FBI had harrassed
him for his campus activism.
He cited as evidence letters
written by the FBI to the Uni
versity Board of Trustees en
couraging them to "to take
some action against such a
person as Franklin and insist
that he be removed from his
position."
Rutgers' 1975 decision to
hire Franklin as an untenured
professor was met with much
objection in the New Jersey
Senate at the time, but was
strongly defended by Rutgers
university regents.
Franklin's removal from
Stanford was said by many to
to have had a chilling effect on
academic freedom here. His
tory Prof. Harold Kahn in
1972 cited what he called a
clear pattern of junior faculty
keeping silent on political is
sues for fear of being denied
tenure.
Calling Franklin an
"eminent scholar and a ver
satile, active teacher" who is
"highly deserving" of his new
position, Kahn said yesterday
that he was "absolutely
delighted" to hear of
Franklin's appointment.
Franklin was graduated
magna cum laude from Am
herst College in 1955. He sub
sequently worked for the U.S.
Strategic Air Command from
1956 to 1969 and taught at a
number of universities, includ
ing Johns Hopkins and the
Free University of Paris.
Franklin was unavailable for
comment yesterday.
