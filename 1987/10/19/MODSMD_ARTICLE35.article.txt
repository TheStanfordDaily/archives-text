# Lighting up to be banned
## Hospital will prohibit smoking 
### Courtenay Thompson 
As of Dec. 15, smoking will be
banned everywhere in the Stan
ford Hospital, hospital officials
announced last week.
The hospital board of directors
unanimously approved a new
policy that will prohibit smoking
in all areas of the hospital and in
its Palo Alto offices.
The new "no-smoking policy"
will replace the present "non
smoking policy" in place since
1982, which restricts smoking to
designated waiting areas within
the hospital.
Under the new policy, the
smoking ban will be extended to
include all public and private
areas within the hospital — in
cluding private offices and inter
nal patios.
The reaction of hospital
employees to the new policy

seemed largely favorable. Sue
Mills, a registered nurse, called
smoking inside a hospital
"horrible."
But while acknowledging the
need to keep smoke away from
patient-occupied areas, some
employees expressed concern
about the policy change.
"On my lunch break, I should
be able to sit and smoke," said
Nadine Jackson, an intake recep
tionist. "A lounge should be pro
vided for smokers only."
The change was called "long
overdue" by Manfred Hayes, as
sociate hospital director and co
chair of the committee that for
mulated the new regulations. "It
is the culmination of a 17-year
process to eliminate smoking in
the hospital," he said.
Stanford Hospital is among the
few hospitals in the Bay Area to
ban smoking completely, but

Jeanne Kennedy, director of
community and patient relations,
said she thinks other hospitals
will follow suit.

"The smoker is feeling the
pressure," Hayes said. "As a
health care facility, we are

obligated to create a healthy en

ing a smoke-free environment for
our patients and employees."
"We are offering our
employees alternatives," Hayes
said, emphasizing that the hospi
tal will implement the policy in a
way that is "positive and suppor
tive of smokers."
The hospital will promote
smoking cessation classes and
will pay 40 to 50 percent of the
course fees for employees,
physicians and volunteers,
Hayes said.
To ease implementation, the
hospital will sponsor an exten
sive program to inform
employees, patients, physicians,
volunteers and visitors of the
smoking ban.
People will still be allowed to
smoke outdoors on hospital
grounds.
