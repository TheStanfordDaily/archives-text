# Vandals and litterers beware
## Ranger may patrol Foothills 
### Burke Smith Staff writer 
A University-hired ranger may patrol Stan
ford's Foothills as early as spring quarter, ac
cording to University officials.
Faced with vandalism, littering and envi
ronmental problems in the Foothills, the Uni
versity is considering a plan to hire a ranger
who would patrol the 1500-acre area on either
a horse or a motorcycle.
According to Thomas Richman of the Uni
versity Planning Office, the ranger would be
one element of a comprehensive plan to
manage the Foothills. The plan, Richman
said, has three main components:
• educating recreational users about the
Foothills,

• protecting the environment, and
• enforcing University regulations.
Under the new plan recreational users
might, if stopped by the ranger, be required
to show Stanford identification. While Rich
man said the details of the plan have not yet
been worked out, the ranger's patrols will
likely be conducted at random intervals.
The Foothills have long been used as a
recreational resource for runners, hikers and
nature lovers, but "usage is increasing," said
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
The increased traffic in the Foothills has
"more impact, causes more litter and people
bring things up there that they're not sup
posed to," Herrington said.
Although Richman cautioned the Stanford
community not to "blow the ranger out of

proportion," he said the officers presence
could reduce littering, graffiti and cases of
people living in abandoned buildings.
The Foothills are not "a big crime prob
lem, Herrington said. He said the ranger
would help stem environmental problems
that plague the Foothills, such as the creation
of new trails that increase erosion.
The ranger's focus would be on enhancing
environmental awareness, much like the
traditional park ranger, Richman said.
If the plan is approved, the ranger would
cost the University approximately $40,000
per year. If the ranger rides a horse, the cost
will increase by $4000 annually. The horse
would be kept either in the Stanford Barn or
at Piers Ranch on Alpine Road, Richman
said.
