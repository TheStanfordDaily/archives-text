# McCloskey: System lacks quality
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Staff writer 
Former U.S. Rep. Paul "Pete"
McCloskey said Saturday that
the United States has not
succeeded in maintaining an ac
ceptable "quality of govern
ment" because of public apathy.
"You have a duty to partici
pate in the one great failure of
oiif society today," McCloskey
said to an audience of about 200
people gathered in Kresge
Auditorium for "People, Power
and Politics," a non-partisan po
litical education conference.
McCloskey, a former con
gressman from the 12th District,
which includes Stanford, put the
weight of responsibility for in

creased political activism on the
shoulders of Bay Area residents.
"We are one of the luckiest
[political districts in the United
States], and we have an obliga
tion to leadership," McCloskey
said.
"One person speaking out is
the secret to effectiveness of
politics in America," McCloskey
said, telling a story about one de
termined man who convinced
U.S. Rep. Ed Zschau to cast the
deciding vote against a contro
versial 1985 MX missile bill.
In another example of the im
portance of individual initiative,
McCloskey said that a former
Stanford student body president
organized 30 students to partici
pate in an environmental move

ment that became the
springboard for major environ
mental legislation.
"Now kids do not care enough
or think they can be effective,"
McCloskey added.
Although McCloskey said he
was disappointed by student
apathy, he added that he was
"delighted" by the growing polit
ical activism of women.
The "hidden secret" in the
Reagan administration is that the
best jobs are being done by
women who were formerly
housewives of congressmen and
who are now running committees
like the Interstate Commerce
Commission and the Air Traffic
Safety Commission, McCloskey
said.
