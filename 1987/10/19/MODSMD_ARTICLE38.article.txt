### Burke Smith Staff writer 
State Assemblyman John Vas
concellos (D-San Jose) urged
private citizens to become in
volved in government during a
speech at a conference here Sat
urday.
Vasconcellos opened his
keynote address to the "People,
Power and Politics" conference
crowd of 200 in Kresge
Auditorium by saying individuals
must struggle to gain political
clout. "You can't expect some
fancy politician to give you per
sonal empowerment," Vascon
cellos said.
But he defended the idea that
the people, rather than an elite

body, should control governmen
tal affairs. He described this idea
as the "constructive" view of
political involvement, as
opposed to the "destructive"
view that mass political involve
ment has a negative influence on
society.
The constructive view of
human beings allows the focus of
politics to be public and encour
ages involvment from everyone,
Vasconcellos said.
He described the destructive
view of human nature as inher
ently flawed since it rules out any
form of democratic government.
"If you don't trust yourself, you
ought to be locked away," he
said.
Vasconcellos also spoke about
the California Task Force to

Promote Self-Esteem and Social
Responsibility, which he played
a leading role in creating. He said
the goal of the task force is to
create a "vaccine against social
problems."
One of the task force's plans is
to create the California Human
Corps next year. Every college
student in the state will be
strongly encouraged to work 30
hours a year in public service,
Vasconcellos said.
Over the past 20 years, a
remarkable outburst of in
dividuality at the expense of the
community has occurred, ac
cording to Vasconcellos. He said
an additional goal of the task
force is to restore some sense of
community to the youth of Cali
fornia.
