A host of stale and iocal political leaders
gave speeches and participated in panel
discussions as part of "People, Power and
Politics," a conference advocating indi
vidual initiative in democracy held here
Saturday.
Former U.S. Congressman Paul "Pete"
McCloskey headlined the list of speakers
at the conference, held in Kresge Au
ditorium and attended by about 200 stu
dents and local residents.
Setting the tone for the program, As
semblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San

Jose) delivered the keynote address titled
"Citizen Action in a Democracy."
Throughout the day, panel discussions
and workshops demonstrated how individ
uals can be an effective part of the political
process.
The first panel discussion, titled "The
Grit and Glory of Getting Elected,"
featured Assemblyman Charles Quaken
bush (R-San Jose) and Assemblywoman
Jacqueline Speier (D-South San Fran
cisco) — both elected to the California
Legislature last year — and Alan Hof
fenblum, an experienced campaign
manager.
Speier emphasized that the skills re

quired for getting elected are few. But she
said integrity, believability and "passion"
for the campaign are important.
"There are no magical steps (to getting
into office)," she said. "It requires your
commitment and intent to run for office
[and] your belief in yourself."
Quakenbush agreed with Speier about
the large commitment involved in running
for what is, "at times, a very thankless
job."
He also stressed that character is an im
portant factor in campaigning. Because
most voters will not know a candidate's
stance on every issue, ihey will often vote
on gut reaction to personality, according

to Quakenbush.
"Present yourself as you really are," he
said. "Don't . . . say yes' to every group
because [voters will] doubt your real char
acter."
Both members of the Assembly ex
pressed frustration with campaign fund
raising. Speier called it"the most distaste
ful part of campaigning."
Hoffenblum, who recently headed the
succesful campaign of Assemblyman
William Duplissea (R-San Carlos), defined
a "good candidate" as "an individual who
has the ability to motivate others to get in-
volved in his or her campaign."
He said that candidates too of
ten adopt the philosophy of
"ittytwit: I think that you think
what I think." He encouraged
potential candidates to under
stand how constituents vote.
Stanford Public Relations Offi
cer Diana Diamond moderated
another panel discussion,
"Media Magic," in which local

radio and television journalists
addressed how the media
determines what is newsworthy
in relation to politics.
Rollin Post, a political com
mentator for KRON-TV, pointed
out that because television is
commercial, it imposes limita
tions on which items will make
the news, including stories about
candidates for public office.
Candidates running a "viable,
active campaign" with organiza
tion and sufficient funds will
make the press, according to
Post.

"Do we play God? Yes, we
play God in who . . . and what
we re going to cover," he said.
Post described the relationship
between reporters and politicians
as a "strange, rocky marriage."
Although "each needs the
other," he said, "our responsi
bility is not to them. It's to the
voter."
Mark Simon, a political re
porter for the Peninsula Times
Tribune, added that information
"must have credibility right
when it enters the newsroom. It's
either quality, or it's not."
