A host of stale and iocal political leaders
gave speeches and participated in panel
discussions as part of "People, Power and
Politics," a conference advocating indi
vidual initiative in democracy held here
Saturday.
Former U.S. Congressman Paul "Pete"
McCloskey headlined the list of speakers
at the conference, held in Kresge Au
ditorium and attended by about 200 stu

Jose) delivered the keynote address titled
"Citizen Action in a Democracy."

most voters will not know a candidate's
stance on every issue, ihey will often vote
on gut reaction to personality, according

to Quakenbush.
"Present yourself as you really are," he
said. "Don't . . . say yes' to every group
because [voters will] doubt your real char
acter."
Both members of the Assembly ex
pressed frustration with campaign fund
raising. Speier called it"the most distaste
ful part of campaigning."
Hoffenblum, who recently headed the
succesful campaign of Assemblyman
William Duplissea (R-San Carlos), defined
a "good candidate" as "an individual who
