# After the Reagan library
## An uneasy marriage: Hoover and Stanford 
### Joe Metcalfe 
This is the first article in a series on the
relationship between the Hoover Institu
tion and Stanford. The next installment
will appear one week from today.

It is ironic that the 285-foot Hoover
Tower, although the most familiar
landmark on Stanford's campus, is part
of an institution technically removed
from the University.

Indeed, the uneasy marriage between
Stanford University and the Hoover In
stitution on War, Revolution and Peace
has proven over the past 25 years to he an
issue surrounded by controversy.
Critics excoriate the Hoover Institu
tion as a conservative think tank with a
political mission that threatens to damage
Stanford's national reputation and politi
cal neutrality.
Hoover's defenders praise it as an in
fluential and well-respected institution
devoted to advanced research and schol
arship in domestic and international af
fairs.

A history of controversies has influ
enced the nature of the relationship be
tween the Institution and the University.
As the memory of the Reagan Library
fades, this current period of relative calm
provides the opportunity to review the re
lationship between the University and
Hoover and look toward its future.
In this decade, controversy over this
relationship has primarily centered
around the release of the Ward and Dom
busch reports on Stanford-Hoover rela
tions and around the planned building of
the Reagan Library on Stanford's
campus.
Although Hoover was a center of con
troversy during the '60s and the '70s, the
event that has sparked the greatest al
tercations of this decade had little to do
with either Stanford or Hoover: the elec
tion of Ronald Reagan to the presidency
of the United States.
Reagan, who was named honorary fel
low at Hoover in 1975, has always main
tained ties with the institution and most
notably with W. Glenn Campbell,
Hoover's director since 1960.
Speaking immediately after the 1980
election at a banquet in honor of the insti
tution's Board of Overseers, Reagan said
he "had called on more people from the
(Hoover) Institution to help with my cam
paign than from any other institution."


A legacy of
controversy
In 1983, several faculty members ex
amined Hoover's 1982 annual report,
which contained frequent references to
the Hoover-White House connection.
These faculty members mounted a peti
tion drive that questioned the legitimacy
of Hoover's ties to Stanford. The drive
was largely a result of the efforts of Eng
lish Prof. Ronald Rebholz and Political
Science Prof. John Manley.
Both men have consistently been out
spoken critics of Hoover, arguing that
the integrity of the University is tainted
by its ties to the institution.
The petition, which sought to discuss
the question of Hoover's relationship
with the University, contained the
names of 1500 students and 84 faculty
members and was presented to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
The petitioners called for an indepen
dent visiting committee to investigate re
lations between the Hoover Institution
and Stanford.
Although the committee was never ac
tually established, its original intent was
to discuss the possible severance of
Hoover from the University.
Shortly after the petition's presenta
tion, Kennedy established the Resource
Group for the Trustees' Committee on
the Hoover Institution, chaired by
Robert Ward, professor emeritus of po
litical science at Stanford and senior fel
low at Hoover.
Instead of explicitly dealing with the
concerns of the petitioners, however,
the committee was directed by the Uni
versity to explore the possibilities of
taking further advantage of "the oppor
tunities to strengthen research and in
structional programs in areas of joint in
terest to the Hoover Institution and
related parts of Stanford."
Additionally, in response to accusa
tions that the appointment procedures at
Hoover lacked rigor and failed to ensure
quality appointments, the Ward Com
mittee was charged with evaluating the
process by which Hoover fellows are
chosen.
Released Nov. 30, 1984, the Ward
Report, although admitting that there
was "a rich undercurrent of political
considerations" behind the Hoover-
Stanford controversy, argued that the
estrangement was not solely ideological

or political. The committee argued that
much of the hostility was due to
"institutional factors" resulting from the
unusual ties between the Institution and
the University.
"The anomalous relationship of the
Hoover Institution to the University —
at the same time a part of Stanford but
legally and operationally enjoying al
most complete and permanent autonomy
— makes some conflict practically inevi
table," according to the report.
The report's final recommendations
included a call for greater cooperation
between Stanford and Hoover in the
form of joint faculty appointments at the
senior level.

Although most scholars at Hoover
said they viewed the Ward Report as en
couraging, others within the University
denounced it, especially those in the po
litical science department.
Critics of the Ward Report were
primarily concerned that the report
ignored ihe more essential question of
whether the Hoover Institution should
be associated at all with Stanford.
This concern was partially responsible
for the unanimous call from the Faculty
Senate in February, 1985, to have its
own committee study the impact of
closer ties with the Hoover Institution.
The Senate Committee on the Rela
tion Between the Hoover Institution and
the Stanford Professoriate, chaired by

Prof. Sanford M. Dornbusch, submitted
its report in May 30, 1985.
The Dornbusch Report found "more
political diversity at Hoover than the
stereotype allows for" and claimed that
no clear indication of institutional ideol
ogy existed at Hoover.
However, Dornbusch admitted that
the report's goal was not to evaluate
Hoover's political stance, and that the
committee did not have time to read
over the many Hoover publications
printed each year.
In addition, the Dornbusch Commit
tee assuaged fears that Hoover pres
sured its members to eschew certain po
litical ideologies and support others. The
committee also found evidence that po
tential scholars were screened to deter
mine their political affiliations.
But, like the Ward report, the
Dornbusch report recognized the
animosity that had surfaced over the
previous few years and placed part of
the blame on Hoover.
"We do not believe that Hoover's
pride in its political influence is de facto
evidence of institutional partisanship. At
the same time, we would agree that this
pride has sometimes been so blatantly
expressed as to stimulate antagonism on
campus."
The report made nine recommended
changes to promote cooperation and im
prove the relationship between Stanford
and Hoover. One of the recommenda
tions called for advisory groups to
review the qualifications of senior fel
lows before they are appointed to
Hoover.
Although admitting that divorce "is
not a desirable way to end the strains in
[Hoover and Stanford's] marriage," the
Dornbusch Report suggested that "if
events in the next several years do not
bring about great amity, divorce should
be reconsidered."
Kennedy praised the Dornbusch Com
mittee as having done "a very conscien
tious, helpful job," and the Faculty Sen
ate endorsed the report by a vote of 29 to
1.
Campbell, however, criticized the
committee's proposals, charging that
their call for increased governance over
Hoover threatened to "destroy the
unique and independent status of the
Hoover Institution."
Six weeks after the release of the

Dornbusch Report, 40 Hoover fellows
formally responded with a statement re
jecting all nine recommendations as
either repetitious, unnecessary or in
violation of long-standing agreements
between Stanford and the think tank.
In the midst of both reports, however,
an issue emerged that would prove to be
the most divisive of all: the proposal to
build the Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary on the Stanford campus.

The anomalous relation
ship of the Hoover Insti
tution to the University
— at the same time a
part of Stanford but
legally and operationally
enjoying almost com
plete and permanent
autonomy — makes
some conflict practically
inevitable.' — the Ward
Report, 1984

In October 1981, Campbell invited
Reagan in a personal memo to "have
your Presidential Library on the Stan
ford campus. . . Concern immedi
ately arose after the University made
public its knowledge of the invitation
and later gave its approval. Further,
many were disturbed to learn that in ad
dition to the library, a museum and a
Ronald Reagan Center for Public Affairs
were planned.
The public affairs center was to have
included a visiting fellows program, in
which scholars from a wide variety of
disciplines would conduct research and
discuss various public policy issues.
Location and design of the library, as
well as the question of academic gover
nance of the public affairs center, were
both contentious issues.
In February, 1984, the University and

the White House reached a compromise
that confirmed that the acceptance of the
library would he "independent" of any
public affairs center.
A year later both parties agreed upon
a site, 20 acres off Junipero Serra
Boulevard in the Foothills. Later, 350()
area residents expressed opposition to
the proposed site by presenting a peti
tion to Kennedy in December 1986.
Charges of partisanship again
surfaced, this time in reference to the
statement made by Campbell in
Hoover's 1986 annual report that the
entire University can "boast" of its
"Reagan connection." The Faculty Sen
ate in February of this year unanimously
criticized the comments. Two months
later, tlte Faculty Senate asked the Stan
ford trustees to either scale down the fa
cility or move it further from the center
of campus.
The request proved to be unneces
sary. On April 23, the Reagan Presiden
tial Foundation, citing its desire to have
the public affairs center adjacent to the
library, withdrew its request to build the
library at Stanford.
But the Ward and Dornbusch Reports
and the Reagan Library have not been
the only sources of conflict.
In 1985 James Stockdale, a senior re
search fellow at Hoover, charged that a
course he co-taught in the philosophy
department had been dropped due to his
ties with Hoover. The same year seven
students painted a controversial mural of
Hoover Tower in Casa Zapata, a paint
ing which implied that Hoover had ties
to repression in the third world. In 1986
two Hoover fellows were asked to par
ticipate in a controversial AIDS research
project.
However, since the withdrawal of the
Reagan Library proposal, feuding be
tween Stanford and Hoover appears to
have diminished.
Partially as a result of the proposals of
the Dornbusch Report, an ad hoc com
mittee of Stanford faculty members and
Hoover fellows reviews potential
Hoover appointments. In an effort to
reduce tension, dialogue established
after the Dornbusch Report between
John Cogan, associate director at
Hoover, and James Rosse, University
provost, continues. Although un
resolved issues remain, no openly con
tentious disagreements exist.
