## An uneasy marriage: Hoover and Stanford 
### Joe Metcalfe 
This is the first article in a series on the
relationship between the Hoover Institu
tion and Stanford. The next installment
will appear one week from today.

It is ironic that the 285-foot Hoover
Tower, although the most familiar
landmark on Stanford's campus, is part
of an institution technically removed
from the University.

Indeed, the uneasy marriage between
Stanford University and the Hoover In
stitution on War, Revolution and Peace
has proven over the past 25 years to he an
issue surrounded by controversy.
Critics excoriate the Hoover Institu
tion as a conservative think tank with a
political mission that threatens to damage
Stanford's national reputation and politi
cal neutrality.
Hoover's defenders praise it as an in
fluential and well-respected institution
devoted to advanced research and schol
arship in domestic and international af
fairs.

A history of controversies has influ
enced the nature of the relationship be
tween the Institution and the University.
As the memory of the Reagan Library
fades, this current period of relative calm
provides the opportunity to review the re
lationship between the University and
Hoover and look toward its future.
In this decade, controversy over this
relationship has primarily centered
around the release of the Ward and Dom
busch reports on Stanford-Hoover rela
tions and around the planned building of
the Reagan Library on Stanford's
campus.
Although Hoover was a center of con
troversy during the '60s and the '70s, the
event that has sparked the greatest al
tercations of this decade had little to do
with either Stanford or Hoover: the elec
tion of Ronald Reagan to the presidency
of the United States.
Reagan, who was named honorary fel
low at Hoover in 1975, has always main
tained ties with the institution and most
notably with W. Glenn Campbell,
Hoover's director since 1960.
Speaking immediately after the 1980
election at a banquet in honor of the insti
tution's Board of Overseers, Reagan said
he "had called on more people from the
(Hoover) Institution to help with my cam
paign than from any other institution."
