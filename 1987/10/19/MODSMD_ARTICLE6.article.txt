Stanford students "reached out" to the commu
nity Saturday through a variety of public service
projects including blazing trails, visiting convales
cent homes and hosting field days.
Over 1000 students participated in Reach Out
loday, an annual one-day service event in which
living groups and student organizations take part in
community projects.
Reach Out Today is a four-year-old program
"designed to spark student interest in community
service and hopefully get them committed on a
long-term level," according to Patricia Barrera, di
rector of the Stanford Volunteer Network.
Among the volunteers were 25 Branner Hall resi
dents who traveled to the Stanford Hospital
pediatric ward to paint and spruce up a playhouse
and to host a party for the young patients.
Branner residents came equipped with markers,
crayons, cookies and music, but only five children
were well enough to come to the party. Small
groups of students went room to room, singing,
playing guitars and performing magic tricks for
those too sick to attend, according to Branner Resi
dent Assistant Julie Lythcott.
"It was a great experience, but when we came
back people were really quiet," Lythcott said.
"We saw some really sick children, and it opened
our eyes to reality,"

Ujamaa and Eucalypto aided the Ecumenical
Hunger Program in hosting "A Day in the Park," a
field day and barbecue held at East Palo Alto's Bell
