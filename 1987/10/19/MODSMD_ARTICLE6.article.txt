Stanford students "reached out" to the commu
nity Saturday through a variety of public service
projects including blazing trails, visiting convales
cent homes and hosting field days.
Over 1000 students participated in Reach Out
loday, an annual one-day service event in which
living groups and student organizations take part in
community projects.
Reach Out Today is a four-year-old program
"designed to spark student interest in community
service and hopefully get them committed on a
long-term level," according to Patricia Barrera, di
rector of the Stanford Volunteer Network.
Among the volunteers were 25 Branner Hall resi
dents who traveled to the Stanford Hospital
pediatric ward to paint and spruce up a playhouse
and to host a party for the young patients.
Branner residents came equipped with markers,
crayons, cookies and music, but only five children
were well enough to come to the party. Small
groups of students went room to room, singing,
playing guitars and performing magic tricks for
those too sick to attend, according to Branner Resi
dent Assistant Julie Lythcott.
"It was a great experience, but when we came
back people were really quiet," Lythcott said.
"We saw some really sick children, and it opened
our eyes to reality,"

Hunger Program in hosting "A Day in the Park," a
field day and barbecue held at East Palo Alto's Bell

Recreation Center.
Twenty-seven children, rang
ing in age from five to nine,
played kickball and duck-duck
goose there before heading over
to a Roble Hall-sponsored car
nival at Brentwood School.
"I've never really seen East
Palo Alto before, and I was really
struck by the extreme difference
between Palo Alto and East Palo
Alto," said LaDonna Walker,
Ujamaa's community service
representative.
"No one was really interested
in getting up at 9:30 in the morn
ing, but we ended up having a lot
of fun," she said.
One of the most highly atten
ded events was trailblazing at
Stevens Creek County Park.
Residents of Escondido Village
and Serra, Twain, Kairos, Larkin
and Crothers Memorial Halls
joined forces to help dig out part
of a hiking trail through the
poison oak-covered woodlands
alongside Stevens Creek Reser
voir.
In its first year, Reach Out
Today was held quarterly, but
the Volunteer Network later
decided to limit the event to once
a year.
"Our goal is for a long-term
partnership between students
and the community," Barrera

said. "We aren't interested in a
one-shot deal.
"Reach Out Today serves two
purposes," Barrera added. "We
hope it will be an opportunity for
education and for learning about
different issues, as well as an op
portunity to help the commu
nity."

Thanh-Van Nguyen, one of 11
Burbank residents to visit Chan
ney House retirement home,
viewed her participation in the
event as a learning experience.
"I had always thought of old
people as another race, almost.
They sometimes can't under
stand us."
