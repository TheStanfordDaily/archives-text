U.S. will respond to attacks
WASHINGTON — As Iran revealed a new U.N. effort to ar
range a cease-fire in the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War, President
Reagan told reporters yesterday that he has reached a decision
on how to respond to Tehran's attacks on U.S.-flagged vessels
in the Persian Gulf.
The Iranian move took the form of an announcement that
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar will return to
the war-racked region to try again to reach a cease-fire formula
acceptable to both belligerents. Iran's deputy foreign minister,
Ali Mohammed Besharati, reported the plan in an interview
with the official Iranian news agency.
According to Besharati, Perez de Cuellar has been given
"new elbow room" by the U.N. Security Council in his efforts
to arrange implementation of Council Resolution 598, which
was adopted July 20 and calls for an immediate cease-fire in the
Persian Gulf conflict.
Reagan commented during a brief exchange with reporters as
he returned to the White House following a visit to his wife, who
is recuperating from surgery at the Bethesda Naval Medical
Center. Asked if he planned to make a decision this week on op
tions for dealing with Iran, he grinned broadly and replied, "I've
made it."
Reagan turned down requests for amplification, observing,
"If I told you, then they (the Iranians) would know."
Senator cites witness intimidation
WASHINGTON — Sen. Gordon Humphrey (R-N.H.) called
yesterday for an investigation by the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee to determine whether a black law professor was intimidated
from testifying last month in favor of Judge Robert Bork's nomi
nation to the Supreme Court.
The professor, John Baker of the Indiana University Law
School, decided not to testify as scheduled Sept. 28 after a
phone call from Linda Greene, a lawyer appointed to the Senate
Judiciary Committee staff last year by Sen. Howard Metzen
baum (D-Ohio). The incident, in which she warned Baker that
his appearance might turn into a painful ordeal, was reported
yesterday in The New York Times.
Greene said yesterday that she made the call to advise a
friend, not as any attempt at intimidation, and Metzenbaum said
Humphrey's statement merely shows that the pro-Bork forces
are desperate as Bork's nomination awaits a final vote on the
Senate floor.
Baker, who resigned last year as dean of the Howard Univer
sity Law School after expressing dissatisfaction with educa
tional standards, did not return phone calls yesterday. But in a
letter last week to Metzenbaum, he took "complete responsibil
ity for my decision" not to testify. He said he took the step after
conferring with "people supporting and opposing" the Bork
nomination "concerning both the risks and benefits of testify
ing."
India continues Sri Lankan assault
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — After a week of fierce fighting
against outnumbered Tamil Tiger guerrillas, Indian troops were
on the verge yesterday of encircling the northern city of Jaffna
and cutting off Tiger supply lines on the Indian Ocean, officials
said here and in New Delhi.
Indian forces captured the headquarters of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam at Kapay North, just outside of Jaffna,
state-owned All India Radio was quoted as saying from New
Delhi. Large quantities of arms and ammunition were seized at
the headquarters, the report said.
Columns of Indian troops, bolstered by at least 2000 rein
forcements yesterday, pushed toward each other from east and
west along coastal roads, hoping to link in the next few days and
sever the guerrillas' vital access to the sea, Indian spokesmen
said.
"Eastern and western prongs are now poised to link up with
the besieged Jaffna fort," an official spokesman told journalists
in New Delhi.
"The Liberation Tigers . . . are trying desperately to move
arms and ammunition into Jaffna ."
Deaver jury selection begins again
WASHINGTON — Selection of a jury for the perjury trial of
former White House aide Michael Deaver will begin anew this
morning after a three-month delay.
The former close confidant of President Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, faces five charges of lying under oath about his lobbying
activities after he left the White House — both to a congres
sional committee and to a federal grand jury last year.
Although charges of peijury are nothing new to officials in
Washington, Deaver's defense will be. Under a ruling handed
down earlier this month by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, Deaver's lawyers will be allowed to present evidence
that Deaver's mind may have been clouded from excessive
drinking.
"This could be a classic Washington case," one government
official said recently. "Everyone knows that lots of lying and
lots of drinking goes on in the nation's capital. But no one ever
realized the two were connected."
The case also is unusual because there are no so-called
"substantive charges." Deaver is not charged with any direct
violation of federal ethics or conflict-of-interest law — only with
lying about his actions.
Defense lawyers are expected to seize on this anomaly, telling
the jury, in effect: If Deaver did not violate any lobbying rules,
why would he lie about what he did? The answer, they will
assert, is that he never intended to lie but only gave inaccurate
answers to investigators because his memory was impaired by
alcoholism.
British tabloid shows spicy nudes
LONDON — Explicit pictures and racy headlines in Britain's
tabloid newspapers are not new. But even hardened London
tabloid readers and advertisers were not prepared for what they
saw when one paper, Daily Star, recently began printing daily
photos of nude women — on nearly every page. Most of the
photos focus on breasts.
Tesco, Britain's giant supermarket chain, pulled all its adver
tising from the Star two weeks after its new editor, Michael Tab
bert, spiced up the paper to better compete in London's frenetic
newspaper market.
Tesco said the newspaper constitutes an insult to women —
and, therefore, to most British supermarket shoppers.
Woolworth's and two breweries, Whitbread and Carling, also
are considering canceling their advertising contracts with the
Star.
Commercial television stations considered rejecting a new se
ries of commercials touting the paper in its new format, but then
decided to continue to air the $3.16 million commercial package.
The thought that even broadcasters dependent on commercial
revenue were put off by the paper's new format apparently
scared the top echelons of the Star. Just after the television sta
tions announced their decision, Andrew Cameron, who heads
the Express Newspapers that owns the Star, said the newspaper
would tone things down.
