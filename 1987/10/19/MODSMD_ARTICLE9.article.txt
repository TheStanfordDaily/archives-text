WASHINGTON â€” Nancy
Reagan's malignancy did not
spread beyond her left breast,
making prospects for a full
recovery virtually certain, final
test results showed yesterday.
"Mrs. Reagan is recovering
remarkably well from surgery,"
said Dr. John Hutton, the presi
dent's physician, in a statement
released by the White House.
"The medical team visited her
this morning, and we are satisfied
with her progress in every
respect."
Telling reporters that he "had
a date with a girl out at Bet
hesda," President Reagan

traveled by helicopter to Bet
hesda Naval Medical Center yes
terday morning to visit Mrs.
Reagan and await the test results.
He carried with him a gift of a
mirror the First Lady had once
admired, wrapped brightly in
red, white and blue.
Together, the couple
telephoned Chip and Reba
McClure, the parents of Jessica
McClure, to "express their
happiness" at Jessica's rescue
from her ordeal in an abandoned
well in Midland, Texas.
Hutton said final analysis of
tissue and lymph nodes removed
from Mrs. Reagan during a 50-

minute modified radical mastec
tomy on Saturday revealed that
there was no "further malig
nancy or evidence of other
disease." He said that other than
routine examinations, no further
treatment is envisioned.
Because the cancerous lesion
was only seven millimeters in
length, about a quarter of an
inch, medical experts had
predicted that it was unlikely to
have spread to her lymph nodes.
"This confirms all the best
hunches," said Dr. William Fel
ler, an associate professor of sur
gery at Georgetown University
Medical Center. "You couldn't

ask for a better prognosis. The
key result is that the malignancy
was not invasive."
Feller said that medical care
for Mrs. Reagan will probably
concentrate on arm exercises
over the next few weeks to
restore her arm muscles to nor
mal strength.
After that, Mrs. Reagan will
probably undergo mammograms
twice a year, doctors said. Elaine
Crispen, the First Lady's spokes
man, said that Mrs. Reagan
hoped her experience would
"encourage people to have early
exams."
