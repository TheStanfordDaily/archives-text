Fear and panic of historic propor
tions overwhelmed the stock market
yesterday, forcing the Dow Jones in
dustrial average to a stunning decline
of 508.32 points, by far its higgest one
day plunge in history.

Experts here at Stanford and around
the country cautioned, however, that
the economy remains essentially stable
and that the market will likely stabilize
soon.
The Dow Jones average lost nearly a
quarter of its value, nearly doubling the
percentage drop on Oct. 28, 1929, a
crash that preceded the Great Depres
sion. With yesterday's plunge, the
Dow has lost half the ground it has
gained since the bull market got under
way Aug. 12, 1982, when the Dow
stood at a mere 776.92.
The unprecedented dive in the Dow,
to a close of 1738.42, immediately trig
gered fears of an international eco
nomic crisis and a recession in the
United States.
Several Stanford professors reacted
with skepticism to such dire predic
tions. "Any tuiess about the eco

nomy's future is not particularly mean
ingful now," Asst. Economics Frot.
Steven Durlauf said. "We're dealing
with events that are very closely
attuned to psychology rather than eco
nomic fundamentals.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll echoed
Durlaufs thesis. Noll said there is
nothing in the performance of the
American economy to justify what has
happened to the stock market.
In Washington, President Reagan
said, "I think everyone is a little
puzzled. I don't know what meaning it
might have because all the business
indices are up. There is nothing wrong
with the economy."
Economics Prof. John Taylor
agreed. "The fundamentals in the eco
nomy are good: Inflation is low, unem
ployment is average and growth is
steady," he said, adding that only the
modest recent rise in interest rates may
have signaled this downturn.
Durlauf said that he too was puzzled.
"There was no compelling reason for
this," he said. He noted, however, that
given the market's sharp rise in recent
months it was "not shocking that any
one event — like Secretary of the Trea
sury (James) Baker's saying he was
going to force the dollar down —
should break the speculative bubble."'
"The president is right in saying the
economy is doing well," Economics
Prof. Kenneth Arrow said.
Arrow did warn, however, that
"even though these are only financial

matters, they could effect the eco
nomy. People feel poorer and could
spend less. Investors may get fright
ened."
Parallels to the Great Depression,
which was brought on by the stock
market crash of 1929, were inevitable
yesterday. Stanford professors,
though, were quick to discount predic
tions of another depression.
"I don't see any reason why we can
use a 1929 analogy in 1987," Noll said.
He explained that the behavior of the
