# Stock market tumbles over 500 points
## 
### Keith Nashawaty Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff With wire reports 
Fear and panic of historic propor
tions overwhelmed the stock market
yesterday, forcing the Dow Jones in
dustrial average to a stunning decline
of 508.32 points, by far its higgest one
day plunge in history.

See related story, page 2

Experts here at Stanford and around
the country cautioned, however, that
the economy remains essentially stable
and that the market will likely stabilize
soon.
The Dow Jones average lost nearly a
quarter of its value, nearly doubling the
percentage drop on Oct. 28, 1929, a
crash that preceded the Great Depres
sion. With yesterday's plunge, the
Dow has lost half the ground it has
gained since the bull market got under
way Aug. 12, 1982, when the Dow
stood at a mere 776.92.
The unprecedented dive in the Dow,
to a close of 1738.42, immediately trig
gered fears of an international eco
nomic crisis and a recession in the
United States.
Several Stanford professors reacted
with skepticism to such dire predic
tions. "Any tuiess about the eco

nomy's future is not particularly mean
ingful now," Asst. Economics Frot.
Steven Durlauf said. "We're dealing
with events that are very closely
attuned to psychology rather than eco
nomic fundamentals.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll echoed
Durlaufs thesis. Noll said there is
nothing in the performance of the
American economy to justify what has
happened to the stock market.
In Washington, President Reagan
said, "I think everyone is a little
puzzled. I don't know what meaning it
might have because all the business
indices are up. There is nothing wrong
with the economy."
Economics Prof. John Taylor
agreed. "The fundamentals in the eco
nomy are good: Inflation is low, unem
ployment is average and growth is
steady," he said, adding that only the
modest recent rise in interest rates may
have signaled this downturn.
Durlauf said that he too was puzzled.
"There was no compelling reason for
this," he said. He noted, however, that
given the market's sharp rise in recent
months it was "not shocking that any
one event — like Secretary of the Trea
sury (James) Baker's saying he was
going to force the dollar down —
should break the speculative bubble."'
"The president is right in saying the
economy is doing well," Economics
Prof. Kenneth Arrow said.
Arrow did warn, however, that
"even though these are only financial

matters, they could effect the eco
nomy. People feel poorer and could
spend less. Investors may get fright
ened."
Parallels to the Great Depression,
which was brought on by the stock
market crash of 1929, were inevitable
yesterday. Stanford professors,
though, were quick to discount predic
tions of another depression.
"I don't see any reason why we can
use a 1929 analogy in 1987," Noll said.
He explained that the behavior of the


Dow Jones Industrial Average
stock market is no longer an ac
curate indicator of the economy.
Arrow was quick to avoid the
analogy as well. "1 hope and
think that the stability of the fi
nancial system is not affected
like in 1929. There have been
several changes in legislation that
all will help insulate the banks
from the fall in the market," he
said.
Many in the Economics De
partment cited investor psychol
ogy as the main reason for yes
terday's decline. "This drop says
more about the volatility of ex
pectations than it does about the
state of the current economy,"
Durlauf said.
Noll, too, said psychology
played a role in yesterday's mar
ket drop. "The only way von err
justify U'»w is it you
expected a massive worldwide
recession."
Noll added that he believed an
upturn in the market was likely in
the near future. He said that
"patience is called for" and
stressed that the biggest mistake
an investor could make would be
to sell now, while the market is
near the bottom.
William Massy, University
vice president for Business and
Finance, also said he sees the po
tential for a significant market
recovery in the near future.
"Subsequent weeks could see
rises of two to three hundred
points a day,"he said.
Yesterday's decline alone
wiped out $503 billion in the mar
ket value of all stocks. A total of
about $1 trillion in stock market
wealth has been erased since the
market peaked Aug. 25, as mea

sured by Wilshire Associates of
Los Angeles.
Japanese and other foreign in
vestors, who helped drive the
bull market's rapid rise of the
past five years, unloaded stocks
en masse yesterday, triggering
worries that they might also pull
money out of other U.S. invest
ments.
Yesterday's collapse shattered
the previous one-day point drop
in the Dow average of 108.35, set
last Friday. Yesterday's drop
equalled a decline of 22.62 per
cent, busting the previous high
est percentage declines of 12.8
percent on Oct. 28, 1929, and
11.7 percent the following day.
Since Aug. 25, when the Dow
average hit a record 2,722.42, the
index has declined 984 points, or
36.15 percent.
The collapse came on dizzying
trading volume of 604.4 million,
nearly double the previous
record of 338.5 million shares,
~!so set Friday.
The crash led many experts to
declare the five-year-old bull
market dead and buried. "It's
over," said A. Marshall Acuff
Jr., portfolio strategist for the in
vestment house Smith Barney,
Harris Upham.
Also contributing to yester
day's sudden drop were escalat
ing international tensions follow
ing a U.S. retaliatory attack
against an Iranian oil platform in
the Persian Gulf. That triggered a
sharp rise yesterday in prices of
gold and silver.
Declining issues swamped ad
vances by nearly 50-1 on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Losers among the big-name
stocks included International
Business Machines, down $33
per share to close at $102; Digital
Equipment, down $42.25 to close
at $130; Eastman Kodak, down
$27.25 to finish at $62,875; and
Citicorp, down $16.125 to $37.

ments.
Yesterday's collapse shattered
the previous one-day point drop
in the Dow average of 108.35, set
last Friday. Yesterday's drop
equalled a decline of 22.62 per
cent, busting the previous high
est percentage declines of 12.8
percent on Oct. 28, 1929, and
11.7 percent the following day.
Since Aug. 25, when the Dow
average hit a record 2,722.42, the
index has declined 984 points, or
36.15 percent.
The collapse came on dizzying
trading volume of 604.4 million,
nearly double the previous
record of 338.5 million shares,
~!so set Friday.
The crash led many experts to
declare the five-year-old bull
market dead and buried. "It's
over," said A. Marshall Acuff
Jr., portfolio strategist for the in
vestment house Smith Barney,
Harris Upham.
Also contributing to yester
day's sudden drop were escalat
ing international tensions follow
ing a U.S. retaliatory attack
against an Iranian oil platform in
the Persian Gulf. That triggered a
sharp rise yesterday in prices of
gold and silver.
Declining issues swamped ad
vances by nearly 50-1 on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Losers among the big-name
stocks included International
Business Machines, down $33
per share to close at $102; Digital
Equipment, down $42.25 to close
at $130; Eastman Kodak, down
$27.25 to finish at $62,875; and
Citicorp, down $16.125 to $37.
Fear and panic of historic propor
tions overwhelmed the stock market
yesterday, forcing the Dow Jones in
dustrial average to a stunning decline
of 508.32 points, by far its higgest one
day plunge in history.

Experts here at Stanford and around
the country cautioned, however, that
the economy remains essentially stable
and that the market will likely stabilize
soon.
The Dow Jones average lost nearly a
quarter of its value, nearly doubling the
percentage drop on Oct. 28, 1929, a
crash that preceded the Great Depres
sion. With yesterday's plunge, the
Dow has lost half the ground it has
gained since the bull market got under
way Aug. 12, 1982, when the Dow
stood at a mere 776.92.
The unprecedented dive in the Dow,
to a close of 1738.42, immediately trig
gered fears of an international eco
nomic crisis and a recession in the
United States.
Several Stanford professors reacted
with skepticism to such dire predic
tions. "Any tuiess about the eco

nomy's future is not particularly mean
ingful now," Asst. Economics Frot.
Steven Durlauf said. "We're dealing
with events that are very closely
attuned to psychology rather than eco
nomic fundamentals.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll echoed
Durlaufs thesis. Noll said there is
nothing in the performance of the
American economy to justify what has
happened to the stock market.
In Washington, President Reagan
said, "I think everyone is a little
puzzled. I don't know what meaning it
might have because all the business
indices are up. There is nothing wrong
with the economy."
Economics Prof. John Taylor
agreed. "The fundamentals in the eco
nomy are good: Inflation is low, unem
ployment is average and growth is
steady," he said, adding that only the
modest recent rise in interest rates may
have signaled this downturn.
Durlauf said that he too was puzzled.
"There was no compelling reason for
this," he said. He noted, however, that
given the market's sharp rise in recent
months it was "not shocking that any
one event — like Secretary of the Trea
sury (James) Baker's saying he was
going to force the dollar down —
should break the speculative bubble."'
"The president is right in saying the
economy is doing well," Economics
Prof. Kenneth Arrow said.
Arrow did warn, however, that
"even though these are only financial

matters, they could effect the eco
nomy. People feel poorer and could
spend less. Investors may get fright
ened."
Parallels to the Great Depression,
which was brought on by the stock
market crash of 1929, were inevitable
yesterday. Stanford professors,
though, were quick to discount predic
tions of another depression.
"I don't see any reason why we can
use a 1929 analogy in 1987," Noll said.
He explained that the behavior of the


Dow Jones Industrial Average
stock market is no longer an ac
curate indicator of the economy.
Arrow was quick to avoid the
analogy as well. "1 hope and
think that the stability of the fi
nancial system is not affected
like in 1929. There have been
several changes in legislation that
all will help insulate the banks
from the fall in the market," he
said.
Many in the Economics De
partment cited investor psychol
ogy as the main reason for yes
terday's decline. "This drop says
more about the volatility of ex
pectations than it does about the
state of the current economy,"
Durlauf said.
Noll, too, said psychology
played a role in yesterday's mar
ket drop. "The only way von err
justify U'»w is it you
expected a massive worldwide
recession."
Noll added that he believed an
upturn in the market was likely in
the near future. He said that
"patience is called for" and
stressed that the biggest mistake
an investor could make would be
to sell now, while the market is
near the bottom.
William Massy, University
vice president for Business and
Finance, also said he sees the po
tential for a significant market
recovery in the near future.
"Subsequent weeks could see
rises of two to three hundred
points a day,"he said.
Yesterday's decline alone
wiped out $503 billion in the mar
ket value of all stocks. A total of
about $1 trillion in stock market
wealth has been erased since the
market peaked Aug. 25, as mea

sured by Wilshire Associates of
Los Angeles.
Japanese and other foreign in
vestors, who helped drive the
bull market's rapid rise of the
past five years, unloaded stocks
en masse yesterday, triggering
worries that they might also pull
money out of other U.S. invest
