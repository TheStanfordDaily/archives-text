"It was a gut-wrenching day, a
terrible day," moaned Michael
Meer, a broker and trader for
Haas Securities in New York
who took shelter at a Wall Street
bar after the market's close.
"I'm very nervous about tomor
row. This may be the end of the
yuppie era."
At the scene of the debacle in

New York's financial district,
crowds caught up in the frenzy
that pervaded the area queued up
at the visitors entrance of the
New York Stock Exchange on
Broad Street. "We were just
going to have lunch but thought
this might be a historic occa
sion," said Margaret Thomas of
Delray Beach, Fla. "Has
anybody jumped yet?"
Two British women overheard
a conversation about the stock
market crash in a Woolworth
store in New York and decided
to head off for some stock ex
change sightseeing. "To see it at
its best, or at its worst, as it

were," said Sally Penn of Bris
tol. "We picked a good day
anyway, didn't we?"
By 5:30 p.m., the New York
Police Department had dis
patched officers to control the
crowds jamming the Wall Street
district.
After the market closed,
brokers scattered to bars to share
the misery. At Harry's at the
American Stock Exchange
(renamed Harry's at the Late
American Stock Exchange by a
cynical broker), a hangout in
back of the exchange on Green
wich, brokers cut the tension
with gallows humor.

"You see a lot of people laugh
ing in here, not because they
think it's funny, but you have to
laugh and have to hope that the
future will be better," said one
broker.
Five young Dean Witter
trainees standing around the bar
had just finished an 18-week
training program that was de
signed to prime them to start
work next Monday. "Everyone
thinks the market's very
glamorous," said one. "Now,
we're going to have to make cold
calls to the general public, which
has no confidence."
