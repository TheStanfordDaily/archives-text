# Stanford, schools unite
## Program to bridge gap between teachers, scholars 
### Angle Kim 
The Stanford School of Edu
cation. in alliance with four lo
cal school districts, will launch
a program this year to increase
communication between Stan
ford researchers and local
teachers.
leachers and researchers
began planning for the program
last year in an effort to resolve
misunderstandings that some
times develop between teach
ers, who often comment that
researchers are not aware of
the realities of education, and
academics, who sometimes
comment that teachers do not
pay attention to their education
research.
The program will involve
school districts covering Palo
Alto, Redwood City, San
Mateo, Mountain View and Los
Altos. Offices will be estab
lished at the Stanford School of
Education and in each of the
school districts. The sites will
be known collectively as the
Professional Development
Center.
"This center will provide our
researchers, graduate students
and faculty members with a
place where contact can be
made with the real educational
process out there," said Lynda
Greene, director of the
Stanford-Schools Col
laborative, a School of Educa
tion project that promotes
cooperation between the Uni
versity and area schools.
It's going to be a partner

ship between us and the local
schools. We're going to at
tempt to solve problems and
aid each other together,"
Greene said. "It will benefit
Stanford tremendously."
T he teachers and researchers
conducted a pilot program over
the summer to test the potential
of the project. This two-week
program brought researchers
together with both new and vet
eran teachers to experiment
with different methods of
teaching.
"It was a real success, and I
th'e real program
worlcs out as well," Greene
said.
Paul Sakamoto, superintend
ent of the Mountain View-Los
Altos School District, said that
the "immediate goal of the cen
ter is to act as a center for
teachers from the four districts
and help each other to become
better teachers — veterans as
well as beginners — with the
help of Stanford faculty and
graduate students."
The program grew out of the
Study of Stanford in Schools, a
School of Education project in
itiated four years ago in order
to develop partnership between
Stanford research facilities and
local schools.
"The Professional Develop
ment Center is something that
we've wanted to do for a long
time but couldn't because of fi
nancial difficulties," Greene
said. "The Packard grant
changed that."
The Packard Foundation

decided early this year to give a
grant of $265,614 to the pro
gram over a period of three
years.
In addition, the University
has decided to grant more than
$120,(MM) to the project.
A committee composed of
representatives from the four
districts and Stanford will meet
next week to decide where the
first site will be built. The com
mittee plans to build the other
three sites in the next three
and-a-half years. Sakamoto
said the first site will probably
be in Palo Alto, since it is
closest to Stanford and at the
center of the four districts.

k My hope is that it will
. . . stimulate interac
tion between teachers,
administrators and re
searchers/

Nicholas Gennaro, superin
tendant of the San Mateo
School District, said the pro
gram will he focused on the lo
cal districts during the school
year so that "teachers will be
able to take the researchers'
ideas and try it out right there
with the students."
During the summer, the
focus will be at Stanford, where
many lectures, seminars and
workshops for teachers, admin
istrators and researchers will
take place.
