# Guatemalan urges reform

### Sean Kinch 
Massive economic restructuring will he neces
sary to stem the tide of unrest and insurgency in
Central America, a Guatemalan journalist said here
yesterday.
"If you don't establish a new domestic economic
order within each Central American country for the
distribution of wealth, you're going to continue to
have the same problems that gave rise to the (past
Central American) insurgencies," according to
Ricardo Wilson-Grau, managing director of
Guatemala's Inforpress Centroamericana
He said three methods for redistribution of
wealth are land reform, increased wages for
laborers and increased government subsidies for
health, education and housing.
Because of fear of reprisal by the Guatemalan
government if his comments were misinterpreted,
Wilson-Grau would not allow much of his talk to be
reported.
Wilson-Grau told an audience of 32 people that
he approved of the stability the recent Central
American Peace Initiative might provide govern
ments in the region, but added that he had some
major concerns about the long-term future of the
region.
He said that although the plan calls for the elimi
nation of military aggression, "we may very well
be in the eye of a hurricane."
"We (Inforpress) suspect that now the military
solution is precluded for the Reagan administra
tion, they will adopt a maxim used by a Nicaraguan
general, who speaks of politics being an extension
of war," Wilson-Grau said.
He also said Central America will continue to be
hurt by "the inequity of the international market."
As an example, he pointed out that the income
from the exports of agrarian countries is reduced
by protective duties imposed by industrial nations.
He added that the relative value of Central
American agricultural products vs. products im
ported from the United States has been decreasing
for many years.
Because of this trend, Wilson-Grau said. Central
American countries must export proportionately
more to maintain the same balance of trade. Many
countries in the region, however, have been unable
to attain such a balance, he said.

If the terms of trade continue to decline, and
there is not a major effort made to create a new in
ternational economic order, the prospects of
stability and long-term development (in Central
America) are questionable," he said.
Wilson-Grau added that Central America experi
enced steady economic growth in the 1960s and
19705, but little of the wealth trickeld down to the
lower classes.
Citing a study conducted by the United Nations
in the early 1980s, Wilson-Grau said there has been
"no significant impact on poverty (in Central
America) despite 20 years of growth."
Wilson-Grau said he did not believe the govern
ments of C entral America are true democracies,
but said that he hopes they will evolve in that direc
tion.
"A democracy has to be measured by the
majority of the population having the ability to par
ticipate in the day-to-day decisions that are affect
ing their lives and not just once every four or five
years," Wilson-Grau said.
