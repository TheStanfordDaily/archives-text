The University's Commission on Minority Is
sues convenes today for the first time to study
ethnic minority life at Stanford. Before the larger
task at hand becomes obscured by deliberations
over particulars, we should pause to consider
the commission's proper function and objec
tives.
The commission was established by the Uni
versity in direct response to lobbying on the part
of the Rainbow Agenda coalition of minority
groups last spring. The commission is composed
in part of students hand-picked by the various
Rainbow Agenda groups. It will therefore un
doubtedly devote considerable time to studying
the "demands" of the Rainbow Agenda, includ
ing increased minority enrollment and greater
minority representation on the faculty and in the
curriculum.
Althought these issues certainly deserve the
commission's attention, it will hopefully inter
pret its purpose more broadly than to simply ad
dress matters presented by the Rainbow
Agenda.
The commission is in a unique position to con
duct a comprehensive, thoughtful and dispas
sionate study of all aspects of minority life at
Stanford. It ought to seize the opportunity to do
so.

Among the issues that merit examination are
minority attrition rates, the necessity and availa
bility or special counseling and advising services
for minorities, police harrassment of minority
students, discrimination by employers recruiting
at Stanford and treatment of minority staff
employees.
The commission should also squarely address
the matter of racial and ethnic self-segregation
on campus, illustrated, for example, by the exis
tence of theme houses and all-minority (or all
white) fraternities. Self-segregation may not be
an issue that the Rainbow Agenda coalition
would like to see examined, but it is one that
demands scrutiny if the commission's study is to
be comprehensive.
Finally, the commission should formulate a
scholarly methodology for its study. It should
use as guides similar studies conducted at other
universities; this would help ensure the validity
and credibility of its findings.
The Commission on Minority Issues has the
opportunity to conduct a thorough study and ex
amination of matters that for too long have en
gendered rhetoric but have eluded careful
scrutiny. Hopefully the commission will be able
to meet this challenge and provide an intelligent
and compelling blueprint for University action.
