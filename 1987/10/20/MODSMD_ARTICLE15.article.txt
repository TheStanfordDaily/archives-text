# The 						bottom line at Stanford, Inc.
## 
### 
In today's society, universities are thought
of differently from corporations.
This may have been appropriate 200 years
ago when universities were smaller and had
fewer outside interests. H6wever, it is cer
tainly not true now. Stanford University has
a $250 million budget, and is one of the larg
est employers in the county. With the Stan
ford Shopping Center, the Stanford Industrial
Park and the faculty ghetto, it is also a
landlord.

Like any corporation, Stanford must main
tain a satisfactory balance sheet or it will go
out of business. Unlike most corporations,
however, Stanford's goal is not to make a
profit. Unfortunately, exactly what its goals
are is not so clear. Certainly, its goals include
educating students as well as possible and ex
panding the world's stock of knowledge.
Many would argue that the University exists,
in part, to further some set of social, religious
or political goals. Even at Stanford, there is
little agreement on the relative importance of
these goals. They are rarelv prioritized. This
allows everyone a certain freedom to choose
their own goals as they see fit, within certain
limits. While this freedom has some very
good consequences, it also has some bad side
effects. It allows administrators to get away
with doing a poor job on many things. If a

project fails, it is often possible for an admin
istrator to obscure the project's goals to make
it seem effective. Worse, there is little con
sideration of cost vs. benefit. Many projects
are just plain wasteful and inefficient.
A good example of this appeared in an arti
cle in last Thursday's Daily ("Labor costs
lead to high prices"), in which Food Service
Manager James Keeton explained that Stan
ford's food service costs more because it is
based on small dining halls, which are more
expensive to run. However, he neglected to
compare food service with many of the small
campus self-ops that are quite a bit cheaper
than Stanford Food Service. And, even if
Stanford food service is better, is it two-and
a-half times better than Tufts University to
match the 2-to-l cost ratio?
Unfortunately, at Stanford the tendency is
toward inefficiency rather than efficiency. In
a normal, profit-making corporation, an oper
ation is judged by its bottom line: the profit
and loss statement.
One way to increase profit is to cut excess
costs. A manager who shows a law profit
will be rewarded and promoted. At Stanford,
the opposite is true. Profit and loss are not
considered. The way to succeed as a Stanford
administrator is to have a lot of people
working for you and to control a large budget.
Thus, the more "services" an administrator
can provide, no matter how financially ineffi
cient, the more important he will appear.
There is little incentive to do things effi
ciently; it just reduces your budget.
What are the effects of this empire build
ing? Well, the main effect is that Stanford
spends ever more monev. Some of the money
is well spent; some or it is wasted. When
something is built, it tends to be bigger and
more grandiose than it otherwise would be.

And there is a tendency for projects to be
judged on the basis of their political and bu
reaucratic support, rather than on their
utility. The worst inherent consequence is
that more money is spent, and this money has
to come from somewhere.
A lot of it comes from students, via tuition
and fees. More comes from generous alumni
or from corporate donors.
Financial pressure will eventually affect
Stanford. It is hard to see how Stanford can
significantly increase its income. Tuition is
already exorbitantly high and is increasing
significantly faster than the rate of inflation.
Stanford is already very good at getting
money from both alumni and corporations. It
would be poor financial practice to spend
money from the endowment witnout
prospects for its recovery.
So instead of increasing income, Stanford
will be forced to reduce expenses. When this
happens, politically weak groups are usually
the first to be cut, even if they are doing an
excellent job. One can only assume that this
is what happened with the cuts (fortunately,
now rescinded) in the music department
budget. Too often such decisions are made on
the basis of political power and bureaucratic
connections and without due regard to the
goals of the University.
Stanford must realize that its financial re
sources are limited. Instead of judging proj
ects on an "Is it worth doing?" basis,
proposals should be evaluated on the basis of
their relationship to prioritized University
goals, with strong attention to cost effective
ness.

This may have been appropriate 200 years
ago when universities were smaller and had
fewer outside interests. H6wever, it is cer
tainly not true now. Stanford University has
a $250 million budget, and is one of the larg
est employers in the county. With the Stan
ford Shopping Center, the Stanford Industrial
Park and the faculty ghetto, it is also a
landlord.

Like any corporation, Stanford must main
tain a satisfactory balance sheet or it will go
out of business. Unlike most corporations,
however, Stanford's goal is not to make a
profit. Unfortunately, exactly what its goals
are is not so clear. Certainly, its goals include
educating students as well as possible and ex
panding the world's stock of knowledge.
Many would argue that the University exists,
in part, to further some set of social, religious
or political goals. Even at Stanford, there is
little agreement on the relative importance of
these goals. They are rarelv prioritized. This
allows everyone a certain freedom to choose
their own goals as they see fit, within certain
limits. While this freedom has some very
good consequences, it also has some bad side
effects. It allows administrators to get away
with doing a poor job on many things. If a

project fails, it is often possible for an admin
istrator to obscure the project's goals to make
it seem effective. Worse, there is little con
sideration of cost vs. benefit. Many projects
are just plain wasteful and inefficient.
A good example of this appeared in an arti
cle in last Thursday's Daily ("Labor costs
lead to high prices"), in which Food Service
Manager James Keeton explained that Stan
ford's food service costs more because it is
based on small dining halls, which are more
expensive to run. However, he neglected to
compare food service with many of the small
campus self-ops that are quite a bit cheaper
than Stanford Food Service. And, even if
Stanford food service is better, is it two-and
a-half times better than Tufts University to
match the 2-to-l cost ratio?
Unfortunately, at Stanford the tendency is
toward inefficiency rather than efficiency. In
a normal, profit-making corporation, an oper
ation is judged by its bottom line: the profit
and loss statement.
One way to increase profit is to cut excess
costs. A manager who shows a law profit
will be rewarded and promoted. At Stanford,
the opposite is true. Profit and loss are not
considered. The way to succeed as a Stanford
administrator is to have a lot of people
working for you and to control a large budget.
Thus, the more "services" an administrator
can provide, no matter how financially ineffi
cient, the more important he will appear.
There is little incentive to do things effi
ciently; it just reduces your budget.
What are the effects of this empire build
ing? Well, the main effect is that Stanford
spends ever more monev. Some of the money
is well spent; some or it is wasted. When
something is built, it tends to be bigger and
more grandiose than it otherwise would be.

And there is a tendency for projects to be
judged on the basis of their political and bu
reaucratic support, rather than on their
utility. The worst inherent consequence is
that more money is spent, and this money has
to come from somewhere.
A lot of it comes from students, via tuition
and fees. More comes from generous alumni
or from corporate donors.
Financial pressure will eventually affect
Stanford. It is hard to see how Stanford can
significantly increase its income. Tuition is
already exorbitantly high and is increasing
significantly faster than the rate of inflation.
Stanford is already very good at getting
money from both alumni and corporations. It
would be poor financial practice to spend
money from the endowment witnout
prospects for its recovery.
So instead of increasing income, Stanford
will be forced to reduce expenses. When this
happens, politically weak groups are usually
the first to be cut, even if they are doing an
excellent job. One can only assume that this
is what happened with the cuts (fortunately,
now rescinded) in the music department
budget. Too often such decisions are made on
the basis of political power and bureaucratic
connections and without due regard to the
goals of the University.
Stanford must realize that its financial re
sources are limited. Instead of judging proj
ects on an "Is it worth doing?" basis,
proposals should be evaluated on the basis of
their relationship to prioritized University
goals, with strong attention to cost effective
ness.
