## Rainbow Agenda not 'Third World' 
### 
The charade has gone on long enough: As a
real Third World undergraduate at Stanford, I
should like to request that the Rainbow
Agenda, Stacey Leyton and other Americans
or almost-Americans stop calling themselves
"Third World" and stop representing their
concerns as the concerns of the Third World
in general.

Over the past two or so years, I have
noticed this nauseating behavior at Stanford.
But being a real, honest-to-goodness Third
Worlder who grew up in a high-humidity,
high-temperature, high-laziness country, I
did what came naturally: I did nothing and
hoped it would go away. The problem did not
go away, but I did spring quarter.
; Therefore, I was not here to witness the
worst of atrocities committed in the name of
the Third World. But now I see that a lot of
rioise is again emanating from these quarters.
Wake noise if you please, but do it in the
name of what you really stand for.
What is worst about these people is that
their ideologies and concerns are so patently
bourgeois-liberal, American style: liberty,
equality and fraternity, to put it in a nutshell.
Rights for homosexuals and all that. In the
real, non-mythical Third World their trite uni
versalism and rehashed humanism would
probably last as long as the ride to the nearest
jfcil at worst, or merely be ridiculed at best.
Their sheer fatuousness in claiming to repre
sent an entity that comprises billions of
people spread over five continents bespeaks
a once-charming quintessential American
characteristic: naivete.
; In reality, the peasant in Indonesia, the
rubber-tapper in Malaysia and the herder in

Kenya have just about nothing in common
beyond their relative poverty. There is no
beautiful universalism when one is looking to
survive. It has taken the incredible arrogance
and blindness of these middle-class
Americans to transpose their liberal ideas
into the realm of the Third World.
To begin with, "foreign students" is cer
tainly the group most discriminated against
where undergraduate admissions are con
cerned. Yet no one makes any noise about
this. The reason is that most of us are so poor
and have so little future earning capacity in
our home countries that Stanford has to sub
sidize us to the extent of $10,000 to $15,000 a
year. This is extremely expensive.
Stanford is one of the few U.S. universities
that can still afford to do this, and the number
of students that can be admitted on this basis
is necessarily limited. So for us, getting into
Stanford is even more significant than it is for
most U.S. citizens.
As such, we tend to make as much use of
our academic opportunities as possible, and
we also tend to go for the "useful" subjects:
science, engineering, economics. We do not
have time for frivolous activities such as pro
testing that our presence is not recognized
enough on campus; we just get on with our
work.
In general, we too are students of color,
but you do not hear too many foreign stu
dents clamorina to be on ASSU committees.
To put it bluntly, most of us are here to get
ahead and have no time for fooling around.
That is a luxury for middle-class American
students.
Finally, I should like to point out the incon
sistencies in these students' call for an expan
sion of the scope of the Western Culture pro
gram. As far as I am concerned, the most im
portant facet of the program is that all stu

dents go through a year-long sequence in the
humanities reading primary texts of great
books taught by competent teachers. To me,
it does not really matter if the required course
is Chinese culture, Indian culture or even
Western European culture, as long as there is
a body of great literature that can be taught in
a reasonably unified form. What matters is
that we should read great books and be
allowed to make up our own minds about
them.
The "Third Worlders" want to have a pro
gram that shows up the "contributions of
minorities and women." This already betrays
their essentially American orientation: They
do not want to read the "Analects" in
Chinese and certainly not the
"Mahabaratha" (11 times as long as the
"Iliad" plus the "Odyssey") in Sanskrit.
They want to read about the glorious
struggles of the blacks/women/homosexuals
(circle appropriately) against nasty white elite
Europeans and, of course, Americans. This is
not "World Culture" but rather an American
cultural tradition presented from their ideo
logical standpoint. Such a course would prob
ably require the reading of second-hand, and
even more probably, second-rate works.
To these "Third Worlders," I have some
questions: How many of you really know
anything about the traditions and the present
reality of the Third World beyond what Time
and TV tell you? What do Krishna, Arjuna
and yes, Sholay mean to you? Can you pin
point the Straits of Malacca, Mauritius and
Mali on the map? For most Americans, and
for many real Third Worlders, the answers
would be "nothing" and "no," respectively.
But somehow, on campus, it is the
Americans who have the cheek to call them
selves the Third World.
