Pub Night raid
needs explaining
I do not understand what hap
pened at the Stanford Pub last
Thursday, and I would like an ex
planation. Senior Pub Night was
being held there, and at midnight
four policemen — I am not sure if
they were Stanford or Palo Alto
police — came in, carded
everybody present and then, re
gardless of whether they were 21,
threw them out.
People who had just bought
drinks, like I had, were not
allowed to finish them. In fact,
after an officer escorted me to
the door, he forbade me from
carrying my drink outside and
then refused to let me finish it at
the door. When I argued with
him, he threatened to cite me.
Cite me for what!?
I am seriously appalled at the
degree of paranoia and the
heavy-handedness of the police
force at Stanford and in Palo
Alto. There was nothing illegal
about a group of 21-year-olds as
sembling in a bar and having
some beer. It was crowded, but
people were not throwing tables,
yelling or being anywhere near
rowdy enough to get into fist
fights. People have told me that
those conditions have existed
before at the Stanford Pub, and I
will concede that that does con
stitute a potentially dangerous
situation.

This past Thursday, however,
the atmosphere was convivial
and vei7 pleasant. I do not think
the police had any right to throw
us out of a restaurant at midnight
— a time that is two hours before
closing time and one-and-a-half
hours before the last call for alco
hol. There are no residences near
this downtown location, and we
were not that loud anyway. I es
pecially resent being made to feel
like a criminal. What in the world
did this police officer think he
was going to cite me for? For
wanting to finish a drink that I
had just purchased legally (I am
22)?
This incident reminds me of
the spring of 1985 when the
police stopped a party taking
place on Wilbur Field right after
the band Wiretrain had started
playing. I was incensed then too.
I am grateful that Stanford
University is not located in the
middle of a high-crime area like
Columbia, Yale, Georgetown or
USC. It is nice that in order to be
safe, a student does not have to
feel like a prisoner confined to
the campus grounds. On the
other hand, I question the judg
ment of the Stanford and Palo
Alto police forces when they
close down student gatherings at
will. I am not so certain that this
party-bashing is a necessary or
effective means of maintaining
the safety of the Stanford and
Palo Alto communities.
