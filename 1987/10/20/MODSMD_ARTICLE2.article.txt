# Stanford hit hard
## Endowment loses $100 million 
### Keith Nashawaty Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
The Stanford endowment was hit
hard by yesterday's stock market
plunge, but University officials
stressed that a diverse portfolio helped
Stanford weather the negative effects
better than most other institutional in
vestors.
The value of gifts to the University's
billion-dollar Centenial Campaign also
declined, but long-term fund-raising ef
forts should not be hurt, Stanford offi
cials said yesterday.
The endowment, a permanent fund
that exists solely to generate income
for the University, was worth $1.5 bil
lion at the start of trading yesterday.
By day's end, the fund had lost over
$100 million in value, according to
William Massy, University vice presi
dent for Business and Finance.
The University has a wide range of
investments in its portfolio, and only 40
percent of these were invested in so

called large capitalization stocks — the
stocks that took the biggest beating
yesterday. Yesterday's 22 percent
plunge translates, then, into an endow
ment loss of nearly 9 percent.
Stanford was apparently better
prepared for a massive decline than
many large investors. "Going into the
recent decline we had more than our
normal target allocation in interna
tional stocks, international bonds and
domestic bonds," Massy said. He
added that Stanford's portfolio con
sisted of 11 percent cash — the highest
percentage in rt-cent memory.
Massy explained that Stanford
avoids risky investment strategies such
as margin buying (buying on credit) and
futures investments, whose investors
were hardest hit in yesterday's drop.
The Centennial Campaign, Stan
ford's $1.1 billion fund-raising pro
gram, was also affected by the mar
ket's reversal, but the long-range out
look remains bright.
David Fulton, deputy to the
vice president of Devlopment,
said, "It's going to hurt us. A
great many of Stanford's gifts
from individuals come in the
form of appreciated securities.
Obviously, an event like this (the
decline) has taken a lot of the ap
preciation out."
Fulton stressed, however, that
"this is a five-year campaign;
we're only in the first year." The
campaign has already raised over
$4(M) million.
Because the University fol
lows a very long-term investment
strategy, it is not likely that yes
terday's events will mean great
changes in policy, said Asst. Uni
versity Treasurer Scott Kaspick.
Similarily, Massy said, "we're
keeping a steady hand on the
helm." He added that the Uni
versity would use its cash
reserves to enter the recently
devalued market if an upturn
seemed likely.

"We're not going to be overly
alarmed," said University Trus
tee Linda Randall Meier. "Alarm
is what causes these things.
We've been riding high up until
now."
The effect on departmental
funding will also be minimized
due to the "smoothing rule" on
the use of the endowment applied
by the University, Kaspick said.

Yesterdays 22 percent
plunge translates, then,
into an endowment loss
of nearly 9 percent.

The smoothing rule limits the
change in the endowment's an
nual contribution to the total
budget. In this way, if the market
rises sharply in a given year —
thereby swelling the endowment
— not all of the excess profit can
be spent. Conversely, in the face
of a sharp decline like yester
day's, the negative effect on
departmental funding is min
imized.
