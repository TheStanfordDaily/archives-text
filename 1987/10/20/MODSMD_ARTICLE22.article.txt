## Scientists may develop superconducting chips Stanford enters superconductivity race 
### Jack Sculley Eric Ly 
Sparks have been flying inside and
outside physics laboratories as research
scientists, including those at Stanford,
work to develop practical superconduc
tors.
This fast-emerging research area,
worthy of this year's Nobel Prize in
physics, has grown considerably in the
past nine months, creating much excite
ment in the world of physics.
Magnetically-levitated trains, super
fast laptop computers and rechargeable
automobiles, once toys of science fic
tion, are now potential (although far-off)
applications of superconductor technol
ogy.
In layman's terms, superconductors
are devices that allow electric current to
flow without any loss of energy.
Researchers working on superconduc
tivity here at Stanford have focused their
efforts on thin films, a major branch of
superconductor research with perhaps
the most promising prospects for practi
cal use in the near future, according to
Prof. Malcolm Beasley, chairman of the
Applied Physics Department.
Thin films
Thin films, superconductive layers
that lie on a thin wafer, can be made into
the electronic chips found in computers,
televisions and radios, Beasley said.
Headed by Beasley, the Stanford re
search group, which consists of four fac
ulty members and from 10 to 20 graduate
students, is investigating ways of manu
facturing thin films and the physical
properties of superconductors.
According to Beasley, the Stanford
group stands near the forefront of the su
perconductor field. "We have some of
the best films, as good as those at IBM
and NTT (the Japanese telephone com
pany)," he said.
The Stanford scientists are studying
the structure of thin films in order to bet
ter understand the properties of super
conductors, Beasley said. It is easier to
study thin films because they are two
dimensional, somewhat like reading a

road map instead of a topographical
map, he explained.
Applications in electronics
Beasley said he is particularly excited
about the possibility of combining con
ventional chip technology with super
conductor materials in electronic
devices. A superconducting device can
replace the "brain" of a personal com
puter, thus improving its processing
power significantly. "Integrating these
films into electronic silicon devices is
now possible with high-temperature su
perconductors," he said.
Since the discovery last April of su
perconductors made from lanthanum,
barium, copper and oxygen that can
function at 35 Kelvin (-238 degrees Cel
sius), physicists around the world have

been scrambling to find other materials
that can superconduct at even higher
temperatures.
In the field of medical technology, su
perconductive devices are enabling doc
tors to look into the human brain without
the need for surgery or discomfort. Su
perconductor technology can now be
used to construct a "topographical"
map of brain tissue. Harly detection of
tumors and brain tissue disorders is now
becoming possible, making many previ
ously painful or dangerous methods ob
solete.
Superconductive magnets may also
eventually put fusion, the energy of the
sun, at mankind's disposal. To control
fusion, scientists must generate intense
magnetic fields to "lock in" superheated
atoms. Given their known ability to

generate intense fields of energy, super
conducting magnets otYer a potentially
much cheaper alternative to conven
tional magnets.
Circuits made of superconducting thin
films, like those now being developed at
Stanford, may soon dramatically alter
both the size and power of contempo
rary electronic equipment. The mini
aturization revolution, which changed
computers from large masses of vacuum
tubes to desktop microcomputers, has
run into the fundamental obstacle of
heat. Regular circuits generate heat via
resistance and are hard to cool when the
circuits are very small.
Using thin films, Stanford scientists
can test the optical properties of materi
als, form superfast electrical switches
known as Josephson junctions (integral
to the construction of superconducting
computers) and more easily measure the
maximum amount of current that can
tlow through a material before it stops
superconducting, Beasley explained.
Fast attempts to build a supercom
puter from superconductors were
abandoned because it was too expensive
to keep superconducting materials cold
enough to superconduct effectively.
Recent research suggests, however, that
refrigeration may no longer be neces
sary.
Mass transit
Researchers outside Stanford are de
veloping mass transit technology that
may in the near future produce trains
that levitate on magnetic cushions
generated by superconducting magnets.
Electric cars and even magnetically
propelled ships may be possible in the
near future. If the current pace of re
search continues, Beasley said, these
dreams might become fact within a dec
ade.
However, Michael Hahn, a Stanford
graduate student studying superconduc
tors, emphasized that the public should
not expect too much without looking at
the facts. It may take years to work the
new materials into production-line com
ponents, he cautioned.
Although predicting what materials

will superconduct effectively at higher
temperatures remains difficult, scientists
are perfecting the use of several tests to
determine the onset of superconduc
tivity, including resistance measure
ments and tests for the so-called
"Meissner Effect."
Research scientists at several miyor
institutions have reported observing the
Meissner and other effects of supercon
ductivity at room temperatures. Chao
Yuan Huang, a scientist at Lockheed
Missiles and Space Co. in Palo Alto, said
he observed the Meissner Effect this
May at approximately 327 K or 54
degrees C, using a compound of
europium, barium, copper and oxygen.
A Kelvin unit corresponds to one
degree on the Celsius scale. Zero Kelvin
equals -273 degrees C, or absolute zero.
Huang said he could not measure ac
curately the absence of resistance in the
compound because his instruments did
not function at such high temperatures.
"We did not expect to see this," Huang
said. He concluded, however, that the
Meissner Effect he had observed was
"sufficient proof of superconductivity."
Huang said his research group will
complete testing of the new compound
soon and expect to see room
temperature superconductors within a
few years. In fact, Huang has estimated
critical temperatures for superconduc
tivity, based upon theoretical principles,
of up to 1000 K (727 degrees C).
Room-temperature superconductivity
According to Beasley, however, these
observations remain largely incon
clusive. "People aren't convinced.
However, it would seem reasonable
(that room-temperature superconduc
tors are possible)," he said, noting that
the physics community was only on its
"second try" in producing feasible su
perconductors.

superconductor market, Beasley, Prof.

joined Conductus, the first superconduc
tor development company in the Bay
Area.
A superconductor will encounter no
resistance at certain low temperatures
and can flow with perfect efficiency. In
one experiment a current was started in
a loop and was found to be undiminished
after two and a half years — a feat com
parable to spinning a top and returning
several years later to find it still rotating.
Even in the best ordinary conductors,
the flow of electrons is impeded by colli

sions with atoms of the metal and other
electrons, thus dissipating its energy in
the form of heat. This effect is known as
electrical resistance and is responsible
for wasting up to 20 percent of the en
ergy sent through high-tension utility
lines.
The heat generated by a personal com
puter after long periods of operation is
one observable result of such resistance.
Resistance also consumes energy in al
most any electronic device, costing con
sumers billions of dollars each year.
Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh
Onnes discovered superconductivity in
1911 by bathing metals in liquid helium.
Helium naturally exists in gas form and

to liquify it requires considerable en
ergy.
Without heavily insulated containers,
liquid helium easily warms and
vaporizes. These limitations prevented
any practical use of superconductors
and discouraged scientists from continu
ing to work in the unproductive field for
seven-and-a-half decades.
In 1973 researchers found supercon
ductivity at 23 K — too cold to be practi
cal — in an alloy of niobium and germa
nium.
Breakthrough in Zurich
A decade later, IBM's Karl Alex
Mueller broke new ground when he
decided to approach superconductivity
using ceramics instead of metallic alloys.
Ceramics, which function as insulators
at room temperature, were found to su
perconduct at very low temperatures.
In his laboratory in Zurich, Switzer
land, Mueller and his colleague,
Johannes Georg Bednorz worked as al
chemists testing varying quantities of
compounds for superconductive effects.
They found compounds, a mixture of the
elements barium, lanthanum, copper
and oxygen, that conduct current with
out resistance at 35 K, the highest tem
perature ever recorded for superconduc
tivity.
Frenzy gradually replaced skepticism
in the physics community as repeated
experiments confirmed what Mueller
and Bednorz had seen. Hahn remembers
the excitement. "Everyone just dropped
what they were doing and came to work
on this," he said.
Mueller and Bednorz were awarded
the 1987 Nobel Prize in physics last
Wednesday for their work on supercon
ducting ceramics.
Excitement in the physics community
mounted as scientists began to make su
perconductors that operated at even
higher temperatures. Most notably. Uni
versity of Houston's Paul C.W. Chu, by
replacing barium with strontium in con
structing superconductive ceramics,
demonstrated superconductivity at 54
K. Chu theorized that smaller molecules
formed with strontium somehow
boosted the superconducting tempera
ture.
This January, Chu filed for a patent
for another substance, which allowed
superconductivity at approximately 90
K, the highest accepted temperature at
which superconductivity has yet been
seen.
High-temperature superconductors
are practical because they can be cooled
with liquid nitrogen, abundant in the
earth's atmosphere and less expensive
per quart than milk. Scientists com
monly carry liquid nitrogen in thermos
bottles when giving demonstrations
outside their labs.
The BC'S "condensation" theory
The accepted scientific theory behind

superconductivity was developed in
1956 by physicists John Bardeen, Leon
Cooper and Robert Schrieffer and in
volves a microscopic "condensation"
among electrons, the fundamental parti
cles of electric current.
According to this explanation, known
as the BCS theory after its authors,
when a metal reaches its superconduc
tive state a unique interaction causes
electrons to link together in what is
known as a Cooper Pair. At very low
temperatures the pairing electrons cause
deformations in the structure of the
metal atoms, attracting them to each
other like the "attraction" of a pair of
bowling balls placed on a trampoline.
Below a certain temperature, the
Cooper Pair forms a bond which
stabilizes it against any loss of energy.
The pair flows through the metal without
any resistance like the pair of bowling
balls, now connected, rolling down a
heavily forested slope. If one ball hits a
tree, instead of bouncing off the trunk
and slowing down, the equivalent of
electrical resistance, the ball is pulled by
the other around the tree without any
loss in speed.
The Meissner Effect
Another important property of super
conductors is the Meissner Effect,
which provides the basis for some of the
most exciting applications of supercon
ductors, such as magnetically levitated
trains. When a compound supercon
ducts it completely expels all magnetic

fields, causing magnets to be literally
levitated in mid-air.
Part of the controversy surrounding
the recent discoveries of high
temperature superconductors (those
which operate at approximately 90 K
and higher) is that the BCS theory can
not account for electron pairing at tem
peratures over 40 degrees above abso
lute zero.
In effect, at higher temperatures the
metal ions vibrate so rapidly that they
cannot form Cooper Pairs, as previously
understood. Theorists are therefore
struggling to explain how the newly ob
served high-temperature superconduc
tivity can occur while their experimental
counterparts unveil breathtaking dis
covery after discovery.
Scientists at Stanford are at the fore
front in trying to analyze the structure of
superconducting compounds in an at
tempt to determine exactly how, and
why, they work. In addition to the work
being done on thin films, another Stan
ford group headed by Profs. Littel and
Kapitulnik of the Applied Physics De
partment is measuring what David Mitzi,
a Stanford graduate student in applied
physics, termed "the isotope effect" in
superconductors.
Different isotopes of metal used in
making the compounds make the com
pounds superconduct at different tem
peratures. If the temperature is in fact
dependent on the mass of the metal
atoms, it would give researchers an im
portant clue about how electron pairs in
teract.
