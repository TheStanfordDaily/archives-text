## Scientists may develop superconducting chips Stanford enters superconductivity race 
### Jack Sculley Eric Ly 
Sparks have been flying inside and
outside physics laboratories as research
scientists, including those at Stanford,
work to develop practical superconduc
tors.
This fast-emerging research area,
worthy of this year's Nobel Prize in
physics, has grown considerably in the
past nine months, creating much excite
ment in the world of physics.
Magnetically-levitated trains, super
fast laptop computers and rechargeable
automobiles, once toys of science fic
tion, are now potential (although far-off)
applications of superconductor technol
ogy.
In layman's terms, superconductors
are devices that allow electric current to
flow without any loss of energy.
Researchers working on superconduc
tivity here at Stanford have focused their
efforts on thin films, a major branch of
superconductor research with perhaps
the most promising prospects for practi
cal use in the near future, according to
Prof. Malcolm Beasley, chairman of the
Applied Physics Department.
Thin films
Thin films, superconductive layers
that lie on a thin wafer, can be made into
the electronic chips found in computers,
televisions and radios, Beasley said.
Headed by Beasley, the Stanford re
search group, which consists of four fac
ulty members and from 10 to 20 graduate
students, is investigating ways of manu
facturing thin films and the physical
properties of superconductors.
According to Beasley, the Stanford
group stands near the forefront of the su
perconductor field. "We have some of
the best films, as good as those at IBM
and NTT (the Japanese telephone com
pany)," he said.
The Stanford scientists are studying
the structure of thin films in order to bet
ter understand the properties of super
conductors, Beasley said. It is easier to
study thin films because they are two
dimensional, somewhat like reading a

road map instead of a topographical
map, he explained.
Applications in electronics
Beasley said he is particularly excited
about the possibility of combining con
ventional chip technology with super
conductor materials in electronic
devices. A superconducting device can
replace the "brain" of a personal com
puter, thus improving its processing
power significantly. "Integrating these
films into electronic silicon devices is
now possible with high-temperature su
perconductors," he said.
Since the discovery last April of su
perconductors made from lanthanum,
barium, copper and oxygen that can
function at 35 Kelvin (-238 degrees Cel
sius), physicists around the world have

been scrambling to find other materials
that can superconduct at even higher
temperatures.
In the field of medical technology, su
perconductive devices are enabling doc
tors to look into the human brain without
the need for surgery or discomfort. Su
perconductor technology can now be
used to construct a "topographical"
map of brain tissue. Harly detection of
tumors and brain tissue disorders is now
becoming possible, making many previ
ously painful or dangerous methods ob
solete.
Superconductive magnets may also
eventually put fusion, the energy of the
sun, at mankind's disposal. To control
fusion, scientists must generate intense
magnetic fields to "lock in" superheated
atoms. Given their known ability to

generate intense fields of energy, super
conducting magnets otYer a potentially
much cheaper alternative to conven
tional magnets.
Circuits made of superconducting thin
films, like those now being developed at
Stanford, may soon dramatically alter
both the size and power of contempo
rary electronic equipment. The mini
aturization revolution, which changed
computers from large masses of vacuum
tubes to desktop microcomputers, has
run into the fundamental obstacle of
heat. Regular circuits generate heat via
resistance and are hard to cool when the
circuits are very small.
Using thin films, Stanford scientists
can test the optical properties of materi
als, form superfast electrical switches
known as Josephson junctions (integral
to the construction of superconducting
computers) and more easily measure the
maximum amount of current that can
tlow through a material before it stops
superconducting, Beasley explained.
Fast attempts to build a supercom
puter from superconductors were
abandoned because it was too expensive
to keep superconducting materials cold
enough to superconduct effectively.
Recent research suggests, however, that
refrigeration may no longer be neces
sary.
Mass transit
Researchers outside Stanford are de
veloping mass transit technology that
may in the near future produce trains
that levitate on magnetic cushions
generated by superconducting magnets.
Electric cars and even magnetically
propelled ships may be possible in the
near future. If the current pace of re
search continues, Beasley said, these
dreams might become fact within a dec
ade.
However, Michael Hahn, a Stanford
graduate student studying superconduc
tors, emphasized that the public should
not expect too much without looking at
the facts. It may take years to work the
new materials into production-line com
ponents, he cautioned.
Although predicting what materials

will superconduct effectively at higher
temperatures remains difficult, scientists
are perfecting the use of several tests to
determine the onset of superconduc
tivity, including resistance measure
ments and tests for the so-called
"Meissner Effect."
Research scientists at several miyor
institutions have reported observing the
Meissner and other effects of supercon
ductivity at room temperatures. Chao
Yuan Huang, a scientist at Lockheed
Missiles and Space Co. in Palo Alto, said
he observed the Meissner Effect this
May at approximately 327 K or 54
degrees C, using a compound of
europium, barium, copper and oxygen.
A Kelvin unit corresponds to one
degree on the Celsius scale. Zero Kelvin
equals -273 degrees C, or absolute zero.
Huang said he could not measure ac
curately the absence of resistance in the
compound because his instruments did
not function at such high temperatures.
"We did not expect to see this," Huang
said. He concluded, however, that the
Meissner Effect he had observed was
"sufficient proof of superconductivity."
Huang said his research group will
complete testing of the new compound
soon and expect to see room
temperature superconductors within a
few years. In fact, Huang has estimated
critical temperatures for superconduc
tivity, based upon theoretical principles,
of up to 1000 K (727 degrees C).
Room-temperature superconductivity
According to Beasley, however, these
observations remain largely incon
clusive. "People aren't convinced.
However, it would seem reasonable
(that room-temperature superconduc
tors are possible)," he said, noting that
the physics community was only on its
"second try" in producing feasible su
perconductors.
Hoping to tap the potentially lucrative
superconductor market, Beasley, Prof.
