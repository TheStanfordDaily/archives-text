## Stanford Hurler makes big splash 
### 
While they're not yet saying
"Bannister and McDowell,
then throw in the towel," the
Chicago media and White Sox
executives and fans are buzzing
about Stanford senior Jack
McDowell's dazzling major
league pitching debut.

"I think to say we're excited
is an understatement," Chicago
Player Personnel Administrator
Dan Evans said of McDowell,
who compiled a 3-0 record with
a 1.93 ERA in four starts after
joining the White Sox in Sep
tember.
"He's the best thing to come
•around this ballpark pitching
: wise in a long time," Evans
continued. "We haven't had a
; .young prospect like this since
• lpitchers) Richard Dotson and
• 23ritt Burns came up seven
'years ago. Anyone who's that
! quick a learner with that kind of
; ability, the sky's the limit."
" After McDowell pitched

seven shutout innings against
the A's, the Chicago Tribune
commented that "quite simply,
Jack McDowell might be the
best thing to happen to the
White Sox this year."
McDowell's smashing major
league success and the College
World Series championship
with Stanford have capped an
unforgettable year for him; now
he's back on the Farm, living at
the Theta Delt house and trying
to finish up his last two quarters
for a communication degree.
McDowell is a guy who's got
the world by the tail.
"Not many things have been
going wrong as far as my
baseball career goes," he said
recently. "It's really fun being
there (in the major leagues) and
realizing you've finally reached
your goal. I've never pictured
myself being anything else. It's
always been something I've
planned on."
McDowell has come a long
way since the beginning of win
ter quarter when he was battling
nagging injuries and simply
trying to get into pitching
shape.
Both he and the Cardinal
foundered in the early season.
However, as McDowell hit his


Brendan
Healey
stride so did Stanford, and in his
final game for the Cardinal he
pitched his teammates to the Col
lege World Series championship.
Since then McDowell has been
living a pitcher's dream, although
he first had to work through
lengthy contract negotiations
with the White Sox. With one
season of college eligibility left,
he set August 1 as a contract
deadline and planned to return to
Stanford if he was still unsigned
at that time.
"I was real close to coming
back," McDowell said. "I called
(Stanford Coach) Mark
Marquess a couple days before I
signed, and he suggested it was
probably a good idea if 1 went
(pro)."
Once he signed, McDowell
was on an express to the majors.
He had a gentlemen's agreement
with the White Sox that he would
receive a September call-up, and
there was no keeping his talent
down in the minors.
According to McDowell, his
initial rookie league assignment
"wasn't even competitive for
me," and he was soon sent from
Sarasota to Double A Birming
ham.
A lot of high expectations fol

lowed McDowell to Birmingham.
"There was a lot of pressure
tnere," McDowell said. "I think
it hurt me a little bit."
Nevertheless, he helped Bir
mingham win the Southern
League title before being called
up to the White Sox in mid-
September.
McDowell's first start was
against the hard-hitting Minne
sota Twins. McDowell called
playing a Minnesota team bound
for the World Series a "no-lose
situation," although that's some
what like saying the Christians
were in a no-lose situation
against the lions.
There was no way a rookie
could shut down the Twins, and
the White Sox received angry
calls from other teams in the
league for breaking an unwritten
rule of baseball and starting a
rookie against a pennant con
tender.
Apparently someone forgot to
tell McDowell he wasn't
supposed to win, though, be
cause he pitched seven shutout
innings for his first major league
victory.
"1 just went out there and
threw," McDowell said. "The
only complaint afterward came
from the Twins."
McDowell also topped Seattle
and California to help the streak
ing White Sox escape the cellar

with a strong finish.
"He came up and was a breath
of fresh air," Evans said. "He
threw his fastball and forkball for
strikes. He was in charge of the
ballgame; very few pitchers have
that ability. We never questioned
his confidence."
Confidence is a major part of
McDowell's makeup. He
believes in himself (who
wouldn't after the year he's
had?), and that is part of what
makes him such a successful
pitcher.
Now he believes he's ready for
an extended stint in the major
leagues.
"If I'm not in the big leagues at
the start of the year, something's
wrong," McDowell said.
Evans, however, sounds a cau
tionary note when speaking of
McDowell's future.
"We're not going to push
Jack," Evans said. "He has a
chance to make our major league
team. Nothing is etched in stone.
There are a lot of factors in
volved. He's too much a key to
our future to toy around with
him."
Regardless of where McDow
ell ends up next season, his per
formance this fall will warm the
hearts of White Sox fans while
they struggle through a chilly
Windy City winter in anticipation
of the first blush of spring.

the White Sox received angry
calls from other teams in the
league for breaking an unwritten
rule of baseball and starting a
rookie against a pennant con
tender.
Apparently someone forgot to
tell McDowell he wasn't
supposed to win, though, be
cause he pitched seven shutout
innings for his first major league
victory.
"1 just went out there and
threw," McDowell said. "The
only complaint afterward came
from the Twins."
McDowell also topped Seattle
and California to help the streak
ing White Sox escape the cellar

with a strong finish.
"He came up and was a breath
of fresh air," Evans said. "He
threw his fastball and forkball for
strikes. He was in charge of the
ballgame; very few pitchers have
that ability. We never questioned
his confidence."
Confidence is a major part of
McDowell's makeup. He
believes in himself (who
wouldn't after the year he's
had?), and that is part of what
makes him such a successful
pitcher.
Now he believes he's ready for
an extended stint in the major
leagues.
"If I'm not in the big leagues at
the start of the year, something's
wrong," McDowell said.
Evans, however, sounds a cau
tionary note when speaking of
McDowell's future.
"We're not going to push
Jack," Evans said. "He has a
chance to make our major league
team. Nothing is etched in stone.
There are a lot of factors in
volved. He's too much a key to
our future to toy around with
him."
Regardless of where McDow
ell ends up next season, his per
formance this fall will warm the
hearts of White Sox fans while
they struggle through a chilly
Windy City winter in anticipation
of the first blush of spring.
While they're not yet saying
"Bannister and McDowell,
then throw in the towel," the
Chicago media and White Sox
executives and fans are buzzing
about Stanford senior Jack
McDowell's dazzling major
league pitching debut.

"I think to say we're excited
is an understatement," Chicago
Player Personnel Administrator
Dan Evans said of McDowell,
who compiled a 3-0 record with
a 1.93 ERA in four starts after
joining the White Sox in Sep
tember.
"He's the best thing to come
•around this ballpark pitching
: wise in a long time," Evans
continued. "We haven't had a
; .young prospect like this since
• lpitchers) Richard Dotson and
• 23ritt Burns came up seven
'years ago. Anyone who's that
! quick a learner with that kind of
; ability, the sky's the limit."
" After McDowell pitched

seven shutout innings against
the A's, the Chicago Tribune
commented that "quite simply,
Jack McDowell might be the
best thing to happen to the
White Sox this year."
McDowell's smashing major
league success and the College
World Series championship
with Stanford have capped an
unforgettable year for him; now
he's back on the Farm, living at
the Theta Delt house and trying
to finish up his last two quarters
for a communication degree.
McDowell is a guy who's got
the world by the tail.
"Not many things have been
going wrong as far as my
baseball career goes," he said
recently. "It's really fun being
there (in the major leagues) and
realizing you've finally reached
your goal. I've never pictured
myself being anything else. It's
always been something I've
planned on."
McDowell has come a long
way since the beginning of win
ter quarter when he was battling
nagging injuries and simply
trying to get into pitching
shape.
Both he and the Cardinal
foundered in the early season.
However, as McDowell hit his


Brendan
Healey
stride so did Stanford, and in his
final game for the Cardinal he
pitched his teammates to the Col
lege World Series championship.
Since then McDowell has been
living a pitcher's dream, although
he first had to work through
lengthy contract negotiations
with the White Sox. With one
season of college eligibility left,
he set August 1 as a contract
deadline and planned to return to
Stanford if he was still unsigned
at that time.
"I was real close to coming
back," McDowell said. "I called
(Stanford Coach) Mark
Marquess a couple days before I
signed, and he suggested it was
probably a good idea if 1 went
(pro)."
Once he signed, McDowell
was on an express to the majors.
He had a gentlemen's agreement
with the White Sox that he would
receive a September call-up, and
there was no keeping his talent
down in the minors.
According to McDowell, his
initial rookie league assignment
"wasn't even competitive for
me," and he was soon sent from
Sarasota to Double A Birming
ham.
A lot of high expectations fol

lowed McDowell to Birmingham.
"There was a lot of pressure
tnere," McDowell said. "I think
it hurt me a little bit."
Nevertheless, he helped Bir
mingham win the Southern
League title before being called
up to the White Sox in mid-
September.
McDowell's first start was
against the hard-hitting Minne
sota Twins. McDowell called
playing a Minnesota team bound
for the World Series a "no-lose
situation," although that's some
what like saying the Christians
were in a no-lose situation
against the lions.
