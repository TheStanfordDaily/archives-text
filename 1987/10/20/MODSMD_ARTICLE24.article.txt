# Card basks in second victory
## 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
The magic number for the
Stanford football team over the
past two weeks has been 44 —
the number of points the Cardinal
has scored in both of its wins this
season.

Heading into a home matchup
Saturday against a surprisingly
tough Oregon team following two
straight victories on the road, the
2-4 Cardinal is searching for that
extra edge, which, apart from
scoring 44 points, might help the
team emerge triumphant at Stan
ford Stadium for the first time

this year.
Could the answer be those red
pants Stanford unveiled in its up
set of Arizona at the Coca-Cola
Bowl last season and that the
squad has worn for wins the past
two weeks? Head Coach Jack El
way was intrigued with the idea
that the clothes might not only

make the man, they might make
the football team.
"That's a good idea," Elway
responded when asked if he was
considering sticking with Stan
ford's winning wardrobe. "We
can wear those pants with red
jersies and look like fire
engines."
The Ducks might need fire
engines themselves to extinguish
the Cardinal's new-found explo
sive offense led by sophomore
quarterback Brian Johnson and
sparkplug sophomore tailback
Jon Volpe. Johnson, who has
started the past two games, is
now 26-for-50 passing with 505
yards and four touchdowns.
Volpe, who has started the last
three games in place of injured
All-American Brad Muster, has
rushed for over 100 yards in two
straight contests and leads the
Cardinal with 291 yards and four
touchdowns in 79 carries. Volpe
also has five receptions for 97
yards. Muster practiced yester
day and may be available for the
Oregon game.
"That kid — What's his name?
Vopel? — is doing a super job,"
said Oregon Coach Rich Brooks,
whose Ducks are 4-2 overall and
2-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
"He's like Tony Cherry (Oregon,
'85): very strong, very quick.
He's made some super plays the
last couple weeks."
Brooks is also concerned
about senior receiver Jeff James,
who leads the Cardinal with 376
yards on 25 receptions and who

has become a standout kick
returner, averaging 29.8 yards
per return. "In Jeff James we'll
see the best receiver we've seen
all year long and probably will
see all year. He's extremely
quick and they're moving him
around very effectively," Brooks
said.
Not to be outdone, the offen
sive line also got its share of
credit. "They're strong and
quick," Brooks said. "They're a
force to be reckoned with. I don't
think the USC or UCLA lines
come off the ball as quick as
Stanford."
Junior offensive tackle John
Zentner exemplified the confi
dence of the offensive line, which
has been instrumental in allowing
Stanford to score those 88 points
in two games. "We could block
for whoever's behind us,"
Zentner said. "We could have
these reporters behind us. I don't
even notice who's in the huddle
most of the time because I'm
concentrating on my own per
sonal battle on the line."
The Cardinal defense has been
cause for a bit more concern, es
pecially after surrendering 536
yards passing to San Diego
State's Todd Santos.
