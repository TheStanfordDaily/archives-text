Someone better call the fire de
partment because the Stanford
women's volleyball team is
ablaze.
The Cardinal is riding a 10-
match winning streak coming
into its 7:30 p.m. match tonight at
Maples Pavilion, where San Jose
State will try to hose down Stan
ford. The Spartans are a good
team, with a 14-2 record and a
No. 12 national ranking, but their
most recent loss was a 15-13, 4-
15, 15-4, 15-7 drubbing at the
hands of Stanford two weeks ago
in San Jose.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal has
dropped only three games during
the winning streak that has run
the teams record up to 15-3, and
Stanford looks like the better
team coming in tonight. In addi
tion to its hot play over the last
four weeks, the Cardinal has
played great at home all season.
After weekend wins over
Arizona and Arizona State, the
Cardinal is 7-0 in Maples this

season and has won 13 con
secutive games here.
In addition to the traditional
rivalry between the two schools,
tonight's contest is a matchup of
the Pacific 10 Conference and the
Pacific Coast Athletic Associa
tion. The Pac-10 and the PCAA
are waging a war this year for
bragging rights as the toughest
league in the country (each has
five of its ten teams ranked in the
national top-20) and Stanford and
San Jose State are top represen
tatives.
The Cardinal is atop the Pac-10
with an 8-1 mark, good for a half
game lead over fourth-ranked
UCLA (7-1), a one-game lead
over Oregon (7-2), and a two
game lead over California (6-3).
The Spartans are running second
in the PCAA with an 8-1 mark.
They trail only top-ranked
Hawaii.
The similarities don't end
there, though. The reason both
teams are going strong in their
respective conference races is
the play of each squad's contin
gent of seniors.
