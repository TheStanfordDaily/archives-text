# Profs, differ on Gulf strike
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer with wire reports 
Scholars here expressed sharply dif
fering opinions over whether three
U.S. attacks yesterday on Iranian oil
platforms in the Persian Gulf con
stituted a wise foreign policy.

According to Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall, "all of the Gulf na
tions realize that once this is over they
have to live with Iran, the major Gulf
power, so they want us to come in and
protect their tankers but don't want to
associate with us because they know
that we're in a combat situation with
Iran. It's bizarre and slightly crazy."
Law Prof. Tom Campbell disagreed.
"It was just perfect to stabilize the situ
ation in the Gulf."' said Campbell, who
plans to run for the U.S. Congress next
year. "If we did nothing we would be
encouraging another attack, and if we
responded with more force it would be
upping the ante."
The U.S. attacked three Iranian oil
platforms in the Gulf yesterday in
response to an Iranian missile attack
Friday on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti su
pertanker Sea Isle City that injured 17.
Eleven Kuwaiti oil tankers were

reflagged under the United States flag
last summer after tensions between
Iran and Iraq resulted in dangerous
shipping conditions in the Persian Gulf.
Calling the reflagging policy "a terri
ble mistake," Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall said that "oil was
moving out of the Gulf before we got
involved, and now the situation has
gotten worse because power politics
and egos got involved."
The attack prompted demands from
some that Congress invoke the 1973
War Powers Act, which says that
within 60 days after the president an
nounces he has committed armed
forces abroad. Congress may vote to
keep or withdraw them.
"Can you think of any reason why it
(the War Powers Act) should not be
invoked?" asked Assoc. History Prof.
Jack Rakove, who specializes in con
stitutional issues. "You have a serious
commitment of armed troops, a situa
tion which the War Powers Resolution
was designed to regulate."
Campbell, however, said he feels
that the authority to commit armed
troops abroad rests solely with the
president.
"The president, as commander-in
chief of the armed forces, has the
power to respond to an armed attack."
he said. "The War Powers Resolution
was for decisions of war, and we're not
in that context at all. Weinberger con
siders the matter closed."

Asst. Histo; Prof. Joel Beinin, who
specializes in N.-ddle Eastern affairs,
faulted the resolution itself, calling it
weak because "it depends on the presi
dent making an announcement, and the
mechanism doesn't work" if he
doesn't. Th; result, Beinin said, is
"imperial foreign policy-making."
"The president violated the law a
long time ago," Beinin said, "but
Congress doesn't have the guts to call
him on it."
