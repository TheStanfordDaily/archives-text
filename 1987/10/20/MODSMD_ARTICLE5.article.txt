# Expert testifies against drug tests
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Testifying in favor of a comprehensive
drug-testing policy, the chair of the United
States Olympic Committee's task force on
substance abuse said yesterday in Santa
Clara County Superior Court that the
NCAA's current policy of testing for only se
lected sports is "unreasonable" and subject
to "inevitable failure."
Dr. Donald Catlin, associate professor of
medicine and pharmacology at UCLA and di
rector of the testing laboratory at the
Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, was the
fourth expert witness called by the National
Collegiate Athletic Association in defense of
its controversial drug-testing program.
In the next-to-last day of hearings to deter
mine whether Stanford athletes Jennifer Hill
and Barry McKeever will receive a prelimi
nary injunction exempting them from the
year-old policy, NCAA attorneys sought to
counter charges that the organization's drug
testing program is overbroad.
NCAA attorney Richard Archer asked Cat
lin whether there were any sports for which
drug testing would be uselesv "Based on my
experience at the Olympics," Catlin said, "I
don't think it's reasonable to try to single out
one or more sports."

"All sports and all men and women are at
risk. The difficulties in ranking sports from
high-risk' to 'low-risk' would lead to chaos.
No country (competing in the Olympics) has
attempted to do that." Catlin said.
Catlin cited bobsledding, figure skating and
gymnastics as examples of sports that are
usually considered low-risk but have
produced positive drug test results among
Olympic athletes in recent years.
"In bobsledding we had two years in a row
with no positive results, and the next year
turned up a case of anabolic steroids," Catlin
said, adding that "in the 19H4 Olympics we
found a stimulant in a very prominent gym
nastics athlete."
The testimony came in reaction to charges
made last week by witnesses for the Stanford
athletes that drug testing is only necessary for
sports such as football and basketball. Drug
testing over the past year has shown a higher
incidence of violations of NCAA drug regula
tions in those sports.
Catlin also disputed charges that the
NCAA's list of over MKM) banned drugs con
tains superfluous items. Asked by Archer
whether caffeine should be on the list. Catlin
said. "Definitely. (Its inclusion] prevents,
discourages and deters athletes from using a
large dose of caffeine by intravenous infusion
to enhance their performance."

Catlin called reports that the NCAA's limit
of 12 micrograms of caffeine per milliliter of
blood could be reached through drinking a
few cups of coffee "utter nonsense."
Archer continued to hold out the pos
siblility that he might agree to a motion made
Tuesday by attorneys for the athletes that the
hearing be considered a trial.
If Archer agrees to the motion. Judge Con
rad Rushing's ruling would be final anil could
only be challenged in a higher court.
Robert Van Nest, attorney for the plain
tiffs, objected to the NCAA's delay and
asked Rushing how long the NCAA could
continue to hedge.
Rushing replied that the NCAA was within
its rights, but that he would in any event use
all means to expedite the case. He said that if
the hearing is not declared a trial he will prob
ably schedule a trial to begin the week after
he rules on the injunction. Rushing's ruling is
expected by the end of this week.
Van Nest, an attorney representing
McKeever and Hill on behalf of the American
Civil Liberties Union, said he will deliver his
closing statement tomorrow.
The NCAA will also close its case tomor
row with testimony from Ruth Burkee, assis
tant executive director of the NCAA, and will
recall witness Dr. Robert Voy, medical direc
tor of the U.S. Olympic Committee.

whether caffeine should be on the list. Catlin
said. "Definitely. (Its inclusion] prevents,
discourages and deters athletes from using a
large dose of caffeine by intravenous infusion
to enhance their performance."

Catlin called reports that the NCAA's limit
of 12 micrograms of caffeine per milliliter of
blood could be reached through drinking a
few cups of coffee "utter nonsense."
Archer continued to hold out the pos
siblility that he might agree to a motion made
Tuesday by attorneys for the athletes that the
hearing be considered a trial.
If Archer agrees to the motion. Judge Con
rad Rushing's ruling would be final anil could
only be challenged in a higher court.
Robert Van Nest, attorney for the plain
tiffs, objected to the NCAA's delay and
asked Rushing how long the NCAA could
continue to hedge.
Rushing replied that the NCAA was within
its rights, but that he would in any event use
all means to expedite the case. He said that if
the hearing is not declared a trial he will prob
ably schedule a trial to begin the week after
he rules on the injunction. Rushing's ruling is
expected by the end of this week.
Van Nest, an attorney representing
McKeever and Hill on behalf of the American
Civil Liberties Union, said he will deliver his
closing statement tomorrow.
The NCAA will also close its case tomor
row with testimony from Ruth Burkee, assis
tant executive director of the NCAA, and will
recall witness Dr. Robert Voy, medical direc
tor of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
