# Earth Sciences gets $6 million
## Money for new science building 
### Vivian Rogers Staff writer 
Fund raising for a ne\v $20
million earth sciences center
got off to a promising start
Friday, when Cecil Green, co
founder of Texas Instruments,
announced that he will donate
$6 million to the project.
The new building, to be
named after Green, 87. and his
late wife Ida, will replace the
Noble and Salvatori Buildings
and will house one-third of the
earth sciences faculty.
The center, which officials
hope will open by the early
IWOs, will also be used for ac
tivities in applied earth
sciences, geology, geophysics
and petroleum engineering.
The gift was the largest ever

to the School of Earth
Sciences. The $6 million total
includes a bequest left by Ida
Green, who died last year, and
a further gift by Cecil Green.
"This is a culmination of all
the good things he has done
for our office," said Earth
Sciences Dean George
Thompson. "The process has
developed over a period of
time, but it is still a happy
surprise."
Green said in an earlier in
terview about his philanthropy
at Stanford that "my goal is
making the best even better."
Green, a pioneer in reflec
tion seismology, is a member
of the Stanford Earth Sciences
Advisory Board and holds a
consulting professorship in the
Geophysics Department. His
earlier gifts to the department in
clude fellowships and the Cecil
and Ida Green Professorship in
Geophysics.
A decade ago the Greens gave
$6 million to the University to
help pay for a 1977 addition to
what is now Green Library.
Although neither of the Greens
graduated from Stanford, Cecil
Green said he and his wife
formed a good impression of the
University because of the quality
of alumni like Engineering Deans
Fredrick Terman and Herbert
Hoover Jr.
"There's a lot to be learned,
and the new building will
promote progress in science by
encouraging collaboration be
tween industry and academia,"
he said.
The need for more laboratory
space is becoming critical as re
search emphasis in earth

sciences gradually changes from
qualitative to quantitative, ac
cording to a description of the
building supplied by the depart
ment.
The new building is also de
signed to enhance collaboration
on research by bringing four de
partments together under one
roof.
The 38 professors in the
School of Earth Sciences cur
rently conduct their research and
teaching in seven buildings. As
sociate Dean for Administration
Ruth Sloan said that "the newest
building we have now is ap
proaching 20 years old."
Preliminary plans show three
stories above ground and two
basement floors. The building
will cover 70,(XK) square feet.
The building project is part of
Stanford's $250 million
redevelopment of science and en
gineering facilities on the west
side of campus. The School of
Earth Sciences is slated to
receive $34.3 million in the Uni
versity's Centennial Campaign.
