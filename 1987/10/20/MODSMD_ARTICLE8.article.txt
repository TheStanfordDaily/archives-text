Iran vows revenge for U.S. attack
KUWAIT — Iran yesterday accused the United States of
launching a "full-scale war" in the Persian Gulf and vowed to
avenge the American attack on its oil platform "with a crushing
blow."
Iran's chief of war information, Kamal Kharrazi, said in a
statement issued by the state news agency, "The United States
has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out
safely."
Later, President Ali Khamenei, speaking on state radio after a
meeting of the Supreme Defense Council, said Iran would "take
decisive retaliatory action," and he warned that "(President)
Reagan, by this action, has made a big mistake."
Arab leaders on the other side of the Persian Gulf praised the
U.S. military action in private, but distanced themselves in
public from any cooperation with the U.S. forces that might
draw a retaliatory blow from Iran.
In Kuwait, whose territory and oil-transport lifeline has been
most threatened by Iranian attacks, there was official silence
over the U.S. action. One Kuwaiti official, asked whether the
government would comment, said, "Why would there be any
comment? This does not concern Kuwait in any way."
Some Western sources in the region said they feared Iran
might take revenge against Arab oil platforms in the lower gulf
as it did last November after Iraq launched its first long-range
bombing raids against Iranian oil platforms and terminals in the
vicinity of yesterday's U.S. naval attack on an Iranian platform.
In Abu Dhabi, a presidential official said U.S. retaliation for
Iran's Silkworm missile attack on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti su
pertanker Sea Isle City, which blinded U.S. Capt. John Hunt
and injured 16 other crewmen, was "expected," but will not
succeed without a coherent U.S. policy to help end the seven
year war.
The Soviet yesterday denounced the U.S. attack.
Experts hear few echoes of 1929
NEW YORK — The stock market's breathtaking plunge has
evoked memories of the stock market crash of October 1929,
which burst the euphoria of a decade-long speculative bubble
and foreshadowed the Great Depression.
But though the parallels seem to grow daily, economists and
other analysts say the similarities are still far outweighed by the
differences between the current decline and the debacle of 1929.
Since the Great Crash, limits have been placed on borrowing for
stock purchases, government has assumed an active role in
regulating the markets and the economy, and nations have made
greater efforts to minimize international economic disruptions.
Today's economy is far stronger than the one that succumbed
to depression within three years of the 1929 market dive.
To be sure, yesterday's drop in the Dow Jones industrial
average has far overshadowed the losses suffered on Black
Monday — Oct. 28, 1929— when the Dow lost 12.82 percent of
its value. The index fell 508.32 points yesterday, to 1,738.42, for
a 22.62 percent loss that astonished the gloomiest of market
analysts.
Yet the market has a way to go to match the collapse that oc
curred between 1929 and 1932, when the market finally hit bot
tom. That decline represented nearly 90 percent of the Dow's
value; so far, the Dow has fallen 36.14 percent from its Aug. 25
peak of 2,722.42.
Even with yesterday's sell-off, the Dow is up 124 percent
from its level in August 1982, when the bull market began.
Nakasone decides on a successor
TOKYO — Japan's Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone today
named Noboru Takeshita, 63, a traditional consensus-builder,
to succeed him.
Three candidates entrusted Nakasone with the decision after
a round of talks that stretched over more than 12 hours failed to
produce agreement on who should be the new president of the
• ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Under Japan's parliamentary
style government, the leader of the party with the majority of
seats in Parliament also becomes prime minister.
Nakasone responded by chosing Takeshita (pronounced Tah
kay-sh'tah), who commands the largest faction of followers
within the party that has ruled Japan since 1955.
Takeshita, who is now the party's secretary-general, had
served Nakasone as finance minister for three years and eight
months. He said his reaction was one of tension.
"I feel that a great burden has been placed upon my back," he
said. "Its weight is pressing down upon my shoulders. ... I feel I
must devote my life to the nation, to the people and to world
peace."
Nakasone, announcing his decision after midnight through the
party's deputy secretary-general, gave no reasons for his
choice. But it was obvious that the 69-year-old premier, whose
term ends Oct. 30, aligned himself with the results of 12 days of
talks among the three candidates for the party's top post.
In an eight-hour meeting with Takeshita yesterday, Shintaro
Abe, 63, the party's executive board chairman, refused to bow
out of the race but declared that he would remain allied with
Takeshita against Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, 68, the
third candidate. The combination gave the two a commanding
edge over Miyazawa and offered the greatest prospect for party
stability.
Supreme Court split on visa case
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, already showing
signs that it cannot decide the most difficult cases without a
ninth justice, said yesterday that it had deadlocked on the ques
tion ot whether the State Department may deny visas to foreign
political activists who want to visit the United States.
The action leaves in place a lower court order that the Reagan
administration must give a court more evidence before it denies
visas to leftist activists scheduled to make speeches or attend
anti-nuclear rallies in the United States.
I he Supreme Court issued a one-sentence order saying that
"an equally divided court" would not issue a ruling in Reagan
vs. Abourezk, 86-656, one of the most widely watched cases of
this term. The justices had heard arguments in the case Oct. 5,
the first day of their fall session.
The court said that it had split 3-3 with Justices Harry Black
mun and Antonin Scalia not voting. One of Blackmun's former
clerks was a lawyer in the case, while Scalia sat on the Washing
ton appeals court that already had heard the case.
Meanwhile, for the third week in a row, the eight justices
ignored appeals on several significant national issues, such as
whether the government may require its employees to take drug
tests. Instead, the court said it would hear arguments in less sig
nificant procedural cases, such as whether a lawyer who makes
a clerical error in an appeal can seek to correct the mistake in a
higher court.
Absent a ninth justice since the retirement of Lewis Powell
Jr., the court is left with four justice who often vote con
servatively and four who often vote liberally. The justices do
not explain why they decide to hear one appeal and not another.

kay-sh'tah), who commands the largest faction of followers
within the party that has ruled Japan since 1955.
Takeshita, who is now the party's secretary-general, had
served Nakasone as finance minister for three years and eight
months. He said his reaction was one of tension.
"I feel that a great burden has been placed upon my back," he
said. "Its weight is pressing down upon my shoulders. ... I feel I
must devote my life to the nation, to the people and to world
peace."
Nakasone, announcing his decision after midnight through the
party's deputy secretary-general, gave no reasons for his
choice. But it was obvious that the 69-year-old premier, whose
term ends Oct. 30, aligned himself with the results of 12 days of
talks among the three candidates for the party's top post.
In an eight-hour meeting with Takeshita yesterday, Shintaro
Abe, 63, the party's executive board chairman, refused to bow
out of the race but declared that he would remain allied with
Takeshita against Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, 68, the
third candidate. The combination gave the two a commanding
edge over Miyazawa and offered the greatest prospect for party
stability.
Supreme Court split on visa case
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, already showing
signs that it cannot decide the most difficult cases without a
ninth justice, said yesterday that it had deadlocked on the ques
tion ot whether the State Department may deny visas to foreign
political activists who want to visit the United States.
The action leaves in place a lower court order that the Reagan
administration must give a court more evidence before it denies
visas to leftist activists scheduled to make speeches or attend
anti-nuclear rallies in the United States.
I he Supreme Court issued a one-sentence order saying that
"an equally divided court" would not issue a ruling in Reagan
vs. Abourezk, 86-656, one of the most widely watched cases of
this term. The justices had heard arguments in the case Oct. 5,
the first day of their fall session.
The court said that it had split 3-3 with Justices Harry Black
mun and Antonin Scalia not voting. One of Blackmun's former
clerks was a lawyer in the case, while Scalia sat on the Washing
ton appeals court that already had heard the case.
Meanwhile, for the third week in a row, the eight justices
ignored appeals on several significant national issues, such as
whether the government may require its employees to take drug
tests. Instead, the court said it would hear arguments in less sig
nificant procedural cases, such as whether a lawyer who makes
a clerical error in an appeal can seek to correct the mistake in a
higher court.
Absent a ninth justice since the retirement of Lewis Powell
Jr., the court is left with four justice who often vote con
servatively and four who often vote liberally. The justices do
not explain why they decide to hear one appeal and not another.

Iran vows revenge for U.S. attack
KUWAIT — Iran yesterday accused the United States of
launching a "full-scale war" in the Persian Gulf and vowed to
avenge the American attack on its oil platform "with a crushing
blow."
Iran's chief of war information, Kamal Kharrazi, said in a
statement issued by the state news agency, "The United States
has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out
safely."
Later, President Ali Khamenei, speaking on state radio after a
meeting of the Supreme Defense Council, said Iran would "take
decisive retaliatory action," and he warned that "(President)
Reagan, by this action, has made a big mistake."
Arab leaders on the other side of the Persian Gulf praised the
U.S. military action in private, but distanced themselves in
public from any cooperation with the U.S. forces that might
draw a retaliatory blow from Iran.
In Kuwait, whose territory and oil-transport lifeline has been
most threatened by Iranian attacks, there was official silence
over the U.S. action. One Kuwaiti official, asked whether the
government would comment, said, "Why would there be any
comment? This does not concern Kuwait in any way."
Some Western sources in the region said they feared Iran
might take revenge against Arab oil platforms in the lower gulf
as it did last November after Iraq launched its first long-range
bombing raids against Iranian oil platforms and terminals in the
vicinity of yesterday's U.S. naval attack on an Iranian platform.
In Abu Dhabi, a presidential official said U.S. retaliation for
Iran's Silkworm missile attack on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti su
pertanker Sea Isle City, which blinded U.S. Capt. John Hunt
and injured 16 other crewmen, was "expected," but will not
succeed without a coherent U.S. policy to help end the seven
year war.
The Soviet yesterday denounced the U.S. attack.
Experts hear few echoes of 1929
NEW YORK — The stock market's breathtaking plunge has
evoked memories of the stock market crash of October 1929,
which burst the euphoria of a decade-long speculative bubble
and foreshadowed the Great Depression.
But though the parallels seem to grow daily, economists and
other analysts say the similarities are still far outweighed by the
differences between the current decline and the debacle of 1929.
Since the Great Crash, limits have been placed on borrowing for
stock purchases, government has assumed an active role in
regulating the markets and the economy, and nations have made
greater efforts to minimize international economic disruptions.
Today's economy is far stronger than the one that succumbed
to depression within three years of the 1929 market dive.
To be sure, yesterday's drop in the Dow Jones industrial
average has far overshadowed the losses suffered on Black
Monday — Oct. 28, 1929— when the Dow lost 12.82 percent of
its value. The index fell 508.32 points yesterday, to 1,738.42, for
a 22.62 percent loss that astonished the gloomiest of market
analysts.
Yet the market has a way to go to match the collapse that oc
curred between 1929 and 1932, when the market finally hit bot
tom. That decline represented nearly 90 percent of the Dow's
value; so far, the Dow has fallen 36.14 percent from its Aug. 25
peak of 2,722.42.
Even with yesterday's sell-off, the Dow is up 124 percent
from its level in August 1982, when the bull market began.
Nakasone decides on a successor
TOKYO — Japan's Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone today
named Noboru Takeshita, 63, a traditional consensus-builder,
to succeed him.
Three candidates entrusted Nakasone with the decision after
a round of talks that stretched over more than 12 hours failed to
produce agreement on who should be the new president of the
• ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Under Japan's parliamentary
style government, the leader of the party with the majority of
seats in Parliament also becomes prime minister.

kay-sh'tah), who commands the largest faction of followers
within the party that has ruled Japan since 1955.
