WASHINGTON â€” Four U.S. Navy
destroyers yesterday shelled and set ablaze
an oil platform used for Iranian military oper
ations in the central Persian Gulf in what the
administration called "a measured and ap
propriate response" to last week's Silkworm
missile attack on an American-flagged tanker
in Kuwaiti waters.

The warships pounded the Iranian military
platform 120 miles east of Bahrain with 1,000
rounds of heavy gunfire at 2 p.m. yesterday
(7 a.m. EDT) after giving the Iranians at the
facility a 20-minute warning to flee. The
Navy later dispatched explosives teams to
blow up a section of the installation that
survived the shelling. Pentagon officials said.

Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said
the former oil-drilling platform at Rashadat
housed radar and communications equipment
used to track convoys of U.S.-escorted
tankers and that Iranians used the facility to
"launch small boat attacks against non
belligerent shipping."
"It is a prudent yet restrained response to
this unlawful use of force against the United
States and to numerous violations of the
rights of other non-belligerents," President
Reagan said in a written statement.
Shortly after the warships shelled the first
installation, a team of Navy commandos
destroyed Iranian radar and communications
equipment on another platform about six
miles north. The attack, prompted when U.S.
forces spotted Iranians fleeing the facility,
was described by a Defense Department
spokesman as an unexpected "target of op

portunity" and had not been planned.
Iran's U.N. ambassador, Said Rajaie-
Khorassani, condemned the attack, saying
the United States "has opened an all-out war
against my country." But several Arab states
and numerous Western allies, including Brit
ain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, ap
plauded the strike.
Pentagon officials said no Americans were
injured in the attacks, and search and rescue
efforts have found no Iranians in the waters
nearby. Officials said they believe the 20 to
30 Iranians on the first platform escaped
before the firing started.
Weinberger said the United States plans to
take no further action in response to the
Iranian Silkworm missile attack on the
American-flagged Kuwaiti ship Sea Isle City
last Friday.
