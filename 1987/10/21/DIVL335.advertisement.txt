Ride 'em, cowboy!
The more things change, the
saying goes, the more things stay
the same. When he was five
years old, the rugged Westerner
celebrated his birthday by riding
his pony along the Oregon trail.
Today, the strapping young
Oregonian feels his oats in a
different way: He rides his 1984
Buick along Santa Teresa St. to
the Storke Publications Building.
Django lives, and so does Chris
Myers — more than ever.
Happy birthday,
Chris!
