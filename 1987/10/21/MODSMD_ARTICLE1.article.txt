The University Committee
on Minority Issues met for the
first time yesterday to discuss
goals and establish a tentative
working agenda to address
minority concerns at Stanford.
In a closed two-hour
meeting, committee chair and
Assoc. History Prof. Al
Camarillo outlined the operat
ing principles of the committee
and began what he called a
"prioritization of issues" to be
addressed.
Camarillo, the official
spokesperson for the commit
tee, said the impetus for the
committee began last May as
"a mandate taken from the
Rainbow Agenda and tran
slated into a committee that
will delve below the surface in
order to fully understand issues
germane to racial minorities."
The committee's responsibil
ities include "reviewing and re
examining existing policies"
that the University has estab
lished regarding ethnic minor
ities. Among the areas to be
studied are recruitment and un
dergraduate admissions, gradu
ation rates, the availability of
special counseling and advice
for minorities, allegations of
police harassment of minority
students and the Area One
Western Culture requirement.
"These aren't issues created
by minorities: these are prob
lems that have arisen within the
University that have produced

ill-affects on minorities,"
Camarillo said. "Our charge is
to investigate them.
"We are primarily concerned
with those things the Rainbow
Agenda proposed, but it will be
an elaboration of those
[demandsJ," Camarillo said.
Camarillo emphasized that
the committee will be an
"action committee with high

visibility. It won't just be a
fact-finding committee." He
said past committees have been
bogged down in facts rather
than "finding sensible resolu
tions to problems."
Because the committee is un
der the charge of University
