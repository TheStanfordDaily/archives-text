# Dow climbs, other stocks fall
## 
### 
Buoyed by lower interest rates
and a pledge that the Federal
Reserve would help ease the
crisis gripping world financial
markets, the stock market staged
a volatile and valiant but incom
plete rally yesterday as the Dow
Jones average of industrial
stocks posted its biggest one-day
point gain ever on record trading
volume.
However, many other stocks
not included in the Dow average
suffered further drubbing, with
investors still shaken by Mon
day's unprecedented and
panicky 508-point collapse. The
selling pressure indicated that
many investors fear the economy
may be headed for a recession

and that the worst for stock
prices may not be over. Losing
stocks outnumbered gainers by a
margin of more than five to two
on the New York Stock Ex
change,
Meanwhile, fallout from Mon
day's stock market meltdown
grew, as two small stock-trading
companies crippled by the crash
shut down or were taken over.
Individual investors, stunned by
Monday's collapse, continued to
withdraw money from stock
mutual funds or sold stocks to
pay off loans taken out to buy
shares at much higher prices.
Calls also grew in Congress for
tougher scrutiny of computerized
trading activities that contributed

to Monday's rout.
In wild trading, the Dow
average of 30 blue-chip stocks
finished with a gain of 102.27
points, surpassing its previous
one-day record gain of 75.23
points set Sept. 22, 1987. Yester
day's gain, to a close at 1841.01,
helped the widely watched Dow
average recover about a fifth of
its loss from Monday's collapse
and about one-ninth of its 938-
point decline since its peak Aug.
25.
Volume on the Big Board
totaled an estimated 608.12 mil
lion shares, just ahead of the pre
vious record of 604.33 million set
Monday.
On the overall market,

however, the hears still trampled
the bulls. Declining stocks
totaled 1399 compared to 537
gainers on the New York Stock
Exchange. Stocks traded on the
American Stock Exchange and
over-the-counter markets took a
beating, as two key indexes mea
suring the performance of those
shares each declined nearly 10
percent.
Many of the stocks that
declined were stocks in manufac
turing or transportation indus
tries that typically do poorly
during a recession, while those
that gained were in such indus
tries as utilities that generally do
well during an economic slow
down. L째 s Angeles Times
