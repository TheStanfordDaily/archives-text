# Airplane crashes in Indianapolis

INDIANAPOLIS — A disabled Air Force
Corsair jet clipped the roof of a bank and
slammed into a crowded hotel near the inter
national airport here yesterday after the pilot
failed to make an emergency landing and
ejected safely from the plane.
Authorities said that nine people on the
ground were killed as the front of the hotel, a
seven-story Ramada Inn, erupted in a
fireball. Six other persons were reported
injured — one critically with severe burns
over most of his body.
Investigators continued to sift through the
charred and twisted wreckage of the hotel
late yesterday looking for bodies, but by
nightfall officials said they did not believe
they would find any further casualties. The
hotel had registered 103 overnight guests and
housed another 20 employees and an addi
tional 40 to 50 persons attending conferences

at the time of the crash.
Air Force technicians were conducting the
investigation into the crash rather than inves
tigators from the National Transportation
Safety Board, which probes accidents involv
ing civilian craft.
The Air Force identified the pilot, the sole
occupant of the aging, single engine A-7 Cor
sair jet, as Maj. Bruce Teagarden, 35, of
Mount Morris, Pa. He is stationed at Nellis
Air Force Base in Las Vegas.
A military spokesman said that Teagarden
was testing the aircraft's on-board electronic
systems on a flight from Pittsburgh to Nellis
when the engine "flamed out" 15 miles south
of Indianapolis at an altitude of 31,000 feet.
The cause of the power failure had not been
determined, the spokesman said.
After radioing a "mayday" emergency call
to air traffic controllers, Teagarden steered

his rapidly descending aircraft toward In
dianapolis but came out of a cloud layer at
too high an altitude to set down on the 10,000-
foot main runway, according to airport direc
tor Robert Spitler. He said controllers then
told Teagarden to make a right turn and land
on a perpendicular runway, but they lost him
from their radar screens at 1300 teet.
In the turn, Teagarden's speed apparently
dropped and he lost control of the plane.
Before he ejected from the aircraft he told
controllers he "had to get out and was
looking for a vacant field."
At 9:15 a.m., the pilotless plane scraped
the top of the one-story Bank One branch of
fice across busy Interstate 74 from the air
port, caromed off a side street and plowed
into the center of the hotel just above the
lobby.
