# Pendleton lashes out at affirmative action
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
Reaffirming his controversial stand
against affirmative action, Clarence
Pendleton Jr., director of the U.S. Civil
Rights Commission, said yesterday that
affirmative action is "white liberal guilt"
that discredits individual achievement.
"[I want) off this 20th-century planta
tion," Pendleton told a group of Stanford
Law School students at a lunchtime
speech in Kresge Auditorium.
Pendleton, a Reagan appointee and the
first black to head the Civil Rights Com
mission, attacked a Supreme Court ruling
in a Santa Clara County affirmative action
case, saying the high court had
''legitimized a new kind of discrimina
tion" in upholding a program that gave
minorities and women preference in job
placement.
"I contend, in the case of civil rights,
that affirmative action is a form of mis
chief on the Constitution," he said.
Pendleton claimed that giving preference
to certain groups designates them as
minorities and creates opposing factions, a
scenario feared by the framers of the Con
stitution.
"I knew I was a discriminated black.

but I did not know I was a minority until
1964 (when the Civil Rights Act was
passed)," Pendleton said.
According to Pendleton, all legislative
gains for blacks came before 1960. Now
there is a "long list of phony rights" con
cerning race and gender, Pendleton said,
adding that black social advancement can
only come from education, migration and
the capitalist tradition of the United
States.
Calling for a "dynamic, free economy,"
Pendleton said the government has no ob
ligation to reduce economic disparity be
tween different classes, because
governmental intervention means a loss of
"precious moral freedoms" and will cause
a decline in economic growth.
The Civil Rights Commission, which
makes recommendations to the president
regarding civil rights, is "facing extinc
tion" because of congressional budget
cuts, Pendleton said, criticizing Congress
for "wanting to manage executive policy"
by controlling the budget.
Pendleton also criticized Congress for
its handling of the nomination of Robert
Bork to the Supreme Court. "They (the
Senate) tend to look for foul-ups, and if
they do not find them, they keep looking,"
he said.
