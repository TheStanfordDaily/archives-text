Vandals defaced several color
photographs on display in the Coftee
House last week, according to Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herring
ton.
The slashed 8-by-l() prints were
discovered by Coffee House
manager Jeff Lougee, who reported
the incident to the police at 9 a.m.
Sunday.

The photos were part of a month
long exhibit called "Paradise
Developed," a portrayal of land de
velopment in Southern California.
According to photographer Susan
Hinton, 10 of 15 exhibited photos
were cut with razor blades or
damaged with a "coffee-like" sub
stance.
According to Herrington, the van
dalism most likely occurred between
7 p.m. Friday and 9 a.m. Sunday.
He said there were reports of "a

couple of people who were agitated
at different times," hut that the
police have no concrete leads at this
point.
Hinton said "the work was in
tended to he socially critical, hut not
in a confrontational manner."
She said she has displayed work
of a more controversial character in
other locations and has never had
prints vandalized. "One certainly
does not expect this sort of thing at
Stanford," she said.
