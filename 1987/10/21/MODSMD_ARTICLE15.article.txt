hor the third time, university presidents
polled by U.S. News & World Report have
ranked Stanford as the nation's best undergradu
ate institution.
Stanford's consistent placement among
America's best universities should give us pause
to consider what makes Stanford excellent and
in what ways it needs to improve.
Human resources — the faculty and the stu
dents — make Stanford a remarkable university,
as they also make Chicago, Yale and UC-
Berkeley great universities.
But Stanford succeeds in areas in which other
large, research-oriented universities have not.
Stanford has developed an institutional
flexibility, for example, which is foreign to the
Ivy League and rewards the motivated student.
Nor do most of the other schools on the U.S.
News list have as accessible a faculty as does
Stanford.
However, Stanford must not be lulled into
complacency by external affirmations of its ex
cellence. Its undergraduate program has serious
flaws, the most glaring of which is the adminis
tration's abdication of the intellectual leadership
that it is paid to provide.
This lack of leadership manifests itself in Stan
ford's weak system of distribution requirements.
Aside from the lack of challenge provided by

many of these courses, it is difficult to see a
pedagogical theory behind the system. Exposing
students to a variety of fields is a laudable goal,
but the system currently does not provide a
coherent program of liberal thought. Rather, it is
a shortcut which spares the University its task of
thinking seriously about what constitutes an ed
ucation.
The leadership problem at Stanford is also
mirrored in many of the academic departments.
Requirements for departmental majors often do
little to foster a cohesive knowledge of the disci
pline. At their worst, they occupy units without
providing the intellectual guidance that a major
deserves.
Stanford must provide some degree of intel
lectual direction and focus if students other than
a self-motivated few are to intelligently exploit
its flexibility. A better advising system would do
much to move the University in this direction.
Stanford must create an advising system that
consistently provides students with the guidance
they need.
As long as the University sees its task as
keeping students and faculty happy — as long as
it sees its job as custodial rather than pedagogi
cal — the students will not receive the education
that their intellects deserve and that their money
should be buying.
