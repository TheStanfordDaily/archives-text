## Purely educational or not? 
### 
On Tuesday, Oct. 6, the Bran
ner lecture series presented
"Oliver North's Contra Slide
Show," which was interrupted
midway through by an anti
contra protester. I was that
protester. I would like to
describe the reasoning behind my
actions.

I hope to add to the ongoing
debate of whether there can be
such a thing as a "purely educa
tional" discussion of inherently
political topics such as U.S. in
tervention in Central America.
While slides were being shown
of supposed Soviet hegemonic
activities and the evening's
moderator read the script of
North's comments before the
Iran-contra congressional com
mittee, I disrupted the slide show
by attempting to grab the slide
carousel. Some people in the au
dience apparently believed that I
was trying to terminate the show
and thus deny them their right to
review North's propaganda and
draw their own conclusions. On
the contrary, my intention was
merely to disrupt the show and
make a series of statements â€”
statements, I might add, which a
broad cross-section of Ameri
cans have been struggling for the
past five years to make to the
people of the United States.
What was the purpose in dis
rupting this event? A disruption
was necessary, because the
event was being held under the
pretenses of simply being, as the

moderator put it, "educational."
These pretenses were
problematic for two reasons.
First, Branner Resident Fellow
Kennell Jackson, who arranged
the slide show, released a state
ment to the San Francisco
Chronicle two days before the
show that indicated his intentions
were not purely educational. If
the slide show was intended sim
ply to engage in educational ex
ploratibn, Jackson 1 should not
have made a statement with such
political overtones -K) a major
newspaper.
The second reason that
viewing the slide show as purely
educational was problematic was
that in doing so one risked reduc
ing a war that has destroyed
more than 10,000 lives to a
scholastic debate.

. . . it is not appropri
ate for North's drivel
to be presented in a
cold, calculating man
ner.

In February of this year, as a
master's student at the Harvard
School of Public Health, I
travelled to Nicaragua with a
team of researchers to study the
health effects of the war on the
civilian population. We were
given the freedom to choose to
which villages we would travel
and were allowed to speak freely
to hundreds of Nicaraguans, both
in and outside of the war zone.
While witnessing the effects of

contra terrorism, 1 struggled with
the idea of performing an aca
demic study for publication in
some scholastic journal. The
conclusion I came to was that it
is not appropriate to simply try to
quantify the Nicaraguan people's
pain and suffering into tidy aca
demic packages; there must be
an integration of the people's
spirit, emotions and struggle.
Similarly, it is not appropriate
for Oliver North's geopolitical
drivel to be presented in a cold,
calculating manner. Rather, it
must be accompanied by ex
pressions of outrage justified by
the pain we are inflicting on the
people of Central America. Thus,
my disruption of the slide show.
People say they heard me ex
claim, "This is garbage. The con
tras are killing people." Critics
say this was merely stating the
obvious, and that in making these
statements, I gave no explana
tion or chance for rebuttal.
What 1 in fact said was, "This
is garbage. The contras are kil
ling people in Nicaragua. They're
raping people and destroying
health clinics. Why don't you
show slides of the people the
contras have raped?" Perhaps
only the moderator and the Bran
ner RA escorting me toward the
door heard me shout these state
ments. Hopefully, other mem
bers of the Stanford community
who were present that evening
heard my statements and will log
the emotions behind them along
with the "purely educational" in
formation displayed in the North
slides.
