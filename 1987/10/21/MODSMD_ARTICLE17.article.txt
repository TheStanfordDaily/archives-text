Asking for fairer,
positive portrait
In response to your editorial,
"Greek reform, maybe" (Daily,
Oct. 14), we, pledges of a housed
fraternity, would like to first
state that we agree that our fra
ternity system is not without flaw
and needs improvement.
However, in light of your un
provoked criticism, we write to
you in an attempt to elicit your
aid and not your cynicism.
It is difficult for us to respond
to your accusation of sexism, be
cause undoubtedly it does exist.
However, our personal experi
ences have shown that sexist atti
tudes are not more "inherent" to
fraternities than they are to dor
mitories.
We do not deny that alcohol is
more readily consumed in frater
nities than anywhere else on
campus. But, the charge that
"drinking fisj an almost compul
sory part of the application proc
ess (by peer pressure and/or tra
dition if not by rule)" is purely
sensationalistic. As one-time rus
hees, the drinking we observed at
Rush parties was purely social
and in no way mandatory.
As for your charge of

"minority underrepresentation,"
we would like to pose a question
to the Daily editorial staff as food
for thought: Do fraternities
segregate intentionally, or is it
that influential publications such
as yours plant preconceived no
tions of racial selectivity in the
minds of prospective minority
rushees? Our house's minority
attendance at Rush functions
supports the latter.
We are pleased that The Daily
sees encouragement in the IFC's
actions. What we ask for is your
encouragement in a more sub
stantial way. Our collective
public service records don't
seem to find their way into your
bylines. This past weekend,
members of the Greek system
participated in the Delta Gamma
Anchor Splash, which raised
over $500 for a charitable organi
zation. Yet, there was no men
tion of this event in The Daily.
Because we are easily identifi
able and in privileged housing,
we recognize our added responsi
bility to the Stanford community.
We heed your remarks, but ask
for a fairer, less pessimistic
portrait of fraternities.

Exercise might
effect change
I wish to commend the staff of
The Daily for coming out against
problems with Stanford's phone
system (Daily, Oct. 16). In the
editorial, there was a discussion
of the inadequacies in our current
system and how long it takes to
get a phone connected and to get
everyone's phone number pub
lished. While the editorial's stand
will meet with as much opposi
tion as an editorial in favor of
stopping cancer, it is bringing to
public attention what has in the
past been relegated to private
complaining.
However, I am disappointed
with the editorial staff for not
going further and proposing a
substantial solution to the prob
lem. Saying "UCLA and USC
have good systems, why don't
we?" is not acceptable. Hither
the authors failed to research the
subject enough and could not
come up with a solution, a
mistake which is reminiscent of
sloppy high school journalism, or
no solution exists, in which case
it was pointless to write about
Stanford's phone system woes in
the first place.
Doubting that Pacific Bell has
led us into a telecommunications

snafu, I encourage the staff of
The Daily to pursue this issue
further and to report to the Stan
ford community on its findings.
Perhaps it will discover that if the
University puts some pressure
on Pacific Bell to reform, our
problems will be solved. Perhaps
it will learn that in this age of the
disbanded Ma Bell, if the phone
company is unreceptive to our
demands, it will be time to look
elsewhere for phone service.
I his exercise will not only help
the Daily's writers to hone their
journalistic skills, but will also
enable The Daily to help effect
social change and to move away
from its habit of soap-box
preaching.
