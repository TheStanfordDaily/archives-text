# Etiquette for bike accidents
## 
### 
I'm glad my first column was about how to make
introductions. Over the last two weeks, I've met
some very interesting and memorable people.
Laurie, for example, who will forever be
emblazoned on my mind as "the woman who stuck
a small plastic egg, a "Chicken Logo,' up her nose
when she was four, just to impress her little
friends." And Chris, whose "high school physics
teacher had a head shaped like a lizard's." If
everybody else picked up on our lead, wouldn't
Stanford be a better place? And I've got plenty of
other suggestions about how to change things
around the Farm.

For starters, Stanford students excel at many,
many things, but they are total amateurs at bike
wrecks. No one around this place knows quite
what to do when an accident looks inevitable, and I
must say I am not impressed with bicyclists' con
duct just before, during and after the actual crash.
Whenever anyone gets hurt in a bike wreck,
though, the situation is not funny at all. Chipped
teeth, broken limbs and facial scabs defy
categorization as good punchlines. So, to envision
the proper scenario for the next few paragraphs,
assume the bike wrecks referred to are garden
variety "Oh my God — I'm so sorry — are you
OK?" tire-bumps-bike-frame accidents.
Several general tips:
•When riding your bike, keep your tongue in
your mouth. Your odds of biting it off become less
favorable. Speech problems for the rest of your life
are good to avoid.
•Engaging oncoming bike traffic with some of
your innate charm cannot hurt. It might actually
thwart your getting slammed to the ground. Eye
contact, a pleasant smile and a menacing growl all
seem to be effective. Be provocative. But don't
panic. If you do, your bike will become a magnet
that will violently attract all other cyclists in the
vicinity, creating a terrifying melee of tangled and
thrashing rubber and chrome.
•This eye-contact routine becomes important
again once you've been bashed by another bike
rider. At this point, generous conferral of guilt is
pivotal, and the more of an identity you have estab
lished, the easier it will be for you to make others

feel excruciating remorse. The Guilt Game. Whew!
You thought you'd left it at home with Mom and
Dad. But it operates with a vengeance on the Farm.
•Now that your assailant has seen your face,
twist it in agony and yip like a kicked dog. This
adds quickly to the Guilt Factor. Tell the other
cyclists you're pregnant or blind. Immediate and
well-deserved guilt. Cry, whether you're male or
female, especially if no one came near being injured
in the accident. That never fails to embarrass your
audience of macabre gawkers, and they'll feel free
to share their eyewitness account with roommates
and anyone else who's forced to listen. Give them
their five seconds worth. You'll be the topic of din
ner table conversation for several evenings run
ning, I assure you.
•If, by some odd warp of fate, you are the one
who causes the accident, 1 can think of two things
to say that will disqualify you from the Guilt Game,
and perhaps even frighten the other bike-wreck
participants. Either tell them "the voices" in
structed you to cause the collision, or just say —
loudly — "Did you see that?! It was huge!!" (Be
sure to speak the additional punctuation marks.)
I've seen both of these lines work. But whatever
you do, apologize gushingly and sincerely, and
make sure all fellow victims are all right. Riding
away, even if you are in a hurry, is a major mistake.
Face it, you'd be simply hurling yourself onward to
another couple of wrecks by the time you reach
your destination anyway.
One other consideration: I've neglected to ac
count for the literally billions of single-bike acci
dents that occur every year, especially the stu
dent/bollard and student/landscaping-architecture
interactions. People on bikes at Stanford lose con
trol of their senses when they are confronted with
an obviously immobile object. No, the concrete
post in front of you will not skip out of the way
when it sees you coming. Trees generally will not
bend to make way for errant bicyclists. You must
admire, however, some of the budding particle field
physicists that insist upon testing the solidity of the
obstacles around them — but only when someone
is watching to corroborate their story.
A final note: It you've struck a campus celebrity
with your bike (e.g.. President Donald Kennedy, or
anyone else with a title before his or her name),
hide — and hide well — for the remainder of your
Stanford career, l'hey know where you live. Or
else own up to your claim to fame as "the poor
guy/gal that careened off Dean Jean in White Plaza
and was subsequently exiled across the Bay, deep,
deep into Weenieland." Choose carefully.

•Now that your assailant has seen your face,
twist it in agony and yip like a kicked dog. This
adds quickly to the Guilt Factor. Tell the other
cyclists you're pregnant or blind. Immediate and
well-deserved guilt. Cry, whether you're male or
female, especially if no one came near being injured
in the accident. That never fails to embarrass your
audience of macabre gawkers, and they'll feel free
to share their eyewitness account with roommates
and anyone else who's forced to listen. Give them
their five seconds worth. You'll be the topic of din
ner table conversation for several evenings run
ning, I assure you.
•If, by some odd warp of fate, you are the one
who causes the accident, 1 can think of two things
to say that will disqualify you from the Guilt Game,
and perhaps even frighten the other bike-wreck
participants. Either tell them "the voices" in
structed you to cause the collision, or just say —
loudly — "Did you see that?! It was huge!!" (Be
sure to speak the additional punctuation marks.)
I've seen both of these lines work. But whatever
you do, apologize gushingly and sincerely, and
make sure all fellow victims are all right. Riding
away, even if you are in a hurry, is a major mistake.
Face it, you'd be simply hurling yourself onward to
another couple of wrecks by the time you reach
your destination anyway.
One other consideration: I've neglected to ac
count for the literally billions of single-bike acci
dents that occur every year, especially the stu
dent/bollard and student/landscaping-architecture
interactions. People on bikes at Stanford lose con
trol of their senses when they are confronted with
an obviously immobile object. No, the concrete
post in front of you will not skip out of the way
when it sees you coming. Trees generally will not
bend to make way for errant bicyclists. You must
admire, however, some of the budding particle field
physicists that insist upon testing the solidity of the
obstacles around them — but only when someone
is watching to corroborate their story.
A final note: It you've struck a campus celebrity
with your bike (e.g.. President Donald Kennedy, or
anyone else with a title before his or her name),
hide — and hide well — for the remainder of your
Stanford career, l'hey know where you live. Or
else own up to your claim to fame as "the poor
guy/gal that careened off Dean Jean in White Plaza
and was subsequently exiled across the Bay, deep,
deep into Weenieland." Choose carefully.

I'm glad my first column was about how to make
introductions. Over the last two weeks, I've met
some very interesting and memorable people.
Laurie, for example, who will forever be
emblazoned on my mind as "the woman who stuck
a small plastic egg, a "Chicken Logo,' up her nose
when she was four, just to impress her little
friends." And Chris, whose "high school physics
teacher had a head shaped like a lizard's." If
everybody else picked up on our lead, wouldn't
Stanford be a better place? And I've got plenty of
other suggestions about how to change things
around the Farm.

For starters, Stanford students excel at many,
many things, but they are total amateurs at bike
wrecks. No one around this place knows quite
what to do when an accident looks inevitable, and I
must say I am not impressed with bicyclists' con
duct just before, during and after the actual crash.
Whenever anyone gets hurt in a bike wreck,
though, the situation is not funny at all. Chipped
teeth, broken limbs and facial scabs defy
categorization as good punchlines. So, to envision
the proper scenario for the next few paragraphs,
assume the bike wrecks referred to are garden
variety "Oh my God — I'm so sorry — are you
OK?" tire-bumps-bike-frame accidents.
Several general tips:
•When riding your bike, keep your tongue in
your mouth. Your odds of biting it off become less
favorable. Speech problems for the rest of your life
are good to avoid.
•Engaging oncoming bike traffic with some of
your innate charm cannot hurt. It might actually
thwart your getting slammed to the ground. Eye
contact, a pleasant smile and a menacing growl all
seem to be effective. Be provocative. But don't
panic. If you do, your bike will become a magnet
that will violently attract all other cyclists in the
vicinity, creating a terrifying melee of tangled and
thrashing rubber and chrome.
•This eye-contact routine becomes important
again once you've been bashed by another bike
rider. At this point, generous conferral of guilt is
pivotal, and the more of an identity you have estab
lished, the easier it will be for you to make others

feel excruciating remorse. The Guilt Game. Whew!
