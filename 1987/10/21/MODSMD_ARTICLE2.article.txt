# Budget process reorganized
## 
### Jason Bloomstein 
Provost James Rosse will an
nounce today a new plan to
decentralize responsibility for
the University's budget process.
The proposed system, called
"block budgeting," was devel
oped over the last two years to
make Stanford's budgeting proc
ess more efficient, according to
Rosse.
Under the new system, the
provost will provide budget
guidelines to various schools and
departments which will in turn
propose ways in which funds can
be spent for specific needs within
each department. After specific
needs have been specified, the

provost and his staff will then
review each plan for possible ap
proval.
According to Rosse, the new
system will be effective because
"the provost is well situated to
decide, with advice, which parts
of the University need more or
less monetary emphasis.
"We want to see the big
picture," he said.
The block budget system will
work on a three-year plan, and
because Rosse claims the Uni
versity is facing a "tough budget
year," departments will be en
couraged to consider long-range
gOills.
Under the current system,
called line-item budgeting, the

provost must approve a depart
mental request for each specific
purchase. Rosse said line-item
budgeting creates "an emphasis
on small things year by year."
The current system is ineffi
cient because "the best expertise
is not being brought to bear on
every problem," Rosse said.
"The provost does not always
know everything."
Rosse said the decision to
change the budget process was
not a result of Monday's crash of
the New York Stock Exchange.
The University has been plan
ning the change for two years and
has been in the process of imple
menting the new system, he said.
Although Stanford's financial
situation is "not dire," Rosse
said the crash "does emphasize
that changes need to be made" in
the budget process.
"The University may not have
as many resources as we thought
without some changes in the
budget process," he added. He
said the shortfall is due to
projected lower income from the
endowment caused by a fluctuat
ing stock market, and from high
expectations raised by the Cen
tennial campaign.
