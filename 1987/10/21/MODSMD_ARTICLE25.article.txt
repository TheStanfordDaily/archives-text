## Band gears to release first album in 5 years 
### Michelle Finkel Vivian Vice 
For everyone anxiously await
ing publication of the book being
written about the Stanford Band,
the release of the Band's new al
bum may be enjoyed in the in
terim.
"It's nice to have something
updated that alumni and students
can buy so they become familiar
with the Band," Drum Major
Pete Adamy said.
The Band has sporadically
released recordings over the
years, he said, adding that it last
released an album in 1983.
The Band's album-making tra
dition dates back to earlier in the
century, when it was still a mili
tary organization. However, the
newest album, which is being
coordinated by Adamy, a senior,
and producer Jon Sherman, a
sophomore, should make it clear
that the Band and its music have
changed significantly since then.
The 1987 recording will include
modern songs such as
"Sledgehammer" and "Things
Can Only Get Better." Band
classics such as "Hail Stanford,
Hail" and the group's jazzed-up
rendition of the national anthem
will also appear on the release.
The final product will consist of
20 songs and will be released by
Big Game week this year.
The group chose to produce an
album because "the Band is
sounding really good this year,"
according to Sherman. Adamy
added that profit was not a moti

vation behind the album.
Adamy said he is unsure if the
Band's improved performance is
related to the fact that the group
is no longer allowed to drink al
cohol during football games.
"Every section we have this
year is good," Adamy said.

'It's a major feat to get
off a good-sounding
album with the Band.'

Adamy, who chose the songs
that will appear on the album,
said the absence of a live audi
ence is a departure from the
Band's previous recordings.
"The focus on this [recording] is
definitely the music," Adamy
said.
Half of the funds for the al
bum's production came from
ASSU loans and the remainder
came from Band savings, he said.
The price of the album, which
will be sold in the Stanford
Bookstore, has not yet been set,
but will range from six to eight
dollars. Producers said they ex
pect Stanford students, Band
members, their parents and Band
alumni to be the major pur
chasers of the album.
Organizers produced 3000
copies of the 1983 album. Of that
total 1500 copies have been sold
in five years. Adamy said he has
yet to decide how many copies

will be made of the 1987 record
ing.
Sherman and Adamy, although
hesitant to reveal much about the
album's cover, said it will include
pictures, writing and photo
graphs taken by Band photogra
pher Robbie Beyers. They did
say the cover will be humorous.
"There are some twists" to the
album jacket, Sherman said.
The album was recorded last
Tuesday and Thursday in Dinkel

spiel Auditorium. All Band mem
bers were included. "It was ex
tremely loud . . . ear blowing
loud," freshman Jeff Fox said of
the sessions.
According to Adamy, the pro
duction of the album has not
been free of obstacles. "It's a
major feat to get off a good
sounding album with the Band,"
Adamy said.
It was a difficult project to
coordinate over the summer, ac

cording to Sherman, who was ap
proached only last spring with
the offer to produce the album.
The Band is now pushed for time
to complete the album before its
scheduled release.
"It's incredibly difficult to get
anything done . . . when the
Band is not together, because it's
definitely important to get the
Band's input on what's going into
the album. It's hard enough to
get one decision out of 150

people, and then you think, it's
150 people in the Stanford
Band," Sherman said.
Despite the difficulties, Sher
man and Adamy have remained
enthusiastic. There are numerous
reasons why the album has a
good chance of succeeding, ac
cording to Adamy.
First, he said, the Band has not
released an album for several
years. Also, the book about the
Band, due out by next year, has
generated more interest in the or
ganization.
Most importantly, Adamy
said, the Band is now in the spot
light because of the controversy
generated by its behavior at foot
ball games and suspension last
year. Rolling Stone magazine
recently focused on this contro
versy in a Sept. 24 article about
the Band.
"That's [it] probably more
than any reason," Adamy said,
referring to the Band's raucous
reputation.
According to Sherman, sales
may also increase because the re
cording will be released on cas
sette as well in album form. If the
Band decides to release an album
next year, it may be released on
compact disc, he added.
Publicity for the release will in
clude advertisements in the Stan
ford Observer and The Daily.
Sherman said he is also planning
an album-signing session with the
entire Band.
"The good thing about [the
record] is that everybody has
been really keyed," Adamy said.
