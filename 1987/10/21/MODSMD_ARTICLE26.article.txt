## The 						fledgling student channel to make a new start X-TV: the do-it-yourself television networK

Anyone can get an idea made," according to
Wink Thorne, the general manager of X-TV, the
student-run cable television channel at Stanford.
At X-rV's first organizational meeting of the
year, Thorne told the nearly 70 students in atten
dance that if they come up with an idea for a pro
gram, submit a proposal and gain approval, they'll
be given access to the channel's equipment. Once
they are trained, however, students are expected to
produce, shoot and edit their own material.
1 his loose, informal system of production seems
to epitomize the general state of affairs for the
financially weak, equipment-starved, fledgling stu
dent channel. The promotion of a do-it-yourself TV
network is ostensibly part of Thome's plan to get
people involved in the organization. "The big thing
here is getting people excited so they can take the
initiative to get projects started," Thorne said.
If X-TV sounds a bit unorganized, it's probably
because the channel has only been in existence for
about a year. The student channel was initiated by
last year's general manager, Alexander Danel. "I
found out that SUNet (the campus-wide Stanford
University Cable Network) had made provisions
for a channel to go to the students. I also found out
that SITN (the Stanford Instructional Television
Network) had already laid the groundwork by get
ting students trained, so I got a list of students who
were interested, and that's how things got started,"
Danel said.
Because of equipment and budget restrictions,
the student channel originally aired only a few
hours on certain days of the week. Programming
largely consisted of locally produced programs,
such as talk shows, guest lectures, sports shows
and other student-produced endeavors, the most
notable of which was a soap opera.
The soap opera, called "General Dormitory,"
was a campy send-up of soap operas with an all-
Stanford cast. Reactions to the show were mixed.
Some, like Danel, thought it was a good produc
tion. Others, like senior Chip Catalano, one of the
show's writers, were dismayed with the content.
"It was good that there were a lot of people
working on this thing, but it didn't seem important
to the producer that the script was great; it was just
important that something got done," Catalano said.

Danel said that people expected more from the
newborn student channel than it was capable of
delivering. "People wanted another MTV," he
said. But the station's severely limited resources
prevented it from producing the type of program
ming people expected.
Criticism of its programming, problems with or
ganization and the lack of funding and equipment
all combined to produce a rocky beginning for the
student channel. But Danel said he accomplished
what he had intended to. "All I set out to do was to
get a band width," he said. "I feel I've built a foun
dation started in an area where the interest is suffi
ciently automatic. This organization will go on for
decades, and I'm very proud of what I've done."
Thorne is confident that the network this year is
a little more organized and settled, and he's excited
about the new productions in the works, including
a sports program, a news program, a game show
and a fictional comedy-drama series that centers
around the experiences of students during their
first year at Stanford. In addition, programming
from NCTV (National College Television) will "be
the backbone of the station," Thorne said.
Despite being optimistic about the new program
ming possibilities, Thorne is concerned at the mo
ment about the shortage of video equipment. He
did say, however, that the station is expecting
some new equipment in the near future.
Furthermore, X-TV Business Manager Cheryl
Parnell said at the organizational meeting that the
station has managed to acquire a $40,000 budget,
which will hopefully be supplemented by gifts of
money or equipment from manufacturers and pro
duction companies.
The Stanford Communication Department has in
the past given whatever support and spare equip
ment it has available, but that apparently has not
been sufficient. Communication Prof. Henry
Breitrose said the department is caught in a difficult
predicament with X-TV. "We're interested in en
couraging what the student channel is up to, but
our budget is designed to support our own teaching
and resources . . . and we have more than enough
problems supporting ourselves," he said.
Whether the Communication Department should
aid the student channel is a question that cuts right
to the heart of X-TV's existence. Thorne said he
wants X-TV to be as independent an entity as The
Daily or KZSU (neither of which has any connec

tion with the Communication Department), but
with that independence comes self-sufficiency.
Minimal support from the Communication De
partment is fine, according to Danel, because the
network is primarily a service-oriented organiza
tion. While experience at the station can benefit
those interested in the entertainment and broad
casting industry, the student channel is not geared
toward intense vocational training. "People who
want to go into film and TV should go to UCLA,"
he said.
Thorne has a different view, however. He sees
the student channel being as beneficial to the
people working on the inside as it is to people
watching on the outside. "Video is a really new
medium. We're giving students a chance to use it as

an artistic form of expression as well as an informa
tional form of expression," Thorne said.
Thorne hopes this is the year X-TV will be
noticed by a wide audience. "For this year, I hope
to accomplish consistently good programming with
1000 to 2000 viewers. I want everyone to know
about X-TV. I want X-TV to be acknowleged as one
of the media groups on campus," Thorne said.
Can the student channel succeed? Ultimately, its
future rests on its ability to stir up enough creative
and financial interest to get the wheels turning in
the right direction. Thorne admits, though, that this
task is not an easy one. "We're trying to run a
whole television station here on student time," he
said.
