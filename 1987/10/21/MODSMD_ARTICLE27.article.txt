## Scrap playoff notion for college football 
### 
There's been a lot of talk
recently about instituting a
playoff system to determine the
champion of college football. The
whole idea is ridiculous.

Granted, the current system is
not ideal. But college football
playoffs would be a disaster.
Most teams already play an ll
game schedule which starts
either at the very beginning ofthe
fall term or, as in Stanford's
case, well before school begins.
Schools generally play until
late November —just a week or
two before finals, in other words.
If a team is lucky enough to make
a bowl game, the game usually
takes place during Christmas
break or at the start of the next
quarter or semester.
In order to hold playoffs, the
NCAA would have to determine
how many schools to invite to the
championship tournament. The
NCAA basketball tournament,
for instance, gives berths to 64
teams. It goes six rounds. Obvi
ously, this would not be feasible
for football. Six weeks worth of
playoff games would be down
right tedious.
So the question remains: How
many teams? Thirty-two teams
wouldn't be much better; it
would still take five weeks. Even
just 16 teams would take four
weeks.

Furthermore, who chooses
which teams get bids? The
coaches? Their poll already
determines the national cham
pion even without a playoff sys
tem. The NCAA? That just or
ganization that would never think
of picking one football team over
another, because one team might
be a traditional powerhouse and
bring higher television revenues?
If a playoff system did not
have enough teams, which, given
the time constraints, is likely,
then be prepared to see the same
teams year after year. Success,
after all, breeds success, espe
cially for a college football pro
gram which has to compete
against everyone in the country
for players.
In order to institute a playoff
system, one of two equally unac
ceptable things must take place.
The first would be to shorten the
regular season from II or so
games to maybe eight or nine
games.
There's another option. Play
10 or 1 1 games and start the
playoffs immediately after the
regular season. Right through
finals and Christmas. With luck,
they'll finish right around the
start of the next semester.
Obviously, neither of these
proposals is feasible. No one
wants to lose conference games
or valued non-conference oppo
nents. And no one wants to play
14 or 15 games a season.
College football playoffs would
be a travesty. And Stanford
would probably never go to the
national tournament. Plus, what
would they call the Rose Bowl
Parade if there were no Rose
Bowl?
