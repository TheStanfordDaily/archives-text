# Kennedy assails activists
## Attacks animal-rights groups in speech before L.A. alumni 
### Leslie Hatamiya Staff writer 
In a speech to 350 Stanford and
Harvard alumni in Los Angeles
last night, University President
Donald Kennedy again criticized
animal rights activists in an ad
dress that emphasized the
responsibilty of American uni
versities to provide leadership
and innovation.
Following a talk by Harvard
President Derek Bok on univer
sities and international competi
tion, Kennedy chided those who
block construction of and picket
animal research facilities as part
"of what is loosely called the
animal rights movement."
Kennedy's talk focused on
what he considered to be the two
principal enemies of research in
the United States: a negative
shift in the public attitude toward
scientific research and the
shortage of necessary research
facilities and equipment.

Kennedy criticized the federal
government for failing to provide
adequate funding to maintain a
"stable capital infrastructure" —
the buildings, equipment and
overhead needed to support

university-based research pro
grams.
However, Kennedy said the
greater "enemies of innovation"
are the prevailing negative atti
tudes toward research and re
search institutions.
Kennedy assailed the tactics of
animal-rights groups protesting
the use of experimental animals
in research, just as he did in his
Oct. 9 address at the National In
stitutes of Health centennial ban
quet in San Francisco.
"The movement says it wants
better housing and treatment for
laboratory animals, yet does its
best to prevent construction of
facilities that will provide them,"
Kennedy said last night.
"A safe conclusion from these
clear differences between asser
tion and action is that there is an
other agenda working here —
one that has less to do with
animals and their welfare than it
