# Kennedy assails activists
## Attacks animal-rights groups in speech before L.A. alumni 
### Leslie Hatamiya Staff writer 
In a speech to 350 Stanford and
Harvard alumni in Los Angeles
last night, University President
Donald Kennedy again criticized
animal rights activists in an ad
dress that emphasized the
responsibilty of American uni
versities to provide leadership
and innovation.
Following a talk by Harvard
President Derek Bok on univer
sities and international competi
tion, Kennedy chided those who
block construction of and picket
animal research facilities as part
"of what is loosely called the
animal rights movement."
Kennedy's talk focused on
what he considered to be the two
principal enemies of research in
the United States: a negative
shift in the public attitude toward
scientific research and the
shortage of necessary research
facilities and equipment.

Kennedy criticized the federal
government for failing to provide
adequate funding to maintain a
"stable capital infrastructure" —
the buildings, equipment and
overhead needed to support

university-based research pro
grams.
However, Kennedy said the
greater "enemies of innovation"
are the prevailing negative atti
tudes toward research and re
search institutions.
Kennedy assailed the tactics of
animal-rights groups protesting
the use of experimental animals
in research, just as he did in his
Oct. 9 address at the National In
stitutes of Health centennial ban
quet in San Francisco.
"The movement says it wants
better housing and treatment for
laboratory animals, yet does its
best to prevent construction of
facilities that will provide them,"
Kennedy said last night.
"A safe conclusion from these
clear differences between asser
tion and action is that there is an
other agenda working here —
one that has less to do with
animals and their welfare than it


Donald Kennedy
has to do with the control of sci
ence and of the institutions in
which it is done," he said.
To combat the problems facing
university-based research, Ken
nedy emphasized the importance
of mobilizing the beneficiaries of
scientific research and region
alizing the political decisions af
fecting research.
"We need to produce a genera
tion of voters with at least
enough knowledge to avoid being
bamboozled by foolishness,"
Kennedy said. "In the long run
we will all pay the price for that

failure of education."
In the evening's discussion,
moderated by Rockefeller Foun
dation President and former
Stanford President Richard
Lyman, Bok said economic
growth depends more on social
elements within a society than on
innovation in a nation's univer
sities.
Comparing the United States
to Japan, Bok noted that Japan's
productivity has rapidly in
creased in recent years despite
comparatively weak academic
science programs and univer
sities.
Bok attributed Japan's success
to the society's high regard for
discipline, education, the work
ethic and respect for authority.
