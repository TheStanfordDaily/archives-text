# Endowment loss estimate doubles
## Fund down 13 percent 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Stanford's endowment suffered an estimated loss
of $200 million in Monday's stock market crash,
double the initial estimate. University officials said
yesterday.
The loss amounts to 12 or 13 percent of the total
endowment, according to William Massy, vice
president for business and finance.
But Massy downplayed the effect of the loss on
University operations, stressing that the 1987-88
budget remains unaffected.
"The payout for this year is set," Massy said.
"Next year, the effects will probably be fairly
moderate."
Massy credited the University's conservative
three-year "smooth-out" policy with helping the
budget weather the crash. The smooth-out policy
stipulates that income generated from the endow
ment be applied to the budget only in gradual incre
ments.
"We had not yet incorporated all the income
from the years of the bull market into the budget,"
he said.
But Massy acknowledged that the University's
investment policy will probably be "tine tuned" as
a result of the crash. "Perhaps another three to five
percent overseas, a little more in real estate and a
little less in large capital domestics," he said. Ac
cording to Massy, The large capitalization stocks
suffered the most on Monday.
Massy hinted that the University might take ad
vantage of the downswing. "Our managers have
not been selling," he said. "I'm also expecting the
market to move upward. We have cash â€” now may
be the time to use it.
"1 expect we'll be on the buy side, trying to
catch some of the bounce back." Massy said.
Massy said Monday that Stanford avoids risky
investment strategies such as margin buying

(buying on credit) and futures investments, whose
investors were hardest hit in the crash.
While loss figures for most other educational in
stitutions were unavailable late last night, the Har
vard Crimson told The Daily that Harvard Univer
sity's endowment decreased in value by about $307
million, or 7.675 percent of its $4 billion endow
ment.
Monday's stock market crash was the worst in
the financial market's history. The Dow Jones in
dustrial average lost nearly a quarter of its value,
nearly doubling the percentage drop on Oct. 28.

Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average
rose 102.27 points, a record one-day rise.
