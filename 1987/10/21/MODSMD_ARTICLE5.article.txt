In the aftermath of the record stock market
tumble Monday, the Stanford Financial Aids office
has not yet received any extra student requests for
additional aid, even though the crash affected the
finances of many students.
"In the last two days, we have received no calls
from (present aid) recipients, and only one call
from a person who has never applied for financial
aid," Associate Director of Financial Aids Roberta
Johnson said, adding that she could not confirm
that the caller's request was connected to the drop
in the market.
