# Financial Aids sees no crunch
## 
### Haru Connolly Staff writer 
In the aftermath of the record stock market
tumble Monday, the Stanford Financial Aids office
has not yet received any extra student requests for
additional aid, even though the crash affected the
finances of many students.
"In the last two days, we have received no calls
from (present aid) recipients, and only one call
from a person who has never applied for financial
aid," Associate Director of Financial Aids Roberta
Johnson said, adding that she could not confirm
that the caller's request was connected to the drop
in the market.
According to Johnson, the Financial Aids office
will be monitoring financial aid revision requests
and watching for requests citing losses due to the
stock market fall as a reason for additional aid.
"We will certainly respond (by implementing a
special program) if we see a significant number in
increased requests," she said.
Short-term loan requests have not increased.
Johnson said, adding that such requests are at
levels consistent over the past few years. "The
University will help bridge the gap if there are no
summer earnings or other shortfalls," she said. In
dividual students and student groups, meanwhile,
reported varying losses in the wake of the crash.
According to Johnson, stock "plays a relatively
minor role," given the general financial status of
the Stanford population receiving aid.
The Financial Aids office, in reviewing a stu
dent's request for additional aid, will judge the por
tion of assets invested in stocks and the magnitude
of those stocks most affected in Monday's drop,
Johnson said.
Junior Nancy Corbato said she "suffered a paper
loss" but decided not to sell. "I'll wait until the
market stabilizes when I'll decide what to do
next," she said.
"I'm not worried about paying my (tuition)

bills," Corbato added. "It's not a bad problem for
me."
Some student groups apparently weathered the
market's plunge. According to ASSU Financial
Manager Vivienne Huang, the ASSU did not lose
much in the market decline, although she said the
ASSU has not yet made a full assessment.
"We're not selling our investments, so I don't
see it as a loss," she said. "If it goes back up, we're
in good shape."
According to Huang, most of the ASSU invest
ments are in mutual funds with a "rather low
percentage" in stock.
"Even those mutual funds are invested in com
mercial paper (such as government securities)
which have a good rate of return," she said.
However, the market drop had adverse effects
on other groups. Senior Phil Black, director of the
Blythe Fund, said the Fund "made $12,(XX) in six
months (since April of this year) and lost $27,000 in
[this past] week."
The Blythe Fund was started in 1978 when an
anonymous donor contributed $75,000 to Stanford
for the specific purpose of giving students experi
ence in managing investments, Black explained.
