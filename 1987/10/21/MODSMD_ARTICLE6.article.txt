### Joe Metcalfe 
Law School Dean Paul Brest admitted yes
terday that the school's non-discrimination
policy lacks adequate enforcement proce
dures, but nevertheless defended the contro
versial decision that allowed a law firm
accused of racial bias in hiring to hold a
forum defending its actions.
In an open letter to Law School students,
faculty and staff, Brest reaffirmed the
School's and his own personal commitment
to "designing effective and fair procedures
for enforcing the Policy on Non-
Discrimination."
The Los Angeles law firm of Allen, Mat
kins, Leek, Gamble & Mallory has been un
der fire since the publication of an article by
law student Victor Minjares in this month's
edition of the Stanford Law Journal. In the
article, Minjares accused the firm of denying
him a position because of his race.
Brest also acknowledged the criticism that
the school failed to adequately respond to
charges that discriminatory remarks were
made during on-campus interviews last year.
Although the Law School's primary obliga
tion is to the student, Brest said that "we also
have an obligation of fair dealing toward
outside individuals and firms.
"I continue to believe that Allen, Matkins
should have been afforded an opportunity to
respond, publicly and orally, to the allega

tions of discrimination against it,"he said.
Shelley Wessels. Co-chair of the Gay and
Lesbian Law Students' Association and a
member of the Multicultural Council, a coali
tion of ethnic minority, women's, lesbian and
gay groups, commended Brest on his willing
ness to make a statement conceding mistakes
were made.
"This is one step on the way to resolving
the problem," Wessels said.
Brest also argued that allowing the Central

Intelligence Agency to speak — hut not
recruit — on campus at the request of the
Federalist Society was consistent with the
School's Policy on Non-Discrimination "in
light of the values of academic freedom that
are so central to the University's mission."
The Law School has barred the CIA and
the Department of Defense from recruiting on
campus because of their discriminatory
policies based on sexual orientation.
Claiming that the present controversy only
alludes to a deeper problem. Brest said that
some minority, women, gay and lesbian law
students "feel alienated from and distrustful
of the School.
"An obvious place to begin (addressing
this problem of alienation) is with the particu
lar issue of employer discrimination," he
said.
The Law School's Placement Committee is
presently considering procedures to
strengthen the enforcement of the non
discrimination policy. The committee hopes
to submit a tentative draft before the end of
the semester.
lX>n Gagliardi, ASSU graduate senator and
author of a recent senate resolution calling
for more stringent enforcement of the Law
School's non-discrimination policy, was
cautiously optimistic about Brest's state
ment. "We must wait and see what hap
pens," Gagliardi said.
