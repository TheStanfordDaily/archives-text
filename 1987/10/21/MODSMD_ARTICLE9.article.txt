Iranian says U.S. will regret strike
The powerful speaker of Iran's Parliament, Hashemi Rafsan
jani, warned the United States yesterday it would "regret" its
Monday strike against an off-shore oil platform, but Kuwait
issued a strong statement of support for the U.S. action.
Marking the first official support from an Arab nation, a gov
ernment statement distributed by the Kuwaiti news agency
called the American action "a measured response" to Iran's
recent attacks on U.S.-registered tankers in Kuwaiti territorial
waters. In other Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, newspa
per editorials and other measures of local opinion were positive
toward the U.S. action, but the governments remained silent.
Rafsanjani, speaking to the Iranian Majlis, or Parliament,
said, "We will act according to our responsibilities in the com
ing days and will make the United States regret its action," the
Iranian news agency IRNA reported from Tehran, the capital.
In Damascus, Syria, Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi
also threatened retaliation.
"We had told America that we will respond to any aggression
against us," Musavi said at a press conference after meeting
with his Syrian counterpart.
Budget: Reagan, Congress to meet
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, reacting to the stock
market's historic plunge, bowed to long-standing requests yes
terday and said that he or his aides would meet with members of
Congress from both parties to tackle the nation's budget deficit
and other economic problems.
But the president continued to defend his own deficit-cutting
program, which relies on spending cuts and avoids any new
taxes, and blasted legislation sponsored by congressional Dem
ocrats that would raise $12 billion in new revenues this year.
Reagan made his offer to meet with members of Congress — a
proposal he had spurned several times earlier this year— after
discussing the nation's economic picture with Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, Secretary of the Treasury
James Baker III and White House chief of staff Howard Baker
Jr.
But in an indication that bipartisan compromise remains a dis
tant goal, James Miller 111, Reagan's budget director, bickered
earlier in the day with House Budget Committee members over
how to trim this year's budget deficit by $23 billion and head off
an automatic, across-the-board spending reduction that neither
side wants.
The president, who signed an order yesterday giving prelimi
nary approval to the automatic budget cuts, told reporters on
the White House lawn: "It is preferable, if possible, that the ex
ecutive and legislative branches reach agreement on a budget
deficit reduction package."
Bork dismayed at tone of debate
WASHINGTON — On the eve of Senate consideration of his
Supreme Court nomination, Robert Bork has told friends that he
is dismayed that acrimonious charges may drown out the
"lowered voices" he has urged for the debate.
Senators who support him and those who oppose him
previewed arguments yesterday that they intend to press'in the
debate, and their tone suggested that this "is going to be an ugly
spectacle," one senior Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee
aide said yesterday. "This thing is out of control," a top Repub
lican strategist said.
Both sides predicted that the debate, expected to start this
week, may spill into next week before a vote is held.
With Bork's defeat virtually sealed with the declared commit
ments of 54 senators to vote against him, angry supporters ex
pressed their resolve yesterday to bitterly denounce the opposi
tion campaign that helped brand the nominee as a conservative
extremist. They also remain intent on criticizing the Reagan ad
ministration's way of promoting him.
At the same time, Bork opponents indicated in interviews and
speeches their eagerness to fight back during the debate with
charges of partisan political maneuvering.
When he announced 12 days ago that he would not withdraw
his nomination, Bork, while decrying the sophisticated cam
paign tactics employed against him, said he hoped that the full
Senate debate could be a dignified process that would concen
trate on constitutional issues.
Senate looks to enact War Powers
WASHINGTON — The Democratic-controlled Senate,
reacting to the latest skirmish between U.S. and Iranian forces,
voted yesterday to break a lengthy GOP filibuster that has kept
Congress from putting any restrictions on President Reagan's
policy in the Persian Gulf.
The lopsided 67-28 vote opened the way for the Senate to act
by noog today on a watered-down version of the controversial
1973 War Powers Resolution, which asserts the right of
Congress to approve or disapprove of U.S. involvement in
armed conflict around the globe.
Seventeen Republicans voted with the Democratic majority,
even though the president strongly opposes any effort by
Congress to tie his hands in the gulf. Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd ( D-W.Va.) said many senators were swayed by the
United States' retaliatory attack on an Iranian oil platform in the
gulf on Monday.
Sen. Lowell Weicker Jr. (R-Conn.) who has been pressing the
Senate for more than a month to invoke the War Powers Resolu
tion in the Persian Gulf, said the vote demonstrates a growing
inclination by Congress to assert its will. "Sixty-seven votes
clearly shows that the U.S. Senate wants to have fthe 1 War
Powers [Resolution! in spirit or in letter," he said.
In three previous votes beginning on Oct. 9, a majority in the
Senate has registered its desire to enact some type of legislation
asserting congressional authority over U.S. policy in the gulf.
But there has never been a majority in favor of invoking the War
Powers Resolution, which Reagan contends is unconstitutional.
U.N. Assembly discusses AIDS
UNITED NATIONS — In an unprecedented session, the
U.N. General Assembly debated the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) yesterday and heard Secretary-
General Javier Perez de Cuellar call the epidemic a "global con
flict" that "threatens us with all the consequences of war."
Top World Health Organization (WHO) officials said the dis
cussion, apparently the first devoted exclusively to a health
issue in the assembly's history, heralded an "explosion" of
openness and international cooperation in the fight against the
deadly disease.
"That we are gathered here to discuss AIDS is itself a historic
moment," said Dr. Jonathan Mann, the director of the WHO's
Special Program on AIDS. "We are assuming our collective and
historical responsibility to take action now against a worldwide
epidemic whose ultimate scope and dimensions we cannot yet
predict."
