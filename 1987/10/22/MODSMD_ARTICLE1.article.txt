### Russell korobkin Editorial staff 
The Western Culture Task
Force's recommendations to al
ter the Area One requirement
met with general approval among
members of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, who dis
cussed the proposal yesterday.
CUS Chair Craig Heller said
that members viewed the pro
posal as a "very positive and im
portant step forward,'' though
"not necessarily the finished
product." He added that no one
spoke negatively about the pro
posal.
Committee member Ralph
Cohen, professor of mathemat
ics, was hesistant to judge the
committee's mood, but said he
thought the general view was
"that this is a good proposal," al
though changes will probably be
proposed. Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. William Kays, also a
CUS member, agreed.
The opinion of CUS members
is important because that com
mittee must approve the task
force's recommendations before
they can be considered by the
Faculty Senate. Senate approval
is necessary for the task force
proposals to be implemented.
Heller said he hopes the pro
posal, possibly with minor modi
fications, will be approved by
CUS and brought before the sen
ate this quarter. "You can talk an
issue to death and not get
anywhere," he said.
CUS will wait to discuss spe
cific changes and vote on the pro-
posal until after a public forum,
scheduled for next Wednesday
evening in which any interested
students, faculty and community
members will be able to air their
views.
The task force's proposal,
released two weeks ago, calls for
courses designed to fulfill the
Area One Western Culture re
quirement to incorporate at least
one non-European culture into

the curriculum and to include the
study of works by women and
minorities. It also seeks to
abolish the requirement's core
list of readings.
According to Heller, despite
general approval, a number of
specific concerns with the task
force report were brought up at
the meeting.
He said he thought at least one
concern would likely lead to
rewording of the document: the
provision for the establishment
of an oversight committee to
administer the new Area One
program.
