# Senate seeks say in Gulf policy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Sen
ate, clearly divided over how to
respond to President Reagan's
Persian Gulf policy, yesterday
approved a watered-down ver
sion of the 1973 War Powers Res
olution that asserts the right of
Congress to have a voice in U.S.
military involvement in the
region.
The measure, adopted by a
vote of 54-44, still faces an uncer
tain future in the House and a
probable veto by Reagan. Never
theless, senators on both sides of
the aisle expressed relief over the
vote because it ended an agoniz
ing four-month debate that began
last July when Reagan started
providing naval escorts to U.S.-
flagged Kuwaiti oil tankers.
Unlike the original War
Powers Resolution, which — if it
had been invoked — would pull

U.S. troops out of the gulf after
90 days without the explicit con
sent of Congress, the Senate
measure approved yesterday
provides only for another con
gressional vote on the issue after
90 days. It also requires a com
prehensive report from Reagan
on the policy within 30 days.
The vote reflected neither an
expression of support nor disap
proval of Reagan's policy. Al
though the Democratic
controlled Congress was initially
critical of the reflagging opera
tion, which gave 11 Kuwaiti
tankers U.S. protection, an ap
parent majority now supports
continuation of that policy, at
least temporarily.
As Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole (R-Kan.) noted in op
posing it, the measure simply
reserves the right of Congress to

challenge the policy in the future.
"We want to be in a position to
blame the president of the United
States if something goes wrong,"
he said.
Despite a 10-vote margin of
victory, few senators seemed
genuinely pleased with the
outcome. In fact, the measure
was so unpopular that it failed in
itially by a vote of 51-47 and was
approved later only after some
arm-twisting by Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (R-W.Va.)
persuaded five members of his
party to switch.
Conservatives and liberals
combined to oppose the Senate
measure. Liberals, who favored
invoking the War Powers Resolu
tion, called the new measure too
weak; conservatives insisted that
it goes too far in restricting the
president's prerogatives to

respond to an international crisis.
But Byrd, who co-authored the
measure with Sen. John Warner
(R-Va.), said that it "provides a
sure way for the elected repre
sentatives of the people to have a
role in policy." He said it proves
that Congress was not entirely
impotent in the situation.
"The bottom line is that the
Senate acted today," Byrd
added.
Warner defended it as the
strongest measure the Senate
could devise with its members
deeply divided on the issue.
"This is the best resolution of
this conflict that could be arrived
at over these many, manv
months of debate," he said.
"Somewhere we had to reach a
consensus."
