# Scholars clash on war powers

### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
The 1973 War Powers Resolution is
unconstitutional because it limits the
president's constitutionally delegated
power to wage war and his "unilateral
authority to protect Americans where
their safety [is] at stake," according to
Bruce Fein, visiting fellow for Consti
tutional Studies at the Washington,
D.C.-based Heritage Foundation.
Assoc. History Prof. Jack Rakove,
debating Fein on the constitutionality
of the resolution last night in Branner
Hall, disagreed, saying that "the text
(of the Constitution) and history alike
suggest that Congress was meant to
play an equal role with the president on
whether the nation is to go to war."
The War Powers Resolution auto
matically removes American military
forces deployed in "hostilities or into
situations where imminent involve
ment in hostilities is clearly indicated"
after 90 days unless Congress declares
war or extends the deadline.
Last night's debate followed yester
day's 54-44 U.S. Senate approval of a
measure allowing Congress to vote on
the commitment of troops after the 90-
day War Powers Resolution deadline
— an effort to maintain congressional
influence in the Persian Gulf.

'Congress is made up of
persons who cannot think
beyond the next election. It
is not capable for long-term
policy endeavors.'
-Bruce Fein

The measure, co-sponsored by Sen
ate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (R-
W.Va.) and Sen. John Warner (R-Va.),
needs to be approved by President
Reagan, which seems unlikely, and the
House of Representatives before it
becomes law.
Although Fein and Rakove disagreed
as to whether the War Powers Resolu
tion is constitutional, they agreed that
it is a poor piece of legislation.
"Congress has proven effectively
impotent when giving meaning to this
document," said Rakove, who spe
cializes in constitutional issues. "It's
basically a dead letter."
Citing U.S. involvement in the Per
sian Gulf and Lebanon as situations
where Congress could have invoked
the resolution — but did not — Rakove
said its only possible effect might be to

deter the president from committing
troops abroad.
Fein faulted the legislation because it
allots foreign policymaking considera
tions to Congress, which he described
as "a whimsical body" that has "no
staying power.
"Congress is made up of persons
who cannot think beyond the next elec
tion. It is not capable of long-term
policy endeavors," said Fein, who
served as associate deputy attorney
general in the Reagan administration
and as legal counsel to the Federal
Communications Commission.
"The problem with the War Powers
Act is that it prevents any sustained
military force and is contrary to the
spirit of the Constitution that the power
to wage war rests with the president,"
he said.
Rakove said the current debate over
the constitutionality of the resolution
really symbolizes a greater problem of
"how to provide Americans with a
well-defined foreign policy."
Rakove added that legislation such
as the War Powers Resolution provides
a rule about foreign policy, which is
"contingent on very specific sets of cir
cumstances."
Fein, who is from Palo Alto,
received his law degree from Harvard
University.
