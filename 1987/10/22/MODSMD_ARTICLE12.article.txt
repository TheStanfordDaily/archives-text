# Feminist urges activism

Asking for "a new, radical
look" at the world, a well-known
feminist said in a speech here
yesterday that women must
"take back everything" through
a new approach to international
politics.
Cynthia Enloe, chair of the
government department and a
professor of Women's Studies at
Clark University in Worcester,
Mass., told a predominately
female audience of about 75 at
the Law School that "there is
nothing in the world that is irrele
vant for feminists to ask, even if
we can't figure out how to ask it
or how to take action on it."
Enloe. author of "Does Khaki
Become You? The Militarization
of Women's Lives," emphasized
the need for an "international
feminist understanding and activ
ism.
"We are at a point that irTorder
to have international feminist
solidarity, we must come" to an
understanding of what the inter

national [situation) is," she said.
Enloe said the problem of
present-day international politics
is rooted in the "masculine the
ory" that has been reiterated by
both men and women in politics.
"Most of our theories of
politics are theories we take as
given, like furniture of the room.
But these theories don't work
anymore," she said.
Enloe said current feminist or
ganizations are "altruistic" be
cause they try to sympathize
with Third World women. "We
try to imagine what it is like,"
she said.
But she emphasized that
women need to do more than just
sympathize. "It's important to
do, but I'm not so sure it's
enough anymore," she said.
After asking. "What would
jinternational feminism] look like
if we change everything?" Enloe
said Third World women have
answered this question by estab
lishing a network among women
and making international
feminism "an integral part of
everything they do.
"Whatever they do, they al

ways put it in an international
setting in international terms,"
she said.
The next step, according to
Enloe, is for women of the
United States to become
"linked" to the "whole multina
tional political world." She sug
gested that this could he done by
subscribing to feminist publica
tions from around the world.
"It is impossible for any of us
to do it alone," she said. "Some
male theorists think that we can
do it alone, but that's because
there are no voices in their
theories," Enloe said.
"Masculine theorists see it as
clutter to put people in their
theories. Feminists know that if
there are no real people, then
how can the theory be real?" she
added.
According to Enloe, a unifica
tion between international
politics and gender issues needs
to take place before many of the
world's problems can be solved.
"The politics of marriage and the
politics of the international eco
nomy need to be talked about in
the same breath," she said.

Enloe ended her lecture saying
that with an international net
work of women "we can end up
with a really interesting basis for
feminist solidarity."
rhe lecture was part of this
year's Jing I.yman lecture series
focusing on international
feminism. It was sponsored by
the Institute for Research on
Women and Ciender, the Eco
nomics Department and the Uni
versity Lecture Fund.
