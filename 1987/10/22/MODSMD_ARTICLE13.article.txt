Last week the University Board of Trustees
allocated funds to allow the ever-expanding
Stanford campus to grow in a new direction —
Washington, D.C. This money will be used for
the purchase of a building to house a study cen
ter minutes from the Capitol, and thus will effec
tively introduce Stanford students, the first
group of whom are set to arrive in March 1988,
to lifestyles and professions in the public sector.
The University has acted with much foresight
and sensibility in establishing a home base in
Washington. The summer offerings sponsored
by Stanford-in-Government have been a first ini
tiative into developing the University's presence
in the capital. Their success in attracting forums
and presentations by civic officials suggests the
potential that exists for a permanent year-round
program.
The newly planned schedule of local intern
ships, weekly seminars and private tutorials
promises to be a well-organized effort to inte
grate participants into the full stream of activity
in the city.
The "overseas" experience has become a sig
nificant part of the Stanford career, creating op
portunities in Europe, the Middle East, South
America, Africa and, soon, Asia for majors of all
disciplines. But what had been lacking was a

program that would address the domestic situa
tion — economic and public policy, legal affairs
and the life of the national arts.
A Stanford education often entails training in
these vital areas, and the University administra
tion encourages students to contribute to com
munity life. Yet for many involvement in public
life ends in the classroom or on campus. Intellec
tually, the new program should encourage more
Stanford graduates to consider careers in public
service.
Political Science Prof. David Danelski, who
has been named the center's first director, seems
committed to making these opportunities possi
ble. He also is rightly concerned with creating an
environment that will attract a wide diversity of
participants — doctors and journalists, as well as
what might surely be a core group of students of
economy, diplomacy and public policy.
Stanford has moved to many countries and
continents, but there is something fitting in
locating a campus on domestic turf. Washington,
D.C., is one of the most interesting and vital
areas in the world, and the University should be
commended for funding a program that will
make the vast resources of the nation's capital
more accessible to its students.
