# Just say 'no' to television evangelism
## 
### 
Television is considered something of a
vice in many circles, not the least of which is
the academic circle.
Indeed, despite the debatable degree to
which Stanford undergraduates can be con
sidered "intellectuals," I have found the bulk
of my peers at Stanford averse to regular
viewing; they spend their leisure hours in
more worthy and mentally stimulating activi
ties, such as drinking games, dorm corridor
football and frosh book scanning. While I
agree, in large part, with respect to the mind
numbing effect of television (for reasons
which should soon be clear), I nonetheless
must confess to being a religious viewer of at
least one network series: the meta-television
masterpiece. Max Headroom.

Max, in his particular irreverent manner,
addresses the issues and concerns that the
television medium presents. In a recent
episode, TV viewers were glued to their
screens, seemingly mesmerized by a mind
less game show called "Whacketts." People
were willing to risk life and limb to rescue TV
sets from the rubble of a destroyed building
(while ignoring injured children!) to watch the
show. Virtually every set was tuned to the
obscure network airing "Whacketts." As it
turned out, "Whacketts" contained some
sort of subliminally imposed video narcotic
that caused addiction. The show's main
protagonists, Edison Carter and the Network
23 team, devised an antidote and thus foiled a
fiendish plot to capture a world ratings
landslide.
In the "20 minutes into the future" milieu
of Max Headroom, technology creates situa
tions that could not exist today, but are only
slight parodies of present day events. We
have all heard the disturbing tales of school
children whose grades plummet and
employees who lose jobs because they were
glued to the tube, indiscriminately watching
whatever came on next. But perhaps more
alarming than the "religious viewer" is the

rapid proliferation of religious programming
â€” specifically tele-evangelism.
Tele-evangelism brings us closer to the
world of Max Headroom and "Whacketts."
In both cases viewers are not only glued to
their screens but also seem compelled to in
flict harm on themselves: phycial harm in one
case, financial harm (which can rapidly
translate into physical harm for the many im
poverished viewers who are all too often
most susceptible) in the other.
Doubtless there are those who find this
characterization of tele-evangelism overly
cynical. I believe the recent Jim and Tammy
Bakker scandal provides some justification
for cynicism. The Bakker scandal is also in
teresting in the events of its aftermath.
Recent developments present the distinct
likelihood that Jim and Tammy may in fact
regain control of the PTL. Thousands of the
faithful have voiced their support for the Bak
kers.
Marxists assert that religion is the opiate of
the masses, and Max Headrooms writers
have paraphrased that often-used quote for a
meta-television context: "Television is the
opiate of the masses." Without subscribing
to Marxist rhetoric or traveling "20 minutes
into the future" one can see that the tele
evangelistic hybrid has produced a powerful
narcotic addiction.
Even after witnessing irrefutable proof of
betrayal, tele-evangelism junkies are willing
to return to the Bakkers for the same cheap
(my mistake, expensive) high. Others, un
doubtedly have switched channels and found
new sources of tele-evangelism from which to
get their fix. It seems one bad trip doesn't
deter an addict.
In the Max Headroom episode, the dangers
that "Whacketts" immediately presented
were its harmful effects on addicted viewers
and a ratings distortion. On the surface it
would seem that the unaddicted population
would suffer no ill-effects. But those familiar
with the world of Max Headroom are aware
of an additional and more far-reaching dan
ger. Political elections are conducted over
television airwaves, with rating points sub
stituting for cast ballots. An audience mes
merized by "Whacketts" would not only
cause a ratings landslide but a political
landslide at election time. The tele
democratic process would be subverted.
Again, Max Headroom only exaggerates
current realities. The effect of television
coverage on elections today is undeniable.

The political affiliations of tele-evangelists
have generally been no secret, and in the up
coming election at least one tele-evangelist is
actually running for president. The line be
tween religious dogma and political ideology
thus becomes blurred. The hypothetical
threat of political subversion in the world of
Max Headroom becomes a very real threat in
the here and now.
But what constitutes the narcotic element
in tele-evangelism? What powerful opiate can
compel thousands, perhaps millions, to sup
port individual's luxurious lifestyles with out
right financial gifts, and political establish
ments with marked ballots? Marxists miss the
larger picture when they cite religion; it is not
religion itself but religious dogma, carefully
manipulated to become political ideology.
When the line between religious dogma and
political ideology blurs political affiliation
becomes a crusade partisan doctrine
becomes imbued with the infallibility of the
divine.
Marxists claim religion subdues by telling
the masses to endure injustice on earth in or
der to serve a higher justice in the afterlife.
Tele-evangelism carries this a step further,
asserting that justice on earth and in the after
world are served as long as the "forces of
God" on earth (the tele-evangelist and/or a
specific political position or candidate) pros
per. If this best of all possible worlds exists,
anyone still suffering has only himself to
blame.
The poor and downtrodden suffer because
of impurity of spirit. (Perhaps they haven't
given freely enough to the "forces of God"
on earth.) If this new "religious" doctrine
sounds suspiciously like social Darwinism, it
is not by accident. Now, registered voters
who have no understanding of a socio
political ideology have adopted its tenents
under the guise of religion. Failure to con
form to ideological norms becomes not a
change of opinion, but a falling from grace,
blasphemy, paradise lost.
As a significant segment of the American
body politic goes on a tele-evangelistic Soma
holiday, the fate of a responsive democratic
system hangs in the balance. One can only
hope that "bad trips" like the PTL scandal
will break the addiction long enough for
Americans to switch channels, turn off their
sets or wake up, rise up and "just say no."
