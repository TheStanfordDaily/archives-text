## Crash was entirely predictable 
### 
As the stock market plunges,
and Stanford students nervously
reassess their futures, two ques
tions are on everyone's mind:
How low will the Dow go, and
what does it all mean?

Eden Quainton

The answer to the first ques
tion — if you can trust a graduate
student studying obscure Rus
sian poetry who sunk $300 on
Kansas to win the NCAA basket
ball tournament, but who also, in
a fit of drunken inspiration,
predicted on Sunday that the
stock market would crash on
Monday — is easy: 1250.
Why? On the front page of The
New York Times (Oct. 20) was a
graph representing the five-year
bull market on Wall Street. If you
look carefully at the graph, you
will notice that during the first
three years of the bull market

stock values rose steadily,
roughly in line with the modest
but continuous improvement in
the U.S. economy. Then, sud
denly, in late 1985, with the Dow
at about 1250 the graph begins to
shoot upward, and in less than
two years the Dow has more than
doubled its value.
Th is spectacular rise cor
responds to no new economic im
provement and, in fact, dovetails
perfectly with the appearance
and growth of crucial negative
realities in the U.S. economy.
First, in late 1985 after a
meeting of the Big Five in Tokyo,
the dollar began to drop, almost
immediately entering a tailspin
that no one had foreseen.
Second, also in late 1985, the
U.S. recorded its first huge trade
deficits and went, almost over
night, from being the world's
largest creditor nation to becom
ing the world's largest debtor na
tion.
Still, some might ask, uhy did
the bubble burst now? The ques

tion is, of course, unanswerable.
Fears of war in the Persian Gulf,
Ronald Reagan's loss of control
of American politics, Nancy
Reagan's surgery — all of these
are possible explanations, but

The stock market had
to crash, and . . .
having begun to fall it
will continue to drop
until the gains of the
last two years are com
pletely wiped out.

none is definite. What is definite
is that the stock market had to
crash, and that having begun to
fall it will continue to drop until
the gains of the last two years are
completely wiped out.
Smoking will become hip again
as panic grips Wall Street, so in

vest in Phillip Morris. And, more
seriously, Reaganomics is finally
dead — dead as Marley, dead as
a doornail.
It is time to act. The budget
deficit must be reduced — with
any luck by a modest increase in
taxes and a sharp decrease in mil
itary spending — so that we can
at last reduce our reliance on
foreign capital. The U.S. govern
ment must begin investing in pro
ductive industries at home, per
haps through tax credits for re
search and development in cer
tain key sectors of the economy,
or better yet through a compre
hensive industrial policy in which
the U.S. would invest directly in
productive industries instead of
blowing its birthright on expen
sive military toys that don't work
anyway. It is a pity we will have
had to lose almost $1.5 trillion
before we finally get our act to
gether.
