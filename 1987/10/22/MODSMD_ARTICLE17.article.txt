Disappointed
and not flattered
As graduate students, we were
less than flattered and frankly
disappointed at Preston Ham
mer's depiction of the graduate
student in the Farm Side of Oct.
19. Not only did it serve to rein
force an inaccurate and ignorant
stereotype, but the cartoon was
also indicative of an all-too
prevalent attitude among Stan
ford undergraduates to regard
half of the University's student
body as a bizarre breed of human
beings.
The cartoon showed a pair of
bikers, one laden with books and
bicycle safety devices, eyes fixed
straight ahead, with the caption
reading "Circle the Graduate
Student." The obvious sugges
tion is that the graduate student
is lacking in all social graces,
completely immersed in the
world of his books and unaware
of what is going on around him.
On the contrary, graduate stu
dents contribute to the Stanford
community in many ways, most
visibly as teaching assistants and
graders, but also in typical stu
dent activities, such as intra
mural sports, music and theater
organizations, departmental stu
dent associations and countless
others. Moreover, having gone
through the undergraduate ex
perience ourselves, we can attest
that our interests and concerns
are in many ways quite similar.
Essentially, we too are students.
It is rather ironic that Hammer
chose to portray the graduate
student as oblivious to his sur
roundings. Perhaps Hammer,

and those who share his view
should take more note of their
own.

Gavilan residents
at the car wash
As the public service represen
tative of Gavilan House, I would
like to express the disappoint
ment of the residents of Gavilan
concerning the picture that ap
peared on the back page of The
Daily (Oct. 19).
The picture, which accompa
nied an article about Saturday's
Reach Out Today program,
depicted Gavilan residents Lisa
Reckler and Mindy Demsky was
hing cars. However, the caption
read, "Cardenal residents wash
cars to benefit the YWCA as part
of Reach Out Today Saturday."
While it is true that some Car
denal residents did help out at the
car wash, which benefited the
YWCA Rape Crisis Center, the
project was organized and ex
ecuted by Gavilan. We do not
want to belittle the contribution
made by the Cardenal residents,
but we do feel that credit should
be given where credit is due. The
car wash was conceived by
Gavilan, organized by Gavilan
and executed by Gavilan. The
photograph in The Daily showed
Gavilan residents washing cars.
It would be nice if Gavilan were
mentioned as having something
to do with the project.
