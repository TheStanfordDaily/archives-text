# Scientists vs. activists
## Forum explores lab animal safeguards 
### Burke Smith Staff writer 
Members of the local animal rights
community and Stanford researchers
clashed last night in a wide-ranging
public forum on the use of animals in re
search here.
The forum, hosted by the Stanford
Panel on Laboratory Animal Care, was
designed as an effort to facilitate public
input on the issue, according to Robert
Street, dean of research. Normally,
meetings of the panel are closed to the
public.
Animal rights activists addressed
many specific issues in the debate over
animal care at Stanford, but all focused
on alleged inadequacies of the present
system for governing the use of live
subjects in research.
Faculty members responded by
saying that present restrictions on re
search are adequate protection for the
rights of animals. They also emphasized

a willingness to work within these
guidelines.
Lise Giraud, Stanford librarian and
long-time member of the Palo Alto
Humane Society, asked the panel, and
the Stanford community as a whole, to
"stop pretending that laboratory
animals are adequately protected under
[the] law."
Speaking as a concerned member of
the community, veterinarian Elliott
Katz said he used to think "universities
could regulate themselves and were
bastions of integrity."
Citing recent cases of alleged neglect,
Katz remarked that the university can
no longer be given the luxury of self
regulation.
Echoing the sentiments of many
speakers, Jane Hutchinson, director of
communications for the Humane Soci
ety of Santa Clara Valley, urged the
panel to open its proceedings to public

attendance on a regular basis.
"Stanford should welcome the
opportunity to justify its re
search," she said.
Another predominant concern
of humane society members was
the perceived bias of the panel.
Virginia Handley. a member of
the state Fish and Game Depart
ment's Advisory Committee,
said the make-up of the commit
tee "confirms" her doubts.
Five of the 12 panel members
are faculty members who use
animals in their research, three
are faculty and staff members
who do not use animals, three
more are community members
and the 12th is a student ap
pointed by the ASSU.
Members of the local animal
rights community have long been
pressing Stanford to allow them
to appoint at least one panel
member.
Instances of alleged cruelty
were also brought up in the dis
cussion. Nancy Bernardi, a
humane society member, said
University employees had dis

couraged the Hollister Humane
Society from finding homes for
strays because they wanted to
pick up a specified number for
life-ending research.
Research practices called into
question included the shocking of
monkeys to observe stress,
shocking the eyelids of rabbits,
injecting mice with nico
tineamide to determine at what
level 50 percent would die and
separating offspring from mot
hers.
Researchers and University of
ficals were present to counter the
claims of humane society mem
bers. Larry Horton, associate
vice president for Public Affairs,
said the "use of animals in re
search is one of the most highly
regulated areas of science.
Countless prominent Stanford
researchers spoke to the panel on
the importance of animals in
making scientific gains.
Dr. David Stevenson, profes
sor of pediatric medicine at the
Medical School, echoed the com
ments of many colleagues in
saying, "I strongly believe that
animal research should ibe] and
is carefully controlled." He went
on to say "research should not
be impeded or prevented."
