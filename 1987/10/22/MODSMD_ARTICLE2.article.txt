# Scientists vs. activists
## Forum explores lab animal safeguards 
### Burke Smith Staff writer 
Members of the local animal rights
community and Stanford researchers
clashed last night in a wide-ranging
public forum on the use of animals in re
search here.
The forum, hosted by the Stanford
Panel on Laboratory Animal Care, was
designed as an effort to facilitate public
input on the issue, according to Robert
Street, dean of research. Normally,
meetings of the panel are closed to the
public.
Animal rights activists addressed
many specific issues in the debate over
animal care at Stanford, but all focused
on alleged inadequacies of the present
system for governing the use of live
subjects in research.
Faculty members responded by
saying that present restrictions on re
search are adequate protection for the
rights of animals. They also emphasized

a willingness to work within these
guidelines.
Lise Giraud, Stanford librarian and
long-time member of the Palo Alto
Humane Society, asked the panel, and
the Stanford community as a whole, to
"stop pretending that laboratory
animals are adequately protected under
[the] law."
Speaking as a concerned member of
the community, veterinarian Elliott
Katz said he used to think "universities
could regulate themselves and were
bastions of integrity."
Citing recent cases of alleged neglect,
Katz remarked that the university can
no longer be given the luxury of self
regulation.
Echoing the sentiments of many
speakers, Jane Hutchinson, director of
communications for the Humane Soci
ety of Santa Clara Valley, urged the
panel to open its proceedings to public
