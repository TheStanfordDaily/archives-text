## NATO youth exchange Student joins exchange 
### Ted Lieu Staff writer 
Traveling in Europe and
meeting high-ranking officials of
the most powerful alliance in the
world may be a dream to some,
but for Stanford graduate Mi
chael Bunzel it was reality.
Bunzel, a 1987 graduate, was
selected as one of six Americans
to participate in the Atlantic
Council's first-ever North Atlan
tic Treaty Organization (NATO)
youth exchange program last
September.
Bunzel, a Phi Beta Kappa
graduate in political science,
represented the western section
of the United States in the 21-
student delegation.
According to Bunzel, "The

delegation ranged in age from IS
to 25, with representatives from
every NATO country."
The goal of the month-long
program was to explore the pos
siblity of resolving arms-control
agreements between Warsaw
Pact countries and members of
the NATO alliance. The group
studied the possible effects of
such agreements on inter-alliance
relations.
After spending three weeks in
the United States, the students
traveled to Europe, where they
visited East and West Berlin and
the NATO headquarters in Brus
sels. "We had a highly sensitive
tour of the USS Vincent, the larg
est U.S. aircraft carrier, and the
opportunity to meet with high
ranking military and political offi

cials of NATO (while in
Europe)," Bunzel said.
Bunzel said the experience in
Berlin, however, had the greatest
impact on him. "The city of Ber
lin graphically illustrated, in two
days, all the issues we discussed
for the preceeding three weeks"
during the trip, he said.
"Landing at Templehof Air
Base in Berlin, Hitler's personal
airport, was especially troubling
for me," Bunzel added. "The
specter of the Holocaust seemed
to come up in every discussion.
The NATO alliance should see to
it that such a catastrophe never
happens again."
On a more positive note, Bun
zel said. "The camaraderie of the

group was tremendous. I was
really impressed by the way the
group got along as one country,
even though there were at least
15 different nationalities rep
resented."
An experience in San Fran
cisco's Chinatown was particu
larly moving, according to Bun
zel. "We were sitting at the
table, and everyone went around
and said their greeting in their
native tongue. Hearing all the dif
ferent languages and the cultures
they represent and knowing that
they were all striving for a com
mon cause really inspired me,"
Bunzel said.
The most surprising aspect of
the program, according to Bun
zel, was that he never filled out
an application. A professor at
Stanford recommended him for
the program without his knowl
edge.

Bunzel is now working in
Sacramento as an assistant to
State Assemblyman John Vas
concellos (D-San Jose).
He said he believes his experi
ence as an undergraduate teach
ing assistant in political science
and his friendships with Stanford
professors were the main reasons
for his acceptance into the pro
gram.
"Students at Stanford are
lucky that professors are so ac
cessible, and they should take
the initiative to develop close re
lations with faculty," he said.
The Atlantic Council chose
Bunzel — Stanford's nominee —
from a pool of students that
represented every school in the
western region of the United
States.
Based in Washington, D.C.,
the Atlantic Council is a 27-year
old bipartisan group that focuses
its efforts on research work,
policy recommendations and ex
changes in order to strengthen
America's ties with European
and Pacific democracies.

Bunzel said the experience in
Berlin, however, had the greatest
impact on him. "The city of Ber
lin graphically illustrated, in two
days, all the issues we discussed
for the preceeding three weeks"
during the trip, he said.
"Landing at Templehof Air
Base in Berlin, Hitler's personal
airport, was especially troubling
for me," Bunzel added. "The
specter of the Holocaust seemed
to come up in every discussion.
The NATO alliance should see to
it that such a catastrophe never
happens again."
On a more positive note, Bun
zel said. "The camaraderie of the

group was tremendous. I was
really impressed by the way the
group got along as one country,
even though there were at least
15 different nationalities rep
resented."
An experience in San Fran
cisco's Chinatown was particu
larly moving, according to Bun
zel. "We were sitting at the
table, and everyone went around
and said their greeting in their
native tongue. Hearing all the dif
ferent languages and the cultures
they represent and knowing that
they were all striving for a com
mon cause really inspired me,"
Bunzel said.
The most surprising aspect of
the program, according to Bun
zel, was that he never filled out
an application. A professor at
Stanford recommended him for
the program without his knowl
edge.

Bunzel is now working in
Sacramento as an assistant to
State Assemblyman John Vas
concellos (D-San Jose).
He said he believes his experi
ence as an undergraduate teach
ing assistant in political science
and his friendships with Stanford
professors were the main reasons
for his acceptance into the pro
gram.
"Students at Stanford are
lucky that professors are so ac
cessible, and they should take
the initiative to develop close re
lations with faculty," he said.
The Atlantic Council chose
Bunzel — Stanford's nominee —
from a pool of students that
represented every school in the
western region of the United
States.
Based in Washington, D.C.,
the Atlantic Council is a 27-year
old bipartisan group that focuses
its efforts on research work,
policy recommendations and ex
changes in order to strengthen
America's ties with European
and Pacific democracies.
