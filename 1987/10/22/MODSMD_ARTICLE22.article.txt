Traveling in Europe and
meeting high-ranking officials of
the most powerful alliance in the
world may be a dream to some,
but for Stanford graduate Mi
chael Bunzel it was reality.
Bunzel, a 1987 graduate, was
selected as one of six Americans
to participate in the Atlantic
Council's first-ever North Atlan
tic Treaty Organization (NATO)
youth exchange program last
September.
Bunzel, a Phi Beta Kappa
graduate in political science,
represented the western section
of the United States in the 21-
student delegation.
According to Bunzel, "The

delegation ranged in age from IS
to 25, with representatives from
every NATO country."
The goal of the month-long
program was to explore the pos

agreements between Warsaw
Pact countries and members of
the NATO alliance. The group
studied the possible effects of
such agreements on inter-alliance
relations.
After spending three weeks in
the United States, the students
traveled to Europe, where they
visited East and West Berlin and
the NATO headquarters in Brus
sels. "We had a highly sensitive
tour of the USS Vincent, the larg
est U.S. aircraft carrier, and the
opportunity to meet with high
ranking military and political offi

cials of NATO (while in
Europe)," Bunzel said.
Bunzel said the experience in
Berlin, however, had the greatest
impact on him. "The city of Ber
lin graphically illustrated, in two
days, all the issues we discussed
for the preceeding three weeks"
during the trip, he said.
"Landing at Templehof Air
Base in Berlin, Hitler's personal
airport, was especially troubling
for me," Bunzel added. "The
specter of the Holocaust seemed
to come up in every discussion.
The NATO alliance should see to
it that such a catastrophe never
happens again."
On a more positive note, Bun
zel said. "The camaraderie of the
