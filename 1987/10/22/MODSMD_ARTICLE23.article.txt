# The 						Bug Presents....
## Clairol, 'crud puck' and other controversies 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
About half the questions sent
to Bug Me this week were
about the bike lanes east of the
Quad near the Clock Tower,
where both arrows point in the
same direction. Simply put,
somebody goofed. Everybody
makes mistakes. It is NOT a
Communist plot to create bike
accidents. One phone call from
the Bug and it was repainted
immediately. There is justice in
the world.

And many thanks to the per
son! s) who put the Gloria Es
tefan promo photo in my Bug
Me hox at The Daily. She looks
great on my wall. Remember to
keeD sending or bringing those
questions/photos to Bug Me,
Stanford Daily, Storke Bldg.,
Stanford CA 94305. Or send
them to Bug-Me (not B.Bug-
Me) at the Tragedies on LOTS.
Dear Bug Me:
With all due respect to
Christine M. Ricker, who the
hell is she, and why is the
former Sterling Quad Dining
and Performance Center
named after her?
- Flo Moore

Christine M. Ricker, who
died Jan. 19, 1986, at the age of
90, was the director of Stanford
Food Service from 1930 to
1958. That's who the hell she
is. Ricker came to Stanford in
1922 after receiving a degree in
institutional administration
from Simmons College in Bos
ton.
As director of the Old Union
dining facilities (yes, Old Union
once served a useful purpose)
and later more than 40 campus
dining rooms, Ricker was
renowned for her ability to
satisfy the appetites of hungry
students, and to find ways of
getting enough food on the
table during the rationing of
World War 11.
Prior to the war, Stanford's
4000 students managed to eat
well for $65 a quarter. Today,
of course, $65 will buy day-old
breadsticks at Food Service
prices.
Granted, Christine Ricker
was a Food Service celebrity,
but I think it was kind of stupid
to name the dining center after
her. First of all, I can think of
several people who would be
better choices to have a Food
Service hall named for them.
Jim Jones comes to mind.
Secondly, by changing the
name from Sterling Quad to
Christine M. Ricker, nobody
on the east side of campus is
going to know where it is. Why
not leave it as the Sterling Quad
Dining Center and name some
thing else for Christine Ricker.
How about, the Christine M.
Ricker Eggplant Stackup
Surprise Hash Soup Paste.
Finally, when it was the Ster
ling Quad Dining and Perform
ance Center, it could be shor
tened to the acronym SQDPC.
That meant that you could refer
to the dining center as the
"Squid Puck." The new

acronym is CRD&PC. Hello
"Crud Puck." Actually, that
acronym pretty well describes
both the quality and texture of
the food.
Dear Bug Me:
I've noticed that the Univer
sity does not calculate my
GPA. Why is this? Also, there
is always a lot of talk about
'grade inflation.' What is the
average GPA of a graduating
Stanford senior? Graduating
PhD. student?
Getting information from the
Clairol Hotline (no kidding, see
following question) is a lot
easier than extracting facts
from the Office of the
Registrar.
The reason Stanford does not
compute your GPA is that
YOU DON'T HAVE A GPA
AT STANFORD. Pretty scary
concept, I know. What you do
have is a Letter Grade In
dicator, which, for all intents
and purposes, is the exact same
thing with a different name.
Because of Stanford's liberal
add/drop/fail policies, your
GPA might be higher than that
of someone who goes to a real
school, where they can really
fail classes and can't drop just
because they got an 'A-' on the
midterm. Therefore, your LGI
is the GPA of the classes you
have completed.
"The Stanford transcript has
historically been a conservative
document," said Registrar
Sally Mahoney. Meaning that,
if Oracle Corp. wants to know
your LGI, they have to figure it
out themselves. Stanford has
never computed LGls, and
they don't intend to start now.
Stanford has never computed
the LGI of any graduating

class. Or of anybody. Or any
thing. Ever.
Dear Bug:
There's this commercial for
hair coloring that shows a
woman talking on the phone, dis
cussing her plans for the after
noon, which include coloring her
hair (sounds like a wild afternoon
to me). The other person appar
ently expresses surprise, and the
first woman says something like,
"Gee, I can't believe you didn't
notice. /didn't notice either."Do
these models RE ALL Y have their
hair colored with whatever it is,
and if they don't, does it violate
some truth-in-advertising law?
Believe it or not, when Gor
geous Model Number One says
to Gorgeous Model Number
Two, "My gorgeous hair is
colored with Breck/L'Oreal/-
Clairol/Clorox Gorgeous Hair

Coloring," it actually is. In ac
cordance with standards
prescribed by the American As
sociation of Advertising
Agencies, models making claims
about what cosmetics they are
wearing actually must use those
cosmetics.

They would look great
if they used Kool-Aid
to color their hair.

Gorgeous Model Number One
signs a contract agreeing to use
the hair coloring stuff for a cer
tain period of time before, during
and after the commerical is
filmed. Of course, these are Gor
geous Models, and they would
probably look great if they used
Kool-Aid to color their hair.
As for truth-in-advertising
laws, all 1 can report is that I eat
at least eight hamburgers a day.

dump her vegetarian husband
and jump my bones instead.
