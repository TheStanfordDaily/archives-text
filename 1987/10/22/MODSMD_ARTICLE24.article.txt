## Ming's explores elegant, creative Chinese cuisine

Usually, Chinese restaurants are all the same.
They serve the same Americanized Chinese food
and feature the same drab atmosphere — bright
lighting and revolving lanterns with orange fringe.
It's no wonder the elegant cuisine of Ming's Villa
stands out from the crowd.
Possibly the most sophisticated and expensive
Chinese restaurant in Palo Alto, Ming's Villa spe
cializes in innovative and unusual Cantonese
cuisine. Both the high prices and the refined atmos
phere place Ming's way above the typical Chinese
restaurant.
Remodeled last December, Ming's is decorated
with a contemporary touch. Huge marble vases,
etched glass and black lacquer accentuate the pink
and beige decor. The huge dining room is dimly lit,
and revolving lanterns are inconspicuously absent.
Although its name may suggest an Oriental-
Italian restaurant, Ming's Villa features a surprising
menu with few concessions to Americanized
Chinese food. Definitely for the adventurous eater,
Ming's offerings range from Original Recipe Sweet
and Sour Pork Ribs to Braized Sea Cucumber in
Shrimp Roe Sauce and Abalone with Black Mush
rooms in Oyster Sauce.
Ready to explore new gastronomical horizons, 1
persuaded my friend to order the Bird's Nest Soup
with Crab Meat, a sampler plate of appetizers,
Deep-fried Crispy Spring Chicken and Sauteed
Prawns with Chinese Greens.

My friend, complaining that she had been living
on Stern Food Service for an entire month, con
vinced me that we should at least order one
"normal" Chinese dish. We decided on the sweet
and sour spareribs.
The appetizer plate featured a wide assortment
of potstickers, egg rolls, fried wontons, fried
prawns and barbequed spareribs. Patrick, our room
manager, not only arranged the appetizers on our
plate but also kept our plates full.
All of the appetizers were fantastic, especially
the potstickers. Being a potsticker connoisseur, I
found the dumpling to be delicately fried — not
burned on the bottom — with the fresh vegetables
inside a far cry from the pre-mashed vegetables
found in most potstickers.
The service at Ming's was efficient and attentive.
Patrick took our order and helped us to decide what
to order. Bill Wang, the manager, took the time to
hold conversations — beyond "How's your
meal?" — with every customer in the room.
Our next dish, the bird's nest soup, proved to be
an interesting experience. I found the dish to have a
mild, fishy flavor with a strange consistency. Un
known to us at the time, bird's nest soup is made
from the saliva a certain bird produces right before
she lays her eggs. According to Felicity Tse, owner
of Ming's, the ingredient is supposed to be "good
for the energy." Neither my friend nor I experi
enced any increase in "energy" that night, except
for the nausea my friend experienced after she
learned what she had eaten.
Our main courses were as excellent as we had
expected them to be. By far the best dish, the
prawns with Chinese greens consisted of huge,
tender prawns lightly sauteed in a butter sauce. It
came with fresh, crisp broccoli that was flavored

with a hint of lemon.
The deep-fried spring chicken was tender, almost
to the point of being undercooked. It was lightly
seasoned with a crisp, but not greasy, skin on the
outside.
Ironically, the only dish that did not completely
satisfy us was the sweet and sour spareribs.
Prepared without the obnoxious, bright orange
sauce that usually accompanies them, the ribs
tasted good, but we were a bit bothered by the bone
embedded in the middle. One word of advice: If
you're on a date, don't order this dish. It's impossi
ble to eat gracefully.

When we were done with our meal, Tse took the
time to explain the origins of Ming's innovative
cuisine.
She explained that great Chinese cuisine has al
ways existed but has only recently come to the
United States. Chefs in China begin training when
they are 10 years old. In the past 10 years some of
these chefs have left China, bringing their style of
cooking to the U.S., she said.
"Our chefs have new ways of mixing ingredients
with lots of creativity and imagination," Tse said.
These qualities, combined with a refined atmos
phere, make Ming's Villa a restaurant worth trying.
