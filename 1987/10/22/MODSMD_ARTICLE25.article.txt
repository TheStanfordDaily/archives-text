## Semioli leader of relentless Cardinal defense 
### David Hirning 
In talking to anyone affiliated
with the Stanford men's soccer
team, there is no questioning
how important sophomore Mark
Semioli is to the Cardinal.
The trouble is, no one can tell
you exactly why.
"I don't have a big enough vo
cabulary," Stanford Coach Sam
Koch said when asked to
describe Semioli.
His teammates also struggled
for words. "He's the uniting
force," midfielder Chris Ciple
said. "Everything revolves
around him."
When most people think of
great soccer players, they think
of lots of>jgoals. But Semioli
seems to do everything — except
score goals. In fact, the sopho
more has yet to score in his col
lege career. Still, he garners
praise from all his peers and was
named the Cardinal's Most
Valuable Player as a freshman.
One of Semioli's strengths is
finding and passing to the open
man. As Koch said, "He sets up
others very well."
Another of his strengths is ball
control. Even when Semioli is
charging up the field at full
speed, he seems in complete con
trol of the ball. "When Mark gets
the ball, no one is going to take it
away from him," Koch said.
There isn't one skill Semioli is
lacking. However, his most
valuable asset may very well be
his defense. Case in point: Last
week, with five minutes left and
the Cardinal tied 1-1 against the
Washington Huskies, Semioli
stopped a sure Husky goal by
taking a shot in the groin.

Stanford's soccer team is a de
fensive one. Koch teaches the
philosophy that "if they don't
score, they can't beat you." To
Semioli goes the responsibility of
making sure the ball stays out of
the net. Semioli plays the
sweeper position. He's a rover
who can go up, but usually must
stav back to act as the last line of
defense before the goalie. He has
no man to cover, so he must pick
up anyone and everyone who
gets free.
When the Cardinal gains con
trol of the ball, Semioli acts al
most like a quarterback. Though
he rarely scores, he sets the of
fense in motion.
It's a big job, but Semioli en
joys the responsibility."! like the
independence of sweep," he
said. "I er\joy being back there,
rather than midfield, which I
played in high school."
It is a testimony to Semioli's
skillful work that Stanford has
defeated some of the nation's
most powerful offensive teams,
at one point winning four in a row
while giving up only one goal.
But Semioli, an unselfish
player, is reluctant to take any
credit. "It's not really me as
much as the guys in front of me
that are playing well," he said.
"They just really work hard."
Not to imply that Semioli does
not break a sweat. Semioli
"works tremendously hard in
practice," Koch said.
That work goes on year round,
including participation on three
summer teams. Semioli is a fierce
competitor who never slacks off
or gives up. Despite playing both
games with a badly sprained
ankle, he was the MVP of the

AT&T Pacific West Soccer Tour
nament.
As an all-state, all-regional
player out of Long Island, Semi
oli could have gone to any school
in the country. Defending na
tional champion Duke and other
top-20 programs (including Ivy
League schools) recruited him.
But Semioli did not want to go
somewhere where he might not
play; he wanted to be on the field
immediately. At Stanford he felt
he could get at least "some
time."
Education, however, made the
difference. "I was thinking edu
cation first, and Stanford is the
best school in the country.
Unlike his schoolmates playing
basketball and football, Semioli
does not have any pro contracts
or big money in his future. He
does, however, seem to be
prepared for the future.
"It will be tough giving up soc
cer," he said, "but hopefully,
coming out of Stanford, I can do
something else that I want to
do." Semioli is interested in po
litical science and international
relations, but he has yet to decide
on a m^jor.
For now, that dilemma can
wait. At the moment Semioli is
faced with an equally demanding
challenge — to get Stanford into
the NCAA tournament. After
playing well on a demanding East
Coast trip, Semioli thinks the
Cardinal is ready for its equally
tough league schedule.
And with Mark Semioli as the
"uniting force" on its side, there
is no reason the Cardinal can't
realize that elusive goal of a
NCAA tournament berth at
season's end.

lacking. However, his most
valuable asset may very well be
his defense. Case in point: Last
week, with five minutes left and
the Cardinal tied 1-1 against the
Washington Huskies, Semioli
stopped a sure Husky goal by
taking a shot in the groin.

Stanford's soccer team is a de
fensive one. Koch teaches the
philosophy that "if they don't
score, they can't beat you." To
Semioli goes the responsibility of
making sure the ball stays out of
the net. Semioli plays the
sweeper position. He's a rover
who can go up, but usually must
stav back to act as the last line of
defense before the goalie. He has
no man to cover, so he must pick
up anyone and everyone who
gets free.
When the Cardinal gains con
trol of the ball, Semioli acts al
most like a quarterback. Though
he rarely scores, he sets the of
fense in motion.
It's a big job, but Semioli en
joys the responsibility."! like the
independence of sweep," he
said. "I er\joy being back there,
rather than midfield, which I
played in high school."
It is a testimony to Semioli's
skillful work that Stanford has
defeated some of the nation's
most powerful offensive teams,
at one point winning four in a row
while giving up only one goal.
But Semioli, an unselfish
player, is reluctant to take any
credit. "It's not really me as
much as the guys in front of me
that are playing well," he said.
"They just really work hard."
Not to imply that Semioli does
not break a sweat. Semioli
"works tremendously hard in
practice," Koch said.
That work goes on year round,
including participation on three
summer teams. Semioli is a fierce
competitor who never slacks off
or gives up. Despite playing both
games with a badly sprained
ankle, he was the MVP of the

AT&T Pacific West Soccer Tour
nament.
As an all-state, all-regional
player out of Long Island, Semi
oli could have gone to any school
in the country. Defending na
tional champion Duke and other
top-20 programs (including Ivy
League schools) recruited him.
But Semioli did not want to go
somewhere where he might not
play; he wanted to be on the field
immediately. At Stanford he felt
he could get at least "some
time."
Education, however, made the
difference. "I was thinking edu
cation first, and Stanford is the
best school in the country.
Unlike his schoolmates playing
basketball and football, Semioli
does not have any pro contracts
or big money in his future. He
does, however, seem to be
prepared for the future.
"It will be tough giving up soc
cer," he said, "but hopefully,
coming out of Stanford, I can do
something else that I want to
do." Semioli is interested in po
litical science and international
relations, but he has yet to decide
on a m^jor.
For now, that dilemma can
wait. At the moment Semioli is
faced with an equally demanding
challenge — to get Stanford into
the NCAA tournament. After
playing well on a demanding East
Coast trip, Semioli thinks the
Cardinal is ready for its equally
tough league schedule.
And with Mark Semioli as the
"uniting force" on its side, there
is no reason the Cardinal can't
realize that elusive goal of a
NCAA tournament berth at
season's end.

Chosen as Stanford's Most Valuable Player as a freshman last year, sophomore Mark Semioli has become the
heart of the Cardinal defense this year. "He's the uniting force," teammate Chris Ciple said. "Everything
revolves around him."
In talking to anyone affiliated
with the Stanford men's soccer
team, there is no questioning
how important sophomore Mark
Semioli is to the Cardinal.
The trouble is, no one can tell
you exactly why.
"I don't have a big enough vo
cabulary," Stanford Coach Sam
Koch said when asked to
describe Semioli.
His teammates also struggled
for words. "He's the uniting
force," midfielder Chris Ciple
said. "Everything revolves
around him."
When most people think of
great soccer players, they think
of lots of>jgoals. But Semioli
seems to do everything — except
score goals. In fact, the sopho
more has yet to score in his col
lege career. Still, he garners
praise from all his peers and was
named the Cardinal's Most
Valuable Player as a freshman.
One of Semioli's strengths is
finding and passing to the open
man. As Koch said, "He sets up
others very well."
Another of his strengths is ball
control. Even when Semioli is
charging up the field at full
speed, he seems in complete con
trol of the ball. "When Mark gets
the ball, no one is going to take it
away from him," Koch said.
There isn't one skill Semioli is
lacking. However, his most
valuable asset may very well be
his defense. Case in point: Last
