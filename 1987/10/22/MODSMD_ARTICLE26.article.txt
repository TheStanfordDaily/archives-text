# Sailors grab three of top four places at Berkeley

### Hugh R. Bethell Staff Writer 
In what will be remembered
as one of the largest college
regattas of the year, the Stan
ford sailing team came close to
dominating the California Fall
Regatta held in Berkeley last
weekend.
Led by senior Tom Kuhnle
and junior Rita Snape, who
won the A division and were
the top two-person team at the
regatta, the Cardinal took three
of the top four places in an
event that drew 37 boats from
13 of the strongest collegiate
sailing teams in the Pacific
Coast Division.
Only a win in the four-person
division by hometown sailors
from Cal prevented a Stanford
sweep.
Overall places were deter
mined by combining the results

of an A-division and a B
division boat. Joining with
Kuhnle and Snape for second
place overall was the team of
freshmen Dave Dowd and
Sharon Flom, which took fifth
place in the B division. In third
place overall was the combina
tion of senior Drew Gashler
and freshman Kevin Hagan in
A division and seniors Doug
Hagan and Gina Ottoboni in B
division. The team of freshman
Rick Rosen and senior
Courtney Biggert in A division
and sophomore A 1 Sargent with
crews Peter Schmuhl — a
freshman — and Jon Schreiber
— a sophomore — in B division
took fourth place overall.
"I was extremely pleased
with the performance of our
freshman skippers. The first
collegiate regatta is always
tough, but Dowd and Rosen
sailed like they had been in a
dozen before this one," Stan

ford Coach Blake Middleton
said.
Middleton also praised the
efforts of Sargent, who ended
the regatta with a string of four
victories.
"When the other B-division
skippers got a chance to meet
Al. they were surprised that
such a good sailor wasn't
sailing in one of our best boats.
It's a real indication of the
depth of talent on the team,"
Middleton said of Sargent's top
finishes.
For many of the Cardinal
sailors who travel to Berkeley
this weekend, the California
Fall Regatta, with its
sometimes calm and sometimes
howling breezes, provided an
introduction to collegiate
racing.
"I never realized sailing
could be so much fun and get
you so wet," freshman crew Mi
Rung Yoon said.
