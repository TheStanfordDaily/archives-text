# Blame it all on the scabs
## 
### 
A few weeks ago a young man walked into a psy
chiatrist's office. He said, "Doc, I've never been to
a shrink before, but this football strike has got me
depressed.

"You sec I've loved the game of football since I
was a kid. I thrive on the game. But now to see all
those players that were my heroes not playing at
all, and their union in disarray, well, it's got me all
messed up."
The doctor waved his hand and said, "Listen, if
you love the game of football so much, then why
don't you go see one of the scab games. The quality
of play may not be as good, but you may be
pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it is."
The young man sat up. "But Doc, I am a scab
football player."
Heh, heh, heh. Ouch.
Forget the lack of solidarity in the NFL Players
Association. Forget the fact that fans sometimes
showed up in decent numbers to watch fake foot
ball. And forget union leader Gene Upshaw's
"bad" judgment.
The reason the players' strike failed was scabs.
Droves of them. Every NFL team easily filled its

scab roster with men who did not have the talent,
strength or brains to make the regular rosters.
Ask your grandfather about this fact, and regard
less of whether he was a union man or not he'll tell
you it boggles his mind. Rarely in the past have
strikes of any kind been filled so immediately.
Sure, the quality of play by the scabs may have
been poor, but they aid produce the product —
they finished every single game. The television net
works therefore had to broadcast the games, and
the team owners therefore received the big money,
even if the stands were empty.
I was once told there are two things Americans
detest. The first is informants. The second is scabs.
I heard that theory when I was on the East Coast.
Maybe it's true there — paltry crowds of 4000 to
10,000 showed up for scab games in Buffalo, Fox
boro and Philadelphia, while crowds of up to 40,000
attended games in Denver and Dallas.
But everyone scabbed, no matter where they
were located. Stanford and Columbia grads
scabbed. Former Mississippi and Oklahoma
players scabbed. Auto mechanics and stock
brokers scabbed. Why?
Probably their dreams of playing in the NFL
overwhelmed their pride. For this reason, they
messed with the union players' livelihoods. This
week the scab players and the union players are
practicing next to each other.
At the San Francisco 49ers' practices this week,
Head Coach Bill Walsh tried to avoid hostilities be
tween the players by stressing team unity. Forget
that. May the union players make the scabs' last
week in the NFL a living hell.
