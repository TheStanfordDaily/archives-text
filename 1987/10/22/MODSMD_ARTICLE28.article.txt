# Alums plugged into new job database
## 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
The Alumni Association has
created a new database system
designed to give potential
employers access to a pool of ex
perienced Stanford graduates.
The system, called Pro Net,
crossmatches an employer's
criteria for a specific position
with the qualifications of individ
uals interested in an upward
career move.
Though these individuals may
not be actively seeking a new
job, the system keeps them in
touch with special career oppor
tunities.
The service is scheduled to
begin in late November or early
December and will initially work
with graduates in engineering,
business and computer science.
The Alumni Association has
mailed out 51,000 invitations to
all living graduates in these disci
plines.
"We started with these depart
ments, because our research in
dicated that the largest recruiting
interest is in these fields," said
Mark Jordan, Pro Net's director.
"First of all, we have to get the
system rolling financially."
Jordan said information on
graduates from humanities and
sciences will be added within the
next 12 months.
Alumni are entered into the
database free of charge after sub
mitting a four-page resume

detailing work experience, job
responsibilities and pay scales.
The qualifications of possible
candidates are made available to
companies, but names and con
tacts are not given until the
employers have expressed a
serious interest in certain individ
uals, Jordan said.
Companies subscribe to the
service at a cost of $3000 per
year. A special charter member
suscription will be available
through the end of November, al
lowing a company three years of
service for $7000.
More than 50 companies have
already suscribed as charter
members, including Boeing,
Goldman Sachs and Genentech.
Arthur Young recruiter Mike
Hildreth said the system is a
"great idea."
"It adds one more very posi
tive qualifier to a possible em
ployee," he said. "The admis
sions office does part of the
recruiting for us."
Generally, a company will pay
as much as $20,000 to find a
single executive. According to
Jordan, "If a company can find
one new employee here, it's
ahead of the game."
The database system, designed
by Jordan and Pro Net Asst. Di
rector Tom Robinson with the
aid of Basis Computers in
Berkeley, will begin operation as
soon as it has 4000 files, and is
expected to contain as many as
10.000 files by the end of this
year.
