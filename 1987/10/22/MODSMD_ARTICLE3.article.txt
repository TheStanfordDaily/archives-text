### Sean Kinch Staff writer 
Officers of the Interfraternity Coun
cil presented goals for their Alcohol
Task Force and Committee on Rela
tions with Cultural Groups at an IFC
meeting last night.
IFC President Vinny Frost said the
Alcohol Task Force will seek to re
examine the guidelines for fraternity
parties and to change attitudes about
drinking by discussing the problems of
alcohol abuse.
The goals of the IFC Committee on
Relations with Cultural Groups —
which will explore relations with ethnic
minorities — include providing "a con

duit between fraternities and cultural
groups" and sponsoring programs that
will involve those groups, according to
Stuart Levy, IFC vice president and
chair of the committee.
Frost, a senior, asked that fraternity
representatives require students to
show University identification before
entering fraternity parties. He empha
sized the danger of allowing high
school students to drink at fraternity
houses.
"If some high school senior comes to
one of our parties then gets in his car
and crashes . . . that's going to be terri
ble for the entire (fraternity) system,"
Frost said.

"Our basic goal is to try to incor
porate the fraternities with the other
groups on campus," Levy said. "(We
would like] to understand their wants
and concerns and for them to under
stand us. We want to eliminate
stereotypes."
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Diana
Conklin. asked to attend the meeting to
speak on the future of fraternities here,
reassured the IFC that the University
has no plans to eliminate fraternities
that reflect well upon Stanford.
Conklin said if fraternities "live up
to the standards of this university,"
their "future is golden." She added
that those fraternities that do not main
tain such standards "are gone."
