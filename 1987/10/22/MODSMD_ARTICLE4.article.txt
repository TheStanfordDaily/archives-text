# Drug test hearing drags into 7th day
## 
### Nick Anderson Brian Rhoads Staff writers 
In an unexpected seventh day of tes
timony in the McKeever-Hill drug-testing
case, an NCAA official contended yester
day that the organization had made signifi
cant changes in its drug-testing program to
protect the rights of student-athletes.
The testimony was necessary to clarify
several details of the program for Santa
Clara County Superior Court Judge Con
rad Rushing, who will decide within a
week whether to grant Stanford athletes
Jennifer Hill and Barry McKeever a pre
liminary injunction against the program.
Yesterday, Rushing heard testimony
from Ruth Berkey, assistant executive di
rector of the NCAA, describing
procedural changes the NCAA made in
July to correct flaws in the year-old pro
gram.
Under questioning from Richard Ar
cher, attorney for the NCAA, Berkey said
the NCAA had responded to complaints
from athletes that over-the-counter
medication had yielded positive test
results.
"Ineligibility would result from over
the-counter postive tests only if the stu
dent's pre-test declaration was inconsis
tent with the test results," Berkey said.
Berkey also emphasized that drugs ap
pearing in trace amounts of "less than 10
micrograms per milliliter" would not
result in the disqualification of an athlete.
However, under cross-examination
from Susan Harriman, attorn-ey for

McKeever and Hill, Berkey admitted that
the drug-testing consent forms required of
the athletes made no mention of the 10-
microgram allowance.
Berkey noted another example of
safeguards the NCAA has taken, saying
the NCAA relaxed marijuana standards in
recognition of the fact that passive mari
juana smoke inhalation can produce posi
tive test results.
Throughout the hearings, Rushing has
held out the possiblity that he would rule
on the constitutionality of specific parts of
the program, rather than abolishing it al
together.
"It seems to me that the executive com
mittee of the NCAA could simply tune
parts up if the whole is constitutional,"
Rushing said Tuesday in response to a
brief filed by Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal,
Stanford's faculty athletic representative
to the NCAA.
Friedenthal argued in the brief that "the
NCAA membership voted on the drug
program as a whole, not in separate parts.
The program must be sent back in its en
tirety to the membership (if judged uncon
stitutional)."
According to Stanford attorney Debra
Zumwalt, the hearings will conclude to
morrow morning, following closing argu
ments by both sides. The hearing could be
declared a trial on it merits if the NCAA
agrees to a motion made by the students'
attorneys last week, although Zumwalt ex
pressed doubt that anything new would
emerge from a continuation of the case.
"If there is a trial, it would be before the
same judge, [with] the same testimony,
the same witnesses," she said.
