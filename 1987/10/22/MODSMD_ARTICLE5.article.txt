# Grant to aid minorities
## Foundation donates $2 million for education 
### Jason Bloomstein 
Stanford received a $2 million grant this
week to encourage minority students to
enter the teaching profession and to aid
them academically.
The grant, from the California-based
James Irvine Foundation, will be used to
build upon several existing programs
aimed at helping minority students
academically and financially. University
officials said.
The programs include efforts to create
and assist academic relationships between
minority students and members, develop
research programs, attract minority un
dergraduates to Stanford and support their
academic development — especially in the
humanities, social sciences and education.
In addition, part of the grant will be
used to help minority students obtain edu
cation degrees through the doctoral level
and to encourage them to become teach
ers.
The programs were developed by
Provost James Rosse, Dean of Graduate
Studies Elizabeth Traugott, Assoc. Dean
of Graduate Studies Cecilia Burciaga and
Mike Smith, dean of the School of Educa
tion.
"This is an important event," Rosse
said. "The grant from the foundation is

consistent with our perception of major
academic and social problems."
One of the problems the Irvine Founda
tion is trying to correct with the grant is
the projected shortage of educators over
the next 10 years, according to Dennis
Collins, foundation president.
He said 25 percent of college graduates
will need to enter the field of education in
order to satisfy the future demand for
teachers. Only four percent of current col
lege students plan to become educators.
The need for minority teachers is also
great, he said, because in California 50
percent of primary and secondary public
school students are minorities, while only
six percent of the teachers are black and
six percent are Hispanic.
Other problems Collins hopes to tackle
are the scarcity of minority role models,
lack of opportunities for research, limited
understanding of a scholar's lifestyle and
economic hardships.
The foundation chose Stanford because
the University "clearly has people of
quality who can move this kind of problem
forward and leadership that believes in
these issues," Collins said. "I wanted to
do the grant where I thought the chances
for its success were optimal."
"We are pleased to work with Irvine,"
Rosse said.
