# Playing the waiting game
## Student athletes find drug-test case trying 
### kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
After seven days of hearings in
Santa Clara County Superior
Court, Stanford athletes Jennifer
Hill and Barry McKeever said
they were anxious and uncertain
about whether they would win
their suit against the NCAA's
controversial drug-testing policy.
Within a week. Judge Conrad
Rushing will decide whether to
grant Hill and McKeever a pre
liminary injunction against the
drug-testing program.
Hill, a senior in biological engi
neering and co-captain of the
women's soccer team, decided
last February that NCAA drug
testing violated her right to
privacy under the California con
stitution, and McKeever, a line
backer on the football team,
joined the suit against the NCAA
in July.
"It is so frustrating when I
leave the court and do not know

what is going to happen," Hill
said. She joked that "waiting for
(the ruling] is not as nice as
waiting for Christmas."
Saying that she had difficulty
deciding to go to court because
"people might assume weird
things." Hill explained that she
was "too strongly opposed to a
clear violation of her rights" not
to fight the drug-testing policy.
"It was time for me to defend
what I believed in and to do more
than stand up at the dinner
table," Hill added.
Characterized as "a very
daring" soccer player. Hill is ag
gressive off the field as well and
has remained determined not to
give up her light with the NCAA,
which started more than eight
months ago.
Hill said that when she talked
to her parents about fighting the
NCAA policy, they gave her full
support and said she had to do
what she knew was right.
While Hill has never un

dergone drug testing because the
women's soccer team has not
participated in postseason com
petition. McKeever submitted to
drug testing before last year's
Gator Bowl. McKeever, who has
a year of eligibility remaining,
said the NCAA's way of adminis
tering the test always bothered
him, and that taking the test him
self was the compelling factor in
his decision to join the suit.
"We can't turn our backs on
society and the drug issue,"
McKeever said. But he added
that "assuming everyone is
guilty and has drugs in their sys
tem is not the way to solve drug
abuse.
McKeever, a junior in political
science, called for both Stanford
and the NCAA to educate ath
letes and the community about
drug abuse. Hill echoed his senti
ments, explaining that the NCAA

A resident assistant in
Trancos, Hill said the case has
been "a ready-made" Residen

freshman dorm. "I actually have
some freshmen go with me to
court," she said.
Teammates have also accom
panied Hill to court and given her
"total support," according to
Stanford Women's Soccer Coach
Berhane Andeberhan.
Andeberhan said "the team
asked me to cancel practice so
they could go to court with her."
He complied with the request.
Anderberhan said it was
"totally unfair" for Hill to have
to deal with the dilemma of

whether or not to take a drug
test.
Hill was very concerned as a
team captain that the publicity
from the case and the reporters
who came to practices would dis
tract her teammates, he said.
McKeever has said that
"football is the most important
thing in my life," pointing out
that the decision to challenge the
NCAA was difficult for him as
well.
When questioned in court
whether he would boycott
postseason play if compelled to
submit to drug testing,
McKeever said he would have
difficulty making the choice.
After much deliberation, Hill
said, "I honestly do not know,"
when asked what her decision
would be if she had to choose be
tween postseason play and sign
ing a drug-testing consent form.

cational programs "to get ath
letes on the right track."
A resident assistant in
Trancos, Hill said the case has
been "a ready-made" Residen
tial Education program for the
freshman dorm. "I actually have
some freshmen go with me to
court," she said.
Teammates have also accom
panied Hill to court and given her
"total support," according to
Stanford Women's Soccer Coach
Berhane Andeberhan.
Andeberhan said "the team
asked me to cancel practice so
they could go to court with her."
He complied with the request.
Anderberhan said it was
"totally unfair" for Hill to have
to deal with the dilemma of

whether or not to take a drug
test.
Hill was very concerned as a
team captain that the publicity
from the case and the reporters
who came to practices would dis
tract her teammates, he said.
McKeever has said that
"football is the most important
thing in my life," pointing out
that the decision to challenge the
NCAA was difficult for him as
well.
When questioned in court
whether he would boycott
postseason play if compelled to
submit to drug testing,
McKeever said he would have
difficulty making the choice.
After much deliberation, Hill
said, "I honestly do not know,"
when asked what her decision
would be if she had to choose be
tween postseason play and sign
ing a drug-testing consent form.
After seven days of hearings in
Santa Clara County Superior
Court, Stanford athletes Jennifer
Hill and Barry McKeever said
they were anxious and uncertain
about whether they would win
their suit against the NCAA's
controversial drug-testing policy.
Within a week. Judge Conrad
Rushing will decide whether to
grant Hill and McKeever a pre
liminary injunction against the
drug-testing program.
Hill, a senior in biological engi
neering and co-captain of the
women's soccer team, decided
last February that NCAA drug
testing violated her right to
privacy under the California con
stitution, and McKeever, a line
backer on the football team,
joined the suit against the NCAA
in July.
"It is so frustrating when I
leave the court and do not know

what is going to happen," Hill
said. She joked that "waiting for
(the ruling] is not as nice as
waiting for Christmas."
Saying that she had difficulty
deciding to go to court because
"people might assume weird
things." Hill explained that she
was "too strongly opposed to a
clear violation of her rights" not
to fight the drug-testing policy.
"It was time for me to defend
what I believed in and to do more
than stand up at the dinner
table," Hill added.
Characterized as "a very
daring" soccer player. Hill is ag
gressive off the field as well and
has remained determined not to
give up her light with the NCAA,
which started more than eight
months ago.
Hill said that when she talked
to her parents about fighting the
NCAA policy, they gave her full
support and said she had to do
what she knew was right.
While Hill has never un

dergone drug testing because the
women's soccer team has not
participated in postseason com
petition. McKeever submitted to
drug testing before last year's
Gator Bowl. McKeever, who has
a year of eligibility remaining,
said the NCAA's way of adminis
tering the test always bothered
him, and that taking the test him
self was the compelling factor in
his decision to join the suit.
"We can't turn our backs on
society and the drug issue,"
McKeever said. But he added
that "assuming everyone is
guilty and has drugs in their sys
tem is not the way to solve drug
abuse.
