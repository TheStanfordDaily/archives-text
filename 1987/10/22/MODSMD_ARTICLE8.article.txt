INS toughens law on alien children
WASHINGTON — In a ruling that could affect thousands of
illegal aliens, a top federal official announced yesterday that
children who do not qualify for amnesty under the nation's new
immigration law may be deported unless both their parents have
received such protection.
Alan Nelson, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturali
zation Service, also disclosed that adult aliens who do not
receive amnesty may be deported "with no special protection,"
even if their spouses are eligible for legal residence in this
country.
The new regulations were intended to "clear the air" over the
law s impact on families, Nelson told members of a congres
sional subcommittee. But critics charged that the guidelines
would confuse thousands of aliens and discourage them from
applying for legalization.
In particular, several members of the House Judiciary Com
mittee's subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Interna
tional Law said that the deportation of minor children who do
not qualify for amnesty was disruptive to families and contrary
to the intent of Congress.
"The new immigration law was intended to be compassionate
and generous," said the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Romano
Mazzoli (D-Ky.), who helped write the legislation. "It seems to
me that children ought not to be sent away under any circum
stances."
Fed ups money supply after dive
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve, continuing to work
in concert with central banks in Europe and Japan, poured still
more funds into U.S. banks yesterday in its effort to reassure in
vestors that it is determined to sustain economic activity despite
Monday's stock market plunge.
Interest rates fell for the third day in a row as inflationary ex
pectations evaporated in the wake of the selloff in stocks. Inves
tors took heart from the Fed's dramatic easing of monetary
policy.
"The Fed has made it clear that the market needn't fear
higher interest rates right now," said James Capra, a leading
bond analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York.
"They are not going to allow any weakness to develop."
The action by the Fed, together with less aggressive moves by
other central banks, helped propel a broad-based advance in
worldwide stock markets.
Traders said that the Fed injected new cash into the nation's
financial system in the late morning in a further effort to drive
down interest rates and reassure markets.
White House begins deficit talks
WASHINGTON — President Reagan dispatched his senior
economic and political advisers to the House and Senate yester
day to begin searching for a budget compromise with congres
sional leaders, even as senior members of his staff made it clear
that he was far from ready to relax his adamant opposition to tax
increases.
Reagan said he would listen to proposals made by members of
Congress to trim the federal budget deficit by increasing taxes.
But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that just
because "everything's on the table for discussion, that doesn't
mean the president feels any differently about the destructive
ness of raising taxes."
Budget Director James Miller 111 said in a speech that Reagan
"is not going to take a tax increase." The president, however,
suggested later that Miller was simply "guessing what I think."
Under the pressure of Monday's record stock market plunge,
Reagan agreed Tuesday to meetings between congressional
leaders and senior administration officials — possibly including
himself — to tackle longstanding differences over the budget
deficit.
But officials indicated yesterday that it would be weeks
before such talks could be expected to produce any agreement.
Pilot tried landing in vacant lot
INDIANAPOLIS — A "considerably distraught" Air Force
pilot pleaded for understanding yesterday and insisted that he
had done all he could to ditch his crippled jet fighter in a vacant
lot before ejecting and watching it slam into an airport hotel.
The collision Tuesday morning near the international airport
here left nine employees of the Ramada Inn dead and at least six
other persons injured.
Bruce Teagarden, pilot of the single engine A-7D Cor
sair, bailed out seconds before his plunging and powerless
aircraft rammed into the lobby of the seven-story hotel. Teagar
den, only slightly hurt in his descent, has remained in seclusion
on a military base here. However, he left the base briefly for a
helicopter flight over the crash scene with military investigators
trying to reconstruct the accident.
Later, Teagarden issued a brief and anguished statement ad
dressed to families of the victims as well as the people of In
dianapolis.
"It is impossible to express to you how deeply grieved I am
by your loss," said Teagarden, 35, who is stationed at Nellis Air
Force Base in Las Vegas. "1 wish with all my heart that it had
been within my power to keep my plane headed toward that
open field once I aimed it there. Please understand I did every
thing humanly possible to prevent this. My prayers are with you
all."
Robertson camp dogged by scandal
WASHINGTON — When the campaign organization of Re
publican presidential candidate Marion "Pat" Robertson was in
debt last month, records indicate it sold its main computer sys
tem for at least $ 100,000 more than it cost to a shell company in
Denver whose only identifiable official is a Robertson campaign
aide.
The transaction, which Robertson's campaign refuses to dis
cuss with The Washington Post, raises questions about whether
the sale was a legitimate business transaction or an illegal cam
paign contribution by the person, persons or firm that paid the
$337,500 deposit on the system that was listed in campaign
records. Federal election laws do not permit corporations to
contribute to campaigns. Individuals are limited to contributions
of $1000 or less.
The campaign committee, Americans for Robertson, bought
the computer system in January for $233,480 from a longtime
Robertson associate. R. Marc Nuttle, Robertson's campaign
manager, said last week that he was in the process of selling it,
with a lease-back arrangement. The campaign reported receiv
ing $337,500 on Sept. 30 from a Denver computer firm, listed as
"Computer Futers Ltd.," for "deposit-sale of fixed assets."
There is no telephone listing for such a firm in Denver and no
record of it in the state of Colorado's records for corporations,
partnerships or sole propriatorships. There is a Computer
Futures Ltd., at the same address listed in the campaign report.

White House begins deficit talks
WASHINGTON — President Reagan dispatched his senior
economic and political advisers to the House and Senate yester
day to begin searching for a budget compromise with congres
sional leaders, even as senior members of his staff made it clear
that he was far from ready to relax his adamant opposition to tax
increases.
Reagan said he would listen to proposals made by members of
Congress to trim the federal budget deficit by increasing taxes.
But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that just
because "everything's on the table for discussion, that doesn't
mean the president feels any differently about the destructive
ness of raising taxes."
Budget Director James Miller 111 said in a speech that Reagan
"is not going to take a tax increase." The president, however,
suggested later that Miller was simply "guessing what I think."
Under the pressure of Monday's record stock market plunge,
Reagan agreed Tuesday to meetings between congressional
leaders and senior administration officials — possibly including
himself — to tackle longstanding differences over the budget
deficit.
But officials indicated yesterday that it would be weeks
before such talks could be expected to produce any agreement.
Pilot tried landing in vacant lot
INDIANAPOLIS — A "considerably distraught" Air Force
pilot pleaded for understanding yesterday and insisted that he
had done all he could to ditch his crippled jet fighter in a vacant
lot before ejecting and watching it slam into an airport hotel.
The collision Tuesday morning near the international airport
here left nine employees of the Ramada Inn dead and at least six
other persons injured.
Bruce Teagarden, pilot of the single engine A-7D Cor
sair, bailed out seconds before his plunging and powerless
aircraft rammed into the lobby of the seven-story hotel. Teagar
den, only slightly hurt in his descent, has remained in seclusion
on a military base here. However, he left the base briefly for a
helicopter flight over the crash scene with military investigators
trying to reconstruct the accident.
Later, Teagarden issued a brief and anguished statement ad
dressed to families of the victims as well as the people of In
dianapolis.
"It is impossible to express to you how deeply grieved I am
by your loss," said Teagarden, 35, who is stationed at Nellis Air
Force Base in Las Vegas. "1 wish with all my heart that it had
been within my power to keep my plane headed toward that
open field once I aimed it there. Please understand I did every
thing humanly possible to prevent this. My prayers are with you
all."
Robertson camp dogged by scandal
WASHINGTON — When the campaign organization of Re
publican presidential candidate Marion "Pat" Robertson was in
debt last month, records indicate it sold its main computer sys
tem for at least $ 100,000 more than it cost to a shell company in
Denver whose only identifiable official is a Robertson campaign
aide.
The transaction, which Robertson's campaign refuses to dis
cuss with The Washington Post, raises questions about whether
the sale was a legitimate business transaction or an illegal cam
paign contribution by the person, persons or firm that paid the
$337,500 deposit on the system that was listed in campaign
records. Federal election laws do not permit corporations to
contribute to campaigns. Individuals are limited to contributions
of $1000 or less.
The campaign committee, Americans for Robertson, bought
the computer system in January for $233,480 from a longtime
Robertson associate. R. Marc Nuttle, Robertson's campaign
manager, said last week that he was in the process of selling it,
with a lease-back arrangement. The campaign reported receiv
ing $337,500 on Sept. 30 from a Denver computer firm, listed as
"Computer Futers Ltd.," for "deposit-sale of fixed assets."
There is no telephone listing for such a firm in Denver and no
record of it in the state of Colorado's records for corporations,
partnerships or sole propriatorships. There is a Computer
Futures Ltd., at the same address listed in the campaign report.

INS toughens law on alien children
WASHINGTON — In a ruling that could affect thousands of
illegal aliens, a top federal official announced yesterday that
children who do not qualify for amnesty under the nation's new
immigration law may be deported unless both their parents have
received such protection.
Alan Nelson, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturali
zation Service, also disclosed that adult aliens who do not
receive amnesty may be deported "with no special protection,"
even if their spouses are eligible for legal residence in this
country.
The new regulations were intended to "clear the air" over the
law s impact on families, Nelson told members of a congres
sional subcommittee. But critics charged that the guidelines
would confuse thousands of aliens and discourage them from
applying for legalization.
In particular, several members of the House Judiciary Com
mittee's subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Interna
tional Law said that the deportation of minor children who do
not qualify for amnesty was disruptive to families and contrary
to the intent of Congress.
"The new immigration law was intended to be compassionate
and generous," said the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Romano
Mazzoli (D-Ky.), who helped write the legislation. "It seems to
me that children ought not to be sent away under any circum
stances."
Fed ups money supply after dive
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve, continuing to work
in concert with central banks in Europe and Japan, poured still
more funds into U.S. banks yesterday in its effort to reassure in
vestors that it is determined to sustain economic activity despite
Monday's stock market plunge.
Interest rates fell for the third day in a row as inflationary ex
pectations evaporated in the wake of the selloff in stocks. Inves
tors took heart from the Fed's dramatic easing of monetary
policy.
"The Fed has made it clear that the market needn't fear
