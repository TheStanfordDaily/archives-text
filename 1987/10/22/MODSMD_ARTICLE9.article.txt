# Stocks surge for second day
## 
### 
NEW YORK â€” Defusing the atmosphere
of panic that has afflicted investors for days,
the stock market yesterday staged a broad,
powerful rally that featured the second
record one-day point gain in a row for the
Dow Jones industrial average.
Rising yesterday by 186.84 points to close
at 2027.85, the Dow average has in the last
two days recouped nearly three-fifths of
Monday's epochal 508-point collapse. The
widely-followed market indicator had rallied
Tuesday by 102.27 points.
In contrast to Tuesday, when the vast bulk
of stocks continued their steep slide despite
rallies among blue-chip shares, yesterday's
gains spread to the American Stock Ex
change and the over-the-counter market. On
the New York Stock Exchange, advancing
stocks outstripped declining ones by a margin
of 8-1.
The market's action created some sense
that the worst is over. 'T think we've made a
very significant low," said Michael Metz,
market strategist for the investment firm of
Oppenheimer & Co.
Yet many among Wall Street's legion of ex
hausted professionals did not view yester
day's move as a sign that the market's
wounds are healed. Instead, they regard the

rebound as a possibly short-lived bounce
back from the market's catastrophically
lower levels.
"This is a pretty tentative market," said
Eugene Peroni, a market strategist for the
Philadelphia investment house Janney
Montgomery Scott. "Many people still feel
there's something quite ominous out there."
Others expressed concern that the shock of
Monday's debacle among investors could
long outlive any intervening rallies. "Nobody
knows for sure what's going on, because
nobody's seen anything like this before,"
said Joseph Feshbach, technical analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities. "You still have
to see whether you really did lose the current
generation of investors."
Moreover, history shows that strong rallies
often follow decisive stock crashes: On Oct.
30, 1929, just after the stock market's two
worst days prior to Monday, the Dow in
dustrials registered a 12.34 percent gain, still
its third-largest ever. Yesterday's 10.1 per
cent rally is the Dow's fifth largest one-day
percentage gain.
Besides the Dow industrials, the Standard
& Poor's index of 500 institutionally-held
stocks had a second daily record gain of 21.55
points to close at 258.39, and the NYSE

Composite index had its second consecutive
record, rising 11.98 to close at 145.02. The
Amex index reversed Tuesday's loss with a
23.81-point gain, and the NASDAQ over-the
counter index followed suit with a 24.07-point
rally.
Stock prices in Tokyo and London also
showed sharp gains in yesterday's trading,
with the Nikkei average of 225 Tokyo stocks
turning in a record gain of 2037.32 points to
close at 23,947.40, up 9.3 percent. In Hong
Kong, where the stock exchange was shut
down for the week after a record drop Mon
day, officials said the market might reopen
today or tomorrow.
Trading volume on the New York Stock
Exchange finally dipped below its 600
million-plus share pace of Monday and Tues
day, with 449.35 million shares changing
hands in the exchange's third-busiest day
ever.
"You could only consider this market calm
or orderly in comparison to yesterday
(Tuesday) or Monday," said Gene Donney,
chief executive of Elders Futures, a New
York-based securities unit of a big Australian
brewery company. "It's merely wild, instead
of out of control."
