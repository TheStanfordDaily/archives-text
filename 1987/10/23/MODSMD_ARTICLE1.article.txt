# Drug test decision expected next week
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Attorneys delivering their
closing statements yesterday in
the NCAA drug testing case
debated whether the NCAA had
established a "compelling need"
for its drug-testing program that
would override the California
constitution's right to privacy
clause.
Judge Conrad Rushing of the
Santa Clara County Superior
Court will rule by Tuesday
whether to grant Stanford stu
dent athletes Jennifer Hill and
Barry McKeever a preliminary
injunction against the program.
Robert Van Nest, an attorney
for Hill and McKeever, summa
rized his case by arguing that the
National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation had no "compelling
need to justify the intrusion of
privacy of the testing. In this so
ciety, to have to urinate in front
of someone is abhorrent, he said.
"Six superior courts in Califor
nia have examined drug testing in
a variety of situations — bus
drivers, civil employees — and
found no compelling need," Van
Nest said.
Van Nest said the NCAA had
also failed to establish that the
banned drugs actually enhance
performance. "If the problem
exists, it's in the minds of the
athletes," he said. "So the issue
becomes, can you take away
someone's rights just to protect
their health? The answer is no."
Attorney Richard Archer
defended the NCAA with a
strong attack on "those who
identify problems but fail to
come up with solutions."
"No one here has contested
the right of the NCAA to ban
drugs," he said. "Needless to
say, a rule must be enforced.
How, then, is the rule to be en
forced?"
"If we didn't have this rule of
enforcement, Stanford would
have violated it in the Gator
Bowl last year," said Archer, re
ferring to the disqualification last
December of two Stanford foot
ball players after they tested pos
itive for anabolic steroids.
Rushing may have given some
indication of his leanings in the
case when he asked Stanford at
torney Debra Zumwalt,
"Shouldn't the NCAA have the
right of prosecutorial discre
tion?"
