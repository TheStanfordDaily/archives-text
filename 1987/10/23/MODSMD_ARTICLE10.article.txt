## Reagan agrees to raise taxes 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan,
seeking to restore confidence in the nation's
financial markets, yesterday abandoned his
vow never to raise taxes and ordered his top
aides to work with Congress in developing a
deficit reduction plan that "keeps spending
and taxes as low as possible."
He promised that "I'm putting everything
on the table with the exception of Social Se
curity with no other preconditions, and I call
on Congress to do the same."
With Democrats and some Republicans in
Congress already pressing for a tax increase
as a means of reducing the deficit, Reagan's
statement virtually assures passage of at least
a modest tax increase in the near future.
Reagan, whose earlier low-key response to
the plummeting stock markets had been
widely criticized, expressed concern about
the volatility of the markets during a nation
ally televised White House press conference,
the first he has held since March 30.

"We shouldn't assume the stock market's
excess volatility is over," he said.
"However, it does appear that the system is
working, so while there remains cause for
concern, there is also cause for action."
He said that he would take the following
steps in the wake of Monday's 508-point
plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average:
• Meet with bipartisan leaders of Congress
to arrange a procedure for deficit reduction
discussions "that will be productive and con
structive."
• Appoint Treasury Secretary James
Baker 111, White House Chief of Staff
Howard Baker Jr., and Budget Director
James Miller 111 to lead the White House
negotiating team and call on the Senate and
House leaders to appoint their representa
tives so that negotiations can begin immedi
ately.
• Call on members of Congress to abandon
pending legislation to protect American

markets from foreign products.
• Appoint a three-member task force
headed by former Sen. Nicholas Brady (R-
N.J.) now chairman of the Dillon Read in
vestment banking firm, to examine the stock
market procedures over the next 30 to 60
days and make recommendations for any ne
cessary changes.
"This situation requires that all sides make
a contribution to the process if it is to succeed
and a package be developed that keeps taxes
and spending as 'ow as possible," Reagan
said.
Before the press conference investment
analysts and other financial experts said that
it was imperative that Reagan make a strong
non-partisan statement calling for action-
An open, non-political statement, said Ar
thur Levitt, chairman of the American Stock
Exchange, "would do more to restore confi
dence than anything else I know of."
