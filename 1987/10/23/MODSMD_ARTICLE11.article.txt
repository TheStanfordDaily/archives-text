# Disappointing Dow declines
## 
### 
Stock prices declined sharply
yesterday as trading continued at
heavy levels, forcing Wall Street
to shorten its hours for several
days to deal with the mountain of
orders awaiting processing.
Stocks plummeted in the first
hour of trading and never fully
recovered, with the Dow Jones
industrial average posting a
77.42-point loss that took it to
1950.43.
A development that usually
provides a powerful boost to
stocks — a cut in the banking in
dustry's prime rate — had no ap
parent impact yesterday. Banks
cut their prime rates — the rate
used to determine many business
and consumer loans, including
home equity loans — from 9.25
percent to 9 percent.
But traders said there was no

evidence of panic in the broad
based decline that followed three
days of chaotic trading and
record swings by the Dow.
Immediately after the closing
bell, New York Stock Exchange
Chairman John Phelan Jr. an
nounced that the exchange,
which normally operates from
9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., will close
two hours early on Friday, Mon
day and Tuesday to ease the ad
ministrative pressure on Wall
Street firms caused by the enor
mous trading volume.
The NYSE's move was
quickly endorsed by the Securi
ties and Exchange Commission
and followed ny the American
Stock Exchange and the Chicago
Board Options Exchange. Mean
while, Wall Street executives ex
pressed concerns about the fi

nancial fallout that could result
from difficulties settling trades
executed earlier this week.
Before trading started yester
day, Phelan read to the exchange
floor a message from President
Reagan praising the NYSE's
"calm, professional manner"
during "the extraordinary events
of the past few days."
At his press conference last
night, Reagan announced the ap
pointment of a commission to
look for causes of the turbulence
this week in the stock market,
which collapsed Monday with a
508-point drop in the Dow indus
trial average.
Stocks that comprise the Dow
average declined more than 140
points in early trading yesterday,
with selling pressure from foreign
investors so great that trading in

many stocks opened late.
Top-level Wall Street officials
said selling pressure was so
strong in the first hour that the
system "was at what could have
been the brink." But stock ex
change spokesman Richard Tor
renzano said that while many
stocks opened late due to order
imbalances, "the market was
working as it was supposed to
work."
Wall Street traders said there
was relief after late morning
buying absorbed some of the
pressure and began to cut the
losses in the Dow.
Adding to concern initially was
a 25 percent plunge in the price of
the Standard & Poor's 500 stock
index futures.
