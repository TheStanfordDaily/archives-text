# Harvard law professor:
## Lawyers not omnipotent 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
Lawyers can overcome
stress stemming from their in
abilty to solve social injustice
by taking progressive measures
in their lifestyles and work
places, Harvard Law Prof.
Duncan Kennedy told nearly
2(H) Stanford Law School stu
dents yesterday.
Kennedy spoke about the
"privilege without power"
problem in the legal profession,
in which students obtain the
privilege of an esteemed legal
occupation but don't have the
power to "change basic condi
tions of injustice" within the
context of that job.
"The law profession is less
overtly filled with justice con
tent work than L A. Law'
would suggest," Kennedy said.
Kennedy is one of the found
ing members of the controver
sial Conference on Critical Le
gal Studies, which was formed
in 1977 to examine ways of ef
fecting changes within the

existing legal structure, includ
ing law firms, law schools and
government agencies. The con
ference, consisting primarily of
law professors from Stanford,
Harvard, the University of Buf
falo and the University of Wis
consin, includes Stanford Law
Profs. Mark Kel I man, Robert
Gordon and William Simon.
According to Kennedy, the
conference attempts to "figure
things out from a leftist per
spective," or one that recog
nizes a tension between the
idea of justice and the realities
of contemporary society.
Lawyers can choose three
paths to combat feelings of in
effectiveness in the face of so
cial injustice, Kennedy said.
The first is to become what
Kennedy called a "consumer
of liberal culture," expressing
one's liberal views only at
home.
"It involves being just one's
job' on the job, but the minute
you leave work, you merci
lessly trash Reagan on televi
sion,'' Kennedy said.

i he second approach is to be
a "producer of liberal culture,"
which involves "doing liberal
good works," such as dealing
with social and welfare issues
outside of the workplace, Ken
nedy said.
"Both of these approaches
are totally safe. The second is a
good thing to do — I do it
myself — and it's a good way to
meet potential clients," he
said. "I have no moral or prac
tical problem with this. The
only problems are that a stale,
routinized character of per
formance can develop."
The third approach involves
working within the institution
to make internal structural
changes, setting up a "gadfly,
oppositionist position within a
liberal elitist institution."
Kennedy said he has
practiced the third approach by
collaborating with other Har
vard law professors on the con
ference.
"An activist role could build
a consensus that goes beyond
disapproval."
