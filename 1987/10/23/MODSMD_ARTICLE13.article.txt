# Reagan Library location remains uncertain
## Library goes site-seeking 
### Jason Bloomstein 
The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library,
originally slated for placement at Stanford, is still
without a home, despite the submission of 32 site
proposals from universities and private lan
downers, according to Gary Jones, executive direc
tor of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.
The foundation has not set a date for selection of
a site, and no offers have been eliminated. Jones
said.
Several universities began making offers to host
the library last April after the Reagan foundation
canceled its plans to build the facility at Stanford. It
is generally believed that opposition from student,
faculty and community groups at Stanford played a
role in the foundation's decision to build the library
elsewhere.
According to Martin Anderson, a Reagan foun
dation trustee and senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution, numerous organizations have offered
several dozen different pieces of property as possi
ble locations for the library.
According to Jones, many of the offers have
been received from schools in Southern California.
He noted that the "most accommodating'" sites
and landowners are in the Los Angeles
metropolitan area.
Jones declined, however, to specify which insti
tutions have submitted proposals.
Hut several Southern California universities have
publicly expressed interest in hosting the library.
The list includes USC, UCLA, UC-lrvine, UC-

Santa Barbara, Occidental, Claremont and UC-
Riverside.
According to an official at UC-Riverside, the site
eventually selected for the library will probably be
located near the place where Reagan decides to
retire.
Jack Chappell, director of university relations at
UC-Riverside, acknowledged, however, that
details of Reagan's retirement plans are uncertain
at this point.
Robert Biller, a university relations official at
(JSC, said USC "is interested in exploring the pos
sibility of having the site here."
Reagan's alma mater, Eureka College in Eureka,
111., has also said it would like to host the library.
The library will serve as an archival depository
of original source materials from Reagan's tenure
as governor of California and as president.
The Reagan foundation also plans to build a cen
ter for public affairs adjacent to the library. The
center would host conferences and meetings about
the Reagan administration and its policies.
According to Chappell, the library would provide
students and professors with "tremendous oppor
tunity" for scholarship.
"It is attractive for students of American history
and politics to have access to source materials, he
said. "It is also attractive to institutions because it
is possible for them to become centers for studies
that revolove around presidential libraries. This
has happened at other institutions with presidential
libraries."
