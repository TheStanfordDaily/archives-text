### 
Tomorrow afternoon at Stanford Stadium,
most people will be watching to see if the Cardi
nal football team can beat Oregon and collect its
third straight victory after a rocky start. At least
a few people at the stadium, however, will have
one eye on the game and the other on the crowd.
With a ban on alcohol at the stadium still a
very real possibility, University President
Donald Kennedy, Athletic Director Andy Geiger
and other officials will take careful note of the
behavior of the crowd at tomorrow s game.
At least one group of students has heeded the
administration's warnings and is doing its part to
ensure that alcohol will be allowed in the
stadium in the future. The Student Alcohol Task
Force announced last Thursday a twofold policy
that will go into effect tomorrow: Designated
student monitors will patrol the student section,
and individual spectators will be allowed to bring
no more than a six-pack of beer into the stadium.
While it is hoped that in the future an adminis
trative threat will not be necessary to provide
the stimulus for student discussion and resolu
tion of problems, it is nevertheless encouraging
to see the task force address the issues at hand in
a quick and reasonable manner.
Still, responsibility for student behavior
should not rest with one task force or one group
of student monitors. The new policies, while
providing part of the solution, are not adequate
by themselves. A six-pack of beer contains
enough alcohol to make many a person belliger
ent. In addition, student monitors will at most be

responsible for reminding students of the alcohol
guidelines; they will in all likelihood not be able
to subdue people acting in a drunken and disrup
tive manner.
For the new policies to be effective each indi
vidual in the student section will have to be re
sponsible for his or her own behavior, because
each person s actions reflect on the student sec
tion as a whole. Individual responsibility is al
ways a prerequisite when large groups convene
in a confined space, and it will be essential if the
University is to continue permitting alcohol in
the stadium.
Fear of punitive administrative action,
however, should not be the motivating force be
hind responsible individual behavior. Obnoxious
behavior should be avoided out of respect for
other spectators. Nobody should have to endure
a beer shower or feel that he or she is in the
middle of a riot at football games.
Past problems at the stadium have not
emanated solely from the Stanford student sec
tion. But the fact remains that the student sec
tion is highly visible and thus will be used as a
barometer of crowd behavior. In issuing their
stern warnings, Kennedy and Geiger and those
dealing with the situation have in the past un
doubtedly come close to calling for the prohibi
tion of alcohol at the stadium. Only they know
how close they are now. It is up to the Stanford
students attending the games not to force their
hand.
