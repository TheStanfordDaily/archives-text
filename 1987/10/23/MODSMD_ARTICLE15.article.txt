Crude autograph
sets bad example
My husband, two daughters
and I attended the soccer game
Sunday and witnessed a wonder
ful display of athletic ability on
the part of both Stanford and
Chico State. The girls played a
long, hard-fought game, and we
were very impressed with their
stamina and skill on the field.
We were impressed until my 6-
year-old daughter approached
several of the team members
after the game and asked them
for their autographs (We thought
that would be quite flattering to
the players.). I was shocked
when my six-year-old brought
the autographs and asked me to
read them.
One was signed by "Susan B.
Anthony" and made an obscene
reference to the opposite sex. I
think that was totally uncalled
for and extremely crude. The
players are old enough to know
when to keep their thoughts to
themselves and to think twice
about what to write down on au
tograph papers.
Young children are very im
pressionable. Both of my girls
play in a youth soccer league and
came to see how it's "really"
played. They look up to the Stan
ford players as role models. This
display of behavior is not what I
have in mind as an example for

my daughters. When I had to
take away the autographs from
my daughter, it ruined a very
nice day at Stanford.

'Platoon' message
"Hey Muffy, like aren't we
just the coolest to be drinking
these Buds in Memorial
Auditorium? Like wow, pass it
down here, Biff. You're just the
coolest, too." Sounds like the
contrived conversation from a
movie such as "Revenge of the
Nerds?" Alas, these words were
spoken by Stanford undergradu
ates during the Sunday Flick,
"Platoon."
I do not claim to be a historian
of the Vietnam War, nor do 1 pass
judgment on the morals of the
war. But 1 do feel there are
tremendous lessons to be learned
from the experience. We as
human beings need to respect
one another, regardless of race,
sex and ideology. What a
travesty that this simple lesson
didn't even brush by the ears of
these students. They were too
busy being cool. When I could no
longer tolerate their rudeness, I
asked them politely to take their
chit-chat elsewhere. This
"coolest" of dudes said to

"relax." Relax? In Platoon?
Silly me, what else could I have
expected?
My anger toward these stu
dents changed to sadness as I
realized that the Vietnam War
happened during our lifetime.
Yet "Platoon'' has become just
another war flick for these Stan
ford undergrads. To be sure,
"Platoon" is a dramatization of
the Vietnam War, but are we so
naive to believe that war will
never again inflict pain and suf
fering on innocent men, women
and children?
Twenty years ago people our
age fought in an ideological war
in which they were both physi
cally and psychologically killed,
maimed and wounded. Knowing
this and seeing the ignorance of
these sheltered students shocked
me.
Despite their relentless inter
ruptions, I was moved by
"Platoon." I'm sorry these stu
dents did not even pause to lis
ten. Though no movie can ever
capture all the atrocities of war,
the numbness I and others felt
after experiencing such a heart
wrenching film accentuates the
challenge the human race faces.
We must learn to coexist peace
fully, not just in the esoteric
sense but in our everyday lives,
including the movie theaters.

human beings need to respect
one another, regardless of race,
sex and ideology. What a
travesty that this simple lesson
didn't even brush by the ears of
these students. They were too
busy being cool. When I could no
longer tolerate their rudeness, I
asked them politely to take their
chit-chat elsewhere. This
"coolest" of dudes said to

"relax." Relax? In Platoon?
Silly me, what else could I have
expected?
My anger toward these stu
dents changed to sadness as I
realized that the Vietnam War
happened during our lifetime.
Yet "Platoon'' has become just
another war flick for these Stan
ford undergrads. To be sure,
"Platoon" is a dramatization of
the Vietnam War, but are we so
naive to believe that war will
never again inflict pain and suf
fering on innocent men, women
and children?
Twenty years ago people our
age fought in an ideological war
in which they were both physi
cally and psychologically killed,
maimed and wounded. Knowing
this and seeing the ignorance of
these sheltered students shocked
me.
Despite their relentless inter
ruptions, I was moved by
"Platoon." I'm sorry these stu
dents did not even pause to lis
ten. Though no movie can ever
capture all the atrocities of war,
the numbness I and others felt
after experiencing such a heart
wrenching film accentuates the
challenge the human race faces.
We must learn to coexist peace
fully, not just in the esoteric
sense but in our everyday lives,
including the movie theaters.
