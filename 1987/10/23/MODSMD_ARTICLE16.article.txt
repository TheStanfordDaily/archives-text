## Core should stress American identity 
### 
The terms of debate regarding the Western
Culture core curriculum become confused in
the Daily viewpoints of Jim Mihalisin (Oct.
19) and Sreenivasan Iyer (Oct. 20). Both
seem to view any change in the core curricu
lum as a threat to "intellectual depth and di
versity at Stanford" (Mihalisin) through "the
reading of second-hand, and even more prob
ably, second-rate works" (Iyer). This confu
sion could have been avoided if the authors
had taken the time to find out what students
are really fighting for in a new core curricu
lum.

Stanford promotes the core curriculum as
building a "common language" among stu
dents and as ensuring that all Stanford stu
dents examine important ideas that have
shaped our society and who we are. No one
has argued that the core curriculum should
not teach us about the history of our culture
and the development of its ideas. What has
been called into question, however, is the
perspective from which the core is taught and
whether or not this perspective can truly help
us in understanding ourselves and our cul
ture.
If the core curriculum is to genuinely pro
vide us with a common language, it must deal
with that which we as North Americans hold
in common. We are no longer just a colony
that looks to Europe for intellectual and cul
tural guidance. The conquest of the New

World was not simply a one-way cultural ex
change. To teach only the evolution of
European culture and ideas serves to perpet
uate our self-image as merely an extension of
Europe, thereby devaluing the role of every
other cultural influence and interaction in our
history.
It is time for us to assert our identity as
North Americans and to work toward devel
oping an idea of what being part of this cul
ture means. This American perspective
would free us to engage in a new examination
of what we have taken as given in the history
of our ideas. For example, we could learn
that Western Culture's roots did not begin
among the ancient Greeks, as we are taught
now in the core, but instead were brought to
Greece by its Egyptian colonizers.
Perhaps most importantly, we could learn
how this version of history was muffled be
cause "for 18th and 19th century Roman
ticists and racists, it was simply intolerable
for Greece, which was seen not merely as the
epitome of Europe, but also as its pure child
hood, to have been the result of the mixture
of native Europeans and colonizing Africans
and Semites." (Martin Bernal, "Black At
hena: The Afro-Asiatic Roots of Classical
Civilization".)
We could also learn that our system of gov
ernment was not created by the Founding Fa
thers solely as the realization of the European
ideals of Rousseau and Hobbes and Jefferson
by extension. It was only after extensive
study and very conscious imitation of the Iro
quois Confederacy (the government of the
northeastern American Indians) by Jefferson
and Franklin among others, that the republi

can structures of what would he the United
States were formed.
These are just a few examples of how much
more we could learn about our cultural and
intellectual heritage with a change in the per
spective of the core curriculum. Just as there
is more to European culture than we have
been led to believe, there is more to us and
our culture than we have been examining.
The Eurocentric tradition would have us be
lieve that the American melting pot is really a
cream-of-potato soup — all European, with
some others who are thrown in for spice but
are not really necessary.
The idea that we can learn about ourselves
and our heritage as North Americans while
ignoring the participation of Native
Americans, Asian Americans, Afro-
Americans, Latinos and women in the crea
tion of our culture becomes absurd from our
new point of view. The assertion of our exis
tence as more than a derivation of Europe is
not based in nationalism or self-righteous
pride, but rather in an honest desire to prog
ress in a critical self-evaluation.
In other words, those who are working for
change in the approach and content of the
core curriculum are working to insure that
the core delivers what it promises: a
"common language" for us all and the
chance to really examine who we are and
what bonds us as North Americans. Instead
of viewing us as "blacks/women/homosexu
als (circle one)" (Iyer) and questioning our
academic standards, join us in working to im
prove education at Stanford for everyone.

building a "common language" among stu
dents and as ensuring that all Stanford stu
dents examine important ideas that have
shaped our society and who we are. No one
has argued that the core curriculum should
not teach us about the history of our culture
and the development of its ideas. What has
been called into question, however, is the
perspective from which the core is taught and
whether or not this perspective can truly help
us in understanding ourselves and our cul
ture.
If the core curriculum is to genuinely pro
vide us with a common language, it must deal
with that which we as North Americans hold
in common. We are no longer just a colony
that looks to Europe for intellectual and cul
tural guidance. The conquest of the New

World was not simply a one-way cultural ex
change. To teach only the evolution of
European culture and ideas serves to perpet
uate our self-image as merely an extension of
Europe, thereby devaluing the role of every
other cultural influence and interaction in our
history.
It is time for us to assert our identity as
North Americans and to work toward devel
oping an idea of what being part of this cul
ture means. This American perspective
would free us to engage in a new examination
of what we have taken as given in the history
of our ideas. For example, we could learn
that Western Culture's roots did not begin
among the ancient Greeks, as we are taught
now in the core, but instead were brought to
Greece by its Egyptian colonizers.
Perhaps most importantly, we could learn
how this version of history was muffled be
cause "for 18th and 19th century Roman
ticists and racists, it was simply intolerable
for Greece, which was seen not merely as the
epitome of Europe, but also as its pure child
hood, to have been the result of the mixture
of native Europeans and colonizing Africans
and Semites." (Martin Bernal, "Black At
hena: The Afro-Asiatic Roots of Classical
Civilization".)
We could also learn that our system of gov
ernment was not created by the Founding Fa
thers solely as the realization of the European
ideals of Rousseau and Hobbes and Jefferson
by extension. It was only after extensive
study and very conscious imitation of the Iro
quois Confederacy (the government of the
northeastern American Indians) by Jefferson
and Franklin among others, that the republi

can structures of what would he the United
States were formed.
These are just a few examples of how much
more we could learn about our cultural and
intellectual heritage with a change in the per
spective of the core curriculum. Just as there
is more to European culture than we have
been led to believe, there is more to us and
our culture than we have been examining.
The Eurocentric tradition would have us be
lieve that the American melting pot is really a
cream-of-potato soup — all European, with
some others who are thrown in for spice but
are not really necessary.
The idea that we can learn about ourselves
and our heritage as North Americans while
ignoring the participation of Native
Americans, Asian Americans, Afro-
Americans, Latinos and women in the crea
tion of our culture becomes absurd from our
new point of view. The assertion of our exis
tence as more than a derivation of Europe is
not based in nationalism or self-righteous
pride, but rather in an honest desire to prog
ress in a critical self-evaluation.
In other words, those who are working for
change in the approach and content of the
core curriculum are working to insure that
the core delivers what it promises: a
"common language" for us all and the
chance to really examine who we are and
what bonds us as North Americans. Instead
of viewing us as "blacks/women/homosexu
als (circle one)" (Iyer) and questioning our
academic standards, join us in working to im
prove education at Stanford for everyone.

The terms of debate regarding the Western
Culture core curriculum become confused in
the Daily viewpoints of Jim Mihalisin (Oct.
19) and Sreenivasan Iyer (Oct. 20). Both
seem to view any change in the core curricu
lum as a threat to "intellectual depth and di
versity at Stanford" (Mihalisin) through "the
reading of second-hand, and even more prob
ably, second-rate works" (Iyer). This confu
sion could have been avoided if the authors
had taken the time to find out what students
are really fighting for in a new core curricu
lum.
