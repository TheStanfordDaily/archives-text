# No more Mr. Nice Guy

I think I've finally figured out what's wrong with
American foreign policy. We're too damn nice.
While we sit around worrying about what the rest
of the world is going to think of our latest decision,
everyone else is out having a good time breaking
treaties and exporting terrorism. It's not fair, I tell
you.
Most normal, God-fearing countries ask them
selves one basic question in determining the
prudence of a particular policy. Namely, is it pru
dent? Having satisfied themselves of this basic re
quirement, they go home and watch pro wrestling.

America, however, is special. Not satisfied with
mere prudence, we ask ourselves another question:
In addition to being prudent, how will this policy sit
with our allies? Phooey. With a requirement like
that, no wonder we never get anything right.
Of course the decision-making process is infi
nitely more complex than all of that. But sober
minds have to worry about the importance we attri
bute to international peer pressure.
Take, for example, the situation in the Persian
Gulf. The official explanation for reflagging
Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf was certainly
questionable, but the curious thing is that every
one, left and right, concluded that once we got into
the Gulf, we had to stay.
Why? Because withdrawal would "send bad sig
nals to our allies and damage our credibility
abroad." Isn't that interesting? The possible disap
proval of our allies is enough to make us prolong a
costly policy that is not in our best interest.
That disapproval, you understand, could lead to
disastrous results. Without the support of our
allies, we would never have been able to bomb
Libya. Think what would have happened had they
not rushed in with minesweepers and other equip
ment to help us in the Gulf.
It is time for us to re-evaluate our relationship
with the rest of the world. Exactly what can we
count on our "allies" to do for us? We support
them with our words, our dollars and, sometimes,
our military. But what do we receive in return for
this huge, worldwide commitment?
Not much, most people conclude. That's why
Donald Trump got such a favorable response when
he put out a full-page newspaper ad asking why our
allies weren't sharing more of the burden in the
Gulf. That's why Jesse Jackson scores brownie
points when he says we should take our money out
of the world and help Americans with it. We are

economically unable to continue providing a nu
clear umbrella for the world and bailing out
countries with huge loans.
The "isolationism" currently rearing its ugly
head in this country is a very honest, sensible
response to U.S. policy. Sure we support
democracy, and sure we maintain alliances, but at
what cost?
People in this country have a crazy notion that
when we support someone, they should support us
back. But the relationship has been extremely one
sided. Maybe we ought to start disregarding ally in
put into American decisions and start following a
course that is right for us.
There is something in the American mind which
feels a little uneasy about asserting national inter
ests. Perhaps we feel as if we are abandoning all
those lofty ideals that this great land aspires to.
But we have to learn to look out for ourselves if
we are going to remain a strong nation. We need to
regain some of that selfish arrogance that got us
here in the first place. Iran is the extreme example
of a country that ignores world opinion and uses
any means possible to advance the national self in
terest. We call them fanatics, but last I checked
they were making us look pretty foolish.
We don't have to be a big Iran, but I'd sure like
to see us develop a little of that same spirit. By
shackling ourselves to the confines of world
opinion, we allow countries like the Soviet Union
to outmaneuver us on the world scene. It could
be argued that world opinion is a powerful force in
international relations. Gorbachev has glasnosted
the high moral ground right out from under us. Ifis
now the Soviet Union that is making bold, innova
tive reforms and the U.S. is responding like a huge
sack of potatoes.
But here, too, is a lesson for the United States.
The world admires Gorbachev because he is facing
Russia's problems directly and pursuing policies
which advance the national interest. This is not to
say that Gorbachev is following some evil agenda
while manipulating world opinion. This is to say
that Gorbachev is a very astute leader who is
clearly making promising changes in a country
which so desperately needs promising changes.
The world is responding accordingly.
Democracy dictates that our government be
responsive to the wishes of the people â€” our
people. We operate at a dangerous disadvantage
when we cater to the whims of others. In truth,
when America starts conducting a foreign policy
that best supports the needs of America, the allies
will give us the respect we so earnestly desire. For
once we should do something like everyone else
does it. It's too hard to be the world's Mr. Nice
Guy.
Where the hell is Richard Nixon when you need
him?
