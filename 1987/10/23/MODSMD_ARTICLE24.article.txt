## East Palo Alto youths benefit Students teach in summer school 
### Rozanna Fiore 
Instead of enrolling in summer school
themselves, six Stanford students kept busy
this summer by working five hours a day as
teachers for 25 eighth-graders from East Palo
Alto.
The East Palo Alto Stanford Summer
Academy is a I-year-old program that allows
middle school students from the East Palo
Alto area to swim, use computers, read clas
sic novels, develop their writing skills and
learn about the history of their city. The pro
gram lasts seven weeks.
Stanford student Lome Needle started the
program in the summer of 1986 with the sup
port of the Stanford Public Service Center
and the Hewlett-Packard Foundation.
This year, junior Jessica Evans took over
Needle s role and followed the schedule that
Needle developed last year.
Evans said she chose the Stanford students
who staffed the program from a pool of 60 ap
plicants. The participants were selected by a
group consisting of three students, including
Evans and Needle, and a representative from
the Public Service Center.
Counselors were chosen on the basis of
their past experience with children and the
age group of those children, according to
Evans. Each counselor received $1,000 and
free housing for his or her work over the sum
mer.
After hearing about the program through a
SWOPSI class he was taking, junior Jon
Inda, a Casa Zapata theme associate, said he
knew right away that it was something he
wanted to get involved in.
Inda, who has participated in programs
similar to the summer academy, said he has
always been interested in children and has

tutored children from local schools since he
came to Stanford.
Inda is a public policy major and said he
has strong feelings about the importance of
education, which he called "the backbone of
society." He is now involved with the acad

emy's follow-up program that allows both the
counselors and the children to continue the
relationships they developed over the sum
mer.
