## East Palo Alto youths benefit Students teach in summer school 
### Rozanna Fiore 
Instead of enrolling in summer school
themselves, six Stanford students kept busy
this summer by working five hours a day as
teachers for 25 eighth-graders from East Palo
Alto.
The East Palo Alto Stanford Summer
Academy is a I-year-old program that allows
middle school students from the East Palo
Alto area to swim, use computers, read clas
sic novels, develop their writing skills and
learn about the history of their city. The pro
gram lasts seven weeks.
Stanford student Lome Needle started the
program in the summer of 1986 with the sup
port of the Stanford Public Service Center
and the Hewlett-Packard Foundation.
This year, junior Jessica Evans took over
Needle s role and followed the schedule that
Needle developed last year.
Evans said she chose the Stanford students
who staffed the program from a pool of 60 ap
plicants. The participants were selected by a
group consisting of three students, including
Evans and Needle, and a representative from
the Public Service Center.
Counselors were chosen on the basis of
their past experience with children and the
age group of those children, according to
Evans. Each counselor received $1,000 and
free housing for his or her work over the sum
mer.
After hearing about the program through a
SWOPSI class he was taking, junior Jon
Inda, a Casa Zapata theme associate, said he
knew right away that it was something he
wanted to get involved in.
Inda, who has participated in programs
similar to the summer academy, said he has
always been interested in children and has

tutored children from local schools since he
came to Stanford.
Inda is a public policy major and said he
has strong feelings about the importance of
education, which he called "the backbone of
society." He is now involved with the acad

emy's follow-up program that allows both the
counselors and the children to continue the
relationships they developed over the sum
mer.

(Clockwise from lop left) Cameron Snell, Darrell Daniels, Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza, Jessica
Evans, Allyson Campbell and Jon Inda taught eighth-graders this summer as part of the East
Palo Alto Stanford Summer Academy.
Sophomore Jerilyn Lopez-
Mendoza, another of the acad
emy's counselors, said she
looked hack on the education she
had as a child and tried to em
ulate some of the people who
have had an influence on her life.
"I feel like there were lots of
people who did things for me that
probably influenced the way I
think now," she said. "Who
knows, maybe thanks to some of
them I'm at Stanford. I just
wanted to help other kids the
way people helped me."
Junior Allyson Campbell had
similar reasons for joining the
program. "Instead of working in
a lab or taking more academic
classes over the summer like a lot
of pre-meds do, I wanted to meet
people and help others out," she
said.
"I saw that (the program) was
going to be a learning experience
for both (the counselors] and the
students, but as it turned out, I
ended up learning more from
them than I think they did from
me," she said.
For senior Cameron Snell, par
ticipation in the program offered
an opportunity to interact with a
range of people. "Most of my

friends have been from ethnically
diverse backgrounds, and I
missed that diversity when I
came JouStrinford." she said.
"I've been working on public
service projects in East Palo Alto
to give of myself to those who
mifchj benefit from my skills,"
she said.
Snell said she has spent all her
life in Los Angeles and East San
Jose and truly enjoyed hearing
the childrens' latest slang ex
pressions, listening to their fa
vorite music and generally
"keeping up with everything
that's going on with them."
Darrell Daniels, a junior major
ing in political science with an
emphasis on education, was part
of the counseling team that
created the curriculum for the
summer academy.
'Since",2fhe 'program's end,
Daniels, who "loves kids," has
begun plans for his own program,
which students from the past
summer's academy can attend
after school. Though the program '
is still in the planning stages
Daniels has already collaborated
with administrators from local
elementary schools to set up bas
ketball teams.
The goal of the program, ac
cording to Daniels, is to
"promote a mentor-type rela
tionship with black Stanford stu
dents and those of the elemen

tary level. I want a chance for
these kids to interact with people
who are like them."
"I really learned how to appre
ciate teachers," Inda said. "It's
hard work keeping all the kids
happy, especially when some of
them are hyper and don't want to
calm down." Inda said he is
grateful for what he learned from
the children but doesn't neces
sarily want to become a teacher
when he graduates.
One of the most rewarding ex
periences for Lopez-Mendoza
was the chance to see some of
the children go from wanting to
leave school as soon as possible
to considering which colleges
they want to attend after graduat
ing from high school.
In response to the childrens'
growing interest injiigher educa
tion, Mendoza s™d the coun
selors immediately scheduled an
hour when the students could ask
questions about higher educa
tion.
According to Evans, the 25
students in this summer's pro
gram were "mainly minority stu
dents like blacks, Chicanos and
Pacific Islanders."
Counselor positions are now
open for next year's session and
applications can be picked up in
the Public Service Center in
Owen House.

friends have been from ethnically
diverse backgrounds, and I
missed that diversity when I
came JouStrinford." she said.
"I've been working on public
service projects in East Palo Alto
to give of myself to those who
mifchj benefit from my skills,"
she said.
Snell said she has spent all her

the childrens' latest slang ex

"keeping up with everything

Darrell Daniels, a junior major
ing in political science with an
emphasis on education, was part
of the counseling team that
created the curriculum for the
summer academy.
'Since",2fhe 'program's end,
Daniels, who "loves kids," has
begun plans for his own program,
which students from the past
summer's academy can attend
after school. Though the program '
is still in the planning stages
Daniels has already collaborated
with administrators from local
elementary schools to set up bas
ketball teams.
The goal of the program, ac
cording to Daniels, is to
"promote a mentor-type rela
tionship with black Stanford stu
dents and those of the elemen

tary level. I want a chance for
these kids to interact with people
who are like them."
"I really learned how to appre
ciate teachers," Inda said. "It's
hard work keeping all the kids
happy, especially when some of
them are hyper and don't want to
calm down." Inda said he is
grateful for what he learned from
the children but doesn't neces
sarily want to become a teacher
when he graduates.
One of the most rewarding ex
periences for Lopez-Mendoza
was the chance to see some of
the children go from wanting to
leave school as soon as possible
to considering which colleges
they want to attend after graduat
ing from high school.
In response to the childrens'
growing interest injiigher educa
tion, Mendoza s™d the coun
selors immediately scheduled an
hour when the students could ask
questions about higher educa
tion.
According to Evans, the 25
students in this summer's pro
gram were "mainly minority stu
dents like blacks, Chicanos and
Pacific Islanders."
Counselor positions are now
open for next year's session and
applications can be picked up in
the Public Service Center in
Owen House.
Instead of enrolling in summer school
themselves, six Stanford students kept busy
this summer by working five hours a day as
teachers for 25 eighth-graders from East Palo
Alto.
The East Palo Alto Stanford Summer
Academy is a I-year-old program that allows
middle school students from the East Palo
Alto area to swim, use computers, read clas
sic novels, develop their writing skills and
learn about the history of their city. The pro
gram lasts seven weeks.
Stanford student Lome Needle started the
program in the summer of 1986 with the sup
port of the Stanford Public Service Center
and the Hewlett-Packard Foundation.
This year, junior Jessica Evans took over
Needle s role and followed the schedule that
Needle developed last year.
Evans said she chose the Stanford students
who staffed the program from a pool of 60 ap
plicants. The participants were selected by a
group consisting of three students, including
Evans and Needle, and a representative from
the Public Service Center.
Counselors were chosen on the basis of
their past experience with children and the
age group of those children, according to
Evans. Each counselor received $1,000 and
free housing for his or her work over the sum
mer.
After hearing about the program through a
SWOPSI class he was taking, junior Jon
Inda, a Casa Zapata theme associate, said he
knew right away that it was something he
wanted to get involved in.
Inda, who has participated in programs
similar to the summer academy, said he has
always been interested in children and has

tutored children from local schools since he
came to Stanford.
Inda is a public policy major and said he
has strong feelings about the importance of
education, which he called "the backbone of
society." He is now involved with the acad

emy's follow-up program that allows both the
counselors and the children to continue the
relationships they developed over the sum
mer.

Sophomore Jerilyn Lopez-
Mendoza, another of the acad

looked hack on the education she
had as a child and tried to em
ulate some of the people who
have had an influence on her life.
"I feel like there were lots of
people who did things for me that
probably influenced the way I
think now," she said. "Who
knows, maybe thanks to some of
them I'm at Stanford. I just
wanted to help other kids the
way people helped me."
Junior Allyson Campbell had
similar reasons for joining the
program. "Instead of working in
a lab or taking more academic
classes over the summer like a lot
of pre-meds do, I wanted to meet
people and help others out," she
said.
"I saw that (the program) was
going to be a learning experience
