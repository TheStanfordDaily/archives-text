# Silkwood lawyers set to speak here
## 
### Yeong Kwak 
During the coming week,
the Stanford community will
have the opportunity to learn
more about a lawsuit that
charges various government
bodies with assassination, ter
rorism, gun running and drug
smuggling in Central America
and other parts of the world.
Daniel Sheehan, chief coun
sel for the Christie Institute,
the group that filed the suit,
will speak Tuesday night at
Kresge Auditorium as a part of
Ecumenical Ministries of
Stanford's Central Education
Week. Two programs shown
on SUNet, the Stanford cable
network, will also feature
Sheehan speaking on the suit
this Sunday and Monday
evenings.
The Christie Institute is a
law and public policy group
that was founded by the legal
team that won a $1.38 million
settlement in the 1979 Karen
Silkwood case.
Silkwood's case was filed
against the Kerr-McGee cor
poration for negligence and in
adequate safety procedures
that caused her home to be
contaminated by plutonium.
As the team of lawyers did
in the Silkwood case, the

Christie Institute seeks to use
the legal system in the United
States "as a positive tool to
bring about social change."
The institute selects cases on
the basis of their "potential for
focusing public attention on a
social problem and on the
likelihood of a precedent
setting legal victory," accord
ing to the group's literature.
Although the group's cur
rent suit is the institute's big
gest undertaking to date, it has
a solid record in controversial
cases including victories for
the sanctuary movement, resi
dents of Three Mile Island and
the families of murdered anti-
Ku Klux Klan demonstrators
in Greensboro, N.C.
The plaintiffs in the new suit
are Tony Avirgan and his wife,
Martha Honey, two American
free-lance journalists based in
Costa Rica.
On May 30, 1984, in La
Penca, Nicaragua, contra
leader Eden Pastora was hold
ing a press conference to
denounce a rival contra fac
tion as a CIA puppet. A bomb
went off, killing several of the
people in attendance and injur
ing many others.
Among the injured was Avir
gan, who was covering the event
for ABC. The suit asks for $20
million in damages from 29
defendants who were allegedly
involved in the bombing.
By suing under the Racketeer-
Influenced and Corrupt Organi
zations Act, designed to combat
organized crime, the institute has
gained broad legal authority, in
cluding the use of federal sub
poena power. Under the act it is
obliged to establish a "previous
historical pattern of activity," a
requirement that Sheehan said
the institute is more than
prepared to meet.
So far, the institute asserts that
it has uncovered criminal activi
ties by a "secret team'
composed of former and current
CIA and military officials, drug
traffickers and members of the
Cuban Mafia. The institute al
leges that the team has been op
erating since the early 19605,
when it was formed by then-Vice
President Nixon to overthrow
Fidel Castro.
The defendants in the suit in
clude several people who have
gained notoriety as a result of
their involvement in the Iran

contra scandal: retired Major
General Richard Secord;
Theodore Shackley, former dep
uty director of the CIA; and
Oliver North s emissary to the
contras, Robert Owen, who
spoke on campus last Tuesday.
rhe suit portrays the La Penca
bombing as only the latest activ
ity of the "secret team" follow
ing criminal actions in Cuba,
Southeast Asia, Chile and Iran.
One of the suit's most controver
sial charges is that the group used
contra supply routes to smuggle
Columbian cocaine to the United
States, where it was used to buy
more arms.
The case, which will go to trial
in Miami sometime next year,
has generated a great deal of con
troversy.
"The suit is the most outra
geous fairy tale that anybody's
ever read," Secord said of the
Christie Institute's case during
his testimony May Sin the Iran
contra hearings.
Dale Van Atta, a syndicated
columnist who recently spoke on
campus with Owen, said that the
CBS news program "60
Minutes' canceled a story on the
lawsuit because it was unable to
obtain enough documentation
supporting the suit's allegations.
But as details of the Iran
contra scandal came to light,
they matched the details of the

Institute's affidavit. The suit was
filed six months before the scan
dal broke.
The institute "has been impor
tant in initiating a series of inves
tigations that eventually found
the light of day in the Iran-contra
hearings," said Terry Karl, assis
tant professor of political sci
ence.
Rev. Herb Schmidt of the Ecu
menical Ministries of Stanford
called the scheduled speech by
Sheehan "very appropriate,"
coming as it does on the heels of
the Oliver North slide show and
the talk by Owen and Van Atta on
campus. Although Sheehan's
charges are incredible "because
of his record in the sanctuary and
the Silkwood cases, we can't dis
miss them," Schmidt said.
Schmidt said that "when such
serious charges are made we
need an opportunity to hear and
question them for ourselves."
The Christie Institute takes its
name from the "Christie Force,"
a concept posited by a Jesuit phi
losopher. The "Christie Force,"
according to the theory, indicates
the harmony that binds all things
together and overcomes
destructive forces.
SUNet will show the Christie
Institute program at 5 p.m. Sun
day and S p.m. Monday. Sheehan
will speak at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday
in Kresge Auditorium.
