# Silkwood lawyers set to speak here

### Yeong Kwak 
During the coming week,
the Stanford community will
have the opportunity to learn
more about a lawsuit that
charges various government
bodies with assassination, ter
rorism, gun running and drug
smuggling in Central America
and other parts of the world.
Daniel Sheehan, chief coun
sel for the Christie Institute,
the group that filed the suit,
will speak Tuesday night at
Kresge Auditorium as a part of
Ecumenical Ministries of
Stanford's Central Education
Week. Two programs shown
on SUNet, the Stanford cable
network, will also feature
Sheehan speaking on the suit
this Sunday and Monday
evenings.
The Christie Institute is a
law and public policy group
that was founded by the legal
team that won a $1.38 million
settlement in the 1979 Karen
Silkwood case.
Silkwood's case was filed
against the Kerr-McGee cor
poration for negligence and in
adequate safety procedures
that caused her home to be
contaminated by plutonium.
As the team of lawyers did
in the Silkwood case, the

Christie Institute seeks to use
the legal system in the United
States "as a positive tool to
bring about social change."
The institute selects cases on
the basis of their "potential for
focusing public attention on a
social problem and on the
likelihood of a precedent
setting legal victory," accord
ing to the group's literature.
Although the group's cur
rent suit is the institute's big
gest undertaking to date, it has
a solid record in controversial
cases including victories for
the sanctuary movement, resi
dents of Three Mile Island and
the families of murdered anti-
Ku Klux Klan demonstrators
in Greensboro, N.C.
The plaintiffs in the new suit
are Tony Avirgan and his wife,
Martha Honey, two American
free-lance journalists based in
Costa Rica.
On May 30, 1984, in La
Penca, Nicaragua, contra
leader Eden Pastora was hold
ing a press conference to
denounce a rival contra fac
tion as a CIA puppet. A bomb
went off, killing several of the
people in attendance and injur
ing many others.
