## Season opens with Arden's quirky 'Bagman' 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
The Stanford Drama Depart
ment opened its new season
Wednesday with a production of
John Arden's radio play, "The
Bagman." As is generally typical
of Drama Department produc
tions, the acting is first-rate, and
the direction tight and under
stated.
"The Bagman" was originally
written as a play for BBC Radio
in Britain in 1970. Arden, a left
wing British playwright, is best
known for his works, "Sergeant
Musgrave's Dance" and"The
Workhouse Donkey." In spite of
his radical views and his distrust
of the commercial theater, Ar
den's plays have been hailed for
their wit and imaginitively artifi
cial quality.
Director Rob Baker has taken
Arden's raw radio script and
molded a curious production that
can be described both as a dra
matic reading and an acting per
formance.
At the front of the stage is the
narrator, John Arden himself
(played by Oliver Gerland), while
in the background are four actors
who take on the more than a
dozen roles that come and go
quickly throughout the play.
The terrific David Kurtz
becomes a park attendant, a min
ister of the public, a king and
other characters, while hulking
Christopher Hart moves effort
lessly in and out of an equally
diverse range of characters.

Rounding out the cast are Char
lotte Alexander and Ann Pod
lozny, both of whom make use of
their voices as well as their
bodies with ease and emphasis.
Only the narrator remains the
same character throughout the
play; the others support him by
transforming into new characters
as he moves through his
dreamlike world. The actors
move in and out of the lighting in
the background, one moment
hobbling as a crotchety public of
ficial, the next sitting quietly out
of the way, waiting for the next
character or sound to come
about.
Although the play is short (an
hour and a quarter), the actors
have found the performances to
be very challenging. According
to Kurtz, the requirement that he
constantly change characters and
accents means that he always has
to be on his toes. "In an ordinary
play you have half an hour to
prepare for your one character,"
Kurtz says. "Here, you're
changing characters constantly."
Gerland, who narrates from his
script on a short music stand in
front of the audience, adds, "1
have to remember to keep my
head up [from the page], and to
react to the action which is hap
pening behind me." Despite
these difficulties in staging and
acting, the entire cast does a ter
rific job interpreting the play.
As on radio, the actors not
only take on different voices and
different characters, but also
handle the play's sound effects.

At various junctures in the pro
duction, actors bang a gong,
chirp like birds, work ratchety
noisemakers and contribute
other sounds to the background
of the play.
You could enjoy this produc
tion without ever opening your
eyes, but it's worth leaving your
eyes open to watch the visual
aspects of this radio play spring
to life. The production is so true
to its radio roots, in fact, that the

actors carry their scripts with
them, as if they were simply per
forming for a microphone instead
of an audience. And the intimacy
of the Nitery contributes nicely
to the atmosphere of the produc
tion.
The plot of "The Bagman" is
difficult to capsulize. Although
the action does take us more or
less through a dreamlike ad
venture, the recurring themes of
death, life, sex and pain are dealt

with somewhat obtusely. Al
though it's thought-provoking,
the play sometimes gets muddled
in its own pretentions and
becomes confusing.
Nevertheless, this is not an
other ridiculous surreal, existen
tial, metaphysical play that
leaves the theatergoer gasping
for a plot. "Alice in Wonder
land" meets "The Wizard of
Oz" would be an accurate way of
describing it.

"The Bagman" is not for the
theater patron who prefers
straightforward slice-of-life plays
with simple family-oriented
messages. But if you don't have
an aversion to strange and myste
rious stuff, this is definitely
worth checking out.
Tickets are available at Tresid
der Union for "The Bagman,"
which plays tonight and tomor
row night at 8 p.m., and Sunday
at 2 p.m.
