## Muster expected to play; Hopkins out Card, 2-4, looks to cook Ducks' goose 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
In the past, Oregon has been a school
most teams look forward to playing.
Not this year.
The Ducks, who come to Stanford
Stadium at 1 p.m. tomorrow, have not
only been ranked in the top 20 this year
for the first time since 1970; they have
also pulled off upsets over traditional
powerhouses Washington and USC.
Oregon, 4-2 overall, is third in the Pacific
10 Conference with a 2-1 league record.
Seventh-place Stanford has a 1-2 con
ference record and is 2-4 overall after
winning its last two games, at Washing
ton State and San Diego State. The Cardi
nal offense scored 44 points in each con
test, despite the absence of 1986 Pac-10
Offensive Player of the Year Brad
Muster, who suffered a serious ankle
sprain on the first day of fall practice.
Muster, who has compiled 280 yards
rushing, 204 yards receiving and five
touchdowns against Oregon the last two
years, practiced all week and will play
against the Ducks tomorrow, according
to the Stanford coaching staff.
Freshman kicker John Hopkins will not
play, however. Hopkins, who kicked six
field goals in Stanford's two wins the last
two weeks and is 8-for-l 1 in field goal at
tempts this season, injured himself in
practice Tuesday when someone attempt
ing to block a kick came down on Hop
kins' left knee, twisting it.
The injury, diagnosed as a sprained
medial colateral ligament, will keep the
left-footed kicker out of action from four
to six weeks.

"I was off to a good start," Hopkins
said. "It's just something I've got to ac
cept."
"I'm kind of concerned because it's a
knee injury, and they sometimes tend to
be recurring. I can handle it now, but if it
recurred, it would be hard to handle,"
said Hopkins, who is also a high jumper
on the Stanford track team.
Senior kicker David Sweeney, who,
ironically, is from the same high school in
Dallas that Hopkins attended, will take
over the kicking duties. Sweeney was the
starting kicker the past two years before
losing the job to Hopkins in the second
game of this season.
Sweeney had an excellent sophomore
year, hitting 12-of-18 field goals including
a 50-yarder, but had a dismal time last
season, connecting on just 4 of 15 at
tempts. Serving primarily as a pooch
punter this year, Sweeney missed his
only field goal attempt of the season in
Stanford's first game at Washington.
"He hates to take my job because I got
hurt," Hopkins said. "But he's been
ready, he's been practicing. He didn't
back down at all. I think he'll do fine."
Linebacker Kurt Colehower is the only
other Cardinal player listed as doubtful
for tomorrow's game. The senior, who
has 38 tackles to his credit, sprained an
ankle against San Diego State and may sit
out the Oregon contest. That's bad news
for a defense that surrendered 536 yards
through the air to San Diego State quar
terback Todd Santos last week.

an aggressive style of play," Stanford

If it is to heat Oregon tomorrow at Stanford Stadium, the Cardinal will need more big defensive plays like this sack of San
Diego State quarterback Todd Santos last week by Kevin Richardson (46). In six games this season, the Cardinal defense has
allowed an average of 30.3 points per game.
Coach Jack Elway said. "We're
not going to stop Oregon's of
fense cold. We've got to execute
and play with a whole lot of in
tensity."
The Stanford defense did set
up 24 points against San Diego
State, and collected seven sacks
against Santos.
Things don't get much easier
against the Ducks, however, who
showed that they can score in
beating Washington 29-22 and
USC 34-27. "I think we've
played some very good football,

certainly through our first four or
five games," Oregon Coach Rich
Brooks said.
But is Brooks a happy man?
Apparently not. "I'm pretty dis
couraged right now because 1
thought we had a chance to beat
UCLA and we blew it,"he said.
The Ducks really blew it.
Down by a score of just 17-7 at
the half last week, Oregon lost
41-10 in a contest that had been
billed as a showdown for the Pac
-10 Conference championship 41-
10.
Against UCLA, the Ducks,
who were second in the nation in
turnover margin the previous
week, turned the ball over seven
times in the contest on four

fumbles and three interceptions.
The Ducks also fell for the
Briuns' infamous "Bummeroo
ski" fake punt in the third quar
ter — a play in which blocking
back Mel Fair took the snap and
handed the ball forward to fresh
man linebacker Randy Austin,
who ran untouched down the left
sideline for a 38-yard touchdown.
"We had guys running all over
the field who didn't know where
the ball was," Brooks said.
"There were guys standing right
next to him, and he was hiding
the ball under his fanny. We were
fooled totally."
UCLA didn't fool the Oregon
defense, however. The Ducks
held the Briuns — a team that

clobbered the Cardinal 49-0 — to
just 280 yards in total offense,
while Oregon piled up 289 total
yards.
"Last year people lined up and
ran at will against us," Brooks
said. "This year they can't do
that."
The biggest surprise for the
surprising Ducks has been quar
terback Bill Musgrave, who is
fifth in the nation in passing effi
ciency and 14th in total offense,
with 223 yards per game. The
redshirt freshman has completed
63.3 percent of his passes for
1371 yards and II touchdowns on
the season.
"Musgrave is a real pleasant
surprise," Brooks said. "We

knew we had a good thing, hut
we weren't expecting what he's
done."
"He's executing the offense
well," Elway said. "He's not
strong-armed, hut he's extremely
accurate. He also has outstand
ing receivers and running hacks
as well."
One of Oregon's most out
standing receivers, senior split
end J.J. Birden, who is averaging
22.1 yards per catch, may miss
tomorrow's matchup, however.
Birden sprained an ankle against
UCLA and spent the early part of
the week on crutches.
Leading rusher Derek Loville
is also not completely healthy,
still hampered by a toe injury suf

fered in Oregon's opener against
Colorado. The sophomore tail
back has 250 yards on 73 carries
and three touchdowns in just
three games. Sophomore full
back Latin Berry has 194 yards
on 54 carries. •>
Another sophomore, split end
Terry Obee, is Oregon's leading
receiver with 18 catches for 347
yards.
"Our philosophy is not to look
at any team as an underdog,"
Stanford defensive tackle Sean
Scheller said. "We prefer to be in
an underdog position. Oregon
beat two traditionally good
teams, so there's no doubt we'll
prepare for them like any other
team."

field goals in Stanford's two wins the last
two weeks and is 8-for-l 1 in field goal at
tempts this season, injured himself in
practice Tuesday when someone attempt
ing to block a kick came down on Hop
kins' left knee, twisting it.
The injury, diagnosed as a sprained
medial colateral ligament, will keep the
left-footed kicker out of action from four
to six weeks.

"I was off to a good start," Hopkins
said. "It's just something I've got to ac
cept."
"I'm kind of concerned because it's a
knee injury, and they sometimes tend to
be recurring. I can handle it now, but if it
recurred, it would be hard to handle,"
said Hopkins, who is also a high jumper
on the Stanford track team.
Senior kicker David Sweeney, who,
ironically, is from the same high school in
Dallas that Hopkins attended, will take
over the kicking duties. Sweeney was the
starting kicker the past two years before
losing the job to Hopkins in the second
game of this season.
Sweeney had an excellent sophomore
year, hitting 12-of-18 field goals including
a 50-yarder, but had a dismal time last
season, connecting on just 4 of 15 at
tempts. Serving primarily as a pooch
punter this year, Sweeney missed his
only field goal attempt of the season in
Stanford's first game at Washington.
"He hates to take my job because I got
hurt," Hopkins said. "But he's been
ready, he's been practicing. He didn't
back down at all. I think he'll do fine."
Linebacker Kurt Colehower is the only
other Cardinal player listed as doubtful
for tomorrow's game. The senior, who
has 38 tackles to his credit, sprained an
ankle against San Diego State and may sit
out the Oregon contest. That's bad news
for a defense that surrendered 536 yards
through the air to San Diego State quar
terback Todd Santos last week.

an aggressive style of play," Stanford

If it is to heat Oregon tomorrow at Stanford Stadium, the Cardinal will need more big defensive plays like this sack of San
Diego State quarterback Todd Santos last week by Kevin Richardson (46). In six games this season, the Cardinal defense has
allowed an average of 30.3 points per game.
Coach Jack Elway said. "We're
not going to stop Oregon's of
fense cold. We've got to execute
and play with a whole lot of in
tensity."
The Stanford defense did set
up 24 points against San Diego
State, and collected seven sacks
against Santos.
Things don't get much easier
against the Ducks, however, who
showed that they can score in
beating Washington 29-22 and
USC 34-27. "I think we've
played some very good football,

certainly through our first four or
five games," Oregon Coach Rich
Brooks said.
But is Brooks a happy man?
Apparently not. "I'm pretty dis
couraged right now because 1
thought we had a chance to beat
UCLA and we blew it,"he said.
The Ducks really blew it.
Down by a score of just 17-7 at
the half last week, Oregon lost
41-10 in a contest that had been
billed as a showdown for the Pac
-10 Conference championship 41-
10.
Against UCLA, the Ducks,
who were second in the nation in
turnover margin the previous
week, turned the ball over seven
times in the contest on four

fumbles and three interceptions.
The Ducks also fell for the
Briuns' infamous "Bummeroo
ski" fake punt in the third quar
ter — a play in which blocking
back Mel Fair took the snap and
handed the ball forward to fresh
man linebacker Randy Austin,
who ran untouched down the left
sideline for a 38-yard touchdown.
"We had guys running all over
the field who didn't know where
the ball was," Brooks said.
"There were guys standing right
next to him, and he was hiding
the ball under his fanny. We were
fooled totally."
UCLA didn't fool the Oregon
defense, however. The Ducks
held the Briuns — a team that

clobbered the Cardinal 49-0 — to
just 280 yards in total offense,
while Oregon piled up 289 total
yards.
"Last year people lined up and
ran at will against us," Brooks
said. "This year they can't do
that."
The biggest surprise for the
surprising Ducks has been quar
terback Bill Musgrave, who is
fifth in the nation in passing effi
ciency and 14th in total offense,
with 223 yards per game. The
redshirt freshman has completed
63.3 percent of his passes for
1371 yards and II touchdowns on
the season.
"Musgrave is a real pleasant
surprise," Brooks said. "We

knew we had a good thing, hut
we weren't expecting what he's
done."
"He's executing the offense
well," Elway said. "He's not
strong-armed, hut he's extremely
accurate. He also has outstand
ing receivers and running hacks
as well."
One of Oregon's most out
standing receivers, senior split
end J.J. Birden, who is averaging
22.1 yards per catch, may miss
tomorrow's matchup, however.
Birden sprained an ankle against
UCLA and spent the early part of
the week on crutches.
Leading rusher Derek Loville
is also not completely healthy,
still hampered by a toe injury suf

fered in Oregon's opener against
Colorado. The sophomore tail
back has 250 yards on 73 carries
and three touchdowns in just
three games. Sophomore full
back Latin Berry has 194 yards
on 54 carries. •>
Another sophomore, split end
Terry Obee, is Oregon's leading
receiver with 18 catches for 347
yards.
"Our philosophy is not to look
at any team as an underdog,"
Stanford defensive tackle Sean
Scheller said. "We prefer to be in
an underdog position. Oregon
beat two traditionally good
teams, so there's no doubt we'll
prepare for them like any other
team."
In the past, Oregon has been a school
most teams look forward to playing.
Not this year.
The Ducks, who come to Stanford
Stadium at 1 p.m. tomorrow, have not
only been ranked in the top 20 this year
for the first time since 1970; they have
also pulled off upsets over traditional
powerhouses Washington and USC.
Oregon, 4-2 overall, is third in the Pacific
10 Conference with a 2-1 league record.
Seventh-place Stanford has a 1-2 con
ference record and is 2-4 overall after
winning its last two games, at Washing
ton State and San Diego State. The Cardi
nal offense scored 44 points in each con
test, despite the absence of 1986 Pac-10
Offensive Player of the Year Brad
Muster, who suffered a serious ankle
sprain on the first day of fall practice.
Muster, who has compiled 280 yards
rushing, 204 yards receiving and five
touchdowns against Oregon the last two
years, practiced all week and will play
against the Ducks tomorrow, according
to the Stanford coaching staff.

tempts. Serving primarily as a pooch
punter this year, Sweeney missed his
only field goal attempt of the season in
Stanford's first game at Washington.
"He hates to take my job because I got
hurt," Hopkins said. "But he's been
ready, he's been practicing. He didn't
back down at all. I think he'll do fine."
Linebacker Kurt Colehower is the only
other Cardinal player listed as doubtful
for tomorrow's game. The senior, who
has 38 tackles to his credit, sprained an
ankle against San Diego State and may sit
out the Oregon contest. That's bad news
for a defense that surrendered 536 yards
through the air to San Diego State quar
terback Todd Santos last week.

an aggressive style of play," Stanford

If it is to heat Oregon tomorrow at Stanford Stadium, the Cardinal will need more big defensive plays like this sack of San
Diego State quarterback Todd Santos last week by Kevin Richardson (46). In six games this season, the Cardinal defense has
allowed an average of 30.3 points per game.
Coach Jack Elway said. "We're
not going to stop Oregon's of
fense cold. We've got to execute
and play with a whole lot of in
tensity."
The Stanford defense did set
up 24 points against San Diego
State, and collected seven sacks
against Santos.
Things don't get much easier
against the Ducks, however, who
showed that they can score in
beating Washington 29-22 and
USC 34-27. "I think we've
played some very good football,

certainly through our first four or
five games," Oregon Coach Rich
Brooks said.
But is Brooks a happy man?
Apparently not. "I'm pretty dis
couraged right now because 1
thought we had a chance to beat
UCLA and we blew it,"he said.
The Ducks really blew it.
Down by a score of just 17-7 at
the half last week, Oregon lost
41-10 in a contest that had been
billed as a showdown for the Pac
-10 Conference championship 41-
10.
Against UCLA, the Ducks,
who were second in the nation in
turnover margin the previous
week, turned the ball over seven
times in the contest on four

fumbles and three interceptions.
The Ducks also fell for the
Briuns' infamous "Bummeroo
ski" fake punt in the third quar
ter — a play in which blocking
back Mel Fair took the snap and
handed the ball forward to fresh
man linebacker Randy Austin,
who ran untouched down the left
sideline for a 38-yard touchdown.
"We had guys running all over
the field who didn't know where
the ball was," Brooks said.
"There were guys standing right
next to him, and he was hiding
the ball under his fanny. We were
fooled totally."
UCLA didn't fool the Oregon
defense, however. The Ducks
held the Briuns — a team that

clobbered the Cardinal 49-0 — to
just 280 yards in total offense,
while Oregon piled up 289 total
yards.
"Last year people lined up and
ran at will against us," Brooks
said. "This year they can't do
that."
The biggest surprise for the
surprising Ducks has been quar
terback Bill Musgrave, who is
fifth in the nation in passing effi
ciency and 14th in total offense,
with 223 yards per game. The
redshirt freshman has completed
63.3 percent of his passes for
1371 yards and II touchdowns on
the season.
"Musgrave is a real pleasant
surprise," Brooks said. "We

knew we had a good thing, hut
we weren't expecting what he's
done."
"He's executing the offense
well," Elway said. "He's not
strong-armed, hut he's extremely
accurate. He also has outstand
ing receivers and running hacks
as well."
One of Oregon's most out
standing receivers, senior split
end J.J. Birden, who is averaging
22.1 yards per catch, may miss
tomorrow's matchup, however.
Birden sprained an ankle against
UCLA and spent the early part of
the week on crutches.
Leading rusher Derek Loville
is also not completely healthy,
still hampered by a toe injury suf

fered in Oregon's opener against
Colorado. The sophomore tail
back has 250 yards on 73 carries
and three touchdowns in just
three games. Sophomore full
back Latin Berry has 194 yards
on 54 carries. •>
Another sophomore, split end
Terry Obee, is Oregon's leading
receiver with 18 catches for 347
yards.
"Our philosophy is not to look
at any team as an underdog,"
Stanford defensive tackle Sean
Scheller said. "We prefer to be in
an underdog position. Oregon
beat two traditionally good
teams, so there's no doubt we'll
prepare for them like any other
team."
