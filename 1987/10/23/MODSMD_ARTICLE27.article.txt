## Muster expected to play; Hopkins out Card, 2-4, looks to cook Ducks' goose 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
In the past, Oregon has been a school
most teams look forward to playing.
Not this year.
The Ducks, who come to Stanford
Stadium at 1 p.m. tomorrow, have not
only been ranked in the top 20 this year
for the first time since 1970; they have
also pulled off upsets over traditional
powerhouses Washington and USC.
Oregon, 4-2 overall, is third in the Pacific
10 Conference with a 2-1 league record.
Seventh-place Stanford has a 1-2 con
ference record and is 2-4 overall after
winning its last two games, at Washing
ton State and San Diego State. The Cardi
nal offense scored 44 points in each con
test, despite the absence of 1986 Pac-10
Offensive Player of the Year Brad
Muster, who suffered a serious ankle
sprain on the first day of fall practice.
Muster, who has compiled 280 yards
rushing, 204 yards receiving and five
touchdowns against Oregon the last two
years, practiced all week and will play
against the Ducks tomorrow, according
to the Stanford coaching staff.
Freshman kicker John Hopkins will not
play, however. Hopkins, who kicked six
field goals in Stanford's two wins the last
two weeks and is 8-for-l 1 in field goal at
tempts this season, injured himself in
practice Tuesday when someone attempt
ing to block a kick came down on Hop
kins' left knee, twisting it.
The injury, diagnosed as a sprained
medial colateral ligament, will keep the
left-footed kicker out of action from four
to six weeks.

"I was off to a good start," Hopkins
said. "It's just something I've got to ac
cept."
"I'm kind of concerned because it's a
knee injury, and they sometimes tend to
be recurring. I can handle it now, but if it
recurred, it would be hard to handle,"
said Hopkins, who is also a high jumper
on the Stanford track team.
Senior kicker David Sweeney, who,
ironically, is from the same high school in
Dallas that Hopkins attended, will take
over the kicking duties. Sweeney was the
starting kicker the past two years before
losing the job to Hopkins in the second
game of this season.
Sweeney had an excellent sophomore
year, hitting 12-of-18 field goals including
a 50-yarder, but had a dismal time last
season, connecting on just 4 of 15 at
tempts. Serving primarily as a pooch
punter this year, Sweeney missed his
only field goal attempt of the season in
Stanford's first game at Washington.
"He hates to take my job because I got
hurt," Hopkins said. "But he's been
ready, he's been practicing. He didn't
back down at all. I think he'll do fine."
Linebacker Kurt Colehower is the only
other Cardinal player listed as doubtful
for tomorrow's game. The senior, who
has 38 tackles to his credit, sprained an
ankle against San Diego State and may sit
out the Oregon contest. That's bad news
for a defense that surrendered 536 yards
through the air to San Diego State quar
terback Todd Santos last week.
"On defense we've got to get back to
an aggressive style of play," Stanford

If it is to heat Oregon tomorrow at Stanford Stadium, the Cardinal will need more big defensive plays like this sack of San
Diego State quarterback Todd Santos last week by Kevin Richardson (46). In six games this season, the Cardinal defense has
allowed an average of 30.3 points per game.
