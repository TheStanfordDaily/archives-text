# Card battles for NCAA bid

The Stanford men's soccer team faces a pivotal
game today against San Diego State at MaJoney
Field.
Coming off a three-game winless streak that in
cluded losses to San Jose State and Simon Fraser
and a tie with Pennsylvania, the Cardinal must beat
the Aztecs to keep its playoff chances alive,
r Stanford, 7-6-3 on the season and 2-1 in Pacific
$occer Conference play, will have its hands (or
feet, as the case may be) full against No. 15 San
Diego State. The game kicks off at 3 p.m.
"This is a must game as far as the season and
postseason chances go," Stanford Coach Sam
Koch said.
Although the Cardinal has not won a game since
it won the ATT/Pacific West Tournament Oct. 11,
the squad feels it has a legitimate chance of defeat
ing the Aztecs.
In its game against Pennsylvania last Sunday,
Stanford played one of its best first halves of the
season. In addition, while it took the squad the
entire first period to warm up in its game with
Simon Fraser last Saturday, the Cardinal executed
very well in the second half of the contest.
Those games and several other contests this
season, have confirmed Stanford's tendency to play
to the level of its competition. Against quality oppo
nents, the Cardinal has performed at a high level of
play. But against lesser opponents like San Jose
State, Stanford tends to slack off.
Earlier this season the Cardinal defeated three
nationally ranked squads (San Francisco, Fresno
State and UCLA), shutting out two of the three
teams. Stanford also defeated previously unbeaten
Washington.
To defeat San Diego State, Stanford must contain
several outstanding Aztec forwards, led by junior
Ail-American Kyle Whittemore
and freshman standout Eric
Wynalda. According to Koch,
Stanford will attempt to neutral
ize Wittemore, San Diego State s
target man, and force the Aztecs
to play a different game.
"But we're not going to make
the game revolve around San
Diego," Koch said. "We want
them to worry about us."
And the Aztecs should worry.
Not only has the Cardinal
defeated the No. 2 (San Fran
cisco) and No. 4 (Fresno State)
squads in the nation this season,
but Stanford has outscored its
opponents 20-15.
In addition, for the first time
this year the Cardinal is
relatively healthy. Fullbacks Tim
Westergren and David Thorpe
and midfielder Chris Dechet have
all missed practices this week,
but should see action in today's
game.
Injuries have played a key role
in a number of the Cardinal's
losses this season. The absence
of Westergren, co-captain Brian
Mahaffey and fullback Jim Kil-
Ifoil weakened the squad in its
matches against Simon Fraser
and Pennsylvania.
Saturday, Stanford, its ranks
expanded with the addition of a
few junior varsity players, will
face a Stanford soccer alumni
team. The fourth annual game
begins at 10 a.m. at Maloney
Field.
