# Spikers seek to extend winning streak
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's volleyball team
will take its show on the road this
weekend and see how it plays in the
Pacific Northwest. Riding an 1 l-match
winning streak (the longest in Pacific 10
history), the spikers take on Washington
in Seattle tonight and move on to Pullman
for a match against Washington State to
morrow .
Stanford comes into both matches as a
big favorite. The Cardinal, 16-3 overall, is
ranked fifth in the country and leads the
Pac-10 Conference with an 8-1 record.
The 1 l-match winning streak is only
three short of the school record of 14, set
in 1985, and the Cardinal is also riding an
eight-match winning streak in Pac-10
play. "1 think desire is definitely a part of
it,"' said senior setter Wendi Rush, ex
plaining the teams' success over the past
month.
"Attitude-wise, everyone wants to
win," she added. "That's making the dif
ference."
While Stanford has never lost to either
the Huskies or the Cougars in eight previ
ous meetings, this year is a whole differ
ent story. All the teams in the Pac-10 ap
pear to be stronger than last year.
Washington and Washington State
"are much better than they were last
year," Rush said.
Washington is the stronger of the Car
dinal's two adversaries this weekend.
The Huskies are not nationally ranked,
but they have posted a 16-6 mark coming
into the contest.
That record is somewhat deceiving,
however, as the Huskies have compiled a

13-0 non-conference record against
mostly weaker teams (there are few
strong teams in the Northwest other than
Washington. Oregon and Portland State,
and PSU is only a Division II team).
In competitive Pac-10 play the Huskies
have posted a 3-6 mark on the season,
good for a tie with Arizona State for
seventh place in the conference.
Washington lost only two players from
a team that qualified for the NCAA
playoffs last year, but they have not fared
so well this season due to an overall im
provement in the play of conference
teams. At present, six Pac-10 teams are
ranked among the top 21 teams in the
country.
The top player for the Huskies this
year is junior middle blocker Laurie W et
zel. The Washington native leads the
team in most statistical categories and is
second in the league with an average of
4.31 kills per game.
Wetzel is also ranked fifth in the Pac-10
in digs (3.10 per game), and eighth in ser
vice aces. In addition, she set a Pac-10
record with 41 kills in a match against
ASU two weeks ago.
Wetzel is not the entire Washington at
tack. however. Her counterpart at middle
blocker, Jackie Auzias de Turenne, has
accumulated 88 blocks, good for ninth in
the league.
The Huskies also have Pam Andrus,
Kayley Grim. Lisa McCammond and
Gail Thorpe, a freshman from Mountain
View, on the outside.
The gap at setter has also been filled
well, as Hawaii transfer Melinda Becken
hauer has assumed the starting spot. Be-


Beruamin Tong/Daily file
Lara Asper (22) and Amy Hayes (6) should help dig the Cardinal to
victory this weekend in games at Washington and W ashington State.
ckenhauer played for Los Altos
High School, graduating in 1984
after leading that team to two
league titles and two berths in the
state tournament.
She has the genes to be a star.
Her younger sister turned down a
scholarship from UCLA to walk
on at two-time defending national
champion Pacific, where she will
likely start next year. The
younger Beckenhauer is averag

ing 10.75 assists per game so far
this season.
The Cougars of Washington
State have not been so successful
this year. They are off to an 11-13
start but, again, their non-league
opponents have not provided
much competition. In Pac-10
play, the Cougars have only one
win, over Oregon State. Their 1-8
record places them all alone in
ninth place in the conference.
The only bright light for the
Cougars this year has been the
play of senior Laurie Van Diest.
She ranks in the top 10 in the
Pac-10 in both blocking and kills
average.

The play of outside hitter
Susan Guest and setter Beth
Welch, a pair of freshmen, has
given cause for a little glee in Pul
lman, but things likely won't be
going the Cougars' way often
over the weekend.
The Cardinal, on the other
hand, has been winning with a
very well-balanced attack during
its four-week winning streak.
The key to the Cardinal offense
has been the play of setter Rush.
She was named the Pac-10 Player
of the Week last week for her
performance against Arizona and
Arizona State.
Rush led the team with 11

blocks, 69 assists and 25 digs in
the two matches. She now has
217 digs this year, leading the
Cardinal, and has reached the
800 mark in assists. The senior
placed the credit for the award
with the team, however, despite
her impressive performance.
"It just goes to show how well
our team's been playing," she
said. "It's a team effort out
there."
Rush has received a lot of help
from her senior classmates so far
this year in carrying the Cardinal
to its great start. Middle blocker
Nancy Reno and outside hitter
Teresa Smith are both making

the best of their last year at Stan
ford.
Reno is the top blocker, with
78, while Rush is third with 45.
Reno and Smith are also running
third and fourth, respectively, on
the dig ladder, and Smith has a
team-high 36 aces after a four-ace
performance in a four-game win
over San Jose State Tuesday.
The Cardinal also got some
good news on Wednesday, when
USC upset UCLA at Pauley
Pavilion. The Bruin loss dropped
them into a second-place tie with
Oregon at 7-2.
"We're in the driver's seat,"
said Rush, who likes the way the

team is heading.
"We are just consistently get
ting stronger."
