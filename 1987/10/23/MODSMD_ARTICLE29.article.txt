# Spikers seek to extend winning streak
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's volleyball team
will take its show on the road this
weekend and see how it plays in the
Pacific Northwest. Riding an 1 l-match
winning streak (the longest in Pacific 10
history), the spikers take on Washington
in Seattle tonight and move on to Pullman
for a match against Washington State to
morrow .
Stanford comes into both matches as a
big favorite. The Cardinal, 16-3 overall, is
ranked fifth in the country and leads the
Pac-10 Conference with an 8-1 record.
The 1 l-match winning streak is only
three short of the school record of 14, set
in 1985, and the Cardinal is also riding an
eight-match winning streak in Pac-10
play. "1 think desire is definitely a part of
it,"' said senior setter Wendi Rush, ex
plaining the teams' success over the past
month.
"Attitude-wise, everyone wants to
win," she added. "That's making the dif
ference."
While Stanford has never lost to either
the Huskies or the Cougars in eight previ
ous meetings, this year is a whole differ
ent story. All the teams in the Pac-10 ap
pear to be stronger than last year.
Washington and Washington State
"are much better than they were last
year," Rush said.
Washington is the stronger of the Car
dinal's two adversaries this weekend.
The Huskies are not nationally ranked,
but they have posted a 16-6 mark coming
into the contest.
That record is somewhat deceiving,
however, as the Huskies have compiled a

13-0 non-conference record against
mostly weaker teams (there are few
strong teams in the Northwest other than
Washington. Oregon and Portland State,
and PSU is only a Division II team).
In competitive Pac-10 play the Huskies
have posted a 3-6 mark on the season,
good for a tie with Arizona State for
seventh place in the conference.
Washington lost only two players from
a team that qualified for the NCAA
playoffs last year, but they have not fared
so well this season due to an overall im
provement in the play of conference
teams. At present, six Pac-10 teams are
ranked among the top 21 teams in the
country.
The top player for the Huskies this
year is junior middle blocker Laurie W et
zel. The Washington native leads the
team in most statistical categories and is
second in the league with an average of
4.31 kills per game.
Wetzel is also ranked fifth in the Pac-10
in digs (3.10 per game), and eighth in ser
vice aces. In addition, she set a Pac-10
record with 41 kills in a match against
ASU two weeks ago.
Wetzel is not the entire Washington at
tack. however. Her counterpart at middle
blocker, Jackie Auzias de Turenne, has
accumulated 88 blocks, good for ninth in
the league.
The Huskies also have Pam Andrus,
Kayley Grim. Lisa McCammond and
Gail Thorpe, a freshman from Mountain
View, on the outside.
The gap at setter has also been filled
well, as Hawaii transfer Melinda Becken
hauer has assumed the starting spot. Be-
