# Business school tops grad survey
## 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business topped a list of the na
tion's premier business schools
in a survey of graduate schools
conducted by U.S. News &
World Report.
The survey, which will appear
in the Nov. 2 issue of the maga
zine, also ranked Stanford third
in engineering, tied for fourth in
law and seventh in medicine.
Deans from 232 business
schools accredited or nationally
recognized for excellence were
asked to select the 10 schools of
fering the best graduate programs
in business in the country. Stan
ford was selected by 86.3 percent
of the deans, followed by Har
vard with 80.9 percent and the
University of Pennsylvania with
79.4 percent.
Despite the top ranking,
Graduate School of Business
Dean Robert Jaedicke told the
University News Service that
surveys like this are a
"disservice to prospective stu
dents." Jaedicke was unavailable

for further comment yesterday.
"Rankings are something we
don't put too much emphasis on
here at the business school,"
said Rich Kurovsky, director of
News and Publications at the
Business School.
Kurovsky said that ratings
make business schools seem very
competitive when in fact they are
quite cooperative with one an
other.
He also warned that ratings of
ten become the leading indicator
of the quality of a school. Ratings
"obscure the differences" be
tween schools, causing students
to assume that all schools ap
proach management education
and research the same way, ac
cording to Kurovsky.
The Stanford Graduate School
of Business, the most selective
business school in the nation, last
year accepted only 318 out of
4217 applicants. Kurovsky said
he did not know whether the sur
vey will result in more appli
cants. He stressed, however,
that even if more students apply,
an increase in admissions is not
likely.
He also said the survey will not
necessarily affect fund raising.
Last year, the Business School
received over $13.5 million in
contributions, the largest total
the school has ever received.
"Things have been going ex
traordinary well without the ben
efit of ranking," Kurovsky said.
The deans who participated in

the survey were requested to
consider the quality of faculty,
strength of the curriculum and
preparation for professional life
in evaluating nationwide
graduate programs in business.
According to the article, Stan
ford excels in its "balance" and
"breadth" of education. Course
offerings that combine theory
with practice balance both the
historical, case-study method
and the quantitative, more scien
tific approach, the article said.
Students and teachers at the
school agreed with the survey's
evaluation of the program's
strengths.

Martha Andrews, a second
year student at the Business
School, said the "skills and tools
in the quantitative focus are
really helpful."
Economics Prof. David Kreps
of the Business School said that
Stanford balances research and
teaching very well.
Kreps also said that Stanford
admits "not necessarily the most
academically talented, but rea
sonably (experienced), ambi
tious, aggressive people."
"People bring about a lot of
valuable experience into the
classroom," added Boyd Ander
son, also a second-year student.
