# Stanford drops to No. 3
## Water polo tries to rebound 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
With only nine games left until the
NCAA Championships Nov. 27-29 in
Long Beach, the slump has to end.
After winning 12 of its first 13 games,
the Stanford water polo team has hit a
dry spell, winning only two of its last
five games.
The trouble began Oct. 3, when a let
hargic Cardinal offense never got in
gear in a 7-4 loss to UCLA.
In its most recent game, against USC
last Saturday, the Stanford offense had
a new problem — an inability to finish
its offensive charges. The result was a
maddening 6-4 loss. The Cardinal was
left only with the consolation that it
should have won.
Today at 3 p.m. at deGuerre Pool.
No. 3 Stanford (13-4) hosts No. 6 Long
Beach State (12-6) in what both sides
consider a pivotal game.
The Cardinal is looking to regain the
scoring prowess it showed early in the
schedule, while the 49ers are hoping to
upset Stanford and afTirm themselves
among the nation s top NCAA con
tenders.
"Tomorrow's a really big game for
us, and everybody's really psyched for
it," senior Matt Tingler said. "This is
the most important game of our season:
it's the turning point. We have to win
the rest of our games if we want to stay
(near the top of the national rank

ings)."
"For where we are at this point in
the season, every game is extremely
important," Long Beach State Coach
Ken Lindgren said. "You always look
forward to playing the best teams and
hope that your players can make a
good account of themselves."
The 49ers are similar to the Cardinal
in that while most of their scoring has
come from the team's two-meter man,
6-foot-8 Kyle Kopp, Long Beach State
also boasts very capable wing players
and a quick counterattack.

l We have to capitalize
on the opportunities we
create.'

Stanford's defense, however, is well
equipped for an offense that keys on
play in front of the cage.
Stopping the 49er offense is not the
Cardinal's primary concern, however.
The defense has been more than hold
ing its own in recent matches. Rather,
the emphasis will be on converting of
fensive opportunities into goals.
"We did things right, it was really
frustrating for us ... " Tingler said of

last week's loss to USC. "We have to
capitalize on the opportunities we
create."
Against California two weeks ago,
Stanford failed to score on a penalty
shot and on both of its 6-on-5 advan
tages. Against the Trojans, it converted
on only one of five 6-on-5 advantages.
Lindgren expects a difficult match,
giving the defending national cham
pions credit in many areas.
"Stanford's an excellent team and
we'll have to play one of our very best
games to beat them," he said.
"They're a tough team to play. They're
very mobile, they've got a good coun
terattack. . . . We'll have to play an
overall excellent match."
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti
said that if the Cardinal plays its best it
should win. but cautioned that with the
49ers, no match, no matter how well
played, is a sure Stanford victory.
"Long Beach has always played us
tough up here," Dettamanti said.
"Every year, no matter how good they
are, no matter how bad they are, it's al
ways a tough match."
Regardless of Long Beach State's
play, the Cardinal's biggest enemy to
morrow may be itself. Dettamanti has
been stressing quality drives and
quality shots during this week's
practices.

After a frustrating loss to USC last Saturday, Stanford will look to seniors like (>rant
Stanley for leadership on offense today against long Beach State.
beating them as 1 am about our
play," he said. "We have to start
scoring more goals."
Stanford has met the 49ers
once before this season, in Long
Beach Sept. 19, with the Cardinal
pulling out a 9-7 victory.
A fact that may play a role in
the outcome of today's game is
that Long Beach has two more
matches over the weekend while
this is Stanford's only game this
weekend. The 49ers travels to
Stockton tomorrow to play
Pacific and then must play at
Fresno State Sunday.
These two games are Pacific
Coast Conference confrontations
for Long Beach, but Lindgren
said that while conference play is
important, today's match is just
as important as the others be
cause the competition will be sig
nificantly better.
Senior Erich Fischer continues
to lead the Cardinal scoring at
tack with 37 goals. The First
Team All-American is followed
by juniors Jeff Oeding and
Andrew Lawson, who have
scored 16 and 14 goals,
respectively. All-American
Tingler and classmate Grant
Stanley have each scored 13.
