# Field hockey set for Cal tourney
## 
### Matthew Bodman Editorial staff 
An 8-3 overall record, a 5-0
Northern Pacific Conference
record and a four-game winning
streak would satisfy most college
field hockey teams.
Not the Stanford field hockey
team.
Despite its No. 12 ranking and
recent wins, the Cardinal wants
to raise its level of play a notch
this weekend. With only three
conference left to play,
Stanford is lookirtg to this
weekend's California Invitational
in Berkeley as a step toward the
NCAA Championships in No
vember.
"We have not been playing to
potential," junior Wanda Kay
Key said. ".We think this
weekend we will start uoing up
(in quality of play). We have
been winning, but we haven't
been happy with our play."
In the three-day tournament,
Stanford faces NorPac rival San
Jose State today. Simon Fraser
tomorrow and either Pacific or

Chico State Sunday.
The three games will not count
in the NorPac standings, but will
affect national rankings. $ince
the games will be played on Cali
fornia's artificial turf field, each
game will have an added bit of
unpredictability.
"They are all going to be .tough
games," Key said. "We are
taking each game one at a'time.
Since field hockey games are
usually so low-scoring and the
game is a lot faster on Astro Turf,
every game is going to be espe
cially difficult."
The NorPac conference win
ner is automatically invited to the
NCAAs. Last season, the Cardi
nal qualified for the tournament,
but lost to Northwestern 3-0 in
the first round. This year, with
league games only against teams
Stanford has already beaten
remaining, the Cardinal is in the
driver's seat.
"I think we are going to use
our opportunity on Astro Turf to
get our game plan fine-tuned,"
junior co-captain Alison Smith
said.
