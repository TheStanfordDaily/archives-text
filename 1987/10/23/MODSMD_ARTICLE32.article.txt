ST. LOUIS (AP) â€” Curt
Ford's two-run single and a lucky
bounce broke open a scoreless
game in the sixth inning and the
St. Louis Cardinals bounced
back with a three-game sweep,
beatinp the Minnesota Twins 4-2
last night for a 3-2 lead in the
World Series.
Danny Cox shut out Minnesota
on three hits for seven innings
and St. Louis' speed pulled the
Twins apart at the seams. The
Cardinals stole five bases, tying a
record last accomplished in 1907,
and three of those runners
scored.
Game 6 was scheduled for Sat
urday in the Metrodome, where
Minnesota romped in the first
two games. St. Louis' John
Tudor, who won the third game,
will oppose Les Straker.
Cox, whose Game 7 shutout in
the NL playoffs put the Cardinals
into the World Series, outdueled
Bert Blyleven, who took his first
loss in six postseason decisions.
It was a reversal of four days
ago, when Blyleven won as the
Twins shelled Cox.
This time. Cox struck out six
and walked three and was
removed in the eighth after al
lowing singles to Dan Gladden
and Greg Gagne, both of whom
scored.
Blyleven managed to stay out
of trouble until the sixth when St.
Louis manufactured three runs.
Vince Coleman led off with a
grounder to first baseman Kent
Hrbek that took a second hop

scooted off a seam and hand
cuffed Hrbek, whose shovel toss
to Blyleven was late. Ozzie
Smith followed with his fourth
bunt single of the year as
Blyleven fumbled the ball on the
third-base side.
After Tom Herr fouled off two
bunt attempts and fouled out,
Coleman and Smith executed a
double steal with Dan Driessen at
the plate. Twins catcher Tim
Laudner dropped the pitch and
did not make a throw. Coleman
later got his sixth steal of the Se
ries, one short of the Lou
Brock's Series record.
Driessen was intentionally
walked and Willie McGee was
called out on strikes on three
pitches before Ford lined a sharp
single to center. Jose Oquendo
then hit a chopper that shortstop
Greg Gagne misplayed for an er
ror that allowed Driessen to
score.
The Cardinals made it 4-0 in
the seventh when Coleman drew
a one-out walk from Keith Ather
ton, was balked to second, and
stole third. Jeff Reardon relieved
and Coleman scored on Smith's
single off second baseman Steve
Lombardozzi's glove. Smith fol
lowed with his second steal,
giving the Cardinals four in the
game and an 8-3 edge in the Se
ries.
The Twins scored their two
runs in the eighth as Gladden and
Gagne led off with singles and
Cox got Kirby Puckett on a
fly ball to center.
