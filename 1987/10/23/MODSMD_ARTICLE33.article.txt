# Rejuvenated Card tours Midwest
## 
### Robert Pardington Staff writer 
It's Colorado or bust for the Stanford
women's soccer team.
The 3-6-3 Cardinal plays three games
in three days on a Midwest road trip
that begins with a match at Northern
Colorado tonight.
The Cardinal visits second-ranked
Colorado College on Saturday and
wraps it up with a game at George
Washington Sunday.
For several weeks, the players have
been looking to these games as a chal
lenge and a chance to prove them
selves.
"We want to win some games before
we go out to Colorado," junior
defender Christy McDevitt said last
week. "Colorado College is a tough
team. We're all anticipating that
game."
Stanford has been improving. The

team has won two out of its last three
games and tied the other, against Chico
State last Sunday. Good conditioning
has enabled the Cardinal to out-hustle
its opponents.
"They just plain beat us to the ball,"
Chico State Coach Bob Russ said.
One reason for Stanford's resur
gence is a balanced scoring attack.
Sophomore forward Tonya Antonucci
still leads the team in scoring with three
goals. Freshman forward Jenny
Rowland and senior midfielder Amy
Geisse have both scored two goals, and
six players have tallied once each.
Other strengths of the squad include
the midfield, where Geisse and fresh
man halfback Denise Denney control
the action. Geisse is an extraordinary
passer and Denney has good heading
and trapping skills.
The defense is led by McDevitt,
whose agressive style makes her con
sistently one of the Cardinal's top

performers. Recently, freshman full
back Anne Fusch has been impressive.
Pusch had an assist against Portland
last Friday.
Sophomore Vija Brookshire and
freshman Elise Edwards are equally
strong in goal for the Cardinal. Each
has great hands and wide range. Ed
wards has great kicking ability and is
able to place the ball past midfield on
goal kicks. Brookshire has allowed
only 0.71 goals per game, compared to
a highly respectable 1.33 for Edwards.
I ne high altitude of the Rockies is a
potential problem for Stanford, as is
the fatigue they will likely experience
playing three games in one weekend.
But the Cardinal is well-trained and
healthy now that several players have
recovered from the flu and virus that
afflicted the squad early in the season.
Stanford returns home to host St.
Mary's Wednesday and Texas A&M
next Saturday.
