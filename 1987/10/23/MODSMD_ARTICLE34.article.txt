# The 						Tree tries to better Oski, joins Greek ranks
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily proudly
presents the second installment
of the Guest Mascot contest.
Two weeks ago we brought you
wayward California mascot Oski
the Bear, currently in self
imposed exile. Today we bring
you the Tree.
The Tree doesn't feel insecure
about following in the footsteps
of his Berkeley counterpart.
" It's an age before beauty type
of thing,'' the Tree said.
The leafed mascot had a
chance to see his furry friend
recently ."The last time 1 saw
him was about four days ago,"
the Tree said. "He's pretty much
mellowed out — he's a pretty
nice person (bear?). It's best to
stay downwind of him, though.''
It would be almost impossible
for anyone to do worse than

Cal's former figurehead, who
correctly picked only four out of
10 contests, but the Tree seems
determined to try, with picks
such as Harvard MV 2 /2g, Prince
ton MGH.
"I'm basically saying it will be
0-0. It's just a geeky way of
saying it — which is pretty fit
ting, considering those schools
were number two and three [in a
recent U.S. News & World
Report rating of American uni
versities]."
The notorious Tree had no
hesitation about picking Notre
Dame to crush USC. "USC is
the only thing I hate about Cali
fornia," he said.'T plan on get
ting arrested for disorderly con
duct at the USC game — Andy
Geiger's going to love that. I'll
keep my pants on."
