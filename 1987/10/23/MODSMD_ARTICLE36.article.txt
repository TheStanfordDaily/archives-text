Japan's high productivity was a
strong "competitive weapon" during
the early 1980s, but the country didn't
fully realize its productive potential un
til the middle of the decade, according
to George Stalk, vice president of the
Boston Consulting Group (BCG).
"They (the Japanese companies) had
no true sense of difference of quality or
productivity. They didn't exercise vari
ety," Stalk said in a lunchtime speeh
yesterday at the Graduate School of
Business.
In 1985, Stalk wrote "Kaisha: The
Japanese Corporation," an account of
how Japanese companies compete in
the world market. The book was a
product of the five years he spent in the
BCG's Tokyo office.
Stalk said that around 1984, Japan
began to appreciate its potential for in
dustrial production and placed greater
emphasis on expanding its variety and
speed of production, resulting in a
faster response to improved technol
ogy-
Another Japanese strategy is to fight
complexity, according to Stalk. He

Increased variety can
be used as a weapon if a
company chooses to
flood the market and
destroy the competition.

cited as an example the Toyota auto
mobile company, which simplified its
processes and lowered its cost of vari
ety.
In some cases, increased variety can
be used as a weapon if a company
chooses to flood the market and
destroy the competition. Stalk said.
Stalk explained how American com
panies approach the BCG to learn how
to conduct business with Japan. These
companies want to determine how
Japanese companies would react to
certain business ventures.
One example given by Stalk was that
of the Sony electronics company, that
introduced the compact disc into the

market in 1982. Instead of researching
the product extensively, it introduced
two expensive versions, as well as two
that were less expensive, to test the
market. Sony also updated the models
frequently.
Stalk said that American business
men were pleased to hear that Japan s
business success is not "mystique or
culture," but a strategy that can be ap
plied in the Western world.
After the formal talk and slide show.
Stalk, talking about "Kaisha," admit
ted that it is essentially a "cult book"
that received wide distribution in cor
porate America. He said his publishing
company was to blame for the book's
lack of popularity among the general
public.
In his presentation, Stalk showed
various slides conveying Japan's
manufacturing success. A 1987 produc
tivity comparison chart showed that
Japan is 50 percent more productive
than either the United States or West
Germany.
Stalk's speech was one of a series of
talks sponsored by the student-run
Manufacturing Club and the Asia
Trade Consortium.
