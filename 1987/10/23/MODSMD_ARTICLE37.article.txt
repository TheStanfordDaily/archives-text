# Faiths explore variations

Representatives from eight different campus reli
gious organizations answered questions about their
faiths Toyon Hall last night.
Thirty-five students and visitors of all ages split
into groups and brainstormed questions for a nine
member panel.
Questions ranged from "What is Bahai?" to
"Do Buddhists believe in God?" to "Is baptism ne
cessary for salvation?"
The panel also discussed Islamic prayer, kosher
food, the authority of the pope, sexual mores and
Buddhist holidays.
Panel questions revealed that Buddists "hope to
find a truer, more harmonious life" in this world
and that Baha'is believe in"the oneness of reli
gion."
Dean of the Chapel Robert Gregg described the
evening as "an exercise in openness to religious

differences." He said it was a chance for people
"to ask questions they always wanted to ask but
didn't quite know how."
Gregg said that the idea for the discussion
originated from observations he made during Ori
entation Week. Gregg said that at Stanford, "Some
tensions do grow up about differing religious tradi
tions." He said he hoped the discussion would
calm such tensions and prevent them from peaking
during the holiday season.
The panel consisted of representatives of eight
different faiths. The panel included Rabbi Ari Car
tun (Judaism), Hussein Al-Hussein (Islam), Glenn
Kameda (Buddhism), Scott Bowers and Vida
Bertrand (Bahai), Gerald Jones (Mormonism) and
Herb Schmidt (Lutheran).
In addition, Nancy Greenfield discussed Cat
holicism and Diane Warren responded to questions
about her Christian Bible study, Rejoyce in Jesus.
