# Kennedy seeks Bay Area research agency
## 
### Lakshmi Rajan 
University President Donald
Kennedy suggested in a Los An
geles speech Tuesday the possi
bility of a regional agency to
oversee expansion of university
science research in the Bay Area.
Kennedy's suggestion fol
lowed months of controversy
over the proposed expansion of
science facilities at UC-
Berkeley, the University of San
Francisco and Stanford.
According to Bob Freelen,
Stanford vice president for
Public Affairs, these Bay Area
universities are all having
"serious problems getting
(science research) buildings ap

proved and active" because of
protests by environmentalists
and animal rights activists.
He said that the protest groups
do not have confidence in the
ability of universities to conduct
scientific research safely.
Freelen stressed that Ken
nedy's suggestion is not a formal
proposal. "This is the start of a
dialogue on how to resolve a dif
ficult set of issues that threatens
research and teaching at three of
the country's finest research uni
versities," he said.
According to Freelen, "No
one has called a congressman"
or taken any steps toward actu
ally creating an agency to over
see scientific research at Bay

Area universities.
Freelen said that even the es
tablishment of such an agency
may not solve the problem, but
the dialogue that Kennedy has
stimulated with his suggestion
may eventually provide a solu
tion.
Recently, the construction of
two Stanford facilities has been
delayed by environmentalists
and animal rights groups. Con
struction of the first, the $17-
million Research Animal Facility
11, was delayed this summer
when the Palo Alto Humane So
ciety convinced the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors to
require that Stanford commission
an environmental impact report

on the proposed facility.
The construction of the second
facility, a $33-million addition to
the Herrin biological sciences
building, has been delayed due to
protest by the Silicon Valley
Toxics Coalition, a local environ
mental group. The coalition's ef
forts to pressure Stanford into
conducting an environmental im
pact report for the proposed fa
cility succeeded recently. Ken
nedy. who said Stanford wants to
avoid a lengthy legal battle,
agreed to commission the report,
although he said it is unneces
sary. The several-month delay
will increase project costs by ap
proximately 5750,000 to $1 mil
lion.

Ted Smith, spokesman for the
Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition,
said that biomedical research can
be hazardous because it involves
the use of toxic chemicals and ra
dioactive materials.
According to Smith, the re
quest for an environmental im
pact report is based on an
"ultimate right-to-know issue."
He said he believes that residents
should know what kinds of re
search go on in facilities in the
area.
Smith said he supports the idea
of an agency to oversee scientific
research provided that such an
agency would release complete
information on its research activ
ities.
