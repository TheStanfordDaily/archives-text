# Flo Mo rejects game monitors

### Kelly Brown 
The new Stanford Stadium alcohol
policy calling for student monitors to
supervise the student section at football
games is already coming under fire, as
some dormitories are refusing requests
from the Student Alcohol Task Force to
appoint monitors.
On Wednesday, students in Florence
Moore Hall decided not to appoint any
monitors. According to Paloma Resi
dent Assistant Dayna Bender, "If Stan
ford is trying to teach responsible drink
ing then they shouldn't advocate a
policy which makes one person respon
sible for everyone else's drinking be
havior."
Steve Chaffee, a resident fellow for
Florence Moore West, voiced a similar
opinion. "Stanford is an educational in
stitution. The problem must be dealt
with through education, not police ac
tion," he said.

The task force established the new
policy last week. It calls for two types
of student monitors to patrol the stu
dent section in the stadium. One group
of M) ushers, to be selected from one or
two club sport teams, will roam the stu
dent section "reminding students of the
alcohol guidlines."
The other group of monitors will
come from within the dorms and frater
nities themselves. The task force asked
each dorm and fraternity to select one
member to monitor student behavior in
its section.
In addition, students who can prove
they are at least 21 years old will be
allowed to bring no more than one six
pack of beer into the stadium.
I he task force is made up of repre
sentatives of the ASSU, the Council of
Presidents, the Interfraternity Council,
Intersorority Council, and the Com
mitee on Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation (CAPFRI.

According to Tracy Schmidt, a mem
ber of CAPER. "Collective responsibil
ity has not been working. Had it been
working, we wouldn't have a prob
lem."
COP member Jim Durkin said that
the new measures are an effort "to let
the students govern themselves rather
than leaving it to professionals such as
the police."
While admitting that the monitors
have no real enforcement power,
Durkin said their primary role is to
identify groups that cause trouble, and
to stand up for students who may not
stand up for themselves.
Some dorm and fraternity representa
tives expressed displeasure with the
task force's recommendations. Chaffee
also said that even if every undergradu
ate attended the football game, they
would make up a very small percentage
of the total crowd. "Scape
goating is the word that keeps
coming to mind," he said.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
however, said, "Almost all prob
lems (with drinking in the
stadium) are in the student sec
tion. We are not scapegoating."
Geiger emphasized that it was
up to students to eliminate their
own alcohol-related problems.
"The students are managing their
section. I'll handle the rest of the
stadium," Geiger said.
Kappa Alpha RA Rob Reid
criticized other aspects of the
task force's new policy. "The
new policy (of one six-pack per
person if 21 or older) does not

merit specific monitors. Even in
an upperclass dorm this amounts
to about one-and-a-half beers per
person."
"The University is treating
college students as elementary
kids. I think we deserve more
respect than that."
Schmidt said that the inclusion
of monitors in the new policy is
an "emergency measure" to deal
with a very serious problem. She
cited a loss of patience on the
part of the task force with the
student behavior in the stadium.
"The administration has been
bending over backward to make
this work."
Of student opposition to the
new policy, Schmidt responded,
"Good. Whether the students are
pleased or upset with the usher
ing, our objective is letting the
students know there is a problem
has been met."

they are at least 21 years old will be
allowed to bring no more than one six
pack of beer into the stadium.
I he task force is made up of repre
sentatives of the ASSU, the Council of
Presidents, the Interfraternity Council,
Intersorority Council, and the Com
mitee on Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation (CAPFRI.

According to Tracy Schmidt, a mem
ber of CAPER. "Collective responsibil
ity has not been working. Had it been
working, we wouldn't have a prob
lem."
COP member Jim Durkin said that
the new measures are an effort "to let
the students govern themselves rather
than leaving it to professionals such as
the police."
While admitting that the monitors
have no real enforcement power,
Durkin said their primary role is to
identify groups that cause trouble, and
to stand up for students who may not
stand up for themselves.
Some dorm and fraternity representa
tives expressed displeasure with the
task force's recommendations. Chaffee
also said that even if every undergradu
ate attended the football game, they
would make up a very small percentage
of the total crowd. "Scape
goating is the word that keeps
coming to mind," he said.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
however, said, "Almost all prob
lems (with drinking in the
stadium) are in the student sec
tion. We are not scapegoating."
Geiger emphasized that it was
up to students to eliminate their
own alcohol-related problems.
"The students are managing their
section. I'll handle the rest of the
stadium," Geiger said.
Kappa Alpha RA Rob Reid
criticized other aspects of the
task force's new policy. "The
new policy (of one six-pack per
person if 21 or older) does not

merit specific monitors. Even in
an upperclass dorm this amounts
to about one-and-a-half beers per
person."
"The University is treating
college students as elementary
kids. I think we deserve more
respect than that."
Schmidt said that the inclusion
of monitors in the new policy is
an "emergency measure" to deal
with a very serious problem. She
cited a loss of patience on the
part of the task force with the
student behavior in the stadium.
"The administration has been
bending over backward to make
this work."
Of student opposition to the
new policy, Schmidt responded,
"Good. Whether the students are
pleased or upset with the usher
ing, our objective is letting the
students know there is a problem
has been met."
