Americans must abandon the image
of the Soviet Union as an enemy of the
United States if the two countries are
to achieve necessary economic
cooperation, according to two visiting
Soviet economists who spoke on
campus yesterday.
Andrei Fonotov and Z.A. lakobash
villy, both from the Institute of Eco
nomics of the U.S.S R. Academy of
Sciences, stressed the need for U.S.-
Soviet cooperation in an informal
presentation to a group of 25 students

at Hurlburt House.
The two Soviets were in the Bay
Area to meet with economists at Stan
ford and UC-Berkeley, including
Ronald McKinnon and John Litwack
of the Stanford Economics Department
and Marvin Lieberman of the Graduate
School of Business.
Speaking partly in Einglish and partly
in Russian, Fonotov, through a trans
lator, discussed current developments
in Soviet politics, saying that there was
a "knowledge gap" between the

United States and the U.S.S.R.
"Your specialists have a very
weak image about the economics
and management in our
country," he said. "I am sure we
have more information about
your country." He stressed the
need for the U.S. and Soviet Un
ion to find common economic
ground and to create a
framework for formation of a
long-term economic strategy.
Citing the "problem with
quality in our products,"
Fonotov said that the export to
the Soviet Union of personal
computers and American tools
for quality control "wouldn't be
dangerous" to the U.S. economy

or to national security.
lakobashvilly traced the devel
opment of the Soviet economy
during this century, saying that
the country's persistent problem
has not been shortage of money,
but rather shortages of actual re
sources and products to buy.
At times in Soviet history,
"there was a lack of responsibil
ity to the consumer from the gov
ernment" and quantity of pro
duction was stressed instead of
quality, resulting in unsellable
goods, lakobashvilly said.
According to lakobashvilly,
technological developments in
the Soviet military industry do
not spin off to benefit civilians as
they do in the United States. He
said that in effect there is no
"military-industrial complex."
McKinnon called the meeting
"routine," but said that the new
soviet policy of " 'glasnost' has

opened up what Russians will do
and say."
Litwack said that the two
Soviets were "planting the seeds
of more academic contact be
tween Soviet and American
economists" and advocating
more trade and better economic
relations.
He added that new Soviet eco
nomic reform that will be imple
mented in 19K8 will allow for
more direct trade between the
two countries, which now deal
mainly through exchange agree
ments.
Many of the students at the
Hurlburt discussion understood
Russian and were able to ques
tion the speakers in their own
language. When a student asked
how it was possible to calculate
an inflation rate in a fixed-price
economy, Fonotov replied,
"Welcome to Moscow!"
