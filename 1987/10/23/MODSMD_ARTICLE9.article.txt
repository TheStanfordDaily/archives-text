Shultz nears agreement in Moscow
MOSCOW — With aides on both sides expressing growing
optimism, Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister hduard Shevardnadze virtually completed work yes
terday on a long-pending treaty to ban medium- and shorter
range nuclear missiles.
Although several issues, including the Soviet demand for on
site inspections in Western Europe, remain unsettled, a senior
U.S. official said he expected final agreement to be reached
before Shultz leaves Moscow Friday night.
The same official said that Shultz and Shevardnadze also
made enough progress on the far more complicated issue of re
ducing long-range strategic nuclear forces so that "the makings
of a package is there." The official said Shevardnadze indicated
that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had placed strategic arms
at the top of his agenda for his personal talks with Shultz Friday.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman and his Soviet
counterpart. Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov,
held a joint briefing for reporters, joking good-naturedly with
each other and seeming to compete for the most optimistic
assessment.
The official Soviet news agency Tass said it was the first joint
U.S.-Soviet briefing ever held in Moscow. The two men shared
a podium last month in Washington during similar Shultz-
Shevardnadze talks.
Senate Bork vote expected today
WASHINGTON — The Senate agreed last night to vote on
the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert Bork by no later
than 2 p.m. today, when it is all but certain to reject the nomina
tion after an extraordinarily bitter battle over the high court va
cancy.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) announced
the agreement after a day of maneuvering in which many of
Bork's Senate supporters joined with his opponents in seeking
to force the nomination to a vote today. Bork also intervened in
the process, signaling his desire to end the debate this week.
Senate Minority Whip Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) quoted Bork
as saying he had no desire to see the debate prolonged into next
week. Simpson, who said he visited Bork yesterday, also
quoted him as saying that he "deplores" advertising in some
states attacking senators who oppose the nomination.
The advertising campaign targeted at Bork opponents such as
Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.) began as the nomination fight
moved to the Senate floor, where the debate has been
dominated by charges and countercharges over pro- and anti-
Bork advertising.
Iran missile hits Kuwaiti terminal
KUWAIT — An Iranian missile exploded yesterday on
Kuwait's primary offshore oil-loading terminal in the Persian
Gulf, touching off a tire and injuring at least three persons.
The attack, the third in a week on the Al Ahmadi offshore ter
minal, raised tension sharply in the region. Kuwait's vital oil ter
minal now seems prey to attack at will by Iranian missiles.
The Kuwaiti government issued a "strong denunciation" of
the Iranian action. According to the Kuwait News Agency, the
charge d'affaires at the Iranian embassy was called in by the
foreign ministry and told that "the serious attack was unwar
ranted and had unveiled Iran's resolve to drag non-belligerent
countries of the region into this tragic war."
Thursday's attack took place just three days after U.S. war
ships destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the gulf in retaliation
for last week's Iranian missile attack against an American
registered tanker at the Kuwaiti terminal. Iran had vowed
repeatedly to retaliate for the American attack.
After the missile slammed into the Kuwaiti terminal,
Kuwait's defense minister. Sheik Salem al-Sabeh, was quoted
by the Kuwaiti News Agency as saying that his government was
"considering appropriate measures to deal with this type of
missile."
A senior Kuwaiti official said later that Kuwait, which has an
army of 10,(KK) men and a navy that consists of eight ships, was
in the process of obtaining sophisticated anti-missile defenses.
He gave no details but was quoted as predicting that Kuwait's
vulnerability to attack "would not continue."
Russian-American poet wins Nobel
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — The 1987 Nobel Prize for
Literature was awarded here yesterday to Joseph Brodsky, a
Russian-born poet and essayist who once served time in a
Siberian labor camp before being exiled and becoming an Amer
ican citizen in 1977.
At 47, Brodsky is one of the youngest writers ever to be given
the world's most prestigious literary award.
The citation by the Swedish Academy, which awards the an
nual prize, declared that he was selected "for all-embracing aut
horship, imbued with clarity of thought and poetic intensity."
In the Soviet Union, Brodsky's work was condemned as
"pornographic and anti-Soviet" by officials who refused to
publish it. Before being expelled from the Soviet Union,
Brodsky served 18 months in a Siberian prison camp for "social
parasitism." He had twice been put in mental institutions before
that.
In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov commented Thursday that "the tastes of the Nobel
committee are somewhat strange sometimes, but tastes do dif
fer." He added, however, that "I was informed by the Novy
Mir editorial staff that they had negotiations with the prize win
ner, and that they're going to publish his works."
Howard Beach trial reveals chase
NEW YORK — In a thick, monotone Queens accent, Robert
Riley described yesterday how he and his friends chased a black
man to the edge of the Belt Parkway in Howard Beach last De
cember, testifying that he heard a loud "thud" and saw the
man's body "go up a couple of feet in the air" when he was
struck by a passing car.
Riley, 18, the prosecution's chief witness at his friends' trial,
said he and four other white teen-agers had pursued Michael
Griffith to a roadside guard rail and that Griffith ran "straight
onto the Belt Parkway" where he was hit.
Riley said the chase began several blocks earlier when he and
his high-school friends confronted three black men outside a
pizzeria and ran after them, shouting, "Niggers, get the
(expletive) out of the neighborhood."
One of his friends, Jon Lester, was wielding a metal bat when
the chase stopped at the parkway, Riley said.
Riley, who is under 24-hour police guard, is being allowed to
plead guilty to a lesser charge of assault, which carries a maxi
mum seven-year prison term, in exchange for his cooperation.
The son of a city corrections officer, Riley originally was
charged with second-degree murder.

site inspections in Western Europe, remain unsettled, a senior
U.S. official said he expected final agreement to be reached
before Shultz leaves Moscow Friday night.
The same official said that Shultz and Shevardnadze also
made enough progress on the far more complicated issue of re
ducing long-range strategic nuclear forces so that "the makings
of a package is there." The official said Shevardnadze indicated
that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had placed strategic arms
at the top of his agenda for his personal talks with Shultz Friday.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman and his Soviet
counterpart. Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov,
held a joint briefing for reporters, joking good-naturedly with
each other and seeming to compete for the most optimistic
assessment.
The official Soviet news agency Tass said it was the first joint
U.S.-Soviet briefing ever held in Moscow. The two men shared
a podium last month in Washington during similar Shultz-
Shevardnadze talks.
Senate Bork vote expected today
WASHINGTON — The Senate agreed last night to vote on
the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert Bork by no later
than 2 p.m. today, when it is all but certain to reject the nomina
tion after an extraordinarily bitter battle over the high court va
cancy.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) announced
the agreement after a day of maneuvering in which many of
Bork's Senate supporters joined with his opponents in seeking
to force the nomination to a vote today. Bork also intervened in
the process, signaling his desire to end the debate this week.
Senate Minority Whip Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) quoted Bork
as saying he had no desire to see the debate prolonged into next
week. Simpson, who said he visited Bork yesterday, also
quoted him as saying that he "deplores" advertising in some
states attacking senators who oppose the nomination.
The advertising campaign targeted at Bork opponents such as
Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.) began as the nomination fight
moved to the Senate floor, where the debate has been
dominated by charges and countercharges over pro- and anti-
Bork advertising.
Iran missile hits Kuwaiti terminal
KUWAIT — An Iranian missile exploded yesterday on
Kuwait's primary offshore oil-loading terminal in the Persian
Gulf, touching off a tire and injuring at least three persons.
The attack, the third in a week on the Al Ahmadi offshore ter
minal, raised tension sharply in the region. Kuwait's vital oil ter
minal now seems prey to attack at will by Iranian missiles.
The Kuwaiti government issued a "strong denunciation" of
the Iranian action. According to the Kuwait News Agency, the
charge d'affaires at the Iranian embassy was called in by the
foreign ministry and told that "the serious attack was unwar
ranted and had unveiled Iran's resolve to drag non-belligerent
countries of the region into this tragic war."
Thursday's attack took place just three days after U.S. war
ships destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the gulf in retaliation
for last week's Iranian missile attack against an American
registered tanker at the Kuwaiti terminal. Iran had vowed
repeatedly to retaliate for the American attack.
After the missile slammed into the Kuwaiti terminal,
Kuwait's defense minister. Sheik Salem al-Sabeh, was quoted
by the Kuwaiti News Agency as saying that his government was
"considering appropriate measures to deal with this type of
missile."
A senior Kuwaiti official said later that Kuwait, which has an
army of 10,(KK) men and a navy that consists of eight ships, was
in the process of obtaining sophisticated anti-missile defenses.
He gave no details but was quoted as predicting that Kuwait's
vulnerability to attack "would not continue."
Russian-American poet wins Nobel
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — The 1987 Nobel Prize for
Literature was awarded here yesterday to Joseph Brodsky, a
Russian-born poet and essayist who once served time in a
Siberian labor camp before being exiled and becoming an Amer
ican citizen in 1977.
At 47, Brodsky is one of the youngest writers ever to be given
the world's most prestigious literary award.
The citation by the Swedish Academy, which awards the an
nual prize, declared that he was selected "for all-embracing aut
horship, imbued with clarity of thought and poetic intensity."
In the Soviet Union, Brodsky's work was condemned as
"pornographic and anti-Soviet" by officials who refused to
publish it. Before being expelled from the Soviet Union,
Brodsky served 18 months in a Siberian prison camp for "social
parasitism." He had twice been put in mental institutions before
that.
In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov commented Thursday that "the tastes of the Nobel
committee are somewhat strange sometimes, but tastes do dif
fer." He added, however, that "I was informed by the Novy
Mir editorial staff that they had negotiations with the prize win
ner, and that they're going to publish his works."
Howard Beach trial reveals chase
NEW YORK — In a thick, monotone Queens accent, Robert
Riley described yesterday how he and his friends chased a black
man to the edge of the Belt Parkway in Howard Beach last De
cember, testifying that he heard a loud "thud" and saw the
man's body "go up a couple of feet in the air" when he was
struck by a passing car.
Riley, 18, the prosecution's chief witness at his friends' trial,
said he and four other white teen-agers had pursued Michael
Griffith to a roadside guard rail and that Griffith ran "straight
onto the Belt Parkway" where he was hit.
Riley said the chase began several blocks earlier when he and
his high-school friends confronted three black men outside a
pizzeria and ran after them, shouting, "Niggers, get the
(expletive) out of the neighborhood."
One of his friends, Jon Lester, was wielding a metal bat when
the chase stopped at the parkway, Riley said.
Riley, who is under 24-hour police guard, is being allowed to
plead guilty to a lesser charge of assault, which carries a maxi
mum seven-year prison term, in exchange for his cooperation.
The son of a city corrections officer, Riley originally was
charged with second-degree murder.

Shultz nears agreement in Moscow
MOSCOW — With aides on both sides expressing growing
optimism, Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister hduard Shevardnadze virtually completed work yes
terday on a long-pending treaty to ban medium- and shorter
range nuclear missiles.
Although several issues, including the Soviet demand for on
