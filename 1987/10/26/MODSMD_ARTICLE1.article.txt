Legal experts predicted yester
day that the ruling to be handed
down this week in Santa Clara
County Superior Court on the
NCAA drug-testing case may es
tablish a nationwide precedent
for similar lawsuits brought by
athletes against drug-testing pro
grams.
If Judge Conrad Rushing is
sues a preliminary injunction
against the National Collegiate
Athletic Association's year-old
drug-testing program in the suit
filed by Stanford athletes Jenni
fer Hill and Barry McKeever,
other athletes across the country
would be encouraged to follow
suit, according to an attorney for
the NCAA.
George Gang were, an NCAA
attorney not directly involved in
the case, said last night from Mis
sion, Kansas, that a ruling in fa
vor of the NCAA "would be very
helpful in upholding drug testing
because we are in such a difficult
jurisdiction with this case."
The California constitution's
right to privacy clause, the cor
nerstone of McKeever's and
Hill's suit, offers greater protec
tion than similar clauses in other
states' constitutions or in the
U.S. Constitution, Gangwere
said.
Although Rushing's decision
will establish a certain interpreta
tion of the California constitu
tion, it will not directly affect
other California schools unless
upheld by an appellate court, ac
cording to Law Prof. Jack
Friedenthal.
