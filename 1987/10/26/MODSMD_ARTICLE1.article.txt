# Drug test decision may set precedent
## 
### Nick Anderson Erik Johnson Staff writers 
Legal experts predicted yester
day that the ruling to be handed
down this week in Santa Clara
County Superior Court on the
NCAA drug-testing case may es
tablish a nationwide precedent
for similar lawsuits brought by
athletes against drug-testing pro
grams.
If Judge Conrad Rushing is
sues a preliminary injunction
against the National Collegiate
Athletic Association's year-old
drug-testing program in the suit
filed by Stanford athletes Jenni
fer Hill and Barry McKeever,
other athletes across the country
would be encouraged to follow
suit, according to an attorney for
the NCAA.
George Gang were, an NCAA
attorney not directly involved in
the case, said last night from Mis
sion, Kansas, that a ruling in fa
vor of the NCAA "would be very
helpful in upholding drug testing
because we are in such a difficult
jurisdiction with this case."
The California constitution's
right to privacy clause, the cor
nerstone of McKeever's and
Hill's suit, offers greater protec
tion than similar clauses in other
states' constitutions or in the
U.S. Constitution, Gangwere
said.
Although Rushing's decision
will establish a certain interpreta
tion of the California constitu
tion, it will not directly affect
other California schools unless
upheld by an appellate court, ac
cording to Law Prof. Jack
Friedenthal.
Friedenthal, Stanford's faculty
athletic representative to the
NCAA, added that regardless of
the outcome of the ease,
"something will be done. Just
what is not clear. But the (NCAA
drug) policy will probably be
changed in some way."
Friedenthal speculated that
"the judge might be prone to
throw out much of the vast list of
banned drugs unless they're
shown to directly enhance per
formance."
Rushing indicated several
times last week that he would be
looking to "fine tune" the drug
testing program, not abolish it.
"The losing side will probably
not let this case die," Friedenthal
added. "If the students lose, I
would hope they would appeal. I
think they have a very strong
chance in a higher court. After
all, they're correct."
Gangwere said that if the
NCAA were to lose the case, "1
would guess we'd appeal." In
recent weeks, observers had
predicted that should the drug
tests be ruled unconstitutional
the NCAA would let the case
drop in order to minimize its im
pact.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
responding to the argument made
by the NCAA during the trial that
universities should establish their
own drug-testing programs, em
phatically denied that Stanford
would establish a program
similar to the one employed by
UCLA.
"We do not test for drugs," he
said, although he added that
Stanford would "by all means"
abide by a court ruling requiring
the Athletic Department to
administer drug tests if a Stan
ford varsity team qualifies for
postseason competition.
Geiger also said that Stanford
athletes would be advised to sign
a consent form for drug testing in
order to be eligible for regular
season competition.
