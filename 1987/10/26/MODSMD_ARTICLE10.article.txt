# Budget talks garner support

WASHINGTON — On the eve of a
meeting between President Reagan and con
gressional leaders over the nation's budget
deficit, Republican and Democratic officials
voiced hopes yesterday that the negotiations
will lead to reductions well beyond the $23
billion required by federal law.
If the two sides can agree on additional
cuts in the deficit, said Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), it would send "a
reassuring signal" to jittery financial markets
around the world that the government is
serious about making long-range economic
reforms.
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas), who chairs
the Senate Finance Committee, said, "I'm
quite prepared to do more, and 1 think we
could do some more," suggesting that larger
deficit cuts could be spread out by Congress
and the White House over the next two to
three years.
The comments reflect a growing belief
among congressional leaders that the $23 bil
lion in cuts mandated this year by the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law may be
insufficient. Financial analysts have ex
pressed concern that the current $148 billion
budget deficit will increase in future years
without stringent budgetary reforms.
In today's meeting at the White House, a
face-to-face session that the president called

in response to the stock market plunge,
House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas), House
Minority Leader Robert Michel (13-111.), Sen
ate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.)
and Dole will sit down with Reagan to discuss
an issue that has sharply divided them in the
past.
They will also be attempting to send a sig
nal to financial markets that the federal gov
ernment, which has been politically dead
locked over this year's budget for months,
"knows how to govern . . . that we can con
trol this situation," Byrd said earlier last
week.
The White House and congressional
negotiators have generally agreed that they
should try to meet the $23 billion target with a
combination of spending cuts and new reve
nues. If they fail to agree on such a plan, the
Gramm-Rudman law will impose deep,
across the board cuts in numerous federal
programs by Nov. 30, a prospect neither side
wants.
"To let that happen would signal an aban
donment of leadership," said Sen. Lawton
Chiles (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee, during an appearance on
CBS-TV's "Face the Nation." "We've got
three weeks to put together a different pack
age, and that's something we really should
try to do."

lhere is far less agreement, however, on
the ingredients of deficit reduction.
When Reagan agreed to meet with congres
sional negotiators, for example, he said that
all budgetary proposals could be discussed —
including taxes — except the social security
program. Since then, he has repeated his op
position to new taxes and blamed Democrats
for the deficit. . , .
Democrats, meanwhile, have criticized the
White House for sending out mixed signals
on the budget negotiations, vowing that
Reagan will have to consider some kind of
revenue increases to help reduce the deficit
and restore investor confidence.
There are also mixed opinions on a propoal
by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) that the gov
ernment cut the deficit by freezing expendi
tures at their current level for several years.
While Dole expressed interest in the sugges
tion, Chiles dismissed the idea, saying it
could harm a multitude of services, ranging
from law enforcement to child nutrition pro
grams.
As negotiators begin to tackle the deficit
problem, some Wall Street officials have al
ready said that $23 billion in cuts will not
reassure financial markets that the govern
ment has embarked on a long-term solution to
cure its economic problems.
