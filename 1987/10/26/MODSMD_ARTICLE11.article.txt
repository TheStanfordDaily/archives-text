### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium — Sec
retary of State George Shultz
told NATO foreign ministers
here Saturday that the United
States fully expects to complete
and sign an agreement with the
Soviet Union this year to elimi
nate intermediate nuclear forces
worldwide, whether or not there
is a heads of government summit
meeting in Washington.
Speaking at a news conference
at North Atlantic Treaty Organi
zation headquarters during a spe
cial stopover en route from Mos
cow back to Washington, Shultz
said: "There is no indication that
this (lack of a summit) will hold
things up on an INF agreement."
He noted that Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevernardze
had "given a similar answer" in
Moscow and said that they both
had agreed in their final talk "to
keep up the pressure to get
finished."
"I think we will get an agree

ment, and that we will want to
get it signed," Shultz said. "If
not at a summit, then we will
look for another way to do it. But
it would be desirable to have it
done in the presence of the
leaders who are responsible."
At the same time, Shultz
brushed aside a proposal made
by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev during their Friday meeting,
and subsequently publicized by
the Soviet news agency Tass, for
an immediate moratorium from
Nov. I on any further deploy
ment, manufacture or develop
ment work on intermediate nu
clear forces — all nuclear weap
ons with ranges between 3(X) and
3000 miles.
"No fish is going to bite on
that one," Shultz said. "It would
be very unwise for us to put the
presumed treaty into effect
before it is even finished or
signed."
Foreign ministers of all 16
members of NATO except

Greece and Turkey flew to Brus
sels for the session with Shultz,
which lasted about two hours.
During the meeting and at his
news conference the secretary
played down the refusal of Gor
bachev to fix a date for a Wash
ington meeting with President
Reagan. The other foreign minis
ters were clearly in general
agreement.
One minister said that things
are now in a period of "active pa
tience."
British Foreign Secretary
Geoffrey Howe said "the ball is
clearly in the Moscow court and
it is time for cool heads and
steady nerves." When Howe
was asked if he thought Gorba
chev had made this move to add
to pressures on President Reagan
along with the American stock
market crash, the foreign secre
tary laughed and said, 4 Well
nobody in the room suggested
that one."
Shultz declined to speculate on

the reasons for the Gorbachev
move. He simply said that
"conditions were more favorable
for a summit in Moscow than
they were a month ago when the
Soviet Union agreed to a summit
— there is an open invitation and
when he (Gorbachev) is ready to
accept, we will be prepared to
receive him, and 1 think I'll leave
it at that."
The practical results of the
Moscow meeting were consider
able. Shultz told his news confer
ence that a formula had now been
agreed upon by both sides to
cover the unilateral withdrawal
and dismantling of 72 obsoles
cent West German Pershing 1-A
missiles, along with the Ameri
can arsenals of Pershing 2 and
cruise missiles. The West Ger
man weapons, owned by Bonn
but carrying warheads controlled
by the United States, had been a
major sticking point with the So
viet Union.
