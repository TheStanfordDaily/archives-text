## Reporter defends Hart disclosure 
### Joe Metcalfe Staff writer 
The Miami Herald reporter
who exposed Gary Hart s affair
with Donna Rice spoke with stu
dents here Friday, defending the
Herald's controversial decision
to print the article that eventually
forced Hart to abandon his presi
dential bid.
In an informal discussion with
graduate students in communica
tions, Jim McGee, a Knight Fel
low and a member of a Herald
reporting team that won a Pulit
zer Prize for its coverage of the
Iran-contra affair, claimed the
question was whether "the
Herald destroyed Hart's career
or if Hart destroyed his (own)
career."
Acting on anonymous informa
tion, McGee and other Herald
staffers staked out Hart's
townhouse in Washington, D.C.,
earlier this year and observed
Hart spending the weekend with
Rice. Hart later dropped out of
the presidential race because of
the scandal generated by
McGee's article on the liaison.

"This was tragic, but it wasn't
our tragedy. We were the
catalyst for it, but we didn't set
this thing in motion," McGee
said.
Asserting that there is "no
question it was relevant to
IHart's] campaign," McGee
argued that the issue of
"womanizing" had been brought
up previously but was categori
cally denied ny Hart.
"What we were doing in the
Hart situation, I would suggest,
was to test the image of what he
was trying to sell — i.e., 'family
man' and all those other things —
with reality," McGee said.
He noted that the family' was
a common theme in Hart s cam
paign — that Hart often gathered
his wife and children around him
when making important
speeches, including the official
announcement of his candidacy.
While admitting that he would
make minor changes if he were
writing the story today, McGee
said the Herald report was accu
rate.
He said if he were re-writing
the article he would avoid using
the word "surveillance," which

he said implies a professional
police-type capability that a
newspaper doesn't possess.
"The story as written was true
at that time, and it's true today,''
he said. "I stand by the story."

'What we were doing
in the Hart situation, 1
would suggest, was to
test the image of what
he was trying to sell —
i.e., 'family man' and
all those other things
— with reality."

In response to questions,
McGee defended the effective
ness of internal control of the
press. But he also warned against
the spread of self-censorship,
claiming that "manipulation of
the press is like a full-time job for
those on the public payroll.
"We have this vast wasteland

of journalism out there, and most
of what [newspapers! print
doesn't merit First Amendment
protection [and) doesn't require
it. They don't do anything ag
gressive," he said.
In particular, McGee stressed
the necessity of investigative
reporting, although he at times
admitted it may not be a "nice
process."
McGee said the final decision
to print the Hart story was based
on its news value, direct personal
observation and the 20-minute in
terview with Hart that night that
gave him an opportunity to
respond.
During this interview. Hart
made several key admissions and
also said he could not remember
how Rice had left the townhouse.
McGee said no mention was
made at this time of Rice exiting
through the back door, which
Hart later maintained.
Although some have suggested
that it would have been wise to
wait a day to print the story,
McGee said he had an "intuitive
sense that Hart and his campaign
would undertake an effort to un
dermine it" before it was printed.

low and a member of a Herald
reporting team that won a Pulit
zer Prize for its coverage of the
Iran-contra affair, claimed the
question was whether "the
Herald destroyed Hart's career
or if Hart destroyed his (own)
career."
Acting on anonymous informa
tion, McGee and other Herald
staffers staked out Hart's
townhouse in Washington, D.C.,
earlier this year and observed
Hart spending the weekend with
Rice. Hart later dropped out of
the presidential race because of
the scandal generated by
McGee's article on the liaison.

"This was tragic, but it wasn't
our tragedy. We were the
catalyst for it, but we didn't set
this thing in motion," McGee
said.
Asserting that there is "no
question it was relevant to
IHart's] campaign," McGee
argued that the issue of
"womanizing" had been brought
up previously but was categori
cally denied ny Hart.
"What we were doing in the
Hart situation, I would suggest,
was to test the image of what he
was trying to sell — i.e., 'family
man' and all those other things —
with reality," McGee said.
He noted that the family' was
a common theme in Hart s cam
paign — that Hart often gathered
his wife and children around him
when making important
speeches, including the official
announcement of his candidacy.
While admitting that he would
make minor changes if he were
writing the story today, McGee
said the Herald report was accu
rate.
He said if he were re-writing
the article he would avoid using
the word "surveillance," which

he said implies a professional
police-type capability that a
newspaper doesn't possess.
"The story as written was true
at that time, and it's true today,''
he said. "I stand by the story."

'What we were doing
in the Hart situation, 1
would suggest, was to
test the image of what
he was trying to sell —
i.e., 'family man' and
all those other things
— with reality."

In response to questions,
McGee defended the effective
ness of internal control of the
press. But he also warned against
the spread of self-censorship,
claiming that "manipulation of
the press is like a full-time job for
those on the public payroll.
"We have this vast wasteland

of journalism out there, and most
of what [newspapers! print
doesn't merit First Amendment
protection [and) doesn't require
it. They don't do anything ag
gressive," he said.
In particular, McGee stressed
the necessity of investigative
reporting, although he at times
admitted it may not be a "nice
process."
McGee said the final decision
to print the Hart story was based
on its news value, direct personal
observation and the 20-minute in
terview with Hart that night that
gave him an opportunity to
respond.
During this interview. Hart
made several key admissions and
also said he could not remember
how Rice had left the townhouse.
McGee said no mention was
made at this time of Rice exiting
through the back door, which
Hart later maintained.
Although some have suggested
that it would have been wise to
wait a day to print the story,
McGee said he had an "intuitive
sense that Hart and his campaign
would undertake an effort to un
dermine it" before it was printed.
