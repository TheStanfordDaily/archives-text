The School of Education's recent move to in
crease cooperation between Stanford research
ers and local school districts is a good idea that
will benefit both the University and area
schools.
Four school districts will join Stanford in set
ting up the Professional Development Center, a
program designed to bring professors out of their
ivory towers and to encourage elementary and
secondary teachers to learn about ideas
developed by educational researchers. Offices
for the program will be set up beginning this
week at Stanford and in school districts covering
Palo Alto, Redwood City, San Mateo, Mountain
View and Los Altos. The local districts and the
School of Education have spent well over a year
developing the new cooperative effort and this
summer set up a trial program to work out the
bugs.
Contact with educators and real classroom sit

uations offers researchers here an important per
spective on educational practice that will enable
them to develop teaching methods that can be
successfully applied. The input of classroom vet
erans is essential to a true understanding of the
elementary and secondary school environment.
Likewise, it is vital that teachers learn from
research results and incorporate advances in the
field into their regular classroom instruction.
Too often teachers falsely assume that research
has nothing to add to their effectiveness as
educators.
University President Donald Kennedy last
month joined 36 college presidents in calling on
institutions of higher education to play a leading
role in proposing teaching reforms at the elemen
tary and secondary levels. It is good to see the
School of Education addressing these very prob
lems.
