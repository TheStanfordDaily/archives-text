# Ads take euphemism too far
## 
### 
I'm all for life being as pleasant as possible.
1 don't go out of my way to seek out trouble
and nastiness, nor do 1 brood upon life s
major flaws.
But 1 am also very willing to admit that
there are certain aspects of daily life that are
not quite as nice as one might hope. I am
reconciled to this. It doesn't bother me.
However, 1 do begin to get upset when I
catch someone, usually the advertising indus
try, trying to gloss over these little un
pleasantries so they can sell products.

I suppose this behavior makes sense, for if
you want to sell an item you want to attach as
many positive connotations to it as possible.
But in many cases advertisers go too far.
Look at ads for deodorant. Body odor isn't
a happy thing. Anyone who has spent time in
'a crowded city bus during the summer knows
this. Personally, I feel that deodorant is one
of humankind's greatest achievements. But
the commercials for the product in question
are far worse than the body odor it suppos
edly prevents.
For men's deodorant, it's usually a locker
room scene after the big workout. Five
buddies, ethnically balanced of course, are
primping before a mirror and bragging about
how dry their particular roll-on or stick is.
Sorry fellas, but "dry" is the adjective used
to describe fine sherry, not Speedstick.
It's even worse in the locker room next
door. For some reason, the women in com
mercials always seem to be fighting off the
menfolk, defending their specially formulated
women's deodorant like it was the Maltese
Falcon. 1 don't know about this. None of my
female friends has ever seemed terribly pro
tective of her Arid Extra-Dry, but then,
unlike the men on the commercials, I have
never really been possessed by the urge to
take it from them.

Another major offender is toilet paper.
Frankly, I have never had the sudden com
pulsion to go and squeeze a roll or two in the
supermarket. Toilet paper isn't something to
fondle; in fact it's not an item 1 like to give a
lot of thought to. Basically, it's a boring, al
though necessary, product for a distasteful
function. Yet the producers regale us with
images of children and teddy bears bouncing
and frolicking in yards of fluffy, scented, pas
tel toilet paper. How sweet, how innocent.
This all strikes me as being excessive. All I
ask from my toilet paper is that 1 not get
splinters from it. Beyond that, it could sing
opera and change the oil in my car, and I
really wouldn't care. Pattern, scent and color
are superfluous. It's just going to get flushed
anyway.
Toothcare products are also in on this
outrage. Toothpaste, for example, is nothing
more than glorified silver polish with a little
peppermint thrown in for good measure. Bas
ically, it's revolting stuff. Have you ever
drunk orange juice after brushing your teeth?
Yum. Yet we've all seen a commercial where
some child is brushing away like there's no
tomorrow just because Crest tastes so good.
The toothbrush companies are equally bad.
In my opinion, a toothbrush should be a
simple object — something with which to get
an unpleasant and tedious chore over and
done with. But today's post-modern, new age
toothbrushes are highly engineered instru
ments. Raised, lowered and slanted bristles.
Aerodynamic heads. Carefully structured
handles for maximum comfort and ease of
use. Good Lord, all I want is something to
wipe dinner off my teeth, not orbit Neptune.
I won't even touch the whole area of
feminine hygiene products, except to point
out that if you believe the commercials,
you'd think that every post-pubescent
woman in America spends half her time in a
tastefully decorated room comparing tam
pons with three or four of her closest friends.
Forget bridge, ladies. Let's talk Tampex in
stead.
But I think my personal pick for worst
abuse of all would be commericals for men's
shaving products. I guess I'm a bit biased,
but I've been shaving every day since I
turned 14 and have yet to find the silver lining

around this particular cloud. Usually the ads
feature some muscular guy in a white Macy's
towel, standing in a very elegant bathroom,
shaving before a gilt-edged mirror and grin
ning like a delighted Charles Manson from
the sheer delight of being able to participate
in this, the ultimate rite of masculinity. The
camera pans in close, and he says in a deep
voice, "There's really nothing like a good
shave."'
Now let's just keep in mind that the actor
in question is being paid an obscene amount
of money to say that. No rational male would
even think such a thing. Besides, he is clearly
lying. There are many things like a good
shave. Embracing a running chain saw is a
close equivalent. So is bathing with raw
lobsters. And let's also remember that
"good" is to "shave" as "attractive" is to
"mobile home."
How the advertisers think they can get
away with portraying shaving as a
pleasurable, rewarding activity is quite
beyond me. I mean, I 'm lucky to come out of
the experience without requiring stitches.
Anyone who believes that slicing off entire
facial features is exciting, exhilirating and
generally satisfying is the sort of person who
likes to go out and spear elk. Rambo spears
elk. Normal, well-adjusted persons like
myself prefer to order fettucine in a line res
taurant. 1 think this dichotomy is rather tell
ing.
If you find this euphemistic trend as annoy
ing and disturbing as 1 do, then 1 sympathize.
If not, well you can go on squeezing toilet
paper and spearing elk to your heart's con
tent. Unfortunately, the chances of marked
improvement in this area seem far from hope
ful. I can't exactly see the producers of
shaving products airing a commercial which
features a man bleeding from a severed ar
tery, much less the toilet paper people going
out of their way to draw attention to the ac
tual uses of their product.
We "hardened realists" will just have to
switch to PBS. Hours of Masterpiece Theater
and Sesame Street beat one douche commer
cial hands down. 1 hope that at least on this
point I stand unopposed.

I'm all for life being as pleasant as possible.
1 don't go out of my way to seek out trouble
and nastiness, nor do 1 brood upon life s
major flaws.
But 1 am also very willing to admit that
there are certain aspects of daily life that are
not quite as nice as one might hope. I am
reconciled to this. It doesn't bother me.
However, 1 do begin to get upset when I
catch someone, usually the advertising indus
try, trying to gloss over these little un
pleasantries so they can sell products.

I suppose this behavior makes sense, for if
you want to sell an item you want to attach as
many positive connotations to it as possible.
But in many cases advertisers go too far.
Look at ads for deodorant. Body odor isn't
a happy thing. Anyone who has spent time in
'a crowded city bus during the summer knows
this. Personally, I feel that deodorant is one
of humankind's greatest achievements. But
the commercials for the product in question
are far worse than the body odor it suppos
edly prevents.
For men's deodorant, it's usually a locker
room scene after the big workout. Five
buddies, ethnically balanced of course, are
primping before a mirror and bragging about
how dry their particular roll-on or stick is.
Sorry fellas, but "dry" is the adjective used
to describe fine sherry, not Speedstick.
It's even worse in the locker room next
door. For some reason, the women in com
mercials always seem to be fighting off the
menfolk, defending their specially formulated
women's deodorant like it was the Maltese
Falcon. 1 don't know about this. None of my
female friends has ever seemed terribly pro
tective of her Arid Extra-Dry, but then,
unlike the men on the commercials, I have
never really been possessed by the urge to
take it from them.

Another major offender is toilet paper.
Frankly, I have never had the sudden com
pulsion to go and squeeze a roll or two in the
supermarket. Toilet paper isn't something to
fondle; in fact it's not an item 1 like to give a
lot of thought to. Basically, it's a boring, al
though necessary, product for a distasteful
function. Yet the producers regale us with
images of children and teddy bears bouncing
and frolicking in yards of fluffy, scented, pas
tel toilet paper. How sweet, how innocent.
This all strikes me as being excessive. All I
ask from my toilet paper is that 1 not get
splinters from it. Beyond that, it could sing
opera and change the oil in my car, and I
really wouldn't care. Pattern, scent and color
are superfluous. It's just going to get flushed
anyway.
Toothcare products are also in on this
outrage. Toothpaste, for example, is nothing
more than glorified silver polish with a little
peppermint thrown in for good measure. Bas
ically, it's revolting stuff. Have you ever
drunk orange juice after brushing your teeth?
Yum. Yet we've all seen a commercial where
some child is brushing away like there's no
tomorrow just because Crest tastes so good.
The toothbrush companies are equally bad.
In my opinion, a toothbrush should be a
simple object — something with which to get
an unpleasant and tedious chore over and
done with. But today's post-modern, new age
toothbrushes are highly engineered instru
ments. Raised, lowered and slanted bristles.
Aerodynamic heads. Carefully structured
handles for maximum comfort and ease of
use. Good Lord, all I want is something to
wipe dinner off my teeth, not orbit Neptune.
I won't even touch the whole area of
feminine hygiene products, except to point
out that if you believe the commercials,
you'd think that every post-pubescent
woman in America spends half her time in a
tastefully decorated room comparing tam
pons with three or four of her closest friends.
Forget bridge, ladies. Let's talk Tampex in
stead.
But I think my personal pick for worst
abuse of all would be commericals for men's
shaving products. I guess I'm a bit biased,
but I've been shaving every day since I
turned 14 and have yet to find the silver lining

around this particular cloud. Usually the ads
feature some muscular guy in a white Macy's
towel, standing in a very elegant bathroom,
shaving before a gilt-edged mirror and grin
ning like a delighted Charles Manson from
the sheer delight of being able to participate
in this, the ultimate rite of masculinity. The
camera pans in close, and he says in a deep
voice, "There's really nothing like a good
shave."'
Now let's just keep in mind that the actor
in question is being paid an obscene amount
of money to say that. No rational male would
even think such a thing. Besides, he is clearly
lying. There are many things like a good
shave. Embracing a running chain saw is a
close equivalent. So is bathing with raw
lobsters. And let's also remember that
"good" is to "shave" as "attractive" is to
"mobile home."
How the advertisers think they can get
away with portraying shaving as a
pleasurable, rewarding activity is quite
beyond me. I mean, I 'm lucky to come out of
the experience without requiring stitches.
Anyone who believes that slicing off entire
facial features is exciting, exhilirating and
generally satisfying is the sort of person who
likes to go out and spear elk. Rambo spears
elk. Normal, well-adjusted persons like
myself prefer to order fettucine in a line res
taurant. 1 think this dichotomy is rather tell
ing.
If you find this euphemistic trend as annoy
ing and disturbing as 1 do, then 1 sympathize.
If not, well you can go on squeezing toilet
paper and spearing elk to your heart's con
tent. Unfortunately, the chances of marked
improvement in this area seem far from hope
ful. I can't exactly see the producers of
shaving products airing a commercial which
features a man bleeding from a severed ar
tery, much less the toilet paper people going
out of their way to draw attention to the ac
tual uses of their product.
We "hardened realists" will just have to
switch to PBS. Hours of Masterpiece Theater
and Sesame Street beat one douche commer
cial hands down. 1 hope that at least on this
point I stand unopposed.
