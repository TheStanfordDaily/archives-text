## Athletics a privilege, not a right 
### 
Over the past few years I've heard the
NCAA referred to as "The National Coali
tion Against Athletes" on numerous occa
sions. In the past I've had a tendency to agree
with that particular viewpoint.

My sophomore year, as a result of Patrick
Ewing wearing a Nike shirt under his basket
ball jersey, new rules were instituted regard
ing the wearing of logos. As a member of the
swim team participating at the NCAA Cham
pionships, I had to blot out the logo on my
swim cap and scrape the logo off the bridge of
my goggles. Caps and goggles were not con
sidered mandatory equipment. This incon
venience surprisingly caused no real prob
lems.
Next came the instigation of drug testing.
My immediate reaction was that this time
they had gone too far and that this was clearly
a violation of our constitutional rights.
Recently, however, upon closer considera
tion, my opinion has changed. To loosely par
aphrase Stanford track Coach Brooks
Johnson: There's a difference between a right
and a privilege, and participation in the
NCAA is a privilege, not a right.
No one is required to compete in the
NCAA. Furthermore, every college and uni
versity that participates in the NCAA is a
part of that governing body. Therefore, the

rules that now exist comply with the wishes
of the majority of colleges and universities.
This point cannot be stressed enough. NCAA
rules are the result of democratic action, not
the whim of an elite group of select adminis
trators. The question, however, still remains
— why drug test? The benefits of drug testing
are clear.
t
Athletic departments across the country
pay out billions of dollars annually to give
scholarships to athletes (athletes whose
scholarships have absolutely nothing to do
with need — contrary to Stanford University
policy, I might add.) Let's not forget those
departments' right to protect their invest
ments and the tremendous responsibility that
goes along with having your education paid
for.
Many athletic departments want the ability
to spot-test their athletes because they feel
that the use of street drugs is inhibiting the
performance of their teams. I'm not advocat
ing that unusual pressure be put on these ath
letes; however, they owe an honest effort to
those athletic departments, and the use of il
legal drugs simply is not part of that responsi
bility. At this point one may ask, "What
about the athlete who is not on scholarship?"
Athletic departments still pay the coaches'
salaries in addition to numerous expenses for
facilities, equipment and travel.
One of the purposes of having a governing
body for a sports organization is to insure
that competition is fair, or as fair as possible.

Drug testing accomplishes this at the intercol
legiate level. Is it right to allow the few who
choose to use illegal steroids to have that ad
vantage? Drug testing eliminates that un
earned advantage. Is it right to allow athletes
to use other illegal performance-enhancing
drugs? Drug testing eliminates that unearned
advantage as well. Overall, drug testing
clears the way for the athlete who works hard
to obtain an advantage over his competitors.
Isn't that what athletics is about? I hope so.
In summary, the NCAA is a democratic
body with the intention of making intercol
legiate athletics as fair as possible. Participa
tion in the NCAA is a tremendous opportu
nity that also requires athletes to conform to
some basic rules. Drug testing is one such set
of rules. Although the current system needs
some work, the basic principle behind drug
testing is both constitutional and the right
thing to do. Just as the Department of Motor
Vehicles can deny people licenses if they do
not meet the requirements, so can the NCAA
bar an athlete from competition for the same
reason.
As a Stanford athlete, I gladly submitted to
drug testing in order to participate in such a
unique experience. Drug testing is a small
price to pay for the tremendous gains that are
made in the form of a better intercollegiate
athletic system. As athletes we must not for
get the opportunities that have been provided
for us and the obligation that goes along with
those opportunities.
