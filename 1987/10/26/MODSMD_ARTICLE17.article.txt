Right and left
rhetoric must

Jonathan Marley's letter of
Wednesday, Oct. 21, is interest
ing. Switch the polarity of the ar
guments and he would be saying
what contra supporters have
been saying about all the pro-
Sandinista presentations. And if
he had heard them, he would be
arguing the obvious "edu
cational" purpose of pro-
Sandinista information.
Left and right wing political ar
guments look very much alike:
"We're right, you're wrong,
there aren't any gray areas, and
that's all there is to it." Yes, the
contras have attacked civilians,
but so have the Sandinistas.
There are many refugees created
by both sides in the conflict. Nei
ther side has a lock on what is
right.
From what I've read, the Arias
peace plan admits just that. It
tries to open communications be
tween the sides. Compromise is
President Arias' intent. El Sal
vador has an elected government
that has done some good, and the
same can be said for the commu
nist government in Nicaragua.
Both countries have rebels who
kill innocent civilians, yet both
rebel groups have valid griev
ances against the current govern
ments. Both countries have polit
ical prisoners.
The only major difference is
the form of government that is in
power. Both need to move
toward the middle, and so do
their U.S. supporters. It's time

for our liberal politicians to stop
viewing the Sandinistas and Sal
vadoran rebels as exponentially
superior to their opponents. It is
also time for our conservative ac
tivists to stop viewing Duarte's
government and the contras in
the same light.
We should all be backing the
Arias plan. We should be admit
ting that all four groups have to
learn to change and to adapt to
reality. Of course, to start, we
must do that ourselves.

1 would like to thank some
very special Madera House stu
dents who participated in the
Reach Out Today Program Oct.
17 at Peninsula Children's Cen
ter. Seventeen students from
Madera volunteered their time on
a Saturday afternoon to do some
much needed painting at PCC, a
mental health and special educa
tion day school for children and
adolescents with severe emo
tional, behavioral and develop
mental disorders.
Although there was homework
to be completed and tests to be
studied for, the students were
both enthusiastic and energetic.
The time and dedication put forth
by these students is greatly ap
preciated by all of us at Peninsula
Children's Center. Thank You!
