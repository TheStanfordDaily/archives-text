## Diplomats study America Stanford and Hoover welcome leaders from Africa 
### Melissa Walter 
Although much is made of
the divisions between the
Hoover Institution and Stan
ford University, Hoover and
Stanford's African Studies Pro
gram recently put together a
joint presentation on U.S.
foreign policy for 16 visiting
African diplomats.
Hoover and Stanford "co
operate more than people
realize," and "an important
area of cooperation has been
African Studies," said Larry
Diamond, senior research fel
low at Hoover and a member of
the Stanford Committee on
African Studies. Diamond was
one of the main organizers of
the presentation two weeks ago
at Stanford.
The Stanford Committee on
African Studies worked to
facilitate cooperation between
Hoover and Stanford on this
event. In spite of the separation
of Hoover and Stanford at the

administrative level, the role of
the Committee on African
Studies is "to foster collabora
tion" between scholars of
Africa at Stanford and Hoover,
according to Will Leben, pro
fessor of linguistics and chair
man of the African Studies
Committee.
Three Hoover fellows are
members of the Stanford Com
mittee on African Studies:
Lewis Gann, Peter Duignan
and Diamond.
One aim of the committee is
to bring African scholars to
Stanford and Hoover jointly. A
scholar could, for example,
have a research appointment at
Hoover and a teaching appoint
ment at Stanford.
Such cooperation has al
ready taken place on a small
scale. When Masipula Siphole,
former dean of social sciences
at the University of Zimbabwe,
held a research fellowship at
Hoover, he also gave a Univer
sity seminar in Governor's Cor

ner on Southern Africa.
The program here was part of
the African diplomats' five
week visit to the United States
organized by Operation Cross
roads Africa, Inc. The trip was
part of OCA's African leaders'
program. Created in 1964, the
African leaders' program offers
about 12 exchanges a year,
each based on a particular
theme.
The theme of the program
here was U.S. foreign policy.
Other themes have included
agriculture, law, the media and
youth programs, according to
Derrick Brown of OCA. The
programs are funded by the
U.S. Information Agency, from
which OCA receives a yearly
budget for international
visitors.
The purpose of this particu
lar visit was to inform up-and
coming African diplomats
about factors that influence

American foreign policy. Repre
sentatives attended from several
African countries attended, in
cluding Zaire, Chad, Mali and
Tanzania.
Before they began a tour of the
United States, the diplomats
were exposed to a variety of U.S.
institutions, including the State
Department and executive
bodies in Washington, think
tanks such as the Kennedy
School of Government and the
Hoover Institution.
The group met local business
people, farmers, journalists and
other Americans in its travels,
which were designed to give the
diplomats a general familiarity
with American society.
In addition to meeting infor
mally with Stanford students and
faculty, the group attended semi
nars at the Hoover Institution
and seminars sponsored by the
Stanford Committee on African
Studies. Talks were given in Eng

lish and simultaneously
translated into French. The semi
nars addressed many topics
within the broad focus of U.S.
foreign policy and its formation.
Two themes — U.S.-Soviet re
lations and U.S. policy toward
South Africa — were addressed
from different angles both days.
Duignan and David Aber
nathy, professor of political sci
ence, presented very contrasting
views on the role of the United
States in South Africa. Duignan
supported President Reagan's
opposition to sanctions, while
Abernathy criticized the presi
dent's'policies.
Kennell Jackson, associate
professor of history, gave a
lecture titled, "Black Americans
and Their Ambitions for U.S.
Foreign Policy," which focused
on the concerns of a specific
group within the American
public.
Jackson's speech demon
strated one of the main lessons of
the visit for the Africans, accord
ing to Diamond: Pluralism exists
among political viewpoints in
America, and these different

views influence American
foreign policy. "I think they have
been impressed with the working
of the democratic process," Dia
mond said.
Diamond pointed out that
some of the diplomats were
surprised that the president's
nominee to the U.S. Supreme
Court could he rejected. Dia
mond said this exposure to the
U.S. political process will allow
the African diplomats to be more
effective in representing their
own countries in future dealings
with the United States.
Leben said Stanford also
benefitted from the exposure to
influential people from other
countries. " These are people
who are rising in their own
countries" and may "provide
more information (of interest to
Stanford) in the future," he said.
Diamond said that contacts
made now will be useful to Stan
ford as the University seeks to
develop internationally.
The diplomats were also im
pressed by the University itself
and asked many questions about
its history and size, he added.
