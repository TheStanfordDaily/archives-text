## Diplomats study America Stanford and Hoover welcome leaders from Africa 
### Melissa Walter 
Although much is made of
the divisions between the
Hoover Institution and Stan
ford University, Hoover and
Stanford's African Studies Pro
gram recently put together a
joint presentation on U.S.
foreign policy for 16 visiting
African diplomats.
Hoover and Stanford "co
operate more than people
realize," and "an important
area of cooperation has been
African Studies," said Larry
Diamond, senior research fel
low at Hoover and a member of
the Stanford Committee on
African Studies. Diamond was
one of the main organizers of
the presentation two weeks ago
at Stanford.
The Stanford Committee on
African Studies worked to
facilitate cooperation between
Hoover and Stanford on this
event. In spite of the separation
of Hoover and Stanford at the

administrative level, the role of
the Committee on African
Studies is "to foster collabora
tion" between scholars of
Africa at Stanford and Hoover,
according to Will Leben, pro
fessor of linguistics and chair
man of the African Studies
Committee.
Three Hoover fellows are
members of the Stanford Com
mittee on African Studies:
Lewis Gann, Peter Duignan
and Diamond.
One aim of the committee is
to bring African scholars to
Stanford and Hoover jointly. A
scholar could, for example,
have a research appointment at
Hoover and a teaching appoint
ment at Stanford.
Such cooperation has al
ready taken place on a small
scale. When Masipula Siphole,
former dean of social sciences
at the University of Zimbabwe,
held a research fellowship at
Hoover, he also gave a Univer
sity seminar in Governor's Cor

ner on Southern Africa.
The program here was part of
the African diplomats' five
week visit to the United States
organized by Operation Cross
roads Africa, Inc. The trip was
part of OCA's African leaders'
program. Created in 1964, the
African leaders' program offers
about 12 exchanges a year,
each based on a particular
theme.
The theme of the program
here was U.S. foreign policy.
Other themes have included
agriculture, law, the media and
youth programs, according to
Derrick Brown of OCA. The
programs are funded by the
U.S. Information Agency, from
which OCA receives a yearly
budget for international
visitors.
The purpose of this particu
lar visit was to inform up-and
coming African diplomats
about factors that influence
