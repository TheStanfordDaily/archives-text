# Stanford's links to Hoover
## 
### 
The following includes both real and perceived ties between the
two institutions.
• Three-quarters of Hoover's $100 million endowment is mixed
with Stanford's endowment.
•Stanford annually contributes approximately $3.4 million to
Hoover's library and archives.
• Hoover and Stanford fund-raising efforts overlap, with some
donors contributing to both insitutions.
•Access to both institutions attracts Stanford faculty members
as well as Hoover fellows.
• Faculty members and fellows may be appointed at the same
time to positions at Hoover and Stanford.
•Confusion regarding Hoover s independent status within the
University causes some to assume that Hoover-based opinions
are also embraced by Stanford.
