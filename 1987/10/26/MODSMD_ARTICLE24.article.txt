## Woodward's tales reveal little under the veil 
### Isaac Barchas 
"VEIL: The Secret Wars of the
CIA 1981-1987"
Bv Bob Woodward
Simon and Schuster, 1987
$21.95
The big scoop in Bob Wood
ward's rambling, tediously writ
ten and extensively hyped new
book about the CIA and its late
director, William Casey, isn't
really a scoop at all.
In the final — and heavily
serialized — pages, Woodward
informs the reader of a
melodramatic meeting with the
dying Casey in his room at
Georgetown Hospital. Asked by
Woodward if he knew of the di
version of funds from the Iran
arms sales to the Nicaraguan
resistance, Casey, drugged for
pain reduction, receiving radia
tion therapy and chemotherapy
for cancer and recovering from
neurosurgery, allegedly nodded
yes. When asked why he had ap
proved of such an enterprise,
Casey reportedly replied: "I
believed."
Never mind that Casey's wife,
Sophia, and his daughter, Ber
nadette, one of whom was al
ways present at the hospital,
swear that the meeting never
took place. Never mind that the
CIA, which had guards outside
the room, denies that Woodward
was ever alone with Casey.
Never mind the profound lack of
judgment, not to mention the
journalistic irresponsibility, in
volved in publishing the

autonomic twitches and slurred
speech of a dying man not in pos
session of his own faculties.
Never mind all that, because
even if it's true, it's not a scoop.
Anyone who followed the
muddle with Iran and the
Nicaraguan resistance could
deduce that Casey knew. Lt.
Col. Oliver North, under oath,
told the Select Committee and
the nation at large that Casey
knew. William Satire, long time
friend of Casey's, told the read
ership of the New York Times
op-ed page that Casey knew. The
point is, everybody already

knows the "big secret" of
"Veil."' As investigative jour
nalism. which is what Simon and
Schuster has billed it as, the book
just does not work.
Which is not to say that it fails
on all counts. Its story is compel
ling: The CIA, demoralized after
the Pike and Church investiga
tions in the mid-70s, and from
staff and budget cuts during the
Carter years, falls into the leader
ship of William Casey, a busi
nessman and Republican fund
raiser. His appointment is a polit
ical plum from Ronald Reagan to
an old political ally.

As Director of Central Intelli
gence (DCI), Casey seeks to in
ject a new spirit and effective
ness into the beleaguered organi
zation. By nature an entrepre
neur, he wants to change the
agency philosophy from "We
don't dare!" to "Can do!"
In doing so the new DCI
encounters serious problems. He
must contend with an agency bu
reaucracy — "insiders" who
nearly destroy the "outsider"
Casey early in his tenure.
Indeed, the book's main lesson
seems to be that even a man with
Casey's determination and presi
dential support can do little in the
face of the Washington establish
ment. He must also face a hostile
Congress and, as Woodward
makes clear, a bright, elite Wash
ington press corps led by none
other than the author himself.
But Casey manages to succeed
in some areas. He does shift the
ClA's mood. He does push the
organization toward more effec
tive data acquisition and analy
sis. And he — the old Office of
Strategic Services hand who
"believed" — does move the
CIA into far greater involvement
in covert operations.
Those covert situations — par
ticipation in secret wars, the
funding of resistance movements
and counterterrorism programs
— are the focus of Woodward's
sprawling book, and, the author
maintains, they were also the
focus of Casey. Woodward
paints a portrait of Casey as a
smart, dedicated man who bends
the spirit of the law until its letter

becomes unclear. Woodward s
Casey "stretches" restrictive
congressional amendments as
DCI in the same way that he
stretched the tax code as a man
of finance. The result is a
confused Congress drifting
toward outright rage — the con
fusion and rage, in fact, that led
to this past summer's televised
Iranamock spectacle.
While the fund of truly new in
formation in the book is low.
Woodward does give enough
novel anecdotes and operational
detail to keep the reader enter
tained. We read of Casey person
ally planting an electronic
eavesdropping device in the of
fice of a Middle Eastern leader.
We learn that America uses its
billion-dollar nuclear submarines
to tap Soviet communication
cables well within Soviet ter
ritorial water.
Woodward also does a good
job as a portraitist, tagging many
leaders in the corridors of power
with sensational and perhaps in
accurate caricatures. Detail
carries the day: Barry Gold
water, after a few drinks reading
classified material into the Con
gressional Record; Ronald
Reagan unable to contribute
more than "Well, yes, no" to
cabinet debate: Manucher
Gobanifar failing every question
except his name on a polygraph
examination, and Oliver North
still wanting to do business with
him.
Where "Veil" succeeds, it
does so for the same reason that
a John Le Carre or Tom Clancy

novel does: It provides a wealth
of operational detail that brings
into somewhat brighter light the
usually obscure world of cold
warriors and their shadow war.
And, at least once, Woodward
does give the reader some hard
news. On March 8, 1985, a CIA
scheme to kill Fadlallah — leader
of the terrorist group responsible
for the bombing of the Marine
compound in Beruit — went
awry, killing 80 people. (The
Soviets apparently are more ef
fective in ruthlessness than the
Americans. When a terrorist or
ganization, Hizbollah or the
Party of God, kidnapped four
Soviets in Beruit and murdered
one, Woodward reports that the
Soviets responded in kind. The
KGB seized a family member of
Hizbollah's leader, killed and
mutilated him and then returned
the body. The Party of God got
the message. They released their
remaining Soviet prisoners in a
"gesture of goodwill.")
What do we learn from
"Veil?" We learn how tough it is
to change the system, even from
the top. We learn that President
Reagan exercises frighteningly
loose control of his government.
We learn that the world is a weird
place — Khadafi likes to wear
dresses, for example — and that
people who run covert opera
tions do not always do a very
good job. We learn that Bob
Woodward likes "factoids,"
things that are not true but could
be, as much as he likes facts.
We learn, in summary, little
that is new.

tive data acquisition and analy
sis. And he — the old Office of
Strategic Services hand who
"believed" — does move the
CIA into far greater involvement
in covert operations.
Those covert situations — par
ticipation in secret wars, the
funding of resistance movements
and counterterrorism programs
— are the focus of Woodward's
sprawling book, and, the author
maintains, they were also the
focus of Casey. Woodward
paints a portrait of Casey as a
smart, dedicated man who bends
the spirit of the law until its letter

becomes unclear. Woodward s
Casey "stretches" restrictive
congressional amendments as
DCI in the same way that he
stretched the tax code as a man
of finance. The result is a
confused Congress drifting
toward outright rage — the con
fusion and rage, in fact, that led
to this past summer's televised
Iranamock spectacle.
While the fund of truly new in
formation in the book is low.
Woodward does give enough
novel anecdotes and operational
detail to keep the reader enter
tained. We read of Casey person
ally planting an electronic
eavesdropping device in the of
fice of a Middle Eastern leader.
We learn that America uses its
billion-dollar nuclear submarines
to tap Soviet communication
cables well within Soviet ter
ritorial water.
Woodward also does a good
job as a portraitist, tagging many
leaders in the corridors of power
with sensational and perhaps in
accurate caricatures. Detail
carries the day: Barry Gold
water, after a few drinks reading
classified material into the Con
gressional Record; Ronald
Reagan unable to contribute
more than "Well, yes, no" to
cabinet debate: Manucher
Gobanifar failing every question
except his name on a polygraph
examination, and Oliver North
still wanting to do business with
him.
Where "Veil" succeeds, it
does so for the same reason that
a John Le Carre or Tom Clancy

novel does: It provides a wealth
of operational detail that brings
into somewhat brighter light the
usually obscure world of cold
warriors and their shadow war.
And, at least once, Woodward
does give the reader some hard
news. On March 8, 1985, a CIA
scheme to kill Fadlallah — leader
of the terrorist group responsible
for the bombing of the Marine
compound in Beruit — went
awry, killing 80 people. (The
Soviets apparently are more ef
fective in ruthlessness than the
Americans. When a terrorist or
ganization, Hizbollah or the
Party of God, kidnapped four
Soviets in Beruit and murdered
one, Woodward reports that the
Soviets responded in kind. The
KGB seized a family member of
Hizbollah's leader, killed and
mutilated him and then returned
the body. The Party of God got
the message. They released their
remaining Soviet prisoners in a
"gesture of goodwill.")
What do we learn from
"Veil?" We learn how tough it is
to change the system, even from
the top. We learn that President
Reagan exercises frighteningly
loose control of his government.
We learn that the world is a weird
place — Khadafi likes to wear
dresses, for example — and that
people who run covert opera
tions do not always do a very
good job. We learn that Bob
Woodward likes "factoids,"
things that are not true but could
be, as much as he likes facts.
We learn, in summary, little
that is new.

"VEIL: The Secret Wars of the
CIA 1981-1987"
Bv Bob Woodward
Simon and Schuster, 1987
$21.95
The big scoop in Bob Wood
ward's rambling, tediously writ
ten and extensively hyped new
book about the CIA and its late
director, William Casey, isn't
really a scoop at all.
In the final — and heavily
serialized — pages, Woodward
informs the reader of a
melodramatic meeting with the
dying Casey in his room at
Georgetown Hospital. Asked by
Woodward if he knew of the di
version of funds from the Iran
arms sales to the Nicaraguan
resistance, Casey, drugged for
pain reduction, receiving radia
tion therapy and chemotherapy
for cancer and recovering from
neurosurgery, allegedly nodded
yes. When asked why he had ap
proved of such an enterprise,
Casey reportedly replied: "I
believed."
Never mind that Casey's wife,
Sophia, and his daughter, Ber
nadette, one of whom was al
ways present at the hospital,
swear that the meeting never
took place. Never mind that the
CIA, which had guards outside
the room, denies that Woodward
was ever alone with Casey.
Never mind the profound lack of
judgment, not to mention the
journalistic irresponsibility, in
volved in publishing the

autonomic twitches and slurred
speech of a dying man not in pos
session of his own faculties.
Never mind all that, because
even if it's true, it's not a scoop.
Anyone who followed the
muddle with Iran and the
Nicaraguan resistance could
deduce that Casey knew. Lt.
Col. Oliver North, under oath,
told the Select Committee and
the nation at large that Casey
knew. William Satire, long time
friend of Casey's, told the read
ership of the New York Times
op-ed page that Casey knew. The
point is, everybody already

knows the "big secret" of
"Veil."' As investigative jour
nalism. which is what Simon and
Schuster has billed it as, the book
just does not work.
Which is not to say that it fails
on all counts. Its story is compel
ling: The CIA, demoralized after
the Pike and Church investiga
tions in the mid-70s, and from
staff and budget cuts during the
Carter years, falls into the leader
ship of William Casey, a busi
nessman and Republican fund
raiser. His appointment is a polit
ical plum from Ronald Reagan to
an old political ally.

As Director of Central Intelli
gence (DCI), Casey seeks to in
ject a new spirit and effective
ness into the beleaguered organi
zation. By nature an entrepre
neur, he wants to change the
agency philosophy from "We
don't dare!" to "Can do!"
In doing so the new DCI
encounters serious problems. He
must contend with an agency bu
reaucracy — "insiders" who
nearly destroy the "outsider"
Casey early in his tenure.
Indeed, the book's main lesson
seems to be that even a man with
Casey's determination and presi
dential support can do little in the
face of the Washington establish
ment. He must also face a hostile
Congress and, as Woodward
makes clear, a bright, elite Wash
ington press corps led by none
other than the author himself.
But Casey manages to succeed
in some areas. He does shift the
ClA's mood. He does push the
organization toward more effec
tive data acquisition and analy
sis. And he — the old Office of
Strategic Services hand who
"believed" — does move the
