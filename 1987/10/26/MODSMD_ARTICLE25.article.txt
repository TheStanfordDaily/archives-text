## Stanford, Muster rally to drown Ducks Muster, Sweeney return to action 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
I he game was over, the miracle comeback a suc
cess. While the reporters jostled for position around
Brad Muster, David Sweeney sat quietly in the hack
of the locker room. No one was hurrying over to
talk with the placekicker, hut it almost wasn't ne
cessary. I he satisfied look on Sweeney's face told
his story better than any words could.
Although the epic return of Muster was the day's
big news, the All-America running back and the
often-criticized placekicker had a lot in common
Saturday. f - or both seniors, the win against Oregon
marked the end of long and frustrating waits.
Saturday, both Muster and Sweeney returned
from almost season-long absences to play major
roles in the Stanford win. Before scoring the win
ning touchdown, Muster kept the Cardinal hopes
alive with a crucial 9-yard run on third and 10.
Sweeney s 40-yard field goal in the third quarter
proved to be the Cardinal's three point margin of
victory.
"Its great to finally get a chance to contribute,"
Sweeney said.
"It was really great to play," Muster said. "I
wasn t sure it I would, but I guess he (Stanford
Coach Jack Elway) needed me. . . . I'm happy to
be back."
Sweeney's ordeal began last season when he
missed II of 15 field goals. After spending the fol
lowing spring and summer trying to regain his form,
Sweeney returned to fall camp and found himself
battling freshman John Hopkins for the starting po
sition.
By the second game of the season Hopkins had
won the job and Sweeney, a two-year starter, was
on the bench. Sweeney was able to come in and do
the short "pooch" punts (Saturday he contributed
two of them), but that was the extent of his playing
time.

best game of the season Saturday. I he Cardinal forced four Oregon turnovers.
