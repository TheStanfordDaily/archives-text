## Stanford, Muster rally to drown Ducks Muster, Sweeney return to action 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
I he game was over, the miracle comeback a suc
cess. While the reporters jostled for position around
Brad Muster, David Sweeney sat quietly in the hack
of the locker room. No one was hurrying over to
talk with the placekicker, hut it almost wasn't ne
cessary. I he satisfied look on Sweeney's face told
his story better than any words could.
Although the epic return of Muster was the day's
big news, the All-America running back and the
often-criticized placekicker had a lot in common
Saturday. f - or both seniors, the win against Oregon
marked the end of long and frustrating waits.
Saturday, both Muster and Sweeney returned
from almost season-long absences to play major
roles in the Stanford win. Before scoring the win
ning touchdown, Muster kept the Cardinal hopes
alive with a crucial 9-yard run on third and 10.
Sweeney s 40-yard field goal in the third quarter
proved to be the Cardinal's three point margin of
victory.
"Its great to finally get a chance to contribute,"
Sweeney said.
"It was really great to play," Muster said. "I
wasn t sure it I would, but I guess he (Stanford
Coach Jack Elway) needed me. . . . I'm happy to
be back."
Sweeney's ordeal began last season when he
missed II of 15 field goals. After spending the fol
lowing spring and summer trying to regain his form,
Sweeney returned to fall camp and found himself
battling freshman John Hopkins for the starting po
sition.
By the second game of the season Hopkins had
won the job and Sweeney, a two-year starter, was
on the bench. Sweeney was able to come in and do
the short "pooch" punts (Saturday he contributed
two of them), but that was the extent of his playing
time.

I he Stanford defense, sparked by hits like this one by Kevin Richardson (46), enjoyed its
best game of the season Saturday. I he Cardinal forced four Oregon turnovers.
The experience was a hum
bling one for Sweeney. "When
Hopkins came, I knew it was
going to be a battle. But you
don't know what you got until
it's gone. John took over, and a
lot of things came to light."
But instead of giving up,
Sweeney started working
overtime. Every day he and
teammates Greg Ennis and Spen
cer Cotten (the team's holders)
and Buck Roggeman and Kevin
Richardson (the long snappers)
stayed after practice and worked
on Sweeney's kicking.
"1 just want to thank them,"
Sweeney said. "Everything I did
today was a real testament to
their dedication."
Last week, Hopkins hurt his

knee in practice and Sweeney
was suddenly back in the spot
light. "It was kind of a cheesy
way to get back," Sweeney said.
"It feels good, but you're never
happy to see anyone's knee get
hurt. He (Hopkins) was having a
good year."
As a sign of their faith in him,
Sweeney's teammates elected
him co-captain for Saturday's
game. "It was something I didn't
deserve. I'm just glad I could
give something back."
Muster's job has been
decidedly safe all year, but a bad
ankle had kept the senior on the
sidelines the last three games.
Before the game. Muster told El
way that he wasn't KM) percent,
but could play. In the second
half, the Cardinal needed him,
and Muster rose to the occasion.
To a roaring cheer from the
crowd, Muster started Stanford's
first drive of the second half with

a 12-yard run that seemed to be
what Stanford needed to in
vigorate the previously listless
offense.
Through most of the half, the
offense continued to stall, but
when it came down to the finish.
Muster took charge.
On third and 10, Elway called a
trap for Muster. The result was
nine yards and a new lease on
life. The next play was a two
yard pass to Muster for a first
down. Finally, on first and goal
with 39 seconds showing on the
clock, Muster went over the left
tackle and in for the score.
After taking part in only losses
this year. Muster had been begin
ning to wonder. "My girlfriend
and my parents were calling me a
jinx," he said. "It's good to
know I'm not one."
Saturday, however, Oregon
was jinxed by Muster and
Sweeney.

talk with the placekicker, hut it almost wasn't ne
cessary. I he satisfied look on Sweeney's face told
his story better than any words could.
Although the epic return of Muster was the day's
big news, the All-America running back and the
often-criticized placekicker had a lot in common
Saturday. f - or both seniors, the win against Oregon
marked the end of long and frustrating waits.
Saturday, both Muster and Sweeney returned
from almost season-long absences to play major
roles in the Stanford win. Before scoring the win
ning touchdown, Muster kept the Cardinal hopes
alive with a crucial 9-yard run on third and 10.
Sweeney s 40-yard field goal in the third quarter
proved to be the Cardinal's three point margin of
victory.
"Its great to finally get a chance to contribute,"
Sweeney said.
"It was really great to play," Muster said. "I
wasn t sure it I would, but I guess he (Stanford
Coach Jack Elway) needed me. . . . I'm happy to
be back."
Sweeney's ordeal began last season when he
missed II of 15 field goals. After spending the fol
lowing spring and summer trying to regain his form,
Sweeney returned to fall camp and found himself
battling freshman John Hopkins for the starting po
sition.
By the second game of the season Hopkins had
won the job and Sweeney, a two-year starter, was
on the bench. Sweeney was able to come in and do
the short "pooch" punts (Saturday he contributed
two of them), but that was the extent of his playing
time.

I he Stanford defense, sparked by hits like this one by Kevin Richardson (46), enjoyed its
best game of the season Saturday. I he Cardinal forced four Oregon turnovers.
The experience was a hum
bling one for Sweeney. "When
Hopkins came, I knew it was
going to be a battle. But you
don't know what you got until
it's gone. John took over, and a
lot of things came to light."
But instead of giving up,
Sweeney started working
overtime. Every day he and
teammates Greg Ennis and Spen
cer Cotten (the team's holders)
and Buck Roggeman and Kevin
Richardson (the long snappers)
stayed after practice and worked
on Sweeney's kicking.
"1 just want to thank them,"
Sweeney said. "Everything I did
today was a real testament to
their dedication."
Last week, Hopkins hurt his

knee in practice and Sweeney
was suddenly back in the spot
light. "It was kind of a cheesy
way to get back," Sweeney said.
"It feels good, but you're never
happy to see anyone's knee get
hurt. He (Hopkins) was having a
good year."
As a sign of their faith in him,
Sweeney's teammates elected
him co-captain for Saturday's
game. "It was something I didn't
deserve. I'm just glad I could
give something back."
Muster's job has been
decidedly safe all year, but a bad
ankle had kept the senior on the
sidelines the last three games.
Before the game. Muster told El
way that he wasn't KM) percent,
but could play. In the second
half, the Cardinal needed him,
and Muster rose to the occasion.
To a roaring cheer from the
crowd, Muster started Stanford's
first drive of the second half with

a 12-yard run that seemed to be
what Stanford needed to in
vigorate the previously listless
offense.
Through most of the half, the
offense continued to stall, but
when it came down to the finish.
Muster took charge.
On third and 10, Elway called a
trap for Muster. The result was
nine yards and a new lease on
life. The next play was a two
yard pass to Muster for a first
down. Finally, on first and goal
with 39 seconds showing on the
clock, Muster went over the left
tackle and in for the score.
After taking part in only losses
this year. Muster had been begin
ning to wonder. "My girlfriend
and my parents were calling me a
jinx," he said. "It's good to
know I'm not one."
Saturday, however, Oregon
was jinxed by Muster and
Sweeney.
I he game was over, the miracle comeback a suc
cess. While the reporters jostled for position around
Brad Muster, David Sweeney sat quietly in the hack
of the locker room. No one was hurrying over to
talk with the placekicker, hut it almost wasn't ne
cessary. I he satisfied look on Sweeney's face told
his story better than any words could.
