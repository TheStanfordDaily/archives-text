# Defense, special teams lead Stanford victory
## 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
It took the Stanford offense 57
minutes and a pass interference
call to get going Saturday at Stan
ford Stadium, but a Brad Muster
touchdown with 39 seconds left
to play, a successful two-point
conversion and a never-say-die
defense were enough to ensure a
13-10 Cardinal win over Oregon.
The victory was the third in a
row for Stanford, upping the Car
dinal's Pacific 10 Conference
record to 2-2 and the team's
overall mark to 3-4. The Ducks,
who entered Saturday's game as
the 1987 Pac-10 surprise after up
setting Washington and USC,
dropped into a three-way tie for
fourth in the conference with
Stanford and Washington.
"This win was a great demon
stration of courage," Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said. "These
young guys played hard — it was
really something to behold. I
would have said the same thing if
we hadn't won."
"I'm thrilled for the team, the
coaches and players. I'm proud
to be a part of it."
Like last week's 44-40 win at
San Diego State, Saturday's
game went right down to the last
play and the Stanford defense
proved unyielding.
Down by three points with less
than 40 seconds remaining —
thanks in part to a 40-yard David
Sweeney field goal in the third
quarter — Oregon needed a

touchdown to win and stay in the
conference race.
The Cardinal defense allowed
the Ducks to get to the Stanford
21-yard line with 19 seconds left
but wouldn't surrender the score,
forcing Oregon quarterback Bill
Musgrave to miss on three
straight passes.
"It was a little too close to last
week,'' said Stanford defensive
tackle Sean Scheller, who caused
two fumbles, recovered a fumble
and recorded 10 tackles. "Much
too close. But last week, the of
fense picked up the slack when
we weren't playing well. This
week, the defense played to
gether and picked up the offense.
That's what football is all
about."
The Stanford offense certainly
needed picking up. The unit
managed only 185 total yards,
compared with 332 for the
Ducks. Cardinal quarterback
Brian Johnson completed only 18
of 35 passes for 126 yards with
three interceptions, one of which
led to an Oregon second-quarter
touchdown.
Things were so bad offensively
that the Cardinal managed only
one first down in the entire
second quarter — and that came
on a pass interference penaltv
with less than a minute to go in
the half.
But it was another pass inter
ference call that kept the Stan
ford hopes alive late in the fourth
quarter with the Cardinal trailing
10-5.
Stanford took over at its own
32-yard line after Oregon kicker
Kirk Dennis missed a 48-yard
field goal attempt. With 3:36 left,
the Cardinal offense stalled again
as Johnson's pass to Ed McCaf
frey on third and two fell incom
plete. Duck cornerback Brett
Young was called for inter
ference, however, giving Stan
ford a much-needed first down at
the Cardinal 48.
Johnson then made the play of
the game. Rather, receiver Jeff
James made the play of the game,
soaring over Thom Kaumeyer to
make a catch over the middle on
the right side of the field for a 28-
yard gain to the Oregon 24-yard
line.
"We came out in a formation
that wasn't even in our
playbook," said James, who
finished with eight receptions for
66 yards. "1 was trying to count
players to make sure we didn't
have too many men on the field.
We had four receivers on one
side of the field. This is one we'll

look back on and say, 'Thank
God.'
"When Brian threw it up
there, I knew I was going to get a
strong hit, so I just tried to jump
up and cradle it."
That set the stage for Muster,
who missed five of Stanford's
first six games with a sprained
ankle and didn't play in the first
half Saturday. On third and 10
from the Oregon 14, the senior
tailback rushed for nine yards off
left guard.
"We'd run that trap play
before," Muster said. "It had
been pretty successful all day,
and we were in two-down terri
tory. It was an instinctive kind of
run."
On fourth and one and with 54
seconds remaining in the contest,
Johnson completed the most cru
cial pass of the game, a two-yard
rollout to Muster to the Oregon
3. in the next play, Muster took it
in over left guard for the score.
"It was a great offensive ef
fort," said Muster, who totalled
43 yards rushing on 10 carries.
"(Fullback) Charlie Young was
lead blocking, and (tight end)
Eric Snelson had the secondary
block on the outside linebacker.
It wasn't difficult to get in."
With 39 seconds on the clock

and an 11-10 lead, Elway opted
to go for a two-point conversion
so the Ducks would have to get
into the end zone to win. Johnson
rolled left and went into the end
zone untouched to put the Cardi
nal up 13-10.
"I didn't think they'd go for
the tie," Elway said. "It didn't
even enter my mind."
All that remained was for the
defense to stop Oregon's final
drive the way it stopped San
Diego State last week. The Car
dinal gave up two passes of 34
and 23 yards before denying the
Ducks a score.
"The defense played great,"
said Stanford cornerback Kevin
Scott, who had an interception
and a fumble recovery. "We held
them. We bent a little bit, but we
held them out of (he end zone."
"The defense stayed behind
us," Johnson said. "They hung
tough and won the ball game for
us. I made some bad plays the
first three quarters. I tried to
shrug them oft', and the defense
kept giving us another chance."
The defense gave the Cardinal
numerous chances, in fact. The
Ducks made it into Stanford ter
ritory 10 times, but they came
away with only a field goal and a
touchdown. Dennis helped the
Cardinal cause by missing two
field goal attempts, but it was the
turnovers that really devastated
the Ducks' drives, as both
fumble recoveries and a Brad
Humphreys' interception oc
curred when the Ducks were
inside the Stanford 20-yard line.
"The turnovers killed us,"
Oregon Coach Rich Brooks said.
"We lost points when we turned
it over. We lost momentum."
The defense wasn't the only
unit that picked up the struggling
Stanford offense. The special
teams also contributed and were
directly responsible for the first
two Cardinal scores.
Stanford's first points came

early in the third quarter, when
Oregon punt returner Terry Obee
attempted to field a booming 56-
yard Doug Robison punt over his
head while racing back toward
the end zone.
Not a good idea. The Cardinal
pursuit was right on top of Obee
and chased him laterally along
the goal line before Mike New
ton's hit knocked Obee into the
end zone, where Rob Engle
hardt-Tain made the two-point
tackle.
"It was a team effort,"
Englehardt-Tain said. "1 was
lucky to make the tackle. New
ton hit him and he (Obee)
bounced backward. I just got
there first. If 1 hadn't got him.
there were six others who could
have."
Another sparkling special
teams play in the same quarter
led to the next Stanford score, as
Alan Grant took a high Jan

Cespades punt at the Stanford 24
and, with the Duck pursuit al
most on top of him, bolted up the
middle, cut to the right sideline,
and traveled 61 yards before
Cespedes knocked him out of
bounds at the Oregon 15.
"I didn't really realize they
were so close," said Grant, who
leads the Pac-10 in punt return
average. "I knew I had enough
room to catch the ball, and I did.
It was a big emotional lift. We
knew the offense wasn't moving
the ball, and we had to get it in
there."
The offense still couldn't move
the ball. In fact, Johnson and
company went backward. On
third and three from the Oregon
8, Stanford was penalized 15
yards for having 12 men on the
field. On fourth and 18 at the
Ducks' 36, Cardinal kicker
Sweeney came in to boot a 40-
yarder.
