# Defense, special teams lead Stanford victory

### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
It took the Stanford offense 57
minutes and a pass interference
call to get going Saturday at Stan
ford Stadium, but a Brad Muster
touchdown with 39 seconds left
to play, a successful two-point
conversion and a never-say-die
defense were enough to ensure a
13-10 Cardinal win over Oregon.
The victory was the third in a
row for Stanford, upping the Car
dinal's Pacific 10 Conference
record to 2-2 and the team's
overall mark to 3-4. The Ducks,
who entered Saturday's game as
the 1987 Pac-10 surprise after up
setting Washington and USC,
dropped into a three-way tie for
fourth in the conference with
Stanford and Washington.
"This win was a great demon
stration of courage," Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said. "These
young guys played hard — it was
really something to behold. I
would have said the same thing if
we hadn't won."
"I'm thrilled for the team, the
coaches and players. I'm proud
to be a part of it."
Like last week's 44-40 win at
San Diego State, Saturday's
game went right down to the last
play and the Stanford defense
proved unyielding.
Down by three points with less
than 40 seconds remaining —
thanks in part to a 40-yard David
Sweeney field goal in the third
quarter — Oregon needed a

touchdown to win and stay in the
conference race.
The Cardinal defense allowed
the Ducks to get to the Stanford
21-yard line with 19 seconds left
but wouldn't surrender the score,
forcing Oregon quarterback Bill
Musgrave to miss on three
straight passes.
"It was a little too close to last
week,'' said Stanford defensive
tackle Sean Scheller, who caused
two fumbles, recovered a fumble
and recorded 10 tackles. "Much
too close. But last week, the of
fense picked up the slack when
we weren't playing well. This
week, the defense played to
gether and picked up the offense.
That's what football is all
about."
The Stanford offense certainly
needed picking up. The unit
managed only 185 total yards,
compared with 332 for the
Ducks. Cardinal quarterback
Brian Johnson completed only 18
of 35 passes for 126 yards with
three interceptions, one of which
led to an Oregon second-quarter
touchdown.
Things were so bad offensively
that the Cardinal managed only
one first down in the entire
second quarter — and that came
on a pass interference penaltv
with less than a minute to go in
the half.
But it was another pass inter
ference call that kept the Stan
ford hopes alive late in the fourth
