The Stanford men s soccer
team was once again unable to
come out of its tailspin.
After winning four games in a
row during the first two weeks of
October, the Cardinal has failed
to come up with a victory in its
last four attempts.
Stanford's latest loss was to
San Diego State. The No. 15 Az
tecs shut out the Cardinal 4-0 at
Maloney Field Friday, dropping
Stanford to 7-7-3.
Both the conditions and play
were sloppy. While the rain
turned the field to mud, provid
ing very tough footing, neither
team was able to find its rhythm.
Both squads relied on individual
play, utilizing little strategy and
completing few offensive passes.
"We didn't play like the team
we can be," Stanford Coach Sam
Koch said.
Neither squad scored for the
first 42 minutes of the game.
With three minutes remaining in
the first half, San Diego State
was able to wrangle its way into
good scoring position, and Stan
ford goalie Chris Helling was
unable to stop Aztec midfielder
Kurt Lewis' strike. A minute
and-a-half later forward Gerardo
Jimenez answered his

teammate's score with one of his
own. sending the Cardinal into
halftime with a 2-0 deficit.
Returning to the field without
leading scorer Chris Porch, who
was injured in the first half, Stan
ford regained some of its form for
the early part of the second pe
riod. In the first 10 minutes the
Cardinal found its offense and
took five shots on goal. Hut none
were accurate, and the squad's
offensive teamwork disintegrated
before Stanford was able to
score.
The Cardinal's strategy of
stopping dangerous Aztec for
wards Eric Wynalda and Kyle
Wittemore was ineffective as
each added goals during the
second half. Wynalda scored 11
minutes into the period, and Wit
temore's accurate shot made the
score 4-0.
"San Diego is a tough team,"
Koch said. "They played hard
and took it to us."
Even though Stanford outshot
the A/tecs 15 to 9, the squad was
unable to score. "We had some
great chances at the beginning of
the second half." Koch said.
"The score could have been 2-2.
We gave away two goals."
Although Stanford feels it
played at a level comparable to
