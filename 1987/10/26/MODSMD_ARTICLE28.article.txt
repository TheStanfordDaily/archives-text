# Offense lifts Cardinal past 49ers
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Stanford water polo is once again swimming in
the right direction, and not a moment too soon.
With a 9-6 victory over visiting Long Beach State
Friday afternoon, the defending NCAA champions
ended a scoring slump that had cost the Cardinal
three of its last five games. The scoring spree also
proved to Stanford players and opponents alike that
this year s Cardinal is still capable of scoring well
against the nation's best teams.
With the win, third-ranked Stanford improved its
record to 14-4 and generated some of the momen
tum it will need to establish itself at or near the top
of the national rankings as the NCAA champion
ships (Nov. 27-29) approach.
Although Stanford played an inconsistent game
that at times brought back unfavorable memories of
recent losses to USC and California, the Cardinal
played one of its better overall games since the be
ginning of the season.
"1 think we're happy with the way we were
playing," senior Erich Fischer said. "At times, it
was frustrating; it seemed like we were reverting to
the way we were playing before. But I think at times
we showed that we do have a powerful offense and
that we can get it in gear."
Fischer recorded his second consecutive hat trick
(three goals), leading a balanced scoring attack that
included two goals by senior Grant Stanley and
junior Andrew Lawson, as well as one goal each
from junior Jeff Oeding and senior Matt Tingler.
"I don't think we had quite as many good drives
today as we did against USC (last Saturday), but we
had more counterattacks, " Fischer said. "When
you're countering like that, you're getting good


fridav *' a,t ' ' nß ' cr * H ' ,h wne K ° al, he, P td Stanford regain its earlv-season^form
shots, but you're not going to be
able to set up your front-court of
fense. If you miss the shot,
you're back on defense. So I
think we didn't have as many op
portunities to set up a front-court
offense today because our
counter was pretty strong."
Meanwhile, No. 6 Long Beach
State showed no transition game
at all and relied, as it has all
season, on 6-foot-K junior Kyle
Kopp to keep it in the game. In
the first half, Kopp scored both
49er goals to keep Long Beach
within one score of the Cardinal.
The first goal came when Stan
ley finished off a blistering
Tingler counterattack with a
quick, accurate shot. For the rest
of the first quarter, while the Car

dinal offense floundered, the
defense held Long Beach score
less. Goalie Obi Greenman was
particularly impressive, deflect
ing a number of early 49er shots.
Kopp scored early in the
second quarter on a four-meter
penalty shot to even the count at
1-1, and scored another to end
the half, while the Cardinal
scored on only two of many op
portunities.
Kopp went on to score two
more in the second half, but
could not keep up with Stanford.
The Cardinal started to find the
back of the cage more consis
tently as the game went on.
Lawson, Stanford's third
leading scorer, was impressive in
the third quarter, scoring both
Cardinal goals as play around
both cages became physical. Be
cause of loose officiating, each
team fouled repeatedly to try to
stop Fischer and Kopp. Neither

team, however, had much suc
cess with this strategy.
"We're having a little problem
fouling the two-meter man
sometimes. With (Kopp] in there
you could see evidence of that,"
sophomore Erik Blum said.
"He's a big guy. You have to
foul him before the ball gets
there. We're still working on
that."
The Cardinal defense effec
tively shut down the rest of the
49er offense, however, and held
up Kopp long enough for Stan
ford to jump out to 7-3 fourth
quarter lead.
The Cardinal was at its best on
the fast break, as exemplified by
Tingler's tally early in the fourth
period. Tingler raced wide open
down the pool, received a pass
from teammate Steve Millham
and casually lobbed the ball over
49er goalie Bennie Sprague.
