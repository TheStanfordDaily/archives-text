### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Reggie Jackson, step down. Your
days as Mr. October are over.
Jackson, who earned the nickname
for his great play in postseason
baseball games, may have to give the
label to the Stanford women's volley
ball team.
With wins at both Washington and
Washington State this weekend, the
Cardinal is now 10-0 in the month of
October and 18-3 on the season.
Friday night the fifth-ranked Cardi
nal defeated the Huskies, 15-11, 8-15.
15-4, 15-10. Saturday, the Cougars fell
to the Cardinal in three straight games.
15-5, 16-14, 15-13. Stanford remains
atop the Pacific 10 Conference with a
10-1 mark.
Washington State is now 12-15, 1-10
in the Pac-10, and Washington is 16-8,
3-8 in conference play after losing to
California Saturday.
Stanford Coach Don Shaw didn't
think his squad was in top form but
placed much of the blame on extenuat
ing circumstances.
"We had a few people sick . . . land)
those road trips really take their toll,"
he said. "We didn't play our very best,
but we played all right. It worked out
all right."
Sophomore outside hitter Lara

Aspcr agreed. "I don't think we played
as well as we're capable of playing,"
she said.
One big reason Stanford didn't play
up to snuff was that the Cardinal flew
to Washington Friday afternoon, only
hours before the match.
"I think that had a little bit of an ef
fect, Asper said. "We were just a
little bit off, one step slow . . . [but] we
are coming through when we need to."
The pair of victories, Stanford's 10th
in its last 10 tries against the Washing
ton schools, ran the Cardinal winning
streak to 13, one short of the school
record set during the first 14 matches of
1985. Over this year's streak. Stanford
has a record of 39games won, five lost.
Friday night's match showcased a
Washington team that is considerably
better than last year's NCAA
qualifying squad. Unfortunately for the
Huskies, every other team in the Pac
-10 is also significantly better than last
year. Washington is down in eighth
place in the conference.
The Huskies did put up a gotni fight,
however, winning a game against the
red-hot Cardinal. The telling statistic,
though, was that Washington was held
to a . 164 hitting percentage by the Stan
ford defense, while the Cardinal hit
.234.
Leading the way was senior middle
blocker Nancy Reno with 22 kills. She

was helped by fellow senior outside hit
ter Teresa Smith, who had 13 kills.
Also chipping in were junior middle
blocker Laura Olesen and Asper, each
of whom had nine kills. Olesen also had
10 blocks to stifle the Husky attack,
while Asper added seven.
"They played really well," Shaw
said. "Washington had a really good
match (in pushing the Cardinal)."
"They came up with a lot of balls,"
Asper said. "It was frustrating for us."
I he next night, at Washington State,
was also surprisingly tough tor a while.
The Cougars are mired in ninth place in
the league and were not supposed to
provide a big obstacle to the Cardinal.
Washington State put up a good
fight, however, keeping the outcome of
the last two games up in the air until the
very end.
"I think they're a much improved
team since the last time we played
them, Asper said.
Once again, the key was Stanford's
defense, which allowed the Cardinal to
outhit the Cougars .203 to .096. On the
other hand, the Stanford offense was
led b\ sophomore outside hitter Jenny
Chaffee with 13 kills. Reno and Olesen
also pitched in. tallying 11 apiece.
The matches against lesser competi
tion have caught the Cardinal a bit off
