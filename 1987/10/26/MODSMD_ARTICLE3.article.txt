# New alcohol policy tested

The new Stanford Stadium al
chohol policy, implemented for
the first time at Saturday's foot
ball game, appears to have been a
success, according to University
officials and members of the Stu
dent Alchohol Task Force.
The new policy, established
last week by the Student Alcohol
Task Force, placed student ush
ers in the stands during the game
and limited the amount of alcohol
allowed into the stadium to one
six-pack per person.

Those carrying alcohol into the
stadium were required to prove
they were at least 21 years old.
Norm Robinson, associate
dean of Student Affairs, said the
crowd behavior at the game
"looked just fine." He also said
the current alchohol policy at the
stadium should remain in effect
"as long as their are no more
problems." He said that Stanford
will not judge the success of the
alcohol policy on the basis of
"one good game," but on the
continuing "vigilance" of the
students regarding responsible

drinking.
Commenting on fan behavior
at the game, Athletic Director
Andy Geiger said. "Things went
well."
Senior Dave Smolen, a mem
ber of the task force, said early
feedback from University admin
istrators was positive.
"President Kennedy said if the
policy continues to succeed, it
would be quite a coup for stu
dents," Smolen said.
According to Smolen, " The
new policy will remain in effect,
as far as I know."
The decision to appoint stu
dent ushers, some of whom were
picked to watch over students in
their own dormitories and frater
nities, came under tire last week
from students in Florence Moore
Hall.
Residents claimed that such a
policy unfairly burdens one stu
dent with responsibility for a
group's actions.
"Everything went smoothly at
the game," said Council of Presi
dents member Maria Canas, who
is also a member of the task
force.
Responding to student
criticism of the ushers, Canas
said, "Everybody keeps calling
them (the ushers) 'monitors,' but

they weren't policing. They were
just supposed to look out for
trouble. Policing is different.
They are not legally responsible
for anything."
Canas said some of the
monitors workirtg at the game
were members of club sports
teams who were paid by the Ath
letic Department. If a club sport
team can provide 25 people to
usher at a game, they will be paid
$500, Canas said.
The women's softball team,
the fencing team and some stu
dents from the ASSU acted as
ushers for Saturday's game.
Despite the fact that several
living groups did not appoint ush
ers, Smolen said the policy was
"absolutely successful." He at
tributed the failure of some
groups to appoint ushers to
apathy and to critisicm of the
policy by Florence Moore stu
dents last week.

Robinson said he has no objec
tion to dorms and fraternities
refusing to appoint ushers if
those houses take collective re
sponsibility for their behavior.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity
Resident Assistant Robert
Bentley observed that "the
crowd was quieter and well
behaved." Bentley said he
thought the reason the crowd
was better behaved was that
"there wasn't nearly as much al
cohol. It was definitely the
policy."
Rinconada RA Dave Adams
said that when a nearby group
started spraying beer, the
group's appointed usher asked
him if he was being bothered.
The usher then got his group to
stop.
Adams said his dorm did not
have a self-appointed usher be
cause "our dorm wasn't drink
ing."
