They went, they played, they faltered.
The Stanford women's soccer team traveled east
on a three-game road trip and came away humbled
by three losses. The 3-9-3 Cardinal lost to North
Colorado 2-0 Friday, then went down by the same
margin against Colorado College Saturday and fi
nally was defeated, again 2-0, at George Washing
ton yesterday.
Stanford was crippled even before it left home.
Senior midfield stalwart Amy Geisse remained here
because of an injury. Freshman midfielder Jenny
Bloomer became ill during the trip. To add to the
Cardinal's woes, starting sophomore goalkeeper
Vija Brookshire quit the team.
Travel-weary and short-handed, Stanford played
lethargically against North Colorado, never really
establishing a good scoring thrust. The loss was
disappointing in light of the fact that the players felt
they were the more talented team, but lacked the
energy to win.
"We were flat," freshman halfback Denise Den
ney said. "We missed Amy Geisse, and the travel
ing wore on us. We were just dead."

"The altitude was a problem," freshman
midfielder Lisa Sime said. "In the second halt, we
were dragging."
North Colorado improved to 5-6-3 with the win.
The next day, it was off to third-ranked Colorado
College. In a game that was a mismatch on paper,
Stanford rose to the occasion to make it reasonably
close.
"We play great against great teams, Sime said.
The Cardinal used the Catanaccio formation
against Colorado College in an attempt to prevent
the high-powered Tiger attack from scoring.
Having five defenders helped keep the Colorado of
fense in check, but the defensive tactic may have
backfired, with Stanford unable to produce any
goals on offense. In fact, the Cardinal failed to
score at all during the trip.
"We just couldn't generate offense," Denney
said.
George Washington supposedly was less talented
than Stanford, but again, the tired and frustrated
Cardinal struggled.
"We just sat back and hoped things would hap
pen," sophomore fullback Michelle Zimney said.
Stanford will try to halt its skid when it hosts St.
Mary s Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Maloney Held.
