# Twins beat Cards again, win Series
## 
### 
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The
Minnesota Twins rode the deter
mination of Frank Viola and the
decibels of the Dome to their first
World Series championship by
beating the St. Louis Cardinals 4-
2 in Game 7 last night, becoming
the first team to win tour home
games.
The Twins, with the best home
record in baseball, won each
game in their own park. They
rallied in the final two games, and
Greg Gagne's infield single with
two outs and the bases loaded in
the sixth inning put them ahead
to stay.
Viola, who won Game 1 and
lost Game 4, settled down after
allowing two runs in the second
inning. He gave up only two
more hits through eight innings
and denied St. Louis its 10th
title.
Viola gave up six hits, struck
out seven and didn't walk a bat
ter before giving way to Jeff
Reardon. Viola was named Most
Valuable Player, but the team's
most important ingredient again
was the Metrodome.
The Cardinals, the top road
team in the majors, were
swallowed up by a raucous
record crowd of 55,376. A couple
ol controversial calls by umpires
at first base — which haunted St.
Louis in 1985 — and some
maneuvers by Manager Whitey
Herzog that went wrong left the
crippled Cardinals one game
short.
I his was the first Series in
which the home team won every
game, and it came in a season in
which the Twins were nearly in

vincible at the Metrodome. They
finished 62-25, including three
routs over St. Louis.
The Twins became the l()th
different team to win the Series
in 10 years. They scored 72 runs
in beating Detroit in the playoffs
and then St. Louis, the most ever
scored by a club in the
postseason.
Minnesota also managed to
overcome the Cardinals' success
in do-or-die situations. St. Louis
is now 8-3 in Game 7s. still the
most victories by any team in
seventh games.
Danny Cox, pitching on two
days' rest and in relief for the
first time since 1984, walked Tom
Brunansky and Kent Hrbek
leading off the sixth with the
score 2-2. That finished Cox,
who failed to retire any of the
five batters he faced, and he was
ejected by home-plate umpire
Dave Phillips as he exited. That
brought back more memories of
1985, when Cardinals pitcher
Joaquin Andujar was tossed from
Game 7, in which Kansas City
routed St. Louis 11-0.
Todd Worrell walked pinch
hitter Roy Smalley, playing on
his 35th birthday, before striking
out Dan Gladden with the bases
loaded for the second out. Gagne
followed with a sharp grounder
that third baseman Tom Lawless
backhanded, and Gagne beat the
one-hop throw to first.
I'he Twins, whose starting
lineup outhomered St. Louis'
183-32, scored an insurance run
in the eighth when Tim Laudner
singled and came home on Glad
den's double.
