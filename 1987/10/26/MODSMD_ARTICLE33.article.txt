# Stanford 2-1 at Cal Invitational
## 
### Chris Crader Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Participating at the California Invita
tional in Berkeley, the Stanford field
hockey team added to a successful
weekend for Cardinal athletics, coming
back from a 1-0 loss Friday at the
hands of San Jose State to beat Simon
Fraser 3-1 Saturday and shut out
Pacific yesterday 2-0.
The 12th-ranked Cardinal upped its
record to 10-4 for the year, remaining
5-0 in the Northern Pacific Conference.
Stanford started the tournament
slowly, losing in the rain to a Spartan
squad that it had defeated three weeks
earlier by a 2-1 margin. However, the
Cardinal soon regained the poise that
had carried the squad to a four-game
winning streak prior to the tournament.
"It was pouring," said midfielder
Alison Smith about Friday's game.
"Things weren't working out well for
us."
The Cardinal came back strong,
however, in its two other tournament
games. "On Saturday and Sunday we
played a lot better," Smith said.

"I think we've held our own consid
ering teams that play us are playing
their best games to heat us," said
junior midfielder Dana Fleming, a
Kelowna, British Columbia, native.
"Every team that comes out to play us
comes out to beat us."

We are sitting in the
driver's seat right now. I
think we have the talent to
go beyond the regionals/

Simon Fraser was one of those deter
mined teams, but the Clan met its
match against the Cardinal. Fleming,
junior forward Kat Thomas and Smith,
a junior co-captain, each scored, com
bining with their teammates to out
shoot the British Columbians 26-16.
Thomas, second in the league in
goals last year, and Fleming were both
named to the 1986 All-NorPac team,
while Smith was a second-team All-
America selection and a member of the
21-and-under U.S. national team that

traveled to Canada this past summer.
Fleming continued to shine on the
astroturf field yesterday, scoring yet
another goal against the Tigers. Sopho
more forward Tracy Steiglitz recorded
the other score against NorPac foe
Pacific.
The artificial turf changes the com
plexion of the game, making it faster,
according to Smith. "Our game
(involving short, accurate passing) is
made for (artificial) turf,' she said. "It
takes a toll on your body, but # it cer
tainly helps our game."
However, since the Stanford Varsity
Hockey Field is natural grass, the Car
dinal's lack of experience on astroturf
may have caused some problems
against San Jose State.
Stanford has three league games
remaining, and if the Cardinal holds on
to claim the conference crown, it will
earn its third consecutive NCAA
playoff berth. "If we play well and play
hard, we should go to the nationals,"
Fleming said. "But anything can hap
pen.
"We're sitting in the driver's seat
right now. I think we have the talent to
go beyond regionals," she said.
