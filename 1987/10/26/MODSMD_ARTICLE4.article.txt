# Big Game
## Rally gets axe 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
The traditional Friday night
Big Game Rally on the San Fran
cisco waterfront will not be held
this year due to difficulty in ob
taining the $1 million insurance
policy required by city authori
ties, according to Axe Commit
tee Chairman Tom Smegal.
Though the Rally has been
held for the past 10 years, there
have been problems since 1983,
when a number of students were
injured by a motorist. Last year,
the Rally was held in Aquatic
Park, but the march portion of
the event had to be cancelled,
also because of insurance prob
lems.
The San Francisco Board of
Supervisors and the Port Author
ity require that a $1 million insur
ance policy be obtained in order
for the event to take place. The
Axe Committee learned, through
a large Bay Area insurance bro
ker, that no underwriter would
cover the event.
"We had to make a decision to
give dorms and living groups
time to plan their activities,"
Smegal said. "There was just no
chance that we were going to find
the insurance coverage and have
enough lead time to make the ne
cessary arrangements." Smegal
said he hoped that plans for any
alternative to the Rally could be
developed by the end of the
week.
Band manager Todd Olson ad
mitted he was "definitely disap
pointed" by the cancellation of
the Rally but said he hoped "we
can come up with an alterna
tive."
Olson said there was no one to
blame for the inability to get in
surance. "If 1 were an insurance
executive, I'd have a hard time
insuring a rally like this," he
said.
Last year, uncertainty about
the availability of insurance led
to a lengthy delay in announcing
plans for the Rally. "One of the
problems last year was that we
dragged (the process! out,"
Smegal said. He added that this

year's decision was made early
because "it's really unfair to
keep the students in limbo to the
last minute."
Rob Eno, vice chairman of" the
Axe Committee, explained that if
the decision had not been made
shortly, dorms would have been
unable to make proper arrange
ments for buses to bring people
to the rally site.
When the Axe Committee
learned last year that it could ac
quire a $500,000 insurance
policy, it went ahead with plans
to hold the Rally without the
traditional march along the Em
barcadero.
This year the committee
decided that a similar plan was
unwise. "We wanted $1,000,000
so we could have a march,"
Smegal said. "[The insurers]
didn't say we could have
$500,000 for the Rally. Had they
done so, we would have though
about it."
Smegal added, however, that
last year's Rally without the
march was not very well received
by students. The committee
probably would have cancelled
the Rally even if the option was
available again, he said.
Smegal stressed that the deci
sion was not made hastily. "We
were well on our way to making
plans for this year's event, even
with the possibility of a Union
Square Rally," he said.
The University of Southern
California holds a rally in Union
Square each year when the
Trojans travel north to play Stan
ford or UC-Berkeley.
Jon Erickson, faculty adviser
to the Axe Committee, said USC
is able to hold their event be
cause of their proximity to Union
Square. Since USC students stay
in hotels near the square, they do
not need to obtain insurance for a
march.
According to Erickson, Stan
ford could not hold a similar rally
even if it wanted to because
buses would have to be parked
somewhere outside of Union
Square and the City would con
sider the walk from the buses to
the square as a march.
