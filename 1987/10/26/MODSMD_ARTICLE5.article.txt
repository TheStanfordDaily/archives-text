# Ties to Hoover run deep
## Stanford and Hoover share endowments, archives 
### Joe Metcalfe Staff writer 
This article is the second in a
series on the relationship be
tween the Hoover Insitution and
Stanford. The next installment
will appear one week from today.

When the Stanford Board of
Trustees redefined the Hoover
Institution almost 30 years ago as
"an independent institution
within the frame of Stanford Uni
versity," Hoover was a think
tank of but modest influence and

funding.
Much has changed since then,
but the confusion surrounding
the 1959 resolution remains. To
those unfamiliar with Hoover
and Stanford, the 1959 definition
may appear to be less than com
plete.
The ties that bind Hoover and
Stanford, however, are signifi
cant and have a profound influ
ence on the behavior of both in
stitutions.
The fact that the three build
ings comprising the Hoover Insti
tution — the Hoover Tower, the

Herbert Hoover Memorial Build
ing and the Lou Henry Hoover
Building — sit at the center of
campus is of course the most
visible link between the institu
tions.
In addition, approximately
three-fourths of Hoover's total
endowment is mixed with the
University's investments. Before
the dramatic plunge in the stock
market last week, Hoover's en
dowment was estimated at worth
over $ 1(H) million.
According to Hoover's 1986
annual report, Stanford contrib
uted 27 percent of Hoover's
$12.7 million budget. Charles
Palm, head librarian and ar
chivist at Hoover, said all of this
money goes to library and ar
chive purchases.
Indeed, the 1.6 million-volume
Hoover library is responsible for
several important "collecting
areas," in accordance with the
Stanford Collection Policy State
ment. This document coordi
nates the acquisition policies of
the various libraries on campus.
As an academic resource, the
Hoover library is valuable to
Stanford. Its collections — espe
cially those covering East Asia,
Western Europe, Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union —
make up a significant part of the
University's total of 5.4 million
books. Hoover's archives repre
sent 72 percent of Stanford's
total archival material.
More controversial than
shared libraries, however, has
been the issue of fund raising.
Various large Stanford con
tributors also have ties with
Hoover, prompting some to ar
gue that Hoover receives money
that would otherwise go to Stan
ford.
"[Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell] raises money by warn
ing people not to give their
money to those 'radicals' at Stan
ford," one unnamed University
offical said recently in an inter
view with the Los Angeles
Times.
Campbell denies this charge,
maintaining that Stanford's fund
raising efforts are in fact helped
by the institution's close ties to
donating foundations, corpora

tions and individuals, and that
Hoover "can take part of the
credit" for some of the money
that goes to Stanford.
In addition to financial issues,
Hoover is also connected to
Stanford by joint faculty appoint
ments and the recruitment of fel
lows and professors.

Recruitment for both Stanford
and Hoover is aided by their
mutual ties, according to various
sources, including Sanford
Dornbusch, professor of human
biology, sociology and educa
tion.
Dornbusch, who chaired a
committee in 1985 that addressed
the question of cooperation be
tween Stanford and Hoover, now
emphasizes that "there are loads
of people who would not be at
Hoover if it wasn't part of Stan
ford. There are people who are at
Stanford because of the availabil
ity of the resources at Hoover."
The significance of this factor
in terms of recruitment is difficult
to gauge. Without a doubt,
however, there have been cases
where this consideration was of
primary importance,"
Dornbusch said.
"(The joint appointments be
tween Hoover and Stanford]
change the people who are here
and the activities of the Univer
sity," Dornbusch said.
Although in recent years there
has been greater cooperation in
terms of joint appointments, such
cases are still the exception.
Many students are still discour
aged by the relative isolation of

Hoover and the fact that many of
its fellows do not teach.
University President Donald
Kennedy maintained that since
Hoover fellows normally do not
teach, there is "a somewhat
lower level of interaction with
the students."
Stanford student Subodh
Chandra, chair of the Stanford
Democrats, said Hoover fellows
fail to adequately provide an
open forum where ideas can he
challenged.
Criticism also springs from the
fact that Hoover, due to its rela
tive independence from Stan
ford, is not widely understood by
individuals here and off-campus.
And as Stanford continues to
gain national prominence, the
distinction between it and
Hoover is often blurred because
of the confusing nature of the re
lationship.
Stacey Leyton, deputy chair of
the ASSU Senate, claimed that
"a lot of people simply do not
know that much" about Hoover.
This confusion would matter
little if Hoover was a public
policy research institution of
modest influence. But today the
institution enjoys widespread
recognition. Its influence has
grown considerably since Ronald
Reagan, an honorary fellow at
Hoover, was elected president.
The fact that Hoover is com
monly thought of as a conserva
tive think tank compounds prob
lems considerably.
This perception, along with the
assumed link between Hoover
and Stanford, leads many to
criticize the institution for its ef
fect on the University's reputa
tion.
Editor and Publisher magazine


A Delicate
Balance
recently reported that Hoover
based opinion pieces were pub
lished in 375 newspapers and
periodicals around the country
during the 1986-87 academic
year. Most of these articles listed
the author as being a fellow at the
Hoover Institution at Stanford
University, adding to the confu
sion over the formal separation
between the institutions.
Some within the University
complain that when Hoover fel
lows serving on various boards,
committees and panels through
out the country are introduced,
Stanford's name is mentioned as
if Hoover were a part of the Uni
versity.
Political Science Prof. John
Manley, an outspoken critic of
Hoover, questions whether the
University's name should be
used in association with
Hoover s. "People will attempt
to make links" between the two
institutions, he said.
