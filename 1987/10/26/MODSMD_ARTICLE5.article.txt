# Ties to Hoover run deep
## Stanford and Hoover share endowments, archives

This article is the second in a
series on the relationship be
tween the Hoover Insitution and
Stanford. The next installment
will appear one week from today.

When the Stanford Board of
Trustees redefined the Hoover
Institution almost 30 years ago as
"an independent institution
within the frame of Stanford Uni
versity," Hoover was a think
tank of but modest influence and

funding.
Much has changed since then,
but the confusion surrounding
the 1959 resolution remains. To
those unfamiliar with Hoover
and Stanford, the 1959 definition
may appear to be less than com
plete.
The ties that bind Hoover and
Stanford, however, are signifi
cant and have a profound influ
ence on the behavior of both in
stitutions.
The fact that the three build
ings comprising the Hoover Insti
tution — the Hoover Tower, the

Herbert Hoover Memorial Build
ing and the Lou Henry Hoover
Building — sit at the center of
campus is of course the most
visible link between the institu
tions.
In addition, approximately
three-fourths of Hoover's total
endowment is mixed with the
University's investments. Before
the dramatic plunge in the stock
market last week, Hoover's en
dowment was estimated at worth
over $ 1(H) million.
