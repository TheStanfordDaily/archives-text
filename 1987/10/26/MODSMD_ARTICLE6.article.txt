# Governor attacks media

### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
New Hampshire governor John Sununu
criticized the media's power to influence presiden
tial elections in an informal speech to more than 50
students and parents in the Donner lounge I riday
afternoon.
The three-term Republican, visiting Stanford for
Parents' Weekend, decried the media's penchant to
"swarm like a group of pirahnas after a chunk of
meat" when reporting stories of potential character
flaws in candidates.
"Are we going to have a system in the United
States where everybody who runs has to publicly
confess to everything they ever did?'' asked
Sununu.
Referring to former Democratic presidential can
didate Joseph Hiden — who dropped out of the race
when it was revealed that he had on several occa
sions used quotes without attributing their source
— Sununu said the voters, and not the media,
should have dictated Hiden's fate.
Although he said the media has a responsibility
to report on candidates' mistakes, he said there is
"a character to the reporting that creates a gang

response mentality."' Candidates are forced from
the race in a matter of days, before the voters have
a chance to respond positively or negatively, he
said.
Sununu cautioned the crowd to "not take any
thing you read anywhere for granted. The media
has an inability to tell what is happening.
Speaking on New Hampshire's role in presiden
tial elections, Sununu reminded the predominately
freshman audience that "no candidate has been
elected president since 194 X without winning the
New Hampshire primary." The first in the nation.
New Hampshire's primary precedes the southern
primaries' "Super Tuesday'' by two weeks.
Although "Super Tuesday" has drawn much of
the early primary power to the South, Sununu
added that "we were encouraging this to happen,
because now nobody wants to go into Super rues
day' without first winning in New Hampshire.
Reflecting on New Hampshire's power in presi
dential primaries, the governor noted that in 1972
Ldmund Muskie received 55 percent of the primary
vote in New Hampshire but was dismissed as a
serious contender by the media. The press reported
that Muskie should have been ex
pected to receive more votes be
cause he was from Maine, a
neighboring state.
"We have transferred to the
press a great deal of power," he
said, "perhaps too much power.
The press does, to a great extent,
determine who gets elected in the
United States."
Although he openly supports
George Bush in the 1988 presi
dential race, Sununu willingly of
fered his opinion of the Demo
cratic contenders for the posi
tion. "The first-teamers such as
Bradley, Cuomo and Nunn have
decided that this is not a Demo
cratic year," he said.
Sununu compared the remain
ing candidates to a well-known

television wine advertisement
narrated by Orson Welles: "The
remaining Democrats are running
before their time," he said.
He singled out Albert Gore as
the only Democrat who had at
tempted to differentiate himself
from the rest of the pack.
When asked about former
Democratic Speaker of the
House Tip O'Neill's new book,
Sununu wondered aloud if the
book would be found in the fic
tion or non-fiction section of
bookstores. He also found time
to poke fun at New Hampshire's
rival to the south, Massachu
setts, calling it"The People's
Republic Across the Border."
A Ph.D. graduate of the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy, Sununu said he was
delighted to have a son at Stan
ford, and heavily praised the
campus. "1 may come back just
to visit the Bookstore," he said.
