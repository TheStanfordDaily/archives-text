"Must be for the parents!"
sophomore Mike Scott said
Thursday after noticing that the
fountain in Lagunita Court had
been turned on for the first time
in weeks.
The gurgling fountain in
Lagunita Court was only one of
many tell-tale signs that Stan
ford's annual Parents' Week
end had arrived.
"We had about 2000 parents
registered for the weekend."
student volunteer organizer

Wendy Zubrick said yesterday.
"We worked with the Alumni
Association to coordinate our
events together so that we
could handle all the parents.'
Several class reunions, spon
sored by the Alumni Associa
tion, were also held over the
weekend.
"We've been getting ready
for Parents' Weekend since De
cember of the previous year,
said Deborah Duncan, director
of the Parents' Annual Fund,
the group that sponsored the
event.

The visiting parents had a full
three-day schedule, attending
receptions and dinners in the
dorms, the football game on
Saturday and lectures given by
distinguished University fac
ulty.
University President Donald
Kennedy addressed the parents
in a Saturday morning speech
in the Inner Quad.
He reviewed Stanford's
short- and long-term goals.

Hungry parents try to gel their money's worth at a Saturday morning brunch in the Inner Quad. The
brunch was one of many events parents attended during Parents' Weekend.
