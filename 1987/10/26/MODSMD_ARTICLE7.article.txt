"Must be for the parents!"
sophomore Mike Scott said
Thursday after noticing that the
fountain in Lagunita Court had
been turned on for the first time
in weeks.
The gurgling fountain in
Lagunita Court was only one of
many tell-tale signs that Stan
ford's annual Parents' Week
end had arrived.
"We had about 2000 parents
registered for the weekend."
student volunteer organizer

Wendy Zubrick said yesterday.
"We worked with the Alumni
Association to coordinate our
events together so that we
could handle all the parents.'
Several class reunions, spon
sored by the Alumni Associa
tion, were also held over the
weekend.
"We've been getting ready
for Parents' Weekend since De
cember of the previous year,
said Deborah Duncan, director
of the Parents' Annual Fund,
the group that sponsored the
event.

The visiting parents had a full
three-day schedule, attending
receptions and dinners in the
dorms, the football game on
Saturday and lectures given by
distinguished University fac
ulty.
University President Donald
Kennedy addressed the parents
in a Saturday morning speech
in the Inner Quad.
He reviewed Stanford's
short- and long-term goals.

noting that "we must look at the
future as if it is rushing up very
fast."
Kennedy also stressed the im
portance of quality undergradu
ate education and said Stanford
is working hard to revitalize the
arts and humanities on campus.
He also elaborated on his idea
for the creation of a Bay Area re
search agency to oversee the de
velopment of scientific research
facilities at area universities.
"Most of the buildings (at
Stanford) are unsuited for
modern research," Kennedy
said. He explained that he hopes
to see the creation of "a regional
plan for redoing that entire area
(scientific research)."
Freshman parents John and
Helen Evans said they enjoyed
their visit. "We were very im
pressed. . . . The whole thing
seemed really well organized,"
John Evans said.
Many parents also said the
weekend left them with positive

impressions of the University it
self. According to freshman par
ent Helen Rucker, "The atmos
phere (at Stanford) is great. . . .
It's really conducive to
study. . . . The University is im
portant for becoming a whole
person." Her husband, James
Rucker, added, "I think it's good
to let the students make their
own decisions. ... It will teach
him (his son) responsibility."
A freshman parent who identi
fied herself as Mrs. Guttierrez
said she was impressed with Po
litical Science Prof. Condoleeza
Rice, one of the faculty lecturers.
"She impressed me so
much. . . . She seems to have a
strong opinion on everything and
really seems intelligent."
Praising student volunteers
who took part in the weekend,
Zubrick said, "There weren't a
whole lot, but they really helped
us out. . . . One girl volunteered
because her parents weren't
coming this year, and she just
wanted to be around parents.
"It seems to have gone really
well," Zubrick said of the
weekend. "Most of the parents
say they really like things."
