China Communist congress opens
BEIJING — The most powerful men in China met yesterday
at the opening of a Communist Party congress that will endorse
policies and a new generation of younger leaders to steer this na
tion of more than 1 billion people into the 21st century.
The week-long gathering comes at a particularly crucial time
for China's leadership as it struggles against more orthodox
Marxist philosophies — and bureaucratic opposition — to give a
sense of permanency to the controversial economic and political
reforms it set in motion almost 10 years ago.
This congress, which normally takes places only once every
five years, will also probably be the last dominated by China's
83-year-old paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping. So the prelude to
this congress, the 13th, has stirred intense political jockeying
over the projected succession to power of a Deng protege, Zhao
Ziyang, currently premier and acting Communist Party chiet,
and the future of economic reforms that Deng and Zhao have
pioneered.
The economic reforms, far from complete, are designed to
transform a centralized, Soviet-model economic system into
one more responsive to market forces and the profit motive.
Within a decade, they have already markedly improved the
living standards of many ordinary Chinese.
Never before have the Chinese revealed so many details in
advance of such a congress, nor have they promised the foreign
press so much access to the proceedings.
Capitol Hill reconsiders war act
WASHINGTON — After 14 years of intense bickering over
the meaning of the War Powers Resolution, there finally appears
to be a growing consensus among Democrats and Republicans
in Congress that the controversial Vietnam-era law is un
workable and must either be clarified or repealed.
A desire to end the quarreling arises out of the current dispute
in Congress over how to respond to President Reagan's policy
of providing U.S. Navy escorts to 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers now
sailing the Persian Gulf under the American flag.
Although there is little doubt that recent clashes between
U.S. and Iranian forces in the gulf constitute "imminent hostili
ties," which technically trigger the War Powers Resolution, nei
ther the Democratic-controlled Congress nor the president is
willing to invoke the law. Reagan contends that the law is un
constitutional; many members of Congress view it as flawed.
Nor is it the first failure to invoke the War Powers Resolution
during a military crisis involving the United States. In fact, al
though the resolution has been on the books since 1973, it has
never been invoked in its purest form by Congress, and it has
never been willingly obeyed by any president.
"After 14 years in which every president from Nixon to
Reagan has refused to acknowledge the constitutionality of this
law — 14 years in which the law has failed to operate as en
visaged — a review is clearly called for," said Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Joseph Biden (D-Del.)
Fighting continues in Sri Lanka
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (DPA) — The bitter, bloody fighting
between Indian peace-keeping forces and Tamil separatist
rebels in the northern Sri Lankan capital of Jaffna entered its
third week yesterday with pockets of guerrilla resistance con
tinuing to frustrate a superior Indian force.
Sri Lankan state radio reports said that in the three weeks of
fighting 159 Indian troops had been killed and 554 wounded.
Guerrilla deaths were put at more than 650, with about 80 others
captured.
The Indian forces stepped up their offensive yesterday and Sri
Lankan President Junius Jayewardene claimed that the fighters
of the main rebel group, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
could not hold out much longer. The Tigers are fighting for a
separate state in the northeast region of Sri Lanka.
The state radio said yesterday that the Tigers' Jaffna military
commander, identified as Santhosan, and about 60 other guerril
las, were killed over the weekend when special units of the In
dian navy sank four guerrilla boats in the Jaffna lagoon. Military
sources said that the besieged guerrillas had apparently been
trying to escape from Jaffna city.
The state radio also said Indian troops had seized control of
the sprawling Jaffna campus, a stronghold of the guerrillas,
where up to 30 Indian paratroopers had been shot dead as they
were airdropped from a helicopter 12 days ago.
Dispute hurts UK-Ireland relations
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Britain and the Irish
Republic have become entangled in a potentially damaging
dispute about judicial reform in Northern Ireland that has com
plicated relations between the two countries and cast a cloud
over their two-year-old agreement to reduce religious strife in
the troubled province.
The differences, which center on the composition of Northern
Ireland's courts, constitute the first public display of tension be
tween the two countries since the Anglo-Irish agreement was
signed two years ago next month.
Ireland's leaders believe that Britain has failed to follow
through on a pledge to expand the Northern Ireland judiciary,
possibly including judges from Ireland. Britain maintains there
was no such commitment.
With the levels of intimidation in the province too high to per
mit jury trials, the composition of the judiciary takes on a spe
cial significance, especially for Roman Catholics, a minority in
Northern Ireland, who have traditionally mistrusted authority.
After meeting with Irish officials here last Wednesday, Brit
ain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Tom King, warned
that the differences could have what he called "very serious im
plications for relationships between our two countries."
Pope's trip leaves debts in wake
WASHINGTON — Pope John Paul II has been gone more
than a month, but he is anything but forgotten by the nine U.S.
cities and the Roman Catholic dioceses still paying the bills for
his 10-day visit.
Phoenix shelled out $86,000, more than three times what it
spent on last year's national Fiesta Bowl between Penn State
and Miami. San Antonio spent almost 10 times that amount, the
most it has ever paid for an event, including last year's Grand
Prix auto race.
Though the final tally may never be known, the papal stay
cost more than $32 million, or about $133,000 an hour, accord
ing to estimates compiled by church officials and public
agencies. About $20 million was borne by Catholic dioceses and
$12 million by local, state and federal governments who were re
sponsible for security, cleanup and, in several cities, transporta
tion.
Costs to employers who let people off work and expenses of
the almost 20,000 media representatives who covered the trip
were not included.
