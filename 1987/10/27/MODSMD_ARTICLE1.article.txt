# Drug test decision delayed
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
A decision in the NCAA drug
testing case, which was expected
this week, has been delayed until
next month to allow the judge
time to consider a new brief clari
fying the appeals process for ath
letes who fail drug tests.
Judge Conrad Rushing has re
quested that attorneys for the
National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation prepare a brief outlin
ing the extent of the NCAA's re
sponsibility to ensure a fair ap
peals process for atheletes who
test positive for drug use.
Attorney Susan Harriman,
representing Stanford athletes
Jennifer Hill and Barry
McKeever in their suit against
the NCAA drug-testing program,
predicted yesterday that it would
be a "couple of weeks" before a
ruling could be expected from the
Santa Clara County Superior
Court judge.
Stanford, a third party in the
case, has already submitted its
brief on the subject, as have the
plaintiffs. Debra Zumwalt, Stan
ford's attorney, declined to spec
ulate why the judge had re
quested more information after
the end of the hearings, which
concluded last week.
NCAA attorneys would not
comment on what their brief
might include.
During the hearings Zumwalt
and Harriman charged that the
NCAA had an insufficient ap
peals process for athletes who
failed drug tests.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
also attacked the NCAA's in
house appeals process, testifying
last week that the University had
not been notified of the possibil
ity of an appeal after the dis
qualification of two Stanford
football players before last Janu
ary's Gator Bowl.
