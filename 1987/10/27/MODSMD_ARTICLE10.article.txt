Reagan bans U.S. trade with Iran
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, citing Iran's
"continued and increasingly bellicose behavior," yesterday
banned all imports from the nation, including oil, and cut off vir
tually all U.S. exports to Iran.
The action was intended primarily as a symbolic gesture,
since U.S. and Iranian trade already is minimal. In August,
Iranian oil accounted for only 1 percent of U.S. crude oil im
ports.
But the White House said that it wanted to ensure that profits
from U.S. trade could not help Iran subsidize its war against
Iraq or its attacks on Persian Gulf shipping.
"Let me emphasize that we are taking these economic
measures only after repeated but unsuccessful attempts to
reduce tensions with Iran and in response to the continued and
increasingly bellicose behavior of the Iranian government,"
Reagan said in a statement.
From January through July, Iran's oil earnings from sales to
the United States were estimated to be $900 million, up from
$500 million throughout 1986.
Reagan's announcement came after recent missile attacks by
Iran that have damaged a U.S.-flagged oil tanker, other ships,
and Kuwaiti facilities at the northern end of the Gulf.
Lab mice produce human protein
WASHINGTON — Researchers, announcing a scientific
breakthrough, said yesterday that they have altered the genetic
makeup of laboratory mice to produce a human protein that
could be used to inexpensively treat heart attack victims.
The development poses the potential for a $1 billion drug in
dustry and would make it much cheaper and easier to
manufacture human proteins such as TPA, an anti-clotting agent
believed to prevent heart disorders, scientists say.
"This is something people have been talking about for years,
but this is the first demonstration that it can really work," Har
vey Bialy, research editor of the scientific journal "Bio-
Technology" in New York, said in a telephone interview. The
journal's November issue will outline the findings of the re
search, which was announced in a briefing by the project co
sponsors, the National Institutes for Health and Massachusetts
based Integrated Genetics Inc.
The breakthrough is "particularly timely" in light of recent
fears that the United States was lagging behind Europe in such
areas of genetic engineering, said Alan Smith, vice president of
Integrated Genetics.
U.S. may downgrade BraziFs debt
WASHINGTON — Federal regulators began meeting in se
cret yesterday to consider requiring U.S. banks to downgrade
some of the $22.4 billion in debt owed them by Brazil.
If the regulators decide some of the debt is worth less than the
full amount, banks would have to set aside money in a special
reserve to cover Brazilian loans that go bad. Such a move,
which would be on top of the general reserves banks keep for
potential loan losses, would depress bank earnings at a time of
great fragility in the financial markets.
It also would be the first time that the government has
declared that loans to a major debtor nation were worth less
than their face amount, or "value-impaired" in banking jargon.
Regulators have made those declarations in the past for such
smaller countries as Poland, Zaire and Nicaragua.
Altogether, Latin American nations owe their public and
private creditors nearly $400 billion.
However, experts said regulators, fearful of injecting more
uncertainty into the tumultuous financial markets, were likely to
bend over backward to avoid the downgrading.
"It would set a tremendous precedent in terms of a major deb
tor being classified as value-impaired at a time when there are
much bigger fishes in the pond," said Christine Bindert, senior
vice president of Shearson Lehman Bros. "This is not some
thing the market needs right now. We don't need any more bad
news."
Jury ready in Deaver perjury trial
WASHINGTON — A jury of four men and eight women was
impaneled yesterday for the trial of former White House aide
Michael Deaver, paving the way for testimony to begin in the
case after opening statements today by the prosecution and the
defense.
Deaver, 49, President Reagan's former deputy chief of staff,
sat at the defense table taking notes on a yellow legal pad as at
torneys made their final selections for the jury, which is mostly
middle-class and predominantly black. Screening of 100 poten
tial jurors had begun a week ago.
The jurors who were seated told U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson that they could lay aside any biases for or
against the policies of the Reagan administration in which
Deaver served from January 1981, until May 1985. All prospec
tive jurors also had been questioned about their attitudes toward
alcoholism, expected to be a key factor in Deaver's defense.
Deaver, who is charged with five counts of lying under oath
about his post-government lobbying activities, is expected to
claim that his memory of certain activities was clouded by ex
cessive drinking. Thus, his lawyers will argue, he never
deliberately tried to mislead a federal grand jury and a congres
sional subcommittee that investigated his business affairs last
year. With the new jurors excused from the courtroom, Jack
son late Monday sought to calm a simmering dispute over the
actions of Whitney North Seymour Jr., a court-appointed inde
pendent prosecutor, who recently wrote a harsh letter to try to
compel the testimony of Canadian Ambassador Allan Gotlieb as
a prosecution witness.
Desperate investor opens fire
MIAMI — A distraught investor hit by heavy stock market
losses opened fire yesterday at a Merrill Lynch office here, kil
ling the branch manager and critically wounding a broker before
fatally shooting himself in the head, police said.
Arthur Kane, 53, a Social Security claims examiner, was a
regular visitor to the brokerage office next to an upscale shop
ping center in suburban Miami. He seemed to be an easy-going,
good-humored man, Merrill Lynch employees said.
He was friends with most of the brokers and secretaries. He
enjoyed watching the display of up-to-date price quotations. He
often stayed after hours to socialize.
But Kane's amiability apparently was crushed in last week's
market's collapse. Shortly after 11 a.m., he entered an upstairs
office to meet with his longtime broker, Lloyd Kolokoff, and
branch manager Jose F. Argilagos.
Kane reportedly took a .357 revolver from his briefcase and
began to shoot. Witnesses recall five shots. Many bystanders
took shelter in a storage room or hid under their desks.
Confused brokers put clients on hold and dialed 911.
"This is so devastating!" lamented Kathy Abraham, who
runs the office's client service department.

tually all U.S. exports to Iran.
The action was intended primarily as a symbolic gesture,
since U.S. and Iranian trade already is minimal. In August,
Iranian oil accounted for only 1 percent of U.S. crude oil im
ports.
But the White House said that it wanted to ensure that profits
from U.S. trade could not help Iran subsidize its war against
Iraq or its attacks on Persian Gulf shipping.
"Let me emphasize that we are taking these economic
measures only after repeated but unsuccessful attempts to
reduce tensions with Iran and in response to the continued and
increasingly bellicose behavior of the Iranian government,"
Reagan said in a statement.
From January through July, Iran's oil earnings from sales to
the United States were estimated to be $900 million, up from
$500 million throughout 1986.
Reagan's announcement came after recent missile attacks by
Iran that have damaged a U.S.-flagged oil tanker, other ships,
and Kuwaiti facilities at the northern end of the Gulf.
Lab mice produce human protein
WASHINGTON — Researchers, announcing a scientific
breakthrough, said yesterday that they have altered the genetic
makeup of laboratory mice to produce a human protein that
could be used to inexpensively treat heart attack victims.
The development poses the potential for a $1 billion drug in
dustry and would make it much cheaper and easier to
manufacture human proteins such as TPA, an anti-clotting agent
believed to prevent heart disorders, scientists say.
"This is something people have been talking about for years,
but this is the first demonstration that it can really work," Har
vey Bialy, research editor of the scientific journal "Bio-
Technology" in New York, said in a telephone interview. The
journal's November issue will outline the findings of the re
search, which was announced in a briefing by the project co
sponsors, the National Institutes for Health and Massachusetts
based Integrated Genetics Inc.
The breakthrough is "particularly timely" in light of recent
fears that the United States was lagging behind Europe in such
areas of genetic engineering, said Alan Smith, vice president of
Integrated Genetics.
U.S. may downgrade BraziFs debt
WASHINGTON — Federal regulators began meeting in se
cret yesterday to consider requiring U.S. banks to downgrade
some of the $22.4 billion in debt owed them by Brazil.
If the regulators decide some of the debt is worth less than the
full amount, banks would have to set aside money in a special
reserve to cover Brazilian loans that go bad. Such a move,
which would be on top of the general reserves banks keep for
potential loan losses, would depress bank earnings at a time of
great fragility in the financial markets.
It also would be the first time that the government has
declared that loans to a major debtor nation were worth less
than their face amount, or "value-impaired" in banking jargon.
Regulators have made those declarations in the past for such
smaller countries as Poland, Zaire and Nicaragua.
Altogether, Latin American nations owe their public and
private creditors nearly $400 billion.
However, experts said regulators, fearful of injecting more
uncertainty into the tumultuous financial markets, were likely to
bend over backward to avoid the downgrading.
"It would set a tremendous precedent in terms of a major deb
tor being classified as value-impaired at a time when there are
much bigger fishes in the pond," said Christine Bindert, senior
vice president of Shearson Lehman Bros. "This is not some
thing the market needs right now. We don't need any more bad
news."
Jury ready in Deaver perjury trial
WASHINGTON — A jury of four men and eight women was
impaneled yesterday for the trial of former White House aide
Michael Deaver, paving the way for testimony to begin in the
case after opening statements today by the prosecution and the
defense.
Deaver, 49, President Reagan's former deputy chief of staff,
sat at the defense table taking notes on a yellow legal pad as at
torneys made their final selections for the jury, which is mostly
middle-class and predominantly black. Screening of 100 poten
tial jurors had begun a week ago.
The jurors who were seated told U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson that they could lay aside any biases for or
against the policies of the Reagan administration in which
Deaver served from January 1981, until May 1985. All prospec
tive jurors also had been questioned about their attitudes toward
alcoholism, expected to be a key factor in Deaver's defense.
Deaver, who is charged with five counts of lying under oath
about his post-government lobbying activities, is expected to
claim that his memory of certain activities was clouded by ex
cessive drinking. Thus, his lawyers will argue, he never
deliberately tried to mislead a federal grand jury and a congres
sional subcommittee that investigated his business affairs last
year. With the new jurors excused from the courtroom, Jack
son late Monday sought to calm a simmering dispute over the
actions of Whitney North Seymour Jr., a court-appointed inde
pendent prosecutor, who recently wrote a harsh letter to try to
compel the testimony of Canadian Ambassador Allan Gotlieb as
a prosecution witness.
Desperate investor opens fire
MIAMI — A distraught investor hit by heavy stock market
losses opened fire yesterday at a Merrill Lynch office here, kil
ling the branch manager and critically wounding a broker before
fatally shooting himself in the head, police said.
Arthur Kane, 53, a Social Security claims examiner, was a
regular visitor to the brokerage office next to an upscale shop
ping center in suburban Miami. He seemed to be an easy-going,
good-humored man, Merrill Lynch employees said.
He was friends with most of the brokers and secretaries. He
enjoyed watching the display of up-to-date price quotations. He
often stayed after hours to socialize.
But Kane's amiability apparently was crushed in last week's
market's collapse. Shortly after 11 a.m., he entered an upstairs
office to meet with his longtime broker, Lloyd Kolokoff, and
branch manager Jose F. Argilagos.
Kane reportedly took a .357 revolver from his briefcase and
began to shoot. Witnesses recall five shots. Many bystanders
took shelter in a storage room or hid under their desks.
Confused brokers put clients on hold and dialed 911.
"This is so devastating!" lamented Kathy Abraham, who
runs the office's client service department.
