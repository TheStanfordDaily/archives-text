# Market falls sharply again
## 
### 
NEW YORK — Jarred by headlong dives
in markets from Hong Kong to London and a
new wave of forced sales by individual inves
tors, prices on jittery U.S. stock markets
plunged again yesterday in very heavy
trading.
The widely followed Dow Jones average of
30 blue-chip stocks lost 156.83 points, or 8.04
percent or its value, to close at 1793.93. That
point drop was the index's second worst —
after the 508-point crash of a week earlier —
since the index took on its current format fol
lowing World War Lin percentage terms, the
slide was the indicator's sixth worst.
Trading volume on the New York Stock
Exchange rose to 308.82 million shares from
Friday's 245.56 million, even though trading
was halted two hours early on both days to
permit overwhelmed brokerages to catch up
on paperwork. The exchange said yesterday
that it will continue the shortened trading
hours, originally scheduled to end today,
through Friday.
The American Stock Exchange and the Na
tional Association of Securities Dealers,
which operates the over-the-counter stock

market, said that they would match the Big
Board's truncated hours.
American investors appeared to be
spooked Monday by sharp drops in markets
overseas. It was the obverse of last week s
crash, which began in New York and then m
ved to foreign exchanges. Yesterday, before
the New York markets had opened, the
Tokyo Stock Exchange's 225-share Nikkei
stock average fell 1096.22 points, or 4.7 per
cent, in its third-worst point loss ever. In
London, the Financial l imes Index of 100
leading shares fell 111.1 points to 1684.1, a
loss of 6.2 percent.
The worst percentage loss was in tiny
Hong Kong, where authorities had closed the
stock exchange from Tuesday through Friday
in a fruitless attempt to stem a wave of sel
ling. When the exchange reopened Monday
after its four-day shutdown, the accumulated
anxiety of investors drove its Hang Seng in
dex down 1120.70 points, or 33 percent — by
far its biggest one-day drop ever.
Observers said that the foreign markets
were jittery about the worldwide implications
of a serious recession in the United States.
Investors here and abroad appeared to be

unmoved by the start of deficit-reduction
talks between President Reagan and congres
sional leaders that were called after last
week's market panic.
Adding to the pressure on U.S. markets
yesterday was a near-record tide of margin
calls, in which investors who have borrowed
against their shareholdings are ordered by
lenders to put up new money to restore the
collateral pared away by the market's fall.
Margin calls tend to depress prices in two
ways: Investors may sell some of their shares
to protect their stake in the rest, and lenders
can unilaterally sell shares of holders who fail
to answer their demands.
Yesterday's broad slide, in which more
than 13 stocks fell in price for every one that
rose, had market professionals looking for
signs, somewhat in vain, that the continued
blowoff would soon exhaust itself.
The crash has now pared 34.1 percent from
the Dow Jones industrial average since it hit
its peak of 2722.42 Aug. 25. Some bearish
market analysts now predict that the index
could drop as low as 1300 before rallying.
