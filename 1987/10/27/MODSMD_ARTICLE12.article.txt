# Reagan, Congress talk taxes

### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan and congressional
leaders, hoping to calm the
chaotic financial markets, began
talks yesterday on reducing the
federal budget deficit, but the
chances of an early compromise
seemed doubtful.
The president and a four-man
congressional delegation talked
generally about the need to reach
a budget agreement that would
reassure investors that the
massive deficit will be reduced,
and they set the stage for ses
sions that will examine specific
proposals, the group said.
Nevertheless, despite pledges
of cooperation by both sides, the
House made plans to press for
ward this week with budget legis
lation containing tax increases
that President Reagan has vowed
to veto.
Citing a Nov. 20 deadline in
the deficit reduction plan for this
fiscal year. House Speaker Jim
Wright (D-Texas) said, "We
can't just delay the actions of
government."
"We have sent veto signals,"

about the legislation, said White
House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater. "I don't want to cast
criticism on the Speaker. It's his
decision to proceed. Let's leave
it at that in the tone of the new
truce on critical comments," said
Fitzwater.
The concerted conciliatory
tone was the chief result of the
45-minute meeting between
Reagan, Wright, Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.),
Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole (R-Kan.) and House
Minority Leader Rep. Bob Mi
chel (R-III.). The participants
took pains to avoid pessimism
about the prospects for success
although their points of differ
ence remain substantial.
"We have to be serious, all of
us," about cutting the deficit,
Wright said after the session.
"We cannot look backwards,
we must look ahead," said Byrd.
"We're all in agreement, we're
going to work quickly, work hard
and not look back."
A private negotiating session
will be held on Capitol Hill Tues

day by the newly dubbed "Gang
of 15"— six senators, six House
members and three White House
representatives who will try to
work out a plan for reducing
spending and increasing reve
nues. The president has declared
that every area is subject to nego
tiation except Social Security.
Dole said the talks will be "a
high stakes game we can't afford
to lose. After all, we're playing
for all the people, not just Wall
Street. We're shooting for at
least $23 billion in deficit reduc
tion but if we can get more we
will," Dole said.
Congress and the president
must agree on a $23 billion pack
age of deficit reduction measures
before Nov. 20. If they fail, the
Gramm-Rudman balanced budg
et law will force automatic
spending cuts of 8.5 percent in a
wide range of domestic spending
programs, and 10.5 percent in
weapons procurement and other
military spending. Exempt from
cuts would be Social Security,
welfare programs, veterans
benefits and military payrolls.

The Democrats have a budget
cutting plan that the House is ex
pected to approve Thursday,
which combines $12 billion in
new taxes with $11 billion in
spending cuts for fiscal 1988,
which began Oct. 1. This plan's
tax hikes are unacceptable to
President Reagan, who prefers
that virtually all of the sum come
from domestic program cuts.
Wright said the House will
proceed with the Democratic leg
islation, but simultaneously will
pursue the White House negotia
tions.
Michel said the Republicans
"don't have the votes" to block
the Democratic plan, but ex
pressed hope "the Senate will be
more appropriate for negotia
tions" over the budget package.
In keeping with the upbeat
tone of the day, Michel delicately
avoided direct criticism of the
Democrats. "I would have
preferred the Speaker to demur
from pressing forward (with the
legislation) this week," he told
reporters.
