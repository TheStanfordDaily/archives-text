# National Honor Conference
## Honor Code cited at college meeting 
### Suzanne O'Brien 
Stanford's Honor Code is
one of the most well-respected
in the nation, according to a
Stanford senior who partici
pated in a national honor con
ference last week.
Senior Keith Nashawaty
was Stanford's representative
at the 1987 National Honor
Conference in West Point,
N.Y. Two dozen public,
private and military schools
from across the country par
ticipated in the conference,
which was held Oct. 21-25.
This was the first year the
University sent a representa
tive to the conference, which
focused on "honor, ethics and
integrity in academia," Nas
hawaty said.
Nashawaty, who chairs the
University's Honor Code
Commission, said he was
"surprised at how many
people knew about Stanford's
Honor Code and wanted to
know more. It is pretty well
respected."
He noted that the Stanford
code is unique in many
respects. For example, he said
that not many schools have
separate guidelines for aca
demic and social conduct.
"Most schools had one code
that applied to everything
across the board," while Stan
ford has both the Honor Code

and the Fundamental Stan
dard, Nashawaty said.
Another feature that sets
Stanford's Honor Code apart
is that students must try to
stop violators, rather than
report them to a judicial
hoard, according to Nas
hawaty.
"There are so many things
you can do to get [violators] to
stop. If you fail, then you go to
see (Judicial Affairs Officer)
Sally CoJe. Reporting students
here is really a la?>f Resort," he
said.
And though Nashawaty said
he believes the "way [the
Honor Code I stands now is the
best," he said he believes
some aspects of it need to be
reassessed.
In particular, Nashawaty
raised the question of con
fidentiality. At the conference,
participants "bantered
around" the advantages of
making violators' names
public, he said.
"A lot of schools make [the
names 1 public because they
feel it will be a deterrent,"
Nashawaty explained. Many
schools felt Stanford "took it
easy on people by not reveal
ing names," he said.
The aim of Stanford's
Honor Code, however, is
"deterrence, not punish
ment," Nashawaty said. " The
system is supposed to be edu
cational."
