# Does the Constitution cover groups'?
## Panel addresses equal protection 
### Chris Shuttlesworth 
Citing recent conservative
court decisions relating to the
rights of women and minorities,
panelists in a forum discussion
last night in Kresge Auditorium
accused the legal establishment
of failing to apply the constitu
tional doctrine of equal protec
tion to disfavored groups.
The program, titled "Justice
for All? The Constitution and
Disfavored Groups," focused on
current interpretations of the
Constitution and equal protec
tion.
Participants in the conference
were Oliver Jones, a civil rights
attorney in private practice;
Mary Dunlap. a private attorney
specializing in constitutional law;
and Matt Coles, an American
Civil Liberties Union staff attor
ney and visiting professor at the
UC-Berkeley Graduate School of
Public Policy.
Judith Raiskin, the graduate
student director of Innovative
Academic Courses, a sponsor of
the forum, introduced the
speakers by saying that "there
are lots of events surrounding the
bicentennial celebration of the
Constitution being held this year.
At the same time we had the
Bork hearings which raised many
questions, and the term
'disfavored groups' came up.
This program will allow us to ask
questions about that and to ask if
the Constitution under its current
interpretation does offer equal
protection to all."
In his opening remarks, Jones
focused on equal protection in re
lation to police brutality and

abuse of force.
"Abuse by the police is
tolerated by the courts and the
political system because of the
nature of the victims, who are
people without political power,"
Jones said.
He named the poor, the home
less and racial minorities as being
primary targets of police
brutality. "We have a dual sys
tem of law enforcement, and the
middle class has a hard time un
derstanding how the well
meaning public servants they
deal with can become cruel and
sadistic" when dealing with the
poor and minorities.
"Police work is very arbitrary,
and law enforcement concen
trates on poor and minority com
munities on the basis that that's
where the crime is. But crime is
where you find it," Jones said.
Dunlap spoke mainly on equal
protection involving women's
rights. She said that women
"have believed in the Constitu
tion as a cup of promise but also
as a cup with cracks."
"Those on the outside looking
in are considered special interest
groups," she said. "And women
are the most obvious special in
terest group. We've improved
but we haven't improved
enough."
Coles focused his remarks on
reproductive rights and the rights
of sexual behavior, but said that
the current trend in Supreme
Court cases is "grim."
"The court is saying it doesn't
care about the right to privacy for
certain groups."
