Public discourse on the growing AIDS
epidemic has touched upon legal, moral, reli
gious and sexual issues. But the crisis is above
all a medical one, and this important fact is fortu
nately well understood by Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop, a prominent figure in the national
effort to combat the disease.
Koop has been a strong and sensible voice in a
Reagan Administration whose AIDS policy has
suffered from bureaucratic bumbling and politcal
warring. In the last month, in fact, the president
has been faced with the the resignations of the
chair and vice chair of his AIDS Commission,
both of which occurred amid charges that the
commission lacked representation from respon
sible health care authorities. It is this very
Capitol Hill sparring that Koop has tried to rise
above.
Although it offends certain conservative
groups, Koop's advocacy of early sex education
in public schools is simply sound judgement; the
classroom is a valuable national forum in which
to encourage preventative health practices.
Koop's distrust of mandatory AIDS testing
reflects a commitment to focusing on the con
tainment of the disease through medical re
search, and not through curbs on civil liberties.
It is because AIDS is not only fatal, but also
alarmingly difficult to identify — even in carriers
of the virus — that painstaking and accurate

medical attention is so crucial. Data detailing the
precise number of the afflicted has been difficult
to obtain because the disease cloaks its spread;
the period between contraction and first
symptons is often quite long.
"How many are infected? That's our whole
problem — we don't know the number," Koop
recently told an interviewer. "We use the num
ber of a million or a million and a half. But it
could be 400,000, or it could be four million.
Those estimates are based on very shaky
evidence. We just don't know."
The accumulation of these statistics is vital to
developing a strategy to defuse the the threat of
AIDS. Such information may reveal to scientists
clues to the virus's shifting movements. Im
proved data may also help highlight the effec
tiveness of educational and public awareness
programs.
Koop, while not disregarding the societal ef
fects of AIDS, recognizes the immediacy of it as
a disease. The primary issue is a medical, not a
political one.
Researchers need money and national support
to beat the odds. That Koop hasn't allowed po
litical concerns to derail his public health efforts
is commendable. Any fight against fatality could
profit from his insight and reasonable judge
ment.
