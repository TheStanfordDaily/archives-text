# Sunday afternoon apathy on University Avenue
## 
### 
Blissful Sunday afternoon, cloudless
sky, gentle breeze â€” what a perfect
excuse to go shopping. I hupped on my
bike and cruised down University Ave
nue checking out the stores and enjoying
the beautiful weather. Along the
sidewalks people wandered slowly,
taking in that relaxed, peaceful feeling
that all Sunday afternoons seem to have.
I was about to investigate a sale when
suddenly disaster struck.

My nose started bleeding.
Nosebleeds are an integral part of my
life. I've had them for as long as I can re
member. Sometimes they disappear for
months. Other times I don't dare go
anywhere without arming myself with a
few boxes of Kleenex. Today marked
one of the few times that it happened
without warning and the first time I'd
ever gotten a nosebleed in a public
place. What made the afternoon so
memorable, though, were the reactions
of the people passing by me on the
street.
No one stopped.
It had happened so suddenly that I had
barely had time to snatch a tissue from
my backpack. Dropping quickly to my

knees, I swore silently and tilted my
head back to try to slow the bleeding. In
that awkward position, smack in the
middle of the sidewalk, I waited, half ex
pecting someone to look at me and laugh
or say "Oh, gross!" or something like
that.
Still no one stopped. The steady
procession of people continued around
me uninterrupted, like water flowing
quietly around a rock in a river. Occa
sionally children would stare at me
curiously and slow down for a better
look. But then a parent's hand would tug
them away, and I was left alone again.
Many times when people get hurt,
they accept help only with reluctance. It
seems characteristic of human nature to
try to hide or ignore an injury. Maybe
it's a leftover survival instinct. You
know the feeling. You get a bad injury
and people run up to you and gasp, "Are
you OK? Are you OK?," and your auto
matic response is a dazed smile and,
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Sometimes, if the injury is fairly
serious, you become detached from
yourself, as if you're watching the com
motion from a distance. The more
people fuss about you, the more you
wonder why they're so worried.
Sometimes I think it is not so much the
physical assistance we need as much as
the offer of assistance. Think about it.
How would you feel if you cut your leg
in front of ten other people and no one
noticed? You might feel a tiny bit miffed.
I know I would.
Whenever I hurt myself, 1 don't really
want people to "help" me. What I do

want is that unspoken reassurance that
yes, these people do care about me, and
they will be there should I actually need
help. I reached this revelation in a split
second. TRUTH! my mind screamed.
You are hurt and you are expecting
someone to stop! That's why this whole
thing feels so odd.
As in all moments of revelation. I was
temporarily floored. Once 1 realized why
the situation was bothering me, I started
wondering why one person might not
stop to help another person. The ques
tion intrigued me, and 1 became a
detached observer, studying the people
around me.
Out of the corner of my eye 1 saw a
man sitting on a bench, ten feet away.
He had seen the whole thing from the
start. Now he looked at me again and
fidgeted. I could almost feel his hesita
tion: Should 1 help her? Maybe she's
OK. It's just a nosebleed. But. . . what
if she really does need help? He looked
away.
Time passed. I was bleeding at a rate
that was beginning to scare me a little.
My hands had blood on them, as did the
growing pile of used tissues at my feet.
No one said a word to me. Finally, after
ten minutes, an elderly man saw me and
came closer to help. It was too much for
the man on the bench. He sprang up and
came over to me quickly, his voice full
of guilt and concern. "Are you all right?
Can 1 help you over to the bench?"
Finally someone had crossed the bar
rier! I thanked him and smiled, "No, I'm
fine. I'll be OK." Wow! Somebody
cares! I felt so good all of a sudden.

It soon occurred to me that it might be
a good idea to get to the bench, though,
so 1 found my way over and continued
my observations from there. The people
fascinated me. Almost always it was the
same reaction. First they would do a
double take; then they would either
come up to me quickly, or avert their
eyes and feign an interest in the store
windows. Each time 1 could feel the
hesitation.
Every single person who eventually
stopped looked at least 40, if not older,
and nearly all were female. The few men
who asked "Are you all right?" did so
rather brusquely, as if they felt embar
rassed.
The women who stopped were so
nice. Maybe it's that maternal instinct;
they all seemed to genuinely care. One
lady worried so much that I felt embar
rassed. "Do you want me to buy you
some Kleenex? Can I help you to a
restroom? Are you sure you're OK?" 1
wanted to give her a hug.
The most interesting thing I learned,
though, was the power of eye contact.
They say the eyes are the window to the
soul. It may be a cliche, but 1 think it's
true. One look can convey more feeling,
more understanding, than an hour's
worth of conversation. I noticed that the
people with whom I made eye contact
were much more likely to stop than
those who didn't look at me.
In the split second that we exchanged
glances, I could almost sense what
people were feeling; I knew in an instant
whether they would stop or not. And
when they did not stop, 1 had an over

whelming sense of their guilt, fear or in
difference, just in the way they averted
their eyes.
Many questions occurred to me that
day that I still can't figure out now. Why
were people so afraid to stop? I think it
was fairly obvious that something was
wrong. Most people do not spend their
Sunday afternoons on their knees in the
middle of the sidewalk with a wad of
tissues attached to their faces. Were
people afraid of me? I can't believe
that's the case.
If I were in a "bad" part of town and
saw a strange person who looked like he
was in trouble, I admit that I might
hesitate to help him. But can there be
any harm in asking? If you call out to an
injured stranger, "Hey, are you OK?"
the worst thing that could happen is that
he might yell back, "I'm fine! Leave me
alone!" It's rude of him, but think: You
will probably never see the guy again.
Perhaps some people thought I didn't
need help. In all fairness, they were
right. I did not actually need assistance
(although a few more tissues would have
been nice). But it would have made me
feel better to know that at least people
cared enough to ask if I was all right.
Is it so hard to help other people? To
reach out to them and say, "I don't
know you, but I care about you because
you're a human being, like me"? Are we
that afraid of each other?
It saddens me to think that the answer
might be yes.
