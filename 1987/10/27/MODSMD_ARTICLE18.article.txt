Racism, sexism
affect our actions
Many, including Dean (of the
Law School Paul) Brest and the
Allen, Matkins representatives,
have missed the point of the Vic
tor Minjares "controversy"
(Daily, Oct. 23).
The focus of most of our dis
cussion has been on what the
firm should do with the person
who made the racist remark and
whether membership in certain
clubs should be prohibited.
I believe that attention in these
areas is misplaced. Today the
problem of discrimination is
more subtle and exists at a
deeper level than in the past. The
law and society at large focus on
the "intent" to discriminate and
pay little attention to the subcon
scious or unconscious biases that
affect our actions and which are
reflected in what we call
"institutional racism/sexism."
Many of us are confronted
with racism, sexism and homo
phobia as individuals every day.
Like Victor, we confront the indi
vidual, we accept apologies
(sincere or not), shake hands and
try to go on with our lives. The
main concern is how Allen, Mat
kins dealt with the possibility
that the problem existed. Allen,
Matkins chose not to face its own
conscious or unconscious rac
ism.
Suddenly, Victor's work
seemed less appealing. They
failed to consider that Victor's
willingness to confront them with
their own racism may have
tainted their evaluation of his
work.

What they should have asked
themselves was "how is our per
spective affected by the fact that
this person is willing to call us
ugly and give us a mirror so we
can look for ourselves?" Allen,
Matkins failed to take a good
hard look at itself, its actions, its
reasons and its motives. What
they did was refuse to deal with
the problem by not allowing a
person who would confront them
to join the firm.
Allen, Matkins claims that it
thinks that Victor honestly
believes he was discriminated
against on the basis of race. I
think Allen, Matkins may
honestly believe his work was in
adequate. Because calling some
one a racist in our society is a
powerful accusation, and be
cause being openly racist is so
unacceptable (at least in these
circles), Allen, Matkins under
standably felt it had to take a de
fensive posture by refusing to ac
cept that it could happen to them.
We tend to avoid contact with
people who make us feel inade
quate.
The existence of a racist per
son negatively reflects on the
other individuals in the firm and
makes them feel inadequate.
These individuals are outraged at
being called racist and may sub
consciously avoid contact with
the person who pointed out the
ugliness that exists in the firm. In
this case, avoiding contact took
the form of denying a well
qualified person a work opportu
nity.

Financial worries
exist already
I am sure the Daily can imag
ine the relief felt around the
campus when the news was bro
ken that the Stanford Financial
Aids Office was not expecting an
onslaught of new applicants after
Monday's stock market crash.
This wonderful news was broken
in a front page article (Oct. 21).
Upon reading the news I did
not know whether I should laugh
at the Daily's silly decision to
pursue this story or if I should
applaud the paper for bringing
the financial concerns of students
to the front page.
Every year the Financial Aids
Office deals with students who
are hoping to finance a Stanford
education. Often they are dealt
with in a way that leaves many
scrambling for the money to pay
— perhaps scrambling in the
same way that more wealthy
folks were scrambling during the
"big plunge." In most cases
these alternative means of paying
are as fragile as the worst stock
market investment.
Some students are paying off
loans now (not after graduation)
through the University's own
Parent Loan Plan, some are bor
rowing at higher interest levels
because the University won't
even provide a loan, and some
are working several hours a week
— all to get the best education
money can buy. And each of
these alternatives is one which
puts students directly in the
middle of any nationwide finan
cial situation.

In any case, the ability to pay
is heavily dependent on such
mundane economic worries as
job layoffs, industry slowdowns,
unemployment and conflicts be
tween work and school. These
are worries that belong to both
students and their parents, both
of whom must be active in finan
cial planning.
It is even more distressing to
learn that the Financial Aids Of
fice suggested, in the face of the
crash, that it might have to insti
tute a "special program"' for vic
tims of the market. How about a
program that meets the more
basic needs of students even
worse off.' This concept of a spe
cial program, combined with the
attempt at news by The Daily,
only helps to perpetuate the false
stereotype of wealthy Stanford
brats — a stereotype that doesn't
help those of us who work hard
to be here.
The possibility of any students
actually developing a need for aid
as a result of the crash seems
slim, as The Daily points out. On
the other hand, the resources of
students who can't even afford to
take the risks involved in stock
options tend to be much more
shaky in the economic aftermath
of any stock market changes.
1 find it absolutely ridiculous
that The Daily would run over to
the Financial Aids Office worry
ing about students whose
"formerly wealthy" families can
no longer afford Stanford. Per
haps they should be running to
those people who haven't been
able to pay all along.
