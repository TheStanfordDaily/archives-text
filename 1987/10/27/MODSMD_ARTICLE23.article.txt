## Following Stanford's lead North Dakota alters Indian mascot 
### Julia kazaks 
War paint and feathers
vanished from Stanford Stadium
along with the University's In
dian mascot 15 years ago. Since
then, other universities through
out the country have joined Stan
ford in eliminating racially offen
sive mascots.
Most recently, the University
of North Dakota elected to limit
the use of its "Fighting Sioux"
symbol in response to complaints
from the school's Cultural
Awareness Committee that the
caricature depicted Native
Americans in a negative light.
War whoops and imitations of
Indian dancing have also been
banned from the North Dakota
campus following an announce
ment from University President
Tom Clifford. The Cultural
Awareness Committee reported
that students found these
parodies to be unrepresentative
of Native Americans' civilized
and intelligent lifestyles.
The change at North Dakota
resembles the one that took place
at Stanford in 1972. At that time,
over 400 Native Americans who
were enrolled in California col
leges, including 55 from Stan
ford, asked then-University Pres
ident Richard Lyman to abandon
Stanford's Indian symbol, saying
it was culturally insulting.
After a vote in the student sen
ate and two student referendums,
the University dropped the In
dian mascot and replaced it with
the current name, "the Cardi
nal."
Joey Thomas, Stanford's
Native American representative
to the University Committee on
Minority Issues, said the change
was appropriate. The Indian

symbol "wasn't representative
(of Native Americans.) It was a
cartoon caricature," he said.
Over the years there have been
many unsuccessful attempts to
reinstate the Indian symbol.
However, the administration has
officially banned any such ef
forts, according to Thomas.
Thomas called any movements
to go back to the Indian mascot
"a waste of time."
"[ The symbol ] won't ever be
reinstated," he said.
The change at North Dakota,
however, is not as far-reaching as
was the one at Stanford. North
Dakota's official school mascot
remains "the Fighting Sioux,"
and T-shirts in the campus
bookstore still bear a geometric
Indian-head logo.

However, caricatures of Indi
ans depicted as hunters or war
riors have been removed from
the bookstore.
"As long as [the Indian sym
bol] is not used in a derogatory
manner, the Cultural Awareness
Committee has accomplished
what it set out to do," said Leigh
Jeanotte, assistant to the vice
president of Student Affairs for
Native American Programs at
North Dakota.
Students at North Dakota said
they were most offended by the
contrast between the image of
the logo and the actual lifestyle of
the modern Native American.
According to a poll taken by
North Dakota University re
searcher Dean Schieve, Native
American students preferred to

he seen as future doctors and en
gineers, rather than as savages
brandishing tomahawks.
Jeannotte said the movement
to abolish such racist charac
terizations began "years and
years ago," but it has only been
this year that the committee gar
nered enough interest and sup
port to follow through and
remove the symbol. He said he
did not believe that prejudice
prevented the change from hap
pening earlier, but rather that a
lack of initiative delayed the
movement.
North Dakota's decision is the
most recent in a series of mascot
changes made at U.S. univer
sities over the past few decades.

Dartmouth University, for ex
ample, banned all uses of its In
dian symbol from the campus in
1971 and adopted its current
"Big Green" nickname.
Dartmouth students pressured
the university to legitimize its
historical reputation as an educa
tional haven for American Indi
ans by abolishing all satires of In
dian life.
In 1977, Florida State Univer
sity also reacted to complaints
from Native American students
and replaced its whooping
"Savage Sam" mascot with a
more neutral Seminole Indian
symbol.
Universities have also revised
their mascot policies with regard
to blacks as well as to Native
Americans.
In 1982, a black cheerleader at
the University of Mississippi
refused to wave the Confederate
flag at a spirit rally.
According to Jim Cleveland,
director of Public Information for
the University of Mississippi, the
flag has since been officially
removed as a spirit symbol.
"We disowned |the flag). We
no longer sell it in the bookstore,
and it no longer has any official
use" at the university, he said.
While Mississippi officials offi
cially acknowledge that the flag
connotes racism, the ban has not
deterred unofficial community
and student use of the banner.
