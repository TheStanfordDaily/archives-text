# Day care center gears to open
## 
### Rozanna Fiore 
Members of the Stanford
community who have tried in
vain to enroll their children in
one of the many day-care
centers near campus will soon
have another chance to do just
that at the new Child Care
West center.
The center, which is cur
rently being built near Hoover
Pavilion, will be open to all
regular faculty, staff and stu
dents at the University, Stan
ford Hospital and the
Children's Hospital at Stan
ford beginning this spring.
Created mainly to alleviate
the problem of overcrowding
at other local centers, Child
Care West will also offer
flexible hours for parents who
do not wish to keep their
children in a center for the
whole day and for parents who
cannot drop their children off
at a center early in the morn
ing.
Although the center is being
built mainly to meet the needs
of hospital employees, no par
ticular group will be favored
when selecting which children
to enroll.
Phyllis Craig, co-director of
the University's Child Care
Resource Center, said that the
new center will be able to care
for up to 98 children at a time.
The children must be infant to
pre-school age.
"With the growing aware
ness of the importance of high

quality child care, this center
is going to be very helpful to
those who want a good day
care center that is easy to
use," said Jim Bouquin, assis
tant dean of Student Affairs.
Bouquin is one of the Univer
sity representatives on the
center's steering committee,
which has collected donations
and selected parent board
members for Child Care West.
"When people know that
their child is safe and under
the care of a high- quality cen
ter such as this one, they'll be
able to both work and study
better and with greater peace
of mind," Bouquin said.
Unlike the Children's Cen
ter, a local day-care center
that is run on a cooperative
basis, Craig said that Child
Care West will have a board of
parent directors. This board
will make decisions about is
sues at the center, such as
wait-list policies, fees, hours
of operation and personnel
policies. The board will also
choose the staff and director
for the center.
Although the parent board
has yet to set enrollment costs
for the center, Bouquin said
that keeping fees down is his
main concern.
The center will open wait
lists for enrollment this winter
or spring.
In choosing its board mem
bers, the center is especially
looking for student parents to
apply, according to Bouquin.
