# The 						Bug is biting back: All insects beware

I'm going to sell a bumper

Weekend thai says "WEL

HOME." Because this bumper
sticker will make me millions,
perhaps even billions of dollars, I
will no longer have to write Bug

Me in order to support my
Madonna pin-up poster habit. So
unless you want to see the
demise of this column, send your
silly questions to Bug Me, Stan
ford Daily, Storke Building,
Stanford CA 94305. Or mail them
to Bug-Me (not B. Bug-Me) at
the Tragedies on LOTS. Is that
not the most ridiculous threat
you've ever heard?

Dear Bug,
In the history of recorded
music in the United States what
is the most frequently mentioned
city? I'll define "mention'' to be
the appearance of the name of
the city in the title of the song or
somewhere in the song's lyrics.
My guess is that the winner is
Memphis, Tenn., the home of the
blues and that Elvis cat.

and Longtime Bug Fan
Memphis, eh? That's a great
guess! Naturally, you couldn't be
more wrong. This is surprising,
too, considering how easy it is to
rhyme with Memphis in a song.
Take this sample ditty, which I
have just composed:
I'm going down to Memphis,
To catch me some tetanus.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
See, it's almost like they
named Memphis with the top 40
in mind.
But here's a little quiz: Quickly
write down all the songs you can
think of with Memphis in them.
Are you done? Good. Now write
down all the songs with New
York in them. Done? Good.
Now, isn't your New York list
about a billion times longer than
the Memphis list? I thought so.
New York is a very big city.
Lots of people live there. Lots of
those people who live there
record music (Many of those
people who record music are ar
rested because they are record

ing U2 live in concert with a tape
recorder stuck to their stom
achs). However, lots of folks
there record their own music,
and thus it shouldn't surprise you
to learn that New York is the
most frequently mentioned city
in American song, easily outdis
tancing such pretenders as
Chicago and Los Angeles. For
more information about such
meaningless trivia, check out
"The Great Song Thesaurus,"
by Roger Lax and Frederick
Smith.
"New York, New York,"
"Ev'ry Street's a Boulevard in
New York," "On a Rooftop in
Manhattan." Need I go on?
Dear Bug,
Do insects have muscles in
their legs?
- Blinky
Yes 1 do. Thanks for asking.
What? Oh, you want to know
about smaller insects; I could
give you the phone number of my
last girlfriend . . . Oh, you mean
flies and mosquitos and stuff like
that. Why didn't you say so?
I called the Department of Bio
logical Sciences, but the secre
tary told me that they didn't have
any entomologists on the staff. I
offered to send her an eth
nomusicologist whom I knew
from my column, but she wasn't
interested.
Plunging ahead, I called Bryn,
my resident assistant. She didn't

know anything about insects,
either; she just wanted her name
in Bug Me.
When you think about it, the
prospect of meeting a muscle
bound insect is not a pleasant
one. Mosquitos are not my favor
ite members of the animal
kingdom, and I certainly can't
say 1 relish the possibility of
meeting one that looks like Ar
nold Schwarzenegger.
Nevertheless, my tireless re
search (my bike has a flat)
revealed that insects do indeed
have muscles. Very small
muscles, mind you, but muscles
nonetheless. Insects, it turns out,
are exoskeletal, meaning that
their skeletons are on the
outside, and all the muscles and
stuff are on the inside. The
thought of humans having their
skeletons on the outside is too
disgusting to even imagine.
By the way, almost all ver
tebrates and invertebrates have
muscles; even low order
creatures such as mollusks, an
nelid worms and Western Cul
ture section leaders.
Dear Bug,
On Mayfield Avenue, just
before you reach the Pearce
Mitchell faculty ghetto, there are
two big stone pillars with big
spheres on top of them, one on
each side of the street. What are
they, and what are they for?
- Thrust and Peri

Back before there were such
things as fraternities and the Vor
tex, students had to go elsewhere
to get wasted.
One of those places was the
quaint little town of Mayfield,
which no longer exists; it was in
corporated into the Stanford In
dustrial Park area when technol
ogy was invented in the late
19405. Of course, since no frater
nities were there it was a pleasant
part of campus to wander about
in — it was where all the faculty
lived.
The big cement pillars, built
around the turn of the century,
were simply a way of indicating
that this was an alternate en
trance to the University.
Back in the old days, faculty
housing stretched from the ce
ment pillars down to where the
Bookstore now stands. The old
bookstore was what is now the
Career Planning and Placement
Center. Old Union was built in
1915 as a place where students
and faculty could mingle. In
those days, it was in the heart of
faculty country, a territory not to
be entered without Marlon
Perkins and a spear gun.
Most students lived in Encina
Hall, or in the female dorm. Se
quoia Hall. Sequoia Hall is now
the Statistics Department, and
the women who lived there are
now statistics.

Are you done? Good. Now write
down all the songs with New

Now, isn't your New York list
about a billion times longer than
the Memphis list? I thought so.
New York is a very big city.
Lots of people live there. Lots of
those people who live there
record music (Many of those
people who record music are ar
rested because they are record

ing U2 live in concert with a tape
recorder stuck to their stom
achs). However, lots of folks
there record their own music,
and thus it shouldn't surprise you
to learn that New York is the
most frequently mentioned city
in American song, easily outdis
tancing such pretenders as
Chicago and Los Angeles. For

Dear Bug,
Do insects have muscles in
their legs?
- Blinky
Yes 1 do. Thanks for asking.
What? Oh, you want to know
about smaller insects; I could
give you the phone number of my
last girlfriend . . . Oh, you mean
flies and mosquitos and stuff like
that. Why didn't you say so?
I called the Department of Bio
logical Sciences, but the secre
tary told me that they didn't have
any entomologists on the staff. I
offered to send her an eth
nomusicologist whom I knew
from my column, but she wasn't
interested.
Plunging ahead, I called Bryn,
my resident assistant. She didn't

know anything about insects,
either; she just wanted her name
in Bug Me.
When you think about it, the
prospect of meeting a muscle
bound insect is not a pleasant
one. Mosquitos are not my favor
ite members of the animal
kingdom, and I certainly can't
say 1 relish the possibility of
meeting one that looks like Ar
nold Schwarzenegger.
Nevertheless, my tireless re
search (my bike has a flat)
revealed that insects do indeed
have muscles. Very small
muscles, mind you, but muscles
nonetheless. Insects, it turns out,
are exoskeletal, meaning that
their skeletons are on the
outside, and all the muscles and
stuff are on the inside. The
thought of humans having their
skeletons on the outside is too
disgusting to even imagine.
By the way, almost all ver
tebrates and invertebrates have
muscles; even low order
creatures such as mollusks, an
nelid worms and Western Cul
ture section leaders.
Dear Bug,
On Mayfield Avenue, just
before you reach the Pearce
Mitchell faculty ghetto, there are
two big stone pillars with big
spheres on top of them, one on
each side of the street. What are
they, and what are they for?
- Thrust and Peri

Back before there were such
things as fraternities and the Vor
tex, students had to go elsewhere
to get wasted.
One of those places was the
quaint little town of Mayfield,
which no longer exists; it was in
corporated into the Stanford In
dustrial Park area when technol
ogy was invented in the late
19405. Of course, since no frater
nities were there it was a pleasant
part of campus to wander about
in — it was where all the faculty
lived.
The big cement pillars, built
around the turn of the century,
were simply a way of indicating
that this was an alternate en
trance to the University.
Back in the old days, faculty
housing stretched from the ce
ment pillars down to where the
Bookstore now stands. The old
bookstore was what is now the
Career Planning and Placement
Center. Old Union was built in
1915 as a place where students
and faculty could mingle. In
those days, it was in the heart of
faculty country, a territory not to
be entered without Marlon
Perkins and a spear gun.
Most students lived in Encina
Hall, or in the female dorm. Se
quoia Hall. Sequoia Hall is now
the Statistics Department, and
the women who lived there are
now statistics.

Dear Bug,
In the history of recorded
music in the United States what
is the most frequently mentioned
city? I'll define "mention'' to be
the appearance of the name of
the city in the title of the song or
somewhere in the song's lyrics.
My guess is that the winner is
Memphis, Tenn., the home of the
blues and that Elvis cat.

Memphis, eh? That's a great
guess! Naturally, you couldn't be
more wrong. This is surprising,
too, considering how easy it is to
rhyme with Memphis in a song.
Take this sample ditty, which I
have just composed:
I'm going down to Memphis,
To catch me some tetanus.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

named Memphis with the top 40
