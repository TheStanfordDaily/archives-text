## Memories of 1906 Campus well-prepared for an earthquake 
### Robert Liu 
Most Stanford buildings are designed
effectively to withstand an earthquake,
and Stanford is continually improving its
state of earthquake readiness, according
to earthquake experts here.
Stanford's newer buildings, such as
student residences in Governor's Cor
ner, represent the best in earthquake
resistant design, but a few of Stanford's
older buildings would require strength
ening to bring them up to ever stricter
modern standards, explained James
Gere, co-director of Stanford's John A.
Blume Earthquake Center.
Gere stressed, however, that even the
older buildings are well-designed.
For the past 20 years the University
has invested a few million doilars an
nually to improve old buildings, Gere
said. History Corner, for example, was
recently made earthquake resistant with
reinforced concrete.
In updating buildings to higher stan
dards of earthquake readiness, the Uni
versity Earthquake Preparedness Group
has in recent years also overseen the re
structuring of Encina Hall and various
parts of the Quad.
Gere called Stanford "a pioneer
among communities" in its program to
reinforce old buildings and educate the
public about earthquakes.
One of the major geological faults in
California, the San Andreas Fault runs
just a few miles from Stanford along
Page Mill Road.
Earthquakes are caused by the move
ment of the plates that make up the
earth's crust. Each year, these plates
move a few centimeters apart, past or di
rectly into each other. The San Andreas
Fault lies between the Pacific and North
American plates.
An earthquake occurs when accum
ulated stress is relieved by the fracture
of rocks along a fault (the area between

plates), Gere said.
The close proximity of the San
Andreas fault worries some area resi
dents, but actually "the strain of ac
cumulation is slow (in this region of the
San Andreas Fault)," according to Stan
ford Geophysicist Mark Zoback.
Therefore, a major earthquake may "not
occur for several hundred years," he
said.
Zoback warned, however, that other
faults exist in the area that could
produce smaller earthquakes, such as
the one that occurred in Los Angeles

earlier this month.
The hypothetical "Big One" that is
supposed to "rock" California is ex
pected to measure eight on the Richter
scale. Such an earthquake would be 1000
times bigger than the recent Los Angeles
earthquake, which measured 6.1 on the
Richter scale, Zoback said.
Geophysicists now estimate a 50 per
cent chance of a quake of this magnitude
occurring in Southern California in the
next 30 years, and this probability in
creases with each year, Zoback said.
Even though Southern California may

be hardest hit by the "Big One," Zoback
added, the Bay Area will still feel its ef
fects.
There are two ways to prepare a com
munity for an earthquake, according to
Disaster Preparedness Coordinator Ben
Suh of the Stanford Public Safety De
partment. First, structures should be
made earthquake-resistant through the
use of good building materials and sound
architectural design. Second, the popu
lation should be educated on earthquake
preparations and procedures.
Stanford's buildings are constructed
with wood, steel and reinforced concrete
and masonry. All of these materials are
both supported by steel bars that act to
"tie the parts of the building together,"
Gere said. He explained that these bars
provide "ductility," or "the ability of a
structure to bend, sway and deform by
large amounts without collapsing."
When an earthquake occurs, two
kinds of forces, "dead load" and "live
load," act on buildings, Gere said. The
dead load is the weight of the structure
itself. The live load consists of forces
that push and pull the structure, such as
people and other objects inside the
building, and natural forces, such as
wind pressure and the earthquake itself.
Earthquake forces are considered live
loads because vibrating ground causes a
horizontal force to be applied to build
ings and other structures.
In order to hold a building together,
sound structural design must comple
ment the building materials. "Shear
walls" and "frame action" are com
monly used to help buildings resist
earthquake damage.
Shear walls are large, rigid walls of
reinforced concrete or masonry that
"transfer the building's forces back into
the ground" and "resist the horizontal
earthquake forces," Gere said. Stanford
buildings made out of wood, concrete or
masonry are often constructed with

shear walls. The Terman Engineering
Library is one such building.
In contrast to shear walls, which
create a rigid structure to resist
earthquakes, the use of frame action
provides structural flexibility. Found
mostly in steel buildings, frame action is
a building strategy that allows the build
ing to move with the earthquake.

Stanford is a 4 'pioneer
among communities" in its
earthquake re-strengthening
and population awareness
programs.

Frame-action buildings contain steel
beams, girders and columns, all three of
which work together to form a flexible
framework to resist earthquake loads.
Hoover Tower is an example of a
structure that contains both steel frames
and shear walls.
Although Stanford is well-prepared
for an earthquake, Suh said, "we can al
ways do more to alert the population."
In an attempt to educate the Univer
sity community about earthquakes,
Suh's department recently sponsored
Quake Fest, an informational event that
brought together various "disaster and
emergency mobilization services" from
around the Bay Area.
Representatives from San Jose Search
and Rescue, Stanford Amateur Radio
Club, Santa Clara County Health De
partment Environmental Health Ser
vices, Stanford Police Department, City
of Palo Alto Energy Services and the
U.S. Geological Survey were on hand to
familiarize students with pre- and post
earthquake procedures.

pected to measure eight on the Richter
scale. Such an earthquake would be 1000
times bigger than the recent Los Angeles
earthquake, which measured 6.1 on the
Richter scale, Zoback said.
Geophysicists now estimate a 50 per
cent chance of a quake of this magnitude
occurring in Southern California in the
next 30 years, and this probability in
creases with each year, Zoback said.
Even though Southern California may

be hardest hit by the "Big One," Zoback
added, the Bay Area will still feel its ef
fects.
There are two ways to prepare a com
munity for an earthquake, according to
Disaster Preparedness Coordinator Ben
Suh of the Stanford Public Safety De
partment. First, structures should be
made earthquake-resistant through the
use of good building materials and sound
architectural design. Second, the popu
lation should be educated on earthquake
preparations and procedures.
Stanford's buildings are constructed
with wood, steel and reinforced concrete
and masonry. All of these materials are
both supported by steel bars that act to
"tie the parts of the building together,"
Gere said. He explained that these bars
provide "ductility," or "the ability of a
structure to bend, sway and deform by
large amounts without collapsing."
When an earthquake occurs, two
kinds of forces, "dead load" and "live
load," act on buildings, Gere said. The
dead load is the weight of the structure
itself. The live load consists of forces
that push and pull the structure, such as
people and other objects inside the
building, and natural forces, such as
wind pressure and the earthquake itself.
Earthquake forces are considered live
loads because vibrating ground causes a
horizontal force to be applied to build
ings and other structures.
In order to hold a building together,
sound structural design must comple
ment the building materials. "Shear
walls" and "frame action" are com
monly used to help buildings resist
earthquake damage.
Shear walls are large, rigid walls of
reinforced concrete or masonry that
"transfer the building's forces back into
the ground" and "resist the horizontal
earthquake forces," Gere said. Stanford
buildings made out of wood, concrete or
masonry are often constructed with

shear walls. The Terman Engineering
Library is one such building.
In contrast to shear walls, which
create a rigid structure to resist
earthquakes, the use of frame action
provides structural flexibility. Found
mostly in steel buildings, frame action is
a building strategy that allows the build
ing to move with the earthquake.

Stanford is a 4 'pioneer
among communities" in its
earthquake re-strengthening
and population awareness
programs.

Frame-action buildings contain steel
beams, girders and columns, all three of
which work together to form a flexible
framework to resist earthquake loads.
Hoover Tower is an example of a
structure that contains both steel frames
and shear walls.
Although Stanford is well-prepared
for an earthquake, Suh said, "we can al
ways do more to alert the population."
In an attempt to educate the Univer
sity community about earthquakes,
Suh's department recently sponsored
Quake Fest, an informational event that
brought together various "disaster and
emergency mobilization services" from
around the Bay Area.
Representatives from San Jose Search
and Rescue, Stanford Amateur Radio
Club, Santa Clara County Health De
partment Environmental Health Ser
vices, Stanford Police Department, City
of Palo Alto Energy Services and the
U.S. Geological Survey were on hand to
familiarize students with pre- and post
earthquake procedures.

Memorial Arch had to be torn down completely after the 1906 San Francisco Earth
quake, which measured 8.3 on the Richter scale.
Most Stanford buildings are designed
effectively to withstand an earthquake,
and Stanford is continually improving its
state of earthquake readiness, according
to earthquake experts here.
Stanford's newer buildings, such as
student residences in Governor's Cor
ner, represent the best in earthquake
resistant design, but a few of Stanford's
older buildings would require strength
ening to bring them up to ever stricter
modern standards, explained James
Gere, co-director of Stanford's John A.
Blume Earthquake Center.
Gere stressed, however, that even the
older buildings are well-designed.
For the past 20 years the University
has invested a few million doilars an
nually to improve old buildings, Gere
said. History Corner, for example, was
recently made earthquake resistant with
reinforced concrete.
In updating buildings to higher stan
dards of earthquake readiness, the Uni
versity Earthquake Preparedness Group
has in recent years also overseen the re
structuring of Encina Hall and various
parts of the Quad.
Gere called Stanford "a pioneer
among communities" in its program to
reinforce old buildings and educate the
public about earthquakes.
One of the major geological faults in
California, the San Andreas Fault runs
just a few miles from Stanford along
Page Mill Road.
Earthquakes are caused by the move
ment of the plates that make up the
earth's crust. Each year, these plates
move a few centimeters apart, past or di
rectly into each other. The San Andreas
Fault lies between the Pacific and North
American plates.
An earthquake occurs when accum
ulated stress is relieved by the fracture
of rocks along a fault (the area between

plates), Gere said.
The close proximity of the San
Andreas fault worries some area resi
dents, but actually "the strain of ac
cumulation is slow (in this region of the
San Andreas Fault)," according to Stan
ford Geophysicist Mark Zoback.
Therefore, a major earthquake may "not
occur for several hundred years," he
said.
Zoback warned, however, that other
faults exist in the area that could
produce smaller earthquakes, such as
the one that occurred in Los Angeles

earlier this month.
The hypothetical "Big One" that is
supposed to "rock" California is ex
pected to measure eight on the Richter
scale. Such an earthquake would be 1000
