## Big plays key to Card win 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
There have been certain givens
in each of the Stanford football
team's three straight wins this
season.
The defense will do whatever it
takes to win — right down to the
last play of the game, if neces
sary.
Jeff James will catch at least
six passes, and one or two will be
spectacular.
And Alan Grant will run back a
lot of punts a long way.
Grant was named the Pacific
10 Conference Special Teams
Player of the Week for the
second time this year after his
performance against Oregon Sat
urday. The junior took a punt 61
yards to set up a 40-yard David
Sweeney field goal that proved to
be the margin of victory in Stan
ford's 13-10 win. Two weeks ago
Grant scored on a 77-yard punt
return against Washington State.
"That was a great punt return
by Alan Grant," Stanford Coach
Jack Elway said of Saturday's

return, which occured with Stan
ford trailing 10-2 in the third
quarter. "He got good blocking
upfield, hut the initial part of the
return was all Alan Grant. That
turned the game around."
Grant, who leads the Pac-10 in
punt returns, is second in the na
tion, averaging 19.9 yards per
return. (Oklahoma's Barry
Sanders leads with a 21 yards
per-return average.)
Senior wide receiver Jeff
James is also getting some much
deserved attention after an in
credible 28-yard reception Satur
day. "It was even more amazing
after we'd seen it on film," El
way said. "He went up exposed
and got a shot with a helmet right
in his chest but came down with
the football. That's typical of J.J.
— He works at every phase of
the game, including his blocking.
"At the end of the season I'll
probably say he's as good a
receiver as I've ever been associ
ated with," Elway said.
James, who started off quietly
with just 13 catches in the first
four games, has 20 receptions for

335 yards in Stanford's three vic
tories and has moved into fourth
place in the Cardinal career
reception list with 145 catches.
With six catches against Oregon,
James moved ahead of ex-
Stanford greats Ken Margerum
(141) and Tony Hill (140).
Despite playing vastly differ
ent kinds of football games, the
Cardinal defense has been the de
termining factor in the last two
Stanford victories. The defense
gave up 40 points to San Diego
State but held the A/tecs on their
final drive, as Grant knocked a
I odd Santos pass out of the end
zone on the final play of the
game.
Stanford gave up only 10
points to the Ducks, but again the
Cardinal defense had to >>top the
opponent in the final seconds of
the game. A Bill Musgrave pass
was batted around in the end
zone and fell incomplete as the
las{ seconds ticked off the clock.
"We gave up a lot of points
against San Diego State," Stan-

ford safety Brad Humphreys
said. "But we won. We're doing
what we have to to win. Winning
the game is our goal, and it will
be the rest of the season. The sta
tistics we don't care about any
more."
"They went in and played
every down with intensity," said
El way, who credited the Stan
ford defense with creating all
four Oregon turnovers. "They
played hard and they executed."
Humphreys, who leads the
team with three interceptions,
agreed that the Stanford defense
caused Oregon's two fumbles
and two interceptions (both of
which were tipped by Cardinal
defenders before they were inter

cepted.) "We made the turn
overs happen. It's a credit to the
defense and shows the emotion
we were playing with out there."
Humphreys, who caused a
fumble against the Ducks, is of
ten himself the beneficiary of
teammates forcing turnovers. "I
seem to come up with those
tipped interceptions all the
time," the senior said. "I'm a
real garbage man out there."
Curd notes
Doug Kohison is back in the na
tional rankings this week, hut even
with punts of 65, 56 and 56 yards
against Oregon, the senior slipped
some in average. Robison is third in
the country with a 46.3 yards per
punt average, behind California's
Scott Tabor, who has a 46.9 avarage
and Ohio State's Tom Tupa, who
leads the country with a 47.6-yard
average.
