# Card thrives under Geiger
## 
### 
Not many people know it, but
his name is actually Ferdinand.
Everyone just calls him Andy,
though, and most simply know
him as a winner.
He's Stanford Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger, and he runs
what is arguably the strongest
athletic program in the nation.
Geiger arrived on the Farm in
1979, and since then Stanford's
teams have been remarkably suc
cessful. In the 1980s Stanford's
18 national championships are
second only to UCLA, and no
school can top Stanford's eight
NCAA titles in the last two
years.

When Geiger talks about the
athletic program, though, he
doesn't even mention the na
tional championships.
"I've always thought that
Stanford could he a leader in my
field," Geiger said. "I've always
believed that you can be very
good at athletics and very good at
other things at the same time. My
goal for the intercollegiate pro
gram has been to provide the best
possible education through athle
tics. That has to be the bottom
line.
"We have more sports and
more students participating, and
I think the physical plant has
definitely improved," he said. "I
am incredibly proud of the
youngsters that represent Stan
ford. 1 am especially proud that
we have been able to be quite
good at so many things, and 1
don't think we've reached our
potential."
Stanford's program stands as a
beacon of integrity in the
troubled seas of intercollegiate
athletics, and several schools
have looked to Stanford as a
model for an athletic program.
This summer officials from
Southern Methodist University
visited the Farm for advice on
how to get its crippled program
back on track.

"I think you have to under
stand who you are and what
you're destined to be," Geiger
said of the wisdom he imparts to
other schools. "You have to take
things you can't change and
make them work for you. The ad
missions process at Stanford is
one of the best things we have
because it gives us a fail-safe.
"The other thing that's a big
part of the ethic is that, with the
exception of merit-based aid, we
don't treat athletes differently.
We don't stick out like a sore
thumb."
Geiger said he wants the athle
tic program to stand out on the
playing fields and in the class
rooms, not on the police blotter
or on the NCAA infractions list.
"Terror, absolute terror," is
what keeps Stanford in line, ac
cording to Geiger. "If we tarnish
this thing we'd be out of business
in two seconds flat and should
be. The other reason is a better
reason, and that is that you do
things honestly and in a straight
forward way."
The administration emphasizes
integrity, but it's the coaching
staff that puts this philosophy
into practice. Geiger calls selec
ting coaches "the most important
thing I do. First of all, is the per
son qualified? Then beyond that
is the real critical part, and that
is: Will the person understand
the Stanford individual and be
able to present his or her pro
gram in a way that is consistent
with other things at Stanford."
Geiger constantly emphasizes
integrating the athletic program
into the Stanford community,
and those who believe athletics is
the tail that wags the dog at Stan
ford should think again. During a
recent interview with The Daily,
Geiger called a coach into his of
fice to relate some negative feed
back he had received from the
faculty regarding freshman par
ticipation on an athletic trip.
While the coach noted that the
athletes were vital to the team,
Geiger reminded the coach not to
overlook the big picture and to
continue thinking "Stanford
first."
The message was clear: No
matter how brilliant or talented
the student athlete, academics
would take precedence, particu
larly in the case of this contest,

which was only an exhibition.
The Athletic Department has
not been without its problem*,
however. Perhaps foremost
among those problems was a
budget crunch two years ago that
forced Geiger to cut five varsity
sports. Since then all but softball
have been restored, but the cost
of maintaining 28 varsity inter
collegiate sports remains prohibi
tive.
Because it gives merit-based
scholarships, the Athletic De
partment until this year had
received no funds from the Uni
versity. Now the University has
begun to help fund sports like
crew and soccer, which give no
scholarships, and has probably
ensured the survival of several
programs.
"1 think that's a very good
compromise with the Univer
sity," Geiger said. "We're doing
a little better; we're out of the
red. We're leaner than we were
five or six years ago. We under
went a very stringent review, and
people liked what they saw."
Another problem for Geiger
has been related to behavior in
Stanford Stadium, both by the
Band and the fans. Geiger was
forced to discipline the Band last
year, and this season rowdiness
in the stands has led to talk of
banning alcohol in the stadium.
Playing policeman is a role
Geiger disdains, though.
"I think banning alcohol in the
stadium is the wrong way of sol
ving the problem," he said. "I'm
capable of making rules, but 1
don't enjoy doing it, and 1 don't
want to do it again."
Geiger has also spent time this
fall testifying in court for Stan
ford athletes Jennifer Hill and
Barry McKeever, who are suing
the NCAA over its drug-testing
policy.
"They've got a lot of guts,"
Geiger said of the pair. "I tell
you what, it's not easy. They and
we get a lot of criticism. Drug
testing is anathema to me."
The only time most athletic
directors spend in court is when
they are trying to get the star
halfback out of jail, and most
would cringe at the thought of
trying to mix Stanford's
academics with a successful ath
letic program. It's a role Geiger
relishes.
