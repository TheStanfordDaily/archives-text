# Chicano group and Food Service grapple
## MEChA seeks grape boycott 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Trying to gain student support for a statewide
grape boycott led by the United Farm Workers.
MEChA presented an informational program
detailing the dangers of pesticides last night in the
Casa Zapata lounge.
After a showing of the UFW film "The Wrath of
Grapes" to an audience of about 30 — including
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, Director of
Housing and Food Service Keith Guy and Assis
tant to the Provost Michael Jackson — UFW repre
sentative Dr. Marion Moses spoke about the ef
fects of toxic pesticides on farm workers and on
consumers.
Last May the ASSU Senate voted to support the
boycott, recommending that "all University Food
Service groups and Tresidder Union remove fresh

table grapes from campus until the UFW calls an
end to the boycott."
However, the Housing and Food Service Depart
ment did not respond to the ASSU bill, according
to members of MEChA, the Chicano student or
ganization.
"The University stopped serving grapes, but not
in support of the UFW, said Marc Pizarro of
MEChA. "They said it was more for economic
reasons, that grapes were too costly."
Over the summer and this quarter. Food Service
has served grapes, saying that it is should be a stu
dent's individual decision whether to boycott
grapes.
"We agreed not to serve grapes because they
were too costly for our budget," Guy said. "We
decided that the University can't be boycotting a
product to make a statement. We
urge students to get information
together and make individual
choices."
Guy said that if students stop
eating grapes served at Food Ser
vice, then grapes will not be
served. "It's the individual stu
dents that make their own state
ments," he said.
Five types of pesticides
believed to be carcinogens,
teratogens (which cause birth
defects) and mutagens (which
cause changes in genetic mate
rial) are alleged by the UFW to
be contained in pesticides used in
grape-growing regions of Cal
ifornia.
"Pesticides are poisons,"
Moses said. "Their purpose is to
kill."
According to Julio Calderon of

the Pesticide Management De
partment of the California De
partment of Food and
Agriculture, one of the pesticides
targeted by the UFW (Dinoseb)
was canceled last October, and
another, Captan, is under re
evaluation.
"We are requiring producers
and registrants of pesticides to
either initiate new studies, or in
some cases, continue current
studies," Calderon said.
"Certainly as long as we use
chemicals the concern has to be
there. In California we are con
stantly monitoring the chemicals
and constantly reviewing the
worker health and safety regula
tions."
The state is involved in a
"very rigorous enforcement" of
laws requiring workers to be ed
ucated about the use of pes
ticides and about proper safety
measures, according to Cal
deron.
According to Moses, who

works with the UFW and the
Canadian Farm Workers' Union,
grapes were chosen as the target
of the boycott because California
grows more grapes than any
other fresh produce and because
grape workers account for more
than half of pesticide-related ill
nesses.
In the past, boycotts have been
effective in forcing growers to
sign pacts banning pesticides,
Moses said. "We have to boycott
because the laws aren't
working," she said.
In addition to the farm
workers' exposure to toxic pes
ticides that has allegedly resulted
in cancer, birth defects and
death, Moses said, consumers
are also affected by the use of
pesticides.
Not only does fresh produce
absorb pesticides, she said, but
crop dusting, air blasting and soil
injection spread pesticides to
ground water and to the air.

"Pesticides are poisons,"
Moses said. "Their purpose is to
kill."
According to Julio Calderon of

the Pesticide Management De
partment of the California De
partment of Food and
Agriculture, one of the pesticides
targeted by the UFW (Dinoseb)
was canceled last October, and
another, Captan, is under re
evaluation.
"We are requiring producers
and registrants of pesticides to
either initiate new studies, or in
some cases, continue current
studies," Calderon said.
"Certainly as long as we use
chemicals the concern has to be
there. In California we are con
stantly monitoring the chemicals
and constantly reviewing the
worker health and safety regula
tions."
The state is involved in a
"very rigorous enforcement" of
laws requiring workers to be ed
ucated about the use of pes
ticides and about proper safety
measures, according to Cal
deron.
According to Moses, who

works with the UFW and the
Canadian Farm Workers' Union,
grapes were chosen as the target
of the boycott because California
grows more grapes than any
other fresh produce and because
grape workers account for more
than half of pesticide-related ill
nesses.
In the past, boycotts have been
effective in forcing growers to
sign pacts banning pesticides,
Moses said. "We have to boycott
because the laws aren't
working," she said.
In addition to the farm
workers' exposure to toxic pes
ticides that has allegedly resulted
in cancer, birth defects and
death, Moses said, consumers
are also affected by the use of
pesticides.
Not only does fresh produce
absorb pesticides, she said, but
crop dusting, air blasting and soil
injection spread pesticides to
ground water and to the air.
