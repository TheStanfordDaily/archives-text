# Undergraduate Admissions alters application form
## New essay questions set 
### Grace Ho 
High school students seeking admission to
Stanford will now need to answer one of two
new essay questions on their applications:
" Drawing upon some personal experience, write
a fable" and, "If you could change something in
your life, what would it be?"
The new requirement is the most significant
change made by the Committee on Undergradu
ate Admissions and Financial Aid in its annual
revision of the University's undergraduate appli
cation.
According to John Bunnell, assistant dean of
Undergraduate Admissions, the committee
devised the new essay topics in an effort to allow
applicants to present unique ideas or situations
from their lives that may explain why some of
their credentials do not fit traditional admissions
standards.
He added that the new questions, like the old
ones, provide applicants an opportunity to ex
hibit good writing skills.
Essay topics used in recent years have in
cluded: "Choose an adjective that best describes
you" and "Choose a favorite quote."
Bunnell said many former applicants were
frustrated because the "adjective question"

forced them to eliminate the vast pool of adjec
tives in the English language.
The admissions staff also felt that last year's
"quote question" generally did not allow admis
sions officials a deep enough understanding of
the applicants, Bunnell said.
He noted that this was "the first year that the
applicants were given a choice on the essay
questions. They do not necessarily have to
respond to the fable topic."
In past years, applicants had to answer all of
the given essay topics. Depending on the year,
the essay portion consisted of either two smaller
essays or one long essay.
"In addition," Bunnell said, "the essay is
only one factor in the overall admissions proc
ess. We are not trying to appeal to any particular
group. Plus, one just cannot stereotype the
'techies' as being less creative."
Every summer the admissions staff re
evaluates the essay topics, seeking ones that will
give the most insight into a person's writing abil
ity as well as personality, Bunnell said. Some
quesions are retained and used again, while
others are eliminated.
Of the two completed applications already
received this fall, Bunnell said, one addresses
the fable topic and the other answers the"event
from your life" question.
