# Vet says contras hurt Nicaraguans

### Leslie Hatamiya Staff writer 
The war now raging in Nicaragua is a war
not against communism but a war between
the contras and the Nicaraguan people, a
Vietnam veteran told a Stanford audience last
night.
In a speech that was part of Central Ameri
can Education Week, Harry Meserve, coor
dinator for the Santa Cruz-based Veterans
Peace Action Teams, told an audience of a
about 20 students in Schiff House that his
recent trip to Nicaragua convinced him that
the Nicaraguan people are "the real people
whom the war affects. These are the people
that the contras kill. They don't attack the
Sandinista army."

Meserve went to Nicaragua this summer
with nine other U.S. veterans to help his or
ganization rebuild war-torn villages. The
group went to the small village of El Cedro,
which has been devastated by the country's
civil war.
Meserve called seeing the poverty-striken
nation an "emotional experience" for the
veterans.
With slides to illustrate his experience in
Nicaragua, Meserve tried to dispose of some
misconceptions he said exist in the United
States about the present wartime situation in
Nicaragua.
Despite what he called present U.S. per
ceptions of a totally communist political at
mosphere in Nicaragua, Meserve said the
Nicaraguan government is a "real, live.

human (political) process."
Comparing Nicaragua to the United States,
Meserve praised the participation of the
Nicaraguan people in the running of the
country. "The U.S. is a country of extreme
wealth, yet most of us play no role in the gov
ernment, he said. "But in Nicaragua the
people have nothing, but there is a lot of par
ticipation in the government"
Meserve said the present revolution in
Nicaragua is a "revolution to reconstruct the
country," which he said has fallen into politi
cal and economic disarray as a result of a
1972 earthquake and seven years of warfare.
He said the movement seems to be very
popular among the Nicaraguans.
