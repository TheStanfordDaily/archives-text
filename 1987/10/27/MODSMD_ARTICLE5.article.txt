## Law prof. wins Packard support 
### Haru Connolly Senior staff writer 
Hewlett-Packard co-founder
and Stanford alumnus David
Packard has indicated he will en
dorse Stanford Law Prof. Tom
Campbell against incumbent
U.S. Rep. Ernie Konnyu for the
Republican nomination in the
12th Congressional District.
Campbell will announce the
endorsement at a press confer
ence this morning, according to
the Times Tribune.
Although Campbell declined to
acknowledge Packard's endorse
ment last night, he admitted that
the industrialist's support
"would signify leadership in
business and in the community,
while showing confidence (in the
candidate)."
"Packard is a politically well
known Republican leader,"
Campbell said. "(An endorse
ment] would be a show of confi
dence that I could lead the Re
publican Party (in the 12th dis
trict).'"
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Condoleezza Rice called Pack
ard's endorsement "quite signifi
cant."
"If Campbell gets the endorse
ment. it shows he is garnering
support from that aspect of busi
ness," Rice said. "It speaks well
for Tom Campbell." Rice had

been named as a possible candi
date in the race but said last
month that she would not run and
that she leaned toward support
ing Campbell.

"[An endorsement] would be a
big plus for Campbell, but
whether it will be a minus for
(incumbent Ernie) Konnyu, we
don't know," Rice said.
Konnyu, who received Pack
ard's endorsement in 1986, has
been quoted as saying that Pack
ard's is a significant endorse
ment.
