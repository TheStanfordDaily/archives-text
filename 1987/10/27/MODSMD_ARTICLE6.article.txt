A $1 million gift to the Stan
ford Centennial Campaign an
nounced yesterday will provide
selected undergraduates with
funding for research in the natu
ral and social sciences, according
to the director of Undergraduate
Research Opportunities Clear
inghouse.
"(The grant] opens up doors
for undergraduates who other
wise would not be able to do re
search," said URO Director
Laura Selznick. "The money will
be concentrated on areas where
there is a need. Right now this is
in the natural and social sciences
and interdisciplinary areas."
The donation was made by
Stanford Trustee Mel Lane and
his wife, Joan. Mel Lane chairs a
local publishing company, while
Joan Lane is special assistant to
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Norman Wessells.
According to Selznick, the
money will go toward three types
of URO funds currently available

to undergraduates: small grants
of $500 or less, major grants of up
to $2500 or Golden Grants,
awarded for the humanities and
creative arts. The first grants
from the LajVÂ£ gift will be
awarded this spring.
Joan Lane said she hopes the
gift will allow undergraduates to
"work closely with professors.
That one-to-one relationship with
both subject matter and faculty
member is so important."
Undergraduates apply for re
search funds through the URO.
I he URO funded % of 126 appli
cants last spring.
"We try to help undergradu
ates develop an area of expertise
and knowledge which is their
own,'' Selznick said.
Among the students who
received funding through the
URO last year is senior Keltie
Jones, who went to Zimbabwe to
study the government's racial im
migration policies.
"It's the best thing I've ever
done because I have a real sense
of how things are changing
there,"' said Jones.
