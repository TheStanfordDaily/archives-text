## Virus prominent on campuses 
### Jason Bloomstein 
Between 30,(KM) and 80,000 students
on American college campuses carry a
contagious form of the AIDS virus, ac
cording to Dr. Richard Keeling, chair
of the American College Health Asso
ciation AIDS Task Force.
As part of a slide presentation last
night in Roble Hall, Keeling said carri
ers of the disease have an asymp
tomatic form of the disease that is not
identifiable without medical tests. He
also stressed that many carriers of the
disease will not develop a fatal, "major
manifestion" of AIDS.
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
volunteered last winter to present the
slide show at Stanford, but withdrew
his offer in the summer because of
"othei committments," Keeling said.
The surgeon general s speech at
Stanford was to have been the first in a
series of seminars delivered across the
country.
Keeling also said 300,000 to 400,000

cases of AIDS w ill be reported by 1991,
when the disease will cause an esti
mated 54,000 deaths per year. By the
mid-19905, AIDS will be the most com
mon cause of death for people between
19 and 50 years of age, he said.
Though most carriers of AIDS have
the asymptomatic form, he said, a
small percentage have an AIDS related
virus, and very few have the deadly,
"full-blown" form.
Keeling said 15 percent of those with
the hidden version will develop a termi
nal case within 5 years of contracting
it, and 36 percent will develop a termi
nal case within 7 years and 2 months.
Keeling said he is skeptical about the
accuracy of some of the methods cur
rently used to diagnose the disease. He
said a positive test only signals the ex
istence of an antibody and "produces
no clinical information. I ests tell noth
ing about one's health, only about ex
posure to the virus." Many who have
been exposed to AIDS do not develop
the fatal form, he said.

The long incubation period for some
forms of AIDS also may help hide its
presence, and the disease may appear
later, he said. " This makes some tests
questionable."
Keeling also addressed what he
called misconceptions about how the
virus can be transmitted. He said living
in the same house with an AIDS vic
tim. eating food handled by an infected
person, coughing, sneezing, casual kis
sing and caring for AIDS patients pose
no health risks to non-infected people.
He said AIDS can only be transmit
ted through unprotected heterosexual
or homosexual intercourse, or blood
transmission through blood transfu
sions, childbirth or the sharing of in
travenous needles.

Keeling said percent of AIDS vic
tims are male homosexuals or
bisexuals. 17 percent are intravenous
drug users and 4 percent are
