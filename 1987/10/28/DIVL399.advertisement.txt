COMMITTEE OF THE WEEK
CAPER - The Committee on Athletics, Physical Education & Recreation.
CAPER investigates issues in the Athletic department — from Club sports funding to new
plans in athletic facilities. It is a very active committee as 2 weeks ago, when the
University was considering banning alcohol in the stadium, the student members pressed
the Administration hard to let the students have a chance to regulate themselves at the
next game — and it worked! Thanks to the student members who made their presence
felt.

So, if you want to raise an issue concerning athletics, etc. — these are the people to
contact.
Place a referendum on the Fall ballot
There will be an all-campus election on November 17 and 18. One of the things that can
be voted on are referenda — where the student body votes yes or no on a specific
resolution. In the past we have had referenda on issues ranging from divestment to the
preservation of the Foothills. So, if you want to find out what your peers think about a
particular issue, design your own referendum and get it placed on the ballot. For more
details, call Steve Baer, Elections Guru, at 723-4331.
