# University establishes new office

Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons announced
yesterday that Michael Jackson, formerly assistant
to the Provost, will head a newly organized Office
of Campus Affairs.
The University created the office as a way to
more directly address the concerns of minority and
other student organizations.
According to Lyons, the office, organized under
the Office of Student Affairs, will provide student
groups improved means of communication with the
University administration.
"The Office of Campus Affairs is a re
arrangement of the way things used to be," Lyons
said. "The formation signals to us that there will be
more attention to helping student organizations
with additional support."
The new office will be responsible for Student
Organization Services, El Centro Chicano, the
Black Community Services Center, the Asian
American Cultural Center, the Native American
Affairs Center, the Office of Fraternal Affairs and
the ASSU adviser and liaison. The Childcare
Resource Center and the Disability Resource Cen
ter will become part of the office within the next
year.
Currently, Tresidder Union oversees these or
ganizations. Student minority groups have
charged, however, that Tresidder is not sufficiently
responsive to minority needs.
Black Student Union Chair Bill King said the
BSU found it "unusual" that Tresidder was in
charge of minority groups. "Tresidder is such a big
operation that it couldn't be responsive to the
Black Community Services Center," he said.
The announcement of the creation of the new Of
fice of Campus Affairs was met with generally posi
tive comment from campus minority leaders.
"Because we (will) report directly to Michael Jack
son, there is one less barrier in terms of responsive
ness," King said.
Vivian Wu, a representative of the Asian Ameri
can Student Association, said that with the increas
ing complexity of minority issues, Jackson has
been "very helpful, definitely positive."
King said he is optimistic about working with
Jackson. "By having a minority in the position of
Jackson, that just adds a level of not only sympathy
but also empathy."
Jackson, who previously worked as assistant
dean of Student Affairs and as assistant to the Vice
President and Provost, said he will try "to give a
new emphasis to campus affairs. We are trying to
be more responsive to student needs."
Jackson said he began working on the Office of
Campus Affairs at the beginning of this quarter,
primarily searching for staff members for the Black
Community Services Center and for the Asian
American Cultural Center.
"We are trying to bring groups together, to give
consistency to leadership and are looking to joint
programming," he said.
"This is a really exciting opportunity to give a
new emphasis to student activities," Jackson said.
"There is a real sense that students learn a lot by
getting involved in activities. It complements what
they learn in the classroom, because education
