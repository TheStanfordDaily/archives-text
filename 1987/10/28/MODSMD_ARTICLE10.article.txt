## Shultz, Shevardnadze to meet 
### 
WASHINGTON — In another surprise
diplomatic move, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze is expected to come
here Friday and Saturday for new negotia
tions on a U.S.-Soviet summit meeting and
on the final points of a new medium-range
missile arms agreement, a U.S. official said
yesterday.
Joint announcement of the visit, which
could put U.S.-Soviet relations back on track
after being derailed last week, is planned to
be made here and in Moscow Today, the offi
cial said.
Despite the new Soviet overture, there was
no immediate sign that Moscow had softened
its stand of linking a summit to limits on
"Star Wars," formally known as the Strate
gic Defense Initiative, the administration's
space defense program. A Soviet spokesman
said a visit by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev "will take place when" both sides agree
to a medium-range missile accord and to key
provisions of another agreement on space
defenses and long-range offensive missiles.
The administration has refused to negotiate
curbs on "Star Wars" work, and before last
week's setback had also believed that the
Soviets would require only a medium-range

missile agreement for a summit to take place.
The Kremlin, however, renewed its previous
linkage of "Star Wars" to the summit and
missile pact — an unexpected development
that was held mainly responsible for the fail
ure of Secretary of State George Shultz's
two-day visit to Moscow.
Nonetheless, the fact that the Soviets re
quested the invitation for Shevardnadze this
week suggested that something had changed
in the Kremlin's approach to the issues.
Some U.S. officials expressed the view that
the superpowers, despite their ups and
downs, were still moving toward a summit
this year.
Word of the Shevardnadze visit surprised
U.S. officials here because Shultz himself
seemed to discourage speculation about such
a trip as he left Moscow. Shultz, asked about
a "further meeting'' between him and
Shevardnadze, replied carefully at that time:
"That remains to be seen . . . but 1 don't
think there is anything in particular to meet
about right away."
On Yesterday, however, Shultz appeared
decidedly more optimistic. "An agreement
on intermediate-range nuclear missiles is
very close to being completed. We have

made advances in a number of other areas,
he told reporters after a closed session with
House members.
"So I think it makes sense to imagine that
there will be continuing discussions in trying
to button these things up/' he added. "1
think things are on a reasonably good track.
After being briefed by Shultz at the
Capitol, Sen. Claiborne Fell (D-R.1.), chair
man of the Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee, described the on-again, off-again plans
for a superpower summit as consistent with
the Soviet pattern of negotiations. "They al
ways go one-step backward and one-and-one
half step ahead," he said.
Pell added that the U.S. and the Soviet Un
ion are very close to completing an INF
agreement. "In my mind," he said, Shultz
"has come back with an agreement 98 per
cent complete."
When Shultz went to Moscow last week, a
late November summit had been predicted.
But, while both sides said a missile agree
ment was within reach in two or three weeks,
he left the Soviet Union on Friday without a
summit date from Gorbachev. 1 he Soviet
leader did suggest, however, that a December
summit might be possible.
