# Stocks rise in heavy trading
## 
### 
NEW YORK — The stock
market staged a tenuous rally
yesterday. Buoyed by overnight
gains in Japan and Hong Kong,
stock prices rose sharply at the
opening but then sputtered as jit
tery investors lost their nerve
and used the rebound as a chance
to get out of the market.
After springing to an 85-point
gain in the first 30 minutes of
trading, the closely watched Dow
Jones industrial average finished
the truncated session with a
52.55-point gain in brisk trading
to recover about a third of Mon
day's 156-point loss.
But the Dow's strong showing
— its eighth-largest point gain for
a single day — was largely the
doing of a last-minute spree by
buyers of blue-chip stocks, most
of which finished the day higher.

Broader market gauges turned in
mixed performances.
"There is more trouble a
head," predicted Alfred Gold
man, a market strategist with the
A.G. Edwards investment firm in
St. Louis. "To jump out so
strongly and then be so com
placent is a sign of a market that
has not bottomed yet."
This was not the only thing
troubling market analysts and
traders yesterday.
The dollar deteriorated to lows
not seen since the early 1980s
against the West German mark
and the British pound, which
some analysts fear will set the
stage for another round of losses
in overseas stock markets today.
The stock market's gains also
came at the expense of bond
prices, which gave back the

sharp gains they registered on
Monday, when another wave of
investors fled stocks.
In addition, investors virtually
ignored what should have been a
psychological lift: news of a $1
billion stock buyback plan by In
ternational Business Machines
Corp. IBM's stock price rose a
strong $6.50 per share yesterday
to close at $118.50, but the news
barely budged the Dow, and in
fact the indicator began a steady
retreat shortly after the plan was
announced.
Investors also shrugged off a
statement from President Reagan
issued by the White House
shortly before noon in which, de
parting from his earlier assertions
that the market turmoil was
merely a correction, he warned
of "potential economic dangers"

on the horizon.
Wall Street's reaction? "Ab
solutely none," said Ernie Rud
net, manager of block trading at
Mabon Nugent & Co. in New
York.
"It's nice to see that the reality
phase has finally hit the White
House," said Michael Metz, a
market strategist for Oppen
heimer & Co. "But as you can
see from the market's response,
it is too late; the market is out of
control now."
Although Goldman and other
market analysts were encouraged
by the "placid tone' 1 that
returned to Wall Street yesterday
for the first time in more than a
week, many agreed that the mar
ket has now taken on a life of its
own.
