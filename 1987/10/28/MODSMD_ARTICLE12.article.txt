# Fruit fly threat contained

Santa Clara County agricultural workers have
found no new fruit flies during the second in a se
ries of four fruit fly "baitings" on the Stanford
campus, according to the county commissioner.
The baitings follow extensive spraying that
began after two Oriental fruit flies were found
Sept. 28 in traps in Palo Alto.
Because no new flies have been detected, offi
cials are confident that there is no danger of a
fruit fly infestation in the area. However,
baitings will continue over the next four months
to insure that the fruit fly is eradicated from the
Stanford-Palo Alto area, according to Greg Van
Wassenhove, agricultural commissioner for
Santa Clara County.
After four months, the baiting will most likely
be discontinued, barring another trapping in the
area, Van Wassenhove said.
Workers have been baiting trees and tele
phone poles since Oct. 8 as part of a three-month
effort to thwart the emergence of an Oriental

fruit fly population in the area.
The baitings cover a 7.5-square-mile area
around College Terrace, where the flies were
first discovered.
About 10 to 15 percent of the baiting area is on
Stanford's campus. Van Wassenhove said. Fruit
flies are primarily confined to areas with a high
density of fruit trees, he added, noting that Stan
ford's Foothills are covered with fields and oak
trees that aren't conducive to a fruit fly out
break.
The Oriental fruit fly is considered to be more
dangerous to citrus crops than the Mediter
ranean fruit fly, which caused mtyor crop fail
ures in California in 1981.
If the outbreak were allowed to proceed un
checked. it could cost California "hundreds of
millions of dollars," said John Connell, program
supervisor of the California Department of Food
and Agriculture. The Palo Alto-area extermina
tion is expected to cost between $80,000 and
$100,000.
