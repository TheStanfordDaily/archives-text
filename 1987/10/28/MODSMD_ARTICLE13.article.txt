For President Reagan, last week had to seem
like a nightmare from which he could not awake.
It was one of the most woeful weeks for the
United States in recent memory. The stock mar
ket crashed, the U.S. strike against an Iranian oil
platform had little effect on Iran, the nomination
of Judge Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court
was finally curbed by a rude majority in the Sen
ate, and on Friday Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev backed away from negotiating a date for an
arms control summit meeting.
The events of last week represent more than
mud in the face for Reagan. They represent a
marked failure of his administration's rigid and
unrealistic approach to government.
His budgeting and foreign policies are being
called into question, and it is evident that his for
merly firm grip on the nation is beginning to slip.
The president now stands at a crossroads in
his administration. With about a year left in his
tenure, he can retrench and, in the process, most
likely set the nation on a course for worse disas
ter. Or he can step back and take a long look at
his policies and his goals for the country.
Clearly, there is a need for action. The stock
market is rebounding slowly, if at all. The Su
preme Court, lacking a ninth justice, is having to
postpone consideration of the most significant
cases on its calendar, and the U.S. policy in the
Persian Gulf lacks direction and clear purpose.
There is also clearly a need for flexibility on
the part of the president. Congress has demon
strated that it will not bow unquestioningly to his
demands. It is imperative that the president find
a middle ground on which he can conduct mean
ingful dialogue with the legislative branch and
arrive at some compromises. And Congress, for
its part, must be willing to work with the presi
dent in the reassessment and modification of
existing policy.

The president must clearly define the scope
and limits of the U.S. commitment in the Persian
Gulf. The events of last week made it clear that
U.S. military moves won't have a great effect on
the ongoing Gulf war.
The president must find a Supreme Court
nominee who won't alienate whole sections of
the American public, as Bork did. If he is wise,
he will not make a mockery of the nomination
system by following through on his senseless
threat to nominate a judge who will be even
more objectionable to the Senate than Bork was.
Hopefully, the president will bring an open
mind to budget discussions with Congress. Last
week's crash called attention to the fact that the
economy isn't altogether stable after all.
Although the economy may not lapse into
recession immediately, the fact remains that the
nation will eventually reap the bitter economic
harvest sowed in the growing federal deficit.
Some measures, whether they be tax raises or
budget cuts or a combination thereof, must be
taken to make significant reductions in the
country's annual budget.
Reagan must also be flexible in dealing with
the Soviet Union. Both sides will have to give
ground if any meaningful progress is to be made
in arms control negotiations. Reagan's unyield
ing support of the Strategic Defense Initiative is
and will remain a significant obstacle to negotia
tions. For the sake of peace and strategic
stability he should abandon the program.
The nation is now in a time of crisis worse
than it has faced at any other time during the
Reagan administration. How quickly and effec
tively the president responds to this crisis will
largely determine the tone and achievements of
the remainder of his term. It will also lay the
groundwork for the administration to follow.
