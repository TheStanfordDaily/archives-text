Good to be frank
about mixed race
I am writing in support of Jen
nifer Hansen and her column,
"Coping with Cultural Schizo
phrenia" (Oct. 13). 1 am also of
mixed racial heritage. Most
people think of me as black,
which is only partly correct. 1
have more Caucasian and
Cherokee blood than black, but
Hansen is right when she says
that strangers usually decide this
very personal issue without any
input from the person in ques
tion.
The confusion and sometimes
the pain that come from not fit
ting into other people's racial and
ethnic concepts is substantial.
We didn't create ourselves, and
we are not responsible for the
bigotry and insensitivity that per
meate this society. 1 wholeheart
edly agree that more should be
done in academic forums to bet
ter understand the special prob
lems we face daily.
I think Hansen is to be con
gratulated for her frankness on
this subject. We live in a society
that hasn't yet adjusted to ac

cepting blacks, Asians, Native
Americans and Latinos as
equals. So it stands to reason that
those of us who are the offspring
of mixed marriages would have
an even more difficult time. The
irony is that America has often
referred to itself as the great mel
ting pot. Perhaps someday we
will be respected for our ex
panded knowledge instead of]
being slighted and shunned.

Hoover ties help
moderate left bias
Among Stanford's few remain
ing redeeming values is its asso
ciation with the Hoover Institu
tion. Not only does the Hoover
Library represent one of the na
tion's finest academic resources,
but the institution's moderating
influence on the otherwise
predominantly left-wing bias
within the overall Stanford com
munity directly enhances the
University's national reputation
as a truly diverse and, indeed,
liberal university.
To suggest, as does a recent
Daily article on Hoover (Oct.

26), that "some argue that
Hoover receives money that
would otherwise go to Stanford"'
is absolutely ludicrous, since a
great many donors give to Stan
ford precisely because of its as
sociation with Hoover.
Furthermore, as stated in the
final paragraph of the article,
when self- proclaimed Marxist
professor John Manley opposes
any association with Hoover, 1
can think of no better reason to
retain such linkage.

Faith restored
Two days ago I received a
phone call from the School of Ed
ucation informing me that my
wallet, which had been lost for
nearly a month, had just been
turned in by a student. Even
more amazing, when I picked it
up everything — including a large
amount of cash from my summer
earnings — was intact. Thank
you, whoever you are. You
really made my day — and
restored my faith in the Stanford
community.
