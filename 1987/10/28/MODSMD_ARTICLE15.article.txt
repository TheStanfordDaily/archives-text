## Recognize U.S.-Soviet similarity 
### 
Believing in a new theory of society, a
small group of determined individuals over
threw an autocratic and distant government
that had ruled for hundreds of years. The first
of its kind anywhere in the world, the experi
ment in government had many critics who
predicted collapse, only to be proven wrong.

Marshall Wilson

With huge stocks of natural resources and
stretching across a continent, the new nation
underwent radical changes resulting in indus
trialization and the raising of living standards.
Dozens ol ethnic groups populate the nation.
The people are proud of their accomplish
ments. Though faced with problems of pollu
tion and resource depletion, they can
overcome any obstacle if they work together.
This may sound like a history of the United
States, but it is not. This is a description of
the Soviet Union.
Strikingly similar in many ways, our com
mon experiences are overlooked by many
and ignored by most of our elected officials.
For years we have heard the Soviet Union
described as "the evil empire," the Russians
as "godless communists" and have been told
they don't even have a word for freedom. We
distrust and hate them because they are noth
ing at all like us. We have nothing in com
mon.
The key to understanding any present ac
tion is knowing its historical context. A fun

damental problem with U.S. foreign policy
has always been the tendency to look at any
situation only from the perspective of the
United States. We cannot begin to under
stand the Soviets until we recognize their
past and how similar and how different it is
from our own.
Just as Locke and Rousseau gave intellec
tual justification to the founders of the Ameri
can experiment in democracy, Marx and Kn
gels justified the Soviet experiment in
socialism. Erupting at different points in his
tory, both revolutions were based on the
dominant social theory of the day â€” the En
lightenment spawned American democracy,
and social disruption gave birth to the Bol
shevik Revolution. Democracy was a radical
theory in the 18th century, no less radical
than Bolshevism 140 years later.
The United States, the first mass
democracy in the world, became the revolu
tionary model for all oppressed peoples
during the latter part of the 18th and early
19th centuries. A century later, the Soviet
Union, the first nation based on the principles
of scientific socialism, became the new model
for people wanting a better life. Things do
change.
Similar in many ways, differences exist
that have a bearing on relations between the
powers. History has given rise to different
theories on the role of the individual. Ameri
can mythology stresses the individual over
coming all obstacles. Soviet beliefs stress col
lectivism. Soviet Russia has been conquered
many times throughout history and has seen
many invading armies and rulers. As a means

of survival, the people have clung together,
and these thought patterns still exist today.
From the start, the Bolshevik Revolution
came under seige from within and without.
The World Wars nearly destroyed the nation,
killing millions and strangling its economy.
Conquered and at war so often, the Russians
developed a seige mentality, and many Soviet
actions can he seen as a means of creating se
curity. We might not necessarily agree with
the action, hut we may deal with it better if
we understand why it was taken.
Population and technology have made our
world much smaller than it once was. As
humans sharing the same planet, we face
many of the same problems. Pollution, nu
clear waste and resource depletion affect us
all. The average Soviet citizen does not want
war any more than the average American.
War has been much more devastating for the
Soviets than it has been for us in the last
hundred years.
We are different, and a healthy dose of
skepticism should accompany any negotia
tions. A knowledge of history and similarities
will not solve all the problems of the world.
This is not a call to blindly trust and appease
the Soviets, only to look at the world from
the point of view of others.
To see things from others' perspectives
will allow us to see the real problems of the
world without filtering out what we do not
want to see and clinging to our biases. It
won't solve all our problems, but it can't
hurt.
