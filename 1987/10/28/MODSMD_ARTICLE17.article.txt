# Education thwarts learning
## 
### 
Way back at the other end of this educational
hegira, when 1 was in first grade, we were intro
duced to the words for colors by being shown cards
with the word for the color written atop a field of
that particular color. I distinctly remember won
dering as I saw the orange card how any of us could
know that we were really seeing the same color.
It was clear my classmates and I were looking at
the same thing, but how did I know that if I looked
through the eyes of Billy, the class clown, 1
wouldn't see the word "orange" superimposed on
what I'd normally call a purple card? We all
seemed to be agreeing to call this sensation
"orange" without really being able to know for
sure that it was the same sensation for all of us. Oh,
1 accepted the convention, of course — the defini
tion and transmission of such conventional knowl
edge is the core of what being educated is all about.
However, I've always wondered what fantastic
colors are being seen through other eyes.

There seems to me to be a crucial difference be
tween education and learning. Education is about
definition and convention, about honing and refin
ing our concepts so that if we can't really know that
we're talking about the same reality, we can at least
agree that we're talking about the same abstrac
tion. This is important. No, really, it is. We
couldn't even begin to communicate without
relying upon this delicate house of cards we call
conventional knowledge, with all its tacit assump
tions and hidden biases. You are able, for what it's
worth, to read this column precisely because you
and 1 share largely the *Hme educational base. That
is, these words mean roughly the same for you as
they do for me.
Learning, on the other hand, is about wonder
and experience. It is the personalization of knowl
edge. it's about taking what you're taught and
making it wholly and completely your own. We
can, after all, only learn those things that make
sense to us in the larger context of who we are, and
often the things we learn, while concrete and inter
nalized, cannot be described by the concepts and
words of conventional knowledge.
For instance, try to describe to yourself what
you learned when you were first in love and naked
with another. Conventional knowledge might make
that moment seem no more than obscene, but that
would miss the point of what it really meant, right?
Learning is in many ways about seeing the world
through new eyes, for what we learn ultimately
changes to some degree who we are in an absolute
sense.
So, is Stanford an educational institution or a
learning institution?
Yeah, that's a loaded and unfair question the
way I've set things up here, but it is, nevertheless,

a question well worth considering. I think we can
all agree that all schools, from kindergarten on up
to these lofty heights, are primarily educational in
their focus. Furthermore, there is a genuine value
to that education ($4252 a quarter, if I can trust our
noble bursar). It behooves me not to scoff too
much at the educational system since I've been a
part of it for such a long time; nevertheless, "there
are," to quote Doonesbury, "still a few bugs in the
system."
In kindergarten the teacher put up this big piece
of light brown butcher paper and wrote all our
names on it with a big black marker. Every time we
did something good she'd put a little metallic green,
blue or red star next to our name, and if we did
something really exceptional we'd get a big gold
one instead.
Remember how good it felt to get that big gold
star? We haven't changed much, have we? The big
brown sheet of paper is now a little pink piece of
paper, but the idea's the same. Our primary moti
vation in school is perceived to be the same "good
dog/bad dog" reward system into which we were
inducted at age six. This motivation seems to be
just fine until that woeful day that the "good dog"
head pats stop coming so easily and we're abruptly
faced with the reality of being a "bad dog."
There's a Peter Principle in operation here: We
tend to continue our education until we rise to the
level of our incompetence. I pretty much breezed
through college, but when I came here to grad
school I often found myself in the nether regions of
many of my classes. I felt awful until I realized a
few things.
First, grades can't quantify learning, and even if
your performance relative to your classmates is
poor, the material that you do understand and learn
is often quite rewarding in its own right. Second,
tying your sense of self-worth to some externa],
abstract and arbitrary measure like grades really is
stupid. Finally, struggling and flailing over courses
around here is not all that uncommon; there really
is no reason to feel like such a martyr.
People talk, in general, about the failure of edu
cation in terms of certain basic skills that are not
conveyed to a certain percentage of people. This is
certainly a bad thing, but for me the real problem
with education is that it can often get in the way of
learning.
I think what's important for all of us on a per
sonal level is that, even when we're flailing around
with concepts it seems we just cannot understand
that it's what we learn that matters. This is a great
wonder and a great joy; We cannot cease to learn,
and further, there really is nothing that, at the core,
is beyond our reach to learn.
Sure, sometimes it just takes time and patience
we don't seem to have, and we do have our limits.
But the fact remains that beyond the constraints of
conventional knowledge, in the realm of imagina
tion and heart, we are all capable of sharing and
knowing the fantastic colors and lore that have
been seen through other eyes. And that, ultimately,
is what learning is all about.

Learning is in many ways about seeing the world
through new eyes, for what we learn ultimately
changes to some degree who we are in an absolute
sense.
So, is Stanford an educational institution or a
learning institution?
Yeah, that's a loaded and unfair question the
way I've set things up here, but it is, nevertheless,

a question well worth considering. I think we can
all agree that all schools, from kindergarten on up
to these lofty heights, are primarily educational in
their focus. Furthermore, there is a genuine value
to that education ($4252 a quarter, if I can trust our
noble bursar). It behooves me not to scoff too
much at the educational system since I've been a
part of it for such a long time; nevertheless, "there
are," to quote Doonesbury, "still a few bugs in the
system."
In kindergarten the teacher put up this big piece
of light brown butcher paper and wrote all our
names on it with a big black marker. Every time we
did something good she'd put a little metallic green,
blue or red star next to our name, and if we did
something really exceptional we'd get a big gold
one instead.
Remember how good it felt to get that big gold
star? We haven't changed much, have we? The big
brown sheet of paper is now a little pink piece of
paper, but the idea's the same. Our primary moti
vation in school is perceived to be the same "good
dog/bad dog" reward system into which we were
inducted at age six. This motivation seems to be
just fine until that woeful day that the "good dog"
head pats stop coming so easily and we're abruptly
faced with the reality of being a "bad dog."
There's a Peter Principle in operation here: We
tend to continue our education until we rise to the
level of our incompetence. I pretty much breezed
through college, but when I came here to grad
school I often found myself in the nether regions of
many of my classes. I felt awful until I realized a
few things.
First, grades can't quantify learning, and even if
your performance relative to your classmates is
poor, the material that you do understand and learn
is often quite rewarding in its own right. Second,
tying your sense of self-worth to some externa],
abstract and arbitrary measure like grades really is
stupid. Finally, struggling and flailing over courses
around here is not all that uncommon; there really
is no reason to feel like such a martyr.
People talk, in general, about the failure of edu
cation in terms of certain basic skills that are not
conveyed to a certain percentage of people. This is
certainly a bad thing, but for me the real problem
with education is that it can often get in the way of
learning.
I think what's important for all of us on a per
sonal level is that, even when we're flailing around
with concepts it seems we just cannot understand
that it's what we learn that matters. This is a great
wonder and a great joy; We cannot cease to learn,
and further, there really is nothing that, at the core,
is beyond our reach to learn.
Sure, sometimes it just takes time and patience
we don't seem to have, and we do have our limits.
But the fact remains that beyond the constraints of
conventional knowledge, in the realm of imagina
tion and heart, we are all capable of sharing and
knowing the fantastic colors and lore that have
been seen through other eyes. And that, ultimately,
is what learning is all about.

Way back at the other end of this educational
hegira, when 1 was in first grade, we were intro
duced to the words for colors by being shown cards
with the word for the color written atop a field of
that particular color. I distinctly remember won
dering as I saw the orange card how any of us could
know that we were really seeing the same color.
It was clear my classmates and I were looking at
the same thing, but how did I know that if I looked
through the eyes of Billy, the class clown, 1
wouldn't see the word "orange" superimposed on
what I'd normally call a purple card? We all
seemed to be agreeing to call this sensation
"orange" without really being able to know for
sure that it was the same sensation for all of us. Oh,
1 accepted the convention, of course — the defini
tion and transmission of such conventional knowl
edge is the core of what being educated is all about.
However, I've always wondered what fantastic
colors are being seen through other eyes.

There seems to me to be a crucial difference be
tween education and learning. Education is about
definition and convention, about honing and refin
ing our concepts so that if we can't really know that
we're talking about the same reality, we can at least
agree that we're talking about the same abstrac
tion. This is important. No, really, it is. We
couldn't even begin to communicate without
relying upon this delicate house of cards we call
conventional knowledge, with all its tacit assump
tions and hidden biases. You are able, for what it's
worth, to read this column precisely because you
and 1 share largely the *Hme educational base. That
is, these words mean roughly the same for you as
they do for me.
Learning, on the other hand, is about wonder
and experience. It is the personalization of knowl
edge. it's about taking what you're taught and
making it wholly and completely your own. We
can, after all, only learn those things that make
sense to us in the larger context of who we are, and
often the things we learn, while concrete and inter
nalized, cannot be described by the concepts and
words of conventional knowledge.
For instance, try to describe to yourself what
you learned when you were first in love and naked
with another. Conventional knowledge might make
that moment seem no more than obscene, but that
would miss the point of what it really meant, right?
