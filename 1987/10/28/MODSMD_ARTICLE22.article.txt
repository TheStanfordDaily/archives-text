## Self-defense class combats violence and vulnerability 
### Lisa Brooks Staff writer 
Since the spring of 1985 the
Women Defending Ourselves
collective at Stanford has
devoted itself to teaching
women's self-defense, ending vi
olence against women and
children and stopping racism.
WDO addresses these con
cerns by teaching SWOPSI 174,
Issues in Seli-Defense for
Women, by sponsoring other
classes through the YWCA.
"There's a common miscon
ception that we're a man-haters'
group," said Tricia Lambie, a
member of the collective.
"We're not man-haters â€”
we're just trying to educate
women about violence," she
said.
The collective attempts to edu
cate by teaching both physical
and mental self-defense tech
niques. "We spend between one
and one-and-a-half hours (twice a
week) on physical techniques,
and a half hour to an hour doing
assertiveness training," Lambie
said.
"This is where a lot of
(students) get the most out of the
class, because we do a lot of role
playing and act out situations
where they might have problems
being assertive," she added.
"This teaches a 'way of being'
that gives them confidence and
keeps them out of potential
(dangerous) situations because
they don't have the attitude of
being a victim."
The group also spends an hour
of each class period discussing
course readings and the students'
personal feelings.
"It's the combination of these
three parts that changes people's
lives," Lambie said.
Amy Francetic, a junior with

an independantly designed major
who is currently enrolled in the
class, concurred with Lambie.
"I'm already more aware (of is
sues in self-defense) and feel
more secure knowing techniques
to defend myself. I'm a lot more
alert," she said, adding that "the
class is very enthusiastic and the
things we talk about are really
personal."
Vija Brookshire, a junior
majoring in political science who
took the course during her fresh
man year, said, "It completely
changed my life."
"I was impressed by that class
because most self-defense
courses just deal with physical
techniques," she said.
"This (class] also deals with
why women are in the position of
being potential victims," Brook
shire said, referring to the class
discussions and readings.
Susannah Mackaye, a recent
Stanford graduate who has been
teaching the class since 1985,
said the class may enable a
woman to prevent assault but
cautioned that there is always a
possibility that an attack will
happen despite an individual's
training.
"You cannot account for
every possible situation," she
said.
"However, through the class
you can learn to protect yourself
emotionally if it does happen",
MacKaye said.
Some people believe that self
defense classes may actually be
detrimental to women, causing
them to become overconfident
and place themselves in danger
ous situations.
"This is a big concern espe
cially to 'significant others'
(lovers and friends) who attend
the class's graduation at the end
of the quarter," MacKaye said.

"My experience is that women
don't become overconfident be
cause the people coming in (to
take the class) have greater fear
(about assaults) than reality war
rants, and it would take a lot to
overcome that," she added.
"I think overconfidence is a
myth," Brookshire said.
"You're not going to be stupid
and walk into a bad neighbor
hood once you've taken this
class," she said.
According to Brookshire, mis
conceptions about overcon
fidence are spread by "a male
power class that doesn't want
women realizing they have

power and can protect them
selves."
Lori Wedemeyer, the commu
nity education coordinator for
the Palo Alto Rape Crisis Center,
acknowledged that there are
some classes that can do more
harm than good, especially for
women who have already been
victims of assault.
"The idea is to empower the
student, not the instructor, and
some classes don't do this," she
said.
Wedemeyer emphasized that
the Stanford class is not like this,
and said she feels it is one of the
best in the area.

"We (the Palo Alto Center)
sometimes hold 10-week classes
which are modeled on the Stan
ford class," she said. "1 like how
well-balanced it is and the fact
that it develops self-confidence
and assertiveness."
The SWOPSI class has been
offered at Stanford since 1977,
but was originally taught by a
company from Redwood City.
Originally students were re
quired to undergo simulated at
tacks to test the skills they had
been taught. "The company pro
vided a person dressed up in a
padded suit which allowed the
women to go all out in practicing
physical techniques," MacKaye
said.
Stanford women and the com
pany parted in 1985 due to differ
ences in the philosophy of how
the course should be taught. At
tack simulations have since been
eliminated as part of the normal
format.
"There were also some in
stances of behavior that was in
appropriate in a self-defense
class," MacKaye said, declining
to elaborate.
The Women Defending Our
selves collective was then
formed to take over class instruc
tion and to decide the format and
material to be used in the course.
"As a group we make all our
decisions by consensus, and
there is no one person in
charge," Lambie said.
"When we put together a
class, we re the ones who decide
who's going to teach and what
organizational changes need to
be made," she added.
In order to do this success
fully, the group has kept the size
of the collective down to a
manageable 13 members, accord
ing to Lambie.
However, they now plan on in

creasing the number of women in
the collective and restructuring it
in order to meet the demand for
more classes.
This quarter the class meets
Monday and Tuesday nights for
three hours each.
The three-unit course calls for
a large time commitment and
utilizes a "self-selection proc
ess" in determining which stu
dents will be allowed into the
class.
At the first meeting potential
participants are told about the
amount of reading in the class as
well as the papers required.
The women who then want to
enroll in the class evaluate them
selves and decide whether they
can make the total commitment
necessary.
"We like this method, because
it gets people into the class who
really want to take (the rigorous
requirements] and can emotion
ally handle it," Lambie said.
Although many people are
weeded out through self
selection, a lottery is held if there
are still too many women who
want to take the course.
Spring has always been the
most popular quarter to take the
class, but due to the lack of
teachers and facilities, enroll
ment is competitive.
"1 think the most valuable
thing the women come away with
is a sense of themselves," said
Darby Hoover, one of the class
instructors and a recent Stanford
graduate. She added that "the
way this manifests itself is
through assertiveness.'
"Just looking people in the eye
and not always smiling, not al
ways being vulnerable, is great,
Brookshire said.
"I think every woman at Stan
ford should take this class,"
Francetic said.
