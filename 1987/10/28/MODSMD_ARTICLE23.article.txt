# Card and Bears square off in Big Game blood wars
## 
### Gaby Banks 
Big Game isn't just a game
anymore. This year Stanford and
UC-Berkeley are at war, and
more than reputations are at
stake.
Stanford loyalists are recruit
ing the hundreds of healthy
bodies needed to defend the Car
dinal. Authorities from both in
stitutions predict there will be
significant bloodshed.
Starting this quarter, the Stan
ford Blood Center is competing
with the Alameda-Contra Costa
Blood Bank in Berkeley, to see
which student body can donate
more blood.
In mid-September, Califor
nians, a campus service organi
zation at Berkeley, contacted the
Stanford Blood Center and chal
lenged its rivals to a pre-Big
Game bleedoff.
In response, Stanford will take
blood from a series of 24 blood
drives at 20 different sites
throughout campus this fall quar
ter, in a campaign the Cardinal is
calling "Red is the Color of Life,
Give Life: Give Blood."
Berkeley's attempt to outbleed
Stanford is a one-shot deal.
While it is unable to hold a

succession of drives, Berkeley
plans instead to "Get the Red
Out," as the Bears are calling
their drive, during only one day
of blood collection.
On Nov. 19, with two days
remaining before Big Game,
Jeannie McKevitt, blood drive
chairman for the Bears, will call
the Stanford Blood Center to get
a report on how much blood
Stanford has collected. Cal sup
porters will spend the entire day
trying to match Stanford's num
ber of donated units. At halftime
of Saturday's game, the winner
of the first bleedoff will be an
nounced.
Stanford, however, already
has a big jump in the "blood
game." In the eight drives that
nave taken place since the start
of the quarter, the Stanford
Blood Center has accumulated
224 units (450-500 cc's, or pints)
of blood. Doreen Leith, Blood
Donor Coordinator, said she ex
pects to collect approximately
710 more units during the remain
ing blood drives.
Berkeley, on the other hand,
has a lot of bleeding to do. When
McKevitt asked Leith to assess
Stanford's probable intake, her
rival coordinator estimated that

Stanford would collect 800 units.
McKevitt reportedly mumbled
in response, "Oh we (Berkeley)
don't collect nearly as much as
that."
Leith said she is wary that the
Bears could be pulling the old
Trojan Bear trick — hiding their
ambush — and come Nov. 19
they'll bleed themselves dry.
Whether or not Berkeley is
bluffing, Stanford's strategy at
this point is to keep the blood
flowing. Branner's recent blood
drive gave credibility to the
Blood Center's game plan.
Last Thursday, 27 percent of
Branner's residents arrived,
eager to pull up their sleeves and
give. After four hours of collec
tion, Stanford Blood Drive
nurses had transfused 39 units of
Branner blood. "It was kind of
hard getting people to donate,"
said Kimberly Loffer, Branner
Blood Drive coordinator.
While some students fear the
ominous needle, those who gave
bled fearlessly. Felicia Ota, one
of the 24 first-time donors at
Branner, said, "I would
definitely do it again. It was a
piece of cake, and it really made
you feel good."
Shen Nagel said his arm

"wasn't even sore" after giving
blood.
Donner donors expressed
similar sentiments about their
blood drive Monday. Dana Til
son said she felt that "people
should donate and stop being
scared about it. It wasn't too big
of a deal."
"I'd never given blood in high
school," Heather Butler said. "1
kind of felt guilty, so I decided to
try it this time, and it was fine."
Pam Smul, the Blood Drive co
ordinator at Donner, said she
tried to downplay Cal's challenge
to Stanford. "It made people
queasy to think about the idea of
competing for blood," she said.
Indeed, there are more reasons
for giving blood than to drip the
Bears dry; Big Game status is
crucial, but it isn't a case of life
or death. For many people,
however, having blood at the
right time often is.
Blood collected from the Stan
ford drives supplies the Stanford
Hospital with about 20 percent of
the 22,000 units used there an
nually. Everyone from hemophil
iacs to unhealthy newborns to
patients undergoing open-heart
surgery will use the blood collec
ted at Stanford.

While Cardinal tans have little
fear of their rivals across the
Bay, what they may fear is trans
fusion. Common excuses for not
giving blood are often based on
misinformation, according to

Blood Center literature.
Yesterday marked the halfway
point of the Stanford Bleedoff
campaign. The next drives will
be held at Governor's Corner
today and tomorrow.

stitutions predict there will be
significant bloodshed.
Starting this quarter, the Stan
ford Blood Center is competing
with the Alameda-Contra Costa
Blood Bank in Berkeley, to see
which student body can donate
more blood.
In mid-September, Califor
nians, a campus service organi
zation at Berkeley, contacted the
Stanford Blood Center and chal
lenged its rivals to a pre-Big
Game bleedoff.
In response, Stanford will take
blood from a series of 24 blood
drives at 20 different sites
throughout campus this fall quar
ter, in a campaign the Cardinal is
calling "Red is the Color of Life,
Give Life: Give Blood."
Berkeley's attempt to outbleed
Stanford is a one-shot deal.
While it is unable to hold a

succession of drives, Berkeley
plans instead to "Get the Red
Out," as the Bears are calling
their drive, during only one day
of blood collection.
On Nov. 19, with two days
remaining before Big Game,
Jeannie McKevitt, blood drive
chairman for the Bears, will call
the Stanford Blood Center to get
a report on how much blood
Stanford has collected. Cal sup
porters will spend the entire day
trying to match Stanford's num
ber of donated units. At halftime
of Saturday's game, the winner
of the first bleedoff will be an
nounced.
Stanford, however, already
has a big jump in the "blood
game." In the eight drives that
nave taken place since the start
of the quarter, the Stanford
Blood Center has accumulated
224 units (450-500 cc's, or pints)
of blood. Doreen Leith, Blood
Donor Coordinator, said she ex
pects to collect approximately
710 more units during the remain
ing blood drives.
Berkeley, on the other hand,
has a lot of bleeding to do. When
McKevitt asked Leith to assess
Stanford's probable intake, her
rival coordinator estimated that

Stanford would collect 800 units.
McKevitt reportedly mumbled
in response, "Oh we (Berkeley)
don't collect nearly as much as
that."
Leith said she is wary that the
Bears could be pulling the old
Trojan Bear trick — hiding their
ambush — and come Nov. 19
they'll bleed themselves dry.
Whether or not Berkeley is
bluffing, Stanford's strategy at
this point is to keep the blood
flowing. Branner's recent blood
drive gave credibility to the
Blood Center's game plan.
Last Thursday, 27 percent of
Branner's residents arrived,
eager to pull up their sleeves and
give. After four hours of collec
tion, Stanford Blood Drive
nurses had transfused 39 units of
Branner blood. "It was kind of
hard getting people to donate,"
said Kimberly Loffer, Branner
Blood Drive coordinator.
While some students fear the
ominous needle, those who gave
bled fearlessly. Felicia Ota, one
of the 24 first-time donors at
Branner, said, "I would
definitely do it again. It was a
piece of cake, and it really made
you feel good."
Shen Nagel said his arm

"wasn't even sore" after giving
blood.
Donner donors expressed
similar sentiments about their
blood drive Monday. Dana Til
son said she felt that "people
should donate and stop being
scared about it. It wasn't too big
of a deal."
"I'd never given blood in high
school," Heather Butler said. "1
kind of felt guilty, so I decided to
try it this time, and it was fine."
Pam Smul, the Blood Drive co
ordinator at Donner, said she
tried to downplay Cal's challenge
to Stanford. "It made people
queasy to think about the idea of
competing for blood," she said.
Indeed, there are more reasons
for giving blood than to drip the
Bears dry; Big Game status is
crucial, but it isn't a case of life
or death. For many people,
however, having blood at the
right time often is.
Blood collected from the Stan
ford drives supplies the Stanford
Hospital with about 20 percent of
the 22,000 units used there an
nually. Everyone from hemophil
iacs to unhealthy newborns to
patients undergoing open-heart
surgery will use the blood collec
ted at Stanford.

While Cardinal tans have little
fear of their rivals across the
Bay, what they may fear is trans
fusion. Common excuses for not
giving blood are often based on
misinformation, according to

Blood Center literature.
Yesterday marked the halfway
point of the Stanford Bleedoff
campaign. The next drives will
be held at Governor's Corner
today and tomorrow.

Big Game isn't just a game
