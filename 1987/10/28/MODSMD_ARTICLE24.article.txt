## Cimino releases worst film yet 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
In my review of "Fatal Attraction," I
criticized the directors for compromising
their artistic integrity by pandering to the
popular, commercial tastes of the moviegoing
public in order to ensure the success of their
film. With Michael Cimino and the "Sicilian"
we have the case of a man who won't com
promise his artistic integrity for anything, and
maybe he should.
The Sicilian is Cimino's worst film to
date and one of the worst films of the year.
Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same
name, "The Sicilian started out with a
Steve Shagan screenplay that Puzo himself
liked. Cimino, however, didn't think the
script matched his artistic vision, so he
turned it over to Gore Vidal for rewriting.
After that, Cimino, still not completely
satisfied, simply re-wrote it himself. The re
sulting film is not only a jumbled mess like his
previous movies, but also a jumbled boring
mess.
I never saw "Heaven s Gate," which was
probably about as terrible as everyone said it
was, but I did see "The Deer Hunter" and
"Year of the Dragon," and I actually thought
both films were superficially terrific. Al

though flawed by its excesses, "The Deer
Hunter" was a riveting film. "Year of the
Dragon," which most critics panned, was
also flawed by its excesses, as well as by a
lame script and another insufferable Mickey
Rourke performance; but at least it kept me
entertained.
With "The Sicilian," Cimino has commit
ted the mortal sin — he has bored us.
It is said that Cipiino has a grand scheme in
his head about how all his movies should be
made. For "The Sicilian," he reportedly
locked himself in a room where he played
operas all day in order to inspire the mood of
the film.
All this would have been inspiring in itself
if "The Sicilian" were a great film, but it
isn't. It's also not appropriate to refer to
Cimino, as some critics have, as a "flawed
genius."
In my view, it's probably more accurate to
label him as a "pretentious incompetent." In
other words, he sets out to make a great film,
but he doesn't have a clue as to what goes
into one.
In a nutshell, the film is based on the true
story of Salvatore Giuliano, the Robin Hood
like bandit who took on the church, the state
and the mafia in his quest to get Sicily to
secede from Italy.

Cimino takes Giuliano and attempts to
romanticize him into a mythic hero of epic
proportions, but the script lacks the fire and
passion necessary to sweep you into the
story. Also lacking in fire and passion is
Christopher Lambert ("Greystoke," "Sub
way "), who delivers a laughable performance
afc Giuliano.
Lambert seems to be trying hard to portray
a larger than life character by staring into the
camera, but he doesn't have enough experi
ence or stature as an actor to make it all
work. Lambert, however, isn't the only one
to blame. The rest of the cast is hardly
memorable, and those who do make an im
pression come across as annoying and un
pleasant.
Overall, it appears as if Cimino is trying to
make a self-styled "Godfather" epic, but he
flops miserably.
The impending critical and box office fail
ure of "The Sicilian" should cement
Cimino's reputation as a director who has too
much freedom and too little humility about
his "cinematic vision." This is unfortunate
because it will give a bad name to other direc
tors who have as much conviction as Cimino,
but who know what they are doing.
One thing's for sure: It'll be a long time
before Cimino makes another movie.

With "The Sicilian," Cimino has commit
ted the mortal sin — he has bored us.
It is said that Cipiino has a grand scheme in
his head about how all his movies should be
made. For "The Sicilian," he reportedly
locked himself in a room where he played
operas all day in order to inspire the mood of
the film.
All this would have been inspiring in itself
if "The Sicilian" were a great film, but it
isn't. It's also not appropriate to refer to
Cimino, as some critics have, as a "flawed
genius."
In my view, it's probably more accurate to
label him as a "pretentious incompetent." In
other words, he sets out to make a great film,
but he doesn't have a clue as to what goes
into one.
In a nutshell, the film is based on the true
story of Salvatore Giuliano, the Robin Hood
like bandit who took on the church, the state
and the mafia in his quest to get Sicily to
secede from Italy.

Cimino takes Giuliano and attempts to
romanticize him into a mythic hero of epic
proportions, but the script lacks the fire and
passion necessary to sweep you into the
story. Also lacking in fire and passion is
Christopher Lambert ("Greystoke," "Sub
way "), who delivers a laughable performance
afc Giuliano.
Lambert seems to be trying hard to portray
a larger than life character by staring into the
camera, but he doesn't have enough experi
ence or stature as an actor to make it all
work. Lambert, however, isn't the only one
to blame. The rest of the cast is hardly
memorable, and those who do make an im
pression come across as annoying and un
pleasant.
Overall, it appears as if Cimino is trying to
make a self-styled "Godfather" epic, but he
flops miserably.
The impending critical and box office fail
ure of "The Sicilian" should cement
Cimino's reputation as a director who has too
much freedom and too little humility about
his "cinematic vision." This is unfortunate
because it will give a bad name to other direc
tors who have as much conviction as Cimino,
but who know what they are doing.
One thing's for sure: It'll be a long time
before Cimino makes another movie.
