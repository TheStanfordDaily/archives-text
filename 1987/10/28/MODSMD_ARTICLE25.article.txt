# Cast makes a dreary 'Drood'
## 
### Marc Borsak 
Theatreworks proves, in its
production of "The Mystery of
Edwin Drood," that, contrary to
one of the show's song titles,
some good can come from had.
This is exemplified in an ener
getically crude performance by
Sara Noah Ruddy as the opium
queen Princess Puffer, in the
geographically unplaceable ac
cent of Simone Cox in the role of
the mysterious Helena Landless
and in an energetic chorus of
characters that show the audi
ence a great time before the show
and during the intermission as
they meander through the theater
chatting with the audience and
each other.
"Drood" is based on an un
finished novel by Charles Dick
ens, and the adaptation has been
done by Rupert Holmes, who is
responsible for the music, lyrics
and orchestrations. He won
Tony awards for all of the above.
The show's major claim to
fame is that the audience gets to
vote on several key plot points to

determine how the play will end
each night. The cast will perform
the ending the audience selects.
In order to do this. Holmes has
constructed a "show within a
show. What we actually see is
7he Music Hall Royale's per
formance of "The Mystery of
Edwin Drood," such that each
actor portrays an actor playing a
role.
The Theatreworks production,
though respectable for a commu
nity theater effort, lacks the
spark necessary to ignite a show
such as this.
A large part of the show's suc
cess depends upon the role of the
Chairman, who functions as the
narrator of the piece. On Broad
way, the role was played by
George Rose (who also won a
I'ony), who was wonderfully in
tune with the audience; he made
sure they were having a good
time, often ad-libbing, but always
playing on the audience s chem
istry. One doesn't expect anyone
to compare with George Rose,
but Keith Bentley's performance

here simply falls flat. He has little
personality, does not project,
flubs quite a few of his lines
(could it have been intentional?)
and delivers the jokes a bit too
dryly.
The other central character,
that of Drood (originally played
by Betty Buckley on Broadway
— I'm still not sure why it was
written for a woman), is por
trayed here by Lynn O'Donahoe
in another characterless perform
ance. Certainly one might expect
the title character to leave some
sort of an impression, but she is
actually better in the brief time
when we see her as the actress
who is portraying Drood than as
Drood himself.
Kevin Simmons and Diana
Torres both have satisfactory
voices in their respective roles as
the evil Reverend John Jasper
and the innocent Rosa Bud. The
choral singing is fine, too. The
major musical problem lies with
the small orchestra. It is placed
in a newly built balcony to the
left of the stage, making it diffi

cult for the conductor to commu
nicate with the players. The or
chestra was also somewhat
sloppy in this particular show,
and the songs often ended with a
whimper when they should have
ended with a bang.
The sets are nice, except for
the backdrop of the town of
Cloisterham — the panels don't
really match. The lighting is ade
quate, except for a couple of
times when the cast is left
downstage dancing in the dark.
Director Robert Kelley's style
is rather pedestrian, and the play
never really picks up the momen
tum it needs to become the fun
fest it sets out to be. The order of
the musical numbers has been
changed from the Broadway pro
duction, and some additional
numbers have been added, but
the most fun here is still to be had
before the curtain and during in
termission.
"The Mystery of Edwin
Drood" will be playing at the
Burgess Theater in Menlo Park
through Nov. 21.

and the innocent Rosa Bud. The
choral singing is fine, too. The
major musical problem lies with
the small orchestra. It is placed
in a newly built balcony to the
left of the stage, making it diffi

cult for the conductor to commu
nicate with the players. The or
chestra was also somewhat
sloppy in this particular show,
and the songs often ended with a
whimper when they should have
ended with a bang.
The sets are nice, except for
the backdrop of the town of
Cloisterham — the panels don't
really match. The lighting is ade
quate, except for a couple of
times when the cast is left
downstage dancing in the dark.
Director Robert Kelley's style
is rather pedestrian, and the play
never really picks up the momen
tum it needs to become the fun
fest it sets out to be. The order of
the musical numbers has been
changed from the Broadway pro
duction, and some additional
numbers have been added, but
the most fun here is still to be had
before the curtain and during in
termission.

Theatreworks proves, in its
production of "The Mystery of
Edwin Drood," that, contrary to
one of the show's song titles,
some good can come from had.
This is exemplified in an ener
getically crude performance by
Sara Noah Ruddy as the opium
queen Princess Puffer, in the
geographically unplaceable ac
cent of Simone Cox in the role of
the mysterious Helena Landless
and in an energetic chorus of
characters that show the audi
ence a great time before the show
and during the intermission as
they meander through the theater
chatting with the audience and
each other.
"Drood" is based on an un
finished novel by Charles Dick
ens, and the adaptation has been
done by Rupert Holmes, who is
responsible for the music, lyrics
and orchestrations. He won
Tony awards for all of the above.
The show's major claim to
fame is that the audience gets to
vote on several key plot points to

determine how the play will end
each night. The cast will perform
the ending the audience selects.
In order to do this. Holmes has
constructed a "show within a
show. What we actually see is
7he Music Hall Royale's per
formance of "The Mystery of
Edwin Drood," such that each
actor portrays an actor playing a
role.
The Theatreworks production,
though respectable for a commu
nity theater effort, lacks the
spark necessary to ignite a show
such as this.
A large part of the show's suc
cess depends upon the role of the
Chairman, who functions as the
narrator of the piece. On Broad
way, the role was played by
George Rose (who also won a
I'ony), who was wonderfully in
tune with the audience; he made
sure they were having a good
time, often ad-libbing, but always
playing on the audience s chem
istry. One doesn't expect anyone
to compare with George Rose,
but Keith Bentley's performance

here simply falls flat. He has little
personality, does not project,
flubs quite a few of his lines
(could it have been intentional?)
and delivers the jokes a bit too
dryly.
The other central character,
that of Drood (originally played
by Betty Buckley on Broadway
— I'm still not sure why it was
written for a woman), is por
trayed here by Lynn O'Donahoe
in another characterless perform
ance. Certainly one might expect
the title character to leave some
sort of an impression, but she is
actually better in the brief time
when we see her as the actress
who is portraying Drood than as
Drood himself.
Kevin Simmons and Diana
Torres both have satisfactory
voices in their respective roles as
the evil Reverend John Jasper
and the innocent Rosa Bud. The
choral singing is fine, too. The
major musical problem lies with
the small orchestra. It is placed
in a newly built balcony to the
left of the stage, making it diffi

cult for the conductor to commu
