Omigod! Just when you
thought it was safe to read The
Daily again, it's back! Yes, that's
right, folks, it's the triumphant
return of KZSU Picks, surely one
of the most popular Daily

albums have been reviewed by
professionals, so please don't at
tempt this at home.
Depeche Mode — " Music for the
Masses"
As always, the Modies are on
the cutting edge of the synth pop
trend. Through the years,
Depeche Mode has managed to
master the use of its medium, ex
panding to the extensive use of
samplers and a more sophisti
cated sound, as is demonstrated
in the dramatic, fake orchestral
chorus, "PIMPFF."
Indeed, in"I Want You
Now," the sampled soundscapes
of lustful breathing, classical in
struments, distorted vocal tones
and radio interference contrived
by Andrew Fletcher, Martin
Gore and Alan Wilder provide an
unusually eloquent complement
to the emotion-tinged vocals of
Dave Gahan: "I've got a love/ A
love that won't wait/ A love that
is growing/ And it's getting late/
Do you know what it means/ To
be left this way/ When every
one's gone/ And the feelings they
stay/1 want you now . . .
The lyrical themes throughout
the piece are angst-ridden and
lovelorn. Although the lyrics
may sound soggy, the overall
performance, with its full instru
mentation, is credible. The sub
ject matter, consisting of such
diverse topics as love, sex, sado
masochism, religion, youth,
friendship, drugs, betrayal and
emotional emptiness, is handled

creatively and tastefully.
My main problem with the al
bum is musical. The featured
tracks, although progressive in
the sense that they break new
ground textually, lack any real
tempo or tone variation. But
overall, it's well worth the price
of admission for the progressive
minded listener. Nonetheless, be
warned:
• 1. You may find yourself think
ing "wimp" as Dave Gahan
whines about "Little 15" and
"Three Little Wishes."
• 2. There are no songs about
shaking parts of your body
shamelessly.
• 3. There are no "raunchy" or
"rad" guitar solos.

R.E.M. —"Document"
Close your eyes. Got 'em
closed? OK, good. Now try to
imagine the sound Bob Dylan
would make in the middle of a te
quila binge with his fingers
plugged into a light socket. Pretty
twisted, huh? That's as close as 1
can come to actually describing
Michael Stipe's too-perfect
voice.
If you have never heard
R.E.M. before, this is the album
to go out and deflower yourself
on. Believe it or not, you can ac
tually understand what Stipe is
saying on every single song. He
even has some good things to
say, too. "It's the End of the
World As We Know It (And I
Feel Fine)" is one of the most
downright groovy songs of the
year. Stipe's stream-of-con
sciousness vocal is nothing short
of amazing. He spouts sarcastic
cliches faster than Geraldo
Rivera zonked out on speed.
Musically, R.E.M. sounds
kind of like Husker Du getting to

gether with Jimi Hendrix in the
afterworld and playing covers of
old Byrds tunes. Peter Buck's
scraping feedback guitar is per
fect for their wall-of-sound feel.
This is angry folk music for angry
people — kind of like punk music
for rednecks.
A warning, though. Don't buy
this album on CD — you'll want
the fuzz a cheaply copied tape
provides. For best results, bor
row your friend's tape and leave
it on your dashboard for awhile.
Then, high speed dub it and listen
to it on the Fisher-Price walkman
that you got at K-Mart for $6.99.
You'll be glad you did.

The Silencers — " A Letter From
St. Paul"
1 am tryng to pin down exactly
what it is that annoys me about
this album. Perhaps it's the fact
that the Silencers come off
sounding a bit like watered down
U2, using the mask of Christian
inspired lyrics to disguise their
musical deficiencies.

To their credit, these fellows
have certainly done their U2
homework well. The self
important black and white
photographs are all here, includ
ing the ones with no one looking
at the camera (as if they are not
aware of their picture being
taken. Right.), as is the place
ment of an acoustic guitar in live
of the seven photos, although I
can't hear it in any of the nine
songs. But, hey, pasty-faced lead
singers who can't dance need
something to do during the syn
thesizer solos.
The entire album is a relatively
painless experience, largely be
cause it relies on the same for
mula over and over again. It's a
lot like reading the Bible on
Valium. Each song has a nice
mid-tempo beat, wrapped in
nocuously with a sugar-coated
synth-based melody, over which
the Silencers proceed to ser
monize innocently in their own
brand of wonderfully alluring
poesy: "The Devil's called by a
thousand names/ He's the Lord
of Lies and He's not ashamed.'"

Oh, revelation. These guys could
sing "Beelzebub is suctioning my
thigh fat" and make it sound like
the Priests of Polka doing "The
Lord is My Shepherd."
The album is not entirely with
out its moments, however. In the
radio singles "Painted Moon"
and "1 See Red," the Biblical
overtones are submerged enough
by the poetic ambiguities so that
you can actually enjoy the
genuinely infectious melodies.
This turns out to be a short-lived
high, however, because these
two songs are followed by the
tedium of Jimmie O'Neill
whining "Swing down chariot
and let me ride, cause I'm bound
for higher ground." We certainly
hope so, Jimmie. Take a break
until you get there.

The Smiths —"Strangeways Here
We Come"
Those British pop sensations,
The Smiths, have just released
their last, and arguably best, al
bum. Although in the process of
parting ways while recording the
album, Steven Morrissey,
Johnny Marr, Andy Rourke and
Mike Joyce have managed to
produce an entertaining final hur
rah. The 10 tracks featured on
the album are musically taut and
extraordinarily provocative.
Lyrically, the work is melan
cholic yet whimsically reflective.
In "Paint A Vulgar Picture,"
Morrissey wryly comments, "At
the record company party/ On
their hands — a dead star/ The
syncophantic slags all say:/ 'I
knew him first and I knew him
well'/ Re-issue! Re-package! Re
package!/ Re-evaluate the songs/
Double-pack with a photograph/
Extra track (and a tacky
badge). ..."

Musically, Marr's unique
guitar and piano styles compli
ment Morrissey's poetic lyrics
with incredible pop sensibility. In
"I Won't Share You," he strums
up a light, fluffy acoustic melody
that contrasts well with Morris
sey's determined message to his
beloved. In "Stop Me If You
Think You've Heard This
Before" Marr whips up bril
liantly layered and executed
electric guitar rhythms as Morris
sey bathes in overblown self
mockery. "A Rush and A Push
and The Land Is Ours" show
cases Marr's ability to create
quirky piano arrangements with
out guitar, as well as Morrissey's
morbid yet humorously pre
sented obsessions with suicide.
The interplay of the Morrissey/
Marr collaboration with Rour
ke's solid bass guitar and Joyce's
creative percussion round out the
package perfectly. Rourke's
work transcends the traditional
use of the bass guitar; his style is
neither "funky" nor overbear
ing. Joyce uses various modes of
percussion, ranging from tam
borines to jazz snares, to effec
tively accent the musical combi
nation.
Surely, established fans of The
Smiths won't be disappointed,
while those who have never
heard so much as one song by the
group will find this album a good
run for the money. However,
those of you unfamiliar with the
band, be warned:
• 1. Morrissey does not "sing"
in the traditional sense; he is
more of a modern bard.
• 2. Morrissey complains a lot
about being celibate.
• 3. There are no "raunchy" or
"rad" guitar solos.

taken. Right.), as is the place
ment of an acoustic guitar in live
of the seven photos, although I
can't hear it in any of the nine
songs. But, hey, pasty-faced lead
singers who can't dance need
something to do during the syn
thesizer solos.
The entire album is a relatively
painless experience, largely be
cause it relies on the same for
mula over and over again. It's a
lot like reading the Bible on
Valium. Each song has a nice
mid-tempo beat, wrapped in
nocuously with a sugar-coated
synth-based melody, over which
the Silencers proceed to ser
monize innocently in their own
brand of wonderfully alluring
poesy: "The Devil's called by a
thousand names/ He's the Lord
of Lies and He's not ashamed.'"

Oh, revelation. These guys could
sing "Beelzebub is suctioning my
thigh fat" and make it sound like
the Priests of Polka doing "The
Lord is My Shepherd."
The album is not entirely with
out its moments, however. In the
radio singles "Painted Moon"
and "1 See Red," the Biblical
overtones are submerged enough
by the poetic ambiguities so that
you can actually enjoy the
genuinely infectious melodies.
This turns out to be a short-lived
high, however, because these
two songs are followed by the
tedium of Jimmie O'Neill
whining "Swing down chariot
and let me ride, cause I'm bound
for higher ground." We certainly
hope so, Jimmie. Take a break
until you get there.

The Smiths —"Strangeways Here
We Come"
Those British pop sensations,
The Smiths, have just released
their last, and arguably best, al
bum. Although in the process of
parting ways while recording the
album, Steven Morrissey,
Johnny Marr, Andy Rourke and
Mike Joyce have managed to
produce an entertaining final hur
rah. The 10 tracks featured on
the album are musically taut and
extraordinarily provocative.
Lyrically, the work is melan
cholic yet whimsically reflective.
In "Paint A Vulgar Picture,"
Morrissey wryly comments, "At
the record company party/ On
their hands — a dead star/ The
syncophantic slags all say:/ 'I
knew him first and I knew him
well'/ Re-issue! Re-package! Re
package!/ Re-evaluate the songs/
Double-pack with a photograph/
Extra track (and a tacky
badge). ..."

Musically, Marr's unique
guitar and piano styles compli
ment Morrissey's poetic lyrics
with incredible pop sensibility. In
"I Won't Share You," he strums
up a light, fluffy acoustic melody
that contrasts well with Morris
sey's determined message to his
beloved. In "Stop Me If You
Think You've Heard This
Before" Marr whips up bril
liantly layered and executed
electric guitar rhythms as Morris
sey bathes in overblown self
mockery. "A Rush and A Push
and The Land Is Ours" show
cases Marr's ability to create
quirky piano arrangements with
out guitar, as well as Morrissey's
morbid yet humorously pre
sented obsessions with suicide.
The interplay of the Morrissey/
Marr collaboration with Rour
ke's solid bass guitar and Joyce's
creative percussion round out the
package perfectly. Rourke's
work transcends the traditional
use of the bass guitar; his style is
neither "funky" nor overbear
ing. Joyce uses various modes of
percussion, ranging from tam
borines to jazz snares, to effec
tively accent the musical combi
nation.
Surely, established fans of The
Smiths won't be disappointed,
while those who have never
heard so much as one song by the
group will find this album a good
run for the money. However,
those of you unfamiliar with the
band, be warned:
• 1. Morrissey does not "sing"
in the traditional sense; he is
more of a modern bard.
• 2. Morrissey complains a lot
about being celibate.
• 3. There are no "raunchy" or
"rad" guitar solos.

Depeche Mode — " Music for the
Masses"
As always, the Modies are on
the cutting edge of the synth pop
trend. Through the years,
Depeche Mode has managed to
master the use of its medium, ex
panding to the extensive use of
samplers and a more sophisti
cated sound, as is demonstrated
in the dramatic, fake orchestral
chorus, "PIMPFF."
Indeed, in"I Want You
Now," the sampled soundscapes
of lustful breathing, classical in
struments, distorted vocal tones
and radio interference contrived
by Andrew Fletcher, Martin
Gore and Alan Wilder provide an
unusually eloquent complement
to the emotion-tinged vocals of
Dave Gahan: "I've got a love/ A
love that won't wait/ A love that
is growing/ And it's getting late/
Do you know what it means/ To
be left this way/ When every
one's gone/ And the feelings they
stay/1 want you now . . .
The lyrical themes throughout
the piece are angst-ridden and
lovelorn. Although the lyrics
may sound soggy, the overall
performance, with its full instru
mentation, is credible. The sub
ject matter, consisting of such
diverse topics as love, sex, sado
masochism, religion, youth,
friendship, drugs, betrayal and
emotional emptiness, is handled

creatively and tastefully.
My main problem with the al
bum is musical. The featured
tracks, although progressive in
the sense that they break new
ground textually, lack any real
tempo or tone variation. But
overall, it's well worth the price
of admission for the progressive
minded listener. Nonetheless, be
warned:
• 1. You may find yourself think
ing "wimp" as Dave Gahan
whines about "Little 15" and
"Three Little Wishes."
• 2. There are no songs about
shaking parts of your body
shamelessly.
• 3. There are no "raunchy" or
"rad" guitar solos.

R.E.M. —"Document"
Close your eyes. Got 'em
closed? OK, good. Now try to
imagine the sound Bob Dylan
would make in the middle of a te
quila binge with his fingers
plugged into a light socket. Pretty
twisted, huh? That's as close as 1
can come to actually describing
Michael Stipe's too-perfect
voice.
If you have never heard
R.E.M. before, this is the album
to go out and deflower yourself
on. Believe it or not, you can ac
tually understand what Stipe is
saying on every single song. He
even has some good things to
say, too. "It's the End of the
World As We Know It (And I
Feel Fine)" is one of the most
downright groovy songs of the
year. Stipe's stream-of-con
sciousness vocal is nothing short
of amazing. He spouts sarcastic
cliches faster than Geraldo
Rivera zonked out on speed.
Musically, R.E.M. sounds
kind of like Husker Du getting to

gether with Jimi Hendrix in the
afterworld and playing covers of
old Byrds tunes. Peter Buck's
scraping feedback guitar is per
fect for their wall-of-sound feel.
This is angry folk music for angry
people — kind of like punk music
for rednecks.
A warning, though. Don't buy
this album on CD — you'll want
the fuzz a cheaply copied tape
provides. For best results, bor
row your friend's tape and leave
it on your dashboard for awhile.
Then, high speed dub it and listen
to it on the Fisher-Price walkman
that you got at K-Mart for $6.99.
You'll be glad you did.

The Silencers — " A Letter From

1 am tryng to pin down exactly
what it is that annoys me about
this album. Perhaps it's the fact
that the Silencers come off
sounding a bit like watered down
U2, using the mask of Christian
inspired lyrics to disguise their
musical deficiencies.

To their credit, these fellows
have certainly done their U2
homework well. The self
important black and white
photographs are all here, includ
ing the ones with no one looking
at the camera (as if they are not
aware of their picture being
taken. Right.), as is the place

of the seven photos, although I
can't hear it in any of the nine
songs. But, hey, pasty-faced lead

something to do during the syn

The entire album is a relatively

samplers and a more sophisti
cated sound, as is demonstrated
in the dramatic, fake orchestral
chorus, "PIMPFF."
Indeed, in"I Want You
Now," the sampled soundscapes
of lustful breathing, classical in
struments, distorted vocal tones
and radio interference contrived
by Andrew Fletcher, Martin
Gore and Alan Wilder provide an
unusually eloquent complement
to the emotion-tinged vocals of
Dave Gahan: "I've got a love/ A
love that won't wait/ A love that
is growing/ And it's getting late/
Do you know what it means/ To
be left this way/ When every
one's gone/ And the feelings they
stay/1 want you now . . .
The lyrical themes throughout
the piece are angst-ridden and
lovelorn. Although the lyrics
may sound soggy, the overall
performance, with its full instru
mentation, is credible. The sub
ject matter, consisting of such
diverse topics as love, sex, sado
masochism, religion, youth,
friendship, drugs, betrayal and
emotional emptiness, is handled

creatively and tastefully.
My main problem with the al
bum is musical. The featured
tracks, although progressive in
the sense that they break new
ground textually, lack any real
tempo or tone variation. But
overall, it's well worth the price
of admission for the progressive
minded listener. Nonetheless, be
warned:
• 1. You may find yourself think
ing "wimp" as Dave Gahan
whines about "Little 15" and
"Three Little Wishes."
• 2. There are no songs about
shaking parts of your body
shamelessly.
• 3. There are no "raunchy" or
"rad" guitar solos.

R.E.M. —"Document"
Close your eyes. Got 'em
closed? OK, good. Now try to
imagine the sound Bob Dylan
would make in the middle of a te
quila binge with his fingers
plugged into a light socket. Pretty
twisted, huh? That's as close as 1
can come to actually describing
Michael Stipe's too-perfect
voice.
If you have never heard
R.E.M. before, this is the album
to go out and deflower yourself
on. Believe it or not, you can ac
tually understand what Stipe is
saying on every single song. He
even has some good things to
say, too. "It's the End of the
World As We Know It (And I
Feel Fine)" is one of the most
downright groovy songs of the
year. Stipe's stream-of-con
sciousness vocal is nothing short
of amazing. He spouts sarcastic
cliches faster than Geraldo
Rivera zonked out on speed.
Musically, R.E.M. sounds
kind of like Husker Du getting to

gether with Jimi Hendrix in the
afterworld and playing covers of
old Byrds tunes. Peter Buck's
scraping feedback guitar is per
fect for their wall-of-sound feel.
This is angry folk music for angry
people — kind of like punk music
for rednecks.
A warning, though. Don't buy
this album on CD — you'll want
the fuzz a cheaply copied tape
provides. For best results, bor
row your friend's tape and leave
it on your dashboard for awhile.
Then, high speed dub it and listen
to it on the Fisher-Price walkman
that you got at K-Mart for $6.99.
You'll be glad you did.

The Silencers — " A Letter From
St. Paul"
1 am tryng to pin down exactly
what it is that annoys me about
this album. Perhaps it's the fact
that the Silencers come off
sounding a bit like watered down
U2, using the mask of Christian
inspired lyrics to disguise their
musical deficiencies.

To their credit, these fellows
have certainly done their U2
homework well. The self
important black and white
photographs are all here, includ
ing the ones with no one looking
at the camera (as if they are not
aware of their picture being
taken. Right.), as is the place
ment of an acoustic guitar in live
of the seven photos, although I
can't hear it in any of the nine
songs. But, hey, pasty-faced lead
singers who can't dance need
something to do during the syn
thesizer solos.
The entire album is a relatively
painless experience, largely be
cause it relies on the same for
mula over and over again. It's a
lot like reading the Bible on
Valium. Each song has a nice
mid-tempo beat, wrapped in
nocuously with a sugar-coated
synth-based melody, over which
the Silencers proceed to ser
monize innocently in their own
brand of wonderfully alluring
poesy: "The Devil's called by a
thousand names/ He's the Lord
of Lies and He's not ashamed.'"

Oh, revelation. These guys could
sing "Beelzebub is suctioning my
thigh fat" and make it sound like
the Priests of Polka doing "The
Lord is My Shepherd."
The album is not entirely with
out its moments, however. In the
radio singles "Painted Moon"
and "1 See Red," the Biblical
overtones are submerged enough
by the poetic ambiguities so that
you can actually enjoy the
genuinely infectious melodies.
This turns out to be a short-lived
high, however, because these
two songs are followed by the
tedium of Jimmie O'Neill
whining "Swing down chariot
and let me ride, cause I'm bound
for higher ground." We certainly
hope so, Jimmie. Take a break
until you get there.

The Smiths —"Strangeways Here
We Come"
Those British pop sensations,
The Smiths, have just released
their last, and arguably best, al
bum. Although in the process of
parting ways while recording the
album, Steven Morrissey,
Johnny Marr, Andy Rourke and
Mike Joyce have managed to
produce an entertaining final hur
rah. The 10 tracks featured on
the album are musically taut and
extraordinarily provocative.
Lyrically, the work is melan
cholic yet whimsically reflective.
In "Paint A Vulgar Picture,"
Morrissey wryly comments, "At
the record company party/ On
their hands — a dead star/ The
syncophantic slags all say:/ 'I
knew him first and I knew him
well'/ Re-issue! Re-package! Re
package!/ Re-evaluate the songs/
Double-pack with a photograph/
Extra track (and a tacky
badge). ..."

Musically, Marr's unique
guitar and piano styles compli
ment Morrissey's poetic lyrics
with incredible pop sensibility. In
"I Won't Share You," he strums
up a light, fluffy acoustic melody
that contrasts well with Morris
sey's determined message to his
beloved. In "Stop Me If You
Think You've Heard This
Before" Marr whips up bril
liantly layered and executed
electric guitar rhythms as Morris
sey bathes in overblown self
mockery. "A Rush and A Push
and The Land Is Ours" show
cases Marr's ability to create
quirky piano arrangements with
out guitar, as well as Morrissey's
morbid yet humorously pre
sented obsessions with suicide.
The interplay of the Morrissey/
Marr collaboration with Rour
ke's solid bass guitar and Joyce's
creative percussion round out the
package perfectly. Rourke's
work transcends the traditional
use of the bass guitar; his style is
neither "funky" nor overbear
ing. Joyce uses various modes of
percussion, ranging from tam
borines to jazz snares, to effec
tively accent the musical combi
nation.
Surely, established fans of The
Smiths won't be disappointed,
while those who have never
heard so much as one song by the
group will find this album a good
run for the money. However,
those of you unfamiliar with the
band, be warned:
• 1. Morrissey does not "sing"
in the traditional sense; he is
more of a modern bard.
• 2. Morrissey complains a lot
about being celibate.
• 3. There are no "raunchy" or
"rad" guitar solos.

Omigod! Just when you

Depeche Mode — " Music for the
Masses"
As always, the Modies are on
the cutting edge of the synth pop
trend. Through the years,
Depeche Mode has managed to
master the use of its medium, ex
panding to the extensive use of
samplers and a more sophisti
cated sound, as is demonstrated
in the dramatic, fake orchestral
chorus, "PIMPFF."
