# Rose Bowl hopes exist, just barely
## 
### 
A few short weeks ago,
prospects for writing this
column were slim.
The Stanford football team
was 0-4. Hopes for any kind of
postseason play looked slim.

Three wins later, there is
talk of the Cardinal finishing 7-
4 and going to a bowl game.
Even 6-5 might get Stanford a
bid, especially if Brad Muster
has a strong finish.
And let us not forget the
Rose Bowl.
OK, it's not too realistic a
possibility, but there's a slim
chance. A very slim chance.
UCLA seems to have
locked up a New Year's date
in its home stadium already, as
the Bruins are 6-1 overall â€”

and 4-0 in the Pac-10. But
Stanford lost four straight to
start off the season. Maybe
UCLA could end the season
the same way.
In fact, for the Cardinal to
make it to the Rose Bowl,
UCLA would have to lose
three of its remaining four
games. Stanford is 2-2 in the
Pac-10. Should the Bruins
only lose two conference
games and finish tied in the
league with the Cardinal, they
would still go to the Rose Bowl
by virtue of that little 49-0 win
at Stanford Stadium earlier
this month.
What is the likelihood of
UCLA losing three out of four
and Stanford winning all four
of its remaining games? Not
good. But it's not impossible.
Stanford's toughest chal
lenge will be USC at the L.A.
Coliseum. This game will be
especially crucial, as the
Trojans currently hold second
place in the Pac-10 standings
