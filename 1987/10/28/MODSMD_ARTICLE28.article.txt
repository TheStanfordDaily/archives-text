# Rose Bowl hopes exist, just barely
## 
### 
A few short weeks ago,
prospects for writing this
column were slim.
The Stanford football team
was 0-4. Hopes for any kind of
postseason play looked slim.

Three wins later, there is
talk of the Cardinal finishing 7-
4 and going to a bowl game.
Even 6-5 might get Stanford a
bid, especially if Brad Muster
has a strong finish.
And let us not forget the
Rose Bowl.
OK, it's not too realistic a
possibility, but there's a slim
chance. A very slim chance.
UCLA seems to have
locked up a New Year's date
in its home stadium already, as
the Bruins are 6-1 overall —

and 4-0 in the Pac-10. But
Stanford lost four straight to
start off the season. Maybe
UCLA could end the season
the same way.
In fact, for the Cardinal to
make it to the Rose Bowl,
UCLA would have to lose
three of its remaining four
games. Stanford is 2-2 in the
Pac-10. Should the Bruins
only lose two conference
games and finish tied in the
league with the Cardinal, they
would still go to the Rose Bowl
by virtue of that little 49-0 win
at Stanford Stadium earlier
this month.
What is the likelihood of
UCLA losing three out of four
and Stanford winning all four
of its remaining games? Not
good. But it's not impossible.
Stanford's toughest chal
lenge will be USC at the L.A.
Coliseum. This game will be
especially crucial, as the
Trojans currently hold second
place in the Pac-10 standings


Susan
Slusser
with a 3-1 conference record.
If Stanford beats USC and the
Trojans win the rest of their
games and finished tied with the
Cardinal, Stanford would get the
bid as a result of having defeated
USC.
USC is not a pushover, espe
cially at home. But the Trojans
did lose to Oregon, and the Car
dinal beat the Ducks. Thus, the
Cardinal should beat the Trojans.
Unfortunately, this kind of logic

rarely works in college football,
and IJSC has traditionally been a
Stanford nemesis.
Stanford also faces Arizona, a
team that tied Cal earlier this
year, and a team that the Cardi
nal has upset two years in a row.
The Cardinal meets Oregon at
Oregon State — but the Beavers
are 0-3 in the league. Big Game
is, as we all learned last year and
in 1982, never a given.
Nevertheless, Stanford is ca
pable of winning all four games.
UCLA losing three contests is
another matter.
Granted, the Bruins enter the
toughes}, part of their schedule.
They face Rose Bowl champ

Arizona State, Washington and
rival USC. Both ASU and USC
are away games. Tough match
ups, all. Oregon State, even at
Oregon State, should not pose
any problem for the mighty
Bruins, however.
Who knows? Maybe UCLA
will have the same kind of prob
lems Arizona has had and lose all
of its quarterbacks. Maybe
Bogart-struck Gaston Green will
quit football to follow his hero's
footsteps in Hollywood. Maybe
the Rams will hire Terry Don
ahue.
In other words, Stanford's
Rose Bowl hopes are very much
alive.
