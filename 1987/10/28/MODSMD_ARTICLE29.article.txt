Home must seem like a nice place to be
for the Stanford women's soccer team.
The 3-9-3 Cardinal will try to break out
of a three-game losing streak when it
takes on St. Mary's here this afternoon at
3 p.fh.
Stanford played the top-20-ranked
Gaels to a 0-0 tie in its first game of the
season. That tie and a loss to California
are the only blemishes on St. Mary's
record this year.
"They will be up to beat us," junior
forward Jenny Howick said. "We both
have something to prove."
The Cardinal's effort will be hampered
by several illnesses and injuries. Senior
forward Jennifer Hill is recovering from a
knee operation performed Monday.
Freshman fullback Val Goetz has a back
problem. Several others have been nur
sing colds. Senior midfielder Amy Geisse
practiced Monday and may play today.
Freshman Elise Edwards will take over
full time in goal, and her teammates say
they have complete confidence in her
ability.
"Elise can get shots that no other
goalie can make," Howick said.
"Everyone is used to Elise," junior
fullback Christy McDevitt said.
Stanford has gained a lot of cohesive
ness since its first meeting with St.
Mary's. "The road trip was a good exper
ience for us," Stanford Coach Berhane

Anderberhan said. "We have a better
idea of our team now. We should have
more offensive impact this time."
To create more opportunities on of
fense, Andeberhan said he will go with
the 4-4-2 formation, a lineup that puts six
players on the attack. The Cardinal has
enough confidence to abandon the defen
sive Catanaccio formation it used in the
first game against St. Mary's.
I he players are cautiously hopeful
about their chances versus the Gaels. St.
Mary's has the better win-loss record but
could be surprised by a hungry Stanford
squad.
"We don't think they'll be a push
over," McDevitt said. "But if we get our
otfense in gear, we have a good chance."
"We've worked really hard," fresh
man forward Jenny Rowland said.
"We're looking forward to playing them
again."
I he Cardinal has been either hot or
cold this season. After a long and tiring
dry spell on the road, Stanford is healthy
and up for a good performance. The key
is connecting between the midtleld and
the forwards. If that happens, the Cardi
nal could surprise.
The men's soccer team takes on U.S.
International University at 2:30 p.m.
today, so the women will move to an ad
jacent field for their match.
After today's game, Stanford takes on
Texas A&M Sunday at home and then
wraps up the season with a match at rival
Santa Clara Tuesday night.
