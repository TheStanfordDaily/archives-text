# ASSU urges reforms
## Approves Western Culture amendments 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night urged the
Western Culture Task Force to amend its
recently released proposal for changes in
the University's Western Culture require

The senate also called on the adminis
tration to require University Food Service
to support a campus boycott of grapes, a
senate recommendation that the adminis

Since the Western Culture program was
reinstituted in 1980, critics have argued

minorities and non-Western cultures. In
1985 the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies established the Western Culture
Task Force, which was charged with
studying this problem and recommending
changes in the University's Area One
(Western Culture) requirement.
The senate last night voted to support
amendments to the task force's recom

mendations that have been proposed by
the Black Student Union, MEChA (a
Chicano student group), the Stanford
American Indian Organization, the Asian
American Student Association and Stu
dents United for Democracy in Education.
The amendments presented by the
minority groups recommend that Western
Culture classes be required to include the
study of an equal proportion of European
and non-European works. Minority repre
sentatives at last night's meeting also en
couraged the University to recruit more
ethnic minority faculty with expertise in
non-Western fields.
Senator Stacey Leyton, co-author of a
bill to strengthen the task force's recom
mendations, said that "to understand our
world [and] our culture requires more than
a study of the Western world."
Supporting Leyton, Senator Timur
Colak said that non-European studies
"give students a broader perspective on
the world."
