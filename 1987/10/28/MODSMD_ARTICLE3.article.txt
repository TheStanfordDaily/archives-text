# ASSU urges reforms
## Approves Western Culture amendments 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night urged the
Western Culture Task Force to amend its
recently released proposal for changes in
the University's Western Culture require
ment.
The senate also called on the adminis
tration to require University Food Service
to support a campus boycott of grapes, a
senate recommendation that the adminis
tration had honored last year but declined
to enforce over the summer.
Since the Western Culture program was
reinstituted in 1980, critics have argued
that the program does not adequately ad
dress the contributions of women,
minorities and non-Western cultures. In
1985 the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies established the Western Culture
Task Force, which was charged with
studying this problem and recommending
changes in the University's Area One
(Western Culture) requirement.
The senate last night voted to support
amendments to the task force's recom

mendations that have been proposed by
the Black Student Union, MEChA (a
Chicano student group), the Stanford
American Indian Organization, the Asian
American Student Association and Stu
dents United for Democracy in Education.
The amendments presented by the
minority groups recommend that Western
Culture classes be required to include the
study of an equal proportion of European
and non-European works. Minority repre
sentatives at last night's meeting also en
couraged the University to recruit more
ethnic minority faculty with expertise in
non-Western fields.
Senator Stacey Leyton, co-author of a
bill to strengthen the task force's recom
mendations, said that "to understand our
world [and] our culture requires more than
a study of the Western world."
Supporting Leyton, Senator Timur
Colak said that non-European studies
"give students a broader perspective on
the world."
According to Senator Peter Thiel,
however, the proposed require
ment that students study equal
proportions of Western and non-
Western works would "restrict
the academic freedom of the pro
fessors."
Senator Peter Nadan said that
the Western Culture program,
"although biased . . . has been
good so far. If it's Western Cul
ture, it's got to be Western cul
ture, not world culture."
The minority groups also sug
gested an amendment to the task
force recommendations that
would stipulate that the Western
Culture Oversight Compliance
Committee include students. The
oversight committee has been
suggested by the task force as a
way to ensure that instructors
comply with changes in the
Western Culture program.
Final reforms of the Western

Culture program will be decided
by the faculty senate on or before
its Dec. 3 meeting.
Regarding the grape boycott,
many senators expressed dis
pleasure at the administration's
disregard for the senate's recom
mendation last spring that Food
Service not purchase grapes.
Although University Food Ser
vice complied with the recom
mendation last spring, it decided
this summer to begin buying
grapes again.
In May, the senate approved a
resolution calling for a campus
grape boycott in support of a
statewide grape boycott led by
the United Farm Workers Union.
The UFW has claimed that five
carcinogenic pesticides are used
in the growing of grapes.
The pesticides have allegedly
caused cancer in farm workers
who work with grapes and in
children who drink pesticide
contaminated water.
According to several senators,
reinstatement of the boycott is
particularly important because

the University should respect the
authority of the senate.
"It's not a question of boycot
ting grapes. It's more of a ques
tion whether the senate
represents the student body,"
said graduate senator Richard
Vaughan.
"This is really important be
cause it establishes our position
as an organization representative
of the students," Colak said.
In other business, the senate
voted to approve funding for a
Council of Presidents-sponsored
straw poll of student opinion.
Pollsters will call 200 randomly
selected students to ask their
opinions on various issues.
COP member Jim Durkin said
he was optimistic about the polls,
which are due to begin in early
November.
The polls will include ques
tions that "will help the ASSU
make decisions," Durkin said. "I
think it's pretty revolutionary.
It'll add a zing to how [the
ASSUI makes decisions."

Culture program will be decided
by the faculty senate on or before
its Dec. 3 meeting.
Regarding the grape boycott,
many senators expressed dis
pleasure at the administration's
disregard for the senate's recom
mendation last spring that Food
Service not purchase grapes.
Although University Food Ser
vice complied with the recom
mendation last spring, it decided
this summer to begin buying
grapes again.
In May, the senate approved a
resolution calling for a campus
grape boycott in support of a
statewide grape boycott led by
the United Farm Workers Union.
The UFW has claimed that five
carcinogenic pesticides are used
in the growing of grapes.
The pesticides have allegedly
caused cancer in farm workers
who work with grapes and in
children who drink pesticide
contaminated water.
According to several senators,
reinstatement of the boycott is
particularly important because

the University should respect the
authority of the senate.
"It's not a question of boycot
ting grapes. It's more of a ques
tion whether the senate
represents the student body,"
said graduate senator Richard
Vaughan.
"This is really important be
cause it establishes our position
as an organization representative
of the students," Colak said.
In other business, the senate
voted to approve funding for a
Council of Presidents-sponsored
straw poll of student opinion.
Pollsters will call 200 randomly
selected students to ask their
opinions on various issues.
COP member Jim Durkin said
he was optimistic about the polls,
which are due to begin in early
November.
The polls will include ques
tions that "will help the ASSU
make decisions," Durkin said. "I
think it's pretty revolutionary.
It'll add a zing to how [the
ASSUI makes decisions."
The ASSU Senate last night urged the
Western Culture Task Force to amend its
recently released proposal for changes in
the University's Western Culture require
ment.
The senate also called on the adminis
tration to require University Food Service
to support a campus boycott of grapes, a
senate recommendation that the adminis
tration had honored last year but declined
to enforce over the summer.
Since the Western Culture program was
reinstituted in 1980, critics have argued
that the program does not adequately ad
dress the contributions of women,
minorities and non-Western cultures. In
1985 the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies established the Western Culture
Task Force, which was charged with
studying this problem and recommending
changes in the University's Area One
(Western Culture) requirement.
The senate last night voted to support
amendments to the task force's recom

mendations that have been proposed by
the Black Student Union, MEChA (a
Chicano student group), the Stanford
American Indian Organization, the Asian
American Student Association and Stu
dents United for Democracy in Education.
The amendments presented by the
minority groups recommend that Western
Culture classes be required to include the
study of an equal proportion of European
and non-European works. Minority repre
sentatives at last night's meeting also en
couraged the University to recruit more
ethnic minority faculty with expertise in
non-Western fields.
Senator Stacey Leyton, co-author of a
bill to strengthen the task force's recom
mendations, said that "to understand our
world [and] our culture requires more than
a study of the Western world."
Supporting Leyton, Senator Timur
Colak said that non-European studies
"give students a broader perspective on
the world."
According to Senator Peter Thiel,
however, the proposed require
ment that students study equal
proportions of Western and non-
Western works would "restrict
the academic freedom of the pro
fessors."
Senator Peter Nadan said that
the Western Culture program,
"although biased . . . has been
good so far. If it's Western Cul
ture, it's got to be Western cul
ture, not world culture."
The minority groups also sug
gested an amendment to the task
force recommendations that
would stipulate that the Western
Culture Oversight Compliance
Committee include students. The
oversight committee has been
suggested by the task force as a
way to ensure that instructors
comply with changes in the
Western Culture program.
Final reforms of the Western

Culture program will be decided
by the faculty senate on or before
its Dec. 3 meeting.
