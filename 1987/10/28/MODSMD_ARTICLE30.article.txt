## Card looks to end losing skid 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Looking to regain its early season form, the Stan
ford men's soccer team takes the field today against
U.S. International University.
After three defeats and a tie, the latest a 4-0
shutout against San Diego State Friday, the Cardi
nal, now 7-7-3 overall, will seek its first win in five
matches at 2:30 p.m. at Maloney Field.
"We're really looking to put things back together
again," senior midfielder Pat Sheehy said.
Not only is the squad attempting to halt its
downward spiral, it will also be seeking revenge in
today's match. The past two years the Soaring
Gulls have defeated Stanford in close games, 3-2
last season and 2-1 in 1985.
Last year Stanford was down 3-0 at half but fell a
goal short in its second period comeback. Accord
ing to Stanford Coach Sam Koch, the Cardinal gave
the game away.
"Everyone remembers last seaon's loss," Koch
said. "We're looking forward to the rematch."
To prepare for today's game, Stanford has been
working on improving mental concentration, player
communication and marking men more closely.
Mental concentration is the key to getting every
thing else in a game in sync, Koch said.
"Our marking was poor in the loss to San Diego
because we had mental lapses and let down
defensively," he said.
To defeat USIU the Cardinal needs to establish
itself at the very beginning and play well during the
first half. In each of its past three losses, to San
Diego, Simon Fraser and San Jose State, the squad

second period of the game and
was not able to erase its deficit.
"The key to the game is how
we come out at the start," Koch
said. "We need to play the first
half with intensity."
The squad will be without
leading scorer Chris Porch. The
sophomore midfielder sprained
his ankle in the San Diego con
test and will be out for at least
one week.
