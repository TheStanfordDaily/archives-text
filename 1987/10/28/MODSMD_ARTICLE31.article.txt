# Field hockey meets SJSU

And so it is. The proverbial
rubber game.
The Stanford field hockey
team will look to maintain its un
blemished conference record
today at 3 p.m. at San Jose State.
The No. 13 Cardinal is also
hoping to avenge a recent loss to
the Spartans. San Jose handed
Stanford its only defeat at the
California Invitational this past
weekend by shutting out the Car
dinal 1-0 Friday. Stanford has
also beaten San Jose State once
this year.
"We seemed a little tired, a
little flat," Stanford Asst. Coach
Andi Wolpert said. "We de
finitely didn't play as well as we
did when we beat them earlier in
the year, but neither did they.
They scored a fluke goal and
ended up winning a pretty evenly
played game."
Fortunately for Stanford, last
weekend's two games against
conference foes did not count in
the league standings, thus ena
bling the Cardinal to remain 5-0
in Northern Pacific Conference
