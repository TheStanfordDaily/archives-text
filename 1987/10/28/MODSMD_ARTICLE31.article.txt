And so it is. The proverbial
rubber game.
The Stanford field hockey
team will look to maintain its un
blemished conference record
today at 3 p.m. at San Jose State.
The No. 13 Cardinal is also
hoping to avenge a recent loss to
the Spartans. San Jose handed
Stanford its only defeat at the
California Invitational this past
weekend by shutting out the Car
dinal 1-0 Friday. Stanford has
also beaten San Jose State once
this year.
"We seemed a little tired, a
little flat," Stanford Asst. Coach
Andi Wolpert said. "We de
finitely didn't play as well as we
did when we beat them earlier in
the year, but neither did they.
They scored a fluke goal and
ended up winning a pretty evenly
played game."
Fortunately for Stanford, last
weekend's two games against
conference foes did not count in
the league standings, thus ena
bling the Cardinal to remain 5-0
in Northern Pacific Conference

that the loss to the Spartans isn t
weighing heavily on the players
minds.
"1 think it will make us want to
beat them a little more, Wolpert
said. "We knew the last game
against them didn't count, and 1
think that contributed to the loss.
But we also know how important
this game is."
' Indeed, it Stanford, despite
its flawless conference mark.

holds a mere one-and-a-half
game lead over both San Jose
and California. A win for the
Spartans would up their confer
ence mark to 4-1-1 and pull them
to within a half game of the Car
dinal.
The iast thing the team is ex
pecting is an easy game. "They
are a very good squad," Stanford
Head Coach Sheryl Johnson
said. "It's always a good
rivalry."
Wolpert, who just last year
finished her playing days with the
Cardinal, is even more wary.
"We traditionally have a tough
time up there (San Jose)," she
said.
