# Card cycling working out
## 
### Witold Henisz 
The Stanford cycling team has rebounded
strongly from a disappointing third-place finish at
the national championships last May.
Over the summer. Cardinal riders competed in
over 100 races, placing in virtually all of them and
winning over a dozen.
Graduate student Mike Fadich received a gold
medal for his participation on the Collegiate Pursuit
Championship Team. Senior Russell Mead won the
National Tandem Championship and brought Stan
ford its second gold medal of the summer.
The Stanford cycling team finds itself in the
toughest of the four national divisions. California
cyclists won over 50 percent of all the medals in the
collegiate national championship last month.
The team has been well reinforced by the arrival
of several talented freshmen over the past two
years.
In its first substantial event of the 1987-88 season,
the team staged an intra-squad race Oct. 17.
Fadich set a course record of 20:06 and averaged
27.4 mph on a rolling 9.25- mile course. His closest
competition, graduate student Art Walker, finished
over a minute later. Sophomore Scott Evans
rounded out the placings with a finish 90 seconds
behind Walker.
Anyone interested in joining the cycling team can
join team members for team rides that leave
from the Stanford Post Office at 3:30 p.m. every
weekday, 10 a.m. Saturdays and 9 a.m. Sundays.
The week begins with a three-to-five-hour ardu
ous coast ride on Sunday. Monday and Tuesday
provide some rest before at least 2000 vertical feet
of climbing on Wednesdays. Thursday provides an
other break before the team techniques workout on
Friday. Saturday doubles as a light team workout
and the only requirement for a one-unit PF2 class on
cycling.
The team is in search of woman riders this year.
Last year Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo put forth a cy
cling team four times the size of Stanford's. Where
Stanford once had women destined to be national
champions, last year it often failed to put forth a full
women's team.
