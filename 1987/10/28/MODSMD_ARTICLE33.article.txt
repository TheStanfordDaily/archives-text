# Stanford sailing struts its stuff

### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
Stanford's singlehanded and
women's sailing teams each
scored important victories at a
pair of separate regattas last
weekend.
At the Pacific Coast Single
handed Championships held in
Laser class sailboats in Long
Beach, Stanford claimed first and
fourth place, and in doing so
qualified for the national champi
onship for the first time since
1982.
Further north, at the Women's
Fall Championship held in Flying
Junior class sailboats in Santa
Cruz, Stanford took first place
overall in a regatta that attracted
the best women sailors from Cali
fornia.
"The weekend couldn't have
gotten much better," Stanford
Coach Blake Middleton said.
One highlight of the Cardinal's
weekend was senior Tom
Kuhnle's victory at the Pacific
Coast regatta, the latest in a
string of important wins for the
Stanford star. Kuhnle won seven
of the 16 races held, ending up 11
points ahead of UC-lrvine's Jon
Pinckney, who was followed by
Jim Otis of USC in third and
Stanford sophomore Al Sargent
in fourth.
The Cardinal had not won the
Pacific Coast Championship
since 1965, when Bill Twist, now
a Stanford sailing trustee, won
the regatta on his way to a na
tional championship.
"The fleet was filled with great
people, but Kuhnle did every

thing he had to do to win. Fie just
sailed an exceptionally good
regatta," Middleton said.
"I knew he could do it, be
cause all the time we've been
sailing together we've been
working on getting his psychol
ogy right," said junior Rita
Snape, who crews for Kuhnle in
Flying Juniors.
Though Kuhnle's win drew a
great deal of attention, he was
quick to point out the tine per
formance of teammate Sargent,
who missed finishing third at the
regatta only because of a tech
nicality.
"Al was always there, working
the boat to death and nipping at
my heels. Next year, he'll be the
guy to beat," Kuhnle said.
While the singlehanded sailors
were fighting it out down south,
Stanford's women sailors were
trouncing the competition closer
to home, finishing ahead of the
hometown team from UC-Santa
Cruz and a traditionally strong
team from California. Seniors
Allie Rowe and Jen Brokaw
combined with the team of soph
omore Kim Grose and freshman
Sarah Gannett to win the regatta
by 12 points.
The Women's Championship
took place in light to moderate
winds that tested the endurance
of the Cardinal skippers, as the
day's racing stretched on for
hour after uninterrupted hour.
Though both of Stanford's teams
had problems with inconsis
tency, each turned in an impres
sive record of finishes on the way
to their regatta win.
