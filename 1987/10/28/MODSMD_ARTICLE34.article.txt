# Expert: Soviet justice flawed but improving
## 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
Citing the case of the West
German youth who landed his
airplane in Moscow's Red
Square last August, a visiting
scholar at the Hoover Institution
said yesterday that the Soviet
judicial system is "improving but
not ideal."
Frances Foster-Simons, spe
cialist in socialist law, discussed
the trial of Mathias Rust, the
West German pilot who was con
victed Sept. 2 of illegally flying
into Moscow and landing in Red
Square.
The Soviet Union publicized
the trial widely as a positive illus
tration of its democratic legal
system.
Foster-Simons said Rust was
held in a KGB prison for two
months after the incident while
the prosecution investigated the
details of the case and deter
mined that he was not a spy.
She said the prosecution even
tually charged Rust with illegal
border crossing, violation of in
ternational aviation regulations
and "aggravated hooliganism."
Foster-Simons explained that
"aggravated hooliganism" is an
act that "expresses a clear dis
respect for society with cynicism
and special impudence."
She said many people in the
Soviet Union were offended by
Rust's action and felt the charge
of "hooliganism" was warran
ted. The prosecution said Rust
had "desecrated a holy shrine of
the Russian peoples" by landing
in Red Square, she explained.
Foster-Simons noted that no
defense lawyer took part in the

lengthy investigation that
resulted in these charges. She
added that if a defense lawyer
had taken part in the investiga
tion and had had a commitment
to clearing his client of guilt, then
the process would have been
truly democratic.
But, she said, the defense
lawyer was on vacation for a
month before the trial and
prepared his defense only three
days before the trial took place.
Foster-Simons also said the
defense lawyer announced that
he would "do his best to ease the
burden of guilt and to help
mitigate the judge's decision."
These facts show that a
presumption of guilt was held by
the defense as well as the prose
cution, she said.
Foster-Simons said many
lawyers in the Soviet Union
realize that the lack of a defense
lawyer in the investigative proc
ess allows many abuses of the
justice system, and said she
believes the Soviets are begin
ning to address this flaw.
Foster-Simons said the trial
was attended by 25 foreign
reporters and was hailed by the
Soviet press as an example of the
Soviet Union's increasing
"openness" to foreigners.
According to Foster-Simons,
the fact that the trial was demo
cratic and open to foreign
reporters has little importance
because about 95 percent of
people who stand trial in the So
viet Union are convicted.
Foster-Simons spoke to an au
dience of 25 people at Hurlburt
House.
