will join admissions officers
from five other colleges on a
trip to Europe next week in an
effort to provide expatriate
Americans and European stu

U.S. colleges and universities.
Fetter, who will travel with
representatives from Carleton
College, Columbia University,
Duke University, Wesleyan
University and Williams Col
lege, will make stops in Italy,
Austria, Switzerland, West
Germany, France, Belgium,
England and Wales. The trip,
which will begin Monday, will
last for 11 days.
According to Richard Nes

trip is designed to inform ex
patriate Americans and
European students about op

in the United States.
"We hope to reach as many
qualified students as possible
and make them aware of the
benefits of attending distin
guished American schools,"
Nesbit said.
"Quite frankly, we are six
terrific undergraduate schools,
and we're going to establish a
strong base. We want a broader
application pool, and I think
this will help tremendously,"
he added.
According to Fetter, the ad
missions officers will speak to
potential applicants about the
general admissions process,
with a special emphasis on fi
nancial aid.
"We want the American
citizens to know that all six
schools have need-blind admis
sions and that the cost of pres
tigious schools isn't as prohibi
tive as they believe it to be. We
want to encourage them to ap

ply," Fetter said.
"Having us there will
definitely materialize many
hopes that they have in attend-
