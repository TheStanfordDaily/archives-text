# Fetter to recruit abroad
## 
### Angie Mimm 
Stanford Dean of Undergrad
uate Admissions Jean Fetter
will join admissions officers
from five other colleges on a
trip to Europe next week in an
effort to provide expatriate
Americans and European stu
dents with information about
U.S. colleges and universities.
Fetter, who will travel with
representatives from Carleton
College, Columbia University,
Duke University, Wesleyan
University and Williams Col
lege, will make stops in Italy,
Austria, Switzerland, West
Germany, France, Belgium,
England and Wales. The trip,
which will begin Monday, will
last for 11 days.
According to Richard Nes
bit, assistant dean of Admis
sions at Williams College, the
trip is designed to inform ex
patriate Americans and
European students about op

portunities for higher education
in the United States.
"We hope to reach as many
qualified students as possible
and make them aware of the
benefits of attending distin
guished American schools,"
Nesbit said.
"Quite frankly, we are six
terrific undergraduate schools,
and we're going to establish a
strong base. We want a broader
application pool, and I think
this will help tremendously,"
he added.
According to Fetter, the ad
missions officers will speak to
potential applicants about the
general admissions process,
with a special emphasis on fi
nancial aid.
"We want the American
citizens to know that all six
schools have need-blind admis
sions and that the cost of pres
tigious schools isn't as prohibi
tive as they believe it to be. We
want to encourage them to ap

ply," Fetter said.
"Having us there will
definitely materialize many
hopes that they have in attend-


Jean Fetter
ing American schools; it'll make
everything seem more realistic,"
Nesbit said.
According to a press release
issued by the delegation, the six
schools hope to offer distinct op
tions in their presentations. Each
officer will speak about the
qualities which separate one
school from another and will
focus on common aspects of
higher education in the United
States.
Fetter said she will address
"distinctively Stanford" aspects
in her presentations, including
distribution requirements, over
seas studies, Residential Educa
tion, research opportunities and
extracurricular activities.
Fetter added that she will also
emphasize "the distinctive, ad

vantageous location of Stan
ford .''
In addition to attracting stu
dents, Fetter said she hopes to
contact Stanford alumni now
living in Europe.
Fetter said she had decided not
to go on this trip last month but
later changed her mind because
of the financial benefits it might
bring to Stanford.
"This year being the Centen
nial year, 1 thought it would be
great to go visit Stanford alumni
in Europe. Keeping in contact
with alumni is very important,
and we don't get a chance to visit
overseas alumni very often." she
said.
Fetter will be meeting with
Stanford alumni in London, Paris
and Rome.
"I'm really looking forward to
this," Fetter said. "I'm feeling
mixture of excitement and trepi
dation."
