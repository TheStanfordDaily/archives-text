# Campbell declares
## Law professor joins House race 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Law Prof. Tom Campbell for
mally announced his candidacy
for Congress yesterday and
named former Congressman Ed
Zschau and Hewlett-Packard co
founder David Packard as
honorary co-chairmen of his
campaign.
Campbell announced at a press
conference yesterday morning
that he will oppose first-term in
cumbent U.S. Rep. Ernie Kon
nyu in the June 1988 Republican
primary election for the 12th
Congressional District, which in
cludes Stanford.
Billionaire industrialist Pack
ard, who was not present at the
press conference, said in a
prepared statement that "Ernie
Konnyu is a fine man; however,
he has been ineffective in
Congress. We need a stronger,
more capable person to represent
this district."
Packard is expected to help
raise the $500,000 Campbell has
estimated will be necessary to
defeat Konnyu in the primary.
Campbell declined to say how
much money he has raised so far,
but allowed that he was
"pleased" with his exploratory
committee's progress.
The timing of Campbell's an
nouncement came as a surprise
to local political observers.
Campbell had previously told
reporters that although he had or
ganized an exploratory commit
tee he would not officially
declare his candidacy until Janu
ary due to stringent campaign
contribution disclosure laws.
Speaking to an overflow crowd
of 100 supporters at his home
near campus, Campbell said that
he planned to run a positive cam
paign "focused on issues."
Campbell detailed a four-point
agenda for his campaign, which
included:
• reduction of the budget deficit,
• fairness in trade,
• equality for women in the
workforce, and
• an end to the "litigation glut in
America."
"We cannot reduce the budget
deficit the amount it needs to be
reduced unless we are prepared
to put everything, including the
defense budget, but excluding so
cial security, on the table,"
Campbell said.
Campbell emphasized that in
creased revenues are also needed
to reduce the nation's deficit. He
added that he would favor an oil
excise "fee" and an alcohol and
tobacco excise tax.
Though he would not respond
to allegations that Konnyu had

sexually harassed female em
ployees in his office, Campbell
noted that "it is hypocrisy that
the federal law barring sexual
harassment and discrimination
does not apply to congressional
offices."
Zschau, who represented the
12th District from 1982-1986, was
asked whether a strong can
didacy by Campbell would split
local Republicans. "This cam
paign is not a referendum on
Ernie Konnyu," Zschau an
swered.
Zschau said he had written a
letter to Konnyu notifying him of
his endorsement of Campbell. "1
told [Konnyu] that a primary
campaign that was positive, ori
ented to the issues, would be a
plus to the party."
Dick Legett, an administrative
assistant for Konnyu in Washing
ton, said Konnyu had no com
ment on Campbell's candidacy.
"We wish him luck," said
Legett. "He'll run his campaign,
and we'll run ours, and down the
road we'll meet somewhere."
Last week, Konnyu began an
offensive of his own in anticipa
tion of Campbell's announce
ment, publicizing a list of his own
supporters in Congress, which
includes the entire California Re
publican congressional delega
tion.
Campbell also has the support
of former Congressman Paul
"Pete" McCloskey. McCloskey
represented the 12th Congres
sional District from 1967 to 1982.
