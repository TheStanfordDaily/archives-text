Incumbent U.S. Rep. Ernie
Konnyu released a list of pledged
supporters last week in an at
tempt to counter a growing num
ber of endorsements for Law
Prof. Tom Campbell, who yester
day announced he would run
against Konnyu in the June 1988
Republican primary.
Silvio Conte (R-Mass.), a 29-
year congressman whom Kon
nyu reportedly affronted in a
June name-calling incident,
pledged his support for Konnyu.
Also included on the 12th District
incumbent's list of supporters are
every Republican member of the
California congressional delega
tion and House Republican
Leader Robert Michel (R-Ill.).
The California Republican
congressmen, in a letter ad
dressed to the voters of the 12th
District, which includes Stan
ford, called Konnyu an "out
standing leader."
At a press conference an
nouncing his candidacy yester
day, Campbell cited a number of
influential Republicans who have
endorsed him, including former
Rep. Ed Zschau and industrialist
David Packard. Campbell also
said two Stanford trustees, Ver
non Anderson and Tom Ford,
and four professors have publicly
declared support for him.
Packard, chair of Hewlett-
Packard and a former deputy sec
retary of defense, contributed
$1000 to Konnyu's campaign in
1986.
Ford, who heads the influential
Lincoln Club, a group of
prominent local Republican busi
nessmen, said Campbell was a
"strong" candidate but that the
club would not endorse either
candidate.
The professors listed by
Campbell included Economics
Prof. Michael Boskin, Assoc. Po

litical Science Prof. Condoleeza
Rice, Engineering and Econom
ics Systems Prof. Jim Sweeney
and Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal.
Friedenthal praised Campbell
for his "intelligence and sensitiv
ity to major issues.
"The truth of the matter is that
Konnyu is not and never will be a
forceful leader," Friedenthal
said. "He lacks the expertise."
