### Frank Quaratiello Staff writer 
A founding member of the Christie Institute, an
organization known for its legal defense of
prominent activists, last night asked students to stir
up public interest in U.S. covert operations in
Central America.
"The question is what type of counterforce
(against U.S. covert operations in Central
America) is going to be raised up on the campuses
of this country, because the campuses have to play
a major role," Danny Sheehan told a capacity
Kresge Auditorium audience.
The Christie Institute is currently representing
ABC-TV cameraman Tony Aberdine in a civil suit
against 29 of the people involved in the Iran-contra
affair over a bombing on Memorial Day in 1984 in

Sheehan also criticized the way representatives
were selected for the committee.
"Two-thirds of those men (on the select commit

The committee and the public hearings were only
meant to divert the public's attention from what is
really going on, he said. There is an elite group of
government intelligence officials carrying on covert
operations that the American public does not know
about, he charged.
He went on to describe "a secret team" made up
of higher government intelligence officials that is
working behind the scenes and controlling U.S.

Sheehan described this secret team as consisting
