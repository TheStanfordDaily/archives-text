## Activist criticizes covert war 
### Frank Quaratiello Staff writer 
A founding member of the Christie Institute, an
organization known for its legal defense of
prominent activists, last night asked students to stir
up public interest in U.S. covert operations in
Central America.
"The question is what type of counterforce
(against U.S. covert operations in Central
America) is going to be raised up on the campuses
of this country, because the campuses have to play
a major role," Danny Sheehan told a capacity
Kresge Auditorium audience.
The Christie Institute is currently representing
ABC-TV cameraman Tony Aberdine in a civil suit
against 29 of the people involved in the Iran-contra
affair over a bombing on Memorial Day in 1984 in
Nicaragua. Eight people were killed, and Aberdine
was iryured in the incident.
In his speech. Sheehan charged that the Reagan
administration is trying to sell the American public
a false image of the situation in Central America.
He stressed the distinction between the pretense
and the reality of the Reagan administration.
Sheehan criticized the congressional select com
mittee that convened last summer to probe the
Iran-contra affair. He called the committee s probe

"an illusion."
He also pointed out that it was Attorney General
Edwin Meese 111 who drafted the charter for the
special prosecutor that led to the select committee
meeting. The charter, Sheehan said, was specifi
cally drawn up to focus attention on the small
amount of money that was diverted from the Iran
arms sales to the contras, while ignoring the large
scale covert arms sales that were being made di
rectly to the contras by U.S. intelligence officials.
Sheehan also criticized the way representatives
were selected for the committee.
"Two-thirds of those men (on the select commit
tee) were rabid advocates of full military funding
for the contras," Sheehan said.
The committee and the public hearings were only
meant to divert the public's attention from what is
really going on, he said. There is an elite group of
government intelligence officials carrying on covert
operations that the American public does not know
about, he charged.
He went on to describe "a secret team" made up
of higher government intelligence officials that is
working behind the scenes and controlling U.S.
foreign policy.
Sheehan described this secret team as consisting
of men with "a blatant disdain
for civilian rule over the military
industrial complex, utter con
tempt for Congress and disdain
for democracy." He went on to
describe this secret team's plan
to "suspend the Constitution."
"We're in the midst of a con
stitutional crisis," Sheehan said.
This team of U.S. intelligence
officials planned to use political
assassinations and terrorism to
promote U.S.-backed govern
ments in Central America,
Sheehan said. This plan was to
be financed by "black funds" ob
tained by smuggling drugs into
the United States, Sheehan said.
Sheehan urged listeners to try

to learn more about American
government covert actions.
"It's the least that can be ex
pected of us who are supposed to
hold the torch high to learn about
the secret history of U.S. foreign
policy," Sheehan said.
Sheehan charged that, begin
ning with the adoption of the Na
tional Security Act in 1947 and
continuing until the present day,
an intricate web of covert gov
ernment operations has been
carried out by an elite group of
intelligence officials.
Money and munitions for the
contras were set aside long
before Lt. Cel. Oliver North
became involved in the project,
Sheehan said. The secret team
began setting money and arms
aside as early as 1973, when
reformist movements in the
United States started pressuring
them to curtail their operations,

he said.
Between 1976 and 1980, the
Carter administration fired 820
men from the CIA covert opera
tions department, but the mem
bers of the secret team escaped,
Sheehan said.
Under the Reagan administra
tion, covert operations increased
again and the secret team became
more active.
"This (covert operations) is a
serious cancer in our body
politic," Sheehan said.
Sheehan concluded by plead
ing with his listeners to "get
something kindled."
Sheehan"s speech was part of
Central American Education
Week, a program sponsored in
part by the Palo Alto-Stanford
Medical Aid Committee for
Central America (PASMAC) to
educate the public about U.S. in
volvement in Central America.
