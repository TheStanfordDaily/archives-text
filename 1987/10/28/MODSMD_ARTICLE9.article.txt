Reagan to receive Court short list
WASHINGTON — White House officials hope to present
President Reagan with a short list of potential Supreme Court
nominees today or tomorrow, and California federal appeals
court Judge Anthony Kennedy is expected to be prominently
featured, administration and Senate sources said yesterday.
But hopes of having a new selection for the high court this
week apparently have run into complications because of infight
ing within the administration, conflicting advice from senators
whose opinions have been solicited during the last two days and
other pressures on Reagan and his senior advisers. Those pres
sures range from demands on their time and negotiations over
the economy to the deaths of Nancy Reagan's mother and At
torney General Edwin Meese Ill's grandson.
Administration officials hope that Reagan will be able tomor
row to announce a nominee for the court, which has been short
one justice since June 26 when Justice Lewis Powell Jr. retired.
But the process now "appears to be somewhat jumbled," said a
Senate Judiciary Committee source familiar with the meetings
between senators and White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker Jr.
"There's nothing magic about Thursday. There's nothing
magic about this week," said Baker before meeting yesterday
morning with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and Majority Leader Robert Byrd, (D-
W.Va.). But, Baker added, "the calendar will overwhelm us," if
a nominee is not named soon.
Panama and Chile arm Sandinistas
WASHINGTON — In a covert arrangement with the military
dictatorships of Panama and Chile, Nicaragua's Marxist Sandi
nistas have obtained cluster bombs to drop on U.S.-backed con
tra guerrillas, according to U.S. officials.
The officials said their information is that Nicaragua and
Chile, which do not have diplomatic relations, have used
Panama as middleman in the transactions that began three or
four months ago. The officials said Panama purchased an un
specified number of cluster bombs from Ferrimar, a Chilean ar
maments manufacturer with close ties to Chile's military gov
ernment, then transferred them secretly to Nicaragua.
Cluster bombs spread shrapnel over a wide area. Many
human rights and disarmament activists have denounced their
u«e as inhumane. The United States stopped sending them to Is
rael following charges that Israel improperly used them during
the 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
Spokesmen here for the three countries said they had no in
formation about such a sale but that the story sounded im
probable.
Bosco Matamoros, a contra spokesman contacted in Central
America, said contra forces inside Nicaragua had recovered
several canisters from cluster bombs used against them by
Nicaraguan government forces in bombing raids Oct. 7, 8 and
10.
Negotiators begin spending talks
WASHINGTON — White House and congressional budget
negotiators, saying the government should adopt a multi-year
plan to reduce the nation's $148 billion deficit, held their first
working session yesterday but reported little progress beyond
an agreement to tone down partisan rhetoric and continue their
meetings until they come up with a bipartisan plan.
The negotiators, mindful that Wall Street and other shaky fi
nancial markets were scrutinizing their sessions for signs of
long-term economic reforms, touched broadly on the deficit
cutting options available to them and agreed on "ground rules"
for later discussions, according to participants in the two-hour
meeting on Capitol Hill.
"It was a good start," said Rep. Silvio Conte (R-Mass.) the
ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee.
"It's like a heavyweight championship boxing match.
Everybody's sparring, but no blows nave been landed, which is
good."
Earlier in the day, President Reagan said he was willing to
"put aside partisan rivalries" and work with congressional
leaders, because "these meetings come at a critical moment.
The stock market has alerted us of potential dangers on the eco
nomic horizon."
Bill would amend covert operations
WASHINGTON — Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), a member of
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, yesterday intro
duced legislative reforms for the Central Intelligence Agency
stemming from the Iran-contra scandal, including a proposal
calling for mandatory prison terms for government officials con
victed of lying to Congress.
He also joined other Senate and House members who have
proposed that President Reagan and his successors be required
by law to inform Congress within one or two days after approval
of any covert intelligence operations.
Specter also proposes splitting the Director of Central Intelli
gence job into two posts: a Director of National Intelligence to
be the president's primary adviser on foreign intelligence, su
pervise all U.S. intelligence-gathering agencies, and serve as a
member of the National Security Council; and a Director of the
CIA to manage the agency and carry out covert action.
Currently, the CIA director is charged with providing the
president and his advisers objective intelligence relating to
policy and at the same time carrying out covert operations to
support that policy.
Deaver perjury trial opens in D.C.
WASHINGTON — A federal jury yesterday was asked to see
Micheal Deaver's dramatic fall from power as either the tale of a
Reagan administration insider anxious to trade on his position
for millions of dollars in lobbying fees or the story of a dedi
cated, but seriously ill Reagan loyalist reluctant to leave the side
of the president he admired.
Those were the conflicting portraits painted of the former
White House deputy chief of staff as his trial began in U.S. Dis
trict Court here on five counts of lying to a congressional sub
committee and a federal grand jury.
Whitney North Seymour Jr., the independent counsel
prosecuting the case, told the jury that this is a case of a
longtime aide to President and Nancy Reagan who "decided to
turn that relationship into personal gain" and then attempted to
cover up the contacts he made as a lobbyist, partly in fear of em
barrassing the Reagans.
As he ticked off a list of Deaver's lobbying clients and
stressed the large fees they paid him immediately after he left
the White House in 1985, Seymour asked what he called "a cri
tical question you're going to have to ask yourselves: 'Why?
What were they buying?' '
Deaver's lawyer, Herbert Miller Jr.. disputed those assertions
in his opening arguments.

Negotiators begin spending talks
WASHINGTON — White House and congressional budget
negotiators, saying the government should adopt a multi-year
plan to reduce the nation's $148 billion deficit, held their first
working session yesterday but reported little progress beyond
an agreement to tone down partisan rhetoric and continue their
meetings until they come up with a bipartisan plan.
The negotiators, mindful that Wall Street and other shaky fi
nancial markets were scrutinizing their sessions for signs of
long-term economic reforms, touched broadly on the deficit
cutting options available to them and agreed on "ground rules"
for later discussions, according to participants in the two-hour
meeting on Capitol Hill.
"It was a good start," said Rep. Silvio Conte (R-Mass.) the
ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee.
"It's like a heavyweight championship boxing match.
Everybody's sparring, but no blows nave been landed, which is
good."
Earlier in the day, President Reagan said he was willing to
"put aside partisan rivalries" and work with congressional
leaders, because "these meetings come at a critical moment.
The stock market has alerted us of potential dangers on the eco
nomic horizon."
Bill would amend covert operations
WASHINGTON — Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), a member of
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, yesterday intro
duced legislative reforms for the Central Intelligence Agency
stemming from the Iran-contra scandal, including a proposal
calling for mandatory prison terms for government officials con
victed of lying to Congress.
He also joined other Senate and House members who have
proposed that President Reagan and his successors be required
by law to inform Congress within one or two days after approval
of any covert intelligence operations.
Specter also proposes splitting the Director of Central Intelli
gence job into two posts: a Director of National Intelligence to
be the president's primary adviser on foreign intelligence, su
pervise all U.S. intelligence-gathering agencies, and serve as a
member of the National Security Council; and a Director of the
CIA to manage the agency and carry out covert action.
Currently, the CIA director is charged with providing the
president and his advisers objective intelligence relating to
policy and at the same time carrying out covert operations to
support that policy.
Deaver perjury trial opens in D.C.
WASHINGTON — A federal jury yesterday was asked to see
Micheal Deaver's dramatic fall from power as either the tale of a
Reagan administration insider anxious to trade on his position
for millions of dollars in lobbying fees or the story of a dedi
cated, but seriously ill Reagan loyalist reluctant to leave the side
of the president he admired.
Those were the conflicting portraits painted of the former
White House deputy chief of staff as his trial began in U.S. Dis
trict Court here on five counts of lying to a congressional sub
committee and a federal grand jury.
Whitney North Seymour Jr., the independent counsel
prosecuting the case, told the jury that this is a case of a
longtime aide to President and Nancy Reagan who "decided to
turn that relationship into personal gain" and then attempted to
cover up the contacts he made as a lobbyist, partly in fear of em
barrassing the Reagans.
As he ticked off a list of Deaver's lobbying clients and
stressed the large fees they paid him immediately after he left
the White House in 1985, Seymour asked what he called "a cri
tical question you're going to have to ask yourselves: 'Why?
What were they buying?' '
Deaver's lawyer, Herbert Miller Jr.. disputed those assertions
in his opening arguments.

Reagan to receive Court short list
WASHINGTON — White House officials hope to present
President Reagan with a short list of potential Supreme Court
nominees today or tomorrow, and California federal appeals
court Judge Anthony Kennedy is expected to be prominently
featured, administration and Senate sources said yesterday.
But hopes of having a new selection for the high court this
week apparently have run into complications because of infight
ing within the administration, conflicting advice from senators
whose opinions have been solicited during the last two days and
other pressures on Reagan and his senior advisers. Those pres
sures range from demands on their time and negotiations over
the economy to the deaths of Nancy Reagan's mother and At
torney General Edwin Meese Ill's grandson.
Administration officials hope that Reagan will be able tomor
row to announce a nominee for the court, which has been short
one justice since June 26 when Justice Lewis Powell Jr. retired.
But the process now "appears to be somewhat jumbled," said a
Senate Judiciary Committee source familiar with the meetings
between senators and White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker Jr.
"There's nothing magic about Thursday. There's nothing
magic about this week," said Baker before meeting yesterday
morning with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and Majority Leader Robert Byrd, (D-
W.Va.). But, Baker added, "the calendar will overwhelm us," if
a nominee is not named soon.
Panama and Chile arm Sandinistas
WASHINGTON — In a covert arrangement with the military
dictatorships of Panama and Chile, Nicaragua's Marxist Sandi
nistas have obtained cluster bombs to drop on U.S.-backed con
tra guerrillas, according to U.S. officials.
The officials said their information is that Nicaragua and
Chile, which do not have diplomatic relations, have used
Panama as middleman in the transactions that began three or
four months ago. The officials said Panama purchased an un
specified number of cluster bombs from Ferrimar, a Chilean ar
maments manufacturer with close ties to Chile's military gov
ernment, then transferred them secretly to Nicaragua.
Cluster bombs spread shrapnel over a wide area. Many
human rights and disarmament activists have denounced their
u«e as inhumane. The United States stopped sending them to Is
rael following charges that Israel improperly used them during
the 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
Spokesmen here for the three countries said they had no in
formation about such a sale but that the story sounded im
probable.
Bosco Matamoros, a contra spokesman contacted in Central
America, said contra forces inside Nicaragua had recovered
