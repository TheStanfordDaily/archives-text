Life After Stanford
Next week, a special magazine will be
inserted in The Stanford Daily. The maga
zine explores the options open to students
after they leave school. Articles touch on
how to find the right job, how to prepare for
an interview and how the economy will
affect what jobs are available.
Coming Tuesday, Nov. 3.
Don't miss it.
