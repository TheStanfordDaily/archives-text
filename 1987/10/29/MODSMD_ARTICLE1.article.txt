# Residences' air asbestos-free, study reveals

Asbestos levels in most Stanford residences are
safe, but University officials will conduct further
tests at Stern Hall because of a slightly high level of
fibers there.
Summer 1986 test results released yesterday by
the University that measure the concentration of
fibers in the air show that "no particles of asbestos
were found" in any residence, said John Hughes,
associate provost for Management and Budget.
Fibers detected in the sampling could include
"fiberglass, lint or wool from winter coats,"
Hughes said, adding that such fibers "are not
harmful as far as we know."
Every University residence with the exception of
most of the Row Houses was tested in the survey.
Fiber levels in Stern Hall measured 0.02 fibers
per cubic centimeter, while tests at Hammarskjold
House detected a level of 0.01 â€” the point at which
the University takes precautions.
However, the fiber levels at Stern are "not at a
level of action," said Keith Guy, director of
Housing and Food Service.
"The action level is 0.1 (fibers per cubic centime
ter), and a lower level, 0.01, indicates we need to
investigate further," Hughes explained.
"Stern is highly interesting, since it was least
likely [to be] problematic," said Hughes. "It was
determined not to be an asbestos fiber generator."
"The results are above the control levels set by
Stanford," said Guy, adding that his department
plans to take another air sample at Stern, he said.
"These air samples were taken in July or August
of 1986, and the room (where the sample at Stern
was taken) may have been dusty," Guy said.
According to Guy, the area at Hammarskjold
"had been abated last summer." The air sample
was taken in a laundry room, where the fiber read
ings are usually high, he said.
Only seven Row houses were tested for asbestos
because the houses are so similar, Hughes said. "If
we discover a problem in one, we will test all the
Row houses."
The University subcontracted a firm to take the
actual air samples, Hughes said. "It took a year to
survey all the different buildings, and most samples
were taken between quarters so as not to disturb
students."
The testing determined priorities for future tests.
