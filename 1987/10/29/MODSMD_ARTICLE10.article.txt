# U.S. soldiers killed in Philippines

MANILA, Philippines â€” Three American
servicemen, one of them retired, were shot
and killed in separate but apparently well
coordinated attacks yesterday outside Clark
Air Base, marking the first known terrorist
incidents against American targets here in
more than a decade.
In a fourth incident, an American ser
viceman in his car came under fire about the
same time as the other attacks, but he
escaped injury, according to Maj. Thomas
Boyd, a spokesman at Clark, the American
leased facility in Pampanga Province north of
here.
All of the attacks occurred within two
miles of Clark and within 15 minutes of one
another, beginning shortly before 4 p.m.
Wednesday afternoon here.
One serviceman was killed while walking
near a McDonald's restaurant in Dau, Pam
panga Province, and another was killed on
the road to Carmenville, a mostly American
subdivision. In that incident, military officials
said a Filipino, who came to the scene to help
the American, was killed.
A car carrying an American came under
fire at about the same time on the road to the
Sunset Valley housing subdivision, but the as
sailants missed. In the fourth attack, a retired
Air Force serviceman was killed at Henson
ville, a military housing area.
No one claimed responsibility for the at
tacks, and the military refused to speculate
about the killers. "We don't have any way at
this time to determine whether the attacks
were coordinated, whether Americans were
specific targets, or what the motives were,"
Boyd said. "We have not come to any con
clusions. It is too soon."
Maj. Gen. Donald Snyder, the 13th Air
Force Commander, went on the armed forces

television station here and and asked military
personnel to "maintain very, very good
prudence" and restrict their travel off base to
well-traveled roads. "We're not sure who's
perpetrated these crimes," he said.
Most analysts said the killings could either
be the work of communist assassins or rebel
right-wing military officers who want to de
stabilize the government of President
Corazon Aquino.
The slayings come after weeks of repeated
warnings from the communist New People's
Army that it was prepared to escalate its 19-
year-old insurgency by attacking American
targets.
The most recent issue of Ang Bayan, the
communist party's official newsletter, carries
an unsigned statement in which the party
threatens to attack American military
facilities and business interests.
Earlier this month, the Northern Luzon
chapter of the New People's Army held a
clandestine press conference for a handful of
reporters, and a rebel spokeswoman, Ruth
Firmeza, announced, "If there is another
coup or martial law, we will hit the U.S. im
perialists, all American personnel, military,
diplomatic or what." She said that "U.S.
facilities are also targets" and announced a
"hit list" of prominent Filipino politicians
and some journalists, including Newsweek
magazine correspondent Melinda Liu.
The slayings outside Clark bore a striking
resemblance to the recent spate of slayings in
Manila by "sparrow units," the NPA's urban
assassination squads.
The serviceman killed near McDonald's
was identified by Philippine police as Randy
Davis, 30, of the Air Force. Three men
opened fire on him at point blank range,
police said.

A Philippine police spokesman said the
three gunmen fled aboard a "jeepney.' Ihe
spokesman in Dan said two empty shells from
a 45-caliber pistol were found at the scene.
"Sparrow" assassinations in Manila have
generally followed the same pattern, with a
group of three men or women approaching
their victim on a street, opening fire at close
range with concealed handguns and then
fleeing aboard passenger jeeps where they
easily blend into the crowds.
If the communists are linked to the
slayings, it could mark a potentially dramatic
escalation of the insurgency which has in
creasingly taken its campaign of violence
from the countryside to the city streets. Such
a turn of events would also pose new policy
risks for the United States which has for the
most part avoided being directly drawn into
the Philippines' counter-insurgency effort.
Despite the earlier communist threats to at
tack Americans, however, analysts were cau
tious about assessing responsibility for Wed
nesday's killings. Despite the obvious
propaganda value of the threats, the commu
nist guerrillas in the past have been reluctant
to attack Americans, fearing a wider escala
tion of their insurgency might risk drawing in
American forces on the side of the govern
ment.
The last known attacks by communists
against Americans came in the mid-1970s at
Subic Bay Naval Station.
Some observers noted that right-wing mili
tary rebels have been active in an area near
the air force base, and they suggested the at
tacks on the Americans may have been per
petrated by right-wing soldiers trying to
blame the communists and to destabilize the
Aquino government.
