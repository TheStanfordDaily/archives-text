# Reagan says arms pact possible

WEST POINT, N.Y. — Presi
dent Reagan said yesterday that
he would welcome a visit to the
United States by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, but that a
summit conference "is not a
precondition for progress" on
the superpowers' arms control
agenda.
Reagan, described by aides as
taking care not to raise expecta
tions about a summit in the wake
of earlier disappointments, said,
"When the general secretary is
ready to visit the United States, I
and the American people will
welcome him."
The president spoke to the
corps of cadets at the U.S. Mili
tary Academy, several hours
after the White House and the
Soviet Union formally an
nounced that Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
would meet Reagan Tomorrow.
The White House meeting will
take place one week after U.S.-
Soviet negotiations intended to
lead to a summit appeared to hit a
snag in Moscow over continued
Soviet insistence that limits be
imposed on space weapons, in
cluding the United States' Strate
gic Defense Initiative missile

defense system.
The White House announce
ment said that the Soviet foreign
minister would make "a brief
working visit" beginning Tomor
row, that he was expected to
carry a letter from Gorbachev to
Reagan, and that the talks would
continue those that Shev
ardnadze and Secretary of State
George Shultz held last week in
Moscow and last month in Wash
ington.
White House officials say they
feel that Gorbachev may have re
emphasized his interest last week
in obtaining limits on SDI as a
last-ditch gamble, hoping that the
president's domestic political
problems would entice him to ac
cept the restrictions in exchange
for a summit conference and
completion of a treaty eliminat
ing U.S. and Soviet medium- and
short-range nuclear weapons.
"Shultz and the president
slammed the door on that very
quickly," said an administration
arms-control expert, speculating
that the U.S. reaction has led to
"a retrenchment in progress" in
Moscow.
Now, he said, the Soviets ap
pear ready to put arms control ef

forts and progress toward a sum
mit "back on track," leading to
some optimism that dates for a
summit conference can be set
during the Shevardnadze visit.
Before Gorbachev raised the
space weapons issue Tomorrow
in Moscow, White House offi
cials had spoken about the possi
bility that the Soviet leader
would visit the United States
during late November. The presi
dent said at a news conference
barely 12 hours before the Mos
cow talks ended that he wanted
to play host to Gorbachev at his
ranch northwest of Santa Bar
bara, Calif.
Reagan, speaking yesterday to
more than 4(XM) cadets, said that
"summits can be useful for
leaders and for nations — occa
sions for frank talk and a bridge
to better relations. It would be
good for Mr. Gorbachev to see
this country for himself.
"I am ready to continue and
intensify our negotiations but a
summit is not a precondition for
progress on the agenda at hand,"
Reagan said.
Reagan told the cadets that
Shultz's meetings in Moscow
produced "important positive

movement toward an INF agree
ment," referring to a pact to
eliminate medium- and short
range nuclear weapons, which
are known as the Intermediate
Nuclear Force, and also made
progress in other areas.
In addition, "much progress
has been made in reaching ac
cord on our proposal of cutting
strategic arsenals in half," he
said. Strategic weapons are long
range systems capable of striking
targets at ranges greater than
about 3000 miles from the
launch-point.
Indeed, the president said, the
U.S.-Soviet arms control efforts
"may soon be yielding historic
results."
But, he said, "The Soviets
must . . . stop holding strategic
offensive reductions hostage to
measures that would cripple our
SDI — particularly since the
Soviets are already spending bil
lions on a strategic defense pro
gram of their own."
At the same time, the president
insisted that the United States
would not retreat from its com
mitment to maintain tactical, or
battlefield, nuclear weapons.
