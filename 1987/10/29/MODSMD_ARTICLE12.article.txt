# Expert: Soviets have space station edge
## 
### Elizabeth Howton Staff writer 
The Soviet Union is far ahead of the
United States in developing space sta
tions, a leading expert on space technol
ogy said here last night, hut the United
States can easily catch up if the "national
will" is behind the effort.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Peter
Banks, chair of the University's NASA
Advisory Committee and director of Star
lab, spoke about "Living in Space" to
about 50 students in Terman Auditorium
last night.
Banks discussed the development of in
habited space stations by the Soviet Union
and contrasted them with proposed U.S.
designs.
The Soviets put Salyut 1, their first
space station, into orbit in 1971. Salyuts II
through VII were more refined versions of
that station. Banks said. The stations drew
on military technology and were first used
primarily for military purposes, but in
recent years their uses have included civil
ian space experiments as well.
The successor to the Salyut series is the
Mir space station, which is currently in or
bit. "Mir" means "peace" in Russian,
and Banks pointed out that the Mir is basi
cally similar to the Salyut series and that
its naming was politically motivated.

Banks said the Mir is highly visible in the
night sky as a bright, fast-moving object.
Although the United States has moved
much more slowly into the area of in
habited space stations. Banks said "it's all
do-able; it isn't a question of technology,
it's a question of national will. . , . Do we
want to do it?"
Banks said he feels that barring any
funding problems, the United States could
have a space station fully operational with
eight astronauts by 1997.
Banks also said the U.S. space stations
would have more reliable power sources
than the Soviet satellites, which have had
difficulties with their solar panels. The
entire cost of the proposed U.S. space sta
tion and its auxiliary systems is about $35
billion.
According to Banks, the Challenger dis
aster of January, 19K6, has left the capabil
ity of space shuttles to transport people to
and from the station in doubt, and since
April, 1986, there has been political
"turbulence" surrounding the space sta
tion program.
Banks said the Soviets use their cos
monauts differently than Americans use
astronauts. The Soviet Union has had cos
monauts living in its space stations for as
long as 11 months without returning to
earth.
