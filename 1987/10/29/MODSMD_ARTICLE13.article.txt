Feminism in the Middle East dif
fers from feminism in the West be
cause of the two regions' sharply
contrasting cultures, a Middle East
ern feminist scholar said in a speech
at the Law School yesterday.
Nilufar Cagatay, a Turkish econo
mist who received her degrees from
Stanford, warned against a "stylistic,
simplistic view" of women in the
Middle East and provided some
models for thinking about Middle
Eastern feminism and its relationship
to feminism in the United States.
Cagatay discussed how women of
ten find themselves outside the main
stream, the "authenticity" of their

cultures, because authenticity is
defined from the dominant male per
spective. This puts women in a con
tusing relationship to their cultures,
she said.
"|We| have been grappling with
the question [of] the particulars
within the universal and the universal
within the particular, and especially
trying to get a dialogue among the
particulars (of different cultures),"
she said.
To illustrate how opposing forces
have shaped Middle Eastern
feminism, Cagatay presented several
examples of "binary oppositions."
These oppositions "pose real politi
cal dilemmas of immediate ex
pediency" for Middle Eastern

women, she said.
Cagatay first spoke of political op
position — which became cultural
opposition — between East and
West. In the West, she said, this op
position led to the idea of
"Orientalism," the designation of the
East as everything that the West was
not.
Women have been used as "the
field of confrontation," Cagatay said,
in an ideological battle between the
West and East over their respective
cultures. Westerners have argued
their culture is "more advanced" be
cause they treat women better.
However, Cagatay argued that
women in both cultures are faced
with a dilemma: Should they defend

their culture — even though they are
not fulfilled within it — or should
they criticize it and appear to "side
with the enemy?"
Cagatay next spoke of the opposi
tion between "the individual and the
collective. In Middle Eastern soci
eties . . . the process of individuation
has not taken place to the same ex
tent" as in the Western "civil soci
ety," Cagatay said.
This creates problems for femin
ism. she explained. "Feminism as we
know it today (in the West) is an ex
tension of equality to the female citi
zen," said Cagatay, noting that in the
Middle East, feminism is viewed dif
ferently.
