# Res Ed buys AIDS play seals

In an unprecedented move, the Office of Resi
dential Education has purchased tickets for a
controversial Drama Department play and is of
fering them to student living groups at a sizable
discount in order to encourage students to attend
the performance.
The play, Larry Kramer s "The Normal
Heart," deals with the controversial subjects of
AIDS and homosexual relationships. First
produced in April, 1985, at the New York Shake
speare Festival, Kramer's play immediately
became the subject of heated debate, according
to producer Edward Isser.
Res Ed purchased 400 tickets — buying out
the final dress rehearsal on Nov. 3 as well as the
opening performance on Nov. 9, according to
Asst. Dean of Residential Education Jim
Cadena. Res Ed will make the tickets available
to students for $2 each, half off the $4 regular
student ticket price.
"The Normal Heart," set in 1981, examines
the attempts of a gay lobbyists' organization to
draw attention to the emerging AIDS epidemic,
a subject Cadena said may be discomforting to
some people. "I think some people will be
turned off," he said.
AIDS "is a hard subject for people to deal
with," he said, "but I think people have to deal
with this now."
Cadena said Res Ed decided to buy out the
two performances because "this kind of piece is
different — it has a definite message. I'm inter
ested in theater that pushes people, that presents
a problem to deal with."
Isser agreed that the production is unusual and
possibly controversial, but "only because a
central aspect is the gay relationship and I've
decided not to cut corners.
"Students will go to a friend and say, 'Isn't
that that play about [gays]?' " Isser said. He
added that he hoped word-of-mouth would
overcome students' initial reluctance to see the
production.
Isser said he thought the action by Res Ed was
"consistent with its aims of educating stu
dents," especially regarding important issues
like AIDS.
"You don't educate them (in the classroom) to
have them die of stupidity," Isser said.
