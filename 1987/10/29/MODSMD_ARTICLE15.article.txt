## The
						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Support grape boycott 
### 
MEChA, a Stanford Chicano student group, is
urging University Food Service not to purchase
or serve table grapes. MEChA's effort to start a
grape boycott at Stanford is part of a larger
statewide grape boycott organized by the United
Farm Workers Union, which claims that pes
ticides used in the cultivation of table grapes
cause cancer among farmworkers.
Evidence from studies conducted by the U.S.
General Accounting Office indicate that the
UFW's concern about pesticide-related health
problems is well-founded. According to reports
issued by the GAO in 1986, 44 percent of the
pesticides used on grapes had potential human
health hazards that could not be detected by lab
oratory tests being used to check for residues.
The reports also stated that data concerning
the toxicity of certain pesticides was falsified by
a private laboratory contracted to conduct tests

for the Environmental Protection Agency.
Clearly, public pressure is necessary to halt
the use of such harmful pesticides, and a boycott
is one such method of bringing pressure to bear
on grape growers.
University Food Service, however, has
refused to stop buying and serving table grapes.
Food Service will continue to buy and serve
grapes until students stop eating them, according
to Keith Guy, director of Housing and Food Ser
vice. The University "can t be boycotting a
product to make a statement," Guy said.
This is wrong. Stanford, as a university, has a
special obligation to make positive statements
for justice in society. Given Stanford's pre
eminent position in the grape-growing state of
California, that obligation is even more pressing.
University Food Service should take a stand;
it should boycott grapes.
