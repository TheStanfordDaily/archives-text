# Sex imagery paints perverse portrait of reality
## 
### 
Don't tell me this hasn't happened to
you. You're at the dentist's office,
sinking into the fake leather couch next
to the fish tank, already keyed up for the
moment when the hygienist will come
smilingly to yank you through the door.
To assuage some of your worst fears,
you grab a magazine for a little distrac
tion. Once in your hands, the pages im
mediately fall open to an advertisement.

Oh God, not Calvin Klein's Obsession
again.
1 know what I do. I thrash wildly with
the pages, Hipping desperately for
recipes, letters to the editor, home main
tenance tips — anything to avoid what's
been staring me in the face. I hope no
one's been watching me. I hope no one
can read my mind.
But I'm not without a discreet finger
marking that section. I'll return for an
other peek when I'm positive no one's
looking.
Advertising isn't safe anymore. I
mean, we've got tangled nudes in murky
blue half-light, resting from their Obses
sions, full-length shots of shapely legs
and curving thighs when the ad is simply
for shoes, and photos such as the back
view of a naked woman stretched across

two pages, the italics of her claim
screaming at us, "Little or nothing:
CAROL LITTLE. ... Or 1 won't get
dressed."
Such images and insinuations we
don't forget easily, and you know adver
tisers hope our memory of them will sell
their product. And our experiences with
sexuality in ads become less and less
shocking — though no less invigorating
— as they flood the market. Advertising,
along with most forms of American
media today, reflects the gradual aban
donment of America's puritanical values
for sex and sexuality.
America's Scarlet Letter complex
lightens up to face the fact that lots of
people think about sex. Anyone who's
ever condemned Mick Jagger for his
swaying hips and pelvic thrusts is point
ing at the wrong perpetrator. The "evil"
has been in us all along; only now do we
feel more societal freedom in expressing
it.
Which 1 happen to think is great. It's
time we recognize sexuality as natural,
ever-present on our minds and really
kind of nice. Ads such as Calvin Klein's
for men's toiletries — the one with all
the male and female nudes in various
positions, curves accented — are clas
sics. I'm reminded of Greek statues, ap
preciative of the beauty of the human
form.
Bruce Weber, the mastermind behind
those ads, explains that his intention
isn't to make his pictures sexy. "Calvin
just wanted to show beautiful bodies,
and that's what we did. The minute
somebody I photograph starts to 'do'
sexy, I'm not interested anymore. What

I like is when the person I'm
photographing is not aware of his or her
beauty, when there's sort of a wild in
nocence."
Then again, it's ironic how that in
nocence Weber says he's capturing of
ten inspires nothing akin to that in most
viewers. Sexuality causes various sorts
of covert actions in people, or else they
wouldn't graciously cover Playboy for
us, and 1 wouldn't freak out at the den
tist's (then again I could be an early
American prude).
I know why I sometimes cringe at
sexuality in advertising. Certain adver
tisements often ignore the responsibili
ties that come with being more "open"
toward sexuality and run rampant with
expressing some of our seamier desires.
Ads circulate to many people, and when
they tell a lot of people that perversity is
neat, or that there's only one standard
for sexuality, our values are hurting.
After all, we buy this stuff. What the
people want, they get in their advertis
ing.
Take the Guess? jeans ads. Please ex
plain to me why girls in ripped clothing,
thrusting themselves mindlessly into the
camera and shadowed by a dark figure of
a man placing his hands wherever he
pleases, should be sexual.
In the Georges Marciano clothing ads,
young women perch like pampered dolls
on the laps of men 30 years their senior.
My personal favorite is the one in which
a woman kneels before the shoe and
pants leg of an unseen man and looks up
at him obediently, worshipfully. This is
an ad for clothing? This is positive
sexuality?

Xavier Moreau on the Guess? ad cam
paign shrugs: "Americans are so square.
Those pictures aren't just sexy, they're
seductive, they're outrageous! Sex sells.
That's a secret? In Europe, we've
known about that for a long, long time.''
Take a long, long European tour,
Xavier. For that matter, stay there.
These ads glorify power and exploita
tion, not sexuality. It's what some critics
call "soft-core porn," and like pornogra
phy in any degree, someone's being
used.
Perhaps we say we're not brain
washed into thinking that a leash is ne
cessary for this evening's date, but
someone is trying to convince us how to
be sexy. Ads like these stress false ideals
for ourselves and our relationships: You
can't be sexy unless you're like the
people on this page. This is a general
problem for all kinds of advertising —
the pressure to be like the Beautiful
People, just by wearing this deodorant,
using this fragrance, sporting this cloth
ing.
Ads can warp your self-esteem, sneak
into your subconscious, convince you
that sexy is pursed lips and ragged cloth

ing for women and Soloflex chests and
rugged eyebrows for men. "No Ramses,
no sex. I mean it," declares the woman
in the Ramses condom ad. She's in some
vague spaghetti-strap contraption,
propositioning the camera with her
mouth enticingly open.
Is this the look heterosexual Stanford
women are supposed to give their lovers
when they send them back to The Store?
Perhaps it would send him running, but
should I feel inadequate if I can't muster
such a pose? I know it's stupid, I tell
myself that it's all very stupid, but I've
been inundated since adolescence vsjith
propaganda on what it is to be sexy.
Books, movies, peers and now advertis
ing are in on the game. Well, at least I'm
waking up to their strategy.
Waiting at the hairdresser's the other
day, I managed to cope with Obsession
and Georges Marciano all in one sitting.
But you don't count on articles like
"Twenty Ways to a Torrid Sex Life."
Hell, what could I do? 1 took it home.
