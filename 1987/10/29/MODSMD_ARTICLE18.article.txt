## Secular humanism's war on God 
### 
At the conclusion of the recent Bork nomi
nation affair. Senator Joe Biden (D-Del.) said
that our rights are not a gift of the govern
ment (as Judge Bork may have contended),
but rather a gift from God. It is strange that
the Senator even mentions God at all in an
age when Christian values are so markedly
absent from our governmental processes.

Does Biden really believe God has given us
the "right" to ban school prayers? Has God
given us the right to engage in abortion,
homosexuality and pornography? Has God
given us the right to privacy? (Does not God
see all of our "private" actions?) Has God
given us the right to be taught relativistic
values instead of Christ's commandments in
the schools? Clearly, we cannot ascribe any
of these "rights" to the Christian God.
Indeed, God gives us no rights at all! Instead,
we are given the gift of life through His love
for mankind.
Perhaps Biden meant to say that God has
given us laws to obey (i.e., responsibilities,
not rights). Unfortunately, though, he found
himself trapped in that traditional liberal
malaise: concentrating mainly on man's
rights and ignoring the biblical stress on
man's responsibility to obey God in this fal
len world. Ultimately, this is why his state
ment makes no sense.
Where, then, have such liberal rights come
from? Sadly, these rights derive from fallen
man's rejection of God and his subsequent
embracing of the secular humanist world
view. Humanism, as opposed to human
itarianism, means man beginning from him
self with no values outside of himself.
Clearly, there can be no common ground
between humanism and the Christian world
view. The humanist world view finds reality
in a purely material world, totally devoid of
any value system, whereas the Christian
world view finds reality in the belief that man
is created to be a worshiping being who is
faced with absolute right and wrong. Indeed,
secular humanism is a root cause of

America's current state of spiritual starva
tion, for in essence humanism is the negation
of the worship of God.
These "rights," then, derive from govern
ment's conscious or unconscious decision
over the past 80 years to jettison clear Chris
tian values from the basis of law. Man's arbi
trary values are all that remain after rebellion
against God's law. Committed humanists
(militant atheists) are the ultimate product of
the European Enlightenment, which in reality
was a spiritual Endarkenment.
Has America become a land of committed
secular humanists? Have media, govern
ment, business, technology, education and,
in fact, some of our "churches" collectively
succumbed to this spiritually decadent world
view? Happily, such a culture is not yet pre
dominant; there is still a Christian "mem
ory," although it is ebbing away at enormous
speed.
Secular humanist attitudes have insidiously
permeated an American society very taken
with the idea that mankind alone can create a
better America, a better world and finally
perhaps even a global Utopia. Although we
are certainly commanded to love and to help
our neighbors, secular humanist thinkers for
get that Christ did not promise such an
earthly paradise. His message was uncondi
tionally simple: love and obey God.
The battle being waged against Christ in
America is being fought on two fronts:
Secular humanism is attacking from within,
and communism is our external foe (with
well-positioned advance guards already
here). The Lord's Prayer asks that God will
deliver us from the Evil One; clearly the Evil
One is amongst us in his disguises of secular
humanism and communism.
Communism, like secular humanism,
promises a material, worldly paradise. Yet
communists have already murdered more of
their own people (60-100 million) than might
perish in a nuclear war.
Christ warned us to beware of wolves in
sheep's clothing. Communists throughout the
world have succeeded in deceiving the public
of their true nature. Consistently, they have
conducted their revolutions against God un

der the "acceptable" guise of progressive
movements committed to social justice,
colonial liberation and global Utopia.
Yet the most persistent goal of communism
— its very essence — is the destruction of re
ligion. President Reagan's description of the
Soviets as an evil empire is quite true.
The parallels between the twin evils of
communism and humanism are too evident
for us to miss. Although humanism doesn't
draw man away from God as overtly as the
brutally systematic methods of communism,
America is being undermined subtly and al
most imperceptibly from within by a largely
humanistic ethos. Surely, the spirit of An
tichrist reigns in the materialistic world views
of humanism and communism.

Secular humanist attitudes have
insidiously permeated an Amer
ican society very taken with the
idea that mankind alone can
create a better America, a bet
ter world and finally perhaps
even a global Utopia.

The outlook for America may he grim, but
it is far from hopeless. The first step toward
victory in any battle is to recognize one's
enemy. Dr. Ratibor Jurjevich writes that
Christian Fortress America can withstand the
assaults of liberal humanism and communism
through genuine spiritual renewal (a return to
a God-centered way of life) and through ef
fective military deterrence.
Americans would do well to recall Church
ill's words after Chamberlain signed the
Munich Pact in 193H: "This is only the first
sip, the first foretaste of a bitter cup that will
be proffered to us year after year unless, by a
supreme recovery of moral health and martial
vigor, we arise again and take our stand for
freedom as in olden times."
It may very well be later than we think.
