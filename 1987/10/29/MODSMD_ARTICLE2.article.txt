# Groups criticize W. Culture plans
## Amendment submitted at forum 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
At an open forum held last
night by the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies, the Black
Student Union presented an
ASSU-backed amendment to the
Western Culture Task Force's
proposed changes to the Area
One requirement under consider
ation by the committee.
In its amendment, the BSU
states that it "strongly supports
the philosophy" and the "evo
lutionary vision" of the task
force's recommendations, but
that the proposal requires a
"more concrete foundation."
The amendment also calls for
active recruitment of qualified
minority faculty for the program
and more specific guidelines con
cerning the power of the Area
One Committee.
Also speaking in favor of the

BSU proposal were representa
tives of MEChA, the Chicano
student organization; the Asian
American Students Association;
and Stanford Union for a Demo
cratic Education, a coalition of
several student groups.
The ASSU approved the
amendments at its Tuesday
meeting.
Other important issues raised
at the forum, held in Cubberley
Auditorium, included the exis
tence of a core list of reading ma
terials for the tracks and the ne
cessity of minority faculty to
teach in the program.
Students, faculty and staff
spoke in favor of and against the
task force's proposal.

Chace said the necessary
"genuine passion" for teaching
the new Western Culture does
not exist and that "very few fac
ulty members are for the new leg
islation."
Junior Marc Pizarro empha
sized the alienation felt by some
students in the present Western
Culture program.
"It is annoying and conde
scending for professors to be dic
tating what should be in courses
that they (the professors) do not
have to take," he said.
Asst. Director of Residential
Education Keith Archuleta said
Stanford should "face the reality
that the U.S. is not a European
nation and that it is a great dis
service to education to ignore
that fact."
Bill King, BSU chair, said stu
dents are asking the CUS to take
"a really close look at what
makes up our (American) cul
ture."
According to CUS member

John Perry, the proposal "fo
cuses on the Stanford student
body, whose roots are not neces
sarily in Europe.
"This is not a world culture re
quirement but a reflection of the
components of American soci
ety," he said.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
argued for a core list of required
reading to encourage a "common
directive in all tracks" amid con
cerns from many individuals in
attendance that a core list would
lead to "tokenism" of non-
European writers.
The BSU asked that the final
draft of the legislation be pre
sented to the Faculty Senate at
the senate's December meeting.
The CUS will meet next Wed
nesday to discuss input from the
forum.
According to CUS chair Craig
Heller, "It'll be a while before
we sift through all the opinions,
but we will keep moving."
Heller described the present
debates over the proposal as a
matter of great "sensitivity on
the part of both students and pro
fessors."
Some faculty and students are
planning to meet Monday in
hopes of resolving some of the
controversy surrounding the
debate.
