# Groups criticize W. Culture plans
## Amendment submitted at forum 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
At an open forum held last
night by the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies, the Black
Student Union presented an
ASSU-backed amendment to the
Western Culture Task Force's
proposed changes to the Area
One requirement under consider
ation by the committee.
In its amendment, the BSU
states that it "strongly supports
the philosophy" and the "evo
lutionary vision" of the task
force's recommendations, but
that the proposal requires a
"more concrete foundation."
The amendment also calls for
active recruitment of qualified
minority faculty for the program
and more specific guidelines con
cerning the power of the Area
One Committee.
Also speaking in favor of the

BSU proposal were representa
tives of MEChA, the Chicano
student organization; the Asian
American Students Association;
and Stanford Union for a Demo
cratic Education, a coalition of
several student groups.
The ASSU approved the
amendments at its Tuesday
meeting.
Other important issues raised
at the forum, held in Cubberley
Auditorium, included the exis
tence of a core list of reading ma
terials for the tracks and the ne
cessity of minority faculty to
teach in the program.
Students, faculty and staff
spoke in favor of and against the
task force's proposal.
Vice Provost and English Prof.
William Chace discussed the
"mild sense of depression and in
evitability" felt by faculty mem

One requirement.
