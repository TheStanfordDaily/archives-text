Visiting the Stanford Recycling
Center can be a bit of a shock.
Located on Pampas Lane near
University Food Services, Stan
ford's student-run recycling pro
gram consists of a fenced-in lot
full of, well . . . stuff.
Accustomed as one becomes
to the measured green grass and
pavement of most of the Stanford
campus, a casual visitor is struck
by the huge, chaotic piles of
recyclables, as well as by the
run-down trailer and shacks that
house the University's Recycling
Center.
Upon closer examination,
though, some organization is evi
dent amid the center's clutter.
The compound's neat arrange
ment of unwanted items is
evocative not of a dump, but of a
junkyard, where thousands of
things await rediscovery.
Near the entrance is the "bike
graveyard," where hundreds of
discarded rims, frames and tires
await scavenging by the Stanford
community.
The center also has its own
"store," a long wall lined with
household items, books and
other white elephants; visitors
may browse and take anything of
use to them. Excepting dish
washers and mattresses, Recy
cling Director Mary Poxon said
visitors can also leave behind
items they can no longer use.

Then there are the barrels,
hundreds of them, like bright
green soldiers lined up in rows,
waiting to be emptied and
shuttled back to their posts all
over campus.
Every day, all over campus,
students, faculty and staff mem
bers overflow the barrels with

recyclable trash, which Recy
cling Center workers bring back
to the yard to be sorted and sold
to private recycling companies.
Last year the barrels brought
in 1200 tons of trash, six percent
of all the waste produced at Stan
ford .
The idea for the Stanford recy

cling program came from a
SWOPSI class in 1977, as an ac
tion project to provide alterna
tive means of waste disposal.
In 1975, the Recycling Center
became an ASSU project, ena
