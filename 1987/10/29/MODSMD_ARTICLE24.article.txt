Visiting the Stanford Recycling
Center can be a bit of a shock.
Located on Pampas Lane near
University Food Services, Stan
ford's student-run recycling pro
gram consists of a fenced-in lot
full of, well . . . stuff.
Accustomed as one becomes
to the measured green grass and
pavement of most of the Stanford
campus, a casual visitor is struck
by the huge, chaotic piles of
recyclables, as well as by the
run-down trailer and shacks that
house the University's Recycling
Center.
Upon closer examination,
though, some organization is evi
dent amid the center's clutter.
The compound's neat arrange
ment of unwanted items is
evocative not of a dump, but of a
junkyard, where thousands of
things await rediscovery.
Near the entrance is the "bike
graveyard," where hundreds of
discarded rims, frames and tires
await scavenging by the Stanford
community.
The center also has its own
"store," a long wall lined with
household items, books and
other white elephants; visitors
may browse and take anything of
use to them. Excepting dish
washers and mattresses, Recy
cling Director Mary Poxon said
visitors can also leave behind
items they can no longer use.

Then there are the barrels,
hundreds of them, like bright
green soldiers lined up in rows,
waiting to be emptied and
shuttled back to their posts all
over campus.
Every day, all over campus,
students, faculty and staff mem
bers overflow the barrels with

recyclable trash, which Recy
cling Center workers bring back
to the yard to be sorted and sold
to private recycling companies.
Last year the barrels brought
in 1200 tons of trash, six percent
of all the waste produced at Stan
ford .
The idea for the Stanford recy

cling program came from a
SWOPSI class in 1977, as an ac
tion project to provide alterna
tive means of waste disposal.
In 1975, the Recycling Center
became an ASSU project, ena
bling those who ran it to buy a

truck, a cardboard bailing ma
chine and about eight green bar
rels. The University chipped in
by giving the Recycling Center a
rent-free lease on its present lot.
Compared with Stanford Recy
cling's current efforts, the work
done in its first year was a drop in
the bucket.
Today, the group owns more
than 8()0 barrels that are distrib
uted to almost every building on
campus. Along with cardboard,
the Recycling Center now
recycles newspaper, office
paper, computer paper, cans and
bottles. Four trucks, instead of
one, now deliver the barrels
home to the Recycling Center
headquarters.
Because of the Recycling Cen
ter's increasing size, two years
ago the University increased its
support for the program. The
University now subsidizes Stan
ford Recycling by paying for
every ton of waste the Recycling
Center removes from campus.
Last year, this subsidy came to
20 percent of the Recycling Cen
ter's $90,000 annual operating
budget. The other 80 percent is
paid for by selling waste to recy
cling companies.
One reason for the Univer
sity's greater interest in the proj
ect is the status of the Palo Alto
landfill, where most of the Uni
versity's trash ends up.
Although the deadline was
recently extended, the landfill

was scheduled to close in 1991,
leaving the University with no al
ternate place to put its garbage.
"The University has realized
that they have a trash problem
approaching crisis proportions,
so now they're willing to put
money into [Stanford Recycling!
for expansion," Poxon said.
Barb Voss, assistant director of
the Recycling Center, and Poxon
said they hope to help solve the
waste problem by expanding to
handle 15 percent of the Univer
sity's waste. Part of the increase
would come from recycling office
and computer paper, which the
Recycling Center recently
started handling.

'The University has
realized that they have
a trash problem ap
proaching crisis pro
portions.'

Another innovation would in
volve placing a greater number of
individual barrels, intended for
collecting specific kinds of trash,
in each building.
This would cut down the cost
and time of separating different
kinds of recyclables. In a few
years, if recycling grows as
planned, the Recycling Center's
directors hope to move to a
larger location.
One of the many problems the
Recycling Center encounters are
barrels that become filled with
non-recyclable trash. When

people neglect to separate trash
according to the specifications
marked on the barrels, the time
and cost of sorting barrels drains
the Recycling Center s re
sources, according to Voss and
Poxon.
"The key to the operation,'
Voss said, "is convenience."
The green barrels, which are
often closer to buildings than
dumpsters are, seem to be con
venient so far, but Voss and
Poxon said they would like to
make it even easier for Stanford
to recycle, perhaps by giving
people boxes for use inside build
ings.
The two organizers also said
they realize the need for commu
nity awareness. Both empha
sized the need for recycling to be
institutionalized under student
decision-making. "We want to
encourage people to develop
their own systems of recycling,"
Poxon said.
To this end, Recycling Center
representatives go to house
meetings to give educational
slideshows and movies about the
program.
Stanford Recycling now em
ploys almost 20 people, nearly all
of whom, including the manage
ment personnel, are students.
The experience of successfully
managing a large project like the
Recycling Center is the most re
warding aspect of the program
for its directors. And it's some
thing they want to keep doing.
"All our directors have gone
on to work in recycling compan
ies," Poxon said. "And I'm
next."
