# Small diet change brings big benefits
## High-fiber diet helps fight disease 
### Lydia Selling Staff writer 
Dietary fiber can help lower
cholesterol, decrease the in
cidence of constipation, assist
in the prevention of colon and
other chronic diseases and
may even aid in weight con
trol.

Yet despite its proven
benefits, the average Ameri
can consumes remarkably
little fiber each day.
Dietary fiber is a mixture of
complex carbohydrates, called
polysaccharides, and is
available in plants, fruits and
vegetables. It is the portion of
plant food that one can eat but
is unable to digest.
Research into the properties
of dietary fiber has intensified

over the past decade. Dietary
fiber has been touted as pos
sibly lowering the incidence of
colon cancer and other
chronic diseases.
In 1975, researchers at
tempted to determine why
conditions like appendicitis,
colon cancer, diverticular
disease, gallstones and is
chemic heart disease (caused
by lack of blood flow to the
heart) were so prevalent in
developed countries and com
paratively rare in less
developed nations. They
theorized that the difference
was a reflection of the fiber
content between the diets of
the two populations.
It was found that dietary fi
ber intake in less-developed
countries, such as Mexico and
Africa, is as high as 60 to 90
grams per day, while in the
United States it averages less
than 25 grams per day. Al
though researchers failed to
establish a cause-and-effect
relationship, they definitely

found a correlation between a
high-fiber diet and the reduced
incidence of disease.
More recent scientific evi
dence has attempted to link
reduced colon cancer rates with
increased fiber intake. Though
the evidence of the existence of
such a link has been conflicting,
it gains more support all the time.
The evidence of fiber's
benefits is more defined in other
areas. Dr. James Anderson, pro
fessor of medicine at the Univer
sity of Kentucky, said, "It seems
clear that a prudent diet,
generous in dietary fiber from
food sources or as a supplement,
can have a very important role in
the management of diabetes and,
perhaps, in hypercholesterolemia
(high blood cholesterol levels)."
Through its impact on serum
cholesterol, such a diet may sig
nificantly reduce the risk of at
herosclerosis, or hardening of
the heart's arteries. Health or
ganizations now form a consen
sus in their recommendations:
The most effective diet for
chronic disease prevention is
liberal in complex carbo
hydrates, like starches, and fiber,
and is limited in fat.
Though Anderson noted that
fiber can help decrease serum
cholesterol levels, he added a ca
veat. The lowering effect is lim
ited to certain types of fiber —
the type from oats and beans.
Fibers like wheat bran will not

produce the same health benefit.
L)r. Sidney Phillips, director of
the gastroenterology unit at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., stated in a 1987 nutri
tional symposium that "the
delayed gastric emptying of fiber
containing meals may be impor
tant in terms of satiety. By pro
viding an increased sense of full
ness, fiber may aid in limiting the
intake of additional calories."
In a nutshell, fiber may also
help a person lose weight by al
lowing one to control one's appe
tite.

drates, like starches,

While many foods contain fi
ber, whole wheat bread, bran
cereals, grains and nuts are par
ticularly good sources. Raw
vegetables and fruits, while con
taining some fiber, have a very
high water content that makes
them inadequate substitutes for
raw bran.
It should be noted, however,
that cereals including the word
"bran" in their names do not
necessarily ensure an adequate
fiber supplement. Unprocessed

bran is perhaps the most reliable
source of fiber.
Consuming unprocessed bran
is an inexpensive and convenient
way to increase your fiber intake.
Bran is not habit-forming and
acts as a bulk laxative. Because
of this, it adds mass to the stool
and also increases its water con
tent, which in turn increases
stool passage. Bran consumption
should be accompanied by an ad
equate fluid intake — at least five
glasses of water a day.
Another side benefit is that a
high-fiber diet can reduce the
need for laxatives. Americans
spent almost $250 million on lax
ative products last year.
Allergies to bran are quite rare,
though bran consumption may
cause an increase in intestinal
gas. In 85 percent of patients,
however, this effect disappears
after three weeks.
Miller's Bran is a popular form
of unprocessed bran and is
available in local markets, in
cluding Safeway.
Doctors recommend that a per
son's diet contain at least 30 to 40
grams of dietary fiber every day.
The easiest way to get enough fi
ber is to mix two tablespoons of
unprocessed bran with breakfast
cereal, juice, milk, casseroles,
pancakes, graham crackers with
milk or whatever else strikes
one's fancy. Using this method,
30 grams of fiber can be obtained
without eating any other food
during the day.
Following this procedure, one
can reap the benefits of a high
fiber diet without much self
sacrifice.

after three weeks.
Miller's Bran is a popular form
of unprocessed bran and is
available in local markets, in
cluding Safeway.
Doctors recommend that a per
son's diet contain at least 30 to 40
grams of dietary fiber every day.
The easiest way to get enough fi
ber is to mix two tablespoons of
unprocessed bran with breakfast
cereal, juice, milk, casseroles,
pancakes, graham crackers with
milk or whatever else strikes
one's fancy. Using this method,
30 grams of fiber can be obtained
without eating any other food
during the day.
Following this procedure, one
can reap the benefits of a high
fiber diet without much self
sacrifice.
Dietary fiber can help lower
cholesterol, decrease the in
cidence of constipation, assist
in the prevention of colon and
other chronic diseases and
may even aid in weight con
trol.

Yet despite its proven
benefits, the average Ameri
can consumes remarkably
little fiber each day.
Dietary fiber is a mixture of
complex carbohydrates, called
polysaccharides, and is
available in plants, fruits and
vegetables. It is the portion of
plant food that one can eat but
is unable to digest.
Research into the properties
of dietary fiber has intensified

over the past decade. Dietary
fiber has been touted as pos
sibly lowering the incidence of
colon cancer and other
chronic diseases.
In 1975, researchers at
tempted to determine why
conditions like appendicitis,
colon cancer, diverticular
disease, gallstones and is
chemic heart disease (caused
by lack of blood flow to the
heart) were so prevalent in
developed countries and com
paratively rare in less
developed nations. They
theorized that the difference
was a reflection of the fiber
content between the diets of
the two populations.
It was found that dietary fi
ber intake in less-developed
countries, such as Mexico and
Africa, is as high as 60 to 90
grams per day, while in the
United States it averages less
than 25 grams per day. Al
though researchers failed to
establish a cause-and-effect
relationship, they definitely

found a correlation between a
high-fiber diet and the reduced
incidence of disease.
More recent scientific evi
dence has attempted to link
reduced colon cancer rates with
increased fiber intake. Though
the evidence of the existence of
such a link has been conflicting,
it gains more support all the time.
The evidence of fiber's
benefits is more defined in other
areas. Dr. James Anderson, pro
fessor of medicine at the Univer
sity of Kentucky, said, "It seems
clear that a prudent diet,
generous in dietary fiber from
food sources or as a supplement,
can have a very important role in
the management of diabetes and,
perhaps, in hypercholesterolemia
(high blood cholesterol levels)."
Through its impact on serum
cholesterol, such a diet may sig
nificantly reduce the risk of at
herosclerosis, or hardening of
the heart's arteries. Health or
ganizations now form a consen
sus in their recommendations:
The most effective diet for
chronic disease prevention is
liberal in complex carbo
hydrates, like starches, and fiber,
and is limited in fat.
Though Anderson noted that
fiber can help decrease serum
cholesterol levels, he added a ca
veat. The lowering effect is lim
ited to certain types of fiber —
the type from oats and beans.
Fibers like wheat bran will not

produce the same health benefit.
L)r. Sidney Phillips, director of
the gastroenterology unit at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., stated in a 1987 nutri
tional symposium that "the
delayed gastric emptying of fiber
containing meals may be impor
tant in terms of satiety. By pro
viding an increased sense of full
ness, fiber may aid in limiting the
intake of additional calories."
In a nutshell, fiber may also
help a person lose weight by al
lowing one to control one's appe
tite.

While many foods contain fi
ber, whole wheat bread, bran
cereals, grains and nuts are par
ticularly good sources. Raw
vegetables and fruits, while con
taining some fiber, have a very
high water content that makes
them inadequate substitutes for
raw bran.
It should be noted, however,
that cereals including the word
"bran" in their names do not
necessarily ensure an adequate
fiber supplement. Unprocessed

bran is perhaps the most reliable
source of fiber.
Consuming unprocessed bran
is an inexpensive and convenient
way to increase your fiber intake.
Bran is not habit-forming and
acts as a bulk laxative. Because
of this, it adds mass to the stool
and also increases its water con
tent, which in turn increases
stool passage. Bran consumption
should be accompanied by an ad
equate fluid intake — at least five
glasses of water a day.
Another side benefit is that a
high-fiber diet can reduce the
need for laxatives. Americans
spent almost $250 million on lax
ative products last year.
Allergies to bran are quite rare,
though bran consumption may
cause an increase in intestinal
gas. In 85 percent of patients,
however, this effect disappears
after three weeks.
