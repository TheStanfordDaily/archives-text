Yet despite its proven

Dietary fiber is a mixture of
complex carbohydrates, called
polysaccharides, and is
available in plants, fruits and
vegetables. It is the portion of
plant food that one can eat but
is unable to digest.
Research into the properties
of dietary fiber has intensified

over the past decade. Dietary
fiber has been touted as pos

colon cancer and other
chronic diseases.
In 1975, researchers at
tempted to determine why
conditions like appendicitis,
colon cancer, diverticular
disease, gallstones and is
chemic heart disease (caused
by lack of blood flow to the
heart) were so prevalent in
developed countries and com
paratively rare in less
developed nations. They
theorized that the difference

content between the diets of
the two populations.
It was found that dietary fi

countries, such as Mexico and
Africa, is as high as 60 to 90
grams per day, while in the

than 25 grams per day. Al

relationship, they definitely
