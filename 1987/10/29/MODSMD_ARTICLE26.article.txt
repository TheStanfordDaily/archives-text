# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM
## 
### 
Brown bags 'em at Yale
You know the scene. You're on your
way out of Green Library and you have
to wait on line to have your bag checked.
Then, finally, someone who is being paid
six bucks an hour gives your bag nothing
more than a cursory glance.
You walk out realizing you probably
could've stolen a small anthology, or at
least a couple of paperbacks.
If you think Green's security is lax,
though, try Yale's Cross Campus Li
brary while Eleanor Brown is working
there. Brown checks bags on the way
out and on the way in. But, if she is to be
taken at her word, she may as well not
be there at all.
"I try to make it easy on the stu
dents," Brown said. "They can hold
[their bags] open themselves."
Brown's first commandment of bag

checking is: Thou shalt never place thy
hand inside the bag of another. "If you
do you'll get it with a smashed rotten
banana, or an open can of yogurt," she
said.
Oh, by the way, Brown reports that
she is paid barely more than minimum
wage. Anybody need a copy of the En
cyclopedia Britannica?
Also in New Haven. . . .
In 1985, there was a'inajor strike at
Yale. Local 35, the union for all campus
workers, walked off the job. For stu
dents at the Ivy-covered institution, it
was a living hell.
This time around, though, its students
in the union who are raising hell. Stu
dents work part-time but are required to
pay the same monthly dues as full-time
workers and they're not happy about it.

A smaller, but vocal, group of students
is also demanding a say in union matters.
Union leaders aren't budging. They
claim that students have not shown a
sense of responsibility to Local 35 and.
until they do, they should keep their
opinions to themselves, according to a
report in the Yale Daily News.
Could you repeat that?
Have you ever been in a class and had
trouble understanding what the TA was
saying? Do you find yourself wishing
you could bring a translator to section?
If so, think about transferring to a school
in Illinois.
A new state law there requires all
public college and university instructors
to be proficient in English, and it's get
ting mixed reviews.
Administrators fear charges of dis

crimination and a decrease in foreign en
rollment. James Kahn, acting assistant
dean of the graduate school at the Uni
versity of Illinois at Chicago said, "We
treasure the diversity of our student
body and complying with the state law
could give us enrollment problems."
Not surprisingly, students think it's
terrific. Dave Duschene, a senior at
Northern Illinois University, enthusias
tically supports the idea. "1 ended up
getting C's instead of As in my calculus
class because 1 couldn't understand my
TA," he said.
Try writing that on your business
school application.
The party may he over
Brown University, the Ivy League
school with the lowest credit require
ment for graduation, is considering stric

ter requirements.
Currently, students need only take 28
courses over four years to graduate.
That amounts to one 4-class semester
and one 3-class semester per year. At
Yale, students have a 4-class semester
and a 5-class semester each year.
Students at the Providence, R. 1.,
"country club" are divided on the issue.
An informal poll found that half oppose
the change and half are in favor.
Brown sophomore David Gjjeenson
said that students there use the extraf
time to pursue educational independent,
projects that they wouldn'i have time for
if they were in class.
He added that the current policy al
lows students to fail courses in one se
mester and then make them up later.
If that's not reason enough to keep
things the same, what is?

Brown bags 'em at Yale
You know the scene. You're on your
way out of Green Library and you have
to wait on line to have your bag checked.
Then, finally, someone who is being paid
six bucks an hour gives your bag nothing
more than a cursory glance.
You walk out realizing you probably
could've stolen a small anthology, or at
least a couple of paperbacks.
If you think Green's security is lax,
though, try Yale's Cross Campus Li
brary while Eleanor Brown is working
there. Brown checks bags on the way
out and on the way in. But, if she is to be
taken at her word, she may as well not
be there at all.
"I try to make it easy on the stu
dents," Brown said. "They can hold
[their bags] open themselves."
Brown's first commandment of bag

checking is: Thou shalt never place thy
hand inside the bag of another. "If you
do you'll get it with a smashed rotten
banana, or an open can of yogurt," she
said.
Oh, by the way, Brown reports that
she is paid barely more than minimum
wage. Anybody need a copy of the En
cyclopedia Britannica?
Also in New Haven. . . .
In 1985, there was a'inajor strike at
Yale. Local 35, the union for all campus
workers, walked off the job. For stu
dents at the Ivy-covered institution, it
was a living hell.
This time around, though, its students
in the union who are raising hell. Stu
dents work part-time but are required to
pay the same monthly dues as full-time
workers and they're not happy about it.

A smaller, but vocal, group of students
is also demanding a say in union matters.
Union leaders aren't budging. They
claim that students have not shown a
sense of responsibility to Local 35 and.
until they do, they should keep their
opinions to themselves, according to a
report in the Yale Daily News.
Could you repeat that?
Have you ever been in a class and had
trouble understanding what the TA was
saying? Do you find yourself wishing
you could bring a translator to section?
If so, think about transferring to a school
in Illinois.
A new state law there requires all
public college and university instructors
to be proficient in English, and it's get
ting mixed reviews.
Administrators fear charges of dis

crimination and a decrease in foreign en
rollment. James Kahn, acting assistant
dean of the graduate school at the Uni
versity of Illinois at Chicago said, "We
treasure the diversity of our student
body and complying with the state law
could give us enrollment problems."
Not surprisingly, students think it's
terrific. Dave Duschene, a senior at
Northern Illinois University, enthusias
tically supports the idea. "1 ended up
getting C's instead of As in my calculus
class because 1 couldn't understand my
TA," he said.
Try writing that on your business
school application.
The party may he over
Brown University, the Ivy League
school with the lowest credit require
ment for graduation, is considering stric

ter requirements.
Currently, students need only take 28
courses over four years to graduate.
That amounts to one 4-class semester
and one 3-class semester per year. At
Yale, students have a 4-class semester
and a 5-class semester each year.
Students at the Providence, R. 1.,
"country club" are divided on the issue.
An informal poll found that half oppose
the change and half are in favor.
Brown sophomore David Gjjeenson
said that students there use the extraf
time to pursue educational independent,
projects that they wouldn'i have time for
if they were in class.
He added that the current policy al
lows students to fail courses in one se
mester and then make them up later.
If that's not reason enough to keep
things the same, what is?
