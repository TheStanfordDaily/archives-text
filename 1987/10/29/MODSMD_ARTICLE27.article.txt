## Satisfying a sweet-tooth at the Stanford mall 
### Susan Stellin Ceri Jones 
Something about rain makes a red
head long for chocolate. Unable to con
centrate any longer on the history of
Tudor England, we set out to explore a
mecca for even the most discriminating
of candy connoisseurs — the Stanford
Shopping Center.
Armed with only a map of the mall and
a letter of introduction, we — Rusty and
Billi — attempted to discover in one af
ternoon just where among the boutiques
the best cure for a nagging sweet tooth
could be found.
Neiman- Marcus Epicure Shop
Our initial stop brought us more than
we bargained for. Billi knew she was
bound to be impressed by a store that
had the word "epicure" printed on its
designer bags.
As we stood in awe of our surround
ings, an aproned employee bearing a sil
ver platter of amaretto cookies invited
us to sample freely. She was followed by
a similar apparition offering delicate
chocolate squares. Bins of chocolate and
caramel-covered popcorn were at our
disposal. This was going to be easier
than we had imagined.
For our test we were advised to
sample from the brownie case and chose
macadamia, hazelnut, pecan and
"Double Decadence."
Cocolat
We spent less time at our second stop.
A small shop located on the corner next
to Benetton, Cocolat exudes a distinctly
European flavor. Decorated with
Parisian posters, mirrors and glass
fixtures, the store struck us as being a
giant display case that directed our at
tention toward the chocolate delicacies
hidden inside.
We had no problem discovering the
best treat Cocolat had to offer. From the
array of truffles, cakes, cookies and
candies, we were immediately supplied
with a bittersweet chocolate brownie

and an elegant bag of chocolate-covered
almonds.
Ethel M. Chocolates
Located next to the Street Market, Et
hel M. Chocolates is perhaps the best
kept secret among the mall's sweet
shops. A store done in pastel shades of
blue and pink, the elegant effect was
magnified by soft lighting and the curved
glass of its display cases.
Billi was most impressed by the neat
labels identifying the contents of the
shiny colored wrappings — Vienna
crunch, Bordeaux butter cream and
cherries jubilee. We left with an 8-ounce
box of samples, eagerly anticipating its
delights.
Sweet Dreams
In contrast to our first three experi
ences of international grandeur, our
fourth stop brought us back to the shores
of America. A trendy gift shop/candy
store. Sweet Dreams offers novelties
ranging from stuffed toys, cards and cof
fee mugs to Halloween decorations, jelly
beans and truffles.
Rusty got right to business, quickly
finding her way to the wooden display
case that housed an assortment of
beautifully decorated truffles. A helpful
employee pointed out the option of large
truffles or smaller ones "for those who
feel they just can t indulge quite as
much."
Our purpose being indulgence, we left
with two of the larger size: Grand Choc
olate Chip and Root Beer Float.
See's Candies
This time Rusty was transported back
to her youth, remembering trips with
Grandma to the black-and-white tiled
store. From the portrait of Mrs. See
hanging behind the counter to the white
smocks and black bows of the
employees, See's is proof that "some
things never change."
Billi was intrigued by the creative
nomenclature, noting such names as

Mayfair, Chelsea, Normandie, Divinity
and Mint Krispy. Our guide offered us
two truffles, cafe au lait and orange
chocolate, though Billi left wondering
just what a Chelsea would have tasted
like.
La Baguette
Adding a different twist to our jour
ney, La Baguette once again took us to
the other side of the Atlantic, this time to
a French bakery. Greeted by the smell of
freshly baked bread emanating from the
back ovens, we crossed the brick floor
to examine the goods.
La Baguette offers an array of crois
sants, as well as brioche, danish, fruit
tarts and other pastries. We were invited
to sample a French pecan roll, a custard
porte-feuille and a custard bateau. Rusty
was distressed to find that the bateau
contained raisins, although she was
pleased to discover an equally attractive
non-raisin alternative.
McDonald's
Rusty insisted that the trip to the mall
would not be complete without a stop at
America's favorite fast-food restaurant
for a box of McDonald Land cookies.
The choice between the regular and
chocolate chip cookies was almost over
whelming. but we finally decided on the
regular, animal cracker-like cookies in a
Fry Guy box.
La Foret
Our final stop was another French
pastry shop, located next to the Street
Market on Azmoor Place. The atmos
phere was more than welcoming as we
were waited on by the owner and two
clerks. However, a dispute arose as to
which employee would pick out some
thing for us to sample.
It was easily resolved by the sugges
tion that we try whatever we wanted,
and one clerk urged the owner to "think
of it as an investment." Unbelievably
enough, we were beyond the desire to
take advantage of this generous offer

and limited ourselves to a chocolate chip
pumpkin cookie and a beautifully
decorated slice of strawberry shortcake.
So . . . where should we start? Should
we eat everything at once or spread it
out? Should we eat all of the brownies
together or intersperse them with
truffles? Should we eat 47 pieces of
candy/brownies/cookies/truffles all by
ourselves or enlist the taste buds of
neighbors and friends? Should we
donate OUR leftovers to the residents of
American Studies House? Would we
live to regret the whole adventure?
Somehow we managed to taste every
thing. Of course, it was all "good,"
though some confections inevitably
reigned supreme. In the brownie cate

gory, Billi chose the "Double
Decadence" from Neiman-Marcus,
while Rusty insisted that Cocolat s bit
tersweet chocolate brownie with wal
nuts was obviously superior.
When it came to truffles, Rusty was
the obvious connoisseur. She expressed
a preference for the aesthetically pleas
ing See s cafe au lait, as did most of the
group. Always fond of surprises, Billi
said her number one favorite was the as
sortment of chocolates from Ethel M.
Chocolates — she liked trying every one
to see which had caramel inside.
Sweets made with pumpkin were not
an overwhelming favorite, or as one
taster professed, "gourds and chocolate
