## Card crushes USIU 3-1 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The Soaring Gulls proved easy
prey for the struggling Stanford
men's soccer team yesterday at
Maloney Field.
Showing midseason form, the
Cardinal easily defeated U.S. In
ternational University 3-1. After
going winless in its past four con
tests, the squad once again
showed the talent that led it to
four straight upsets of nationally
ranked teams at the beginning of
October. The victory raised
Stanford's record to 8-7-3 over
all. The team remains 2-1 in the
Pacific Soccer Conference.
"It was a much needed win,"
Stanford Coach Sam Koch said
of yesterday's victory.
The Cardinal took control of

the match right from the start.
For the first time since the
ATT/Pacific West Soccer Clas
sic, Oct. 10-11, Stanford played
with intensity in the first half as
well as the second period. It was
also the first time since the tour
nament that the Cardinal led at
halftime.
Stanford's first goal came 22
minutes into the game, when for
ward/midfielder Brian Mahaffey
scored on a pass from midfielder
Pat Sheehy. After USIU's Perola
Lindkuist tied the score at 1-1,
Sheehy gave the Cardinal the
lead for good with seven minutes
remaining in the first half.
Junior midfielder Juan Garcia
gave the Cardinal a security goal
IS minutes into the final period.
It was Garcia's first strike of the
year. Fullback Tim Westergren

was credited with assists on each
of the final two goals.
Although the score remained
close for most of the contest, the
Cardinal dominated the game
even more than the score indi
cated. Stanford completely con
trolled the pace of the match,
keeping the ball in Soaring Gull
territory for a large percentage of
each half. The Cardinal outshot
USIU 15-7 and missed several
close scoring attempts that could
have widened the score even
more.
Despite yesterday's wet and
muddy conditions, Stanford ef
fectively carried out its offensive
strategy. The squad, for the first
time in a number of matches,
worked efficiently as a team.
