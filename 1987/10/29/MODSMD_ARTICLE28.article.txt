## Card crushes USIU 3-1 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The Soaring Gulls proved easy
prey for the struggling Stanford
men's soccer team yesterday at
Maloney Field.
Showing midseason form, the
Cardinal easily defeated U.S. In
ternational University 3-1. After
going winless in its past four con
tests, the squad once again
showed the talent that led it to
four straight upsets of nationally
ranked teams at the beginning of
October. The victory raised
Stanford's record to 8-7-3 over
all. The team remains 2-1 in the
Pacific Soccer Conference.
"It was a much needed win,"
Stanford Coach Sam Koch said
of yesterday's victory.
The Cardinal took control of

the match right from the start.
For the first time since the
ATT/Pacific West Soccer Clas
sic, Oct. 10-11, Stanford played
with intensity in the first half as
well as the second period. It was
also the first time since the tour
nament that the Cardinal led at
halftime.
Stanford's first goal came 22
minutes into the game, when for
ward/midfielder Brian Mahaffey
scored on a pass from midfielder
Pat Sheehy. After USIU's Perola
Lindkuist tied the score at 1-1,
Sheehy gave the Cardinal the
lead for good with seven minutes
remaining in the first half.
Junior midfielder Juan Garcia
gave the Cardinal a security goal
IS minutes into the final period.
It was Garcia's first strike of the
year. Fullback Tim Westergren

was credited with assists on each
of the final two goals.
Although the score remained
close for most of the contest, the
Cardinal dominated the game
even more than the score indi
cated. Stanford completely con
trolled the pace of the match,
keeping the ball in Soaring Gull
territory for a large percentage of
each half. The Cardinal outshot
USIU 15-7 and missed several
close scoring attempts that could
have widened the score even
more.
Despite yesterday's wet and
muddy conditions, Stanford ef
fectively carried out its offensive
strategy. The squad, for the first
time in a number of matches,
worked efficiently as a team.

completing a large percentage of
its passes and outmaneuvering
the USIU players. The results
reflected that teamwork.
"We finally got it together and
worked as a unit," Garcia said.
When the Soaring Gulls did
manage to penetrate into Cardi
nal territory, the defense also
showed its early-season form.
Goalie Chris Helling had another
outstanding day, saving the few
difficult shots taken in routine
fashion.
The rain and slippery condi
tions affected both squads, but
Stanford adjusted better to the
foul weather. While USIU did
not seem able to control the ball,
misfiring several passes and
losing out in one-on-one situa
tions, the Cardinal took advan
tage of the muddy conditions and
kept the Gulls off balance.
The dramatic shift in game per
formance came after the Cardinal
had a number of soul-searching
sessions in which the team dis
cussed its goals and the season,
including past successes and fu
ture matches, according to Koch.
"Many were doubting us,"
Koch said. "We wanted to prove
that our four victories (over
ranked squads) weren't flukes
and that we are for real."
The Cardinal now heads into
its final three games of the
season, all league matches. Stan
