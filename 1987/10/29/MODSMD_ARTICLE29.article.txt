# The 						team everyone loves to hate
## 
### 
The dreaded Business
School's all-university intra
mural championship reign ended
last year.
Please take a moment to savor
that sentence.

It doesn't really matter who
defeated the Biz School teams
(Roble Hall did the honors);
what's important is that some
body did.
Going into last year, the Biz
School had won the title two
straight years and three out of the
last four.
In the process the Biz athletes
developed a rather "hostile repu
tation" here on the Farm.
Now the victors from Roble
are throwing that reputation right
back in the Biz School's face.
Robleites are wearing T-shirts
that feature a huge fist crushing
the word "BIZ."
Thus a rivalry is born.
Actually, the Roble shirts are
serving to inspire, rather than
draw the ire of, the Biz School.
"I think the shirts are great,"
Biz School 1M coordinator
Susannah Robins said. "It gives
credibility to our being psyched
— gives us a little bit of fuel."
Earlier this month Robins
wrote an article in the Biz School
newspaper with a headline that
read: "IMs looking to crush
Roble." In the article. Robins
asserted that her fellow future
yuppies indeed have a "hostile
reputation."
Tuesday Robins explained
why. "We have a lot of great ath
letes who have gotten back on
the field and refound their com
petitive instincts," she said.
"Remember, these are competi
tive people to start out with.
We're also bigger than most un
dergraduate teams."
University IM coordinator
Charlie Montoya agrees that the

Biz School players aren't that
popular.
"Just attitude wise, they're ag
gressive. Scheduling, referees,
phone calls — they're always on
the ball, which helps us (the IM
office)," Montoya said. "But on
the field I try to tell my referees
that it's not the rule but the spirit
of the rule that's important. For
Biz School individuals it's the
rule."
The Biz athletes are to some
extent getting a bad rap. Sure,
they are often obnoxious, and
they want to win at all costs. But
in the world of sports we always
need a team to hate, and any
team that consists of people who
continuously wear shirts and ties
to classes and dream of driving
Honda Preludes with four-wheel
steering and cellular telephones
— well, it's easy to make these
people objects of bloodlust.
Of course it's also easy to
detest a perennial winner.
"They're getting the same
amount of hostility as anyone
who has been on top for so
long," Greg DeForest, one of
this year's Roble IM coordina
tors, said. "It's switched around
now that we (Roble) are on top."

'We have a lot of great
athletes who have
gotten back on the field
and refound their
competitive instincts.
Remember, these are
competitive people.'

So, can Roble stay on top?
"Roble is all over the place
this year," Robins said. "It'll be
tough for us (Biz School) to
win."
DeForest agrees. He said that
Roble is doing better than it did
last year at this time. "It looks
like we should be able to beat
them again," he said. "We're off
to a good start, and if they (Biz)
don't look out they could find
themselves in trouble."
Pretty cocky words. Senior

Erik Lou, who was a Ruble IM
coordinator during last year s
victorious campaign, is much
more skeptical.
"Roble can win again, but they
won't," Lou said. "There's a let
down from last year, and they
lost a lot of key people. Plus Biz
School will be hungrier."
Montoya thinks Roble can do
it again. "I think they can repeat,
although they had a couple of
people last year who were really
into sports, which helps,' he
said. "The Biz School has al
ready forfeited a couple of vol
leyball matches, which is rare."
The buzzword at the beginning
of the quarter was that Roble and
the Biz School were meeting in
an inordinate amount of first
round matches. Montoya said
that was pure coincidence.
Eventually, however, Roble
and Biz School teams are going
to square off in some important
matches. I'd like to see if the
Roble squads have the guts to
wear those shirts.
In addition, one of the Roble
resident fellows, Evan Porteus,
also teaches at the Biz School.
He has one of those shirts, but
does he wear it? He's out of
town, unable to be reached for
comment. Shucks.

Roble." In the article. Robins
asserted that her fellow future
yuppies indeed have a "hostile
reputation."
Tuesday Robins explained
why. "We have a lot of great ath
letes who have gotten back on
the field and refound their com
petitive instincts," she said.
"Remember, these are competi
tive people to start out with.
We're also bigger than most un
dergraduate teams."
University IM coordinator
Charlie Montoya agrees that the

Biz School players aren't that
popular.
"Just attitude wise, they're ag
gressive. Scheduling, referees,
phone calls — they're always on
the ball, which helps us (the IM
office)," Montoya said. "But on
the field I try to tell my referees
that it's not the rule but the spirit
of the rule that's important. For
Biz School individuals it's the
rule."
The Biz athletes are to some
extent getting a bad rap. Sure,
they are often obnoxious, and
they want to win at all costs. But
in the world of sports we always
need a team to hate, and any
team that consists of people who
continuously wear shirts and ties
to classes and dream of driving
Honda Preludes with four-wheel
steering and cellular telephones
— well, it's easy to make these
people objects of bloodlust.
Of course it's also easy to
detest a perennial winner.
"They're getting the same
amount of hostility as anyone
who has been on top for so
long," Greg DeForest, one of
this year's Roble IM coordina
tors, said. "It's switched around
now that we (Roble) are on top."

'We have a lot of great
athletes who have
gotten back on the field
and refound their
competitive instincts.
Remember, these are
competitive people.'

So, can Roble stay on top?
"Roble is all over the place
this year," Robins said. "It'll be
tough for us (Biz School) to
win."
DeForest agrees. He said that
Roble is doing better than it did
last year at this time. "It looks
like we should be able to beat
them again," he said. "We're off
to a good start, and if they (Biz)
don't look out they could find
themselves in trouble."
Pretty cocky words. Senior

Erik Lou, who was a Ruble IM
coordinator during last year s
victorious campaign, is much
more skeptical.
"Roble can win again, but they
won't," Lou said. "There's a let
down from last year, and they
lost a lot of key people. Plus Biz
School will be hungrier."
Montoya thinks Roble can do
it again. "I think they can repeat,
although they had a couple of
people last year who were really
into sports, which helps,' he
said. "The Biz School has al
ready forfeited a couple of vol
leyball matches, which is rare."
The buzzword at the beginning
of the quarter was that Roble and
the Biz School were meeting in
an inordinate amount of first
round matches. Montoya said
that was pure coincidence.
Eventually, however, Roble
and Biz School teams are going
to square off in some important
matches. I'd like to see if the
Roble squads have the guts to
wear those shirts.
In addition, one of the Roble
resident fellows, Evan Porteus,
also teaches at the Biz School.
He has one of those shirts, but
does he wear it? He's out of
town, unable to be reached for
comment. Shucks.

After defeating the Business
School in competition for the over
all IM championship last year,
Koble Hall printed T-shirts (this is
the logo on the back of the shirt) to
commemorate the occasion.
The dreaded Business
School's all-university intra
mural championship reign ended
last year.
Please take a moment to savor
that sentence.

It doesn't really matter who
defeated the Biz School teams
(Roble Hall did the honors);
what's important is that some
body did.
Going into last year, the Biz
School had won the title two
straight years and three out of the
last four.
In the process the Biz athletes
developed a rather "hostile repu
tation" here on the Farm.
Now the victors from Roble
are throwing that reputation right
back in the Biz School's face.
Robleites are wearing T-shirts
that feature a huge fist crushing
the word "BIZ."
Thus a rivalry is born.
Actually, the Roble shirts are
serving to inspire, rather than
draw the ire of, the Biz School.
"I think the shirts are great,"
Biz School 1M coordinator
Susannah Robins said. "It gives
credibility to our being psyched
— gives us a little bit of fuel."
Earlier this month Robins
wrote an article in the Biz School
newspaper with a headline that
read: "IMs looking to crush
Roble." In the article. Robins
asserted that her fellow future
yuppies indeed have a "hostile
reputation."
