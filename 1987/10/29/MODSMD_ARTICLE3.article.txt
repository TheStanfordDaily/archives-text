# Alum makes Supreme Court short list
## 
### Lori Silver Editorial staff 
A Stanford alumnus who has two
children currently enrolled here is
believed to be at the top of President
Reagan's list of potential nominees to
the U.S. Supreme Court.
Anthony Kennedy, who earned his
bachelor's degree in political science
here in 1958, is leading a list of candi
dates for a seat created by the resig
nation of Justice Lewis Powell, the
San Francisco Examiner reported
yesterday.
Kennedy's two children — Greg, a
senior, and Kristen, a sophomore —
were both excited about their father's
prospects, Kennedy's oldest son,
Justin, graduated from Stanford in
1986.
"We're thrilled about it. There's

been talk here and there, but it never
has been as concrete as it has been in
the past few days," Greg Kennedy
said.
Currently a judge on the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals, Kennedy
was appointed to his seat by Presi
dent Gerald Ford in 1975.
. Emeritus Political Science Prof.
Robert Horn, who taught Kennedy as
an undergraduate and has followed
his career, described him as an
"outstanding" judge who is well
respected for his ability on the circuit
court.
Kennedy "thinks of himself as a
conservative because he certainly is a
judge who believes in judicial self
restraint. He is not an activist," Horn
said.
If Kennedy is nominated,
however, Horn predicted "there

won't be a repetition of the Bork
hearings."
"The Senate won't have as much
to question him about as they did on
Judge Bork," Horn said, noting that
Kennedy has not published nearly as
many legal papers as Bork did. He
added that this is not unusual because
Kennedy teaches law on only a part
time basis.
Horn said he hopes Kennedy will
decline to provide complete answers
to questions posed at the confirma
tion hearings instead of following
Bork's policy of answering all ques
tions fully, which Horn said was poor
strategy.
"1 might suggest that to him as his
old professor," Horn said.
Kristen Kennedy said she was ini
tially surprised to hear that her father
was under consideration. "But then I

think about how hard he works," she
said. "It's really a great honor just to
have his name brought up.
"He is my best friend. With me, he
was always so fair," she said. "1
can't think of a greater person to be
deciding issues."
Kristen characterized her father as
a "really intellectual, really
reachable, touchable person."
"He's not intimidating. He always
treats everyone the same — he's
never condescending," she said.
Horn called Kennedy "highly in
telligent and scholarly' with a very
even temperament.
Both Greg and Kristen said they
would like to attend law school,
citing their father as an important in
fluence. Greg is an English major,
and Kristen is planning to double
major in English and history.
