# Field hockey edged 1-0 in OT
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
Unless you're as fortunate as the
Minnesota Twins, it seems as though
your dreams must eventually come to
an end.
So it was yesterday with Stanford's
13th-ranked field hockey team. The
squad fell 1-0 in overtime to No. 20 San
Jose State, thus ending the Cardinal's
quest for an undefeated league record.
The loss dropped Stanford to 5-1 in the
Northern Pacific Conference and 9-5
overall.
The shutout marked the second time
in five days that the Cardinal has been
undone by the Spartans. Ironically, the
score in the teams' last meeting was
also 1-0.
"San Jose was real psyched to
play," Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson
said. "They played a real aggressive
game and deserved to win."
As is becoming the norm in Cardinal
defeats, it seemed to be the failure to
knock the ball in the goal that did the
team in."I thought we had some good
chances to score," Johnson said. "We
just didn't take advantage of them."
Freshman midfielder Patricia McJen
nett agreed. "We played a really good
passing game," she said, "but we

weren't ever able to score. There were
a lot of good things about our game,
though."
Indeed there were. The Cardinal
played another outstanding defensive
game, limiting the Spartans to only
nine shots. One of the keys to that ef
fort was junior goalie Karen Jones,
who made seven saves.
"Karen played a real good game,"
Johnson said. "Even on the one goal
they scored, Karen made a great save
before they poked in the rebound."
Junior forward Kat Thomas also had
another excellent game. She played ag
gressively, which has become her
trademark since she recovered from
the ankle injury that hobbled her early
in the year. "Kat had some really close
chances," Johnson said.
Lone Stanford senior Ami Chitwood
played a solid game as well. She took
the SJSU opponent she was marking
completely out of the game, Johnson
said.
The victory improved San Jose's
conference record to 4-1-1 and pulled
the Spartans within a half game of
Stanford with two games remaining on
each team's schedule. The Cardinal
still has to play California and Chico
State, while the Spartans have Cal and
Pacific left.

Stanford still has its fate in its own
hands, however, as victories over the
Bears and Cougars would assure the
team of its third consecutive confer
ence title, as well as its third straight
NCAA tournament bid.
But a loss in either of the two
remaining games could be disastrous,
as San Jose State could snatch the con
ference title with wins in its final two
games. "Our girls know the pressure's
on," Johnson said. "I'm confident
they'll finish strong."
McJennett echoed the team's con
cern about looking too far ahead,
however. "We know we have Cal on
Friday and that's all we're worried
about right now," she said. "After that
game, whatever happens, we'll look to
our next match."
San Jose will play winless Pacific
this week before finishing up its season
with Cal on Nov. 7. The Spartans and
the Bears played to a 1-1 tie last time
they met.
If Stanford had won yesterday, the
team would have been looking to wrap
up the conference title Friday. Instead,
the Cardinal will try to maintain a slim
lead over San Jose State going into the
last week of the season.
