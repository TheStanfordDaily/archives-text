# Netters enter Volvo tourney
## 
### David Earnest 
The NCAA men's tennis season will
unofficially begin this weekend with
the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Champion
ships at the Los Angeles Tennis Center
at UCLA.
Sophomore All-American Jeff
Tarango and freshman David Wheaton
will represent Stanford in the tourna
ment. Senior Patrick McEnroe was se
lected to play in the tournament hut
was forced to withdraw due to a recur
ring injury.
Despite McEnroe's absence, the
tournament field includes most of the
finest players in collegiate tennis.
Thirty-two players were selected based
on last season's final individual stand
ings, geographic representation, four
at-large entries and two wild card
berths. The winner will automatically
be ranked as the nation's No. 1 player
when the official men's tennis season
begins in February.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould looks
forward to the tournament but is
guarded in predicting how well his
players will do. "We've had only two
and-a-half weeks of practice," he said.
"Other teams have been practicing
since August, and we just played our
first sets on Monday. It's an opportu
nity for us to get to know where we
stand."
"This is a great chance for the
players to get to see the competition,"
Stanford Asst. Coach John Whitlinger
said. " The guys get to see some of the
players they wouldn't normally see un
til the spring season."
Tarango, from Manhattan Beach, is

one of the nation's top returning
players. He was seeded 13th in last
spring's NCAA championships and
was ranked No. 33 nationally at the
season's end. After playing most of last
season as the Cardinal's No. 1 player,
Tarango spent his summer on the pro
circuit playing with the U.S. Davis Cup
College Team.

I want to see how I stand
with the other players
around the country. I hope
to start out this year right
at the top, so I can t take
this tournament lightly/

Wheaton was chosen to compete in
Los Angeles because of his outstanding
high school career. The freshman from
Minnetonka, Minn., is the reigning
U.S. Junior Clay Court champion and
teamed with Tarango to win the U.S.
Junior National doubles championship.
This summer, Wheaton won the
U.S. Open Junior singles title, the larg
est junior tournament in the world.
Wheaton was awarded a wild card
entry in the Los Angeles tournament
based on his summer performances.
His selection is particularly note
worthy because freshmen do not nor
mally qualify for the tournament.
McEnroe was selected having been
one of the top players in the nation last
season. Because of a continuing prob

lem with bruises on his feet, however,
he withdrew from the preseason tour
nament.
Both Wheaton and Tarango are en
thusiastic, but cautious. "I feel that I
want to prove something now that I am
in college," Wheaton said. "But I'm
not playing well right now. It's a big
tournament, but it's not like the NCAA
championship tournament."
Tarango said that it is a "look-see
tournament. "I want to see how I stand
with the other players around the
country. 1 hope to start out this year
right at the top, so I can t take this
tournament lightly," he said.
The tournament, sponsored by Volvo
and run by the Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association, is structured to
showcase the finest players in col
legiate tennis. Five of the 32 slots go to
last year's top five finishers. An addi
tional eight are designated for the top
players in the eight geographic regions
designated by the tournament's organi
zers.
Two slots are granted as wild cards,
one is selected by Volvo and the other
is selected by UCLA, which selected
Wheaton. Four slots are designated as
at-large berths, for which players com
pete in a pretournament elimination
round. The remaining spots are filled
by last season's top returning finishers.
In a similar preseason tournament,
Stanford women's tennis players Lisa
Green and Tami Whitlinger are sched
uled to compete in the USAir Ail-
American Women's National Tennis
Championship today through Sunday
at Kingston Plantation in Myrtle
Beach, S.C.

Stanford Coach Dick Gould looks
forward to the tournament but is
guarded in predicting how well his
players will do. "We've had only two
and-a-half weeks of practice," he said.
"Other teams have been practicing
since August, and we just played our
first sets on Monday. It's an opportu
nity for us to get to know where we
stand."
"This is a great chance for the
players to get to see the competition,"
Stanford Asst. Coach John Whitlinger
said. " The guys get to see some of the
players they wouldn't normally see un
til the spring season."
Tarango, from Manhattan Beach, is

one of the nation's top returning
players. He was seeded 13th in last
spring's NCAA championships and
was ranked No. 33 nationally at the
season's end. After playing most of last
season as the Cardinal's No. 1 player,
Tarango spent his summer on the pro
circuit playing with the U.S. Davis Cup
College Team.

I want to see how I stand
with the other players
around the country. I hope
to start out this year right
at the top, so I can t take
this tournament lightly/

Wheaton was chosen to compete in
Los Angeles because of his outstanding
high school career. The freshman from
Minnetonka, Minn., is the reigning
U.S. Junior Clay Court champion and
teamed with Tarango to win the U.S.
Junior National doubles championship.
This summer, Wheaton won the
U.S. Open Junior singles title, the larg
est junior tournament in the world.
Wheaton was awarded a wild card
entry in the Los Angeles tournament
based on his summer performances.
His selection is particularly note
worthy because freshmen do not nor
mally qualify for the tournament.
McEnroe was selected having been
one of the top players in the nation last
season. Because of a continuing prob

lem with bruises on his feet, however,
he withdrew from the preseason tour
nament.
Both Wheaton and Tarango are en
thusiastic, but cautious. "I feel that I
want to prove something now that I am
in college," Wheaton said. "But I'm
not playing well right now. It's a big
tournament, but it's not like the NCAA
championship tournament."
Tarango said that it is a "look-see
tournament. "I want to see how I stand
with the other players around the
country. 1 hope to start out this year
right at the top, so I can t take this
tournament lightly," he said.
The tournament, sponsored by Volvo
and run by the Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association, is structured to
showcase the finest players in col
legiate tennis. Five of the 32 slots go to
last year's top five finishers. An addi
tional eight are designated for the top
players in the eight geographic regions
designated by the tournament's organi
zers.
Two slots are granted as wild cards,
one is selected by Volvo and the other
is selected by UCLA, which selected
Wheaton. Four slots are designated as
at-large berths, for which players com
pete in a pretournament elimination
round. The remaining spots are filled
by last season's top returning finishers.
In a similar preseason tournament,
Stanford women's tennis players Lisa
Green and Tami Whitlinger are sched
uled to compete in the USAir Ail-
American Women's National Tennis
Championship today through Sunday
at Kingston Plantation in Myrtle
Beach, S.C.

Thirty-two players were selected based
on last season's final individual stand
ings, geographic representation, four
at-large entries and two wild card
berths. The winner will automatically
be ranked as the nation's No. 1 player
when the official men's tennis season
