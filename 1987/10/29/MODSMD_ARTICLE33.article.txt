# Card bows to St. Mary's
## 
### Robert Pardington Staff writer 
St. Mary's had help from the referee
and the fates yesterday as it beat the
Stanford women's soccer team here 2-0
on a rainy afternoon. The Gaels are now
15-3-1 on the year with the win. The Car
dinal dropped its fourth in a row and is 3-
10-3.
The first St. Mary's goal came as a
direct result of an official's questionable
call. Four minutes into the game, the ref
eree blew his whistle and awarded the
ball to Stanford. Seconds later, he
reversed the call and gave a free kick to
St. Mary's. The official, however, failed
to notify the Cardinal team, which had al
ready run down field.
Taking advantage of the mix-up, Gael
midfielder Kim Shelby poked the ball
past Stanford goalkeeper Elise Edwards.
The Cardinal never recovered.
"The referee was absolutely incompe
tent," Stanford Coach Berhane Andeber
han said. "He wasn't one-sided â€”just
useless."
"The official made bad calls for both
sides," junior fullback Marybeth Irwin of
St. Mary's said.
Irwin scored the Gaels' second goal in
the 37th minute of the first half, lofting a
beautiful shot into the far left corner.
"We try to create an attack from the
defense," St. Mary's Coach Randy Far
ris said. "This time, it resulted in a goal
from one of our fullbacks."
Both Stanford and St. Mary's played
better than in the teams' first meeting.
The match was physically clean, despite
the muddiness of the field.
"We always enjoy playing Stanford,"
Irwin said. "They play a clean, friendly

game."
In the second half, the Cardinal did a
good job of keeping the ball in scoring po
sition, but every shot was just off, with
several shots glancing off the crossbar.
For the game, St. Mary's outshot Stan
ford 16-8. Corner kicks were even at five
each. The Gaels made six saves, and the
Cardinal had two stops.
"We were lucky not to be scored on,
Farris said. "We eased up a little, but you
have to give Stanford credit for its deter
mination."
Farris was impressed with the develop
ment of both teams, but was especially
complimentary to the Cardinal. Although
Stanford lost the game, the players'
growth over the season was evident.
"1 have tremendous respect for Stan
ford," Farris said. "They're suffering
from inexperience more than anything.
They never give up."
St. Mary's has also improved since the
first game.
"We were really up for this game," Ir
win said. "It was really important for our
playoff chances."
Midway through the second half, play
was halted for 15 minutes when St.
Mary's player Kathy Stuckey went down
with a fractured leg. Stuckey collided
with Stanford freshman midfielder
Denise Denney and was unable to get up.
An ambulance took Stuckey to an emer
gency room, where she was operated on
last night.'
The accident marred what was other
wise a well-played game. Stanford's poor
luck continued, however, and it suffered
another frustrating loss.
"I'm going to tell my players to start
going to church more often," Andeber
han said.
