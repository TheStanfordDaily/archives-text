# Scientists let their fingers do the walking
## Diseases tracked by phone 
### Gordon S. Stephenson 
Scientists have found a new
tool to aid them in their quest to
understand genetic diseases:
the telephone directory.
Italian telephone listings
have shed new light on human
migration patterns in an effort
to trace genetic diseases, ac
cording to Prof. Luigi Cavalli-
Sforza, chair of the Medical
School's Department of Genet
ics.
Cavalli-Sforza worked with
researchers in Turin, Pavia and
Parma, Italy, to chart world
wide patterns of human genetic
diseases by tracing migratory
patterns of humans. Ten mil
lion listings from Italy's tele
phone directories were ana
lyzed to establish the geo
graphic distribution of sur
names in that country.
"Human migration is a very
complex phenomenon," Caval
li-Sforza said. "People come
and go, and very often it is not
recorded at all."
By using the computerized
listings in Italy, the new
method allows for an exact ac
count of surname distribution.
By using this information, sci
entists are able to trace genetic
diseases that are linked to cer

tain ethnic groups.
According to Cavalli-Sforza,
migration is an important factor
in determining the geographic
distribution of inherited dis
ease. For example, Mediter
ranean islands colonized by the
Greeks now have people with
one form of an inherited blood
disease, whereas present in
habitants of islands colonized
by the Phoenicians have a dif
ferent form of the disease.
By studying the migration
patterns, researchers may be
able to predict more accurately
the risk of disease in different
genetic groups. "It could also
help at the level of diagnosis in
predicting what particular
disease an individual has, given
his or her ethnic origin,"
Cavalli-Sforza said.
However, the information
available in the telephone list
ings creates some social bias,
as the directory lists pre
dominantly male surnames. To
balance the study, researchers
looked at other records.
In particular, they studied
540,000 records of consan
guineous (closely related) mar
riages that took place between
1904 and 1968. In Italy, where
98 percent of the population is
Roman Catholic, Vatican

records also proved to be use
ful in tracing migration pat
terns.
Cavalli-Sforza and his col
leagues plan to do similar proj
ects in France and Switzerland.
In France, instead of using tele
phone listings, the scientists
will study electricity bills.
"Each country has its own spe
cial situation," Cavalli-Sforza
said. "Some records are better
than others."
In China, where a majority of
the population does not own
telephones, Cavalli-Sforza and
his research team used census
records. In some cases these
records are nearly 2000 years
old and can thus provide useful
historical information on
migratory patterns.
" I he study of human migra
tion is just starting," Cavalli-
Sforza said. "It's a whole new
field."
Cavalli-Sforza has had a
longstanding interest in the dis
tribution of surnames in
populations. His work is based
partly on a theory developed by
two Stanford mathematics pro
fessors, Samuel Karlin and
James McGregor, that can be
applied to link the number of
surnames to the number of indi
viduals in a population.
