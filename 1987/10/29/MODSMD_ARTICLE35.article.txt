# Soviet: Reform U.S. labor
## 
### Susan McKean 
The labor movement in the
United States is "facing a very
drastic and serious dilemma"
and must change its organiza
tional stucture to survive, a So
viet expert on U.S. labor history
said here yesterday.
Yuri Rogulev, a professor of
history at Moscow State Univer
sity, spoke to a group of faculty
and students in the History
Lounge. He is a Fulbright
scholar-in-residence at the Uni
versity of Missouri.
Rogulev — whose area of
study is American history, spe
cifically labor history and rela
tions — noted that American
studies is a relatively new field in
the Soviet Union and that Soviet
scholars "really don't know what
the consciousness of the working
class is" in the United States.
But Rogulev said his research
here is helping him to better un
derstand U.S. labor unions. The
working-class life here is very
different from other countries, he
said, and this has a significant ef
fect on labor relations.
"The ideology of individual
ism, even among working
people, is greater here than
anywhere else," he said.
However, organized labor
must change with the changing
times, he said. It needs a new
agenda to make "serious
changes" to survive or it will
decline further, he said.
During the past few decades,

unions have suffered from a
"relative inability and even un
willingness" to respond to new
problems, he said. There is a
"necessity to change the organi
zational structure (of unions) to
be able to deal with the new sys
tem of government and eco
nomy."
It is now "impossible to deal

with large American businesses
and corporations on the principle
of individual bargaining," Rog
ulev said. He advocated the
"coalitionism" of unions, and
broadening the social base of un
ions to accomodate a changing
composition of the work force in
the face of a hostile political envi
ronment.
