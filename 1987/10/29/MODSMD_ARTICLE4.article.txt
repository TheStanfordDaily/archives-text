# Ex-diplomat blasts Reagan policy
## U.S. stand against Arias plan flawed 
### Courtenay Thompson 
The real fear of the Keagan
administration in Central
America is an independent
Nicaraguan foreign policy, not
a Nicaraguan policy alignment
with the Soviet Union and
Cuba, the former U.S. ambas
sador to El Salvador said last
night.

Robert White, who served
as ambassador in the Carter
administration, spoke to a
crowd of about 150 in Kresge
Auditorium as the final event
of Central American Educa
tion Week.
"Peace threatens to break
out in Central America," said
White, commenting on the
Arias proposal for peace in
Central America that is spon

sored by the leaders of five
Central American nations.
White called it an "excellent
plan" that the United States
should support.
"The real fear of the Reagan
administration is not that
Nicaragua will identify with
the Soviet Union and Cuba,"
he said, "but rather that the
Nicaraguans will not identify
with the Soviet Union."
The United States stands
against democracy in Central
America, White said. "The
building blocks for peaceful
change exist," he said. "The
main obstacle to peace is
Reagan's insistence on mili
tary victory in Nicaragua.
"If Nicaragua demonstrates
the ability to exercise an inde
pendent and nonaligned
foreign policy, where goes the
rationale for carrying on the
endless war in El Salvador, or
for putting U.S. bases in Hon
duras?" White asked. Some in
the crowd responded with
sympathetic laughter.
White claimed that although
the U.S. national security
issue does exist, it is not a big
concern. "The U.S. wishes to
overthrow the government of
Nicaragua, not to ensure
guarantees for our security,"
he said.
White said that the revolu
tions in Central America are
"authentic and homegrown.
"The Soviet Union and
Cuba have nothing to do with


K»I«tI White
the beginnings, and little to do
with the continued struggle," he
said.
White, who was dismissed by
President Reagan in 1980, com
plained of the difficulty of pursu
ing a moral foreign policy in
Central America."In govern
ment, you have ignorance and
knowledge," he said. "The ones
in power insist on ignorance;
those who insist on knowledge
are faced with ideological obses
sion."

In spite of a background of nu
merous human rights violations,
the United States still backs El
Salvador, White said.
"U.S. policy has immense
tolerance for slaughter in El Sal
vador" while condemning the
Sandinista government in Nic
aragua for human rights viola
tions, he said.
White called the Reagan ad
ministration a "reluctant carrier
of the human rights message."
White is president of the Inter
national Center for Development
Policy, a Washington-based
public policy group that sponsors
projects on human rights in de
veloping countries.
