# Ex-diplomat blasts Reagan policy
## U.S. stand against Arias plan flawed 
### Courtenay Thompson 
The real fear of the Keagan
administration in Central
America is an independent
Nicaraguan foreign policy, not
a Nicaraguan policy alignment
with the Soviet Union and
Cuba, the former U.S. ambas
sador to El Salvador said last
night.

Robert White, who served
as ambassador in the Carter
administration, spoke to a
crowd of about 150 in Kresge
Auditorium as the final event
of Central American Educa
tion Week.
"Peace threatens to break
out in Central America," said
White, commenting on the
Arias proposal for peace in
Central America that is spon

sored by the leaders of five
Central American nations.
White called it an "excellent
plan" that the United States
should support.
"The real fear of the Reagan
administration is not that
Nicaragua will identify with
the Soviet Union and Cuba,"
he said, "but rather that the
Nicaraguans will not identify
with the Soviet Union."
The United States stands
against democracy in Central
America, White said. "The
building blocks for peaceful
change exist," he said. "The
main obstacle to peace is
Reagan's insistence on mili
tary victory in Nicaragua.
"If Nicaragua demonstrates
the ability to exercise an inde
pendent and nonaligned
foreign policy, where goes the
rationale for carrying on the
endless war in El Salvador, or
for putting U.S. bases in Hon
duras?" White asked. Some in
the crowd responded with
sympathetic laughter.
White claimed that although
the U.S. national security
issue does exist, it is not a big
concern. "The U.S. wishes to
overthrow the government of
Nicaragua, not to ensure
guarantees for our security,"
he said.
White said that the revolu
tions in Central America are
"authentic and homegrown.
"The Soviet Union and
Cuba have nothing to do with
