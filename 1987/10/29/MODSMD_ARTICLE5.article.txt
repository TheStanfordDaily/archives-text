# Checks delayed by new regulations
## 
### Brian Rhoads Staff writer 
New U.S. government immigration and tax
regulations have caused delays in pay for
many University employees, resident assis
tants and graduate teaching assistants in the
first pay period of fall quarter.
Stanford's Payroll Ofice, which processes
about 28,(XX) checks monthly, must usually
hand-process an average of 12(H) late checks
per month, according to Payroll Manager
Maureen Mahoney.
However, in the four days since the Oct. 22
payday, "we've processed over 6(H) (checks),
and we're still cranking them out," Mahoney

said.
Much of the delay is a result of the Payroll
Office receiving late student appointment
forms — necessary to put students on the
payroll — from University departments,
Mahoney said. "We haven't got them all in
yet. They're still trickling in," she said.
According to Wendy Minkin, in charge of
processing the Hoover Institution s person
nel payroll, the delays at the departmental
level are not a question of departmental
negligence but are caused by recent imple
mentation of two government regulation
changes: The Immigration Reform and Con
trol Act. in effect since July 1, and the new
federal tax law .

The Immigration Reform and Control Act
requires that all employees produce proof of
identity, in the form of either one or two of
the following: passports with proper visas,
birth certificates, driver's licenses and social
security cards.
I he new tax law changed the requirements
for the tax-exempt status for many graduate
teaching assistants and resident assistants.
Minkin said.
According to Karlene Dickey, associate
dean of Graduate Studies, the new laws have
resulted in a tremendous amount of paper
work. ' My staff has done everything to com
plete the processing as quickly as possible."
Dickey said.
