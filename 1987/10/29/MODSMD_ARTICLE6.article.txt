Some Stanford students now watch their engi
neering classes live on television instead of going to
lectures in person.
The Stanford Instructional Television Network
(SITN), a system orginally developed for outside
industry, now also serves a segment of the Stanford
community through broadcasts on SUNet, the Uni
versity's cable network system.
Lectures from the 77 courses offered to compan
ies are broadcast live and on tape, allowing stu
dents to make up classes they may have missed, to
review classes while questions are still fresh and to
audit classes that schedule conflicts would other
wise have prohibited them from attending, SITN
officials said.
Paulina Chen, a sophomore enrolled in Industrial
Engineering 133 (Industrial Accounting), attends
live lectures on Mondays and Wednesdays, but
watches a prerecorded class on Friday.
Administrative duties prevent her instructor. En
gineering Prof, and Vice President for Development
Henry Riggs, from teaching classes more than two
days a week.
