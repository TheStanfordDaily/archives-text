# SUNet shows classes live

Some Stanford students now watch their engi
neering classes live on television instead of going to
lectures in person.
The Stanford Instructional Television Network
(SITN), a system orginally developed for outside
industry, now also serves a segment of the Stanford
community through broadcasts on SUNet, the Uni
versity's cable network system.
Lectures from the 77 courses offered to compan
ies are broadcast live and on tape, allowing stu
dents to make up classes they may have missed, to
review classes while questions are still fresh and to
audit classes that schedule conflicts would other
wise have prohibited them from attending, SITN
officials said.
Paulina Chen, a sophomore enrolled in Industrial
Engineering 133 (Industrial Accounting), attends
live lectures on Mondays and Wednesdays, but
watches a prerecorded class on Friday.
Administrative duties prevent her instructor. En
gineering Prof, and Vice President for Development
Henry Riggs, from teaching classes more than two
days a week.
"Normally on-campus stu
dents don't have to watch canned
classes unless there's a special
reason," said Robert Kincheloe,
acting director of SITN and pro
fessor emeritus of engineering.
"What really bothers me are
the TV cameras and the feeling
that other people are watching."
Chen said. "It's more inhibiting
to ask questions since it feels like
I'd be taking away from other
people's time," she added.
"I'm paying a lot of money to
be here, and part of that should
be for student-teacher interac
tion," she said. "The TV is a
good resource, but it shouldn't
substitute for lectures."
SUNet, administered by Aca
demic Information Resources,
first appeared in dormitories
during the spring of 1985. Since
then, SUNet's audience has
tripled, and most undergraduate

dorms and campus auditoriums
have been linked to SUNet.
People watching live from
company classrooms are e
quipped with microphones allow
ing them to call in comments and
questions for discussion.
Also available to companies is
Tutored Video Instruction, which
"combines the advantages of
video with the benefit of private
instruction," according to
Kincheloe.
A teaching fellow, who accom
panies the video, can stop the
prerecorded lecture at any time
and guide a discussion,
Kincheloe added. The program is
only available to a small per
centage of companies, however.
"In general, television classes
are not what I would expect from
a good undergraduate educa
tion," said Prof. Larry Cuban,
dean of academic affairs at the
School of Education. "I person
ally don't think large-scale
lectures are the best way to get
an undergraduate education
either," he added.
