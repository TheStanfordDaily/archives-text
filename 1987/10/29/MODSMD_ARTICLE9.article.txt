High Court nomination due today
WASHINGTON — President Reagan plans to announce his
new nominee for the Supreme Court today amid widespread
speculation that the nod will go to California Federal Appeals
Court Judge Anthony M. Kennedy.
Conservatives in the administration and in the Senate,
however, continued Yesterday to push for Douglas H.
Ginsburg, a federal appeals court judge here, whom they con
sider more ideologically rigorous. Ginsburg, formerly a Harvard
Law School antitrust expert, served briefly as assistant attorney
general in charge of antitrust policy before being put on the ap
peals court late last year.
Aides to Democratic senators and leaders of groups that suc
cessfully opposed the nomination of Judge Robert Bork say that
so far they have seen nothing in Kennedy's record that would
spark serious controversy. Ginsburg, however, could be highly
controversial, in part because of his age, 41, and relatively brief
judicial experience.
Reagan is scheduled to meet with Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111 and White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker Jr.
This morning and may interview both Kennedy and Ginsburg
before making a decision, sources close to the selection process
said. An announcement of the new nominee is expected this af
ternoon.
Market survives bad news, climbs
NEW YORK — Displaying remarkable resilience, the
whipsawed stock market weathered wave after wave of bad
news yesterday, especially about the falling dollar, before
finishing another volatile trading day virtually where it started.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up slightly,
0.33 points, to 1846.82, after rising 52 points Tuesday. Trading
once again was brisk. The New York Stock Exchange had its
eighth-busiest day, with 279.41 million shares changing hands.
The modest increase in the closely watched Dow gauge of
blue-chip stocks masked a 63-point nose dive at the opening and
a 108-point swing, both of which had traders and market
analysts on tenterhooks.
"A lot of people were braced for a very bad day," said Jerry
Helzner, a market strategist for the Philadelphia investment
company of Butcher & Singer. "So, for this market to end even
in the face of a very bad news backdrop and another day of
distress selling is impressive."
Like Helzner, Dreyfus & Co. market strategist Monte Gordon
thought Yesterday's market "demonstrated encouraging
resilience" and an orderliness unseen on Wall Street since the
huge Oct. 19 crash, which wiped out $50() billion of the market's
value in a single day.
Stocks opened more quickly and smoothly than they have in
days, and the fluctuations, with the exception of the 108-point
swing in the Dow, were more in check.
Students, faculty rally in S.Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — More than 17,000 stu
dents, faculty members and university staff rallied and marched
on four South African campuses yesterday, calling strict new
government controls on anti-apartheid activity a serious threat
to academic freedom and university autonomy.
"We shall not subjugate ourselves to these savage condi
tions," Prof. Phillip V. Tobias told about 6000 people gathered
in front of the University of Witwatersrand's Great Hall.
"We shall not prostitute our calling as academics to become a
spying and policing agency," he said. "We shall never cease our
struggle for autonomy and freedom, nor our determined opposi
tion to racism, apartheid and authoritarianism."
Following the rally at Witwatersrand, riot police used tear gas
to disperse about 200 students who had gathered at the univer
sity gates to sing political songs. The authorities also chased
several hundred students who left the procession and ran along
an adjacent street, chanting and waving banners. Those stu
dents quickly returned to campus. There were no reports of
serious injuries or arrests.
The protest rallies occurred simultaneously at the universities
of Cape Town, Western Cape, Natal and Witwatersrand — the
country's largest English-speaking universities. Leaders of
those universities have been highly critical of the rules, which
went into effect Oct. 19, and have vowed to challenge them in
court.
S. Korean announces candidacy
SEOUL, South Korea — Opposition leader Kim Dae Jung of
ficially — and finally — announced yesterday that he was run
ning for the presidency and disparaged the ruling party's candi
date with the remark that "only those who have a clear personal
history of democratic struggle are qualified" for the office.
He said the December election would be "a great war in
which democratic forces have declared the final decisive battle
against military dictatorship." Kim, 63, told reporters that his
party "will surely win."
Kim, who at least five times in the past two-and-a-half weeks
has said unofficially that he was in the race, acknowledged that
his candidacy could split the opposition vote against Roh Tae
Woo, since his longtime rival, Kim Young Sam, is also running.
Kim said that he still believed a single opposition candidate
could be determined later in the campaign, and he insisted that
he was the best choice for that role.
"Transcending the problem of a unified candidacy at the po
litical party level, I have now become the single candidate of the
democratic forces," he said.
States battling over census, aliens
WASHINGTON — A new "war between the states" has
erupted in Congress over fears that counting illegal aliens in the
1990 census would give California, Texas and New York addi
tional House seats at the expense of Pennsylvania, Connecticut,
Michigan, Alabama and North Carolina.
The projected "loser" states and their allies are lobbying the
Reagan administration and preparing legislation and lawsuits
aimed at excluding illegal aliens from census data that will be
used to apportion 435 House seats for the 1992 elections.
"The basic rights of representation are violated when voters
in states with a large number of illegal aliens have a greater
voice in choosing representatives in Congress," Reps. William
Good ling (R-Pa.) and Thomas Petri (R-Wis.) declared in a letter
seeking co-sponsors for a bill that would bar counting illegals.
Strong resistance to the campaign is being mounted by
"winner' state congressmen, including Rep. Mervyn Dymally
(D-Calif.) and Rep. Robert Garcia (D-N.Y.), who charged in in
terviews that racism was at work.
Dymally is chairman of both the House Census and Popula
tion Subcommittee of the Post Office and Civil Service Commit
tee and the Congressional Black Caucus. Garcia is former chair
man of both the census panel and the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus.
