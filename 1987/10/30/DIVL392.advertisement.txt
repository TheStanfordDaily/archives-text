DO YOU HAVE
MEDICAL
INSURANCE?
For the academic year starting 1987-88,
all students must have medical
insurance as criterion of registration.
For those students who purchased the
Stanford University sponsored Colonial
Life and Accident basic plan, a
catastrophic supplement is available.
SATURDAY,
OCTOBER 31
is the deadline for this academic year
to apply for this supplement.
All Dependents wishing to enroll along
with the student in either the basic or
catastrophic plans must also file their
applications by October 31.
Applications available at Cowell.
