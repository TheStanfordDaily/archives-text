Unidentified vandals dumped motor oil in the In
ner Quad and defaced the Graduate School of Busi
ness, a bus stop and walls in the Quad with blue
paint and shaving cream sometime Wednesday
night, according to Ron Parker, contracts adminis
trator for Operations, Maintenance and Utilities.
Parker said there are no leads the identity of the
vandals, but added that the damage itself — the
word "CAL" painted in blue letters — was suffi
cient evidence to believe UC-Berkeley students
were involved.
Grounds manager Larry Atwater said it was one
of the worst rivalry-related attacks "in all the years
I've been here."
According to Parker, the oil spill in the Quad may
not be related to the painted grafitti, but some con
nection between the vandalism is "more than
likely" because both incidents occurred at about
the same time Wednesday.
"lowards Big Game we start seeing this kind of
thing but it seems a little early this year," Parker
said.
Atwater agreed that it is relatively early in the fall
for such vandalism to occur. "The game is not until
Nov. 21. What kind of tension will be built up in the
meantime?" Atwater asked.
A crew was sent yesterday morning to clean up
the oil, which did not cause permanent damage, ac
cording to Parker.
"It was just dribbled down the walkway of the In
ner Quad arcade."
V ou have to wonder about people who would
do this," he said.
Two years ago, the last time Big Game was
played at Stanford, a wave of vandalism struck
campus during the week before the game. Two
statues in the Rodin Sculpture Garden were
defaced, and "Go Bears" was scrawled in white
paint on the doors of the East Room of Memorial
Church.
Vandals also painted the letters "C-A-L" in white
acrylic paint on columns in front of the Stanford
Museum.
