Reagan taps dark horse for Court
WASHINGTON — In a stunning decision. President Reagan
yesterday nominated Douglas Ginsburg, a 41-year-old conserva
tive with one year of experience as a judge, to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
"By selecting Judge Ginsburg, I've gone the extra mile to
ensure a speedy confirmation," Reagan told an audience of con
servatives in introducing his nominee at the White House. "I've
been impressed by the fact that in academia, in government and
on the bench, Judge Ginsburg has been enormously popular
with colleagues of all political persuasions."
The president, apparently signaling the focus of the adminis
tration's campaign to win Ginsburg's confirmation, said that the
judge believes that courts must take into account "not just the
rights of criminals but, equally important, the rights of the vic
tims." He added, "No one has rights when criminals are
allowed to prey on society. Judge Ginsburg understands that.
And that's why I am nominating him."
The new nominee, a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Ap
peals for the District of Columbia since Oct. 14, 1986, said in
brief remarks, "I'm looking forward to the confirmation process
and, upon confirmation, to taking a place in the court."
The choice of Ginsburg came as a surprise to many. It had
been widely believed that Reagan would nominate Judge An
thony Kennedy of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco, a more experienced jurist who was considered much
safer politically.
In the Senate, which dealt Reagan a devastating political
defeat only six days ago in rejecting the high court nomination of
Robert Bork, Ginsburg's nomination was met with suspicion
among Democrats, who control the chamber. While reserving
judgment until more is known about the candidate, many
criticized his relative lack of judicial experience.
Last year, Ginsburg's lack of experience led the American
Bar Association to give him the lowest of three possible passing
grades when he was nominated for his current seat on the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
If confirmed by the Senate, he would be the youngest justice
to sit on the Supreme Court in nearly half a century and its first
Jewish member since 1969.
U.S., Soviet decide summit agenda
MOSCOW — A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman said yes
terday that the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed
on the terms of a summit meeting to take place before the end of
the year.
Boris Pyadyshev, in a shift of terminology, said at a press
briefing that the two sides have reached "an understanding that,
together with an agreement on medium and shorter-range weap
ons, questions relating to strategic offensive weapons and the
ABM (antiballistic missile) treaty will be thoroughly dis
cussed."
"This will be sufficient to hold a summit meeting this year,"
he said.
Last week during a visit to Moscow by Secretary of State
George Shultz, the Soviets insisted on reaching agreements on
"key provisions" on strategic and space defense issues before
setting the dates for a third summit meeting between Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan.
Pyadyshev, first deputy director of the Foreign Ministry in-
fhe comments as Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze, in Prague for a meeting with Warsaw
Pact Washington for a two-day visit
to speed along an agreement "on a summit. Pyadyshev said he
did "not rule out the possibility" that dates for the Reagan-
Gorbachev meeting would be announced this weekend.

a single day ever.

start a rally finally caught fire. Traumatized over-the-counter
stocks, led by high-technology issues, had their second-best day

television in some cities or reading several major magazines and

Bush dazzles GOP voters in Iowa
CLIVE, Iowa — In this little corner of the world, Vice Presi
dent Bush hit a home run at the first Republican presidential
debate of the 1988 campaign.

said ' After seven years of loyalty, why would I criticize Reagan
now. said Carol Wise, 40, who works at a local farm
museum. "That gave me a feeling of strength in the man — that
he s willing to stand by what he's already committed to."
