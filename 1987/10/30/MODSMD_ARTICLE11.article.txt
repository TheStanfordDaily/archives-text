### Burke Smith Staff writer 
Despite public tumult raised last week by an
American missile strike on Iranian oil platforms,
there is widespread bipartisan support for U.S.
military involvement in the Persian Gulf, a
Hoover Institution research fellow said in a
speech yesterday at Bechtel International Cen
ter.
In the course of his remarks, James Noyes
also implied that Iran was primarily responsible
for instigating the Iran-Iraq war
Addressing the controversial stepping-up of
U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf, particu
larly the reflagging of Kuwaiti tankers, Noyes
said, "It's fair to assess that whoever sits down
to make military policy, whether Democrat or
Republican, will come to almost the same con
clusions."
There exists an "amazing bipartisan view of
the importance of the Gulf," Noyes said. He
added that since 1971, when the British ended
their military presence in the nations surround
ing the Persian Gulf, the U.S. has maintained a
"symbolic presence in the area."
According to Noyes, U.S. strategists hoped to
gradually improve the militaries of the countries
in the region while maintaining a U.S. "com
mittment to assist those countries in the event of
major attacks."

Noyes traced President Reagan's present
policy back to former President Jimmy Carter's
preparations for U.S. involvement in the area,
including the pre-positioning of military supplies
and lengthening of military airfields in the
region. Paraphrasing the Carter policy, he said

the former president recognized
that any threat to peace in the
Gulf would lead to some U.S. in
volvement and possibly war.
Noyes said the role of the U.S.
in the Persian Gulf is to bolster
the economies of countries that
indirectly support Iraq (such as
Kuwait) by protecting the ship
ment of oil in the Gulf. He said
the Iraqi air force, not the U.S.
Air Force, must deal with other
problems such as the Silkworm
missile placements that Iran uses
to harass shipping.
Noyes' description of the
war's outbreak concurred with
the Iraqi claim that events
preceding the invasion actually
forced Iraq to preemptively at
tack Iran.
