# Bacchetti seeks re-election
## Running for seat on Foothill-De Anza college board 
### Erik Johnson Staff writer 
Raymond Bacchetti, Stanford
vice provost for Management
and director of University
Budgets, will stand for re
election to the Foothill-De Anza
Community College board of
trustees in this Tuesday's elec
tion. Bacchetti, who is chairman
of the board, is expected to retain
his seat for a second term.
Two-term board member
Gerald Besson, a Stanford pro
fessor emeritus of internal
medicine, and Robert Smith
wick, a thirty-one year veteran of
the board, are also running for re
election.
Los Altos Hills attorney Harry
Price is the only challenger in the
election for the three seats. Bac
chetti, Besson and Smithwick all
support one another's reelection
bids.
Price's chances for victory ap
pear slim. Price admitted that he
has not attended a board meeting
this year, according to the Penin
sula Times Tribune, which ear
lier this week endorsed the re
election bids of the incumbents.

In addition, the election has
produced few issues that have
generated much controversy
among the candidates, prevent
ing Price from distinguishing
himself from the incumbents.
According to Bacchetti, the
main issues in the election are
similar to those in past elections.
"The faculty are getting older, as
they are in many schools, due to
natural aging and retirement,"
Bacchetti said. "Our challenge is
in replacing and renewing the
retiring faculty with teachers that
are just as good."
In addition, there is a growing
concern about state usurpation of
local control over the colleges.
Bacchetti said the issue of con
trol has become one of the pri
mary issues in the campaign.
"I feel that they (state govern
ment officials) might be moving
more things to state control than
is needed," Bacchetti said. "The
colleges are for the community.
They are a pair of very good col
leges, and we need room to
develop and review current ar
rangements about what can be
done. Sensible judgements can
be made at the local level."

His position as vice provost at
Stanford has given him expertise
necessary for making those
judgements, he said. I
Participating in the operatiop
of both Stanford and Foothill-De
Anza, Bacchetti has developed
opinions on the relationship be
tween the two
"Both are quality places of edif
cation, but the real question is
how they both contribute to thfc
communities they serve," Bac
chetti says. J
"One person in five in our
community is affected (by
Foothill-De Anza) each year,''
he said. "Stanford serves 13,00i)
students from around the world
every year."
Bacchetti said he believes
Foothill-De Anza is a "very
worthwhile institution that con
tributes important things to thf
area and to California."
The two members of the board
riot up for reelection this year,
Alfred Chasuk and Mary Wallace
Wheat, are supporting the reelec
tion bids of the incumbent candi
dates. Members of the board
serve four-year terms.
