## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Animals vs. science 
### 
The picture that animal rights activists paint of
animal research is one of powerful, compelling
images: panting German shepherds with their
chests open for experimental heart surgery, rats
grossly malformed from repeated exposure to
known carcinogens in oncology labs.
In England, and increasingly in the United
States, opponents of scientific experimentation
on live animals have used these isolated images
to mobilize sizable numbers of people in support
of "animal rights." â€¢
We do agree that animals used in research
should be housed and treated in as humane a
fashion as possible. So, however, does Stanford.
The University does an excellent job in this
regard and will do an even better one once the
planned modern animal facility is completed. It
is both ironic and tragic that the contribution of
the animal rights movement to animal rights at
Stanford has been to block construction of an
improved animal facility in which animals would
be treated more humanely.
The real argument against the radical animal
rights activists, however, is much larger. Simply
put, research to combat human diseases is more
important than the "right" of animals not to be
experimented upon. Traditionally, this argument
has been couched in cost/benefit terms: How
many lab animals is the health of, say, your

sister worth to you?
But those of us who have lost or nearly lost a
friend or relative to disease know that even such
quantitative judgements do not apply. The dif
ference between the life of a loved human being
and the life of a lab rat is qualitative and abso
lute, and if radical factions within the animal
rights movement cannot see this difference, then
we! have no common ground for discussion.
vJVhen the efforts of these radicals cause a
delay or cessation of research, the protesters
must realize that the results of their actions will
not be measured in lost hours of experimentation
but rather in lost human lives.
In recent weeks University President Donald
Kennedy has become increasingly outspoken in
opposition to the animal rights movement. We
share his position, but we urge him to re
evaluate his tactics.
Kennedy has been painting the animal rights
movement with too broad a brush. He has not
distinguished between the moderate members of
the movement and the radicals. The moderates
are motivated by the same spirit as Stanford in
desiring that research animals be treated
humanely. They probably could be convinced to
support Stanford's animal research policy if
Kennedy would more clearly delineate exactly
what that policy is.
