## A 						complete lack of respect 
### 
; Last spring quarter, a coalition
of Stanford students led by
I MEChA (the Hispanic student
-organization) fought to get Uni
\ versity Food Service to stop ser
jving grapes at University
• residences in support of the
J United Farm Workers (UFW)
. boycott of all non-union Califor-
I nia table grapes.

This year, Food Service has
;again begun serving grapes
[despite protests by many stu
dents and an ASSU resolution
• supporting the boycott. Since the
ASSU is the only elected student
'representation on campus, Food
.Service's total disregard for the
'resolution demonstrates a com
.plete lack of respect for student
[government.
• The danger to consumers of
[pesticide poisoning is a direct
of the irresponsible
! business-first attitude of the state
; government and its refusal to reg
ulate pesticide use. In California,
I the same government agency that
| is supposed to investigate cases
[of pesticide poisoning is also in
; charge of encouraging agricul
tural business. This is clearly a
[conflict of interest
; The grape boycott was called
[by the UFW to protest the con
stant danger of poisoning from
dangerous chemicals and the

continual harassment and abuse
to which workers are subjected
by growers in the fields.
The anti-farmworker practices
of agribusiness in California have
been notorious ever since the
UFW first brought attention to
them in the 19605. Since George
Deukmejian was elected gover
nor, open hostility towards the
workers and their union has in
creased because Deukmejian has
sent out a clear message to the
growers that he will support busi
ness- over the-interests-of the
farmworker. He cut the budget of
the Agricultural Labor Relations
Board by 23 percent in his first
year in office, greatly increasing
the backlog in complaint cases
filed by workers.
Already there are many docu
mented cases of death by poison
ing in the fields, and some ex
perts estimate that the number of
injuries may be as high as 300,000
per year.
At Stanford, too often we see
ourselves as a separate and iso
lated entity, without connection
or responsibility to the wider so
ciety. We get so lost in the in
tricacies of academic debate that
we lose a sense of perspective for
the sake of a presumed
"objectivity."
Any action that we take as in
dividuals or as a university com
munity must necessarily have po
litical implications because we
are not creatures living in bal
loons isolated from the world

around us. In this particular
issue, not supporting the boycott
is not "objective" or
"unpolitical" at all — it is taking
a clear stand in favor of agricul
tural business interests and
against the farmworkers, while at
the same time endangering our
health.
Not supporting the boycott is
giving tacit support to the contin
ued poisoning of people who
work under physically arduous
conditions to feed this country.
Pesticide poisoning is not just a
worker's issue but a consumer's
issue, and therefore something
against which all of us should
; unite.
Here at Stanford there are
many Chicano, Mexican and
other Latino students whose par
ents or other relatives have
worked in the fields of the south
western United States. Farm
labor is a fundamental aspect of
their experience. It is no coinci
dence that it was MEChA that
first pushed the issue of the grape
boycott on this campus.
Asking our community to be
"objective" is asking people who
have a personal experience with
the exploitation of farm laborers
to turn their backs on their own
communities. As members of the
University community, we have
a right to demand that our money
not serve to perpetuate further
hardship on our own people.
