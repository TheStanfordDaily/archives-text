Plenty of people can collect who
don't need it. Just as with
welfare, they are in the minority,
but that doesn't mean those
people don't exist.
We in the 20 to 40-year-old age
bracket are putting a lot of
money into the Social Security
program. Benefits are at their
highest point ever, in both dollar

amounts and percentage of cost
of living, because of the baby
boomers and successive addi
tions to the employment market.
We, who will pay enormous
amounts of money, will find the
currently protected system bank
rupt when we might need that
money. When we hit the 65 age
barrier, the population of young
employed suckers will be much
smaller than it is now. Contrary
to popular belief, we aren't
paying for our own future but for
other's present.
I'm very surprised to see the
college Republican and Demo
cratic organizations ignore the
Social Security problem. Unfor
tunately I'm not as surprised to
see the younger group of elective
politicians also fall in line with
the old guard.
We have an inept system of so
cial security. It, as the rest of our
governmental mess, has much
room for overhaul and cutting.
We should protect our older
citizens, but not at the expense of
other needy Americans. Other
wise, what is the equality we
claim to have?
Race, sex and religion are not
the only areas where equality
should be reached. All of our
needy — single mothers, the un
employed, the physically im
paired, ad infinitum — should be
helped. But they should be only
helped to a level at which they
can help themselves. That is
what the politicians are saying

for all aid programs except Social
Security.
Social Security is no different.
It goes to a different sector of the
population but for the same
reasons. Why should it be treated
differently?

Apathy claim not
fully warranted
It amazes me sometimes what
people will do for a story. I am
writing in response to a column,
"Sunday afternoon apathy . .
(Daily, Oct. 27). I was there (on
Universitv Avenue) with two of
my friends and don't agree with
the version of the afternoon at
all.
What I remember was a
woman sitting on a bench holding
her head back because of a nose
bleed. So far, so good. But then
our memories seem to diverge.
Contrary to the author's story,
there were people under 40 who
stopped and asked her if she
needed help; my two friends and
I were at least three of them. And
as a matter of fact, 1 was the one
who offered to get her some
Kleenex!!
Unless, of course, there was
another woman who did the
same. Although, if we believe the
author, her rescuers were few

and far between, and thus it is
highly unlikely that two people
would say the exact same thing.
Now, don't get me wrong. 1
don t want thanks. I had com
pletely forgotten about the inci
dent; it just wasn't that out of the
ordinary to help someone who
seemed to be in trouble.
1 do agree that there are fewer
compassionate people out there
than one would hope there would
be, but don't make it sound
worse than it is, just for the sake
of a story!! And don't generalize
groups of people especially when
the facts are wrong.
I find it very unnerving that the
author classified those who
stopped to help as at least 40, and
female. Fine, I am a woman, but
I am obviously NOT 40 and I did
not stop out of guilt either. But
how can we believe her classifi
cation, anyway? Who else did
the author leave out?

citizens, but not at the expense of
other needy Americans. Other
wise, what is the equality we
claim to have?
Race, sex and religion are not
the only areas where equality
should be reached. All of our
needy — single mothers, the un
employed, the physically im
paired, ad infinitum — should be
helped. But they should be only
helped to a level at which they
can help themselves. That is
what the politicians are saying

for all aid programs except Social
Security.
Social Security is no different.
It goes to a different sector of the
population but for the same
reasons. Why should it be treated
differently?

Apathy claim not
fully warranted
It amazes me sometimes what
people will do for a story. I am
writing in response to a column,
"Sunday afternoon apathy . .
(Daily, Oct. 27). I was there (on
Universitv Avenue) with two of
my friends and don't agree with
the version of the afternoon at
all.
What I remember was a
woman sitting on a bench holding
her head back because of a nose
bleed. So far, so good. But then
our memories seem to diverge.
Contrary to the author's story,
there were people under 40 who
stopped and asked her if she
needed help; my two friends and
I were at least three of them. And
as a matter of fact, 1 was the one
who offered to get her some
Kleenex!!
Unless, of course, there was
another woman who did the
same. Although, if we believe the
author, her rescuers were few

and far between, and thus it is
highly unlikely that two people
would say the exact same thing.
Now, don't get me wrong. 1
don t want thanks. I had com
pletely forgotten about the inci
dent; it just wasn't that out of the
ordinary to help someone who
seemed to be in trouble.
1 do agree that there are fewer
compassionate people out there
than one would hope there would
be, but don't make it sound
worse than it is, just for the sake
of a story!! And don't generalize
groups of people especially when
the facts are wrong.
I find it very unnerving that the
author classified those who
stopped to help as at least 40, and
female. Fine, I am a woman, but
I am obviously NOT 40 and I did
not stop out of guilt either. But
how can we believe her classifi
cation, anyway? Who else did
the author leave out?

Plenty of people can collect who
don't need it. Just as with
welfare, they are in the minority,
but that doesn't mean those
people don't exist.
We in the 20 to 40-year-old age
bracket are putting a lot of
money into the Social Security
program. Benefits are at their
highest point ever, in both dollar

amounts and percentage of cost
of living, because of the baby
boomers and successive addi
tions to the employment market.
We, who will pay enormous
amounts of money, will find the
currently protected system bank
rupt when we might need that
money. When we hit the 65 age
barrier, the population of young
employed suckers will be much
smaller than it is now. Contrary
to popular belief, we aren't
paying for our own future but for
other's present.
I'm very surprised to see the
college Republican and Demo
cratic organizations ignore the
Social Security problem. Unfor
tunately I'm not as surprised to
see the younger group of elective
politicians also fall in line with
the old guard.
We have an inept system of so
cial security. It, as the rest of our
governmental mess, has much
room for overhaul and cutting.
We should protect our older
citizens, but not at the expense of
other needy Americans. Other
wise, what is the equality we
