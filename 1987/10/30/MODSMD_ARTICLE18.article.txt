# Dukakis' plan bears look
## 
### 
Mike Dukakis" health insurance plan for Massa
chusetts is a good example of why Gov. Dukakis
should be president.
Like all government services, national health in
surance is socialist. Thanks to Reagan that means
the Republicans are unable to consider it on its
merits. Sensing the "conservative" political winds
the other Democratic contenders also avoid the
issue. But Dukakis considers everything on its
merits, and has offered an excellent health insur
ance plan.

Conservatives used to call for government action
where market imperfections kept the market sys
tem from achieving what perfect markets would
achieve. The burden was placed on the proponents
of government action to argue that government
could do a better job than the imperfect market, but
where the arguments were compelling conserva
tives would enhance them
Due to a glaring market imperfection, health in
surance is underconsumed by the unemployed. If
capital markets were perfect people who lost their
jobs could borrow against future earnings and
maintain a smooth consumption stream over eco
nomic fluctuations.
But people typically are not able to borrow
against future earnings, especially when they are
unemployed. If they have little savings they have
no alternative but to cut back on expenditures.
Health insurance is one of the expenditures most
likely to be dropped. Government can offset the
capital market imperfection by providing the un
employed with the health insurance they would buy
if they were not liquidity-constrained.
A major illness or injury can easily wipe out an
uninsured family's wealth. People's hopes and
plans, their potential to give and partake with the
rest of us, can be destroyed all too easily. Society
has an interest in preventing these losses, even
from a shortsighted fiscal point of view. Wiped-out
families are liable to swell the welfare roles, pay
less taxes and commit more crimes.
This kind of argument used to mean everything
to conservatives, before the Reaganauts rewrote
the conservative political agenda. Maybe when
Reagan is gone, reason will return. In the
meantime, there is Mike Dukakis.

Dukakis' plan targets the problem of the un
insured unemployed by requiring employers to pro
vide health insurance for their employees and using
state money to purchase health insurance for the
unemployed.
Lester Thurow, professor of economics at MIT,
has criticized Dukakis' plan because it makes
health insurance a part of the cost of hiring a
worker. This makes labor less attractive than capi
tal as a productive input and makes it harder for our
industry to compete with goods from countries
with low labor costs.
Health insurance provided by employers is al
ready the norm, so Dukakis' plan would not
worsen these effects; but I agree with Thurow that
a payroll-financed plan is not the best.
Preferable would be a plan that provided limited
catastrophic health insurance to everyone,
employed or unemployed. Individuals or
employers could purchase more complete insur
ance themselves. The people's tax bills would be
raised on average by the cost of the coverage pro
vided, and the government's role as an inter
mediary would be increased. That is a negative for
those who don't like government intervention. But
the payroll distortion would be eliminated, which is
a more important benefit on the same front.
Under either plan the government would have to
get into the difficult business of placing limits on
what life-extending procedures it is willing to pay
for. That is an issue we've been needing to face for
a long time.
Strict limits would have to be placed on what the
government would pay for in terms of terminal
care. If individuals want extensive terminal care
they can buy their own coverage. If, failing that,
they want to spend their children's inheritance on
terminal care, they can do that too. But govern
ment has no business spending the inheritance of
the future on terminal care for people who do not
make their own provision for it.
Until a cure for AIDS is found, terminal care of
AIDS patients should be transferred from hospitals
to hospices. The hospitals will not bear the weight
of a growing epidemic. Neither will our system of
private health insurance.
Government must be decisive if it wants to be
compassionate. The Democrats tried to be compas
sionate without being decisive and spent huge
amounts of money on inefficient or misguided so
cial programs. The Republicans have rejected com
passion only to be pennywise and pound-foolish,
and the bills have continued to rise. Look for Mike
Dukakis to finally do things right.
