## Contrived plot kills 'Suspect' 
### Jennifer Reese Staff writer 
For anyone who has spent
much time in Washington, D.C.,
the new crime-drama movie
Suspect'' will seem to capture
that city's strange mix of high
powered politics and its appalling
number of derelicts.
Scenes of posh Capitol Hill
cocktail parties are interspersed
with shots of shantytowns by the
Potomac. A deaf, homeless man
is implicated in a murder; later, a
Supreme Court nominee is

accused of the same crime. The
movie tries to tie the two ends to
gether, which is more than can be
said for most movies about crime
in the capital.
Unfortunately, that commen
dable effort isn't enough to save
"Suspect."
The film begins when the body
of a young woman, her throat
sliced open, is found floating in
the Potomac. The obvious
suspect is a wild and violent indi
gent who is found with the dead
woman's purse in his possession.
He biles the hand of a police offi

cer and later assaults his own at
torney.
It looks like an open-and-shut
case, but a few loose ends con
vince the attorney (Cher) that her
client is innocent. With the help
of a suave lobbyist serving on the
jury (Dennis Quaid), she begins
unraveling the creepy case. It
leads inevitably into the upper
echelons of the Washington
power structure.
Movies about corruption
among those in power can be
eerie and addictive. It's fascinat
ing to watch the truth emerge and

the guilt slowly sink onto the
shoulders of the most respected
and least suspected. It's a chill
ing formula. But it takes a very
deft touch. "Suspect" is altoget
her too heavy-handed, so there's
no way to savor the bizarre
twists of plot.
The fact that the cold-faced,
elite old men in this movie are
guilty of something is obvious
from the beginning. There's no
moment of shock or suprise. And
