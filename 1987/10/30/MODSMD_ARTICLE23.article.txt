## Contrived plot kills 'Suspect' 
### Jennifer Reese Staff writer 
For anyone who has spent
much time in Washington, D.C.,
the new crime-drama movie
Suspect'' will seem to capture
that city's strange mix of high
powered politics and its appalling
number of derelicts.
Scenes of posh Capitol Hill
cocktail parties are interspersed
with shots of shantytowns by the
Potomac. A deaf, homeless man
is implicated in a murder; later, a
Supreme Court nominee is

accused of the same crime. The
movie tries to tie the two ends to
gether, which is more than can be
said for most movies about crime
in the capital.
Unfortunately, that commen
dable effort isn't enough to save
"Suspect."
The film begins when the body
of a young woman, her throat
sliced open, is found floating in
the Potomac. The obvious
suspect is a wild and violent indi
gent who is found with the dead
woman's purse in his possession.
He biles the hand of a police offi

cer and later assaults his own at
torney.
It looks like an open-and-shut
case, but a few loose ends con
vince the attorney (Cher) that her
client is innocent. With the help
of a suave lobbyist serving on the
jury (Dennis Quaid), she begins
unraveling the creepy case. It
leads inevitably into the upper
echelons of the Washington
power structure.
Movies about corruption
among those in power can be
eerie and addictive. It's fascinat
ing to watch the truth emerge and

the guilt slowly sink onto the
shoulders of the most respected
and least suspected. It's a chill
ing formula. But it takes a very
deft touch. "Suspect" is altoget
her too heavy-handed, so there's
no way to savor the bizarre
twists of plot.
The fact that the cold-faced,
elite old men in this movie are
guilty of something is obvious
from the beginning. There's no
moment of shock or suprise. And

derelict-defendant from a
monstrous, scabby, bearded
creature into a maligned Vietnam
vet anti-hero, is too sappy. It's
just plain stupid. The script is
clumsy and predictable, and the
goose bumps never come.
This is a shame, because a lot
of the crucial ingredients for a

good movie are here. The Wash
ington filmed in this movie is cold
and bitterly real, right down to
the bum sleeping on a park
bench. Due time is given to the
glittering halls of power, but for
the most part everyone looks a
little chilly, hurried and pale.
This isn t the silly high-gloss
Washington of a film like "No
Way Out" â€” "Suspect" gets the
atmosphere just right.
The performances are also
right on key. Cher is the hard,

driven attorney, and she proves
with this movie that she can play
it smart. This isn't her usual
slangy, sleazy role, but she's
tough and believable here. Her
character bristles with antagonis
tic energy tempered with vul
nerability.
Opposite her is Dennis Quaid,
who is the sexiest and most inter
esting young actor around these
days. He needs a spotlight,
though, and this is Cher's movie.
Quaid's role is too weak, too un
defined. It doesn't showcase him
the way it could have, and the
way "The Big Easy" did to such
great effect.
Indeed, both actors go to
waste here, mouthing lines that
are unworthy of them. Using
Cher and Dennis Quaid in a
mediocre movie like this is like
serving fine wine at a tuna
casserole dinner.
There's been a rash of crime
drama movies lately, a few ter
rific, others less so. "Suspect" is
the latest in a long list, and it gets
high points for effort, but like too
many others it doesn't quite
deliver. The actors are great,
there's some interesting stuff
going on, but it's as though some
one didn't put his foot on the ac
celerator hard enough. The sting
isn't there and "Suspect" is just
another so-so ride.
