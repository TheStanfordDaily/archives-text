# Bad acting in a bad 'Land'
## 
### Kelly Brown 
Benjy Taylor loves to tinker
with fast cars. Ted Varrick
loves to steal them. It seems
like the beginning of a beauti
ful relationship, except for one
problem.
Benjy is a cop assigned to
lock Ted up. Well actually,
there's another problem:
Benjy begins to enjoy the life
in the fast lane he's entered as
an undercover agent.
All of this lays the founda
tion for "No Man's Land," an
interesting but flawed thriller
that offers a somewhat
plausible plot and enough car
chases to satisfy even most ar
dent action fan.
However, surprisingly poor
acting sabotages the positive
aspects of the film. D.B.
Sweeney, who plays Benjy,
tries valiantly to convey the
inner conflict of the character,
torn between his duty as a cop
and the enticing lure of crime.
Sweeney almost succeeds, but
not enough for us to buy his
performance. That's unfortun
ate, because Benjy's personal
dilemma sets the thematic
tone upon which the whole
movie is based.
Benjy is a 22-year-old cop
who loves his family. His me
chanical expertise lands him
the undercover position in a
"chop shop," where stolen
cars are taken and stripped.
Benjy is soon swept into a
world of easy money, beauti
ful women and seductive dan
ger.
His sudden change in be
havior perhaps comes a little
too quickly, but fortunately
for those of us who may have
dozed off, a scene in which he

opts to go to the Christmas
bash of Ted the car thief
(Charlie Sheen) instead of
spending the holiday with his
family makes the transition
clear and painfully obvious.
Not to worry, though.
Benjy's true noble character
shines through in the end
(With a njtme like Benjy, is
there any doubt that it will?).
Benjy's lieutenant, played by
Randy Quaid, isn't so sure
about this, so he constantly
reminds Benjy of his duties as
a police officer.
Quaid takes a poorly written
role, with several cliched
lines, and makes it even
worse, acting far below his
abilities. His unrealistic
speeches and contorted facial
expressions make his charac
ter quite unbelievable. The
viewer is distracted by this
lack of reality just at the points
where he should be feeling the
meaning and urgency of
Quaid's words.
Quaid's horrendous acting
is matched only by that of
Lara Harris playing Ted's
sister, who is worried about
Ted but is never quite sure
what is going on. She has a
brief and pointless romantic
interlude, but not much more.
The best performance in the
movie (which is not saying
much) comes from Charlie
Sheen as Ted, the likable vil
lain who has never known
anything but money, influence
and danger. Everything is a
game for Ted, and he's deter
mined to win. Ted befriends
and corrupts Benjy, and is
confident of his ability to keep
Benjy hooked on his new life
