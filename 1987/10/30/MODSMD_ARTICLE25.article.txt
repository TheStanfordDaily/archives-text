## Card seeks 3rd straight win over 'Cats 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
It's only fitting that the Stan
ford football team plays Arizona
on Halloween, considering the
s Pell the Cardinal has had over
the Wildcats the past few years.
Stanford (2-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference, 3-4 overall) has won
the last two meetings between
iJ 1 ® two teams, upsetting the
Wildcats 29-24 in Japan last year
and 28-17 at home the year
before. In 1983, a season in
which the Cardinal won only one
game, the team's lone victory
came against Arizona.
Halloween is also a good day
to face the Wildcats, because
they have been haunted all
season — by injuries.
The situation has gotten so bad
that the Wildcats (1-2-1 in the
Pac-10, 3-3-1 overall) have a true
freshman, Ron Veal, at quarter
back, and a redshirt freshman,
JefT Hammerschmidt, as the only
other quarterback. Ham
merschmidt was a defensive
safety just three weeks ago.
Arizona's problems all started
late in the fourth quarter against
UCLA in the third game of the
season. With the score tied
Wildcat quarterback Bobby Wat
ters, a transfer from Southern
Methodist, broke his thumb on
an opponent's helmet.
Just a week and a half earlier,
backup quarterback Craig
Bergman, a sophomore projected
to be the starting quarterback
before Watters transferred from

the now-defunct SMU program,
had quit because he was unhappy
about his lack of playing time.
That left Veal, a freshman from
Honda, in charge of the offense.
Veal has done a fairly good job
with Arizona's new "wish-and
shoot" offense, which is a com
bination of the wishbone attack
and the run-and-shoot offense. In
fact. Veal leads the Wildcats in
rushing with 72.2 yards per
game, and he ran for 142 yards
against Oregon State, leading
some people in Tuscon to dub the
new offense the "Veal-bone."
His 433 yards rushing is the most
ever by a Wildcat quarterback.
"He's a very quick young
quarterback," Stanford Coach
Jack Elway said of Veal. "They
lost their regular quarterback,
but it looks like he's adjusted real
well."
Hammerschmidt has also had
some success with new Head
Coach Dick Tomey's offense,
scoring on a 71-yard run in
Arizona's 23-23 tie at California
Oct. 10.
Obviously we did not intend
to be going with two freshmen as
quarterbacks, Tomey said.
But we lost an inexperienced
sophomore and then an experi
enced senior. Right now our of
fense is a little more wishbone
than run-and-shoot because of
the inexperience of our quarter
backs."
The Wildcats will lack more
than experienced quarterbacks
against Stanford. Running back
Darryl Lewis, who is averaging

4.9 yards per carry, is listed as
doubtful for the game with an
injured knee. The redshirt fresh
man has scored three touch
downs and caught 12 passes for
211 yards this season. Starting
offensive tackle Jeff Rinehart is
also out with a knee injury.
Second-leading rusher Art
Greathouse should be available
for action after missing the last
two games with rib injuries.
Things aren't much better on
the defensive side for the
Wildcats. Senior Blake Custer,
considered the best linebacker on
the team, underwent recon
structive surgery this week to
repair damage to ligaments in his
knee. He's out for the season —
the rest of his college career.
Another key question is
whether Arizona will have any
linebackers to play against the
Cardinal. Gallen Allen is listed as
doubtful with injured ribs, and
the Singleton twins, Chris and
Kevin, are listed as questionable
with a knee and ankle injury,
respectively.
Arizona's amazing number of
injuries has obviously contrib
uted to the Wildcats' disappoint
ing record. The tie at Cal was
certainly unexpected, but Tomey
was even more upset about last
Saturday's 45-28 loss at Wash
ington State — so upset that he
had his team up and practicing at
10 a.m. the next day.
"I felt like we were not per
forming," said Tomey, who took
