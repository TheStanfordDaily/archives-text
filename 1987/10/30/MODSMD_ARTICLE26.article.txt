# Stanford plays at 49er invite
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Its called the 49er Invitational, but
you know that can't be right. If it is
right, the Long Beach State water polo
program must be masochistic.
"Invitational" implies that the host
has some or all control over who is com
ing to visit and looks forward to their
stay. But, if you were having a party —
say, the Jack and Jill Stanford Invita-
A — would you invite all your worst
enemies?
• This weekend, No. 6 Long Beach
welcomes seven of the nation's top ten
teams, including No. 3 Stanford, into its
Belmont Arena for the fiercest water
polo play of the season — stronger even
than the NCAA Championship Tourna
ment, held in the same arena a month
from today.
Because it is necessary to include
teams from all parts of the country in the
national championships, only five teams
from California — and thus only five of
the nation's top tens - will be invited to
the NCAAs.
Actually, Long Beach State is not as
insane as the tournament field might im
ply. Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti
said the tourney was actually started
three years ago as a conference chal
lenge between the Pacific 10 Conference
and the Pacific Coast Athletic Associa
tion. Conference officials objected to
any tournament titled as a clash between

conferences, so the coaches agreed to
the name "49er Invitational."
Since its inception, the tournament
has been dominated by the Pac-10,
which currently includes four of the na
tion s top five teams. Each conference
has four teams in the tournament, each
of which will play the four teams entered
from the other conference. For Pac-10
teams, this means one very difficult
match, versus No. 5 UC-Irvine, and
three matches that are just simply diffi
cult. For the PCAA teams, any victory
will be an upset. t*' '
"Irvine's tough, and I expect a tough
game against Pepperdine, too," Det
tamanti said. "I'd hate to be the PCAAs.
though, and face the number one, two,
three and four teams in one weekend."
Any PCAA victory will not be much
of an upset though, because while the
top four teams in the nation may be from
the Pac-10, the next four are from the
PCAA. With all these teams facing each
other, the rankings, which have been
fairly consistent over the past few
weeks, could be rearranged quite a bit.
To add to the fun, Stanford — which
plays No. 10 UC-San Diego today —
can t aftord to lose any games" this
weekend, according to Dettamanti. Any
loss to a lower-ranked team means
moving down in the rankings, which
means a less favorable draw for the
NCAA Tournament, or even worse,
considering the neck-and : neck competi
tion, no NCAA appearance at all.

"I can say for sure it's the most im
portant weekend so far in the season,"
Stanford senior Erich Fischer said after
last Friday's home victory over the
49ers. "We're going to be playing all the
PCAA schools and we can't lose to any
teams that are behind us without jeopar
dizing our chance of going to the
NCAAs. We want to keep our slate
clean against PCAA team, we don't
want to have any losses in that column."
"We re kind ot in a precarious posi
tion." Dettamanti said. We're .ranged
third, but we'rfc ~pretty close to fourth
and fifth. Of course, we're close to first
and second, too."
Much of the pressure this weekend
will be on Fischer's shoulders, and, in an
effort to pin a loss on Stanford, the Car
dinal s opponents will be on Fischer's
shoulders as well. Since Fischer has al
most twice as many goals as anybody
else on the team, the strategy of San
Diego today, Irvine and Long 3each to
morrow and No. 7 Pepperdine and No. 8
UC-Santa Barbara Sunday, is simple'
Drown him. Or at least make life very
difficult for him.
"Fischer's been playing great," Det
tamanti said. "Io stop Erich they really
have to physically foul him. . . . They'll
be Southern California referees and
that s going to help us. We should get a
lot of ejections."
Southern California referees are tradi
tionally much stricter in their officiating,
so Cardinal opponents dependent on

fouling Fischer will be dependent on
stopping Stanford on the 6-on-5 advan
tages the team will get after opposing
players get ejected for fouling Fischer.
"Most of these games will be won on
man-up advantages," Dettamanti said.
Now at 14-4, the Cardinal has a good
chance of picking up five victories this
weekend. Irvine, with two one-goal
losses to Stanford to spur it on, could be
dangerous, though. They boast a diverse
offense with good speed. A big plus for
the Anteaters could be the Southern Cal

ifornia crowd, which will derive tremen
dous satisfaction from any loss picked
up by Northern California representa
tives Cal and Stanford.
Pepperdine, meanwhile, has lost by
two and four goals to the Cardinal in the
teams' previous matches this fall.
However, to judge by the Waves' recent
upset of Irvine, they have improved.
When the team visited Stanford Oct. 4,
its star, Aaron Chasen, was hampered
by food poisoning and a weak wrist. He
is now back at full strength.

want to have any losses in that column."
"We re kind ot in a precarious posi
tion." Dettamanti said. We're .ranged
third, but we'rfc ~pretty close to fourth
and fifth. Of course, we're close to first
and second, too."
Much of the pressure this weekend
will be on Fischer's shoulders, and, in an
effort to pin a loss on Stanford, the Car
dinal s opponents will be on Fischer's
shoulders as well. Since Fischer has al
most twice as many goals as anybody
else on the team, the strategy of San
Diego today, Irvine and Long 3each to
morrow and No. 7 Pepperdine and No. 8
UC-Santa Barbara Sunday, is simple'
Drown him. Or at least make life very
difficult for him.
"Fischer's been playing great," Det
tamanti said. "Io stop Erich they really
have to physically foul him. . . . They'll
be Southern California referees and
that s going to help us. We should get a
lot of ejections."
Southern California referees are tradi
tionally much stricter in their officiating,
so Cardinal opponents dependent on

fouling Fischer will be dependent on
stopping Stanford on the 6-on-5 advan
tages the team will get after opposing
players get ejected for fouling Fischer.
"Most of these games will be won on
man-up advantages," Dettamanti said.
Now at 14-4, the Cardinal has a good
chance of picking up five victories this
weekend. Irvine, with two one-goal
losses to Stanford to spur it on, could be
dangerous, though. They boast a diverse
offense with good speed. A big plus for
the Anteaters could be the Southern Cal

ifornia crowd, which will derive tremen
dous satisfaction from any loss picked
up by Northern California representa
tives Cal and Stanford.
Pepperdine, meanwhile, has lost by
two and four goals to the Cardinal in the
teams' previous matches this fall.
However, to judge by the Waves' recent
upset of Irvine, they have improved.
When the team visited Stanford Oct. 4,
its star, Aaron Chasen, was hampered
by food poisoning and a weak wrist. He
is now back at full strength.

against a field of the top teams in the country at the 49er Invitational this weekend.
Its called the 49er Invitational, but
you know that can't be right. If it is
right, the Long Beach State water polo
program must be masochistic.
"Invitational" implies that the host
has some or all control over who is com

stay. But, if you were having a party —

• This weekend, No. 6 Long Beach
welcomes seven of the nation's top ten
teams, including No. 3 Stanford, into its
Belmont Arena for the fiercest water
polo play of the season — stronger even
than the NCAA Championship Tourna
ment, held in the same arena a month
from today.
Because it is necessary to include
teams from all parts of the country in the
national championships, only five teams
from California — and thus only five of
the nation's top tens - will be invited to
the NCAAs.
Actually, Long Beach State is not as
insane as the tournament field might im
ply. Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti
said the tourney was actually started
three years ago as a conference chal
lenge between the Pacific 10 Conference
and the Pacific Coast Athletic Associa
tion. Conference officials objected to
any tournament titled as a clash between

conferences, so the coaches agreed to
the name "49er Invitational."
Since its inception, the tournament
has been dominated by the Pac-10,
which currently includes four of the na
tion s top five teams. Each conference
has four teams in the tournament, each
of which will play the four teams entered
from the other conference. For Pac-10
teams, this means one very difficult
match, versus No. 5 UC-Irvine, and
three matches that are just simply diffi
cult. For the PCAA teams, any victory
will be an upset. t*' '
"Irvine's tough, and I expect a tough
game against Pepperdine, too," Det
tamanti said. "I'd hate to be the PCAAs.
though, and face the number one, two,
three and four teams in one weekend."
Any PCAA victory will not be much
of an upset though, because while the
top four teams in the nation may be from
the Pac-10, the next four are from the
PCAA. With all these teams facing each
other, the rankings, which have been
fairly consistent over the past few
weeks, could be rearranged quite a bit.
To add to the fun, Stanford — which
plays No. 10 UC-San Diego today —
can t aftord to lose any games" this
weekend, according to Dettamanti. Any
loss to a lower-ranked team means
moving down in the rankings, which
means a less favorable draw for the
NCAA Tournament, or even worse,
considering the neck-and : neck competi
tion, no NCAA appearance at all.

"I can say for sure it's the most im
portant weekend so far in the season,"
Stanford senior Erich Fischer said after
last Friday's home victory over the
49ers. "We're going to be playing all the
PCAA schools and we can't lose to any
teams that are behind us without jeopar
dizing our chance of going to the
NCAAs. We want to keep our slate
clean against PCAA team, we don't
want to have any losses in that column."

tion." Dettamanti said. We're .ranged
