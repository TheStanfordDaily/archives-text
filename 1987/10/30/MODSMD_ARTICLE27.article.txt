# Golf team hosts top-ranked field
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
If you want to see golf as it
should be played, head for the
Stanford Golf Course this
weekend.
I he 24th Annual Stanford-
Burger King Intercollegiate
Women's Golf Tournament will
be held today, tomorrow and
Sunday on the par-73 Stanford
layout.
"This is one of the strongest
intercollegiates of the year," said
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin.
Eighteen teams will vie for
first-place honors, and the Card
women will look to improve on
last year's disappointing 11th
place finish. "It was the first
poor performance we'd made (at
our home tournament) in years,"
Baldwin said.
But the going won't be easy for
the Cardinal. Coming off a solid
fourth-place finish at the Wash
ington Intercollegiate three
weeks ago, the Cardinal faces
what may be the year's toughest
field outside of the NCAA Cham
pionships. Nine of the nation's
top 14 teams and the third
through eighth-ranked teams are
here.
Leading the pre-tournament
rankings is No. 3 Arizona, fol
lowed closely by USC. Defend
ing NC AA Champion San Jose
State is fifth, while Arizona
State, I nlsa and New Mexico,

host of last year's NCAAs, round
out the ton-10 teams.
No. 12 U.S. International Uni
versity, No. 13 Stanford and No.
14 UCLA are the remaining
ranked teams.
Baldwin thinks, however, that
these nine will not be the only
teams to challenge for the title.
"Southern Methodist has built a
very strong program, Washing
ton really showed something the
other week (in their home tourna
ment), and Minnesota is the best
team in the Big 10," he said.
The individual talent to be
showcased is equally impressive.
Many of this year's preseason
Ail-Americans will be teeing it
up, including half of the 1986
First Team All-Americans.
The First Team All-Americans
scheduled to play are Martina
Koch of Arizona, who finished
fourth at the Washington tourna
ment, Dana Lofland of San Jose
State, Tulsa's Melissa Mc-
Namara, Kim Saiki of USC and
Arizona State's Pam Wright and
Pearl Sinn.
Stanford Senior Kay Cor
nelius, a preseason Second
Team All-American, will join
junior Clare Dolan, sophomore
Stephanie Parel and freshmen
Jodi I igley and Kristin Ryan to
represent Stanford this weekend.
"We should do well, definitely
better than last year," Dolan
said.
Figley, Ryan and Parel all
agree that if the team simply
plays its own game and doesn't
succumb to the pressures of
playing at home in front of family
and friends it can win the tourna
ment.
This will be Ryan's first tour
nament for Stanford. Although
none of the players lack tourna
ment experience, "there's more
pressure (when playing for a
team). You're not just playing for
yourself," Ryan said.
One advantage Stanford will
have is the comfort of playing in
its own backyard. "It should
help us," Parel said.
Figley, the No. 2 recruit in the
nation last year behind Stanford
freshman Michele Lyford,
finished 10th at her first col
legiate tournament and is
definitely more confident about
playing at the collegiate level and
playing at home.
"I feel a little more confident
(playing at home)," added Parel,

who makes her first tournament
appearance this year after car
ding a 4-under par 69 in the
team's final qualifying round.
There is some concern about
the condition of the course,
which was thoroughly soaked
earlier this week. The wet
ground, although somewhat drier
Thursday than earlier this week,
will make the course play even
tougher than its current 74.8 rat
ing. Drives will not roll as far as
they usually do. Wet spots on the
greens will make the speed of
putts less consistent than usual,
but the rain will also allow the
players to be more aggressive
with their putts due to the gener
ally slower greens.
The one big advantage of a wet
course is that the greens will hold
approach shots better, allowing
players to aim directly at the pin
rather than worry about hitting
the green and watching the ball
roll off the back side.
Baldwin is looking forward to
seeing his team compete against
the top teams in the nation, many
of which they will see later on
this year at their home courses.
"1 think Kay (Cornelius) can lead
us right to the NCAAs," said
Baldwin.

"I feel a little more confident
(playing at home)," added Parel,

who makes her first tournament
appearance this year after car
ding a 4-under par 69 in the
team's final qualifying round.
There is some concern about
the condition of the course,
which was thoroughly soaked
earlier this week. The wet
ground, although somewhat drier
Thursday than earlier this week,
will make the course play even
tougher than its current 74.8 rat
ing. Drives will not roll as far as
they usually do. Wet spots on the
greens will make the speed of
putts less consistent than usual,
but the rain will also allow the
players to be more aggressive
with their putts due to the gener
ally slower greens.
The one big advantage of a wet
course is that the greens will hold
approach shots better, allowing
players to aim directly at the pin
rather than worry about hitting
the green and watching the ball
roll off the back side.
Baldwin is looking forward to
seeing his team compete against
the top teams in the nation, many
of which they will see later on
this year at their home courses.
"1 think Kay (Cornelius) can lead
us right to the NCAAs," said
Baldwin.
If you want to see golf as it
should be played, head for the
Stanford Golf Course this
weekend.
I he 24th Annual Stanford-
Burger King Intercollegiate
Women's Golf Tournament will
be held today, tomorrow and
Sunday on the par-73 Stanford
layout.
"This is one of the strongest
intercollegiates of the year," said
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin.
Eighteen teams will vie for
first-place honors, and the Card
women will look to improve on
last year's disappointing 11th
place finish. "It was the first
poor performance we'd made (at
our home tournament) in years,"
Baldwin said.
But the going won't be easy for
the Cardinal. Coming off a solid
fourth-place finish at the Wash
ington Intercollegiate three
weeks ago, the Cardinal faces
what may be the year's toughest
field outside of the NCAA Cham
pionships. Nine of the nation's
top 14 teams and the third
through eighth-ranked teams are
here.
Leading the pre-tournament
rankings is No. 3 Arizona, fol
lowed closely by USC. Defend
ing NC AA Champion San Jose
State is fifth, while Arizona
State, I nlsa and New Mexico,

host of last year's NCAAs, round
out the ton-10 teams.
No. 12 U.S. International Uni
versity, No. 13 Stanford and No.
14 UCLA are the remaining
ranked teams.
Baldwin thinks, however, that
these nine will not be the only
teams to challenge for the title.
"Southern Methodist has built a
very strong program, Washing
ton really showed something the
other week (in their home tourna
ment), and Minnesota is the best
team in the Big 10," he said.
The individual talent to be
showcased is equally impressive.
Many of this year's preseason
Ail-Americans will be teeing it
up, including half of the 1986
First Team All-Americans.
The First Team All-Americans
scheduled to play are Martina
Koch of Arizona, who finished
fourth at the Washington tourna
ment, Dana Lofland of San Jose
State, Tulsa's Melissa Mc-
Namara, Kim Saiki of USC and
Arizona State's Pam Wright and
Pearl Sinn.
Stanford Senior Kay Cor
nelius, a preseason Second
Team All-American, will join
junior Clare Dolan, sophomore
Stephanie Parel and freshmen
Jodi I igley and Kristin Ryan to
represent Stanford this weekend.
"We should do well, definitely
better than last year," Dolan
said.
Figley, Ryan and Parel all
agree that if the team simply
plays its own game and doesn't
succumb to the pressures of
playing at home in front of family
and friends it can win the tourna
ment.
This will be Ryan's first tour
nament for Stanford. Although
none of the players lack tourna
ment experience, "there's more
pressure (when playing for a
team). You're not just playing for
yourself," Ryan said.
One advantage Stanford will
have is the comfort of playing in
its own backyard. "It should
help us," Parel said.
Figley, the No. 2 recruit in the
nation last year behind Stanford
freshman Michele Lyford,
finished 10th at her first col
legiate tournament and is
definitely more confident about
playing at the collegiate level and
playing at home.

appearance this year after car
