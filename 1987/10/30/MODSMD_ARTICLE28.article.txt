And now the fun begins.
The Stanford women's volleyball team has
cruised through its last 13 matches, dropping only
five games in that span, but the Cardinal will find
the going much tougher beginning today.
The team faces California tonight at Maples
Pavilion in the first match of the last and most diffi
cult third of its schedule. Match time is 7:30 p.m.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal comes in looking for
a school record-tying 14th consecutive victory,
while the Bears, who this week make their first ap
pearance in the national Top 20 (in the No. 20 spot),
will try to snap Stanford's string. Stanford is 18-3 so

ence. resting in first place in the league.
California comes in on a roll, too, however. The
Bears have won six in a row to bring their record to
14-9 and they have moved into a third place tie with
USC in the Pac-10 at 8-3.
The Bears have only beaten the Cardinal three
times in 23 meetings in the history of the rivalry, but
then, few previous California squads have had the
talent of this year's edition. Stanford defeated Cal
in three straight games at Harmon Gym Sept. 29,
but the Bears' combination of youth and experience
has finally meshed, resulting in a team that has
played very well of late, winning six consecutive
Pac-10 matches.
The experience is provided by a trio of senior
starters, Kelly Moomaw, Heather Smith and Diana
Yovino-Young. Moomaw, an outside hitter, is a
solid source of both offense and defense while,
Smith and Yovino-Young fill the two middle
blocker positions. Smith is among the Pac-10
leaders in blocking, while Yovino-Young is the
