# Bears visit Farm tonight

### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
And now the fun begins.
The Stanford women's volleyball team has
cruised through its last 13 matches, dropping only
five games in that span, but the Cardinal will find
the going much tougher beginning today.
The team faces California tonight at Maples
Pavilion in the first match of the last and most diffi
cult third of its schedule. Match time is 7:30 p.m.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal comes in looking for
a school record-tying 14th consecutive victory,
while the Bears, who this week make their first ap
pearance in the national Top 20 (in the No. 20 spot),
will try to snap Stanford's string. Stanford is 18-3 so
far this year and is 10-1 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. resting in first place in the league.
California comes in on a roll, too, however. The
Bears have won six in a row to bring their record to
14-9 and they have moved into a third place tie with
USC in the Pac-10 at 8-3.
The Bears have only beaten the Cardinal three
times in 23 meetings in the history of the rivalry, but
then, few previous California squads have had the
talent of this year's edition. Stanford defeated Cal
in three straight games at Harmon Gym Sept. 29,
but the Bears' combination of youth and experience
has finally meshed, resulting in a team that has
played very well of late, winning six consecutive
Pac-10 matches.
The experience is provided by a trio of senior
starters, Kelly Moomaw, Heather Smith and Diana
Yovino-Young. Moomaw, an outside hitter, is a
solid source of both offense and defense while,
Smith and Yovino-Young fill the two middle
blocker positions. Smith is among the Pac-10
leaders in blocking, while Yovino-Young is the

Bears most effective hitter when
she is on.
What has made this year's
team superior to the others,
though, is the talent and depth of
the last two recruiting classes.
Sophomore outside hitter Tiffany
Rochelle was named to the Pac
-10 All-Freshman team last year
and hasn't slowed down, while

setter Holly McPeak and right
side hitter Lisa Arce are likely
candidates to represent the Bears
on the conference All-Freshman
team this year. Both are in the
top 10 in the conference in digs.
Coming away with a win won't
be easy for the Bears, however,
as the Cardinal is on a tear. In ad
dition to the 13-match winning
streak, the Cardinal has won 10
consecutive Pac-10 matches.
Stanford is even tougher at
home this year. The Cardinal is
8-0 at Maples this season, and

has a 24-2 game record at home.
Stanford also has never lost a
home Pac-10 match in the year
and-a-half history of the league
(13-0). The big reason for this
success is the Cardinal's senior
trio.
Middle blocker Nancy Reno,
setter Wendi Rush and outside
hitter Teresa Smith have ter
rorized Stanford opponents all
year. Rush, the conference
Player of the Week a week ago, is
third in the league in assists and
fourth in digs.
