# Field hockey to face Cal
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
It has come down to this: one
afternoon; one game; one must
win situation.
Today at 3 p.m. Stanford's
struggling field hockey team will
square off against 18th-ranked
California in Berkeley. If the
13th-ranked Cardinal loses, it
will fall to 5-2 in the Northern
Pacific Conference, one-half
game behind both the Golden
Bears and the San Jose State
Spartans.
If the team wins, however, it
will all but mathematically clinch
its third consecutive conference
title and the automatic NCAA
berth that goes with it.
The players "know the impor
tance of this game, " Stanford
Coach Sheryl Johnson said.
"They were in good spirits at
practice [yesterday] and I think
they're ready for them."
Stanford will have to be more
than just ready in order to defeat
the highly touted Bears. Al
though the Cardinal defeated
their cross-bay rivals 2-0 in the
teams' first meeting this season,
California is certainly an im
proved squad. Most importantly,

K.iki Brown, Cal s big-scoring
center/forward is back from an
injury that kept her out of the
Oct. 10 game against Stanford.
The Cardinal is also in the
midst of its worst slump of the
season. The team has lost two of
its last three official contests, and
barely beat winless Pacific the
game before that. "We've played
reasonably well," Johnson said,
"but we know we can play bet
ter."
Stanford should have a little
more success scoring on the ar
tificial turf in Berkeley because
the surface will make for a faster
game. Such a contest, according
to Johnson, will, give the Cardi
nal's passing game a big lift â€”
Stanford has had a lot of trouble
putting the ball in the cage
recently.
The players "know they can
score," Johnson said. "They just
need to concentrate, and it will
come." It had better. Stanford
cannot afford the type of offen
sive effort that allowed the team
to be shutout by San Jose State
Wednesday.
California comes into the game
on a roll. The Bears have im
proved their record to 4-1-1 in

league and 6-2-2 overall after a
mediocre start, and there is little
doubt that they also know the im
portance of today's game.
If the Bears win they will play
San Jose State for the conference
championship Nov. 7, while the
Cardinal would be forced to wait
for an unlikely at-large bid to the
NCAA Championships.
A Stanford victory, however,
would mean the Cardinal will
simply have to defeat a weak
Chico State squad on Nov. 2 in
order to snag yet another league
crown. In that scenario, a Cal
victory over San Jose would also
assure Stanford of the champion
ship.
All those possibilities are the
farthest thing from the team's
mind right now, however. "We
know we've got [the conference
title] in our hands," Johnson
said. "We just have to go out and
win our next two games and then
wait to see where we'll be
playing in the NCAA regionals.
"It always seems to come
down to the last one or two
games, so our team is used to
this," Johnson said. "1 feel like
it's going to be a good game, but 1
feel confident that we can win."
