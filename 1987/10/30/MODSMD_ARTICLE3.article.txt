## Kennedy downplays effect of crash 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy yes
terday downplayed the effects of last week's
stock market crash on the University's stock
portfolio and the Centennial Campaign,
crediting the University with a "long-range,
value-oriented" approach toward invest
ment.
"Stanford has an investment strategy that
allocates a proportion of its endowments to
different investment classes," Kennedy said
at yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting. "We
think we're wisely and sensibly invested and
in it for the long pull."
Kennedy discounted the possibility that
University fund raising would be hurt by the
recent stock market crash.
I don t sense that this is a seriously dis
couraging development," he said, suggesting

that the University turn its attention to other
aspects ol the economy, including legislative
action on the budget deficit.
Responding to a request by English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz, Kennedy also provided in
formation about Stanford s policy regarding
investment in corporations that do business
in South Africa.
Kennedy said that since Stanford began a
policy of selective divestment two years ago,
action has been taken against nine of the 74
domestic companies with subsidiaries in
South Africa in which Stanford holds stock.
Of the nine, two have since sold their
South African subsidiaries. The University
has divested approximately $6 million from
the other seven. The other 65 corporations
are in compliance with the Sullivan Prin
ciples, Kennedy said.
The Sullivan Principles are criteria against
which a corporation's efforts to promote ra

cial equality in the workplace are measured.
In other business, Rebholz cited a recent
article that ranked Stanford 42nd among insti
tutions of higher learning in terms of the num
bers of undergraduates who go on to pursue
doctoral degrees. \
Stanford does not rank very high in in
spiring undergraduates to pursue PhDs," he
said, suggesting that'the study might reflect
the University's neglect of undergraduates
through its emphasis on research.
Kennedy attacked Rebholz's "assump
tions on where intellectual insight can be
gained" as being " a little parochial."
Provost James Rosse said that the changing
nature of the student body may downplay the
effects of the study in the future, predicting a
process of evolution that might increase
the percentage of undergraduates who
choose to obtain doctoral degrees.
