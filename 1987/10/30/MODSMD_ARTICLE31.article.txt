# Women's soccer faces Aggies

### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
"Expect the unexpected" will be the Stanford
women's soccer team's credo Saturday, when it
takes to Maloney Field at II a.m. to face an un
familiar Texas A&M squad in the Cardinal's home
finale.
Stanford is currently 3-11-3 in 1987. Coming off
of a 2-0 defeat at the hands of St. Mary's, the squad
will adopt a wait-and-see strategy against the
Aggies.
"I know nothing about Texas A&M. I haven't
seen them,'' Stanford Coach Berhane Andeberhan
said. "Generally we haven't made too many
changes, but we're going to be a little cautious,
going with the Catanaccio formation."
The Catanaccio formation is a primarily defen
sive lineup that the Cardinal has used this season.

It has met with only marginal success, but it is well
suited to Saturday's game.
I he i atanaccio is an alignment where you have
'• ve in the backfield — four backs and one
sweeper," the coach explained. The backs defend
a zone by covering anyone who enters man-to
man, while the sweeper roves to wherever she is
needed.
i his leaves just five players for offense — three
midfielders and two forwards. "It's highly
defensive-oriented," Andeberhan admitted. "We
rely on counter-offensives and quick build-ups. If
you don't have a lot of information about a team or
"112 you know it's much stronger, it's good to start
with it."
Despite taking such a defensive posture, the Car
dinal is tar from feeble. Stanford star Amy Geisse,
a junior midfielder, will return to the lineup at full
strength.
