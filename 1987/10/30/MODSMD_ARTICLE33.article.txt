# Card meets Santa Clara
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Now that the men's soccer
team has shown it still has
enough unity to win, it must be
ready to prove it has the talent
to take the Pacific West Soccer
Conference title.
The Cardinal takes the next
step toward that goal when it
travels to Santa Clara tomor
row, but the 8-6-1 Broncos will
not give Stanford an easy ride.
At 8-7-3 overall, the Cardinal
has lost only one league match.
With a 2-1 conference tally, the
squad is tied for first place in
the conference. Stanford has
three games remaining on its
schedule, and all three are
against league opponents.
Santa Clara presents a new
problem for the Stanford of
fense, which has been sluggish
lately. Instead of playing a
wide-open attacking game and
concentrating on scoring as
many goals as possible, the
Broncos organize their game
around their defense.
In the past, Santa Clara has
used a relatively low-pressure
front line, pulled everyone to
the backfield and relied heavily
on the midfielders and full
backs. That defense-oriented
style of play makes it very diffi
cult for an opponent to move

the ball easily.
In addition, the Broncos
"are a very physical, well
disciplined team," Stanford
Coach Sam Koch said.
The Cardinal will also have
to be on the lookout for out
standing Bronco forward David
Palic. The junior led the team in
both goals and assists last
season and was selected to the

All-Far West second team.
Freshman midfielder Paul
Holocher is also a very quick,
dangerous player.
Coming off a 3-1 win over
U.S. International University
Wednesday, Stanford not only
has momentum on its side, but
has once again been playing

like a championship squad. Al
though the Cardinal defensemen
made one major mistake that cost
the team a goal, they played very
tough, and allowed few shots on
goal. And the offense worked to
gether to out-maneuver the entire
Gull squad.
"The win was really important
in restoring the team's confi
dence," Koch said.
He added, however, that the
squad did not lose its positive at
titude during its four-game losing
streak, but was frustrated after
the San Diego State match. In
that game, Stanford outshot the

Aztecs 15-6, but was defeated 4-
To heat Santa Clara, the Cardi
nal needs to one-touch the ball
well, as it did in the U.S. Interna
tional match, and move the ball
well on offense.
"If we one-touch the ball Sat
urday as well as against U S In
ternational we'll be in good
shape," Koch said.
In preparation for today's
match, Stanford has been
working on the quick counter
(attacking quickly to gain posses
sion of the ball), switching fields
quickly to set up scoring chances
and following up on shots on
goal. Although the Cardinal won
3-1 Wednesday, it missed a num
,r. scor ' n 8 opportunities.
We won t have the opportu

nity to miss any scoring chances
against Santa Clara," Koch
said."We have to put everything
away."
Though the odds are long,
Stanford still might be selected
for the NCAA playoffs. If the
Cardinal goes 3-0 in its remaining
league matches, it will win the
conference crown.
Since five squads are usually
selected from the West to partici
pate in the playoffs, the Pacific
West winner has a fairly good
probability of being chosen.
Even though Stanford has lost
seven games this season, it was
defeated in overtime by a number
of top-20 Eastern squads, a fact
that will be taken into considera
tion by the selection committee.
