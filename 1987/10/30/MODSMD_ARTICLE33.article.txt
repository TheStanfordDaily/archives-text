# Card meets Santa Clara
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Now that the men's soccer
team has shown it still has
enough unity to win, it must be
ready to prove it has the talent
to take the Pacific West Soccer
Conference title.
The Cardinal takes the next
step toward that goal when it
travels to Santa Clara tomor
row, but the 8-6-1 Broncos will
not give Stanford an easy ride.
At 8-7-3 overall, the Cardinal
has lost only one league match.
With a 2-1 conference tally, the
squad is tied for first place in
the conference. Stanford has
three games remaining on its
schedule, and all three are
against league opponents.
Santa Clara presents a new
problem for the Stanford of
fense, which has been sluggish
lately. Instead of playing a
wide-open attacking game and
concentrating on scoring as
many goals as possible, the
Broncos organize their game
around their defense.
In the past, Santa Clara has
used a relatively low-pressure
front line, pulled everyone to
the backfield and relied heavily
on the midfielders and full
backs. That defense-oriented
style of play makes it very diffi
cult for an opponent to move

the ball easily.
In addition, the Broncos
"are a very physical, well
disciplined team," Stanford
Coach Sam Koch said.
The Cardinal will also have
to be on the lookout for out
standing Bronco forward David
Palic. The junior led the team in
both goals and assists last
season and was selected to the

All-Far West second team.
Freshman midfielder Paul
Holocher is also a very quick,
dangerous player.
Coming off a 3-1 win over
U.S. International University
Wednesday, Stanford not only
has momentum on its side, but
has once again been playing
