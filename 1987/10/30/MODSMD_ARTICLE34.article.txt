In honor of tomorrow's Hal
loween festivities, this week's
Guest Greek is Larry Atwater,
grounds supervisor for the
Mausoleum.
Atwater, who worked at the
University of North Carolina for
about 20 years before coming to
Stanford, has been a grounds
keeper here for 21 years and cur
rently supervises the mainte
nance of academic buildings.
Atwater's crews will be re
sponsible for cleaning up the
mess at the Mausoleum following
the annual Halloween bash put
on by the senior class. Restoring
the sanctity of the Stanford fam

ily's resting place isn't the easiest
of tasks — Atwater describes the
state of Mausoleum after All Hal
low's Eve as "something be
tween a hurricane and an earth
quake."
The tomb of the Stanfords is,
however, "the ideal place for a
Halloween party," according to
Atwater. "Nobody could think
of a better place anywhere."
Atwater said he will spend his
Halloween at home answering
the doorbell for trick-or-treaters.
"You can't beat that. It should
be a lot of fun," he said.
Atwater calls himself "a real
football freak" who hasn't

missed a Stanford game this
year. "I think we're on our
way," he said. "(Quarterback
Brian) Johnson just needs a few
more games under his belt. Noth
ing beats experience; each week
they're going to improve."
Atwater is particularly excited
about this weekend's Auburn-
Florida matchup. Citing Au
burn's win over North Carolina
earlier this year, Atwater said,
"Anytime you beat North
Carolina, you have done some
thing ... I had to go with
Auburn — they've got a power
house down there. They'll be in
somebody's bowl."

He also picked UCLA to beat
defending Rose Bowl Champion
Arizona State, saying "When
you've got that much material,
you can't do much but win. I saw
them play Stanford, and they
played everybody but the water
boy. They are the best — I don't
think anybody in the Pac-10 can
beat them."
Sports editor Matt Bodman
remains atop the Greek standings
but seems to have gone out on
limb on a few of his picks this
week. He has opted for Arizona
State at home against the mighty
UCLA Bruins, presumably be
cause ASU wins at home.

In honor of tomorrow's Hal
loween festivities, this week's
Guest Greek is Larry Atwater,
grounds supervisor for the
Mausoleum.
Atwater, who worked at the
University of North Carolina for
about 20 years before coming to
Stanford, has been a grounds
keeper here for 21 years and cur
rently supervises the mainte
nance of academic buildings.
Atwater's crews will be re
sponsible for cleaning up the
mess at the Mausoleum following
the annual Halloween bash put
on by the senior class. Restoring
the sanctity of the Stanford fam

ily's resting place isn't the easiest
of tasks — Atwater describes the
state of Mausoleum after All Hal
low's Eve as "something be
tween a hurricane and an earth
quake."
The tomb of the Stanfords is,
however, "the ideal place for a
Halloween party," according to
Atwater. "Nobody could think
of a better place anywhere."
Atwater said he will spend his
Halloween at home answering
the doorbell for trick-or-treaters.
"You can't beat that. It should
be a lot of fun," he said.
Atwater calls himself "a real
football freak" who hasn't

missed a Stanford game this
year. "I think we're on our
way," he said. "(Quarterback
Brian) Johnson just needs a few
more games under his belt. Noth
ing beats experience; each week
they're going to improve."
Atwater is particularly excited
about this weekend's Auburn-
Florida matchup. Citing Au
burn's win over North Carolina
earlier this year, Atwater said,
"Anytime you beat North
Carolina, you have done some
thing ... I had to go with
Auburn — they've got a power
house down there. They'll be in
somebody's bowl."

He also picked UCLA to beat
defending Rose Bowl Champion
Arizona State, saying "When
you've got that much material,
you can't do much but win. I saw
them play Stanford, and they
played everybody but the water
boy. They are the best — I don't
think anybody in the Pac-10 can
beat them."
Sports editor Matt Bodman
remains atop the Greek standings
but seems to have gone out on
limb on a few of his picks this
week. He has opted for Arizona
State at home against the mighty
UCLA Bruins, presumably be
cause ASU wins at home.
