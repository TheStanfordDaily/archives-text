# New book addresses education

### Chris Shuttlesworth 
, A senior research fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion is reiterating an old idea in a new book on
education policy.
In the book, "Assuring Quality for the Social
studies in our Schools," Paul Hanna, who is
also a professor emeritus of education, calls for a
national commission on elementary and second
ary school curricula as a much-needed educa
tional reform.
The book, released this month, is a collection
of articles and addresses by Hanna tracing the
development of the national commission con
cept since Hanna first concieved the idea in
1958.
Hanna, an expert on curriculum design, first
proposed the idea in 1958 to the National Educa
tion Association (NEA). According to Hanna,
the proposal was received enthusiastically, but
when the NEA became a union, the focus of the
organization "shifted more toward tenure than
curriculum and interest in the idea dissipated.
According to Hanna, the focus of the commis
sion would be to "continually canvass from the
best minds of our society new frontiers in essen
tial democratic ideals."
The commission would look at the basic
purposes ot education, alternative curriculum
models and new ideas from all academic disci
plines, such as science, mathematics, econom
ics, literature and philosophy. It would also ex
amine ways to provide experiences through
which children would come to understand, ap

preciate and be loyal to certain national values,
including "honesty, integrity, truth, freedom,
and responsibility."
I he ideas generated by the commission would
be offered to local and state educational commu
nities for implementation, but use of the plan
would be optional.
The commission originally was conceived by
Hanna as a governmental organization, but col
leagues advised against putting the commission
in the hands of the national government — ad
vice that Hanna wholeheartedly accepted. "The
commission should be focused on the local and
state level, not handled by the federal govern
ment," he said.
Hanna proposes that members of the commis
sion be nominated by a wide variety of organiza
tions representing scholars, lay people and
educators. The members would serve for life or
until the group that appointed sees fit to replace
them.
As a national election year approaches,
everyone is talking about education reform, but
few agree what to do about it. It's time to look
closely at a commission which could offer well
researched, solid proposals for use on the local
level but would have no national governmental
enforcement," Hanna said.
Hanna has been affiliated with Stanford since
1934 and became a Hoover fellow in 1976. He
has acted as an adviser to the U.S. government,
foreign countries and numerous U.S. cities and
states in the field of education.
