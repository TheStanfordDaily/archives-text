# Lawyers fault town in Florida AIDS case

### Raina Jackson 
Lawyers for a family whose
three children have been exposed
to the AIDS virus yesterday
blasted school officials in Ar
cadia, Fla., for barring the
children from a school there this
spring.
Attorneys Judith Kavanaugh
and Bill Earl, speaking at Bran
ner Hall, recounted how they
won a ruling from a federal court
this summer ordering Arcadia to
allow Clifford and Louise Ray's
three hemophiliac sons —
Robert, Randy and Richard — to
return to school, only to have the
family forced to leave the town
because of hostility from the
community.
After half of Arcadia's children
were kept home from school
when the Rays returned and the
family's house was burned down,
the Rays moved to Sarasota
County, Fla.
According to Cavanaugh, the
lawsuit accused the school board
of treating the boys as if they
were disabled, although they
showed no mental or physical
handicaps. She said that school
officials adopted an informal rule
that no children infected with the
AIDS virus would be admitted
before the Rays voluntarily in
formed them of their sons' condi
tion.
Health officials still are not
sure if the boys have the virus or
just carry the antibody, but they
assume the Ray children are in

fectious.
The Rays' youngest daughter
was also barred from school even
though she had not tested posi
tive for the virus. She was read
mitted within a few weeks.
When the Rays threatened to
sue, the school board offered to
provide isolated special educa
tion for the boys, Cavanaugh
said. The Rays declined the offer
and brought suit against the
board.
Earl criticized school officials
for trying to "make a political
issue out of a medical issue." He
said their main argument was
that they were worried about par
ents' suing, yet twelve courts
analyzed the case and held that
there was "no basis for this state
ment."
When local health officials
were approached by school offi
cials, the health officials recom
mended that the boys be admit
ted to class, Cavanaugh said, but
the recommendation was ig
nored.
After enduring several bomb
threats and the burning of their
house, the Rays moved to
Sarasota County, where the
school board had already
adopted a policy of allowing
children exposed to the AIDS
virus to attend class. Cavanaugh
applauded this policy.
According to Earl, the FBI
began an investigation of the
house-burning about two weeks
ago.
Cavanaugh said the FBI was

called in because "the authorities
in Arcadia were more concerned
with Arcadia's name than with
finding out what happened." She
mentioned one official who
stated bluntly that the Rays
would have saved everyone
much trouble if they had just left
town a week earlier.
When asked why Arcadia was
so hostile to the Rays, Earl sug
gested a lack of leadership among
school board members and the
lack of an AIDS education pro

gram in the community.
He warned that there is always
ignorance in society. "We need
more responsible educators and
politicians because this can hap
pen anywhere," he said.
Earl said that he was "really
interested in coming to Stanford
to convey to the future leaders
that they should all get in
volved.'" Without this involve
ment in the issue. Earl said ignor
ant people will continue to prey
on the fears of others.
