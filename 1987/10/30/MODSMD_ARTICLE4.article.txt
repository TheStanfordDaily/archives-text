# Frightening legends haunt Farm history
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
Behind the cheery facade of
palm trees and busy students
here at Stanford, legends of
ghosts and gore lurk to spook
many a trick-or-treater this Hal
loween weekend.
One of the spookiest of these
tales took place on "Cemetery
Hill," now the site of the Knoll.
Students may be less eager to
cross this part of campus on their
way to fraternity parties after
hear about Peter Coutt's lover.
Long before the University
was founded — indeed, long
before Leland Stanford Sr. set up
his stock farm in Palo Alto
Cemetery Hill was the burial
place for the families who
worked and lived on the ranches
of Palo Alto, according to
records in Stanford University
Archives.
Cemetery Hill became the final
resting place for at least 15 of

these people, who are now con
sidered to have been among the
earliest U.S. settlers in Palo
Alto.
When Leland Stanford Sr.
founded the University named
after his son in 1887, the ceme
tery was largely forgotten ... or
so it seemed.
But in April of 1908 a party of
students from one of the frater
nity houses came upon an open
grave along the hillside, accord
ing to Archive records.
"The casket was turned back.
Through an aperture in the cas
ket .. . was visible the face of
the corpse, fresh and well
preserved, though every
evidence pointed to the fact that
the coffin had been in the earth
for many years," reported The
San Pransisco Call newspaper.
According to The Call, the
woman in the casket was
"strikingly beautiful" and was
thought to be the lover of Peter
Coutts, an exiled Frenchman
whose ranch covered much of
the land later purchased by the
Stanfords.
When Coutts left his ranch and
returned to France with his
jealous wife, his mistress myster
iously disappeared.
The woman in the casket was
eventually identified as wife of a
rancher who died in 1872. The
disappearance of Coutt's lover
was never accounted for.
However, the mystery itself
was solved 48 years later when a
culprit involved in the 1908 inci
dent spoke to The Palo Alto
Times about the open coffin.
According to an 1894 issue of
that paper, three "slightly-under

the- influence" fraternity men
decided to move one of the
skeletons from "Cemetery Hill"
and bring it back to their house as
a prank.
The morbid joksters dug up the
grave, but abandoned the casket
on the hill when they discovered
that it was too heavy to lift.
Hoping to avoid any further
abuse of the abandoned
graveyard, University officials
decided to move the remains of
the other bodies to Alta Mesa
Cemetery in Palo Alto. Later, the
Knoll, originally University
president s house, was built on
the site.
But problems with yet another
Stanford burial site have also
haunted University officials.
In 1894 a frightening event
took place at the Stanford

Mausoleum, the crypt of Leland,
Jane, and Leland Jr., and the lo
cation of this year's Senior Class
Halloween party tomorrow
night.
According to an 1894 issue of
The Daily Palo Alto (now The
Stanford Daily), a watchman
died in the guard house that over
looked the mausoleum site.
As a result of the man's death
(by natural causes), the watch
man's house was moved closer to
campus. "Sentinel house in
which watchman died moved to
campus, successor to new guard
is superstitious," read a headline
in The Daily in the wake of the
event.
More recently, after the 1979
Stanford-UCLA football game,
the doors to the crypt were found
open. Officials were never able
to explain the vandalism.
This Halloween, those who
choose to play it safe and remain
indoors, away from sites of the
dead, should know about the
"Stanford ghost girl."
"Twice on the Row and once
in a dorm within the last year,
men have awakened to find a girl,
eyes moist and attired in evening
dress, gazing at them," read a
1932 article in The Daily.
According to The Daily, at 3
a.m. one April night an under
graduate living in the basement
of Encina Hall awakened to find
a girl studying him.
When he asked her to leave
she wept and ran from the build
ing. The man ran after the crying
girl but lost her in the dark.
The Daily described the girl as
"tall and dark . . . not a campus
girl but young and strikingly
moulded," adding that "once she
has appeared, the man never sees
her again." The apparition was
soon dubbed Stanford's "ghost
girl."

At one point the mystery
seemed solved when San Mateo
police apprehended a woman
who fit the ghost's description
and who appeared to be suffering
from mental derangement. But
the Encina Hall incident oc
curred after the San Mateo
woman was brought in and the
puzzle remains unsolved.
Another female spirit allegedly
once haunted a building on the
Stanford campus shortly after the
University opened.
According to Archive records,
a house on campus, which

Senator Stanford donated for use
as a girl's prepatory school, was
haunted by a "ghost" who was
believed to be the wife of the
house's former owner.
The wife was reportedly an in
valid who loved her home very
much and begged her husband to
bury her beneath an oak tree
outside their house.
When she died the husband
followed his wife's burial wishes
and planted the tree on top of her
grave."
However, upon remarrying a
few years later, the husband cut

down the tree at the request of
his new wife. Soon after, the
ghost appeared.
"The ghost began to walk, and
she haunted the house and lightly
swept through the halls and up
and down the third-story stair
case," according to an account
from the Archives.
Soon after her appearance, the
husband and his new wife moved
away. After the ghost continued
to haunt the old house, the
school was finally moved to a
new site.

the Encina Hall incident oc
curred after the San Mateo
woman was brought in and the
puzzle remains unsolved.
Another female spirit allegedly
once haunted a building on the
Stanford campus shortly after the
University opened.
According to Archive records,
a house on campus, which

Senator Stanford donated for use
as a girl's prepatory school, was
haunted by a "ghost" who was
believed to be the wife of the
house's former owner.
The wife was reportedly an in
valid who loved her home very
much and begged her husband to
bury her beneath an oak tree
outside their house.
When she died the husband
followed his wife's burial wishes
and planted the tree on top of her
grave."
However, upon remarrying a
few years later, the husband cut

down the tree at the request of
his new wife. Soon after, the
ghost appeared.
"The ghost began to walk, and
she haunted the house and lightly
swept through the halls and up
and down the third-story stair
case," according to an account
from the Archives.
Soon after her appearance, the
husband and his new wife moved
away. After the ghost continued
to haunt the old house, the
school was finally moved to a
new site.

Behind the cheery facade of
palm trees and busy students
here at Stanford, legends of
ghosts and gore lurk to spook
many a trick-or-treater this Hal

One of the spookiest of these
tales took place on "Cemetery
Hill," now the site of the Knoll.
Students may be less eager to
cross this part of campus on their
way to fraternity parties after
hear about Peter Coutt's lover.
Long before the University
was founded — indeed, long
before Leland Stanford Sr. set up
his stock farm in Palo Alto
Cemetery Hill was the burial
place for the families who
worked and lived on the ranches
of Palo Alto, according to
records in Stanford University
Archives.
Cemetery Hill became the final
resting place for at least 15 of

these people, who are now con
sidered to have been among the
earliest U.S. settlers in Palo
Alto.
When Leland Stanford Sr.
founded the University named
after his son in 1887, the ceme
tery was largely forgotten ... or
so it seemed.
But in April of 1908 a party of
students from one of the frater
nity houses came upon an open
grave along the hillside, accord
ing to Archive records.
"The casket was turned back.
Through an aperture in the cas
ket .. . was visible the face of
the corpse, fresh and well
preserved, though every
evidence pointed to the fact that
the coffin had been in the earth
for many years," reported The
San Pransisco Call newspaper.
According to The Call, the
woman in the casket was
"strikingly beautiful" and was
thought to be the lover of Peter
Coutts, an exiled Frenchman
whose ranch covered much of
the land later purchased by the
Stanfords.
When Coutts left his ranch and
returned to France with his
jealous wife, his mistress myster
iously disappeared.
The woman in the casket was
eventually identified as wife of a
rancher who died in 1872. The
disappearance of Coutt's lover
was never accounted for.
However, the mystery itself
was solved 48 years later when a
culprit involved in the 1908 inci
dent spoke to The Palo Alto
Times about the open coffin.
According to an 1894 issue of
that paper, three "slightly-under

the- influence" fraternity men
decided to move one of the
skeletons from "Cemetery Hill"
and bring it back to their house as
a prank.
The morbid joksters dug up the
grave, but abandoned the casket
on the hill when they discovered
that it was too heavy to lift.
Hoping to avoid any further
abuse of the abandoned
graveyard, University officials
decided to move the remains of
the other bodies to Alta Mesa
Cemetery in Palo Alto. Later, the
Knoll, originally University
president s house, was built on
the site.
But problems with yet another
Stanford burial site have also
haunted University officials.
In 1894 a frightening event
took place at the Stanford

Mausoleum, the crypt of Leland,
Jane, and Leland Jr., and the lo
cation of this year's Senior Class
Halloween party tomorrow
night.
According to an 1894 issue of
The Daily Palo Alto (now The
Stanford Daily), a watchman
died in the guard house that over
looked the mausoleum site.
As a result of the man's death
(by natural causes), the watch
man's house was moved closer to
campus. "Sentinel house in
which watchman died moved to
campus, successor to new guard
is superstitious," read a headline
in The Daily in the wake of the
event.
More recently, after the 1979
Stanford-UCLA football game,
the doors to the crypt were found
open. Officials were never able
to explain the vandalism.
This Halloween, those who
choose to play it safe and remain
indoors, away from sites of the
dead, should know about the
"Stanford ghost girl."
"Twice on the Row and once
in a dorm within the last year,
men have awakened to find a girl,
eyes moist and attired in evening
dress, gazing at them," read a
1932 article in The Daily.
According to The Daily, at 3
a.m. one April night an under
graduate living in the basement
of Encina Hall awakened to find
a girl studying him.
When he asked her to leave
she wept and ran from the build
ing. The man ran after the crying
girl but lost her in the dark.
The Daily described the girl as
"tall and dark . . . not a campus
girl but young and strikingly
moulded," adding that "once she
has appeared, the man never sees
her again." The apparition was
soon dubbed Stanford's "ghost
girl."

At one point the mystery
seemed solved when San Mateo
police apprehended a woman
who fit the ghost's description
and who appeared to be suffering
from mental derangement. But
the Encina Hall incident oc
