## Current adviser asked to stay 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
The widely anticipated ap
pointment of Stanford Econom
ics Prof. Michael Boskin as
chairman of President Reagan's
Council of Economic Advisers
failed to materialize yesterday
when the White House an
nounced that current chairman
Beryl Sprinkel will not resign
that position in November as was
previously announced.
The White House also an
nounced that Sprinkel had been
promoted to Cabinet rank.
Deputy White House Press
Secretary B.J. Cooper told The
Daily last night that Sprinkel
decided to stay "because the
president asked him to."
Because of recent economic
difficulties, it would be a difficult
time to lose one of the key
players,'' Cooper said.
Widely regarded as Reagan's
favorite for the nomination, Bos
kin said he was "not particularly
disappointed" by Sprinkel's de
cision to continue as chairman
and that it is "wise under the
present economic circum

stances" to avoid the time
consuming transition to a new
adviser.
Boskin said he sent Sprinkel a
message encouraging him to con
tinue as council chair.
According to Cooper, Sprinkel
will stay on "indefinitely" and
any search to replace him has
been temporarily abandoned.
Boskin anticipated that
Sprinkel will act as chairman
"well into next year."
Cabinet rank will not add to
Sprinkel's responsibilities, but
will allow him access to higher
level meetings. Cooper said.
Cooper denied that Sprinkel's
promotion to Cabinet rank was
offered by President Reagan to
coax Sprinkel to stay, but said
that it was a reflection of
Sprinkel s value to the President
and the good work he has done.
Boskin, who plans to continue
teaching here, said he was flat
tered by the possible appoint
ment and is certain he will have
the chance to serve in govern
ment in some form at a later date.
I am glad to not have to
suspend teaching," Boskin said.
"I hope students prefer to have
me here."
