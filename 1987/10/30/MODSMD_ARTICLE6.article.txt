### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
President Reagan nominated
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
Judge Douglas Ginsburg to the
U.S. Supreme Court yesterday,
passing over Stanford alumnus
Anthony Kennedy. The an
nouncement came amid wide
spread speculation that Kennedy
was at the top of the president's
list of potential nominees.
Currently a judge on the U.S.
9th Circuit Court of Appeals,
Kennedy has two children —
Greg and Kristen — who are cur
rently enrolled here. His oldest
son, Justin, graduated from Stan
ford in 1986.
Kennedy earned his bachelor's
degree in political science here in
1958 and became a judge on the
California Federal Court of Ap
peals in 1975.
"It's just a great honor that he
was considered, and we thank
President Reagan for considering
him," Greg Kennedy said yester
day.

The nomination of the 41-year
old Ginsburg, formerly a Har
vard Law School antitrust ex
pert, followed the president's
previous nomination of Judge
Robert Bork, who was rejected
for the position by the Senate in a
vote last week. If Ginsburg's
nomination is confirmed by the
Senate he will fill the seat
vacated by Justice Lewis Powell,
who resigned this summer.
According to Emeritus Politi
cal Science Prof. Robert Horn,
Kennedy is "a conservative be
cause he . . . believes in judicial
self-restraint. He is not an activ
ist."
Even so, conservatives in the
Reagan administration felt that
Kennedy is not an "intellectual
conservative."
He s more likely to go awry
than Ginsburg," said one Justice
Department official quoted yes
terday in the Los Angeles Times.
Horn, one of Kennedy's
former professors, expressed his
"personal sadness" at Reagan's
announcement.
"1 feel very, very badly about
it,"he said.
Horn, who taught Kennedy as
an undergraduate and has fol
lowed his career, described him
as "one of the finest students I
ever had (and) a dear friend."
"He has quite a reputation as a
. . . very scholarly, able judge."
Horn said that Kennedy has
written "some of the most impor

tant decisions regarding constitu
tional questions (of this decade)"
during his 12-year tenure on the
Court of Appeals.
Kennedy is well-known for his
decision upholding the right of
the Navy to dismiss homo
sexuals.
In another opinion, which was
later upheld by the Supreme
Court, Kennedy ruled that the
Constitution's separation-of
powers doctrine forbids
"legislative vetos."
Judge Kennedy, who was in
Washington when Reagan an
nounced his decision, could not
be reached for comment.
