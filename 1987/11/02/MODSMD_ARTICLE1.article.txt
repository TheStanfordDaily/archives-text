1 wo recent Stanford graduates
are recovering in Katmandu,
Nepal, after being trapped for a
week on a 16,000-ft. high
Himalayan pass by a sudden bliz
zard, according to one of the
graduate's fathers.
Christopher Hill of Boulder.
Colo., and Pierre Valette of New
ton, Mass., both 1986 graduates
of Stanford and both 23 years
old, were traveling from l.hasa,
Tibet, to Katmandu, Nepal,
when the bus they were on was
stranded in the pass by an un
seasonal blizzard, according to
David Hill, Christopher s father.
"They had to endure six days
and nights with very little to eat
before they decided to hike out
when they began to doubt that
rescue attempts were going to
reach them," Hill said when
reached by phone yesterday in
Boulder. "They had to hike 60
miles through the snow over a
period of three days to reach the
Nepalese border."
According to David Hill, his
son. his niece, Emily Hill, and
Valette had only running shoes to
wear. He added that tempera
tures in the pass frequently
dropped into the low teens.
Hill said that as the three,
along with 17 other members of
the hiking party, descended into
the Nepal Valley, they were met
by Chinese soldiers who would
toss chunks of bread off vehicles
for them to eat, but refused to
give them rides to the border.
l he three were part of a group
of 150 foreigners whom Chinese
authorities had asked to leave
Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, after
anti-Chinese demonstrations
took place there.
The blizzard occurred Oct. 19,
seven days after the trip from
Lhasa began.
Valette's mother, Rebecca,
said she was notified by the U.S.
State Department one week
later, on Oct. 26, that her son
might be part of a group stranded
by the blizzard.
"We found out on Monday
when the State Department
called and said that they may
have been part of this group that
had gotten stuck in the blizzard."
she said in a telephone interview
yesterday from Newton, Mass.
