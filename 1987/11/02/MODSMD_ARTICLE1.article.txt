1 wo recent Stanford graduates
are recovering in Katmandu,
Nepal, after being trapped for a
week on a 16,000-ft. high
Himalayan pass by a sudden bliz
zard, according to one of the
graduate's fathers.
Christopher Hill of Boulder.
Colo., and Pierre Valette of New
ton, Mass., both 1986 graduates
of Stanford and both 23 years
old, were traveling from l.hasa,
Tibet, to Katmandu, Nepal,
when the bus they were on was
stranded in the pass by an un
seasonal blizzard, according to
David Hill, Christopher s father.
"They had to endure six days
and nights with very little to eat
before they decided to hike out
when they began to doubt that
rescue attempts were going to
reach them," Hill said when
reached by phone yesterday in
Boulder. "They had to hike 60
miles through the snow over a
period of three days to reach the
Nepalese border."
According to David Hill, his
son. his niece, Emily Hill, and
Valette had only running shoes to
wear. He added that tempera
tures in the pass frequently
dropped into the low teens.
Hill said that as the three,
along with 17 other members of
the hiking party, descended into
the Nepal Valley, they were met
by Chinese soldiers who would
toss chunks of bread off vehicles
for them to eat, but refused to
give them rides to the border.
l he three were part of a group
of 150 foreigners whom Chinese
authorities had asked to leave
Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, after
anti-Chinese demonstrations
took place there.
The blizzard occurred Oct. 19,
seven days after the trip from
Lhasa began.
Valette's mother, Rebecca,
said she was notified by the U.S.
State Department one week
later, on Oct. 26, that her son
might be part of a group stranded
by the blizzard.
"We found out on Monday
when the State Department
called and said that they may
have been part of this group that
had gotten stuck in the blizzard."
she said in a telephone interview
yesterday from Newton, Mass.
"We and the Hills called and
made sure that the C hinese had
begun rescue efforts."
Although Christopher Mill and
Pierre Valette were unavailable
for comment last night, they
spoke with the San Jose Mercury
News from Nepal earlier in the
weekend.
"Everyone was getting ner
vous, expecting the worst.
People were gelling really
morose. I here was very little
(bod among us," Pierre Valette
said in the interview with the
Mercury News.
According to Valette, the bus
driver told them that they could
continue when the snow melted,
but it became apparent that the
were stuck when the snow
showed no signs of melting even
in the midday sun.
Valette said the group spread
their packs out on the Hoot of the
bus and stuffed towels in the win
dows to insulate themselves from
the below-zero temperatures
outside the bus. Ik- added that
they huddled together for
warmth and played cards dining
the blizzard.
"On the filth day we decided

the Chinese weren't coming, he
said. " I hey had been so om
nipresent in I hasa.
Twenty members of the
trapped party, including Valette
and Chris and l-.uuly Hill, hiked
four miles to a pass between
I hem and Nepal hoping to look
down on a green Katmandu Val
ley, but were disappointed when
they saw nothing but snow,
Valette said.
I he next day Chinese soldiers
arrived and told the tourists that
cars were waiting only six miles
away to take them to safety.
" I hat evening seemed like the
last evening, ' Valette said.
"Kverybody took out the food
they'd been stashing - candies,
I had some soup and we had a
paily."
I he cars were not there as
promised, but the expedition
made its way to a village, where
locals fed them rice and potatoes,
Valette said.
Rejuvenated by the locals'
hospitality, the expedition got a
title to Nyalam, and another to
Kodari, a Nepalese border town.
I hey reached Katmandu four
days after leaving the bus.
" I hey arrived either Wednes
day night or Thursday morning in
Katmandu.' Rebecca Valette
said. "Thev called Thursday

morning, and we just expressed
our happiness that they were
safe. They were psychologically
tine and in good spirits when we
talked to them, but we have since
heard that Fmily had to be
carried to the phone because her
feet hurt so bad
"They had to do a lot of
walking in the snow without any
sort of snow boots, and I would
expect that their feet may be
injured, she said.

"They also felt sick attcm ending
their near-fast with .1 Nep.tleM
meal that didn't agree with
them, she added.
Hill and Valette had spent the
past year teaching Fnglish in
Japan and began a tout of the I n
Fast in Septembei.
Valette graduated with .1 bach
elor's degree in history and ecu
nomics. Hill received a h;
lot s degree in I nglish with 1
ative writing locus.

1 wo recent Stanford graduates
are recovering in Katmandu,
Nepal, after being trapped for a
week on a 16,000-ft. high
Himalayan pass by a sudden bliz
zard, according to one of the
graduate's fathers.
Christopher Hill of Boulder.
Colo., and Pierre Valette of New
ton, Mass., both 1986 graduates
of Stanford and both 23 years
old, were traveling from l.hasa,
Tibet, to Katmandu, Nepal,
when the bus they were on was
stranded in the pass by an un
seasonal blizzard, according to
David Hill, Christopher s father.
"They had to endure six days
and nights with very little to eat
before they decided to hike out
when they began to doubt that
rescue attempts were going to
reach them," Hill said when
reached by phone yesterday in
Boulder. "They had to hike 60
miles through the snow over a
period of three days to reach the
Nepalese border."
According to David Hill, his
son. his niece, Emily Hill, and
Valette had only running shoes to
wear. He added that tempera
tures in the pass frequently
dropped into the low teens.
Hill said that as the three,
along with 17 other members of
the hiking party, descended into
the Nepal Valley, they were met
by Chinese soldiers who would
toss chunks of bread off vehicles
for them to eat, but refused to
give them rides to the border.
l he three were part of a group
of 150 foreigners whom Chinese
authorities had asked to leave
Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, after
anti-Chinese demonstrations
took place there.
The blizzard occurred Oct. 19,
seven days after the trip from
Lhasa began.
Valette's mother, Rebecca,
said she was notified by the U.S.
State Department one week
later, on Oct. 26, that her son
might be part of a group stranded
by the blizzard.
"We found out on Monday
when the State Department
called and said that they may
have been part of this group that
had gotten stuck in the blizzard."
she said in a telephone interview
yesterday from Newton, Mass.
"We and the Hills called and
made sure that the C hinese had
begun rescue efforts."
Although Christopher Mill and
Pierre Valette were unavailable
for comment last night, they
spoke with the San Jose Mercury
News from Nepal earlier in the
weekend.
"Everyone was getting ner
vous, expecting the worst.
People were gelling really
morose. I here was very little
(bod among us," Pierre Valette
said in the interview with the
Mercury News.
According to Valette, the bus
driver told them that they could
continue when the snow melted,
but it became apparent that the
were stuck when the snow
showed no signs of melting even
in the midday sun.
Valette said the group spread
their packs out on the Hoot of the
bus and stuffed towels in the win
dows to insulate themselves from
the below-zero temperatures
outside the bus. Ik- added that
they huddled together for
warmth and played cards dining
the blizzard.
"On the filth day we decided

the Chinese weren't coming, he
said. " I hey had been so om
nipresent in I hasa.
Twenty members of the
trapped party, including Valette
and Chris and l-.uuly Hill, hiked
four miles to a pass between
I hem and Nepal hoping to look
down on a green Katmandu Val
ley, but were disappointed when
they saw nothing but snow,
Valette said.
I he next day Chinese soldiers
arrived and told the tourists that
cars were waiting only six miles
away to take them to safety.
" I hat evening seemed like the
last evening, ' Valette said.
"Kverybody took out the food
they'd been stashing - candies,
I had some soup and we had a
paily."
I he cars were not there as
promised, but the expedition
made its way to a village, where
locals fed them rice and potatoes,
Valette said.
Rejuvenated by the locals'
hospitality, the expedition got a
title to Nyalam, and another to
Kodari, a Nepalese border town.
