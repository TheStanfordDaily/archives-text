## Chinese communist leader leaves power 
### 
BEIJING, China — Advocates
of openness to the world and
market-oriented domestic re
forms achieved a historic tri
umph yesterday when senior
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
led elderly critics of his policies
into retirement from top party
positions.
The group of more than 90 offi
cials who stepped down with
Deng from the Central Commit
tee included all the most
prominent hard-liners who had
sought to slow his reforms. A
new 175-member Central Com
mittee was elected at Sunday's
closing session of the 13th Na
tional Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party.
The retirees include the ailing
economist and central planner
Chen Yun, 82, and National
People's Congress Chairman
Peng Zhen, 85, who have been
the two most potent critics of
some reforms, plus Hu Qiaomu,
75, and Deng L.iqun, 72, leading
orthodox ideologists.
President Li Xiannian, 78, also
retired from the Central Commit
tee. Although Li has not been a
strong critic of reforms, neither is
he viewed as an advocate of ac
celerating them.
The new Central Committee
will meet today to elect a new
Politburo and Politburo Standing
Committee and to confirm the
reformist acting general secre
tary, Zhao Ziyang, in that post.

Politburo members can be cho
sen only from among members of
the Central Committee, so none
of the retiring veteran leaders are
eligible.
Despite stepping down from
the top organs of party power,
Deng is expected to remain
China's paramount leader.
Deng's power is based largely
on personal connections and the
respect with which he is held by
other top leaders. In addition, he
is widely expected to remain de
facto commander in chief of the
armed forces by retaining chair
manship of the party's Central
Military Commission.
The congress approved a
change in the party constitution
to allow someone who is not a
Central Committee member to
head the military commission.
The congress also approved a
report delivered by Zhao at its
opening session, in which he out
lined a new ideological justifica
tion for the market-oriented
reforms that China has gradually
adopted since Deng rose to
power in 1978.
The new theory is based on the
idea that because China is still a
poor country in only the
"primary stage" of socialism, it
should permit anything that con
tributes to economic growth, in
cluding techniques more com
monly associated with capitalist
economies.
