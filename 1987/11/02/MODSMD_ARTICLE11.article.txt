# Arms treaty gets tougher
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — U.S.
and Soviet negotiators, al
ready in agreement on 98 per
cent of a treaty banning
medium- and short-range nu
clear missiles, will settle their
remaining differences by
"tilting" toward tougher
verification procedures, White
House national security ad
viser Frank Carlucci said yes
terday.
The decision to go for maxi
mum safeguards against cheat
ing apparently is intended to
undercut conservative critics
of the pact who want to reject
it outright or weigh it down
with amendments.
President Reagan faces a
topsy-turvy ratification battle,
with Democrats generally sup
porting the arms control pact
but some Republicans ex
pressing opposition or strong
reservations.
Senate Republican leader
Bob Dole of Kansas said Sun
day that he would "like to sup
port the president" but wants
to make sure that verification
provisions are adequate. On
the other hand. Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) the Demo
crats' whip, said he is
prepared to lead the fight in fa

vor of the treaty and warned
that if the measure is rejected,
it could spell the end of U.S.-
Soviet arms control efforts for
years to come.
Carlucci said that Secretary
of State George Shultz and So
viet Foreign Minister Fduard
Shevardnadze agreed Friday
that "on the remaining issues,
the tilt will be on the side of
better verification."
Interviewed on the NBC-TV
program "Meet the Press,"
Carlucci said, "The verifica
tion provisions are going to be
the most intrusive in the his
tory of arms control."
"We're 98 percent of the
way there," Carlucci said of
the treaty negotiations.
"There are a few remaining is
sues on verification — a hand
ful of which are significant —
but those are easily
resolvable."
Unlike earlier U.S.-Soviet
arms control negotiations in
which Moscow resisted U.S.
demands for on-site verifica
tion. surprise inspections and
other provisions to prevent
cheating, both sides have
demanded strict verification
this time.
