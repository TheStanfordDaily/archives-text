Revolutionary changes are
expected in the design of
America's Cup 12-meter
yachts, an eminent engineer
told a group of the nation's top
yacht designers here Satur
day.
"A revolution is in the
making for 12 meter yachts,
said I rancis Clauser, an engi
neering professor from the
California Institute ol I'ech
nology and chief scientist of
Ihe I'.agle Syndicate, one of
the design and racing groups
that unsuccessfully challenged
to represent the United States
in the 1987 America's Cup
competition.
< 'lausei spoke at Annenberg
Auditorium as part of a sym
posium titled " I he Ancient
Interface, an annual meeting
of sailors, naval architects and
other engineers.

Clanser proposed reducing
the weight of racing yachts
from the current average ot
57,000 pounds to 20.000
pounds. He said such
lightweight yachts could
achieve speeds double those
attainable by conventional,
lead-keeled sailboats.
l ightweight boats without
lead are possible and could po
tentially double the average
speed of conventional 12-
meter yachts," he said.
I raditionally. America's
( Hp sailboats have had heavy
lead keels to prevent them
from heeling over in high
winds. Clauser proposed
building broader-beamed
boats or using adjustable,
outrigger-type pontoons to
counteract heeling.
I he symposium, which is
held every year in a different
city on the West Coast, was
last held in the Bay Area live
years ago.
