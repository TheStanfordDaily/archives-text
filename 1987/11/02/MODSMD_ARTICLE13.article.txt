Judge Douglas Ginsburg, President Reagan's
latest nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, is
feared by some observers to be "an ideological
clone" of Judge Robert Bork, whose nomination
to the Court was rejected by the Senate two
weeks ago.
Ginsburg's candidacy for the high court differs
significantly, however, from Bork's ill-fated
nomination in that Ginsburg does not have a
large group of writings or opinions, especially on
controversial social issues, on which the Senate
can base an evaluation of his qualifications for
the court.
Bork left an extensive paper trail of writings
and opinions, illuminating his views and temper
ament. Ginsburg, by contrast, has spent only 14
months on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia and produced little in
the way of scholarly writings during his short
stint as a Harvard law professor.
Reagan apparently wants to stampede
Ginsburg's nomination through the Senate,
figuring that without an adequate opportunity for
evaluation the Senate will not be able to artic
ulate a non-ideological basis for rejection.
Confirmation of a new justice is important be

cause the Supreme Court is already delaying
consideration of many significant cases on its
docket for want of a ninth justice. Unfortun
ately, precisely because Ginsburg s qualifier
tions and judicial views remain largely unknown
at this point, the Senate cannot in good con
science proceed as expeditiously as it might
have had the President nominated someone with
more extensive judicial experience.
The need for careful deliberation is amplified
by the fact that the 41-year-old Ginsburg could
potentially sit on the Supreme Court for moiv
than 40 years. The stakes are too high lot an un
informed decision.
President Reagan is entitled to nominate his
ideological fellow-travelers, but, b> the same
token, the Senate is entitled â€” even obilgated
to subject those nominees to scrutiny and, if ne
cessary, to decline to confirm them. Reagan
seems determined to make the Senate s job more
difficult by attempting to circumvent such
scrutiny.
Reagan ought not to complain if Ginsburg's
eventual confirmation proceeds slowly, oi in the
absence of reassuring background information,
if his nomination is rejected altogether.
