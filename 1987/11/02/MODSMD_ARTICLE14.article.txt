TV classes don't
replace lectures
I was concerned to read in The
Daily (Oct. 29) that students may
feel shortchanged by the use of
TV in classes or on SUNet. It has
not been a policy and there is cer
tainly no intent to substitute tele
vision classes for live lectures
with student-teacher interaction.
To my knowledge, TV has only
been used to augment regular in
struction by giving some options
that otherwise would not be pos
sible, such as extra sections in
case of student schedule conflicts
or very large classes (which I
agree are undesirable), pre
recording lectures when faculty
must otherwise miss a class for
University trips, tapes of lectures
in the library for missed class,
makeup or review, etc.
Our polls have shown that
most faculty and students like the
TV studio classrooms. They were
designed so that the TV cameras
are unobstrusive and offer a
number of teaching aids that can
greatly assist the instructor.
1 am sorry if students feel that
TV inhibits questions; 1 suspect
that being a member of a large
class would also be inhibiting,
and that the smaller sections
made possible by TV (especially
in the tutored video mode of in
struction with a mentor present
when a recorded lecture is
replayed with the opportunity to
stop at any time for discussion)
would facilitate classroom inter
action.

As a German university stu
dent who accompanied 16 Jewish
students from Stanford on their
recent trip to West Germany, 1
was struck by the astonishing dif
ferences between the account of
this trip carried in The Daily of
Oct. 5 and a version published in
another American newspaper,"
The New York Times", on Sept.
25.
The Times highlighted what I
had experienced — a very
moving encounter of young
American Jews not only with the
horrors of the Nazi past but also
with authentic attempts by Ger
mans, young but also old, to deal
with the evil that Hitler in
carnated.
The Daily account trotted out a
saddening series of cliches about
Germany that, frankly, suggests
that your reporter was not listen
ing to the Jewish students, but
rather seizing upon everything
that tit stereotypes about Ger
many and its past.
I have no doubt that human
bridges of understanding were
built by the trip, but, unfortun
ately, they were not in
your newspaper's account. In
particular, I know that several of
the students forged exceptionally
warm and perhaps lasting
friendships in the German
families where they stayed. Hap
pily, 1 suspect these will survive
when the last word is written
about the trip.

Involve students
in political action
In response to the viewpoint
("A complete lack of respect )
of Oct. 30, I want to question
why the author wants to have
University Food Service enforce
a boycott that students should be
convinced to participate individ
ually? It is better to inform the
Stanford community about tin
reasons for the grape boycott, as
the viewpoint effectively does,
and involve students in the
boycott by allowing them to
choose not to eat grapes (and to
consequently have Food Service
stop buying them, as they have
said they would do), than to
remove the choice and educate
nobody.
A boycott is an effective
means of political action for two
reasons: It puts economic pies
sure on producers, in this case
the growers, and expresses polit
ical support for the cause, in this
case that of the farmworker. An
effective boycott convinces
people in power (growers and
politicians) that there is a broad
base of support for the boycott.
Engaging in the boycott at the
Food Service level does a dis
service to students by denying
them the opportunity to make
their political choice and to the
farmworkers by undercutting the
political effectiveness of their
boycott.
Involving people in a political
movement is part of what a
boycott is all about. Why take ac
tion that forces the movement on
students rather than convince
them to become a part of it?

Involve students
in political action
In response to the viewpoint
("A complete lack of respect )
of Oct. 30, I want to question
why the author wants to have
University Food Service enforce
a boycott that students should be
convinced to participate individ
ually? It is better to inform the
Stanford community about tin
reasons for the grape boycott, as
the viewpoint effectively does,
and involve students in the
boycott by allowing them to
choose not to eat grapes (and to
consequently have Food Service
stop buying them, as they have
said they would do), than to
remove the choice and educate
nobody.
A boycott is an effective
means of political action for two
reasons: It puts economic pies
sure on producers, in this case
the growers, and expresses polit
ical support for the cause, in this
case that of the farmworker. An
effective boycott convinces
people in power (growers and
politicians) that there is a broad
base of support for the boycott.
Engaging in the boycott at the
Food Service level does a dis
service to students by denying
them the opportunity to make
their political choice and to the
farmworkers by undercutting the
political effectiveness of their
boycott.
Involving people in a political
movement is part of what a
boycott is all about. Why take ac
tion that forces the movement on
students rather than convince
them to become a part of it?

TV classes don't
replace lectures
I was concerned to read in The
Daily (Oct. 29) that students may
feel shortchanged by the use of
TV in classes or on SUNet. It has
not been a policy and there is cer
tainly no intent to substitute tele
vision classes for live lectures
with student-teacher interaction.
To my knowledge, TV has only
been used to augment regular in
struction by giving some options
that otherwise would not be pos
sible, such as extra sections in
case of student schedule conflicts
or very large classes (which I
agree are undesirable), pre
recording lectures when faculty
must otherwise miss a class for
University trips, tapes of lectures
in the library for missed class,
makeup or review, etc.
Our polls have shown that
most faculty and students like the
TV studio classrooms. They were
designed so that the TV cameras
are unobstrusive and offer a
number of teaching aids that can
greatly assist the instructor.
1 am sorry if students feel that
TV inhibits questions; 1 suspect
that being a member of a large
class would also be inhibiting,
and that the smaller sections
made possible by TV (especially
in the tutored video mode of in
struction with a mentor present
when a recorded lecture is
replayed with the opportunity to
stop at any time for discussion)
would facilitate classroom inter
action.

Article gave
distorted view
As a German university stu
dent who accompanied 16 Jewish
students from Stanford on their
recent trip to West Germany, 1
was struck by the astonishing dif
ferences between the account of
this trip carried in The Daily of
Oct. 5 and a version published in
another American newspaper,"
The New York Times", on Sept.
25.
The Times highlighted what I
had experienced — a very
moving encounter of young
American Jews not only with the
horrors of the Nazi past but also
with authentic attempts by Ger
mans, young but also old, to deal
with the evil that Hitler in
carnated.
The Daily account trotted out a
saddening series of cliches about
Germany that, frankly, suggests
that your reporter was not listen
ing to the Jewish students, but
rather seizing upon everything
that tit stereotypes about Ger
many and its past.
I have no doubt that human
bridges of understanding were
built by the trip, but, unfortun
ately, they were not in
your newspaper's account. In
particular, I know that several of
the students forged exceptionally
warm and perhaps lasting
friendships in the German
families where they stayed. Hap
pily, 1 suspect these will survive
when the last word is written
about the trip.
