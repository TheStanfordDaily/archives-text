## Religious views offensive to humanists 
### 
I'm not sure what century the author of the
viewpoint "Secular Humanism s War on
God" (Oct. 30) emerged from to write his ar
ticle espousing his "God-centered way of
life," hut we would certainly he better off if
he would return to it and take his narrow
minded policies with him.
These are dangerous and critical times for
this world and for this planet, times that force
us to restrain from making all hut the most ra
tional and critically thought-out moves.

The danger in the author's lack of objec
tivity is nowhere more evident than in his dis
cussion of the world communist movement.
Rarely have I seen one group of people so
brutally and uncritically stereotyped: the
communists of the world, the author claims,
have "murdered more of their own people
(60-100 million) than might perish in a nuclear
war."
The purges to which the author is referring
were not the product of socialism but rather
the bloody results of one man's rule of the
Soviet Union — a man who was denounced
by his own government scarcely three years
after his death. The policies of Stalin were
not the policies of the Soviet Union, much
less the policies of socialism as a system.
If we as a country are as shortsighted as the
viewpoint suggests in dealing with the Soviet
Union, I have little hope for the future of our
world. Socialism and capitalism are indeed

ideologically incompatible, but that does not
mean that we as a race cannot live togethei in
peace. However, when people such as the au
thor denounce socialism as "evil' and claim
the socialist movement as the "Antichrist
among us," a confrontation between our two
systems is truly inevitable.
It would be just as easy to stereotype
Christians in the same way. Or, it we wish to
be as general and uncritical as the authoi
seems to be, we could simply lump togethei
all the people that have died for the cause of
any religion as collective victims of
thenlogists. I agree that such a procedure
would be ridiculously unfair to most religions
and indeed to most Christians. However, this
is the exact process that the author impic
ments when he discusses humanists, commu
nists, homosexuals or militant atheists.
Such attitudes are, quite frankly, pompous
and bordering on fascist. They are just .is
frightening — and just as inappropriate
when they are applied to domestic issues
The United States is not a Christian country.
In fact, one of the foundations it was built on
is the separation of church and state.
This means that the government is secular
and that we are all free to worship the an
thor's right to life (his life) the way he wants;
why can't he do the same for me anil for
the rest of the country? Why should the gov
ernment deny basic civil rights to women and
homosexuals because of the views of one
specific special interest group?
I don't mean to offend anybody, but I
would like the author to know that his view
point was offensive to many humanists such
as myself. We do believe that humankind

alone can build a better America and a better
world.
Secular humanism does not leave
humankind "totally devoid of any value sys
tem lo us the "laws" of Christianity,
which have remained unchanged since they
were first handed down to an ancient culture
almost two millcnia ago, seem far more arbi
trary than the secular laws that have been
developed through centuries of rational
philosophical and political study.

Such attitudes are, quite
frankly, pompous and bor
dering on fascist. They are
just as frightening— and
just as inappropriate—
when they are applied to
domestic issues.

I his viewpoint would he mildly amusing
were ii not so terrifying. The author is a Stan
ft>i<l graduate student in history. Mow many
othei future leaders of our country share his
tot il lack of objectivity when looking at the
current global situation? Such a question
makes me fear not only for the future of basic
freedoms and civil rights in our country, but
also for the very survival of our planet.
