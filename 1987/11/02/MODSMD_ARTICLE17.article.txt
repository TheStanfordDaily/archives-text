# The
						pizza man cometh
## 
### 
With pizza in hand and uniform on, 1 approached
the door of the second floor room in Gavilan. 1
found it mostly open, so I went in and presented
the delighted occupants with their just-baked pizza.
Although their previous partying activities hin
dered their efforts to fill out the check, I was not
phased. I was the Domino's pizza man.
I hat's right. 1 went undercover last Friday night
to get you the true story behind Domino's pizza.
For three hours I lived the life ol a delivery man,
and what follows is my true account of that experi
ence.

At 9:30 p.m., I reported for work at Domino's
central at the end of Cambridge Avenue. Not many
people ever actually see the inside of this building
(yes, you can walk in and order a pizza, and yes. it
really does only take seven minutes), but if they
did, I'm sure all would agree that the best descrip
tion for it is busy.
Fverybody is hustling. Up front are three white
phones, all of which are hooked up to the same
phone number, but in such a manner so that even
when one is busy the others will still ring. That ex
plains why every time you call Domino's they ask
you to "please hold ": invariably there's one guy
who's trying to answer three phones.
I his is not to say Domino's was understaffed.
While I was there, there were nine people working
inside the building and an equal number of drivers.
When it gets really busy (dinners p.m., late
night munchers Friday and Saturday II p.m.-1
a.m.. returning Flicks watchers Sunday 12:30-1
a.m.), there are 20 drivers who handle the over 100
pizzas ordered per hour.
I he workers who aren't answering phones are
busy making pizzas. It takes only seven minutes to
make a Domino's pizza, mostly because of the
assembly-line nature of the process. I he individual
franchises buy the doughs from the main corpora
tion for about 30 cents a pie. I he doughs are placed
on circular metal trays, covered with sauce, and
then weighed. While they're still on the scale, the
pizza maker watches the readout as he puts on the
cheese.
I hat's why every pizza tastes the same: since
there's a scale to measure how much of a given in
gredient the cook is putting in, each pie is made ex
actly the same. After the assorted toppings are
thrown on, the pizza-to-be is put on the oven con
veyor belt.
I he conveyor belt takes the pizza from one side
of the oven to the other in five-and-a-half minutes.

Most of the time the pi/za comes out in good
shape, and it's put in a box and given to a driver for
delivery. Sometimes, however, the pi/za comes
out looking like a soon-to-erupt volcano, which
means that the cook messed up bigtime. Those
mistakes get thrown away, and the cook is told to
practice on his edges.
My job began with the pizzas that came out al
right. I was assigned to accompany delivery ace
I hien An Vo, one of Domino's most experienced
drivers.
You'd think that delivering pizzas would be basi
cally unskilled labor, but as I quickly discovered,
there's a lot more to it than you'd expect. Being a
good delivery person requires three skills: One,
you must be able to run at full speed while holding
two pizzas completely level; two, you have to be
able to get between any two spots on campus, by
car, in the quickest possible manner: and three,
you have to be an aggressive parker.
Parking is especially crucial when you are near
the end of that guaranteed 30-minute delivery time:
you simply can't afford to spend time walking from
the far-away parking lot to the room.
Aggressive driving also used to be part of the
delivery person s day, but no longer. "It got to the
point where the police were always out to get us, so
we had to change," confided one driver. Now.
drivers over 21 are dismissed after receiving two
tickets and drivers under 21 are allowed only one.
Domino's delivery people get their pay from
three different sources. I hey get a base rate per
hour, a certain amount per pizza for the use of their
car, and tips.
I he typical Domino's driver delivers on the side,
while doing something else â€” either going to
school or holding another job. Thien is 30 units
away from a BA at Berkeley, but she can't bear to
go back to classes there (Who can blame her?). She
is currently working on a novel and another book
about war and refugees. She is also trying to save
money so that she can open up a restaurant in a few
years.
"It's important to maintain a good sense of
luimor," Thien coached me, and it was not long
before I saw why. Many students like to try to trick
delivery people by setting their clocks ahead a few
minutes in trying to get the $3 discount for a late
pi/za. Needless to say. (his has not fooled any
drivers in a long time.
Other times I'd have to wait while students
searched for their wallet in a mess that looked like
it could hide a compact car, a Civil War-era can
non. or both. And of course, there's the ever
popular guy-and-girl-in-hed-with-no- clothes-on
delay, which every pizza delivery person experi
ences several times a nigh!, even though each
couple is sure that they're the only people who
would actually do this.
Well, that's my story. Ill leave you with the offi
cial motto of the Domino's delivery person: "Let's
make em, bake 'em, and take em."
