## Bloom seeks to anchor rudderless culture

"The Clewing of the American Mind"

Students at universities today, accord
ing to Allan Bloom, don't date anymore.
Instead, they travel in "unisex herds"
and occasionally return to their male and
female roles for basic biological rela
tions, — no commitments, of course.
Such provocative statements about
the character of today's students has
helped bring Bloom's critique of Ameri
can universities to national attention in
recent months. Bloom points to student
indifference toward "higher goods" and
to their shallow aesthetic tastes as
evidence of a desperate need to reaffirm
an educational philosophy based upon
"Great Books."
Students do possess one virtue in
Bloom's scheme: an openness to all
races, religions and ideas. He grants that
this openness has resulted in a new
tolerance toward women, as well as to
persons of all races and religions. But he
argues that all this is based on an indif
ference that "denies reason" and that
finds everything acceptable — an
opening which is, ironically, "a great
closing."

Bloom's argument then contrasts an
outlook of unlimited tolerance with one
that not only pursues knowledge but also
finally judges its merits. Such an ap
proach takes a student far beyond the
drab tenets of relativism.
Bloom's analysis of the character of
students today is bleak; our generation,
he says, is self-centered and has no
sense of the larger public good
Current literary tastes reveal a dis
turbing shallowness. Bloom argues. He
claims that students don't read the
"classics" anymore because the kind of
moral struggles they describe can't elicit
emotional responses in a relativistic so
ciety. For example, modern students,
raised in a culture of free love, cannot
empathize with Anna Karenina's tragic
situation in the society of 19th century
Russia, which did not condone divorce.
Moral indifference, Bloom argues, is
the cultural manifestation of
Nietzschean nihilism as adopted by the
American bourgeoisie. When Nietzsche
said "God is dead," the true and good,
as sought by Plato and Aristotle sud
denly did not exist. One of the outcomes
of American philosophical acceptance of
nihilism, Bloom writes was that the
humanities, which traditionally had
asserted a single ideal, were "banished"
in the 1960s
Bloom's graceful writing, his own
command of the philosophical vsoiks he

recommends so stiongly and his com
mitment to liberal education, are all
sound. But is his "report from the front"
of the academic world accurate?
While some of Bloom's criticisms are
valid, he sometimes lapses into hyper
bole that ignores contradictory
evidence For example, when he asked
students to name their favorite books, he
says he assumed that those who cited a
classical work or the Bible were being
insincere. Is this authorial open
mi ndedness?
Bloom's book is most valuable when it
raises questions about the education stu
dents receive today. While he acknowl
edges that most universities now require
humanities core courses, he criticizes
their lack of direction: " They tend to be
bits of this and that and do not point
beyond themselves and provide the stu
dents with independent means to pursue
permanent questions independently, as
for example the study of Aristotle or
Kant as wholes once did."
Does Stanford's Western Culture pro
gram provide the foundation for the
liberal education Bloom proposes?
While Western Culture certainly
presents the great works in bits and
pieces, it does make us ask questions,
like the ones Bloom finds in the great
books: "What is the best life?"
(Nicomachean Hthics); "How does one

love another person — in the manner of
Tristan and Isolde?, Dante and
Beatrice? Or Shakespeare's Miranda
and Ferdinand?"; "Which force influen
ces our lives most: money (Marx), sex
(Freud) or power (Nietzsche)?"
Finally, Western Culture does suggest
further study to freshmen. Bloom,
however, might emphasize the need for
requiring it. At Stanford, building a
liberal education on the foundations laid

by Western Culture is a mailer or
choice But the fact remains that the
courses are out there and siuaents tan

indifference toward "higher goods" and
to their shallow aesthetic tastes as
evidence of a desperate need to reaffirm
an educational philosophy based upon
"Great Books."
Students do possess one virtue in
Bloom's scheme: an openness to all
races, religions and ideas. He grants that
this openness has resulted in a new
tolerance toward women, as well as to
persons of all races and religions. But he
argues that all this is based on an indif
ference that "denies reason" and that
finds everything acceptable — an
opening which is, ironically, "a great
closing."

Bloom's argument then contrasts an
outlook of unlimited tolerance with one
that not only pursues knowledge but also
finally judges its merits. Such an ap
proach takes a student far beyond the
drab tenets of relativism.
Bloom's analysis of the character of
students today is bleak; our generation,
he says, is self-centered and has no
sense of the larger public good
Current literary tastes reveal a dis
turbing shallowness. Bloom argues. He
claims that students don't read the
"classics" anymore because the kind of
moral struggles they describe can't elicit
emotional responses in a relativistic so
ciety. For example, modern students,
raised in a culture of free love, cannot
empathize with Anna Karenina's tragic
situation in the society of 19th century
Russia, which did not condone divorce.
Moral indifference, Bloom argues, is
the cultural manifestation of
Nietzschean nihilism as adopted by the
American bourgeoisie. When Nietzsche
said "God is dead," the true and good,
as sought by Plato and Aristotle sud
denly did not exist. One of the outcomes
of American philosophical acceptance of
nihilism, Bloom writes was that the
humanities, which traditionally had
asserted a single ideal, were "banished"
in the 1960s
Bloom's graceful writing, his own
command of the philosophical vsoiks he

recommends so stiongly and his com
mitment to liberal education, are all
sound. But is his "report from the front"
of the academic world accurate?
While some of Bloom's criticisms are
valid, he sometimes lapses into hyper
bole that ignores contradictory
evidence For example, when he asked
students to name their favorite books, he
says he assumed that those who cited a
classical work or the Bible were being
insincere. Is this authorial open
mi ndedness?
Bloom's book is most valuable when it
raises questions about the education stu
dents receive today. While he acknowl
edges that most universities now require
humanities core courses, he criticizes
their lack of direction: " They tend to be
bits of this and that and do not point
beyond themselves and provide the stu
dents with independent means to pursue
permanent questions independently, as
for example the study of Aristotle or
Kant as wholes once did."
Does Stanford's Western Culture pro
gram provide the foundation for the
liberal education Bloom proposes?
While Western Culture certainly
presents the great works in bits and
pieces, it does make us ask questions,
like the ones Bloom finds in the great
books: "What is the best life?"

"The Clewing of the American Mind"
Bv Allan Bloom
Simon and Schuster, New York
$18.95
Students at universities today, accord
ing to Allan Bloom, don't date anymore.
Instead, they travel in "unisex herds"
and occasionally return to their male and
female roles for basic biological rela
tions, — no commitments, of course.
Such provocative statements about
the character of today's students has
helped bring Bloom's critique of Ameri
can universities to national attention in
recent months. Bloom points to student
indifference toward "higher goods" and
to their shallow aesthetic tastes as
evidence of a desperate need to reaffirm
an educational philosophy based upon
"Great Books."
Students do possess one virtue in
Bloom's scheme: an openness to all
races, religions and ideas. He grants that
this openness has resulted in a new
tolerance toward women, as well as to
