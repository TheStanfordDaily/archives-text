## Offense sputters in loss to Arizona 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
The Stanford football team's three-game win
streak came to a sudden and disappointing end
against an injury-plagued Arizona squad Saturday
at Stanford Stadium, thanks to a freshman quarter
back and a veteiau ?>atety.
Ronald Veal, who was playing high school hall in
Florida a year ago, displayed a surprisingly strong
and accurate arm and excellent running ability in
throw ing for 274 yards and one touchdown and run
ning for 22 yards and another score in Arizona s 23-
13 victory.
"I was surprised with their passing game, Stan
ford defensive tackle Lester Archambeau said.
"We knew Veal has great speed and was their
leading rusher We were more worried about his
running."
Senior safety Chuck Cecil singlehandedly halted
several Stanford drives, picking oft four passes to
tie the Pacific 10 Conference record for career inter
ceptions with 20.
The loss drops Stanford to 2-3 in the Pac-10 and
3-5 overall, virtually eliminating the Cardinal from
bowl consideration. Arizona is now 2-2-1 in the con
ference and 4-3-1 overall.
For the third straight week things were close late
in the fourth quarter. But for the first time in three
games it was Stanford, not the opposing team,
struggling to catch up in the final minutes.
With the Cardinal trailing 20-13 late in the fourth
quarter, defensive tackle Lester Archambeau
separated Wildcat back Reggie McGill from he ball
with a blistering hit. Stanford linebacker Rob
Hinckley recovered McGilTs fumble at the Stanford
43-yard line, and the Cardinal offense took over
with 5:21 left in the game, needing a touchdown and
a two-point conversion to win.
But the offense stalled at the 4K. as Brian
Johnson's third-and-tive pass was batted down by

Arizona linebacker Chris
Singleton. Stanford Coach Jack
Elway then elected to punt on
fourth down rather than go for a
first down, hoping the defense,
which had halted the Wildcats on
their two previous drives, could
force Arizona to punt.
"There was a debate on
whether or not to go for it," El
way said. "Ultimately I said to
kick the ball and let our defense
stop them."
Showing remarkable poise for
a freshman, Veal bailed the
Wildcats out of trouble by lofting
a 48-yard pass to split end Derek
Hill on the right sideline. Hill,
who had seven receptions for 208
yards, leaped up over Stanford
defenders Alan Grant and Bruce
Richardson for the catch.
"They wouldn't have won if
we hadn't given up the big play,"
said Archambeau, who fractured
the third metacarpal bone in his

left hand hut should be available
for next week's game at USC.
"On third and long we gave up
the big play. Those big plays will
kill you."
Stanford may have had an indi
cation that it would be a long day
when, after two straight delay of
game penalties on Arizona on the
opening kickoff, the third kickoff
attempt hit Cardinal special
teams player John Teeuws and
was recovered by Wildcat kicker
Coston, giving Arizona posses
sion.
In its second series of the
game, however, the Stanford of
fense put together a 66-yard
drive, highlighted by Brad
Muster runs ot 12 and 14 yards
and by Johnson completions to
Jeff James and Ed McCaffrey.
On third and nine from the
Arizona 10-yard line. Johnson
found tight end Jim Price all
alone in the end zone for a touch
down.
"It was blown coverage."
Price said. "Nobody had me. I
got in the end zone, turned
around and Brian threw me the

ball."
When Stanford got the ball
back, the offense drove from its
own 22 to the Arizona 39 before
Cecil stepped in front of McCaf
frey for his first interception.
"Johnson has a lot of confi
dence in throwing the thread-the
needle type passes," said Cecil,
who leads the conference in in
terceptions with eight. "I was
hoping he would."
The Cardinal defense held
tough, however, with a tremen
dous goal line stand that kept the
Cats out of the end zone even
after they had first and goal at the
Cardinal 2-yard line.
"In the second half, they came
out a little differently than we
thought they would," said
James, who finished with eight
receptions for 67 yards. "The
cornerbacks were taking over the
responsibility of the safeties, and
that freed up Chuck Cecil to
make the big play. We had a few
bad plays called for that
coverage. He just had to sit back
there and read the ball. Four in
tercept ions is a big day."
