## Offense sputters in loss to Arizona 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
The Stanford football team's three-game win
streak came to a sudden and disappointing end
against an injury-plagued Arizona squad Saturday
at Stanford Stadium, thanks to a freshman quarter
back and a veteiau ?>atety.
Ronald Veal, who was playing high school hall in
Florida a year ago, displayed a surprisingly strong
and accurate arm and excellent running ability in
throw ing for 274 yards and one touchdown and run
ning for 22 yards and another score in Arizona s 23-
13 victory.
"I was surprised with their passing game, Stan
ford defensive tackle Lester Archambeau said.
"We knew Veal has great speed and was their
leading rusher We were more worried about his
running."
Senior safety Chuck Cecil singlehandedly halted
several Stanford drives, picking oft four passes to
tie the Pacific 10 Conference record for career inter
ceptions with 20.
The loss drops Stanford to 2-3 in the Pac-10 and
3-5 overall, virtually eliminating the Cardinal from
bowl consideration. Arizona is now 2-2-1 in the con
ference and 4-3-1 overall.
For the third straight week things were close late
in the fourth quarter. But for the first time in three
games it was Stanford, not the opposing team,
struggling to catch up in the final minutes.
With the Cardinal trailing 20-13 late in the fourth
quarter, defensive tackle Lester Archambeau
separated Wildcat back Reggie McGill from he ball
with a blistering hit. Stanford linebacker Rob
Hinckley recovered McGilTs fumble at the Stanford
43-yard line, and the Cardinal offense took over
with 5:21 left in the game, needing a touchdown and
a two-point conversion to win.
But the offense stalled at the 4K. as Brian
Johnson's third-and-tive pass was batted down by
