# Veal, Hill roll on the big play
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
When all else fails, just pretend you re playing a
sandlot pickup game.
At least that's what Arizona quarterback Ronald
Veal and flanker Derek Hill would have us believe
after the two helped the visiting Wildcats defeat
Stanford 23-13 Saturday.
Despite a strong Cardinal pass rush in the second
half. Veal and Hill hooked up for several important
long gains — gains that often took the momentum
away from Stanford.
In fact, several times Cardinal defenders sacked
Veal for big losses only to have Veal and Hill do
their sandlot routine again moments later — Hill
goes deep. Veal throws it up for grabs, Hill brings it
down. No problem.
"Ronnie's got a great arm, and I told him when
he's pressured just to throw it in my area and Ill go
get it," Hill said after the game. "That's the kind of
guy I am. I'm confident 1 can get anything around
me."
And he certainly did. Except for one thing. Hill
didn't have to go and get the passes because they
were right on the money.
"Veal composed himself very well.' Stanford
senior defensive tackle Joe Lortie said. "He stood
in there and threw the ball better than in any films
we saw."
Veal's composure is even more remarkable when
you consider he is a true freshman. A year ago he
was quarterbacking at Fernandia High School in
Florida.
"I didn't throw that much in
high school," Veal said
Veal wasn't supposed it) pass
that much in Arizona's
wish bone-and-shoot offense,
either.
"We thought if we stopped the
run we could stop them
(Arizona)," Lortie said. "We did
stop the run, but not them."
The Stanford defense not only
stopped the run, but also sacked
Veal four times in the second
half. But that didn't faze the
freshman.
"He's a running quarterback
so he gets hit all the time,' Car
dinal linebacker Rob Hinckley
said. "It doesn't shake him like
other guys."
Veal agreed that being a run
ning quarterback helped him
rebound from sacks. I learn
how to protect myself, and when
I get sacked I just pop back up

and get ready to go again." Veal
said.
As far as the sandlot plays go,
Veal gives credit to his elders.
"Derek (Hill) tells me just to
throw it in his vicinity and he'll
catch it, so I'm listening to him,"
Veal said.
The freshman field general got
the ball close enough to Hill to
enable the junior receiver to snag
passes for gains of 49, 49 and 48
yards. The second 49-yarder
came sandwiched between two
Stanford sacks, and the 48-
yarder was the most crucial play
of the game.
With 3:42 left in the contest,
and Arizona leading 20-13, Veal
and his teammates had third
down and 26 yards to go after a
sack by Cardinal lineman Ray
Huckstein. Veal heaved the ball
toward the light sideline, and Hill
was there to make the catch and
pick up the first down. No prob
lem.
"I wish I could get eight or 10
passes a game." Hill said. "But
today I guess I'm satisfied with
what I got."
