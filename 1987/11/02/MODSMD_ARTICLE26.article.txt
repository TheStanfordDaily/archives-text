Even though Stanford will en
ter this morning's Pacific 10 Con
ference cross country champion
ships on the Stanford Golf
Course as an underdog, Cardinal
Coach Brooks Johnson feels that
the team has "as good a chance
as anybody".
Today's toughest competition
will come from the Arizona
Wildcats and Oregon Ducks,
with Oregon returning all five
runners from its Pac-10 1986
women's championship team. In
addition, the Oregon men's
squad is ranked ninth nationally.
And Arizona still has Matt
Guisto, who took third in the
NCAA Championships last year,
and another standout, Chris Mor
gan.
The Cardinal answer will have
to come from youth and emotion:
Four of the Stanford women are
freshmen and both teams are
made up mostly of underclas
smen. They will need to use their
home course advantage to take
and hold front-line positions.
The top Cardinal runner for the
men this year has been junior
James Alboiough, who boasts a
lOkiloinetei best of 31:23.6 at the
Stanford Invitational last month.
1 ast year he finished 22nd at the

lac -mi meet M>pnomorc r,i ic
Masulii has not been fat behind.
Mastilu .md his brother Mark
should provide support in the
front of the pack.
The team will also be counting
on Steve Schadler and Bill
Crowley. Schadler began to
move up two weeks ago at the
Aggie Invitational, where he
averaged just over five minutes a
mile for five niles. Crowley has
yet to break loose, and today
could be make-or"-break time for
him.
1 he biggest loss from last year
is Marc Oleson, who finished
third n the conference cham
pionships in 19K6 and was first in
the conference meet in
when the Cardinal won the
league title. Also missing is
Charles Alexander, who was
20th in the Pac-10 Champion
ships last year.
Johnson feels his team can
make up the difference. "James
and the twins are in much better
shape than last yeai " he said.
Last year Arizona ran away with
top honors, and Oregon edged
Stanford for second.
I he women s race will feature
many familiar faces, as all five ol
last years top runners will be
back this veai. led by Penny
