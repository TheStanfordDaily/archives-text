Sparked by top-notch performances from
senior Kay Cornelius and freshman Jodi
Figley. the Stanford women's golf team
showed this weekend the progress it has made
since its fall season began, finishing in a tie for
fifth place at the Stanford-Burger King Inter
collegiate Women's Golf Tournament at the
Stanford Golf Course.
The Cardinal was expected to finish around
seventh place, according to the preseason
rankings. "Fifth place with such a young team
is great," Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin said.
In a tight battle for the team crown, Tulsa
prevailed with a three-day total of 911.
Arizona State finished one stroke behind the
Golden Hurricane when the Sun Devils' top
two players each bogeyed the final three
holes. USC, led by second-place finisher
Tracy Nakamura, was another stroke back at
913, and Arizona took fourth with a total of
916. Stanford shot 928, tying San Jose State.
" This year's winning score was the highest
winning total since I've been here," said
Baldwin, who is now in his eighth year as the
Cardinal's coach. "The weather was
definitely a major cause. Last week's rain
soaked the course, but the wind dried the
greens. The result was drives which did not
roll and approach shots which did not hold."
Maggie Kelt of Tulsa opened with a pair of
72s and shot 75 Sunday to capture first-place
honors. "I'm really happy for both myself and
my team," she said.
Nakamura shot 222 to finish in second

rounds of 75, 74 and 75 in a solid
performance against a very tough

field this strong was outstand

was definitely more focused on
what I was doing."
