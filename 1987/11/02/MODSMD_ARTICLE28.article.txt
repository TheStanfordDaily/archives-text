# Stanford takes 14th in a row
## Spikers continue winning ways 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
A group of Golden Bears
knocked on the wrong dooi I n
day night in their pre Halloween
travels. I he California women's
volleyball team got neither a trick
nor a treat when it came to
Maples Pavilion, getting only a
loss to fourth-ranked Stanford
for its efforts.
The Bears gave the Cardinal a
good scare in each of the three
games on Halloween's eve, but it
was Stanford in the end that
prevailed, turning the lights out
with a flurry of consecutive
points to finish each of the three
games.
The 15-9, 15-9, 15-6 victory
came before 2100 people, the
largest crowd of the year, anil
raised the Cardinal's record to
19-3 on the year and II I in the
Pacific 10 Conference. T he Car
dinal is all alone in first place in
the league.
The victory over No. 20 Cal
also allowed Stanford to tie a
school record with its 14th
straight win. Cal fell to 14-10
overall and 8-4 in the Pac-10. The
Golden Bears are in fifth place in
the conference.
"I thought we played pretty
well, Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "Cal made us work
for it. It (the match) was a lot
tighter than it seemed."

I ven though it only consisted
of three games, the contest lasted
one horn and 47 minutes, making
it one of Stanford's longer
matches this season. Ihe Cardi
nal was too tough for the Bears,
however, running its home
record to 9-0. Stanford has only
dropped one yumc at home all
year and has not lost a home Pac
-10 match (14-0) in the almost
two-year history of the confer
ence.

Bears just could not keep up with
the Cardinal when the match was
on the line.
Stanford jumped out to a 6-2
lead in game one, but Cal came
back behind the hitting of senior
Kelly Moonaw to make the score
9-7. The game seesawed back
and forth for a while before the
Cardinal seized control. An ace
by junior middle blocker Laura
Olesen ended the first game for
Stanford.
Game two looked similar to the
first one as Cal worked its way to
a 9-7 lead.
Freshman Karen Anderson, a
setter/defensive specialist from
Los Altos, then came in to serve
for Stanford. Six serves later the
Cardinal led, by a 13-9 margin;
and, after an exchange of side
outs, Teresa Smith finished the
Bears with kills for the last two
points.
Smith, a 6-foot senior outside
hitter, has been a big force for the
Cardinal all season, as her pass
ing. hitting, serving and defense
have helped Stanford to its im
pressive start. She had another
big night Friday with 14 kills and
IX digs to lead both teams in each
category.
Smith and her teammates,
most notably Nancy Reno and
Wendi Rush, kept the pressure
on in the third game. The Bears
hung tough, however, while
Stanford scratched its way to a 7-

6 lead.
Then, once again, the Cardinal
picked up its play when it
counted. Behind the offense of
Smith and Reno, Stanford ran
away with the game and the
match, moving one-and-a-half
games ahead of UCLA in the
Pnc-10 race.
"Our experience payed off
pretty well (at the end of each of
the games)," Shaw said. "We
were just able to stay steady . . .
We're doing it as a team, and
that's a good thing.''
The Cardinal's thoughts now
turn to tomorrow night, when
Pacific comes to the 112 arm. The
Tigers are currently ranked
second in the nation and arc
trying to become the first team
ever to win three consecutive
NCAA volleyball titles.
The Tigers have beaten the
Cardinal four straight times, in
cluding a five-game win at Stock
ton in September, but all have
been very close matches. Pacific
is also still without the services
of junior Flaina Oden, who
injured her knee while playing for
the U.S. national team aginst the
Soviet Union in June. The middle
blocker will probably miss not
only this entire season, but also
the Olympics in Seoul.
Flaina is the younger sister of
former Stanford great Kim Oden,
who graduated in 19H6.

the games)," Shaw said. "We
were just able to stay steady . . .
We're doing it as a team, and
that's a good thing.''
The Cardinal's thoughts now
turn to tomorrow night, when
Pacific comes to the 112 arm. The
Tigers are currently ranked
second in the nation and arc
trying to become the first team
ever to win three consecutive
NCAA volleyball titles.
The Tigers have beaten the
Cardinal four straight times, in
cluding a five-game win at Stock
ton in September, but all have
been very close matches. Pacific
is also still without the services
of junior Flaina Oden, who
injured her knee while playing for
the U.S. national team aginst the
Soviet Union in June. The middle
blocker will probably miss not
only this entire season, but also
the Olympics in Seoul.
Flaina is the younger sister of
former Stanford great Kim Oden,
who graduated in 19H6.

I,aura Olesen Has pari of a diverse Cardinal attack that defeated No. 20
California in three games Friday at Maples Pavilion.
A group of Golden Bears
knocked on the wrong dooi I n
day night in their pre Halloween
travels. I he California women's
volleyball team got neither a trick
nor a treat when it came to
Maples Pavilion, getting only a
loss to fourth-ranked Stanford
for its efforts.
The Bears gave the Cardinal a
good scare in each of the three
games on Halloween's eve, but it
was Stanford in the end that
prevailed, turning the lights out
with a flurry of consecutive
points to finish each of the three
games.
The 15-9, 15-9, 15-6 victory
came before 2100 people, the
largest crowd of the year, anil
raised the Cardinal's record to
19-3 on the year and II I in the
Pacific 10 Conference. T he Car
dinal is all alone in first place in
the league.
The victory over No. 20 Cal
also allowed Stanford to tie a
school record with its 14th
straight win. Cal fell to 14-10
overall and 8-4 in the Pac-10. The
Golden Bears are in fifth place in
the conference.
"I thought we played pretty
well, Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "Cal made us work
for it. It (the match) was a lot
tighter than it seemed."

I ven though it only consisted
of three games, the contest lasted
one horn and 47 minutes, making
it one of Stanford's longer
matches this season. Ihe Cardi
nal was too tough for the Bears,
however, running its home
record to 9-0. Stanford has only
dropped one yumc at home all
year and has not lost a home Pac
-10 match (14-0) in the almost
two-year history of the confer
ence.

Bears just could not keep up with
the Cardinal when the match was
on the line.
Stanford jumped out to a 6-2
lead in game one, but Cal came
back behind the hitting of senior
Kelly Moonaw to make the score
9-7. The game seesawed back
and forth for a while before the
Cardinal seized control. An ace
by junior middle blocker Laura
Olesen ended the first game for
Stanford.
Game two looked similar to the
first one as Cal worked its way to
a 9-7 lead.
Freshman Karen Anderson, a
setter/defensive specialist from
Los Altos, then came in to serve
for Stanford. Six serves later the
Cardinal led, by a 13-9 margin;
and, after an exchange of side
outs, Teresa Smith finished the
Bears with kills for the last two
points.
Smith, a 6-foot senior outside
hitter, has been a big force for the
Cardinal all season, as her pass
ing. hitting, serving and defense
have helped Stanford to its im
pressive start. She had another
big night Friday with 14 kills and
IX digs to lead both teams in each
category.
Smith and her teammates,
most notably Nancy Reno and
Wendi Rush, kept the pressure
on in the third game. The Bears
hung tough, however, while
Stanford scratched its way to a 7-

6 lead.
Then, once again, the Cardinal
picked up its play when it
counted. Behind the offense of
Smith and Reno, Stanford ran
away with the game and the
match, moving one-and-a-half
games ahead of UCLA in the
Pnc-10 race.
"Our experience payed off
pretty well (at the end of each of
the games)," Shaw said. "We
were just able to stay steady . . .
We're doing it as a team, and
that's a good thing.''
