of ourselves and help our people
now came across loud and
clear, said Stanford junior An
thony Franklin, who attended the
conference.
112 ranklin said a workshop on
economic empowerment held
during the conference made him
realize how black people can
help the community through en
gineering."
"Many high school students
were impressed by the fact that
people actually care. One student
was so inspired as to hope to be

an organi/er tor next year s con
ference. said junior Okokon
Okon, one of this year's organi
zers.
"As the participants interacted
with people from all over the
West Coast, they realized that
academic excellence is not all
(there is)," Gourrier said. "They
needed to develop personally and
professionally, as well as realize
their social responsibilities."
"It is not a paradise out
there," he added.
Students established the Stan
ford chapter of the NSBE in 1972

and engineering. The NSBE cur

"This conference was the big
gest one ever,' according to
