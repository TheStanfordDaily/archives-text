# Stanford 3-1 in 49er Invite
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Was this weekend's 49er Invitational
water polo tournament at Long Beach
State any good? Is this fall's collegiate
competition tight? l ake it from a man
who has led Stanford to six NCAA
titles in 12 years as head coach and has
been involved w..h high level water
polo since his playing days.
I his is the closest I've ever seen it
among the top eight teams," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "This
was the best tournament I've ever been
associated with in my career in col
legiate water polo."
The invitational, which is really a
challenge tournament between the
Pacific 10 Conference and the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association, featured
the top eight teams in the national
rankings. As expected, the Pac-10,
which holds the top four of those eight
rankings, proved superior, winning 13
of 16 matches.
Many ol the wins, however, were by
one goal, and the weekend was further
evidence that no team's NCAA berth is
assured, as only five of the nation's
elite will be invited to the national
championships.

I he No. 3 Cardinal came out of the
weekend with only one loss in five
matches, including Friday's non
tournament contest at No. 10 UC-San
Diego. No. 2 UCLA, and No. 4 USC
also survived with only one loss.
Top-ranked California was the unof
ficial tournament champion with four
victories, although its wins did not
come easily. Ihe Bears had to go to
overtime in their first win. sudden
death overtime in their second win and
won their third game on a shot taken as
the game clock expired.
Despite the improvement in his
team's season record to 19-5 and only
one loss in five games, Dettamanti
could not say he was entirely pleased
with Stanford's play. "I'm not content.
I don't think the team is, either," he
said. "I don't think we're playing as
well as we can."
Friday at San Diego, the Cardinal
won I 1-5. Seven Stanford players
scored as the team jumped out to a 10-2
lead. Senior Grant Stanley led the way
with three goals, his first of two hat
tricks for the weekend.
Saturday, at Long Beach State's Bel
mont Arena, Stanford started off the
tournament on the wrong foot, losing H
-3 to No. 5 UC-Irvine. In two previous

meetings this season, the Cardinal had
defeated the Anteaters 10-9 and 5-4.
However, neither the Cardinal s of
fense nor its defense were in high gear
this time around.
"We just had a tough time scoring,
and their goalie (Mark Maizel) did a
good job," Dettamanti said. "We got
enough shots, we just had trouble put
ting the ball in the cage. . . . Our
defense didn't play too well either.
Irvine took advantage of each of our
defensive mistakes."
Against Irvine, Stanford scored on
only one of its seven 6-on-5 opportuni
ties. This inability to capitalize on
scoring opportunities came up again in
the next match, when No. 6 Long
Beach State paid for only two of the
eight advantages it gave the Cardinal.
Yesterday, Stanford played its best
game of the weekend to beat Pep
perdine 11-9. The match was close
through three quarters, but the Cardi
nal broke it open with its counterat
t;ick.
Finally, yesterday afternoon, what
Dettamanti thought was a tired Cardi
nal team slipped by UC-Santa Barbara
7-6, coming back from a 5-3 halftime
deficit.

one goal, and the weekend was further
evidence that no team's NCAA berth is
assured, as only five of the nation's
elite will be invited to the national
championships.

I he No. 3 Cardinal came out of the
weekend with only one loss in five
matches, including Friday's non
tournament contest at No. 10 UC-San
Diego. No. 2 UCLA, and No. 4 USC
also survived with only one loss.
Top-ranked California was the unof
ficial tournament champion with four
victories, although its wins did not
come easily. Ihe Bears had to go to
overtime in their first win. sudden
death overtime in their second win and
won their third game on a shot taken as
the game clock expired.
Despite the improvement in his
team's season record to 19-5 and only
one loss in five games, Dettamanti
could not say he was entirely pleased
with Stanford's play. "I'm not content.
I don't think the team is, either," he
said. "I don't think we're playing as
well as we can."
Friday at San Diego, the Cardinal
won I 1-5. Seven Stanford players
scored as the team jumped out to a 10-2
lead. Senior Grant Stanley led the way
with three goals, his first of two hat
tricks for the weekend.
Saturday, at Long Beach State's Bel
mont Arena, Stanford started off the
tournament on the wrong foot, losing H
-3 to No. 5 UC-Irvine. In two previous

meetings this season, the Cardinal had
defeated the Anteaters 10-9 and 5-4.
However, neither the Cardinal s of
fense nor its defense were in high gear
this time around.
"We just had a tough time scoring,
and their goalie (Mark Maizel) did a
good job," Dettamanti said. "We got
enough shots, we just had trouble put
ting the ball in the cage. . . . Our
defense didn't play too well either.
Irvine took advantage of each of our
defensive mistakes."
Against Irvine, Stanford scored on
only one of its seven 6-on-5 opportuni
ties. This inability to capitalize on
scoring opportunities came up again in
the next match, when No. 6 Long
Beach State paid for only two of the
eight advantages it gave the Cardinal.
Yesterday, Stanford played its best
game of the weekend to beat Pep
perdine 11-9. The match was close
through three quarters, but the Cardi
nal broke it open with its counterat
t;ick.
Finally, yesterday afternoon, what
Dettamanti thought was a tired Cardi
nal team slipped by UC-Santa Barbara
7-6, coming back from a 5-3 halftime
deficit.
