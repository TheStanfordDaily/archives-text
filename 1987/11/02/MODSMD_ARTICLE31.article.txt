# Card upends Texas A&M
## 
### Robert Partington Staff writer 
It was West vs. South Saturday at
Maloney Field, and the Stanford
women's soecer team won one for the
West, downing Texas A&M 2-0 to raise
its season mark to 4-10-3. The Aggies
finished the season with the loss, which
put their final record at 9-S-2.
Texas A&M coach Laura Johnston di
rected the South women's soccer team in
the Olympic Festival this past summer.
Stanford Coach Berhane Andeberhan
was at the helm of the West team. And
those two squads played for the champi
onship.
So Saturday's game was a rematch of
sorts. Andeberhan affirmed his top-notch
reputation with the victory.
"Stanford has one of the best coaches
in the country," Johnston said. "It was
just a matter of time before things came
together."
Saturday, things clicked right away for
the Cardinal. Freshman forward Jenny
Rowland scored on a breakaway five
minutes into the game. Senior midfielder
Amy Geisse made the assist.
"They (Texas A&M) had some trouble
with the quickness of our forwards,"
Andberhan said. "Jenny Rowland and
Lisa Sime have great speed."
Twenty minutes later sophomore for
ward Tonya Antonucci curved a free kick
around the Aggie wall to chalk up her

fourth goal of the season. The ball
squeezed between the fingers of Texas
A&M goalkeeper Missy Johnson and the
left post.
For the game, Stanford got off 17 shots
to the Aggies' 16. Freshman goalie Elise
Edwards made eight saves for Stanford to
Johnson's five. Stanford was hit with 10
fouls, while the Aggies had six.
The key to the victory was that the
Cardinal moved off the ball well, a
trademark of Andeberhan-coached
squads. Andeberhan was pleased with
the development of two themes he had
stressed in practice: team defense and po
sition offense.
"We got back to a helping, team
defense," Andeberhan said. "We also es
tablished position on offense before rush
ing ahead."
Practices last week were unusually
productive, and the good training carried
over to the game, according to Andeber
han.
"We worked on some specifics of de
fensive play," Antonucci said. "We tried
to reduce the confusion on defense and
improve communication."
The Stanford players were impressed
with the Aggies' tenacity, especially in
the second half, when the Cardinal failed
to add to its halftime bulge.
"They were predictable on offense, but
I was impressed with their defense," An
tonucci said. "They just didn't give up."
