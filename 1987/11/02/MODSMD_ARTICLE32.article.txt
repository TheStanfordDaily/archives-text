# Field hockey ties California, 0-0
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
Stanford's field hockey match
up with California Friday wasn't
really a must-win situation; it
was a must-not-lose situation.
And the Cardinal didn't lose.
It tied.
Stanford battled the Golden
Hears for 90 minutes Friday af
ternoon in Berkeley before the
two teams finished deadlocked at
0-0. The Cardinal is now 5-1-1 in
the Northern Pacific Conference
and shares the league lead with
San Jose State. The Bears are a
half game back at 4-1-2.
"I thought the team gave a
good effort," Stanford Coach
Sheryl Johnson said, "hut there
was so much pressure put on
them to win this game. I think

they held back a little bit and
didn't do all the things they are
capable of doing."
Again it was the Stanford of
fense that failed to come through
in the clutch. Despite several
good chances, the Cardinal was
shut out for the second con
secutive time. "We just couldn't
get the ball to go in," Johnson
said. "I don't know any better
wav to explain it."
The tie extended Stanford's
longest slump of the year. The
team is 1-2-1 in its last four games
and has only scored two goals
over that stretch. Although the
I3th-ranked Cardinal has been
playing against some difficult
competition, it certainly isn't
pleased with the lesults.
"We're a better team than our
recent record indicates," John

son said. "I'm just disappointed
that our hard work hasn't been
showing up in the final scores
lately."
The team's defensive effort,
however, does seem to be consis
tently reflected in the final score.
Over those last four disastrous
games, Stanford has only given
up two goals. Two goals,
however, is also the same num
ber it has scored. The Cardinal's
goals-against average has im
proved to a very respectable 0.66
on the year.
According to Johnson, Stan
ford's defensive performance
against Cal was "quite impres
sive." Despite Cal's 12 shots, the
Bears never had any clear oppor
tunities to score.
Stanford, on the other hand,
had only five shots on goal, but

had a variety of good opportuni
ties to score.
In failing to win Friday's game,
Stanford has taken its fate out of
its own hands. Although a vic
tory over Chico State today
would give the Cardinal at least a
share of the conference title,
there would be no assurance of
an NCAA tournament bid. That
all depends on the game between
( ;il and the Spartans Nov. 7.
Chico State comes into today's
game with only two conference
victories, both of them over
Pacific. But Stanford certainly
can't afford to overlook the
Cougars.
"We need to be cautious. We
can't take them lightly," Johnson
said. "We should definitely beat
them, though."
