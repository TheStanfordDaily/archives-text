## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The men's soccer team went
into the weekend hoping they
might still receive an NCAA
tournament hid. On Saturday,
those hopes all hut vanished.
The team s chances of re
ceiving an invitation for
postseason play took a severe
blow when the squad was
defeated 2-0 by league rival
Santa Clara. The loss on the
road dropped the team's
record to 8-8-3 overall, 2-2 in
Pacific Soccer Conference
play. The squad fell to second
place in the league standings,
behind San Francisco.
The talented Cardinal squad
did not squander the match, as
it had in past losses, but was
simply outplayed.
"Santa Clara played its best
game of the year," Stanford
Coach Sam Koch said. "They
played very well and deserved
to win."
Stanford was defeated by
Santa Clara's outstanding
defense. The Broncos not only
prevented the Cardinal from
taking many shots on goal, but
kept the squad off the Santa
Clara side of the field for the
majority of the contest. Stan

ford was not shut down com
pletely — midfielders Brian
Mahaffey and Luke Garrot
each had good shots on goal —
but the Cardinal was not able
to make anything of its limited
opportunities.
"Santa Clara played really
well defensively," Cardinal
defender Mark Semioli said.
"We had a lot of trouble get
ting the ball over midfield, es
pecially during the first half."
The first goal was scored
during the opening period on a
30-foot shot that hit the post
and bounced into the net.
Koch emphasized that the
defense was not outplayed and
that the strike was just an in
credible shot.
The Cardinal's offense did
not materialize until the final
20 minutes of the match. By
the time Stanford was able to
control the pace, move the ball
well and carry out its game
plan of switching fields
quickly, the Cardinal was
down 2-0 and unable to erase
the deficit in the time remain
ing.
"Our offense was never
given the space or time to
develop," Koch said. "The
Santa Clara defense did a good
job on us."
