# Alarm problems plague Phi Psi

### kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
An unidentified vandal broke
through a wire cage surround
ing a fire alarm at Phi Psi Fri
day night, triggering the house
alarm during the co-op's Hal
loween party, according to Phi
Psi Resident Assistant Elena
Eisenman.
The incident came after a
week of incidents of tampering
with the house's fire alarm. Al
most every day for the past
week, the fire alarm in the cel
lar of Phi Psi has been mysteri
ously shut down, according to
Eisenman. Phi Psi residents

could not identify the culprit
behind the tampering.
In a letter to Eisenman sent
last week. Row Manager Lucy
Williams described the fire
alarm problem as "a life
threatening situation . . . that
must be stopped immediately."
Responding to William's
statement, Eisenman had Row
maintenance build a protective
wire cage around the alarm to
prevent further tampering.
But at Friday's party a van
dal took a hammer, bashed the
lock on the cage and set off the
cellar's burglar alarm.
Stanford police and the
campus fire marshal arrived

about 15 minutes later, but no
one was apprehended.
"I am absolutely sure the
vandal is not a resident," Phi
Psi House Manager Humphrey
Gyde said.
Eisenman agreed that a resi
dent is probably not responsi
ble for the vandalism. "People
who live in glass houses don't
throw rocks at them. People
who live in wooden ones don't
turn off fire alarms," she said.
Before the party, Stanford's
fire marshal inspected Phi Psi
and determined that holding the
Friday night party in the attic
— its traditional site — would
pose too much of a fire hazard.
