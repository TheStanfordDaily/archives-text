I his is the third port in a series on the relation
ship between the Hoover Institution ami Stanford.

Conflict between the Hoover Institution and
Stanford University has occurred with almost
cyclical regularity for the past 25 years. Periods of
heightened tension follow times of relative tran
quility. The relationship, however, remains funda
mentally unchanged.

According to W. Glenn Campbell, director of
Hoover, controversy can he expected in a univer
sity like Stanford. Relations fluctuate "much like
the stock market or interest rates," Campbell said.
I o take the analogy one step further Hoover and
Stanford currently seem to be entering a period of
recovery, perhaps to be followed by future
prosperity. Just below the surface, however, lies
the ever-present potential for continued conflict.
At the core ol that potential controversy is the
question of partisanship.
Does the Hoover Institution, as an organization,
have a political mission? Is Hoover, in the words of
the 1985 Dornbusch Report on relations between

Hoover and Stanford, "commited as an institution
to conservative positions in domestic and interna
tional affiars"?
I he question of partisanship is complex and re
quires historical perspective as well as an under
standing of Hoover's fund-raising efforts. But in
the final analysis. Hoover s alleged partisanship
seems to he more a matter of perception than
reality — a perception cultivated primarily to elicit
tunds from conservative donors, according to
sources within both the Institution and the Univer
sity.
In 1959, the same year Hoover's quasi
independent status with Stanford was approved by
Stanford's Board of Trustees, Herbert Hoover also
outlined the mission of the Institution: "The pur
pose of this institution must be, by its research and
publications, to demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines ot Karl Marx — whether communism,
socialism, economic materialism or atheism — thus
to protect the American way of life from such
ideologies, their conspiracies and to reaffirm the
validity of the American system."
Although that doctrine has little to no influence
on the activities ot Hoover today, the uproar it
created has never died.
But a distinction must be made between individ
ual beliefs and institutional doctrines. The issue of
partisanship is not, as some would assume,
whether specific Hoover fellows espouse a certain
political philosophy. Rather, dispute arises when


V Delicate Balance
institutional ideology is
suspected.
Institutional ideology is,
however, a difficult concept to
guage and most certainly entails
more detailed analysis than sim
ply tallying the number of
Republicans and Democrats at
Hoover. And to many, the differ
ence between institutional ideol
ogy and individual ideology is a
distinction often blurred.
Individual ideology within
Hoover is not a contentious
issue. Very few people, in
Hoover or out, would differ with
Hoover senior fellow and
Emeritus Political Science Prof.
Robert Ward's statement that
Hoover is "more conservative
politically speaking than is . . .
the University."
"You can identify the political
bent of various think tanks
around the country, and if you
were to set up a spectrum of
them, it's quite true, of course,
that Hoover would fall on the
conservative side in an average
sort of sense," Ward said. "
Seymour Martin Lipset, pro
fessor of political science and
sociology and a senior research
fellow at Hoover, agreed.
"There's no question that the
administration at Hoover are al
most all ... conservative
Republicans," Lipset said.
But some critics maintain that
individual ideology is, in the case
of Hoover, indicative of a politi
cal mission. Political Science
Prof. John Manley, a harsh critic
of Hoover and its relationship
with Stanford, maintains that
Hoover is a partisan think tank
and that "universities [should]
not be dragged into partisan
politics," regardless of the politi
cal affiliation.
Arguing that Hoover appoin
tees are predominately conserva
tive, both on domestic issues and
in international affairs, Manley
said it "strains credulity that it is
an accident that all in Hoover

have similar beliefs."
Hoover defenders, both in the
Institution and in the University,
categorically deny such charges.
University President Donald
Kennedy said in a recent inter
view that people who hold that
Hoover has a political mission
"are a very, very small
minority."
"The [Faculty Senate] has ex
plicitly rejected that view," Ken
nedy said. "A committee that the
senate appointed under (Soc
iology Prof.) Sanford Dorn
busch's chairmanship reviewed
the relationship and did not come
to a finding of that sort. That is
not a generally held view and has
been generally rejected."

There is, of course, no
control whatsoever ex
ercised over the
freedom of inquiry of
Hoover scholars.'
— W. Glenn Campbell

Campbell, however, said that
Hoover "is an institution of un
usually distinguished scholars
with a wide variety of opinions
and views."
John Cogan, principal associ
ate director at Hoover, also
refutes the partisanship charge.
Hoover, he said, "never has and
never will have a political
agenda."
These denials, defenders say,
are supported by ample ev
idence. Initially, they claim that
there exists no pressure for
scholars to uphold certain politi
cal beliefs.
Campbell, in Hoover's 1986
annual report, explicitly makes
this point: "There is, of course,
no control whatsoever exercised
over the freedom of inquiry of
Hoover scholars. The Hoover In
stitution does not take policy

positions, and its scholars are
free to write, speak and testify on
any policy matter."
In addition, potential Hoover
appointees apparently do not
have to pass a political litmus
test. Observers point to the fact
that several prominent Hoover
scholars are not thought of as
conservative, including soci
ologists Lipset and Alex Inkeles,
political scientist John Ferejohn
and management expert James
March.
"There's a wide variety of
opinion within the Hoover Insti
tution itself, more so than I think
is generally recognized on
campus," Ward said.
The Dornbusch Report
reached a similar conclusion.
Although he emphasizes that
Hoover is not "overwhelmingly
of one stripe," Lipset admits that
political biases can affect the ap
pointment procedure.
"When people are making
judgements or appointments, of
ficially they only consider aca
demic judgement. But there
exists subjective things (which
influence these decisions), of
which political orientation is one
of them," he said.
However, if the absence of in
situtional ideology were as clear
as Hoover's defenders claim,
there would be little conflict be
tween Hoover and the Univer
sity. Yet charges continue to
surface from various members of
the faculty and student body.
The perception of the Hoover
appears to be markedly different
than the reality the defenders of
Hoover present. According to
sources both on and off campus,
this dichotomy is primarily due
to the nature of fund raising for
research institutions like
Hoover.
James Smith, the author of an
upcoming book on think tanks,
claims that "historically, the
money (going to public policy re
search institutions) has come
from conservative sources, in
cluding corporations, founda

tions and individuals."
Explaining the motives of cor
porations that contribute to such
institutions. Smith said, "The big
corporations try to bolster the
idea of a free market and of free
enterprise."
According to Hoover's 1986
annual report, individual, foun
dation and corporate gifts totaled
$4.8 million, or 38 percent of
Hoover's revenue last year. The
rest came primarily from Univer
sity funds and endowment earn
ings.
Many of the individuals and or
ganizations that contribute large
amounts of money to Hoover are
politically conservative.
Additionally, the prominence
of conservative scholars like
Martin Anderson and Milton
Friedman bolsters the image of
the Institution among conserva
tives.
Jack Brauntuch, executive di
rector of the JM Foundation, a
research institution that concen
trates primarily on public policy
issues related to health care,
maintained that attempting to se
cure funds for an organization is
something akin to selling a prod
uct. Naturally, Brauntuch said,
an institution will use its "best

points to bolster the chance of re
ceiving money."
By Brauntuch's reasoning,
therefore, it makes sense for
Hoover to play up its conser
vatism to potential donors.
The president of the Institute
for Educational Affairs (lEA),
Leslie Lenkowsky, agreed.
"Everybody does different
things to raise money," he said.
"This is called making ends
meet."
The JM Foundation and the
lEA have, in the past, contrib
uted money to Hoover.
The fund-raising issue is also,
perhaps, the key to answering
the question of whether or not
Hoover is institutionally biased.
"The argument (that Hoover is
politically biased), it seems to
me, is based on allusions to the
writings of a few Hoover people
who have asserted positions
about [Hoover's] national politi
cal agenda," Kennedy said. "We
are invited to believe by implica
tion that those are in fact posi
tions . . . held broadly by
Hoover scholars." .
Those pronouncements, con
cluded Kennedy, do not repre
sent what their advocates say
they do.

Sources both in the Hoover In
stitution and in the Unversity
who asked not to be identified
agreed that the issue of raising
money plays a crucial role in the
image Hoover portrays.
This would also explain the
frequency with which President
Ronald Reagan, an honorary fel
low at Hoover since 1975, ap
pears in Hoover's annual
reports. Reagan's close ties to
Hoover, and the relatively large
number of Hoover scholars who
have served in the Reagan ad
ministration, cannot help but aid
in fund raising. "Reagan is our
president — good, bad or indif
ferent," Brauntuch said.
Cultivating this conservative
image does, to be certain, have
costs. It has engendered mistrust
and suspicion between the two
institutions and has been at the
root of much of the recent con
flict.
This conflict, many argue, dis
rupts the normal operations of
the University and Hoover. In
addition, the continued percep
tion of institutional ideology will
undoubtedly influence the con
tinuing evolution of the relation
ship between Hoover and Stan
ford.
