I his is the third port in a series on the relation
ship between the Hoover Institution ami Stanford.

Conflict between the Hoover Institution and
Stanford University has occurred with almost
cyclical regularity for the past 25 years. Periods of
heightened tension follow times of relative tran
quility. The relationship, however, remains funda
mentally unchanged.

According to W. Glenn Campbell, director of
Hoover, controversy can he expected in a univer
sity like Stanford. Relations fluctuate "much like
the stock market or interest rates," Campbell said.
I o take the analogy one step further Hoover and
Stanford currently seem to be entering a period of
recovery, perhaps to be followed by future
prosperity. Just below the surface, however, lies
the ever-present potential for continued conflict.
At the core ol that potential controversy is the
question of partisanship.
Does the Hoover Institution, as an organization,
have a political mission? Is Hoover, in the words of
the 1985 Dornbusch Report on relations between

Hoover and Stanford, "commited as an institution
to conservative positions in domestic and interna
tional affiars"?
I he question of partisanship is complex and re
quires historical perspective as well as an under
standing of Hoover's fund-raising efforts. But in
the final analysis. Hoover s alleged partisanship
seems to he more a matter of perception than
reality — a perception cultivated primarily to elicit
tunds from conservative donors, according to
sources within both the Institution and the Univer
sity.
In 1959, the same year Hoover's quasi
independent status with Stanford was approved by
Stanford's Board of Trustees, Herbert Hoover also
outlined the mission of the Institution: "The pur
pose of this institution must be, by its research and
publications, to demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines ot Karl Marx — whether communism,
socialism, economic materialism or atheism — thus
to protect the American way of life from such
ideologies, their conspiracies and to reaffirm the
validity of the American system."
Although that doctrine has little to no influence
on the activities ot Hoover today, the uproar it
created has never died.
But a distinction must be made between individ
ual beliefs and institutional doctrines. The issue of
partisanship is not, as some would assume,
whether specific Hoover fellows espouse a certain
political philosophy. Rather, dispute arises when
