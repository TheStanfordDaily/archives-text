# January trip planned
## BSU to register voters in South 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
In an effort reminiscient of
1960s student-led voter registra
tion drives in the Deep South, the
Black Student Union may send a
delegation of as many as 30-50
students to Georgia and Alabama
in January for 10 days to register
black voters.
According to BSU member
Amanda Kemp, the goal of
"Project Democracy," is to "re
kindle commitment to black po
litical power in the South."
where 53 percent of the U.S.
black population lives. The proj
ect, which will be supervised by
the New South Coalition and the
Voter Education Project, is
scheduled to occur during the
first week of winter quarter and
coincide with Martin Luther
Kine Jr.'s birthday.
The BSU estimates that the
cross-country journey will cost
$19,300. Kemp said. This in

eludes round-trip airline tickets
to Georgia, housing, telephone
ealls between Stanford and Geor
gia and ground transportation.
According to BSU chair Bill
King, a University trustee whom
he declined to name has already
pledged a "significant" amount
of money to the project. King
said this pledge will guarantee
that at least six students will
make the trip in January.
"There's definitely money for
halt a dozen people to go," King
said."The project will be suc
cessful."
According to Kemp, the proj
ect also hopes to receive funding
from major organizations and
foundations nationwide, such as
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP).
Project organizers hope to
have "some kind of impact on
the Super Tuesday primaries,"
Kemp said. Super Tuesday is
March 8, 1988, when 14 Southern
and border states will hold presi
dential primaries.
"We feel that blacks need to
unite if we ever want to have a
say in the country's politics,"
said Karen Sanders, a BSU
member working on the project.
Historically, efforts of stu
dents to register Southern blacks
to vote began in earnest in the
summer of 1964, when hundreds
of college students participated
in a mass voter registration effort
in Mississippi. In 1965 Congress
passed the Voting Rights Act,
which abolished various racially
discriminatory voting require
ments that had effectively dis

enfranchised most blacks.
Partially as a result of this act
and the subsequent registration
drives, black elected officials
have increased from less than 3(H)
in 1965 to more than 6000 today,
according to the BSU.
Kemp said impediments to
voter registration continue in the
South. Gerrymandering, at-large
elections and "physical intimida
tion and harassment all serve as
barriers to blacks participating in
the political process," she said.
In the past, voter registration has
been a "deadly activity," Kemp
said.
Both Kemp and Sanders noted
that citizens' ignorance and the
inconvenience of registering to
vote are factors contributing to a
high rate of black non
registration in the South. There
are 3,669,388 unregistered black
voters id the South, Kemp said.

Kemp explained that in Geor
gia, still a largely rural state,
citizens must register to vote at
the county seat office during
working hours. She said this
makes it difficult for working
class people to register.
"Voter registration laws were
not meant to encourage registra
tion of poor people and black
people in the South."
In addition to helping blacks
register, the students will be
talking with Southern leaders to
try to "get a sense of conditions
there and to see what kind of im
pact we, as students, can have,"
Kemp said. "It's a public ser
vice, as well as an educational
type thing."
Kemp acknowledged that Proj
ect Democracy is aimed
primarily at black students, but
said that is because it is a project
of the BSU.
