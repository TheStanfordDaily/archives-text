## BSU to register voters in South 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
In an effort reminiscient of
1960s student-led voter registra
tion drives in the Deep South, the
Black Student Union may send a
delegation of as many as 30-50
students to Georgia and Alabama
in January for 10 days to register
black voters.
According to BSU member
Amanda Kemp, the goal of
"Project Democracy," is to "re
kindle commitment to black po
litical power in the South."
where 53 percent of the U.S.
black population lives. The proj
ect, which will be supervised by
the New South Coalition and the
Voter Education Project, is
scheduled to occur during the
first week of winter quarter and
coincide with Martin Luther
Kine Jr.'s birthday.
The BSU estimates that the
cross-country journey will cost
$19,300. Kemp said. This in

eludes round-trip airline tickets
to Georgia, housing, telephone
ealls between Stanford and Geor
gia and ground transportation.
According to BSU chair Bill
King, a University trustee whom
he declined to name has already
pledged a "significant" amount
of money to the project. King
said this pledge will guarantee
that at least six students will
make the trip in January.
"There's definitely money for
halt a dozen people to go," King
said."The project will be suc
cessful."
According to Kemp, the proj
ect also hopes to receive funding
from major organizations and
foundations nationwide, such as
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP).
Project organizers hope to
have "some kind of impact on
the Super Tuesday primaries,"
