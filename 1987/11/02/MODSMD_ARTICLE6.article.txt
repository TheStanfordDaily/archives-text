# Commencement decision nears
## Kennedy given list of 10 speakers 
### Leslie Hatamiya Staff writer 
I he speaker for Commence
ment next June has not yet been
selected, but members of the se
lection committee last week sub
mitted a list of 10 names of possi
ble speakers to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
Members of the committee last
night declined to release any of
the 10 names on the final list.
L.ast Wednesday Kennedy
confirmed that Stanford would
be willing to play host to a visit
by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev if he should visit the United
States for arms control talks, but
no members of the committee
would confirm that Kennedy's
statement was related to the pos
sibility of Gorbachev speaking at
graduation.
Two years ago, the University
issued an invitation to Gorba
chev to speak at Stanford. Soviet
officials declined the offer, citing
the fact that Gorbachev's plans
to visit the United States for
arms control talks had fallen

through.
I he 12-member selection com
mittee of seniors, graduate stu
dents. faculty and staff members
sent an unranked list of possibili
ties to Kennedy about a week
ago after polling the senior class
for the type of speaker it would
like to hear, said Senior Class
President Stacey Estrella, a
member of the committee.
fo avoid a "difficult and em
barrassing situation" for the Uni
versity and the eventual gradua
tion speaker, the committee will
not announce the selected
speaker until he or she has ac
cepted Kennedy's invitation, ac
cording to Dean of the Chapel
Robert Gregg, a member of the
selection committee.
Estrella said the recommenda
tions to Kennedy included a list
of "strong, well-reputable
names."
I think the senior class will be
excited about anyone on the
list, she said.
In 1956, committee members
disclosed the list of potential
speakers before the selected
speaker had accepted the Uni
versity's invitation. Ted Koppel,
anchor of ABC's "Nightline,"
eventually spoke at graduation
that year, but only after televi
sion actor Bill Cosby and Gorba

chev both declined invitations.
According to some observers,
this series of rejections embar
rassed Stanford and potential
speakers.
"If you're negotiating with a
potential speaker, and that per
son can't tit it into his schedule
and the word gets out, the next
person asked will find out that
he's the second or third choice,"
Gregg said.
In compiling the list, the com

mittee "tried to pick different
categories of people and then did
research on the possible
speakers' speaking abilities,"
said Marlene Wine, special assis
tant to the president and chair
person of the committee.
It is Kennedy's decision
whether or not to invite one of
the people on the list, and if so,
which one and, if more than one
speaker needs to be invited, in
what order. According to

Estrella, when the University
releases the name of the Com
mencement speaker will depend
on "how quickly Kennedy
chooses and invites the person
and when that person accepts."
In past years, names on the list
recommended to the President
have included former news
anchor Walter Cronkite, South
African Bishop Desmond Tutu
and President Ronald Reagan.
