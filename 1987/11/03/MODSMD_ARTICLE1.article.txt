Overseas Studies officials will
conduct a fact-finding mission in
Latin America next month to
help choose the site for a Stan
ford campus there.
Edmundo Fuenzalida, aca
demic program officer for Over
seas Studies, will make the trip to
discuss options with officials in
Buenos Aires, Argentina and
Santiago, Chile â€” the two sites
named by Overseas Studies this
summer as the top choices for a
Latin American campus. Offi
cials will also visit Caracas,
Venezuela, and Quito, Ecuador,
both of which are possible back
up sites.
"Our focus will be on the
[Buenos Aires and Santiago]
sites, but we could easily go
there and find out for political or
other reasons that it won't work
out," said Thomas Heller, direc
tor of Overseas Studies.
Heller said he and one other
person will join Fuenzalida on
the trip "if we (the department)
can afford that."
"Right now we are in the plan
ning stage," said Nancy Padgett,
