# Latin campus plans progress

Overseas Studies officials will
conduct a fact-finding mission in
Latin America next month to
help choose the site for a Stan
ford campus there.
Edmundo Fuenzalida, aca
demic program officer for Over
seas Studies, will make the trip to
discuss options with officials in
Buenos Aires, Argentina and
Santiago, Chile â€” the two sites
named by Overseas Studies this
summer as the top choices for a
Latin American campus. Offi
cials will also visit Caracas,
Venezuela, and Quito, Ecuador,
both of which are possible back
up sites.
"Our focus will be on the
[Buenos Aires and Santiago]
sites, but we could easily go
there and find out for political or
other reasons that it won't work
out," said Thomas Heller, direc
tor of Overseas Studies.
Heller said he and one other
person will join Fuenzalida on
the trip "if we (the department)
can afford that."
"Right now we are in the plan
ning stage," said Nancy Padgett,
deputy director of Overseas
Studies. "We are running pilot
programs. Last summer there
was a pilot program in Mexico,
and we are evaluating the experi
ences," she said.
"At each stage of planning we

get new information which leads
us to reconsider our options,"
Padgett said. "We have to con
sider the quality of the faculty, li
brary resources, housing accom
modations as well as the cultural
infrastructure . . . the political
and economic stability."
Padgett said the Overseas
Studies Office does not want the
new program to be located in
Mexico, where the University
has run several programs in the

past.
The funding for the project will
probably not come exclusively
from the University. "Our fund
ing requests compete with
equally worthy projects,"
Padgett said. "We have also re
quested funds for overseas
campuses in Kyoto (Japan) and
Poland. The University has
asked us to find seed money, and
the combination should help us
fund the project."
