## DATELINE 
### 
Ginsburg had conflict of interest
WASHINGTON — While he was a high-ranking Justice De
partment official. Supreme Court nominee Douglas Ginsburg
argued against regulations opposed by the cable television in
dustry and supervised a major departmental investigation into
the industry when he had almost $140,000 invested in a cable
television company, according to public documents and Justice
Department lawyers.
As head of the antitrust division, Ginsburg argued against pro
posed Federal Communications Commission regulations that
would require cable operators to carry certain channels and
limit the number of cable systems a particular company can
own.
He also supervised the antitrust division's investigation into
whether cable companies conspired to force pay cable channels,
such as Home Box Office, to scramble their signals so that
satellite dish owners could not intercept them. The investigation
is still technically open, but lawyers familiar with the inquiry
said they did not expect action to be taken against the compan
ies.
Ginsburg owned more than 9000 shares of stock in Rogers
Communications Inc., a Toronto-based cable television com
pany, when he was nominated to become a federal appeals court
judge here, according to a questionnaire filed with the Senate
Judiciary Committee last year.
Ginsburg, who has since sold the stock, apparently held the
investment in Rogers when he joined the Justice Department as
a deputy assistant attorney general in 1983. At that time, he indi
cated he would disqualify himself from "all matters" in which
the company is "directly affected."
Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland yesterday
declined comment on Ginsburg's participation in decisions af
fecting the cable industry .
USSR marks 70tli anniversary
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikail Gorbachev, in a major
speech delivered yesterday on the eve of the 70th anniversary of
the Russian Revolution, accused Joseph Stalin of "enormous
and unforgivable" crimes, but stopped short of a full-scale
denunciation of the dictator whose policies and purges are
widely believed to have caused the deaths of millions of Soviets.
In the 2-hour-and-41 -minute speech, Gorbachev also
criticized those who are trying either to block his reforms out of
fear or to implement them too quickly out of impatience. He
pledged to work "unremittingly" for a "palpable
breakthrough" on strategic and space-based nuclear arms nego
tiations with the United States.
Gorbachev acknowledged that "perestroika," or his cam
paign of economic and political restructuring, had put "growing
pressure" on society. He referred both to "the resistance of the
conservative forces that see 'perestroika' simply as a threat to
their selfish interests and objectives" and to those who
"succumb to the pressure of the overly zealous and impatient.
"It should be clear that one cannot leap over essential stages
and try to accomplish everything at one go," he said, in appar
ent reference to the recent high-level dispute over Boris Yeltsin,
the Moscow party chief who reportedly criticized the party lead
ership for moving too slowly to implement some of Gorbachev's
programs.
Soviets release reduction figures
NEW YORK — The Soviet Union has officially informed the
Reagan administration that it would eliminate six times more
medium-range missiles than the United States when the ex
pected treaty banning those weapons goes into effect, National
Security Adviser Frank Carlucci said yesterday.
That estimated reduction in the Soviet intermediate-range ar
senal was more than the roughly 4-1 ratio that U.S. experts had
estimated based on intelligence gathered through reconnais
sance satellites.
"Frankly, it was a higher number than we anticipated they
would give us," Carlucci told a Council on Foreign Relations
meeting here. Under the intermediate-range nuclear missile
agreement now proposed, each side would eliminate all missiles
with ranges between 300 and 3000 miles.
The 6-1 missile reduction, made by Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze during his visit last week to Washington,
was the first formal disclosure of weapons data of this type
during the arms control process. Carlucci cited this "data ex
change" as an example of the "decidedly new tone" in U.S.-
Soviet relations in recent weeks.
Stock market rises in light trading
NEW YORK — The stock market ground out its fifth straight
gain yesterday in a relatively light trading session that carried
the Dow Jones industrial average to 2014.09, up 20.56 points.
Investors traded 176.04 million shares yesterday, compared
to Friday's trading volume of 303.36 million shares.
It was the first string of five advancing sessions since July.
"A lot of people are calling this a sucker's rally," said Ed
ward J. Nicoski, market strategist at the Piper, Jaffray & Hop
wood brokerage in Minneapolis. "But maybe it means there will
be an element of stability in the market for a while, at least."
Separately, negotiators for several securities exchanges tried
to avert a threatened strike by holding talks with representatives
of about 1300 clerical workers. And the New York Stock Ex
change announced that one of its smaller firms. Pace Securities
of New York, had ceased doing business as a member broker
dealer because it no longer met the Big Board's capital require
ments.
Some investors approached the day's trading with under
standable apprehension, since last week's Monday session
drove the Dow to a 156-point drop, and a week earlier was the
historic 508-point drop. But the market righted itself after a a 30-
point slide in the first hour of trading, then drifted upward for
the remainder of the shortened trading session.
Demos impatient about tax talks
WASHINGTON — Key Democrats suggested yesterday that
the administration has backed away from its promise to consider
proposals for a tax increase, as the White House's second week
of deficit-reduction negotiations with Congress got off to a slow
start.
"My feeling is that there still must be a demonstration of good
faith by the administration," House Speaker Jim Wright (D-
Texas) said. "I had thought the situation of the stock market
crash would have awakened him (President Reagan) to the ne
cessity of . . . real, honest-to-God negotiations.
Although they couched their delicately worded complaints in
expressions of continued optimism about the talks, Wright and
other leading congressional Democrats made it clear that they
are growing impatient as the administration continues to turn
aside proposals for higher taxes.

USSR marks 70tli anniversary
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikail Gorbachev, in a major
speech delivered yesterday on the eve of the 70th anniversary of
the Russian Revolution, accused Joseph Stalin of "enormous
and unforgivable" crimes, but stopped short of a full-scale
denunciation of the dictator whose policies and purges are
widely believed to have caused the deaths of millions of Soviets.
In the 2-hour-and-41 -minute speech, Gorbachev also
criticized those who are trying either to block his reforms out of
fear or to implement them too quickly out of impatience. He
pledged to work "unremittingly" for a "palpable
breakthrough" on strategic and space-based nuclear arms nego
tiations with the United States.
Gorbachev acknowledged that "perestroika," or his cam
paign of economic and political restructuring, had put "growing
pressure" on society. He referred both to "the resistance of the
conservative forces that see 'perestroika' simply as a threat to
their selfish interests and objectives" and to those who
"succumb to the pressure of the overly zealous and impatient.
"It should be clear that one cannot leap over essential stages
and try to accomplish everything at one go," he said, in appar
ent reference to the recent high-level dispute over Boris Yeltsin,
the Moscow party chief who reportedly criticized the party lead
ership for moving too slowly to implement some of Gorbachev's
programs.
Soviets release reduction figures
NEW YORK — The Soviet Union has officially informed the
Reagan administration that it would eliminate six times more
medium-range missiles than the United States when the ex
pected treaty banning those weapons goes into effect, National
Security Adviser Frank Carlucci said yesterday.
That estimated reduction in the Soviet intermediate-range ar
senal was more than the roughly 4-1 ratio that U.S. experts had
estimated based on intelligence gathered through reconnais
sance satellites.
"Frankly, it was a higher number than we anticipated they
would give us," Carlucci told a Council on Foreign Relations
meeting here. Under the intermediate-range nuclear missile
agreement now proposed, each side would eliminate all missiles
with ranges between 300 and 3000 miles.
The 6-1 missile reduction, made by Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze during his visit last week to Washington,
was the first formal disclosure of weapons data of this type
during the arms control process. Carlucci cited this "data ex
change" as an example of the "decidedly new tone" in U.S.-
Soviet relations in recent weeks.
Stock market rises in light trading
NEW YORK — The stock market ground out its fifth straight
gain yesterday in a relatively light trading session that carried
the Dow Jones industrial average to 2014.09, up 20.56 points.
Investors traded 176.04 million shares yesterday, compared
to Friday's trading volume of 303.36 million shares.
It was the first string of five advancing sessions since July.
"A lot of people are calling this a sucker's rally," said Ed
ward J. Nicoski, market strategist at the Piper, Jaffray & Hop
wood brokerage in Minneapolis. "But maybe it means there will
be an element of stability in the market for a while, at least."
Separately, negotiators for several securities exchanges tried
to avert a threatened strike by holding talks with representatives
of about 1300 clerical workers. And the New York Stock Ex
change announced that one of its smaller firms. Pace Securities
of New York, had ceased doing business as a member broker
dealer because it no longer met the Big Board's capital require
ments.
Some investors approached the day's trading with under
standable apprehension, since last week's Monday session
drove the Dow to a 156-point drop, and a week earlier was the
historic 508-point drop. But the market righted itself after a a 30-
point slide in the first hour of trading, then drifted upward for
the remainder of the shortened trading session.
Demos impatient about tax talks
WASHINGTON — Key Democrats suggested yesterday that
the administration has backed away from its promise to consider
proposals for a tax increase, as the White House's second week
of deficit-reduction negotiations with Congress got off to a slow
start.
"My feeling is that there still must be a demonstration of good
faith by the administration," House Speaker Jim Wright (D-
Texas) said. "I had thought the situation of the stock market
crash would have awakened him (President Reagan) to the ne
cessity of . . . real, honest-to-God negotiations.
Although they couched their delicately worded complaints in
expressions of continued optimism about the talks, Wright and
other leading congressional Democrats made it clear that they
are growing impatient as the administration continues to turn
aside proposals for higher taxes.

Ginsburg had conflict of interest
WASHINGTON — While he was a high-ranking Justice De
partment official. Supreme Court nominee Douglas Ginsburg
argued against regulations opposed by the cable television in
dustry and supervised a major departmental investigation into
the industry when he had almost $140,000 invested in a cable
television company, according to public documents and Justice
Department lawyers.
As head of the antitrust division, Ginsburg argued against pro
posed Federal Communications Commission regulations that
would require cable operators to carry certain channels and
limit the number of cable systems a particular company can
own.
He also supervised the antitrust division's investigation into
whether cable companies conspired to force pay cable channels,
such as Home Box Office, to scramble their signals so that
satellite dish owners could not intercept them. The investigation
is still technically open, but lawyers familiar with the inquiry
said they did not expect action to be taken against the compan
ies.
Ginsburg owned more than 9000 shares of stock in Rogers
Communications Inc., a Toronto-based cable television com
pany, when he was nominated to become a federal appeals court
judge here, according to a questionnaire filed with the Senate
Judiciary Committee last year.
Ginsburg, who has since sold the stock, apparently held the
investment in Rogers when he joined the Justice Department as
a deputy assistant attorney general in 1983. At that time, he indi
