WASHINGTON — Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger
has decided to resign because of
the deteriorating health of his
wife, Jane, and President Reagan
is expected to name National Se
curity Adviser Frank Carlucci as
the new defense secretary, ad
ministration officials said last
night.

The president is also consider
ing appointing Army Lt. Gen.
Colin Powell, the deputy national
security adviser, to succeed Car
lucci, the officials said. Before
coming to the White House,
Powell served as military assis
tant to Weinberger.
The officials said an announce
ment of the changes may come as
soon as today, when Reagan is
planning to announce a new sec
retary of labor. Weinberger,
whose wife is suffering from can
cer and severe arthritis, was un
available for comment last night
after a report on his plans by
NBC News. Two weeks ago,
asked about another news report
that he planned to resign,
Weinberger dismissed it as "the
same reports" of resignation that
persisted in earlier years.
Weinberger, 70, has held a
powerful seat in Reagan's
Cabinet, enhanced in part by his
long personal relationship with
the president and his easy access
to the Oval Office. As defense

secretary, Weinberger served as
a strong advocate for Reagan's
ambitious $2 trillion rearmament
program, even in the face of
growing pressure for cutbacks
from a Congress worried about
the deficit.
Aided by former Assistant
Secretary Richard Perle,
Weinberger was also a frequent
opponent of arms control
proposals advocated by Secre
tary of State George Shultz, and
he was particularly forceful in
resisting limits on the president's
missile defense program, the
Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI).
While officials said Wein
berger's departure is not the
result of pressure from within the
administration, it may presage a
new approach to arms control in
the final year of Reagan's
presidency. Carlucci, who previ
ously served as deputy defense
secretary under Weinberger, is
known within the administration
as a more pragmatic and flexible
policymaker than Weinberger on
arms control issues.
The shift comes at a critical
time as Reagan makes final
preparations for signing a treaty
next month with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev eliminating
medium-range and shorter-range
missiles in Europe. The agree
ment is the first major arms con
trol treaty of Reagan's
presidency and is to be signed at
the first U.S.-Soviet summit in
this country since 1973
Even more important, Reagan

and Gorbachev appear to be
heading toward an intensified pe
riod of bargaining over strategic
nuclear weapons that could lead
next year to an agreement cutting
these arsenals in half. A critical
factor in such an accord is
whether Reagan will agree to
flexibility in plans to deploy SDI,
a space-based missile defense
system popularly known as "Star
Wars." Weinberger has
repeatedly refused to accept
restraints that would slow down
the program, now in the research
phase, and he oversaw a major
expansion in its spending.
Close acquaintances said Jane
Weinberger's health has been
deteriorating steadily in recent
months. She recently completed
a series of radiation treatments
for the malignancy and has had
persistent problems with arthritis
that occasionally has left her
bedridden, they said.
The couple, who celebrated
their 45th wedding anniversary in
August, recently sold their
massive residence in McLean,
Va., and moved into a two-suite
accommodation at the Watergate
apartments in downtown Wash
ington because they could not in
stall an elevator for her in the
McLean house, acquaintances
said.
For at least the past year, Jane
Weinberger has spent most of her
time at the couple's Bar Harbor,
Maine, home while her husband
remained in Washington. Jane
Weinberger, who writes
children's books and runs a small

publishing company, has
shunned the Washington political
and social circuit that her hus
band relishes, and tried to per
suade him to turn down the offer
for a second term as defense sec
retary, according to friends.
"She has always wanted him
to leave the job," said one ac
quaintance.
If Weinberger remained in of
fice until next March, he would
surpass Robert McNamara as the
longest-serving defense secre
tary.
"I'm surprised he's leaving
before passing the mark
McNamara made," said one
close acquaintance. "He's never
said that was a goal, but he has
enough interest in his place in
history to have served out the full
(second) term."
In Monterey, Calif., a Penta
gon spokesman, Fred Hoffman,
said "no comment" when asked
about Weinberger's resignation.
When reports of Weinberger's
potential resignation surfaced
two weeks ago, Hoffman vehe
mently denied the reports, calling
news organizations to refute a
CBS News broadcast even
before it aired.
Weinberger arrived in Mon
terey yesterday with his wife and
held a news conference devoted
to the new medium-range missile
treaty. Then he conferred infor
mally with defense ministers
from the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization who are meeting
there.

Powell served as military assis
tant to Weinberger.
The officials said an announce
ment of the changes may come as
soon as today, when Reagan is
planning to announce a new sec
retary of labor. Weinberger,
whose wife is suffering from can
cer and severe arthritis, was un
available for comment last night
after a report on his plans by
NBC News. Two weeks ago,
asked about another news report
that he planned to resign,
Weinberger dismissed it as "the
same reports" of resignation that
persisted in earlier years.
Weinberger, 70, has held a
powerful seat in Reagan's
Cabinet, enhanced in part by his
long personal relationship with
the president and his easy access
to the Oval Office. As defense

secretary, Weinberger served as
a strong advocate for Reagan's
ambitious $2 trillion rearmament
program, even in the face of
growing pressure for cutbacks
from a Congress worried about
the deficit.
Aided by former Assistant
Secretary Richard Perle,
Weinberger was also a frequent
opponent of arms control
proposals advocated by Secre
tary of State George Shultz, and
he was particularly forceful in
resisting limits on the president's
missile defense program, the
Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI).
While officials said Wein
berger's departure is not the
result of pressure from within the
administration, it may presage a
new approach to arms control in
the final year of Reagan's
presidency. Carlucci, who previ
ously served as deputy defense
secretary under Weinberger, is
known within the administration
as a more pragmatic and flexible
policymaker than Weinberger on
arms control issues.
The shift comes at a critical
time as Reagan makes final
preparations for signing a treaty
next month with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev eliminating
medium-range and shorter-range
missiles in Europe. The agree
ment is the first major arms con
trol treaty of Reagan's
presidency and is to be signed at
the first U.S.-Soviet summit in
this country since 1973
Even more important, Reagan

and Gorbachev appear to be
heading toward an intensified pe
riod of bargaining over strategic
nuclear weapons that could lead
next year to an agreement cutting
these arsenals in half. A critical
factor in such an accord is
whether Reagan will agree to
flexibility in plans to deploy SDI,
a space-based missile defense
system popularly known as "Star
Wars." Weinberger has
repeatedly refused to accept
restraints that would slow down
the program, now in the research
phase, and he oversaw a major
expansion in its spending.
Close acquaintances said Jane
Weinberger's health has been
deteriorating steadily in recent
months. She recently completed
a series of radiation treatments
for the malignancy and has had
persistent problems with arthritis
that occasionally has left her
bedridden, they said.
The couple, who celebrated
their 45th wedding anniversary in
August, recently sold their
massive residence in McLean,
Va., and moved into a two-suite
accommodation at the Watergate
apartments in downtown Wash
ington because they could not in
stall an elevator for her in the
McLean house, acquaintances
said.
For at least the past year, Jane
Weinberger has spent most of her
time at the couple's Bar Harbor,
Maine, home while her husband
remained in Washington. Jane
Weinberger, who writes
children's books and runs a small

publishing company, has
shunned the Washington political
and social circuit that her hus
band relishes, and tried to per
suade him to turn down the offer
for a second term as defense sec
retary, according to friends.
"She has always wanted him
to leave the job," said one ac
quaintance.
If Weinberger remained in of
fice until next March, he would
surpass Robert McNamara as the
longest-serving defense secre
tary.
"I'm surprised he's leaving
before passing the mark
McNamara made," said one
close acquaintance. "He's never
said that was a goal, but he has
enough interest in his place in
history to have served out the full
(second) term."
In Monterey, Calif., a Penta
gon spokesman, Fred Hoffman,
said "no comment" when asked
about Weinberger's resignation.
When reports of Weinberger's
potential resignation surfaced
two weeks ago, Hoffman vehe
mently denied the reports, calling
news organizations to refute a
CBS News broadcast even
before it aired.
Weinberger arrived in Mon
terey yesterday with his wife and
held a news conference devoted
to the new medium-range missile
treaty. Then he conferred infor
mally with defense ministers
from the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization who are meeting
there.
