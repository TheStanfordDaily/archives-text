# Integrate Arabs, Israeli urges
## 
### Jason Bloomstein 
Arabs living in Israel have in
terior technology, educational
systems, public services and job
opportunities compared to the
Jewish people there, an Israeli
government official said yester
day in a speech at Larkin Hall.
Raymond Jubran, an adviser in
the Israeli Ministry of Economic
Planning, Development and In
dustrialization, said Arabs need
' a smoother path toward integra
tion into economic, political, ed
ucational and technological
aspects of Israeli society to
remedy their disadvantages.
He said the economic prob
lems should be worked out first,
because "if the economy of a
region is in good shape, the rest
of the problems can be worked
out easily."
One obstacle to economic ad
vancement in Arab regions is the
lack of opportunity for industrial
and high-technological develop
ment, Jubran said. According to
Jubran, of the 14,000 Arab
graduates from Israeli univer
sities in the past three years, the
K to 12 percent specializing in en
gineering fields have a great deal
of difficulty in finding jobs in
their skill areas.
He attributed this difficulty
mainly to the Israeli govern
ment's past failures to involve
Arabs in economic activity.
"The Israelis built their state
without taking into consideration
having Arabs as partners," he

said.
Jubran said Israel has not held
Arabs in high esteem because the
Jewish state "cannot look up to
the surrounding Arab coun
tries," such as Lebanon, Syria,
Iran and Iraq,
Jubran said Israel does not dis
criminate against Arabs. He said
that all Arabs are citizens and
have the same rights as Jews un
der the Israeli constitution.
He also said Israel is currently
attempting to develop several
Arab regions economically. The
Federation of Labor Unions,

which controls much of Israel's
major industry and provides
health and welfare services to
communities, is working together
with Arabs to create industry in
Arab sections of Israel. This new
industry is to be managed by
Arabs, create employment for all
religious groups and export prod
ucts overseas to improve the Is
raeli economy.
Jubran spoke here at the invi
tation of Stanford junior Marshall
SchifT, chair of the Israel Action
Committee of the Hillel Founda
tion.
