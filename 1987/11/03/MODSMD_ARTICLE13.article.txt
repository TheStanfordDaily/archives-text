### Sky Gallegos 
Three speakers taking part in
a civil rights panel discussion
yeterday at the Career Planning
and Placement Center urged
students interested in public
service careers to gain practical
experience while in college.
The discussion, part of a
year-long series of programs on
public service presented by the
CPPC, included representa
tives from the Hast Palo Alto
City Council, the Asian Law
Alliance and the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA.
Rueben Abrica, a member of
the East Palo Alto City Coun
cil, said that deciding on a spe
cific career is not as important
as a commitment to public ser
vice.
"If you dedicate something

of your life to social change,
this will lead you to different
careers," Abrica said. "I don't
think there's a direct correla
tion between career and the im
pact you can have."
Angelo Ancheta, a staff at
torney for the Asian Law Alli
ance, said he believes the best
training for the Stanford stu
dent is to start thinking about
issues and problems early.
"Get involved. Work for issues
on campus as well as in the
community," Ancheta said.
Being a civil rights lawyer in
volves a great deal of work
outside the courtroom, he said,
and students interested in civil
rights law should gain experi
ence in political activism as
well.
Kay Phillips, a past execu

tive director of the Mid-
Peninsula YWCA, said she
believes she is motivated by the
people she works with and the
challenge in her job. "There's
always more to be done, and
many believe work for civil
rights will never be done. That
keeps me going," Phillips said.
All panelists agreed that
work in non-profit organiza
tions has benefits that compen
sate for the lack of income pro
vided. "There are more intan
gible rewards than the payc
heck," Ancheta said.
Lynne Mason, a counselor
with the CPPC for the past five
years, said she believes the
number of students interested
in careers in public service has
increased within the last two
years.
