## The
						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Free zone a bad idea 
### 
Today Palo Alto voters will decide whether
they want their town to be a "nuclear free
zone." If the proposed initiative passes, it will
become illegal to conduct research within the
city's municipal borders that may contribute to
advances in nuclear weapons technology.
The nationwide effect of such a move would
be relatively minimal. But if Palo Alto's close
neighbor — Stanford University — were to con
sider a similar measure, as some have suggested,
the issue would be far from inconsequential. The
University has a high national profile and is one
of the most active research institutions in the
country.
The Stanford community, if presented with a
"nuclear free" proposal, should maintain its
commitment to freedom of research and reject
such a measure. There are simply too many
variables associated with "free zone" stipula
tions, the most prominent of which is the ques
tion of definition.
In areas of advanced scientific study, the
delineation between disciplines — medical and
military for example — is virtually impossible to
determine. True, laser technology can be used to

zap missiles in space, but it is also true that
lasers can zap dangerous intestinal tissue
growths. True, high-speed computers can be
used to track submarines, but they also can track
the efficiency of a new heart drug.
What is ironic, then, is that the "free-zoners"
who advocate world peace and a hazardless en
vironment, nonetheless find themselves support
ing a curtailment of research projects that are
constructive, not destructive, in nature.
Even more disconcerting would be the virtual
handcuffing of Stanford scientists forced to work
in a free zone area, and further, what these
restraints would imply about intellectual
freedom on campus. The University's policy of
engaging only in government research that is
labeled "non-classified" reflects its belief in ad
vancing knowledge for the world at large, not
solely for political benefit.
The nature of life in the modern state is such
that concern over the military complex should
rightly and undeniably be a focus of domestic at
tention. While "free zoning" appears to be a
statement against a militaristic mindset, it
doubles as an insidious blockade to scientific
progress.
