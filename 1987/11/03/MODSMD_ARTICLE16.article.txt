Pendleton's view
of '60s appalling
One really has to wonder ex
actly what the Stanford
Federalists were thinking when
they invited Clarence Pendleton
to campus Oct. 20, just two years
after he brought his intimidating
sideshow here via the Stanford
Republicans.
Did this frontier "puppet" of
the Reagan administration really
have anything new to say to us?
Or was he the provocative and
controversial figure the
Federalists needed to espouse
their views while suppressing all
opposition at the same time? For
those of you who recall
Pendleton's absurd heckling an
tics the last time he spoke here,
my words come as no surprise.
Frankly, I'm getting quite bored
hearing the same old criticism of
affirmative action and other civil
rights legislation. Tell us some
thing new, Clarence (or at least
interesting).
What 1 found most appalling, if
not insulting, was his assessment
that all black legislative gains
came prior to 1960. 1 don't think
the blacks trying to register to
vote in the South in 1960 would
agree. Only after the Voting
Rights Act of 1965 were things

such as poll taxes and discrimina
tory literacy tests made illegal
(but let's not fool ourselves —
the racists always found ways of
circumventing the law). That's
just 22 years ago!
Pendleton's statement tears
right through the heart and soul
of the black person who felt he
had to risk his life just to register,
not to mention to vote. 1 chal
lenge Pendleton to argue that the
Voting Rights Act of 1965 was not
a significant legislative gain for
blacks, at least in theory. This is
not to mention the Civil Rights
Bill of 1964, which in theory
desegregated housing, federal
jobs and schools. Pendleton
probably did not get out much in
the 19605.

Why can't police
give jump start?
Two days ago 1 inadvertently
left my headlights on after arriv
ing on campus, with the not sur
prising result of a dead battery
waiting for me when 1 walked out
to the parking lot at 12:05 a.m.
As there was literally no one
around to ask for help, 1 walked
back to Meyer to call for assis
tance. 1 called the police emer

gency number first to see if a pa
trol car officer could come and
help me, but the dispatcher, after
consulting with the sergeant, said
that this was not possible.
He then offered to call a tow
truck for me, which I appreci
ated. Unfortunately, the result of
this was that 1 had to wait alone
out on the corner of Escondido
Road and Campus Drive until
1:30 a.m., when the tow truck fi
nally showed up. In the
meantime, a patrol car officer
had seen me standing out on the
corner and had come over to see
what was going on. He already
knew that I was the woman who
had called 911 earlier, and he got
on the car radio and called again
to see what had happened to the
tow truck.
While I do greatly appreciate
the efforts that were made by
these two individuals, I cannot
help but wonder why my original
request for assistance was turned
down, especially in view of the
fact that it was raining quite
heavily that night.
Is there any possibility of the
department's policy being
revised so that any stranded
motorist in similar circumstances
will not be placed in a potentially
hazardous position?

that this was not possible.
He then offered to call a tow
truck for me, which I appreci
ated. Unfortunately, the result of
this was that 1 had to wait alone
out on the corner of Escondido
Road and Campus Drive until
1:30 a.m., when the tow truck fi
nally showed up. In the
meantime, a patrol car officer
had seen me standing out on the
corner and had come over to see
what was going on. He already
knew that I was the woman who
had called 911 earlier, and he got
on the car radio and called again
to see what had happened to the
tow truck.
While I do greatly appreciate
the efforts that were made by
these two individuals, I cannot
help but wonder why my original
request for assistance was turned
down, especially in view of the
fact that it was raining quite
heavily that night.
Is there any possibility of the
department's policy being
revised so that any stranded
motorist in similar circumstances
will not be placed in a potentially
hazardous position?
