# A
						dissenting voice endures in Prague
## 
### 
This is a column I should have written two
years ago. Three years ago, 1 traveled to
Eastern Europe. There I met a most
remarkable man. He was in his mid-30s,
married with two children. He was extremely
well-educated, with the equivalent of a Ph.D.
in English and an extraordinary knowledge of
current affairs.

With his education, 1 would have expected
him to have an important job in the govern
ment or in academia. However, he was a win
dow washer. This was the best job that he
had had in several years; it gave him a slightly
more flexible schedule. Before that, he had
worked at a variety of similarly intellectually
demanding jobs.
You see, 10 years ago, after finishing his
Ph.D., he had been taking a class to learn
computer programming. During that class, he
circulated a petition asking his government to
follow the terms of a treaty it had signed two
years earlier. The petition simply asked that
the Czech government honor the obligation it
had accepted under the 1975 Helsinki Ac
cords.
These obligations covered basic human
rights, many of which are guaranteed under
the Czechoslovakian constitution. Known as
Charter 77, the petition called on the Czech
government to allow the Czech people the
right of free speech and free expression, free
from government harassment. It complained
about "discrimination and chicanery by the
authorities." It was planned as a one-time ef
fort to coincide with the first biannual inter
national review of the Helsinki Accords in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
In the past decade, Charter 77 has become
the standard of the Czech dissident move
ment. Over 12(H) Czechs have signed it since
1977. Roughly 20 percent of them have subse
quently left the country, sometimes at the

suggestion of the government. My friend also
had the chance to leave; he turned it down
because he wanted to work to improve condi
tions. Although he realizes he may eventually
reach a different conclusion, right now he
feels that leaving is tantamount to abandon
ing his country.
So he stays and continues his political ac
tivism, despite the repeated harassment.
Besides being limited to menial jobs he has
been arrested five times, sometimes for no
apparent reason. The first time his wife had
no idea what had happened to him; it took her
over a day to locate him. Once, he was ar
rested because Brezhnev was visiting Prague.
Although each time he was released within a
few days, it was still a very unpleasant exper
ience.
In addition to these obvious indignities, my
friend suffers subtler harassment. At the be
ginning of his dissident career he was often
followed. The surveillance continues, al
though more sporadically. His mail is read.
He thinks his phone may be tapped. And he
frequently worries about how his activities
affect his children in school. He said this is
the one thing that could force him to leave for
the West.
I spent a week with my friend, stayed in his
home and met his wife. We talked ex
tensively about politics and many other sub
jects. He was extremely well-informed about
current affairs. He got much of his informa
tion from the U.S. Information Agency li
brary in the American Embassy. By Ameri
can standards, he is quite left-wing, generally
believing in Scandinavian-style socialism.
In many political respects, however, he
mirrors many young Europeans' beliefs
about the United States â€” only his apply to
the Soviet Union. For example, he was quite
unhappy about the Soviet intermediate range
ballistic missiles placed on Czech soil, but
controlled by the Soviets. He also objected to
the high levels of air and water pollution in
Czechoslovakia.
His biggest complaints, however, were
reserved for the economic situation, which is
very poor. In Prague, fresh fruits and
vegetables are in short supply, and the selec
tion is very limited. The government has em
phasized processed foods at the expense of
fresh produce. Government stores have very

limited varieties of" fruits and vegetables. Al
though private garden plots are allowed, and
some private farmers do come to Prague and
sell their produce, this practice is discour
aged by the government and kept to a very
low level (in contrast to Hungary, where I
saw a very well-developed farmers' market).
As a father, he was quite distraught that his
children had never been able to taste
pineapple.
Another commodity in very short supply in
Prague is housing. My friend is lucky; he now
lives in a nice apartment in a cooperative
building. However, a cooperative building in
Prague is very different from one in New
York City. There, it means all the residents
worked to build it; he worked there for 2(HM)
hours, spread over four years. This was in ad
dition to his normal, full-time job. Before
that, he and his family shared a two-bedroom
house with his mother. Similar situations are
not uncommon in Prague. And although the
center of Prague, where tourists visit, is kept
up nicely, on the outskirts I saw buildings
that would be classified as slums here.
Because his mail is opened, and sometimes
censored, I have been unable to really keep
up with him for the last three years. Glasnost
has come to Russia, and conditions for dissi
dents have apparently improved greatly
there. In Eastern Europe, however, party
rulers have staunchly resisted glasnost. This
resistance has been strong in Czechoslova
kia. The current ruler, Gustav Husak has
been in office since the Soviet invasion of
1968 displaced the reformist Dubcek govern
ment. He is not inclined to follow the direc
tion of his predecessor.
In Prague, we discussed the likelihood that
I would write about my visit. My friend gave
me permission to use his name. He felt that
the government would do nothing to him for
talking to an American. His wife was less
confident about that. Although she agrees
with his politics, she also worries about the
family; she felt there might be repercussions
for them. Therefore, I decided not to use his
name and have omitted certain identifying
details.
