## Theocracy is real threat 
### 
Who will save us from our would-be saviors?
Having just read Roy Campbell's viewpoint
("Secular humanism's war on God"'), I am com
pelled to recognize that intolerance and radical re
action are alive and well in these United States.
What does the author want? Would he, perhaps, be
satisfied with an American ayatollah?

Steve Kay

I had hardly thought it worth mentioning, but we
do live in a pluralistic society. The days of the
Puritan dictatorship are over, as well they should
be. We are celebrating the bicentennial of our Con
stitution. yet there are those who seem to have lost
sight of the values embodied in that document. I his
is a free country, and*among the freedoms that con
stitute our democracy is the freedom of and from
religion. No one has the right to dictate personal
morality or disparage the religious convictions of
others. Where is Jefferson's "wall of separation"
when we need it?
As long as we're on the topic of the "founding fa
thers," I feel 1 must address the proponents of the
"original intent" line of argument. Regarding
Christianity, Campbell should be reminded that a
healthy percentage of our "founding fathers" were
Deists, and thus hardly conform to the fundamen
talist world view. Moreover, their society allowed
slavery, subjugated women and slaughtered Native
Americans. Perhaps the intervening 2(M) years ha
ven't been so bad for us after all. I, for one, rather
prefer the present situation.
1 am a humanist. I am not a communist.
Moreover, as incomprehensible as it may seem to
some, I do have values and a sense of morality. Al
though 1 do not claim to speak for all humanists, I
feel Campbell has grossly misunderstood and
misinterpreted the meaning of humanism. Yes, I
believe in the dignity of the individual. I refuse to
react to the tragedies and injustices of life and the
world with a fatalistic "It was God's will."
It is free will — the will to challenge conventional
wisdom and established norms — that has allowed
man to progress, to better himself and his world. It

is the fundamentalist Christian viewpoint as
represented by Campbell that denies the potential
of man and the pluralistic freedoms of our society.
Who, then, constitutes the genuine threat?
Equating humanism with communism is a grave
error. Whereas the former stresses the power and
potential of the individual, the latter insists that col
lective action is the only path for the betterment of
humanity. Humanism is a philosophy of tolerance;
communist states have shown somewhat ot an in
tolerance for minorities. Humanism is a theory of
freedom, communism a system enforced by
suppression. The ignoble assertion that humanists
support communism is patently false.
The right to worship (or not to worship) is basic
to true democracy, and that right extends to all
sects. By what right does the fundamentalist Chris
tian deny the legitimacy of Judaism, Islam, Bud
dhism, Hinduism and Sikhism? The "spiritual
renewal" needed is the intensification of commit
ment to tolerance, social justice, individual dignity
and potential, peace and freedom.
It is neither humanism nor socialism that poses a
threat to this country. It is terror in the name of
God. The history of radical Christianity has pro
vided us such noble endeavors as the Crusades, the
Inquisition, witch hunts, justifications for slavery,
racism, patriarchal society. This is not "Christian
Fortress America."
The world's one theocracy, Iran, does not pres
ent an acceptable model for our country. The fact
that Iran is an "Islamic Republic" is moot; our fun
damentalists have proven that the lessons of Chris
tianity can be perverted just as those of Islam. We
must be vigilant to preserve our right to think and
speak freely and without fear. As evidenced by the
Robertson candidacy and pronouncements by
people such as Campbell, the theocrats are on the
offensive.
We would do well to note the words of Blaise
Pascal, who recognized the transcending nature of
radical religiosity: "Men never do evil so com
pletely and cheerfully as when they do it from reli
gious conviction." Let us hope that America
recognizes the true enemy.

Who will save us from our would-be saviors?
Having just read Roy Campbell's viewpoint
("Secular humanism's war on God"'), I am com
pelled to recognize that intolerance and radical re
action are alive and well in these United States.
What does the author want? Would he, perhaps, be
satisfied with an American ayatollah?

I had hardly thought it worth mentioning, but we
do live in a pluralistic society. The days of the
Puritan dictatorship are over, as well they should
be. We are celebrating the bicentennial of our Con
stitution. yet there are those who seem to have lost
sight of the values embodied in that document. I his
is a free country, and*among the freedoms that con
stitute our democracy is the freedom of and from
religion. No one has the right to dictate personal
morality or disparage the religious convictions of
others. Where is Jefferson's "wall of separation"
when we need it?
As long as we're on the topic of the "founding fa
thers," I feel 1 must address the proponents of the
"original intent" line of argument. Regarding
Christianity, Campbell should be reminded that a
healthy percentage of our "founding fathers" were
Deists, and thus hardly conform to the fundamen
talist world view. Moreover, their society allowed
slavery, subjugated women and slaughtered Native
Americans. Perhaps the intervening 2(M) years ha
ven't been so bad for us after all. I, for one, rather
prefer the present situation.
1 am a humanist. I am not a communist.
Moreover, as incomprehensible as it may seem to
some, I do have values and a sense of morality. Al
though 1 do not claim to speak for all humanists, I
feel Campbell has grossly misunderstood and
misinterpreted the meaning of humanism. Yes, I
believe in the dignity of the individual. I refuse to
react to the tragedies and injustices of life and the
world with a fatalistic "It was God's will."
It is free will — the will to challenge conventional
wisdom and established norms — that has allowed
man to progress, to better himself and his world. It

is the fundamentalist Christian viewpoint as
represented by Campbell that denies the potential
of man and the pluralistic freedoms of our society.
Who, then, constitutes the genuine threat?
Equating humanism with communism is a grave
error. Whereas the former stresses the power and
potential of the individual, the latter insists that col
lective action is the only path for the betterment of
humanity. Humanism is a philosophy of tolerance;
communist states have shown somewhat ot an in
tolerance for minorities. Humanism is a theory of
freedom, communism a system enforced by
suppression. The ignoble assertion that humanists
support communism is patently false.
The right to worship (or not to worship) is basic
to true democracy, and that right extends to all
sects. By what right does the fundamentalist Chris
tian deny the legitimacy of Judaism, Islam, Bud
dhism, Hinduism and Sikhism? The "spiritual
renewal" needed is the intensification of commit
ment to tolerance, social justice, individual dignity
and potential, peace and freedom.
It is neither humanism nor socialism that poses a
threat to this country. It is terror in the name of
God. The history of radical Christianity has pro
vided us such noble endeavors as the Crusades, the
Inquisition, witch hunts, justifications for slavery,
racism, patriarchal society. This is not "Christian
