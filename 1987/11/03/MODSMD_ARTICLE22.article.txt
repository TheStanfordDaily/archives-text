## Look! Up in the sky! It's a, it's a ... Bug? Examining the riddles of roommates, Ph.D.'s of pop and dilemmas of daylight-saving time 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
I found the magic word!
Madonna! One mention of
Madonna in the column last week
and the questions literally poured
in: two toilet questions, two male
anatomy questions, eight zillion
fountain and road questions. It's
amazing what one mention of
Madonna will do. Now we ll try a
new buzzword. This week's
celebrity female singer lust
bunny is whitney Houston. I ex
pect my mailbox to overflow.
Keep on sending or bringing
those questions to The Play bug
Advisor, Stanford Daily, Storke
Student Publications Building,
Stanford Calif., 94305. Or send
them to Bug-Me (not B.Bug-Me)
on the Tragedies at LOTS. Re
member. whitney Houston!
Dear Bug,
Is it true that you automati
cally get straight A s if your
roommate dies?
- Two Lovely Ladies
Imagine the consequences
were I to say yes!
It seems as though this ques
tion is answered every year in
Bug Me, which just goes to show
that Stanford students never give
up on the power of positive
thinking.
I called James Lyons of Stu
dent Affairs and Norm Robinson
of Residential Hducation, both of
whom sounded decidedly of
fended that anyone would even
have the nerve to ask such a
ridiculous question, and accused
me of making it up.
I love this job!
According to Lyons, students

whose roommates go to that Big
Dorm in the Sky (my euphe
mism) are given every opportu
nity to pull their shattered lives
back together (i.e., move all your
stuff into the other guy's side of
the room — he won't be needing
it).
Professors may be contacted
and alerted to the fact that the
student needs some time off, and
tests or assignments may be
delayed. Often, an incomplete
can be given and the work com
pleted at a later date. Lyons
stressed that Stanford grades,
however, are a reflection of work
completed and not of a
roommate's health.

These are, of course, blatant
lies, because 1 have in my exten
sive and exhaustive research
come up with (Translation: "I
have made up") a chart that
shows what you get for any mis
haps incurred by a roommate:
Death: Straight A s. Dismem
berment: Straight B's. Serious
social disease: Can skip any
paper. Paralysis: Free ASSU
lecture notes. Loss of hearing:
Problem set grade raised one
notch. Coma: Fxtra mealcard.

Another little known fact is
that grades are transferable.
Thus, if your roommate dies, he
can leave you his 'A' in Physics.
There are also some things that
weren't indicated in the chart
above. For instance, if your
roommate is killed and eaten by
squirrels in front of your eyes,
you automatically receive a
Ph.D.
Dear Bug,
Fve got a het with a friend of
mine that goes something like
this: She says there are no
musicians in rock n roll that
have a Fh. /).; / say there has to
he one. It doesn't even have to he
a Fh. I), in music. I know Kris
Kristofferson was a Rhodes
Scholar, and someone in the
hand Boston got a 1600 on the
SA T, and someone in the Talking
Heads went to Harvard, hut does
any rock V roll personality have
a real Fh. I).?
- Fan
You win, buddy. Tell the gal to
pay up, and send me photos.
Before we get into the gory
details, I should add that Kris
Kristofferson allegedly has a
Ph.D. from Pomona, but you
wanted to know about rock 'n'
roll.
This question really had me
stumped; I mean, I had no idea
how to find the answer. I tried all
the usual stuff like phoning Roll
ing Stone and looking for books
in the library titled "Famous
Rock Stars with Ph.D.'s."
Naturally, these attempts failed
completely. It was time to call on
an expert.
I phoned my little brother in
Alaska.

This is a boy who eats, sleeps,
breathes and lives heavy metal.
He even listens to it, too. He has
posters of Metallica and
W.A.S.P. on his walls. He prays
to Eddie Van Halen before he
goes to bed every night.
1 said to him, "Jason, could
you find out if there are any rock
stars with Ph.D.'s?"
He replied, "Well, Brian May,
the guitarist for Queen, has a
Ph.D. in astronomy."
This is a 16-year-old who can't
tell you who was president
during the Nixon administration,
but knew a rock star with a Ph.D.
off the top os his head! Amazing.
Thanks, Jason. It's nice to
know that Bugginess runs in the
family. By the way, get a haircut.
Actually, Queen is a rather
well-educated band. They met in
college, and it turns out that
drummer Roger Meadows has a
Ph.D. in biology, bassist John
Deacon has a degree in
electronics and singer Freddie
Mercury has a degree in illustra
tion and design. No, I don't
know where they went to col
lege. Somewhere in Fngland. all
right?
While researching this ques
tion, I also discovered a particu
larly heinous series of months in
the '70s, in which the number
one songs in America were per
formed by the Bee Gees, Shaun
Cassidy, Andy Gibb, Barry
Manilow and the Bee Gees,
respectively. You know, it's
pretty easy to reject the '70s mu
sically, politically and sartorially
and not lose anything.
Dear Bug,
The morning thai daylight
saving lime occurs we have to set

our clocks hack from 2 a.m. to I
a.m. If I know my friend is arriv
ing on a flight that morning at
1:30 a.m., how do I know if it is
the first 1:30 or the second 1:30?
- Frequent Flyer
Now this is the kind of stupid
question that Bug Me is all about!
It also gave me a headache just
thinking about it.

This, of course, is be
cause airline
employees are hired
primarily for their abil
ity to serve Sprite.

I called eight different airlines,
and for each one it took at least
20 minutes to explain what I was
trying to ask. This, of course, is
because airline employees are
hired primarily for their ability to
serve Sprite, even if their partic
ular job description involves
some other kind of menial task
such as confirming reservations
or piloting a jumbo jet.
Let's suppose our flight is
supposed to leave at 1:30 a.m. In
that case, it will leave at the first
1:30 a.m., but will arrive an hour
earlier than usual because of the
time change.
Now, let's suppose your flight
is supposed to leave at 2:30 a.m.
In this case, it will leave at the
adjusted 2:30 a.m., which your
body will actually think is 3:30
a.m., but you will still have the
same arrival time as usually

scheduled. Your body, naturally,
will become very confused, and
it is likely that you will lapse into
a coma at the stroke of 2 a.m.
Please don't get the wrong im
pression. I don't mean to imply
that your body actually thinks,
because if it could it would start
plotting ways to jump the cute
premed student sitting next to
you.
Arrival times are more tricky.
If all you know is that a flight is
arriving at 1:30 a.m., you are bas
ically screwed and will have to
call the airline and hope they can
tell you which 1:30 it is. If you
know what time the flight left and
how long it usually takes to fly
the route, you can probably fig
ure out which 1:30 it arrives at.
One of the airlines suggested
you go at the first 1:30 and just
wait around until the plane shows
up. Is that not airline mentality at
its finest? Another airline
claimed they had no flights that
Hew during those hours, so they
didn't want to think about it.
A third airline claimed they
changed all flights that morning
so none would arrive or depart
during those two hours of
Twilight Zone timekeeping.
I think what really happens is
that you keep flying until 2 a.m.,
at which time the clock switches
to 1 a.m. Then you fly until 2
a.m., at which point the clock
switches back to 1 a.m. again.
This happens over and over again
until your plane runs out of fuel
and you crash and die
(guaranteeing your roommate
straight A s). Thus, I recommend
you avoid going near any large
objects with wings — sorority
girls being the obvious excep
tion.

This is a boy who eats, sleeps,
breathes and lives heavy metal.
He even listens to it, too. He has
posters of Metallica and
W.A.S.P. on his walls. He prays
to Eddie Van Halen before he
goes to bed every night.
1 said to him, "Jason, could
you find out if there are any rock
stars with Ph.D.'s?"
He replied, "Well, Brian May,
the guitarist for Queen, has a
Ph.D. in astronomy."
This is a 16-year-old who can't
tell you who was president
during the Nixon administration,
but knew a rock star with a Ph.D.
off the top os his head! Amazing.
Thanks, Jason. It's nice to
know that Bugginess runs in the
family. By the way, get a haircut.
Actually, Queen is a rather
well-educated band. They met in
college, and it turns out that
drummer Roger Meadows has a
Ph.D. in biology, bassist John
Deacon has a degree in
electronics and singer Freddie
Mercury has a degree in illustra
tion and design. No, I don't
know where they went to col
lege. Somewhere in Fngland. all
right?
While researching this ques
tion, I also discovered a particu
larly heinous series of months in
the '70s, in which the number
one songs in America were per
formed by the Bee Gees, Shaun
Cassidy, Andy Gibb, Barry
Manilow and the Bee Gees,
respectively. You know, it's
pretty easy to reject the '70s mu
sically, politically and sartorially
and not lose anything.
Dear Bug,
The morning thai daylight
saving lime occurs we have to set

our clocks hack from 2 a.m. to I
a.m. If I know my friend is arriv
ing on a flight that morning at
1:30 a.m., how do I know if it is
the first 1:30 or the second 1:30?
- Frequent Flyer
Now this is the kind of stupid
question that Bug Me is all about!
It also gave me a headache just
thinking about it.

This, of course, is be
cause airline
employees are hired
primarily for their abil
ity to serve Sprite.

I called eight different airlines,
and for each one it took at least
20 minutes to explain what I was
trying to ask. This, of course, is
because airline employees are
hired primarily for their ability to
serve Sprite, even if their partic
ular job description involves
some other kind of menial task
such as confirming reservations
or piloting a jumbo jet.
Let's suppose our flight is
supposed to leave at 1:30 a.m. In
that case, it will leave at the first
1:30 a.m., but will arrive an hour
earlier than usual because of the
time change.
Now, let's suppose your flight
is supposed to leave at 2:30 a.m.
In this case, it will leave at the
adjusted 2:30 a.m., which your
body will actually think is 3:30
a.m., but you will still have the
same arrival time as usually

scheduled. Your body, naturally,
will become very confused, and
it is likely that you will lapse into
a coma at the stroke of 2 a.m.
Please don't get the wrong im
pression. I don't mean to imply
that your body actually thinks,
because if it could it would start
plotting ways to jump the cute
premed student sitting next to
you.
Arrival times are more tricky.
If all you know is that a flight is
arriving at 1:30 a.m., you are bas
ically screwed and will have to
call the airline and hope they can
tell you which 1:30 it is. If you
know what time the flight left and
how long it usually takes to fly
the route, you can probably fig
ure out which 1:30 it arrives at.
One of the airlines suggested
you go at the first 1:30 and just
wait around until the plane shows
up. Is that not airline mentality at
its finest? Another airline
claimed they had no flights that
Hew during those hours, so they
didn't want to think about it.
A third airline claimed they
changed all flights that morning
so none would arrive or depart
during those two hours of
Twilight Zone timekeeping.
I think what really happens is
that you keep flying until 2 a.m.,
at which time the clock switches
to 1 a.m. Then you fly until 2
a.m., at which point the clock
switches back to 1 a.m. again.
This happens over and over again
until your plane runs out of fuel
and you crash and die
(guaranteeing your roommate
straight A s). Thus, I recommend
you avoid going near any large
objects with wings — sorority
girls being the obvious excep
tion.


BUG
ME
I found the magic word!
Madonna! One mention of
Madonna in the column last week
and the questions literally poured
in: two toilet questions, two male
anatomy questions, eight zillion
fountain and road questions. It's
amazing what one mention of
Madonna will do. Now we ll try a
new buzzword. This week's
celebrity female singer lust
bunny is whitney Houston. I ex
pect my mailbox to overflow.
Keep on sending or bringing
those questions to The Play bug
Advisor, Stanford Daily, Storke
Student Publications Building,
Stanford Calif., 94305. Or send
them to Bug-Me (not B.Bug-Me)
on the Tragedies at LOTS. Re
member. whitney Houston!
Dear Bug,
Is it true that you automati
cally get straight A s if your
roommate dies?
- Two Lovely Ladies
Imagine the consequences
were I to say yes!
It seems as though this ques
tion is answered every year in
Bug Me, which just goes to show
that Stanford students never give
up on the power of positive
thinking.
I called James Lyons of Stu
dent Affairs and Norm Robinson
of Residential Hducation, both of
whom sounded decidedly of
fended that anyone would even
have the nerve to ask such a
ridiculous question, and accused
me of making it up.
I love this job!
According to Lyons, students

whose roommates go to that Big
Dorm in the Sky (my euphe
mism) are given every opportu
nity to pull their shattered lives
back together (i.e., move all your
stuff into the other guy's side of
the room — he won't be needing
it).
Professors may be contacted
and alerted to the fact that the
student needs some time off, and
tests or assignments may be
delayed. Often, an incomplete
can be given and the work com
pleted at a later date. Lyons
stressed that Stanford grades,
however, are a reflection of work
completed and not of a
roommate's health.

These are, of course, blatant
lies, because 1 have in my exten
sive and exhaustive research
come up with (Translation: "I
have made up") a chart that
shows what you get for any mis
haps incurred by a roommate:
Death: Straight A s. Dismem
berment: Straight B's. Serious
social disease: Can skip any
paper. Paralysis: Free ASSU
lecture notes. Loss of hearing:
Problem set grade raised one
notch. Coma: Fxtra mealcard.

Another little known fact is
that grades are transferable.
Thus, if your roommate dies, he
can leave you his 'A' in Physics.
There are also some things that
weren't indicated in the chart
above. For instance, if your
roommate is killed and eaten by
squirrels in front of your eyes,
you automatically receive a
Ph.D.
Dear Bug,
Fve got a het with a friend of
mine that goes something like
this: She says there are no
musicians in rock n roll that
have a Fh. /).; / say there has to
he one. It doesn't even have to he
a Fh. I), in music. I know Kris
Kristofferson was a Rhodes

SA T, and someone in the Talking

any rock V roll personality have
a real Fh. I).?

You win, buddy. Tell the gal to
pay up, and send me photos.
Before we get into the gory
details, I should add that Kris
Kristofferson allegedly has a
Ph.D. from Pomona, but you
wanted to know about rock 'n'
roll.
This question really had me
stumped; I mean, I had no idea
how to find the answer. I tried all
the usual stuff like phoning Roll
ing Stone and looking for books
in the library titled "Famous
Rock Stars with Ph.D.'s."
Naturally, these attempts failed
completely. It was time to call on
an expert.
I phoned my little brother in
Alaska.

This is a boy who eats, sleeps,
breathes and lives heavy metal.
He even listens to it, too. He has

didn't want to think about it.
A third airline claimed they
changed all flights that morning
so none would arrive or depart
during those two hours of
Twilight Zone timekeeping.
I think what really happens is
that you keep flying until 2 a.m.,
at which time the clock switches
to 1 a.m. Then you fly until 2
a.m., at which point the clock
switches back to 1 a.m. again.
This happens over and over again
until your plane runs out of fuel
and you crash and die
(guaranteeing your roommate
straight A s). Thus, I recommend
you avoid going near any large
objects with wings — sorority
girls being the obvious excep
tion.


BUG
ME
I found the magic word!
Madonna! One mention of
Madonna in the column last week
and the questions literally poured
in: two toilet questions, two male
anatomy questions, eight zillion
fountain and road questions. It's
amazing what one mention of
Madonna will do. Now we ll try a
new buzzword. This week's
celebrity female singer lust
bunny is whitney Houston. I ex
pect my mailbox to overflow.
Keep on sending or bringing
those questions to The Play bug
Advisor, Stanford Daily, Storke
Student Publications Building,
Stanford Calif., 94305. Or send
them to Bug-Me (not B.Bug-Me)
on the Tragedies at LOTS. Re
member. whitney Houston!
Dear Bug,
Is it true that you automati
cally get straight A s if your
roommate dies?
- Two Lovely Ladies
Imagine the consequences
were I to say yes!
It seems as though this ques
tion is answered every year in
Bug Me, which just goes to show
that Stanford students never give
up on the power of positive
thinking.
I called James Lyons of Stu
dent Affairs and Norm Robinson
of Residential Hducation, both of
whom sounded decidedly of
fended that anyone would even
have the nerve to ask such a
ridiculous question, and accused
me of making it up.
I love this job!
According to Lyons, students

whose roommates go to that Big
Dorm in the Sky (my euphe
mism) are given every opportu
nity to pull their shattered lives
back together (i.e., move all your
stuff into the other guy's side of
the room — he won't be needing
it).
Professors may be contacted
and alerted to the fact that the
student needs some time off, and
tests or assignments may be
delayed. Often, an incomplete
can be given and the work com
pleted at a later date. Lyons
stressed that Stanford grades,
however, are a reflection of work
completed and not of a
roommate's health.

These are, of course, blatant
lies, because 1 have in my exten
sive and exhaustive research
come up with (Translation: "I
have made up") a chart that
shows what you get for any mis
haps incurred by a roommate:
Death: Straight A s. Dismem
berment: Straight B's. Serious
social disease: Can skip any
paper. Paralysis: Free ASSU
lecture notes. Loss of hearing:
Problem set grade raised one
notch. Coma: Fxtra mealcard.

Another little known fact is
that grades are transferable.
Thus, if your roommate dies, he
can leave you his 'A' in Physics.
There are also some things that
weren't indicated in the chart
above. For instance, if your
roommate is killed and eaten by
squirrels in front of your eyes,
you automatically receive a
Ph.D.
Dear Bug,
Fve got a het with a friend of
mine that goes something like
this: She says there are no
musicians in rock n roll that
have a Fh. /).; / say there has to
he one. It doesn't even have to he
a Fh. I), in music. I know Kris
Kristofferson was a Rhodes
Scholar, and someone in the
hand Boston got a 1600 on the
SA T, and someone in the Talking
Heads went to Harvard, hut does
any rock V roll personality have
a real Fh. I).?
- Fan
You win, buddy. Tell the gal to
pay up, and send me photos.
Before we get into the gory
details, I should add that Kris
Kristofferson allegedly has a
Ph.D. from Pomona, but you
wanted to know about rock 'n'
roll.
This question really had me
stumped; I mean, I had no idea
how to find the answer. I tried all
the usual stuff like phoning Roll
ing Stone and looking for books
in the library titled "Famous
Rock Stars with Ph.D.'s."
Naturally, these attempts failed
completely. It was time to call on
an expert.
I phoned my little brother in
Alaska.

This is a boy who eats, sleeps,
breathes and lives heavy metal.
He even listens to it, too. He has
posters of Metallica and
W.A.S.P. on his walls. He prays
to Eddie Van Halen before he
goes to bed every night.
1 said to him, "Jason, could
you find out if there are any rock
stars with Ph.D.'s?"
He replied, "Well, Brian May,
the guitarist for Queen, has a
Ph.D. in astronomy."
This is a 16-year-old who can't
tell you who was president
during the Nixon administration,
but knew a rock star with a Ph.D.
off the top os his head! Amazing.
Thanks, Jason. It's nice to
know that Bugginess runs in the
family. By the way, get a haircut.
Actually, Queen is a rather
well-educated band. They met in
college, and it turns out that
drummer Roger Meadows has a
Ph.D. in biology, bassist John
Deacon has a degree in
electronics and singer Freddie
Mercury has a degree in illustra
tion and design. No, I don't
know where they went to col
lege. Somewhere in Fngland. all
right?
While researching this ques
tion, I also discovered a particu
larly heinous series of months in
the '70s, in which the number
one songs in America were per
formed by the Bee Gees, Shaun
Cassidy, Andy Gibb, Barry
Manilow and the Bee Gees,
respectively. You know, it's
pretty easy to reject the '70s mu
sically, politically and sartorially
and not lose anything.
Dear Bug,
The morning thai daylight
saving lime occurs we have to set

our clocks hack from 2 a.m. to I
a.m. If I know my friend is arriv
ing on a flight that morning at
1:30 a.m., how do I know if it is
the first 1:30 or the second 1:30?
- Frequent Flyer
Now this is the kind of stupid
question that Bug Me is all about!
It also gave me a headache just
thinking about it.

This, of course, is be
cause airline
employees are hired
primarily for their abil
ity to serve Sprite.

I called eight different airlines,
and for each one it took at least
20 minutes to explain what I was
trying to ask. This, of course, is
because airline employees are
hired primarily for their ability to
serve Sprite, even if their partic
ular job description involves
some other kind of menial task
such as confirming reservations
or piloting a jumbo jet.
Let's suppose our flight is
supposed to leave at 1:30 a.m. In
that case, it will leave at the first
1:30 a.m., but will arrive an hour
earlier than usual because of the
time change.
Now, let's suppose your flight
is supposed to leave at 2:30 a.m.
In this case, it will leave at the
adjusted 2:30 a.m., which your
body will actually think is 3:30
a.m., but you will still have the
same arrival time as usually

scheduled. Your body, naturally,
will become very confused, and
it is likely that you will lapse into
a coma at the stroke of 2 a.m.
Please don't get the wrong im
pression. I don't mean to imply
that your body actually thinks,
because if it could it would start
plotting ways to jump the cute
premed student sitting next to
you.
Arrival times are more tricky.
If all you know is that a flight is
arriving at 1:30 a.m., you are bas
ically screwed and will have to
call the airline and hope they can
tell you which 1:30 it is. If you
know what time the flight left and
how long it usually takes to fly
the route, you can probably fig
ure out which 1:30 it arrives at.
One of the airlines suggested
you go at the first 1:30 and just
wait around until the plane shows
up. Is that not airline mentality at
its finest? Another airline
claimed they had no flights that
Hew during those hours, so they
didn't want to think about it.
A third airline claimed they
changed all flights that morning
so none would arrive or depart
during those two hours of
Twilight Zone timekeeping.

at which time the clock switches

switches back to 1 a.m. again.
