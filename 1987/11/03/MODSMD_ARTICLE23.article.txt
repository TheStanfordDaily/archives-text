## Reduction of cardiovascular risk Disease prevention project changes life styles 
### Mari Yamaguchi 
In a project designed to lower
the incidence of heart disease in
America, Stanford researchers
are trying to induce whole com
munities of people to develop
healthier lifestyle habits.
Scientists at the Stanford Cen
ter for Research in Disease Pre
vention (SCRDP), through their
Five-City Project, are targeting
all the risk factors associated
with cardiovascular disease,
something that no previous study
has attempted.
"Even today, 40 percent of
what we eat is fat, and someday,
I'd like to see this reduced to 20
percent," said Nathan Maccoby,
associate director of the SCRDP
Program.
The goal of the Five-City Proj
ect is a 20-percent reduction in
overall risk of cardiovascular
disease among the treatment
population, Maccoby said.
The 20 percent goal will be
achieved through a nine-percent
reduction in smoking per day, a
two-percent change in relative
weight, a seven-percent reduc
tion in systolic blood pressure
and a four-percent reduction in
total plasma cholesterol.
The Stanford Five-City Proj
ect, currently one of the largest
projects at the Center, is headed
by John Farquar, professor of
medicine at Stanford.
Stephen Fortman, assistant
professor of medicine and June

Flora, assistant professor of
communication, are the co
principal investigators of the
project.
The Stanford project is de
signed to prove that community
wide health education can
achieve a lasting reduction in car
diovascular risk, morbidity and
mortality, according to Mac
coby.
The project also aims to create
organizations within communi
ties to promote awareness of
good health practices that will
continue to function after the
project ends, Maccoby said .
Because the research methods
being used will study health be
havior, the Stanford Five-City
Project might also be used to
lower people's risk of other il
lnesses. such as AIDS and can
cer.

'Even today, 40
percent of what we eat
is fat, and someday I d
like to see this reduced
to 20 percent."

The Five-City Project is a 14-
year experimental field study. It
was initiated in 197 Kin an at
tempt to extend the scope and
objectives of the earlier Stanford
Three Community Study. This
earlier study started in 1972 and
lasted seven years.

The Three Community Study
was an interdisciplinary effort of
medical, communication and ed
ucation scientists and profession
als in three chosen communities
of northern California. The study
demonstrated the potential for
community-wide risk reduction
through education carried out
principally by the mass media,
Maccoby said.
The experimental community,
which received intensive instruc
tion, showed a 30-percent reduc
tion in risk of disease compared
to the other two reference cities.
Stanford's Three Community
Study was one of the world's first
attempts to prevent disease
through educational and media
efforts. "We and the Fins were
the first ones," Maccoby said.
With the success of the Three
Community Study in mind. Stan
ford researchers commenced
with the Five-City Project with
the goal of obtaining more
detailed results on a longer term.
In the new study, selected cities
are much larger — with popula
tions exceeding 30,000 — and
more socially complex.
I he education is also more ex
tensive in the Five-City Project.
There are three reference cities
rather than one. and the educa
tional programs last six years in
stead of three, according to the
Five-City Project report in the
American Journal of Epidemiol
ogy

After an intensive computer
search, Monterey-Pacific Grove
and Salinas were chosen as the
experimental cities in which ex
tensive educational programs
were established. In three other
cities — Modesto, San Luis
Obispo and Santa Maria — re
searchers tested citizens periodi
cally as control or reference
groups.

Like the Three Community
Study, the new study focuses on
educational programs through
the media, according to Mac
coby.
The Five-City study also pro
vides opportunities for intensive,
interpersonal education such as

community smoking cessation
classes, health activities and
health education classes in
schools.
Education through television
and radio, both in English and
Spanish, is designed to deliver in
formation that will affect the atti
tude, knowledge and motivation
of individuals within the commu
nity, according to the Project
Report.
A one-hour "Heart Health
lest'" program provides general
risk reduction information. Addi
tional shorter programs began as
a series of three-to-five-minute
segments on a local news pro
gram and covered smoking ces
sation. cooking, exercise and
weight control. In addition, al
most 100 public service an
nouncements are used.
Print media also plays an im
portant role. Using newspapers
as a major component, the proj
ect leaders gave every house in
the two education communities
at least four print products. They
distributed over 100,000 booklets
and pamphlets by the end of the
fourth year of the project.
Ihe researchers on the l ive-
City Project keep "tracking"
their progress to see it they are
effectively reaching the audi
ence. For example, project
leaders conduct surveys to find
out if people are using distributed
cookbooks to obtain new
recipes.
Researchers count the number

of times each educational pro
gram is used, the number of
people reached and the best pos
sible measure of behavior
change.
Every two years, the l ive-City
Project staff invites randomly
selected individuals, 12-74 years
of age, to participate in surveys
of health behavior and cardiovas
cular disease risk factors.
Individuals who refuse to par
ticipate in the regular study are
only asked questions about their
age, education, body weight and
smoking status.
Survey participants are mea
sured in terms of their health
related behavior and physiology.
First, participants fill out surveys
asking questions relating to
demography, general attitudes
and opinions, knowledge about
heart disease and smoking be
havior. They are also asked to
recall what they ate during the
previous 24 hours, according to
the project report.
Ihe weight, cholesterol level,
cigarette carbon monoxide level
and blood pressure of each indi
vidual is also measured.
I he leaders of the Five-City
Project will compare their results
to those of other ongoing
community-based studies in
Europe, Africa and Australia.
After the project terminates,
Stanford w ill continue to conduct
reasearch in health behavior and
promote community-wide educa
tion.

asking questions relating to
demography, general attitudes
and opinions, knowledge about
heart disease and smoking be

In a project designed to lower
the incidence of heart disease in
America, Stanford researchers
are trying to induce whole com
munities of people to develop
healthier lifestyle habits.
Scientists at the Stanford Cen
ter for Research in Disease Pre
vention (SCRDP), through their
Five-City Project, are targeting
all the risk factors associated
with cardiovascular disease,
something that no previous study
has attempted.
"Even today, 40 percent of
what we eat is fat, and someday,
I'd like to see this reduced to 20
percent," said Nathan Maccoby,
associate director of the SCRDP
Program.
The goal of the Five-City Proj
ect is a 20-percent reduction in
overall risk of cardiovascular
disease among the treatment
population, Maccoby said.
The 20 percent goal will be
achieved through a nine-percent
reduction in smoking per day, a
two-percent change in relative
weight, a seven-percent reduc
tion in systolic blood pressure
and a four-percent reduction in
total plasma cholesterol.
The Stanford Five-City Proj
ect, currently one of the largest
projects at the Center, is headed
by John Farquar, professor of
medicine at Stanford.
Stephen Fortman, assistant
professor of medicine and June

Flora, assistant professor of
communication, are the co
principal investigators of the
project.
The Stanford project is de
signed to prove that community
wide health education can
achieve a lasting reduction in car
diovascular risk, morbidity and
mortality, according to Mac
coby.
The project also aims to create
organizations within communi
ties to promote awareness of
good health practices that will
continue to function after the
project ends, Maccoby said .
Because the research methods
being used will study health be
havior, the Stanford Five-City
Project might also be used to
lower people's risk of other il
lnesses. such as AIDS and can
cer.

'Even today, 40
percent of what we eat
is fat, and someday I d
like to see this reduced
to 20 percent."

The Five-City Project is a 14-
year experimental field study. It
was initiated in 197 Kin an at
tempt to extend the scope and
objectives of the earlier Stanford
Three Community Study. This
earlier study started in 1972 and
lasted seven years.

The Three Community Study
was an interdisciplinary effort of
medical, communication and ed
ucation scientists and profession
als in three chosen communities
of northern California. The study
demonstrated the potential for
community-wide risk reduction
through education carried out
principally by the mass media,
Maccoby said.
The experimental community,
which received intensive instruc
tion, showed a 30-percent reduc
tion in risk of disease compared
to the other two reference cities.
Stanford's Three Community
Study was one of the world's first
attempts to prevent disease
through educational and media
efforts. "We and the Fins were
the first ones," Maccoby said.
With the success of the Three
Community Study in mind. Stan
ford researchers commenced
with the Five-City Project with
the goal of obtaining more
detailed results on a longer term.
In the new study, selected cities
are much larger — with popula
tions exceeding 30,000 — and
more socially complex.
I he education is also more ex
tensive in the Five-City Project.
There are three reference cities
rather than one. and the educa
tional programs last six years in
stead of three, according to the
Five-City Project report in the
American Journal of Epidemiol
ogy

After an intensive computer
search, Monterey-Pacific Grove
and Salinas were chosen as the
experimental cities in which ex
tensive educational programs
were established. In three other
cities — Modesto, San Luis
Obispo and Santa Maria — re
searchers tested citizens periodi
cally as control or reference
groups.

Like the Three Community
Study, the new study focuses on
educational programs through
the media, according to Mac
coby.
The Five-City study also pro
vides opportunities for intensive,
interpersonal education such as

community smoking cessation
classes, health activities and
health education classes in
schools.
Education through television
and radio, both in English and
Spanish, is designed to deliver in
formation that will affect the atti
tude, knowledge and motivation
of individuals within the commu
nity, according to the Project
Report.
A one-hour "Heart Health
lest'" program provides general
risk reduction information. Addi
tional shorter programs began as
a series of three-to-five-minute
segments on a local news pro
gram and covered smoking ces
sation. cooking, exercise and
weight control. In addition, al
most 100 public service an
nouncements are used.
Print media also plays an im
portant role. Using newspapers

ect leaders gave every house in
