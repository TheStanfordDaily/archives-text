## Gray, Alborough lead Stanford at Pac-10 meet 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Yesterday at the Stanford Golf Course the
Cardinal cross country teams suffered disap
pointing losses at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships. The Stanford women, led by
Carol Gray's fifth-place finish, took fifth place.

while the men ended up hack in eighth place.
Oregon annihilated the competition by taking
first, second and third in the women's race, with
winner Annette Hand completing the five
kilometer race in 16:44. Arizona ran away with
the men's competition, compiling less than half
the points of runner-up Oregon, and Sun Devil
Matt Giusto won the race in 30:33.
The Ducks fielded last year's starting five as
well as Hand, a Montana State transfer, to put a
virtual lock on this year's women's title. Oregon
came into the race ranked second in the nation.
Gray went out fast, covering the first mile in
5:02 and never looked back to finish in 17:08. In
last year's race, she captured third place in 16:58
before going on to win NCAA All-America
honors. This season her personal best came at
the Aggie Invitational two weeks ago with a time
of 16:53.
The second Stanford finisher was Melanie
Bloch, who took 14th place in 17:48. Bloch was
the second freshman finisher in the race and ran
her fastest time of the year. Mary Mendoza and
Wendy Neely, also freshmen, were 25th and
32nd, respectively, in 18:06 and 18:21. Kim
Stevens was the final Cardinal scorer.
The race strategies for the Stanford women's
and men's teams were similar: to go out with the
leaders and hang on. Unfortunately, the strategy
proved to be counterproductive, as few of the
women or men could stay with the pace and fell
back.
The first men's finisher was James Alborough,
who crossed the finish line a few seconds off his
season's best in 31:29, good for 14th. After Al
borough there was a gap of 16 runners, followed
by Stanford's Fric Mastalir in 32:02 and Steve
Schadler in 32:05. Mastalir's performance was a
drop from previous outings, while Schadler cut a
minute and a half from his 10-kilometer time at
the Stanford Invitational a month ago.
Freshman Jason Martin emerged as the Cardi
nal's fourth finisher in 32:15, by far his best per
formance of the year. Mark Mastalir and Bill
Crowley followed in 41st and 43rd, respectively.
