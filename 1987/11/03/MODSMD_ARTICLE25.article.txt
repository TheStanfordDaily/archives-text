# Card seeks No. 15
## Defending champion UOP without Oden 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
The question about what hap
pens when an irresistable force
meets an immovable object will
be solved tonight.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team is the irresistable force,
having won its last 14 matches en
route to a 19-3 record and a No. 4
national ranking.
In the other corner for
tonight's match, which begins at
7:30 p.m. at Maples Pavilion,
Pacific has been an immovable
object atop the collegiate volley
ball world as it has won the last
two NCAA titles and is currently
ranked No. 2 with a 19-3 record.
The Tigers are also the last team
to beat Stanford, accomplishing
that Sept. 22.
The match will be the 28th
meeting between the schools in
what has become one of the best
rivalries in collegiate volleyball.
UOP leads the series if>-ii after
the Tigers' five-game win at
Stockton in September, Pacific's
fourth consecutive win over the
Cardinal.
UOP appears vulnerable this
time around, though. Their three
losses (two to No. I Hawaii and
one to No. 5 UCLA) already
equal their total in each of the
last two years, and the Tigers are
going the whole season without
junior superstar Flaina Oden.
The middle blocker was
playing for the U.S. National
Team in June when she injured
her knee in a match against the
Soviet Union. She tried to avoid
surgery, but the knee hasn't
healed rapidly enough, and she

will probably miss the 1988 Sum
mer Olympics in Seoul as well.
The Tigers still have plenty of
talent, however, as they return
every player from last year's na
tional championship squad.
Leading the way are All-America
seniors Teri McGrath and Mary
Miller. Outside hitter McGrath
will never be forgotten by Stan
ford fans after her 20-kill per
formance against the Cardinal in
the 1985 championship match led
the Tigers to their first-ever
NCAA crown.
Miller, a 6-foot-2 middle
blocker, was named the MVP of
the Pacific Coast Athletic Asso
ciation Tournament last year and
is a somewhat streaky player
who can take over a match when
she gets the hot hand.
Liz Hert, another senior, is the
setter for the Tigers, while her
twin sister, Dorothy, and junior
Brooke Herrington both are
defensively-strong outside hit
ters.
UOP Coach John Dunning was
not content to return everyone
from last year's team, though, so
he went out and recruited three
top-notch players out of high
school to join Cathey Scotlan,
who redshirted last year, in an at
tempt to make this squad even
better than the 1986 team.
Pacific will have a tough time
beating the Cardinal in Maples,
however. Stanford ran its home
record to 9-0 with a win over Cal
ifornia on Friday and the Cardi
nal has won seven of those nine
contests in three straight games.
Stanford dominated Friday's
match from start to finish, not al
lowing the Bears to reach double
figures in points in any of the

three games. The match was
played before the Cardinal's larg
est home crowd of the season,
2HX). Dating hack to last year,
Stanford has won 12 in a row at
home, with the last loss coming
last November to — you guessed
it — Pacific.
Leading the way for the Cardi
nal is its trio of seniors, Nancy
Reno, Wendi Rush and Teresa
Smith. Smith and Reno have
been one-two on the team all
season in kills. Reno leads the
team in blocks. Smith leads in
service aces and Rush leads in
digs and assists.
The Cardinal blockers face a
difficult task in slowing down
Miller, McGrath and the rest of
the Tiger attack, but Stanford ap
pears ready for the challenge.
According to Stanford Coach
Don Shaw, the team has turned
in some of its finest blocking per
formances of the season over the
past three weeks.
The match is not important as
far as league play is concerned
for either team, but Shaw looks
at the match as a good way to
"find out where we stand" in re
lation to other top teams.
Following tonight's match, the
Cardinal will host Oregon and
Oregon State Friday and Satur
day nights. These matches will
provide Stanford (11-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) with a
chance to put itself one more
game ahead of the third-place
Ducks (9-4 in the Pac-10), and
will give the Cardinal a chance to
run away from second-place
UCLA, a team that is currently
trying to fight off injuries to key
players.
