# Santa Clara hosts Card
## 
### Robert Partington Staff writer 
The success of the Stanford
women's soccer team doesn't
depend on any one player.
Togetherness has characterized
the 5-10-3 Cardinal through its
ups and downs all season long
and will be the key factor when
Stanford visits Santa Clara
tonight at 7 p.m.
The Broncos are a tough
team, ranked in the top 20 in
the West and having tied na
tionally ranked UC-Santa Bar
bara 2-2.
But Santa Clara's credentials
have not dampened the Cardi
nal's spirit. The players are
eager to finish off the year with
a win.
"Looking to next season, we
would love to win our last
game," freshman midfielder
Denise Denney said.
Stanford coach Berhane An
deberhan can only play IS
players tonight, but he has
switched around his lineup of
ten this season to let as many as

possible gain experience.
"Berhane always says that
there is no individual we can't
do without," junior forward
Carolyn Denney said.
"Winning is secondary to im
provement."
" This is definitely a building
season," Denise Denney said.
"I always emphasize the
team concept," Andeberhan
said. "A team cannot function
with differing individual view
points and standards."
In recent practices, Stanford
focused on getting and keeping
possession of the ball and on
goal-side defense. I he Cardi
nal's style is to play tough
defense and to take care of the
ball while looking for good
counters.
Ihe Broncos have to be
favored tonight, but Stanford
has a chance if it can beat Santa
Clara at its own game.
"They (the Broncos) are a lot
like us," sophomore forward
Tonya Antonucci said. "They
have a solid defense."
Antonucci is the Cardinal's

leading goal-scorer on the
season with four tallies. Fresh
man forward Jenny Rowland
has three goals. Both scored
Saturday against Texas A&M.
Freshman goalkeeper Elise
Edwards will anchor the
defense. Since taking over full
time in goal, Edwards has
showed flashes of greatness
while remaining very com
posed.
"Being the only goalie, there
is pressure not to get injured,"
Edwards said.
Playing under the lights, as
will be the case tonight, makes
it difficult for the goalies.
' Night games are exciting, but
visibility is poor," Edwards
said.
Stanford has two players out
with bad backs, and one, senior
Jennifer Hill, is still hobbled by
a knee injury. Junior forward
Jenny Howick has missed the
last few games with a sore
back, and freshman fullback
Val Goetz underwent diagnosis
yesterday for a possible disc
problem.
