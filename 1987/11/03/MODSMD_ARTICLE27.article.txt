# Stanford drops Chico St.
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
One observer at yesterday's field hockey
matchup between Stanford and Chico State com
mented that the sport was only "for northeastern
prep schools." The Cardinal proved this skeptic
wrong, walloping the Cougars 3-0 in its final regular
season contest and, in the process, greatly solidify
ing its chance for a third straight invitation to the
NCAA tournament.
In breaking out of its worst slump of the season,
Stanford assured itself of at least a share of the
Northern Pacific Conference title. Whether the
Cardinal (6-1-1 in league, 10-5-1 overall) wins the
title outright is solely dependent on San Jose
State's remaining two games. The Spartans, 4-1-1
in NorPac action, must win at Pacific tomorrow
and at home against California on Saturday in order
to finish deadlocked with Stanford in the final
standings.
Against Chico State, the Cardinal showed some
of the same form that propelled it to a No. K na
tional ranking earlier in the season. "1 think the
first half was the best I have ever seen them play,
aside from the Northwestern game," Stanford
Coach Sheryl Johnson said.
Although Stanford dominated play from the out
set of the contest, the team wasn't able to put the
ball in the goal until 22 minutes had elapsed. At that
point, junior Dana Fleming knocked home a beauti
ful shot off a nicely orchestrated Stanford corner.
The Cardinal never looked back.

Just four minutes later Fleming scored off an
other marvelously executed corner. Again junior
Wanda Kay Key and senior Ami Chitwood assisted
on the play. "Dana's always had a really good
shot," Johnson said. " The corners just clicked for
us today."
The scoring ended 32 minutes into the first half
when sophomore Tracy Steiglitz was able to sneak
the ball past Cougar goalie Stephanie Hill off an ex
cellent pass from junior Alison Smith.
The Cardinal finished the first half with 11 shots
and five corners, exemplifying just how many good
opportunities the team had to score.
The second half saw Stanford take only three
shots as it enjoyed a big lead for the duration of the
final 35 minutes of play.
The team's defensive effort was virtually flaw
less, as is becoming the norm. Despite Chico's 10
shots, the Cougars never seriously threatened. Al
most all of junior goalie Karen Jones' nine saves
were relatively easy. Jones finished the regular
season with a stellar 0.62 goals-against average.
This game was important for more than one rea
son. As well as keeping the Cardinal in the race for
a postseason bid, it also marked the last home con
test for four-year starter Chitwood.
"She was real special," Johnson said. "She was
one of those players you could always count on to
go out and play hard."
For now, Chitwood is more concerned about
qualifying for the NCAAs this year, rather than re
flecting on her Stanford career. "We're just
keeping our fingers crossed, she said.
