## 
### Burke Smith Staff writer 
Stanford professors expressed surprise
yesterday at the resignation of Defense Sec
retary Caspar Weinberger and the probable
appointment of National Security Adviser
Frank Carlucci to the post, but said U.S.
defense policy will probably remain much the
same with the possible exception of arms
control.

The administration said Weinberger
stepped down because of the poor health of
his wife, Jane, who has cancer and arthritis.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein said, "People
tend to jump out of an administration in the
last year," but was unwilling to dispute that
Weinberger resigned because of the health of
his wife. "1 don't really know what to make

of it," Bernstein said.
Most professors said they felt the transition
to a new defense secretary would be smooth,
particularly in the areas of arms control and
Persian Gulf policy. " The tone there is set by
the president," said Richard Staar, senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution.
But Staar speculated that Carlucci would
bring greater flexibility to future arms control
negotiations. Weinberger staunchly opposed
any limitations in the Strategic Defense Initi
ative, a major stumbling block in strategic nu
clear arms reduction talks.
Weinberger frequently conflicted with Sec
retary of State George Shult/ on arms control
issues, supporting a much more hardlined ap
proach to the Soviet Union than that advo
cated by Shult/. Weinberger's resignation
may shift the balance of power within admin
istration circles toward a more moderate
policy, according to Staar, who said
"Carlucci's public position is not frozen."

Weinberger s removal from the decision
making process also reduces the possibility of
his lobbying against ratification of arms con
trol treaties. Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody said, however, that "Weinberger has
channels into Congress" and inighi use ihein
to work against any treaty limiting SDI.
"As far as the (Persian) Gulf, there is no
reason to think that he wasn't acting in ac
cordance with presidential policy," Brody
said. "He was over there on the ships at the
time of the attack on the oil platform. "
"It looks as if Reagan believes ardently in
there flagging of tankers in the Persian Ciulf,"
Bernstein said.
Assoc. Law Prof. Tom Campbell, candi
date for the Republican nomination in the
12th Congressional District, said Wein
berger's contributions were significant and
positive. Campbell added that "Carlucci has
got bipartisan support, which will be impor
tant in the upcoming budget battle."
