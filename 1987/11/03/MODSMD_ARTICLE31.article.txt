# Recruiting at Stanford
## How to find your way through the CPPC

Hunting for a job is an aspect
of senior year that many stu

to do next year?" provides the im

the job searches of friends. It is

many students to consider inter
viewing with companies, organiza

various fields and disciplines will
visit Stanford to recruit prospective
employees or students. Obtaining an
interview with any one of these
could open the door to future em

views will be granted to students
who have not registered. The regis
