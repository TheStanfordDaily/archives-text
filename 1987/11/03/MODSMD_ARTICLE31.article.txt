# Recruiting at Stanford
## How to find your way through the CPPC 
### Thomas Vajda 
Hunting for a job is an aspect
of senior year that many stu
dents naturally find quite in
timidating. The seemingly übiqui
tous question, "What are you going
to do next year?" provides the im
petus for serious, sometimes
panicked, consideration of the op
tions that are available.
Job anxiety is often compounded
by events like the Career Faire, ad
vertisements for company visits and
the job searches of friends. It is
these constant reminders that lead
many students to consider inter
viewing with companies, organiza
tions, or graduate schools — and
lead them to visit the Career Place
ment and Planning Center.
Over the course of the year, be
tween 375 and 4(H) companies, or
ganizations and universities from
various fields and disciplines will
visit Stanford to recruit prospective
employees or students. Obtaining an
interview with any one of these
could open the door to future em
ployment or matriculation. For this
reason, it makes sense to be familiar
with the process of recruitment at
Stanford through the CPPC.
The recruitment process at Stan
ford can be broken down into three
major categories: job interviews for
technical science majors, job inter
views for liberal arts or combination
liberal arts and technical majors,
and interviews for graduate schools,
summer internships and teaching
positions.

Regardless of which category
one falls under, all recruit
ment at Stanford begins with
registration at the CPPC — no inter
views will be granted to students
who have not registered. The regis

tration process is quite simple: stu
dents must fill out a standard infor
mation sheet and pay a $20 fee.
Then they can sign up for inter
views.
At no additional charge, students
may also ask that letters of recom
mendation he kept on file. The
CPPC will hold copies of both con
fidential or open letters of reference,
and mail them to whomever the stu
dent indicates.
The recruitment procedure for
technical science majors and stu
dents interested in graduate school,
summer internships and teaching
positions is relatively simple. At 9
a.m. two weeks prior to the date of a
given interview, a sign-up sheet is
posted in the CPPC. At that point,
interviews are granted to the first
people who sign the lists.
Therefore, any students inter
ested in an organization, company,
or university need only sign that list

before it fills in order to ensure an
interview. A normal sehedule for a
recruiter is 13 half-hour interviews,
beginning at 5:45 a.m. and ending at
4:45 p.m. For master's or Ph.D. ap
plicants, these interviews can
stretch to 45 minutes or an hour.
Every Friday, The Daily prints a
list of the companies, organizations
and universities that will be visiting
campus in three weeks.
□
The recruitment procedure for
liberal arts or combination
liberal arts/technical majors is
more complicated. A few years ago,
interviews with a company inter
ested in liberal arts majors were also
granted on a first-come, first-serve
basis. But it was not uncommon for
early morning lines to form outside
the CPPC as students waited to sign
up for an interview with a popular
company or organization.
In fact, on occasion, students
were forced to sleep outside the
door in an effort to be the among the
first 13.
Not surprisingly, the University

requested that the CPPC initiate an
alternate method of" arranging inter
views for liberal arts majors. Thus,
the present system of "bidding"
was established. Under this system,
liberal arts majors must bid points to
obtain an interview.
Once liberal arts student registers
with the CPPC, they receive HXM)
points per quarter. Students must
then decide which companies or or
ganizations they want to bid for. A
student is allowed to bid between
one and 2(H) points per interview.
The schedule for bidding is as fol
lows: On Friday the Daily runs a list
of companies that will be coming in
three weeks, including the type of
student each company is recruiting.
On that Friday or the following
Monday, students must bid at the
CPPC to interview with any any or
ganization scheduled during that
entire week. On Tuesday, calcula
tions are made to determine which
bidders were successful, and a list of
these students is posted on Wednes
day.
Students who have successfully
bid for an interview must then
sign up for that interview on
Wednesday, Thursday or I riday. If
a student does not sign up during
those three days, he loses his
privilege to interview (hut not his
points). Students on the waiting list
those who hid unsuccessfully
are then moved up to till any empty
spots in the schedule.
If the number of bidders does not
meet or exceed the number of inter
view slots, students do not lose the
points they have bid. If this is the
case — there is no waiting list and
open interview slots still remain
the next stage is "free sign-ups."
Beginning ;it V a.m. on the Monday
prior to the interview week, posi
tions are granted on a first-come,
first-serve basis, and are given out
until all interview slots have been
filled.

All students, regardless of their
academic field, are expected to pro
vide a resume to their interviewers.
When students sign up for an inter
view, they should bring along their
resume and place it in the large en
velope attached to the sign-up sheet.
Recruiters often pick up these pack
ets for review the day before
sheduled interviews.
While it is also possible to bring a
resume into the interview, this often
wastes time and prospective
employers may view it as less pro
fessional.
□
Though the process may seem
rather confusing at first, for
most students it turns out to
be quite simple. The most essential
element students must possess is
preparation. If you have your
resume ready early and know when
the groups you are interested in will
come to campus, you can make the
system work to your advantage.
I hen. with a little bit of luck, you
may end up exactly where you want
to be next year.
