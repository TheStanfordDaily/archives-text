# There's more to life than investment banking
## 
### Thomas Vajda 
If it seems at times like the
majority of companies that
recruit at Stanford are large cor
porations and finance institutions,
that's probably because most of
them are. In addition to big business
and banking firms . accounting, con
sulting, and marketing make up the
preponderance of campus re
cruiters.
Although there are always plenty
of Stanford students interested in
working for such companies, and
competition to interview with them
is often fierce, many students wish
there were less emphasis on

"investment banking type jobs,"
according to Volanda Morales, su
pervisor of recruitment activities at
the Career Planning and Placement
Center.
Morales admits that few small
companies and public service organ
izations take part in the recruitment
process at Stanford. Yet Morales
said she has seen a growing interest
in those and related fields. Perhaps
the best example of this trend is the
Peace Corps. According to Morales,
a few years ago the Peace Corps had
trouble filling up its one-day inter
view schedule. Today, it runs three
days of interviews and is three
fourths full every dav.

any information the) might need.

Morales feels that today's
Stanford student is more
aware of the diverse career
opportunities that are available. I he
fields represented by on campus
recruiters, however, just don't meet
every student's needs or interests.
Morales stressed that there are al
ternatives and students "should not
think of the on-campus recruiting
program as the only resource to ob
tain a job after graduation," even
though it is the most visible.
rhe C'PPC offers other resources
for students who are willing to do a
little independent research or work.
There are large amounts of material

on opportunities to work overseas,
for state, local and federal govern
ment agencies or v\ ith non-profit or
ganizations. The CPPC has listings
organized by major and company to
aid in self-directed job searches. A
public service counselor is also
available for those vvho are inter
ested.
There is also a minority outreach
program at the CP PC. Although it is
against University regulations to al
low any company or organization to
recruit from only one ethnic group,
the CPPC does attempt to inform
students in various ethnic groups of
a company's interest in hiring
minorities.
These are just a few examples of
the options available to students.
These and other services at the
CPPC can help one discover the
world of job possibilities outside in
vestment banking.
