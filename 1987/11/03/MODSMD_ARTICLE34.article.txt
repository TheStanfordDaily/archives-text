Whether they leave Stanford
with degrees in science, the
arts or business administra
tion, job-seeking graduates will find
that employment prospects are
looking up.
Job opportunities should improve
in the next few years due to a
healthy economy, according to ex
perts. As the nation's "baby
boomers'" (people born during the
period of high birth rates in the late
1940s and early 19505) age, "|the
lower birth rates in the late I9(>os|
will have a definite impact, starting
now and peaking in the early '90s,'
said Ruth Schneider, director of the
Career Planning and Placement
Center.
Other factors will also contribute
to better job prospects. Steven Dur
lauf, assistant professor of econom
ics, sees no signs in the economy
that would suggest a downturn
"In totality, the prospects are
good," he said. "Unemployment is
low relative to the early 1980s, infla

tion is low and hanks are not ner
vous about the future, since they
have reduced the prime rate."
The stock market crash October
19 should have little impact on job
opportunities, according to Durlauf.
" I'he huge stock rise did not lead to
more investment, so I don't expect
the correction to lead to a decline in
investment," he said.

At Stanford, people are busy
making those job opportuni
ties available to students.
Staffers at the CPPC are continuing
efforts to lure recruiters interested
m hiring students graduating in the
liberal arts, Schneider said.
"We are placing high priority on
increasing the .job opportunities in
the liberal arts and public service,"
she said. "We are doing what we
can by making site visits, talking
with businesses and doing out
reach."'
l ast year, over 4(H) organizations,
including potential employers.

graduate schools, and public serv ice
agencies, came to the CPPC to inter
view students. Response from
recruiters will be "every bit as
strong as last year," Schneider said.
According to Schneider, the
CPPC is stepping up efforts to in
crease the number of public service
agencies recruiting on campus. At
the Career Faire, held earlier this
month, 25 of the 110 organizations
present were offering job opportuni
ties in public service.
Despite efforts to increase job list
ings for liberal arts students in on
campus recruiting, however, oppor
tunities for students in technical
majors predominate. Last year, 331
organizations interviewed exclu
sively for engineering and science
majors at the CPPC.
Schneider explained that busi
nesses that seek engineers must
come to college campuses, whereas
those looking for liberal arts majors
have more alternatives, such as
placing an ad in a newspaper or
waiting for applicants.

Despite a generally healthy economy, there are few positions available in high-tech firms.
However, there are more liberal
arts-oriented jobs available than
may meet the eye, according to
Schneider. "Students may need to
ferret [opportunities] out, but
they're there," she said.

Citing a nationwide survey by
the College Placement Coun
cil. Schneider said of those
seniors seeking employment after
graduation, 15 percent work for a
company with 100 or more
employees, while the remaining 85
percent work for smaller compan
ies.
()n-campus recruiting is primarily
done by larger companies, while
other services at the CPPC are dedi
cated to the 85 percent of graduating
students who will go to work with
smaller companies, Schneider said,

adding thai many employers are
small and cannot afford to finance a
large personnel department and an
on-campus recruiting program .
"Of the 27 staffers at the CPPC,
only three work with on-campus
recruiting,"' Schneider said.
"Fourteen people are in counseling,
including nine counselors who work
with people interested in different
areas, such as publishing, advertis
ing and communications."
"If you know what you want, you
can convince an employer to hire
you," Schneider said.
"Employers find that Stanford
graduates have minds, and although
they may be behind in the first year
I in accounting skills or technical
skills|, in three years, they will be
ahead." Schneider said.
At the Business School, "overall,
the prospects are just as strong,"
said Cathy Castillo, associate direc
tor of the Business School News
Bureau. She said, however, that
there have been some changing
trends in the types of jobs accepted
by Business School students.
"Last year, four percent [of the
graduating class] went into non

profit or government service," Cas
tillo said, noting it was the first year
the percentage has been a significant
one.
"We don't know if [the new pro
gram reducing student loan pay
ments it" graduates enter public ser
vice] was a reason for the rise,"'
Castillo said.
□
However, the emphasis con
tinues to be on investment
banking and consulting, Cas
tillo said. "Investment banking and
consultation jumped in the early
1980s and has been growing
steadily."
"We do have quite a few new re
cruiters from somewhat different in
dustries. including publishing, and
attendance at a panel on manufac
turing was high," Castillo said.
However, "not many" compan
ies in the high-tech industries have
been recruiting due to the downsw
ing in the past few years, Castillo
said. "They're waiting to see
whether to hire."

you," Schneider said.
"Employers find that Stanford
graduates have minds, and although
they may be behind in the first year
I in accounting skills or technical
skills|, in three years, they will be
ahead." Schneider said.
At the Business School, "overall,
the prospects are just as strong,"
said Cathy Castillo, associate direc
tor of the Business School News
Bureau. She said, however, that
there have been some changing
trends in the types of jobs accepted
by Business School students.
"Last year, four percent [of the
graduating class] went into non

profit or government service," Cas
tillo said, noting it was the first year
the percentage has been a significant
one.
"We don't know if [the new pro

Castillo said.

However, the emphasis con

banking and consulting, Cas
tillo said. "Investment banking and
consultation jumped in the early
1980s and has been growing
steadily."
"We do have quite a few new re
cruiters from somewhat different in
dustries. including publishing, and
attendance at a panel on manufac
turing was high," Castillo said.
However, "not many" compan
ies in the high-tech industries have
been recruiting due to the downsw
ing in the past few years, Castillo
said. "They're waiting to see
whether to hire."
Whether they leave Stanford
with degrees in science, the
arts or business administra
tion, job-seeking graduates will find
that employment prospects are
looking up.
Job opportunities should improve
in the next few years due to a
healthy economy, according to ex
perts. As the nation's "baby
boomers'" (people born during the
period of high birth rates in the late
1940s and early 19505) age, "|the
lower birth rates in the late I9(>os|
will have a definite impact, starting
now and peaking in the early '90s,'
said Ruth Schneider, director of the
Career Planning and Placement
Center.
Other factors will also contribute
to better job prospects. Steven Dur
lauf, assistant professor of econom
ics, sees no signs in the economy
that would suggest a downturn
"In totality, the prospects are
good," he said. "Unemployment is
low relative to the early 1980s, infla

tion is low and hanks are not ner
vous about the future, since they
have reduced the prime rate."
The stock market crash October
19 should have little impact on job
opportunities, according to Durlauf.
" I'he huge stock rise did not lead to
more investment, so I don't expect
the correction to lead to a decline in
investment," he said.

At Stanford, people are busy
making those job opportuni
ties available to students.
Staffers at the CPPC are continuing
efforts to lure recruiters interested
m hiring students graduating in the
liberal arts, Schneider said.
"We are placing high priority on
increasing the .job opportunities in
the liberal arts and public service,"
she said. "We are doing what we
can by making site visits, talking
with businesses and doing out
reach."'
l ast year, over 4(H) organizations,
including potential employers.

graduate schools, and public serv ice
agencies, came to the CPPC to inter
view students. Response from
recruiters will be "every bit as
strong as last year," Schneider said.
According to Schneider, the
CPPC is stepping up efforts to in
crease the number of public service
agencies recruiting on campus. At
the Career Faire, held earlier this
month, 25 of the 110 organizations
present were offering job opportuni
ties in public service.
Despite efforts to increase job list
ings for liberal arts students in on
campus recruiting, however, oppor
tunities for students in technical
majors predominate. Last year, 331
organizations interviewed exclu
sively for engineering and science
majors at the CPPC.
Schneider explained that busi
nesses that seek engineers must
come to college campuses, whereas
those looking for liberal arts majors
have more alternatives, such as
placing an ad in a newspaper or
waiting for applicants.

Despite a generally healthy economy, there are few positions available in high-tech firms.
However, there are more liberal
arts-oriented jobs available than
may meet the eye, according to
Schneider. "Students may need to
ferret [opportunities] out, but
they're there," she said.

employees, while the remaining 85

done by larger companies, while
