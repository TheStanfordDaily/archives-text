Whether they leave Stanford
with degrees in science, the
arts or business administra
tion, job-seeking graduates will find
that employment prospects are
looking up.
Job opportunities should improve
in the next few years due to a
healthy economy, according to ex
perts. As the nation's "baby
boomers'" (people born during the
period of high birth rates in the late
1940s and early 19505) age, "|the
lower birth rates in the late I9(>os|
will have a definite impact, starting
now and peaking in the early '90s,'
said Ruth Schneider, director of the
Career Planning and Placement
Center.
Other factors will also contribute
to better job prospects. Steven Dur
lauf, assistant professor of econom
ics, sees no signs in the economy
that would suggest a downturn
"In totality, the prospects are
good," he said. "Unemployment is
low relative to the early 1980s, infla

tion is low and hanks are not ner
vous about the future, since they
have reduced the prime rate."
The stock market crash October
19 should have little impact on job
opportunities, according to Durlauf.
" I'he huge stock rise did not lead to
more investment, so I don't expect
the correction to lead to a decline in
investment," he said.

At Stanford, people are busy
making those job opportuni
ties available to students.
Staffers at the CPPC are continuing
efforts to lure recruiters interested
m hiring students graduating in the
liberal arts, Schneider said.
"We are placing high priority on
increasing the .job opportunities in
the liberal arts and public service,"
she said. "We are doing what we
can by making site visits, talking
with businesses and doing out
reach."'
l ast year, over 4(H) organizations,
including potential employers.

graduate schools, and public serv ice
agencies, came to the CPPC to inter
view students. Response from
recruiters will be "every bit as
strong as last year," Schneider said.
According to Schneider, the
CPPC is stepping up efforts to in
crease the number of public service
agencies recruiting on campus. At
the Career Faire, held earlier this
month, 25 of the 110 organizations
present were offering job opportuni
ties in public service.
Despite efforts to increase job list
ings for liberal arts students in on
campus recruiting, however, oppor
tunities for students in technical
majors predominate. Last year, 331
organizations interviewed exclu
sively for engineering and science
majors at the CPPC.
Schneider explained that busi
nesses that seek engineers must
come to college campuses, whereas
those looking for liberal arts majors
have more alternatives, such as
placing an ad in a newspaper or
waiting for applicants.
