# A 						shortage of professors may be on the horizon

If present trends continue, that
old stereotype of English F'h.D.s
driving taxicabs may soon he a
thing of the past.
Recent studies of national
demographics and university
faculties point to the likelihood of an
increase in the need for college pro
fessors in the next few decades.
Now may be the time to apply to
graduate schools and consider
careers in the academic world.
A life in academics in the 1990s
and afterward may not only bring a
tweed coat and an oak walking
stick, but many other opportunities
and outfits as well.
Many American universities
greatly expanded their faculties
during the 1940s and 50s to accomo
date the thousands of veterans en
tering college on the G.I. Bill and
the waves of "Baby Boom"
children seeking higher education.
This generation of scholars, tenured
and settled, has since maintained a
tight hold on academic positions in
this country. The result has been a
low turnover rate in academic jobs,
especially in the last 15 years or so.
Fortunately for today's under
graduates looking ahead to aca
demic careers, the postwar genera
tion of professors will be reaching
retirement age in the mid-19905.
Their exodus will not only open up a
significant number of positions, but
will also coincide with a potential in
flux of students into American col
leges; the children of the 1950s
"Baby Boomers" will soon be
swelling the ranks of American col
lege students.
The combination of these two
trends may reinvigorate demand for
professors.
According to Charles Junkerman,
assistant to the Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies, "The picture is

looking optimistic for academic
careers. . . . The market has been
clogged for several years, especially
in the humanities, but I think the sit
uation will get better."
Lnglish Professor Ron Rebholz,
who currently serves as his depart
ment's director of placement, said
he has already seen positive stir
rings in the academic job market.
"There has been a noticeable im
provement over the last two years,"
he said. "I would add, however,
that this has varied according to
field."

Although hesitant to predict
the next decade's demo
graphic situation, Rebholz
stressed that a Stanford Ph.D. enter
ing the academic job market the
1990s will have the advantage of the
school's aggressive placement pro
gram. Kvery year the Hnglish De
partment sends several of its
scholars to the Modern Languages
Association's national convention in
order to seek out job opportunities
for its graduate students.
Such active networking on the
part of individual departments can
often be crucial to successful place
ment in an academic career.

Linda Heider, administrations
services manager in the Psychology
Department, also stressed the im
portance of the department's role in
attracting job offers for its doctoral
students.
Junkerman noted several other
factors whose combined effect may
lure more students into academics.
Fields such as law and medicine,
longtime staples in the professional
world, are, in his view, becoming
glutted, and thus less secure as
career choices.
□
The rapidly escalating cost of
attending law or medical
school may also turn more
students toward academics. Most
Ph.D. programs are able to offer
their candidates substantial fellow
ships that allow them to go into the
job market relatively free of finan
cial burdens.
The high tuition of professional
schools often forces those who are
unable to pay outright to incur large
debts. "As academic salaries in
crease, as they have been doing, and
in some cases match those offered in
the business, legal, and medical
world, a career in university teach
ing cannot hut become more attrac
tive," Junkerman said.
He added that he thinks it is a
mistake to assume that a doctorate
only qualifies one for a position in
academics. Job options in the larger
professional arena are. in fact, quite
numerous for some doctorates, he
said.
Psychology Professor Philip Zim
bardo noted that graduate students
emerging from Stanford's Psychol
ogy Department have almost un
limited hiring potential. Indeed,
teaching may not be as much of a
lure for new Ph.D.s as working for
consulting or industrial firms, or for
independent research organizations,
he said.
"We do encourage teaching and
college research, and we do have
students acting as teaching assis
tants" Zimbardo said, "but there

are many instances in which more
attractive offers come from outside
universities."
□
According to Junkerman, the
nature of American univer
sities today makes it increas
ingly easy for academics to branch
out into other fields. "Many univer
sities in this country, and Stanford
in particular," he said, "have cho
sen to make the border between col
leges and communities more
permeable than have their counter
parts in Europe. They want to be ac
tive. to involve themselves."
For Ph. D.sand university faculty
members, this philosophy can
translate into vital and diverse
careers — a biology professor who
contributes to analysis for genetic
development companies, an English
professor who finds entrepreneurial
opportunities in communications
consulting or a statistics professor
who helps advertising firms under
stand collected data.
One thing that is certain is that
students entering graduate programs

in the next few years will find them
selves in an academic marketplace
vastly changed from the one their
predecessors encountered at the end
of World War 11. Advances in com
puter and video technology, for ex
ample, are likely to play increas
ingly prominent roles in both teach
ing and research. "We may be on
the threshold of an educational
revolution," Junkerman said.
If this is so, the role of the
academician in society is certain to
undergo significant changes in the
years to come. Great numbers of
new students will be demanding
quality education in the next few
decades, and positions to instruct
them will certainly be opening up.
Careers in academics may well of
fer this generation of undergradu
ates an increasingly rewarding way
to both respond to and form an in
creasingly interdependent and inter
disciplinary world. One hopes it will
be a world in which a professor's
mention of the great communicator
could refer to either Cicero or to a
high-speed computer. And as for
tweed, chances are it will stay in
stvle.
