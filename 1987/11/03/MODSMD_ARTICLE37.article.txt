# Careers in public service
## Many are finding life outside the private sector rewarding, emotionally and financially 
### Ben Wecht 
Judith, a Stanford student,
didn't want to become a doctor
or a teacher or an engineer
when she graduated. Like many un
dergraduates, she found herself
frustrated by a seeming inability to
define her interests.
And so she decided that rather than
preoccupy herself with a particular
career direction she would focus on
"doing things at Stanford that I
enjoyed and about which I felt
strongly."
That is how she discovered the
field of public service.
In her junior year she became the
coordinator of the Rape Education
Project and coordinated a campus
conference to examine the ways in
which men and women interact.
Judith then took a summer intern
ship at UCLA, where she helped or
ganize a national conference for art
educators from various disciplines
to share teaching methods and con
cerns.
"The internship gave me a
valuable perspective on non-profit
and government agencies and an op
portunity to discover and develop
skills in bringing together people
and ideas," she said.
Now a participant in the Coro
Foundation fellowship program in
public affairs, a nine-month
postgraduate program designed to
provide experience-based training in
that field, Judith is continuing to ex
plore her interests in public service
and policy making. "I actually kind
of like the idea of being a
'professional human,' " she says.

"The field of public service seems
to hold a great variety of possibili
ties, encompassing many issues, as
well as skills."

Gail, a Stanford student back
in the 19605, was selected to
participate in an inter
denominational community service
project in San Francisco in the sum
mer following her sophomore year.
The monthly salary was only $25,
but for Gail "it was a special oppor
tunity to work with a very diverse,
racially integrated group of college
students from around the West
Coast."
According to Gail, now the execu
tive director of the National Service
Corporation, a New York organiza
tion responsible for such public ser
vice projects as the City Volunteer
Corps, "helping others and working
in an entirely different environment
were very important in shaping the
views I hold today . . . because it
tests my thinking and enables me to
extend my knowledge of human na
ture."
Michael, now a law student at
UCLA, graduated from Stanford
along with Judith last summer. As
an undergraduate he served as assis
tant chaplain at the Children's
Hospital, as student coordinator of
the Stanford Newman Center and as
student coordinator of the Stanford
Public Service Summer Fellowship
Program.
Michael said he considers his suc
cess in life thus far to be the result of
the help of others. "In return for

that help," he says."I am obligated
to reach out to others. If I cannot
share my success with another, then
the success that I have achieved is
worthless."
Judith. Gail and Michael are three
very different people with three
very different careers. But what
they all have in common is a dedica
tion to helping others and to serv ing
the public. Also, all three took full
advantage of a very useful and in
formative resource and counseling
center while at Stanford.
In the Career Planning and Place
ment Center's Public and Commu
nity Service Career Program
(PCSC), students interested in
pursuing a career in public service
can discover a diversity of opportu
nities, ranging from preparing legis
lation for a congressman on Capitol
Hill to building a water pipeline for
the Peace Corps in Uganda.
The PCSC program can help you
clarify what your strengths, values
and interests are, investigate the
career options open to you, form
ulate effective job search strategies
and find undergraduate programs to
help you explore and gain public
service experience while still at
Stanford.

An offshoot of the Stanford
Public Service Center at
Owen House, the PCSC pro
gram was established in 19H4. at the
urging of University President
Donald Kennedy, as a way to in
crease institutional emphasis on
public and community service. Now
in its third year of operation, the
PCSC program is designed to help
students investigate a wide range of
public and non-profit career and em
ployment options.
PCSC program services include
individual career counseling ses
sions, career information programs
in which you can meet people
working on public service projects
that might interest you and
workshops and group sessions to
guide you in your job search.
According to Anne Greenblatt.
chief career counselor for the PCSC
program, one of the biggest prob
lems facing graduating seniors is
that they "believe they must choose
between making a living and making
a difference." Although she said she
agrees that this is a very real di
lemma. she added that she does not
feel it is insurmountable.
"Success," Greenblatt said, "has
to do with being a satisfied and pro
ductive human being. ... It also
means choosing work in alignment
with personal values. . . . Being
aware of value priorities can help us
make better decisions."
Of course, financial considera
tions can also fiiuire prominently in

a student's decision to choose a
public service career, mainly be
cause of the traditional perception
of the non-profit sector as being
low-paying. In 1956, however, entry
level slaries in non-profit organiza
tions were SO percent of their
private sector equivalents,
Greenblatt said. And if present
trends continue, the gap may further
narrow during the next few years.

According to Elizabeth
Ehrlich, a recent Stanford
graduate and currently the
program coordinator of a career
mentorship program for minorities,
" l he benefits of my job far out
weigh the lower salary. I love going
to work in the morning, and that's
something money can't buy. I have
a tremendous amount of responsibil
ity and room to be creative. I'm
really learning how to be an entre
preneur."
As Greenblatt sees it, the type of
person qualified to go into public
service has certain attributes.
"They must have a strong interest in
contributing to people," she said.

"People interested in public ser
vice need to march to their own
drummers." she added, "especially
when everyone around them is
going into investment banking or en
gineering or medicine."

One of the people the PCSC
office likes to quote when
trying to encourage students
to go into public service careers is
Stanford alumnus and distinguished
public servant John Gardner.
According to Gardner, there are
two reasons why someone should go
into public service: "To give your
life meaning and to discharge your
obligations to society. You have to
build meaning into your life, and
you build it through commitments,"
he said.
"Identity isn't handed out free any
more — not in this transient, root
less, pluralistic society. Individuals
must constantly reconstruct and
renew the community of which they
are a part, he said. "It isn't in the
grand design that we can have
freedom without obligation."

public and community service. Now
in its third year of operation, the
PCSC program is designed to help
students investigate a wide range of
public and non-profit career and em
ployment options.
PCSC program services include
individual career counseling ses
sions, career information programs
in which you can meet people
working on public service projects
that might interest you and
workshops and group sessions to
guide you in your job search.
According to Anne Greenblatt.
chief career counselor for the PCSC
program, one of the biggest prob
lems facing graduating seniors is
that they "believe they must choose
between making a living and making
a difference." Although she said she
agrees that this is a very real di
lemma. she added that she does not
feel it is insurmountable.
"Success," Greenblatt said, "has
to do with being a satisfied and pro
ductive human being. ... It also
means choosing work in alignment
with personal values. . . . Being
aware of value priorities can help us
make better decisions."
Of course, financial considera
tions can also fiiuire prominently in

a student's decision to choose a
public service career, mainly be
cause of the traditional perception
of the non-profit sector as being
low-paying. In 1956, however, entry
level slaries in non-profit organiza
tions were SO percent of their
private sector equivalents,
Greenblatt said. And if present
trends continue, the gap may further
narrow during the next few years.

According to Elizabeth
Ehrlich, a recent Stanford
graduate and currently the
program coordinator of a career
mentorship program for minorities,
" l he benefits of my job far out
weigh the lower salary. I love going
to work in the morning, and that's
something money can't buy. I have
a tremendous amount of responsibil
ity and room to be creative. I'm
really learning how to be an entre
preneur."
As Greenblatt sees it, the type of
person qualified to go into public
service has certain attributes.
"They must have a strong interest in
contributing to people," she said.

"People interested in public ser
vice need to march to their own
drummers." she added, "especially
when everyone around them is
going into investment banking or en
gineering or medicine."

One of the people the PCSC
office likes to quote when
trying to encourage students
to go into public service careers is
Stanford alumnus and distinguished
public servant John Gardner.
According to Gardner, there are
two reasons why someone should go
into public service: "To give your
life meaning and to discharge your
obligations to society. You have to
build meaning into your life, and
you build it through commitments,"
he said.
"Identity isn't handed out free any
more — not in this transient, root
less, pluralistic society. Individuals
must constantly reconstruct and
renew the community of which they
are a part, he said. "It isn't in the
grand design that we can have
freedom without obligation."
Judith, a Stanford student,
didn't want to become a doctor
or a teacher or an engineer
when she graduated. Like many un
dergraduates, she found herself
frustrated by a seeming inability to
define her interests.
And so she decided that rather than
preoccupy herself with a particular
career direction she would focus on
"doing things at Stanford that I
enjoyed and about which I felt
strongly."
That is how she discovered the
field of public service.
In her junior year she became the
coordinator of the Rape Education
Project and coordinated a campus
conference to examine the ways in
which men and women interact.
Judith then took a summer intern
ship at UCLA, where she helped or
ganize a national conference for art
educators from various disciplines
to share teaching methods and con
cerns.
"The internship gave me a
valuable perspective on non-profit
and government agencies and an op
portunity to discover and develop
skills in bringing together people
and ideas," she said.
Now a participant in the Coro
Foundation fellowship program in
public affairs, a nine-month
postgraduate program designed to
provide experience-based training in
that field, Judith is continuing to ex
plore her interests in public service
and policy making. "I actually kind
of like the idea of being a
'professional human,' " she says.

"The field of public service seems
to hold a great variety of possibili
ties, encompassing many issues, as
well as skills."

Gail, a Stanford student back
in the 19605, was selected to
participate in an inter
denominational community service
project in San Francisco in the sum
mer following her sophomore year.
The monthly salary was only $25,
but for Gail "it was a special oppor
tunity to work with a very diverse,
racially integrated group of college
students from around the West
Coast."
According to Gail, now the execu
tive director of the National Service
Corporation, a New York organiza
tion responsible for such public ser
vice projects as the City Volunteer
Corps, "helping others and working
in an entirely different environment
were very important in shaping the
views I hold today . . . because it
tests my thinking and enables me to
extend my knowledge of human na
ture."
Michael, now a law student at
UCLA, graduated from Stanford
along with Judith last summer. As
an undergraduate he served as assis
tant chaplain at the Children's
Hospital, as student coordinator of
the Stanford Newman Center and as
student coordinator of the Stanford
Public Service Summer Fellowship
Program.
Michael said he considers his suc
cess in life thus far to be the result of
the help of others. "In return for

that help," he says."I am obligated
to reach out to others. If I cannot
share my success with another, then
the success that I have achieved is
worthless."
Judith. Gail and Michael are three
very different people with three
very different careers. But what
they all have in common is a dedica
tion to helping others and to serv ing
the public. Also, all three took full
advantage of a very useful and in
formative resource and counseling
center while at Stanford.
In the Career Planning and Place
ment Center's Public and Commu

(PCSC), students interested in
pursuing a career in public service
can discover a diversity of opportu
nities, ranging from preparing legis
lation for a congressman on Capitol
Hill to building a water pipeline for
the Peace Corps in Uganda.
The PCSC program can help you
clarify what your strengths, values
and interests are, investigate the
career options open to you, form
ulate effective job search strategies
and find undergraduate programs to
help you explore and gain public
service experience while still at
Stanford.
