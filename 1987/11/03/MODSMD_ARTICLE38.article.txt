# Making a good first impression
## Communication is the key to a good interview 
### Ted Lieu 
After spending four (or five)
fun-filled years at Stanford,
reality sets in. You need a
job.
Unfortunately, you've been
having too much fun, and you fear
your credentials may not be good
enough. The big interview with
Mega Industries is coming up next
week. What do you do?
Although you can never hide the
fact that you got a D- in Authentic
Kitsch, there are ways to present
yourself in the best possible light.
You can make the interview work
for you and land the job you want
if you know what the interviewer
wants.
According to Michael Colaneri, a
recruiter for Bank of America,
"Communication skills and inter
personal ability are extremely im
portant qualities that we look for
during an interview."
Career Counselor Anne
Greenblatt at the Career Placement
and Planning Center agreed.
"Communication skills rank as the
most important factor in any inter
view," she said. "Positive body lan
guage, such as good eye contact and
occasional gestures, can be power
ful tools in getting your point
across."
Greenblatt warned, however, that
too much eye contact can make both

you and the interviewer feel nervous
and uneasy. "When you are caught

look down or glance away for ;i few
seconds to organize your thoughts,"'
she said.

In addition to solid communica
tion skills, Greenblatt said,
"energy, enthusiasm and initia
tive are important traits that an in
terviewer looks for."
Liz Scrohish, an interviewer for
Nomura Securities, agreed. "Kn
thusiasm is the number one quality
we look for," she said.
"Always ask questions during an

asm lor the company," Greenhlatt
advised. "Interviewers generally
dislike passive interviewees who
just sit there and respond to their
questions," she said.
The questions you ask, however,
should he pertinent and relevant.
According to the CPPC's Career
Placement Manual, "You should
not walk into an interview for Wells
l argo s branch officer training pro
gram and ask the interviewer to ex
plain the program." Instead, you
should read Wells Fargo's materi
als, familiarize yourself with the
program and ask specific questions
about long-range career projections
and opportunities for personal
growth.
You can also familiarize yourself
with the company by reading
outside source material. "A hot tip
for job seekers is to examine the In
dex of Periodicals and find recent
articles on the company,"
Greenblatt said.
The beginning of an interview is
crucial to its success, Greenblatt
said. The handshake should be firm,
but not crunching. "A limp hand
shake is definitely bad," Greenblatt
said. "A woman should always offer
her hand if the interviewer doesn't
at first," she added.

What you wear to an inter
view is also very impor
tant. "You should appear
neat and clean-cut. without heavy
perfume or distracting jewelry,
Greenblatt said. She advised inter

viewees to dress well and con
servatively.
How you conclude an interview
can he just as important as how you
begin it. According to the CPPC
Manual, "Most introductory inter
views last 20 to 30 minutes. Don't
keep talking (once the interview is
over). . . . Don't leave the interview
without understanding the next
response required of you."
"Send a thank-you letter" after
the interview. Greenblatt said. Ac
cording to the CPPC Manual, the
thank-you letter sets you apart from
the crowd, expresses your apprecia
tion for the interviewer, is an addi
tional sample of your writing ability
and offers you an opportunity to
mention something you may have
overlooked during the interview.
"Follow up is a good habit."
Colaneri said. "It demonstrates that
you have an interest in the job and
that you are an aggresive individ
ual."
Needless to say, try to accentuate
the positive as much as possible
during an interview. For example, it
you are asked to describe your
greatest weakness, don't just iden

tify it — elaborate upon it."It is
very important that you also men
tion steps that you are taking to
overcome it," Greenblatt said.
For example, instead of saying
that you are always late, you can
say, "I have a tendency to get in
volved in quite a few activities and
often spread my time a little thin.
Recently I have learned to put these
activities in priority order and watch
my time more carefully."

Try to answer questions as di
rectly as possible, and never
lie. "Assume they check
everything," Greenblatt warned.
" The ideal interview consists of
truthfully communicating each of
your strengths and backing each one
up with an example," she said.
Although interviews can be har
rowing and stressful experiences,
they give you an opportunity to
present yourself in the best possible
light. Handled correctly, an inter
view can give you that slight edge
over the competition and land you
the job you want.
