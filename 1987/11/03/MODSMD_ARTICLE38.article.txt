# Making a good first impression
## Communication is the key to a good interview

After spending four (or five)
fun-filled years at Stanford,

having too much fun, and you fear
your credentials may not be good
enough. The big interview with
Mega Industries is coming up next
week. What do you do?
Although you can never hide the
fact that you got a D- in Authentic
Kitsch, there are ways to present
yourself in the best possible light.

recruiter for Bank of America,
"Communication skills and inter
personal ability are extremely im

during an interview."
Career Counselor Anne
Greenblatt at the Career Placement

"Communication skills rank as the

advised. "Interviewers generally
dislike passive interviewees who

questions," she said.
The questions you ask, however,
should he pertinent and relevant.
According to the CPPC's Career
Placement Manual, "You should
not walk into an interview for Wells
l argo s branch officer training pro
gram and ask the interviewer to ex
plain the program." Instead, you
should read Wells Fargo's materi

program and ask specific questions
about long-range career projections
and opportunities for personal
growth.
