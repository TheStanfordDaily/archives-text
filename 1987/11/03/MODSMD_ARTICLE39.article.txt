### Ted Lieu 
The resume often provides the
prospective employer with his
or her first impression of you.
Career Counselor Anne Green
blatt of the Career Planning and
Placement Center puts it succinctly:
"The purpose of the resume is to get
an interview." Since first impres
sions are very important, and you
want to at least have a shot at an in
terview, the resume had better be
good.
According to the CPPC's Career
Placement Manual, "The resume
should contain enough personal in
formation to identify you and the
best way to contact you. 11 should
include a cover letter, a brief outline
of your education beyond high
school, a list of your activities and
accomplishments and your job ob
jective. The recommended resume
length for a recent graduate is one
page long. Michael Colaneri, a
recruiter for Bank of America,
noted that "resumes that are longer
than one page tend to be exces
sive."
□
Besides length, the quality of
the paper the resume is
printed on should also be con
sidered. According to Greenblatt,
"The paper should match and be of
high quality." For example, you
should not use a different color en
velope or flimsy typewriter paper.
The actual text itself should also
be of high quality. "Dot matrix
printers just don't cut it. You have
to at least have text from a type
writer or laser-quality printer,"
(ireenblatt said.

A quality resume strives, of
course, to present its subject in the
best light possible. According to
Scrobish. "The resume should em
phasize the fact that you come from
a diverse background.'
Colaneri agreed, adding that
recruiters "look for information that
shows the person has demonstrated
leadership on campus.
The cover letter of a resume is
also very important. According to
Colaneri, " The cover letter should
not reiterate what is already in the

resume. Rather, it should explain
why the attached resume is applica
ble/'
According to the CPPC Manual,
"The cover letter should create in
terest and introduce yourself, give
overview of your qualifications and
state the next step you vmII take.
Samples of cover letters and
resumes can be found in the CP PC
manual. Also included in the manual
are more interview and resume
writing tips. Ihe manual is offered
free of charge, and can be picked up
at the CPPC office.
