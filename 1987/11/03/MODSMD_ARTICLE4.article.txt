### Otto Lin 
The Santa Clara County Board
of Supervisors will vote today on
whether to allocate $10,000 to
support the Bay Area Sports Or
ganizing Committee's bid to host
the 1996 Summer Olympics at
Stanford and other Bay Area
sites.
The organizing committee has
already submitted a proposal to
the U.S. Olympic Site Selection
Committee. The money would be
used to house members of the
site selection committee and to
send members of the organizing
committee to the Olympic
headquarters in Colorado
Springs, Colo., the Times
Tribune reported yesterday.
If the games are held in the
area, Stanford will provide
facilities for the opening and
closing ceremonies, the track and
field events and swimming con
tests, according to Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger.
Geiger said, however, that he
is not enthusiastic about the idea.
Although the publicity generated
by the Olympics would benefit
Stanford to a certain extent, the

administrative difficulties in
volved in hosting and feeding
over 7000 athletes for a period of
two weeks would be tremendous,
according to Geiger.
Nevertheless, Geiger said that
it would be Stanford's responsi
bility to cooperate with Bay Area
Olympics organizers. "We are a
part of the community," he said.
Geiger said he had "no
opinion" about today's vote and
that he was entirely "neutral."
"We would |host the Olym-
Kics 1 if it comes out that way,"
e said, "but we're not actively
campaigning for it."
According to Geiger, San
Mateo County has already
decided to give $S(XM) to the or
ganizing committee, while San
Francisco will contribute
$10,000.
Geiger said the sum of $10,(KM)
is "insignificant" compared with
the "millions" that are involved
in hosting the Olympics.
According to Santa Clara
County officials, a successful bid
would have an "extremely posi
tive impact" on the local eco
nomy, the Times Tribune re
