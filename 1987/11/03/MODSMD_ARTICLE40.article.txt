## Career counselors can help find what's best for you

As the number of days until
graduation dwindles away,
Stanford seniors gradually
come face-to-face with the realiza
tion that life does go on after col
lege.
Not having an idea of what to do
or where to go after graduation can
he disconcerting at the least and
petrifying at the worst.
Fortunately, the Career Planning
and Placement Center offers a wide
array of resources designed to help
seniors evaluate and discover career
opportunities.
Seniors who want help determin
ing or clarifying their career goals
and interests should schedule an ap
pointment with a career counselor at
the CPPC as early as fall quarter.
The CPPC tries to provide seniors
with a self-assessment process de
signed to help them clarify their
goals and interests.
According to Lynne Mason, a
career counselor at the CPPC, "The
self-assessment process is used to

determine the skills, values and in
terests of the student in order to try
to come up with a unique composite
of the student. We then brainstorm
to get a list of possible career oppor
tunities which are suited to that
unique composite," she explained.

The self-assessment tests given
by the CPPC include the
Strong-Campbell Interest In
ventory, the Myers-Briggs Type In
dicator and other optional tests that
are used as tools to help clarify a
student's values and skills.
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
helps students match their tempera
ments and personalities with possi
ble work environments. As a gen
eral policy. Mason said, the CPPC
does not give aptitude tests. "We
assume that Stanford students have
the aptitude for basically anything
they want to do," she said.
Once these inventories of the stu
dent are completed, the next step in
the the CPPC's four-stage career se

lection process is brainstorming.
The counselor and student
brainstorm possible career options
that match the student's values,
skills, temperament and interests.
The student will then be sent out
to explore these opportunities in or
der to narrow down his or her
choices.
The last step in the self
assessment process focuses on job
search strategies, including recruit
ing tips, interviewing techniques,
the use of the University's alumni
network and a "self-directed job
search."
The alumni network enables stu
dents to get first-hand information
about current developments in fields
they are interested in by meeting
and talking with Stanford alumni in
those fields.
The self-directed search, in turn,
helps students uncover the "hidden
job network." This network helps
students make contact with com
panies to let them know they are in
the job market. Mason noted that
"about 20 percent (of graduates) get
their jobs from ads and such. The
other SO percent get them from the
hidden job network."
