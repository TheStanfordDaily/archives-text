# A 						shoulder to lean on
## Career counselors can help find what's best for you 
### Davina Butt 
As the number of days until
graduation dwindles away,
Stanford seniors gradually
come face-to-face with the realiza
tion that life does go on after col
lege.
Not having an idea of what to do
or where to go after graduation can
he disconcerting at the least and
petrifying at the worst.
Fortunately, the Career Planning
and Placement Center offers a wide
array of resources designed to help
seniors evaluate and discover career
opportunities.
Seniors who want help determin
ing or clarifying their career goals
and interests should schedule an ap
pointment with a career counselor at
the CPPC as early as fall quarter.
The CPPC tries to provide seniors
with a self-assessment process de
signed to help them clarify their
goals and interests.
According to Lynne Mason, a
career counselor at the CPPC, "The
self-assessment process is used to

determine the skills, values and in
terests of the student in order to try
to come up with a unique composite
of the student. We then brainstorm
to get a list of possible career oppor
tunities which are suited to that
unique composite," she explained.

The self-assessment tests given
by the CPPC include the
Strong-Campbell Interest In
ventory, the Myers-Briggs Type In
dicator and other optional tests that
are used as tools to help clarify a
student's values and skills.
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
helps students match their tempera
ments and personalities with possi
ble work environments. As a gen
eral policy. Mason said, the CPPC
does not give aptitude tests. "We
assume that Stanford students have
the aptitude for basically anything
they want to do," she said.
Once these inventories of the stu
dent are completed, the next step in
the the CPPC's four-stage career se

lection process is brainstorming.
The counselor and student
brainstorm possible career options
that match the student's values,
skills, temperament and interests.
The student will then be sent out
to explore these opportunities in or
der to narrow down his or her
choices.
The last step in the self
assessment process focuses on job
search strategies, including recruit
ing tips, interviewing techniques,
the use of the University's alumni
network and a "self-directed job
search."
The alumni network enables stu
dents to get first-hand information
about current developments in fields
they are interested in by meeting
and talking with Stanford alumni in
those fields.
The self-directed search, in turn,
helps students uncover the "hidden
job network." This network helps
students make contact with com
panies to let them know they are in
the job market. Mason noted that
"about 20 percent (of graduates) get
their jobs from ads and such. The
other SO percent get them from the
hidden job network."
According to Mason, a
majority of students who
have gone through the self
assessment program "wind up find
ing something much more fulfilling
than they would have otherwise
settled for."
"Many seniors worry," she said.
"Each of them is unique, but they
try to lump themselves into only
seven or eight areas such as
medicine, law or business, when
there are other areas out there for
them."
This fall, for the first time, the
CP PC sent out letters to seniors
reminding them to begin the career
planning process as early as possi
ble. Although an early start can give
seniors "the luxury of time,"
Mason said, "it's never too late for
them to come in."
" There seems to be a greater

number of seniors coming in here
early this year," Mason added,
noting that this could be due to the
fact that "this is the first year in
which letters were mailed out before
the start of the school year."
Asked to comment on recent
studies indicating that many college
graduates do not end up working in
fields related to their major, Mason
stressed that students "should
I major in 1 the area they are most
interested in. Many students may
feel that they should take a practical
major such as economics because
that's what employers look for. In
fact, the skills which they
(employers) consider the most are
interpersonal skills, critical thinking
and communication skills — all of
which can be developed in a liberal
arts major."

While the CPPC is quite
clearly ready and willing to
help students find the
"right" career choice, its programs
and resources do nut include actual
job placement.

"This is not a job placement cen
ter," Mason cautioned. "Like the
university, | the CPPC I provides an
educational process. We're here to
teach them how to find the right
job."
Leaving undergraduate life and
moving into the "real" world is in
evitably a disorienting process.
Anxiety, excitement, fear and a
sense of insecurity about the the fu
ture are common to most graduating
seniors, Mason said.
"Most (seniors) wonder if there's
anything out there," she added.
"They have anxiety about leaving
Stanford because, for many of them,
it will be the first time that they
don't know what lies ahead. There
also seems to be some competitive
ness among the seniors for the
"best" jobs."
"They feel that they've gone to
the best school and that now they
have to get the best' jobs," Mason
said. "I tell them that there is no
such thing as the 'best'job, but that
there is a job out there that will be
personally satisfying and rewarding.
That will be the 'best' job for
them."
