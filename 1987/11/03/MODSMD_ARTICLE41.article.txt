What's the biggest problem
facing applicants to gradu
ate and professional
schools today? GREs, I.SATs and
MCA Is? Competition from biol
ogy/electrical engineering double
majors with 3.98 GPAs? Not ac
cording to Director of Undergradu
ate Advising Audrey Bernfield. In
her view, the biggest problem gradu
ate school applicants face is "a lack
of information."
Graduate students who have gone
through the process stress that plan
ning ahead plays an important role
in a successful application. Gohar
Bilal, who is working toward a
master s degree in construction en
gineering and management, recom
mended that applicants "start think
ing about GREs and letters of rec
ommendation earlier." She said she

"should have applied to more
schools, hut there wasn't enough
time."
□
The letter of purpose, in which
applicants describe their
reasons for wanting to attend
the school to which they are apply
ing and their academic goals, should
be given a good deal of thought and
prior planning.
Lakshmi Rajan, a first-year Stan
ford graduate student working
toward a master's degree in commu
nications, said that graduate schools
"rely heavily on the statement of
purpose." She advised applicants to
"be clear and organized. Be very
focused about what you'll be
doing."
An official in the University's
Graduate School Admissions Office
said that Stanford departments vary

greatly 111 the relative importance
they place on each part of an appli
cation package.
Doris Hjertberg, director of Ad
missions at the Law School, said the
Law School's application process
considers the reputation of the un
dergraduate institution the applicant
attended, grades, LSAI's, extra
curricular activities, community ser
vice and work experience. She
added that an undergraduate inter
ested in applying to law school
should "get the application in
early," especially if the school has a
rolling admissions policy.
Rajan advised applicants not to
worry about the Graduate Record
Examination. "Don't sweat GRLs.
After four years of college, you
should do well," she said. Although
she saiil she found the GRF to be
about as difficult as the SAT, Rajan
described the logical reasoning sec
