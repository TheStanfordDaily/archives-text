recommended that students practice
problems of this type before taking
the test. Rajan stressed, however,
that she believes GRK scores "don't
weigh as much as the statement of
purpose."

Information concerning the grad
uate admissions process is
available from the Undergradu
ate Advising Center in Sweet Hall.
The U AC publishes IK pamphlets on
various aspects of the application
process, ranging from "Some
Thoughts on Medical School Inter
views" to "Preparing for Business
School".
Each year the UAC distributes
over 50,(KM) pages of information to
interested students.
Bernfield emphasized that finding
a faculty mentor to help you with
your application can make a great

deal of difference in a graduate
school application. She noted,
however, that this is not nearly as
necessary for professional school
applicants.
Getting faculty advice can be as
simple as talking to professors who
are experts in areas that interest
you, Bernfield said. "People who
[have mentors] have a better under
standing of the resources available
to them."

Most undergraduates are al
ready painfully aware of
the staggering cost of
higher education by the time they
begin considering graduate school.
However, Bernfield stressed that
lack of money does not have to
stand in the way of an advanced
degree. She advised students con

sidering graduate school to consult
Stanford's awards data base located
in the University's on-line Folio
program. "It you are good, it
shouldn't cost you," she said. Fi
nancial options tor graduate stu
dents include scholarships, grants
and paid teaching positions.
Students who have gone through
the process of applying to and
choosing graduate programs also
advised applicants to visit a number
of schools. "People need to assess if
the school is good for them, Rajan
said. Needless to say, meeting fac
ulty members face-to-face can also
enhance a student's chances of ac
ceptance.
Bernfield said she believed that
the key to success in applying to
graduate or professional school is to
"do vvhat you like and do it well. It
is the intensity anil love that gets
you in."
