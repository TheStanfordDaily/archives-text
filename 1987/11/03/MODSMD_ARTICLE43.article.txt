Having sort of a love/hate re
action to this "Life After
Stanford" stuff.'
Do you find yourself poring over
these helpful hints as if they were
juicy Ann Landers questions; em
barrassed to he caught enjoying
them and even more embarrassed
when they apply to you 7
This article is a reminder that it
won't be that easy to restrain your
self from taking a lemming leap into
the waves of resumes and yellow
paisley power ties flooding the
Career Planning and Placement
Center. You need a plan if you're
not quite ready to dive into the
world of committees, commutes and
overbrewed coffee in styrofoam
cups.
Even as you sit on the Tresidder
patio eating fro yo. swirling in pina
colada apathy and raspberry
procrastination, you'll feel the tug to
job. (Besides, I think they taint that
stuff with career-cinogens or some
thing.)
And did you notice how the whole
campus slopes down toward that in
ner sanctum of interviewing, the
Cppc?
In other words, unless you do
something now about not doing
something, you'll be doing some
thing after graduation in spite of
yourself.
What sort of politically correct
frittering can one use to evade the
job search, though.' And what sort
of response will you get from those
otherwise well-meaning people who
are paid to sit on the Tresidder patio
and ask, "Well, what do you want
to do with a double major in philoso
phy and art history?"

Instead of bawling. "I want
$ I ().()()() a year for every all
nighter I pulled and extra vaca
tion time for missing Flicks to finish
problem sets," try a wunderjahr.

Instead of bawling, \
want $1 (),()()() a year
for every all-nighter 1
pulled and extra vaca
tion time for missing
Flicks to finish prob
lem sets/ try a
wunderjahr.

That's German for "the year spent
in travel for the purpose of perfect
ing one's skill and knowledge be
tween the completion of appren
ticeship and settling down to the
practice of a trade."
Sort of like taking an extended
deep breath.
I should give credit here to the
Oxford English Dictionary, un
abridged, and to the Hubble Man,
who pointed me to the right page. It
seems rather appropriate that some
one w ho spends a good part of every
day strafing White Pla/a with soap
spheres should point his plastic
wand at the answer to the mystery
of the collegiate universe.
An 1895 mention of this term de
scribed the practice as "traveling
afoot like any poor student or mere
Hursch of an artisan serving his
wanderyear."
I don't know what a Hursch is. but
it sounds like a good name for ro

mantic poets, medievalist librarians
or maybe a brewer of fine beers or a
presidential candidate. All reasona
bly unique things to be for 12
months.
And in 1906 we find, "Off to
Philadelphia went Leland when his
wanderyears were over and the ne
cessity of choosing a profession and
making a living faced him."
I don't think that's our little
Leland, but the coincidence should
be convincing enough to send the
post-futurists, mystical pragmatists
and theorists of logical pubertism
among you off on a wanderjahr.
□
Of course, a wanderjahr needs
some prefabricated purpose
of questionable utility in or
der to avoid turning into a
premature sabbatical. Here are a
few suggestions:
Go to the mountains or the beach
or the trees and read all those books
you avoided for four years.
Set some Guinness world records.
For instance: Outdo Plennie Wingo,
who took an KOOO-mile stroll back
wards.
l or you New Yorkers, join the
Miriam Margrave Fan Club by
trying to get a driver's license.
If that's not thrill-seeking enough,
the world's last great bomb defuser
only deactivated 8000 incendiary
devices in West Berlin from 1945-
57. By the way. he was killed by a
hand grenade. The ultimate ehal
lenge, I guess.
Materialists may want to collect
more than the record 793 credit
cards, although the man who did it
in the I9SOs and '60s amassed his
monument to MasterC'harge, that
American Kxpress obelisk of Visa
veneration, all for free. Oh. the an
tebellum days of no monthly
charges.
Or how about going on a crusade
in modern art museums across the
country, righting all those misun
derstood paintings that get hung
upside-down? Matisse's l.c Hatcan
was capsized for 47 days once in
New York's Museum of Modern Art
while 116.(HK) sophisticated, urban
connoisseurs viewed it.
□
But maybe good old Guinness
is too juvenile for you, and
you think it's about time
someone wrote the Great American
Novel. No more of this /it-popping
Holden Caulfield stuff for you.
Maybe some title suggestions will
get you started.
After four years of Stanford edu

cation, we should all he ahle to
manage "Fear and Loathing in
Napa Valley."
Or a paean to the trials of the
modern philosopher, "Zen and the
Art of Microwave Maintenance."
If you liked the credit card idea,
maybe you should write "Money
Dearest," or if you have dreams of
immortality, "Picture of Orange and
Grey."
And in the rejuvenating-old
genres category we have "Scofflaws
of Gor," "Merger at the OK Cor
ral" and "Imprisoned Passion
flowers of Safe Sex." Someone
needs to bring the sci-fi-western-
Hartequin into the '80s.
Maybe writing seems too clois
tered. and you'd prefer an explora
tory wanderjahr (but think the clas
sic Eurailpass serendipity is too
trite). Here's where setting goals of
questionable utility comes in.
Why not tour the world's baseball
stadiums taste-testing hot dogs. Or
do some comparative culture re
search in McDonald's. 1 hear there's
one in Chicago with two dining
areas done in '50s and "M)s
memorabilia, including the red 1957

Corvette convertible complete with
drive-in food tray.
□
And don't forget to collect
tacky postcards wherever
you go. First, you don't have
to degrade yourself by carrying a
bulky Nikon in public, you save on
Fotomat costs and you also get a
more accurate version of how each
culture sees itself.
Parisian postcards depict the Eif
fel Tower melting, the Mona Lisa in
mirrored sunglasses, and "jackc
lopes" infest the postcards in Palm
Springs (Reagan's head blends into
a Rambo body).
You'd never know these things
without going on a wanderjahr. And
you'd never answer your own
frivolous curiosities.
Hut realize that going off on a
wanderjahr may take even more
work than finding a job. At the same
time I'm writing this, I'm writing
"Daily writer, '84-'KK" on my
resume.
Investment banking, take me
awav.
