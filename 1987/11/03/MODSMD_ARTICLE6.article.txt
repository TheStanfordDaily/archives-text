# Summit may aid chances of Sakharov visit
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
The campaign urging the So
viet Union to allow dissident
Andrei Sakharov to travel to
Stanford next month for a major
arms control symposium may
have been aided by last week's
agreement between President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev to hold a summit
meeting in the United States next
month, according to symposium
planners.
Sidney Drell, chair of the Stan
ford Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control and one
of the conference organizers,
said he saw "cause for op
timism" that Sakhorov would be
allowed to come here after the
sudden scheduling last week of a
Reagan-Gorgachev summit in
Washington, D.C. next month.

The summit will take place
Dec. 7, the day after the Stanford
conference ends. The free public
symposium, titled "Building a
Safer 21st Century," is sched
uled for Dec. 4-6.
"We're pursuing the
(Sakharov) invitation ag
gressively," Drell said. "It's in
teresting to note that the summit
will start the day after the confer
ence."
But Drell, who is also deputy
director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, said yester
day that there were "no new sig
nals" from the Soviet govern
ment indicating whether Sak
harov and two other Soviet offi
cials invited to the conference
would be granted visas to come
to the United States.
"1 hope that now that the sum
mit is set, the Soviet Union will
decide to coordinate [Sakharov's
visit] as part of their policy,''
Drell said.
Sakharov, a prominent de
veloper of the Soviet hydrogen
bomb and later Nobel Peace
Prize winner, was released from
a decade-long internal exile in the
Soviet prison city of Gorky last
December in a move widely
viewed as the first concrete reali
zation of "glasnost" in Soviet so
ciety. Observers say Sakharov's
freedom of movement remains a
yardstick by which the Soviets
mood can be judged.
David Bernstein, a research
fellow and lecturer at the arms
control center who is assisting
Drell in coordinating the confer
ence, said, "If there is a good
possibility of a successful sum
mit, that would enhance the pos

sibility that Sakharov would
come." But he emphasized that,
in any event,"the conference
will go ahead and is in no way
contingent on Sakharov's ap
pearance."
Sakharov discussed the invita
tion with Drell last June in Mos
cow. Since then, several univer
sities have lobbied the Soviet
government to allow Sakharov to
attend the conference.
However, a letter to Gorba
chev written several weeks ago
by University President Donald
Kennedy and the presidents of
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Princeton Uni
versity requesting a visa for Sak
harov remains unanswered, ac
cording to Robert Hamrdla, as
sistant to the president.
Bernstein said he was unsure
whether the other invited
Soviets, former Ambassador to
the United States, Anatoli
Dobrynin and Academy of
Sciences Vice President Yevgenii
Velikov, would be able to attend.
He added, though, that the So

viet government had confirmed
that it would send at least two
speakers, as yet unspecified.
Other speakers at the sympo
sium have been confirmed, ac
cording to Drell. Scheduled to
deliver the closing lecture is
Father Bryan Hehir, whom Drell
called "a driving force" in the
pastoral letter against nuclear
war issued by the 1983 American
Catholic Bishops Conference.
The goal of the conference is to
focus on long-range security is
sues, both strategic and regional,
between the superpowers in the
next century. Greg Dalton of
Global Outlook, a Palo Alto re
search and consulting firm
working with the arms control
center in organizing the event,
called it "ironic" that the summit
will take place the day afterward.
Former National Security Ad
viser McGeorge Bundy, Deputy
Secretary of State John
Whitehead and Senator Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) head the list
of remaining officials and
diplomats slated to speak.
