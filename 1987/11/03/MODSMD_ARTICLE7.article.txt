### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
A party, tentatively called
"Cardinal and White Night,"
will be held in White Plaza the
Friday night before Big Game in
place of the traditional Rally in
San Francisco, Axe Committee
Chair Tom Smegal announced
yesterday.
After the decision was made
last week to cancel the Rally, the
Axe Committee went to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons
with the idea for the party. Yes
terday, Lyons gave the idea his
stamp of approval.
"(The party] looks like a good
idea. Their plans are very thor
ough. and they have a lot of
help." Lyons said.
The help will come on many
fronts, since the party is being
co-sponsored by the Council of
Presidents, the Concert Network
and the Stanford Band. In addi
tion, the Interfraternity Council
and the Intersorority Council are
being sought as co-sponsors.
The party will feature the

Band, as the Rally has in the
past. According to Band
Manager Todd Olson, members
of the Band were "incredibly
excited" about the party.
A campus band and an off
campus band will also be on the
program. The Concert Network
will be in charge of booking the
off-campus band. Officials of the
Network were unavailable to
comment last night on which
bands were being considered.
Like the party in the Quad ear
lier this quarter, alcohol will be
prohibited at "Cardinal and
White Night," according to
Smegal. Student monitors and
police will be on hand to enforce
the ban.
Smegal said he was not sure if
the party would become an an
nual event, but he said, "If |it]
goes well, we can consider it
again for next year." The Axe
Committee will conduct a survey
to determine student reaction to
the party.
Smegal added that the San
Francisco Rally was "not neces
sarily dead forever."
