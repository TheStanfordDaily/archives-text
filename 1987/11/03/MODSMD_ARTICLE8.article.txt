## 
### Burke Smith Staff writer 
Palo Alto voters go to the polls today to decide
an unusually controversial school hoard race in
which Stanford Education and Economics Prof.
Henry Levin is a candidate. Levin and six others
are running for three openings on the hoard in an
election divided on the issue of a planned merger of
the city's two high schools.
Three candidates have come out in favor of the
merger and three against. The seventh, Ivan koloz
vari, has spent very little money and is considered
by many to he out of the race.
Levin. Diane Reklis and Terry Trumhull are
challenging the merger plan as "extremely short
sighted," Levin said.
Joseph Simitian, who along with candidates Pam
Marsh and Dehhy Mytels is supportive of the
merger, said, "We don't have the financial
wherewithal to support four secondary schools."
In another Stanford-related race being decided in
today's elections, Raymond Bacchetti, Stanford
vice provost for Management and director of Uni
versity budgets, is expected to retain his seat on the
Foothill-De An/a Community College Board.
Bacchetti, who chairs the board, is seeking re
election along with incumbents Robert Smithwick
and Cierald Besson. a Stanford professor emeritus
of internal medicine. Los Altos attorney Harry
Price is the only challenger for the hoard.
Those running for the Palo Alto School Board
presented sharply different opinions on the issue of
merging the two city high schools.
