# School merger at stake in vote
## 
### Burke Smith Staff writer 
Palo Alto voters go to the polls today to decide
an unusually controversial school hoard race in
which Stanford Education and Economics Prof.
Henry Levin is a candidate. Levin and six others
are running for three openings on the hoard in an
election divided on the issue of a planned merger of
the city's two high schools.
Three candidates have come out in favor of the
merger and three against. The seventh, Ivan koloz
vari, has spent very little money and is considered
by many to he out of the race.
Levin. Diane Reklis and Terry Trumhull are
challenging the merger plan as "extremely short
sighted," Levin said.
Joseph Simitian, who along with candidates Pam
Marsh and Dehhy Mytels is supportive of the
merger, said, "We don't have the financial
wherewithal to support four secondary schools."
In another Stanford-related race being decided in
today's elections, Raymond Bacchetti, Stanford
vice provost for Management and director of Uni
versity budgets, is expected to retain his seat on the
Foothill-De An/a Community College Board.
Bacchetti, who chairs the board, is seeking re
election along with incumbents Robert Smithwick
and Cierald Besson. a Stanford professor emeritus
of internal medicine. Los Altos attorney Harry
Price is the only challenger for the hoard.
Those running for the Palo Alto School Board
presented sharply different opinions on the issue of
merging the two city high schools.
"My basic position is the dis
trict is richly endowed with re
sources, and we could do a lot
better than we have been doing,"
said Levin, echoing Reklis and
Trumbull.
Their consensus is that "the
merger saves so little money, it is
not really a financial issue at all,"
Reklis said.
Citing the "negative relation
ship between school size and
achievement," Levin said he
bases his opposition to the
planned merger on educational
grounds. "Evidence suggests
that quality of education is much

less at a larger school, he said.
Levin said the economic woes
of the district will he partially
solved by an increase in property
taxes, a proposed utility tax also
on today's ballot and increasing
enrollment.
The increase in enrollment at
the elementary level will help fill
Palo Alto's secondary schools in
the future, causing a need for
both of the city's high schools,
Levin said.
According to Reklis, "There
are a lot of other sources of
income which have not been ag
gressively sought by the dis
trict."
Joseph Simitian, a school
board incumbent, said, "We
have been digging into our
reserves at a rate of better than a

million dollars a year." The rate
of deficit-spending will increase
beyond $3 million next year un
less the merger is passed,
Simitian said.
The school district has for
mally itemized over $1.3 million
in savings that would result from
the merger, according to
Simitian. Simitian downplayed
any increase in enrollment as in
significant because of the scope
of under-enrollment in the dis
trict's high schools.
Simitian said benefits of the
merger include a greater breadth
of course offerings and a better
choice of instructional styles. He
said student involvement in ex
tracurricular activities might
decline, but he added that, with
work, a decline can be avoided.
