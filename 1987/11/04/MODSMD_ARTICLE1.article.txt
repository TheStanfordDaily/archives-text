# Kennedy proposal draws response
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
Officials from two top Bay
Area research universities have
expressed interest in University
President Donald Kennedy's
recent call for collaboration in
dealing with public anti-research
sentiment.
Following a spate of protest by
environmentalists and animal
rights activists directed at Stan
ford, UC-Berkeley and UC-San
Francisco Medical School, Ken
nedy advocated in a Los Angeles
speech two weeks ago that the
three universities coordinate
their responses to protest groups
through discussion and the es
tablishment of a regional regu
latory agency.
"We would be very much in
terested in the general proposal
of working together anu talking
about the benefits and value of
research to the area economy,"
said Thomas Gwyn, assistant
chancellor for Public Service
Programs at UC-San Francisco
Medical School.
But Gwyn said UC-San Fran
cisco is "less sanguine" about
the proposed regional regulatory
body.
"We'd want more information
and details before commenting
on such a proposal," he said.
John Cummins, assistant u> iiic
chancellor at Berkeley, said
Stanford and Berkeley "already
cooperate quite a bit in terms of
making supportive statements of
each other."
Cummins said that although
Berkeley officials have not yet
considered Kennedy's proposal,
it is "an interesting idea that
needs to be fleshed out and
thought through."
Although Cummins said many
of Stanford's problems with local
protest groups are specific to
Stanford because it is a private

institution, he called the proposal
"understandable in the sense
that it would broaden our repre
sentation to these (protest)
groups."
Cummins said that because
UC-Berkeley is a state institu
tion, it is not subject to local
jurisdiction and is therefore more
insulated from protest groups'
challenges through local govern
mental bodies.
One problem common to the
three institutions are environ
mental groups that raise ques
tions about the environmental
impact of proposed building proj
ects. Any group can sue a univer
sity if it feels that a project does
not meet the standards of an en
vironmental impact report (EIR).
"We're in court about an EIR
now," said Gwyn, who attrib
uted an increased public interest
in university research to recent
industrial accidents in India and
the Soviet Union.
Gwyn said cooperation be
tween the universities would be
helpful to develop techniques in
"educating the public" about
university research.
