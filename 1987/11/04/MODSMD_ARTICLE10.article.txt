# Poll indicates concern after fall
## 
### 
One out of three Americans
plans to postpone or reduce a
major purchase such as a house,
car or vacation because of the
recent stock market crash, a
prospect that economists fear
could lead to a recession, a Los
Angeles Times poll has found.
The market plunge also has
made many Americans doubtful
about the future and concerned
about a possible recession, re
gardless of whether they own
stock or not, the poll found. In
fact, Americans who do not own
stock are more inclined to cut
back on spending as a result of
the crash than those who lost
money in the collapse.
The results of the poll — con
ducted by telephone to 2463 indi

viduals nationwide between last
Thursday and Monday — repre
sent the first time spending inten
tions have been quantified fol
lowing the crash and broken
down specifically in relation to
purchases of homes, cars and
other big-ticket items.
Consumer spending — which
accounts for about two-thirds of
U.S. economic activity and thus
is critical to the nation s eco
nomic health — had already been
expected to slow down even
before the market crash, in part
because consumers have worn
themselves out from their high
level of spending during earlier
stages of the current economic
expansion.
But the high level — 31 percent

— of Americans indicating they
would cut back purchases be
cause of the market crash came
as a surprise to some economists
who said they did not expect its
impact would be felt as wide and
as fast, particularly among those
who don't own stock.
Most consumers normally
don't adjust their plans that
quickly in response to external
events, said Allen Sinai, chief
economist for the brokerage
house of Shearson Lehman Bros.
Such a finding doesn't bode well
for the economy, he and other
economists said.
"A 31-percent response is a
very quick reaction by consum
ers. It indicates a lot of consum
ers are scared by the stock mar

ket crash," Sinai said. "If 31 per
cent is the right number, then
we're going to see very substan
tial weakness in consumer spend
ing."
"There is not necessarily a
one-to-one link between a stock
market decline and a recession.
The real link is what happens to
consumer confidence," poll di
rector I.A. Lewis said. Amer
icans' caution as reflected in the
poll "has got to have a negative
effect on the economy," he
added.
Any potential consumer
spending cutback now will come
at a critical time for the eco
nomy.
