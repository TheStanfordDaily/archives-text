# Distinction draws criticism
## Jordan program faces review 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
The controversial Jordan Scholars Program will
be reviewed by the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid sometime later this
year to determine whether the program has been
successful and what its status will be in the future,
according to the Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions.
The 1-year-old program — which singles out cer
tain extremely qualified prospective freshmen for
distinction but does not include a monetary schol
arship — has been widely criticized for creating an
unnecessary division within an already highly
qualified applicant pool.
Bill Tingley, associate dean of admissions, said
the committee will make a "thoroughly careful and
objective assessment" of the program sometime
this year, but said the date of the review is yet to be
determined by Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter, who is currently in Europe and un
available for comment.
Last spring, 200 extremely qualified applicants
were given the distinction "Jordan Scholar" with
their offers of admission as an inducement to enroll
at Stanford. As of the acceptance deadline last
May, 85 of these students had accepted Stanford's
offer of admission.
Tingley said the program was definitely "worthy
of being reviewed," and added that he would not
want to speculate on the decisions of the commit
tee.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Thomas Wasow,
who has been meeting with Jordan Scholars at
luncheons throughout the quarter, said the program
is still in the planning stages.
"This year, the Jordan Scholars were admitted
without having any definite ideas as to what the
program would actually accomplish," Wasow said.
"Next year, that definitely won't happen."
Designed to attract the nation's brightest high
school students, the Jordan program was criticized
last year by some students, including the ASSU
Senate, for potentially fostering an elite sub-group
within entering freshman classes.

But Stanford officials defended the program as a
legitimate "experiment" to persuade applicants
who meet the highest academic criteria to attend
Stanford rather than the University's historic ad
missions rivals, Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology.
Wasow said he would "be very surprised if the
program was terminated," because Fetter and
many members of the faculty support the program.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons said the
program has "a positive effect in attracting good
applicants" and "helps Stanford compete a little
better" with other universities that are attracting
the same pool of applicants.
Critics of the program have expressed concern
that Jordan Scholars might receive preferential
treatment, although Lyons said he does not think
this is the case.
A Jordan Scholar who asked not to be identified
said she thinks there is no difference in the way she
is treated and the way other students are treated.
She said that most people in her dorm were not
aware of her Jordan Scholar status, and that if they
found out, it would be "no big deal."
She added that she wasn't even aware of the con
troversy surrounding the program until she arrived
on campus this fall.
According to the student, the only criticism of
the program that Jordan Scholars seem to have is
that the administration seems "unsure how to go
about it without offending anyone."
Wasow said the purpose of his initial luncheons
with the students is to discuss the program and to
generate ideas for future activities.
He said current suggestions for developing the
program include continuing luncheons with the
scholars and inviting faculty to discuss various
fields of interest, or holding an annual David Starr
Jordan lecture in the students' honor.
Wasow noted that the idea for a special lecture
was very unpopular with this year's Jordan
Scholars.
The Jordan Scholar who was interviewed said
she thinks "it's going to take a few years for the ad
ministration to decide exactly what the designation
Jordan Scholar' means."
