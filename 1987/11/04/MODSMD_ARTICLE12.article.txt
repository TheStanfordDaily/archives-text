Sometime in the next 10 days, every Stanford
student should set aside two hours to attend a
performance of the Drama Department's pro
duction of "The Normal Heart."
"The Normal Heart," with regular perfor
mances scheduled at the Little Theater tonight
through Saturday and Nov. 11-14, is a play about
AIDS, gay relationships and the medical profes
sion. It is set in 1981, when AIDS was seen as a
rare, mysterious, new disease rather than as a
modern plague. And in 1981, AIDS victimized
homosexual men almost exclusively.
What do you remember about 1981? The war
in the Falklands? Hinckley shooting Reagan?
Learning to drive?
The discovery of the first few cases of AIDS is
probably not one of the things you remember
from that year. Yet if projections for the spread
of the disease are correct, the appearance of
those first few cases of AIDS may be the most
significant single event in the latter portion of the
20th century. That historical significance is what
in part makes "The Normal Heart" so meaning
ful.
But more than that, "The Normal Heart" is
important because it personalizes AIDS. The
play takes one beyond the hype and hysteria
generated by media accounts of the epidemic,
and beyond the impersonal statistics of the num

ber of people infected and the numbers dead. It
shows AIDS from a personal angle — an angle
from which one can see the individual mortality
and relationship-rending aspects of the
epidemic.
The play grapples not with the governmental
or even the social costs of AIDS — even though
New York City alone expects to spend over $1
billion by 1991 on AIDS-related projects — but
rather with the tragic human toll taken by the
disease.
The Office of Residential Education believes
that exposing Stanford students to this portrayal
of the AIDS catastrophe is very important. Res
Ed has bought out the house for two extra per
formances of the play and reserved them exclu
sively for students. One of those performances
was last night; the other is Nov. 9.
Res Ed should be commended for making an
effort to ensure that Stanford students see this
important play. It is unfortunate, however, that
Res Ed apparently felt it had to prod students to
attend a play about AIDS and gay relationships.
Students — all students — should open their
hearts and minds to confront the crucial issues
and personal dilemmas raised by the AIDS
epidemic. If they aren't already confronting
those issues, they can begin by attending "The
Normal Heart."
