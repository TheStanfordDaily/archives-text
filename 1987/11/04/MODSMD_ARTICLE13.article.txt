to clarify the Black Student Un
ion's position concerning the
proposal by the Task Force on
the Area One Requirement. The
recent articles in The Daily have
provided a confusing picture of
the status of the task force legis

minority students' concern about
the Western Culture program.

Bill King

The BSU strongly supports the
legislation calling for a change in
the Area One requirement. We
feel that are being developed pro
vide an opportunity for evolution
of the program. The proposal is a
good first step on the path to
truly integrating the contribu
tions of women, peoples of color
and non-elites to our civilization
and history.
The present program is at
tempting to adapt to the concerns
of students; however, the
structure of the program is im
plicitly Eurocentric and biased.
It is not enough to be critical of
traditional perspectives; new
perspectives are also required.
The program title "Western
Culture" conveys the implicit as

Western world, centered in
Europe. The focus of the pro
gram has been fixed by the
canonical core list of books,
which has not changed since the
program's inception.
The proposal by the task force
provides the first opportunity to
expand the vision of the Area
One curriculum to include the
true Western world: European,
Black/African, Chicano/Latino,
Asian and Native American. The
new "Culture, Ideas, and
Values" program opens the door
to faculty and departments that

The proposal is a
good first step on the
path to . . . integrating
the contributions of
women, peoples of
color and non-elites. .

The proposal does not ask for a
World Culture requirement
(although that would be the best
solution for the BSU). It merely
provides an opportunity to view
the West in the eyes of all people
and give credit where credit is

uuc to tne uiverse people tnat
make up our American society.
The BSU will be working in
the next few weeks to clear up a
few minor details in the legisla
tion, and to provide a much more
concrete set of guidelines to aid
the Area One review committee
in interpreting the document.
The focus of the University is
now and should be on when and
how the proposal should be im
plemented, not on whether to
change the program.
Our reservations concern
details of implementation, not
philosophies. Being a student on
the task force, I have seen that
arguments and alternative pro
grams have been debated and
reviewed for a year, and the phi
losophy of the document was not
conceived lightly. It represents a
chance to bring in new vision and
still allows many of the tradi
tional program goals to be main
tained.
We feel that the minority com
munity has been very moderate
and has worked very hard to
reach a compromise that is ac
ceptable to all reasonable parties.
We have had to concede much to
reach this turning point, and we
hope that faculty and other ap
prehensive community members
will accept the fact that the Area
One program is changing and
come together to make the new
vision of diversity a beacon for
all students.

expand the vision of the Area
One curriculum to include the
true Western world: European,
Black/African, Chicano/Latino,
Asian and Native American. The
new "Culture, Ideas, and
Values" program opens the door
to faculty and departments that
have traditionally felt excluded
from the program and to the de
velopment of innovative ways of
looking at our society and cul-

The proposal is a
good first step on the
path to . . . integrating
the contributions of
women, peoples of
color and non-elites. .

The proposal does not ask for a
World Culture requirement
(although that would be the best
solution for the BSU). It merely
provides an opportunity to view
the West in the eyes of all people
and give credit where credit is

uuc to tne uiverse people tnat
make up our American society.
The BSU will be working in
the next few weeks to clear up a
few minor details in the legisla
tion, and to provide a much more
concrete set of guidelines to aid
the Area One review committee
in interpreting the document.
The focus of the University is
now and should be on when and
how the proposal should be im
plemented, not on whether to
change the program.
Our reservations concern
details of implementation, not
philosophies. Being a student on
the task force, I have seen that
arguments and alternative pro
grams have been debated and
reviewed for a year, and the phi
losophy of the document was not
conceived lightly. It represents a
chance to bring in new vision and
still allows many of the tradi
tional program goals to be main
tained.
We feel that the minority com
munity has been very moderate
and has worked very hard to
reach a compromise that is ac
ceptable to all reasonable parties.
We have had to concede much to
reach this turning point, and we
hope that faculty and other ap
prehensive community members
will accept the fact that the Area
One program is changing and
come together to make the new
vision of diversity a beacon for
all students.
Bill Kinx is the chair of the BSU.
