## Health plan proposal flawed 
### 
1 have several points I would like to make
in response to the column supporting national
health insurance (Daily, Oct. 30).
First, the claim that "underconsumption"
of health insurance by the unemployed is a
market imperfection is false. Those in a posi
tion to loan money to the unemployed simply
consider the unemployed a bad risk; there is
no lack of knowledge ("market imperfec
tion") in the lending community that the un
employed would like to borrow money to ob
tain health insurance and many other things.

In addition, the contention that "people
typically are not able to borrow against future
earnings* is refuted every time anyone uses a
credit card. What the author of the column is
saying is simply that the taxpayer should pay
the bill for the unemployed. (Note that he
does not propose a government loan program
for the unemployed, though he cites their ina
bility to borrow as the source of the problem.
Nor does he announce the intention to start a
company to provide credit to the un
employed.)
Second, unless one is chronically un
employed (and therefore a bad credit risk),
the time during which one will be without
health insurance should be short, if there is
such a period at all. Often, people buy insur
ance on a semi-annual or quarterly basis and
thus will have a grace period if they become
unemployed. Those wno do not do this are

taking a risk based upon the relative value
they place upon having such insurance and
spending their funds in other ways.
Third, if, as the author states, "the govern
ment has no business spending the in
heritance of the future on terminal care for
people who do not make their own provision
for it," why then is it the government s busi
ness to pay for the health care of the un
employed at everyone else's expense?
Wouldn't it be more just and less coercive
to leave the problem of such health care to
private, voluntary charity based upon indi
vidual concern for the unemployed? Why is
the inheritance of the future more sacrosanct
than the incomes of productive people right
now?
Fourth, why does the author propose a cat
astrophic health insurance scheme for every
one in response to the difficulties experi
enced by the (chronically) unemployed, who
are at most a few percent of the population?
He admits that most Americans have
employer-provided health insurance already.
What justification is there for creating an
army of bureaucrats to administer a program
that does what the private sector is already
doing?
Fifth, such a plan could lead eventually to a
system of socialized medicine, for if the in
surance plan were extended to cover all
health care costs (and elected officials are
ever expanding their handouts in an attempt
to attract voters), the action of the law of
supply and demand would force the govern
ment to assi ne complete control of the
health care market. Whenever a commodity

(medical care) is provided at no cost to the
consumer, that commodity is consumed at a
much higher level than it would otherwise be.
If pricing is left up to the individual health
care provider, then the law of supply and
demand tells us that prices must soar; with
the government footing the hill, there is no
market mechanism to check this. Obviously,
the government would have to step in to con
trol prices, to prohibit expensive procedures
and to dictate what procedures are
"necessary" in treating each illness.
Thus, doctors would become de facto
employees of the state, without the freedom
to treat their patients as they think best (i.e.,
to choose which procedures to perform) or
charge the rates they choose for their work.
Having the government dictate what proce
dures are justifiable for a given class of illness
would undermine a doctor's ability to choose
what is best for his patient.
What is more, under price control the
shortage condition would never be alleviated
because there would not be the incentive of
high prices to bring new people into the field.
Indeed, socialization of the medical profes
sion would discourage new entrants, making
the problem even worse.
1 urge people to think carefully before sup
porting anything like this overblown,
coercive plan â€” a plan that could eventually
destroy the best health care system in the
world and reduce doctors to virtual slaves of
the state.
