# Of midterms and memory
## 
### 
Midterms are a fact of life, much like dysentery.
They refuse to go away until they are completely
finished, and wouldn't you know, somebody
created finals to fill that empty feeling we get once
they leave. But think, without midterms, when
would we get the chance to be graded on the
amount of panic our minds can sustain during a
mere 50-minute period?

What is amazing is that our minds, delirious with
ecstasy because 30 percent of our grades will he ir
retrievable by the end of the hour, seem to function
ably during these exams. It's an evil trick, though,
because inevitably each of us has fallen victim to
memory paralysis: those moments when you are
unable to remember or conceptualize not only
whatever has the highest point value on the test,
but also who you are, where you are and what
you're doing sitting with this blue book in front of
you.
During these episodes of complete loss of
memory and identity, when only a fine line
separates us from sheer, giggling hysteria, I have
observed several things. 1 can best describe them
only after I've told you a story about the most vi
cious encounter I've ever seen between a human
and that bitch-goddess Memory Loss.
I grew up taking piano lessons. Every year my
piano teacher had a recital, and each of his students
had to perform one piece from memory, with par
ents and relatives in the audience.
We would wait out in the hallway while the per
son before us performed and, when it was our turn,
go into the auditorium. We would be alone in front
of the audience, sitting at a large black grand piano,
play our selections, stand beside the piano, bow
and smile. This sounds simple enough, but I will
never forget what happened at the recital when I
was 11.
Two people ahead of me on the program was a
young woman who had evidently started piano les
sons relatively late. She looked 18 but was proba
bly about a sophomore in high school. She was
wearing cosmetics and was dressed like an adult,
not a little girl, in an ice-green dress and heels. I
checked the program and saw that she was playing
the theme from "Brian's Song."
The tune was familiar. She played evenly,
cleanly, calmly. But at the bottom of the first page,
she stopped. There was a pause that seemed end
less. Then she started back a few lines and played
toward where she had stopped.
No performers had had any problems up to this
point, so the mere realization that this could hap
pen terrified the rest of us waiting. Hearts beat just
that much faster, palms got sweatier and children
shifted around in their chairs.
She calmly played to the spot she stopped at

before and slowed down a little. But she stopped
again. The next few notes of the piece had totally
escaped her. After several seconds of silence, she
traced back a few bars again and experimented
with various notes once she couldn't remember any
more, attempting to determine which direction she
should take.
At this point, she started to play a different song.
It sounded similar to "Brian's Song," but I
couldn't tell what it was. I'm sure she couldn't
either. She was trying everything — using every
thing at her disposal to solve her problem, and
that's what made it all the more ghastly. Nothing
worked. She was panicked. No one could help her.
She was on her own, and we were all paralyzed.
Somehow, she tripped across the last couple bars
of her original selection, conveniently embedded in
whatever song she was making up in front of the
audience. I believe it was a divine intervention.
My piano teacher motioned to me from the hall
way, even though it wasn't my turn. The girl in the
ice-green dress was just stepping out of the
auditorium — a sight I'll never forget. She was
wearing mascara, and a single black tear had run

wasn't sobbing; her face was expressionless — my
impression was that her mind had exploded.
The little girl who was supposed to go next was
in the ladies' room with her mother. Standing there
waiting for the girl in the ice-green dress to finish
had made her sick to her stomach. Her little
brother could have gone ahead of her, but he was
standing in the hallway, shaking his head slowly.
He wouldn't budge. His face looked like he'd just
witnessed an autopsy. My piano teacher asked me
if 1 could handle going on now, so they could
recover.
Whenever I remember this story, I feel like I'm
on the brink of something hazardous — something
unspeakably horrible. I'll be driving down the.
freeway, remember "Brian's Song," and suddenly
feel the uncontrollable urge to pull over and stop
the car, because the proximity and relative speed of
the cars around me seems impossibly dangerous. If
I'm walking outside, I'll suddenly need to duck
inside a building. God knows what could drop from
the sky.
Back to the subject of midterms. What happened
in this piano recital can happen to a person in a
midterm. Regardless of what one tries, he or she,
on occasion, will not be able to remember the for
mula for Relative Survival Rate, or six of the eight
absolute contradictions to Combined Birth Control
Pill use — important, earth-shaking information
like that.
If it hasn't happened to you already, it will some
day. When it does, though, my only advice is not to
worry. You are not alone. It happens to us all, and
if you just remember the girl in the ice-green dress,
complete with the black tear frozen halfway down
her cheek, you'll still be stranded in that helpless
zone of panic, but you'll realize that you're not
alone — that others have been there before and
survived.
