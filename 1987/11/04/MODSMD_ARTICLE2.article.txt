# New medical facility to open in late 1988
## $55 million earmarked for biology center 
### Haru Connolly Senior staff writer 
The Beckman Center, a new $55-
million molecular biology research build
ing at the Medical Center, will open in
late 1988, University officials announced
yesterday.
The building will be "the biggest single
research facility in one building in the
entire world," University President
Donald Kennedy said at a naming cere
mony yesterday.
The 1 ()(),()()()-square-foot facility,
funded largely through corporate and
foundation grants, is named for Arnold
and Mabel Beckman, who donated $12
million to the project.
Warren Christopher, president of the
Board of Trustees, said the new center is
a "very significant investment at Stan
ford. It is remarkable what will come
from here."
David Korn, dean of the Medical
School, agreed. "The Beckman Center is
a marvelous investment in science at
Stanford," he said.
The center, now under construction
next to Fairchild Auditorium, will house
two new research departments, Molec
ular and Cellular Physiology and
Developmental Biology. The Department
of Biochemistry will also move into the
new facility.
With the opening of the new facility,
basic research and clinical faculty at

Stanford will increase by 50 percent, said
Pathology Prof. David Clayton, associate
director of the center.
According to Chemistry Prof. Paul
Berg, director of the center, 40 faculty
members will be based at the facility. As
many as 150 graduate students and 300
post-doctoral scholars will also conduct
research there.
"It will be a very active place," Berg
said. "Jobs and internships will be
available (for undergraduates), just as
they are now at the Medical Center."
However, Richard Tsien, who will
chair the Molecular and Cellular Physiol
ogy Department, cautioned that "it is im
portant to affirm the belief that teaching
and research go hand-in-hand, and that
many good researchers are also good
teachers.
"It is also important to establish a
graduate program," Tsien added.
According to Berg, the center will
serve as a needed link between research
and practicing medicine.
"It's a recognition of the modern revo
lution that genetics is applicable to
human health and diseases," Korn said.
"We can make technological ad
vances, analyze them and transform
those concepts into fighting human
disease," Berg said.
"Although there are problems in the
costs and distribution of medical care,
