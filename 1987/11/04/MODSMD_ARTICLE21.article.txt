## Nearly 200 acres would remain for recreational use Plan outlines future development of Foothills region 
### Tim Hullar Staff writer 
In the wake of last year's
struggle over the proposed siting
of the Ronald Reagan Presiden
tial Library, Stanford Univer
sity's Planning Office recently
released a report detailing long
range guidelines for development
in the Foothills region.
The plan presents guidelines
for eventual development across
virtually the entire area of the
Foothills, leaving only a 180-acre
segment untouched for continued
recreational use by the Stanford
community.
The latest report, titled
"Foothills Region Plan Phase
One," addresses the area of the
Foothills directly adjacent to
campus, including the familiar
trails to the Dish. Another, more
removed part of the Foothills —
the Felt Lake area — is not con
sidered in this report, but plans
for that land will be outlined
later, in Phase Two of the plan.
Since it is a guideline for future
development rather than a spe
cific proposal, the Foothills Plan
makes only a few recommenda
tions for immediate changes.
Those immediate changes in
clude paving and repairing
eroded roads and running trails
leading to the Dish from Junipero
Serra Boulevard, and hiring a
Foothills ranger to monitor the
area on motorcycle or horse
back.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington has said that "usage
is increasing" in the Foothills.
That increase may necessitate
the introduction of a ranger, ac
cruing io Herrington, because
"more impact (in the area)
causes more litter, and people
bring things up there they're not
supposed to."
In addition to hiring a ranger,
the University may drop its
"pass system" for entrance to
the Foothills. Currently, users of
the area are required to carry a
pass from the University Office
of Real Estate and Lands Man
agement.

The Foothills Plan recom
mends dropping this system,
which the Stanford community
has largely ignored, in favor of
simply carrying a Stanford ID.
The Foothills also are undergo
ing a long-term process of
reforestation, with native oak
trees being planted on the once
thickly wooded slopes.
Parts of the area are being
sealed off from grazing by live
stock for 10-year intervals in the
hope that new trees will grow.
Acorns and seedlings are also
being planted to supplement the
natural reforestation rate.
The University allows cattle
grazing in the Foothills to reduce
the danger of fires in areas of ac
cumulated dead grass. According
to the repor*. however, "decades
of cattle grazing have compacted
the soil and limited regeneration
of the native trees."
Although the 2000-acre Foot
hills region is "currently enjoyed
for its recreational and visual
qualities," it is ultimately a "land
reserve for academic programs,"
according to the report.
The report is based on Leland
and Jane Stanford's founding
grant of over 80(H) acres of land,
intended to be used for the Uni
versity's academic programs.
Because of the wording of the
grant, all of the Stanford campus
must be reserved for academic
use.
According to the Foothills
report, "this land bank has en
abled Stanford to support unique
facilities such as SLAC and
Jasper Ridge Biological Pre
serve, academic programs which
could not have been ac
comodated without available
land."
The region is especially
valuable because it is close to
campus but maintains a rural
character, according to Campus
Planner Tom Richmond. The
report calls the Foothills land
"an irreplaceable resource for
siting future academic programs
near the central campus while si
multaneously providing some
degree of isolation from it."

Richmond said the area would
not be retained as an open-space
preserve because the University
has "an obligation to use the land
for academic purposes.
"We have to think in terms of
centuries of use," he said, adding
that the formulators of the plan
"did discuss recreational goals,
but academic goals must take
precedence."
Although the Foothills Plan's
"intent is not to encourage devel
opment but to provide a
framework for meeting academic
needs while demonstrating re
sponsible stewardship of the
land," much of the report con
centrates on building and devel
opment in the Foothills.
Projects already planned for
the Foothills include an addi
tional student observatory, addi
tional communication and re
search antennae and expansion
or relocation of the Stanford Golf
Course.
The report designates all but
180 acres of the Foothills as
suitable for possible develop
ment. The 180-acre plot that is
excepted is the "bowl" area di
rectly behind the faculty housing
on the Foothills side of Junipero
Serra Boulevard.
Richmond said that "the most
efficient use of the land in the
long run is to keep the bowl in
tact as an environmental and
recreational resource." Even
with the development of the rest
of the region, this bowl would
"provide a vignette of what the
Spaniards saw," according to
one formulator of the plan.
Although plans call for no im
mediate development of the area,
"the University reserves the
right to site academic programs
within the bowl," according to
the report.
The report states that the bowl
"will be all the more valuable as
the need for relief from increased
urbanization grows."
However, Richmond said he
expected that the bowl would be
available as a recreational
resource "for decades, even cen
turies."

Other parts of the Foothills, in
cluding the main ridgetop (where
the Dish is located) and slopes
facing campus, may be de
veloped sooner. Although those
sites are considered more
sensitive visually, development
of them would be less destructive
ecologically than would be devel
opment of other areas in the
Foothills, according to the
report.
According to Richmond,
"There's no way you can build in
a creek or a steep slope without
permanent damage. For building
on open, less ecologically
sensitive areas, however, there
are techniques to lessen the vis
ual impact." The report lists
measures such as the use of trees
and partially buried buildings to
make construction in the area
less obvious.
The report admits, however,
that the visibility of open sites
"could make development politi
cally sensitive."
Samuel Brain, a physicist at

the Medical Center and a leading
opponent of the Reagan Library,
expressed concern that the
report discusses primarily the
visual impact of buildings visible
from roadways, and would not
protect some of the most beauti
ful, although hidden, sights in the
area.
"People driving by are not at
the top of my list," he said. "It
seems more reasonable to
develop the fringes of the Foot
hills and leave the center alone."
Development will be either in
"clusters" of buildings sharing a
common access road, or in iso
lated "outposts." Outposts
would be used for academic
facilities requiring isolation, such
as observatories and antennae
like the Dish.
The planned 5000-square-foot
art studio will be part of a cluster
of studios built over the next five
years near the golf course. The
art studio cluster will include
"four or five other buidings in
the area totalling 25.0(H) square

feet," according to Richmond.
According to the master map
included in the report, clusters
would be concentrated on slopes
facing the University.
Outpost facilities would be
built primarily along the central
ridgetop at about the same eleva
tion as the Dish, according to the
report. Both types of facilities
would be reached by long dead
end access roads.
The planned development in
the Foothills will be carried out'
with an eye to minimum impact,
according to the report. Build
ings may be partially buried and
painted with colors designed to
hlend into the environment.
Roads will be the minimum width
possible, and utilities will be
buried.
Lighting of the area will be de
signed so that it does not shine
directly into the sky. This is ne
cessary so that observatories and
other sensitive outposts are not
ruined by subsequent develop
ment.

measures such as the use of trees

The report admits, however,
that the visibility of open sites

Samuel Brain, a physicist at

expressed concern that the
report discusses primarily the
visual impact of buildings visible
from roadways, and would not
protect some of the most beauti
ful, although hidden, sights in the
area.
"People driving by are not at
the top of my list," he said. "It
seems more reasonable to
develop the fringes of the Foot
hills and leave the center alone."
Development will be either in
"clusters" of buildings sharing a
common access road, or in iso
lated "outposts." Outposts
would be used for academic
facilities requiring isolation, such
as observatories and antennae
like the Dish.
The planned 5000-square-foot
art studio will be part of a cluster
of studios built over the next five
years near the golf course. The
art studio cluster will include
"four or five other buidings in
the area totalling 25.0(H) square

feet," according to Richmond.
According to the master map
included in the report, clusters
would be concentrated on slopes
facing the University.
Outpost facilities would be
built primarily along the central
ridgetop at about the same eleva
tion as the Dish, according to the
report. Both types of facilities
would be reached by long dead
end access roads.
The planned development in
the Foothills will be carried out'
with an eye to minimum impact,
according to the report. Build
ings may be partially buried and
painted with colors designed to
hlend into the environment.
Roads will be the minimum width
possible, and utilities will be
buried.
Lighting of the area will be de
signed so that it does not shine
directly into the sky. This is ne
cessary so that observatories and
other sensitive outposts are not
ruined by subsequent develop
ment.

In the wake of last year's
struggle over the proposed siting
of the Ronald Reagan Presiden
tial Library, Stanford Univer
sity's Planning Office recently
released a report detailing long
range guidelines for development
in the Foothills region.
The plan presents guidelines
for eventual development across
virtually the entire area of the
Foothills, leaving only a 180-acre
segment untouched for continued
recreational use by the Stanford
community.
The latest report, titled
"Foothills Region Plan Phase
One," addresses the area of the
Foothills directly adjacent to
campus, including the familiar
trails to the Dish. Another, more
removed part of the Foothills —
the Felt Lake area — is not con
sidered in this report, but plans
for that land will be outlined
later, in Phase Two of the plan.
Since it is a guideline for future
development rather than a spe
cific proposal, the Foothills Plan
makes only a few recommenda
tions for immediate changes.
Those immediate changes in
clude paving and repairing
eroded roads and running trails
leading to the Dish from Junipero
Serra Boulevard, and hiring a
Foothills ranger to monitor the
area on motorcycle or horse
back.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington has said that "usage
is increasing" in the Foothills.
That increase may necessitate
the introduction of a ranger, ac
cruing io Herrington, because
"more impact (in the area)
causes more litter, and people
bring things up there they're not
supposed to."
In addition to hiring a ranger,
the University may drop its
"pass system" for entrance to
the Foothills. Currently, users of
the area are required to carry a
pass from the University Office
of Real Estate and Lands Man
agement.

The Foothills Plan recom
mends dropping this system,
which the Stanford community
has largely ignored, in favor of
simply carrying a Stanford ID.
The Foothills also are undergo
ing a long-term process of
reforestation, with native oak
trees being planted on the once
thickly wooded slopes.
Parts of the area are being
sealed off from grazing by live
stock for 10-year intervals in the
hope that new trees will grow.
Acorns and seedlings are also
being planted to supplement the
natural reforestation rate.
The University allows cattle
grazing in the Foothills to reduce
the danger of fires in areas of ac
cumulated dead grass. According
to the repor*. however, "decades
of cattle grazing have compacted
the soil and limited regeneration
of the native trees."
Although the 2000-acre Foot
hills region is "currently enjoyed
for its recreational and visual
qualities," it is ultimately a "land
reserve for academic programs,"
according to the report.
The report is based on Leland
and Jane Stanford's founding
grant of over 80(H) acres of land,
intended to be used for the Uni
versity's academic programs.
Because of the wording of the
grant, all of the Stanford campus
must be reserved for academic
use.
According to the Foothills
report, "this land bank has en
abled Stanford to support unique
facilities such as SLAC and
Jasper Ridge Biological Pre
serve, academic programs which
could not have been ac
comodated without available
land."
The region is especially
valuable because it is close to
campus but maintains a rural
character, according to Campus
Planner Tom Richmond. The
report calls the Foothills land
"an irreplaceable resource for
siting future academic programs
near the central campus while si
multaneously providing some
degree of isolation from it."

Richmond said the area would
not be retained as an open-space
preserve because the University
has "an obligation to use the land
for academic purposes.
"We have to think in terms of
centuries of use," he said, adding
that the formulators of the plan
"did discuss recreational goals,
but academic goals must take
precedence."
Although the Foothills Plan's
"intent is not to encourage devel
opment but to provide a
framework for meeting academic
needs while demonstrating re
sponsible stewardship of the
land," much of the report con
centrates on building and devel
opment in the Foothills.
Projects already planned for
the Foothills include an addi
tional student observatory, addi
tional communication and re
search antennae and expansion
or relocation of the Stanford Golf
Course.
The report designates all but
180 acres of the Foothills as
suitable for possible develop
ment. The 180-acre plot that is
excepted is the "bowl" area di
rectly behind the faculty housing
on the Foothills side of Junipero
Serra Boulevard.
Richmond said that "the most
efficient use of the land in the
long run is to keep the bowl in
tact as an environmental and
recreational resource." Even
with the development of the rest
of the region, this bowl would
"provide a vignette of what the
Spaniards saw," according to
one formulator of the plan.
Although plans call for no im
mediate development of the area,
"the University reserves the
right to site academic programs
within the bowl," according to
the report.
The report states that the bowl
"will be all the more valuable as
the need for relief from increased
urbanization grows."
However, Richmond said he
expected that the bowl would be
available as a recreational
resource "for decades, even cen
turies."

Other parts of the Foothills, in
cluding the main ridgetop (where
the Dish is located) and slopes
facing campus, may be de
veloped sooner. Although those
sites are considered more
sensitive visually, development
of them would be less destructive
ecologically than would be devel
opment of other areas in the
Foothills, according to the
report.
According to Richmond,
"There's no way you can build in
a creek or a steep slope without
permanent damage. For building
on open, less ecologically
sensitive areas, however, there
are techniques to lessen the vis
ual impact." The report lists
measures such as the use of trees
and partially buried buildings to
make construction in the area
less obvious.
The report admits, however,
that the visibility of open sites
"could make development politi

degree of isolation from it."

Richmond said the area would
not be retained as an open-space
preserve because the University
has "an obligation to use the land
for academic purposes.
"We have to think in terms of
centuries of use," he said, adding
that the formulators of the plan
"did discuss recreational goals,
but academic goals must take
precedence."
Although the Foothills Plan's
"intent is not to encourage devel
opment but to provide a
framework for meeting academic
needs while demonstrating re
sponsible stewardship of the
land," much of the report con
centrates on building and devel
opment in the Foothills.
Projects already planned for
the Foothills include an addi
tional student observatory, addi
tional communication and re
search antennae and expansion
or relocation of the Stanford Golf
Course.
The report designates all but
180 acres of the Foothills as
suitable for possible develop
ment. The 180-acre plot that is
excepted is the "bowl" area di
rectly behind the faculty housing
on the Foothills side of Junipero
Serra Boulevard.
Richmond said that "the most
efficient use of the land in the
long run is to keep the bowl in
tact as an environmental and
recreational resource." Even
with the development of the rest
of the region, this bowl would
"provide a vignette of what the
Spaniards saw," according to
one formulator of the plan.
Although plans call for no im
mediate development of the area,
"the University reserves the
right to site academic programs
within the bowl," according to
the report.
The report states that the bowl
"will be all the more valuable as
the need for relief from increased
urbanization grows."
However, Richmond said he
expected that the bowl would be
available as a recreational
resource "for decades, even cen
turies."

Other parts of the Foothills, in
cluding the main ridgetop (where
the Dish is located) and slopes
facing campus, may be de
veloped sooner. Although those
sites are considered more
sensitive visually, development
of them would be less destructive
ecologically than would be devel
opment of other areas in the
Foothills, according to the
report.
According to Richmond,
"There's no way you can build in
a creek or a steep slope without
permanent damage. For building
on open, less ecologically
sensitive areas, however, there
are techniques to lessen the vis
ual impact." The report lists
measures such as the use of trees
and partially buried buildings to
make construction in the area
less obvious.
The report admits, however,
that the visibility of open sites
"could make development politi
cally sensitive."
Samuel Brain, a physicist at

the Medical Center and a leading
opponent of the Reagan Library,
expressed concern that the
report discusses primarily the
visual impact of buildings visible
from roadways, and would not
protect some of the most beauti
ful, although hidden, sights in the
area.
"People driving by are not at
the top of my list," he said. "It
seems more reasonable to
develop the fringes of the Foot
hills and leave the center alone."
Development will be either in
"clusters" of buildings sharing a
common access road, or in iso
lated "outposts." Outposts
would be used for academic
facilities requiring isolation, such
as observatories and antennae
like the Dish.
The planned 5000-square-foot
art studio will be part of a cluster
of studios built over the next five
years near the golf course. The
art studio cluster will include
"four or five other buidings in
the area totalling 25.0(H) square

feet," according to Richmond.
According to the master map
included in the report, clusters
would be concentrated on slopes
facing the University.
Outpost facilities would be
built primarily along the central
ridgetop at about the same eleva
tion as the Dish, according to the
report. Both types of facilities
would be reached by long dead
end access roads.
The planned development in
the Foothills will be carried out'
with an eye to minimum impact,
according to the report. Build
ings may be partially buried and
painted with colors designed to
hlend into the environment.
Roads will be the minimum width
possible, and utilities will be
buried.
Lighting of the area will be de
signed so that it does not shine
directly into the sky. This is ne
cessary so that observatories and
other sensitive outposts are not
ruined by subsequent develop
ment.

Development of the Foothills will be carried out in two phases (left). The first phase of the plan details devel
opment in the areas adjacent to Junipero Serra Boulevard. Stanford also plans to reforest tne area in gradual
stages (right).

In the wake of last year's
struggle over the proposed siting
of the Ronald Reagan Presiden
tial Library, Stanford Univer
sity's Planning Office recently
released a report detailing long
range guidelines for development
in the Foothills region.
The plan presents guidelines
for eventual development across
virtually the entire area of the
Foothills, leaving only a 180-acre
segment untouched for continued
recreational use by the Stanford
community.
The latest report, titled
"Foothills Region Plan Phase
One," addresses the area of the
Foothills directly adjacent to
campus, including the familiar
trails to the Dish. Another, more
removed part of the Foothills —
the Felt Lake area — is not con
sidered in this report, but plans
for that land will be outlined
later, in Phase Two of the plan.
Since it is a guideline for future
development rather than a spe
cific proposal, the Foothills Plan
makes only a few recommenda
tions for immediate changes.
Those immediate changes in
clude paving and repairing
eroded roads and running trails
leading to the Dish from Junipero
Serra Boulevard, and hiring a
Foothills ranger to monitor the
area on motorcycle or horse
back.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington has said that "usage
is increasing" in the Foothills.
That increase may necessitate
the introduction of a ranger, ac
cruing io Herrington, because
"more impact (in the area)
causes more litter, and people
bring things up there they're not
supposed to."
In addition to hiring a ranger,
the University may drop its
"pass system" for entrance to
the Foothills. Currently, users of
the area are required to carry a
pass from the University Office
of Real Estate and Lands Man
agement.

The Foothills Plan recom
mends dropping this system,
which the Stanford community
has largely ignored, in favor of
simply carrying a Stanford ID.
The Foothills also are undergo
ing a long-term process of
reforestation, with native oak
trees being planted on the once
thickly wooded slopes.
Parts of the area are being
sealed off from grazing by live
stock for 10-year intervals in the
hope that new trees will grow.
Acorns and seedlings are also
being planted to supplement the
natural reforestation rate.
The University allows cattle
grazing in the Foothills to reduce
the danger of fires in areas of ac
cumulated dead grass. According
to the repor*. however, "decades
of cattle grazing have compacted
the soil and limited regeneration
of the native trees."
Although the 2000-acre Foot
hills region is "currently enjoyed
for its recreational and visual
qualities," it is ultimately a "land
reserve for academic programs,"
according to the report.
The report is based on Leland
and Jane Stanford's founding
grant of over 80(H) acres of land,
intended to be used for the Uni
versity's academic programs.
Because of the wording of the
grant, all of the Stanford campus
must be reserved for academic
use.
According to the Foothills
report, "this land bank has en
abled Stanford to support unique
facilities such as SLAC and
Jasper Ridge Biological Pre
serve, academic programs which
could not have been ac
comodated without available
land."
The region is especially
valuable because it is close to
campus but maintains a rural
character, according to Campus
Planner Tom Richmond. The
report calls the Foothills land
"an irreplaceable resource for
siting future academic programs
near the central campus while si
multaneously providing some
degree of isolation from it."

Richmond said the area would
not be retained as an open-space
preserve because the University
has "an obligation to use the land
for academic purposes.
"We have to think in terms of
centuries of use," he said, adding
that the formulators of the plan
"did discuss recreational goals,
but academic goals must take
precedence."
Although the Foothills Plan's
"intent is not to encourage devel
opment but to provide a

land," much of the report con
centrates on building and devel
