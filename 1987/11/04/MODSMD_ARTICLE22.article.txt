## 'Matewan' a dollar-stretching gem 
### Marc Borsak 
One would never guess that
John Sayles' new film ' Mate
wan was filmed on a relatively
small budget of $4.5 million. It
looks much richer than that.
Indeed, the film's authentic
look and rich texture are largely
what make it enjoyable. But the
film also benefits from a wonder
ful ensemble of actors and an ex
citing, old-fashioned story rich in
plot and characterization.
Matewan is a town in West Vir
ginia that was the site of a 1920
battle between coal mine owners
and their workers, who wanted a
union. It is an episode that is
largely neglected in history, but
Sayles makes it seem like one of
the most important events in the
country's past.
The movie begins with the arri
val in Matewan of two men: a un
ion worker named Joe Kenahan,
who comes to build a union, and
a big black man named hew
Clothes, who comes to the town
as a scab.
Joe must not only convince the

town's workers to form a union,
he must also convince them to
accept the black and Italian scabs
who have also become discon
tented and joined the union.
Eventually, he succeeds on both
counts, and the war is on.
I he company responds by
sending in two of its own agents,
who spend most of their time
harassing the residents of the
town, trying to evict families
from company-owned homes and
threatening violence against the
workers and their families. Joe,
who is a pacifist, tries unsuccess
fully to prevent the violence from
escalating into an all-out war.
Ihe acting is good across the
board. Chris Cooper is believable
as Joe. Nancy Mette is engaging
in her performance as a vulnera
ble young widow. David Strait
harn is menacing and believable
as Matewan's police chief, and
Will Oldham turns in a fine per
formance as Danny, a 12-year
old miner who also doubles as a
preacher at the local church.
Then there is James Earl
Jones. In the small role of Few

Clothes, one of the black men
who comes to town to work as a
scab but later joins the union,
Jones is irresistable. His is a very
restrained performance, but he's
got all of the little details per
fectly right: his laugh, his walk,

I he film looks
like it cost at least
four times more
than its $4.5-
million budget.

his gestures, his voice. And it
seems like it was no effort at all.
It just clicks, and it is one of the
best supporting movie perfor
mances in recent memory.
The film looks like it cost at
least four times more than its

$4.5-million budget. Haskell
Wexler's photography is beauti
ful, and Sayles' attention to
detail is admirable. Sayles knows
how to keep an audience in
volved; through his use of cross
editing we are drawn into the ac
tion, and the movie actually
becomes suspenseful in several
instances.
Sayles' writing reflects careful
attention to characterization, and
we become interested in his char
acters as people, not merely as
cardboard cutouts walking
around on screen, as happens so
often in today's films.
In style and substance, "Mate
wan' is an exciting film, What
makes it even more satisfying is
knowing that Sayles managed to
write, produce and direct this
film independently, without the
backing of a major studio. That
makes the movie seem even
more pure, more heartfelt. And
following the success of this film,
one hopes that Sayles will con
tinue the trend, rather than suc
cumbing to the plasticity of the
film industry.

Wexler's photography is beauti
ful, and Sayles' attention to
detail is admirable. Sayles knows
how to keep an audience in
volved; through his use of cross
editing we are drawn into the ac
tion, and the movie actually
becomes suspenseful in several
instances.
Sayles' writing reflects careful
attention to characterization, and
we become interested in his char
acters as people, not merely as
cardboard cutouts walking
around on screen, as happens so
often in today's films.
In style and substance, "Mate
wan' is an exciting film, What
makes it even more satisfying is
knowing that Sayles managed to
write, produce and direct this
film independently, without the
backing of a major studio. That
makes the movie seem even
more pure, more heartfelt. And
following the success of this film,
one hopes that Sayles will con
tinue the trend, rather than suc
cumbing to the plasticity of the
film industry.
