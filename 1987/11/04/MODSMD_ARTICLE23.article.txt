Its already about the time of year that the net
works start to eancel their unsuccessful shows ami
start flooding the airwaves with midseason
replacements, which are the worst as far as crea
tive entertainment goes.
A couple of The Daily's reporters managed to ob
tain copies oj some oj the production notes of TV
shows that are slated to air sometime this year.
Don't he surprised if you find that these shows hear

"PI L Cluh — I he Next Generation"
Join us each Saturday night for the new ad
ventures of Jim and Tammy Bakker on the Starship
free Enterprise. It's continuing mission: to seek
out new funds and proselytization, to boldly go
where no man has gone before.
"Veal of Fortune"
Hosts Pat Steakjak and Vanna Whitesauce lead
this fun-filled half-hour of game-show antics. Con
testants spin a large plate of veal parmesan and
then guess the identity of the food that is on the
plate with the veal.
"I'd like to buy a body part, Pat. Is there an
eye?"

"Yes!!! There are two eyes in this food."
"Is there a pea? Is there a tea? Is there a bee?"
DING, DING, DING!!! "That's right, you are
eating veal parmesan with mashed bees!"
"CBS Evening News with Dan Rather's Sweater"
Network exeeutives, realizing that the audience
tunes in only to see what Dan is wearing this week,
replace Rather with the exciting new fall wardrobe
of the deceased Perry Ellis. Rather's sweaters bril
liantly analyze and disseminate the news of the

Dressed Anchorman." The sweater then suddenly
walks off the broadcast, leaving six minutes of dead
air or Dan Rather himself— whichever will get
ter ratings, '

"ABC Sports Presents: Moonlighting"
Since both Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis
have long since become pregnant, injured, drunk,
bald and transsexual, it takes the technical magic of
ABC Sports to keep the show running.
Al Michaels and Jim Palmer take us through the

play-by-play of Bruce Willis' "acting" as Bruce
becomes insufferably cute, insufferably cocky and
insufferably insufferable. There will also be a slow
motion replay of each scene, thus saving the writ
ers from having to come up with more than 20
minutes of plot material. And, since the actors
refuse to be seen with each other, ABC's "split
screen allows them to perform crucial love scenes
together without actually being in the same
country.
"Bob Wood ward s Kest-ln-Peace Hour"
Journalist Bob Woodward finally gets his own
talk show in which he and the studio audience get
to talk with famous dead celebrities. In the
premiere show, he and co-host William Casey
analyze the recent developments in the stock mar
ket with the ghost of Liberace; in the cooking seg
ment, J. Edgar Hoover whips up his favorite beef
stew; and for your musical enjoyment, Yuri
Andropov gives his spirited rendition of "On
Broadway."
" The People's Supreme Court"
Unable to get anybody with a funny beard,
Keagan nominates Judge Wapner to the Supreme
Court. I he confirmation hearings begin to get ugly
when Senator Biden reveals some embarrassing
evidence about the Judge's past.

it seems that while he was still working in the
small claims court, Wapner ruled in favor of a yak
that had been accused of knocking over a bowl of
fruit. It turns out that Wapner had been a heavy in
vestor in a yak food company at the time, resulting
in conflict-of-interest charges.
Don t worry, folks, this is a light-hearted comedy
show, so everything works out for the best. Wap
ner eventually gets Senate confirmation, and he
ends up handing down wackily conservative rulings
on abortion, school prayer and equal rights. It's
something the whole family can enjoy.
"Sesame Street Blues"
l ed up with the decline of the U.S. educational
system, the Muppets join the police department in
order to physically force children to become
literate and well-educated. In the first episode, Big
Bird tars and feathers a couple of students who
have been using a slide rule instead of a Hewlett
Packard calculator.
Also, Ernie is torn between his loyalty to Bert
and his duty to the force when he must decide
whether or not to turn Bert in when he finds out
that Bert is guilty of racketeering and ending sen
tences with a preposition. Finally, the Cookie Mon
ster blasts his way through a whorehouse to
capture a pair of juvenile drug dealers who have,
been mixing metaphors and dangling modifiers.
