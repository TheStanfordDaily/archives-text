## Spikers outdueled by No. 2 Pacific in five 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Too bad it wasn't basketball . . .
The Stanford women's volleyball team
came up just short last night, losing to
Pacific 15-8, 3-15, 15-8, 6-15, 15-10 in
Maples Pavilion, giving the Cardinal its
first loss since before classes started in
September. Although the Cardinal out
scored the Tigers 56-54 overall, UOP was
able to maintain a high level of play
throughout, coming up with the big points
when necessary.
Stanford fell to 19-4 on the year, while
the Tigers are now 20-3.
"It was a great match," UOP middle
blocker Mary Miller said. "Both teams
played really well."
The Cardinal came into the match
ranked third in the nation, behind only
undefeated Hawaii and No. 2 Pacific.
And as is usually the case when these two
Northern California rivals meet, the con
test lived up to all expectations. The win
was the fifth in a row for Pacific in the se
ries, but each of the last four matches has
gone to five games.
It didn't look to be close when the
match started, however. Due to strong
blocking and the hitting problems of the
Cardinal, UOP raced out to a 10-1 lead in
front of the crowd of 2300. "We were real

tentative (at the start)," Stanford senior
Teresa Smith said.
A kill by Smith gave the Cardinal a
second point, but then Cathey Scotlan
took over.
Scotlan is a redshirt freshman who has
started as a middle blocker all year for the
Tigers because of the knee injury star
Elaina Oden suffered in June. Oden
thought the knee would heal eventually
without surgery, but it didn't, leaving her
on the sidelines for the entire season and
probably for the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
With surgery now scheduled for later this
month, it is hoped that Oden will be able
to return by the time play begins next fall.
Scotlan did her best Oden impression,
combining twice with junior Brooke Her
rington and once with senior Dorothy
Hert to block for three consecutive
points. Stanford was able to score five
more points, but it was too little, too late
as the Cardinal fell 15-8. The final point
was scored on another Scotlan block, this
one in tandem with senior Liz Hert, to
end the game.
In the first game, Scotlan came up with
six total blocks. For comparison, no one
on the Cardinal squad had more than six
for the entire match.

Despite a strong Cardinal effort aided by Lara Asper (22), Stanford fell
to visiting Pacific last night.
