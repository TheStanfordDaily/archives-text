# Cardinal attack all set with Rush
## 
### Cameron Macky 
Like a point guard in basket
ball, the setter in volleyball is a
team's guiding force. The setter
constantly must make split
seconu decisions under heavy
pressure on the court, and there
is less room for error than at any
other position. In short, consis
tency is the key for a setter.
And without a doubt, one of
the most consistent setters in the
country over the last four years
has been Stanford senior Wendi
Rush.
Rush, a three-time All-
America for the Cardinal
(honorable mention in 1984, first
team in '85 and second-team All-
America last year), is beginning
the stretch run of her final season
on the Farm. Stanford, 19-4 and
currently ranked third nationally,
narrowly lost a five-game match
last night against two-time
defending champion Pacific.
And, just as she has done in
every match for Stanford over
the last four years. Rush ran the
show as the Cardinal almost
pulled off the upset.
"Without a doubt, Wendi is
one of the best players we've
ever had, as far as setters go,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"She's steady, she's played with
injuries . . . she's basically done
everything we've asked her to
do.
"When she came here, she al
ready had a reputation, but over
her four years she's proven she's
one of the best setters in the
country," Shaw said.
That reputation was built at
Rim of the World High School in
Lake Arrowhead. Rush, who
was named California Inter
scholastic Federation Player of
the Year three consecutive
years, led her team to three

straight state titles and ended her
high school career as the No. I
college recruit in the country.
Rush's sister, Kari. who also
played volleyball at Stanford,
was something of a role model
for her younger sister. "When 1
first started, 1 always wanted to
play with my sister," Wendi
said. "Later on (in high school),
it wasn't so much that 1 wanted
to he like her, it was more that
my goal was the same as hers.
When she got a volleyball schol
arship. that became my g0a1,."
However, the younger Rush
was not overly enthusiastic about
following in her sister's footsteps
at Stanford. "1 almost didn't
come here because of her, be
cause we played the same posi
tion in the same sport. I just
didn't want to be [compared tol
my sister. 1 almost went to
UCLA. Then in the end, I think
she had an influence on me."
The transition from high
school to NCAA competition
wasn't as difficult as might have
been expected. Stanford had held
its preseason practices at Rim of
the World for several years when
Rush was in high school, and
Rush had also grown to know the
players through her sister.
"Coming in, 1 knew so many
of the players already ... 1 think
it (the transition) was easier for
me than for (fellow seniors)
Nancy (Reno) and Teresa
(Smith) just because of my
familiarity with the school and
the people," Rush said.
Rush spent her freshman
season as part of a two-setter of
fense. splitting the play-calling
duties with senior Deidra
Dvorak. But since her sopho
more year. Rush has been the
sole orchestrator of the offense.
"Wendi and Deidra were both
great setters, so it didn't make

sense for one to sit and watch the
other play," Shaw said. "But
with Deidra gone, we went to a
one-setter offense because we
hadn't actively recruited a setter
that year. We had to adjust our
system to the personnel we
had."
The added responsibility she
was given after her freshman
season made a difference in her
play, according to Rush, but
there are other factors in her con
tinued improvement as a setter,
as well as in the team's outstand
ing season thus far.
"My strength has improved a
lot, and that's made a big differ
ence in the quality of sets that
I'm giving," she said. "But 1
think I've become a lot more
emotionally involved also. Not
so much because it's my senior
year, but (because] I feel a lot
closer to the players. We're a
really tight unit this year, and
that makes all the difference."
That unity may well translate
into Stanford's sixth consecutive
Final Four appearance. But ac
cording to Rush, the Cardinal
can't afford to look that far
ahead. "Right now, before
looking to the NCAA finals,
we're looking to the regionals,
because it's just going to be a bat
tle. |With 1 BYU, UCLA, our
selves, USC, or even Colorado
State, it's the toughest regional,"
she said.
The Final Four has not been
kind to the Cardinal in the past.
One of Rush's worst memories is
of "the finals my freshman year.
We were leading 11-2 in the fifth
game and we lost. ... If I could,
I'd play my freshman year finals
over, my sophomore year finals
