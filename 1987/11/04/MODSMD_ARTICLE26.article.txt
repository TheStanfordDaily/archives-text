# Detested USC next for Card
## 
### 
I hate USC.
Yup, it's that time of year again. The
Stanford-USC game. Second only to Big Game.
What is it that makes this game seem so im
portant every year? It isn't as though Stanford
has a football powerhouse on the same level as
USC every year. The word "Cardinal'' probably
doesn't inspire the same kind of dread in football
teams around the country that "Trojan'' does.

Along the same lines, USC can't pretend to be
even remotely close to Stanford as an academic
institution. University of Second Choice? More
like Sixth Choice. Or 16th. Or 60th, if you feel
the way most Stanford students seem to feel.
So what is it about this admittedly inferior ed
ucational establishment that inspires such im
mense dislike here, at Cal and at UCLA?
Well, it's the attitude thing — the University
of Spoiled Children stuff. Stanford may have a
reputation for being a little uppity, but, hey, at
least we have some reason to be. Where was
USC in that U.S. News and World Report?
So USC has a football team. So what. The
school's basketball and baseball teams were at
the bottom of the conference last year — well
behind Stanford. The Trojan tennis team, with
coach Dick Leach and son Rick Leach, finished
ahead of Stanford last year but earned the eter
nal disgust of Georgia fans — and tennis fans in
general — with its poor sportsmanship at the
NCAA championships in Athens, Ga., last
spring.
Enter Marcus Cotton. Trojan linebacker. Can
didate for the prestigious Lombardi Trophy and
the Butkus Award. Team leader.
Big mouth.
"Stanford is a joke, just a joke," Cotton was
quoted as saying in a Seattle paper two weeks
ago. "I wouldn't insult a high school team by
comparing them to Stanford. I watched Stanford
play UCLA, and they were pathetic."
Ah, that Marcus. What a guy. Making friends
and influencing people. Now, of course, Cotton
says he can't remember saying such terrible
things about his buddies at Stanford. Must have
just slipped his mind.
"I apologize to everyone associated with the
Stanford football program," he said in a state
ment. "Ever since I grew up across the Bay (in
Oakland) I've always had the utmost respect for
the Stanford team."
Sure you have, Marcus. That reporter must
have completely misunderstood. In fact, Cotton
said in his statement that his remark had been
"misinterpreted."
1 guess when he said Stanford is a joke, he
meant it in the very best sense of the word. And
his implication that Stanford is worse than a high
school team was intended as a compliment, for
gosh sakes.
Even USC Coach Larry Smith, who has only
been at the Trojan helm for one season and isn't
yet familiar with such sophisticated and subtle
verbosity, says he doesn't think "it was meant
the way it sounded."
So why is Stanford taking this friendly, well
intentioned banter wrong? Hey guys, it was just
a joke. Why'd you pin it up in your locker room?
"Everyone read it and tucked it away for this
week," Stanford linebacker Kurt Colehower
said. "When the time comes to play them, that's
something to fuel the fire."
So the Cardinal now has even more to avenge
than last year's hard-fought 10-0 loss at Stan
ford. Cotton has just served to intensify the
rivalry and give the Cardinal a little extra incen
tive.
"I don't know what to say about him,"
Colehower said. "He's a very good linebacker,
and from what I've read in the paper, he will say
the same thing."

the way it sounded."
So why is Stanford taking this friendly, well
intentioned banter wrong? Hey guys, it was just
a joke. Why'd you pin it up in your locker room?
"Everyone read it and tucked it away for this
week," Stanford linebacker Kurt Colehower
said. "When the time comes to play them, that's
something to fuel the fire."
So the Cardinal now has even more to avenge
than last year's hard-fought 10-0 loss at Stan
ford. Cotton has just served to intensify the
rivalry and give the Cardinal a little extra incen
tive.
"I don't know what to say about him,"
Colehower said. "He's a very good linebacker,
and from what I've read in the paper, he will say
the same thing."
