SAN I A CLARA â€” Thriving on pressure,
the Stanford women's soccer team pulled out
a 2-2 tie in its last game of the season at Santa
Clara last night. I ne Cardinal ended its fourth
season as a varsity program with a record of
4-10-4.
Both teams started slowly as they warmed
up in the cool autumn air. The Broncos,
however, finally established some control.
With 7:40 to play in the first half, Santa Clara
defender Claire Walters found herself alone in
front of the net and placed a ground shot into
the left side of the net.
Stanford responded just 34 seconds later
when junior forward Stacey Keare lofted a
ball from 40 feet away that slipped under the
crossbar to make the score I-1 at halftime.
Sophomore forward Tonya Antonucci was
credited with the assist.
"1 took a lateral pass and no one was on
me, so I just booted it," Keare said.
In the second half, the Broncos raised the
tempo of the game a notch and kept the ball in
Cardinal territory much of the time. But Stan
ford s low-pressure defense kept the Broncos
at bay. I he score at the end of regulation was
1-1.
"Our defensive strategy frustrated them,"
Stanford Coach Berhane Andeberhan said.
"We kept dropping back and daring them to
penetrate. They were impatient."
In the first overtime, Santa Clara's All-
America forward Jenni Symons asserted her
self. Symons dribbled through the Cardinal
defense unassisted and fired a shot into the
right corner of the net to make the score 2-1
Broncos with 1:20 remaining in the 15-minute
period.
"The ball bounced off a Stanford defender
and came to my feet." Symons said. "There
was a clear path to the goal."
Santa Clara ate away at the clock in the
second overtime. The Cardinal's attempts to
equalize the score were stifled until, with 30
seconds left to play, junior defender Christy
McDevitt floated a cuiving shot from the top
of the goalie box. The ball twisted out of the
goalie's hands and bounced in the goal.
