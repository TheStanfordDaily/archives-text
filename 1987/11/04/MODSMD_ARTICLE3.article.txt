## 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
The Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors yesterday approved the alloca
tion of $10,000 to the Bay Area Sports Or
ganization Committee (BASOC) to help
fund its drive to bring the I99f> Summer
Olympics to the Bay Area.
In addition to $10.(KM) from the City of
San Francisco, $5000 from San Mateo
County and undisclosed amounts from
private sources, Santa Clara County's fi
nancial support will help defray the cost of
the Bay Area hid that was presented to the
U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) in mid-
September.
Funding will also defray the expense of

bringing members of the USOC to the Bay
Area for helicopter tours of the proposed
event locations.
"Hopefully we can get the Olympics
here, Santa Clara Supervisor Suzanne
Wilson said.
According to Supervisor Tom Legan,
the committee will select a site "early next
year' and forward its recommendation to
the International Olympic Committee.
Also bidding to host the Olympic games
are Minneapolis, Minn., Nashville. Tenn.,
and Atlanta, Ga.
Both Legan and BASOC member John
Boesch said Stanford's involvement in the
planning is vital to the success of the bid.
Boesch said he is very optimistic about
winning the bid and added that "without

Stanford's participation BASOC's bid
would not be on the sturdy ground it is."
According to the tentative plan for the
Bay Area Olympics, Stanford will house
nearly half of the athletes and be the site of
the opening and closing ceremonies as
well as the swimming and track and field
competition.
Legan said Stanford Stadium is the only
facility of its kind in this area able to ac
commodate the larger Olympic ceremon
ies.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger
and Assoc. Athletic Director Alan Cum
mings were unavailable for comment last
night but told The Daily on Monday that
the University is not eager to host the
Olympic games, but will do so if called

upon.
"Based on the success in Los Angeles
(site of the 1954 Summer Olympics), there
is a new philosophy in utilizing existing
sites to house the events," Legan said.
"We have a lot of viable athletic facilities
in the Bay Area, so I think we have a good
shot,' Legan said.
In addition to San Francisco. San Mateo
and Santa Clara counties. Contra Costa
and Alameda counties would host various
athletic events.
"These will truly be the Bay Area
Olympics, not the San Francisco Olym
pics," Boesch said.
Legan said he has encountered little op
position to the plan but that he is certain
controversy will arise.
