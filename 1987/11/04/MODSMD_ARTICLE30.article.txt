## 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
In another hard-fought battle
between Stanford and California,
the Stanford sailing team a
venged a close loss to the Golden
Bears two weeks ago with a con
vincing win last weekend in the
Stanford Invitational Regatta at
Redwood City.
While several schools from
Northern California competed in
the two-day event, the boats that
led most of the races were from
either Cal or Stanford.
In the A division, the Cardinal
was led by senior Tom Kuhnle
and junior Rita Snape, who sailed
their boat to victory 13 points
ahead of Cal's top boat, which
took second. Sophomore A 1 Sar
gent, with sophomore Jon
Schreiber and freshman Mi Rang
Yoon crewing, took third place in
A division, and junior Ev Rend

and freshman Sarah Gannett
took fourth.
The Cardinal was just as suc
cessful in the B division, where
senior Drew Gashler and fresh
man Kevin Hagan combined with
seniors Doug Hagan and Gina
Ottoboni to win the division.
Freshmen Dave Dowd and
Sharon Flom took second place.
According to Stanford Sailing
Coach Blake Middleton, the Car
dinal win was especially pleasing
because the home team was
tested by a wide variety of condi
tions, ranging from light zephyrs
to heavy winds.
"The team showed a real con
sistency overall, and everyone
had moments of really great
sailing," Middleton said. "We
had veteran skippers who never
finished below the top five, and
we had new teams that won their
first regatta races. It was a really
satisfying event."
