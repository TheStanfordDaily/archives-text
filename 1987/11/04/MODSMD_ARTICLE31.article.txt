# Gorbachev faces difficulty
## 
### Jennifer Jenkins 
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev faces "tough
going" in his efforts to reform a country that is
"deeply conservative" and hostile to change, ac
cording to Political Science Prof. Jan Triska.
Triska, who spoke to a group of about 30 stu
dents yesterday at Hurlburt, the Russian and East
ern European studies theme house, said
"restlessness" is enveloping the communist world.
"There is the perception that socialism has
failed," he said, adding that many socialist
countries are poor simply because they are
socialist. He said that a major change needs to oc
cur if socialism is to recover.
However, Triska said, this is problematic be
cause no precedent exists for a successful restruc
turing program.
Triska cited 10 instances of failed or suppressed
attempts to redefine socialist policy in the period
since the Russian Revolution, ranging from Lenin's
New Economic Policy — which introduced non
socialist economic techniques to save the flagging
Soviet economy — to Hungary's attempt during
the last 15 years to combine socialist economics
with policies of free enterprise.
"There was an attempt to marry the two," said
Triska,referring to the Hungarian example.
"Maybe socialism is better for some things and free
enterprise is better for others." A type of
"symbiosis" should be searched for, he added.
Gorbachev's planned reforms are changes that
"no other Soviet politician has attempted before,"
Triska said.
Triska said Gorbachev was in a "prisoner's di
lemma," in that no matter what he does, he is

bound to encounter strong opposition to his
proposals to decrease military spending, graft mar
ket forces onto the Soviet economy and establish a
competition of ideas in Soviet society.
According to Triska, Gorbachev's problems
stem from the fact that since Stalin's time, the main
objective of the Soviet Union has been to build it
self into a military superpower. However, Triska
said superpower status today requires political, so
cial and economic power as well as military
strength. "In a nuclear age there is no other way,"
he said.
The Soviet Union must back up its military might
with other strengths that were excluded in the drive
for military power, or "otherwise it's an empty mil
itary shell," Triska said.
Triska characterized Soviet society as "deeply
conservative" and resistant to change. "They (the
people) know how to live in the present state of af
fairs," he said, noting that innovations such as an
increase in food prices that have been heavily sub
sidized would not be welcome.
Complicating matters is the fact that Gorba
chev's economic advisers are divided as to the cor
rect course of action, Triska said, adding that eco
nomic reforms in the Soviet Union could have a de
stabilizing effect on Eastern Europe.
According to Triska, Gorbachev risks becoming
a failure in Soviet political history if he fails in his
reform effort. "He needs time and goodwill, and
unless he gets it he may follow Mr. Khrushchev,"
he said.
Triska said there has to be some combination of
socialist and democratic principles for socialism to
succeed, noting that Scandinavian countries are ex
amples of systems in which the two types of gov
ernment are combined.
