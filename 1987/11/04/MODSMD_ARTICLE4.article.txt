# Prof. wins school board seat
## Opponents of high school merger appear to have majority 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
In a hotly contested Palo Alto School Board elec
tion yesterday, candidates opposing a planned
merger of the district's high schools, including
Stanford Prof. Henry Levin, appeared late last
night to have scored a victory in the battle for three
open seats on the five-person board.
At press time last night, voting results from 30 of
the district's 40 precincts had been tallied. Levin, a
professor of economics and education, was leading
with 6K9K votes; Diane Reklis, another anti-merger
candidate followed with 6173: and Terry Trumball,
the final anti-merger candidate, was in third with
5666 votes. But Joe Simitian, an incumbent and
proponent of the merger, was only 7K votes behind
Trumball.

In another Stanford-related race, Raymond Bac
chetti, Stanford vice provost for Management and
director of University Budgets, appeared to have
retained his seat on the Foothill-De Anza Commu
nity College Board. Bacchetti was one of three in
cumbents who appear to have won the election by a
wide margin, defeating a single challenger, Los
Altos attorney Harry Price.
Reacting to the results, I.evin said, "Obviously I
am excited and very happy about |the election)."
He said he is looking forward to solving the finan
cial and educational problems plaguing the district,
and is anxious to get started.
"We kept it on an issue level and people
resonated to our issues," he said of his campaign.
"I think all of our opponents are quality people."
