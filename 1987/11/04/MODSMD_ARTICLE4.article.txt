# Prof. wins school board seat
## Opponents of high school merger appear to have majority 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
In a hotly contested Palo Alto School Board elec
tion yesterday, candidates opposing a planned
merger of the district's high schools, including
Stanford Prof. Henry Levin, appeared late last
night to have scored a victory in the battle for three
open seats on the five-person board.
At press time last night, voting results from 30 of
the district's 40 precincts had been tallied. Levin, a
professor of economics and education, was leading
with 6K9K votes; Diane Reklis, another anti-merger
candidate followed with 6173: and Terry Trumball,
the final anti-merger candidate, was in third with
5666 votes. But Joe Simitian, an incumbent and
proponent of the merger, was only 7K votes behind
Trumball.

In another Stanford-related race, Raymond Bac
chetti, Stanford vice provost for Management and
director of University Budgets, appeared to have
retained his seat on the Foothill-De Anza Commu
nity College Board. Bacchetti was one of three in
cumbents who appear to have won the election by a
wide margin, defeating a single challenger, Los
Altos attorney Harry Price.
Reacting to the results, I.evin said, "Obviously I
am excited and very happy about |the election)."
He said he is looking forward to solving the finan
cial and educational problems plaguing the district,
and is anxious to get started.
"We kept it on an issue level and people
resonated to our issues," he said of his campaign.
"I think all of our opponents are quality people."
Speculating on the possibility
of a victory by Simitian, Levin
said, "If we get two in, we might
be able to find someone responsi
ble among the other two mem
bers. I hope the school board is
not split three-to-two on every
issue."
The main issue in the school
board campaign was the planned
merger of Palo Alto's two high
schools, Gunn and Palo Aito
High, into one high school.
Simitian, who voted for the
merger, stated in his platform
that the Palo Alto School District

"does not have the money to
support four secondary
schools."
Presenting an opposing view.
Levin echoed the opinions of
Trumball and Reklis. "My basic
position is the district is richly
endowed with resources, and we
could do a lot better than we
have been doing,' he said.
Levin said that if the anti
merger candidates win, they will
vote to postpone the merger, at
least for now.
Whoever is elected to the
board will face many problems,
including low enrollment at some
schools, a budget deficit and the
poor quality of elementary
school science programs.
Reklis said Monday that it she

were elected, the school board
would make an effort to utilize
new resources. "There are a lot
of untapped sources of income
that have not yet been aggres
sively pursued," she said.
Voter turnout city-wide was
higher than average, according to
election officials. More than one
third of registered voters cast
ballots in the election.
But on campus at the polling
place in El C'entro Chicano,
fewer than 1 (X) people voted.
Other candidates in the school
board election included Debby
Mytels, who at press time had
received 4150 votes; Pam Marsh,
who had received 4792 votes;
and Ivan Kolozvari, who
received 777 votes.
