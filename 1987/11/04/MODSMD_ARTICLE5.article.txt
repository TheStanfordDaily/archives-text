Indicating a shift in University
nolicy. Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said yesterday that
the University is going to attempt
to strengthen support for non
residential fraternities and
sororities in the future.
In an interview with KZSU
and The Daily yesterday, Lyons
also said he doesn't foresee any
changes in the alcohol policy at
Stanford Stadium, citing an im
provement in student behavior
and spirit at last week's game.
"I don't know anyone who
wants to change the (alcohol)

policy," Lyons said.
With regard to non-residential
fraternities and sororities, Lyons
said the University is going to
reach out to those organizations
by providing additional services,
facilities and advisers.
"The University is frankly
going to pay less attention to resi
dential fraternities and more at
tention to fraternities and
sororities as organizations, be
cause the vast majority of mem
bers are in non-residential organ
izations," Lyons said.
Although the Interfraternity
Council (IFC) has set un a task
force to study the role of alcohol
in the fraternity system, Lyons

said ho doesn't foresee any
changes in guidelines governing
alcohol use until "the IFC gets
up the courage to have a dry
rush."
l.yons said a University call
for a dry rush "was in the
cards," but the fraternities
should take it upon themselves to
come to the decision.
Fraternities "get a rap that
they organize their lives around
alcohol," Lyons said. "It's an
unwanted stereotype, but like all
stereotypes, it has far too much
truth in it."
Although the residential frater-
nity system has been criticized
for having few minority members
and the IFC has also set up a task
force to study the role of
minorities in fraternities, Lyons
said minority representation in
row houses is the same as in the
residential fraternities.
Regarding student misconduct,
Lyons said the reported rise in
alcohol- related incidents may be
due to an increase in student in
tolerance for "that type of hell

raising, because the complaints
are coming from the students
themselves."
He cited the new student alco
hol monitors at the stadium as an
example of student concern
about the problem.
In other matters, Lyons said
office space for student groups
will be increased in the near fu
ture.
When the Near West Campus
development is completed, some
space at the center of campus
will be available for student
groups, Lyons said. Assistant
Dean of Campus Affairs Michael
Jackson heads a task force cur
rently studying the subject.

In addition, Lyons said the
plans to build an addition to Tres
idder Union are "moving
swiftly."
When asked about Stanford
ties to the exclusive Bohemian
Club in San Francisco, Lyons
said the University doesn't have
any official policy concerning the
club.
The Bohemian Club has been
criticized for its refusal to admit
women. The United Stanford
Workers (USW) will hold a press
conference today concerning the
University's ties to the club, of
which several Stanford profes
sors reportedly are members.
