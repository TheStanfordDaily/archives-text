# GLAS completes renovations
## Old Firehouse gets new look 
### David Kazanjian 
After two months of caulk
ing, sanding and painting,
members of the Clay and Les
bian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) have finished the reno
vation of their facilities in the
Old Firehouse.
rhe renovation, the first
major improvement of the Old
Firehouse in 14 years, was
carried out completely by stu
dent volunteers. Student Or
ganizational Services (SOS)
gave GLAS the materials and
donated new carpeting.
"It gives us a feeling of a
fresh start. It's rejuvenating,"
said Atticus Tysen, one of the
organizers of the project and a
senior in symbolic systems.
"It's a good way to finally start
the year."
Although the gay and lesbian
community missed having a
community space during the
first month of the quarter,
those involved in the restora
tion said the project itself was a
community-building effort, ac
cording to Tysen.
"I think it is very important
that students teel a sense of re
sponsibility to their space on
campus, especially since there
is a problem of there not being
enough office space for student
groups," he said.

Tysen said the 35 to 40
people who worked on the ren

ovation feel much more a part
of GLAS, and that everyone in
volved in Cil .AS can now feel
more at home in the renovated
space.
I ysen noted that the project
was especially good for the
freshmen and sophomores in
volved in GI.AS this year,
"because they have only seen
it in the process of renovation.
They never saw it like it was
before, and so they really feel

like it is really theirs now."
One student who worked on
the project said, "Once when I
was painting over one of the
walls, a GI.AS alum who was
here helping said . . . that he
had painted that wall 114 years
ago). I think that's a great sense
of continuity and contribution
to this place."

its space soon, with a grand
opening party within the next
two weeks. GLAS will also con
tinue to hold its gay and lesbian
discussion groups at the Old

Firehouse and intends to con
tinue inviting speakers, hosting
social events and organizing edu
cational projects for the Stanford
community there.
The renovation is part of a
larger plan for student office
space being considered by the
University, which includes res
toring the historically significant

architecture of the 85-year-old
building to its original condition.
According to local architect
David Zink-Brody, gay and les
bian community members have
asked the University to return
the building to its original condi
tion in an effort to make the
space more usable for GLAS and
other student groups.
