White House shuffles top advisers
WASHING lON — The Reagan administration, braced for a
major shuffling of its top national security posts in anticipation
of the resignation of Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, is
preparing a new alignment of senior advisers to President
Reagan in the midst of final plans for the U.S.-Soviet summit
conference barely one month away.
In the short run, the expected departure of Weinberger is not
expected to have a major policy impact. Citing his lack of in
volvement in the last meeting between Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev in Iceland, for example, administration offi
cials predicted that the secretary's absence would have no im
pact on current summit preparations.
But hard-line conservatives expressed fears Yesterday that
his likely replacement by national security adviser Frank Car
lucci, widely known as a conciliator, may weaken the Pentagon
in disputes over arms control policy with the State Department.
"1 don't think Carlucci has the same relationship with the
president that Weinberger has. That has been instrumental in
the exercise of influence by Weinberger," a former senior Pen
tagon official said.
Some conservatives complained that former Sen. John G.
Tower (R-Texas) would be a better choice for the post because
he enjoys the president's confidence and is seen as a hard-liner
on arms control issues.
These critics believe that Carlucci's nomination was en
gineered by White House chief of staff Howard Baker Jr. and
Secretary of State George Shultz — his allies among the so
called administration "pragmatists" in their continuing dispute
with the president's more conservative allies — to guarantee
their authority over foreign policy.
Blood recipients to get AIDS tests
In a development with potential national implications, four
San Francisco-area hospitals are encouraging about 50,000
patients who received blood transfusions between 197 Sand
March 1985 to be tested for infection with the AIDS virus.
The publicity surrounding the separate mailings by the Uni
versity of California Medical Center, San Francisco, and by
Kaiser Permanente hospitals in San Francisco and suburban
San Rafael and Vallejo is likely to force hospitals across the
country to decide if they have a similar obligation to notify their
transfusion patients and offer free AIDS antibody testing.
The UC-San Francisco mailing, which was completed last
month, and the Kaiser mailing, which is set to begin around the
end of the year, are also being debated in the Bay Area.
Both notifications involve blood collected by the San
Francisco-based Irwin Memorial Blood Bank, which supplies
blood from about 100 000 donois each year to 43 hospitals in
eight Northern California counties, including San Francisco,
Marin and Napa. The other 39 hospitals have not announced
similar plans.
"We were cautioned against this for fear that we would alarm
individuals who had no reason to be concerned," said Dr.
Elizabeth Donegan, director of the blood bank at UC-San Fran
cisco. "But we felt that we had a responsibility to notify people
of their potential exposure in order to do what we could to stop
the spread of this infectious disease."
Deficit reduction talks meandering
,ir Ii • i»y*>4 »
WASHINGTON — White House and congressional
negotiators focused yesterday on a $30-billion deficit reduction
plan that combines equal amounts of spending cuts and taxes,
but participants said the talks that began last week in an atmos
phere of urgency were meandering.
While Democrats complained that the White House
negotiators were inflexible on taxes. Republicans charged that
Democrats were unyielding in their refusal to consider further
domestic spending cuts.
As a result of the inability to agree on a basic strategy, every
proposal being presented behind the closed doors of the meeting
room was going up "in a cloud of smoke," said one dishear
tened negotiator. Rep. Silvio Conte (R-Mass.)
At the same time, partisan friction was building with the ap
proach of the deadline for averting painful automatic spending
cuts, now only two weeks away. Each side has begun speculat
ing that the other might be trying to scuttle the talks for political
reasons.
"We're beginning to suspect each other's motives," Rep.
Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said.
U.S. Navy blunder destroys skiff
SHARJAH. United Arab Emirates — A U.S. Navy frigate
mistook an unarmed Emirates fishing skiff for an Iranian gun
boat when it fired upon the vessel Sunday evening, killing an In
dian crew member, witnesses and shipping sources said Yester
day.
"It was not an Iranian gunboat they attacked. It was one of
our fishing boats, and one of the three crew members was
killed, said an authoritative shipping official. Another shipping
source labeled the attack "stupid" and "tragic."
Most of those interviewed would not allow their names to be
used, with one official citing the Emirates government's ex
treme sensitivity over the incident. But all gave similar ac
counts. They included a crewman aboard the 30-foot-long fish
ing boat, the Al Hudei, and the employer of the victim, who was
identified by hospital sources as Jagadeh Baghadan, 26, from
Gujarat, India.
The incident occurred shortly after nightfall Sunday near the
Iranian-held island of Abu Musa in the southern Persian Gulf,
northwest of the Emirates port of Sharjah, as the guided missile
frigate Carr was escorting an American cargo ship out of the
gulf.
I he Pentagon said the Carr fired at a "suspected Iranian gun
boat when it failed to heed warnings to stop and continued an
"apparently hostile run" toward the cargo ship, the MV Patriot.
Falwell leaves politics for religion
Fundamentalist leader Jerry Falwell announced yesterday
that he is resigning as president of Moral Majority and Liberty
Federation, thus continuing a pullback from politics he had
begun before getting sidetracked this year by the PTL scandal.
" There is no need now for Jerry Falwell to walk point and be
the lightning rod.' he said, referring to the controversial organi
zation that led the 1979-K0 rise of the politically oriented Reli
gious Right.
Falwell named businessman Jerry Nims, the chief executive
officer for Falwell's ministries, as his successor at the two lob
bying organizations.
"I am now rededicating my life to the preaching of the
gospel," Falwell told a news conference in Washington. He
added, however, that he would not stop "crying out" against
what he sees as moral evils. And.he said, he will continue his
support of Vice President George Bush 's quest for the Republi

volvement in the last meeting between Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev in Iceland, for example, administration offi
cials predicted that the secretary's absence would have no im
pact on current summit preparations.
But hard-line conservatives expressed fears Yesterday that
his likely replacement by national security adviser Frank Car
lucci, widely known as a conciliator, may weaken the Pentagon
in disputes over arms control policy with the State Department.
"1 don't think Carlucci has the same relationship with the
president that Weinberger has. That has been instrumental in
the exercise of influence by Weinberger," a former senior Pen
tagon official said.
Some conservatives complained that former Sen. John G.
Tower (R-Texas) would be a better choice for the post because
he enjoys the president's confidence and is seen as a hard-liner
on arms control issues.
These critics believe that Carlucci's nomination was en
gineered by White House chief of staff Howard Baker Jr. and
Secretary of State George Shultz — his allies among the so
called administration "pragmatists" in their continuing dispute
with the president's more conservative allies — to guarantee
their authority over foreign policy.
Blood recipients to get AIDS tests
In a development with potential national implications, four
San Francisco-area hospitals are encouraging about 50,000
patients who received blood transfusions between 197 Sand
March 1985 to be tested for infection with the AIDS virus.
The publicity surrounding the separate mailings by the Uni
versity of California Medical Center, San Francisco, and by
Kaiser Permanente hospitals in San Francisco and suburban
San Rafael and Vallejo is likely to force hospitals across the
country to decide if they have a similar obligation to notify their
transfusion patients and offer free AIDS antibody testing.
The UC-San Francisco mailing, which was completed last
month, and the Kaiser mailing, which is set to begin around the
end of the year, are also being debated in the Bay Area.
Both notifications involve blood collected by the San
Francisco-based Irwin Memorial Blood Bank, which supplies
blood from about 100 000 donois each year to 43 hospitals in
eight Northern California counties, including San Francisco,
Marin and Napa. The other 39 hospitals have not announced
similar plans.
"We were cautioned against this for fear that we would alarm
individuals who had no reason to be concerned," said Dr.
Elizabeth Donegan, director of the blood bank at UC-San Fran
cisco. "But we felt that we had a responsibility to notify people
of their potential exposure in order to do what we could to stop
the spread of this infectious disease."
Deficit reduction talks meandering
,ir Ii • i»y*>4 »
WASHINGTON — White House and congressional
negotiators focused yesterday on a $30-billion deficit reduction
plan that combines equal amounts of spending cuts and taxes,
but participants said the talks that began last week in an atmos
phere of urgency were meandering.
While Democrats complained that the White House
negotiators were inflexible on taxes. Republicans charged that
Democrats were unyielding in their refusal to consider further
domestic spending cuts.
As a result of the inability to agree on a basic strategy, every
proposal being presented behind the closed doors of the meeting
room was going up "in a cloud of smoke," said one dishear
tened negotiator. Rep. Silvio Conte (R-Mass.)
At the same time, partisan friction was building with the ap
proach of the deadline for averting painful automatic spending
cuts, now only two weeks away. Each side has begun speculat
ing that the other might be trying to scuttle the talks for political
reasons.
"We're beginning to suspect each other's motives," Rep.
Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said.
U.S. Navy blunder destroys skiff
SHARJAH. United Arab Emirates — A U.S. Navy frigate
mistook an unarmed Emirates fishing skiff for an Iranian gun
boat when it fired upon the vessel Sunday evening, killing an In
dian crew member, witnesses and shipping sources said Yester
day.
"It was not an Iranian gunboat they attacked. It was one of
our fishing boats, and one of the three crew members was
killed, said an authoritative shipping official. Another shipping
source labeled the attack "stupid" and "tragic."
Most of those interviewed would not allow their names to be
used, with one official citing the Emirates government's ex
treme sensitivity over the incident. But all gave similar ac
counts. They included a crewman aboard the 30-foot-long fish
ing boat, the Al Hudei, and the employer of the victim, who was
identified by hospital sources as Jagadeh Baghadan, 26, from
Gujarat, India.
The incident occurred shortly after nightfall Sunday near the
Iranian-held island of Abu Musa in the southern Persian Gulf,
northwest of the Emirates port of Sharjah, as the guided missile
frigate Carr was escorting an American cargo ship out of the
gulf.
I he Pentagon said the Carr fired at a "suspected Iranian gun
boat when it failed to heed warnings to stop and continued an
"apparently hostile run" toward the cargo ship, the MV Patriot.
Falwell leaves politics for religion
Fundamentalist leader Jerry Falwell announced yesterday
that he is resigning as president of Moral Majority and Liberty
Federation, thus continuing a pullback from politics he had
begun before getting sidetracked this year by the PTL scandal.
" There is no need now for Jerry Falwell to walk point and be
the lightning rod.' he said, referring to the controversial organi
zation that led the 1979-K0 rise of the politically oriented Reli
gious Right.
Falwell named businessman Jerry Nims, the chief executive
officer for Falwell's ministries, as his successor at the two lob
bying organizations.
"I am now rededicating my life to the preaching of the
gospel," Falwell told a news conference in Washington. He
added, however, that he would not stop "crying out" against
what he sees as moral evils. And.he said, he will continue his
support of Vice President George Bush 's quest for the Republi
can presidential nomination.
