## China blocks missile sales to Iran 
### 
BEIJING, China — U.S. Undersecretary
of State Michael Armacost said here yester
day that Chinese officials have pledged to
prevent Silkworm missiles from being
delivered to Iran.
In meetings with Vice Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen and other Chinese officials, Ar
macost said, "There was a repetition of their
intent to undertake strict measures to prevent
diversion of Chinese-origin equipment to
Iran."
U.S. officials have charged that China sold
Iran the Chinese-made anti-ship Silkworm
missiles that Iran is now using in the gulf
area. The United States also accuses China of
selling vast quantities of other military equip
ment to Iran.
Last month, the United States suspended

liberalization of high-technology exports to
China in retaliation for the alleged Silkworm
sales. Armacost said Yesterday that as far as
he is aware, no additional retaliatory
measures against China are under considera
tion.
China has repeatedly denied selling the
Silkworms to Iran and further denies that it
sells any weapons to either Iran or Iraq,
which have been at war since 1980. On Mon
day, Premier and General Secretary Zhao
Ziyang, speaking with reporters at a recep
tion in the Great Hall of the People, called the
U.S. charges "completely groundless."
"It is unfair to shift the responsibility of the
intensification of the tensions in the gulf
region to China," Zhao said.
But at a press conference at the U.S. Em

bassy here Yesterday, Armacost cited with
approval a statement made by Zhao in Sep
tember in an interview with NBC News.
"We noted recently that Premier Zhao
Ziyang said in an interview with Tom Brokaw
— while repeating the well-known position of
the government that no sales are directed
toward either Iran or Iraq — that in light of
the current concerns, strict measures are
being taken to prevent diversion of Chinese
origin equipment to Iran," Armacost said.
"That is a welcome statement," he added.
"I'm not certain what the strict measures are,
but 1 hope they are strict, and I hope they'll
have the effect of avoiding further deliveries
of Chinese-origin equipment by whatever
means."
