# IFC plans to set its own policy

### Sean Kinch Staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council
will "ignore" pressure from the
University to institute a dry Rush
and will continue to formulate a
Rush policy based on its own
considerations, IFC President
Vinny Frost said yesterday.
Responding to comments
made by Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons during a KZSU in
terview Tuesday night in which
Lyons said the IFC should get
"the courage to have a dry
Rush/' Frost said that the IFC
had already begun discussion of
Rush policy and that "courage
has nothing to do with it. . . . We
are concentrating on what is best
for us."
Frost said he was disappointed
by Lyons' statement that the
stereotype o f fraternities organiz
ing their lives around alcohol
"has too much truth to it."
"If (Lyons) knew what frater
nity members were up to and
how involved they are in the
community, he would see that al
cohol is not as big a part of their
life as his comments suggest,"
said Frost.
Frost added that misconcep
tions about the actions of frater
nity members are largely due to
stereotypes that fraternities must
work to overcome. Frost said
fraternities "want the University
people to get to know us better.
Frost said he was guardedly
pleased by Lyons' comment that
"the University is frankly going
to pay less attention to residen
tÂ«'U fraternities and more atten
tion to fraternties and sororities
as organizations."
"I was encouraged by Lyons
saying that the University is
shifting its focus to the off
campus fraternities, which have
been neglected in the past,"
Frost said. "But I hope he meant
that he will give equal attention
to all fraternities."
Frost contended that the IFC
wants to formulate a Rush policy
that will best "allow rushees to
make more informed choices
about fraternities."
"It is more likely than it has
ever been in the past that the IFC
will sponsor a dry Rush. There
are more arguments than ever
from within the IFC for a dry
Rush," Frost said.
