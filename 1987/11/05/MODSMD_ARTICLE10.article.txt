# Gorbachev calls for cooperation

### 
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev said yesterday that capitalists and Com
munists must learn to coexist and compete
peacefully, even if they never love each
other.
"We do not expect our class adversary to
become enamored of us," Gorbachev said.
"We do not need that at all. We count on his
reckoning with the realities and realizing that
we are all in the same boat, and we must be
have ourselves so that it will not capsize."
He made the observation at a Kremlin
meeting of foreign political parties and
workers' organizations in Moscow for the
70th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolu
tion.
But he appeared to be aiming his message
at President Reagan and the conservative
leaders of other Western countries that have
been the traditional adversaries of the com
munist bloc.
Alexander Yakovlev, a member of the
Politburo and a close associate of Gorbachev,
has said that Gorbachev firmly intends to

pursue improved relations with the United
States. But Gorbachev, in his brief remarks
yesterday, called for international coopera
tion on a broad range of global problems
beyond the arms-control issues he will dis
cuss with Reagan at a meeting in Washington
starting Dec. 7.
"No country is likely to radically solve the
energy problem on its own, any more than
develop the riches of the world's oceans," he
said. "Only joint action can weaken and
remove the global danger of an ecological sei
zure. Finally, only the collective reason of
humankind is a match for the job of goinc into
outer space, and further to the solar and stel
lar spaces."
At one point, Gorbachev acknowledged
that socialism is trailing the capitalist world in
technology, but he added that "the condi
tions for overcoming this lag are taking shape
as perestroika, the revolutionary reorganiza
tion of Soviet society, makes headway."
He said that the international impact of his
program is removing the political justification

for an arms buildup in the West.
"Awesome signals are also being issued by
the financial system, which is not coping with
the super-burden of the arms race, the
astronomical state debts and the hegemonic
economic egoism," he said.
His speech, carried by the official news
agency Tass, contained assurances for
leaders of other national Communist parties
who have assembled in Moscow tor the anni
versary.
"As we set forth our concepts of the new
way of thinking, we do not in the least claim a
monopoly on the truth,"he said. "We are en
gaged in a search ourselves and invite others
to look jointly for ways whereby humanity
could cross the mine field of our times and
emerge in the 21st century in a nuclear-free
and non-violent world."
He had some harsh words about Moscow's
fading prestige in the 19705, when the late
Leonid Brezhnev presided over what is now
called the "stagnation period."
