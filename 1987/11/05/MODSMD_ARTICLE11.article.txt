# Iran-contra panels set to vote
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The con
gressional Iran-Contra commit
tees, which launched their in
quiry 11 months ago promising to
get to the bottom of the scandal,
are scheduled to vote today on a
final report of their investigation
that some members and top staff
attorneys say records their fail
ure to uncover the complete
story.
The critics in the committees
said mistakes by the House and
Senate panels — primarily the
self-imposed deadlines that en
couraged delaying tactics by the
White House and assisted
lawyers representing such key
witnesses as Marine Lt. Col.
Oliver North — helped to hem in
the probe and discourage inves

tigators from following up some
important leads bearing on the
Reagan administration's worst
crisis.
In hindsight, they said in
recent interviews, the problems
included their own rush to open
nationally televised public
hearings, the initial choice of wit
nesses who quickly out
maneuvered the committees' in
terrogators, foot-dragging by ex
ecutive branch agencies in pro
viding key documents, and a fail
ure to question a number of wit
nesses. They also faulted the
desire of many panel members to
quickly end the inquiry in the
wake of North's performance
and Rear Adm. John Poindex
ter's assertion that President

Reagan had not known of the di
version of funds from the Iran
arms sales to the Nicaraguan
Contras.
"We blew it," a top committe
counsel said recently. "At this
point, it's up to (independent
counsel Lawrence) Walsh to find
out what really happened.''
Most members acknowledge
that the committees did not get
the complete story, but they also
agree with Senate committee
Chairman Daniel Inouye (D-
Hawaii), who said recently, "We
went as far as any committee
could ... as humanly possible
considering the time restraints
. . . shredded papers and the un
availability of (the late Central
Intelligence Agency Director

William) Casey.
However, interviews with
more than 20 members and com
mittee investigators over the past
several weeks point to additional
factors that inhibited the inquiry,
including the following:
• Unresolved disagreements
over how to run the inquiry. For
example, the Senate panel turned
down a September proposal by
House Democrats, including
Chairman Lee Hamilton of In
diana to send written questions
to Reagan about his knowledge
and role in the affair. Instead, ac
cording to Inouye, the White
House was told "if the president
had a desire to appear, we would
accommodate him."
