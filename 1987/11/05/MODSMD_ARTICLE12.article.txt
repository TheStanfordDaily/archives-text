## 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
I he University Committee on
Minority Issues yesterday
released a tentative working
agenda that calls for better
recruitment and support of ethnic
minority faculty, staff and stu
dents.
I he agenda focuses on 12
ethnic-related issues: curricu
lum; undergraduate and graduate
support services; undergraduate
and graduate financial support;
undergraduate and graduate
recruitment and admissions; fac
ulty and staff recruitment, hiring,
promotion and development;
multicultural relations; institu
tional social responsibility; and
minority representation and par
ticipation in policy.
" These issues are in no partic
ular order," said Committee
Chair Albert Camarillo, associate
professor of history. "Our next
meeting is to prioritize these
main issues."
Questions on minority student
retention, outreach and recruit
ment, as well as levels of finan

cial aid, were also raised and will
be discussed at the committee's
next meeting, Camarillo said.
According to Fernando de
Necochea, assistant provost and
a member of the committee, the
agenda is only a starting point.
"The working agenda is really a
living agenda' and we plan to
continue adding to it,"he said.
Following the general charge
of the committee made last July
by University President Donald
Kennedy and Provost James
Rosse, tne committee will try to
"assess the institutional environ
ment of people of color" and will
"collaborate with legislative
bodies and executive officers" to
implement policy changes,
clarifications and, where needed,
suggest that new policies be
adopted by the University.
"We have an enormous
agenda to work with," Camarillo
said. "Our duties include gather
ing data, generating ideas and
coming up with recommenda
tions and solutions to the prob
lems. In some cases it will be
recommending new policies."
