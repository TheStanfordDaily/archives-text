# Residents protest parking deficiency

Roble Hall residents plan to
file a letter with the Stanford
Police Department's parking of
fice this week protesting the
dorm's lack of parking spaces .
"We've been having a problem
in that there seem to be more stu
dents with cars (at Roble) this
year than in years before," ex
plained Roble Resident Assistant
D.J. Dull, who is helping organ
ize a student response to the
parking problem there.
Dull and other Roble residents
are writing a letter that proposes
redesignating the 'A spaces in
front of Roble to 'Dormitory
West' spaces, which would allow
residents of the 300-person dor
motory to park there, or that the
lot on the east side of the building
be designated a Roble lot.
"We're hoping to get everyone
with a car to sign the letter," Dull
said. "If the letter is ignored, like
individual complaints have been,
we'll get an organized gathering
of students together to go [to the
Stanford parking office |."

Roble residents discussed
specifics of the letter last night at
a house meeting.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington said some of the
problem may be due to ongoing
construction in the Governor's
Corner parking lot.
Since 50 to 70 parking spaces
are blocked by the construction,
Herrington said, some Gover
nor's Corner residents are
parking in Lagunita Court
parking lot. This causes some
Lagunita Court residents to park
in front of Roble.
However, Herrington said
there "should easily be 70 extra
spaces in the Dormitory West
area." He said the space was
available, but "not where people
are used to looking." Some
Roble residents might have to
park in front of Florence Moore
Hall, he said.
Herrington said the construc
tion at Governor's Corner has al
ready taken longer than planned.
"I'm hoping on a daily basis that
they get out of there," he said.
