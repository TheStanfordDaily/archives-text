The wonders of modern television are threat
ening the quality of Stanford education.
In a very unfortunate move, the University
has begun to beam engineering classes into stu
dent residences via SUNet, Stanford's cable net
work system. Now students can avoid class and
miss out on very important student-teacher in
teraction.
Although recording classes on video and al
lowing students to view them in libraries in order
to review or to catch unavoidably missed classes
is a good idea, transmitting classes into dorms
only encourages students to skip class.
Even worse, the idea invites abuse by those
teaching courses. Engineering Prof, and Vice
President for Development Henry Riggs is too
busy to teach his class this quarter more than
two days a week, so he's decided to tape the
third day's lecture to be broadcast to students.
For one-third of the course, Riggs' students
aren't even given the opportunity to hear
lectures live.

Even though Riggs' case is exceptional in that
he is a very popular professor who has an unus
ual administrative commitment, it is easy to
imagine that other popular professors with re
sponsibilities outside of teaching could get away
with taping classes at their convenience.
No matter how popular the professor, stu
dents shouldn't allow any lecture to be restricted
to tape. Whether the class is in a technical field
or in the humanities, a formal classroom setting
and the ability to interrupt a professor during a
lecture for clarification are important to educa
tional communication.
The practice of transmitting taped lectures
sets a dangerous precedent that could undercut
the essential personal and interactive elements
of the educational process.
The University should not allow professors to
give lectures on Memorex instead of live. If a
professor can't make scheduled class times, the
course should be rescheduled or someone else
should teach it.
