# Disquieting lessons of 'Star Trek'
## 
### 
The quintessential cult television show
"Star Trek," like all good serials, had a few
constantly recurring themes that devotees
could readily identify in each episode, almost
from the opening credits.
Not five minutes of the show would elapse
before one could say, "Oh yeah, it's one of
these where the Enterprise goes back in time
to Earth's less-than- illustrious past," or
"It's the old primitive society of simple
minded humans run by a machine that Kirk
will somehow destroy in the end, leaving the
people free to grow intellectually and take
control of their own destinies."

The latter example is one of my favorites.
It is interesting to observe that in these
episodes, the primitive society in question is
inevitably strangely akin to some society of
Earth's past that, through strict observance
of some dogmatic code, seems to behave
much the same as if controlled by a machine
of some sort.
Puritans or Quakers, aboriginal peoples
and ancient pagan societies: These are the
historical cousins of the "Star Trek
societies.
Notice also that the related historical
prototypes span human history, from il
literate aboriginals worshipping celestial
bodies to pagan empires akin to the Egyp
tians, Greeks and Romans — minus the vast
intellectual achievements of these societies:
The "Star Trek" versions are paralyzed by
the machines they worship, stuck in a per
petual Dark Ages where the god-machine
dictates and/or becomes absolute truth.
The moral of these "Star Trek" episodes
(Oh yes, "Star Trek" is nothing if not
moralistic) is clear. Men should control their
own destinies and should fight the forces that
would reduce mankind to mindless cogs in
machines gone out of control. Most viewers
in the enlightened 1960s (and '80s) would
agree with this. But "Star Trek" is not
revered by its fans because its message is

generally accepted, but rather because the
viewer knows, or at least suspects, that there
is something beyond the easy answers pre
sented before the closing, "Beam us up,
Scotty."
In the "Star Trek" archetype, we always
learn that in eons past some benevolent
leaders built the god-machine in order to con
tinue forever the order and prosperity that ac
companied their reign. These leaders, in their
well-intentioned hubris, thought they had dis
covered a grand sceme for societal organiza
tion that was perfect and thus should con
tinue unchanged for all time.
The hidden message underlying these
"Star Trek" episodes does not concern the
technology itself. Technology is simply a
device, used to amplify the conditions that
exist in society today and in societies at all
levels of technological advancement.
These "Star Trek" episodes deal not with
the power of the machine, but rather with the
power of the idea and with the threat of a
dogma or ideology run out of control until it
becomes not the means to an end (human
prosperity, justice, order and ultimately
happiness) but an end in itselt.
Thus, the machine in the "Star Trek ar
chetype becomes a metaphor for the control
of human affairs: a monolithic socio-political
system and ideology.
Plato wrote that once laws had been
"perfected" they should be made fixed and
immutable. The men of the Crusades sought
to forge a world of Christian love and mercy
through the power of the sword. Marx and
Lenin envisioned the culmination of
socialism as a world run according to the
lofty ideals of communism. Hitler strove for a
pure and efficient society of Aryan fascist
ideologues.
While the motives of these and other
"utopianists" of our own and past ages were
not always insidious, even the best of these,
like the "benevolent" machines in "Star
Trek," were terribly flawed and terribly dan
gerous. The seductive promise of a Utopia
that will stand immune to erosion is inex
orably wed to the threat of a stifling and
restrictive dis-utopia from which it will be im
possible to escape.
The minions of utopianism always have an
answer when rhetoric and reality seem to
clash. When the "perfect" social system is
plagued by imperfection, ideology dictates
reality. Difficulties arise because we have not

adhered closely enough to rigid prescriptions:
Communism will not really work until the
whole world is communist; religious
believers who suffer have fallen from the
pure. "Star Trek's" Utopias suffered internal
crises because of the disruptive influence of
the Enterprise and its crew. It is thus neces
sary for these societies to adhere all the more
closely to the dogmatic straight and narrow to
regain Utopia. In this way dis-utopia is self
perpetuating.
Recall that the dis-utopias of "Star Trek"
are akin to earthly dis-utopias from many his
torical periods. In each case one Utopian
dogma substitutes for another. Indeed, it may
seem as if only our own modern society is
free of utopianism. We consider ourselves
pragmatic realists. Hut as in the societies of
fiction and of history, ideology masquerades
as reality in our world as well, and thus, as in
the dis-utopias of "Star Trek," we are un
aware of the machine that directs our own ac
tions.
Adam Smith describes the true capitalist
economy as an efficiently run machine, and
economic theory asserts that the system of
market forces will and should determine our
behavior. In this way the pure capitalist eco
nomy creates a Utopia in which every
resource is "automatically" put to the most
efficient use, and thus maximum utility
(happiness?) is realized.
In the Reaganomic Utopia of unbridled
capitalism, periods of hardship and increas
ingly large and deep "pockets of poverty"
are the fault of human interference with the
economic machine. And on Monday, Oct. 19,
1987, what seemed to be the culmination of
short-sighted greed and mismanagement
became a warning from the economic god
machine through its oracle at Wall Street.
The priests of the almighty dollar are trotted
out to tell us what we should have known all
along: We have strayed from the straight and
narrow path of laissez-faire capitalism. We
must return to and stay the course we have
begun, pursuing the maximization of private
capital, which is the proper end of all humnan
endeavors.
Once this is done, Utopian prosperity for all
will come through the eternal wisdom of the
forces of the marketplace machine. It's com
forting to know we're all in good hands.

The quintessential cult television show
"Star Trek," like all good serials, had a few
constantly recurring themes that devotees
could readily identify in each episode, almost
from the opening credits.
Not five minutes of the show would elapse
before one could say, "Oh yeah, it's one of
these where the Enterprise goes back in time
to Earth's less-than- illustrious past," or
"It's the old primitive society of simple
minded humans run by a machine that Kirk
will somehow destroy in the end, leaving the
people free to grow intellectually and take
control of their own destinies."

The latter example is one of my favorites.
It is interesting to observe that in these
episodes, the primitive society in question is
inevitably strangely akin to some society of
Earth's past that, through strict observance
of some dogmatic code, seems to behave
much the same as if controlled by a machine
of some sort.
Puritans or Quakers, aboriginal peoples
and ancient pagan societies: These are the
historical cousins of the "Star Trek
societies.
Notice also that the related historical
prototypes span human history, from il
literate aboriginals worshipping celestial
bodies to pagan empires akin to the Egyp
tians, Greeks and Romans — minus the vast
intellectual achievements of these societies:
The "Star Trek" versions are paralyzed by
the machines they worship, stuck in a per
petual Dark Ages where the god-machine
dictates and/or becomes absolute truth.
The moral of these "Star Trek" episodes
(Oh yes, "Star Trek" is nothing if not
moralistic) is clear. Men should control their
own destinies and should fight the forces that
would reduce mankind to mindless cogs in
machines gone out of control. Most viewers
in the enlightened 1960s (and '80s) would
agree with this. But "Star Trek" is not
revered by its fans because its message is

generally accepted, but rather because the
viewer knows, or at least suspects, that there
is something beyond the easy answers pre
sented before the closing, "Beam us up,
Scotty."
In the "Star Trek" archetype, we always
learn that in eons past some benevolent
leaders built the god-machine in order to con
tinue forever the order and prosperity that ac
companied their reign. These leaders, in their
well-intentioned hubris, thought they had dis
covered a grand sceme for societal organiza
tion that was perfect and thus should con
tinue unchanged for all time.
The hidden message underlying these
"Star Trek" episodes does not concern the
technology itself. Technology is simply a
device, used to amplify the conditions that
exist in society today and in societies at all
levels of technological advancement.
These "Star Trek" episodes deal not with
the power of the machine, but rather with the
power of the idea and with the threat of a
dogma or ideology run out of control until it
becomes not the means to an end (human
prosperity, justice, order and ultimately
happiness) but an end in itselt.
Thus, the machine in the "Star Trek ar
chetype becomes a metaphor for the control
of human affairs: a monolithic socio-political
system and ideology.
Plato wrote that once laws had been
"perfected" they should be made fixed and
immutable. The men of the Crusades sought
to forge a world of Christian love and mercy
through the power of the sword. Marx and
Lenin envisioned the culmination of
socialism as a world run according to the
lofty ideals of communism. Hitler strove for a
pure and efficient society of Aryan fascist
ideologues.
While the motives of these and other
"utopianists" of our own and past ages were
not always insidious, even the best of these,
like the "benevolent" machines in "Star
Trek," were terribly flawed and terribly dan
gerous. The seductive promise of a Utopia
that will stand immune to erosion is inex
orably wed to the threat of a stifling and
restrictive dis-utopia from which it will be im
possible to escape.
The minions of utopianism always have an
answer when rhetoric and reality seem to
clash. When the "perfect" social system is
plagued by imperfection, ideology dictates
reality. Difficulties arise because we have not

adhered closely enough to rigid prescriptions:
Communism will not really work until the
whole world is communist; religious
believers who suffer have fallen from the
pure. "Star Trek's" Utopias suffered internal
crises because of the disruptive influence of
the Enterprise and its crew. It is thus neces
sary for these societies to adhere all the more
closely to the dogmatic straight and narrow to
regain Utopia. In this way dis-utopia is self
perpetuating.
Recall that the dis-utopias of "Star Trek"
are akin to earthly dis-utopias from many his
torical periods. In each case one Utopian
dogma substitutes for another. Indeed, it may
seem as if only our own modern society is
free of utopianism. We consider ourselves
pragmatic realists. Hut as in the societies of
fiction and of history, ideology masquerades
as reality in our world as well, and thus, as in
the dis-utopias of "Star Trek," we are un
aware of the machine that directs our own ac
tions.
Adam Smith describes the true capitalist
economy as an efficiently run machine, and
economic theory asserts that the system of
market forces will and should determine our
behavior. In this way the pure capitalist eco
nomy creates a Utopia in which every
resource is "automatically" put to the most
efficient use, and thus maximum utility
(happiness?) is realized.
In the Reaganomic Utopia of unbridled
capitalism, periods of hardship and increas
ingly large and deep "pockets of poverty"
are the fault of human interference with the
economic machine. And on Monday, Oct. 19,
1987, what seemed to be the culmination of
short-sighted greed and mismanagement
became a warning from the economic god
machine through its oracle at Wall Street.
The priests of the almighty dollar are trotted
out to tell us what we should have known all
along: We have strayed from the straight and
narrow path of laissez-faire capitalism. We
must return to and stay the course we have
begun, pursuing the maximization of private
capital, which is the proper end of all humnan
endeavors.
Once this is done, Utopian prosperity for all
will come through the eternal wisdom of the
forces of the marketplace machine. It's com
forting to know we're all in good hands.
