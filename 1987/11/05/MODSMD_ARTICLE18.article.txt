Religion pacifies
with pat answers
to hard problems
Roy Campbell's long harangue
about "godless" secular human
ism and communism in last
Thursday's Daily struck me as
quite amazing. Campbell seems
to think that someone (probably
the Founding Fathers) declared
Christianity the state religion of
America and that all
"nonbelievers" should go home,
probably to their communist
homeland.
He advocates, among other
things, prayer (presumably only
Christian) in the schools. I
assume he would dismiss the
First Amendment and recent Su
preme Court decisions on the
subject as motivated by the "Evil
One." Campbell does not limit
his attacks to freedom of religion.
Neither does he believe in other
human rights, asserting that
"God gives lis no rights at all."
In his view, people are like do
mestic pets whose sole purpose
is to love their master. Perhaps
Campbell thinks this good. I, for
one, do not.
Campbell then spends some
time attacking secular human
ism, comparing it to "godless"
communism. Both, he says, wish
the destruction of religion, so
they must be the work of the
"Evil One." Has he considered
that organized religion and the
"Evil One" may just be a hoax to
rob the unsuspecting? The Rus
sian totalitarians (whom
Campbell mislabels as commu
nists) wish to destroy religion in
order to do the robbery them
selves.

Campbell s view of the world
provides easy answers to today's
problems. By saying they are the
work of the "Kvil One." he frees
himself from the need to think.

Editorial wrong
to blame Reagan
Your Oct. 28 editorial titled
"Reassessing Reagan" is quaint.
Reagan and the entire execu
tive branch seem to be at fault for
the entire economic crisis. That
the legislative branch "will not
bow unquestioningly to his
demands" has been the case with
all presidents. But what you tend
to ignore is the fact that the presi
dent shouldn't "bow unquestion
ingly" any more than they do.
Congress has been adept at add
ing pork-barrel spending amend
ments to everything.
Reagan wants his expenditures
and not theirs. They want theirs
and not his. So everyone has
compromised and added most of
both. The bloated debt is as
much, if not more, a congres
sional problem as it is a presiden
tial one. Both sides are to blame,
and both must correct the prob
lem.
Reagan does have his large
problems, and the rest of your
opinion discussed some of them.
But to blame economic problems
on the executive branch either is
naive, or it is sophisticated in a
way that shows a strong political
bias and a good disregard of
reality.
