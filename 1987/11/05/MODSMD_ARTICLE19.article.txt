## Hoover cannot hide political mission 
### 
Donald Kennedy recently assured the
Stanford community that charges regarding
the Hoover Institution's political bias are
based on "allusions" to the writings of a few
unrepresentative Hoover scholars, that a fac
ulty committee cleared Hoover of such alle
gations and that only a "very, very small
minority" of Stanford faculty or the commu
nity thinks Hoover has a political mission
(Daily, Nov. 2).

Manley and Rebholz

Persons in power commonly try to dismiss
their opposition as insignificant, but so much
evidence of Hoover's political activities has
been presented that no one at Stanford
should be fooled by Kennedy's remarks. The
Hoover Institution is a problem for Stanford,
and will remain so until some Stanford presi
dent shows respect for the facts and shuts
down Hoover's political activities.
In truth, no one knows how many Stanford
people think Hoover has a political mission
because no one has ever asked this question
of the Stanford community. Kennedy is enti
tled to his opinion, but a survey of commu
nity attitudes toward Hoover— perhaps
funded by the President's Office— would he
a useful addition to public discussion. Until
such a study is made, claims that only a few

Stanford people think Hoover has a political
mission should be seen as an effort to squelch
the issue, not discuss it factually.
Contrary to Kennedy's remarks, the
evidence behind Hoover's political activities
has never been based on "allusions" to the
work of individual Hoover scholars. This
evidence, most of which comes from
Hoover's own materials, shows that Hoover
helps supply ideas to political candidates, as
sists candidates in campaigns, helps winning
candidates enact programs and carries on ex
tensive efforts to influence public opinion
through the institution's op-ed program.
Hoover alternately takes pride in these po
litical activities and tries to convince us that it
is not political. As part of this effort, the
Stanford community is told Hoover plays up
its conservative reputation to raise money,
and we are then asked to believe that Hoover
is really less conservative than people think.
If the latter is true, conservative Hoover
donors should be apprised forthwith that they
are throwing their money away on a
"nonpolitical, ' ideologically balanced insti
tution.
The faculty committee Kennedy cites
found a great deal of evidence for Hoover's
political activities: It simply did not let the
evidence affect its judgment that Hoover
does not have an institutional ideological bias
(Campus Report, June 5, 1985, p. 20.).
To reach this conclusion, the Dornbusch

committee had to minimize Herbert Hoover's
1959 declaration that the institution's mission
was "by its research and publications to dem
onstrate the evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx . . . and to reaffirm the validity of the
American system." The committee reported
that Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell
rejects such an "extreme" view, but conflict
ing reports suggest that Campbell sees noth
ing wrong with the statement.
The Dornbusch committee also received a
great deal of evidence documenting Hoover's
political activities from Hoover's annual
reports, but it did not consider this evidence
germane to the technical question of institu
tional ideological bias. No explanation was
offered as to where members of the Stanford
community could legitimately get evidence of
Hoover's political activities or bias if not
from the reports.
There is a reason why the Hoover Institu
tion is controversial at Stanford. No univer
sity can tolerate within its midst a highly au
tonomous, politically active think tank,
whether that think tank espouses the values
of Adam Smith or Karl Marx. As long as the
Stanford community allows Hoover to be
Hoover, the University permits its name to
assist partisan political causes at substantial
risk to our reputation for objectivity and inde
pendence.

Hoover's own materials, shows that Hoover
helps supply ideas to political candidates, as
sists candidates in campaigns, helps winning
candidates enact programs and carries on ex
tensive efforts to influence public opinion
through the institution's op-ed program.
Hoover alternately takes pride in these po
litical activities and tries to convince us that it
is not political. As part of this effort, the
Stanford community is told Hoover plays up
its conservative reputation to raise money,
and we are then asked to believe that Hoover
is really less conservative than people think.
If the latter is true, conservative Hoover
donors should be apprised forthwith that they
are throwing their money away on a
"nonpolitical, ' ideologically balanced insti
tution.
The faculty committee Kennedy cites
found a great deal of evidence for Hoover's
political activities: It simply did not let the
evidence affect its judgment that Hoover
does not have an institutional ideological bias
(Campus Report, June 5, 1985, p. 20.).
To reach this conclusion, the Dornbusch

committee had to minimize Herbert Hoover's
1959 declaration that the institution's mission
was "by its research and publications to dem
onstrate the evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx . . . and to reaffirm the validity of the
American system." The committee reported
that Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell
rejects such an "extreme" view, but conflict
ing reports suggest that Campbell sees noth
ing wrong with the statement.
The Dornbusch committee also received a
great deal of evidence documenting Hoover's
political activities from Hoover's annual
reports, but it did not consider this evidence
germane to the technical question of institu
tional ideological bias. No explanation was
offered as to where members of the Stanford
community could legitimately get evidence of
Hoover's political activities or bias if not
from the reports.
There is a reason why the Hoover Institu
tion is controversial at Stanford. No univer
sity can tolerate within its midst a highly au
tonomous, politically active think tank,
whether that think tank espouses the values
of Adam Smith or Karl Marx. As long as the
Stanford community allows Hoover to be
Hoover, the University permits its name to
assist partisan political causes at substantial
risk to our reputation for objectivity and inde
pendence.
