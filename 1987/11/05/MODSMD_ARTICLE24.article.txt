## Disc jockey mixes rap and academics Student looks to music and more 
### Monica Simms 
At a recent party on campus,
Kevin Montague stood in the
corner of the room, leaning over
a dimly lit table covered with au
dio equipment and surrounded
by record albums.
He looked down at the two
turntables in front of him as
though they were the pit of an or
chestra and he were the conduc
tor. Moving his hand in two
sharp back-and-forth motions as
though he were conducting an or
chestra, he mixed the music on
the turntables with perfect
timing.
The crowd continued to dance
like an audience expecting the
next movement, yet unaware
that the smooth segue had al
ready been completed.
Montague is indeed a smooth
disc jockey. A senior in English
and the leader of a rap group
called Members Only, he has
worked as a DJ at parties on the
Stanford campus and all over the
Bay Area for the past several
years.
He is also something of an
anomaly because, to him, "rap"
is more than just a funky form of
black dance music; it is as much
a form of art as the baroque and
classical piano styles he has
played since he was 12.
"People treat rap like it's not a
legitimate art form." he said
recently at the Coffee House.
Leaning on the back legs of his
chair, he winced slightly and his
brow furrowed as he continued,
"If art is an expression of some
one's creativity, and rap is an ex
pression of someone's creativity,
now can you say rap is not art? '
"People who think rap is not

musically legitimate don't sit
down and listen to the lyrics. I
don't have much patience for
those kinds of people," he
added.
Born and raised in what he
calls a "roughneck" neighbor
hood of New York, Montague
looks the part of the inner-city
rapper. He wears wide laced Ad
didas sneakers, straight-legged
Lee jeans, a brown leather jacket
and possesses the tall, thin
physique of a basketball player.
But Montague differs from the
stereotypical rapper almost to
the point of irony.
He attended the Bronx High
School of Science, one of the
most prestigious and competitive
high schools in the country. With
the backing of a strong record at
that school he came to Stanford,
where he has continued to
develop his interests in rap, as
well as in creative writing,
chemistry and French poetry.
"He's a very nice young man.
You never feel threatened by him
in any way," said Electrical En
gineering Professor Clayton
Bates. Bates taught a writing
intensive engineering course last
spring for which Kevin was a
teaching assistant.
"He's a gentle person, not ag
gressive like you might expect a
New Yorker. I'm a New Yorker,
and 1 can come on very strong.
But not Kevin. Kevin is a very
easygoing, approachable kind of
person," Bates said.
Bruce Richardson, a close
friend and another member of
Members Only, said, "1 didn't
really like him when I first met
him. He seemed so distant. But
