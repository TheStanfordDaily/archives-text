# College adopts new drug tests
## 
### Kimberly Loffer 
While Stanford athletes and
the University battle it out
with the NCAA over its con
troversial drug-testing policy,
Central Florida Community
College in Ocala, Fla., has
started a new policy of requir
ing non-athletes to take drug
tests.
Cheerleaders, music stu
dents, members of theater and
dance troupes, as well as any
other student performing in
the public eye, may now be re
quired by the college to test
for drug use along with ath
letes.
Explaining the new policy,
Dean of Student Development
Bud Gilligan said, "Society is
crying out. We are trying to
prevent a problem by raising
the level of awareness about
drugs as a social illness."
The program, which has not
yet been put into effect, would
randomly test 5 percent of the
performing students. Those
students would be chosen by a
computer and then be given a
urine test, administered by
Gilligan and the coach or fac
ulty sponsor of the activity the
student is involved in.
If the test for drug use is
positive, the student will be
suspended from his or her ac
tivity for 14 days, during
which time a counselor will be
assigned to dissuade the stu
dent from further drug use.
After working with the
counselor the student may

return lo his or her activity, al
though drug tests will again he
administered to guard against
continued drug use. If the tests
come back positive a second
time the student will be
suspended from his or her ac
tivity indefinitely.
While Florida's decision
may affect some universities'
decisions whether or not to in
itiate drug-testing program, of
ficials at Stanford and other in
stitutions generally oppose an
expansion of drug testing on
college campuses.
James Lyons, dean of Stu
dent Affairs at Stanford, said
he disagrees with Gilligan's
policy. "[Drug testing! isn't
educational because it is such
a stupid way to teach. Testing
is ultimately an act of distrust
|and| an invasion of privacy,"
he said.
Tom Butters, athletic direc
tor at Duke University, an
other school whose athletes
have challenged the ethics of
drug testing, also said he
disagreed with the principle
behind the Florida college's
new policy. "I'm interested in
my athletes making good deci
sions to refrain from using
drugs for a lifetime, not just
for four years."
Andy Geiger, athletic direc
tor at Stanford, echoed this
opinion. "Part of the value of
an education is learning the
difference between what is
right and wrong. Drug testing
is like proctoring an exam. I be
lieve in the Honor Code. That is
why I take the stand J do."
Lyons said he believes one of
the problems with the Florida
college's policy is that it unfairly
singles out certain students. As a
result, he said, "the institution is
more interested in appearances
than in reality."
Duke, like Stanford, professes
to encourage students to be re
sponsible about drug use, but
does not police their behavior.
"Firstly," Butters said, "we are
dealing with adults, not children.
A vast number of students do not
have a drug problem. We don't
want them to feel suspect by
giving them drug tests. . . . We
feel that we are helping them
make good decisions," he said.
Geiger emphasized that educa
tion, rather than enforcement, is
also the focus of Stanford's
policy. "We are very respectful

of a student's intelligence," he
said.
However, if the University has
reason to believe that a student
has a problem with drugs, Lyons
said, Stanford will intervene, and
the student may be assigned a
counselor. "But, it would never
occur to us to use drug tests,"
Lyons said, adding that "it's a
lousy way to do business."
Martha Kegel, associate direc
tor of the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) in
Northern California, said she
believes that Central Florida
Community College's new policy
violates students' constitutional
rights. "The courts have held
that drug testing is a search (that)
must follow the Fourth Amend
ment," which details restrictions
on searches, she said.
Kegel added that the humilia
tion of being forced to urinate in
the presence of another person is
the "worst kind of privacy viola
tion."
She added that the most dis
agreeable part of the drug testing
is that "it treats people as guilty
until proven innocent."

NCAA officials, however,
have staunchly defended drug
testing as a means to deter sub
stance abuse. Frank Uryas, di
rector of sports sciences for the
NCAA, said "the NCAA feels
strongly about the need for drug
education and a drug-testing pro
gram. . . . We are willing to enter
into litigation to support it."
Students and athletes are not
alone in being required to un
dergo testing; many institutions
nationally have adopted drug
testing as a means to deter sub
stance abuse .
Employees of the Rapid Tran
sit District in Los Angeles, for
example, are required to take
drug tests and a physical every
two years.
After any accident in which
there is over $1000 in damage or
in which an injury occurs, the
driver will be tested. Al Rice, as
sistant director of personnel for
the Rapid Transit District (RTD),
said that an employee who tests
positive for drugs will be given a
hearing and due process. He
added that any punishment
"depends on the drug."
