# College adopts new drug tests

### Kimberly Loffer 
While Stanford athletes and
the University battle it out
with the NCAA over its con
troversial drug-testing policy,
Central Florida Community
College in Ocala, Fla., has
started a new policy of requir
ing non-athletes to take drug
tests.
Cheerleaders, music stu
dents, members of theater and
dance troupes, as well as any
other student performing in
the public eye, may now be re
quired by the college to test
for drug use along with ath
letes.
Explaining the new policy,
Dean of Student Development
Bud Gilligan said, "Society is
crying out. We are trying to
prevent a problem by raising
the level of awareness about
drugs as a social illness."
The program, which has not
yet been put into effect, would
randomly test 5 percent of the
performing students. Those
students would be chosen by a
computer and then be given a
urine test, administered by
Gilligan and the coach or fac
ulty sponsor of the activity the
student is involved in.
If the test for drug use is
positive, the student will be
suspended from his or her ac
tivity for 14 days, during
which time a counselor will be
assigned to dissuade the stu
dent from further drug use.
After working with the
counselor the student may

return lo his or her activity, al
though drug tests will again he
administered to guard against
continued drug use. If the tests
come back positive a second
time the student will be
suspended from his or her ac
tivity indefinitely.
While Florida's decision
may affect some universities'
decisions whether or not to in
itiate drug-testing program, of
ficials at Stanford and other in
stitutions generally oppose an
expansion of drug testing on
college campuses.
James Lyons, dean of Stu
dent Affairs at Stanford, said
he disagrees with Gilligan's
policy. "[Drug testing! isn't
educational because it is such
a stupid way to teach. Testing
is ultimately an act of distrust
|and| an invasion of privacy,"
he said.
Tom Butters, athletic direc
tor at Duke University, an
other school whose athletes
have challenged the ethics of
drug testing, also said he
disagreed with the principle
behind the Florida college's
new policy. "I'm interested in
my athletes making good deci
sions to refrain from using
drugs for a lifetime, not just
for four years."
Andy Geiger, athletic direc
tor at Stanford, echoed this
opinion. "Part of the value of
an education is learning the
difference between what is
right and wrong. Drug testing
