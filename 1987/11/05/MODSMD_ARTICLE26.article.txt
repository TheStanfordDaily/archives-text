## Beyond roses: the Bay Area's best romantic dates 
### K. Kay Devgan 
'icture yourself with your true
! \e — the man or woman of
\ our dreams.
Now picture yourself across a
table from this person, eating a
plateful of mashed'potatoes and
chicken chalupa at Stern dining
hall. Kind of spoils the picture,
doesn't it?
Some enchanted evening you
may find your true love (yes,
even at Stanford), and when you
do, it would be wise to have
some romantic things to do with
the lucky person.
There are virtually hundreds of
romantic places in the Stanford,
Palo Alto and San Francisco
areas. Given the constraints
common to college students —
lack of money, time and trans
portation — I have compiled a
list of romantic delights to suit all
incomes and dispositions.
All of the following places are
easily accessible by foot, car or
train and should provide ample
opportunity to impress and
entice the object of your affec
tions.
People complain that it is diffi
cult to find anyone interested in
romance on this campus. As true
as it may seem, all it takes is a
little initiative, a little courage
arid as senior John Johnston
says, "flowers and compli
ments' to spark someone's at
tention. Once past that hurdle all
that remains is deciding where to
go on that fateful first date.

A logical place to start is the
Stanford campus itself. With the
beautiful architecture and lively
atmosphere of the University, it
seems a perfect place to get to
know someone better.
Romantic places on campus in
clude the Dish, a satellite dish in
the Foothills just off the main
campus. The Dish is a good place
to visit on a long, moonlit walk.
Lake Lagunita, when it is
replenished by the winter rains,
is also a beautiful place to sit and
talk.
Romantic daytime endeavors
include trips to the Stanford Art
Museum and the Rodin sculpture
garden.
Creativity should play an im
portant role in your choice of av
man tic things to do. Plan some
thing that will be enjoyable to
both of you, and don't forget that
even the commonplace can be
exciting with the right person.
Mia Zamora, a sophomore in
international relations, suggests a
romantic picnic complete with
wine, fruit and soft music on the
grass in the Oval. "It doesn't
have to be a fancy thing," she
says. "Anything can be romantic
as long as you're with someone
who puts you in a romantic
mood."
Small restaurants and cafes are
also favorites with many couples.
For example, the Trattoria, an
Italian restaurant in Palo Alto,
serves up an ambiance and a
menu that are divinely inspired.
A little further away from

campus in the San Pedro Square
is a uniquely evocative little
Moroccan restaurant called El
Maghreb. Like the inside of a
genie's bottle, the walls and
ceilings are sumptiously draped
with thick velvet, the tables are
almost floor level and sur
rounded by thick pillows.
As you eat a seven-course
meal consisting of lentils, Moroc
can salads, Bastella, breaded
chicken with olives and lemon,
lamb with honey sauce, fruit,
nuts and mint tea, you are
serenaded by authentic Moroc
can music and belly dancers.
This three-hour dining experi
ence is a sure winner for a suc
cessful and impressive first date.

and at $20 per person is relatively
inexpensive for the excellent ser
vice ;uid atmosphere.
Randy Shoup, a sophomore in
political science, suggests San
Francisco as the perfect place to
take a date. Places to go in the
City range from ridiculously ex
pensive to relatively cheap, with
offerings that run from opera to
nightclubs to trolley cars and
window shopping
Possible dates in the City in
clude the San Francisco Sym
phony, directed this year by Her
bert Blomstedt. This season the
symphony will offer Bach's Suite
No. 3 in D, Barber's "Toccata
Festiva," the Sibelius Violin
Concerto, and Stravinsky's

"Symphony of Psalms."
Evenings at the theater can
also be inspiring. Some theater
groups to consider include San
Francisco's American Conser
vatory Theater, which this year
will be presenting Woody Allen's
"The Floating Light Bulb," Sam
Shepard's "A Lie of the Mind,"
Mae West's "Diamond Lil" and
Shakespeare's "King Lear."
On a lighter note, the Magic
Theater in the City is producing
plays this year under the theme
of "The Season of Love." Its
repertoire includes Eugene
O'Neill's "A Moon for the Mis
begotten," Sam Shepard's "Fool
for Love," and Wendy Mac-
Leod's "Apocalyptic But
terflies."
For those of you who prefer
the nightclub scene, the City has
one of the best. The Stone, lo
cated in North Beach, is one of
the City's top showcases for na
tional and international rock,
jazz and blues groups. Groups
such as Go West, the Pandoras
and Boys Cry Wolf have ap
peared there this past month.
The Stone's after-hours club,
Club 412, is open weekends with
dancing, videos and live artists.
Some fun and inexpensive
things to do in the City include
shopping in the Haight-Ashbury
district and eating at Fisherman's
Wharf. The Wharf is a pictur
esque tourist spot full of cozy
restaurants, tiny shops and a
beautiful view of the boats and
the bay.
An absolute must in the City is

scenic Golden Gate Park. This
beautiful park has picnicking
areas, a Japanese tea garden and
the Strybing Arboretum. It is
both relaxing and free.
Another romantic possibility is
to drive California Highway I
south to Carmel and enjoy the
quaint and beautiful town with its
bed-and-breakfast inns and
friendly people.
In nearby Monterey, you can
visit Cannery Row, the famous
fishing area immortalized by
John Steinbeck in his novel
"Cannery Row." Although fre
quented by many tourists, it is an
interesting historical area to visit
— full of shops, restaurants and
museums. The Monterey Bay
Aquarium — one of the nation's
top aquariums — is also nearby.
Perhaps one of the most ro
mantic places on earth to go is
the beach. On a moonlit night
there is nothing more special
than the sound of crashing
waves, the feel of cool sand and a
warm person.
The closest beach to campus is
the beach at San Gregorio, which
can be reached by taking Califor
nia Highway 84 west to the coast.
Interstate 280 south and Califor
nia Highway 17 west will take
you to Santa Cruz, with its beach
and boardwalk. Farther north.
Half Moon Bay is another
secluded and enticing beach.
Whatever you choose to do,
remember to do something both
of you will enjoy. After all, life's
too short not to have at least a
few enchanted evenings.
