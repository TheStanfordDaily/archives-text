## Kohlmoos waits 
### 
Mike Kohlmoos doesn't
want to go down with
Raymond McCoy and Alvin
Miller in the annals of football
history.
It the names of McCoy and
Miller don't ring a bell, don't
fret. They shouldn't. Miller
and McCoy were highly touted
prep athletes who never
reached the level of excellence
predicted for them in college.

Many people saw McCoy as
the equal of another great
Chicago schoolboy named
Isiah Thomas. The two were
considered the best prep
guards to play in Illinois in
years. While everyone knows
what happened to Thomas,
few heard about McCoy after
he went to the University of
San Francisco and never
escaped the shadow of Quintin
Dailey.
Miller, a wide receiver from
Kirkwood, Mo., was the con
sensus high school player of
the year. Scouts were dazzled
by his tremendous speed and
size. Somehow, though, they
overlooked Miller's lack of
agility and his paltry total of 17
receptions as a senior.
Notre Dame won the
recruiting derby but could
never really fit Miller into the
lineup. An injured knee ended
Miller's college career, and
now he watches his less highly
recruited classmate, Tim
Brown, chase the Heisman
Trophy.
Now Kohlmoos, a redshirt
freshman at Stanford, is trying
to live up to his clippings. Two
years ago. he was the object of
a fierce recruiting war be
tween Stanford and California.
In one of the most virulent

Bay Area recruiting battles in
recent memory, Kohlmoos
verbally committed to Cal
before changing his mind in fa
vor of Stanford.
The Cal staff was infuriated,
charging Stanford with unethi
cal recruiting, and the Cardi
nal staff was elated, leaving
Kohlmoos the center of a
firestorm of controversy.
Why was everyone so
excited?
Well. Kohlmoos was one of
those who had been tagged for
greatness. He didn't need to
leap tall buildings; he could
just pick them up and move
them. College superscout Max
Emfinger rated Kohlmoos the
No. 2 prospect in the nation.
Kohlmoos just happened to
be in the right place at the right
time. At 6-foot-5 and 250
pounds, he had the size, and
scouts were impressed by his
quick feet. What most people
ignored was the fact that
Kohlmoos' size was decep
tive. He was not 250 pounds of
solid muscle, but was instead
growing into his body.
He was not strong enough to
play college football and knew
from the beginning that he
would likely redshirt his fresh
man year. He's still building
strength and can only bench
press a relatively meager —
for an offensive lineman — 305
pounds.
Yet everyone wanted
Kohlmoos, and he now looks
back on that period with the
wisdom of a guy who got
burned but learned.
"I wouldn't make any pre
commitments," the amiable
Kohlmoos said. "Nobody
really tells you what's going
on. You're under a lot of pres
sure. They'll call you up. and
they'll say. We want to know
if you're goinu to come be
cause they (scholarships) are
going fast.' 1 basically felt I
was being pressured to go to
