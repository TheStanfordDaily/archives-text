# Archambeau anchors defense

### Cameron Macky 
Almost without exception, the
defensive linemen on a football
team spend most of their careers
as relatively anonymous players.
While the linebackers and defen
sive backs are always among the
team leaders in tackles, the "men
in the trenches," as a rule, are
generally unknown to most fans.
Of course, every rule must
have an exception.
Lester Archambeau, a junior
defensive tackle on the Stanford
football team, has made his name
well-known throughout the
Pacific 10 Conference in only his
second season of play. After sit
ting out the 1985 season as a red
shirt freshman, Archambeau has
started every game during the
last two seasons for the Cardinal,
during which he has consistently
been among the team leaders in
tackles.

"Lester will be one of the great
defensive players ever to play at
Stanford before he's through,"
according to Stanford Defensive
Coordinator Dick Mannini, who
also serves as the team's defen
sive line coach.
Archambeau. a native of
Montville, N.J., has certainly
lived up to Mannini's claim thus
far. As a high school senior he
was named First-Team All-State
on both offense and defense and
was chosen as an Honorable
Mention All-American and Aca
demic Ail-American by USA
Today.
After his senior season Ar
chambeau was given his pick of
scholarship offers, but his deci
sion to come to Stanford instead
of one of the more traditional
football powers wasn't difficult
at all.
"It's the best academic institu
tion in the country," Archam

beau said, "and it allows me to
play football, too. There's no
better combination."
Stanford "allows" Archam
beau to play football quite well.
In his first season as a starter, he
was fourth on the team in tackles
with 69, had eight quarterback
sacks to lead the team, received
All-Pac-10 Honorable Mention
honors and was the recipient of
the Palo Alto Trophy, given each
year to the team's most outstand
ing freshman.
This season he has 65 tackles
to rank fifth on the team (first
among the linemen) and also has
four sacks and five tackles for
losses to his credit. But he still
sees room for improvement.
"I'd like to be getting more of
a pass rush," he said. "My play
against the run is all right, (but) a
tackle's job isn't just to play the
run, it's to get pressure on the
quarterback, too. Against the run

I grade myself pretty well, but
against the pass I've got to get in
the backtleld a little more."
Archambeau also sees room
for improvement in the Cardi
nal s performance as a team this
season. "We've had some bad
breaks, but we re not playing up
to our potential. If we had, we'd
have a much better record.
We've had a little trouble gelling,
getting everybody to play well all
at one time. And that started to
happen for us in the the other
three games (Stanford's three
game winning streak), but then
this past Saturday (against
Arizona) we gave up the big
plays, which we hadn't done for
a little while.
"That's what killed us. You
can't have big plays."
Those big plays haven't come
on the ground. As the team heads
into Saturday's game against
USC, Archambeau will be
leading a defensive line that has
shut down the running games of
its last two opponents. Oregon
gained only 96 yards on the
ground against the Cardinal, and
a week later the Stanford defense
held Arizona's vaunted rushing
attack to only 97 yards and an
average of two yards a carry.
Archambeau doesn't think
there's a magical reason for the
line's sudden resurgence,
however.
"We're just executing better,"
he said. "We're feeling comfort
able with what we're doing, and
we're starting to do things right."
According to Archambeau, the
team's goals for the remainder of
the season are very clear-cut.
"We'd like to win all three
(games), finish out strong and
keep USC from going to the Rose
Bowl.
As for the lack of recognition
the team's linemen get. Archam
beau doesn't think it's that im
portant. "I'm not looking for a
whole bunch of glory. I'm just
out there playing because I like
it. Our defensive scheme is (set
up) so the linebackers make the
plays. If they are making the
plays, I'm doing my job."
