# Johnson eyes Seoul

### Debby Lu 
Looking at the athletic achievenu
Sheryl Johnson is enough to make even
the hardiest of Cardinal jocks feel a little
envious, if not altogether inadequate.
An athlete who competed in four sports
— basketball, field hockey, track and
softball — for all four years of her high
school career, as well as basketball, field
hockey and softball in college, Johnson is
a two-time Olympian in the sport that she
now coaches at Stanford, field hockey.
Johnson was among the select players
on the bronze medal-winning team at the
1984 Olympics, and she is now one of the
co-captains of the team that will be
representing the United States in Seoul
next summer. Add to this the fact that
Johnson is also a volleyball player and a
gymnast, and you have all the makings of
the proverbial "all-around athlete."
Yet Johnson's achievements are not
confined to athletics. Indeed, her aca
demic credentials are impressive as well.

She went to a junior college in Cupertino,
her hometown, then transferred to UC-
Berkeley on a field hockey scholarship.
After earning her bachelor's degree at
Cal, Johnson came to Stanford for a
master's degree in education.
This Stanford alumnus and Olympic
veteran has Seoul in her eyes right now.
In her Encina Hall office, where plaques
and posters cover nearly every inch of
wall space, Johnson has a poster for the
upcoming 1988 Olympics hanging directly
on her left. Right beside it is a sketch of
the bronze medal she won in 1984.
Johnson calls her 1984 Olympic experi
ence "different but better'' than what she
had anticipated. " The highlight of the '84
games for me was the opening cere
monies — waiting in the tunnel and hear
ing 90.(KK) screaming people was just so
neat, Johnson said. "Having 10.01)0
people come to our games" and "winning
the bronze in a penalty stroke shootout
