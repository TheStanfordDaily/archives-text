# Johnson eyes Seoul

### Debby Lu 
Looking at the athletic achievenu
Sheryl Johnson is enough to make even
the hardiest of Cardinal jocks feel a little
envious, if not altogether inadequate.
An athlete who competed in four sports
— basketball, field hockey, track and
softball — for all four years of her high
school career, as well as basketball, field
hockey and softball in college, Johnson is
a two-time Olympian in the sport that she
now coaches at Stanford, field hockey.
Johnson was among the select players
on the bronze medal-winning team at the
1984 Olympics, and she is now one of the
co-captains of the team that will be
representing the United States in Seoul
next summer. Add to this the fact that
Johnson is also a volleyball player and a
gymnast, and you have all the makings of
the proverbial "all-around athlete."
Yet Johnson's achievements are not
confined to athletics. Indeed, her aca
demic credentials are impressive as well.

She went to a junior college in Cupertino,
her hometown, then transferred to UC-
Berkeley on a field hockey scholarship.
After earning her bachelor's degree at
Cal, Johnson came to Stanford for a
master's degree in education.
This Stanford alumnus and Olympic
veteran has Seoul in her eyes right now.
In her Encina Hall office, where plaques
and posters cover nearly every inch of
wall space, Johnson has a poster for the
upcoming 1988 Olympics hanging directly
on her left. Right beside it is a sketch of
the bronze medal she won in 1984.
Johnson calls her 1984 Olympic experi
ence "different but better'' than what she
had anticipated. " The highlight of the '84
games for me was the opening cere
monies — waiting in the tunnel and hear
ing 90.(KK) screaming people was just so
neat, Johnson said. "Having 10.01)0
people come to our games" and "winning
the bronze in a penalty stroke shootout

after being tied against the
Australians" are also fond
memories Johnson has of the Los
Angeles Olympiad.
After hearing Sheryl Johnson
describe her many accomplish
ments in field hockey, one is
struck by the fact that she is less
interested in furthering her own
career than in advancing the
sport itself.
"I hope that the Olympic ex
perience helped show how dedi
cated the players are," Johnson
said. "California colleges keep
dropping field hockey. Most

players need places to go to com
pete after high school, and the
only option will be the East
Coast ... I feel a need to prove
that California players are good,
and I feel overlooked because the
East Coast has traditionally been
considered the field hockey
power."
Johnson's desire to further the
sport helped spur her decision to
make the transition from player
to coach. After the 1980 boycott
of the summer Olympics, she
began coaching at her high
school alma mater. More coach
ing opportunities soon became
available when Johnson reached
senior member status on the na
tional field hockey team; her new
position enabled her to coach its

lower-division players. She
began her Stanford coaching
career first as an assistant coach
and became head coach three
years ago.
Johnson's efforts to bring field
hockey to a level of
"respectability" have not gone
unnoticed by her players. Junior
Alison Smith said of her coach,
"Her dedication is amazing. On
days when you're not having a
good practice and you feel that
you can't do (well) for yourself,
you'll do it for her." Fellow
junior Dana Fleming echoed
Smith's sentiments: "(Johnson
is] basically a martyr for hockey.
She's kept hockey alive on the
West Coast."
Although Johnson may have

aspirations of making the West
Coast a new field hockey power
house, her main concern is to
keep the Cardinal team on its up
ward climb in the national
rankings. Johnson coordinates
everything from training to sel
ling T-shirts.
"Coaching can easily take up
the whole day, and there's al
ways something to do to make
things better,' Johnson said.
Noelle Mitchell, an assistant
coach in the Stanford program
for six seasons, said this about
her head coach: "I've played
with her and against her. I've
coached with and against her.
Believe me, I'd prefer to be on
her team. Sheryl may be the best
player in the United States."
