# W. Culture plan set for easy passage
## CUS favors HSU amendment 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
Proposed changes to the University s Western
Culture program — including the Black Student
Union's recently added amendment — will
"probably pass" at the next meeting of the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies, CUS Chair Craig
Heller said yesterday.
The CUS reviewed the amended proposal in a
meeting yesterday and returned it for "a few slight
changes" to the Task Force on the Area One Re
quirement, Heller said. The task force, which
drafted the proposed changes over the summer,
added the BSU amendment earlier this week.
The BSU amendment asks for more geographic
diversity in the Western Culture curriculum and for
more ethnic minority lecturers in the program. It
was introduced to the CUS at a forum on Western
Culture the committee held last week.
The CUS, which will meet again in two weeks,
also asked that a clause to incorporate imaginative
literature in the curriculum be added, that the time
frame of the program be clarified to include study
of ancient cultures and that the task force recom
mendations be better formatted. Heller said.
The CUS yesterday also recommended reword
ing one statement in the BSU amendment that re
quests proportional representation of ethnic
minority faculty in the Western Culture tracks.
Task force member Fernando de Necochea, as
sistant provost, said the task force is close to a final
proposal and will meet "very soon" to make minor
changes.
Once passed by the CUS, the legislation must
meet the approval of the Faculty Senate.
Heller said the CUS is urging that the legislation
be placed on the senate's Jan. 21 agenda.
Although the BSU amendment
requests that the task force rec
ommendation he finalized by the
CUS in time for the senate's Dec.
3 meeting, the senate's agenda is
already full for that date. Heller
said.
CUS Board member Alette
Hauswald agreed the legislation
will meet the approval of the
CUS "with some modification."
