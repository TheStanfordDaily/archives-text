# Southern Cal band takes a beating
## 
### 
Let the orgiastic condemnation
of the USC Trojan football pro
gram continue ....
Yesterday on these pages the
suburban Susan Slusser outlined
some of the reasons why Stan
ford fans are not altogether fond
of those Southern Cal football
studs.

Yes, they are studs, and that's
probably the main reason why
we hate them. For over 20 years
they've been rolling to Rose
Bowls and Heismans. Last year
they fired Head Coach led Toll

ner because he had had several 7-
4 seasons. Think about that.
Since 1960, the Cardinal is 3-
23-1 against the Trojans. Two of
the Stanford victories came in
1970 and 1971 when Jim
Plunkett, Don Bunce and the
"thunderchicken" defense in
habited Stanford Stadium. In the
1980s, the Cardinal has lost
seven straight to the Trojans, and
the closest contest was the 20-11
loss in 1984.
That is a rather frustrating
litany of losing.
What makes matters worse is
the manner in which USC dis
mantles Stanford. When Stan
ford Coach Jack El way's offense
gets the ball inside an opponent's
10-yard line the rushing starts.
When the Trojans get the ball
they run it — no matter where

Over the pas! few seasons, I SC's band has drawn the ire of C ardinal
fans with it's mock rendition of the Stanford Rand's infamous scrambles
between formations.


Chris
Fialko
they are.
Student body right, student
body left, student body up the
middle. This is no fun to watch.
But it must be even less enjoy
able to defend. The Myth of
Sysiphus meets football — the
Cardinal defense can push the
Trojans back on first down and
maybe second down, but they'll
be coming back again on third
down.
Life sucks.
And so does the USC march
ing band. In fact, that's the
juicier reason why we detest the

Trojans — their band is so
bloody repulsive.
How many times do they play
that same fanfare every game.
Over and over and over again.
Why do they play just that song?
The standard joke is that they
can't learn any others. The new
theory developed by the Hoover
Institution, however, is that the
Trojan fanfare is a ritualistic
mating melody for future conser
vatives that works most effec
tively when repeated eternally
and which is only peripherally
related to the game at hand.
Eiven the USC fans act like
robots. They pump their victory
signs every time the Trojan band
starts up the fanfare, which must
lead to some weary arms.
