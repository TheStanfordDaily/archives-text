## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
The kidnappers who plucked Oski,
UC-Berkeley's burly mascot, from the
student union there last year "seem to
be getting desperate," according to
Axe Committee Chair Tom Smegal.
The Axe Committee and several stu
dent organizations yesterday received
two photographs of Oski the Bear from
the group that claims to be holding him.
The group, which calls itself the
"Friends of Oski," also issued a shor
tened list of demands it says must be
met before Oski is returned.
One of the photographs, received

yesterday by The Daily, The Daily
Californian, the Stanford Axe Commit
tee and the UC Rally Committee,
shows Oski standing upright, no longer
sporting the Stanford T-shirt he was
wearing in a photocopied photo the
group released when it first announced
its existence last month.
The other is a picture of the identify
ing plaque that is attached to the bear,
whose home is in a glass case at the
Berkeley student union.
Smegal, ajunior, said, "Now that we
have the actual pictures, I'm sure it's
real, as are members of I Berkeley's]
Rally Committee."
In the shortened list of demands for

the return of Oski, "Eriends of Oski"
now ask only that University President
Donald Kenned>, Berkeley Chancellor
Ira Michael Heyman and 3(MH) Cal stu
dents sign a statement promising not to
press charges against the kidnappers.
The group says that Heyman must
announce his intent to sign the pledge
by Nov. 1 1 and that the rest of the
demands must be met by Nov. 18 —
three days before Big Game.
"The 'bear-nappers' seem to be get
ting desperate," Smegal said. "They
seem to want to do something by Big
Game."

and the UC Rally Committee.
Rally Committee Chair Wendy
Withers said in a statement
issued yesterday that the
demands will not he met and that
it is "ijuite unreasonable for you
(the kidnappers) to assume the
two most prominent officials of
UC-Berkeley and Stanford
would condone your actions."
But Withers reiterated her
promise that no charges will be
filed if the bear is returned
"promptly and in good condi

Withers also telephoned
Robert Hamrdla, Kennedy's as

would sign the pledge. Hamrdla
said he would not.

sign the pledge.
