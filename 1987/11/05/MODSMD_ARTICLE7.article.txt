## Coalition condemns Bohemian Club 'ties' 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
I he University should dissolve any ties
it has with San Francisco's exclusive
Bohemian Club because the organization
treats its union workers unfairly, a coali
tion of union leaders and student groups
said here yesterday.
"There appears to be an official tie be
tween the club and Stanford," said Rafael
Espinoza, vice president of the Service
Employees International Union Local 2,
the union involved in a dispute with the
club. He made his remarks at a press con
ference yesterday morning at El Centro
Chicano.
Bohemian Club officials and campus
club members, however, dismissed the
claims made by the groups as inaccurate.

And Jim Carter, secretary of I ocal 2, said
in a telephone interview after the press
conference that speculation about the rela
tionship was a matter of "intuition.
Nevertheless, representatives of the
United Stanford Workers, the ASSU Sen
ate and MEChA called for the University
to make public any connection it has with
the club.
The University should "clarify its rela
tion to the Bohemian Club. USW Presi
dent David Stephens said. ASSU Senator
Stacey Ley ton called for an investigation
into any possible link between the Univer
sity and the club and said she has authored
a bill condemning the club and demanding
that Stanford disassociate itself from the
organization.
