# Charges mistreatment of labor
## Coalition condemns Bohemian Club 'ties' 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
I he University should dissolve any ties
it has with San Francisco's exclusive
Bohemian Club because the organization
treats its union workers unfairly, a coali
tion of union leaders and student groups
said here yesterday.
"There appears to be an official tie be
tween the club and Stanford," said Rafael
Espinoza, vice president of the Service
Employees International Union Local 2,
the union involved in a dispute with the
club. He made his remarks at a press con
ference yesterday morning at El Centro
Chicano.
Bohemian Club officials and campus
club members, however, dismissed the
claims made by the groups as inaccurate.

And Jim Carter, secretary of I ocal 2, said
in a telephone interview after the press
conference that speculation about the rela
tionship was a matter of "intuition.
Nevertheless, representatives of the
United Stanford Workers, the ASSU Sen
ate and MEChA called for the University
to make public any connection it has with
the club.
The University should "clarify its rela
tion to the Bohemian Club. USW Presi
dent David Stephens said. ASSU Senator
Stacey Ley ton called for an investigation
into any possible link between the Univer
sity and the club and said she has authored
a bill condemning the club and demanding
that Stanford disassociate itself from the
organization.
The Bohemian Club is all-male
and its membership draws from
the nation's social and economi
cal elite. According to Local 2's
press secretary Tim Reagan, club
members include President
Reagan, Vice President George
Bush, Secretary of State George
Shultz, William Buckley Jr. and
top executives from 40 of the 50
biggest corporations in the
United States.
According to the union, 19
people affiliated with Stanford
are members of the club. Union
officials released the names of
seven: Holt Ashley, professor of
aeronautics and astronautics;
Robert Freelen, University vice
president for Public Affairs; Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger; Ar
jay Miller, dean emeritus of the
Graduate School of Business;
Business Prof. William Miller;
William Shockley, professor
emeritus of electrical engineer
ing; and Richard Staar, director

of the international studies pro
gram at the Hoover Institution.
Bohemian Club bylaws allow
"members of the faculty of the
University of California and
Stanford University who reside
within 100 miles of San Francisco
and who devote a major portion
of their time to such universties"
to be elected to the club, accord
ing to a union press release.
Union officials were joined by
Leyton in citing the bylaws as
evidence of a link between the
club and Stanford.
Club member Ashley said that
the club merely seeks to increase
the number of competent and
knowledgable members in the
club."The exchange of informa
tion is one of the most delightful
aspects of the club,"he said.
Biology Prof. Dow Woodward
said that he and some of his col
leagues were interested in un
covering potential economic ties
between Stanford and the
Bohemian Club. "Since member
ship in the club is an expensive
operation, we are interested in fi
nancial subsidies of faculty mem
ber's dues."
