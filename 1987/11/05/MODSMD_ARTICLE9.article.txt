Shultz, Dole clash over new treaty
WASHINGTON — A bitter disagreement about the pending
U.S.-Soviet arms treaty is erupting between administration offi
cials and congressional Republicans as the White House
prepares for next month's summit conference with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
The dispute was reflected in an angry White House confronta
tion Tuesday between Secretary of State George Shultz and
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, (R-Kan.) over the medium
range missile treaty, which is viewed by the administration as a
badly needed foreign policy triumph.
Shultz and others have been pressing congressional
Republicans to openly embrace the pact and rally support for its
confirmation. But some Republicans, wary of a backlash from
hard-line conservative opponents, have been reluctant to do so
until its details are known.
Tempers reached such a pitch Tuesday at a meeting of Reagan
and Shultz with GOP congressional leaders that Republican
Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska had to step in and calm Dole and
Shultz, who were arguing heatedly in front of President Reagan,
sources said yesterday.
The dispute in the White House Cabinet Room illustrates
what a sensitive issue the anticipated weapons-reduction accord
is for Republicans, even though its chances for ratification are
considered to be good. The agreement is expected to be signed
at the Reagan-Gorbachev summit meeting, which is scheduled
to begin Dec. 7.
Ginsburg hearings face delay
WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee's Dem
ocratic and Republican leaders met yesterday and rejected a
White House suggestion that the panel begin hearings on Su
preme Court nominee Douglas Ginsburg before the American
Bar Association completes its investigation of his background.
At the same time — underscoring the uneasiness many con
servatives appear to have about the nomination — two leading
anti-abortion figures in Congress have begun quietly circulating
a statement reassuring conservative interest group leaders that
Ginsburg's wife, Dr. Hallee Morgan, "personally objects to
abortions." Morgan, an obstetrician who is not now practicing,
performed three abortions during her medical training and then
stopped doing so, according to administration officials.
Wnite House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had called on the
committee Monday to begin its hearings on Ginsburg before the
ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary issues its
recommendation on the nomination. He called again Tuesday
for quick hearings, suggesting that opponents of the nomination
were attempting to delay proceedings and were hampering the
high court, which has been short one justice since Lewis Powell
Jr. retired June 26.
Feds to reprimand GSL defaulters
WASHINGTON — The Department of Education, trying to
control the soaring number of defaults on student loans, threat
ened sanctions yesterday against institutions with high default
rates.
Any college, university or other post-secondary school with a
default rate exceeding 20 percent in the Guaranteed Student
Loan Program by 1990 could be expelled from that program and
all other federal student aid programs under the new rules.
The announcement by Education Secretary William Bennett
drew immediate criticism from trade schools, which account for
most of the institutions listed with high default rates. However,
a department official said between 600 and 1,000 two- and four
year academic institutions also exceed the 20 percent rate.
About a third of the 7,295 institutions in the loan program now
have 20 percent default rates, and the department said another
500 schools have default rates above 50 percent.
Officials said the loan defaults will cost the government $1.6
billion in fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1 — almost half of the
program's entire cost. That figure represents a 200 percent in
crease since 1983, when the figure stood at $531 million, the offi
cials said.
Gore, wife singing a different tune
WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) and his wife Tipper told top
entertainment-industry executives in a private, peacemaking
session in Los Angeles last week that the controversial hearings
on rock-music lyrics in which they participated were "a
mistake" that "sent the wrong message."
The entertainment industry, which generally denounced the
congressional hearings in 1985 as an attempt to censor music,
plays a significant role in Democratic presidential politics, par
ticularly fund raising, but a spokeswoman for the Gore cam
paign said the session was an attempt to "clear the air" and not
an attempt to tap into the industry's money-raising ability or
contribution coffers.
Television producer Norman Lear, songwriter and former
Eagles member Don Henley and MCA music entertainment
head Irvin Azloff hosted the private meeting. Daily Variety, a
Hollywood entertainment newspaper, published a detailed ac
count Tuesday of the two-hour luncheon that was headlined:
"Gores Polishing Showbiz."
Tipper Gore, who along with Susan Baker, the wife of Trea
sury Secretary James Baker, and other Washington women,
founded the Arlington, Va.-based Parents Music Resource Cen
ter in 1985 as part of an effort to champion proposals to put
warning labels on record album covers if "explicit" song lyrics
are included.
Market sturdy, Dow down slightly
NEW YORK — Stocks again demonstrated a measure of
stability yesterday, declining only modestly in the face of a fall
ing dollar and substantial selloffs in earlier trading on Asian and
European exchanges.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell nearly 51 points
on Tuesday after five consecutive gains, gave up another 18.24
points and closed at 1945.29. New York Stock Exchange
volume was 202.53 million shares, compared to Tuesday's
227.84 million shares.
"The market turned in a rather thick-skinned performance,
considering what was happening elsewhere in the world," said
Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney
Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
Also exerting a downward tug on the market were continued
worries that U.S. officials may not agree on further deficit re
duction steps and concerns that the West Germans will not
lower interest rates to ease pressure on the dollar.
Wall Street trading did get a boost in the late morning from
news that major British banks were lowering their base lending
rates one-half percentage point to 9 percent. But analysts waited
for signs that the Germans may follow suit, a move that would
be considered more important for U.S. markets.

Bar Association completes its investigation of his background.
At the same time — underscoring the uneasiness many con
servatives appear to have about the nomination — two leading
anti-abortion figures in Congress have begun quietly circulating
a statement reassuring conservative interest group leaders that
Ginsburg's wife, Dr. Hallee Morgan, "personally objects to
abortions." Morgan, an obstetrician who is not now practicing,
performed three abortions during her medical training and then
stopped doing so, according to administration officials.
Wnite House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had called on the
committee Monday to begin its hearings on Ginsburg before the
ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary issues its
recommendation on the nomination. He called again Tuesday
for quick hearings, suggesting that opponents of the nomination
were attempting to delay proceedings and were hampering the
high court, which has been short one justice since Lewis Powell
Jr. retired June 26.
Feds to reprimand GSL defaulters
WASHINGTON — The Department of Education, trying to
control the soaring number of defaults on student loans, threat
ened sanctions yesterday against institutions with high default
rates.
Any college, university or other post-secondary school with a
default rate exceeding 20 percent in the Guaranteed Student
Loan Program by 1990 could be expelled from that program and
all other federal student aid programs under the new rules.
The announcement by Education Secretary William Bennett
drew immediate criticism from trade schools, which account for
most of the institutions listed with high default rates. However,
a department official said between 600 and 1,000 two- and four
year academic institutions also exceed the 20 percent rate.
About a third of the 7,295 institutions in the loan program now
have 20 percent default rates, and the department said another
500 schools have default rates above 50 percent.
Officials said the loan defaults will cost the government $1.6
billion in fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1 — almost half of the
program's entire cost. That figure represents a 200 percent in
crease since 1983, when the figure stood at $531 million, the offi
cials said.
Gore, wife singing a different tune
WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) and his wife Tipper told top
entertainment-industry executives in a private, peacemaking
session in Los Angeles last week that the controversial hearings
on rock-music lyrics in which they participated were "a
mistake" that "sent the wrong message."
The entertainment industry, which generally denounced the
congressional hearings in 1985 as an attempt to censor music,
plays a significant role in Democratic presidential politics, par
ticularly fund raising, but a spokeswoman for the Gore cam
paign said the session was an attempt to "clear the air" and not
an attempt to tap into the industry's money-raising ability or
contribution coffers.
Television producer Norman Lear, songwriter and former
Eagles member Don Henley and MCA music entertainment
head Irvin Azloff hosted the private meeting. Daily Variety, a
Hollywood entertainment newspaper, published a detailed ac
count Tuesday of the two-hour luncheon that was headlined:
"Gores Polishing Showbiz."
Tipper Gore, who along with Susan Baker, the wife of Trea
sury Secretary James Baker, and other Washington women,
founded the Arlington, Va.-based Parents Music Resource Cen
ter in 1985 as part of an effort to champion proposals to put
warning labels on record album covers if "explicit" song lyrics
are included.
Market sturdy, Dow down slightly
NEW YORK — Stocks again demonstrated a measure of
stability yesterday, declining only modestly in the face of a fall
ing dollar and substantial selloffs in earlier trading on Asian and
European exchanges.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell nearly 51 points
on Tuesday after five consecutive gains, gave up another 18.24
points and closed at 1945.29. New York Stock Exchange
volume was 202.53 million shares, compared to Tuesday's
227.84 million shares.
"The market turned in a rather thick-skinned performance,
considering what was happening elsewhere in the world," said
Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney
Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
Also exerting a downward tug on the market were continued
worries that U.S. officials may not agree on further deficit re
duction steps and concerns that the West Germans will not
lower interest rates to ease pressure on the dollar.
Wall Street trading did get a boost in the late morning from
news that major British banks were lowering their base lending
rates one-half percentage point to 9 percent. But analysts waited
for signs that the Germans may follow suit, a move that would
be considered more important for U.S. markets.

Shultz, Dole clash over new treaty
WASHINGTON — A bitter disagreement about the pending
U.S.-Soviet arms treaty is erupting between administration offi
cials and congressional Republicans as the White House
prepares for next month's summit conference with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
The dispute was reflected in an angry White House confronta
tion Tuesday between Secretary of State George Shultz and
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, (R-Kan.) over the medium
range missile treaty, which is viewed by the administration as a
badly needed foreign policy triumph.
Shultz and others have been pressing congressional
Republicans to openly embrace the pact and rally support for its
confirmation. But some Republicans, wary of a backlash from
hard-line conservative opponents, have been reluctant to do so
until its details are known.
Tempers reached such a pitch Tuesday at a meeting of Reagan
and Shultz with GOP congressional leaders that Republican
Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska had to step in and calm Dole and
Shultz, who were arguing heatedly in front of President Reagan,
sources said yesterday.
The dispute in the White House Cabinet Room illustrates
what a sensitive issue the anticipated weapons-reduction accord
is for Republicans, even though its chances for ratification are
considered to be good. The agreement is expected to be signed
at the Reagan-Gorbachev summit meeting, which is scheduled
to begin Dec. 7.
