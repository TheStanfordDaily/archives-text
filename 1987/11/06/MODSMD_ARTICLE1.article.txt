# Dorms receive asbestos letter
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
The University this week circulated to all student
residences several versions of a letter outlining spe
cific asbestos levels for each building.
This move is the latest step in an ongoing effort
to survey every campus building for the presence
of asbestos.
Each of the several buildings that are part of the
three-to-four year effort was "surveyed separately
and has a different configuration of asbestos," said
Director of Housing and Food Service Keith Guy,
who drafted the letter.
The survey is expected to be finished in six to 18
months.
Guy added that buildings completed after 1976,
such as Governor's Corner and Storey House,
have no asbestos at all.
"The older buildings, mechanical buildings and
those with insulation around the pipes are more of a
problem," he said. "We wanted to say something
specific about each one."
The letters come in response to recent student
concern over asbestos levels, the letter said. The
University removed asbestos in Lagunita Court at
the outset of fall quarter when construction threat
ened to expose asbestos there. Guy's office has
since declined to release reports detailing the Uni
versity's asbestos removal priorities.
Guy listed in the letter the three stages of the
project: identification of the location of asbestos on
campus and assessment of its condition, air sam
pling and abatement and control of asbestos
"where necessary."
According to Alain Decleve, director of Univer
sity Health and Safety, only about 1(H) to 150 of the
over 4(H) buildings on campus have been surveyed
so far.
"All buildings will eventually be surveyed, and it
will take three to four years," Decleve said. "The
first 17 buildings surveyed were already known to
have friable asbestos. The percentage of the build
ings having asbestos will drop as we go because we
are prioritizing the survey by region and dates
built."
According to the letter, asbestos used in insula
tion, plaster and pipe lagging is friable and
"capable of releasing fibers upon minor disturb
ance. These friable materials constitute the most
important source of asbestos contamination in
structures."
