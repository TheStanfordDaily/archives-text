# Sandinistas, contras will meet
## 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — In an unex
pected move, President Daniel Ortega of
Nicaragua announced that his government
will hold indirect cease-fire negotiations with
U.S.-backed guerrillas to comply with a
Central American peace plan that formally
went into effect yesterday.
Ortega told a rally of Sandinista supporters
that his government also will immediately
pardon 1000 political prisoners accused of
aiding the rebels, known as contras.
But Ortega said he will not give amnesty to
the rest of the accused contras or lift a
wartime state of emergency throughout the
country until the United States and Honduras
cease aiding the guerrillas.
"We are taking concrete steps to arrange a
cease-fire," Ortega said. "We will do this
through an intermediary." He did not name
the mediator or a date for the talks.
He made the nationally televised an

nouncement hours after returning from a trip
to the Soviet Union, where he attended
ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of
the Russian Revolution. Last Friday, before
leaving on his trip, Ortega repeated his gov
ernment's longstanding position that, since it
considers the contras a proxy army of the
United States, it would not talk to them di
rectly or indirectly.
Sandinista radio and television had urged
Nicaraguans to attend the rally, and govern
ment workers were given the afternoon off.
Most public transportation was used to ferry
people to the plaza for a show of the strength
of the revolutionary government.
The peace plan does not specifically re
quire the Sandinistas to hold talks with the
contras, but Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias, the plan's author, has said that is the
only way to break an impasse in the peace
process.

Arias, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for
writing the plan, has been pressuring the San
dinistas to hold cease-fire talks and has urged
the Sandinistas to use Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo, the Roman Catholic
primate of Nicaragua, as the mediator.
Before Ortega's speech, Arias said in
Costa Rica: "I strongly believe that the es
sence and clue to all of this is reaching a
negotiated cease-fire in Nicaragua. ... If
[Ortegaj takes the first step, the contras will
have to go as refugees to Miami or California
or Costa Rica."
In his address, Ortega emphasized that the
dialogue would be over a cease-fire and not
over power-sharing.
"We must not confuse this with political
dialogue," he said. "We have never held a
political dialogue with the contras. We are
not doing that now, nor will we ever do it."
