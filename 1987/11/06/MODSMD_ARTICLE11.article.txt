## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Under
pressure from Congress, Presi
dent Reagan agreed yesterday to
become personally involved in
talks to cut the federal budget
deficit.
Reagan will meet today with
Republican congressional leaders
to discuss tax and spending is
sues before they resume the
Capitol Hill budget summit with
Democrats. Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who
had appealed Wednesday for the

president's participation, hailed
Reagan's decision. "Not a single
member on either side wants to
give up" the search for a budget
agreement, he said on the Senate
floor.
Dole's call for renewed efforts
was joined minutes later by the
majority leader. Sen. Robert
Byrd (D-W.Va.), who said: "We
must not fail. 1 have good reason
to believe a potentially good,
strong meaningful agreement is
there."

Dole's announcement that
Reagan will discuss the budget
gave new impetus to the negotia
tions, which had become
severely bogged down. Demo
crats charged that the administra
tion officials participating in the
meetings had refused to fairly
consider raising taxes to help
defray the deficit.
Democrats insist that taxes
should supply $12 billion of $23
billion in cuts needed to avoid au
tomatic across-the-board reduc

tions later this month through the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduc
tion law and they have demanded
a definite sign that the president
was willing to compromise.
The budget negotiators spent
yesterday reviewing a plan by
Sen. I'ete Domenici (R-N.M.) to
limit cost-of-living increases for
recipients of government checks.
Such programs include Social Se
curity and civilian and military
pensions.
