I he University's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement yesterday launched
a year-long re-evaluation of Stanford's grading
system that will focus on faculty concerns about
the pass/no credit option.
The committee re-evaluates the grading sys
tem roughly every three years. No changes have
been made since 1975.
I his year "there is sentiment" among faculty
members for changing the pass/no credit option,
according to Committee Chair David Wellbery,
associate professor of German and comparative
literature. However, he said, the committee has
"no opinion" on that issue as yet.
Wellbery said that a major change in the
grading system, such as reinstating the failing
grade or requiring students to fulfill distribution
requirements with courses taken for a grade,
would occur only if the committee finds "strong

evidence" that the current system is not working
well.
Other aspects of the grading system that the
committee will consider include grade inflation,
distribution of grades overall, the credibility ot
Stanford grades at other institutions, how pro
fessors grade and whether students are ade
quately motivated by the existing system.
Junior Michael I ran, a member of the commit
tee, said that faculty members on the committee
are sympathetic to student concerns. Iran said
that neither he nor Wellbery had formulated
plans for soliciting input from the student body
at large. He added that the committee might em
ploy a statistician to help evaluate grade data.
The University's policy of allowing failing
grades to disappear from student transcripts was
begun in 1971 following a substantial "change in
philosophy" toward providing a "record of ac
complishment" and not of students' failures,
Wellbery said.
