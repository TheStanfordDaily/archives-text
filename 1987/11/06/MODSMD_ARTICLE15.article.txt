# Stanford would escape student aid cuts
## Loan default rate low here

Stanford will not be hurt by
Secretary of Education William
Bennett's new proposal to cut
back federal financial aid to insti
tutions that have a large percen
tage of student defaulters on
Guaranteed Student Loans, a
Department of Education official
said yesterday.
Victoria Tripp, a press secre
tary in the U.S. Office of Post-
Secondary Education, said Stan
ford "is obviously doing a good
job of keeping down defaults."
The department's most recent
figures show Stanford had a 3.4
percent default rate in fiscal
1985.
Bennett proposed Wednesday
to reduce or eliminate federal
student aid beginning in Decem
ber, 199() at schools where more
than 20 percent of students re
ceiving Guaranteed Student
Loans default on those loans.
The proposal has stirred con
troversy in the Bay Area, with
area college officials expressing
concern that such a move would
unfairly penalize future students
for the defaults of past students.

There is also concern that remov
ing financial aid for schools with
a high default rate would deny an
education to students who could
not otherwise afford it.
The Bay Area schools in
greatest danger of losing federal
funds are primarily private trade
schools and community colleges,
Tripp said. Other four-year insti
tutions, such as UC-Berkeley,
would not be penalized, because,
like Stanford, they are able to
retain low default rates.
Tripp defended Bennett's pro
posal. "Our intent is not to point
the finger at any particular
group. ... It is to ask the institu
tions to share in the responsibil
ity" for repayment of
Guaranteed Student Loans, he
said.
Tripp said the department
believes loan defaults are not a
result of low income status, but
rather of poor advising and
recruiting programs at smaller
colleges. "I could give you
identical schools that service the
same clientele" where default
rates are much lower, Tripp said.
Roberta Johnson, assistant di
rector of Financial Aids for Stan

ford, called the plan "very con
troversial."
"There are sectors of commu
nity colleges and proprietory
schools that feel they would be
adversely affected' by the pro
posal, she said.
Johnson added, however, that
"something has to be done about
institutions carrying default
rates."
Johnson also cautioned against
focusing on penalizing institu
tions, saying there has to be a
process of "identifying factors
beyond just having institutional
fault rates."
She said she advocated "edu
cational, up-front, preventative"
measures to let students know of
their responsibilities as bor
rowers. Johnson also said her of
fice is developing a brochure on
loans to educate students about
borrowing.
Above all, Johnson said, com
munication and the establish
ment of a "positive relationship"
between lenders and borrowers
was necessary.
