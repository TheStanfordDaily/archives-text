It is time for the University to intervene and
ensure that Stanford has a real bookstore.
As it stands now, the medium-sized building
between the post office and the Career Planning
and Placement Center is barely a bookstore in
anything but name. It is primarily a souvenir and
clothing store that does a side trade in snacks,
books and battery-operated gadgets. Basically,
it is a pretty sorry excuse for a university
bookstore.
Over the past few years, the sale of Stanford
paraphernalia, especially clothing, has come to
dominate the downstairs area. At first glance,
the only thing that seems to distinguish it from a
gilt shop is the fact that it also sells cookies and
muffins.
More importantly, the selection of books at
the Stanford Bookstore is neither extensive nor
particularly scholarly. Most of the books being
hawked in the downstairs section fall into the
categories of Stanford memorabilia, cookbooks.

travel guides and business and professional how
to books.
Upstairs, where most of the remaining books
are sequestered, it is still difficult to find schol
arly works that are not on the required reading
lists of current classes. Even the required texts
are frequently out of stock because of
Bookstore's ordering policy that encourages
professors to order too few rather than too many
books.
One way to start improving the Bookstore
would be to add a newsstand. It is really quite
amazing that Stanford students have no access
on campus — other than Green Library's subter
ranean reading room — to a broad selection of
magazines and newspapers, including interna
tional papers. A newsstand could provide a
valuable resource for students, and the need for
one on campus is particularly acute since Stan
ford is not located in an urban or downtown
area.
