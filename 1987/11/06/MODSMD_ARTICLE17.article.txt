# Ronald Reagan can rest in peace
## 
### 
Ronald Reagan was truly a phenomenon.
I don't think anybody ever quite figured
out how he did all the things he did. Time
after lime, he somehow managed to do the
right thing or say the right words. As Tip
O'Neill said, "He would have made one hell
of a king." The Teflon President could do no
wrong. And yet. . .

And yet there were cries from the begin
ning that it was all a fantasy. One day, the
Clipper's luck would run out, and the Ameri
can people would wake up and realize that
their dream was really a nightmare. The ex
perts told us that one day we would look at
the man who made us feel so good and
wonder what went wrong.
But those were the cries of doomsayers
and killjoys. We knew about the rising deficit
and the other problems, but somehow we felt
the president would take care of it.
Democracy was in the hands of a maestro.
People stopped reading the newspaper and
started worrying about important things, like
baseball and Michael Jackson. America was
America again.
1 remember back in 1979, when everyone
was so frustrated with President Carter's ap
parent inability to deal with the Iranian
hostage crisis. I remember everyone thinking
that if only Ronald Reagan would get into the
White House, he would handle the situation.
With trumpets blazing, Reagan won the elec
tion and eventually the hearts of the Ameri
can people.
Forty-nine states to one in 1984. Politics
became somewhat of a joke. We laughed
along with Reagan as he coasted through
press conferences and signed orders for Na
tional Bible Week and the like. Democracy is
a piece of cake. Get a guy who knows what
he's doing, and let him delegate authority to
other people who know what they're doing.

What's so tough about being a superpower?
The balloon popped sometime near the end
of 198f> with the announcement of what was
to be known as the Iran-contra affair. To give
you some idea of the shock involved, I
managed to save a few interesting newspaper
articles taken from a few months earlier, one
of which describes the movement to repeal
the 22nd amendment (limiting the president
to two terms) and a movement to nominate
Reagan for Mount Rushmore. The transition
from Mount Rushmore to impeachment was
startling, to say the least.
I've never quite understood what hap
pened to Reagan in the months to come. The
master of the political comeback looked more
like Jimmy Carter in trying to deal with the
scandal. He just couldn't seem to put the
trouble behind him and make a fresh start. He
released statements to the press, followed all
the correct procedures and assured people
that he was in charge. But this time the Amer
ican people didn't follow him.
Despite all the cries of illegality and incom
petence, 1 don't think most people were upset
that money had been channeled to the con
tras, although most people agreed that
trading arms for hostages with the leader of
Iran was not the brightest policy in the world.
For most people, I think it was the fact that
Ronald Reagan had somehow betrayed them
that was most distressing. Reagan, the out
sider, had brought to the Washington es
tablishment a refreshing, down-to-earth
simplicity that the common man could iden
tify with. Now he was acting like the insider,
manipulating, avoiding, possibly lying. That
was simply unacceptable.
From that point on, the opposition grew
stronger and more confident. Now, Reagan
had to deal with Congress to move on the
budget deficit or Central American policy.
Pressure grew for arms agreements with the
bright, energetic man from the Soviet Union,
Mikhail Gorbachev. Editors and columnists
began skewering Reagan's decisions with an
audacity that would have been unthinkable
only a year earlier. The man who might run
for a third term was now a lame duck.
But there was still a flicker, however small,
left in Reagan's political candle. With the
nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme

Court, Reagan had the perfect fight. Bork
was the intellectual dynamite Reagan was
looking for to hlow up the lame duck label
and regain the prestige of his presidency.
The controversy only served to galvanize
the left. I personally don't think the White
House could have done anything to pull off
the confirmation, although everyone agreed
that the pro-Bork forces were at the very
least a little late. Bork was rejected 58-42,
and the king had been dethroned.
What followed was particularly sad to
those of us who had supported Reagan
throughout his career. Instead of merely criti
cizing the president's policies, the pundits
began to ask how America was going to
survive until the end of Reagan's term. The
New York Times sighed that at least he had
"the Bakers, James and Howard, to make ne
cessary budget compromises with Congress.
And at least he has Secretary of State Shult/
to guide him in the December summit with
Gorbachev." The problem of democracy was
now to figure out how to function without a
president. v .
The sadness came not from seeing a tax in
crease or the end of a particular policy, but
from watching Reagan himself. The Great
Communicator had not changed. We had. He
continued to approach politics the same way
he always did. We simply stopped respond
ing. We changed our view of Reagan and ex
pected something of him that he could not
provide anymore — leadership. We lost con
fidence and hope, the two essentials of the
Reagan presidency.
Historians can look back with the comfort
of hindsight and pick apart the Lebanons and
the Persian Gulfs. But they will inevitably
miss the big picture, losing the forest while
looking for the trees. People will rejoice
about the "rebuking of the Reagan revolu
tion'' and the death of conservatism for a
long time to come. Maybe. Only time will
tell. But they will have to reconcile all of the
talk with the undeniable fact that for six long
years Ronald Reagan and the American
people forged a relationship based on the
highest liberal values — idealism, respect and
hope. Ronald Reagan, rest in peace.

Forty-nine states to one in 1984. Politics
became somewhat of a joke. We laughed
along with Reagan as he coasted through
press conferences and signed orders for Na
tional Bible Week and the like. Democracy is
a piece of cake. Get a guy who knows what
he's doing, and let him delegate authority to
other people who know what they're doing.

What's so tough about being a superpower?
The balloon popped sometime near the end
of 198f> with the announcement of what was
to be known as the Iran-contra affair. To give
you some idea of the shock involved, I
managed to save a few interesting newspaper
articles taken from a few months earlier, one
of which describes the movement to repeal
the 22nd amendment (limiting the president
to two terms) and a movement to nominate
Reagan for Mount Rushmore. The transition
from Mount Rushmore to impeachment was
startling, to say the least.
I've never quite understood what hap
pened to Reagan in the months to come. The
master of the political comeback looked more
like Jimmy Carter in trying to deal with the
scandal. He just couldn't seem to put the
trouble behind him and make a fresh start. He
released statements to the press, followed all
the correct procedures and assured people
that he was in charge. But this time the Amer
ican people didn't follow him.
Despite all the cries of illegality and incom
petence, 1 don't think most people were upset
that money had been channeled to the con
tras, although most people agreed that
trading arms for hostages with the leader of
Iran was not the brightest policy in the world.
For most people, I think it was the fact that
Ronald Reagan had somehow betrayed them
that was most distressing. Reagan, the out
sider, had brought to the Washington es
tablishment a refreshing, down-to-earth
simplicity that the common man could iden
tify with. Now he was acting like the insider,
manipulating, avoiding, possibly lying. That
was simply unacceptable.
From that point on, the opposition grew
stronger and more confident. Now, Reagan
had to deal with Congress to move on the
budget deficit or Central American policy.
Pressure grew for arms agreements with the
bright, energetic man from the Soviet Union,
Mikhail Gorbachev. Editors and columnists
began skewering Reagan's decisions with an
audacity that would have been unthinkable
only a year earlier. The man who might run
for a third term was now a lame duck.
But there was still a flicker, however small,
left in Reagan's political candle. With the
nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme

Court, Reagan had the perfect fight. Bork
was the intellectual dynamite Reagan was
looking for to hlow up the lame duck label
and regain the prestige of his presidency.
The controversy only served to galvanize
the left. I personally don't think the White
House could have done anything to pull off
the confirmation, although everyone agreed
that the pro-Bork forces were at the very
least a little late. Bork was rejected 58-42,
and the king had been dethroned.
What followed was particularly sad to
those of us who had supported Reagan
throughout his career. Instead of merely criti
cizing the president's policies, the pundits
began to ask how America was going to
survive until the end of Reagan's term. The
New York Times sighed that at least he had
"the Bakers, James and Howard, to make ne
cessary budget compromises with Congress.
And at least he has Secretary of State Shult/
to guide him in the December summit with
Gorbachev." The problem of democracy was
now to figure out how to function without a
president. v .
The sadness came not from seeing a tax in
crease or the end of a particular policy, but
from watching Reagan himself. The Great
Communicator had not changed. We had. He
continued to approach politics the same way
he always did. We simply stopped respond
ing. We changed our view of Reagan and ex
pected something of him that he could not
provide anymore — leadership. We lost con
fidence and hope, the two essentials of the
Reagan presidency.
Historians can look back with the comfort
of hindsight and pick apart the Lebanons and
the Persian Gulfs. But they will inevitably
miss the big picture, losing the forest while
looking for the trees. People will rejoice
about the "rebuking of the Reagan revolu
tion'' and the death of conservatism for a
long time to come. Maybe. Only time will
tell. But they will have to reconcile all of the
talk with the undeniable fact that for six long
years Ronald Reagan and the American
people forged a relationship based on the
highest liberal values — idealism, respect and
hope. Ronald Reagan, rest in peace.

Ronald Reagan was truly a phenomenon.
I don't think anybody ever quite figured
out how he did all the things he did. Time
after lime, he somehow managed to do the
right thing or say the right words. As Tip
O'Neill said, "He would have made one hell
of a king." The Teflon President could do no
wrong. And yet. . .

And yet there were cries from the begin
ning that it was all a fantasy. One day, the
Clipper's luck would run out, and the Ameri
can people would wake up and realize that
their dream was really a nightmare. The ex
perts told us that one day we would look at
the man who made us feel so good and
wonder what went wrong.
But those were the cries of doomsayers
and killjoys. We knew about the rising deficit
and the other problems, but somehow we felt
the president would take care of it.
Democracy was in the hands of a maestro.
People stopped reading the newspaper and
started worrying about important things, like
baseball and Michael Jackson. America was
America again.
1 remember back in 1979, when everyone
was so frustrated with President Carter's ap
parent inability to deal with the Iranian
hostage crisis. I remember everyone thinking
that if only Ronald Reagan would get into the
White House, he would handle the situation.
With trumpets blazing, Reagan won the elec
tion and eventually the hearts of the Ameri
can people.
