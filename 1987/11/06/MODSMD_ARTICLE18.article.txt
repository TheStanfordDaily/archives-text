## Stanford should cut ties with club 
### 
The Bohemian Club of San
Francisco is one of those organi
zations whose name is exactly
the opposite of its reality.
l ounded a century ago by a
group of writers and artists (Jack
London, Mark Twain and
Ambrose Bierce were among its
members), the club admitted a
few businessmen to help pay the
bills.

Within a few years, the busi
ness types had taken over, and
now it is regarded as the most ex
clusive men's club in the
country, if not the world. It is
also notorious for its sexist
practices in refusing to admit or
even hire women, and for its
practices with regard to labor and
people of color.
It has recently been brought to
our attention that Stanford en
joys special privileges and
heretofore unknown ties with
this exclusive club. The club sets
aside 20 spots each for Stanford
and UC-Berkeley faculty and ad
ministrators. Thus, a coalition of
Stanford faculty, workers and
students has come together to
question the special relationship
between Stanford and this dis

criminatory club.
The Bohemian Club's mem
bership roster includes execu
tives from most of the nation's
largest corporations, banks and
insurance companies. President
Reagan is a member, as are Vice
President Bush, Cabinet secre
taries Weinberger, Shultz and
Baker and such notables as
Henry Kissinger, William F.
Buckley and Merv Griffin. There
are also 21 members from the
Stanford faculty and administra
tion.
The Bohemian Club has been
in the news lately on many
fronts, most of them involving
charges of discrimination. The
club is all male and has but a few
black, Hispanic and Asian mem
bers. A seven-year lawsuit was
settled last month when the U.S.
Supreme Court refused to hear
an appeal by the Bohemians.
Qualified women cannot be dis
criminated against in employ
ment, according to California
law, and the Bohemians now
have to allow women to work at
their retreat.
On a parallel front, the
Bohemian Club has taken a hard
line in negotiating a new contract
with the union that represents the
workers at the club's two
facilities, Local 2 of the Hotel
Etmployees and Restaurant

The Bohemian Club
has been in the
news lately on many
fronts, most of them
involving charges of
discrimination.

Employees Union. The club,
unable to win a victory for dis
crimination in the courts, is now
trying to win at the negotiating
table. According to the union,
the only proposals they have
received from the club include
getting rid of seniority protection
for workers and replacing that
with the contractual right to dis
criminate in employment policies
according to management whim
— like punishing pro-union and
other people they don't like. And
we know what kind of people
Bohemians don't like.
What is troubling is Stanford's
connection to all this. Normally
for people to become members of
the club, they must pay an $K.M)()
initiation fee and substantial
monthly dues; this is in addition
to a waiting list that is years long.
Yet the Stanford members are

exempt from this wait and pos
sibly exempt from such expen
sive fees. Does Stanford want to
have such.a relationship with a
club that only offers such
privileges to certain members of
the Stanford faculty, namely
white males?
Moreover, the Bohemian Club
offers these spots to Stanford and
UC-Berkeley in order to be able
to claim ties with these institu
tions and improve its image.
Does Stanford want to be a part
of building up the image of such a
discriminatory institution?
Other questions remain. Is the
Stanford administration, particu
larly President Kennedy, aware
of this relationship? Has Stan
ford given its approval to the ar
rangement? Does Stanford par
ticipate in the determination of
which faculty members will be
offered positions? Does Stanford
subsidize the membership fees?
And most importantly, is it the
role of an institution like Stan
ford to maintain special ties with
an exclusive, secretive discrimi
natory club? Is this what we
stand for? These are some pretty
fundamental questions about the
role that Stanford plays in the
rest of society, and we hope
answers will be forthcoming.

Employees Union. The club,
unable to win a victory for dis
crimination in the courts, is now
trying to win at the negotiating
table. According to the union,
the only proposals they have
received from the club include
getting rid of seniority protection
for workers and replacing that
with the contractual right to dis
criminate in employment policies
according to management whim
— like punishing pro-union and
other people they don't like. And
we know what kind of people
Bohemians don't like.
What is troubling is Stanford's
connection to all this. Normally
for people to become members of
the club, they must pay an $K.M)()
initiation fee and substantial
monthly dues; this is in addition
to a waiting list that is years long.
Yet the Stanford members are

exempt from this wait and pos
sibly exempt from such expen
sive fees. Does Stanford want to
have such.a relationship with a
club that only offers such
privileges to certain members of
the Stanford faculty, namely
white males?
Moreover, the Bohemian Club
offers these spots to Stanford and
UC-Berkeley in order to be able
to claim ties with these institu
tions and improve its image.
Does Stanford want to be a part
of building up the image of such a
discriminatory institution?
Other questions remain. Is the
Stanford administration, particu
larly President Kennedy, aware
of this relationship? Has Stan
ford given its approval to the ar
rangement? Does Stanford par
ticipate in the determination of
which faculty members will be
offered positions? Does Stanford
subsidize the membership fees?
And most importantly, is it the
role of an institution like Stan
ford to maintain special ties with
an exclusive, secretive discrimi
natory club? Is this what we
stand for? These are some pretty
fundamental questions about the
role that Stanford plays in the
rest of society, and we hope
answers will be forthcoming.

The Bohemian Club of San
Francisco is one of those organi
zations whose name is exactly
the opposite of its reality.
l ounded a century ago by a
group of writers and artists (Jack
London, Mark Twain and
Ambrose Bierce were among its
members), the club admitted a
few businessmen to help pay the
bills.

Within a few years, the busi
ness types had taken over, and
now it is regarded as the most ex
clusive men's club in the
country, if not the world. It is
also notorious for its sexist
practices in refusing to admit or
even hire women, and for its
practices with regard to labor and
people of color.
It has recently been brought to
our attention that Stanford en
joys special privileges and
heretofore unknown ties with
this exclusive club. The club sets
aside 20 spots each for Stanford
and UC-Berkeley faculty and ad
ministrators. Thus, a coalition of
Stanford faculty, workers and
students has come together to
question the special relationship
between Stanford and this dis

criminatory club.
The Bohemian Club's mem
bership roster includes execu
tives from most of the nation's
largest corporations, banks and
insurance companies. President
Reagan is a member, as are Vice
President Bush, Cabinet secre
taries Weinberger, Shultz and
Baker and such notables as
Henry Kissinger, William F.
Buckley and Merv Griffin. There
are also 21 members from the
Stanford faculty and administra
tion.
