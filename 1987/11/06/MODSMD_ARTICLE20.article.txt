Gorbachev should
not be honored
Gorbachev was selected as one
of the 10 student choices for a
graduation speaker. The logic of
this choice eludes me. At my
graduation 1 would like a speaker
that evokes my respect and ad
miration. Hundreds of thousands
of Soviet Jews have expressed
their desire to emigrate from the
Soviet Union. Gorbachev, for all
his talk, has permitted only a few
Soviet Jews to leave. Gorbachev
talks about pulling Soviet troops
out of Afghanistan, but until this
time has not followed through
with concrete actions. Perhaps
major change is slowly coming to
the Soviet Union. For now,
however, Gorbachev is the
leader of a repressive regime and
-should not be honored as a
speaker at my Stanford gradua
tion.

Idea of humanism
purely subjective
In response to the viewpoint
"Theocracy is real threat" (Nov.
3), does the author realize that a
belief in God does not necessar
ily abolish man's free will?
The author's humanism is
based purely on subjective ideol
ogy, therefore it can only con
form to his ego and to nobody
else's. It is true that humanism
stresses the power and the poten
tial of the individual, but if it does
not know of any limits, then it
could end up as the real threat. A
personal belief in prophetic laws
eliminates such a threat, since
the laws function not to create
philosophical chaos, like vain
humanism does, but rather to

stop man from abusing his intel
lect. The author was utterly le
thargic when he said that "the
lessons of Christianity could be
as perverted as Islam." Heaven
knows that only dirty politics,
and not real faith, can cause per
version of any kind.
It is farcical that the author, in
ending his argument, quoted Pas
cal's negative criticism of the
transcending nature of radical
religiosity. I wonder why the au
thor did not exploit his free will
as to reveal also Pascal's intelli
gent defense of Christianity, or
has he read Pascal in its entirety?
The author should have carefully
checked his sources before send
ing in such a sophomoric piece.

Upon reading the "tentative"
plans for replacing the traditional
Big Game Rally with "Cardinal
and White Night," 1 was ap
palled by this blatant display of
racism.
While I'm sure the organizers
had no intention of offending
others, surely people of color
must find this a noxious term to
coin. Lest we forget, the impor
tance of an action of this type lies
not with the intent, but with the
effect. This episode is particu
larly odious in light of the widely
publicized debate on institutional
racism directed at colored
people. Granted it would be
strictly paranoic to contend that
our school colors "Cardinal and
White" contribute slanted rac
ism, but it is obvious their combi
nation with "Night" to form the
phrase "Cardinal and White
Night" was an unfortunate af
front.
