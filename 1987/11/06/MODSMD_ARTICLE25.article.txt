## Campus bands are starting to make some noise 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
Has the lack of good rock
bands at Stanford this year got
you down? Well, don't despair;
live music is slowly coming out
of the campus woodwork.
Soon the Fugitive Guys won't
be the only live band playing on a
given weekend. Most of the
bands are sticking to the cover
format, playing songs that have
been written by others, but
several have attempted to create
a distinctive sound all their own.
Without question, the Fugitive
Guys have been the most visible
group on campus this fall, kick
ing off the year by playing at
Freshman Orientation. As one of
the few returning bands from last
year, the group had the edge on
bands that lost members to grad
uation last June. They have al
ready played five parties this
year.
Members of the Fugitive Guys
said they are working to develop
more original music and are in
the process of making a demo
tape of their original tunes, which
lead singer Casey Corum de
scribed as reggae-and-blues
influenced rock.
"We really want to get some
radio play," Corum said. "This
year we're getting a lot more
excited about our music. We
sound a hell of a lot better than
we did last year."
Merv Spiegel and the Penguins
is another band that writes its
own music,and they also recently

made a demo tape. The tape is
now available at Tower Records,
where 20 copies were sold in the
first week. They played their first
party of the year Oct. 24 at the
American Studies House.
Members of Merv and the Pen
guins said they have ambitions
beyond playing for Stanford par
ties. "We're pretty serious about
it," said drummer Mike Heller,
who graduated last year, adding
that the band is "trying to get
gigs at clubs."
"We choose our music accord
ing to what we want to play, not
because we think it's what the
people will like," said senior
Peter Adamy, bass player for the
group and also the drum major
for the Stanford Band.
Many people have compared
the band's sound to that of the
popular group R.E.M., a remark
the band is not completely happy
with. "We like to think we have
our own style, [which] I would
describe as post-punk," Heller
said.
Despite comparisons to main
stream pop artists. Heller said
the covers they play are rather
atypical. For example, some of
the songs played at the American
Studies House party were
'Goobers and Raisinets' and the
theme song for The Jeffersons.'
"There's a lack of really
serious musicians here. It would
be nice to have some original
bands, some bands doing some
thing. . . . Maybe Stanford is not
a particularly conducive place for
bands," Heller said.

Sophomore Bob Burlinson,
lead guitarist and vocalist for the
Fugitive Guys, agreed. "You
can't help but feel guilty to major
in music here. Stanford places
such heavy emphasis on aca
demics," Burlinson said.
He also explained that it is dif
ficult to get gigs off campus.
"There's not a lot of opportuni
ties in Palo Alto. It isn't a

Berkeley," he said.
Another prominent group on
campus is Gotham City. Though
the band has played only a few
parties so far, they will become
very visible in November, as
they have four shows scheduled.
The members of Gotham City,
all of whom have graduated ex
cept for their new lead singer,
have at least seven years of rock

band experience. The band itself,
however, has only been together
for about a year.
Marsh McCall, who graduated
in 19K6, explained that his band
plays mostly covers, but is
working on some "raw-edged,
musically interesting" originals.
"We are not trying to sound
polished," he said, describing
the band's style as "carefully

sloppy."
McCall said he believes his
band has an edge on the rest be
cause "our experience has given
us a boost."
The Electric Monks, a newly
formed band, will also appear in
November, playing their first
show at Tresidder Union. This

band also contends they offer an
alternative sound.
We play contemporary music
— good, danceable stuff, with
some funk mixed in," said junior
Mark Anderson, the band's
drummer.
The Electric Monks are
playing cover tunes for now, but
hope to do some of their own
music later. "You can satisfy
most people more with covers,
but the discriminating listener ap
preciates a band's own stuff,"
Anderson said.
Stanford can expect several
other bands to appear as the year
progresses.
The Pitt Bulls, made up mostly
of sophomores, played their first
party two weeks ago at Grove
Mayfield. The band, which
played some talent shows at
Branner last year, plays mostly
early '70s music.
Unlike some of the bands that
have been around for awhile, the
more recently formed Pitt Bulls
are "doing it more as a hobby
than as a long term goal," said
guitarist Greg Cohen. "We're
excited, though, because we got
a lot of good feedback after Fri
day's show."

Cohen added that the group is
working on developing some
original music as well.
The guitarist for the Random
Numbers, 1985 graduate Scott
Debarger, said his band will be
sticking to the cover format for
now
"There's not that big of a mar
ket for original material; people
like to dance to tunes they recog
nize," he said. "Some of the
most successful bands in the Bay
Area are cover bands playing
good, energetic music — bands
like Z.asu Pitts, Big Band Beat
and Pride and Joy.
"We d rather get to the point
where we can make a good show.
We're taking it one phase at a
time," he added.
Heller agreed that there is not
a big market for originals. "If we
just played originals, we proba
bly wouldn't get many gigs," he
said.
Freshman bands have been
rather scarce. Markus
McGroarty, a freshman, is
working on organizing a band
with other freshmen from his
dorm. He said that finding
enough practice time is difficult.
"We aren't ready to play for
people yet, but as the year
progresses, we'd like to play
some gigs." he said.
The band is tentatively called

the Lost Dog. "Think of all the
free advertising from people put
ting up signs (on telephone
poles)," he said.
Residents of Phi Psi missed
The Heptiles so much they paid
for members of the group to fly in
and play their traditional Hallo
ween concert this year.
Some of the members, who all
graduated from Stanford, are
now living on the East Coast.
They came back to be with their
old group, which endured in
several different forms for eight
years. The Heptiles were known
for old rock and rhythm and
blues.
Matt State, a student at the
Stanford Medical School, played
guitar and saxophone for The
Heptiles. He said he was
surprised that they were asked to
get back together this year. "You
just kind of expect these things to
die out eventually," he said.
Mary Glasser, a former organ
izer of the event at Phi Psi, said
the cost of reuniting the members
"wasn't really very much. . . .
It's about what you'd pay a band
regularly."
The average band on campus
charges from about $300 to $500
per night. "We never really see
much of it though," Adamy said,
explaining that most of the
money goes toward expenses.
