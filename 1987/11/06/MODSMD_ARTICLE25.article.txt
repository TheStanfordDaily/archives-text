## Campus bands are starting to make some noise 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
Has the lack of good rock
bands at Stanford this year got
you down? Well, don't despair;
live music is slowly coming out
of the campus woodwork.
Soon the Fugitive Guys won't
be the only live band playing on a
given weekend. Most of the
bands are sticking to the cover
format, playing songs that have
been written by others, but
several have attempted to create
a distinctive sound all their own.
Without question, the Fugitive
Guys have been the most visible
group on campus this fall, kick
ing off the year by playing at
Freshman Orientation. As one of
the few returning bands from last
year, the group had the edge on
bands that lost members to grad
uation last June. They have al
ready played five parties this
year.
Members of the Fugitive Guys
said they are working to develop
more original music and are in
the process of making a demo
tape of their original tunes, which
lead singer Casey Corum de
scribed as reggae-and-blues
influenced rock.
"We really want to get some
radio play," Corum said. "This
year we're getting a lot more
excited about our music. We
sound a hell of a lot better than
we did last year."
Merv Spiegel and the Penguins
is another band that writes its
own music,and they also recently

made a demo tape. The tape is
now available at Tower Records,
where 20 copies were sold in the
first week. They played their first
party of the year Oct. 24 at the
American Studies House.
Members of Merv and the Pen
guins said they have ambitions
beyond playing for Stanford par
ties. "We're pretty serious about
it," said drummer Mike Heller,
who graduated last year, adding
that the band is "trying to get
gigs at clubs."
"We choose our music accord
ing to what we want to play, not
because we think it's what the
people will like," said senior
Peter Adamy, bass player for the
group and also the drum major
for the Stanford Band.
Many people have compared
the band's sound to that of the
popular group R.E.M., a remark
the band is not completely happy
with. "We like to think we have
our own style, [which] I would
describe as post-punk," Heller
said.
Despite comparisons to main
stream pop artists. Heller said
the covers they play are rather
atypical. For example, some of
the songs played at the American
Studies House party were
'Goobers and Raisinets' and the
theme song for The Jeffersons.'
"There's a lack of really
serious musicians here. It would
be nice to have some original
bands, some bands doing some
thing. . . . Maybe Stanford is not
a particularly conducive place for
bands," Heller said.

Sophomore Bob Burlinson,
lead guitarist and vocalist for the
Fugitive Guys, agreed. "You
can't help but feel guilty to major
in music here. Stanford places
such heavy emphasis on aca
demics," Burlinson said.
He also explained that it is dif
ficult to get gigs off campus.
"There's not a lot of opportuni
ties in Palo Alto. It isn't a

Berkeley," he said.
Another prominent group on
campus is Gotham City. Though
the band has played only a few
parties so far, they will become
very visible in November, as
they have four shows scheduled.
The members of Gotham City,
all of whom have graduated ex
cept for their new lead singer,
have at least seven years of rock

band experience. The band itself,
however, has only been together
for about a year.
Marsh McCall, who graduated
in 19K6, explained that his band
plays mostly covers, but is
working on some "raw-edged,
musically interesting" originals.
"We are not trying to sound
polished," he said, describing
the band's style as "carefully

sloppy."
McCall said he believes his
band has an edge on the rest be
cause "our experience has given
us a boost."
The Electric Monks, a newly
formed band, will also appear in
November, playing their first
show at Tresidder Union. This
