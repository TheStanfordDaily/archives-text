# Bookstore prices are fair
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
Although the Stanford Bookstore operates as
its own corporation, free from any University
control, the Bookstore's textbook prices are fair
when compared to costs at other university
bookstores, according to a survey conducted by
The Daily.

'Our philosophy is that books are
essential to education and a sweat
shirt is not.'
— Eldin Speed,
Bookstore manager

While the Bookstore's texts do tend to be
priced higher than those at other university
bookstores, the Stanford Bookstore refunds
about 17 percent of textbook costs to students,
making prices substantially lower than they
seem.
In a random sample of 10 texts available at the
Stanford, UC-Berkeley, Harvard and North
western bookstores, prices were only 2 to 3 per
cent higher at Stanford than at the other three
bookstores.
A biochemistry text costing $41.95 at
Berkeley, Harvard and Northwestern costs

$42.50 at Stanford. The other bookstores charge
$39.95 for a text titled "Molecular Biology of the
Cell;'' the same book costs $40.50 at Stanford.
Stanford Bookstore Manager Eldin Speed
could not explain why any price differences
existed between the bookstores.
"Book prices are set by publishers and should
be the same everywhere," according to Speed.
But bookstores set their own percentages on
textbook rebates, and the Stanford Bookstore's
17 percent refund rate is the highest of the four
stores, according to Speed.
The Berkeley bookstore has no refund policy,
Northwestern's is about 10 percent on textbooks
and Harvard gives a 10 percent refund on all of
the store's merchandise.
Explaining the Stanford Bookstore's high
refund rate for textbooks, Speed said, "Our phi
losophy is that books are essential to education,
and a sweatshirt is not. Almost all our profits
come from sales in the non-book areas, so, in es
sence, books are subsidized by these areas."
This week the Bookstore has sent over 8000
rebate checks out to members of the Stanford
community, and some students have received
checks for as much as $80.
Speed said the Bookstore recently sent a re
quest to expand the book section of the store to
University officials.
The bookstore's plans to move all office and
supply space off campus, and turn all the extra
space, including the store's basement, into sel
ling space for books, Speed said.
