## Graphic novels: Moore's serious comic books 
### Mark Tompkins Editorial staff 
So, you ask, what the hell is a graphic
novel? A paperback with a lot of heavy
breathing?
Not quite. "Graphic novel" is the
fancy term being given to the new wave
of comics series, comics that have
ditched the old Hulk-smash-puny
humans mentality in favor of something
much more ambitious.
Anyone who read Art Spiegelman's
"Maus" or Frank Miller's "Batman:
I he Dark Knight Returns" last year will
know of what 1 speak: "Maus" cast cats
and mice as Nazis and Jews in a comic
hook retelling of the Holocaust, with
provocative results, while "The Dark
Knight" depicted a brooding middle
aged Batman with overt fascist tenden
cies. Both books sold extremely well
and attracted an incredible amount of
media attention, raising the possibility
that comics might actually be read by
adults.
I he trend continues with three new
books out from Warner Books. There is
Frank Miller's "Ronin," the most strik
ing display of how kinetic comics
storytelling can be. as well as "Swamp
Thing" and "Watchmen," both by
writer Alan Moore and several exceed
ingly talented artists. (All three books
are reprints of recently published DC
Comics series). "Swamp Thing" is, to
resort to labels, a horror strip that uses
florid, almost demented imagery to
make some telling comments about
modern life.
"Watchmen" is rather more complex;
right now it is the best case to be made
for the idea that comics are — hold on
tight now — an art form, just like films
or novels. A somewhat disturbing work,
it shows exactly what would occur if
such creatures as superheroes did exist.
It is also a piece of apocalyptic fiction,
ticking off the last few minutes before
nuclear Armageddon and positing
Hiroshima as the true face of the 20th
century.
And don't worry, Alan Moore has
probably never heard of you either. If
you don't know his name, however, get
thee to a bookstore and rectify the situa
tion: you'll be glad you did.
Moore, an Englishman, was in New
York recently to publicize his graphic
novels, and over the phone 1 found this
"astute observer of the human com
edy. ' as the New York Times Book

Review called him, to be an extremely
articulate and gracious fellow.
He said he plans to write a novel
someday, has written a screenplay for
Malcom McLaren titled "Fashion
Beast" and has a new DC series coming
out next year called "V For Vendetta,"
in which a coalition of right-wing ex
tremist groups take over a nuked-out
England in the near future. Any coin
cidences between Moore's work and
real life are, of course, strictly inten
tional.
DAILY: "Watchmen" shows an
America that won the Vietnam War,
where President Nixon has won five
terms as president. It's an especially in
teresting picture of the United States,
considering that you're English.
MOORE: Obviously we do have a differ
ent perspective of America in Europe, or
in the proposed "limited theater of ther
monuclear war," as it's now called.
Without making sweeping generaliza
tions about the country you know far
better than I, I get the impression that
there's a certain insularity in the Ameri
can political perspective, especially in
the Reagan era, that tends to ignore the
perspective of the rest of the world. And
that's troubling to me. So one of the
things we were trying to do in
"Watchmen" was try and give a more
European view of America, in comic
book form.
In "Watchmen," it's as if all of the
traumas that have beset America in the
last 20 years never happened, where
there was never a president that was dis
graced, or a war lost. I was also trying to
examine some of the problems of the
world today — America, it's England
writ large, and it's in the forefront of the
world's problems. What we tried to do in
our parallel 1985 was to give a picture of
our world in 1987.
Now, when you do that — talk about
the real world— you immediately run up
against people's prejudices. If I had
made Ronald Reagan the president in
"Watchmen," then as soon as someone
who doesn't share my views picked it
up, they would instantly be alienated.
They would switch off, and the only
people who would read it would be
people who agreed with me anyway,
which would be somewhat less than use
less. By using Richard Nixon, you im
mediately bypass people's emotional
feelings about it, in the same way that in
stead of talking about nuclear missiles,
you can talk about Dr. Manhattan (a

"Watchmen'' character).
It's like a form of algebra, dealing with
the real world in this more abstract way.
By sidestepping people's prejudices,
you can actually talk about something
that matters. I should point out that I'm
not concerned that people should think
as I think; I'm just concerned that
people should think.
I don't want to put over any political
view; all 1 want to do is present a range
of issues which people should consider
for themselves, as long as they're actu
ally thinking about what's going on —
because I see a lot of cinema and IV
which seems designed to have the oppo
site effect, to blandly entertain and
forestall any real thinking about any
thing serious.
DAILY: It's interesting how comics
lately have become more provocative,
while IV and movies are getting blander
and blander, for the most part.
MOORE: I think that that is true, and I
would extend it to cover a lot of rock
music. It's the visual track that seems to
be a requirement for any art form in the
l9K()s, and we've had two or three
generations reared on television now.
Hut films — although they are images —
they tend to lose out because, except for
in very rare instances, they aren't the vi
sion of one or two people. They're more
or less designed by committee to meet
the perceived audience requirements.
Everything else is completely bland
and tasteless, but not in the sense of
being offensive. In records too, to a
degree — I was talking about this with a
friend of mine, David James, who was in
Bauhaus, and we were saying how the
pop bands of the moment, even if they
killed and ate babies on stage, they could
never ever be anywhere near as threat

ening as Elvis Presley. They're in some
law of diminishing returns. Back in the
'50s rock music was subversive and dan
gerous; these days it's not.
In comics, we can still surprise people
and, 1 think, reach them in a different
way than films or music can. The
majority of the stuff around today, it's
like cultural Valium. I would much
rather do something which simply
agitated people or got them to think a
bit.
DAILY: Do you think that these new
graphic novels can really work in getting
people to take comics seriously? I worry
that there's going to be a glut of them,
since every hack company seems to be
rushing out with one of these square
bound novels.'
MOORE: It's true; there are a lot of
people who don't understand what made
"Dark Knight'' such a success. The next
six months to a year should tell. Person
ally, I'm optimistic. Comics have never
gotten this far before. Even if we turn
back now, we'll have slowly eroded the
perception of comics as just being, you
know, junk.
It is possible, in a comic book, to give
an appreciation of literary values. Espe
cially to people of this current, post
literate generation who are very con
cerned with having a visual aspect to
their entertainment. You can lure them
in with this nice colorful gaudy package,
and hopefully teach them something
about literary values. I can see comics
having quite a beneficial effect in that
area. I suppose it's a bit strong to say
this, but 1 can see comics becoming part
of the future of literature. The potential
is there. It depends on how it's
developed.

DAILY: Comparing comics to other
forms, do you think there are things that
comics can do better than any other
medium?
M(K)RK: Absolutely. In "Watchmen,'
we tried to do things that are unique to
comics; there are a number of things.
Certainly, presenting visual information
at the level of density we did — you
can't get that in films because you're
trapped in the two-hour running time. In
"Watchmen," you can do what you can
do with a novel.
You can turn back four or five pages
and say, " This piece of dialogue does
echo that piece of dialogue; this image
does have a resonance with that image."
You can study it at your own pace. You
can absorb the full depth, complexity
and density of the piece. In some ways
you get the best of what a novel can do.
If I'd written " Watchmen" as a novel
— every one of those panels — it would
have been impossible to slip that visual
data by the reader. In a novel, every
thing has to be pointed out by the text,
so everything is up in the foreground.
You can't sort of misdirect the reader, as
you can with a comic. In a comic you
can have a whole different story going
on in the background.
We're still mapping out the areas
where comics have an edge over other
mediums. There's a lot more work to be
done with the medium yet, because it's
in its infancy.
DAILY: It seems as if there have been
many talented artists in comics, but that
the writers haven't known how to take
control of the medium.
\I(K)RL: That has been the big draw
back to comics for the last 20 years. The
artists in comics have always been on a
par with the artists in other mediums.
We've always had good artists, but the
comics have always been about two
guys in costumes trying to eviscerate
each other. What's happening at the mo
ment is that writers are starting to
achieve parity. I think if you look at
most of the comics that have done well
over the past year, the single uniting fac
tor is that they're all well written. That
seems to be the missing element that's fi
nally fallen into place.
We now have stories to match the art,
and we can lead comics out of this
juvenile superhero ghetto. And maybe
comics can finally take their place
alongside films and novels, since the
medium is capable of addressing the real
issues of everyday life.

So, you ask, what the hell is a graphic
novel? A paperback with a lot of heavy
breathing?

over the past year, the single uniting fac
tor is that they're all well written. That
seems to be the missing element that's fi
nally fallen into place.
We now have stories to match the art,
and we can lead comics out of this
juvenile superhero ghetto. And maybe
comics can finally take their place
alongside films and novels, since the
medium is capable of addressing the real
issues of everyday life.

So, you ask, what the hell is a graphic
novel? A paperback with a lot of heavy
breathing?
Not quite. "Graphic novel" is the
fancy term being given to the new wave
of comics series, comics that have
ditched the old Hulk-smash-puny
humans mentality in favor of something
much more ambitious.
Anyone who read Art Spiegelman's
"Maus" or Frank Miller's "Batman:
I he Dark Knight Returns" last year will
know of what 1 speak: "Maus" cast cats
and mice as Nazis and Jews in a comic
hook retelling of the Holocaust, with
provocative results, while "The Dark
Knight" depicted a brooding middle
aged Batman with overt fascist tenden
cies. Both books sold extremely well
and attracted an incredible amount of
media attention, raising the possibility
that comics might actually be read by
adults.
I he trend continues with three new
books out from Warner Books. There is
Frank Miller's "Ronin," the most strik
ing display of how kinetic comics
storytelling can be. as well as "Swamp
Thing" and "Watchmen," both by
writer Alan Moore and several exceed
ingly talented artists. (All three books
are reprints of recently published DC
Comics series). "Swamp Thing" is, to
resort to labels, a horror strip that uses
florid, almost demented imagery to
make some telling comments about
modern life.
"Watchmen" is rather more complex;
right now it is the best case to be made
for the idea that comics are — hold on
tight now — an art form, just like films
or novels. A somewhat disturbing work,
it shows exactly what would occur if
such creatures as superheroes did exist.
It is also a piece of apocalyptic fiction,
ticking off the last few minutes before
nuclear Armageddon and positing
Hiroshima as the true face of the 20th
century.
And don't worry, Alan Moore has
probably never heard of you either. If
you don't know his name, however, get
thee to a bookstore and rectify the situa
tion: you'll be glad you did.
Moore, an Englishman, was in New
York recently to publicize his graphic
novels, and over the phone 1 found this
"astute observer of the human com
edy. ' as the New York Times Book

Review called him, to be an extremely
articulate and gracious fellow.
He said he plans to write a novel
someday, has written a screenplay for
Malcom McLaren titled "Fashion
Beast" and has a new DC series coming
out next year called "V For Vendetta,"
in which a coalition of right-wing ex
tremist groups take over a nuked-out
England in the near future. Any coin
cidences between Moore's work and
real life are, of course, strictly inten
tional.
DAILY: "Watchmen" shows an
America that won the Vietnam War,
where President Nixon has won five
terms as president. It's an especially in
teresting picture of the United States,
considering that you're English.
MOORE: Obviously we do have a differ
ent perspective of America in Europe, or
in the proposed "limited theater of ther
monuclear war," as it's now called.
Without making sweeping generaliza
tions about the country you know far
better than I, I get the impression that
there's a certain insularity in the Ameri
can political perspective, especially in
the Reagan era, that tends to ignore the
perspective of the rest of the world. And
that's troubling to me. So one of the
things we were trying to do in
"Watchmen" was try and give a more
European view of America, in comic
book form.
In "Watchmen," it's as if all of the
traumas that have beset America in the
last 20 years never happened, where
there was never a president that was dis
graced, or a war lost. I was also trying to
examine some of the problems of the
world today — America, it's England
writ large, and it's in the forefront of the
world's problems. What we tried to do in
our parallel 1985 was to give a picture of
our world in 1987.
Now, when you do that — talk about
the real world— you immediately run up
against people's prejudices. If I had
made Ronald Reagan the president in
"Watchmen," then as soon as someone
who doesn't share my views picked it
up, they would instantly be alienated.
They would switch off, and the only
people who would read it would be
people who agreed with me anyway,
which would be somewhat less than use
less. By using Richard Nixon, you im
mediately bypass people's emotional
feelings about it, in the same way that in
stead of talking about nuclear missiles,
you can talk about Dr. Manhattan (a

"Watchmen'' character).
It's like a form of algebra, dealing with
the real world in this more abstract way.
By sidestepping people's prejudices,
you can actually talk about something
that matters. I should point out that I'm
not concerned that people should think
as I think; I'm just concerned that
people should think.
I don't want to put over any political
view; all 1 want to do is present a range
of issues which people should consider
for themselves, as long as they're actu
ally thinking about what's going on —
because I see a lot of cinema and IV
which seems designed to have the oppo
site effect, to blandly entertain and
forestall any real thinking about any
thing serious.
DAILY: It's interesting how comics
lately have become more provocative,
while IV and movies are getting blander
and blander, for the most part.
MOORE: I think that that is true, and I
would extend it to cover a lot of rock
music. It's the visual track that seems to
be a requirement for any art form in the
l9K()s, and we've had two or three
generations reared on television now.
Hut films — although they are images —
they tend to lose out because, except for
in very rare instances, they aren't the vi
sion of one or two people. They're more
or less designed by committee to meet
the perceived audience requirements.
Everything else is completely bland
and tasteless, but not in the sense of
being offensive. In records too, to a
degree — I was talking about this with a
friend of mine, David James, who was in
Bauhaus, and we were saying how the
pop bands of the moment, even if they
killed and ate babies on stage, they could
never ever be anywhere near as threat

ening as Elvis Presley. They're in some
law of diminishing returns. Back in the
'50s rock music was subversive and dan
gerous; these days it's not.
In comics, we can still surprise people
and, 1 think, reach them in a different
way than films or music can. The
majority of the stuff around today, it's
like cultural Valium. I would much
rather do something which simply
agitated people or got them to think a
bit.
DAILY: Do you think that these new
graphic novels can really work in getting
people to take comics seriously? I worry
that there's going to be a glut of them,
since every hack company seems to be
rushing out with one of these square
bound novels.'
MOORE: It's true; there are a lot of
people who don't understand what made
"Dark Knight'' such a success. The next
six months to a year should tell. Person
ally, I'm optimistic. Comics have never
gotten this far before. Even if we turn
back now, we'll have slowly eroded the
perception of comics as just being, you
know, junk.
It is possible, in a comic book, to give
an appreciation of literary values. Espe
cially to people of this current, post
literate generation who are very con
cerned with having a visual aspect to
their entertainment. You can lure them
in with this nice colorful gaudy package,
and hopefully teach them something
about literary values. I can see comics
having quite a beneficial effect in that
area. I suppose it's a bit strong to say
this, but 1 can see comics becoming part
of the future of literature. The potential
is there. It depends on how it's
developed.

DAILY: Comparing comics to other
forms, do you think there are things that
comics can do better than any other
medium?
M(K)RK: Absolutely. In "Watchmen,'
we tried to do things that are unique to
comics; there are a number of things.
Certainly, presenting visual information
at the level of density we did — you
can't get that in films because you're
trapped in the two-hour running time. In
"Watchmen," you can do what you can
do with a novel.
You can turn back four or five pages
and say, " This piece of dialogue does
echo that piece of dialogue; this image
does have a resonance with that image."
You can study it at your own pace. You
can absorb the full depth, complexity
and density of the piece. In some ways
you get the best of what a novel can do.
If I'd written " Watchmen" as a novel
— every one of those panels — it would
have been impossible to slip that visual
data by the reader. In a novel, every
thing has to be pointed out by the text,
so everything is up in the foreground.
You can't sort of misdirect the reader, as
you can with a comic. In a comic you
can have a whole different story going
on in the background.
We're still mapping out the areas
where comics have an edge over other
mediums. There's a lot more work to be
done with the medium yet, because it's
in its infancy.
DAILY: It seems as if there have been
many talented artists in comics, but that
the writers haven't known how to take
control of the medium.
\I(K)RL: That has been the big draw
back to comics for the last 20 years. The
artists in comics have always been on a
par with the artists in other mediums.
We've always had good artists, but the
comics have always been about two
guys in costumes trying to eviscerate
each other. What's happening at the mo
ment is that writers are starting to
achieve parity. I think if you look at
most of the comics that have done well
over the past year, the single uniting fac
tor is that they're all well written. That
seems to be the missing element that's fi

artists in comics have always been on a
par with the artists in other mediums.
We've always had good artists, but the
comics have always been about two
guys in costumes trying to eviscerate
each other. What's happening at the mo
ment is that writers are starting to
achieve parity. I think if you look at
most of the comics that have done well
over the past year, the single uniting fac
tor is that they're all well written. That
seems to be the missing element that's fi
nally fallen into place.
We now have stories to match the art,
and we can lead comics out of this
juvenile superhero ghetto. And maybe
comics can finally take their place
alongside films and novels, since the
medium is capable of addressing the real
issues of everyday life.

So, you ask, what the hell is a graphic
novel? A paperback with a lot of heavy
breathing?
Not quite. "Graphic novel" is the
fancy term being given to the new wave
of comics series, comics that have
ditched the old Hulk-smash-puny
humans mentality in favor of something
much more ambitious.
Anyone who read Art Spiegelman's
"Maus" or Frank Miller's "Batman:
I he Dark Knight Returns" last year will
know of what 1 speak: "Maus" cast cats
and mice as Nazis and Jews in a comic
hook retelling of the Holocaust, with
provocative results, while "The Dark
Knight" depicted a brooding middle
aged Batman with overt fascist tenden
cies. Both books sold extremely well
and attracted an incredible amount of
media attention, raising the possibility
that comics might actually be read by
adults.
I he trend continues with three new
books out from Warner Books. There is
Frank Miller's "Ronin," the most strik
ing display of how kinetic comics
storytelling can be. as well as "Swamp
Thing" and "Watchmen," both by
writer Alan Moore and several exceed
ingly talented artists. (All three books
are reprints of recently published DC
Comics series). "Swamp Thing" is, to
resort to labels, a horror strip that uses
florid, almost demented imagery to
make some telling comments about
modern life.
"Watchmen" is rather more complex;
right now it is the best case to be made
for the idea that comics are — hold on
tight now — an art form, just like films
or novels. A somewhat disturbing work,
it shows exactly what would occur if
such creatures as superheroes did exist.
It is also a piece of apocalyptic fiction,
ticking off the last few minutes before
nuclear Armageddon and positing
Hiroshima as the true face of the 20th
century.
And don't worry, Alan Moore has
probably never heard of you either. If
you don't know his name, however, get
thee to a bookstore and rectify the situa
tion: you'll be glad you did.
Moore, an Englishman, was in New
York recently to publicize his graphic
novels, and over the phone 1 found this
"astute observer of the human com
edy. ' as the New York Times Book

Review called him, to be an extremely
articulate and gracious fellow.
He said he plans to write a novel
someday, has written a screenplay for
Malcom McLaren titled "Fashion
Beast" and has a new DC series coming
out next year called "V For Vendetta,"
in which a coalition of right-wing ex
tremist groups take over a nuked-out
England in the near future. Any coin
cidences between Moore's work and
real life are, of course, strictly inten
tional.
DAILY: "Watchmen" shows an
America that won the Vietnam War,
where President Nixon has won five
terms as president. It's an especially in
teresting picture of the United States,
considering that you're English.
MOORE: Obviously we do have a differ
ent perspective of America in Europe, or
in the proposed "limited theater of ther
monuclear war," as it's now called.
Without making sweeping generaliza
tions about the country you know far
better than I, I get the impression that
there's a certain insularity in the Ameri
can political perspective, especially in
the Reagan era, that tends to ignore the
perspective of the rest of the world. And
that's troubling to me. So one of the
things we were trying to do in
"Watchmen" was try and give a more
European view of America, in comic
book form.
In "Watchmen," it's as if all of the
traumas that have beset America in the
last 20 years never happened, where
there was never a president that was dis
graced, or a war lost. I was also trying to
examine some of the problems of the
world today — America, it's England
writ large, and it's in the forefront of the
world's problems. What we tried to do in
our parallel 1985 was to give a picture of
our world in 1987.
Now, when you do that — talk about
the real world— you immediately run up
against people's prejudices. If I had
made Ronald Reagan the president in
"Watchmen," then as soon as someone
who doesn't share my views picked it
up, they would instantly be alienated.
They would switch off, and the only
people who would read it would be
people who agreed with me anyway,
which would be somewhat less than use
less. By using Richard Nixon, you im
mediately bypass people's emotional
feelings about it, in the same way that in
stead of talking about nuclear missiles,
you can talk about Dr. Manhattan (a

"Watchmen'' character).
It's like a form of algebra, dealing with
the real world in this more abstract way.
By sidestepping people's prejudices,
you can actually talk about something
that matters. I should point out that I'm
not concerned that people should think
as I think; I'm just concerned that
people should think.
I don't want to put over any political
view; all 1 want to do is present a range
of issues which people should consider
for themselves, as long as they're actu
ally thinking about what's going on —
because I see a lot of cinema and IV
which seems designed to have the oppo
site effect, to blandly entertain and
forestall any real thinking about any
thing serious.
DAILY: It's interesting how comics
lately have become more provocative,
while IV and movies are getting blander
and blander, for the most part.
MOORE: I think that that is true, and I
would extend it to cover a lot of rock
music. It's the visual track that seems to
be a requirement for any art form in the
l9K()s, and we've had two or three
generations reared on television now.
Hut films — although they are images —
they tend to lose out because, except for
in very rare instances, they aren't the vi
sion of one or two people. They're more
or less designed by committee to meet
the perceived audience requirements.
Everything else is completely bland
and tasteless, but not in the sense of
being offensive. In records too, to a
degree — I was talking about this with a
friend of mine, David James, who was in
Bauhaus, and we were saying how the
pop bands of the moment, even if they
killed and ate babies on stage, they could
never ever be anywhere near as threat

ening as Elvis Presley. They're in some
law of diminishing returns. Back in the
'50s rock music was subversive and dan
gerous; these days it's not.
In comics, we can still surprise people
and, 1 think, reach them in a different
way than films or music can. The
majority of the stuff around today, it's
like cultural Valium. I would much
rather do something which simply
agitated people or got them to think a
bit.
DAILY: Do you think that these new
graphic novels can really work in getting
people to take comics seriously? I worry
that there's going to be a glut of them,
since every hack company seems to be
rushing out with one of these square
bound novels.'
MOORE: It's true; there are a lot of
people who don't understand what made
"Dark Knight'' such a success. The next
six months to a year should tell. Person
ally, I'm optimistic. Comics have never
gotten this far before. Even if we turn
back now, we'll have slowly eroded the
perception of comics as just being, you
know, junk.
It is possible, in a comic book, to give
an appreciation of literary values. Espe
cially to people of this current, post
literate generation who are very con
cerned with having a visual aspect to
their entertainment. You can lure them
in with this nice colorful gaudy package,
and hopefully teach them something
about literary values. I can see comics
having quite a beneficial effect in that
area. I suppose it's a bit strong to say
this, but 1 can see comics becoming part
of the future of literature. The potential
is there. It depends on how it's
developed.

DAILY: Comparing comics to other
forms, do you think there are things that
comics can do better than any other
medium?
M(K)RK: Absolutely. In "Watchmen,'
we tried to do things that are unique to
comics; there are a number of things.
Certainly, presenting visual information
at the level of density we did — you
can't get that in films because you're
trapped in the two-hour running time. In
"Watchmen," you can do what you can
do with a novel.
You can turn back four or five pages
and say, " This piece of dialogue does
echo that piece of dialogue; this image
does have a resonance with that image."
You can study it at your own pace. You
can absorb the full depth, complexity
and density of the piece. In some ways
you get the best of what a novel can do.
If I'd written " Watchmen" as a novel
— every one of those panels — it would
have been impossible to slip that visual
data by the reader. In a novel, every
thing has to be pointed out by the text,
so everything is up in the foreground.
You can't sort of misdirect the reader, as
you can with a comic. In a comic you
can have a whole different story going
on in the background.
We're still mapping out the areas
where comics have an edge over other
mediums. There's a lot more work to be
done with the medium yet, because it's
in its infancy.
DAILY: It seems as if there have been
many talented artists in comics, but that
the writers haven't known how to take
control of the medium.
\I(K)RL: That has been the big draw
back to comics for the last 20 years. The

where comics have an edge over other
mediums. There's a lot more work to be
done with the medium yet, because it's
in its infancy.
DAILY: It seems as if there have been
many talented artists in comics, but that
the writers haven't known how to take
control of the medium.
\I(K)RL: That has been the big draw
back to comics for the last 20 years. The
artists in comics have always been on a
par with the artists in other mediums.
We've always had good artists, but the
comics have always been about two
guys in costumes trying to eviscerate
each other. What's happening at the mo
ment is that writers are starting to
achieve parity. I think if you look at
most of the comics that have done well
over the past year, the single uniting fac
tor is that they're all well written. That
seems to be the missing element that's fi
nally fallen into place.
We now have stories to match the art,
and we can lead comics out of this
juvenile superhero ghetto. And maybe
comics can finally take their place
alongside films and novels, since the
medium is capable of addressing the real
issues of everyday life.
