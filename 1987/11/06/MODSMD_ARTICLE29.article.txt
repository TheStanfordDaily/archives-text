## Cardinal looks to break the Trojan jinx 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
The Stanford football team
broke a four-game losing streak
earlier this season, but now the
Cardinal faces an even more for
midable task. Tomorrow at the
Los Angeles Coliseum, Stanford
will attempt to break a seven
game losing streak.
USC (4-1 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, 5-3 overall) has beaten
the Cardinal seven years in a
row, and Stanford (2-3 in the Pac
-10, 3-5 overall) hasn't won a
matchup with the Trojans since
1975 (Tne two teams tied 21-21 in
1979, costing USC the national
championship.). In the last 30
Cardinal-Trojan meetings, USC
holds a 25-4-1 advantage.
In last year's 10-0 loss at Stan
ford Stadium, the then-No. 19
Cardinal managed only eight first
downs and did not make it past
the USC 38-yard line. It was the
first time Stanford had been shut
out at home since 1954.
Both teams have a lot at stake
in tomorrow's 12:30 p.m. con
test. ABC has made the game its
No. I broadcast (air time at
noon) because USC is still in the
running for the Rose Bowl, and a
win would keep the Trojans in
the hunt with UCLA, which
leads the conference with a 5-0
league record.
"We control our own des
tiny,'' said first-year USC Coach
Larry Smith, who came over
from Arizona in the offseason.
"It's a matter of wiping the slate

clean and preparing for the next
opponent. We've got three con
ference games to play and so
does UCLA. There can't be any
letdowns."
Stanford's goals are a little less
lofty, but important nonetheless.
A loss would mean a losing
season for the Cardinal; a win
would keep alive hopes for a win
ning record.
"This is a season game," Stan
ford linebacker Kurt Colehower
said. "We didn't get off to a good
start, and this is a big game,
down there and on national TV. If
we can stay in our pads and
pants, not get too wild and main
tain our intensity, we can win the
game."
The Cardinal will be at almost
full strength for the game.
Colehower, who missed the last
two games with a sprained ankle,
is expected to start, and defen
sive tackle Lester Archambeau
will also start, despite breaking
his left hand last week against
Arizona. Quarterback Brian
Johnson has fully recovered from
a mild concussion suffered late in
that game.
Kicker John Hopkins is still
out with a sprained knee, al
though the freshman may be able
to start working out this
weekend, and linebacker Bruce
Lang is listed as doubtful with an
ankle sprain.
Junior Darron Bennett, a
starter at linebacker earlier in the
season, unexpectedly announced
Wednesday that he is leaving
Stanford and transferring to

Eastern Washington State. Ben
nett, who has 31 tackles and an
interception on the year, said he
wants to be closer to his
hometown of Spokane, Wa., and
that his sudden withdrawal from
school is not related to football or
academics.
While Stanford may be a bit
thin at linebacker with Bennett
gone, Lang out and Colehower
just back from injury, USC has
no injuries to report. Running
back Steven Webster (knee con
tusion) and quarterback Rodney
Peete (hip pointer) will both
start.
That's good news for the
Trojans, as Peete and Webster
are carrying the offense this
season. Peete, just a junior, is al
ready the USC career passing
leader with 4497 yards, and nine
more completions will give him
the career lead in that category as
well. He has completed 59 per
cent of his passes for 1793 yards,
has 12 touchdowns and eight in
terceptions this year and is third
in the Pac-10 in total offense at
239 yards per game.
"He's a very active, mobile
quarterback," said Stanford
Coach Jack Elway of Peete, who
has also rushed for 118 yards and
three touchdowns. "He runs the
option well. It will be a chore to
defend him."
Then there's Webster. When
the junior tailback has rushed for
over 100 yards in a game, the
Trojans are 5-0.

Mantord quarterback Brian Johnson, here looking for wide receiver Jeff James (foreground) in last Satur
day's loss to Arizona, hopes fewer of his passes fall into enemy hands at USC tomorrow.
"He's been the key man for us
when he gets the football,"
Smith said. "He's been fighting
injuries all year, but when he's
been on the field, it's been a big
difference for our team."
Webster's spent a lot of time
fighting injuries. He sat out most
of his freshman year with an
ankle injury.
This year, however, a rela
tively healthy Webster has torn
up the league. He's the man who
leads the Pac-10 — and Gaston
Green — in rushing, averaging
118.7 yards per game. The junior
has also scored six touchdowns
and caught 13 passes for 121
yards.
The rest of the Trojan stable
consists of fullbacks Leroy Holt,
who has 332 yards rushing, and
Ryan Knight, along with fresh

man tailback Scott Lockwood.
The leading receiver is Frik Aff
holter, who scored the lone
touchdown in last year's win at
Stanford. Flanker Randy Tanner
had a 21-yard touchdown recep
tion last week against Washing
ton State and also scored on a 33-
yard end-around. The USC line
is anchored by All-America can
didate Dave Cadigan, a 6-foot-5,
280-pound tackle.
Another honors candidate for
the Trojans is linebacker Marcus
Cotton, who has been getting
more attention for his scathing
remarks about Stanford in a
Seattle paper two weeks ago than
for his play. The senior is just
fourth on the team in tackles with
89, but does have eight sacks to
lead the defense and is a semi
tinalist for the Butkus award for
the second straight year.
Inside linebacker Keith Davis
tops the Trojans with 109 tackles,
followed closely by Delmar Chel
sey with 108.

118.7 yards per game. The junior
has also scored six touchdowns
and caught 13 passes for 121
yards.
The rest of the Trojan stable
consists of fullbacks Leroy Holt,
who has 332 yards rushing, and
Ryan Knight, along with fresh

man tailback Scott Lockwood.
The leading receiver is Frik Aff
holter, who scored the lone
touchdown in last year's win at
Stanford. Flanker Randy Tanner
had a 21-yard touchdown recep
tion last week against Washing
ton State and also scored on a 33-
yard end-around. The USC line
is anchored by All-America can
didate Dave Cadigan, a 6-foot-5,
280-pound tackle.
Another honors candidate for
the Trojans is linebacker Marcus
Cotton, who has been getting
more attention for his scathing
remarks about Stanford in a
Seattle paper two weeks ago than
for his play. The senior is just
fourth on the team in tackles with
89, but does have eight sacks to
lead the defense and is a semi
tinalist for the Butkus award for
the second straight year.
Inside linebacker Keith Davis
tops the Trojans with 109 tackles,
followed closely by Delmar Chel
sey with 108.
The Stanford football team
broke a four-game losing streak
earlier this season, but now the
Cardinal faces an even more for
midable task. Tomorrow at the
Los Angeles Coliseum, Stanford
will attempt to break a seven
game losing streak.
USC (4-1 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, 5-3 overall) has beaten
the Cardinal seven years in a
row, and Stanford (2-3 in the Pac
-10, 3-5 overall) hasn't won a
matchup with the Trojans since
1975 (Tne two teams tied 21-21 in
1979, costing USC the national
championship.). In the last 30
Cardinal-Trojan meetings, USC
holds a 25-4-1 advantage.
In last year's 10-0 loss at Stan
ford Stadium, the then-No. 19
Cardinal managed only eight first
downs and did not make it past
the USC 38-yard line. It was the
first time Stanford had been shut
out at home since 1954.
Both teams have a lot at stake
in tomorrow's 12:30 p.m. con
test. ABC has made the game its
No. I broadcast (air time at
noon) because USC is still in the
running for the Rose Bowl, and a
win would keep the Trojans in
the hunt with UCLA, which
leads the conference with a 5-0
league record.
"We control our own des
tiny,'' said first-year USC Coach
Larry Smith, who came over
from Arizona in the offseason.
"It's a matter of wiping the slate

clean and preparing for the next
opponent. We've got three con
ference games to play and so
does UCLA. There can't be any
letdowns."
Stanford's goals are a little less
lofty, but important nonetheless.
A loss would mean a losing
season for the Cardinal; a win
would keep alive hopes for a win
ning record.
"This is a season game," Stan
ford linebacker Kurt Colehower
said. "We didn't get off to a good
start, and this is a big game,
down there and on national TV. If
we can stay in our pads and
pants, not get too wild and main
tain our intensity, we can win the
game."
The Cardinal will be at almost
full strength for the game.
Colehower, who missed the last
two games with a sprained ankle,
is expected to start, and defen
sive tackle Lester Archambeau
will also start, despite breaking
his left hand last week against
Arizona. Quarterback Brian
Johnson has fully recovered from
a mild concussion suffered late in
that game.
Kicker John Hopkins is still
out with a sprained knee, al
though the freshman may be able
to start working out this
weekend, and linebacker Bruce
Lang is listed as doubtful with an
ankle sprain.
Junior Darron Bennett, a
starter at linebacker earlier in the
season, unexpectedly announced
Wednesday that he is leaving
Stanford and transferring to

Eastern Washington State. Ben
nett, who has 31 tackles and an
interception on the year, said he
wants to be closer to his
hometown of Spokane, Wa., and
that his sudden withdrawal from
school is not related to football or
academics.
While Stanford may be a bit
thin at linebacker with Bennett
gone, Lang out and Colehower
just back from injury, USC has
no injuries to report. Running
back Steven Webster (knee con
tusion) and quarterback Rodney
Peete (hip pointer) will both
start.
That's good news for the
Trojans, as Peete and Webster
are carrying the offense this
season. Peete, just a junior, is al
ready the USC career passing
leader with 4497 yards, and nine
more completions will give him
the career lead in that category as
well. He has completed 59 per
cent of his passes for 1793 yards,
has 12 touchdowns and eight in
terceptions this year and is third
in the Pac-10 in total offense at
239 yards per game.
"He's a very active, mobile
quarterback," said Stanford
Coach Jack Elway of Peete, who
has also rushed for 118 yards and
three touchdowns. "He runs the
option well. It will be a chore to
defend him."
Then there's Webster. When
the junior tailback has rushed for
over 100 yards in a game, the
Trojans are 5-0.

Mantord quarterback Brian Johnson, here looking for wide receiver Jeff James (foreground) in last Satur
day's loss to Arizona, hopes fewer of his passes fall into enemy hands at USC tomorrow.
"He's been the key man for us
when he gets the football,"
Smith said. "He's been fighting
injuries all year, but when he's
been on the field, it's been a big
difference for our team."
Webster's spent a lot of time
fighting injuries. He sat out most
of his freshman year with an
ankle injury.
This year, however, a rela
tively healthy Webster has torn
up the league. He's the man who
leads the Pac-10 — and Gaston
Green — in rushing, averaging
118.7 yards per game. The junior
has also scored six touchdowns
and caught 13 passes for 121
yards.
