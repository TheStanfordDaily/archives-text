# Stanford bids for NASA robotics center
## 
### Haru Connolly Senior staff writer 
Stanford will submit today an $8.5-million
proposal to NASA to build a new space
robotics engineering research center here, ac
cording to Asst. Computer Science Prof. Mi
chael Genesereth.
"We have a strong proposal and a good
chance," said Computer Science Prof. Nils
Nilsson. If approved, the Stanford Center for
Space Robotics would study problems in
space technology.
NASA currently maintains eight research
centers at universities across the United
States, and is planning to add eight more. The
space agency will decide where to locate the
new centers by March or April of next year.
Genesereth said Stanford's proximity to
the NASA Ames Research Center in Moun
tain View is "extremely significant. Stanford

already has 10 contracts (with NASA), which
is a large connection as it is."
The proposed center would focus on the
problems of working in space. "The main
idea is we need to research the technology we
need to be able to work in space," Nilsson
said.
Some of the problems of space technology
include creating teams of autonomous robots
to work on space stations, to assemble equip
ment and to prepare for possible landings on
Mars, Genesereth said.
"NASA also will look at the effects (of a
center) on new curriculum, graduates and un
dergraduates," Nilsson said. Student intern
ships and "a lot" of graduate research assis
tant positions would be available, he said.
According to Genesereth, NASA will re
quire no further input from the University. A
peer committee will review Stanford's pro
posal. he said, adding that "it's coming up

very quickly."
Faculty from the Aeronautics/Astro
nomics, Computer Science and Mechanical
Engineering Departments collaborated on the
proposal, Genesereth said.
Competition for the centers will he stiff,
Nilsson said. "Some outstanding proposals
could come from MIT and Carnegie-Mellon
University," he said.
Genesereth said the new center would he a
long-term project. "We would expect 10 min
imum years of funding." he said. "NASA
promises to fund for four years and then taper
off for the rest, although we assume funding
for 10 years."
According to Genesereth, Stanford submit
ted a five-year budget with its proposal that
requested $500,000 for the first half year and
$2 million for the next year. Accounting for
inflation, the budget totals SK.S million, the
maximum NASA allows each proposal.
