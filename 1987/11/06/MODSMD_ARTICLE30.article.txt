# Ducks visit tonight, Beavers tomorrow
## Spikers seek sweep in Maples 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Despite the fact that basketball season
does not begin until later this month. Stan
ford students will likely be treated to some
rebounding tonight.
The Stanford women's volleyball team will
try to bounce back from a tough five-game
loss Tuesday to No. 2 Pacific when it takes
k on Oregon tonight in Maples Pavilion. The
Cardinal will be in action again tomorrow
night when Oregon State comes to Maples.
Both contests begin at 7:30 p.m.
Stanford, currently ranked third in the na
tion, comes in to the weekend with a 19-4
record and leads in the Pacific 10 Conference
at 11-1. The Ducks are close behind in the
league with a 9-4 record, good for a third
place tie with USC. UCLA is in second with
a 10-3 mark.
"That's a big game (against Oregon)," said
Stanford Coach Don Shaw. "We've got to be
ready to play against Oregon."
The key for Stanford in its drive to stay on
top in the Pac-10 race is its trio of seniors,
Nancy Reno, Wendi Rush and Teresa Smith.
Rush, a setter, leads the team with 275 digs
and has recorded 994 assists so far. Reno is
tops in both kills (316) and blocks (%), while
Smith is second in kills with 308 and leads the
squad with 38 aces.
All three are having great years, but a big
reason for the Cardinal's good season is the
play of the team as a whole. Junior middle
blocker Laura Olesen has also been a star on
both offense (223 kills) and defense (84

blocks), while junior Amy Hayes and sopho
more Lara Asper have been successful in
their first season as full-time starters.
The team will face a strong challenge from
the Ducks, though. Oregon is led by senior
outside hitter Teri Kramer, fifth in the Pac-10
with a 3.86 kills per game average (right be-

hind Reno's 3.99 and ahead of Smith's 3.84).
She is also quite an accomplished defensive
player as she is ninth in the league with a 2.90
digs per game average.
The other big offensive threat the Ducks
possess is sophomore Michele krebsbach.
She was named to the Pac-10 All-Freshman
Team last year after finishing 1986 in the top
10 in the country in kills. The reason for these

hitters' success, besides their obvious talent,
is the play of sophomore setter Stephanie
Snyder. She led the nation in assists much of
last year and returns this year to run a more
balanced offense, taking the pressure off of
Kramer and krebsbach.
If the Cardinal can find a way to handle the
Ducks' firepower, it will still need to find a
way to run its own offense. The Ducks have
held their opponents to a .161 hitting
percentage, the lowest in the league â€” thanks
mostly to tremendous blocking. Junior Lauri
Krejcha is leading the nation in total blocks,
having tallied 152 already. The Ducks' other
middle blocker, sophomore Stephanie Drier,
is no slouch either, as her 1.17 blocks per
game average places her 10th in the confer
ence.
Tomorrow's match will likely not have the
drama of tonight's contest. The Beavers are
still eager for their first conference win. They
have a 3-18 record overall (thanks to three
matches against noted volleyball power
houses Lewis and Clark, Western Oregon
and Portland) with an 0-13 Pac-10 record.
Middle blocker Tami Good has led the young
Beavers this year, but the team is still last in
the league in kills, hitting percentage, assists
and digs.
As Oregon State has already played its two
matches against ninth-place Washington
State, dropping both, a Pac-10 win for the
Beavers is very unlikely. The team has been
improving continually all season, however,
and if the Cardinal comes into the match flat.

I lie Cardinal women's volleyball team hopes to start a new winning
streak this weekend against Oregon and Oregon State.
things could get a little interest
ing for Stanford.
The Cardinal has a big chance
to run away with the Pac-10 race
as second-place UCLA and
third-place USC are not playing
any conference matches this
weekend; and Stanford can give
another loss to Oregon, the other
team in a third-place tie. With a
pair of victories, Stanford will he
two-and-a-half games ahead of
UCLA, and three-and-a-half up
on USC and Oregon, with only
four conference matches left.
Winning the Pac-10 would be a
great boost to the Cardinal's
postseason hopes. Stanford is in
the West Region, probably ihe
toughest in the NCAA. This
region contains not only the
third-ranked Cardinal, but also
No. 4 BYU, No. 5 Colorado

State, No. 7 UCLA, No.l 1 USC,
No. 14 Oregon, No. 19 Pep
perdine and No. 20 Arizona
State.
Since only eight teams from
each region can qualify for the
NCAA playoffs, and the West
has eight top-20 teams, the level
of play in the regional competi
tion will be intense. Stanford's
goal is to host the regional this
year, and that honor will likely go
to the highest-ranked team. The
Cardinal is currently in that posi
tion, but any more losses would
hurt the team's regional bid.
Stanford is now winding down
its season; the team plays only
six more regularly scheduled
matches after this weekend. The
team travels to Arizona and
Arizona State next weekend,
hosts UCLA and USC the
weekend after that and goes to
Hawaii over Thanksgiving for a
pair of matches against the top
ranked Rainbow Wahines.
