# Water polo travels south

U P
I he Stanford water polo team faced
five top-10 teams last weekend; but be
cause each of these teams was ranked
below the then-No. 3 Cardinal the
probability of the weekend's results ac
tually improving the Cardinal's posi
tion was virtually nil. Stanford had
everything to lose and nothing to gain.
As it ended up, the Cardinal only lost
once, to then-No. 5 UC-lrvine.
I he result of that one loss was a
switch in the rankings. Stanford (18-5)
is now No. 5, while Irvine (12-7) moved
up to No. 3. Today and tomorrow, the
C animal will be in Los Angeles playing
two higher-ranked teams: No. 4 UCLA
(21-6) and No. 2 USC (17-5).
Fhe teams are so evenly matched
that it is just as conceivable that the
Cardinal will win both games as it is
they will lose both. Its only remaining
game will be versus No. I California,
so two wins would almost definitely
put the Cardinal into the No. 2 spot for
the NC'AAs (Nov. 27-29). To make the
championships at all, Stanford must
remain in the top five. Only five of the
nation's top 10 teams will be invited to
the NCAA tournament, so that teams
from regions outside California can be
accomodated.
Despite the precarious position the
Cardinal holds now, and despite the
precarious position his Trojans could
find themselves in if they to lose to
Irvine today and Stanford tomorrow,
USC Coach John Williams does not be

lieve any of the top five teams need be
too nervous about dropping out of the
top five.
"1 don't think there's a problem with
Stanford or USC being close to not
making the tournament," Williams
said. "I think we're fighting for
seeding. . . . There's little doubt that
California is going to be ranked No. I.
If we are ranked No. 2, we'll draw an
Eastern team (in the first round): other
wise we'll have to face someone like
Stanford or Irvine."
As always, Stanford will be hoping
to find renewed scoring ability in its of
fense and will depend on its defense to
keep the games close. That shot
making excellence the offense proved
it had early in the season (but which
has since gone into hibernation) did
come out of its cave once last weekend
to test the waters, only to return to its
lair. In that one game, against Pep
perdine Sunday morning, the Cardinal
won 11-9.
Although Pepperdine is weak
defensively, it is also a team that
defeated USC the day before.
Both UCLA and Stanford lost to
Irvine last weekend, so there is little to
indicate that one team is likely to win
this afternoon. UCLA visited Stanford
Oct. 3 and defeated the Cardinal, 7-5.
At Irvine Sept. 19, however, the Cardi
nal topped the Bruins 7-6. According to
Bruin sophomore Alex Rousseau, al
though UCLA will have a hometown
crowd behind it, the more particular
Southern California officiating means
that UCLA will have to use something
other than fouling to stop Stanford star
Erich Fischer — a definite plus for the
Cardinal.

"I don't think the home advantage
will have a lot to do with it. . . . [The
refereeing] will be a factor; Fischer will
get paid off more often when he's
fouled," Rousseau said. "If we play
like we did (at Stanford), we should
win. . . . Definitely we have to shut
down Fischer and a couple other guys.
Jeff Oeding s a good player, and
Andrew Lawson, also."
In the time since Rousseau last faced
Stanford — when it was Oeding and
Lawson who followed Fischer in goal
scoring — seniors Matt Tingler and
Grant Stanley have risen to the chief
supporting roles in actual goal produc
tion Tingler said that better shot selec
tion and better shooting were behind
the improvement in both himself and
Stanley.
Fischer remains the main man.
though, with 49 goals. Tingler and
Stanley have 22 each. To highlight
Stafford's scoring troubles, you only
have to mention that two players, Fis
cher and the now-graduated Craig
klass, each had 87 (yes, K7) goals last
year.
USC s Williams, like most coaches,
considers his team's main enemy to be
itself. He said the Trojans' major prob
lem has been inconsistency, something
the present situation does not allow
for. "I have cautioned (the players)
that one loss can knock us down to
fifth."
USC's 6-4 win over Stanford in
deGuerre Pool Oct. 17 was its first
defeat of the Cardinal in three years. It
was a game Stanford felt it should have
won Sophomore Steve Millham said.

Jon Swerdloff is in his first year as a starter on the Cardinal water polo team, which has
slipped to No. 5 in the country, its lowest national ranking in two years.
"We outplayed them in every
aspect of the game except getting
down to the final thing and put
ting the hall away."
In the wake of last weekend's
play, Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti still could not pinpoint
why the Cardinal does not find
the back of the cage more often.
"Who knows? I wish I knew. I'd
bottle it and sell it."
Tingler said although he espe
cially wants to beat UCLA, nei
ther the UCLA game nor the
USC game can be given more im
portance than the other. "Both
will be extremely difficult
games," Tingler said. "They are
pretty similar teams. They both
have a lot of size, and they both
have good two-meter men. We
have to take it to them early and
then stay ahead."
