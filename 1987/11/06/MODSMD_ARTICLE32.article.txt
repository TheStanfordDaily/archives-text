## 
### David Earnest Staff writer 
In its home debut this weekend, the
Stanford women's tennis team hosts
the Rolex Northern California Col
legiate Tennis Championships — Divi
sion I.
The tournament, which runs today
through Sunday, will determine
qualifiers for the 1988 Rolex National
Indoor Intercollegiate Championships
in February.
The defending national champion
Cardinal has entered nine players in
this weekend's field of 64, including six
of the eight seeds. Doubles action will
feature four Stanford pairings, includ
ing two of the four seeds.
Stanford freshman Tami Whitlinger
is the tournament's No. I seed after an
impressive debut last weekend at the
Ail-American Championships at
Myrtle Beach, S.C. Playing in her first
collegiate tournament, Whitlinger
knocked off top seed Shaun Stafford of
Florida, last season's NCAA singles
runner-up. Despite being a wild card
player at the All-American Champion
ships, Whitlinger was selected as this
weekend's top seed because of her im
pressive performance.
Other Stanford players fill five of the
remaining seven seeds. Junior Eleni
Rossides and sophomore Lisa Green,
No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, are two
of Stanford's other top players. Fresh
man Sandra Birch (No. 4), senior Kay
Tittle (No. 7) and freshman Teri
Whitlinger (No. 8), Tami's twin sister,
round out the other seeded Stanford
players. Jean Marie Lozano and Karen

Shin, both of California, are the fifth
and sixth seeds, respectively.
The remaining team members will
play in unseeded slots. Cari Hagey and
Valerie Wilson are in the upper bracket
with teammates Rossides and Green,
while Cindy Buchsbaum will compete
in the lower bracket with the
Whitlingers, Birch and Tittle.

The duo of Tami and Teri Whitlinger
highlight the doubles competition as
the No. 1 seeded team. The two fresh
men will be joined by the pairing of
Tittle and Birch, the third doubles
seed. The teams of Lozano/Alissa
Finerman and Tiffany Silveria/Sharon
Fletcher, both from California, are the
No. 2 and No. 4 seeds, respectively.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan is
looking foward to this weekend's com
petition. "This is a breaking-the-ice
kind of tournament. Not only does this
kick off our season, but we get a
chance to see our regional rivals," he
said.
He said he is most eagerly awaiting
the competition between Stanford and
Cal, two of the preseason's top five
teams. "I also get to see the styles of
the new players," he added.
Brennan also pointed out that in this
tournament, players get to play "out of

position," meaning that a team's
fourth-ranked player will not necessar
ily be paired with an opposing team's
fourth-ranked draw. "It's an opportu
nity for our lower numbered players to
play against other teams' top players.
They get to show how good they really
are," ne said.
The 64 players in the tournament
represent teams from all over Northern
California. Players from Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo, Santa Clara, San Jose
State, Pacific, University of San Fran
cisco and Fresno State will take part in
the competition.
The Northern California tournament
is only one of 17 such regional cham
pionships being played this weekend.
In addition to the Division I tourna
ments, Rolex is sponsoring 15 small
college regional championships. Over
2000 players from 600 schools will be
competing for berths at the 1988 Rolex
National Indoor Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships.
Nine regional men's tournaments
and eight women's events are being
held this weekend. The winners and
finalists of each singles tournament, as
well as the doubles winners of each
tournament, will qualify to compete in
the national tournament, to be played
in Minneapolis Feb. 4-7, 1988.
Play gets underway today at 8 a.m.
at the Varsity Tennis Courts, with
second round action beginning this af
ternoon. Third and fourth round action

feature four Stanford pairings, includ
ing two of the four seeds.
Stanford freshman Tami Whitlinger
is the tournament's No. I seed after an
impressive debut last weekend at the
Ail-American Championships at
Myrtle Beach, S.C. Playing in her first
collegiate tournament, Whitlinger
knocked off top seed Shaun Stafford of
Florida, last season's NCAA singles
runner-up. Despite being a wild card
player at the All-American Champion
ships, Whitlinger was selected as this
weekend's top seed because of her im
pressive performance.
Other Stanford players fill five of the
remaining seven seeds. Junior Eleni
Rossides and sophomore Lisa Green,
No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, are two
of Stanford's other top players. Fresh
man Sandra Birch (No. 4), senior Kay
Tittle (No. 7) and freshman Teri
Whitlinger (No. 8), Tami's twin sister,
round out the other seeded Stanford
players. Jean Marie Lozano and Karen

Shin, both of California, are the fifth
and sixth seeds, respectively.
The remaining team members will
play in unseeded slots. Cari Hagey and
Valerie Wilson are in the upper bracket
with teammates Rossides and Green,
while Cindy Buchsbaum will compete
in the lower bracket with the
Whitlingers, Birch and Tittle.

The duo of Tami and Teri Whitlinger
highlight the doubles competition as
the No. 1 seeded team. The two fresh
men will be joined by the pairing of
Tittle and Birch, the third doubles
seed. The teams of Lozano/Alissa
Finerman and Tiffany Silveria/Sharon
Fletcher, both from California, are the
No. 2 and No. 4 seeds, respectively.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan is
looking foward to this weekend's com
petition. "This is a breaking-the-ice
kind of tournament. Not only does this
kick off our season, but we get a
chance to see our regional rivals," he
said.
He said he is most eagerly awaiting
the competition between Stanford and
Cal, two of the preseason's top five
teams. "I also get to see the styles of
the new players," he added.
Brennan also pointed out that in this
tournament, players get to play "out of

position," meaning that a team's
fourth-ranked player will not necessar
ily be paired with an opposing team's
fourth-ranked draw. "It's an opportu
nity for our lower numbered players to
play against other teams' top players.
They get to show how good they really
are," ne said.
The 64 players in the tournament
represent teams from all over Northern
California. Players from Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo, Santa Clara, San Jose
State, Pacific, University of San Fran
cisco and Fresno State will take part in
the competition.

ments, Rolex is sponsoring 15 small
college regional championships. Over
2000 players from 600 schools will be

Championships.
Nine regional men's tournaments
and eight women's events are being
held this weekend. The winners and
finalists of each singles tournament, as
well as the doubles winners of each
tournament, will qualify to compete in
the national tournament, to be played
in Minneapolis Feb. 4-7, 1988.
