# Men's soccer hosts own version of Big Game
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Big Game time has arrived for
the Stanford men s soccer team.
The Cardinal hosts cross-bay
rival California Sunday. And
though the spectator hype that
surrounds the football matchup is
non-existent, the spirit and emo
tion created from clashes on the
gridiron most definitely carry
over to the soccer field.
In addition to the prestige at
stake in the annual contest, Stan
ford is also battling for a winning
record and looks to gain in the
league standings. Sporting an 8-
8-3 overall record and a 2-2 con
ference tally with two games to
go, the Cardinal hopes to finish
above .500. The squad would
also like to finish above the Bears
in the Pacific Soccer Conference
standings. The teams are cur
rently tied.
Even without the traditional
rivalry, Cal would not be an op
ponent to take lightly. Although
it is a young squad that starts
four to six freshmen and has no
seniors, the Bears have a 9-7-4
record and won the Florida Invi
tational Tournament earlier in
the season. According to Stan
ford Asst. Coach Hunter Stern,
the Bears are not an excellent
squad, but they play in spurts,
during which they can be very
potent. And, unlike the Cardinal.
Cal has momentum on its side,
coming off a 3-0 victory over St.

Mary's.
The Bears are led by sopho
more forward Brad Larson and
sophomore fullback Peter
Woodring. Sophomore midfield
er Bruce Weisenberg is another
potential threat up front. All
three are good offensive
playmakers whom Stanford
needs to control.
"They're a good all-around
team," Stanford Coach Sam
Koch said. "They work very
hard."
Coming off a 2-0 loss to Santa
Clara last weekend, the Cardinal
has been working on tightening
up its defense. The team has also
been practicing the combination
pass, switching fields and the
quick counter to create more
shooting opportunities.
Stanford's strategy today will
be to try to bring the ball down
the outsides of the field to draw
the Cal sweeper out of position
and attack in the space created
behind him.
The squad is also counting on
sophomore midfielder Chris
Porch to carry the offense. If
Porch, the leading Cardinal
scorer, is double-teamed, either
Brian Mahaffey, Pat Sheehy,
lim Westergren, Mike Mossmer
or Luke Garrot will be able to
come down the other sideline un
apprehended. And if Porch is not
singled out, he may provide an
offensive threat.
The past three years the home
squad has won the contest. Last

season the Bears were victorious
3-1 when the game was held in
Berkeley. The Cardinal won 3-1
in 1985, and Cal prevailed in
1984. Aside from the quality of
the teams, Koch feels the differ
ence in playing surfaces will have
an effect on the outcome of the
match. Stanford is accustomed to
competing on grass, and Cal is
more used to Astroturf.
"Playing on grass and at home
should be real beneficial for us,'
Koch said.
The emotion and hype of the
contest should also be a factor in
the outcome. A team can give it
self an advantage if it is able to
make the high spirits of the
matchup productive.
"The team that can utilize the
psyche and hype to gain opportu
nities to score usually wins,"
Stern said.
Koch feels the Cardinal is
definitely ready to play. After de
feating three nationally ranked
squads and winning the Pacific
West Soccer Classic earlier in the
season, the team is not willing to
give up after losses to weaker,
unheralded opponents.
"The whole team wants to
finish on the right note," Koch
said. "They really want to win
this one for the seniors."
A victory over Cal would be
especially sweet for the seniors
in light of last year's disappoint
ing 6-11-4 overall record and 1-4-
1 conference record (fifth place).
