# Will the Trojans break under the pressure?
## 
### 
We admit it. Its tacky.
This week's Guest Greek is
junior Jeff Hagan, co-director of
the University's Contraceptive
Information Center.
An expert, as it were, on
Trojans.
So we posed the all-important
question oft heard around the
Pac-10 — do Trojans really burst
under pressure?
No, no, no. Not that kind of
Trojan. The other kind.
"Oh, they're going to burst un
der pressure," Hagan said.
"Stanford's going to explode and
shred their whole front line."
There you have it. From some
one who deals with Trojans
every day.
The Contraceptive Informa
tion Center is a student-run or
ganization that provides free and
confidential counseling about
pregnancy tests, abortion and
adoption, STD's and. of course,
contraceptives.

The San Francisco native
picked Georgia because "I like
their mascot" and predicts
UCLA will triumph "because
they've been kicking butt left and
right."
Meanwhile, sports editor Matt
Hodman is being heavily chal
lenged by Card Today editor
Chris Crader.
Sports editor Rob Portnoy
continues to languish in last
place, but promises if he doesn't
have a flood week, he'll choose
by coin flip the next time around.
Let's take a moment to flash
back to a year ago in Greekdom,
when managing editor Ken
Stevens, then a sports editor, had
a two-game lead on fellow editor
Susan Slusser with three weeks
to go. Stevens proceeded to blow
the lead and take a blow to his
pride, relinquishing a lead he had
guaranteed in Namath-like fash
ion would not disappear.
