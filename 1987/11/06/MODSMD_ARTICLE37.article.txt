Graduate students interested in be
coming professors received advice yes
terday from an array of professors and
administrators on what qualifications
are considered important by academic
search committees.
The panel included department
heads as well as associate deans and
provosts, all of whom participate in ac
ademic job searches.
"[Educational institutions] look, of
course, for a fine intelligence. What's
also important is intellectual flexibility.
You may be called on to teach courses
outside your specialty," said English
Prof. Ron Rebholz.
"They are also looking for teaching
experience of a very high quality, as
well as professional activities: what ar
ticles you submit . . . papers that you

give, even within your own depart
ment," Rebholz said.
"Being known in your school is an
important thing," said Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Jim Plummer, director of
the University's Integrated Circuits
Lab.
"Often the people on the committee
get on the phone and ask colleagues,
'Who are the best graduate students
you have?' And search committees will
then recruit them and ask them to ap
ply," Plummer said.
Plummer added that the preparation
of application documents is very im
portant. "Once your papers go beyond
the department level, they'll be
reviewed by the provost and higher
levels," he said.
"They won't know who you are at
that point, so it's very important
what's written in there. They pay at-

tention especially to letters of recom
mendation from people in the field," he
said.
James Walsh, associate dean of the
School of Social Sciences at San Jose
State, said that "your resume ought to
reflect that position being asked for.
"You should write down what you
think is going to get you an interview,
provided that it's true," Walsh said.
"If you are a member of a minority
group that is not adequately repre
sented, then you may want to identify
yourself," he said.
Donald Kirk, associate dean of
Graduate Studies and Research at San
Jose State, stressed the importance of
the on-campus interview. "You will be
invited to give a seminar. You must
show that your research is deep and
that you can explain anything to
anybody," he said.
