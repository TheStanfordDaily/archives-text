A "secret government" supported by
the United States might be working to
topple the rule of Philippine President
Corazon Aquino, a Filipino newspaper
editor said here yesterday.
According to Rosario Garcellano, ed
itorial page editor of the Manila Stan
dard, U.S. military attaches were
spotted mingling with rebels dur ing last
month's attempted military coup.
Garcellano, a Knight Journalism Fel
low here, said the United States may
have secretly installed nuclear weapons
at its two air bases in the Philippines.
She said that because the Aquino gov
ernment wants to close the two bases
and strongly opposes having U.S. nu
clear weapons installed there, the U.S.
government might want a change of
government in the Philippines.
Garcellano said the February, 1986
election that ousted Ferdinand Marcos
and catapulted Aquino to power was
only a a first step "on the tortuous path
to the goal of national self
determination." Marcos' downfall
represents "a battle won, but not the
solution" to the problems of the
Filipino people, she said.
According to Garcellano, the new
democratic government has wavered
under class conflict and external pres

sures and has tailed to act decisively,
which has meant that most of the prob
lems that beset the Philippines under
Marcos still remain.
The great disparity between the rich
and the poor, the lack of agrarian
reform, the ambivalence of the military,
the communist threat and the continued
interference by multinational compan
ies are just some of the factors that
might bring down Aquino's govern
ment, she said.
Garcellano said Aquino is "immo
bilized by the struggle to survive." She
added that Salvador Laurel, until
recently Aquino's vice president, is
waiting in the wings ready to launch a
constitutional coup at the right mo
ment. Laurel has been quoted as
saying, "I'm only a heartbeat away
from power," Garcellano said.
U.S. intervention in the internal af
fairs of the Philippines has complicated
matters tremendously, Garcellano said,
adding that it is possible that the U.S.
government may be manipulating the
situation for its own interests.
When asked what the Filipino people
would do if the United States were to
stop interfering in Filipino affairs. Gar
cellano said. "Hopefully, we could pull
ourselves up by our bootstraps and
start from scratch and maybe reach
square one."
