## Grape growers assail MEChA 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Charging MEChA students
and the United Farm Workers
Union with "hypocrisy" in their
efforts to promote a statewide
grape boycott, a spokesman for
the Grape Workers and Farmers
Coalition claimed that former
MEChA member Rudy Fuentes
last year blocked the presenta
tion of information criticizing the
boycott.
In a letter to The Daily, Adam
Ortega wrote that Fuentes, then
a junior, promised to distribute
copies of an informational packet
containing arguments against the
boycott to each of the ASSU
senators before the ASSU Senate
voted in May to boycott grapes at
the University. Ortega wrote that
Fuentes did not make the packets
available.
"Those who are promoting the

grape boycott at Stanford have
done everything in their power to
block this information from the
students and their responsible
representatives," Ortega said.
Fuentes, however, said that he
distributed the packets to the
senators prior to the meeting and
that it was Ortega who was "a bit
confused."
"I presented both sides,"
Fuentes said. Ortega attended
the ASSU meeting to argue
against the grape boycott. Ac
cording to Fuentes, however, Or
tega avoided the subject of pes
ticides.
Ortega wrote that boycott
proponents "have a tendency to
exaggerate and mislead people.
There is not one case reported
where people have died or been
injured by eating grapes."
MEChA has implemented a
plan this quarter to educate Stanford
students about the dangers of pes
ticides in the agricultural industry. This
came in response to another ASSU
Senate resolution last month to boycott
grapes at the University.
Ortega said he opposes the UFW's
grape boycott because the boycott
"never had anything specifically to do
with grapes. The UFW is tooling
people by telling them it does.
"Their boycott is a boycott looking

for a cause, Ortega said. "It is politi
cal. When the UFW did not get the
troops to rally their cause, they turned
to grapes."
According to Fuentes, grapes were
chosen as the target of the pesticide
campaign because "in the past grape
boycotts have teen successful, be
cause grapes is one of the crops that
uses the most pesticides and because
grapes have the most reported health
effects.
"We are trying to get a policy imple
mented and to improve working condi
tions," Fuentes said. "It's a case ot a
non-traditional group — the union —
trying to impact the government to
make regulations by using pressure.'

Ortega argued that when the grape
boycott began in 1984, the UFW
"made no mention of pesticides or can
cer clusters in their resolution. It was
not until a year later, in 1985, after
highly publicized incidents of tainted
cheese and watermelon that the union
raised the issue."
According to Fuentes, Ortega's ar
gument is an attempt to avoid the issue
of cancer-causing pesticides. "There is
something there. There is something
wrong, or Ortega wouldn't stay away
from (the issue of) pesticides," he said.
Fuentes said that more extensive re
search about the dangers of pesticides
needs to be instigated.
