## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
The membership of six of
seven Stanford officials named as
belonging to San Francisco's
controversial Bohemian Club
was confirmed yesterday, and
three said they have no plans to
leave the club despite calls that
Stanford dissolve all links with
the exclusive, all-male organiza
tion.
Three Stanford administrators
and faculty members told The
Daily yesterday they belong to
the club, and the membership of
three others was confirmed by
family members and a report in
the San Jose Mercury News.
The seven were named as
being on the club's closely
guarded membership list Wed
nesday by a coalition of student
groups, the United Stanford
Workers and the Service
Employees International Union
L.ocal 2. The service employees
union has alleged that the club
treats its workers unfairly.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
said yesterday that he joined the
club in 1980 or 1981 but left the
group last year, contrary to the
union's claim. "1 have not been a
member for a lonÂ« time,"' Geiger
said, adding that ne "left over a
year ago for personal reasons."
Hut William Shockley, profes

sor emeritus of engineering, said
he is "satisfied with the club."
Shockley said that although the
club may conduct "improper ac
tivities, 1 have other interests, so
I am not going to pursue any im
proprieties."
Engineering Prof. Holt Ashley
and University Vice President for
Public Affairs Robert Freelen
both said they were generally
content with the club. Both said
they were not well enough in
formed to become involved in the
labor issue.
Freelen and Ashley said they
were unaware of any discrimina
tory practices involving workers
at the club.
The University came under
fire Wednesday when represen
tatives of the ASSU and
MEChA, a Latino student organ
ization. joined union officials in
charging that the Bohemian Club
has secret ties with Stanford.
Both club officials and campus
club members denied the allega
tions.
The other three Stanford offi
cials in the club were unavailable
for comment yesterday. They are
Arjay Miller, dean emeritus of
the Graduate School of Business;
Richard Staar, director of the in
ternational studies program at
the Hoover Institution; and Busi
ness Prof. William Miller.
