# Rich: The personal is political
## Poet reads from works 
### Patsy Mickens 
English and Feminist Studies Prof. Adrienne
Rich urged students to "become makers and not
the consumers of the historical process" at a
reading of her poetry here last night.
Rich, a well-known poet, spoke before an over
flow crowd of over I(K) at the Sterling Quad Dining
and Performance Center.
Rich said that in a society where our minds are
"saturated" with heterosexual ideas and "erotic
love between women is taboo and persecuted, the
personal is the political."
Rich began by reading some of her earliest
poems, written when she was a 20-year-old college
student, and ended with some poems from her most
recent book. "Your Native Land, Your Life."
"Poetry makes human existence more possible,
more livable." said Rich. "It has been the primary
tool for understanding my life and the changes I
have gone through."
Prof. Albert Gelpi, chair of the English Depart
ment, introduced Rich and said she "uses language
to describe the alienation, disjunction, failed rela
tionships and failed communication in our lives."
He said language is "an encounter â€” an act of
recognition, relation and community."
Rich's talk was sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau and the Institute for Research on
Women and Gender.
