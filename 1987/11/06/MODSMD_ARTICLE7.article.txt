# Voting machines introduced
## ASSU automates election 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
Preparations are going well for the
ASSU autumn quarter special election,
which will feature automatic voting
machines, according to Elections Com
missioner Steve Baer.
"We want to make it good. We want
to make it fair," Baer said.
Scheduled for Nov. 17 and IS, the
elections seek to till 13 empty graduate
senate seats and three seats on the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC).
The November ballot could include
up to 10 referenda issues, which are
being written by student organizations
and the ASSU.
After considerable debate, the ASSU
Senate earlier this quarter voted to con
tract the use of voting machines from
the Santa Clara County Registrar of
Voters. The machines will cost the
ASSU an estimated $5300.
"We like to think of it as a long-term
investment," said ASSU Administra
tive Manager Jack Ottoway. "It cost a

little more than what we would have
liked, hut I think in the long run it'll he
worth it."
Much of the cost applies toward one
time programming charges to adapt the
machines to Stanford elections, Ot
toway said. According to John Mol
chan. assistant registrar of Santa Clara
County, the expenses for future use of
the machines are "likely to he less."
Molchan said that "the University
welcomed the idea of computer-tallied
voting" and that Stanford may he the
first major university in the area to try
this method.
"If it'll assist the University in the
conduct of elections, it's a great idea,"
he added.
Council of Presidents member Jim
Durkin, who worked with the county to
obtain the machines, said the ASSU
wanted to avoid the "fiasco" that oc
curred in last spring's general election.
That election was marred by prob
lems that resulted in less-than-accurate
ballot counts and forced the election to
be repeated.
