## DATELINE 
### 
Stocks surge as interest rates fall
Aided by tumbling interest rates worldwide, the stock market
reversed a two-day slide and staged a broad rally yesterday,
with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 40.12 points.
The 2.1 percent gain, which took the Dow to a close of
1985.41, sparked renewed optimism among analysts that confi
dence was returning to the market following last month s his
toric crash. Some said the current rebound could take the Dow
well over the 2000 mark in the next few days.
However, some analysts noted, yesterday's gain came
despite a further plunge in the dollar. The weakening greenback,
along with the persistent federal budget deficit and the threat of
a recession, could hinder any sustained gains in stocks in the
next few months, analysts said. The long-term outlook is still
quite treacherous, they said, as investors remain cautious in the
aftermath of the 1000-point fall in the Dow average between
Aug. 25 and Black Monday Oct. 19.
"This is a good short-term rally . . . but we're still in a bear
market" and prices could test the Oct. 19 low in the months
ahead, said Stan Weinstein, editor of the Professional Tape
Reader, a Hollywood, Fla., market newsletter. He said inves
tors should view rallies such as this one as opportunities to sell,
not to buy.
South Africa releases ANC activist
PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa — Govan Mbeki, a former
president of the outlawed African National Congress and a
prominent figure in the black struggle to overturn white rule in
South Africa, was released from prison yesterday after serving
23 years of a life sentence for treason.
The dramatic release of Mbeki, with four other black
militants, immediately touched off speculation that Pretoria was
testing the reaction among white South Africans to the eventual
freeing of imprisoned ANC leaders Nelson Mandela and Walter
Sisulu. They are serving life sentences imposed at the same 1964
trial at which Mbeki was convicted.
The government of President Pieter Botha also was believed
to be concerned that Mbeki, 77, Mandela, 69, and Sisulu, 75,
might die in prison, becoming martyrs to the black cause and
sparking further violence.
Although the government offered no explanation for its deci
sion, reform-minded senior officials have said in recent months
that they believed it was important that Pretoria try to break
through black militants' mistrust of South African motives and
establish interracial dialogue.
Stoffel van der Merwe, deputy minister for constitutional
planning and a leading proponent of negotiations on black-white
power sharing, said in an interview in September that he re
garded the ANC as a major player in any such talks.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Red
man said the United States welcomed Mbeki's release, and he
urged South African blacks and whites to use the opportunity
"to create a climate for dialogue."
CIA official under criminal probe
WASHINGTON — Prosecutors in the Iran-contra probe,
widening their inquiry to include officials still working at the
CIA, have notified a senior agency official involved in Latin
American affairs that he is a subject of a criminal investigation,
the Los Angeles Times learned yesterday.
CIA officials have consistently denied any broad agency role
in secret efforts by former National Security Council aide Oliver
North to support the Nicaraguan rebels.
But the notification, issued to Alan Fiers Jr., chief of the
ClA's Central American task force, means prosecutors have
found evidence indicating that Fiers was involved in conduct
that "is within the scope" of a grand jury investigating the Iran
contra affair.
He is not currently a target for criminal indictment, however,
government sources said.
The notification was given within the last week when Fiers in
sisted on knowing his "status," before submitting to question
ing by attorneys on the staff of independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh, according to the sources who refused to be identified.
A CIA spokesman refused to comment, and Fiers' attorney,
Anthony Lapham, a former CIA general counsel, did not return
a reporter's calls. But it was learned that Fiers is continuing to
occupy his sensitive CIA post, in which he manages the
agency's clandestine support to the contras and other covert
Central America operations.
Weinberger gives farewell warning
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
officially submitted his resignation to President Reagan yester
day and issued a farewell warning that adequate funding for a
strong national defense must not take a back seat to reduction of
the federal budget deficit.
Reagan announced at a White House ceremony that he will
nominate national security adviser Frank Carlucci to be secre
tary of defense and will promote Army Lt. Gen. Colin Powell,
Carlucci's deputy, to replace him. Weinberger will remain in of
fice until his successor is ready to take over.
Weinberger said he is resigning because he wants to spend
more time with his wife, Jane, who has been treated for cancer
and has been in pain after breaking several bones in her back in
a recent accident. The secretary said that he regretted leaving at
a time when military strength may be threatened by budget
cutting negotiations between the White House and Congress.
"I'm more worried about leaving the budget situation the way
it is than anything else," he said at a Pentagon news conference.
"That's the thing that bothers me most."
At a Rose Garden ceremony, Reagan praised Weinberger, his
longtime friend, as "the finest secretary of defense in the history
of our nation" whose "cool and sure judgment" will be greatly
missed.
U.S. and Spain face off over bases
MADRID, Spain — The United States and Spain have
reached a showdown in their drawn-out talks over Spanish
demands for a substantial reduction of U.S. military forces in
Spain.
Despite a last-minute concession from the Reagan administra
tion, Spanish officials said the seventh round of negotiations
that opened yesterday is unlikely to produce agreement. As a
result, Spain has resolved to give formal notification on
schedule next week that it intends to abrogate a 34-year-old ac
cord governing U.S. military bases here, they added.
"A new horizon is opening," a ranking Spanish official said.
The notification means negotiators have only six months
before the treaty expires May 14 and a one-year pullout period
begins for the approximately 12,000 U.S. military personnel in
Spain. Officials from both sides have gone out of their way to
avoid dramatizing the step, but at the same time they appear to
be counting on such brinksmanship to break the impasse before
May.

dence was returning to the market following last month s his
toric crash. Some said the current rebound could take the Dow
well over the 2000 mark in the next few days.
However, some analysts noted, yesterday's gain came
despite a further plunge in the dollar. The weakening greenback,
along with the persistent federal budget deficit and the threat of
a recession, could hinder any sustained gains in stocks in the
next few months, analysts said. The long-term outlook is still
quite treacherous, they said, as investors remain cautious in the
aftermath of the 1000-point fall in the Dow average between
Aug. 25 and Black Monday Oct. 19.
"This is a good short-term rally . . . but we're still in a bear
market" and prices could test the Oct. 19 low in the months
ahead, said Stan Weinstein, editor of the Professional Tape
Reader, a Hollywood, Fla., market newsletter. He said inves
tors should view rallies such as this one as opportunities to sell,
not to buy.
South Africa releases ANC activist
PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa — Govan Mbeki, a former
president of the outlawed African National Congress and a
prominent figure in the black struggle to overturn white rule in
South Africa, was released from prison yesterday after serving
23 years of a life sentence for treason.
The dramatic release of Mbeki, with four other black
militants, immediately touched off speculation that Pretoria was
testing the reaction among white South Africans to the eventual
freeing of imprisoned ANC leaders Nelson Mandela and Walter
Sisulu. They are serving life sentences imposed at the same 1964
trial at which Mbeki was convicted.
The government of President Pieter Botha also was believed
to be concerned that Mbeki, 77, Mandela, 69, and Sisulu, 75,
might die in prison, becoming martyrs to the black cause and
sparking further violence.
Although the government offered no explanation for its deci
sion, reform-minded senior officials have said in recent months
that they believed it was important that Pretoria try to break
through black militants' mistrust of South African motives and
establish interracial dialogue.
Stoffel van der Merwe, deputy minister for constitutional
planning and a leading proponent of negotiations on black-white
power sharing, said in an interview in September that he re
garded the ANC as a major player in any such talks.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Red
man said the United States welcomed Mbeki's release, and he
urged South African blacks and whites to use the opportunity
"to create a climate for dialogue."
CIA official under criminal probe
WASHINGTON — Prosecutors in the Iran-contra probe,
widening their inquiry to include officials still working at the
CIA, have notified a senior agency official involved in Latin
American affairs that he is a subject of a criminal investigation,
the Los Angeles Times learned yesterday.
CIA officials have consistently denied any broad agency role
in secret efforts by former National Security Council aide Oliver
North to support the Nicaraguan rebels.
But the notification, issued to Alan Fiers Jr., chief of the
ClA's Central American task force, means prosecutors have
found evidence indicating that Fiers was involved in conduct
that "is within the scope" of a grand jury investigating the Iran
contra affair.
He is not currently a target for criminal indictment, however,
government sources said.
The notification was given within the last week when Fiers in
sisted on knowing his "status," before submitting to question
ing by attorneys on the staff of independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh, according to the sources who refused to be identified.
A CIA spokesman refused to comment, and Fiers' attorney,
Anthony Lapham, a former CIA general counsel, did not return
a reporter's calls. But it was learned that Fiers is continuing to
occupy his sensitive CIA post, in which he manages the
agency's clandestine support to the contras and other covert
Central America operations.
Weinberger gives farewell warning
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
officially submitted his resignation to President Reagan yester
day and issued a farewell warning that adequate funding for a
strong national defense must not take a back seat to reduction of
the federal budget deficit.
Reagan announced at a White House ceremony that he will
nominate national security adviser Frank Carlucci to be secre
tary of defense and will promote Army Lt. Gen. Colin Powell,
Carlucci's deputy, to replace him. Weinberger will remain in of
fice until his successor is ready to take over.
Weinberger said he is resigning because he wants to spend
more time with his wife, Jane, who has been treated for cancer
and has been in pain after breaking several bones in her back in
a recent accident. The secretary said that he regretted leaving at
a time when military strength may be threatened by budget
cutting negotiations between the White House and Congress.
"I'm more worried about leaving the budget situation the way
it is than anything else," he said at a Pentagon news conference.
"That's the thing that bothers me most."
At a Rose Garden ceremony, Reagan praised Weinberger, his
longtime friend, as "the finest secretary of defense in the history
of our nation" whose "cool and sure judgment" will be greatly
missed.
U.S. and Spain face off over bases
MADRID, Spain — The United States and Spain have
reached a showdown in their drawn-out talks over Spanish
demands for a substantial reduction of U.S. military forces in
Spain.
Despite a last-minute concession from the Reagan administra
tion, Spanish officials said the seventh round of negotiations
that opened yesterday is unlikely to produce agreement. As a
result, Spain has resolved to give formal notification on
schedule next week that it intends to abrogate a 34-year-old ac
cord governing U.S. military bases here, they added.
"A new horizon is opening," a ranking Spanish official said.
The notification means negotiators have only six months
before the treaty expires May 14 and a one-year pullout period
begins for the approximately 12,000 U.S. military personnel in
Spain. Officials from both sides have gone out of their way to
avoid dramatizing the step, but at the same time they appear to
be counting on such brinksmanship to break the impasse before
May.

Stocks surge as interest rates fall
