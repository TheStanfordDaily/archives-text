# Law students make demands
## Discrimination policy at issue 
### Scott Renshaw Staff writer 
A group of Stanford law students has submitted a
list of demands to the dean of the Law School ask
ing for a re-evaluation of the school's non
discrimination policy, according to a member of the
group.
Scott Doering, a third year law school student
and ASSU graduate senator, said the Multicultural
Council, a coalition of representatives from ethnic
minority, women's, lesbian and gay groups at the
Law School, submitted a list of demands to Law
School Dean Paul Brest last Friday in response to
recent controversy involving the application of the
school's non-discrimination policy to companies al
legedly engaged in discriminatory employment
practices. Affirmative action hiring of law school
faculty was also addressed in the demands.
' We'd like to see some sort of sanctions policy in
place" that would restrict on-campus recruiting of
companies engaged in discriminatory practices,
Doering said. The current non-discrimination policy
states that the Law School "makes its facilities
available only to employers who do not dis
criminate'" on any basis. However, a number of
disputes regarding implementation of that policy
have come up in recent weeks.
The current controversy began when the law
school permitted on-campus recruiting by the law
firm of Baker and McKenzie, which is currently
being sued by a former employee who claims he
was fired because he has AIDS.
Doering said the letter to Brest includes a demand
that the non-discrimination policy apply not just to
discrimination in on-campus interviews, but also to
"anything (the companies) say or do off campus."
Critics have assailed the school's present policy
for its failure to state whether off-campus discrimi
nation should result in the loss of a company's
recruitment privileges.
Regarding the Law School's recent decision to al
low the Central Intelligence Agency to speak on
campus, Doering said, "We hope (the sanctions)
will apply not just to interviewing facilities, but to
all other facilities of the Law School."
The Law School has barred the CIA from on
campus recruiting because it discriminates in hiring
on the basis of sexual orientation.
Addressing another of the group's demands,
Doering said affirmative action should be imple
mented more in faculty hiring.
"We'd like to see more diversity in the visiting
faculty," Doering said, noting
that all the current visiting fac
ulty members are "white males
and, as far as we know,
straight." He said the council
suggested that three-fourths of
next year's visiting faculty
should be minorities.
In addition to the actual hiring,
Doering said, "We'd like to see a
statement of policy to tie with
it."
"This would be an appropriate
time to take a positive step,'' said
Doering.
Law Professor William Gould
said he was unable to speak as a
representative of the Law
School, but noted the law faculty
"has been too long deficient in
minority representation."
