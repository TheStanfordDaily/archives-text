## 
### 
JERUSALEM — In an appar
ent attempt to influence an Arab
summit meeting in Jordan, the
Abu Nidal Palestinian terrorist
group announced in Beirut yes
terday that it had seized a
French-registered yacht in the
Mediterranean and was holding
as hostages its eight passengers,
who are believed to be Israelis.
Walid Khaled, identified as
one of the leaders of the infa
mous guerrilla faction, an
nounced the action at a hastily
called news conference in the
Moslem half of the divided
Lebanese capital and warned
that if Israel retaliates, the
captives' "lives will be in dan
ger."
He called the hijacking a
"slap" at Jordan's King Hussein
and warned Arab leaders meeting
in Amman to make no decisions
that would give the monarch the

right to represent the Palestinians
in negotiations with Israel.
Khaled said that the hostages,
captured off the coast of the
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, in
clude six adults and two children.
Five of the adults hold Belgian as
well as Israeli passports, and one
is a French-Israeli dual-national,
the Palestinian said. From the
names read by Khaled, it ap
peared that there were three men
and three women.
Khaled identified the five
Belgian-Israeli hostages as Fer
nand Houtekins, 40; Emmanuel
Houtekins, 42; Godlieve Kets;
Valerie Emmanuel Houtekins,
16, and Laurent Emmanual
Houtekins, 17. He identified the
French-Israeli woman as Jac
queline Valente, 30. He did not
give the childrens' names or
nationalities, but said they spoke
Hebrew.

Khaled identified the hijacked
yacht as the Silco, a 17-ton 40-
footer, and said that the group
would provide more information
"once we are through with the
investigation."
There was no immediate con
firmation of the kidnappings in
Israel, Belgium or France.
An Israeli army spokesman
said that the military was investi
gating the report. The French
Foreign Ministry in Paris had no
comment on it, and a Belgian
spokesman said that his govern
ment was seeking confirmation
through its embassies in
Lebanon, Israel and France.
An Israeli army radio broad
cast said that the Interior Mini
stry was checking its lists of
citizens holding dual Israeli-
Belgian citizenship to determine
if any Israelis were aboard the
vessel purportedly seized.

The Abu Nidal group, known
more formally as the Fatah
Revolutionary Council, is
believed responsible for some
100 terrorist actions since its
founding in 1974 as a breakaway
offshoot of Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser
Arafat's mainstream Fatah fac
tion. The group is led by Sabri
Banna, now a sworn enemy of
Arafat who, under his nom de
guerre Abu Nidal (Father of the
Struggle), is perhaps the world's
most wanted terrorist.
Among the group's actions
were the simultaneous grenade
and rifle attacks near the Israeli
national airlines check-in
counters at the Rome and Vienna
airports on Dec. 27, 1985.
Twenty civilians, including five
Americans and an Israeli, died in
those attacks.
