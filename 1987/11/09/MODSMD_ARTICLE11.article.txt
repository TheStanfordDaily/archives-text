# Opposition protests in Managua

MANAGUA, Nicaragua — About 300 anti-
Sandinista activists marched through a
Managua neighborhood yesterday to protest
what they called the government's failure to
live up to the Central American peace agree
ment. Five Republican U.S. congressmen
walked with them.
Opposition leaders faulted President
Daniel Ortega's refusal to meet two obliga
tions of the accord — lifting the state of emer
gency and giving amnesty to prisoners — un
til other countries stop aiding the U.S.-
backed rebels, known as contras,
"The Sandinistas have no political will to
live up to the agreement because they know
that if they do, they cannot remain in
power,!' Julio Ramon Garcia Vilchez, a
leader of Nicaragua's main opposition coali
tion, said at a rally before the march.
Last Thursday was the deadline for each
government to take initial steps required by

the Aug. 7 agreement on ending guerrilla
wars in Central America. The five-nation
pact calls for cease-fires, amnesties, demo
cratic freedoms and denial of outside aid and
sanctuary to armed insurgents.
Ortega said Thursday that Nicaragua had
"fully complied." He announced his readi
ness to hold indirect talks with contra leaders
on a cease-fire and issued decrees to lift the 5-
year-old state of emergency and to free all po
litical prisoners arrested since Jan. 1, 1981.
But he said that neither decree would take
effect until U.S. aid stopped flowing to the
rebels through Honduras and other Central
American countries.
"The Sandinistas can make their own cal
culations and say they are complying 100 per
cent, but that's just a word game," said
Miriam Arguello, a Conservative Party
leader. "They really have to comply. They
cannot look around and point the finger at

others."
The rally and march were organized by the
Democratic Coordinating Council, a coalition
of business, labor and right-of-center political
groups.
While many civil liberties remain formally
suspended under the emergency law, the
event was a sign of the relative freedom given
to anti-Sandinista groups since the peace ac
cord was signed.
Coalition leaders blamed the low turnout
on fear of Sandinista mobs, called turbas,
which harrassed dissidents in the early l9KOs.
In his speech Thursday, Ortega said that all
good Sandinista militants are turbas and
should not stand passively while "the sons of
Reagan" take to the streets.
The march also showed evidence of the
growing activism by U.S. officials and
diplomats on behalf of the opposition.
