# Students re-open cafe at I-center
## Offers alternative to Coffee House 
### Steve Kafka 
The Espresso Bar, a
student-run cafe, opened its
doors at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center Friday night for
the first time this year.
The Espresso Bar was
created two years ago by a
group of students who — in
response to the takeover of the
Coffee House by SAGA Cor
poration — decided a student
run alternative to the Coffee
House should be offered on
campus. Prior to the SAGA
takeover, the Coffee House
was run by students.
Senior Laura Burtness, one
of the founders of the
Espresso Bar, said the goal of
the establishment was "to pro
vide a more personal, student
oriented atmosphere. . . . The
Espresso Bar is more of what

a coffee house should be."
Last year, the Espresso Bar
was open Wednesday through
Saturday nights. Because of
the time commitment involved
for the student volunteers who
run it, this quarter it will be
open Friday nights only. If
more volunteers and musi
cians can be recruited, it will
expand its schedule to include
more nights later this year, ac
cording to Susan Whittlesey,
program director for the 1-
Center.
The Espresso Bar is differ
ent from the Coffee House in
that it is a non-profit organiza
tion. Neither musicians nor
student workers are paid. The
Espresso Bar currently
receives some funding from
the ASSU, but its goal is to be
self-supporting, according to
treasured Doug Welle, a
senior.
