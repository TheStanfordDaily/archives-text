# Ex-defense chief rips arms policy

### Jennifer Jenkins 
Former Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara lashed out at current U.S. nu
clear weapons policy and criticized President
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative in an
address to a capacity crowd at Bishop
Auditorium Friday.
McNamara, who served as Secretary of
Defense for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson
and who is now President of the World Bank,
spoke on the possibilities of national survival
in the nuclear age. He said the present state
of world affairs is "totally unacceptable,"
and claimed that the United States now has
an "historical opportunity to change our
course."
He added that the superpowers must turn
away from the "escalatory process of the last
four decades" in the stockpiling of nuclear
weapons.
But McNamara made it clear he does not
think Strategic Defense is the policy to fol
low. He said there is "no way that SDI will
strengthen deterrence," and predicted that
space-based defense "will lead to a rapid es
calation of the arms race."
He said SDI is seen by the Soviets as a sup
plement to the U.S. nuclear arsenal rather
than as a defense mechanism. The move to
implement SDI, then, is naturally seen as
dangerous to Soviet national security.
According to McNamara, it would be
"foolhardy" for the U.S. to ignore this fact,
especially because U.S. officials have stated
that "we would respond to a U.S.S.R. strate
gic defense in exactly the same way."
McNamara claimed that arms control ne
gotiations and deployment of SDI are
mutually exclusive, because a U.S. space
based defense system will prompt the Soviet
Union to develop a similar system of its own.
This would inevitably result in each side ex

panding its offensive capacities in an attempt
to override its adversary's defense, he said.
McNamara noted that money is no object
in the administration's pursuit of Strategic
Defense. "Don't ever think that because it's
expensive then we won't have it,"he said.
According to McNamara, today's escalat
ing arms race has evolved from incremental
decisions that were each "inescapable" but
which have added up to an unpleasant reality.
He said no conception of a long-term policy
existed when decisions were made to build
and deploy weapons, and that few partici
pants in the decision-making process an
ticipated the situation they were creating.
While stating that neither the U.S. nor the
Soviet Union wants or will risk a nuclear con
frontation with the other, McNamara noted
that unavoidable frictions between the two
nations can develop into dangerous starting
points for nuclear warfare. He cited historical
examples of such instances, including the
Berlin crisis of 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis
of 1962 and the Six Day War in the Middle
East in 1967, all of which occurred during his
tenure at the Pentagon and could have esc
alated into a superpower nuclear conflict.
McNamara cited the shooting down of
Korean Airlines flight (X) 7 by the Soviet Un
ion as a more current example of the ines
capable friction existing between the two su
perpowers.
There is "misinformation and misjudge
ment on both sides, and when tensions are
heightened, there is the danger that irrational
decisions will be made, he said. Stating that
no rational or informed person would cnoose
to use nuclear weapons, McNamara said that
"in moments of crisis, political and military
leaders are neither fully informed nor coolly
rational," and that "the risk of military con
flict escalating into nuclear war is far too
high."

McNamara said many diverse groups in the
United States believe that nuclear weapons
policy must change, but noted that, as of yet,
there is no consensus on which direction the
policy should take. He claimed that top offi
cials do not favor a nuclear-free world; on the
contrary, he said, they view nuclear weapons
as a necessary deterrent to conventional
warfare.
McNamara said he personally thinks the
maintenance of a nuclear-free world is not
feasible because small nations and terrorist
groups cannot definitely be prevented from
building nuclear weapons.
McNamara said this country must move
away from the decision-making process of
the last four decades which has led to the
present nuclear stockpile. "The second half
of this century need not be a repetition of the
first," he said.
He also said many Western Europeans and
Americans are "unaware" of the U.S. strat
egy of early initiation of nuclear weapons use
in a conflict with the Soviet Union. He said
this strategy could result in widespread nu
clear destruction on both sides. "The plans of
the west are more likely to destroy Western
Europe than defend it,"he said.
I he use of nuclear weapons, McNamara
said, must be made less and less likely, but
current U.S. policy is taking the nation in the
opposite direction. "Nuclear weapons have
no military use whatsoever other than to
deter,' McNamara said, adding that the U.S.
goal should be to maintain a state of mutual
deterrence at the lowest possible number of
warheads.
McNamara said that a stable, long-term re
lationship with the Soviet Union is desirable
and attainable in the light of common inter
ests."Time, patience and a consistency of
purpose'' in superpower relations is neces
sary, he said.

According to McNamara, it would be
"foolhardy" for the U.S. to ignore this fact,
especially because U.S. officials have stated
that "we would respond to a U.S.S.R. strate
gic defense in exactly the same way."
McNamara claimed that arms control ne
gotiations and deployment of SDI are
mutually exclusive, because a U.S. space
based defense system will prompt the Soviet
Union to develop a similar system of its own.
This would inevitably result in each side ex

panding its offensive capacities in an attempt
to override its adversary's defense, he said.
McNamara noted that money is no object
in the administration's pursuit of Strategic
Defense. "Don't ever think that because it's
expensive then we won't have it,"he said.
According to McNamara, today's escalat
ing arms race has evolved from incremental
decisions that were each "inescapable" but
which have added up to an unpleasant reality.
He said no conception of a long-term policy
existed when decisions were made to build
and deploy weapons, and that few partici
pants in the decision-making process an
ticipated the situation they were creating.
While stating that neither the U.S. nor the
Soviet Union wants or will risk a nuclear con
frontation with the other, McNamara noted
that unavoidable frictions between the two
nations can develop into dangerous starting
points for nuclear warfare. He cited historical
examples of such instances, including the
Berlin crisis of 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis
of 1962 and the Six Day War in the Middle
East in 1967, all of which occurred during his
tenure at the Pentagon and could have esc
alated into a superpower nuclear conflict.
McNamara cited the shooting down of
Korean Airlines flight (X) 7 by the Soviet Un
ion as a more current example of the ines
capable friction existing between the two su
perpowers.
There is "misinformation and misjudge
ment on both sides, and when tensions are
heightened, there is the danger that irrational
decisions will be made, he said. Stating that
no rational or informed person would cnoose
to use nuclear weapons, McNamara said that
"in moments of crisis, political and military
leaders are neither fully informed nor coolly
rational," and that "the risk of military con
flict escalating into nuclear war is far too
high."

McNamara said many diverse groups in the
United States believe that nuclear weapons
policy must change, but noted that, as of yet,
there is no consensus on which direction the
policy should take. He claimed that top offi
cials do not favor a nuclear-free world; on the
contrary, he said, they view nuclear weapons
as a necessary deterrent to conventional
warfare.
McNamara said he personally thinks the
maintenance of a nuclear-free world is not
feasible because small nations and terrorist
groups cannot definitely be prevented from
building nuclear weapons.
McNamara said this country must move
away from the decision-making process of
the last four decades which has led to the
present nuclear stockpile. "The second half
of this century need not be a repetition of the
first," he said.
He also said many Western Europeans and
Americans are "unaware" of the U.S. strat
egy of early initiation of nuclear weapons use
in a conflict with the Soviet Union. He said
this strategy could result in widespread nu
clear destruction on both sides. "The plans of
the west are more likely to destroy Western
Europe than defend it,"he said.
I he use of nuclear weapons, McNamara
said, must be made less and less likely, but
current U.S. policy is taking the nation in the
opposite direction. "Nuclear weapons have
no military use whatsoever other than to
deter,' McNamara said, adding that the U.S.
goal should be to maintain a state of mutual
deterrence at the lowest possible number of
warheads.
McNamara said that a stable, long-term re
lationship with the Soviet Union is desirable
and attainable in the light of common inter
ests."Time, patience and a consistency of
purpose'' in superpower relations is neces
sary, he said.
Former Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara lashed out at current U.S. nu
clear weapons policy and criticized President
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative in an
address to a capacity crowd at Bishop
Auditorium Friday.
McNamara, who served as Secretary of
Defense for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson
and who is now President of the World Bank,
spoke on the possibilities of national survival
in the nuclear age. He said the present state
of world affairs is "totally unacceptable,"
and claimed that the United States now has
an "historical opportunity to change our
course."
He added that the superpowers must turn
away from the "escalatory process of the last
four decades" in the stockpiling of nuclear
weapons.
But McNamara made it clear he does not
think Strategic Defense is the policy to fol
low. He said there is "no way that SDI will
strengthen deterrence," and predicted that
space-based defense "will lead to a rapid es
calation of the arms race."
He said SDI is seen by the Soviets as a sup
plement to the U.S. nuclear arsenal rather
than as a defense mechanism. The move to
implement SDI, then, is naturally seen as
dangerous to Soviet national security.
