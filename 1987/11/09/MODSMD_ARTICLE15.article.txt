## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper ASSU election follies 
### 
There they go again.
In case you didn't know, the ASSU is holding
an election next week — a very expensive elec
tion.
At a projected cost of $8785.40, the ASSU will
be calling students to the polls next Tuesday and
Wednesday to elect student representatives to
the Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) and to fill vacant graduate seats on the
ASSU Senate.
This election is unnecessary, and the money
being spent on it — your money — is money
wasted.
If the ASSU had acted intelligently last spring,
the vacancies on the SCLC would never have
arisen. Due to an ASSU oversight, the SCLC
positions didn't make it onto the ASSU's spring
election ballot, and thus no student representa
tives were elected. Considering the multiple
delays, recounts and general mismanagement of
last spring's election, such a mistake is not en
tirely surprising.
The student seats on the SCLC should, of
course, be filled. The SCLC has the important
task of overseeing University judicial policy,
and students ought be represented in this proc
ess. However, calling a campus-wide general
election to put three students on one committee
is not worth the expense.
Instead of spending thousands of student dol
lars on a special election, the ASSU should sim
ply allow the University to appoint the three stu
dent representatives to the SCLC. One year of
having University-appointed student representa
tives sitting on the SCLC would not hurt the fu
ture of democratic student government at Stan
ford. It would, however, save a lot of money —
and it might just teach the ASSU to be more
careful.
As for the graduate senate vacancies, they

are, of course, a direct result of the fact that not
enough graduate students chose to run for the
available seats. This is nothing new. Nearly
every year, the ASSU holds a special election in
the fall to fill graduate vacancies left over from
the spring election.
The ASSU ought to face up to the simple and
very obvious fact that there just aren't very
many graduate students interested in being
ASSU senators. Vacant seats should be left va
cant. If not enough students care to run for
them, then so be it — that's democracy.
Part of the reason this "special election'' is
going to cost so much is that the ASSU has
decided to contract Santa Clara County to bring
in electronic voting and counting machines. This
automated balloting accounts for $5300 of total
election costs.
Sophisticated balloting machines might be ne
cessary for large-scale, complicated elections,
but certainly not for an election like this where
the number of issues on the ballot is small and
the number of votes is likely to be tiny.
Calling a $9000 election to fill a few vacancies
is not responsible student government. To help
ensure that such a boondoggle election doesn't
crop up again next year, a constitutional amend
ment to allow for vacancies in the ASSU senate
should be placed on the general election ballot
this spring: such a move would save students
thousands of dollars in election costs over the
next several years. Also, a more careful ap
proach to the process by which student repre
sentatives to University committees are selected
is imperative; slip-ups like the one last spring in
volving the SCLC are simply too costly to
repeat.
The ASSU has an awful lot of student money
at its disposal. It is only fair that we demand it be
handled wisely.
