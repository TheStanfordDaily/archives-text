Article on Gov.
Sununu's visit
disappointing
As a Donner resident who was
present during the talk given by
Gov. John Sununu of New
Hampshire Oct. 23, I was very
disappointed and upset by the ar
ticle that appeared in The Daily
the following Monday (Oct. 26).
It created what I feel is an en
tirely false impression about the
nature and purpose of the talk for
any reader who had not been
present. « *»
The tone of the article was set
immediately by the headline,
which read "Governor attacks
media." This, along with the first
two paragraphs, creates the al
together untrue impression that
Gov. Sununu was here to present
students and parents with
criticisms about the media. The
media encompassed only about
one-third of the governor's talk,
but almost three quarters of the
article was devoted to this topic.
Also, only the negative aspects
of the governor's remarks are
related, and not one positive
statement is quoted. Ask a num
ber of Donner residents what the
governor's main concerns about
the media are, and they will say a
lack of reliable, researched and
responsible journalism. The arti
cle in The Daily appears to be an
example of what the governor is
concerned about.
Unfortunately, none of the
other topics covered by the
governor, nor any of the several

questions asked by students and
parents, were related or dis
cussed in the article. Governor
Sununu spoke at length on topics
such as presidential campaigning
in New Hampshire, New Hamp
shire's first-in-the-nation growth
and lowest unemployment, con
troversies over recent mudsling
ing campaigns and the un
balanced and confusing presiden
tial primary process.
Rather than discuss several or
all of these themes, the reporter
chose to sensationalize one small
aspect of the talk in a negative
way. Another shortfall of the ar
ticle, which appears to be com
mon practice or policy at The
Daily, was that not a single stu
dent or parent was asked for a
comment or opinion, despite the
fact that everyone 1 spoke with
really enjoyed the talk and felt
the governor had done an excel
lent job.
There was also no background
on exactly why the governor of
New Hampshire was here in
Donner talking with students and
parents. Governor Sununu hap
pens to be my father, and the
dorm staff asked me if I was will
ing to ask him to give a talk while
he was here for Parents'
Weekend.
Normally I would have de
clined for my own reasons, but 1
realized that it was a unique op
portunity for both students and
parents to meet someone in my
father s position, so I asked him.
My father gave this informal talk
as a personal favor to me. None
of these facts were even asked
about by the reporter. Upon
reading the article and seeing The
Daily's failure to report in a thor
ough, responsible and fair man

ner, I doubt that I will ever ask
my father back to Stanford to
speak again.

Freshman, undeclared
Support football
team, not petty
student whims
Having sat next to the student
section during the last two
games, it's clear that it's time
Stanford students began assum
ing some responsibility for the
football team's lack of intensity.
I've never seen worse fans.
The students only show up when
they want to, and when they do
show up they seem more con
cerned with their conversations
and with what the band is doing
than with the game at hand.
This is all exacerbated when
the band plans "All Right Now"
after field goals, despite the fact
that the team is disappointed it
didn't get an important touch
down. Of course, the students
would rather clap and jump up
for any reason than concern
themselves whether such a field
goal might be a momentum swing
for the opposition.
All we ask is if you go to the
game, support the team, not your
own petty whims like watching
the Dollies circle the field on
scooters during the crucial fourth
quarter. God knows you have all
the time you need to get drunk or
distracted the rest of the week.

team, not petty
student whims
Having sat next to the student
section during the last two
games, it's clear that it's time
Stanford students began assum
ing some responsibility for the
football team's lack of intensity.
I've never seen worse fans.
The students only show up when
they want to, and when they do
show up they seem more con
cerned with their conversations
and with what the band is doing
than with the game at hand.
This is all exacerbated when
the band plans "All Right Now"
after field goals, despite the fact
that the team is disappointed it
didn't get an important touch
down. Of course, the students
would rather clap and jump up
for any reason than concern
themselves whether such a field
goal might be a momentum swing
for the opposition.
All we ask is if you go to the
game, support the team, not your
own petty whims like watching
the Dollies circle the field on
scooters during the crucial fourth
quarter. God knows you have all
the time you need to get drunk or
distracted the rest of the week.

Article on Gov.
Sununu's visit
disappointing
As a Donner resident who was
present during the talk given by
Gov. John Sununu of New
Hampshire Oct. 23, I was very
disappointed and upset by the ar
ticle that appeared in The Daily
the following Monday (Oct. 26).
It created what I feel is an en
tirely false impression about the
nature and purpose of the talk for
any reader who had not been
present. « *»
The tone of the article was set
immediately by the headline,
which read "Governor attacks
media." This, along with the first
two paragraphs, creates the al
together untrue impression that
Gov. Sununu was here to present
students and parents with
criticisms about the media. The
media encompassed only about
one-third of the governor's talk,
but almost three quarters of the
article was devoted to this topic.
Also, only the negative aspects
of the governor's remarks are
related, and not one positive
statement is quoted. Ask a num
ber of Donner residents what the
governor's main concerns about
the media are, and they will say a
lack of reliable, researched and
responsible journalism. The arti
cle in The Daily appears to be an
example of what the governor is
concerned about.
Unfortunately, none of the
other topics covered by the
governor, nor any of the several

questions asked by students and
parents, were related or dis
cussed in the article. Governor
Sununu spoke at length on topics
such as presidential campaigning
in New Hampshire, New Hamp
shire's first-in-the-nation growth
and lowest unemployment, con
troversies over recent mudsling
ing campaigns and the un
balanced and confusing presiden
tial primary process.
Rather than discuss several or
all of these themes, the reporter
chose to sensationalize one small
aspect of the talk in a negative
way. Another shortfall of the ar
