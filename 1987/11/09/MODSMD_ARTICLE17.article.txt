## Offer real incentives to students 
### 
The Jordan Scholars Program is long
overdue for the evaluation it will receive later
this year from the Committee on Undergrad
uate Admissions and Financial Aid (Daily,
Nov. 4). Last year's implementation of the
program was a slap in the face to every Stan
ford student, for it dared to cardinally rank
each newly admitted freshmen according to a
subjective review of his or her special abili
ties.

Granted, this process is the way all applica
tions are denied or offered admission, but to
rank students who have already been admit
ted serves no purpose. The additional
categorization is dangerous because it
promotes an elite sub-class within the group
of admitted students and fosters an unneces

sary competitive atmosphere within the stu
dent body as a whole.
To increase their chances of admission to a
quality university, incoming freshmen
needed to succeed in a competitive high
school environment. But one of Stanford's
appeals is a refreshing lack of competition be
tween undergraduates for grades.
I find that this frees each student to learn as
much or as little from courses as he or she
desires, without having to worry about
beating others out for a grade. Quite a few
students even refuse to discuss their grades,
good or bad, because they realize the benefits
they receive from a course cannot always be
measured auantitatively by a letter grade.
Being selected as a Jordan Scholar implies
that one is somehow "better" than one's
classmates, and this premise strengthens the
competitive instinct in both the scholars and
their classmates, while making it more likely
that a freshman will take longer to dis
criminate between learning for self-

improvement and absorbing material to ob
tain a good grade.
The main purpose of the Jordan Scholars
Program, according to Stanford officials, is to
convince highly qualified applicants to attend
Stanford rather than rivals like Harvard,
Princeton and Yale.
If the University wants to attract the
"best" students, it needs to offer them real
incentives to accept admission to Stanford.
These could include guaranteed housing for
four years, an increase in the quality and
availability of classrooms, and more faculty
members dedicated to undergraduate teach
ing.
These arc difficult and controversial issues
that will take time to resolve, but for Stanford
the solution to attracting "the cream of the
crop' lies in a greater commitment to under
graduate education, not in a token, ego
inflating "honor" handed out to a select few.
