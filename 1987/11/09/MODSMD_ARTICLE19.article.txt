# A 						major decision awaits
## 
### 
I suffer from a chronic case of indecisiveness. I
never seem to be able to make up my mind about
anything. Wait, let me amend that. I can't make up
my mind about anything important. Little things,
like whether I prefer 1 or 2 percent milk, if
Madonna is superior to Cyndi Lauper or what color
toothbrush to buy are easy. No problems there.
One percent, Cyndi and green. But just ask me
about something of real significance, and I'm
stuck.

Vivid proof of this is prominently displayed at the
end of my column, down there in the italics. No,
not the part about alternating Mondays. 1 was given
no choice in the matter. It's the bit about the
"undeclared sophomore." My greatest tribulation.
My Waterloo.
I'm not alone in this. At any given time, it seems
that half of Stanford undergrads are undeclared.
The other half are "between majors." These are
the people who say things like "Well, right now I'm
in chem, but 1 think I'll go art history by the end of
winter."
I assume that there is a small minority who have
a major set in stone and adhere to it with great
tenacity, but they must all be living off campus be
cause 1 certainly have no contact with them.
But preoccupation with the selection of a major
is the particular burden of my class, the sopho
mores. We're in academic limbo: done with West
ern Culture but not yet ready to head overseas.
Like a dreadful specter, the end of the year
looms ahead of us, for we know that by then we
must make "The Choice." The University
demands it. Our parents are anxious to finally
know what their money has bought them. Our
friends at other schools that required declarations
in the freshman year are rubbing their palms to
gether with glee.
I realize that this indecisiveness has just got to
go. I'm 19 years old, and it's high time that I
decided exactly how I intend to spend the next 50
or so years of my life. That's the American Way.
To achieve this end, I've asked a lot of people for
advice and have noticed that the replies boil down
to four theories concerning choosing a major;
• The Do What You're Good At Theory: Some
people say you should impartially assess your skills
and abilities and then logically determine which
major would best exploit those.
I tried this, and the results were dismal. Despite

an exhaustive search I was unable to locate a single
reference to a penmanship major anywhere in the
Courses and Degrees. Those of us who were al
ways the ones who had to write up the group's
report because we had the nicest handwriting are
just out of luck.
• The Do What You Want To Theory: A nice idea
when first examined. If everyone majored in what
they liked best, everyone would be happy. People
who suggest this are often the type that dress as
sunflowers for Halloween. Be wary of them, espe
cially if they think that ignoring a $25,000 debt in fa
vor of studying something as utilitarian as medieval
philosophy is an example of rational behavior.
• The It Really Doesn't Matter in the l ong Run
Theory: Perhaps the most frightening yet. This one
says that what you eventually end up doing will
probably have absolutely nothing to do with your
original field of study, so it matters very little what
you choose.
If I will end up selling State Farm Insurance in
Des Moines, lowa, regardless of whether I study
political science or product design, then what the
hell am I doing spending $19,(KM) a year to attend a
university? Personal growth, you say? Sorry, but
I've been to Des Moines and personal growth
doesn't count for a bucket of small, evenly polished
river pebbles there.
• The I Don't Know Either and Was Hoping You
Could Help Theory: The most common by far. I
like this one best because you can commiserate
with another person and then go off to the Coffee
House for espresso and forget the whole worrisome
business. This theory is based on the axiom that an
undergraduate major is only four short years, but
caffeine is forever.
So where does this leave a person like myself
now? In the middle of nowhere, basically. The
whole mess rapidly escalates into a migraine of epic
proportions as you realize that the only thing you
want to do for the rest of your life is eat, sleep and
breathe on a regular basis. The process of choosing
a major eventually ends up as one of elimination.
To conclude, I would like to offer a few "do"s
and "don't "s that might make things easier for
other undeclared souls.
Don't open "Courses and Degrees" at random to
pick a major.
Do meet a grad student in a field you are consid
ering. Look at him or her. Is that what you want to
look like in four years?
Don't stop out for a while to mull things over. In
the 1960s we called this "finding yourself."
Most important of all. Don't take any classes in
the field you decide upon. This is the quickest way
to become disillusioned with it, and then you have
to decide all over again. Of course, this is a vicious
circle, but no one ever promised that life would be
easy.

anything. Wait, let me amend that. I can't make up
my mind about anything important. Little things,
like whether I prefer 1 or 2 percent milk, if
Madonna is superior to Cyndi Lauper or what color
toothbrush to buy are easy. No problems there.
One percent, Cyndi and green. But just ask me
about something of real significance, and I'm
stuck.

Vivid proof of this is prominently displayed at the
end of my column, down there in the italics. No,
not the part about alternating Mondays. 1 was given
no choice in the matter. It's the bit about the
"undeclared sophomore." My greatest tribulation.
My Waterloo.
I'm not alone in this. At any given time, it seems
that half of Stanford undergrads are undeclared.
The other half are "between majors." These are
the people who say things like "Well, right now I'm
in chem, but 1 think I'll go art history by the end of
winter."
I assume that there is a small minority who have
a major set in stone and adhere to it with great
tenacity, but they must all be living off campus be
cause 1 certainly have no contact with them.
But preoccupation with the selection of a major
is the particular burden of my class, the sopho
mores. We're in academic limbo: done with West
ern Culture but not yet ready to head overseas.
Like a dreadful specter, the end of the year
looms ahead of us, for we know that by then we
must make "The Choice." The University
demands it. Our parents are anxious to finally
know what their money has bought them. Our
friends at other schools that required declarations
in the freshman year are rubbing their palms to
gether with glee.
I realize that this indecisiveness has just got to
go. I'm 19 years old, and it's high time that I
decided exactly how I intend to spend the next 50
or so years of my life. That's the American Way.
To achieve this end, I've asked a lot of people for
advice and have noticed that the replies boil down
to four theories concerning choosing a major;
• The Do What You're Good At Theory: Some
people say you should impartially assess your skills
and abilities and then logically determine which
major would best exploit those.
I tried this, and the results were dismal. Despite

an exhaustive search I was unable to locate a single
reference to a penmanship major anywhere in the
Courses and Degrees. Those of us who were al
ways the ones who had to write up the group's
report because we had the nicest handwriting are
just out of luck.
• The Do What You Want To Theory: A nice idea
when first examined. If everyone majored in what
they liked best, everyone would be happy. People
who suggest this are often the type that dress as
sunflowers for Halloween. Be wary of them, espe
cially if they think that ignoring a $25,000 debt in fa
vor of studying something as utilitarian as medieval
philosophy is an example of rational behavior.
• The It Really Doesn't Matter in the l ong Run
Theory: Perhaps the most frightening yet. This one
says that what you eventually end up doing will
probably have absolutely nothing to do with your
original field of study, so it matters very little what
you choose.
If I will end up selling State Farm Insurance in
Des Moines, lowa, regardless of whether I study
political science or product design, then what the
hell am I doing spending $19,(KM) a year to attend a
university? Personal growth, you say? Sorry, but
I've been to Des Moines and personal growth
doesn't count for a bucket of small, evenly polished
river pebbles there.
• The I Don't Know Either and Was Hoping You
Could Help Theory: The most common by far. I
like this one best because you can commiserate
with another person and then go off to the Coffee
House for espresso and forget the whole worrisome
business. This theory is based on the axiom that an
undergraduate major is only four short years, but
caffeine is forever.
So where does this leave a person like myself
now? In the middle of nowhere, basically. The
whole mess rapidly escalates into a migraine of epic
proportions as you realize that the only thing you
want to do for the rest of your life is eat, sleep and
breathe on a regular basis. The process of choosing
a major eventually ends up as one of elimination.
To conclude, I would like to offer a few "do"s
and "don't "s that might make things easier for
other undeclared souls.
Don't open "Courses and Degrees" at random to
pick a major.
Do meet a grad student in a field you are consid
ering. Look at him or her. Is that what you want to
look like in four years?
Don't stop out for a while to mull things over. In
the 1960s we called this "finding yourself."
Most important of all. Don't take any classes in
the field you decide upon. This is the quickest way
to become disillusioned with it, and then you have
to decide all over again. Of course, this is a vicious
circle, but no one ever promised that life would be
easy.
