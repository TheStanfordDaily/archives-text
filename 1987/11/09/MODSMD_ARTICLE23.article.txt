Over the past couple of years
Stanford students have taken to
aerobics in droves. Whether
their motives have been to
avoid gaining the "freshman
15," to stay in shape or to
relieve stress, students have
found aerobics a fun and con
venient way to maintain their
physical and mental health.

The Toughest Workout, a class
offered by Stanford Aerobics or
by the Cowell Student Health
Center's Aerobics Movement
Program for graduate students.
Stanford Aerobics, a non
funded, non-profit organization
affiliated with the ASSU,
started about five years ago in
response to students' needs for
regular, vigorous exercise. For
$15 to $40 a quarter, members
can enjoy the benefits of the 12
classes offered each week in
both high and low impact
aerobics at Okada House,
Cedro House, Lathrop House
and Roble Gym.
"We even have a short and
intense class at Trancos which
consists only of the running
aerobics part for people who
don't have (very much] time,"
said Kelly Miller, one of Stan
ford Aerobics' four instructors.
To keep from frightening
beginners, instructors try to
choreograph their routines to
accommodate all the different
levels in the class. "The leaders
provide a model of the toughest
workout for those who want it
and let others tone it down to
their own levels," freshman
Kia Ferree said.
"1 get tremendous satisfac
tion because the advancement
is really quick." freshman Gia
Bosko said. "By the third
workout I could do the whole

routine without stopping."
One common misconception
among participants is that when
they do low-impact aerobics —
in which there is less bouncing
up and down — they are doing a
lower-intensity workout. But
instuctor Andrea Boseker said
that "low-impact is a vigorous
workout without all the jumping
around.
"One foot is on the floor at all
times, and there's more concen
tration and deep muscle con
traction involved. In fact, the
heart rate should be the same
regardless of which type of im
pact you choose," she said.
All the instructors stressed
the importance of having a class
that is both safe and tough. In
structor Christine Mergen said
that high-impact running is gen

erally done for 30 to 35 minutes
"because that's the maximum
you'd want to go and still be ef
ficient with your body."
Although there are standard
ized moves and guidelines, vari
ety is a must in all of the
classes. "Every instructor has
different music and routines,
which add to the students' en
joyment," Miller said.
While many undergraduates
immediately jumped on the
aerobics bandwagon, survey
data over the past six years
have shown that Stanford grad
uate students are less inclined
than their undergraduate coun
terparts to exercise.
To address this situation,
Cowell created the Aerobics
Movement Program. "We want
to bring the healthy habit to the

student group least likely to ex
ercise," said Ana Kozlowski,
health promotion specialist at
Cowell "Our primary objective
is to make sure that non-regular
exercisers engage in and main
tain a regular program of physi
cal activity."
Structured for flexible atten
dance, the Aerobic Movement
Program offers classes at loca
tions and times convenient to
graduate students' schedules.
For most graduates the fact that
the program is free is an added
benefit because of their gener
ally tight budgets.

More and more Stanford students are doing aerobics these days to stay fit, have fun and meet people.
Village Cottage Room and at
Roble Gym. "I can always work
aerobics around my busy
schedule to maintain my level of
fitness," said Greer Bosworth, a
law student.
Because of the predominance
of women in all the classes, ad
vertising efforts by Cowell have
been specifically designed to ap
peal to both the male and female
population.
Cowell cites a 156-percent in
crease in the number of male par
ticipants in this year's annual
report. Overall, 29 percent of the
participants are men and 71 per
cent are women.
"Many places advertise their
classes as aerobic dance, and this
scares away the men," said Koz
lowski. "We call our program
aerobic movement to emphasize
the tact that dancing can be done
in a very athletic way. We're
very conscious of men's needs
and try to make routines which
would make them feel comforta
ble."
I ips on self-pacing and injury
prevention keep students from
dancing in the dark. "Nothing
done in excess is healthy," Koz
lowski said. "We encourage stu

dents to listen to their bodies and
emphasize that it's not necessary
to kill oneself" in order to he in
good shape."
Quick, tangible results also
make the Aerobic Movement
Program extremely appealing to
graduates. "We don't like to
preach to students at this age that
exercise will reduce the risk of
heart attacks when they're 60,
because that's really far away,"
Kozlowski said. "We tell them
that they should exercise be
cause they will have more energy
to study that night and will be
less stressed."
Students cited the opportunity
for social interaction in a non
academic setting outside of their
own departments as yet another
reason to do aerobics. "I would
exercise myself, but I certainly
find it more enjoyable working
out with other people," graduate
student Carlos Suri said.
The Aerobic Movement Pro
gram is staffed by nine instruc
tors, eight of whom are trained
student volunteers. These fitness
leaders must have CPR certifica
tion and must attend workshops
on exercise physiology,
"The minimal 3-percent rate of
injury in our classes compared
with the average rate of 4.1 per
cent (nationally) clearly reflects
the competence of our instruc
tors," Kozlowski said.
