Over the past couple of years
Stanford students have taken to
aerobics in droves. Whether
their motives have been to
avoid gaining the "freshman
15," to stay in shape or to
relieve stress, students have
found aerobics a fun and con
venient way to maintain their
physical and mental health.
Seven days a week partici
pants can jump, stretch and
sweat their way to fitness in
The Toughest Workout, a class
offered by Stanford Aerobics or
by the Cowell Student Health
Center's Aerobics Movement
Program for graduate students.
Stanford Aerobics, a non
funded, non-profit organization
affiliated with the ASSU,
started about five years ago in
response to students' needs for
regular, vigorous exercise. For
$15 to $40 a quarter, members
can enjoy the benefits of the 12
classes offered each week in
both high and low impact
aerobics at Okada House,
Cedro House, Lathrop House
and Roble Gym.
"We even have a short and
intense class at Trancos which
consists only of the running
aerobics part for people who
don't have (very much] time,"
said Kelly Miller, one of Stan
ford Aerobics' four instructors.
To keep from frightening
beginners, instructors try to
choreograph their routines to
accommodate all the different
levels in the class. "The leaders
provide a model of the toughest
workout for those who want it
and let others tone it down to
their own levels," freshman
Kia Ferree said.
"1 get tremendous satisfac
tion because the advancement
is really quick." freshman Gia
Bosko said. "By the third
workout I could do the whole

routine without stopping."
One common misconception
among participants is that when
they do low-impact aerobics —
in which there is less bouncing
up and down — they are doing a
lower-intensity workout. But
instuctor Andrea Boseker said
that "low-impact is a vigorous
workout without all the jumping
around.
"One foot is on the floor at all
times, and there's more concen
tration and deep muscle con
traction involved. In fact, the
heart rate should be the same
regardless of which type of im
pact you choose," she said.
All the instructors stressed
the importance of having a class
that is both safe and tough. In
structor Christine Mergen said
that high-impact running is gen

erally done for 30 to 35 minutes
"because that's the maximum
you'd want to go and still be ef
ficient with your body."
Although there are standard
ized moves and guidelines, vari
ety is a must in all of the
classes. "Every instructor has
different music and routines,
which add to the students' en
joyment," Miller said.
While many undergraduates
immediately jumped on the
aerobics bandwagon, survey
data over the past six years
have shown that Stanford grad
uate students are less inclined
than their undergraduate coun
terparts to exercise.
To address this situation,
Cowell created the Aerobics
Movement Program. "We want
to bring the healthy habit to the

student group least likely to ex
ercise," said Ana Kozlowski,
health promotion specialist at
Cowell "Our primary objective
is to make sure that non-regular
exercisers engage in and main
tain a regular program of physi
cal activity."
Structured for flexible atten
dance, the Aerobic Movement
Program offers classes at loca
tions and times convenient to
graduate students' schedules.
For most graduates the fact that
the program is free is an added
benefit because of their gener
ally tight budgets.
Classes are held sjx days a
