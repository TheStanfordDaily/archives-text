"The Hitlers at Home."
It would probably make a great
sitcom. That fun-loving Adolph
and his bubbly wife, Eva, to
gether sharing a quiet evening in
their tastefully decorated con
crete Gestapo bunker. On this
week's show, Adolph and Eva
decide to commit a nifty double
suicide so that Hitler will take his
little secrets to the grave.
But after the Chrysler com
mercial we discover the plot
twist: Adolph isn't really com
mitting suicide, but instead, un
beknownst to the rest of the Nazi
leadership, he is escaping from
the country while the rest of the
world thinks him dead (laugh
track).
This really beats the Cosby
show.
Thus begins the story of "The
Berkut," a tightly narrated,
engrossing Nazi chase story by
former Air Force navigator
Joseph Heywood.
It is April, 1945, and the war is
all but lost for the Nazis. Hitler is
given a new identity and
smuggled out of Berlin by a crack
Nazi team led by SS Colonel
Gunter Brumm. Brumm is cool,
confident and, most important,
has an umlaut over the "u" in his
first name. Teamed with another
Nazi named Beard and four
teenage SS-wannabe girls, Hitler
is taken into hiding to a remote
cabin in a hidden valley in the
mountains of Germany.
Everybody in the world thinks
Hitler is dead, except for Joseph
Stalin (he was the premier of
Russia, for you computer science
majors), who assigns a crack
Russian commando team led by
Arnold Schwarzenneger to cross
the galaxy and find Hitler and kill

him. No, I'm sorry, I made that
part up; 1 just wanted to see
whether you'd managed to read
this far.
The craek commando team is
led by the Berkut, Vasily Petrov,
and includes four other
specialists in weaponry, track
ing, filling and foreign lan
guages. Their mission: to find
Hitler and bring him back alive.
Stalin has given the Russian
team the Red Badge, a document
that allows them an unfathom-

able amount of power over the
Russian army, and virtually free
will to do whatever they desire
within any territory controlled by
the Russians. The Red Badge is
very similar to an American Ex
press Gold Card.
That's the set-up. and from
there on in are 489 pages of a
classic Nazi-spy-thriller-chase
novel. There are several things,
however, that set "The Berkut
apart from other Nazi-spy
thi iller-chase-novels.
Most interesting is that it is
told from the perspectives of
both the Germans and the Rus
sians. We are allowed inside the
heads of the hunters and the
hunted, and in doing so we
develop a respect, and even a

liking for both parties. Heywood
will give us 10 pages of Brumm
plotting Hitler's escape, and tor
those 10 pages we watch in awe,
hoping that he will succeed.
Then, for the next 10 pages we
are inside Petrov's head, hoping
he will be able to catch those
Nazi swine. It is not uncommon
for authors to write a story from
the perspective of the criminals
and put us squarely on their side,
but to put us on both sides at
once is both exciting and diffi-

'The Berkut' has
all the good things
that a Nazi spy
thriller should
have: sex, vio
lence, sex, vio
lence and sex.
Did 1 mention the
sex?

cult.
So where are the Americans
throughout this whole exciting
Hitler-hunt? Except for Beau
Valentine, a discharged OSS
operative who realizes Hitler has
escaped, every other American
citizen on the face of the earth
has a Bret Easton Ellis ("Less
Than Zero") IQ. This is the Rus
sians against the Germans.
Heywood's prose is re
markably well-crafted, and his
attention to detail adds
credibility to the plot. From care
ful descriptions of Stalin's dining
habits to a graphic explanation of
gutting a warthog (I'm not kid
ding here) every scene is care
fully set and described.
Thankfully, Heywood resists

the temptation to use long foreign
words and phrases to try to spice
up the dialogue. Too many other
authors of Nazi novels try to
show off their knowledge of Ger
man by starting every other sen
tence with ten habe eine Kuh
Xefressen, followed by the same
sentence in English. (You fre
quently find a similar phenome
non in Stanford math classes.)
It's cute the first 20 times, but
after a while you start feeling
really annoyed, not to mention
fluent. With this novel, had the
author chosen to throw in mil
lions of German, Russian and
Italian sentences, frankly I might
have gone nuts.
That is not to say that "The
Berkut" doesn't have all the
good things that a Nazi spy thril
ler should have. It has sex, vio
lence, sex, violence and sex. Did
I mention the sex?
There are about 10 main char
acters in the story, each of whom
has sex with all the others at least
200 times. I mean, if anybody in
real life had as much sex as these
people, they'd never walk again.
Even Hitler gets in on the action
(You were wondering where the
warthog comes in?).
Most Nazi novels have that
requisite scene where the
Obersturmfuhrer bursts into the
room of the Sauerkrautfuhrer,
only to discover him in bed with
a muscular young Austrian offi
cer named Hans, but frankly this
book is ridiculous. They have sex
in the underground hot springs,
sex on the bombed-out rubble of
Berlin, sex after eating a warm,
raw warthog heart (Again, I am
not making this up).
Not that I'm objecting, mind
you. I just wanted to be sure you
weren't planning on reading this
one to the kids.
We are also afforded a rather
fascinating — if not fictional —
look at the persona of Adolph
Hitler. It doesn't take Colonel
Brumm and Beard long to realize
that their beloved Fuhrer is about
a quart low. Hitler spends much

of his time concealed in the
mountain cabin ranting, although
often he breaks from these
tirades long enough to rave.
The war is over, Nazi Ger
many has fallen, and the two SS
men have a hard time maintain
ing allegiance to a crazy old fal
len leader named Adolph.
The story gets more and more
bizarre as it continues. New
characters are introduced, killed
and discarded with regularity
(after having sex, of course).
Even the Pope and the Vatican
get involved in the dastardly plot,
although you'll be relieved to
hear that Pope Pius doesn't go
anywhere near the conjugal war
thog. Far be it from me to reveal
the multitude of plot twists or the
nifty ending: suffice it to say that
it gets more and more exciting as
you near the conclusion.
The copy of this book that The
Daily received came with a press
release that had quotes from
newspapers like "...1 couldn't
put it down..." and"...the best
new author of fiction since Bob

Woodward..." Two reviewers
said "The Berkut" reminded
them of "Day of the Jackal.
I've never read "Day of the
Jackal," but 1 have seen "Night
of the Living Dead. Just
thought you'd like to know.
Author Joseph Heywood
earned a bachelor's in journalism
from Michigan State University
and spent five years in the Air
Force as a navigator. Later he
did graduate work in English
Literature at Western Michigan
University. He spent four years
researching for "The Berkut,"
including a visit to Germany.
"The Berkut" is, in all fair
ness, a remarkably engrossing
story, and for fans of Nazi novels
this is one of the best to come
along in years. Although not as
historically accurate as some
other "historical fiction" of
World War II like "Mila IK" and
"Exodus". "The Berkut" never
theless is crafted with such
remarkable detail and skill that
any fan of good thrillers will find
this one hard to pass up.
