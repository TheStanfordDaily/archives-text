## Trojan air attack bombs Card, 39-24 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — The Stanford Cardinal out
distanced the USC Trojans in nearly every offen
sive category but points Saturday at the L.A.
Coliseum. But for the second week in a row, the op
posing quarterback and a free safety with the initials
C.C. destroyed the Cardinal's opportunities.
USC's 39-24 victory before a crowd of 58,992 and
a national television audience kept the Trojans in
the Rose Bowl race with rival UCLA. The Trojans
now have a record of 6-3 overall and 5-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, while UCLA, which crushed
Oregon State Saturday, has a 6-0 conference mark.
The two teams meet at USC Nov. 21.
Meanwhile, the loss dropped Stanford to 3-6
overall and 2-4 in the league, eliminating all hopes
for a winning season.
USC junior Rodney Peete was the latest in a long
line of quarterbacks to have a career game against
Stanford this season, finishing 17 of 20 passing for
273 yards and five touchdowns.
"Jesus Christ, I don't think we've seen a bad one
(quarterback)," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"They all do good against us.
"Peete is very dangerous, though," he said. "He
throws extremely well on the run and had a very
consistent, accurate day. Did he miss any, or were
they all complete?"
Peete's live TD passes set a USC single-game
record, and during the contest the junior also
became the Trojans' all-time leading passer with
355 career completions." Rodney Peete had an out
standing game," USC Coach Larry Smith said.
"Anythime you have a quarterback throw five
touchdown passes, you know he's doing a fabulous
job."
Sophomore free safety Cleveland Colter also did
a fabulous job, picking off three Brian Johnson
passes to pick up right where Arizona's Chuck
Cecil (four interceptions) left off last week.
"Cecil had four picks last week, and I was trying
to catch him," said Colter, who also recorded seven
tackles, a fumble recovery and gained 40 yards on
two kickoff returns. "I saw on the films that he was
jumping everything, so I tried it and 1 got lucky,
too."
Colter's third theft of the day proved to be the
most crushing blow to the Stanford offense. The
Cardinal had come back from a 28-6 halftime deficit
with two touchdowns to make the score 31-18 early
in the fourth quarter, and after a successful onsides
kick, Stanford was driving toward the Trojan end
zone.

I ! SC linebacker Marcus Cotton corrals Stanford quarterback Brian Johnson Saturday for one of the
Trojans' five sacks on the day.
On second and 11 from the USC 39,
Johnson completed a 12-yard pass to
receiver Ed McCaffrey, who had five re
ceptions for 57 yards on the day. With a
first down at the Trojan 27, the Cardinal
took a time out. On the next play Johnson
launched a pass over the middle for Mar
shall Dillard but Colter reached up for the
ball right in front of the Stanford back.
The Trojans took advantage of the Car
dinal miscue by scoring their final touch
down of the day on a 28-yard touchdown
pass from Peete to Randy Tanner.
"Peete was whipping it in between
some people," Stanford safety Bruce
Richardson said. "He did a good job of
finding the open receiver."
Then, just to make sure, the Trojans
went for the two-point conversion, and got
it on another Peete toss, this time to Erik
Aftholter, to put the Trojans up 39-18.
Not a bad idea, as it turned out. Greg
Ennis came in at quarterback for Stanford
with 4:30 left and marched the Cardinal
from its own 39 to the USC 29 on an 18-
*yard pass to Walter Batson and a 10-yard
run.
A hard hit by Colter on the run knocked
Ennis out of the game with a mild concus
sion, however, and Johnson came back in.
On his second play, Johnson hit Brad
Muster cruising toward the end zone for a
29-yard score.
"1 had Brad doing a post route over the
middle, and he ran a little wider than

usuai," Johnson said. "1 had enough time
to wait for him and put it over everybody
iuiu ii»w end zone."
Stanford then went for the two-point
conversion and failed for the third straight
time, leaving the score 39-24.
"USC built up a big lead and we had to
come back being down by 22 at the half,"
said Muster, who picked up 72 yards and a
touchdown on 19 carries and caught six
passes for 103 yards and another score.
"We got some momentum the second half
but didn't score that one series and they
came back and did score. We needed full
momentum the second half and didn't
have it."
Nevertheless, the Cardinal outgained
the Trojans in total offense 447 yards to
417, ran 32 more plays, held the ball over
nine minutes longer and picked up eight
more first downs than USC.
"We had an efficient offense," Smith
said, "and though they weren't on the
field very often, we scored 39 points and
you have to be thankful for that."
The Trojan offense was particularly effi
cient in the first half, when Peete con
nected with second-string receiver John
Jackson for scores of 28, 26 and 7 yards
and hit Leroy Holt with a 39-yard strike.
"He's one of the best quarterbacks
we've faced," Stanford linebacker Barry
McKeever said. "When he's hot, he's a
great quarterback, and for some reason he
always seems to have his best games
against Stanford."
Card notes
Star Stanford receiver Jeff James had to
leave the game late in the first quarter with a
pulled groin muscle. It is not known how long
he will be out.

Although the Stanford defense had a long day against USC's passing game Saturday, Kurt Colehower (50) and company did

in which Webster rushed for over 100 vards.
LOS ANGELES — The Stanford Cardinal out
distanced the USC Trojans in nearly every offen
sive category but points Saturday at the L.A.
Coliseum. But for the second week in a row, the op
posing quarterback and a free safety with the initials
C.C. destroyed the Cardinal's opportunities.
USC's 39-24 victory before a crowd of 58,992 and
a national television audience kept the Trojans in
the Rose Bowl race with rival UCLA. The Trojans
now have a record of 6-3 overall and 5-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, while UCLA, which crushed
Oregon State Saturday, has a 6-0 conference mark.
The two teams meet at USC Nov. 21.
Meanwhile, the loss dropped Stanford to 3-6
overall and 2-4 in the league, eliminating all hopes
for a winning season.
USC junior Rodney Peete was the latest in a long
line of quarterbacks to have a career game against
Stanford this season, finishing 17 of 20 passing for
273 yards and five touchdowns.
"Jesus Christ, I don't think we've seen a bad one
(quarterback)," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"They all do good against us.
"Peete is very dangerous, though," he said. "He
throws extremely well on the run and had a very
consistent, accurate day. Did he miss any, or were
they all complete?"
Peete's live TD passes set a USC single-game
record, and during the contest the junior also
became the Trojans' all-time leading passer with
355 career completions." Rodney Peete had an out
standing game," USC Coach Larry Smith said.
"Anythime you have a quarterback throw five
touchdown passes, you know he's doing a fabulous
job."
Sophomore free safety Cleveland Colter also did
a fabulous job, picking off three Brian Johnson
passes to pick up right where Arizona's Chuck
Cecil (four interceptions) left off last week.
"Cecil had four picks last week, and I was trying
to catch him," said Colter, who also recorded seven
tackles, a fumble recovery and gained 40 yards on
two kickoff returns. "I saw on the films that he was
jumping everything, so I tried it and 1 got lucky,
too."
Colter's third theft of the day proved to be the
most crushing blow to the Stanford offense. The
Cardinal had come back from a 28-6 halftime deficit
with two touchdowns to make the score 31-18 early
in the fourth quarter, and after a successful onsides
kick, Stanford was driving toward the Trojan end
zone.

I ! SC linebacker Marcus Cotton corrals Stanford quarterback Brian Johnson Saturday for one of the
Trojans' five sacks on the day.
On second and 11 from the USC 39,
Johnson completed a 12-yard pass to
receiver Ed McCaffrey, who had five re
ceptions for 57 yards on the day. With a
first down at the Trojan 27, the Cardinal
took a time out. On the next play Johnson
launched a pass over the middle for Mar
shall Dillard but Colter reached up for the
ball right in front of the Stanford back.
The Trojans took advantage of the Car
dinal miscue by scoring their final touch
down of the day on a 28-yard touchdown
pass from Peete to Randy Tanner.
"Peete was whipping it in between
some people," Stanford safety Bruce
Richardson said. "He did a good job of
finding the open receiver."
Then, just to make sure, the Trojans
went for the two-point conversion, and got
it on another Peete toss, this time to Erik
Aftholter, to put the Trojans up 39-18.
Not a bad idea, as it turned out. Greg
Ennis came in at quarterback for Stanford
with 4:30 left and marched the Cardinal
from its own 39 to the USC 29 on an 18-
*yard pass to Walter Batson and a 10-yard
run.
A hard hit by Colter on the run knocked
Ennis out of the game with a mild concus
sion, however, and Johnson came back in.
On his second play, Johnson hit Brad
Muster cruising toward the end zone for a
29-yard score.
"1 had Brad doing a post route over the
middle, and he ran a little wider than

usuai," Johnson said. "1 had enough time
to wait for him and put it over everybody
iuiu ii»w end zone."
Stanford then went for the two-point
conversion and failed for the third straight
time, leaving the score 39-24.
"USC built up a big lead and we had to
come back being down by 22 at the half,"
said Muster, who picked up 72 yards and a
touchdown on 19 carries and caught six
passes for 103 yards and another score.
"We got some momentum the second half
but didn't score that one series and they
came back and did score. We needed full
momentum the second half and didn't
have it."
Nevertheless, the Cardinal outgained
the Trojans in total offense 447 yards to
417, ran 32 more plays, held the ball over
nine minutes longer and picked up eight
more first downs than USC.
"We had an efficient offense," Smith
said, "and though they weren't on the
field very often, we scored 39 points and
you have to be thankful for that."
The Trojan offense was particularly effi
cient in the first half, when Peete con
nected with second-string receiver John
Jackson for scores of 28, 26 and 7 yards
and hit Leroy Holt with a 39-yard strike.
"He's one of the best quarterbacks
we've faced," Stanford linebacker Barry
McKeever said. "When he's hot, he's a
great quarterback, and for some reason he
always seems to have his best games
against Stanford."
Card notes
Star Stanford receiver Jeff James had to
leave the game late in the first quarter with a
pulled groin muscle. It is not known how long
he will be out.
