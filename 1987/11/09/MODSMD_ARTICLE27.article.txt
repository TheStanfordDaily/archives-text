## Trojan air attack bombs Card, 39-24 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES â€” The Stanford Cardinal out
distanced the USC Trojans in nearly every offen
sive category but points Saturday at the L.A.
Coliseum. But for the second week in a row, the op
posing quarterback and a free safety with the initials
C.C. destroyed the Cardinal's opportunities.
USC's 39-24 victory before a crowd of 58,992 and
a national television audience kept the Trojans in
the Rose Bowl race with rival UCLA. The Trojans
now have a record of 6-3 overall and 5-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, while UCLA, which crushed
Oregon State Saturday, has a 6-0 conference mark.
The two teams meet at USC Nov. 21.
Meanwhile, the loss dropped Stanford to 3-6
overall and 2-4 in the league, eliminating all hopes
for a winning season.
USC junior Rodney Peete was the latest in a long
line of quarterbacks to have a career game against
Stanford this season, finishing 17 of 20 passing for
273 yards and five touchdowns.
"Jesus Christ, I don't think we've seen a bad one
(quarterback)," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"They all do good against us.
"Peete is very dangerous, though," he said. "He
throws extremely well on the run and had a very
consistent, accurate day. Did he miss any, or were
they all complete?"
Peete's live TD passes set a USC single-game
record, and during the contest the junior also
became the Trojans' all-time leading passer with
355 career completions." Rodney Peete had an out
standing game," USC Coach Larry Smith said.
"Anythime you have a quarterback throw five
touchdown passes, you know he's doing a fabulous
job."
Sophomore free safety Cleveland Colter also did
a fabulous job, picking off three Brian Johnson
passes to pick up right where Arizona's Chuck
Cecil (four interceptions) left off last week.
"Cecil had four picks last week, and I was trying
to catch him," said Colter, who also recorded seven
tackles, a fumble recovery and gained 40 yards on
two kickoff returns. "I saw on the films that he was
jumping everything, so I tried it and 1 got lucky,
too."
Colter's third theft of the day proved to be the
most crushing blow to the Stanford offense. The
Cardinal had come back from a 28-6 halftime deficit
with two touchdowns to make the score 31-18 early
in the fourth quarter, and after a successful onsides
kick, Stanford was driving toward the Trojan end
zone.
