# Johnson holds key to future

LOS ANGELES — Part two of the "Making of a
Stanford Quarterback," starring redshirt freshman
Brian Johnson, took place Saturday, but it's still too
early to predict how the saga is going to end.
Johnson threw for 312 yards against the USC
Trojans, but also threw three interceptions to free
safety Cleveland Colter that ensured the USC 39-24
victory.
Johnson had glided through his first three starts
as the Cardinal quarterback (victories over Wash
ington State, San Diego State and Oregon) until he
met Arizona's free safety, Chuck Cecil, two weeks
ago. Cecil picked off four Johnson passes during the
Wildcat victory.
Thus Saturday's contest was supposed to be a
test of Johnson's character — his first chance to
rebound from a loss and his first foray into Los An
geles football country. Unfortunately for Johnson,
the result was another a loss and more interceptions
by the opposing team's free safety.
"I've got to see what the films say (about the in
terceptions)," Johnson said. "1 don't know what it
is, but it's got to stop."
Colter, on the other hand, knew exactly why
Johnson was throwing interceptions.
"He looked where he was going to throw every
time," Colter explained. "I was just trying to catch
his eyes before the ball. What took all their drives
away were the big plays — the interceptions."
Indeed, Stanford controlled the ball well on of
fense most of the game — the Cardinal had the ball
for 34 minutes and 50 seconds, compared to USC's
25 minutes, 10 seconds — and Johnson rarely
looked panicked at the offensive helm.
Even though the freshman quarterback hasn't
quite come through in the clutch recently, however,
his teammates still have a lot of confidence in him.
"He's going to be a great one," Cardinal center
Andy Sinclair said. "I think he's a great one now —
we've just got to execute better as a team."
Sinclair thinks people make too much out of the
interceptions.
"Hey, John Elway still throws interceptions. It's
just part of the game," he said. "If you're a quarter
back, you're going to throw them."
