# Johnson holds key to future

LOS ANGELES — Part two of the "Making of a
Stanford Quarterback," starring redshirt freshman
Brian Johnson, took place Saturday, but it's still too
early to predict how the saga is going to end.
Johnson threw for 312 yards against the USC
Trojans, but also threw three interceptions to free
safety Cleveland Colter that ensured the USC 39-24
victory.
Johnson had glided through his first three starts
as the Cardinal quarterback (victories over Wash
ington State, San Diego State and Oregon) until he
met Arizona's free safety, Chuck Cecil, two weeks
ago. Cecil picked off four Johnson passes during the
Wildcat victory.
Thus Saturday's contest was supposed to be a
test of Johnson's character — his first chance to
rebound from a loss and his first foray into Los An
geles football country. Unfortunately for Johnson,
the result was another a loss and more interceptions
by the opposing team's free safety.
"I've got to see what the films say (about the in
terceptions)," Johnson said. "1 don't know what it
is, but it's got to stop."
Colter, on the other hand, knew exactly why
Johnson was throwing interceptions.
"He looked where he was going to throw every
time," Colter explained. "I was just trying to catch
his eyes before the ball. What took all their drives
away were the big plays — the interceptions."
Indeed, Stanford controlled the ball well on of
fense most of the game — the Cardinal had the ball
for 34 minutes and 50 seconds, compared to USC's
25 minutes, 10 seconds — and Johnson rarely
looked panicked at the offensive helm.
Even though the freshman quarterback hasn't
quite come through in the clutch recently, however,
his teammates still have a lot of confidence in him.
"He's going to be a great one," Cardinal center
Andy Sinclair said. "I think he's a great one now —
we've just got to execute better as a team."
Sinclair thinks people make too much out of the
interceptions.
"Hey, John Elway still throws interceptions. It's
just part of the game," he said. "If you're a quarter
back, you're going to throw them."
Johnson could have picked
better times to throw the
wayward passes — each inter
ception ended a Stanford scoring
threat. But he never dwelled on
his mistakes.
"Brian Johnson did so many
good things today. The mistakes
came when he was being aggres
sive," Stanford Coach Jack El
way said after the game. "Each
time he calmed down and started
over again."
Johnson's first interception
came at the end of the first half,
and he responded right away in
the second half by leading the
C ardinal on an 83-yard scoring
drive to cut the Trojan lead to 28-
12. He came back after his
second interception to drive an
other 81 yards for a touchdown.
"Brian is a helluva leader,"
Stanford guard Chuck Gilling
ham said. "We don't fail to move
the ball with him. He's not afraid
to take the ball down and run it
and take the hit. You gotta like
that, especially when you're ban
ging your head for him all day."
I he Stanford offense certainly
has confidence in its young
leader. Although the Cardinal
trailed by 22 points at halftime on
enemy territory, the team came
out fighting in the second half.
"At halftime someone was
mentioning the Gator Bowl
(Stanford trailed by a similar
score to Clemson and almost
came from behind to win), and
there was never any doubt in
Brian that we could do it," Gil
lingham said.
Despite the loss on the
scoreboard, Johnson gained
some valuable experience Satur
day. He hopes to be a Cardinal
quarterback for the long haul.
Remember that two years ago
Trojan quarterback Rodney
Peete was facing similar prob
lems.
"Initially I'm upset because I
made mistakes," Johnson said.
"After a while 1 try to rationalize
— say it's because I'm inexperi
enced. I've got to let it go and
play next week. Mistakes are
going to happen. Unfortunately
for us, today they were critical."
