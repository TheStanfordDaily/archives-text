# Cardinal trounces USC, bows to UCLA in OT
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
You know things are going
well when you pick up momen
tum from a loss.
While most Cardinal fans were
traveling to Southern California
for fun and football, the No. 5
Stanford water polo team was on
a less-relaxing roadtrip that in
cluded games against No. 4
UCLA Friday and No. 2 USC
Saturday.
I'he Bruins (23-6) downed the
Cardinal (19-6) in overtime 12-11,
but Stanford came back the next
day to oust USC (17-7) by a 9-5
score. In addition, this weekend,
UCLA defeated No. H UC-Santa
Barbara and USC lost to No. 3
UC-lrvine, 12-6.
Based on last weekend's per
formances, Stanford comes back
to the Farm with the feeling that
it is hitting its peak at the perfect
time. The final regular season
game is the Big Splash versus
California, and then it's on to the
NCAA championships over

Thanksgiving weekend at Long
Beach, where Stanford is looking
to win its third straight national
title, and its seventh in the last 13
years.
"We finally are starting to get
it together," freshman Colin
Keely said. "We played really
well in the tournament at the
start of the season, hut since then
we've been in a lull."
"We were down for most of
the UCLA game, but we kept
coming back," junior Jeff Oeding
said. "Usually when we've been
down a couple goals, we've
started to fold. The attitude was a
lot better (against UCLA),
nobody ever gave up."
So despite the loss, the Cardi
nal came out of Friday's match
with reason to believe that its
season was on the upswing. Last
weekend's four wins in five
games hinted at this trend, but
did not quite prove it because of
the relatively weak competition
Saturday's trouncing of the
second-ranked Trojans indisput
ably forecasts a bull market for

Stanford water polo.
Friday afternoon, the Bruins
jumped out to a lead which they
alternately lost and then built
back up right to the final buzzer
in overtime. Three goals from
Cardinal Grant Stanley, his third
hat trick in the past six matches,
along with two tallies each from
Erich Fischer and Bob Abbott
and one each from Erik Blum and
Matt Tingler put Stanford within
one goal of the Bruins with about
30 seconds left in regulation. The
Cardinal had the ball and one
possession to tie it up.
Stanford failed, and with 15
seconds on the clock, UCLA
needed only to play a good game
of keep away to win. As the
seconds ticked away, Oeding
started down towards the UCI.A
cage, in case of the impossible.
No UCLA player followed him
â€” that was the host's first
mistake.
With less than 10 seconds
remaining, a Bruin carried the


Benjamin long, Daily
Rebounding from a 12-11 overtime loss to UCLA hriday, senior Krich Fischer exploded for four goals Satur
day to lead Stanford to victory over No. 2 L'SC.
