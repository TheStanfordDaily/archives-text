# Cardinal trounces USC, bows to UCLA in OT
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
You know things are going
well when you pick up momen
tum from a loss.
While most Cardinal fans were
traveling to Southern California
for fun and football, the No. 5
Stanford water polo team was on
a less-relaxing roadtrip that in
cluded games against No. 4
UCLA Friday and No. 2 USC
Saturday.
I'he Bruins (23-6) downed the
Cardinal (19-6) in overtime 12-11,
but Stanford came back the next
day to oust USC (17-7) by a 9-5
score. In addition, this weekend,
UCLA defeated No. H UC-Santa
Barbara and USC lost to No. 3
UC-lrvine, 12-6.
Based on last weekend's per
formances, Stanford comes back
to the Farm with the feeling that
it is hitting its peak at the perfect
time. The final regular season
game is the Big Splash versus
California, and then it's on to the
NCAA championships over

Thanksgiving weekend at Long
Beach, where Stanford is looking
to win its third straight national
title, and its seventh in the last 13
years.
"We finally are starting to get
it together," freshman Colin
Keely said. "We played really
well in the tournament at the
start of the season, hut since then
we've been in a lull."
"We were down for most of
the UCLA game, but we kept
coming back," junior Jeff Oeding
said. "Usually when we've been
down a couple goals, we've
started to fold. The attitude was a
lot better (against UCLA),
nobody ever gave up."
So despite the loss, the Cardi
nal came out of Friday's match
with reason to believe that its
season was on the upswing. Last
weekend's four wins in five
games hinted at this trend, but
did not quite prove it because of
the relatively weak competition
Saturday's trouncing of the
second-ranked Trojans indisput
ably forecasts a bull market for

Stanford water polo.
Friday afternoon, the Bruins
jumped out to a lead which they
alternately lost and then built
back up right to the final buzzer
in overtime. Three goals from
Cardinal Grant Stanley, his third
hat trick in the past six matches,
along with two tallies each from
Erich Fischer and Bob Abbott
and one each from Erik Blum and
Matt Tingler put Stanford within
one goal of the Bruins with about
30 seconds left in regulation. The
Cardinal had the ball and one
possession to tie it up.
Stanford failed, and with 15
seconds on the clock, UCLA
needed only to play a good game
of keep away to win. As the
seconds ticked away, Oeding
started down towards the UCI.A
cage, in case of the impossible.
No UCLA player followed him
— that was the host's first
mistake.

remaining, a Bruin carried the

ball towards (he Stanford goal —
that was the second. Then, ac
cording to Stanford Coach Dante
Dettamanti, "the UCI.A player
realized he shouldn't he there,
and he hesitated." Abbott
pounced, knocking the ball out of
UCLA's possession to Fischer.
The Stanford senior looked up
to see Oeding just beyond the
midline and passed the ball over

his teammate's head towards
Bruin goalkeeper Chris Landsea.
Oeding caught up to the pass
and was all alone, six meters
from the cage. Turning to check
the game clock, he saw it left
only two seconds. Oeding spun
back around, shot and scored.
The ball landed in the cage after
the buzzer had sounded.
"The feeling on the bench
(after Oeding's goal) was that we
were going to go on and win,"
Keely said.
Indeed, the Cardinal started
the overtime period "smoking,"

according to Oeding, and scored
early to go up 11-10. However,
despite many scoring oppor
tunites over the remaining
minutes, Stanford could not
score again. UCLA tied it with
less than two minutes remaining
after what Dettamanti called "a
questionable ejection" of one of
the Cardinal. With nine seconds
left. Bruin sophomore Alexis
Rousseau scored the game win
ner.
"(The UCLA game) really
showed the guys that we're as
good as any team in the

country," Dettamanti said. "It
gave us a lot of confidence and I
think it got the guys a little
mad.
And he was right. The Cardinal
stormed ahead 4-1 and, Det
tamanti said, USC "never got
into the game." Fischer contin
ued to prove that he is perhaps
the nation s top player, scoring
four goals. Oeding scored three
and Stanley and Blum each had
one.
Stanford's offensive play
against USC and UCLA signaled
the complete regeneration of its

scoring power. "We really ad
justed our shooting, we're start
ing to score goals," Dettamanti
said. "We got our shooting touch
back, plus we took smart shots."
Dettamanti suspects that USC
was a little too comfortable with
its high ranking, which he felt the
Trojans didn't deserve. "They
were enjoying their rating. They
felt like all they had to do was
show up and the other team
would roll over in front of
them. . . . That's too bad we
ruined their homecoming week
end."
