# Rash of thefts plagues Row houses
## 
### Deanna Terzian 
Just one week after Row Office
Coordinator Gary de Jauregui
put out a warning to residents to
take extra precautions against
possible burglaries, at least nine
of the houses on the Row were
victimized in a sudden rash of
crime last week.
Break-ins were reported at Phi
Sig. Roth, La Maison Francaise,
353 Campus, Columbae, Hurl
burt. Synergy. Kappa Alpha and
Grove Mayneld.
Late last week, Stanford

Police apprehended a suspect
linked to at least three of the
crimes. The suspect was de
scribed by police as being a black
male between 35 and 40 years old
with no facial hair and no glasses,
according to senior Michelle
Stewart, one of the burglary vic
tims. The police said the suspect
was involved in thefts at Phi Sig,
Koth and La Maison Francaise.
The police have no other
suspects in custody at this time
and would not say whether the
rest of the crimes are connected
or whether the suspect now in

custody is involved with the
other crimes, according to a
police officer who declined to
give his name.
A wallet was stolen from an
unlocked room in Phi Sig
Thursday afternoon. Later that
day the suspect was ap
prehended. and a checkbook ot a
resident in the French House and
a check to a resident in Roth
were discovered in his posses
sion.
Stewart, a Roth resident, said
she had not received her mail in a
week. " The police called me up

and said they had mom's check
to me, but 1 had never seen the
check."
Stewart said she w as told later
by Roth resident assistant Julie
Taylor that mail addressed to her
had been delivered during the
week when she thought she
received no mail.
Residents of both Synergy and
Kappa Alpha had stereo equip
ment stolen. Three burglars
climbed through an open window
in Kappa Alpha at about I a.m.
Friday, cut the stereo cords and
left very quickly, according to
Resident Assistant Rob Reid.
"Someone from It he Alpha Delt
fraternity next door] saw them
leave and shouted to them,"
Reid said. "They became scared
and dropped the equipment," at
which point it was recovered.
Senior Fric Rau, a Columbae
resident, had a camera, pocket
knife and some change stolen
from his room Tuesday. The
room's door and window were
both open, according to Rau's
roommate, sophomore Jay
Hayman. The police told Rau
that his chances of getting his
belongings back were "nil,"
Hayman said.

Wednesday afternoon, an un
usual crime took place at 353
Campus. A burglar apparently
came through an unlocked win
dow of a resident's room and
stole six sweaters, according to
the victim, sophomore Frank
Quaratiello. The burglar did not
touch the camera or the Macin
tosh computer that were clearly
visible in the room.
On Friday, a break-in occured
at the Hurlburt kitchen. Nothing
was stolen and Resident Assis
tant James Driscoll said he
thought the break-in "was more
a prank than anything else."
However, an attempted break-in
at Grove Mayfield's kitchen was
also reported to have occurred
Friday.
In every burglary in the past
week, the burglar entered
through an unlocked window or
door.
