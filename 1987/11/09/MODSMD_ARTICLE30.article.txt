The streak is back up to two.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team, whose school-record,
14-match winning streak was
snapped last Tuesday by second
ranked Pacific, rebounded this
weekend by posting a pair of key
conference wins at Maples
Pavilion. Friday night the third
ranked Cardinal defeated No. 14
Oregon, 15-10, 15-4, 15-12, then
Stanford downed Oregon State
by a 15-7, 15-5, 13-15, 15-3 score
Saturday.
The Ducks, after a loss to Cali
fornia Saturday, are now 13-9, 9-
f> and in fifth place in the Pacific
-10 Conference, while the
Beavers are 3-20, 0-15 in the Pac
-10. Stanford ran its record to 21-4
for the year, and the Cardinal is
13-1 in conference play, good for
sole possession of first place.
Only three other teams have a
chance to catch the Cardinal:
UCLA, USC and California. The
Bruins had the week off from
league play, leaving them at 10-3,
while the Bears arc in third at 10-
4. The Trojans also plaved only
non-conference matcnes this
weekend and remain at 9-4. Stan

ford's magic number (any combi
nation of Stanford wins and an
opponent's* losses) to eliminate
UCLA is down to three, while it
is at one for the Bears and two
for the Trojans.
Oregon's twin losses took
away their last hope of winning
the title.
"1 though it wfcs a good
weekend," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "I wanted to let
everyone play."
All 10 players on the active
roster did play over the weekend
as Stanford had few problems in
running its home Pac-10 record
to 16-0 over the two-year history
of the league. The Ducks were
expected to be a big challenge
Friday night, but Oregon was
never able to get it together.
Oregon Coach Gerry Gregory
was somewhat unhappy with his
team s inconsistent play. "I
thought Stanford played well . .
and forced us to play below our
potential," he said. "Against a
good team it'll kill you if you
have mental lapses."
