The streak is back up to two.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team, whose school-record,
14-match winning streak was
snapped last Tuesday by second
ranked Pacific, rebounded this
weekend by posting a pair of key
conference wins at Maples
Pavilion. Friday night the third
ranked Cardinal defeated No. 14
Oregon, 15-10, 15-4, 15-12, then
Stanford downed Oregon State
by a 15-7, 15-5, 13-15, 15-3 score
Saturday.
The Ducks, after a loss to Cali
fornia Saturday, are now 13-9, 9-
f> and in fifth place in the Pacific
-10 Conference, while the
Beavers are 3-20, 0-15 in the Pac
-10. Stanford ran its record to 21-4
for the year, and the Cardinal is
13-1 in conference play, good for
sole possession of first place.
Only three other teams have a
chance to catch the Cardinal:
UCLA, USC and California. The
Bruins had the week off from
league play, leaving them at 10-3,
while the Bears arc in third at 10-
4. The Trojans also plaved only
non-conference matcnes this
weekend and remain at 9-4. Stan

ford's magic number (any combi
nation of Stanford wins and an
opponent's* losses) to eliminate
UCLA is down to three, while it
is at one for the Bears and two
for the Trojans.
Oregon's twin losses took
away their last hope of winning
the title.
"1 though it wfcs a good
weekend," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "I wanted to let
everyone play."
All 10 players on the active
roster did play over the weekend
as Stanford had few problems in
running its home Pac-10 record
to 16-0 over the two-year history
of the league. The Ducks were
expected to be a big challenge
Friday night, but Oregon was
never able to get it together.
Oregon Coach Gerry Gregory
was somewhat unhappy with his
team s inconsistent play. "I
thought Stanford played well . .
and forced us to play below our
potential," he said. "Against a
good team it'll kill you if you
have mental lapses."

nation in blocking, averaging
over two per game, but against
the C animal she only came up
with one block in the three-game
match. Stanford senior middle
blocker Nancy Reno led the at
tack, recording 15 kills to go with
a .393 hittimg percentage.
Senior leresa .Smith chipped
in 10 kills, while junior Amy
Hayes had eight as the Cardinal
outhit the Ducks .314 to .107.
"Smith and Reno killed us,"
Gregory said.
The Oregon offense was al
most non-existant as a strong
Cardinal block channelled the
Ducks' hitters, allowing the Stan
ford diggers to come up with
several balls.
"Our defense was really well
organized, our blocking was
really good," sophomore Jenny
Chaffee said.
Oregon senior Teri Kramer,
who led the nation in kills last
year, was held to only 10 kills

and a . 160 percentage, while Mic
hele Krebsbach, the Pac-10
Freshman-of-the-Year in 1986,
had four kills and a -.063
percentage.
Krejcha also hit for a negative
percentage (-.038), thanks in part
to Laura Olesen's five blocks for
the match. Smith headed the
floor defense, coming up with 12
digs, while Hayes added 11, and
sophomore Lara Asper and
senior Wendi Rush had 10
apiece. Kramer led the visitors
with 11.
"Our blocking and defense
were really good," Asper said.
"I thought we played well
against Oregon."
"They seemed to be kind of
flat," Shaw said of the Ducks.
"They never seemed to get into
the match. (Also) we played
well."
Stanford was in control from
start to finish. The Cardinal
jumped out to a 10-3 lead in game
one, and while Oregon tried to
creep back into the game, the
Cardinal was able to shut the
door at 15-10.
The second game was a differ

ent story, as Stanford just rolled
over the Ducks. The Cardinal
was scoring points three and four
at a time, and little more than 10
minutes after the game began, it
was over on an ace by freshman
Tracy Hughes.
The third game was the
closest, but again Stanford
cruised to leads of 8-3, 12-7 and
14-K. The Ducks rallied for four
more points on three kills and a
block from Kramer and Stepha
nie Drier, but Stanford's Chaffee
came up with her second kill in
only two attempts on the night to
end it.
The following night against
Oregon State went much the
same for the Cardinal. The
Beavers are in last place in the
Pac-10 with their 0-15 mark, but
the team started four freshmen
Saturday night, making them ap
pear to be a team to be reckoned
with in the future. Right now,
however, Oregon State is not in
the same category as Stanford.
Shaw sent out a different
lineup against the Beavers, res
ting Asper and her sore knee and
starting Chaffee as an outside hit

ter. He also had Smith switch
from the right to the left side.
First-year Oregon State Coach
Guy Enriques had his players
ready to face the overpowering
Cardinal, and the Beavers were
not intimidated.
With Enriques telling all his
players to "go for it" as they
went back to serve, the Beavers'
nothing-to-lose attitude produced
many errors, hut it also resulted
in some problems for the Cardi
nal. Specifically, freshman Julie
Leamon recorded four aces with
out a single miss with her high
velocity topspin serve, and
senior Tami Good tallied a
match-high 17 kills.
Despite the inspired Beaver
play, the Cardinal was able to
keep Oregon State down, except
in the third game. Shaw used this
game for even more ex
perimentation than the other
games, resting Rush and allowing
Asper to set for the first time
since last September.
Since Asper regularly starts as
an outside hitter, she does not get
any time to work on her setting in
practice. She did a good job,

however, recording 14 assists
and a good .412 setting
percentage in that game.
"It's hard to switch from
thinking like a hitter to thinking
like a setter," Asper said, adding
that "playing a different position
will ultimately help my setting."
The experience she gained will
likely pay off next year after
Rush's graduation.
After the close loss in game
three, Shaw returned Rush to the
lineup and the fourth game was
another Stanford blowout. The
hero on this night was Chaffee,
who took advantage of her start
ing role to produce a team-high
12 kills and .550 hitting
percentage.
"I'm always excited about
playing, period, and starting is
great," Chaffee said. She hit .591
for the weekend's two matches,
running her team-leading hitting
percentage to .305 for the season.
Just being on the same team
as Teresa (Smith) and (Nancy)
Reno gives an edge to the other
hitters," Chaffee added. "The
other team concentrates on
them, and with Wendi's

(deceptive) setting, I'll often get
only one blocker, or no one, up
(blocking her). It gives me more
options."
Reno also had 12 kills for the
Cardinal, hitting .476, while
Olesen added 10 and a .500 mark.
Smith recorded nine kills and a
.412 hitting percentage in limited
playing time.
The Cardinal now has only six
more matches remaining on the
schedule. Stanford travels to
Arizona Friday night, and visits
Arizona State Saturday in two
more Pac-10 contests. "I'm
really excited about this
weekend," Asper said. "1 hope
we win the Pac-10."
With two wins this weekend,
the league title will be nearly
clinched. The final word,
however, will come when
second-place UCLA and fourth
place USC come to Maples
Pavilion Nov. 19 and 20,
respectively. Following those
two matches, the Cardinal goes
to Hawaii to play two matches
against the top-ranked Rainbow
Wahines over Thanksgiving.
