# Stanford upends Cal 1-0 at Maloney Field
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Once again the home field advantage
was the key in the soccer version of Big
Game.
For the past four seasons the home
team has won the intense Stanford-
California contest, and this year's game
was no exception.
Coming out of its late-season tailspin,
the Cardinal defeated the Bears 1-0 yes
terday in its last home game of the year to
regain the Battle of the Bay title. With the
win, Stanford has ensured that it will
finish no lower than .500 on the year.
With one game to play, Stanford has a 9-
8-3 tally and is 3-2 in Pacific Soccer Con
ference play.
The Cardinal's lone score Sunday
came on a follow-up shot by senior for
ward Ross Torres 13-and-a-half minutes
into the game. Fullback Tim Westergren
set up the strike with a potent shot across
the front of the goal.
With strong defense, Stanford was able
to maintain its narrow lead for the
remaining 76 minutes of the contest.
Although the Cardinal had only a one
goal margin of victory, Stanford
dominated Cal in a game that was not as
close as the score indicated. The Cardinal
controlled the pace of the entire first half
and much of the second. Stanford was
able to maneuver around the Bears'
defenders at will, although the muddy
condition of the field made it difficult for
any player to be in complete control .
"We were able to move the ball on
them pretty well although we didn't have
a great game," Stanford Coach Sam

Koch said.
Stanford presented an offensive threat
from the opening whistle to the game s
end, taking nine shots on goal and contin
ually harrassing Cal's goalie.
"We had some great chances to put the
ball away but couldn't," Koch said. "But
we came through on one really good op
portunity ."
Stanford, however, lost some of its mo
mentum during the second period. The
offense looked tired and played sloppy,
and the team played to protect its lead
rather than attempt to increase the score.
But the strategy worked, as Stanford's
defense rose to the occasion and shut out
the Bears.
"Although Cal wasn't as good as some
of the squads we have faced, it was our
best game defensively since midseason,"
defender Mark Semioli said.
According to Koch, the Cardinal didn't
give Cal many scoring chances, and ef
fectively carried out Stanford's strategy. -
"I stressed defense during botrf*
pregame and at half time," he said. "The
defenders did what we asked of them. I
was really pleased."
"The team has gotten back its consis
tency," senior co-captain Pat Sheehy
said. "We kept our heads and played as a
unit."
For the first time since Stanford played
Vermont Sept. 8, Alan Branson was acti
vated as goalie. Koch substitued the
senior for starting keeper Chris Helling
during halftime. Branson, playing in his
third game of the season, successfully
shut out the Bears and saved Cal's only
threatening shot on the first play of the
second period.
