## 
### David Earnest Staff writer 
It" this weekend's action was
any indication, the Stanford
women's tennis team will be a
national power once again this
season. Impressive singles and
doubles performances in the
Rolex Northern California
Women's Collegiate Tennis
Championships displayed the
Cardinal's depth and all-around
strength.
The tournament is "a sort of
report card for the fall," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said. "It's
a check-through to see how
everyone is playing and a chance
to build some experience."
In the singles competition,
Stanford dominated the field with
five quarterfinalists and three
semifinalists. Junior Eleni Ros
sides, the No. 2 seed, stormed
through her early-round matches
to a quarterfinals matchup with
the tournament's sixth seed,
Karen Shin of California.
Rossides advanced to the semi
finals by defeating Shin, 6-4, 7-6.
Freshman Sandra Birch lost in
the second round.
After downing Shin, Rossides
then faced Cal's Alissa Finer
man. Finerman, who in the third
round upset fifth-seeded team
mate Jean Marie Lozano, chal
lenged Rossides, taking the
match to three sets. But Finer
man bowed to Rossides, 3-6, 6-3,
6-4.
Stanford freshman Tami
Whitlinger, the tournament's
top-seeded player, is the other
finalist. Whitlinger advanced by
default through the quarterfinals
after teammate Kay Tittle
withdrew. Whitlinger's opponent
in the semifinals was twin sister
Teri Whitlinger, whom she
defeated, 6-2, 6-2.
Because of yesterday's ex

tended play, Rossides and
Whitlinger will play their finals
match this week, with the date
and time to be announced.
Brennan was pleased with the
play of his team, especially that
of its new members.
Stanford's freshmen "had
great credentials coming in,"
Brennan said. "Tami did very
well. Sandra (Birch) probably
didn't do as well as she would
have liked. Some freshmen take
a little longer to develop."
Brennan was also happy to see
the return of Rossides, who sat
out last season.
"1 am particularly pleased with
Eleni's play," Brennan said. "It
was nice to see her back from all
her injuries from last year. She
looks like she is going to be 100
percent this year. Eleni will be a
big plus for us this year."
Stanford's doubles tandems
also played well, but were
eliminated before the finals. The
sister duo of Whitlinger and
Whitlinger, the pre-tournament
favorite and the top-seeded team,
dominated the early rounds
before being eliminated in the
semifinals by Cal's team of Tif
fany Silveria and Sharon
Fletcher. The fourth-seeded
team beat the Whitlingers, 6-2, 4-
6, 6-3.
The other semifinals match
featured another Cal-Stanford
matchup, this time between Stan
ford's Lisa Green and Cindy
Buchsbaum and Cal's Jean Marie
Lozano and Alissa Finerman.
Finerman and Lozano, the tour
nament's second-seeded team,
upended Green and Buchsbaum,
6-4, 6-7, 6-3.
The doubles finals pitting
Finerman and Lozano against
Silverian and Fletch was also a
casualty of time Sunday. It has
been rescheduled to be played
later this week.
