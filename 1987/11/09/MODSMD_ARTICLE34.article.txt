# Policy targets harassment
## Student IDs required for admission to Meyer since summer 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
The rule requiring students to
present a student ID card to enter
Meyer Library was adopted this
summer in an effort to reduce the
number of incidents of sexual
harrassment occurring there and
to decrease the burden on the li
brary's resources, according to
library personnel.
Prior to the implementation of
the new rule this summer,
anyone could enter the library
without identification.
Women using the library com
plained on numerous occasions
of being harassed by men staring
at them or exposing themselves,
Meyer Librarian Susan Perry
said. According to Perry, 80 per
cent of the men who were caught
in connection with such incidents
were not Stanford students.
"We ran one man out twice in
one week," Perry said. "I
wanted the building to be a safe
place to study in."
Director of Police Marvin Her
rington said that Meyer was one
of the very few college libraries
that allowed open access and that
"libraries are . . . notorious" for
harassment problems like the
ones reported at Meyer.
Herrington said that to some
degree, there will always be
"troublesome people just hang
ing around" Meyer.
The University Committee on
Libraries approved the identifi
cation requirement last spring in
response to concerns that too
many people outside of Stanford
had been using the library and its
resources, according to library
personnel.

"Meyer (was being) used by
outside people so much that it in
terfered with Stanford students
using the library," said Green Li
brary Operations Manager Rob
Mattos.
The identification requirement
was initiated during the summer
quarter to "get it up and running
to cause the least amount of in
convenience" in the regular aca
demic year. Perry said.
Under the current policy,
monitors will not accept meal
cards or keys as substitutes for
student IDs.
"The student ID is considered
your valid pass. . . . It's like
your driver's license (when you
want to drive a car)," Mattos

said.
Students who forget their ID
cards may obtain a courtesy pass
for the day from the privileges
window in the foyer of Green Li
brary for btoh libraries.
Perry reported "few com
plaints" with the new system and
said that especially women were
happy about the new rule.
Craig Hammond, a portal mon
itor at Meyer, said that the initial
reaction to the new rule was
somewhat negative. "At first
there was a lot of surprise . . .
and hostility and anger," he said.
But "when people realize (the
purpose of the policy), rnost
people have no problem with it,"
he said.
