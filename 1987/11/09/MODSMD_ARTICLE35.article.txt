Renovations for Meyer Li
brary, projected to cost between
$6 million and $10 million, are
scheduled to begin later this aca
demic year.
The improvements are part of
the undergraduate library's plan
to become a "high-tech' 5 library
within five years, according to
Meyer Librarian Susan Perry.
The renovations will focus on
making Meyer a "teaching
support, curriculum-support li
brary," Perry said.
In 1983, University Director of
Libraries David Weber and Dean
of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee began a study on
how Meyer Library could "meet
the needs and opportunities of

Stanford undergraduate educa
tion during the remainder of the
20th century."
The ensuing report recom
mended in 1986 that Meyer un
dertake a "renewal program"
that Perry explained as an at
tempt to "improve the intellec
tual environment within the li
brary, upgrade and expand the li
brary's technology to meet infor
mation age standards and
renovate the building."
More specifically, renovations
will include creating varied kinds
of study spaces, sound proofing,
improved lighting, teaching
facilities, group study rooms and
carrels similar to those in Green
Library.
"I'm feeling very positive
about it," Perrv said.
