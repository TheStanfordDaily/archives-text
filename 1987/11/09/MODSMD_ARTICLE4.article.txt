Ronald Reagan's departure from the
presidency in 1989 will eliminate a pri
mary cause of conflict between the
Hoover Institution and Stanford. Since
1983, local Hoover critics have com
plained most about the partisan nature
of the institution's ties with the present
administration.

It will no longer matter that Reagan
has been an honorary Hoover fellow
since that many Reagan adminis
tration officials are Hoover fellows, or
that some administration policies are
based on Hoover ideas. Reagan's
departure will not, however, ensure a

smooth future for the Hoover-Stanford
relationship.
Significant questions remain con
cerning both the future of Hoover-
Stanford relations and what direction
the relationship should take. At pres
ent, there are two opposing views con
cerning its development: a "divorce"
between the two institutions and a path
of greater cooperation.
Advocates of divorce, led by Politi
cal Science Prof. John Manley and
Fnglish Prof. Ronald Rebholz. argue
that a separation of the institution from
Stanford is the only way to protect the
University's reputation and political
neutrality. Inherent problems underlie
any connection between Stanford and
Hoover, so separation is the only an
swer for improvement, they argue.
Manley was quick to point out that
parts of Hoover, including the library
and National Fellows Program, are un
objectionable. and that "the University
might lose some good things'* if
divorce became a reality. He stressed,
however, that the partisan nature of
many of the institution's activities jus
tifies severance.

"Divorce is the only answer," Man
ley said in a recent interview. "This is
a problem that cannot be reformed. No
university can afford to have within its
midst conservative or liberally inclined
partisan think tanks."
Talk of divorce has not been limited
exclusively to critics of Hoover. A
committee formed to evaluate the rela
tionship between Hoover and Stan
ford, headed by Sociology Prof. San
ford Dornbusch, released a report in
1985 recommending against immediate
divorce. But if relations failed to im
prove in the next several years, the
report said "divorce should be recon
sidered." '
The report evaluated the special
quasi-independent relationship Hoover
enjoys with Stanford. After the report
was issued, Hoover implemented
changes that resulted in Stanford fac
ulty members serving on ad hoc com
mittees that review potential research
fellows.
Those changes, however, did not in
clude the appointment of senior re
search fellows. Hoover still has

autonomy in making such ap
pointments and that fact contin
ues to he a source of contro
versy.
While stressing that it is not his
intent to criticize the quality of
senior research fellows,
Dornbusch said, "The structure
(concerning senior research fel
low appointments) has got to be
changed. That is why the present
conflict is endemic."
Although embracing most of
the recommendations of the
Dornbusch Committee, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
said he strongly disagreed with
"the assertion that divorce is a
viable alternative that might be
explored."

situation under
which the Board of
Trustees . . . should

academic assets off
of this University/

"I cannot envision a situation
under which the Board of Trus
tees, as responsible fiduciaries,
should consider a divorce that
would spin those extraordinary
academic assets off of this Uni
versity, and I cannot conceive of
a set of circumstances under
which I would advocate it,"
Kennedy said.

An even larger question mark
hangirib over the relationship's
future'lis related to Hoover Direc
tor W. Glenn Campbell. Camp
bell's caustic remarks have
alienated many faculty members
in the past and Campbell has
been blamed for making bad situ
ations worse.
Campbell, 62, has been suffer
ing from poor health recently,
leading to speculation he may
soon retire. This summer he un
derwent surgery to replace a
faulty mitral valve in his heart.
Campbell's departure would,
some argue, reduce tension be
tween the two institutions.
"Glenn Campbell has a vis
ceral need to render himself even
more intolerable than he nor
mally is," History Prof. Barton
Bernstein said recently. "Things
will get better when he leaves."
Others doubt that a change in
Hoover's leadership would
drastically alter the character of
the relationship.
"W. Glenn Campbell's de
parture tomorrow will not alter
[Hoover's] mission," Manley
said.
But Campbell has said publi
cally that he has no intention of
leaving soon. "People usually
feel much better after a mitral
valve operation than they did
before," he said. "1 am no ex
ception."
Advocates of divorce realize
that if severance does become a
reality, both institutions will
have to solve many problematic
issues.
For example, control over cer
tain collections in Hoover's li
brary is complex. The University
has partially funded many of
Hoover's recent acquisitions,
and the ownership of these col
lections will be a matter of
dispute. Another problem is that
approximately three-fourths of
Hoover's endowment is mixed
with University funds.
And the proponents of
severance also recognize that
divorce will probably not come
any time soon. Indeed, recently
there have been signs of greater
Hoover-Stanford cooperation,
and supporters say this coopera
tion is in the best interest of both
institutions.
As early as 1984, Campbell
wrote in a report addressing
Hoover's future: "Both the Uni
versity and the institution hus
band resources which, if mined
together, contain enormous
riches and present unparalleled
opportunities for development."
This opinion is shared by a
many Hoover fellows and many
Stanford professors. In a recent
interview, Dornbusch said an in
crease in cooperation between
Hoover and Stanford has taken
place over the past two years.
In addition, these advocates of
greater cooperation said that
there are many ways of achieving
this. For example, an increase in
the number of conferences
jointly sponsored by Hoover and
Stanford, greater consultation
between both institutions and an
increased collaboration in bring

ing distinguished scholars to
Stanford.
Hoover Principal Associate
Director John Cogan said he and
University Provost James Rosse
meet regularly to discuss the
needs of Hoover and Stanford,
including possibilities for future
cooperation.

has a visceral need
to render himself
more intolerable
than he normally is.

better when he
leaves/
— Barton Bernstein

But by far the most commonly
cited opportunity for greater
cooperation is joint appoint
ments.
According to Hoover's 1986
annual report reveals that 21 pro
fessors from Stanford depart
ments and schools held joint ap

pointments granted by Hoover
during 1985-86. By contrast,
Stanford extended only five ap
pointments to Hoover scholars
during the same period.
According to the report, that
imbalance "is the most important
and most troubling continuing
problem in the relations between
the Hoover Institution and the
rest of Stanford University."
"One net result of all of the
recent discussions about the rela
tionship (between Hoover and
Stanford) has been that those
groups have come to understand
one another and one another's
needs better," Kennedy said.
"As a consequence, I think the
prospects are significantly im
proved for integrating them more
closely in the future."
Believing that "the worst is be
hind us," Cogan claims that he
now "sees a bright future."
"I remain very optimistic
about the future of the Hoover
Institution and other parts of
Stanford University," he said.
While friction between the two
insitutions may be lessening, un
certainties continue to shroud the
Stanford-Hoover relationship.
The enduring conflict raises com
plex issues of academic objec
tivity and political partisanship,
intolerance of opinions and re
search bias. The future promises
to be no less controversial.
