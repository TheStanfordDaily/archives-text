Ronald Reagan's departure from the
presidency in 1989 will eliminate a pri
mary cause of conflict between the
Hoover Institution and Stanford. Since
1983, local Hoover critics have com
plained most about the partisan nature
of the institution's ties with the present
administration.

It will no longer matter that Reagan
has been an honorary Hoover fellow
since that many Reagan adminis
tration officials are Hoover fellows, or
that some administration policies are
based on Hoover ideas. Reagan's
departure will not, however, ensure a

smooth future for the Hoover-Stanford
relationship.
Significant questions remain con
cerning both the future of Hoover-
Stanford relations and what direction
the relationship should take. At pres
ent, there are two opposing views con
cerning its development: a "divorce"
between the two institutions and a path
of greater cooperation.
Advocates of divorce, led by Politi
cal Science Prof. John Manley and
Fnglish Prof. Ronald Rebholz. argue
that a separation of the institution from
Stanford is the only way to protect the
University's reputation and political
neutrality. Inherent problems underlie
any connection between Stanford and
Hoover, so separation is the only an
swer for improvement, they argue.
Manley was quick to point out that
parts of Hoover, including the library
and National Fellows Program, are un
objectionable. and that "the University
might lose some good things'* if
divorce became a reality. He stressed,
however, that the partisan nature of
many of the institution's activities jus
tifies severance.

"Divorce is the only answer," Man
ley said in a recent interview. "This is
a problem that cannot be reformed. No
university can afford to have within its
midst conservative or liberally inclined
partisan think tanks."
Talk of divorce has not been limited
exclusively to critics of Hoover. A
committee formed to evaluate the rela
tionship between Hoover and Stan
ford, headed by Sociology Prof. San
ford Dornbusch, released a report in
1985 recommending against immediate
divorce. But if relations failed to im
prove in the next several years, the
report said "divorce should be recon
sidered." '
The report evaluated the special
quasi-independent relationship Hoover
enjoys with Stanford. After the report
was issued, Hoover implemented
changes that resulted in Stanford fac
ulty members serving on ad hoc com
mittees that review potential research
fellows.
Those changes, however, did not in
clude the appointment of senior re
search fellows. Hoover still has
