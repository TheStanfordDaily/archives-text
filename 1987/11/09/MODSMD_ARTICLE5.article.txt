With the withdrawal of Judge
Douglas Ginsburg's nomination
to the Supreme Court, Judge An
thony Kennedy, a Stanford
alumnus, again heads the list of
possible nominees to fill the seat
vacated by Justice Lewis Powell
Jr.
Ginsburg withdrew his nomi
nation Saturday after admitting
he used marijuana as a professor
at Harvard Law School in the
19705. Kennedy, Ginsburg and
Federal Appeals Court Judge
William Wilkins all were finalists
after the Senate rejected Judge
Robert Bork. President Reagan's
first nominee.
Kennedy, who lives in
Sacramento, graduated from
Stanford in 1958 with a bache
lor's degree in political science.
He has two children currently en
rolled here â€” Kristen, a sopho
more, and Greg, a senior. His
oldest son, Justin, graduated
from Stanford in 1986.
Currently in Washington,
D C., Kennedy is scheduled to
meet with White House officials
tomorrow, according to Kristen.
Reagan is expected to an
nounce his nominee by mid
week. possibly as early as tomor
row, the Los Angeles Times re
ported today.
"He's anti-drug," Kristen said
in regard to her father's stance on
marijuana use.
When asked if her father had
ever used drugs, she said she had
"no idea, and I wouldn't want to
comment on it."
Political Science Prof. Robert
Horn, who taught Kennedy as an
undergraduate here and is a long
time family friend, said Kennedy
"never engaged in any kind of
questionable behavior to my
knowledge. I have the utmost
confidence in his character and
integrity."
Kristen said her family is opti
mistic about her father's possible
nomination, but that they do not
want to draw premature conclu
sions. "We don't want to get our
hopes too high. We're waiting to
see what happens," she said.
Horn classified Kennedy as
"basically conservative." Horn
added, however, that "he cer
tainly isn't a far-right extremist."
Kennedy has more judicial ex
perience and published opinions
than Ginsburg, Horn said. Ken
nedy has been on the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals for 11 years and
has written about 4(H) opinions,
he said.
Jack Friedenthal, associate
dean of the Law School and a
former colleague of Kennedy's,
said that Kennedy would be con

firmed "without any questions."
Kennedy has the ideal judicial
attitude, Friedenthal said. "He
doesn't reach out for issues," he
said. "He doesn t decide beyond
the case; he decides each case
before him."
"People have criticized him
for that, he said, noting that
Kennedy's restrained decisions
may have cost him the nomina
tion the first time.
Several of Kennedy's deci
sions have had important impli
cations for constitutional law,
Horn said. He cited Chadha vs.
