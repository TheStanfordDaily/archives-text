Calling Judge Douglas
Ginsburg "a very sensitive" and
"extremely intelligent" person,
Stanford professors who know
Ginsburg personally continued to
praise him Sunday despite his
withdrawal Saturday from con
sideration as a nominee for the
U.S. Supreme Court.
Ginsburg asked President
Reagan to withdraw his nomina
tion following the public clamor
about his use of marijuana when
he was a law professor at Har
vard University.
Law School Prof. William
Baxter, said he was not surprised
by Ginsburg's admission of mari
juana use. "I was not surprised
with his high crimes," he said.
"There must have been an enor
mous number of people who
smoked marijauna in the 19605."
Baxter, chief of the antitrust
division of the Justice Depart
ment from 1980-83, praised
Ginsburg, who served as a dep
uty attorney under him. "We had
adjoining offices and worked
with each other every day. He
was a very intelligent, quiet, very
sensitive person . . . and a fine
lawyer," Baxter said.
Baxter said that Reagan's
nomination of Ginsburg would
not have generated the tumult it
did if the administration were not
a "lame duck administration.
The anti-Ginsburg sentiment
was "an effort of the Democrats
to deprive the administration (of
a chance to appoint a new
justice) and capture it for the
next administration," he said.
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal
agreed that the attacks against
Ginsburg's personal life were un
fair. "Are they (the complaints
against Ginsburg) really relevant,
or just things to say about what
people did years ago?" Frieden
thal asked.
Friedenthal was a visiting pro
fessor at Harvard Law School in
1976, when Ginsburg was also
teaching there. Friedenthal said
that although they were not close
colleagues, he sympathized with
Ginsburg. "This is a terrible situ
ation where a news scandal just
does not give you a chance," he
said.

Economics Prof. A. Mitchell
Polinski, who also taught with
Ginsburg at Harvard, described
him as "an extremely intelligent,
compassionate and warm indi
vidual."
"I was disappointed that the
country did not hear his own
stance on substantive issues,''
Polinski said.
Law Prof. Tom Campbell said
that he and Ginsburg "kept in
close touch . . . for personal and
professional reasons" because
both were involved with antitrust
cases for the Justice Department.
Campbell said that in the wake
of the revelations about mari
juana use, Ginsburg was wise to
withdraw his name as a nominee.
"Given the president's ideas
on the use of drugs and the first
lady's ideas of the use of drugs, it
would have been difficult for him
to continue," Campbell said.
