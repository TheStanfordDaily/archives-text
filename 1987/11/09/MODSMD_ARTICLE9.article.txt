IRA bomb kills 11 near Belfast
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — A massive bomb, believed to
have been planted by the Irish Republican Army, killed II
people and injured 53 yesterday when it exploded without warn
ing in a crowd gathered for a memorial service for British war
dead.
The bombing, in the County Fermanagh town of Enniskillen,
about 80 miles west of Belfast, was the deadliest terrorist attack
in Northern Ireland in nearly five years.
The bomb exploded at 10:45 a.m. inside the town's commu
nity center, where nearly 500 people — mostly parents and their
children — had sought shelter from a driving rain. The blast,
from what authorities determined was a 30-pound bomb of
homemade explosives, occurred about five minutes before the
start of an annual Remembrance Day ceremony at a nearby war
memorial honoring soldiers from Northern Ireland who were
killed serving in the British forces during the two world wars.
Four of the dead were married couples, and 13 of the injured
were children between the ages of 2 and 15.
Those killed or injured were blown by the explosion against a
sidewalk railing and then trapped under rubble when a two-story
wall fell on them.
A cloud of dust filled the streets when the wall collapsed.
There was a moment of shocked silence. Then soldiers and
policemen, parents and children rushed to the rubble, tearing at
the broken brickwork with their bare hands to find survivors.
One of the young rescuers, searching through the rubble with
his bare hands, found the body of his mother.
No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but it was
believed to have been the work of the outlawed IRA.
The deaths Sunday bring to 87 this year's toll in the IRA's bat
tle to drive the British out of Northern Ireland. The violence has
killed about 2600 people in Northern Ireland in the past 18
years.
Release of ANC leader has impact
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Two key South African
Cabinet ministers said yesterday that the release last week of
Govan Mbeki, the chairman of the outlawed African National
Congress, jailed nearly a quarter century ago for attempting to
overthrow minority white rule here, could determine the fate of
Nelson Mandela and other imprisoned black leaders.
Kobie Coetsee, the justice minister who authorized Mbeki's
release, and Stoffel van der Merwe, the deputy minister for in
formation and constitutional development, said President Pieter
Botha and his Cabinet would watch closely to see the results of
the move. "The future of Mandela and the others is, to some ex
tent, in Mr. Mbeki's hands," Van der Merwe said in an inter
view with the Johannesburg Star.
Were Mbeki, 77, to "become involved in political unrest,
trouble or incitement or break any laws," Van der Merwe
added, the government's hopes of releasing Mandela and other
leaders of the African National Congress and the smaller Pan
Africanist Congress of Azania would be "damaged."
Coetsee, who has sought for several years to find the right
time and way to free the black nationalists, said in a separate in
terview that, "if the issue of Mr. Mbeki and his release results in
an increase in unrest and a rise in the (political) temperature in
the country, it will naturally have an influence" on future pris
oner releases.
But Coetsee, speaking to the influential Afrikaans-language
newspaper Rapport, said he expected Mbeki, who may speak
and travel freely although he may not be quoted inside South
Africa, to become fully involved in "normal politics" — and he
implied that this was the government's hope.
Coetsee also expressed confidence that the veteran African
National Congress and South African Communist Party leader,
who has already emphasized his desire to see reconciliation and
a peaceful resolution of the country's problems, would not allow
himself to be manipulated by "radicals."
Welcome grows thin for Afghans
SADDA, Pakistan — Eight years after millions of Afghans
fled a Soviet invasion of their country, those refugees face the
prospect of another upheaval not of their own making and out of
their control.
An estimated 3 million Afghans — the largest refugee popula
tion in the world — have been settled in more than 350 barren,
mud-colored and sun-baked refugee camps such as the Tindo
camp here in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province, a few
miles from the border with their homeland.
Another estimated half a million "unregistered" refugees,
who live outside the camps, jam the streets, bazaars and out
skirts of Peshawar, the provincial capital, and a handful of other
towns.
Aid officials from western and Islamic countries praise Pakis
tan's role in absorbing such a huge influx of people over the
years and add that the assistance programs being run here —
with the help of more than 50 relief agencies from a score of
countries and the United Nations — also are probably the best,
aside from being the biggest, in the world.
Yet there are signs that the welcome mat is wearing thin.
"The people are getting fed up now with looking after the
refugees," said Ghulam Jatoi, the head of the National Peoples'
Party, a Pakistani opposition group. The traditional welcome
and giving of shelter to Islamic brothers from across the border
is disappearing. "Remember," he said, "the Prophet
Mohammed also said to make sure that you were not a guest for
more than three days. So we have given them eight years."
This view, which seems to be shared by a growing number of
Pakistanis, is explained in part by several factors: the size of the
refugee population, the duration of their stay, the strain on
scarce local resources and the entrepreneurial instincts of many
Afghans who cut in on Pakistani businesses and land, especially
here in the Northwest.
Democrats agree on environment
DES MOINES, lowa— Five Democratic presidential candi
dates gathered here to debate the environment yesterday. All
were in favor of it.
It was the fifth such session featuring Democratic hopefuls in
the last eight days and the second where the focus was supposed
to be on the environment, though the participants could find
little to disagree about on that topic.
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who complained after a debate
Thursday that he was seeing more of his competitors than his
wife, skipped the latest debate to campaign elsewhere.
The proliferation of Democratic debates — more like joint
press conferences than classical debates — has produced grum
bling from candidates who feel pressured to accept at least some
of the dozens of requests lest they offend key liberal special in
terest groups that sponsor them.
But some party leaders in recent days have suggested the situ
ation has become more wearisome than enlightening. Bonnie
Campbell, the lowa Democratic Party chairwoman, said that
she intended to ask national party leaders to consider imposing
limits on such events.
