Efforts by the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees Union to gain publicity and pressure
members of the controversial Bohemian Club to
create a grass-roots movement in the union's favor
are backfiring, Jim Carter, labor attorney for the
club, said yesterday.
"More and more, members are becoming upset
and saying, 'Do not give an inch,' " Carter said.
The union's policy and tactics are the result of
the union's belief that a strike is too risky, Carter
said.
Local 2 of the union is deadlocked in labor nego
tiations with the Bohemian Club, a highly exclu
sive, all-male social club in San Francisco. The un
ion claims the club is threatening to reduce worker
benefits and to subcontract non-union labor at the
club.
Because of the deadlock, the union decided to
publicize the dispute by raising the issue of a possi
ble official link between Stanford and the club, ac
cording to Tim Reagan, press secretary for Local 2.
"fit is] a negotiating ploy. . . . We felt that we
could get help from Stanford and University of Cal
ifornia professors and students," Reagan said yes
terday.
At a press conference last Wednesday, union
Vice President Rafael Espinoza said there "appears
to be an official tie between the club and Stan
ford." Espinoza said several Stanford faculty
belonged to the club and cited a clause in the club's
bylaws that sets aside special memberships specifi
cally for Stanford faculty members.
Biology Prof. Dow Woodward supported the un
ion at the press conference, as did ASSU Senator
Stacey Leyton, who said Stanford was secretly
subsidizing the dues of some of its faculty mem
bers. Leyton, a senior, also called on the Univer
sity to disassociate itself from the club.
"Since membership is expensive, we should ex
plore whether the Hoover Institution or Stanford is
in any way subsidizing these memberships,"
Woodward said.
Leyton is sponsoring a bill tonight in the ASSU
Senate that condemns the club and calls for an end
to any Stanford-Bohemian Club ties. She said she
heard about the club on the Monday before the
press conference.
When asked if she had researched the topic,
Leyton said, "No, beyond the information from
the union, 1 have not." She added that the burden
of proof lies with the University. Leyton's bill was
approved by an ASSU committee the day after her
