# Bohemian Club resists labor union pressure

### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Efforts by the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees Union to gain publicity and pressure
members of the controversial Bohemian Club to
create a grass-roots movement in the union's favor
are backfiring, Jim Carter, labor attorney for the
club, said yesterday.
"More and more, members are becoming upset
and saying, 'Do not give an inch,' " Carter said.
The union's policy and tactics are the result of
the union's belief that a strike is too risky, Carter
said.
Local 2 of the union is deadlocked in labor nego
tiations with the Bohemian Club, a highly exclu
sive, all-male social club in San Francisco. The un
ion claims the club is threatening to reduce worker
benefits and to subcontract non-union labor at the
club.
Because of the deadlock, the union decided to
publicize the dispute by raising the issue of a possi
ble official link between Stanford and the club, ac
cording to Tim Reagan, press secretary for Local 2.
"fit is] a negotiating ploy. . . . We felt that we
could get help from Stanford and University of Cal
ifornia professors and students," Reagan said yes
terday.
At a press conference last Wednesday, union
Vice President Rafael Espinoza said there "appears
to be an official tie between the club and Stan
ford." Espinoza said several Stanford faculty
belonged to the club and cited a clause in the club's
bylaws that sets aside special memberships specifi
cally for Stanford faculty members.
Biology Prof. Dow Woodward supported the un
ion at the press conference, as did ASSU Senator
Stacey Leyton, who said Stanford was secretly
subsidizing the dues of some of its faculty mem
bers. Leyton, a senior, also called on the Univer
sity to disassociate itself from the club.
"Since membership is expensive, we should ex
plore whether the Hoover Institution or Stanford is
in any way subsidizing these memberships,"
Woodward said.
Leyton is sponsoring a bill tonight in the ASSU
Senate that condemns the club and calls for an end
to any Stanford-Bohemian Club ties. She said she
heard about the club on the Monday before the
press conference.
When asked if she had researched the topic,
Leyton said, "No, beyond the information from
the union, 1 have not." She added that the burden
of proof lies with the University. Leyton's bill was
approved by an ASSU committee the day after her
meeting with the union.
Bohemian Club President
George Elliot said yesterday that
"any relationship between the
club and Stanford or Cal is faded
to non-existent. There used to be
a relationship of a sort, but that is
musty history from the past."
Elliot said the link ended when
the club began admitting people
from around the world, ending a
policy that permitted only resi
dents of the Bay Area to be mem

bers.
According to Elliot, special
consideration is given by the club
to people who "can make a sig
nificant contribution to the club's
artistic pursuits."
He described the club as
confined to the "celebration of
the arts in a strictly social, avoca
tional environment." The admis
sion of faculty to the club en
hances its general academic na
ture, Elliot said.
Club members pay an $8500 in
itiation fee and a $110 monthly
fee, Elliot said. The costs to fac
ulty members from any institu

tion, however, are reduced ac
cording to their ability to pay, El
liot said. He emphasized that the
sole reason for these allowances
is the contribution faculty mem
bers make to the club environ
ment.
When asked yesterday about
any potential restrictions put on
club membership by Stanford,
James Rosse, vice president and
provost, said, "1 do no think the
University has the right to tell me
what organization 1 can or can
not belong to."
The club now has members
who are on the faculties of Har

vard, Yale, the University of
Michigan and other universities,
Elliot said.
Critics of the club last week
also suggested that Stanford fac
ulty members were being
nominated for membership by
the University. According to El
liot, the membership process in
volves the nomination of pro
spective candidates by two mem
bers. A membership committee
then considers the applications in
chronological order, again giving
special consideration to people
who might make a significant
contribution.

The union attributed its recent
release of information about the
club to the unique nature of the
negotiations. "Before, the clubs
all bargained together as part of
the San Francisco Club Insti
tute," Reagan said. "We've
never really gone head-to-head
with the Bohemian Club."
The union has adopted a policy
of researching groups with which
it must negotiate, because it feel
there are "invisible groups" that
should be included in the proc
ess, Reagan said. He said that
Stanford faculty members, who
belong to the club as a group,

should become involved in nego
tiations between the club and the
union.
The union maintains that the
club's workers should stay in the
union-administered insurance
plan. The club believes that an al
ternative plan might provide
"equal or better coverage at a
significant savings to us," Carter
said.
Another issue currently being
negotiated between the union
and the club is sub-contracting.
The club argues that members
have expressed a desire to bring
in non-union workers.
