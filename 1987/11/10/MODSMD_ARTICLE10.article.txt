# Reagan, senators discuss Kennedy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” President Reagan and
Attorney General Edwin Meese 111 met with
key Republican senators yesterday to try to
gauge the depth of hard-line conservatives'
reservations about Anthony Kennedy, the
California federal judge who appears to be
the leading candidate for the vacant seat on
the Supreme Court.
Two days after nominee Douglas
Ginsburg's withdrawal from consideration
for the post, conservatives expressed con
cerns about Kennedy's more moderate views
and a background that includes more than 10
years as a California lobbyist.
But White House and Senate sources said
that no other top prospects for the post have
emerged, and that the White House, still
favoring Kennedy, hoped to announce a
nominee this week.
"Everybody's still doing their checks and
reviews," said one senior White House offi
cial. "My sense is it won't happen before
Wednesday." Of Kennedy, the official said.

"It's not a sure deal. He's the leading candi
date, he's the most probable."
Meese met first with Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-
Utah), who had publicly expressed reserva
tions about Kennedy earlier in the day. Late
in the afternoon, Meese joined Reagan at a
White House meeting with Sen. Strom Thur
mond (R-S.C.), the senior Republican on the
Senate Judiciary Committee, sources said.
Kennedy, 51, a federal appeals court judge
in Sacramento, Calif., was the favorite for the
nomination two weeks ago, but lost out to
Ginsburg at the last minute when conserva
tives led by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)
threatened to oppose the nomination. At the
time, Democratic leaders indicated that a pre
liminary look at Kennedy's record had shown
nothing that would be likely to spark major
controversy.
Among the conservatives, Hatch was out
spoken yesterday in suggesting that Kennedy
could face confirmation problems because he
worked as a lobbyist for clients including a

liquor distilling company. But administration
officials believe that reservations about Ken
nedy, who has strong support from many
conservative activists, can be overcome.
Administration officials wish to act quickly
on the nomination both to end the embarrass
ment caused by the collapse of the Ginsburg
nomination, which was withdrawn after the
disclosure that Ginsburg had smoked mari
juana while a Harvard law professor, and to
preserve the slim chance that the Senate
could at least begin action on a new nomina
tion this year. The court seat has been vacant
since June 26, when Justice Lewis Powell Jr.
retired, with months consumed by the Senate
consideration and eventual rejection of
Reagan's original nominee, Robert Bork.
While several senators have suggested
other names to White House officials, none
have shifted the White House inclination
away from Kennedy, White House sources
said.
