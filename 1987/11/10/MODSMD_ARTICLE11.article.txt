# Horses get new home
## Facilities being built for equestrian program 
### Evelyn Bunn 
Stanford yesterday began construc
tion of a new residence hall. The entire
structure, covering 10,(KK) square feet
of land, will cost $380,000. It will be
painted bright red with white trim, and
will house 37 special residents. Best of
all, residents can move into their rooms
in 30 working days.
Now hold your horses. If you move
in, your hallmate will be a horse. In
tact, all your neighbors will be horses.
Stanford is building a barn â€” next to
the historic Red Barn off Campus
Drive. I he new barn is being funded by
a gift from Michael and Gail Yanney of
Omaha, Neb., who are the parents of
Lisa Yanney, a member of the
equestrian club. In addition to the barn,
the Yanneys' gift will help build a new
competition ring, which is to be built
next year.
I he new addition, set to open in mid-
December, will help accomodate the
fast-growing equestrian program,
managed by local stockbroker Sara
Saxe. I he program shut down in 1982
for renovation of the Red Barn, and was
restarted in 1984 with nine horses.
Since then, the count has doubled.
I he equestrian team plans to acquire
five more team horses in the near fu
ture, according to Saxe.
The equestrian program is run by

Equestrian Associates, a limited part
nership headed by Saxe. The associates
lease 13 acres from the University for
equestrian use. The program in turn
hoards private horses and teaches
riding lessons.
Saxe said that interest in the
equestrian program is surprisingly high,
even among prospective freshmen. She
cited a magazine article in which a top
teenage equestrian competitor is quoted
as saying she hoped to attend Stanford.
"There's a lot more interest out there
than people realize," Saxe said.
There is a one- to two-year waiting
list for hoarding space in the Red Barn s
27 stalls. The new barn is reserved for
school and team horses, but it will open
an additional 12 to 15 stalls, especially
for students who wish to board horses
on campus.
The Red Barn, built between 1878
and 1880, is the last remaining building
from the original Stanford Ranch. First
used as a training ground. Sen. Leland
Stanford conducted widely known ex
periments in horse breeding and train
ing there.
The new barn will resemble the old
Red Barn in its design and color, but it
will be one story instead of two and will
not include any of the Victorian ele
ments found in the design of the former
training stable. The new facility will
consist of 37 stalls.
