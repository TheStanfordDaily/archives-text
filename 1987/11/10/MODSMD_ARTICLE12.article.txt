# Orchestra tour gets go-ahead
## 
### Jay Bhattacharya Staff writer 
The University has approved the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra's plan
to tour Japan, Taiwan and Korea next
summer.
Michael Ramsey-Perez, director of
Student Organization Services, said
the symphony trip "has the support of
the administration and the Centennial
Committee." He said approval was
"not given lightly . . . and means a
great deal (to the success of the proj
ect)."
The Centennial Committee su
pervises the University's Centennial
fund-raising campaign. Committee
Chair Gerald Lieberman, professor of
statistics, said that although the com
mittee has approved financial support
for the trip, he wasn't sure of the exact
amount. He said the total would be
over $10,000 and would be "a function
of how much the orchestra can raise by
itself."
Peter Stansky, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said, "The
Dean's office supports the trip whole
heartedly." He added that the School
of Humanities and Sciences would
make a "small contribution" to the
symphony's fund-raising effort.
The trip no longer requires official
approval of the provost's office,
Stansky said, because the total amount
to be raised is under $ I()(),()()(). He
noted, however, that the provost sup
ports the program.

According to Music Prof. Andor
loth, the symphony's conductor, other
sources of income include $50,(KK) from
orchestra members and over $20,(KM)
from performances. In addition, he
said, the symphony was working with
the host countries to find ways of
cheaply housing band members during
the tour.
The total cost of the trip has been es

timated at not more than $ 160,000.
Both Stansky and Perez said they were
optimistic that the money would even
tually be raised.
Sophomore Clara Hsu, a member of
the orchestra, said symphony members
were helping in the fund-raising effort.
She said University residences were
being asked to help support the trip.
