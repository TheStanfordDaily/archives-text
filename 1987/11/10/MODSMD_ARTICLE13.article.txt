It's tempting to be mirthful about the incon
gruity of the Reagan administration s anti-drug
campaign finally devouring one of its own.
Douglas Ginsburg, Reagan's latest nominee to
the Supreme Court, withdrew from the running
Saturday after it was revealed he had smoked
marijuana several times as a college student and
law professor.
The flap over Ginsburg's pot use is, however,
symptomatic of what has become an unsettling
phenomenon. The tabloid mentality of the na
tion's media in probing into the private matters
of public officials is increasingly shifting the
focus of political debate from substantive issues
to soap-operatic scandals.
Although it would be incorrect to say
Ginsburg's pot use was irrelevant to his can
didacy for the high court, the hysteria surround
ing the story was entirely disproportionate to its
significance. The media's moralistic intonations

about the evils of drugs over the last several
months, fueled in part by Nancy Reagan's "Just
Say No" campaign, has now succeeded in
making drug use an ethical litmus test for public
office.
Obscured by the smoke were more legitimate
concerns about Ginsburg. Nor did it seem to
matter that Ginsburg apparently used only mari
juana, did so infrequently and stopped eight
years ago. The outcry, engendered in part by
sensationalistic reporting, was such that one
might have thought Ginsburg was a heroin addict
who supported his habit by dealing to school
children in West Oakland.
This sort of hysteria will undoubtedly have a
chilling effect on persons inclined toward public
office. Many otherwise qualified persons are
likely to "just say no" to public service because
they do not want their personal lives converted
into the media's latest simplistic morality play.
