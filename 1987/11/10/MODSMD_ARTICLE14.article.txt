Falling off the
lunatic fringe
Well, Profs. Manley and Reb
holz have once again fallen off
the lunatic fringe of left-leaning
thought in their mission to con
vince us that the Hoover Institu
tion must be dismantled to
restore objectivity to the Stan
ford community.
Let's digress and look at a few
facts (a practice Manley and Reb
holz would never turn to because
facts are inherently biased). As
George Marotta, a research fel
low at Hoover pointed out in the
July 17 "Wall Street Journal,"
professors in the Political Sci
ence Department are 92 percent
registered Democrat, and 96 per
cent are registered Democrats in
the English Department. It is a
strange thing, indeed, how Man
ley and Rebholz could allow this
gross incongruence to occur
within their own departments.
Perhaps this is the type of
"balance" that they feel en
hances "our reputation for objec
tivity and independence."
I commend President Kennedy
and Director Campbell for
defending Hoover in light of the
never-ending whining provided
by Manley and Rebholz. 1 mean,
if the thoughts coming out of
Hoover are so "right-wing,"
surely Manley and Rebholz can
conjure up some simple refuta
tions to expose these conserva
tive illusions. But I'll tell you
why this won't happen; Manley
ana Rebholz fear competition
(It's inherent in leftist politics).
The only forum in which they
know how to operate is one that
is unopposed (you know, one
party systems and the like). This
is their definition of academic
freedom: the freedom to espouse
their views in an unopposed, uni
form dialogue. The Reagan Li
brary instilled this very same
fear; how could they ever handle

two bastions of common sense in
one location?
As Manley and Rebholz stated
in their viewpoint, "No univer
sity can tolerate within its midst a
highly autonomous, politically
active think tank, whether that
think tank espouses the values of
Adam Smith or Karl Marx."' One
solution to remedy this injustice
would be for Manley and Reb
holz to resign their positions.
This could only move the present
debate to a higher echelon and
help to correct the liberal im
balance within the Stanford fac
ulty.

Deserve equal
rights only
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance
(GLAS) receives funding from
both the ASSU and the Student
Organization Services Depart
ment.. Although GLAS does
sponsor some educational pro
grams, GLAS, like a fraternity, is
primarily a social organization.
Fraternities have faculty nights,
speakers and community service
activities. One might argue that
homosexuals are a minority and
deserve funding because of their
minority status; but, like frater
nity members, GLAS members
choose to become part of their
respective group. It is unfair to
the real minorities on campus
that funds must go to a social or
ganization when the funds could
be better spent.
Fraternities provide social
events for a much larger
percentage of the campus. If
GLAS gets funding for
homosexual activities then why
don't fraternities correspond
ingly receive funds for providing
the heterosexual community the
same social opportunities? The
University doesn't even pay for
dorm parties, but it does help out

GLAS financially. Fraternities
don't deserve any University
funds for their parties and neither
does GLAS.
Heterosexuals are people, too.

Don't search for
hidden racism
We are responding to the
claims made in a letter (Daily,
Nov. 6) about the name of the
Big Game party, "Cardinal and
White Night," as a "blatant dis
play of racism." Frankly, we
round the letter ridiculous and of
fensive.
Certainly it is important for
people to be aware of racism in
order to avoid it, but one cannot
search for underlying racism in
every word or phrase. Party
planners named the party
"Cardinal and White Night" so
that students would wear Stan
ford's colors to this nighttime ac
tivity.
Stanford's colors are cardinal
and white, and the party is taking
place at night; should they have
named the party "Green and Yel
low Afternoon?"
This letter does more harm
than good to the struggle against
racism. We must be able to ac
curately identify racism before
we can hope to eliminate it.
