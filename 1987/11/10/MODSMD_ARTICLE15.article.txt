## Enemy-making self-destructive 
### 
This past summer I had the pleasure of
reading an insightful book by Sam Keen titled
"Faces of the Enemy." It is interesting to
note that Keen's ideology of enemy-making
is shared by the writers of at least two recent
Daily viewpoints.

Ugo Colella

My primary concern lies in the rhetoric be
hind a viewpoint's impressive title, "Secular
humanism's war on God" (Daily, Oct. 30),
and a concluding remark in another view
point (Daily, Nov. 3), "Let us hope that
America recognizes the true enemy.' In my
view, these two statements are disturbing.
Why do the authors (one claiming to be a
humanist) make a distinction between "us"
and "them?"
At present, it seems that the "realistic"
ways in which we think about war and
enemies are morally and intellectually bank
rupt, delusional and self-destructive.
Enemy-making and warfare are social crea
tions, not biological imperatives. The habit of
directing our hostility outward toward those
who are unknown to us is as characteristic of
human beings as our capacity for reason,
wonder or tool-making.
The "enemy" is always singular — a cate
gory to which we assign any threat about
which we do not wish to think clearly. The
paranoid mind makes the enemy an abstrac

tion. When we think of war, it is not a person
we intend to attack, but an idea. Accordingly,
the art of propaganda is to create a portrait
that incarnates the idea of what we wish to
destroy so we will react, rather than think,
and automatically focus our hostility.
We scapegoat and create enemies not be
cause we follow a logic of homo hostilis, but
because focusing our anger on an outside tar
get brings our nation (or group) together. The
creation of an enemy — paradoxically — al
lows us to be part of a close and loving in
group. We excel only by reducing others to
the status of inferiors; win only by creating a
majority of losers.
Such degraded images of the enemy lead us
to underestimate their humanity. As a result,
the degradation gives us sanction to use bru
tal tactics that often reduce us to the level of
barbarism. We must remember there will be
no fire during the long nuclear winter, and no
storyteller left to remember that our generals
and statesmen were leaders of a race
endowed with a promise of reason and a po
tential for compassion that might have made
us human beings.
The proper stance for us is commitment to
the discipline of questioning. If we do not yet
know new answers, we can at least refuse to
be hypnotized by old questions. Our infatua
tion with the old question, "How can we
defeat the enemy and be secure?," is dead.
The question that must become an ultimate
concern in our time is, "How can we reduce
our enmity?"

We must not use words like "war" and
"enemy" to describe our feelings toward
socialists, secular humanists, Iranians, God
or whomever. Instead, a humanist ideology
requires us to convert our disposition toward
hostility into a disposition toward kindness.
We must devote the full energy of our im
agination and will to finding a way to live in
harmony with our neighbors.
The only way out is to stop the game. Be
neither one up nor one down. Liberty,
equality, fraternity, sorority. Only conflicts
between people of the same size, or nations
of the same dignity, can be solved in a
reasonable way. The rule of law is estab
lished by mutually honoring the fundamental
assumption that all men, women and children
are equal.
I want to close with some thoughtful words
from Nietzsche: "Rendering oneself
unarmed when one has been the best armed,
out of a height of feeling — that is the means
to real peace, which must always rest upon a
peace of mind; whereas the so-called armed
peace, as it now exists in all countries, is the
absence of peace of mind. One trusts neither
oneself nor one's neighbors, and half from
hatred, half from fear, does not lay down
arms. Rather perish than hate and fear, and
twice rather perish than make oneself hated
and feared — this must someday become the
highest maxim for every single common
wealth, too."
