# Through the children's eyes
## 
### 
Two Saturdays ago at 7 p.m. about 50 little kids
from East Palo Alto came charging through the
halls of Lagunita, terrifying local residents into
giving away exquisitely concocted goodies as
peace offerings.

Halloween. The only night of the year where you
get to dress up in things you wouldn't be caught
dead in during the day. One of the few times you
can consume twice your normal daily caloric intake
and feel justified. It's a night to let yourself loose
and act like a little kid again. What would we do
without Halloween to let out all that problem
set/term paper/art project/midterm stress? When
else are there so many parties on campus that you
can run from one to the next and still not hit all of
them? Maybe they should turn Halloween into a
national holiday (No classes! 1 could handle that).
Halloween brings back great memories. Think
about all the ways you've ever dressed up. Remem
ber when you were little; all you had to do was go
to the store and pick out one of those prepackaged
things? The ones with just a T-shirt, a cape and a
mask? Now that >ye're older we look ror more
original ways of dressing*up.
Access to heavy-duty costume materials is some
what harder to come by when you're away from
home, but it's still amazing what you can put to
gether with some careful searching and a little
creativity. My older brother used a flashlight, some
vacuum cleaner parts, army fatigues and a red ban
dana to become Vasquez from "Aliens." One guy
in my dorm last year pinned socks all over his
clothes and went as "static cling." Or how about
the Exotic Erotic Ball in San Francisco? I've never
gone, but from what I've heard, it's pretty wild
(Remember, it's not just what you wear, it's what
you don't wear that makes a costume, er, unusual.
Yeah, that's it).
I got to be a trick-or-treat giver instead of a taker
this year. Handing out candy to all those little kids
made me remember things that I'd completely for
gotten, such as "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie
Brown." We used to watch that all the time. Re
member how he tried to make a "ghost" costume
but always ended up with a sheet full of holes? Or:
"1 got a lollipop!" "1 got some bubble gum!" "I
got a candy bar!" And then Charlie Brown: "1 got a
rock." I laugh at it, but at the same time it's so sad.
Chocolate Faster bunnies with cracks in them
make me feel that way too. Oh, wait — wrong

holiday.
Halloween candy reminds me of the things we
used to get when we were little, too, like Pixie Stix.
Or Smartees, those little pastel candies rolled in a
red plastic wrapper (I couldn't remember what they
were called either). I always got too many Bit O
Honeys, Sugar Daddies and Fruit Jujubes — I
hated Fruit Jujubes — and not enough of the good
stuff like mini Hershey bars and M & Ms. My
brother and sister and 1 used to pour all our candy
onto the kitchen table, count every single piece,
separate it into "good" and "bad" candy, and
swap things. My parents would hover in the back
ground, admiring our treasures and, 1 bet, secretly
hoping we would give them something. Good thing
for me that Mom liked Fruit Jujubes.
Isn't it ironic that we live in such a health
conscious society, and yet on Halloween we go out
of our way to give children the worst junk food we
can find? 1 mean, 1 finally understand why some
people give out apples. When I was little 1 hadn't
the foggiest idea why anyone would be so clueless
as to give out something that was supposed to be
good for you. It didn't matter when we got fruit,
though, because Mom usually made us throw it out
anyway ("What if there's a pin in there??").
I think the things 1 like best about Halloween,
though, are pumpkins. Not the smashed kind you
find all over the place the next morning, but the
healthy, living ones. There's something about a
carved pumpkin with a candle in it that I find
strangely compelling. Maybe it's that "baking
pumpkin" smell, maybe it's the way their features
start to sag softly around the edges. 1 don't know. I
just like the way they sit there and smile at you with
that silent, all-knowing look, as if they know some
secret. Note that 1 decline to talk about what has to
happen to a pumpkin for it to look "strangely com
pelling" in the first place. Those of you who have
seen Saturday Night Five's famous pumpkin
carving sketch know what I'm talking about.
I had a great Halloween this year. Anyone with
the capacity to act a little silly and feel perfectly all
right doing so can have a great time on Halloween.
It's a special day for both grown-ups and little kids
because it draws them together. Whether we cavort
through neighborhoods as children or through
campus parties as adults, we're all the same age, in
a way. I may be too old for trick-or-treating now,
but I will always have fond memories. This year I'll
remember Halloween as the night the kids from
East Palo Alto trick-or-treated through the dorms.
Seeing their excited faces, watching as they picked
out the candy they wanted, hearing their "thank
yoif's — somehow, it touched my heart.
Sometimes all you need to get things back in per
spective is to forget about everything that causes
you stress and see your world through children's
eyes.

Isn't it ironic that we live in such a health
conscious society, and yet on Halloween we go out
of our way to give children the worst junk food we
can find? 1 mean, 1 finally understand why some
people give out apples. When I was little 1 hadn't
the foggiest idea why anyone would be so clueless
as to give out something that was supposed to be
good for you. It didn't matter when we got fruit,
though, because Mom usually made us throw it out
anyway ("What if there's a pin in there??").
I think the things 1 like best about Halloween,
though, are pumpkins. Not the smashed kind you
find all over the place the next morning, but the
healthy, living ones. There's something about a
carved pumpkin with a candle in it that I find
strangely compelling. Maybe it's that "baking
pumpkin" smell, maybe it's the way their features
start to sag softly around the edges. 1 don't know. I
just like the way they sit there and smile at you with
that silent, all-knowing look, as if they know some
secret. Note that 1 decline to talk about what has to
happen to a pumpkin for it to look "strangely com
pelling" in the first place. Those of you who have
seen Saturday Night Five's famous pumpkin
carving sketch know what I'm talking about.
I had a great Halloween this year. Anyone with
the capacity to act a little silly and feel perfectly all
right doing so can have a great time on Halloween.
It's a special day for both grown-ups and little kids
because it draws them together. Whether we cavort
through neighborhoods as children or through
campus parties as adults, we're all the same age, in
a way. I may be too old for trick-or-treating now,
but I will always have fond memories. This year I'll
remember Halloween as the night the kids from
East Palo Alto trick-or-treated through the dorms.
Seeing their excited faces, watching as they picked
out the candy they wanted, hearing their "thank
yoif's — somehow, it touched my heart.
Sometimes all you need to get things back in per
spective is to forget about everything that causes
you stress and see your world through children's
eyes.

Two Saturdays ago at 7 p.m. about 50 little kids
from East Palo Alto came charging through the
halls of Lagunita, terrifying local residents into
giving away exquisitely concocted goodies as
peace offerings.

Halloween. The only night of the year where you
get to dress up in things you wouldn't be caught
dead in during the day. One of the few times you
can consume twice your normal daily caloric intake
and feel justified. It's a night to let yourself loose
and act like a little kid again. What would we do
without Halloween to let out all that problem
set/term paper/art project/midterm stress? When
else are there so many parties on campus that you
can run from one to the next and still not hit all of
them? Maybe they should turn Halloween into a
national holiday (No classes! 1 could handle that).
Halloween brings back great memories. Think
about all the ways you've ever dressed up. Remem
ber when you were little; all you had to do was go
to the store and pick out one of those prepackaged
things? The ones with just a T-shirt, a cape and a
mask? Now that >ye're older we look ror more
original ways of dressing*up.
Access to heavy-duty costume materials is some
what harder to come by when you're away from
home, but it's still amazing what you can put to
gether with some careful searching and a little
creativity. My older brother used a flashlight, some
vacuum cleaner parts, army fatigues and a red ban
dana to become Vasquez from "Aliens." One guy
in my dorm last year pinned socks all over his
clothes and went as "static cling." Or how about
the Exotic Erotic Ball in San Francisco? I've never
gone, but from what I've heard, it's pretty wild
(Remember, it's not just what you wear, it's what
you don't wear that makes a costume, er, unusual.
Yeah, that's it).
I got to be a trick-or-treat giver instead of a taker
this year. Handing out candy to all those little kids
made me remember things that I'd completely for
gotten, such as "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie
Brown." We used to watch that all the time. Re
member how he tried to make a "ghost" costume
but always ended up with a sheet full of holes? Or:
"1 got a lollipop!" "1 got some bubble gum!" "I
got a candy bar!" And then Charlie Brown: "1 got a
rock." I laugh at it, but at the same time it's so sad.
Chocolate Faster bunnies with cracks in them
make me feel that way too. Oh, wait — wrong

holiday.
Halloween candy reminds me of the things we
used to get when we were little, too, like Pixie Stix.
Or Smartees, those little pastel candies rolled in a
red plastic wrapper (I couldn't remember what they
were called either). I always got too many Bit O
Honeys, Sugar Daddies and Fruit Jujubes — I
hated Fruit Jujubes — and not enough of the good
stuff like mini Hershey bars and M & Ms. My
brother and sister and 1 used to pour all our candy
onto the kitchen table, count every single piece,
separate it into "good" and "bad" candy, and
swap things. My parents would hover in the back
ground, admiring our treasures and, 1 bet, secretly
hoping we would give them something. Good thing
for me that Mom liked Fruit Jujubes.
