# Humane Society raises objections
## Kennedy proposal draws criticism 
### Brian Rhoads Staff writer 
Palo Alto Humane Society officials
yesterday sharply criticized University
President Donald Kennedy for his sug
gestion that prominent research univer
sities such as Stanford, UC-Berkeley and
San Francisco State University work to
gether to avoid becoming what Kennedy
called "victims of not in my backyard'
local politics."
In a press conference held at the Palo
Alto Humane Society, Helen McClos
key, the organization's president, called
the idea an attempt by Kennedy to help
Stanford "avoid regulation" by local
governments.
Stanford Librarian Lise Giraud, a
member of the Humane Society's board
of directors, called the idea "an alliance
of prestigious institutions to bypass local
elected officials representing the public."
In a later interview, University Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Freelen said Kennedy's suggestion was
meant as something "to think about" and
that there was no specific proposal.
Larry Horton, associate vice president
for Public Affairs, said last night that

Kennedy's idea is a possible solution to
"a much larger issue," namely a general
public that has developed a growing fear
of science.
"[Kennedy] has analyzed the problems
involving [a proposed animal research fa
cility here) and the new bio building,
along with similar problems at Berkeley
and [ San Francisco State J/* Horton
said. "It was an analysis of the problem,
and he simply offered several solutions."
Protests by animal rights activists have
recently led to delays in construction of a
research animal facility, better known as
RAF 11, and a biosciences expansion.
Both projects are being assessed by envi
ronmental impact reports.
Freelen said representatives from local
governments would be involved in a
regional group of research universities,
should such a group ever come into exis
tence.
Humane Society officials said at the
press conference that because Stanford
has a large amount of public funds, the
University must be held accountable to
the public for considering building
facilities that mav house research materi-

als that are "potentially hazar
dous."
The Humane Society officials
also attempted to clarify their
reasons for opposition to the
RAF 11.
Freelen said all previous ap
peals made no issue of public
safety, and that opposition to the
facility arose at the very end of
the county construction proposal
process.
Stanford is required to provide
an environmental impact report
(EIR) on the proposed RAF II for

the county Board of Supervisors
before construction can begin.
According to Giraud, "The EIR
will have to deal with the hand
ling and the effects of potentially
hazardous organisms and materi
als which will be reproduced by
DNA research."
However, Horton said,
"There is no biohazardous re
search to be done in the build
ing. . . . Stanford has felt the full
facts about the animal research
facility should be known from the
start."
Giraud charged at the press
conference that it is Stanford's
fault that it has to conduct an
EIR because the University
plans to do DNA research in the

new facility.
Giraud said the Palo Alto
Humane Society discovered
Stanford's intention to do genetic
research in the facility while in
vestigating "Stanford's obvious
intent to undermine the Animal
Welfare Act already passed into
law."
The Animal Welfare Act,
passed in 1985, sets minimum
standards for animal research
procedures.
The process of drawing up an
EIR calls for the University to
hire a county-approved firm to
gather complaints from oppo
nents and then to investigate
each issue raised. The process
can involve several rounds of

hearings.
Horton estimates the delay of
construction of the RAF II could
cost up to $2 million, including
the cost of the EIR itself, as well
as indirect costs caused by the
breaking of construction con
tracts and by inflationary expen
ditures due to the delay.
Humane Society officials said
they expect the EIR will eventu
ally meet with the county's ap
proval.
Horton said he is certain it
will. "You might as well take all
the money that the EIR will cost,
put it in White Plaza and blow
torch it for all the good it will
do," he said.

als that are "potentially hazar
dous."
The Humane Society officials
also attempted to clarify their
reasons for opposition to the
RAF 11.
Freelen said all previous ap
peals made no issue of public
safety, and that opposition to the
facility arose at the very end of
the county construction proposal
process.
Stanford is required to provide
an environmental impact report
(EIR) on the proposed RAF II for

the county Board of Supervisors
before construction can begin.
According to Giraud, "The EIR
will have to deal with the hand
ling and the effects of potentially
hazardous organisms and materi
als which will be reproduced by
DNA research."
However, Horton said,
"There is no biohazardous re
search to be done in the build
ing. . . . Stanford has felt the full
facts about the animal research
facility should be known from the
start."
Giraud charged at the press
conference that it is Stanford's
fault that it has to conduct an
EIR because the University
plans to do DNA research in the

new facility.
Giraud said the Palo Alto
Humane Society discovered
Stanford's intention to do genetic
research in the facility while in
vestigating "Stanford's obvious
intent to undermine the Animal
Welfare Act already passed into
law."
The Animal Welfare Act,
passed in 1985, sets minimum
standards for animal research
procedures.
The process of drawing up an
EIR calls for the University to
hire a county-approved firm to
gather complaints from oppo
nents and then to investigate
each issue raised. The process
can involve several rounds of

hearings.
Horton estimates the delay of
construction of the RAF II could
cost up to $2 million, including
the cost of the EIR itself, as well
as indirect costs caused by the
breaking of construction con
tracts and by inflationary expen
ditures due to the delay.
Humane Society officials said
they expect the EIR will eventu
ally meet with the county's ap
proval.
Horton said he is certain it
will. "You might as well take all
the money that the EIR will cost,
put it in White Plaza and blow
torch it for all the good it will
do," he said.
Palo Alto Humane Society officials
yesterday sharply criticized University
President Donald Kennedy for his sug
gestion that prominent research univer
sities such as Stanford, UC-Berkeley and
San Francisco State University work to
gether to avoid becoming what Kennedy
called "victims of not in my backyard'
local politics."
In a press conference held at the Palo
Alto Humane Society, Helen McClos
key, the organization's president, called
the idea an attempt by Kennedy to help
Stanford "avoid regulation" by local
governments.
Stanford Librarian Lise Giraud, a
member of the Humane Society's board
of directors, called the idea "an alliance
of prestigious institutions to bypass local
elected officials representing the public."
In a later interview, University Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Freelen said Kennedy's suggestion was
meant as something "to think about" and
that there was no specific proposal.
Larry Horton, associate vice president
for Public Affairs, said last night that

Kennedy's idea is a possible solution to
"a much larger issue," namely a general
public that has developed a growing fear
of science.
"[Kennedy] has analyzed the problems
involving [a proposed animal research fa
cility here) and the new bio building,
along with similar problems at Berkeley
and [ San Francisco State J/* Horton
said. "It was an analysis of the problem,
and he simply offered several solutions."
Protests by animal rights activists have
recently led to delays in construction of a
research animal facility, better known as
RAF 11, and a biosciences expansion.
Both projects are being assessed by envi
ronmental impact reports.
