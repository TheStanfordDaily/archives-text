# Humane Society raises objections
## Kennedy proposal draws criticism 
### Brian Rhoads Staff writer 
Palo Alto Humane Society officials
yesterday sharply criticized University
President Donald Kennedy for his sug
gestion that prominent research univer
sities such as Stanford, UC-Berkeley and
San Francisco State University work to
gether to avoid becoming what Kennedy
called "victims of not in my backyard'
local politics."
In a press conference held at the Palo
Alto Humane Society, Helen McClos
key, the organization's president, called
the idea an attempt by Kennedy to help
Stanford "avoid regulation" by local
governments.
Stanford Librarian Lise Giraud, a
member of the Humane Society's board
of directors, called the idea "an alliance
of prestigious institutions to bypass local
elected officials representing the public."
In a later interview, University Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Freelen said Kennedy's suggestion was
meant as something "to think about" and
that there was no specific proposal.
Larry Horton, associate vice president
for Public Affairs, said last night that

Kennedy's idea is a possible solution to
"a much larger issue," namely a general
public that has developed a growing fear
of science.
"[Kennedy] has analyzed the problems
involving [a proposed animal research fa
cility here) and the new bio building,
along with similar problems at Berkeley
and [ San Francisco State J/* Horton
said. "It was an analysis of the problem,
and he simply offered several solutions."
Protests by animal rights activists have
recently led to delays in construction of a
research animal facility, better known as
RAF 11, and a biosciences expansion.
Both projects are being assessed by envi
ronmental impact reports.
Freelen said representatives from local
governments would be involved in a
regional group of research universities,
should such a group ever come into exis
tence.
Humane Society officials said at the
press conference that because Stanford
has a large amount of public funds, the
University must be held accountable to
the public for considering building
facilities that mav house research materi-
