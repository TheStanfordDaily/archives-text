# Inside
## Bug Me comes clean after finding a MAMA 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
In the spirit of Douglas
Ginsburg, 1 thought it would be
best if 1 came forth honestly with
my past activities in order to
avoid a Bug Me scandal in the fu
ture. So here goes: Once, when 1
was in elementary school, and
thew several times in junior high,
1 ate chocolate-chip cookies
before dinner knowing that it
would spoil my appetite. It was a
mistake, 1 have not done this
since, and 1 deeply regret ever
having done so.
There; I feel so much better.
On now to our Bug Me mail
bag. Regarding last week's ques
tion about time zone changes, a
former New York commuter
writes, "Don't call the airlines,
call the train dispatchers. In New
York, when 2 a.m. rolls around
on the last Sunday of October the
trains stop wherever they are.
They just wait for one hour.
Then, when 2 a.m. comes back
again, they proceed." In other
words, they just stop and pretend
the Phantom Hour doesn't exist.
This really doesn't help us with
the airline question, though, be
cause if you just shut off the
engines of a 747 in mid-air you'll
probably have better things to
worry about than what time it is.
Dear Bug,
I eat at the Stanford Elec
tronics Lahs on a regular hasis
because of the great chicken
salad. On m\ wax there, I always

notice an ominous sign on one of
the doors that says "MAMA DE
TECTOR LABS," with various
warning signs. Well, my mother
in-law has threatened to visit,
and I am wondering if it will
detect her, and if so, what else?
- Nate

It took me about a week to find
the Stanford Electronics Labs
(SEL), mostly because it is hid
den directly behind the physics
tank, which is not somewhere 1
generally go.
You weren't kidding about that
chicken salad. In fact, there's
even a little cafeteria so
electronics nerds never have to
leave the building. But even
more exciting is the Electronics
Supply Shop, a nifty little store
that sells wires, diodes, school
supplies and just about anything
else the budding electrical engi
neering major could want. The
prices are teriffic; 1 picked up a
box of Sony Macintosh disks for

$19.74, which is $5 cheaper than
at the Bookstore. Consider that
your consumer tip of the week.
1 did indeed find the door
labeled "MAMA LABS: Center
for Space Science and Astro
physics." There were names of
three people on the door to call
for information. But look! The
door wasn't latched properly,
and I could open it and sneak in if
I wanted to . . . No, that would
be wrong.
I snuck in.
I started to look at the nifty
gadgets on the tables and the
charts and diagrams on the wall,
when suddenly a man appeared
behind me and challenged my
presence. So 1 did what any nor
mal investigative journalist
would do, I told him that I was
the author of KZSU Picks doing
a story on U2, but that I still
hadn't found what I was looking
for.
Actually the man was very
nice. He is one of the scientists
working on the Multi-Anode
MicroChannel Arrays — or
MAMA — which is a light
sensitive device used in building
the famous Hubbell Space Tele
scope. This is the space tele
scope that was supposed to go up
in the space shuttle four years
ago, before NASA ran into those
little troubles.
When installed in space, the
telescope will allow astronomers
to expand the observable uni
verse by more than 10 times. In
other words, an astronaut on the
space shuttle will actually be able

to see that tattoo of Ozzy Os
bourne you have on your butt.
I know the KCJB scours Hug
Me for state secrets, so I can't
reveal the full nature of the
MAMA thingy. Basically, the
way it works is you have a
microchannel plate with millions
of little holes in it. each of which
is 12-and-a-half microns wide. To
put this into perspective, con
sider that a human hair is 100
microns wide.
As an electron (or in this case a
photon — a light particle) enters
one of the holes, it passes down a
little curved hallway, striking the
walls and emitting more electons.
In this way. one electron is multi
plied into a million electrons, and
hence, a little faint light is mag
nified into a big bright light. You
put it all together in a telescope
and BINCIO! Suddenly you can
see where no man has seen
before.
That, in a nutshell, is the
MAMA project. They even gave
me a demonstration, and let me
tell you, it looks like it will be ter
rific when it finally gets into
space.
Dear Bug.
Three summers ago / was a
Jay camp counselor for a group
of 4-ycar-olds. At snack time I
used to as k tliem questions. and
whoever would answer first
would get an extra cookie. One
day I asked. Who's stronger,
He-Man or Superman'.' / was
bombarded with 15 cries of He-
Man!" Of course. / didn't i>ive

anybody a cookie, because from
my childhood days of "Super
friends" I knew that nobody is
stronger than Superman. So tell
me, is He-Man stronger than Su
perman?
- Rick

While Superman is
busy destroying
space criminals, He-
Man is petting his
stupid battle cat.

You see. Kick, this exemplifies
the difference between you and
me. Your biggest concern is
whether He-Man could beat up
Superman. My biggest concern is
that Counterpoint has yet to
come sing "Be My Baby" while
giving me a private Swedish
massage. Oh well.
However, you will be relieved
to hear that all experts in the field
assure me that Superman is much
stronger than He-Man, and if it
came to a tight Superman would
kick He-Man's cartoon butt all
over the universe. In fact, the
guy at Lee's Comics went so far
as to say that He-Man is "a
wimp." notwithstanding the fact
that he (He-Man, not the guy at
Lee s comics) hangs out with the
Masters of the Universe.
Let's look at it another way:

Superman has four movies, He-
Man has only one. While Super
man is busy moving planets and
destroying space criminals, He-
Man is playing with his battle
sword and petting his stupid bat
tle cat.
If they ever got into a real
fight, Superman could simply
stand back about 10 miles and
zap He-Man with his heat vision.
It would really be no contest. He-
Man can't even fly. How about
asking whether He-Man is
stronger than Garfield?
The only prayer He-Man
would have was if he had some
Kryptonite. So, if He-Man were
to steal some Kryptonite from
Food Service and use it against
Superman, he might be able to
vanquish him. But that doesn't
really count.
She-Ra, He-Man's girlfriend,
could probably kick Lois Lane,
however. She-Ra is a pretty im
posing physical figure, and I'm
pretty sure that she would just
stomp on Lois. This, naturally,
brings to mind that popular '60s
song:
He-Man's buck, and yon're
gonna get in trouble,
She-Ra, She-Ra. He-Man's
back.
A much better question would
have been "Is Superman
stronger than Zen Master
Kama?" You remember old Zen
Master, that cheesy-looking guy
with the two-page ads in The
Daily last week? 1 think he is
probably the strongest of all the
fictional characters in the world.

BUG
ME
In the spirit of Douglas
Ginsburg, 1 thought it would be
best if 1 came forth honestly with
my past activities in order to
avoid a Bug Me scandal in the fu
ture. So here goes: Once, when 1
was in elementary school, and
thew several times in junior high,
1 ate chocolate-chip cookies
before dinner knowing that it
would spoil my appetite. It was a
mistake, 1 have not done this
since, and 1 deeply regret ever
having done so.
There; I feel so much better.
On now to our Bug Me mail
bag. Regarding last week's ques
tion about time zone changes, a
former New York commuter
writes, "Don't call the airlines,
call the train dispatchers. In New
York, when 2 a.m. rolls around
on the last Sunday of October the
trains stop wherever they are.
They just wait for one hour.
Then, when 2 a.m. comes back
again, they proceed." In other
words, they just stop and pretend
the Phantom Hour doesn't exist.
This really doesn't help us with
the airline question, though, be
cause if you just shut off the
engines of a 747 in mid-air you'll
probably have better things to
worry about than what time it is.
Dear Bug,
I eat at the Stanford Elec
tronics Lahs on a regular hasis
because of the great chicken
salad. On m\ wax there, I always

notice an ominous sign on one of
the doors that says "MAMA DE
TECTOR LABS," with various
warning signs. Well, my mother
in-law has threatened to visit,
and I am wondering if it will
detect her, and if so, what else?
- Nate

It took me about a week to find
the Stanford Electronics Labs
(SEL), mostly because it is hid
den directly behind the physics
tank, which is not somewhere 1
generally go.
You weren't kidding about that
chicken salad. In fact, there's
even a little cafeteria so
electronics nerds never have to
leave the building. But even
more exciting is the Electronics
Supply Shop, a nifty little store
that sells wires, diodes, school
supplies and just about anything
else the budding electrical engi
neering major could want. The
prices are teriffic; 1 picked up a
box of Sony Macintosh disks for

$19.74, which is $5 cheaper than
at the Bookstore. Consider that
your consumer tip of the week.
1 did indeed find the door
labeled "MAMA LABS: Center
for Space Science and Astro
physics." There were names of
three people on the door to call
for information. But look! The
door wasn't latched properly,
and I could open it and sneak in if
I wanted to . . . No, that would
be wrong.
I snuck in.
I started to look at the nifty
gadgets on the tables and the
charts and diagrams on the wall,
when suddenly a man appeared
behind me and challenged my
presence. So 1 did what any nor
mal investigative journalist
would do, I told him that I was
the author of KZSU Picks doing
a story on U2, but that I still
hadn't found what I was looking
for.
Actually the man was very
nice. He is one of the scientists
working on the Multi-Anode
MicroChannel Arrays — or
MAMA — which is a light
sensitive device used in building
the famous Hubbell Space Tele
scope. This is the space tele
scope that was supposed to go up
in the space shuttle four years
ago, before NASA ran into those
little troubles.
When installed in space, the
telescope will allow astronomers
to expand the observable uni
verse by more than 10 times. In
other words, an astronaut on the
space shuttle will actually be able

to see that tattoo of Ozzy Os
bourne you have on your butt.
I know the KCJB scours Hug
Me for state secrets, so I can't
reveal the full nature of the
MAMA thingy. Basically, the
way it works is you have a
microchannel plate with millions
of little holes in it. each of which
is 12-and-a-half microns wide. To
put this into perspective, con
sider that a human hair is 100
microns wide.
As an electron (or in this case a
photon — a light particle) enters
one of the holes, it passes down a
little curved hallway, striking the
walls and emitting more electons.
In this way. one electron is multi
plied into a million electrons, and
hence, a little faint light is mag
nified into a big bright light. You
put it all together in a telescope
and BINCIO! Suddenly you can
see where no man has seen
before.
That, in a nutshell, is the
MAMA project. They even gave
me a demonstration, and let me
tell you, it looks like it will be ter
rific when it finally gets into
space.
Dear Bug.
Three summers ago / was a
Jay camp counselor for a group
of 4-ycar-olds. At snack time I
used to as k tliem questions. and
whoever would answer first
would get an extra cookie. One
day I asked. Who's stronger,
He-Man or Superman'.' / was
bombarded with 15 cries of He-
Man!" Of course. / didn't i>ive

anybody a cookie, because from
my childhood days of "Super
friends" I knew that nobody is
stronger than Superman. So tell
me, is He-Man stronger than Su
perman?
- Rick

While Superman is
busy destroying
space criminals, He-
Man is petting his
stupid battle cat.

You see. Kick, this exemplifies
the difference between you and
me. Your biggest concern is
whether He-Man could beat up
Superman. My biggest concern is
that Counterpoint has yet to
come sing "Be My Baby" while
giving me a private Swedish
massage. Oh well.
However, you will be relieved
to hear that all experts in the field
assure me that Superman is much
stronger than He-Man, and if it
came to a tight Superman would
kick He-Man's cartoon butt all
over the universe. In fact, the
guy at Lee's Comics went so far
as to say that He-Man is "a
wimp." notwithstanding the fact
that he (He-Man, not the guy at
Lee s comics) hangs out with the
Masters of the Universe.
Let's look at it another way:

Superman has four movies, He-
Man has only one. While Super
man is busy moving planets and
destroying space criminals, He-
Man is playing with his battle
sword and petting his stupid bat
tle cat.
If they ever got into a real
fight, Superman could simply
stand back about 10 miles and
zap He-Man with his heat vision.
It would really be no contest. He-
Man can't even fly. How about
asking whether He-Man is
stronger than Garfield?
The only prayer He-Man
would have was if he had some
Kryptonite. So, if He-Man were
to steal some Kryptonite from
Food Service and use it against
Superman, he might be able to
vanquish him. But that doesn't
really count.
She-Ra, He-Man's girlfriend,
could probably kick Lois Lane,

stand back about 10 miles and
zap He-Man with his heat vision.
It would really be no contest. He-
Man can't even fly. How about
asking whether He-Man is
stronger than Garfield?
The only prayer He-Man
would have was if he had some
Kryptonite. So, if He-Man were
to steal some Kryptonite from
Food Service and use it against
Superman, he might be able to
vanquish him. But that doesn't
really count.
She-Ra, He-Man's girlfriend,
could probably kick Lois Lane,
however. She-Ra is a pretty im
posing physical figure, and I'm
pretty sure that she would just
stomp on Lois. This, naturally,
brings to mind that popular '60s
song:
He-Man's buck, and yon're
gonna get in trouble,
She-Ra, She-Ra. He-Man's
back.
A much better question would
have been "Is Superman
stronger than Zen Master
Kama?" You remember old Zen
Master, that cheesy-looking guy
with the two-page ads in The
Daily last week? 1 think he is
probably the strongest of all the
fictional characters in the world.


BUG
ME
In the spirit of Douglas
Ginsburg, 1 thought it would be
best if 1 came forth honestly with
my past activities in order to
avoid a Bug Me scandal in the fu
ture. So here goes: Once, when 1
was in elementary school, and
thew several times in junior high,
1 ate chocolate-chip cookies
before dinner knowing that it
would spoil my appetite. It was a
mistake, 1 have not done this
since, and 1 deeply regret ever
having done so.
There; I feel so much better.
On now to our Bug Me mail
bag. Regarding last week's ques
tion about time zone changes, a
former New York commuter
writes, "Don't call the airlines,
call the train dispatchers. In New
York, when 2 a.m. rolls around
on the last Sunday of October the
trains stop wherever they are.
They just wait for one hour.
Then, when 2 a.m. comes back
again, they proceed." In other
words, they just stop and pretend
the Phantom Hour doesn't exist.
This really doesn't help us with
the airline question, though, be
cause if you just shut off the
engines of a 747 in mid-air you'll
probably have better things to
worry about than what time it is.
Dear Bug,
I eat at the Stanford Elec
tronics Lahs on a regular hasis
because of the great chicken
salad. On m\ wax there, I always

notice an ominous sign on one of
the doors that says "MAMA DE
TECTOR LABS," with various
warning signs. Well, my mother
in-law has threatened to visit,
and I am wondering if it will
detect her, and if so, what else?
- Nate

It took me about a week to find
the Stanford Electronics Labs
(SEL), mostly because it is hid
den directly behind the physics
tank, which is not somewhere 1
generally go.
You weren't kidding about that
chicken salad. In fact, there's
even a little cafeteria so
electronics nerds never have to
leave the building. But even
more exciting is the Electronics
Supply Shop, a nifty little store
that sells wires, diodes, school
supplies and just about anything
else the budding electrical engi
neering major could want. The
prices are teriffic; 1 picked up a
box of Sony Macintosh disks for

$19.74, which is $5 cheaper than
at the Bookstore. Consider that
your consumer tip of the week.
1 did indeed find the door
labeled "MAMA LABS: Center
for Space Science and Astro
physics." There were names of
three people on the door to call
for information. But look! The
door wasn't latched properly,
and I could open it and sneak in if
I wanted to . . . No, that would
be wrong.
I snuck in.
I started to look at the nifty
gadgets on the tables and the
charts and diagrams on the wall,
when suddenly a man appeared
behind me and challenged my
presence. So 1 did what any nor
mal investigative journalist
would do, I told him that I was
the author of KZSU Picks doing
a story on U2, but that I still
hadn't found what I was looking
for.
Actually the man was very
nice. He is one of the scientists
working on the Multi-Anode
MicroChannel Arrays — or
MAMA — which is a light
sensitive device used in building
the famous Hubbell Space Tele
scope. This is the space tele
scope that was supposed to go up
in the space shuttle four years
ago, before NASA ran into those
little troubles.
When installed in space, the
telescope will allow astronomers
to expand the observable uni
verse by more than 10 times. In
other words, an astronaut on the
space shuttle will actually be able

to see that tattoo of Ozzy Os
bourne you have on your butt.
I know the KCJB scours Hug
Me for state secrets, so I can't
reveal the full nature of the
MAMA thingy. Basically, the
way it works is you have a
microchannel plate with millions
of little holes in it. each of which
is 12-and-a-half microns wide. To
put this into perspective, con
sider that a human hair is 100
microns wide.
As an electron (or in this case a
photon — a light particle) enters
one of the holes, it passes down a
little curved hallway, striking the
walls and emitting more electons.
In this way. one electron is multi
plied into a million electrons, and
hence, a little faint light is mag
nified into a big bright light. You
put it all together in a telescope
and BINCIO! Suddenly you can
see where no man has seen
before.
That, in a nutshell, is the
MAMA project. They even gave
me a demonstration, and let me
tell you, it looks like it will be ter
rific when it finally gets into
space.
Dear Bug.
Three summers ago / was a
Jay camp counselor for a group
of 4-ycar-olds. At snack time I
used to as k tliem questions. and
whoever would answer first
would get an extra cookie. One
day I asked. Who's stronger,
He-Man or Superman'.' / was
bombarded with 15 cries of He-
Man!" Of course. / didn't i>ive

anybody a cookie, because from
my childhood days of "Super
friends" I knew that nobody is
stronger than Superman. So tell
me, is He-Man stronger than Su
perman?
- Rick

While Superman is
busy destroying
space criminals, He-
Man is petting his
stupid battle cat.

You see. Kick, this exemplifies
the difference between you and
me. Your biggest concern is
whether He-Man could beat up
Superman. My biggest concern is
that Counterpoint has yet to
come sing "Be My Baby" while
giving me a private Swedish
massage. Oh well.
However, you will be relieved
to hear that all experts in the field
assure me that Superman is much
stronger than He-Man, and if it
came to a tight Superman would
kick He-Man's cartoon butt all
over the universe. In fact, the
guy at Lee's Comics went so far
as to say that He-Man is "a
wimp." notwithstanding the fact
that he (He-Man, not the guy at
Lee s comics) hangs out with the
Masters of the Universe.
Let's look at it another way:

Superman has four movies, He-
Man has only one. While Super
man is busy moving planets and
destroying space criminals, He-
Man is playing with his battle
sword and petting his stupid bat
tle cat.
If they ever got into a real
fight, Superman could simply
stand back about 10 miles and
zap He-Man with his heat vision.
It would really be no contest. He-
Man can't even fly. How about
asking whether He-Man is
stronger than Garfield?
The only prayer He-Man
would have was if he had some
Kryptonite. So, if He-Man were
to steal some Kryptonite from
Food Service and use it against
Superman, he might be able to
vanquish him. But that doesn't
really count.
She-Ra, He-Man's girlfriend,
could probably kick Lois Lane,
however. She-Ra is a pretty im
posing physical figure, and I'm
pretty sure that she would just
stomp on Lois. This, naturally,
brings to mind that popular '60s
song:
He-Man's buck, and yon're
gonna get in trouble,
She-Ra, She-Ra. He-Man's
back.
A much better question would
have been "Is Superman
stronger than Zen Master
Kama?" You remember old Zen
Master, that cheesy-looking guy
with the two-page ads in The
Daily last week? 1 think he is
probably the strongest of all the
fictional characters in the world.
