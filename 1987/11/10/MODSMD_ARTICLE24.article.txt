## Sweetener may soon appear in baking products Nutrasweet: Can it take the heat? 
### Jack Sculley 
Consumers may soon find an
unusual and sinister message on
the side of baking mixes and
similar products: "Warning: con
tains phenilalanine."
Similar warnings against phe
nilalanine already appear on cer
tain diet sodas, juices, frozen
desserts and teas. By sometime
next year, such warnings may
also begin appearing on a vast
new range of consumer goods.
Phenilalanine is part of
aspartame, known by the more
familiar name of Nutrasweet
brand sweetener, a low-calorie
sugar substitute.
Nutrasweet, which was first
introduced into cold cereals and
gelatin in 1974, now appears in
diet soft drinks and in packets as
a table-top sweetener.
Recent plans by some
manufacturers to include Nutra
sweet in foods that must be
cooked or baked has revived a
long-standing controversy re
garding its potential health
hazards.
The Nutrasweet Co., current
manufacturer of the product, has
petitioned the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for ap
proval of Nutrasweet in a wide
range of baked goods and mixes.
Dr. Robert Moser, vice-
President of Medical Affairs for
the Chicago-based company,
recently visited San Francisco
and the Stanford campus to an
swer questions about health con
cerns associated with Nutra
sweet.
One problem that in the past
has hindered the introduction of
Nutrasweet into consumer prod
ucts is that the sweetener, com
prised of naturally occurring phe
nilalanine and aspartic acid, is
unstable at high temperatures
and may break down into several
hazardous by-products, most
notably methanol.
Researchers at the Nutrasweet
Co. have reportedly devised a

way to prevent the release of
dangerous Nutrasweet by
products at high temperatures.
According to Moser, they have
been able to encapsulate the
aspartame in a heat-resistant or
ganic coating that releases the
aspartame only at the end of the
baking process.
The company is confident of
FDA approval and anticipates a
"vast, perhaps $ 15-billion mar
ket," Moser said.

Use of Nutrasweet in
baking could make pos
sible a 30-50 percent
reduction in a family's
caloric intake.

"The really exciting thing."
Moser said, is that "now a
housewife will have an opportu
nity to make a choice." He ex
plained that use of Nutrasweet in
baking could make possible a 30-
50 percent reduction in a family's
caloric intake.
Concerns about the stability of
Nutrasweet at high temperatures
may not be the only obstacle to
Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approval of wider use of
the chemical. Ever since the
FDA initially approved aspar
tame in 1974, a number of scien
tists and legislators have called
for its withdrawal from all
marketed goods to allow for fur
ther testing of its health effects.
A conference was held in
Washington, D.C., this summer
to discuss various health-related
concerns about aspartame.
Several researchers came for
ward with allegations that the
phenilalanine constituent of
aspartame caused, among other
things, seizures, slowed brain
waves and chronic headaches
and dizziness.
Studies were presented at the

conference by Drs. Matthew
During and Richard Wurtman of
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology concluding that high
levels of phenilalanine may inter
fere with the synthesis of
dopamine, an important chemical
"messenger" in the brain. An
other report submitted earlier by
Dr. James Blundell of Leeds Uni
versity in England claimed that
aspartame actually stimulated a
craving for carbohydrates, creat
ing a "vicious-cycle" for dieters.
Strangely enough, phenyla
lanine, the culprit of these health
dangers and the subject of the
dire warning on diet soda labels,
is a naturally occurring protein
found in the body and in a wide
range of common foods.
Aspartame contains phenila
lanine in its pure form, unmixed
with other proteins, and is thus
responsible for creating higher
blood concentrations of this
chemical than normal.
About one in 50 infants cannot
process phenilalanine efficiently,
due to a genetic disorder known
as phenylketonuria, and when
subjected to high dosages can ex
perience brain seizures and
retarded mental development.
No other food additive in the
history of the FDA has attracted
as much scrutiny as aspartame,
Moser said. All of the relevant
health concerns have been identi
fied and studied in countless ex
periments over the past 15 years,
both by government agencies and
private institutions, he argued.
Every time aspartame is sub
jected to clinical tests, it "comes
through clean," Moser said.
When it first reviewed the
product in 1974, the FDA estab
lished an "acceptable daily
intake," or ADI. of 50 milligrams
per kilogram of body weight per
day for aspartame. This includes
a built-in safety factor of 1000
percent, according to Moser. To
ingest this much Nutrasweet
would require a 130-pound per
son to drink an average of 15

cans of diet soda every day,
Moser said.
Moser charges that in almost
all of the studies presented at the
Washington meeting, the rate at
which the experimental animals
consumed Nutrasweet exceeded
the ADI for a period of many
weeks. In addition, he claims,
none of the studies contained a
control group of animals with
normal phenilalanine intake
levels for comparison with the
experimental group.
Twice in the past three years
the Senate has asked he General
Accounting Office (GAO) to
review past FDA decisions ap
proving the use of Nutrasweet,
and both times the GAO has reaf
firmed the legitimacy of the find
ings, Moser said.
Critics of Nutrasweet see these
reviews as significant and have
argued for legislation that would
tighten controls on aspartame
and require continual monitoring
of any adverse reactions to the
product by the FDA.
Moser pointed out, however,
that The Nutrasweet Co. already
voluntarily adheres to a program
of monitoring and reporting to
the FDA all of the approximately
500 annual reports of headaches
or dizziness.
According to Moser, Nutra
sweet has made possible a num
ber of important changes in the
lives of dieters and young
diabetics. Aspartame offers
serious dieters "an option, not a
panacea," he said. It is possible,
for example, to replace 200
calories in a regular soft drink
with one calorie, Moser said.
This and similar reductions can
be a major factor in a successful
weight loss program, Moser said.
Aspartame has also revolu
tionized the lives of diabetics,
many of whom had severe social
problems because of their main
tenance of a strict low-sugar diet.
According to Moser, they can
now enjoy many of the foods and
beverages that non-diabetics do.
