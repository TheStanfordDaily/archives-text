# Students to build satellite for shuttle
## 
### Kurt Boughan 
Graduate students of the
Stanford Small Satellite Pro
gram are designing and build
ing a small satellite to be used
in a NASA space shuttle mis
sion in 1991, according to engi
neering graduate student Bur
ton Lee, who heads the proj
ect.
In one 50-hour mission, the
satellite will be spring-ejected
into space and will observe
radio wave patterns.
The Stanford Small Satellite
program is the first attempt by
a student group to build a
small satellite.
Since the project's inception
in late 1985, about 80 Stanford
graduate students have had
the opportunity to join in the
effort.
According to Lee, small
satellites make space accessi
ble to small groups that have
neither the money nor the
need for state-of-the art
satellite technology.
Such satellites offer an alter
native to the large, long-term,
multi-function satellites that
currently direct communica
tions, monitor weather, ob
serve crop conditions and per
form many other tasks.
Stanford's satellite will be
only 15 inches tall and will per
form a single task; within a
few months it will burn up
upon re-entering the atmos
phere.
Dubbed SURFER for Stan
ford University Radio Fre
quency Emissions Receiver,
the Stanford satellite will mea
sure deformations in radio
waves as they propogate
through the earth's magnetic
field, Lee said.
The radio waves will be
emitted from an antenna

suspended 300 kilometers
above the earth. The antenna,
20 kilometers long, will be
strung between another
satellite and a space shuttle.
When the antenna is fully
extended, SURFER will be
ejected from its storage con
tainer in the shuttle and will
folio a zig-zag course about
1 (X) miles away from the the
transmitting antenna.
Once activated, SURFER
will feed its data to space
shuttle computers and to the
Space, Telecommunications
and Radio Science Laboratory
(STARLAB) at Stanford.
According to Lee, the Stan
ford satellite program will
survive after SURFER be
cause a surge of interest in
small satellites is likely —
even by government and big
which can afford
the larger, more sophisticated
satellites.
The use of expendable,
"low-tech" satellites for indi
vidual tasks can be a more effi
cient and economical use of
space, no matter how great a
group's resources, Lee ex
plained.
Even undergraduates and
non-scientists can become in
volved in some aspect of the
project, Lee said.
The project is independently
funded, but students work for
credit, not money. Although,
it has survived on sporadic
NASA grants, Lee expects
funding to increase as govern
ment and industry realize the
advantages of small satellites.
SURFER, Lee hopes, is
only the first of a long line of
satellites to be produced every
two to three years by members
of a permanent small satellite
program at Stanford.
