## Elway plans changes for final two games 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
With just two games left in the 1987
football season, things still aren't settled
in the Stanford lineup.
"This week we will be analyzing defen
sive personnel and consider some person
nel changes, particularly on the perimeter
of the defense," Stanford Coach Jack El
way said yesterday.
Elway, whose squad is 3-6 overall and
2-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference, also said
he will not be "locked into" using just
one quarterback in a game and that he
plans to move Brad Muster to fullback
from the tailback position.
"It makes a lot of difference in how

many times he'll get the football in those
formations," Elway said. " The fullback
is primarily a running back rather than a
blocking back for us."
Elway said he will not hesitate to move
Muster around in different formations
and will put the senior at slot back and
side back in certain situations, especially
with Jon Volpe in the game.
Elway brought senior Greg Ennis in at
quarterback late in the fourth quarter at
USC, and although starter Brian Johnson
came back in to throw a 29-yard touch
down pass to Muster after Ennis was
knocked out of the contest with a concus
sion, the Stanford coach said he will

After his team's sub-par defensive performance against USC last Saturday, Stanford
Coach Jack Elway may make some position changes in the secondary, including switching
free safety Bruce Richardson (23) and strong safety Brad Humphreys.
make changes at signal-caller
during future games if he feels
the starter is not executing.
"We didn't go into the game
with the thought that we'd go all
the way with one quarterback,"
Elway said, "and it's going to be
that way until the end of the
season.
"When things are going good
and things are getting done, that
will be fine," Elway continued,
"but Ennis can do some things
Johnson can't and if the problem
is focused on the quarterback,
we're not $oing to be locked into
any one thing."
Although Johnson threw three
interceptions against UCLA, El
way felt the sophomore's per
formance had improved from the
previous week, when he had four
passes picked otT by Arizona's
Chuck Cecil. "Johnson stepped
up and found the secondary
receivers,' he said. "There were
some good things there."
Opposing team quarterbacks,
however, concern Elway more
than his own at the moment.
Trojan Rodney Peete (17-of-20
passing for 273 yards and five
touchdowns) was just the latest
in a long line of enemy quarter
backs — such as San Diego
State's Todd Santos, UCLA's
Troy Aikman and even Arizona
freshman Rodney Veal — to dis
mantle the Stanford pass
defense.
With Oregon State's pass
happy shotgun offense next on
tap for the Cardinal, Elway is
even more concerned about his
defensive secondary. "We'll be
looking at our free safety situa
tion and looking at our inside
linebackers," Elway said.
"More awareness is the
thing. . . . It's a matter of react
ing to a quarterback, reacting to
balls once they're in the air and
being more aggressive when the
ball is in the air," Elway said.
"We know we have a problem
with the forward pass."
