Elway, whose squad is 3-6 overall and
2-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference, also said
he will not be "locked into" using just
one quarterback in a game and that he

from the tailback position.
"It makes a lot of difference in how

blocking back for us."
Elway said he will not hesitate to move
Muster around in different formations
and will put the senior at slot back and
side back in certain situations, especially

USC, and although starter Brian Johnson
came back in to throw a 29-yard touch
down pass to Muster after Ennis was
knocked out of the contest with a concus
