# Athletic facilities to improve
## 
### 
"Westward Ho!" seems to be the
rallying cry about the University these
days, as the Near West Campus is
slowly becoming reality, the Medical
Center is bursting at the seams and the
next student housing development will
likely be on the golf driving range.

The Athletic Department has also
decided to follow this trend and
recently announced plans for an Athle
tics West Quad. Before this new facil
ity is built, though, the department
plans to complete construction of an
Athletics East Quad.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger called
the planned $35 million building pro
gram "thrilling" and added, "If we can
do that, we'll be in good shape for the
intercollegiate program, and we'll also
make ourself more competitive in a
student-life situation with schools like
Harvard, Yale and Princeton."
It's an ambitious plan designed to
take Stanford's competition and recre
ation facilities into the 21st century,
and it's about time. As they stand now,
Stanford's recreational facilities are
pathetic.
Roble pool is virtually unswim
mable, the Encina weight room is in
credibly overcrowded and the facilities
in general are of 1930s vintage.
The Athletics East Quad will attempt
to spruce up some of these older build
ings while integrating them with some
newer facilities into a cohesive whole.
The cornerstone of the project is the
reclamation of Old Pavilion from the
University administration.
When it was built in 1922 with 30(H)
seats, Old Pavilion was the largest
building in the country devoted
primarily to basketball, a kind of Rupp
Arena of the 19205, but it was con
verted into an administration building
in 1977.
It will revert to its athletic roots
soon, though, when the administrators
it houses are moved into a new facility

planned for the open triangle of land
formed by Campus Drive and Serra
Street. Old Pavilion would then likely
hold a competition space for volleyball,
wrestling and other sports and seat
2500 to 3000 spectators.
A new gymnasium, which will pro
vide gymnastics and wrestling practice
facilities, as well as two basketball
courts and locker rooms, will be flush
with the rear of the renovated Old
Pavilion.
The high-bay rooms in Encina Gym,
which currently house gymnastics and
wrestling, will be demolished, and the
rest of Encina will be renovated. It was
deemed too costly to renovate the high
bay area, but the rest of Encina will
likely house an expanded football suite
in one wing and a fitness area/weight
room in the other.
The Athletics Administration Build
ing will probably change little, and an
arcade is planned between all three
structures. This arcade will enclose an
open "sports plaza," which will be
landscaped and available for every
thing from tossing a frisbee to holding
parties.

Once the East Quad is completed,
the Athletic Department will shift its
attention to the other side of campus
and the proposed West Quad.
The facility, to be located west of
Campus Drive near the new tennis
courts, will replace Roble Gym and is
designed to be built in stages as funds
become available. The University
wants to use Roble for either
academics or student services, al
though it would seem much easier to
just leave it as a gym.
The first phase of the West Quad will
be the construction of a 50-meter pool
and adjacent locker rooms. According
to Assoc. Athletic Director Alan Cum
mings, the pool will be used solely for

recreation and will relieve the pressure
on a badly overcrowded deGuerre Pool
and an outdated Roble Pool.
"I think there's a high demand for a
swimming facility," he said. "We're
quite anxious to make an improvement
in our swimming facilities."
Step two involves the addition of two
basketball courts and offices, and
phase three will complete the encircle
ment of an inner courtyard by adding
several racquetball courts and areas for
dance, weight training and martial arts.
A final project will include the addi
tion of playing fields on the site.
These plans aren't just wishful think
ing. The Athletic Department already
has $6 million in pledges and has
recently completed a comprehensive
$2(X),(KH) planning report.
While the exact building plans are
merely rough estimates at this point,
the general scheme has been set. The
timetable involved in this project is a
little daunting, though.
There is a slim chance that the com
pleted Athletics Hast Quad will be
available before this year's freshmen
graduate in 1991, but a lot depends on
how quickly Old Pavilion becomes
available. The West Quad probably
won't be complete until the mid- to
late-19905, so unless anyone plans to
stay around for a Ph.D. or two, current
students will not reap the benefits.
Current students will be able to en
joy the new Bud Klein Varsity Club
house at Sunken Diamond. The club
house is slated to be completed soon
and will provide a locker room for the
Cardinal as well as restrooms (no more
running into the bushes) and other
amenities. It will also serve as the main
entrance to Sunken Diamond.
Another project that may get off the
ground soon is a renovation of the Ten
nis Stadium. Coaches Dick Gould and
Frank Brennan are raising funds in
hopes of constructing a new stadium
adjacent to the clubhouse.
The focal point of the building pro
gram, however, remains the East and
West Quads, and models are on displa\
in the Athletic Administration Build
ing.
"We're excited about the prospect
of building first-class athletic
facilities," Cummings said. "We
would like to invite the community to
come by and see what our plans are."
