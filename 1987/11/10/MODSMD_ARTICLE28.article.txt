# Field hockey gets NCAA bid
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
The Stanford field hockey team sealed its third
consecutive invitation to the NCAA Champion
ships last Saturday when California defeated San
Jose State.
By virtue of the Bears' victory, Stanford finished
the season a full game ahead of the Spartans and
one-half game ahead of CaJ in the Northern Pacific
Conference. The Cardinal finished the regular
season at 6-1-1 in league play and 10-5-1 overall. It
was Stanford's third straight conference title.
The Cardinal now heads to the Midwest regional
of the NCAA tournament to play Northwestern
Saturday. If Stanford emerges victorious against
the Wildcats, the Cardinal will square off against
lowa in an effort to reach the Final Four.
The Cardinal has never advanced past the first
round in two previous trips to the NCAAs. In 1985
Stanford fell to Northwestern, and in 1986 the team
dropped its opening game to the Hawkeyes. Ironi
cally, both those games were decided by 3-0
scores, and both were played in the Midwest
regional.
"Last year's game against lowa (in the NCAAs)
was a lot closer than the score indicated,'' Stanford
Coach Sheryl Johnson said. "We've already

beaten Northwestern this year, which gives the
team confidence going in. . . . We can advance in
this tournament. We're due."
Despite its late season slide, the Cardinal has
proven it can play with the best teams in the
country. In an East Coast road trip early in the
season, the Cardinal played national powers
Westchester State and Delaware even, and, in its
second game of the season, defeated highly touted
Northwestern. Westchester State will be a factor in
the NCAAs, as illustrated by its 18-2-1 regular
season mark.
Despite the Cardinal's No. 12 seeding in the 12-
team field, Johnson isn't worried. "We're always
seeded last," she said. "It just means we have
nothing to lose."
Stanford will depend on an outstanding defensive
effort in the playoffs, just as it has all year long.
Junior goalie Karen Jones and senior midfielder
Ami Chitwood lead a stingy unit that gave up a
mere 0.63 goals per game during the regular year.
But the team will obviously have to put the ball in
the cage if it expects to win games.
"We can score," Johnson said. "We're a turf
team, and that's what we'll be playing on. That's
where our passing combinations work best.
"We want to make it to the final four. That's our
goal."
