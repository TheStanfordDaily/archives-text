## 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff Writer 
In a dramatic finale to a strong
fall season, the Stanford sailing
team swept all four scoring divi
sions this weekend on its way to
winning the annual North-South
Championship Regatta.
The event, held this year on
Lake Cachuma near Santa Bar
bara, was the most important
West Coast regatta of the fall
season. It determined which na
tional regattas each team will
qualify for in the spring, and it is
an important factor in the na
tional rankings.
After the Cardinal's convinc
ing win at this year's champion
ship. Stanford will likely receive
invitations to the major East
Coast regattas this spring, and
will probably move up from its

current No. 12 national ranking
to a position in the top 10.
"It takes a mature, responsible
approach and a serious effort to
compete on this level of college
sailing," freshman Kevin Hagen
said. "We did well because we're
dedicated to winning the nation
als this year."
The North-South regatta was
comprised of two two-person
team divisions using Flying
Junior-class sailboats, and of two
one-per son divisions using
Laser-class boats.
As this year's regatta drew to a
close, it was clear that no team
would come close to matching
Stanford's record: Cardinal
sailors won each of the four divi
sions by commanding margins.
In the Flying Junior A division,
seniors Dan Buckstaff and Kath
leen Mallery took first place in

their fleet for the second year in a
row, consistently staying in the
top three to end with a seven
point lead. In the B division,
senior Drew Gashler and Hagan
also stayed at the top of the pack
throughout the entire regatta and
closed with a win in the last race
and an overall victory.
In the singlehanded C division,
senior Tom Kuhnle fought his
way to the top of a talented fleet
and earned the Cardinal's third
divisional win. That left sopho
more Al Sargent to clean up the
singlehanded D division with an
eight-point lead.
"This was a great way to end
the season," Stanford Coach
Blake Middleton said. "Our
scoring sailors were consistent
and avoided any big errors, and
they won the regatta in a really
convincing style.
