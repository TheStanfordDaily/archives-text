# Multicultural Council member clarifies remarks
## Law School student withdraws statements 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
A member of the student Multicul
tural Council of the Law School yes
terday withdrew statements he made
on behalf of the council after a
meeting Friday with Law School
Dean Paul Brest.
Scott Doering, a third-year law stu
dent, said that the proposals he
related to The Daily Sunday concern
ing the Law School's non
discrimination and affirmative action
policies were "strictly my own
opinion" and were not submitted for
mally to Brest as part of a public ne
gotiation process.

Some of the proposals Doering
originally said were offered to Brest
included sanctions against law firms
engaged in discriminatory practices
and goals for minority faculty recruit
ment in future appointments.
Brest and second-year law student
Jesus Berbal, who was yesterday
named spokesman for the council,
denied that formal proposals for
policy changes had been made at the
Friday meeting.
Brest, who is traveling on the East
Coast this week, said last night that
"there was a very good informal dis
cussion" Friday between him and
council members Doering, Peter
Haviland and Greer Bosworth. He

declined to comment further.
The policy denies the use of Law
School "facilities and services to
employers who discriminate. The
policy was designed to punish
employers who make derogatory
remarks in job interviews here. Law
School administrators have main
tained, but it has come under fire be
cause law firms accused of discrimi
natory acts elsewhere have been
allowed this year to interview.
In one instance, a Stanford law stu
dent alleged that he had been denied
a job by a Los Angeles firm for ra
cially biased reasons. Victor Minjares
said after he complained about a ra
cial epithet leveled at him by a firm

associate he was not offered a posi
tion with the firm.
In an earlier episode last month,
students protested that a Chicago
based firm was allowed to interview
on campus even though it is being
sued by an New York associate who
says he was fired because he has
AIDS.
Berbal, who was not present at the
meeting Friday, had no comment last
night on the meeting, but would not
refute Doering's assessment that the
meeting had focused on alternative
means of enforcing the non
discrimination policy and encourag
ing the appointment of more minority
faculty.
