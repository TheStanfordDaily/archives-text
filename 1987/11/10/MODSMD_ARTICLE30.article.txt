# Hoops to play in Card-White contest
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Holy smokes folks, it's time
for hoops.
Tonight — yes, that's
tonight — in Roscoe Maples
Pavilion the Stanford men's
basketball team will give its
first public performance of the
1987-88 season in the annual
Cardinal-White intrasquad
scrimmage.
TipofT is at 7 p.m., and ad
mission is free.
Second-year Coach Mike
Montgomery's Cardinal squad
has received the most
preseason accolades in many a
moon. Six national publica
tions have predicted that Stan
ford will finish third in the
Pacific 10 Conference, behind
Arizona and UCLA.
Those publications include
The Sporting News v Street &
Smith's Basketball and Dick
Vitale's Basketball. And The
Sporting News projects Stan
ford to be an NCAA tourna
ment team.
These are quite lofty expec
tations by Cardinal standards,
especially since this is only
Montgomery's second year at
the helm.
Stanford star Todd Lichti
agrees that the Cardinal's fu
ture is looking better. "We're
a lot further along than we
were last year (at this time),"
Lichti said. "Everybody got
better over the summer, and
this is the second year in the
(Montgomery) system, so we
know better what to expect
from the coach and each
other."
Tonight Montgomery ex
pects competitive perfor
mances from his players.

"A lot of playing time hasn't
been determined yet, so we're
starting to see guys get more
competitive," Montgomery
said. "With the video camera
on them and a referee, guys
will tend to play harder than
they might in practice."
Montgomery intends to play
his top 10 players for most of
the first half and then start to
mix things up in the second
half.
"I want to look at the veter
ans on the first team, but this
year we've got more depth, so
I can put a competitive second
team out there," he said.
Depth may become a Stan
ford strength this season,
despite the loss of senior cap
tain Eric Reveno for the year
due to a back injury. The Car
dinal returns nine lettermen
(not including Reveno) and
will also be bolstered by the
entrance of redshirt freshman
forward Deshon Wingate and
true freshman forward An
drew Vlahov.
With the addition of Vlahov
and Wingate in the frontcourt,
Lichti will probably move into
the off-guard position. Lichti
will join fellow junior Terry
Taylor in the starting back
court.
The front court, however, is
not as set in stone. Vlahov and
Wingate will be fighting veter
ans Greg Butler, Brian
McSweeney and Howard
Wright for playing time.
Tonight's festivities will
take place in a more festive
looking Maples Pavilion. The
lower gray concrete walls
have been been painted white,
and four giant Stanford insig
nias have also been added.
