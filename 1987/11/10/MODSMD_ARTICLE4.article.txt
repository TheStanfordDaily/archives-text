# Research center to focus on education
## 
### Sky Gallegos 
The Stanford School of Educa
tion has won a $2.7-million grant
from the U.S. Department of Ed
ucation for a research center to
study teaching in secondary
public schools.
Education Prof. Milbrey
McLaughlin, who will serve as
the center's director, said Stan
ford survived "stiff competition"
to become part of a network of
centers in a federal effort for
focused research in education.
The Stanford center, which
will be called the Center for the
Study of Teachers and Teaching
in the Secondary School Con
text, will be unique because it
will study both teaching and stu
dent perfo. ,iance and because it
will examine all academic sub
jects instead of focusing on a

single one, McLaughlin said.
Data for the Stanford center's
studies will be provided in part
by a Department of Education
study of more than 20,000 stu
dents in the eighth through to
12th grades in approximately
HHX) schools.
Joan Talbert, associate direc
tor of the new center, said that
researchers will use this national
(lata to do representative field
studies of typical schools across
the nation.
"The schools will be chosen
according to the states used in
the nationwide study and a sam
pling frame that's not yet been
finalized," Talbert said. She esti
mated that the schools would be
selected by the summer of I9BH.
According to McLaughlin,
"This is the first time with a
major national survey that a cen

ter will be able to identify a
school that has been chosen for a
survey and then go and do field
work in it. That's the most im
portant innovation and what's
exciting about this."
Three other research studies
will be conducted by the center.
One project will study various
teaching policies at schools from
different states. Another will ex
amine inner-city schools, and a
third will focus on schools in
which teachers have more au
thority than is typical in most
high schools.
"They all draw from the same
conceptual framework but have
different contexts," McLaughlin
said.
"The whole purpose of this
project is to identify strategies
available to educators and to

policy makers who want to
change the secondary school set
ting" so that teachers can he
more effective with their stu
dents, she said.
McLaughlin and Talbert are
planning conferences with ex
perts to help develop a research
design. They are also meeting
with teachers "to get a feel for
their views on what's important
for us to understand," McLaugh
lin explained. Most recent school
reform policies "evolved without
the input of teachers," she said.
Seminars have begun for grad
uate students who will be con
ducting the research. The num
ber of students participating is
small, but McLaughlin said she
expects it to double soon. "This
is a major opportunity for our
students to get out there and ac
tually do research," she said.
