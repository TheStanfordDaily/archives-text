### Hsuan Sze 
The regional president of the
National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People
last night urged young people to
take an active role in social and
political issues.
According to Harrison Peo
ples, president of the NAACP's
Northern California and Hawaii
State Conference, black students
have the strength to accomplish
social change "because they
have connection to the commu
nity, to the country and to the
world."
Peoples encouraged black stu
dents to take up concrete issues
such as university admissions
policy, college attrition rates and

hiring practices.
He also encouraged black stu
dents to join organizations such
as the NAACP. He asked those
in attendence to repeat after him,
"I am proud of who I am and
where 1 came from."
He urge black students to reg
ister to vote and to take a politi
cal stand. He pointed out that
black votes in the South make a
difference in sending senators to
Washington. "We cannot be
complacent," Peoples said. "We
need to get involved."
Peoples said that the NAACP
is "one of the most dynamic or
ganizations of the world which
fights for equality and justice for
mankind."
He praised the organization

for raising the nation s social
consciousness and battling civil
injustice in the courts.
Organized in 1909, the
NAACP is the nation's oldest
civil rights organization. The
NAACP, Peoples said, forms
special task forces to bring cases
of civil rights violations to court.
Peoples said that police often
treat cases of violent racial preju
dice as simple crimes of assault
and battery. The NAACP inves
tigates such cases and brings
them to higher courts, he said.
Peoples added that the civil
rights gains made by the NAACP
in the nation's courts have also
benefited minorities other than
blacks, including women,
Asians, Chicanos and Native

Americans.
Peoples told a gathering of
about 25 in Ujamaa lounge that
the NAACF did not make its po
sition public on the recent nomi
nation of Judge Robert Bork to
the Supreme Court, but chose in
stead instead to work quietly.
The approach was successful.
Peoples said.
Peoples said that racial preju
dice is definitely evident on the
job or in day-to-day interaction
with others.
He encouraged Stanford stu
dents to work hard at their edu
cation. He also advised students
"never to look down on the per
son next to them and to not judge
people by their status."
