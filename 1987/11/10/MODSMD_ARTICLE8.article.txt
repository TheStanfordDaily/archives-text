IRA admits planting deadly bomb
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — The Provisional Irish Repub
lican Army admitted yesterday that it planted the bomb that
killed 11 persons and injured 63 during a solemn veterans' day
ceremony Sunday, but it said that civilians were killed only be
cause the explosion had been triggered prematurely by a British
Army electronic bomb-search device.
The British government denied that the Army set off the ex
plosion in Enniskillen, southwest of here, and the Royal Ulster
Constabulary said that no such equipment was in use at the
time.
Minister for Northern Ireland Tom King called the IRA claim
"disgraceful," "untrue" and "a pathetic attempt to transfer
blame."
The bomb's location, in a community center building next to a
town square where spectators gathered to honor British war
dead, guaranteed that civilians would be victims, King said.
Gerry Adams, the president of the IRA's Sinn Fein political
wing, clearly troubled by widespread public outrage over one of
the deadliest attacks in the IRA's history, issued an unusual
statement expressing "regret" over the bombing.
In recent years, the IRA has sought to avoid killing civilians
because of the negative political impact of such attacks. In Sun
day's bombing, however, the dead were civilians, although one
man belonged to the police reserves. Seven of the dead were
retired persons more than 60 years old, and one was a 20-year
old student nurse.
Dow, dollar take another beating
LOS ANGELES — Concern about inaction on the U.S.
budget deficit pummeled the dollar and U.S. stocks yesterday,
pushing the greenback to new postwar lows against two key
foreign currencies while driving the Dow Jones industrial
average to another sharp decline.
The dollar, continuing its free fall since the stock market
crash Oct. 19, hit postwar lows against the West German mark
and Japanese yen in nervous trading yesterday. It also hit 5- to
7-year lows against the Swiss, French, Dutch, Italian and
British currencies.
The dollar's decline in turn helped trigger a broad stock sell
off that knocked the Dow average to a 58.85-point drubbing,
closing at 1900.20. That equaled a loss of 3 percent and was the
ninth-largest single-day point drop ever for the widely watched
average of blue-chip stocks.
Big Board volume, however, tumbled to a mere 160.69 million
shares, down from 228.29 million in last Friday's session and the
slowest since Oct. 12, one week before Black Monday. By con
trast, NYSE volume on Black Monday reached 604.33 million
shares.
The dual declines of the dollar and stocks showed that the
volatility and uneasiness gripping the financial markets since the
stock crash are still far from ending.
Bomb rips Sri Lanka, kills several
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (DPA) — Scores of people were killed
and many more injured yesterday when a bomb exploded in
central Colombo during rush hour.
Police and hospital sources were unable to determine the
death toll because many of the bodies had been blown to pieces,
although some police officials said they believed that as many as
50 people may have died. Earlier estimates put the death toll at
nearly 100, while eye-witnesses initially said 200 had died.
Metropolitan police said that the bomb, carried either in a car
or a bus that was moving slowly with the rush-hour traffic at a
busy junction just outside Maradana railway station, exploded
about 5:30 p.m.
A few feet from the blast was a heavily guarded police station
with at least 500 men inside. Several policemen on traffic duty
and some of those guarding the station were among the
casualties.
The majority of those killed and injured were Sinhalese
civilians, most of them office and factory workers returning
from work. Several children also were killed, police said.
At least 25 vehicles, including eight buses, were destroyed.
Deputy Inspector General of Police Neil Weerasinghe said
last night that the Maradana bomb was as powerful as a bomb
that exploded at a bus station in April, killing at least 120. Tamil
separatist rebels were blamed for that incident.
Bob Dole makes candidacy official
RUSSELL, Kan. — Kansas Sen. Bob Dole returned to his
roots in the Midwestern heartland yesterday to announce his
candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination and to
pronounce the federal budget deficit to be "the single greatest
threat" to the nation's economic health.
Wearing a gray topcoat against the chill of the November
morning. Dole made his declaration before several thousand en
thusiastic supporters at an outdoor rally on Main Street in this
town of about 5000 where he was born and raised — and to
which he returned to recover from the combat wounds he suf
fered in World War 11.
High school bands played, and blue and yellow balloons
soared into the bright sky as Dole pledged to draw on "the
strength and determination molded in America's small town
heartland" to develop "common sense" solutions to the prob
lems facing the nation.
Dole, regarded as the chief rival to Vice President George
Bush, the front-runner in the GOP competition, sought to link
himself to previous heartland presidents — among whom he
cited Abraham Lincoln, Harry Truman and Ronald Reagan.
One of their common traits, he asserted, was "plain speaking."
But in addressing these issues in his 30-minute announcement
address, Dole's remarks at times were cloaked in what seemed
to be calculated ambiguity.
Former officials contradict Deaver
WASHINGTON — Former national security adviser Robert
McFarlane and two other former officials of the Reagan admin
istration testified yesterday that former presidential aide Mi
chael Deaver was involved in high-level talks on the Canadian
acid rain problem despite Deaver's sworn testimony that he
could not recall such discussions.
The statements by McFarlane, former U.S. Ambassador Paul
Robinson Jr. and former National Security Council aide Robert
Kimmitt marked the most damaging day of testimony against
Deaver as the perjury trial of President Reagan's former aide
and confidant began its fourth week.
Independent counsel Whitney North Seymour Jr., who called
the three witnesses, is trying to prove to a federal court jury that
Deaver lied to investigators about his previous involvement
with Canadian acid rain to help protect a lucrative $105,000 lob
bying contract he signed with the Canadian government shortly
after leaving the White House in May 1985.

"disgraceful," "untrue" and "a pathetic attempt to transfer
blame."
The bomb's location, in a community center building next to a
town square where spectators gathered to honor British war
dead, guaranteed that civilians would be victims, King said.
Gerry Adams, the president of the IRA's Sinn Fein political
wing, clearly troubled by widespread public outrage over one of
the deadliest attacks in the IRA's history, issued an unusual
statement expressing "regret" over the bombing.
In recent years, the IRA has sought to avoid killing civilians
because of the negative political impact of such attacks. In Sun
day's bombing, however, the dead were civilians, although one
man belonged to the police reserves. Seven of the dead were
retired persons more than 60 years old, and one was a 20-year
old student nurse.
Dow, dollar take another beating
LOS ANGELES — Concern about inaction on the U.S.
budget deficit pummeled the dollar and U.S. stocks yesterday,
pushing the greenback to new postwar lows against two key
foreign currencies while driving the Dow Jones industrial
average to another sharp decline.
The dollar, continuing its free fall since the stock market
crash Oct. 19, hit postwar lows against the West German mark
and Japanese yen in nervous trading yesterday. It also hit 5- to
7-year lows against the Swiss, French, Dutch, Italian and
British currencies.
The dollar's decline in turn helped trigger a broad stock sell
off that knocked the Dow average to a 58.85-point drubbing,
closing at 1900.20. That equaled a loss of 3 percent and was the
ninth-largest single-day point drop ever for the widely watched
average of blue-chip stocks.
Big Board volume, however, tumbled to a mere 160.69 million
shares, down from 228.29 million in last Friday's session and the
slowest since Oct. 12, one week before Black Monday. By con
trast, NYSE volume on Black Monday reached 604.33 million
shares.
The dual declines of the dollar and stocks showed that the
volatility and uneasiness gripping the financial markets since the
stock crash are still far from ending.
Bomb rips Sri Lanka, kills several
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (DPA) — Scores of people were killed
and many more injured yesterday when a bomb exploded in
central Colombo during rush hour.
Police and hospital sources were unable to determine the
death toll because many of the bodies had been blown to pieces,
although some police officials said they believed that as many as
50 people may have died. Earlier estimates put the death toll at
nearly 100, while eye-witnesses initially said 200 had died.
Metropolitan police said that the bomb, carried either in a car
or a bus that was moving slowly with the rush-hour traffic at a
busy junction just outside Maradana railway station, exploded
about 5:30 p.m.
A few feet from the blast was a heavily guarded police station
with at least 500 men inside. Several policemen on traffic duty
and some of those guarding the station were among the
casualties.
The majority of those killed and injured were Sinhalese
civilians, most of them office and factory workers returning
from work. Several children also were killed, police said.
At least 25 vehicles, including eight buses, were destroyed.
Deputy Inspector General of Police Neil Weerasinghe said
last night that the Maradana bomb was as powerful as a bomb
that exploded at a bus station in April, killing at least 120. Tamil
separatist rebels were blamed for that incident.
Bob Dole makes candidacy official
RUSSELL, Kan. — Kansas Sen. Bob Dole returned to his
roots in the Midwestern heartland yesterday to announce his
candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination and to
pronounce the federal budget deficit to be "the single greatest
threat" to the nation's economic health.
Wearing a gray topcoat against the chill of the November
morning. Dole made his declaration before several thousand en
thusiastic supporters at an outdoor rally on Main Street in this
town of about 5000 where he was born and raised — and to
which he returned to recover from the combat wounds he suf
fered in World War 11.
High school bands played, and blue and yellow balloons
soared into the bright sky as Dole pledged to draw on "the
strength and determination molded in America's small town
heartland" to develop "common sense" solutions to the prob
lems facing the nation.
Dole, regarded as the chief rival to Vice President George
Bush, the front-runner in the GOP competition, sought to link
himself to previous heartland presidents — among whom he
cited Abraham Lincoln, Harry Truman and Ronald Reagan.
One of their common traits, he asserted, was "plain speaking."
But in addressing these issues in his 30-minute announcement
address, Dole's remarks at times were cloaked in what seemed
to be calculated ambiguity.
Former officials contradict Deaver
WASHINGTON — Former national security adviser Robert
McFarlane and two other former officials of the Reagan admin
istration testified yesterday that former presidential aide Mi
chael Deaver was involved in high-level talks on the Canadian
acid rain problem despite Deaver's sworn testimony that he
could not recall such discussions.
The statements by McFarlane, former U.S. Ambassador Paul
Robinson Jr. and former National Security Council aide Robert
Kimmitt marked the most damaging day of testimony against
Deaver as the perjury trial of President Reagan's former aide
and confidant began its fourth week.
Independent counsel Whitney North Seymour Jr., who called
the three witnesses, is trying to prove to a federal court jury that
Deaver lied to investigators about his previous involvement
with Canadian acid rain to help protect a lucrative $105,000 lob
bying contract he signed with the Canadian government shortly
after leaving the White House in May 1985.

IRA admits planting deadly bomb
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — The Provisional Irish Repub
lican Army admitted yesterday that it planted the bomb that
killed 11 persons and injured 63 during a solemn veterans' day
ceremony Sunday, but it said that civilians were killed only be
cause the explosion had been triggered prematurely by a British
Army electronic bomb-search device.
The British government denied that the Army set off the ex
plosion in Enniskillen, southwest of here, and the Royal Ulster
Constabulary said that no such equipment was in use at the
time.
