# Sandinista-contra talks demanded
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan said yesterday that the
United States would be willing to
participate in peace talks with
Nicaragua and other Central
American nations when Nica
ragua's Sandinista government
begins "serious negotiations"
with the U.S.-backed contra
rebels.
But Reagan, speaking at the
opening of the annual Organiza
tion of American States foreign
ministers meeting, stressed that
regional negotiations involving
the United States and the Central
American nations "cannot be a
substitute" for direct talks be
tween the Sandinistas and the
contras.
His remarks were the first offi
cial U.S. response to Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega's an
nouncement last week that the
Sandinistas would agree to talk
with contra leaders through inter
mediaries. Until then, the Nica
raguan government had balked at
conducting any discussions with
the contras, asserting that it
would talk only with the United

States.
The president's pledge of pos
sible U.S. involvement in future
peace efforts underscored the
United States' policy since it
broke off negotiations with Nica
ragua in January 1985 to resume
talks with the Sandinistas if they
meet U.S. demands for greater
freedom in Nicaragua.
But U.S. officials also said that
when Ortega visits Washington
this week to address the OAS, no
one-on-one talks with U.S. offi
cials are expected.
Secretary of State George
Shultz told a press conference at
OAS headquarters that the San
dinistas were "not yet appar
ently" ready to meet the U.S.
conditions for renewed high-level
contacts.
When asked whether Nica
ragua could comply with the
U.S. demands by the time Ortega
addresses the OAS tomorrow,
Shultz replied, "It doesn't take
long to let people out of jail; all
you have to do is open the doors.
It doesn't take long to approve
applications for publications; all

you have to do is check the
'approve' box. It doesn't take
long for Radio Catolica to be able
to make comments on the issues
of the day; all you have to do is
say OK. So it can happen instan
taneously.
"As far as the fundamental
matter — namely, talks with the
democratic resistance — that is
something that has been sitting
there to do ever since the
Guatemala City accords," he
said. "El Salvador has done it;
Guatemala has done it; Nica
ragua has just recently said that
maybe, under some circum
stances, they might."
The Guatemala City accords,
drawn up by Costa Rican Presi
dent Oscar Arias, are the basis
for the current efforts to achieve
a cease-fire in the various con
flicts in Central America. In addi
tion to the cease-fire, they call
for reconciliation between gov
ernments and rebels, democratic
reforms and a halt to military aid
from outside the region. The par
ticipants in the accord include
Honduras and El Salvador, as

well as Nicaragua, Costa Rica
and Guatemala.
When asked for his reaction to
Managua's announcement that
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo
would be asked to serve as an in
termediary for talks between the
Sandinistas and the contras,
Shultz said the cardinal was "an
outstanding individual on a world
scale."
Reagan, too, welcomed the
designation of the cardinal as the
mediator. "The indirect talks the
Sandinistas have now agreed to
are a way to start" the peace
process, Reagan said. "It
remains clear that the next step
must be direct negotia
tions. . .
"When serious negotiations
between the Sandinistas and the
freedom fighters under the
mediation of Cardinal Obando
are under way, Secretary Shultz
will be ready to meet jointly with
the foreign ministers of all five
Central American nations, in
cluding the Sandinistas' repre
sentative," the president said.
