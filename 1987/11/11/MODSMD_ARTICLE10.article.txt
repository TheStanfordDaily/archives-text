# Shultz: Postpone contra aid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Secretary of State
George Shultz, saying that the United States
would "give peace every chance," told
Central American diplomats yesterday that
the Reagan administration would not seek
new aid for contra forces inside Nicaragua
until next year, after compliance with a
regional peace plan could be measured.
In remarks to the Organization of Ameri
can States General Assembly, Shultz also
warned that the United States would not
remain idle if Nicaragua used that delay to
press a major military offensive against
depleted rebel forces.
Shultz spoke to the organization's annual
assembly only hours after Nicaraguan Presi
dent Daniel Ortega arrived in Washington on
his first visit in eight years. He is scheduled
to speak to the same group today.
Tne secretary's conciliatory remarks,
along with Ortega's hastily scheduled visit to
the Organization of American States gather
ing, stirred speculation that new efforts may
be at hand to implement the shaky Central
American peace agreement signed in August
by Nicaragua and its four neighbors.
Earlier yesterday, a Shultz spokesman
rejected outright the prospect of any direct
meeting between administration officials and
Ortega during his three-day Washington visit.
However, Ortega reportedly will meet
House Speaker Jim Wright, (D-Texas), the
major congressional figure in the peace proc
ess, to discuss a possible role for Wright in
overseeing or arranging a cease-tire between
Ortega's government and the contras.
Both Wright and Ortega also may meet this

week with Nicaragua's Roman Catholic
primate, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo,
whom Ortega asked last week to serve as a
go-between in the cease-fire talks.
Obando has not formally accepted the of
fer, but Contra political leader Adolfo Calero,
also in Washington for a speech and discus
sions with Central American diplomats, said
yesterday that the cardinal was "very much
disposed" to broker the talks if the church
would permit him to do so.
Shultz's 32-minute speech to the Organiza
tion of American States broke no new
diplomatic ground. It did underscore new
American willingness to give the three
months-old regional peace plan a chance after
an initial period of skepticism.
The pact calls for democratic reforms, a
general amnesty and an end to support for
guerrilla wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras. Costa Rica, whose
President Oscar Arias drafted the plan, also
has signed the agreement.
Yesterday, Shultz repeated White House
complaints that the Ortega regime has failed
to grant a complete amnesty, restore full
freedoms or lift a state of emergency as re
quired by the peace agreement.
He added, however, that fulfilling those re
quirements "would probably convince" most
Sandinistas opponents, including contra
guerrillas, to come out of hiding and "join in
their country's democratic politics."
Shultz also gently praised Ortega's deci
sion last week to open indirect cease-fire
talks with the contras, saying U.S. officials
"welcome any move by the government of

Nicaragua, no matter how tentative, to end
the fighting and the grievances that have
caused it."
And he repeated President Reagan's
guarded offer, formally extended Monday, to
resume lapsed regional security talks with
Nicaragua if the Ortega government engages
in serious cease-fire talks with the contras.
Contra leader Calero, in remarks yesterday
at a conservative Washington think tank,
reiterated the rebels' eagerness to begin those
talks and indicated that the Sandinistas' ap
parent favored site, the Costa Rica capital of
San Jose, was acceptable.
He outlined what he said were minimum
conditions for cease-fire that would be ac
ceptable to contra negotiators. They include
an end to fighting with no change in the mili
tary position of either side, provisions for the
rebels to evacuate sick or wounded soldiers,
the ability to communicate and resupply
forces so that military lines may be kept in
tact, and the right to train and maintain forces
at fighting strength so that either side could
respond to a breach in the cease-fire by the
other.
Ortega is making his first visit to Washing
ton since September 1979, two months after
Sandinista guerrillas ousted dictator Anas
tasio Somoza and established what the
United States then believed would be a
democracy. The Nicaraguan Embassy said
he would visit a Washington church to ad
dress religious groups involved in Central
American issues and meet with reporters
before ending his Washington visit.
