# Interracial dating discussed
## 
### Frank Quaratiello 
When Edward and Lois An
derson wanted to marry each
other in 1%6, her home state of
Maryland wouldn't let them.
When Trudy Taliaferro told her
parents about her marriage,
they weren't very supportive.
And when Kathleen Namphy
once gave a speech at a ban
quet with her husband, the
crowd stared awkwardly at the
couple.
The Andersons, the Taliafer
ros and the Namphys are all in
terracial couples. Along with
Linda and John Owens and
Myrna Irigon and Charlie
Black, they spoke last night at
an Ujamaa House program
titled "Interracial Relation
ships? The Unanswered Qus
tions."
The program was designed to
examine interracial dating and
marriage in real terms, accord
ing to senior Sharon Metzger,
who organized the program
with junior Randy Johnson.
"Interracial relationships are
quite apparent on Stanford's
campus, but discussions tend
to be in hypothetical and
speculative terms," Metzger
said.
"Bringing interracially mar
ried guests from Stanford and
the surrounding community
into the dorms to relate their

experiences helped to address
students' questions about day
to-day living as an interracial
family," Metzger added.
The couples discussed the
many difficulties interracial
couples face. Trudy Taliaferro
said that although her parents
were not supportive at first, her
friends were. Her husband,
Larry, said their family has not
been divided by racial issues
and that their children, Michael
and Terry, have a good sense of
their own identity.

'I haven't seen a
relationship that
wasn't strained
by mixed races.'

Myrna Irigon, a residence of
fice coordinator at Governor's
Corner, added that it was im
portant to her that her son rec
ognize that he is biracial â€” in
this case, that he is both
Filipino and Caucasian.
Kathleen Namphy recounted
how she and her husband went
to an Explorer's Club meeting
in Portland, Ore., where she
was supposed to speak and the
banquet room full of white

people stared awkwardly at
them.
Public opinion toward the
issue of interracial marriage is
very different in the United
States than in other parts of the
world, she said.
Namphy, who is a lecturer in
English and humanities here,
has lived in Lebanon and Haiti
with her husband, Joseph. She
said they were treated better
overseas than in the United
States.
The Owens were the only
completely minority interracial
marriage at the program; Linda
is Mexican and John is black.
Such couples are rare, the
panel said.
Questions from the audience
sought to distinguish between
cultural differences and racial
differences in relationships.
Many said they believed cul
tural differences were more dif
ficult to deal with, but agreed
that any differences could be
overcome if a couple was will
ing to work at it.
"1 haven't seen a relation
ship that wasn't strained by
mixed races," said Sam Ed
wards, a psychological coun
selor at Counseling and Psy
chological Services.
A follow-up discussion on in
terracial dating at Stanford will
be held Friday at 8:30 p.m. in
the Ujamaa Large Lounge.
