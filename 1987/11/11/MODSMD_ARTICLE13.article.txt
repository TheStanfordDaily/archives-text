## Hit-and-run injures bicyclist 
### Chris Saigal Staff writer 
A hit-and-run driver seriously
injured a Stanford bicyclist early
Sunday near the Florence Moore
Hall parking lot.
Yesterday a 17-year-old high
school student from Saratoga
called Stanford Police and identi
fied herself as the driver of the
automobile involved in the inci
dent, according to Stanford
Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer.

The student's car struck John
Mock, a systems programmer in
the Music Department, while he
was turning onto Lomita Road
from the Knoll driveway at 12:40
a.m., Niemeyer said.
Mock suffered a broken hip
and is in stable condition at Stan
ford Hospital.
The young woman may have
been drinking at a nearby party,
Niemeyer speculated.
Sophomore David Keller said
the young woman's car, a red

Volkswagen, almost struck his
car as it sped away from the acci
dent. After realizing that there
had been an accident, Keller
called the police.
"I don't understand how
someone could do that much
damage to a human body and still
drive away," Keller said.
The California Highway Pa
trol, which has jurisdiction over
on-campus injury accidents,
made arrangements to bring the
suspect into custody, police said.
