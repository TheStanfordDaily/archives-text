## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Paradise needs paving 
### 
"They paved paradise, put up a parking lot,"
a nostalgic Joni Mitchell lamented in one of her
memorable portraits of American culture in the
1960s and '70s. Yet paving is exactly what Stan
ford must do to its paradise of open space if the
remarkable traffic of cars now on campus is to
be handled properly.
The problem of overcrowded parking lots is
steadily intensifying, despite the recent addition
of new parking facilities. Unfortunately,
however, these new facilities have not been di
rected at students, and this has been a glaring
omission.
Spaces are scarce or nonexistent from the
Row to Sterling Quad, from Stern to Lagunita.
Residents of Roble last week protested to the
Stanford Police Department about the limited
space. Some of the crowding at Roble and Ster
ling Quad can be explained by the fact that con
struction work is going on there, but this neither
explains nor excuses the serious deficiency of
student parking on campus.

The University could begin to confront the sit
uation by transferring the "A" and "C"
designations in dorm lots to "dorm-only." In
Roble's case, retarring and lining the Boathouse
gravel pad and designating it for the dorm would
make a significant difference.
Students who live off campus find parking for
class a hopeless and frustrating experience. Be
cause there is no central lot for these com
muters, they are often forced to circle endlessly
looking for a space. Creating a single lot for them
should be a priority.
With more student housing under construc
tion, and the seemingly endless construction of
new academic buildings still in high gear, the
hassles of parking on campus are certainly not
going to go away. Action is needed — now.
We will still sigh to Joni Mitchell's soft nostal
gia, but chances are she never tried to park at
Stanford. And after all, as Proust has told us, the
only true paradises are the paradises we have
lost.
