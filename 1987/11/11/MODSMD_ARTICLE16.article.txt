# Harnessing the energies of love with Christ

"There is in all of us the positive and
negative, and I think what makes us holy
is not that we try to get rid of all the bad
and bolster all the good. What makes us
holy is that we reach a balance in our lives
in which we are integrated in wholeness
and holiness."

These words were spoken by a Chris
tian, but I don't want to say who it was or
why he said it just now. There has been a
surprising amount of discussion and con
flict so far this quarter about Christianity
on this page. We have seen arguments for
and against Bible study in the dorms, and
then there was Roy Campbell's calumny
against all things outside the scope of his
view of Christianity. One way or the
other, it appears that Christianity matters
a lot to at least some people on this
campus. I know it matters to me.
Oh, I'm not much of a Christian now, at
least not in a conventional sense. I was
born and raised a Presbyterian, and there
was a time 1 went to church every week
and scoffed at the "two-timing" Chris
tians who would only show up at
Christmas and Easter. I can't scoff much
now since that's pretty much exactly what
I've become.
Nevertheless, the parts of Christianity
that seem important to me have little to do
with going to church, the exhortations of
right-wing Bible-thumpers or, indeed,
about being a Christian in any formal, reli
gious sense at all. The important parts of
Christianity are fundamentally human and

secular to me. Christianity for me is about
the wonderment of living and the affirma
tion of human worth.
When I was a junior in college, life fi
nally caught up with this nerd, and I fell
crashingly in love with a woman. Wonder
ful? Yeah, right. Not knowing any better,
I had fallen for someone who lived on the
same floor as I in the dorm. I told her how
1 felt, and she rejected me. It was bad, first
love and all that, having to see her in the
bathroom every morning and knowing we
just couldn't connect. That was bad. but
the worst was when she started going out
with one of the other guys on the floor. It
was like 1 was at the bottom of this great
big pit. Yeah, I think I know what despair
is, and if it can be worse than that I am
sure that 1 don't want to find out.
That was the end of winter quarter that
year. The guy she was dating transferred
to another college and didn't want to con
tinue the relationship, and so when 1 came
back from break at least I didn't have to
deal with the two of them. 1 was still pretty
low, and returning from a jazz gig one
night early that quarter I came across this
group of street musicians. 1 stopped to lis
ten, having heard them before, and when
they finished their song the leader asked if
112 cared to play. Now, you have to under
stand that they were a folk group: guitar,
mandolin, protest songs — the whole bit
— and 1 play trombone, and so it was
pretty strange to be jamming with them at
midnight in the middle of campus. When
we stopped that night they asked me to
join their group.
Healing, the first foothold out of the pit,
really didn't begin for me until that night.
What unexpected wonderment and joy it
was to be so suddenly and completely ac
cepted by that group and to discover that 1
had something valuable to contribute. It
was nothing less than a miracle for me.
You don't have to believe in the literal res
urrection of Christ to see the parallel here.

The promise of the Cross is that all such
despair can be conquered. There is hope.
And whether or not you label that hope
"Christ," the regenerative joy of over
coming our darknesses is an inextricable
part of what it means to be alive.
A direct consequence of hope is the idea
that all of us can be the instrument of hope
in other people's lives, just as the street
musicians were instrumental (if you'll
excuse the pun) in bringing hope into my
life. But, ultimately, we cannot help those
whom we condemn. This fact is what
bothers me the most about a lot of the so
called Christian rhetoric I hear about in
the news. Many people don't seem to be
able to acknowledge that the essence of
what we have to offer to each other as
human beings is our acceptance and our
respect for each other's worth — which
brings me back to the quote with which I
began this column.
Read it again. Here is an acknowledge
ment that we are imperfect, that the way
to holiness is not based upon the denial of
such imperfection, but rather through
complete self-acceptance. These words
were spoken by Father Bob Arpin, a
Roman Catholic priest. A Roman Catholic
priest and a man with AIDS.
How do we reconcile these two facts?
These three facts, really, since Father Ar
pin acknowledges that he is gay but
refuses to say how he got the disease. It is
very easy to condemn homosexuals, if you
can convince yourself that they are god
less and unconcerned about leading a
Christian life. But here is a man who has
dedicated his life to Christian ideals, who,
in fact, at least claims to have been or
dained before he realized that he was gay.
I see Father Arpin as a call to under
standing and compassion. It is never suffi
cient to my mind to indict any group of
people simply because what they do goes
against your morality. To do so blinds you
to the individual, human stories that are

happening beyond the blinders of that
morality.
If we are human, we must care about
Father Arpin and, indeed, all victims of
the AIDS virus because they are human
and they are dying. If we are Christian, we
must care about Father Arpin and, indeed,
all homosexual Christians because, they
are our brothers in Christ, and they are
living. We must affirm their worth, the
reconciliation of their lifestyle and their
faith, because to fail to do so is to deny our
own imperfections and, therefore, our
own self-worth.
Yes, I have heard the biblical arguments
against homosexuality, abortions, evolu
tion, birth control, premarital sex and so
on. But the real point of Christian living
or, more generally, spiritual living of any
kind, is what you are capable of doing
when confronted with another's pain. The
only answer is to care as much as you can
and to accept the whole person, the yin
and the yang of them, if you will. This is
the Tao of Christ: that we are imperfect,
but that through the acceptance and af
firmation of each other we can be made
whole and integrated into the celebration
of life.
Having begun this column with a quote
from a Catholic priest, it is fitting to end
with another. Teilhard de Chardin was a
geologist and Jesuit who endeavored
through his writings to reconcile the
seemingly disparate ideas of evolution and
Christianity. Teilhard had this to say
about the idea of progress: "The day will
come when, after harnessing the ether, the
winds, the tides, gravitation, we shall har
ness for God the energies of love. And. on
that day, for the second time in the history
of the world, man will have discovered
fire."
The Tao of Christ is love.

just couldn't connect. That was bad. but
the worst was when she started going out
with one of the other guys on the floor. It
was like 1 was at the bottom of this great
big pit. Yeah, I think I know what despair
is, and if it can be worse than that I am
sure that 1 don't want to find out.
That was the end of winter quarter that
year. The guy she was dating transferred
to another college and didn't want to con
tinue the relationship, and so when 1 came
back from break at least I didn't have to
deal with the two of them. 1 was still pretty
low, and returning from a jazz gig one
night early that quarter I came across this
group of street musicians. 1 stopped to lis
ten, having heard them before, and when
they finished their song the leader asked if
112 cared to play. Now, you have to under
stand that they were a folk group: guitar,
mandolin, protest songs — the whole bit
— and 1 play trombone, and so it was
pretty strange to be jamming with them at
midnight in the middle of campus. When
we stopped that night they asked me to
join their group.
Healing, the first foothold out of the pit,
really didn't begin for me until that night.
What unexpected wonderment and joy it
was to be so suddenly and completely ac
cepted by that group and to discover that 1
had something valuable to contribute. It
was nothing less than a miracle for me.
You don't have to believe in the literal res
urrection of Christ to see the parallel here.

The promise of the Cross is that all such
despair can be conquered. There is hope.
And whether or not you label that hope
"Christ," the regenerative joy of over
coming our darknesses is an inextricable
part of what it means to be alive.
A direct consequence of hope is the idea
that all of us can be the instrument of hope
in other people's lives, just as the street
musicians were instrumental (if you'll
excuse the pun) in bringing hope into my
life. But, ultimately, we cannot help those
whom we condemn. This fact is what
bothers me the most about a lot of the so
called Christian rhetoric I hear about in
the news. Many people don't seem to be
able to acknowledge that the essence of
what we have to offer to each other as
human beings is our acceptance and our
respect for each other's worth — which
brings me back to the quote with which I
began this column.
Read it again. Here is an acknowledge
ment that we are imperfect, that the way
to holiness is not based upon the denial of
such imperfection, but rather through
complete self-acceptance. These words
were spoken by Father Bob Arpin, a
Roman Catholic priest. A Roman Catholic
priest and a man with AIDS.
How do we reconcile these two facts?
These three facts, really, since Father Ar
pin acknowledges that he is gay but
refuses to say how he got the disease. It is
very easy to condemn homosexuals, if you
can convince yourself that they are god
less and unconcerned about leading a
Christian life. But here is a man who has
dedicated his life to Christian ideals, who,
in fact, at least claims to have been or
dained before he realized that he was gay.
I see Father Arpin as a call to under
standing and compassion. It is never suffi
cient to my mind to indict any group of
people simply because what they do goes
against your morality. To do so blinds you
to the individual, human stories that are

happening beyond the blinders of that
morality.
If we are human, we must care about
Father Arpin and, indeed, all victims of
the AIDS virus because they are human
and they are dying. If we are Christian, we
must care about Father Arpin and, indeed,
all homosexual Christians because, they
are our brothers in Christ, and they are
living. We must affirm their worth, the
reconciliation of their lifestyle and their
faith, because to fail to do so is to deny our
own imperfections and, therefore, our
own self-worth.
Yes, I have heard the biblical arguments
against homosexuality, abortions, evolu
tion, birth control, premarital sex and so
on. But the real point of Christian living
or, more generally, spiritual living of any
kind, is what you are capable of doing
when confronted with another's pain. The
only answer is to care as much as you can
and to accept the whole person, the yin
and the yang of them, if you will. This is
the Tao of Christ: that we are imperfect,
but that through the acceptance and af
firmation of each other we can be made
whole and integrated into the celebration
of life.
Having begun this column with a quote
from a Catholic priest, it is fitting to end
with another. Teilhard de Chardin was a
geologist and Jesuit who endeavored
through his writings to reconcile the
seemingly disparate ideas of evolution and
Christianity. Teilhard had this to say
about the idea of progress: "The day will
come when, after harnessing the ether, the
winds, the tides, gravitation, we shall har
ness for God the energies of love. And. on
that day, for the second time in the history
of the world, man will have discovered
fire."
The Tao of Christ is love.

"There is in all of us the positive and
negative, and I think what makes us holy
is not that we try to get rid of all the bad
and bolster all the good. What makes us
holy is that we reach a balance in our lives
in which we are integrated in wholeness
and holiness."

These words were spoken by a Chris
tian, but I don't want to say who it was or
why he said it just now. There has been a
surprising amount of discussion and con
flict so far this quarter about Christianity
on this page. We have seen arguments for
and against Bible study in the dorms, and
then there was Roy Campbell's calumny
against all things outside the scope of his
view of Christianity. One way or the
other, it appears that Christianity matters
a lot to at least some people on this
campus. I know it matters to me.
Oh, I'm not much of a Christian now, at
least not in a conventional sense. I was
born and raised a Presbyterian, and there
was a time 1 went to church every week
and scoffed at the "two-timing" Chris
tians who would only show up at
Christmas and Easter. I can't scoff much
now since that's pretty much exactly what
I've become.
Nevertheless, the parts of Christianity
that seem important to me have little to do
with going to church, the exhortations of
right-wing Bible-thumpers or, indeed,
about being a Christian in any formal, reli
gious sense at all. The important parts of
Christianity are fundamentally human and

secular to me. Christianity for me is about
the wonderment of living and the affirma
tion of human worth.
When I was a junior in college, life fi
nally caught up with this nerd, and I fell
crashingly in love with a woman. Wonder
ful? Yeah, right. Not knowing any better,
I had fallen for someone who lived on the
same floor as I in the dorm. I told her how
1 felt, and she rejected me. It was bad, first
love and all that, having to see her in the

whom we condemn. This fact is what
bothers me the most about a lot of the so
called Christian rhetoric I hear about in
the news. Many people don't seem to be
able to acknowledge that the essence of
what we have to offer to each other as
human beings is our acceptance and our
respect for each other's worth — which
brings me back to the quote with which I
began this column.
Read it again. Here is an acknowledge
ment that we are imperfect, that the way
to holiness is not based upon the denial of
such imperfection, but rather through
complete self-acceptance. These words
were spoken by Father Bob Arpin, a
Roman Catholic priest. A Roman Catholic
priest and a man with AIDS.
How do we reconcile these two facts?
These three facts, really, since Father Ar
pin acknowledges that he is gay but
refuses to say how he got the disease. It is
very easy to condemn homosexuals, if you
can convince yourself that they are god
less and unconcerned about leading a
Christian life. But here is a man who has
dedicated his life to Christian ideals, who,
in fact, at least claims to have been or
dained before he realized that he was gay.
I see Father Arpin as a call to under
standing and compassion. It is never suffi
cient to my mind to indict any group of
people simply because what they do goes
against your morality. To do so blinds you
to the individual, human stories that are

happening beyond the blinders of that
morality.
If we are human, we must care about
Father Arpin and, indeed, all victims of
the AIDS virus because they are human
and they are dying. If we are Christian, we
must care about Father Arpin and, indeed,
all homosexual Christians because, they
are our brothers in Christ, and they are
living. We must affirm their worth, the
reconciliation of their lifestyle and their
faith, because to fail to do so is to deny our
own imperfections and, therefore, our
own self-worth.
Yes, I have heard the biblical arguments
against homosexuality, abortions, evolu
tion, birth control, premarital sex and so
on. But the real point of Christian living
or, more generally, spiritual living of any
kind, is what you are capable of doing
when confronted with another's pain. The
only answer is to care as much as you can
and to accept the whole person, the yin
and the yang of them, if you will. This is
the Tao of Christ: that we are imperfect,
but that through the acceptance and af
firmation of each other we can be made
whole and integrated into the celebration
of life.
Having begun this column with a quote
from a Catholic priest, it is fitting to end
with another. Teilhard de Chardin was a
geologist and Jesuit who endeavored
through his writings to reconcile the
seemingly disparate ideas of evolution and
Christianity. Teilhard had this to say
about the idea of progress: "The day will
come when, after harnessing the ether, the
winds, the tides, gravitation, we shall har
ness for God the energies of love. And. on
that day, for the second time in the history
of the world, man will have discovered
fire."
The Tao of Christ is love.
