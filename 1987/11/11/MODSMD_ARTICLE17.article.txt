## Task Force ignoring humanities 
### 
As part of the discussion of the Area One
requirement, let me offer the substance of a
letter I recently sent to the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies.
I have profound objections to the revised
recommendations of the Western Culture
Task Force, and they have nothing to do with
the need to ensure that the teaching of the
texts of Western Culture engage and explore
issues of race, class and gender. The English
Department track "Literature and the Arts"
has done so, and in the past year it has done
so more deliberately and self-consciously
through a revised reading list and through
lectures and sections.

Albert Gelpi

My colleagues who teach the course tell me
that the new guidelines, if passed, ought not
to affect significantly what we are doing and
what we will learn to do better in the course.
So I am not speaking out of a back-to-the
wall territorial defensiveness.
Indeed, the question of engaging more con
scientiously issues of cultural diversity was
muffed and bluffed by the task force in not
proposing a more effective requirement in
non-Western and/or minority culture for all
undergraduates. This would not have dis
placed the obligation in the Western culture
courses to engage issues of race, class and
gender but would have complemented those
efforts.
The principal reason I have heard for not
considering such a move is that some lock
step majors have no room for another re
quirement outside the major. I have no way
of knowing whether this explanation is accu
rate, but if it is, then it is clear that certain
sectors of the University are calling the shots

for all of us by limiting the parameters for
resolving issues fundamental to the whole of
undergraduate education.
My objections to the recommendations of
the task force are methodological and disci
plinary. To begin with, abandoning of the an
cient world destroys the historical integrity of
the course. For better or worse — for better
as well as worse — who we are and what we
are in the West began there, and we had bet
ter know it and understand it. Secondly, the
weakening of the textual basis of the course
subverts its literary integrity. The new name,
"Culture, Ideas and Values," specifies its so
cial science basis, which is what the obfuscat
ing term "interdisciplinary" has turned out to
mean.
What's more, that bias characterized the
task force from its inception, there not being
a single faculty member from literature or the
arts on that committee.
It is in texts that the ideas and values of a
culture are expressed with the greatest psy
chological, philosophical and moral force,
and with the greatest complexity, density and
particularity.
Consequently, the study of primary texts
allows an examination of issues more flexible
and integrative, freer from single ideological
bias than any secondary commentary, neces
sarily restricted as that is to the ideological
bias of the commentator. It is true that there
can be no informed response to a text which
does not view it from the inside before
viewing it from the outside, but the salutary
effect is that such an examination from a
combination of perspectives requires the
reader to comprehend the issues not only in
terms of that text's limitations but also —just
as important — in terms of its abiding
relevance.
This is what the humanities are all about.
The ideological approach of "culture

studies" in the current social sciences jargon,
involves, by the nature of its disiplinary
methodology, a narrowing of perspective, a
reduction of possibilities, an intellectual
oversimplification. The statistics of the stu
dent evaluations of the present tracks show
unmistakably that the most successful tracks
in Western Culture are the humanistically ori
ented tracks — not only because of the excel
lent teachers committed to those tracks
(other tracks have excellent teachers as well)
but because of the broad, integrative orienta
tion 1 have alluded to.
The humanities, so often themselves a
minority view at Stanford, have achieved
something marvelously successful and effec
tive in undergraduate education here. But the
recommendations of the Task Force recon
ceive the Area One Requirement in ways that
ignore that achievement and commend the
disciplinary and curricular direction of the
less effective tracks — necessarily at the ex
pense of the more effective tracks. It is not
just that the report does not acknowledge or
mention literature and the arts; it does so for
positive, not negative reasons. Nor can it be
remedied by stitching in tardy acknowledge
ments. There is no mention of literature and
the arts because the report does not respect
or understand literature and the arts, because
its intentions and purposes lie elsewhere.
The Committee on Undergraduate Studies
should return the report and request a new
and balanced committee to address the prob
lem. My sense is that our course, "Literature
and the Arts," and other historically and tex
tually based tracks like "Great Works" and
Structured Liberal Education (SLE) can
survive the adoption of this report, but that
because of the students' response, as well as
the faculty's, the Area One requirement may
not long survive its adoption.

and integrative, freer from single ideological
bias than any secondary commentary, neces
sarily restricted as that is to the ideological
bias of the commentator. It is true that there
can be no informed response to a text which
does not view it from the inside before
viewing it from the outside, but the salutary
effect is that such an examination from a
combination of perspectives requires the
reader to comprehend the issues not only in
terms of that text's limitations but also —just
as important — in terms of its abiding
relevance.
This is what the humanities are all about.
The ideological approach of "culture

studies" in the current social sciences jargon,
involves, by the nature of its disiplinary
methodology, a narrowing of perspective, a
reduction of possibilities, an intellectual
oversimplification. The statistics of the stu
dent evaluations of the present tracks show
unmistakably that the most successful tracks
in Western Culture are the humanistically ori
ented tracks — not only because of the excel
lent teachers committed to those tracks
(other tracks have excellent teachers as well)
but because of the broad, integrative orienta
tion 1 have alluded to.
The humanities, so often themselves a
minority view at Stanford, have achieved
something marvelously successful and effec
tive in undergraduate education here. But the
recommendations of the Task Force recon
ceive the Area One Requirement in ways that
ignore that achievement and commend the
disciplinary and curricular direction of the
less effective tracks — necessarily at the ex
pense of the more effective tracks. It is not
just that the report does not acknowledge or
mention literature and the arts; it does so for
positive, not negative reasons. Nor can it be
remedied by stitching in tardy acknowledge
ments. There is no mention of literature and
the arts because the report does not respect
or understand literature and the arts, because
its intentions and purposes lie elsewhere.
The Committee on Undergraduate Studies
should return the report and request a new
and balanced committee to address the prob
lem. My sense is that our course, "Literature
and the Arts," and other historically and tex
tually based tracks like "Great Works" and
Structured Liberal Education (SLE) can
survive the adoption of this report, but that
because of the students' response, as well as
the faculty's, the Area One requirement may
not long survive its adoption.

As part of the discussion of the Area One
requirement, let me offer the substance of a
letter I recently sent to the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies.
I have profound objections to the revised
recommendations of the Western Culture
Task Force, and they have nothing to do with
the need to ensure that the teaching of the
texts of Western Culture engage and explore
issues of race, class and gender. The English
Department track "Literature and the Arts"
has done so, and in the past year it has done
so more deliberately and self-consciously
through a revised reading list and through
lectures and sections.

My colleagues who teach the course tell me
that the new guidelines, if passed, ought not
to affect significantly what we are doing and
what we will learn to do better in the course.
So I am not speaking out of a back-to-the
wall territorial defensiveness.
Indeed, the question of engaging more con
scientiously issues of cultural diversity was
muffed and bluffed by the task force in not
proposing a more effective requirement in
non-Western and/or minority culture for all
undergraduates. This would not have dis
placed the obligation in the Western culture
courses to engage issues of race, class and
gender but would have complemented those
efforts.
The principal reason I have heard for not
considering such a move is that some lock
step majors have no room for another re
quirement outside the major. I have no way
of knowing whether this explanation is accu
rate, but if it is, then it is clear that certain
sectors of the University are calling the shots

for all of us by limiting the parameters for
resolving issues fundamental to the whole of
undergraduate education.
My objections to the recommendations of
the task force are methodological and disci
plinary. To begin with, abandoning of the an
cient world destroys the historical integrity of
the course. For better or worse — for better
as well as worse — who we are and what we
are in the West began there, and we had bet
ter know it and understand it. Secondly, the
weakening of the textual basis of the course
subverts its literary integrity. The new name,
"Culture, Ideas and Values," specifies its so
cial science basis, which is what the obfuscat
ing term "interdisciplinary" has turned out to
mean.
What's more, that bias characterized the
task force from its inception, there not being
a single faculty member from literature or the
arts on that committee.
It is in texts that the ideas and values of a
culture are expressed with the greatest psy
chological, philosophical and moral force,
and with the greatest complexity, density and
particularity.
