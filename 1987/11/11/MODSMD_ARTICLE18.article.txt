Gumby-thieving
shatters trust
Last Saturday night I was the
victim of a heinous and vicious
crime, one that shattered my
confidence in the integrity and
honesty of our student body.
Three other friends and 1 were
in my room at 558 Mayfield
watching movies. We were basi
cally in a silly mood, and well,
one thing led to another, and
soon things started flying out of
the window.
While my friend and I were
fighting over rights to his left
shoe, my other friend, who was
still looking out of the window
yelled. "Hey. somebody just
stole something!" We ran
downstairs but there was no one
in sight. We scouted the Row for
a half hour to no avail. They wete
gone. Stolen: a three-foot felt
Gum by wealing a pink lei. and an
Avanti German Shepard puppy
named Loki.
Yes, this is quite a funny story,
and no, 1 don't expect to garner
much sympathy. I can honestly
say that 1 haven't had much trou
ble picking up the pieces and
continuing with life. But,
seriously, it still bothers me.
Granted, throwing stuffed
animals out of a second floor
window isn't an advisable
practice at any time, but you
should be able to expect some se
curity on campus. You just don't
expect fellow Stanford students
to jump on the slightest opportu
nity to steal something right from
under your nose (literally). Crime
is bad enough as it is, and if you
can't even trust other students,
who can you trust?
One last word to the per
petrators. We know you're out
there somewhere, and I just hope
you're having a wonderful time
with your new "friends."
