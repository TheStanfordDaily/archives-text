# Alum to receive nomination
## Reagan will nominate Kennedy for Supreme Court today 
### Lori Silver Editorial staff With wire reports 
Stanford alumnus Anthony Kennedy
is President Reagan's nominee for the
U.S. Supreme Court, according to
White House officials.
Reagan is expected to announce his
decision today.
Kennedy graduated from Stanford in
1958 with a bachelor's degree in politi
cal science. He has two children cur
rently enrolled here — Kristen, a soph
omore, and Greg, a senior. His oldest
son, Justin, graduated from Stanford in
1986.
The officials said Reagan decided to
appoint Kennedy, 51, a federal appeals
court judge from Sacramento who is
considered a moderate conservative,
after a half-hour meeting with him at
the White House Monday. The meeting
was also attended by White House
Chief of Staff Howard Baker Jr. and

Attorney General Edwin Meese 111, the
officials said.
Tb? announcement will be made
today if FBI checks are completed, a
White House official said. If not, the
official said, the announcement will be
made Thursday.
Political Science Prof. Robert Horn,
who taught Kennedy as an undergradu
ate at Stanford, described Kennedy as
a very good friend whom he greatly
admires.
"My guess is that the confirmation
process is not likely to be too diffi
cult," Horn said.
"Judge Kennedy is considered a less
controversial figure — certainly less
than Judge Bork," he said.
Kristen and Greg Kennedy were un
available for comment yesterday.
Although Kennedy is not as conser
vative as some Republican senators
would like, they will probably support
his nomination, Horn said.
"Where else can they (the conserva
tive senators) go?" Horn asked. "If

Kennedy is not confirmed, the
Republicans realize that the Demo
cratic majority will refuse to give the
president another chance."
If Kennedy is not confirmed, the
Democrats will try to delay appoint
ment of a new justice until after the
presidential election in 1988, Horn
said.
Jack Friedenthal, associate dean of
the Law School and a former colleague
of Kennedy, said Kennedy would
probably be confirmed.
Reagan is expected to press for quick
confirmation to fill a crucial swing seat
on the high court that has been vacant
since June 26 and to overcome the em
barrassment of two failed nominations
— those of Robert Bork and Douglas
Ginsburg.
But Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Joseph Biden Jr.(D-Del) said
yesterday that hearings are "probably
not likely" before January.
Officials said the administra
tion will try to seek bipartisan
support for Kennedy and will
mute the harsh political rhetoric
that characterized the debate on
both sides over the nomination of
Judge Robert Bork.
Horn said he would advise
Kennedy "to comport himself
just in the way he always has."
"Kennedy is a natural,
friendly person," Horn said.
Horn said that when Ken
nedy's nomination goes before
the Senate he hopes Kennedy
will decline to say how he will

rule on certain issues. According
to Horn, it would be inappropri
ate for Kennedy to give an
opinion on an issue he may have
to decide as a judge.
In the aftermath of Judge
Douglas Ginsburg's withdrawal
Saturday as a nominee for the
court, new battles have erupted
in Republican ranks over who
was to blame for the debacle.
Democrats and moderate
Republicans blamed Meese, who
pushed for Ginsburg. Baker was
attacked by conservatives for
abandoning Ginsburg after it was
disclosed that Ginsburg had
smoked marijuana as a Harvard
law professor, and by some
others for not being forceful
enough in opposing him in the

first place.
On Monday, conservative Sen.
Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) assailed
"gutless wonders" on the White
House staff but did not specify
whom he had in mind. Yester
day, Baker's defenders fought
back, led by moderate Sen.
William Cohen (R-Maine) who
said, "These attacks only con
firm the fact that you can get
mugged more easily on the back
stairs of the White House than
you can on the streets of any ur
ban ghetto."
The administration maneu
vered cautiously in advance of
the announcement; White House
Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said Kennedy was being sub
jected to a "very thorough kind

of background analysis" to de
termine if anything could cause
embarrassment if he is
nominated. But Reagan inadver
tently confirmed that he had
made a decision when at a morn
ing picture-taking session he told
reporters there would be a
"better opportunity" to discuss
it "later in the day."
A White House official said
that the White House staff had
not discussed the timing of the
announcement with the presi
dent.
The White House postponed a
scheduled meeting between Ken
nedy and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-
N.C.), who had objected to the
forthcoming nomination.

to decide as a judge.
In the aftermath of Judge
Douglas Ginsburg's withdrawal
Saturday as a nominee for the
court, new battles have erupted
in Republican ranks over who
was to blame for the debacle.
Democrats and moderate
Republicans blamed Meese, who
pushed for Ginsburg. Baker was
attacked by conservatives for
abandoning Ginsburg after it was
disclosed that Ginsburg had
smoked marijuana as a Harvard
law professor, and by some
others for not being forceful
enough in opposing him in the

first place.
On Monday, conservative Sen.
Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) assailed
"gutless wonders" on the White
House staff but did not specify
whom he had in mind. Yester
day, Baker's defenders fought
back, led by moderate Sen.
William Cohen (R-Maine) who
said, "These attacks only con
firm the fact that you can get
mugged more easily on the back
stairs of the White House than
you can on the streets of any ur
ban ghetto."
The administration maneu
vered cautiously in advance of
the announcement; White House
Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said Kennedy was being sub
jected to a "very thorough kind

of background analysis" to de
termine if anything could cause
embarrassment if he is
nominated. But Reagan inadver
tently confirmed that he had
made a decision when at a morn
ing picture-taking session he told
reporters there would be a
"better opportunity" to discuss
it "later in the day."
A White House official said
that the White House staff had
not discussed the timing of the
announcement with the presi
dent.
The White House postponed a
scheduled meeting between Ken
nedy and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-
N.C.), who had objected to the
forthcoming nomination.
Stanford alumnus Anthony Kennedy
is President Reagan's nominee for the
U.S. Supreme Court, according to
White House officials.
Reagan is expected to announce his
decision today.
Kennedy graduated from Stanford in
1958 with a bachelor's degree in politi
cal science. He has two children cur
rently enrolled here — Kristen, a soph
omore, and Greg, a senior. His oldest
son, Justin, graduated from Stanford in
1986.
The officials said Reagan decided to
appoint Kennedy, 51, a federal appeals
court judge from Sacramento who is
considered a moderate conservative,
after a half-hour meeting with him at
the White House Monday. The meeting
was also attended by White House
Chief of Staff Howard Baker Jr. and

Attorney General Edwin Meese 111, the
officials said.
Tb? announcement will be made
today if FBI checks are completed, a
White House official said. If not, the
official said, the announcement will be
made Thursday.
Political Science Prof. Robert Horn,
who taught Kennedy as an undergradu
ate at Stanford, described Kennedy as
a very good friend whom he greatly
admires.
"My guess is that the confirmation
process is not likely to be too diffi
cult," Horn said.
"Judge Kennedy is considered a less
controversial figure — certainly less
than Judge Bork," he said.
Kristen and Greg Kennedy were un
available for comment yesterday.
Although Kennedy is not as conser
vative as some Republican senators
would like, they will probably support
his nomination, Horn said.
"Where else can they (the conserva
tive senators) go?" Horn asked. "If

Kennedy is not confirmed, the
Republicans realize that the Demo
cratic majority will refuse to give the
president another chance."
If Kennedy is not confirmed, the
Democrats will try to delay appoint
ment of a new justice until after the
presidential election in 1988, Horn
said.
Jack Friedenthal, associate dean of
the Law School and a former colleague
of Kennedy, said Kennedy would
probably be confirmed.
Reagan is expected to press for quick
confirmation to fill a crucial swing seat
on the high court that has been vacant
since June 26 and to overcome the em
barrassment of two failed nominations
— those of Robert Bork and Douglas
Ginsburg.
But Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Joseph Biden Jr.(D-Del) said
yesterday that hearings are "probably
not likely" before January.
Officials said the administra
tion will try to seek bipartisan
support for Kennedy and will
mute the harsh political rhetoric
that characterized the debate on
both sides over the nomination of
Judge Robert Bork.
Horn said he would advise
Kennedy "to comport himself
just in the way he always has."
"Kennedy is a natural,
friendly person," Horn said.
Horn said that when Ken
nedy's nomination goes before
the Senate he hopes Kennedy
will decline to say how he will

rule on certain issues. According
to Horn, it would be inappropri
ate for Kennedy to give an
opinion on an issue he may have
to decide as a judge.
