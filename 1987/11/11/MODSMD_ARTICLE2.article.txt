# Alum to receive nomination
## Reagan will nominate Kennedy for Supreme Court today 
### Lori Silver Editorial staff With wire reports 
Stanford alumnus Anthony Kennedy
is President Reagan's nominee for the
U.S. Supreme Court, according to
White House officials.
Reagan is expected to announce his
decision today.
Kennedy graduated from Stanford in
1958 with a bachelor's degree in politi
cal science. He has two children cur
rently enrolled here — Kristen, a soph
omore, and Greg, a senior. His oldest
son, Justin, graduated from Stanford in
1986.
The officials said Reagan decided to
appoint Kennedy, 51, a federal appeals
court judge from Sacramento who is
considered a moderate conservative,
after a half-hour meeting with him at
the White House Monday. The meeting
was also attended by White House
Chief of Staff Howard Baker Jr. and

Attorney General Edwin Meese 111, the
officials said.
Tb? announcement will be made
today if FBI checks are completed, a
White House official said. If not, the
official said, the announcement will be
made Thursday.
Political Science Prof. Robert Horn,
who taught Kennedy as an undergradu
ate at Stanford, described Kennedy as
a very good friend whom he greatly
admires.
"My guess is that the confirmation
process is not likely to be too diffi
cult," Horn said.
"Judge Kennedy is considered a less
controversial figure — certainly less
than Judge Bork," he said.
Kristen and Greg Kennedy were un
available for comment yesterday.
Although Kennedy is not as conser
vative as some Republican senators
would like, they will probably support
his nomination, Horn said.
"Where else can they (the conserva
tive senators) go?" Horn asked. "If

Kennedy is not confirmed, the
Republicans realize that the Demo
cratic majority will refuse to give the
president another chance."
If Kennedy is not confirmed, the
Democrats will try to delay appoint
ment of a new justice until after the
presidential election in 1988, Horn
said.
Jack Friedenthal, associate dean of
the Law School and a former colleague
of Kennedy, said Kennedy would
probably be confirmed.
Reagan is expected to press for quick
confirmation to fill a crucial swing seat
on the high court that has been vacant
since June 26 and to overcome the em
barrassment of two failed nominations
— those of Robert Bork and Douglas
Ginsburg.
But Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Joseph Biden Jr.(D-Del) said
yesterday that hearings are "probably
not likely" before January.
