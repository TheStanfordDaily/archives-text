## Isser's production has 'Heart' 
### Jacqueline Yau 
"The Normal Heart" is a pow
erful drama set during the time
(from 1981 to 1984) that marked
the beginning of the AIDS
epidemic. It tells the story of one
man's struggle to overcome polit
ical and social prejudices in order
to educate and alert both the gay
and straight communities about
the catastrophic consequences of
the virus. On a deeper level, it is
also a love story carrying the
message that love is the same in
all relationships.
First presented at the Public
Theater in New York City in
April 1985, "The Normal Heart"
was the first play to deal directly
with AIDS from the perspective
of the social and personal impli
cations brought about by the
virus.
Ed Isser, the director of the
Drama Department's production
of the play, first became inter
ested in the AIDS crisis in 1982
when his wife encountered the
new disease while completing her
medical training in New York
Citv.
At the time, Isser was working
as a stage manager and actor.
When the couple moved to Stan
ford two years later, Isser, in his
pursuit of a joint doctorate in
humanities and drama, decided
to make "The Normal Heart" his
thesis directing project.
Isser says that this play is a
way to "sensitize the Stanford
community into realizing that the
AIDS issue is now everybody's
problem and to show the suffer
ing that accompanies the prob
lem in the gay community."

Isser and set decorator John
Wilson have placed the AIDS
crisis into its historical context
through an audio-visual frame
work — using news clips to high
light the major stories of the pe
riod (the royal wedding of
Charles and Diana, the Tylenol
scare and Michael Jackson's
"Thriller").
The walls of the theater are
covered with the names of AIDS

victims, as well as the anti-AIDS
slogans of gay-haters. It's an in
teresting effect that is heightened
by the sterile environment of the
stage, which is achieved by using
only a few props for multiple
purposes. All of Wilson s sparse
and gray sets effectively clash
with the backdrop of an enor
mous replica of an AIDS virus at
tacking a normal, healthy red
blood cell.

"The Normal Heart" cast is
led by Drew Barr in a stirring
performance as Ned Weeks.
Gina Schmeling is equally good
in her role as the frustrated,
tough and sensitive Dr. Emma
Brookner. One of the most
moving performances in the play
comes from Glen Coffman as
Mickey Marcus, who goes
through a nervous breakdown
caused by the emotional strain of
not knowing how the virus is
contracted, by having to give up
the gay freedoms he has been
fighting for and by having to
watch his friends die one by one
as he helplessly stands by.
The entire cast does a good
job. The only scene that doesn't
quite ring true is Ned's con
frontation with his brother,
which seems to lack the sincerity
and intensity of the other scenes.
According to Drew Barr, who
plays Ned Weeks, "Our main
goal was to alert the Stanford
community about the issues sur
rounding the AIDS virus and to
show that homosexual love is a
normal love that exists in normal
relationships"
Hopefully, "The Normal
Heart" will generate the discus
sions and heightened awareness
that the cast and crew want to
achieve. Overall, "The Normal
Heart" provides an edifying and
eye-opening experience, both
visually and emotionally.
Tickets for "The Normal
Heart " are still on sale at Tresid
der Ticket Office. Prices are $7
general admission and $4 for
seniors and students. Perfor
mances are November 11-14 at H
p.m. in the Little Theater.

epidemic. It tells the story of one
man's struggle to overcome polit
ical and social prejudices in order
to educate and alert both the gay
and straight communities about
the catastrophic consequences of
the virus. On a deeper level, it is
also a love story carrying the
message that love is the same in
all relationships.
First presented at the Public
Theater in New York City in
April 1985, "The Normal Heart"
was the first play to deal directly
with AIDS from the perspective
of the social and personal impli
cations brought about by the
virus.
Ed Isser, the director of the
Drama Department's production
of the play, first became inter
ested in the AIDS crisis in 1982
when his wife encountered the
new disease while completing her
medical training in New York
Citv.
At the time, Isser was working
as a stage manager and actor.
When the couple moved to Stan
ford two years later, Isser, in his
pursuit of a joint doctorate in
humanities and drama, decided
to make "The Normal Heart" his
thesis directing project.
Isser says that this play is a
way to "sensitize the Stanford
community into realizing that the
AIDS issue is now everybody's
problem and to show the suffer
ing that accompanies the prob
lem in the gay community."

Isser and set decorator John
Wilson have placed the AIDS
crisis into its historical context
through an audio-visual frame
work — using news clips to high
light the major stories of the pe
riod (the royal wedding of
Charles and Diana, the Tylenol
scare and Michael Jackson's
"Thriller").
The walls of the theater are
covered with the names of AIDS

victims, as well as the anti-AIDS
slogans of gay-haters. It's an in
teresting effect that is heightened
by the sterile environment of the
stage, which is achieved by using
only a few props for multiple
purposes. All of Wilson s sparse
and gray sets effectively clash
with the backdrop of an enor
mous replica of an AIDS virus at
tacking a normal, healthy red
blood cell.

"The Normal Heart" cast is
led by Drew Barr in a stirring
performance as Ned Weeks.
Gina Schmeling is equally good
in her role as the frustrated,
tough and sensitive Dr. Emma
Brookner. One of the most
moving performances in the play
comes from Glen Coffman as
Mickey Marcus, who goes
through a nervous breakdown
caused by the emotional strain of
not knowing how the virus is
contracted, by having to give up
the gay freedoms he has been
fighting for and by having to
watch his friends die one by one
as he helplessly stands by.
The entire cast does a good
job. The only scene that doesn't
quite ring true is Ned's con
frontation with his brother,
which seems to lack the sincerity
and intensity of the other scenes.
According to Drew Barr, who
plays Ned Weeks, "Our main
goal was to alert the Stanford
community about the issues sur
rounding the AIDS virus and to
show that homosexual love is a
normal love that exists in normal
relationships"
Hopefully, "The Normal
Heart" will generate the discus
sions and heightened awareness
that the cast and crew want to
achieve. Overall, "The Normal
Heart" provides an edifying and
eye-opening experience, both
visually and emotionally.
Tickets for "The Normal
Heart " are still on sale at Tresid
der Ticket Office. Prices are $7
general admission and $4 for
seniors and students. Perfor
mances are November 11-14 at H
