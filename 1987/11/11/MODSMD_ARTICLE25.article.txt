# Cast can't salvage 'H.M.S. Pinafore'
## 
### Debbie Frockt 
There were moments in Fri
day's production of Gilbert
and Sullivan's "H.M.S. Pina
fore" when the charm of the
pair's fanciful lyrics and
melodies rang through in
Dinkelspiel.
Unfortunately, this charm
was only sporadic, and at
times the production became
weighted down by a sense of
seriousness that slowed the
pacing and inhibited some of
the potential for fun.
Billed as a"Nautical Opera
in Two Fun-Filled Acts,"
"Pinafore" begins as Ralph
Rackshaw (Dan Gensemer),
an admirable but common
sailor, professes his love for
Josephine (Willa Anderson),
the daughter of the lofty Cap
tain (Charles Jordan).
To further complicate mat
ters, the head of the Queen's
Navy (John Musgrave) is in
hot pursuit of Josephine as
well. A few run-of-the-mill
twists of plot, fate and mis
taken identity are revealed,
enabling the characters to
overcome the burdens of class
distinction, general silliness
and a scheming villain.
The nearly century-old
work of Gilbert and Sullivan
has offers little that is innova
tive or spectacular. The
music, although pleasant and
hummable, is not the stuff that

moving theatrical memories
are made of. The cast,
however, fares somewhat bet
ter.
Gensemer's portrayal of
Rackstraw has the definite ap
peal of youth, simultaneously
colored with arrogance and
self-doubt. As Josephine, An
derson's voice is a standout.
There is no doubt she has a
glorious talent, but at times
she seems to become lost com
pletely in the act of singing and
ignores the vital obligations to
character and plot that are ne
cessary to sustain our interest
in the show's progression.
Musgrave's excellent por
trayal of Sir Joseph is appro
priately exaggerated. Unfor
tunately, Jordan, as the Cap
tain, can't sustain the same
level of farce; his pomposity is
at its striking best early in the
production, but seems to lose
steam throughout the show.
Both the male and female
choruses are strong. The
solos, highlighted by choral
echoes, carrying the perform
ance to sporadic peaks of en
thusiasm and fluidity. It is at
these moments that the good
natured warmth of the piece
manages to shine through.
"H.M.S. Pinafore" will
continue its run at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium on Nov. 13, 14 and
21 at 8 p.m. and Nov. 15 at
2:30 p.m.
