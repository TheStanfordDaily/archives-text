The Alarm — "Eye of the Hur
ricane"
Wait. This is the Alarm? Are
you sure? I could have sworn it
was U2 or something. That is,
something not too impressive in
the light of past Alarm releases.
One could sense a certain decline
in the rich Alarm sound on their
last release, "Strength/' and this
album seems to have continued
the downward trend.
Vague references to freedom,
the land of "Jericho" and that in
spiring "light that never dies" fill
the album; such references are
noble, but they're also somewhat
hackneyed. Anyway, U2 does it
better. The rough electric and
acoustic guitars have now been
given secondary status on most
songs or have been formulated to
sound amazingly similar to the
Edge's word in U2 (Check out
the track "Newtown Jericho").
Also, the fact that Alarm
drummer Twist is given credit for
"drum programming" must be a
sign of the musical times. All
these elements ultimately give
The Alarm an updated "modern
rock marathon" sound; but is
this what we should expect from
these lads? I should hope not.
Why, then, does this album

deserve mention? It's certainly
not for the cover picture (How
dare they cut their great big
hair!). It's not for the insert
(They didn't even include infor
mation on Amnesty Interna
tional). To be honest, there are
actually a few songs which at
tempt to recapture some of The
Alarm's old spirit, namely
"Hallowed Ground," "Shelter"
and "One Step Closer to
Home."
For the most part Mike Peter's
powerful voice is another power
ful plus for the album; however,
it often seems to be overpowered
by the omnipresent electronic
drums and bass synthesizers.
Nevertheless, you can be sure
this album will go multi-triple
platinum gold. It's got a good
beat, and it's easy to dance to.
What more could one ask for?
Big Black, perhaps.

Big Black — "Songs About Fuck
ing"
This is music that slaps you in
the face. No, that's too tame a
description. This is music that
rips your guts out and makes you
eat every bloody piece. No kid
ding. From the opening chord of

the first song to the very last this
album grabs you and refuses to
let go until the power is turned
otY, or you pass out.
It's sort of like old Jesus and
Mary Chain on acid. Or Hendrix
on 78 speed. But even that's not
accurate. Not even close.
The Chicago-based trio is best
described as "frantic metal de
pression." Forget elaborate pro
duction techniques, horns,
keyboards, etc. All you get is two
guitars turned up really loud, a
bass and electronic drums; but
this is not the sissy techno-type
of stuff you're used to hearing.
Believe you me, this is no sissy
band. And this is definitely not
for the faint of heart. In fact,
psychopathology, bigotry and al
most every other negative human
trait spurt out like blood from a
busted aorta on every track of
the album.
For example, a psycho beats a
girl to death because she refuses
to have sex with his brother on
"Fish Fry." Another track.
"Columbian Necktie" refers to a
South American slang word for
having one's throat cut from ear
to ear: "The necktie, a particu
larly humiliating way to die. . ."
Don't be mistaken. Big Black
isn't exploiting such themes in

their songs; they're only chroni
cling the darker, yet ever
present, side of these here
United States. That's it. They're
historians — historians of a his
tory that most of us would like to
forget.
In short, if reality scares you,
stay away from this album. If raw
powered rock scares you, move
on to The Alarm. But no one can
say we all couldn't use a little
something unsettling now and
then. And Big Black is just the
band to do it.

Jesus and Mary Chain —
"Darklands"
When Jesus and Mary Chain
released their first album,
"Psychocandy," in 1985, they
were hailed as the new holy icons
of the post-punk era. Critics
called them a monstrous musical
breakthrough, a regular pop phe
nomenon in the wake of punk's
collapse. So be it. Then for two
years they did nothing to live up
to these lofty expectations, save
for a single and an entry in a John
Hughes movie soundtrack. But
now they're back.
Their second LP, "Dark
lands," marks their return to the

college radio airwaves of
America, and it's a pretty
preachy job, if I may say so.
they're a lot cleaner this time
around. Gone is the giant wall of
distortion that blanketed most of
the first album. Certainly, there
are hints of noisiness in a few of
the songs, but all in all, th(s is
basically a nice record.
This album should interest
those of you who bought
"Psychocandy" and didn't care
for its fuzzy quality. "Dark
lands" ain't no sellout, however.
It's the same guys singing the
same kind of songs. Perhaps the
distortion was a stage, and they
were looking for a change of pace
with this release. I guess it really
doesn't matter much, though;
"Darklands" is a pretty groovy
album and should be in the
record collections of all.

Public Image Limited —
"Happy?"
Old soldiers never die, they
just release mediocre records.
Veteran John Lydon, the
"rottenest" ex-Pistol himself,
has put out yet another LP with
his current charges. Public Image
Limited (better known as PIL).

Titled "Happy?" this album
reflects a new sort of over
produced, commercial texture
that has apparently seeped into
John's twisted mind. His voice
sounds basically the same, that
distinctive banshee-esquc whine
piercing through the music in the
background.
But it's that darned music that
doesn't sound quite right. It's
danceable. It's got a beat. But
since when does PIL put out a
record like this? Johnny must be
going to bed with visions of lop
40 swarming through his brain.
One song, "Rules and Regula
tions," even has nice female
backup vocals, a la Sting.
I'm not exactly sure why this
odd metamorphosis is taking
place. Maybe PIL is running its
natural course. They've been
tinkering with their sound a bit
on their last couple of albums,
and maybe it was meant to come
to this. Or could it be that
Johnny's just getting downright
bored and is thus more inclined
to give us uninspired music.
Whatever the case, the record
is a disappointment, if not a com
plete flop. Happy? No, not
really.

trait spurt out like blood from a
busted aorta on every track of
the album.
For example, a psycho beats a
girl to death because she refuses
to have sex with his brother on
"Fish Fry." Another track.
"Columbian Necktie" refers to a
South American slang word for
having one's throat cut from ear
to ear: "The necktie, a particu
larly humiliating way to die. . ."
Don't be mistaken. Big Black
isn't exploiting such themes in

their songs; they're only chroni
cling the darker, yet ever
present, side of these here
United States. That's it. They're
historians — historians of a his
tory that most of us would like to
forget.
In short, if reality scares you,
stay away from this album. If raw
powered rock scares you, move
on to The Alarm. But no one can
say we all couldn't use a little
something unsettling now and
then. And Big Black is just the
band to do it.

Jesus and Mary Chain —
"Darklands"
When Jesus and Mary Chain
released their first album,
"Psychocandy," in 1985, they
were hailed as the new holy icons
of the post-punk era. Critics
called them a monstrous musical
breakthrough, a regular pop phe
nomenon in the wake of punk's
collapse. So be it. Then for two
years they did nothing to live up
to these lofty expectations, save
for a single and an entry in a John
Hughes movie soundtrack. But
now they're back.
Their second LP, "Dark
lands," marks their return to the

college radio airwaves of
America, and it's a pretty
preachy job, if I may say so.
they're a lot cleaner this time
around. Gone is the giant wall of
distortion that blanketed most of
the first album. Certainly, there
are hints of noisiness in a few of
the songs, but all in all, th(s is
basically a nice record.
This album should interest
those of you who bought
"Psychocandy" and didn't care
for its fuzzy quality. "Dark
lands" ain't no sellout, however.
It's the same guys singing the
same kind of songs. Perhaps the
distortion was a stage, and they
were looking for a change of pace
with this release. I guess it really
doesn't matter much, though;
"Darklands" is a pretty groovy
album and should be in the
record collections of all.

Public Image Limited —
"Happy?"
Old soldiers never die, they
just release mediocre records.
Veteran John Lydon, the
"rottenest" ex-Pistol himself,
has put out yet another LP with
his current charges. Public Image
Limited (better known as PIL).

Titled "Happy?" this album
reflects a new sort of over
produced, commercial texture
that has apparently seeped into
John's twisted mind. His voice
sounds basically the same, that
distinctive banshee-esquc whine
piercing through the music in the
background.
But it's that darned music that
doesn't sound quite right. It's
danceable. It's got a beat. But
since when does PIL put out a
record like this? Johnny must be
going to bed with visions of lop
40 swarming through his brain.
One song, "Rules and Regula
tions," even has nice female
backup vocals, a la Sting.
I'm not exactly sure why this
odd metamorphosis is taking
place. Maybe PIL is running its
natural course. They've been
tinkering with their sound a bit
on their last couple of albums,
and maybe it was meant to come
to this. Or could it be that
Johnny's just getting downright
bored and is thus more inclined
to give us uninspired music.
Whatever the case, the record
is a disappointment, if not a com
plete flop. Happy? No, not
really.

The Alarm — "Eye of the Hur
ricane"
Wait. This is the Alarm? Are
you sure? I could have sworn it
was U2 or something. That is,
something not too impressive in
the light of past Alarm releases.
One could sense a certain decline
in the rich Alarm sound on their
last release, "Strength/' and this
album seems to have continued
the downward trend.
Vague references to freedom,
the land of "Jericho" and that in
spiring "light that never dies" fill
the album; such references are
noble, but they're also somewhat
hackneyed. Anyway, U2 does it
better. The rough electric and
acoustic guitars have now been
given secondary status on most
songs or have been formulated to
sound amazingly similar to the
Edge's word in U2 (Check out
the track "Newtown Jericho").
Also, the fact that Alarm
drummer Twist is given credit for
"drum programming" must be a
sign of the musical times. All
these elements ultimately give
The Alarm an updated "modern
rock marathon" sound; but is
this what we should expect from
these lads? I should hope not.
Why, then, does this album

deserve mention? It's certainly
not for the cover picture (How
dare they cut their great big
hair!). It's not for the insert
(They didn't even include infor
mation on Amnesty Interna
tional). To be honest, there are
actually a few songs which at
tempt to recapture some of The
Alarm's old spirit, namely
"Hallowed Ground," "Shelter"
and "One Step Closer to
Home."
For the most part Mike Peter's
powerful voice is another power
ful plus for the album; however,
it often seems to be overpowered
by the omnipresent electronic
drums and bass synthesizers.
Nevertheless, you can be sure
this album will go multi-triple
platinum gold. It's got a good
beat, and it's easy to dance to.
What more could one ask for?
Big Black, perhaps.

Big Black — "Songs About Fuck
ing"
This is music that slaps you in
the face. No, that's too tame a
description. This is music that
rips your guts out and makes you
eat every bloody piece. No kid
ding. From the opening chord of

the first song to the very last this
album grabs you and refuses to
let go until the power is turned
otY, or you pass out.
It's sort of like old Jesus and
Mary Chain on acid. Or Hendrix
on 78 speed. But even that's not
accurate. Not even close.
The Chicago-based trio is best
described as "frantic metal de
pression." Forget elaborate pro
duction techniques, horns,
keyboards, etc. All you get is two
guitars turned up really loud, a
bass and electronic drums; but
this is not the sissy techno-type
of stuff you're used to hearing.
Believe you me, this is no sissy
band. And this is definitely not
for the faint of heart. In fact,
psychopathology, bigotry and al
most every other negative human
trait spurt out like blood from a
busted aorta on every track of

But it's that darned music that
doesn't sound quite right. It's
danceable. It's got a beat. But
since when does PIL put out a
record like this? Johnny must be
going to bed with visions of lop
40 swarming through his brain.
One song, "Rules and Regula
tions," even has nice female
backup vocals, a la Sting.
I'm not exactly sure why this
odd metamorphosis is taking
place. Maybe PIL is running its
natural course. They've been
tinkering with their sound a bit
on their last couple of albums,
and maybe it was meant to come
to this. Or could it be that
Johnny's just getting downright
bored and is thus more inclined
to give us uninspired music.
Whatever the case, the record
is a disappointment, if not a com
plete flop. Happy? No, not
really.
