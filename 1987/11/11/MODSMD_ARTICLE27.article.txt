## Praise brings no letters to sports columnist's box 
### 
Ah. the columnist's fate. No one writes unless
you absolutely rip someone.
Like USC or Bud Collins. Of course, when I
wrote that tennis commentator Collins is the
most obnoxious person on television, everyone
agreed.

USC is a different matter. Some people, in
cluding professors, actually went to USC. To
them I apologize for disparaging their alma
mater; but Marcus Cotten and the tennis team
are still arrogant jerks.
I love Rodney Peete, though. He's a great
quarterback — especially against Stanford. He
even plays shortstop for the Trojan baseball
team.
Nobody ever writes in if you like something,
though. You have to have a real aversion for
your topic for anyone else to get upset enough to
voice an opinion.
I like some pretty controversial things,
though.
• Candlestick Park — What's so bad about it?
Its a little cold, but the Giants play most of their
games during the day now, and intelligent people
bundle up at night. At least it has grass. And it's
in San Francisco, as opposed to the South Bay
or Phoenix or someplace.
• The Eric Dickerson trade — Great move by
the Colts. Now if they could only move back to
Baltimore. Or the South Bay. Or Phoenix. An
other good thing about this trade is that it really
hurts the Rams, a team I like almost as much as I
like USC.
• The three-point line — Come on, you really
like it too. Especially when your team is down
by 10 with a minute left. College basketball was
already exciting, but now . . .
• Women's basketball —They have the three
point line now, too. Go watch Jennifer Azzi and
the rest of the Stanford team this season and you
may be seeing the best basketball team on

campus. Great recruiting class, preseason top
20, what more could you want?
• The Boston Celtics — especially Danny
Ainge. And I'm from California.
•John McEnroe — My very favorite tennis
player of all time. Incredibly talented and even
more entertaining. I don't understand why
there's all this fuss about his temper; half the
people who go see McEnroe go just to see him
pop off.
Still, even these startling revelations won't
generate as much mail as would a column about
how overrated 1 think Vin Scully is. Yes, I really
do, and that's a whole 'nother column.
★ ★★
It's too bad the all-time NCAA career passing
leader Todd Santos won't be considered
seriously for the Heisman Trophy because of
San Diego State's miserable 3-7 record.
He's leading the nation in total offense with
301.4 yards per game, and it's not his fault the
San Diego State defense gives up even more
points than Santos and the offense can put on the
board. Against Stanford, the senior quarterback
threw for over 500 yards and the Aztec offense
scored 40 points. Stanford scored 44. What is
San Diego State coach Denny Stolz supposed to
say to Santos? "Sorry, Todd, but yoursoo yards
just weren't good enough."
An even bigger travesty occurred last week in
the San Diego State game at BYU when Santos
broke former Fresno State quarterback Kevin
Sweeney's NCAA career passing record late in
the game. BYU officials refused to stop the
game to give the ball to Santos and refused to ac
knowledge the achievement with an announce
ment of any kind.
The ball Santos used to break Sweeney's mark
of 10,623 yards was saved only when a quick
thinking assistant on the Aztec sidelines snagged
it during a first-down measurement. After the
game, BYU quarterback Sean Covey said he
didn't even realize Santos had broken the record
until after the contest and that the game should
have been stopped to honor the San Diego State
quarterback.
It's strange that BYU should have so little
class in the matter. After all, two Cougar quar
terbacks — Robbie Bosco and Jim McMahon —
have held the NCAA passing record in recent
years, and you can bet BYU officials would have
been quick to stop the game for them.

game to give the ball to Santos and refused to ac
knowledge the achievement with an announce
ment of any kind.
The ball Santos used to break Sweeney's mark
of 10,623 yards was saved only when a quick
thinking assistant on the Aztec sidelines snagged
it during a first-down measurement. After the
game, BYU quarterback Sean Covey said he
didn't even realize Santos had broken the record
until after the contest and that the game should
have been stopped to honor the San Diego State
quarterback.
It's strange that BYU should have so little
class in the matter. After all, two Cougar quar
terbacks — Robbie Bosco and Jim McMahon —
have held the NCAA passing record in recent
years, and you can bet BYU officials would have
been quick to stop the game for them.

Ah. the columnist's fate. No one writes unless
you absolutely rip someone.
Like USC or Bud Collins. Of course, when I
wrote that tennis commentator Collins is the
most obnoxious person on television, everyone
agreed.

USC is a different matter. Some people, in
cluding professors, actually went to USC. To
them I apologize for disparaging their alma
mater; but Marcus Cotten and the tennis team
are still arrogant jerks.
I love Rodney Peete, though. He's a great
quarterback — especially against Stanford. He
even plays shortstop for the Trojan baseball
team.
Nobody ever writes in if you like something,
though. You have to have a real aversion for
your topic for anyone else to get upset enough to
voice an opinion.
I like some pretty controversial things,
though.
• Candlestick Park — What's so bad about it?
Its a little cold, but the Giants play most of their
games during the day now, and intelligent people
bundle up at night. At least it has grass. And it's
in San Francisco, as opposed to the South Bay
or Phoenix or someplace.
• The Eric Dickerson trade — Great move by
the Colts. Now if they could only move back to
Baltimore. Or the South Bay. Or Phoenix. An
other good thing about this trade is that it really
hurts the Rams, a team I like almost as much as I
like USC.
• The three-point line — Come on, you really
like it too. Especially when your team is down
by 10 with a minute left. College basketball was
already exciting, but now . . .
• Women's basketball —They have the three
point line now, too. Go watch Jennifer Azzi and
the rest of the Stanford team this season and you
may be seeing the best basketball team on

campus. Great recruiting class, preseason top
20, what more could you want?
• The Boston Celtics — especially Danny
Ainge. And I'm from California.
•John McEnroe — My very favorite tennis
player of all time. Incredibly talented and even
more entertaining. I don't understand why
there's all this fuss about his temper; half the
people who go see McEnroe go just to see him
pop off.
Still, even these startling revelations won't
generate as much mail as would a column about
how overrated 1 think Vin Scully is. Yes, I really
do, and that's a whole 'nother column.

It's too bad the all-time NCAA career passing
leader Todd Santos won't be considered
seriously for the Heisman Trophy because of
San Diego State's miserable 3-7 record.
He's leading the nation in total offense with
301.4 yards per game, and it's not his fault the
San Diego State defense gives up even more
points than Santos and the offense can put on the
board. Against Stanford, the senior quarterback
threw for over 500 yards and the Aztec offense
scored 40 points. Stanford scored 44. What is
San Diego State coach Denny Stolz supposed to
say to Santos? "Sorry, Todd, but yoursoo yards
just weren't good enough."
An even bigger travesty occurred last week in
the San Diego State game at BYU when Santos
broke former Fresno State quarterback Kevin
Sweeney's NCAA career passing record late in
the game. BYU officials refused to stop the
game to give the ball to Santos and refused to ac
knowledge the achievement with an announce
ment of any kind.
The ball Santos used to break Sweeney's mark
of 10,623 yards was saved only when a quick
thinking assistant on the Aztec sidelines snagged
it during a first-down measurement. After the
game, BYU quarterback Sean Covey said he
didn't even realize Santos had broken the record
until after the contest and that the game should
have been stopped to honor the San Diego State
quarterback.
It's strange that BYU should have so little

terbacks — Robbie Bosco and Jim McMahon —

years, and you can bet BYU officials would have
