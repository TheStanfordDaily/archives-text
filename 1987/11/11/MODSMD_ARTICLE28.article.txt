# Card-White open play
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Both the starters and the
replacements had the nightclub
jitters last night as the Stanford
men's basketball team made its
debut in the Cardinal-White

scrimmage at Maples Pavilion.
The White team came out vic
torious in front of a crowd of 200
by a 70-52 score. And even
though the Cardinal players were
only competing against each
other, they said they felt rather
nervous.

They also played as if they
were nervous.
"We played very sloppy,"
junior Howard Wright said after
wards. "It was the first time in
front of a crowd and with offi
cials, and we were a little ner
vous, understandably."
"I wasn't real pleased (with
the team's performance)" Stan
ford Head Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We made an
awful lot of errors; we've still got
a lot to work on."
Montgomery pointed out that
it is difficult to play a high quality
game when a team is scrimmag
ing itself. Everyone knows what
the offense or defense is doing,
and cheats accordingly.
"We need to play somebody
else to see if this stuff is going to
work," Montgomery said.
"Then we might get more excited
about our screens and cuts."
The starting White team (the
first team), which Montgomery
coached, consisted of guards
Todd Lichti and Terry Taylor,
forwards Brian McSweeney and
Howard Wright, and center Greg
Butler, with guard Scott Meinert
and forward Deshon Wingate as
substitutes.
The Red team featured Oliver
Cunningham and John Patrick at
guard, Andrew Vlahov and Stuart
Thomas at forward, and Derek
Bruton at center, with Lang
Meyer, Brian Booker and Ben
Winkes on the bench.
Sometimes it seemed like all 14
of the players were on the court
at once; the game had its share of
extended loose-ball fiascos and
big men bombing from three
point range (at one point Thomas
tried an alley-oop pass and it
swished).

Everyone agreed that they did
not play well as a team.
"We were kind of impatient
with our shot selection," Taylor
said. "1 think that was mainly
due to it being the first time out
and everyone wanting to
impress."
Wright said he thought some of
the impatience and nervousness
was due to the absence of senior
Eric Reveno, who has been
forced to sit out the season with a
back injury.
"We've got some experience,
but we're pretty young without
Eric, and we miss his leader
ship," Wright said. "What he
brings to the team is more emo
tional â€” a hold-nothing-back at
titude."
After being held back for a
year as a redshirt, Wingate fi
nally made his Maples debut last
night with six points.
"I was kind of nervous the first
time with people in the stands,"
Wingate said. "I don't think it

will affect me next time. I'll be
able to block it out more."
Montgomery did mention one
bright spot amid the confusion
last night.
"I thought Bruton played
pretty well offensively during a
couple of stretches," he said.
With Reveno out for the year,
Stanford may need Bruton to
contribute more.
"I thought I played well of
fensively, but defensively I
didn't play well at all," Bruton
said. "I don't think I can fill
(Reveno's) shoes, but I hope to
play more of a role."
Bruton and several others are
looking to play more of a role as
the season progresses, and al
though Montgomery said he will
stick with the starting five he had
last night, he also said the team is
looking for certain combinations
that will gel.
"We're still looking for who is
going to be a guy that makes
other players better," Montgom
ery said.
The Cardinal will host the
Swedish touring team Sunday
night at 7:35 p.m. in Maples.
