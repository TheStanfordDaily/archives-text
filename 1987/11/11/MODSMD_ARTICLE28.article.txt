# Card-White open play
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Both the starters and the
replacements had the nightclub
jitters last night as the Stanford
men's basketball team made its
debut in the Cardinal-White

scrimmage at Maples Pavilion.
The White team came out vic
torious in front of a crowd of 200
by a 70-52 score. And even
though the Cardinal players were
only competing against each
other, they said they felt rather
nervous.

They also played as if they
were nervous.
"We played very sloppy,"
junior Howard Wright said after
wards. "It was the first time in
front of a crowd and with offi
cials, and we were a little ner
vous, understandably."
"I wasn't real pleased (with
the team's performance)" Stan
ford Head Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We made an
awful lot of errors; we've still got
a lot to work on."
Montgomery pointed out that
it is difficult to play a high quality
game when a team is scrimmag
ing itself. Everyone knows what
the offense or defense is doing,
and cheats accordingly.
"We need to play somebody
else to see if this stuff is going to
work," Montgomery said.
"Then we might get more excited
about our screens and cuts."
The starting White team (the
first team), which Montgomery
coached, consisted of guards
Todd Lichti and Terry Taylor,
forwards Brian McSweeney and
Howard Wright, and center Greg
Butler, with guard Scott Meinert
and forward Deshon Wingate as
substitutes.
The Red team featured Oliver
Cunningham and John Patrick at
guard, Andrew Vlahov and Stuart
Thomas at forward, and Derek
Bruton at center, with Lang
Meyer, Brian Booker and Ben
Winkes on the bench.
Sometimes it seemed like all 14
of the players were on the court
at once; the game had its share of
extended loose-ball fiascos and
big men bombing from three
point range (at one point Thomas
tried an alley-oop pass and it
swished).
