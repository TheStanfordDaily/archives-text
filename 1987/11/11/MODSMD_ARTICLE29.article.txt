# Soccer ends year at St. Mary's
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Down to the final game of the
season, the men's soccer team is
battling for a winning record.
One month ago the Cardinal
was 7-4-2 and had just defeated
three top 10 teams. After the
team won the ATT/Pacific West
Soccer Classic Oct. 11, there was
much speculation about a na
tional ranking and the squad's
first-ever NCAA tournament bid.
But the talented booters could
not maintain their consistency,
and, at 9-H-3, are fighting just to
finish over .S(X).

Stanford's year ends today in
Moraga, where the Cardinal
faces league rival St. Mary's.
The Gaels have struggled all
season and are 3-14-2 overall, 0-5
in the Pacific Soccer Conference.
On top of this, they have not won
in over a month.
Although the Gaels are not a
formidable squad, the Cardinal
has bowed to weaker opponents
on numerous occasions during
the season and is not going into
the match overconfident. Stan
ford was favored going into its
matches against Sacramento
State, San Jose State and Simon
Fraser this year, all of which it

lost. Last season the Cardinal
was defeated at home by the
Gaels, 1-0. Coach Sam Koch
feels St. Mary's is overall not a
powerful team, but definitely has
some strong players.
"They're not a squad to be
taken lightly," he said. "They
definitely have the ability to
win."
The Cardinal does feel it has
the potential to be victorious
today, especially coming off a 1-0
shutout of California on Sunday.
Stanford is going for its eighth
shutout of the year. To do this,
the squad plans to play very tight
man-to-man defense, giving the

Gaels little space to move the
ball, Koch said. "We want to
shut them down and close their
space," he said.
Offensively, Stanford will at
tempt to one- and two-touch the
ball and work quickly to create
the fast break and out-maneuver
the St. Mary's backfield. The
squad is also going to use its
tested threat of quick countering
to get the ball into Gael territory
and set up scoring opportunities.
According to Koch, if the man
to-man defense is successful, it
should also create offensive op
portunities for the Cardinal.
"But the key to the contest
will be communication on
defense as well as the squad's ac
tual performance," he said.
Senior goalie Alan Branson
will be starting instead of regular
Chris Helling. It will be his
second start of the year. After
Branson's shutout performance
and seven saves during the
second half of Sunday's match
against the Bears, Koch is confi
dent he can do the job. In his four
previous appearances this season
Branson has allowed only one
goal, against Connecticut in the
second game of the year.
Koch is also planning on start
ing and playing as many seniors
as possible in today's match.
Seniors Ross Torres and Mike
Mossmer will start up front, and
will be joined by Pat Sheehy and
Brian Mahaffey in the midfield,
Tim Westergren at fullback and
Branson in the goal.
"I'd like to use seniors as well
as other players who have
worked hard but haven't seen
much time this season," Koch
stated.
Besides establishing a winning
record, the Cardinal would like a
victory to end the up-and-down
year on an up beat.
"We're disappointed at not
going to the NCAA playoffs,"
senior Tim Westergren said. "So
now we just want to win."

formidable squad, the Cardinal
has bowed to weaker opponents
on numerous occasions during
the season and is not going into
the match overconfident. Stan
ford was favored going into its
matches against Sacramento
State, San Jose State and Simon
Fraser this year, all of which it

lost. Last season the Cardinal
was defeated at home by the
Gaels, 1-0. Coach Sam Koch
feels St. Mary's is overall not a
powerful team, but definitely has
some strong players.
"They're not a squad to be
taken lightly," he said. "They
definitely have the ability to
win."
The Cardinal does feel it has
the potential to be victorious
today, especially coming off a 1-0
shutout of California on Sunday.
Stanford is going for its eighth
shutout of the year. To do this,
the squad plans to play very tight
man-to-man defense, giving the

Gaels little space to move the
ball, Koch said. "We want to
shut them down and close their
space," he said.
Offensively, Stanford will at
tempt to one- and two-touch the
ball and work quickly to create
the fast break and out-maneuver
the St. Mary's backfield. The
squad is also going to use its
tested threat of quick countering
to get the ball into Gael territory
and set up scoring opportunities.
According to Koch, if the man
to-man defense is successful, it
should also create offensive op
portunities for the Cardinal.
"But the key to the contest
will be communication on
defense as well as the squad's ac
tual performance," he said.
Senior goalie Alan Branson
will be starting instead of regular
Chris Helling. It will be his
second start of the year. After
Branson's shutout performance
and seven saves during the
second half of Sunday's match
against the Bears, Koch is confi
dent he can do the job. In his four
previous appearances this season
Branson has allowed only one
goal, against Connecticut in the
second game of the year.
Koch is also planning on start
ing and playing as many seniors
as possible in today's match.
Seniors Ross Torres and Mike
Mossmer will start up front, and
will be joined by Pat Sheehy and
Brian Mahaffey in the midfield,
Tim Westergren at fullback and
Branson in the goal.
"I'd like to use seniors as well
as other players who have
worked hard but haven't seen
much time this season," Koch
stated.
Besides establishing a winning
record, the Cardinal would like a
victory to end the up-and-down
year on an up beat.
"We're disappointed at not
going to the NCAA playoffs,"
senior Tim Westergren said. "So
now we just want to win."
