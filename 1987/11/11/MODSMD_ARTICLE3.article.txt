# ASSU Senate meeting
## Kennedy denies Bohemian link 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy yesterday discounted recent
claims that the University has a policy
of subsidizing faculty memberships in
the exclusive, all-male Bohemian Club.
"I know nothing of such policies, as
they are not the subject of arrange
ments between the club and the Uni
versity," Kennedy told a meeting of
the ASSU Senate last night.
Kennedy also said the campus-wide
grape boycott urged by the senate two
weeks ago "removes from students the
right to decide (the issue) for them
selves."
The fact that several University fac
ulty members are members of the con
troversial San Francisco club has
drawn fire from critics who have
claimed that the University provides
reimbursement for club dues paid by
faculty members.
Kennedy said that "at the individ
ual's request ... the University reim
burses expenses it regards as likely to
enhance the employee's effectiveness

in performing University duties."
Kennedy explained that requests for
reimbursement by University employ
ees are "judged on a case-by-case
basis."
"If the club does not violate the law,
then it's OK," he said. "Faculty and
staff are responsible for their own deci
sions (as to which clubs they wish to
join)."
"Stanford's policy emphasizes indi

vidual choice," said Kennedy, who
separated the issue of allowing faculty
to join clubs that practice legal discrim
ination from the issue of reimburse
ment for club dues.
According to Bohemian Club Presi
dent George Elliot, club members pay
an $8500 initiation fee and a $110
monthly fee.
Senator Stacey Leyton, who
introduced a resolution last night
calling for an end to any
Stanford-Bohemian Club ties,
said it was "very difficult to sep
arate those two issues."
Leyton, a senior, compared
the reimbursement issue with di
vestment, where the issue is "not
considered separate on financial
issues and moral issues."
"The University is reimburs
ing faculty members in institu
tions that discriminate on the
basis of sex," she said.
"We're not asking Stanford to
make moral choices for the fac
ulty," said Leyton. "We're just
asking Stanford to not give
money for their memberships."
Regarding the senate's recent
grape boycott resolution, Ken
nedy noted that the senate does
not have the power to implement
University policy.

"Those (students) favoring the
grape boycott have means at
hand to try to influence the
choices of others," Kennedy
said.
He said a low demand for
grapes, for example, would cause
University Food Service to take
grapes off its buying list.
In May, the senate approved a
resolution calling for a campus
wide grape boycott in support of
a statewide boycott led by the
United Farm Workers Union.
The UFW has claimed that five
carcinogenic pesticides are used
in the growing of grapes and that
as a result some grape pickers
have developed cancer.
Although Food Service
stopped buying grapes last
spring, it decided this summer to
begin buying them again.
Many senators said the Uni
versity's response to the senate's
call for a boycott tests the
legitimacy of the senate as the
representative body of the stu
dents.
