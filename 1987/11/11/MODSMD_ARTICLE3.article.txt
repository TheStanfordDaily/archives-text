# ASSU Senate meeting
## Kennedy denies Bohemian link 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy yesterday discounted recent
claims that the University has a policy
of subsidizing faculty memberships in
the exclusive, all-male Bohemian Club.
"I know nothing of such policies, as
they are not the subject of arrange
ments between the club and the Uni
versity," Kennedy told a meeting of
the ASSU Senate last night.
Kennedy also said the campus-wide
grape boycott urged by the senate two
weeks ago "removes from students the
right to decide (the issue) for them
selves."
The fact that several University fac
ulty members are members of the con
troversial San Francisco club has
drawn fire from critics who have
claimed that the University provides
reimbursement for club dues paid by
faculty members.
Kennedy said that "at the individ
ual's request ... the University reim
burses expenses it regards as likely to
enhance the employee's effectiveness

in performing University duties."
Kennedy explained that requests for
reimbursement by University employ
ees are "judged on a case-by-case
basis."
"If the club does not violate the law,
then it's OK," he said. "Faculty and
staff are responsible for their own deci
sions (as to which clubs they wish to
join)."
"Stanford's policy emphasizes indi

vidual choice," said Kennedy, who
separated the issue of allowing faculty
to join clubs that practice legal discrim
ination from the issue of reimburse
ment for club dues.
According to Bohemian Club Presi
dent George Elliot, club members pay
an $8500 initiation fee and a $110
monthly fee.
