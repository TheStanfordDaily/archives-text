A Nov. 10 article on the
Bohemian Club incorrectly re
ported the actions of ASSU
Senator Stacey Leyton at a press
conference last Wednesday.
Leyton did not state that that
Stanford was secretly subsidizing
the club dues of some of its fac
ulty members; rather she asked
the University to comment on
whether or not this was the case.
