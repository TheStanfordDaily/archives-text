# Law prof. tops Supreme Court survey
## 
### Lori Silver Editorial staff 
Although the Reagan administration's
search for a viable Supreme Court nominee
appears to be over, a recent nationwide sur
vey of legal experts suggests that Stanford
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther may be the most
qualified candidate for the vacant seat.
White House officials said yesterday that
President Reagan has decided to nominate
federal appellate judge and Stanford alumnus
Anthony Kennedy to the court.
Conducted in late October by the New
York Law Journal and published in the Na
tional Law Journal, the survey found that
Gunther had the overwhelming support of 50
top law school deans, judges and attorneys
from all parts of the political spectrum. Over
80 percent of those surveyed supported Gun

ther, said reporter David Kaplan, who con
ducted the poll.
The survey asked experts, "Ideology
aside, who would be the most qualified for a
vacancy on the Court?"
Kaplan said Gunther had "extremely
broad, across-the-board support."
Other top choices in the poll included Stan
ford Law Prof. John Hart Ely, Yale Law
School Dean Guido Calabresi, CIA Director
William Webster.
Kennedy, whom Reagan is expected to
name today as his nominee, had "far less"
support, Kaplan said.
Kaplan said that many experts surveyed
named Kennedy "because his name is in the
news."
Gunther said he was "delighted, gratified,
and stunned" that he had been selected.
" There aren't 10 people in the country who

are the scholar that Gunther is," Kaplan said.
Gunther is the author of the most widely used
law textbook and is considered to be one of
the top consititutional scholars in the nation.
Guther, a Democrat, said he wasn't con
tacted by the Reagan administration for the
nomination.
"Some people in the administration would
not like me," he said. But, he added, "If
(Massachusetts Senator) Ted Kennedy was
president, he wouldn't like me either."
"If they want an ideological crusader on
the left or the right, then I'm the wrong guy,"
Gunther said, adding that he was more of "a
whip."
Gunther described his judicial philosophy
as one that decides each issue case by case,
weighing both sides of the argument. Justices
he admires include Lewis Powell Jr., John
Paul Stevens and John Marshall Hall.
