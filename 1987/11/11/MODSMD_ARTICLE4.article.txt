### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night ap
proved funds for the revival of the
ASSU Course Guide, a student course
evaluation guide it discontinued two
years ago.
According to Council of Presidents
member Leonard Adler, the course
guide will provide descriptions of most
undergraduate courses based on stu
dent evaluations.
"You could expect to find at least

the large lecture classes (such as) Polit
ical Science 1, Economics 1 or Psy
chology 1, Adler said. "It won't focus
that much on small classes."
Adler said that the course descrip
tions will be "professor-specific,"
meaning that students' descriptions of
courses are based on last year's profes
sors.
The course guide will be available on
SOCRATES, not in the booklet form of
past years, Adler said. The guide
should be ready by winter quar
ter, he added.
In other business, COP mem
ber Jim Durkin announced that
the first ASSU straw poll will
take place Monday, Nov. 17.
Pollsters will call 200 randomly
selected students.
