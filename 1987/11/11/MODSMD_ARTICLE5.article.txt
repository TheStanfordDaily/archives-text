# IFC to address gay discrimination
## 
### Sean Kinch Staff writer 
Intrafraternity Council offi
cials pledged last night to combat
discrimination against gays
during Rush and to encourage
greater understanding of the gay
community.
At a meeting of IFC officials,
representatives from the gay
community and Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano, IFC Vice
President Stuart Levy said he
will suggest to the IFC Rush
Committee that the University's
non-discriminatory policy be
printed on all literature for this
year's Rush.
Pisano agreed to establish a
phone number for people to call

who feel they have been discrimi
nated against during Rush.
IFC President Vinny Frost said
if Pisano discovers that "a frater
nity is consistently discriminat
ing against a group of people,
that fraternity's future at Stan
ford would be in danger."
Levy also said he and Frost
will "strongly encourage"
housed fraternities to invite the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford (GLAS) to speak at
their residences.
The meeting was originally
suggested by junior Barb Voss, a
member of the Stanford Organi
zation for Lesbian and Gay
Equality. She said she sought the
meeting after hearing comments

made by Frost in a KZSU inter
view last week.
"His (Frost's) opinion was
that homophobia is probably
greater in fraternities than else
where in the University; so we
called the meeting to talk about
ways to combat that homopho
bia," Voss said.
Although Voss said she was
pleased with the outcome of the
meeting, she said it is "obvious
that a lot of heterosexual values
are entrenched in (the fraternity)
community."
Frost said that although the
IFC "will actively encourage fra
ternities to recruit from all
groups," including the gay com
munity, it is unlikely that a sub

stantial increase in the number of
gay fraternity members will oc
cur quickly.
"It will take a readjustment of
our (fraternity) values before an
openly gay man could be a mem
ber of a fraternity," Frost said.
Furthermore, Frost said he
believes a fraternity has the right
to exclude gays, provided the fra
ternity's selection is "based
more on the individuals than on
prejudice, ignorance or stereo
types."
"If a fraternity collectively
decides that they are uncomfort
able with homosexual members,
which may well be the case for
most fraternities, I think they
have the right not to select
them," Frost said.
