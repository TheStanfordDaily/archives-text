# Lougee looks forward to teaching again

### John M. Wagner Jr 
"This year I've really cut
myself off," Carolyn Lougee
said, surrounded by the volumes
of books that adorn the walls of
her History Department office.
After having served six years
as Stanford's dean of Undergrad
uate Studies, Lougee has em
barked upon a year-long sabbati
cal and is looking forward to re
turning to her "real professional
responsibilities" of teaching and
research.
"My job is as a member of the
faculty who was temporarily
doing some administrative
work," she said of her work as
dean.
Her two three-year terms as

dean have produced changes at
Stanford that in all likelihood will
be anything but temporary. One
of Lougee's major projects was
overseeing the evolution of the
University's Western Culture
program, an innovation she in
spired in 1980 prior to her ap
pointment as dean.
She also directed development
of the freshman writing program
and was instrumental in reor
ganizing the Center for Teaching
and Learning, the Innovative Ac
ademic Courses program and the
office of Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities.
Upon announcing her resigna
tion last spring, Lougee said she
"felt a little reluctant," but knew
it was time to return to her schol

arship. She said her decision was
made more difficult by the fact
that one of the undergraduate
programs she helped develop —
the Western Culture program —
was in the midst of substantial
change.
"It's a wonderful time to be in
volved with undergraduate edu
cation at Stanford because we
have a very good sense now of
where we want to go," she said.
"It was very exciting to oversee
that conceptual phase (of innova
tions), and it will be exciting for
my successor who gets to take
the implementation from the first
stages along to something more
permanent.
Philosophy Prof. Thomas
Wasow replaced Lougee as dean

of Undergraduate Studies this
summer.
During this sabbatical year,
Lougee said, her mind is not on
administrative matters. She
spends most of her time at Stan
ford's Center for Advanced
Study, where 40 scholars from
across the country convene to do
research and exchange ideas.
"I'm up there (at the Center
for Advanced Study) and not
thinking too much about the
progress of things I set in place,"
she said. "I'm not feeling left
out. When I come back (to teach
ing) next year and I'm here and
I'm living in it again, it may be
harder."
