# Lougee looks forward to teaching again
## Inside 
### John M. Wagner Jr 
"This year I've really cut
myself off," Carolyn Lougee
said, surrounded by the volumes
of books that adorn the walls of
her History Department office.
After having served six years
as Stanford's dean of Undergrad
uate Studies, Lougee has em
barked upon a year-long sabbati
cal and is looking forward to re
turning to her "real professional
responsibilities" of teaching and
research.
"My job is as a member of the
faculty who was temporarily
doing some administrative
work," she said of her work as
dean.
Her two three-year terms as

dean have produced changes at
Stanford that in all likelihood will
be anything but temporary. One
of Lougee's major projects was
overseeing the evolution of the
University's Western Culture
program, an innovation she in
spired in 1980 prior to her ap
pointment as dean.
She also directed development
of the freshman writing program
and was instrumental in reor
ganizing the Center for Teaching
and Learning, the Innovative Ac
ademic Courses program and the
office of Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities.
Upon announcing her resigna
tion last spring, Lougee said she
"felt a little reluctant," but knew
it was time to return to her schol

arship. She said her decision was
made more difficult by the fact
that one of the undergraduate
programs she helped develop —
the Western Culture program —
was in the midst of substantial
change.
"It's a wonderful time to be in
volved with undergraduate edu
cation at Stanford because we
have a very good sense now of
where we want to go," she said.
"It was very exciting to oversee
that conceptual phase (of innova
tions), and it will be exciting for
my successor who gets to take
the implementation from the first
stages along to something more
permanent.
Philosophy Prof. Thomas
Wasow replaced Lougee as dean

of Undergraduate Studies this
summer.
During this sabbatical year,
Lougee said, her mind is not on
administrative matters. She
spends most of her time at Stan
ford's Center for Advanced
Study, where 40 scholars from
across the country convene to do
research and exchange ideas.
"I'm up there (at the Center
for Advanced Study) and not
thinking too much about the
progress of things I set in place,"
she said. "I'm not feeling left
out. When I come back (to teach
ing) next year and I'm here and
I'm living in it again, it may be
harder."
During her sabbatical, Lougee
said her main task has been to
complete her second book,
which she began in 1976. "I have
done virtually all of the re
search," she said. "I found when
I was dean 1 did not have time to
write."
The book is a case study of
Saint-Cyr, a French Catholic
boarding school for girls founded
in 1586 and closed during the
Revolution in 1792. Lougee said
she is trying to relate "the exper
ience of going to school in the
18th century — what it was like,
what one learned, how one
learned, what the classroom was
like, what the dynamics of the
classroom were, the dynamics
between the teacher and pupil."
Lougee said Saint-Cyr is a
very well-known and well
documented school, but
"nobody's really studied it
closely."
Over this past summer Lougee
also completed the software for a
computer simulation of life in
17th-century France. The game
draws upon the work of her first
book, published in 1976, in which
she examined the social
structures and social mobility of
17th-century Paris.
In the computer simulation,
the user logs on as a 30-year-old
bourgeois male in 1638 with "a
little money and a little land,"
who must survive the conse
quences of decisions he makes
about investing in land and
bonds, operating fields, and get
ting married and having children.
More often than not, the user
goes bankrupt or is hung by a

popular uprising, Lougee said.
The concept of the game arose,
Lougee said, from "thinking
about whether there might be
some way of interesting students
in history by using the computer,
because certain students are in
terested in history and certain
others you really have to grab

them by the collar and pull them
in."
The simulation is "just starting
to get quite well-known,"
Lougee said. She recently won
first place for software in a com
petition sponsored by the Na
tional Center for Research to Im
prove Postsecondary Teaching

and Learning, and over the sum
mer received second place in Ap
ple Computer's "Wheels for the
Mind Awards" contest.
Her interest in computers goes
back a number of years. Lougee
said that when she first came to
Stanford in 1973, she was "the
first faculty member in the de
partment to offer a course on
using the computer in historical
research."
She was also the first woman
ever hired by the department.
Her hiring, she said, came after
"a kind of mini-revolt by the
graduate students in the depart
ment who were tired of the fac
ulty hiring man after man after
man." She contends she was
"very-well treated" by her new
colleagues. "The department
decided to give me a real shot,"
she said, "to give me a real
chance."
"1 felt 1 had a big responsibility
to future hiring of women ... I
really felt that 1 had to succeed;
because if I didn't, it was going to
set the cause of women faculty
back, and that I found a heavy
burden to carry."
In retrospect, the burden may
not have been as great as she
thought.
"1 probably exaggerated that
feeling, but nonetheless I had
[ it ]," she said, adding that
"things have worked out for
me."
In society at large, though,
Lougee admits that things ha
ven't worked out as well for
women as she once thought they
would. "[ Women ] thought that
opportunities were going to open
up much more quickly and com
pletely than they have," she

said. "A lot of what's involved in
equalizing chances is in women's
own thinking itself. Women's
own thinking hasn't changed as
fast or as completely as I once
thought it would."
Still, "the outlook is positive"
for women, she said.
Another evolving mindset
Lougee said she has witnessed is
Stanford students' interest in
"defining the character of the in
stitution." Upon her arrival in
1973, the University was experi
encing what she called "a very
difficult period for Stanford."
During the decade that followed,
she said, there was "much less
apparent student interest [ in cur
rent issues. It was ] a very quiet
time in terms of student voices,"
she said.
She said she now "sees some
what of a return" to the more vo
cal days of the past. "I'm very
pleased to see students better en
gaged now," she said.
"Students know a lot about
what they need. . . . We've gone
through a long period of student
passivity. In about the last two
years the students have been
much more involved in thinking
on issues like divestment and
Western Culture," she said.
Understandably, the current
Western Culture debate holds
special interest for Lougee. Prior
to her appointment as dean (in
1982), she was the head of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies that initially recom
mended the creation of the West
ern Culture requirement in 1980.
She said she "was there carrying
the ball in the institution of the
requirement."
Presently a member of the

Western Culture Task Force,
Lougee said she "would like to
see the Area One requirement
broader than the West because I
think freshman have almost al
ways relatively narrow experi
ence from their own vantage
point."
She called the recent task force
report "a very good beginning."
If the recommendations of the
task force are adopted, she said,
"I think we'll see some very in
teresting courses."
Lougee said that when she
returns to teaching next year she
would like to again teach a West
ern Culture course. During her
tenure as dean, Lougee fre
quently taught one quarter of the
History track of Western Cul
ture.
She said she views her return
from administration to the class
room as a transition from
"making differences in a big
way" to making differences that
are "often less readily appar
ent."
"The difference you make (in
administration) isn't necessarily
more important, but it is more
visible," she explained. "I do
think teaching is unquestionably
an activity in which you make a
difference. That's where the
satisfactions in teaching come
from."
Lougee said she is satisfied
with her life on sabbatical be
cause it allows her more time
with her family. "I'm not spend
ing 24 hours a day on my scholar
ship," she explained. "I also
have some personal things that I
haven't been able to do for five
years that I'm doing now."

boarding school for girls founded
in 1586 and closed during the
Revolution in 1792. Lougee said
she is trying to relate "the exper
ience of going to school in the
18th century — what it was like,
what one learned, how one
learned, what the classroom was
like, what the dynamics of the
classroom were, the dynamics
between the teacher and pupil."
Lougee said Saint-Cyr is a
very well-known and well
documented school, but
"nobody's really studied it
closely."
Over this past summer Lougee
also completed the software for a
computer simulation of life in
17th-century France. The game
draws upon the work of her first
book, published in 1976, in which
she examined the social
structures and social mobility of
17th-century Paris.
In the computer simulation,
the user logs on as a 30-year-old
bourgeois male in 1638 with "a
little money and a little land,"
who must survive the conse
quences of decisions he makes
about investing in land and
bonds, operating fields, and get
ting married and having children.
More often than not, the user
goes bankrupt or is hung by a

popular uprising, Lougee said.
The concept of the game arose,
Lougee said, from "thinking
about whether there might be
some way of interesting students
in history by using the computer,
because certain students are in
terested in history and certain
others you really have to grab

them by the collar and pull them
in."
The simulation is "just starting
to get quite well-known,"
Lougee said. She recently won
first place for software in a com
petition sponsored by the Na
tional Center for Research to Im
prove Postsecondary Teaching

and Learning, and over the sum
mer received second place in Ap
ple Computer's "Wheels for the
Mind Awards" contest.
Her interest in computers goes
back a number of years. Lougee
said that when she first came to
Stanford in 1973, she was "the
first faculty member in the de
partment to offer a course on
using the computer in historical
research."
She was also the first woman
ever hired by the department.
Her hiring, she said, came after
"a kind of mini-revolt by the
graduate students in the depart
ment who were tired of the fac
ulty hiring man after man after
man." She contends she was
"very-well treated" by her new
colleagues. "The department
decided to give me a real shot,"
she said, "to give me a real
chance."
"1 felt 1 had a big responsibility
to future hiring of women ... I
really felt that 1 had to succeed;
because if I didn't, it was going to
set the cause of women faculty
back, and that I found a heavy
burden to carry."
In retrospect, the burden may
not have been as great as she
thought.
"1 probably exaggerated that
feeling, but nonetheless I had
[ it ]," she said, adding that
"things have worked out for
me."
In society at large, though,
Lougee admits that things ha
ven't worked out as well for
women as she once thought they
would. "[ Women ] thought that
opportunities were going to open
up much more quickly and com
pletely than they have," she

said. "A lot of what's involved in
equalizing chances is in women's
own thinking itself. Women's
own thinking hasn't changed as
fast or as completely as I once
thought it would."
Still, "the outlook is positive"
for women, she said.
Another evolving mindset
Lougee said she has witnessed is
Stanford students' interest in
"defining the character of the in
stitution." Upon her arrival in
1973, the University was experi
encing what she called "a very
difficult period for Stanford."
During the decade that followed,
she said, there was "much less
apparent student interest [ in cur
rent issues. It was ] a very quiet
time in terms of student voices,"
she said.
She said she now "sees some
what of a return" to the more vo
cal days of the past. "I'm very
pleased to see students better en
gaged now," she said.
"Students know a lot about
what they need. . . . We've gone
through a long period of student
passivity. In about the last two
years the students have been
much more involved in thinking
on issues like divestment and
Western Culture," she said.
Understandably, the current
Western Culture debate holds
special interest for Lougee. Prior
to her appointment as dean (in
1982), she was the head of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies that initially recom
mended the creation of the West
ern Culture requirement in 1980.
She said she "was there carrying
the ball in the institution of the
requirement."
Presently a member of the

Western Culture Task Force,
Lougee said she "would like to
see the Area One requirement
broader than the West because I
think freshman have almost al
ways relatively narrow experi
ence from their own vantage
point."
She called the recent task force
report "a very good beginning."
If the recommendations of the
task force are adopted, she said,
"I think we'll see some very in
teresting courses."
Lougee said that when she
returns to teaching next year she
would like to again teach a West
ern Culture course. During her
tenure as dean, Lougee fre
quently taught one quarter of the
History track of Western Cul
ture.
She said she views her return
from administration to the class
room as a transition from
"making differences in a big
way" to making differences that
are "often less readily appar
ent."
"The difference you make (in
administration) isn't necessarily
more important, but it is more
visible," she explained. "I do
think teaching is unquestionably
an activity in which you make a
difference. That's where the
satisfactions in teaching come
from."
Lougee said she is satisfied
with her life on sabbatical be
cause it allows her more time
with her family. "I'm not spend
ing 24 hours a day on my scholar
ship," she explained. "I also
have some personal things that I
haven't been able to do for five
years that I'm doing now."

With six vears as dean of Undergraduate Studies behind her, Carolyn
Lougee plans to take a year's sabbatical and then return to teaching in
the History Department.
"This year I've really cut
myself off," Carolyn Lougee
said, surrounded by the volumes
of books that adorn the walls of
her History Department office.
After having served six years
as Stanford's dean of Undergrad
uate Studies, Lougee has em
barked upon a year-long sabbati
cal and is looking forward to re
turning to her "real professional
responsibilities" of teaching and
research.
"My job is as a member of the
faculty who was temporarily
doing some administrative
work," she said of her work as
dean.
Her two three-year terms as

dean have produced changes at
Stanford that in all likelihood will
be anything but temporary. One
of Lougee's major projects was
overseeing the evolution of the
University's Western Culture
program, an innovation she in
spired in 1980 prior to her ap
pointment as dean.
She also directed development
of the freshman writing program
and was instrumental in reor
ganizing the Center for Teaching
and Learning, the Innovative Ac
ademic Courses program and the
office of Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities.
Upon announcing her resigna
tion last spring, Lougee said she
"felt a little reluctant," but knew
it was time to return to her schol

arship. She said her decision was
made more difficult by the fact
that one of the undergraduate
programs she helped develop —
the Western Culture program —
was in the midst of substantial
change.
"It's a wonderful time to be in
volved with undergraduate edu
cation at Stanford because we
have a very good sense now of
where we want to go," she said.
"It was very exciting to oversee
that conceptual phase (of innova
tions), and it will be exciting for
my successor who gets to take
the implementation from the first
stages along to something more
permanent.
Philosophy Prof. Thomas
Wasow replaced Lougee as dean

of Undergraduate Studies this
summer.
During this sabbatical year,
Lougee said, her mind is not on
administrative matters. She
spends most of her time at Stan
ford's Center for Advanced
Study, where 40 scholars from
across the country convene to do
research and exchange ideas.
"I'm up there (at the Center
for Advanced Study) and not
thinking too much about the
progress of things I set in place,"
she said. "I'm not feeling left
out. When I come back (to teach
ing) next year and I'm here and
I'm living in it again, it may be
harder."
During her sabbatical, Lougee
said her main task has been to
complete her second book,
which she began in 1976. "I have
done virtually all of the re
search," she said. "I found when
I was dean 1 did not have time to
write."
The book is a case study of
Saint-Cyr, a French Catholic
boarding school for girls founded
in 1586 and closed during the

In retrospect, the burden may
not have been as great as she
thought.
"1 probably exaggerated that
feeling, but nonetheless I had
[ it ]," she said, adding that
"things have worked out for
me."
In society at large, though,
Lougee admits that things ha
ven't worked out as well for
women as she once thought they
would. "[ Women ] thought that
opportunities were going to open
up much more quickly and com
pletely than they have," she

said. "A lot of what's involved in
equalizing chances is in women's
own thinking itself. Women's
own thinking hasn't changed as
fast or as completely as I once
thought it would."
Still, "the outlook is positive"
for women, she said.
Another evolving mindset
Lougee said she has witnessed is
Stanford students' interest in
"defining the character of the in
stitution." Upon her arrival in
1973, the University was experi
encing what she called "a very
difficult period for Stanford."
During the decade that followed,
she said, there was "much less
apparent student interest [ in cur
rent issues. It was ] a very quiet
time in terms of student voices,"
she said.
She said she now "sees some
what of a return" to the more vo
cal days of the past. "I'm very
pleased to see students better en
gaged now," she said.
"Students know a lot about
what they need. . . . We've gone
through a long period of student
passivity. In about the last two
years the students have been
much more involved in thinking
on issues like divestment and
Western Culture," she said.
Understandably, the current
Western Culture debate holds
special interest for Lougee. Prior
to her appointment as dean (in
1982), she was the head of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies that initially recom
mended the creation of the West
ern Culture requirement in 1980.
She said she "was there carrying
the ball in the institution of the
requirement."
Presently a member of the

Western Culture Task Force,
Lougee said she "would like to
see the Area One requirement
broader than the West because I
think freshman have almost al
ways relatively narrow experi
ence from their own vantage
point."
She called the recent task force
report "a very good beginning."
If the recommendations of the
task force are adopted, she said,
"I think we'll see some very in
teresting courses."
Lougee said that when she
returns to teaching next year she
would like to again teach a West
ern Culture course. During her
tenure as dean, Lougee fre
quently taught one quarter of the
History track of Western Cul
ture.
She said she views her return
from administration to the class
room as a transition from
"making differences in a big
way" to making differences that
are "often less readily appar
ent."
"The difference you make (in
administration) isn't necessarily
more important, but it is more
visible," she explained. "I do
think teaching is unquestionably
an activity in which you make a
difference. That's where the
satisfactions in teaching come
from."
Lougee said she is satisfied
with her life on sabbatical be
cause it allows her more time
with her family. "I'm not spend
ing 24 hours a day on my scholar
ship," she explained. "I also
have some personal things that I
haven't been able to do for five
years that I'm doing now."

With six vears as dean of Undergraduate Studies behind her, Carolyn
Lougee plans to take a year's sabbatical and then return to teaching in
the History Department.
"This year I've really cut
myself off," Carolyn Lougee
said, surrounded by the volumes
of books that adorn the walls of
her History Department office.
After having served six years
as Stanford's dean of Undergrad
uate Studies, Lougee has em
barked upon a year-long sabbati
cal and is looking forward to re
turning to her "real professional
responsibilities" of teaching and
research.
"My job is as a member of the
faculty who was temporarily
doing some administrative
work," she said of her work as
dean.
Her two three-year terms as

dean have produced changes at
Stanford that in all likelihood will
be anything but temporary. One
of Lougee's major projects was
overseeing the evolution of the
University's Western Culture
program, an innovation she in
spired in 1980 prior to her ap
pointment as dean.
She also directed development
of the freshman writing program
and was instrumental in reor
ganizing the Center for Teaching
and Learning, the Innovative Ac
ademic Courses program and the
office of Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities.
Upon announcing her resigna
tion last spring, Lougee said she
"felt a little reluctant," but knew
it was time to return to her schol

arship. She said her decision was
made more difficult by the fact
that one of the undergraduate
programs she helped develop —
the Western Culture program —
was in the midst of substantial
change.
"It's a wonderful time to be in
volved with undergraduate edu
cation at Stanford because we
have a very good sense now of
where we want to go," she said.
"It was very exciting to oversee
that conceptual phase (of innova
tions), and it will be exciting for
my successor who gets to take
the implementation from the first
stages along to something more
permanent.
Philosophy Prof. Thomas
Wasow replaced Lougee as dean

of Undergraduate Studies this
summer.
During this sabbatical year,
Lougee said, her mind is not on
administrative matters. She
spends most of her time at Stan
ford's Center for Advanced
Study, where 40 scholars from
across the country convene to do
research and exchange ideas.
"I'm up there (at the Center
for Advanced Study) and not
thinking too much about the
progress of things I set in place,"
she said. "I'm not feeling left
out. When I come back (to teach
ing) next year and I'm here and
I'm living in it again, it may be
harder."
During her sabbatical, Lougee
said her main task has been to
complete her second book,
which she began in 1976. "I have
done virtually all of the re
search," she said. "I found when
I was dean 1 did not have time to
write."
The book is a case study of
Saint-Cyr, a French Catholic
boarding school for girls founded
in 1586 and closed during the
Revolution in 1792. Lougee said
she is trying to relate "the exper
ience of going to school in the
18th century — what it was like,
what one learned, how one
learned, what the classroom was
like, what the dynamics of the
classroom were, the dynamics
between the teacher and pupil."
Lougee said Saint-Cyr is a
very well-known and well
documented school, but
"nobody's really studied it
closely."
Over this past summer Lougee
also completed the software for a
computer simulation of life in
17th-century France. The game
draws upon the work of her first
book, published in 1976, in which
she examined the social
structures and social mobility of
17th-century Paris.
In the computer simulation,
the user logs on as a 30-year-old
bourgeois male in 1638 with "a
little money and a little land,"
who must survive the conse
quences of decisions he makes
about investing in land and
bonds, operating fields, and get
ting married and having children.
More often than not, the user
goes bankrupt or is hung by a

popular uprising, Lougee said.
The concept of the game arose,
Lougee said, from "thinking
about whether there might be
some way of interesting students
in history by using the computer,
because certain students are in
terested in history and certain
others you really have to grab

them by the collar and pull them
in."
The simulation is "just starting
to get quite well-known,"
Lougee said. She recently won
first place for software in a com
petition sponsored by the Na
tional Center for Research to Im
prove Postsecondary Teaching

and Learning, and over the sum
mer received second place in Ap
ple Computer's "Wheels for the
Mind Awards" contest.
Her interest in computers goes
back a number of years. Lougee
said that when she first came to
Stanford in 1973, she was "the
first faculty member in the de
partment to offer a course on
using the computer in historical
research."
She was also the first woman
ever hired by the department.
Her hiring, she said, came after
"a kind of mini-revolt by the
graduate students in the depart
ment who were tired of the fac
ulty hiring man after man after
man." She contends she was
"very-well treated" by her new
colleagues. "The department
decided to give me a real shot,"
she said, "to give me a real
chance."
"1 felt 1 had a big responsibility
to future hiring of women ... I
really felt that 1 had to succeed;
because if I didn't, it was going to
set the cause of women faculty
back, and that I found a heavy
burden to carry."
In retrospect, the burden may
not have been as great as she
thought.
"1 probably exaggerated that
feeling, but nonetheless I had
[ it ]," she said, adding that
"things have worked out for
me."
