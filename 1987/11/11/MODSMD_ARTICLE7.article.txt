# Controversial prof. plans campus visit
## Bell critical of Law School policies 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
A former visiting professor
who claims he was snubbed by
the Law School in 1986 said
Monday he hopes his upcom
ing campus appearance will
direct current discussion of
discrimination at the Law
School toward affirmative ac
tion in minority faculty
recruitment.
Harvard Law Prof. Derrick
Bell, a 57-year-old scholar
noted for his radical interpre
tation of the Constitution as a
"racist document," will ap
pear at Stanford Nov. 20 at the
invitation of Law School stu
dents and faculty to speak
about his book, "And We Are
Not Saved," which he de
scribed as "a review of the
status of civil rights in
America."
Bell, who is black, said that
in the spring of 1986 he
endured "the worst moment
of my professional life" when
his basic course on constitu
tional law was allegedly under
cut by a series of "enrichment
lectures."
According to Bell, the alter
native lectures were organized
by students and faculty who
objected to a text Bell had co
authored with then-Law Prof.

Paul Brest that emphasized
the role of race and slavery in
the formulation of the Consti
tution. Brest is now dean of
the Law School.
Bell credited a public
protest by the Black Law Stu
dent Association for cutting
the series short.
Bell said that although he
has since received many
private apologies about the in
cident from students and fac
ulty, he has not received a
"public apology" from Law
School officials.
Bell said he hopes his ap
pearance at Stanford will
"help turn bad things into op
portunities."
Bell said he was enthusiastic
about recent student proposals
aimed at bolstering the Law
School's affirmative action
policy in minority hiring.
"Students are the main
force for change," Bell said.
"1 would applaud vocally, and
(Law School) Dean Brest
would applaud quietly such a
move. 1 think all the major law
schools are deficient, Stanford
more than most others."
Brest declined to comment
on possible changes in the
Law School's affirmative ac
tion program, except to say
