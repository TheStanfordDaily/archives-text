Reagan comment slops dollar's fall
WASHINGTON — President Reagan declared yesterday that
he does not want the slumping dollar to fall further, a comment
that helped brake the dollar's slide in currency markets but only
briefly interrupted a day of falling stock prices on Wall Street.
"We re not doing anything to bring it down," Reagan told
reporters at the start of a meeting with visiting Israeli President
Chaim Herzog. "I don't look for a further decline, don't want a
further decline from where it is right now."
Earlier, the White House moved to disavow a report in The
New York Times that quoted unnamed officials as saying that
the Reagan administration welcomed a continued weakening in
the dollar.
Officials have made it clear since the Wall Street crash last
month that they are opposed for now to propping up the dollar
with higher interest rates out of fear that any such move runs the
risk of causing a serious recession. The conflicting positions on
the dollar reflect internal feuding within the administration over
what should happen next.
Treasury Secretary James Baker 111, the administration's
chief economic policy maker, still appears interested in attempt
ing to stabilize the dollar at some future point.
Democrats present reduction plan
WASHINGTON — Congressional Democrats involved in
high-level budget talks with the Reagan administration yester
day offered a plan to reduce the fiscal 1988 federal deficit by
$33.8 billion that appears to have propelled the discussions
toward a critical juncture today.
Although House and Senate Republicans greeted the Demo
cratic proposal warily, arguing that it calls for too large a tax in
crease and not enough cuts in domestic spending, they said it
also established an important marker that could quickly lead to a
bipartisan agreement on an overall framework.
"Instead of talking about $6 billion in differences, we are
talking about a billion or 2 billion in differences," said Rep.
Trent Lott (R-Miss.), the House Republican whip.
An administration official familiar with the talks said the two
sides are "getting very close." White House officials said Presi
dent Reagan could use a speech tomorrow to the Chamber of
Commerce to announce an agreement if one is reached by then.
Introduced on the 12th day of the budget summit that was
convened in the wake of the Oct. 19 stock market collapse, the
Democratic proposal calls for a $ 12-billion tax increase, roughly
the amount included in separate tax bills that have passed the
House and been approved by the Senate Finance Committee.
Government releases airline data
WASHINGTON — American Airlines had the best on-time
performance of any major U.S. airline and USAir had the worst,
but Delta Air Lines had the largest number of chronically late
flights during September, according to the Department of Trans
portation's first shopper's guide to airline performance.
Even excluding flights delayed for mechanical reasons, nearly
a quarter of all non-stop flights were at least 15 minutes late
during September, according to the agency. The statistics indi
cate that airlines are improving their performance record, which
was threatening to touch off passenger revolts earlier this year.
The detailed report on airline performance, which the agency
released yesterday, measures on-time performance in several
ways, including by airport and by hour, and reporting on
baggage handling and over-booking.
The new reports — required by a new disclosure rule issued in
September— will help consumers select the best flight for their
circumstances. Later this year, data on on-time performance for
individual flights will be available to passengers through travel
agents and at ticket counters. This information will allow con
sumers to select airlines according to their performances, the
agency said.
For instance, a passenger confronted with a choice between
two airlines with convenient schedules and similar prices could
ask for on-time information. If one airline's performance was
coded "8," indicating an on-time arrival record of between 80
and 89.9 percent for the previous month, the consumer might
want to select that airline over another that was coded "5" for
on-time performance of between 50 and 59.9 percent.
House backs uniform poll closing
WASHINGTON — The House, on a 208-189 vote, approved
legislation yesterday that would set a uniform time under which
all polls in the continental United States would close simultane
ously on presidential election days.
The bill, which was backed primarily by lawmakers from
Western states, seeks to prevent a repeat of the 1980 election, in
which television networks projected President Reagan the win
ner during what was the afternoon on the Pacific Coast, before
many Westerners had a chance to vote.
Some have charged that that discouraged Western voters
from going to the polls and may have influenced thf vote margin
of the election, as well as the results of local contests.
The bill would require all polls in the continental United
States to close at 9 p.m. EST. Daylight savings time would be
extended by two weeks in the Pacific time zone only, which
means that its polls would close at 7 p.m. local time.
An almost identical bill passed the House in January 1986
only to die when the Senate failed to act. The current bill again
faces an uncertain fate in the Senate. The Reagan administration
has raised no objections to the measure.
Poll finds Westerners more tolerant
People who live along the Pacific Coast tend to be less reli
gious, less anti-communist and less alienated from the political
system than most other Americans, according to a recent Gallup
poll.
Pacific people are more tolerant of different life styles, views
and values, the survey found. For example, they are more
opposed to making it tougher to get an abortion.
They also are more opposed than the rest of the country to
loosening environmental controls in order to spur economic
growth, more in favor of cutting the military budget and more in
clined to think that the United States is too inflexible in dealing
with the Soviet Union.
On the other hand, the poll showed, people near the Pacific
tend to be in the American mainstream of opinion when it comes
to wanting more government money for public schools (70 per
cent do), favoring the death penalty (72 percent), opposing U.S.
aid for the contra rebels fighting the Nicaragua Marxists (58 per
cent) and objecting to a tax increase to reduce the federal budget
deficit (67 percent).
"Differences in political values within the Pacific region are
consistent with the popular perception of the laid-back Califor
nians," the Gallup Organization commented in its analysis of
the survey results. "The population rates low on religiousness
and high on tolerance."
