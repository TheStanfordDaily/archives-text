# College poll: 54% undecided on '88 race
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Students polled at eight of the nation's top col
leges overwhelmingly favor legal abortion, oppose
aiding the Nicaraguan contras, are uncertain about
whether they support U.S. policy in the Persian
Gulf and have not yet decided whom they support
for president in 1988.
In a poll conducted last week by student
newspapers at Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, Yale,
Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth and the
University of Pennsylvania, 31 percent of the 2576
students surveyed — including 305 at Stanford —
said the economy was the most important issue
facing the nation today.
Nearly 21 percent said U.S.-Soviet relations are
of paramount importance, while 14 percent said
AIDS was the most important issue. Tne poll had a
statistical sampling error of plus or minus 5 per
cent.
In order of number of responses, students then
cited education, civil rights, U.S. Central Ameri
can policy and terrorism as the issue of greatest
concern. Roughly 10 percent chose something
other than the seven issues on the list.
Even though a plurality of students said the eco
nomy was the most important issue facing the
country, most said they were optimistic about the
country's economic future and about their job
prospects. Over 62 percent felt the economic out
look was bright, while only 22 percent said it was
gloomy. The remaining 16 percent were undecided.
President Reagan did not fare well in the survey.
Over 43 percent of those surveyed said he is doing
a satisfactory job, while 40 percent said his per
formance has been unsatisfactory.
Six percent of the students rated Reagan as
"excellent;" 11 percent said the president should
resign.
Over 80 percent of the students polled said they
believed abortion should be legal, while 13 percent
opposed abortion, and 6 percent were undecided.
Contra aid was opposed by 56 percent of those
surveyed. Twenty-three percent said they were
unsure on the issue, and 21 percent said they sup
ported aid.
There appeared to be no consensus on the issue
of U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf. Nearly 38
percent said they supported the
current U.S. policy in the Gulf,
while 33 percent opposed it and
29 percent were undecided.
With the next election less
than a year away, most students
did not yet support any of the
candidates for the presidency.
Over 53 nercent said they were
undecided.
Of the declared candidates,
Massachusetts Governor Mi
chael Dukakis (D-Mass.) had the
most support, tallying 13 per
cent. Senator Robert Dole (R-
Kan.) was second with the sup
port of almost 8 percent of there

spondents. Vice President
George Bush trailed Dole by one
percentage point.
None of the other candidates
could claim the support of even 5
percent of those surveyed. Sen.
Paul Simon (D-III.) and Rev.
Jesse Jackson both were cited by
just under 4 percent of the stu
dents.
Dukakis' support may be due,
in part, to the regional bias of the
poll. Nearly all of the colleges in
the survey are located in New
England, where Dukakis enjoys
higner name recongition and
popularity.
The poll pointed out that stu
dents tend to be liberal on a num
ber of issues. The stances sup
porting the legality of abortion,
opposing contra aid and opposing

a peacetime draft — by a 71 per
cent to 15 percent margin — are
all to the left on the political
spectrum.
The lack of consensus on the
Persian Gulf issue seemed to mir
ror the feelings of Congress and
the country at large.
The survey also revealed that
over 67 percent of students ques
tioned had never participated in a
political protest.
Responses at Stanford tended
to closely reflect those of the
entire survey group. Stanford
students were somewhat less op
timistic than their Ivy League
counterparts about the future of
the economy and tended to be
slightly more sympathetic to the
contras.

the country at large.
The survey also revealed that
over 67 percent of students ques
tioned had never participated in a
political protest.
Responses at Stanford tended
to closely reflect those of the
entire survey group. Stanford
students were somewhat less op
timistic than their Ivy League
counterparts about the future of
the economy and tended to be
slightly more sympathetic to the
contras.

Students polled at eight of the nation's top col
leges overwhelmingly favor legal abortion, oppose
aiding the Nicaraguan contras, are uncertain about
whether they support U.S. policy in the Persian
Gulf and have not yet decided whom they support
for president in 1988.
In a poll conducted last week by student
newspapers at Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, Yale,
Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth and the
University of Pennsylvania, 31 percent of the 2576
students surveyed — including 305 at Stanford —
said the economy was the most important issue
facing the nation today.
Nearly 21 percent said U.S.-Soviet relations are
of paramount importance, while 14 percent said
AIDS was the most important issue. Tne poll had a
statistical sampling error of plus or minus 5 per
cent.
In order of number of responses, students then
cited education, civil rights, U.S. Central Ameri
can policy and terrorism as the issue of greatest
concern. Roughly 10 percent chose something
other than the seven issues on the list.
Even though a plurality of students said the eco
nomy was the most important issue facing the
country, most said they were optimistic about the
country's economic future and about their job
prospects. Over 62 percent felt the economic out
look was bright, while only 22 percent said it was
gloomy. The remaining 16 percent were undecided.
President Reagan did not fare well in the survey.
Over 43 percent of those surveyed said he is doing
a satisfactory job, while 40 percent said his per
formance has been unsatisfactory.
Six percent of the students rated Reagan as
"excellent;" 11 percent said the president should
resign.
Over 80 percent of the students polled said they
believed abortion should be legal, while 13 percent
opposed abortion, and 6 percent were undecided.
Contra aid was opposed by 56 percent of those
surveyed. Twenty-three percent said they were
unsure on the issue, and 21 percent said they sup
ported aid.
There appeared to be no consensus on the issue
of U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf. Nearly 38
percent said they supported the
current U.S. policy in the Gulf,
while 33 percent opposed it and
29 percent were undecided.
With the next election less
than a year away, most students
did not yet support any of the
candidates for the presidency.
Over 53 nercent said they were
undecided.
Of the declared candidates,
Massachusetts Governor Mi
chael Dukakis (D-Mass.) had the
most support, tallying 13 per
cent. Senator Robert Dole (R-
Kan.) was second with the sup
port of almost 8 percent of there

spondents. Vice President
George Bush trailed Dole by one
percentage point.
None of the other candidates
could claim the support of even 5
percent of those surveyed. Sen.
Paul Simon (D-III.) and Rev.
Jesse Jackson both were cited by
just under 4 percent of the stu
dents.
Dukakis' support may be due,
in part, to the regional bias of the
poll. Nearly all of the colleges in
the survey are located in New
England, where Dukakis enjoys
higner name recongition and
popularity.
The poll pointed out that stu
dents tend to be liberal on a num
ber of issues. The stances sup
porting the legality of abortion,
opposing contra aid and opposing

a peacetime draft — by a 71 per
cent to 15 percent margin — are
all to the left on the political
spectrum.
The lack of consensus on the
Persian Gulf issue seemed to mir
ror the feelings of Congress and
the country at large.
The survey also revealed that
over 67 percent of students ques
tioned had never participated in a
political protest.
Responses at Stanford tended
to closely reflect those of the
entire survey group. Stanford
students were somewhat less op
