# Ortega demands direct talks

### 
WASHINGTON — Niearaguan President
Daniel Ortega, blasting U.S. "terrorism in
Central America" to an audience just two
blocks from the White House, demanded yes
terday that President Reagan begin direct
talks with his Sandinista government "so that
we may find the manner in which to nor
malize our relations."
In an hour-long speech to the Organization
of American States' (OAS) annual General
Assembly, Ortega accused Reagan of reneg
ing on a pledge to conduct direct talks once
Nicaragua begins cease-fire negotiations with
U.S.-backed contra rebel leaders.
Administration officials called Ortega's
proposal "a step backwards," and rejected it
outright. On Monday, Reagan had proposed
regional talks among the United States,
Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador,
Guatemala and Costa Rica once "serious"
cease-fire discussions between the Sandinis
tas and contras are under way.
Shortly after Ortega's address, two mem
bers of the contras' political leadership said
they expect indirect talks with the Sandinista
regime to begin within a week and to last at
least two months.
Contra leaders Alfonso Robelo and Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro said that the rebels'
negotiating commission plans to meet with
the likely intermediary in the talks,
Niearaguan Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo.
Ortega's speech in the ornate, drafty OAS
hall kicked off a day of diplomatic back-and
forth over the shaky peace process that
generated some publicity, but little visible

progress.
The Niearaguan leader met for about 90
minutes with House Speaker Jim Wright (D-
Texas), the most prominent supporter of the
peace agreement in Congress, but neither
would comment on the substance of the talks.
Sandinista officials asked Wright last week to
serve as an intermediary in the talks, but he
declined.
The contras' six-member political direc
torate, all exiled from Nicaragua, gathered in
the OAS hall to hear Ortega's speech but did
not speak to him or other Niearaguan offi
cials. Robelo said that he will meet with
Wright later this week and that other contra
leaders plan to meet with South American
diplomats at the OAS session to solicit sup
port for their cause.
Ortega, shunning his customary military
fatigues for a gray business suit, appeared to
take little note of generally conciliatory
speeches delivered to the OAS foreign minis
ters Monday and Tuesday by Reagan and
Secretary of State George Shultz. Instead, he
delivered an off-the-cuff address largely
devoid of political passion and heavy with
readings from international lawbooks.
He repeated earlier pledges to comply "100
percent" with the provisions of the peace
pact signed by Nicaragua and its neighbors
last August, which calls for a general am
nesty, democratic political reforms, a halt to
outside aid to guerrilla forces and an end to
states of emergency.
The Sandinistas so far have released 981 of
the nation's 6500 or more political prisoners
and restored some political rights to citizens.

But they have balked at lifting a state of
emergency or making other complete reforms
until its neighbors have fully complied with
the peace terms and the contra war has
ended.
Yesterday, Ortega charged that American
meddling in the peace process and
Nicaraguan affairs has kept the Sandinista
regime from abiding fully by the peace ac
cord. Nearly half his speech was devoted to
reciting a 1986 International Court of Justice
ruling, in which the United States was found
to have illegally mined Nicaraguan harbors,
to support his argument.
Ortega accused the White House of waging
a "terrorist war" against him, financing 140
aerial resupply missions to contra forces
inside Nicaragua since the signing of the
peace accord and making 1740 reconnais
sance flights over the nation since Reagan
took office.
"Nicaragua wants to make it a matter of
record that it is its will, its firm will, to com
ply with these agreements," he said. "But we
are facing the colossus — the colossus that,
when a colossus makes a mistake, his errors
are colossal also."
Ortega called for the International Com
mission on Verification and Follow-Up, the
body assigned to monitor the peace plan, to
begin on-the-spot checks of compliance with
the peace pact "as soon as possible." He im
plied that inspectors will find that
Nicaragua's neighbors are harboring U.S.-
built camps for contra rebels in defiance of
the accord.
