# Today in White Plaza
## Contraceptive shop makes its debut 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Contraceptives will be sold in White Plaza today
and every remaining Thursday this quarter in an ef
fort by the Stanford AIDS Education Project to
promote safer sex habits among students.
Setting up alongside booths selling flowers, T
shirts and jewelry, the project's "Safer Sex
Shoppe" will offer a variety of contraceptives at
low cost.
The purpose of the service is "to provide the
community with a place to purchase safer sex
supplies," said senior Daniel Bao, coordinator of
the project.
The booth will sell a wide variety of wares, from
the Gold Circle and exotic pink Yamabuki con
doms — the winners in last year's campus-wide
condom-rating contest — to water-based
lubricants, rubber gloves and chocolate-flavored
dental dams.
Noting that the products will be sold at cost, Bao
said he hopes the shop will be "semi-self
supporting." The ASSU last year provided the
AIDS Education Project with partial, short-term
funding to help it to get started, Bao said.
Bao said the staff at the shop will be experts on
the supplies they offer, capable of giving advice
"on the touch, feel and taste of each item."
Initial student reaction to the project appears to
be positive. Sophomore Daniel Vatanaviggun said,
"It reflects a mature attitude towards sex."
Irene Wu, a sophomore, agreed. "I think it's a
healthy idea, and people should be encouraged to
take advantage of this service," she said.
According to a survey conducted by Cowell Stu
dent Health Center last year, about two-thirds of
the student body at Stanford is sexually active,
while about one-fifth admitted they did not use con
traception every time they engaged in sexual inter
course.
The Safer Sex Shoppe will be open Thursdays
between 11 a.m. and I p.m. On Wednesdays the
Shoppe will be open at the Old Firehouse from 9
p.m. to 12 a.m.
