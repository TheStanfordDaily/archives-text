# Voters to determine fees, election dates
## Two amendments make next week's ballot 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate decided in a spe
cial meeting yesterday to place two
constitutional amendments on the bal
lot of next week's all-campus special
election.
If approved by students, one amend
ment would provide for the collection
of "capital fees," according to Council
of Presidents member Leonard Adler.
Adler said this refundable fee of $1 or
$2 per student would allow the ASSU to
fund major improvement projects, such
as renovating the Old Firehouse or
rebuilding the Boathouse, over a num
ber of years.
"The ASSU just can't divide up
$1(X),(XH) (the operating budget) every
year to make renovations," Adler said.
If an organization were to request
capital fees from the ASSU, students
would decide in a general election
whether the project should be funded.
The fees would "expand the scope of
things that can be done," according to
COP member Jim Durkin.
Similar amendments seeking to give
the ASSU the power to collect capital
fees have been defeated in student elec
tions the past two years.
The second amendment on next
week's ballot aims to increase the
flexibility of spring quarter ASSU gen
eral elections by allowing balloting to
be scheduled within a four-week period
instead of the current two.

Some students last spring objected to
election scheduling that conflicted with
Easter and Passover.
" This (amendment) should avoid the
religious conflicts of last year," Durkin
said.
Adler and Durkin sought to place
four amendments on the ballot, but the
senate approved only two.
The senate refused to include an
amendment creating an activity fee that
would pay for such activities as all
campus parties. The senate also voted
down inclusion of an amendment re
quiring ASSU officer training.
Durkin, an author of the officer train
ing amendment, said, "It's something
that should be done (to avoidl a lot of
inefficiency. 1 think everyone should
agree that it's positive."
Durkin expressed frustration at the
senate's decision not to include the two
amendments.
"This is insane," he said. "They're
blocking the (rightl of students to
vote."
In addition to deciding the fate of the
two constitutional amendments placed
on the ballot yesterday, students who
vote in the election next Tuesday and
Wednesday will also elect three student
representatives to the Student Conduct
Legislative Council and will elect stu
dents to fill 13 vacant graduate seats in
the senate.
The ASSU's election handbook will
be printed in The Daily Monday, Nov.
16.
