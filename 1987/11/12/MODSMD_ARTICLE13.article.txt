## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Two prongs of racism 
### 
Beginning tonight and continuing through
Sunday, Stanford students have the opportunity
to attend the fifth annual "You Can Make a Dif
ference" conference. The topic of this year's
conference is institutional racism.
All students should consider attending the free
event: As something that every person at Stan
ford will encounter either here or later in their
lives, institutional racism is a subject that
demands thoughtful consideration.
Institutional racism is defined by conference
organizers as "the assumptions and practices of
institutions that reinforce and perpetuate the
subjugation of people singled out by their race
and cultural heritage."
No doubt many institutions are guilty of the
kind of conduct outlined in that definition. And
the kind of racism that will be discussed at this
weekend's forum is not confined to large institu
tions like universities, states and nations. It is of
ten just is common and virulent in smaller insti
tutions: clubs, fraternities or sororities, even
dormitories.
Two things should be kept in mind in any ex
amination of institutional racism. The first is that
although some harmful attitudes and actions
may he condoned as "institutionalized," ulti
mately the responsibility for racism or other
forms of social injustice on the part of an institu
tion falls upon the individuals who make up the
institution.
A second consideration is that any attempt to
fight institutional racism must be two-pronged:
It must include some effort by the institution in
question to reform the attitudes or policies that
make it racist or discriminatory: and it must also
include an effort by the group being discrimi
nated against to insist on fairer treatment by the
institution.
A good and close-to-home case study of the
need for a two-way effort in fighting institutional

racism is The Daily itself. For ye; j rs The Daily,
because it has a staff that is mostly white, has
been accused of being a racist institution.
Regardless of the racial views of individuals
on The Daily staff, the institution has nonethe
less been viewed as discriminatory because of
the composition of that staff.
Repeated efforts by The Daily to recruit
minorities for its staff and for its editorial board
have met with little success. This year, openings
on the paper's editorial board were advertised
for over a week. No representatives of any
minority communities at Stanford, and only one
woman, submitted sample editorials and came to
the grill session for editorial board candidates.
Perhaps The Daily needs to step up efforts to
invite minorities into its staff. But when The
Daily, or any other institution, makes a good
faith effort to open its doors to minorities only to
have members of those minority groups keep
their distance because of some perceived dis
crimination, institutional racism becomes a self
fulfilling prophecy.
A good-faith effort is required of both sides in
such situations; one is really useless without the
other. It takes effort for institutions to change
established ways, and it takes effort and courage
for individuals to challenge the established ways
of institutions.
The success of efforts to fight insitutional rac
ism at Stanford and in the United States will
depend on the bilateral resolve of individuals,
both inside and outside flawed institutions, to
demand that those institutions make necessary
and long-overdue changes in their structures.
Hopefully, this weekend's forum will raise
awareness of the problems and the prevalence of
instititutional racism and will provide some im
petus for students to take an active role in what
the conference publicity pamphlet aptly calls
"the struggle for change."
