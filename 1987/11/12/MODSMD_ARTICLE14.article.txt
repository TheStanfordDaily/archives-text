Don't take away
Western Culture

1 am writing because 1 am
grateful for having taken Western
Culture and feel we should take a
look at what will be lost before
we take it away from future stu
dents.
It must be frustrating for
minority students to study
mainly authors that they cannot
identify with ethnically; perhaps
this alone is sufficient reason for
change.
On the other hand, to complain
about studying only "white
male" authors is a little akin to
complaining about studying only
"white male" presidents. We
could study thinkers like Con
fucius, but I doubt even the most
ardent Western Culture-bashers
would argue that Confucius has
had even a minute fraction of the
influence on American society
that Aristotle has. Consider that
our whole educational system is
Aristotelian. Surely the propo
nents of "democracy in educa
tion" understand the relevance
of this fact.
As we move forward in time,
things change. Undoubtedly,
civil rights leaders such as Martin

Luther King Jr. have had a tre
mendous influence on American
culture: any course dealing with
important American figures
would be stupid to leave them
out. As it stands, however, West
ern Culture deals almost entirely
with thinkers who lived before
the United States was founded.
Perhaps opponents of the pro
gram really want to "modernize"
it. If so, let's deal with the issue
in these terms.
In discussing these issues let
us remember that the best solu
tion is the one that makes the
most sense educationally, not the
one that makes the most people
happy.

Conference will
confront issues
of racism openly

This year's "You Can Make a
Difference"' conference contin
ues a Stanford tradition of con
fronting hard issues head on. The
conference, titled "Institutional
Racism: The Struggle for
Change," plans to explore the

issue of racism in a sensitive hut
concrete manner.
The student-generated idea for
the conference predates recent
demands from minority commu
nities. However, the tensions
that gave rise to those sentiments
have long been of concern to me,
as well as to the conference or
ganizers. The question of racism
must he addressed openly and
honestly if Stanford is to deal
with the problem successfully.
Stanford is a great university
with a diverse student body. We
have a responsibility to serve as a
model for other institutions in so
ciety. Part of our responsibility in
that role is serving the needs of
all our students. This conference
seeks to deal with student con
cerns about racial issues on
campus.
I urge all members of the Stan
ford community to participate in
the conference, which begins
Thursday with a panel discussion
and ends Sunday with a sermon
on making a difference on rac
ism.
I challenge all in this commu
nity to help Stanford reach its full
potential as an institution that
honors, respects and is educated
by its diversity.
