# When Mom's not around
## 
### 
I don't suppose anyone wants to hear how I suf
fered a touch of influenza last week.
I don't really want to review the gory details
either; living them was quite enough — though I
don't want my roommate reading this and scream
ing, "A touch? You say you hau a touch of some
thing last week?!" I'll give her this much: It was
the usual "can't swallow because the throat hurts,
can't walk because the floor spins, can't leave the
room because life is meaningless and can't sleep
with the covers on or off."

everyone experiences a malady at some point in
his or her Stanford career and goes through not
only the sickness, but also the guilt at falling be
hind. And everyone realizes with a particular
poignancy that Mom is no longer around to write
the excuse note; the hovering parental presence is
no longer hovering to tell you that everything will
be all right and to give you round figures as to
recovery time.
It's scary. Sitting in bed alone, seeing the blue
sky outside and hearing the whir of spokes as the
world whizzes along to class without you, you
wonder if you'll ever get back into the real world;
and with the apathy of illness you wonder why
you'd even want to.
Share this feeling with those around you? — Aw,
you shouldn't, because we're all Big People now;
we can take care of ourselves; \ve have to. if we're
ever going to amount to anything. In preparation
for the Real World, we must be self-sufficient. 1
mean, we go to Stanford.
But just as I pick up the phone in the throes of
self-pity to whimper home to my parents "Hither
you jet out here and baby me, or I'm dropping
out," into my room troop my friends.
Mom and Dad are irreplaceable, but when the
going gets awful at school, there's nothing like your
friends and the dorm environment for a little salva
tion. This is dedicated to all the people who pulled
me through those days of misery — the people
who've convinced me that I don't want to get sick
anywhere else.
I'm crumpled into a sort of heap up in my loft on
about the second day of my illness, and my friend
Marin comes bounding in. "I'm here to make you
laugh!" she announces. She's got on these garish
blue, fuschia, purple and black sunglasses. "Where
in the world did you ..." I croak. "Safeway, 4
a.m.," she explains. I'm semi-delirious at this
point, so anything makes sense. But she removes
the glasses, looks at me and produces this very
wise statement. "The thing about the dorm," she
says, "is that people see you at your best and they
see you at your worst. And it's OK!"
I laugh to think how true this is — how in the
dorm women get to see men's boxers, and men get

to see women without the help of Maybelline. I
laugh to think of how in such a pristine state I must
have scared my friends Christine and Ron when
they appeared at the door with gifts of blanket and
cookies.
My hair, which had just been permed and then
slept on for entirely too long, was in some sort of
electrocuted bufont formation. My face was gray,
and the shadows under my eyes were blocking out
the light from the sun. They took one look at me
and guided me to the bathroom for the first shower
of my illness.
I managed to black out in the shower (not so
glamorous as 1 used to imagine fainting might be),
and in rushes Nancy, my roommate. "Oh God, I
knew this was going to happen!" she says and
bundles me up and hustles me back to the room.
Thanks, Mom. She calls her dad (the doctor) for
advice on my care, since Cowell's solution seemed
to her to be no more than the force-feeding of
drugs. I feel quite loved.
My friend Ken survived a ticket for parking in
front of Cowell and brought me, among assorted
treasures, Billy Tea from Australia. My friend Jen
nifer sat with me as I rasped out my woes and fed
me French bread imported from Oregon. My friend
Ric, dormmate from last year, made the impossible
trek from Wilbur to Governor's Corner for a visit
with carnations. And people in the dorm whom I
don't see quite as often stopped by and poked their
heads in to mark my progress. It's good to have
people show their concern, hear them say they un
derstand how dreary the whole business is and
hope that you'll pull out of it soon.
When illness hits me around here, 1 realize
there's something special about a place where
several people live together — the strides we make
as we're asked to deal with others, along with all
the moods and stresses we carry around ourselves.
The dorm is potentially explosive territory, with all
these little time bombs running around, ticking with
peeves and germs, waiting to set one another off.
But people learn quickly that you have to
manage living with other people whom you just
can't treat as casually (or badly) as you do your
family. And when people get sick it's easy enough
to hope they'll get better and go on with their own
lives, but the amazing fact is that most people don't
do this.
A lot of people pause to offer a little sympathy,
and whether it's stopping by someone's door and
asking, "How are you?" or fluffing pillows and ad
ministering the cold medicine, it's an important
part of dorm living, and it means a lot to the invalid.
I want to remember what these people have done
for me and do likewise for others when they're sick
— because human contact and concern are abso
lutely necessary for someone to survive the virus
blues. Friends put your life into perspective. You
realize that although midterms and grades and pres
sures of the future compete to take top priority in
your life, friends are the best concern and invest
ment. They're who really make you feel good, who
make your life worth living.
I get by with a little help from my friends.

Share this feeling with those around you? — Aw,
you shouldn't, because we're all Big People now;
we can take care of ourselves; \ve have to. if we're
ever going to amount to anything. In preparation
for the Real World, we must be self-sufficient. 1
mean, we go to Stanford.
But just as I pick up the phone in the throes of
self-pity to whimper home to my parents "Hither
you jet out here and baby me, or I'm dropping
out," into my room troop my friends.
Mom and Dad are irreplaceable, but when the
going gets awful at school, there's nothing like your
friends and the dorm environment for a little salva
tion. This is dedicated to all the people who pulled
me through those days of misery — the people
who've convinced me that I don't want to get sick
anywhere else.
I'm crumpled into a sort of heap up in my loft on
about the second day of my illness, and my friend
Marin comes bounding in. "I'm here to make you
laugh!" she announces. She's got on these garish
blue, fuschia, purple and black sunglasses. "Where
in the world did you ..." I croak. "Safeway, 4
a.m.," she explains. I'm semi-delirious at this
point, so anything makes sense. But she removes
the glasses, looks at me and produces this very
wise statement. "The thing about the dorm," she
says, "is that people see you at your best and they
see you at your worst. And it's OK!"
I laugh to think how true this is — how in the
dorm women get to see men's boxers, and men get

to see women without the help of Maybelline. I
laugh to think of how in such a pristine state I must
have scared my friends Christine and Ron when
they appeared at the door with gifts of blanket and
cookies.
My hair, which had just been permed and then
slept on for entirely too long, was in some sort of
electrocuted bufont formation. My face was gray,
and the shadows under my eyes were blocking out
the light from the sun. They took one look at me
and guided me to the bathroom for the first shower
of my illness.
I managed to black out in the shower (not so
glamorous as 1 used to imagine fainting might be),
and in rushes Nancy, my roommate. "Oh God, I
knew this was going to happen!" she says and
bundles me up and hustles me back to the room.
Thanks, Mom. She calls her dad (the doctor) for
advice on my care, since Cowell's solution seemed
to her to be no more than the force-feeding of
drugs. I feel quite loved.
My friend Ken survived a ticket for parking in
front of Cowell and brought me, among assorted
treasures, Billy Tea from Australia. My friend Jen
nifer sat with me as I rasped out my woes and fed
me French bread imported from Oregon. My friend
Ric, dormmate from last year, made the impossible
trek from Wilbur to Governor's Corner for a visit
with carnations. And people in the dorm whom I
don't see quite as often stopped by and poked their
heads in to mark my progress. It's good to have
people show their concern, hear them say they un
derstand how dreary the whole business is and
hope that you'll pull out of it soon.
When illness hits me around here, 1 realize
there's something special about a place where
several people live together — the strides we make
as we're asked to deal with others, along with all
the moods and stresses we carry around ourselves.
The dorm is potentially explosive territory, with all
these little time bombs running around, ticking with
peeves and germs, waiting to set one another off.
But people learn quickly that you have to
manage living with other people whom you just
can't treat as casually (or badly) as you do your
family. And when people get sick it's easy enough
to hope they'll get better and go on with their own
lives, but the amazing fact is that most people don't
do this.
A lot of people pause to offer a little sympathy,
and whether it's stopping by someone's door and
asking, "How are you?" or fluffing pillows and ad
ministering the cold medicine, it's an important
part of dorm living, and it means a lot to the invalid.
I want to remember what these people have done
for me and do likewise for others when they're sick
— because human contact and concern are abso
lutely necessary for someone to survive the virus
blues. Friends put your life into perspective. You
realize that although midterms and grades and pres
sures of the future compete to take top priority in
your life, friends are the best concern and invest
ment. They're who really make you feel good, who
make your life worth living.

I don't suppose anyone wants to hear how I suf
fered a touch of influenza last week.
I don't really want to review the gory details
either; living them was quite enough — though I
don't want my roommate reading this and scream
ing, "A touch? You say you hau a touch of some
thing last week?!" I'll give her this much: It was
the usual "can't swallow because the throat hurts,
can't walk because the floor spins, can't leave the
room because life is meaningless and can't sleep
with the covers on or off."

everyone experiences a malady at some point in
his or her Stanford career and goes through not
only the sickness, but also the guilt at falling be
hind. And everyone realizes with a particular
poignancy that Mom is no longer around to write
the excuse note; the hovering parental presence is
no longer hovering to tell you that everything will
be all right and to give you round figures as to
recovery time.
It's scary. Sitting in bed alone, seeing the blue
sky outside and hearing the whir of spokes as the
world whizzes along to class without you, you
wonder if you'll ever get back into the real world;
and with the apathy of illness you wonder why
you'd even want to.
Share this feeling with those around you? — Aw,
you shouldn't, because we're all Big People now;
we can take care of ourselves; \ve have to. if we're
