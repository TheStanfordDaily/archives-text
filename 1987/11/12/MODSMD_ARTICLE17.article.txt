## Utopia helps us escape ideology 
### 
Richard Ford's lunge at that space odyssey
well known to us as the great hike in the sky.
Star Trek, was witty and deft (Daily, Nov. 5).
Not only did he expand the topic with inter
esting political comments, but he also
succeeded in recovering a little philosophy
from the Western Culture archives.

But was it fair? He established a kind of
wrecking-ball dialectic between Utopia and
dis-utopia that allowed him to both celebrate
and condemn modern society. Celebration
because we need only rid ourselves of dog
matism and ideology to realize that
(unsought) "freedom from utopianism" â€”
condemnation that satisfies itself in the iden
tification of that elusive elixir: ideology.
That the capitalist ideology, which recently
attempted to assuage our fears of the Second
Coming from the pulpit of a press room (the
first was in October 1929), preaches the om
nipotence of some Taoist "invisible-hand"
economic force; this only contributes to
misunderstanding. It allows us to rest
patiently on our laurels while never address
ing properly the real issue at stake. Along
with goods, our system produces needs and
codes of conduct. Only in rare cases do we
actively determine our needs and pattern
work around them. It is as if social Dar
winism has, over time, drawn us into tighter

and tighter circles, each "advancement" ac
companied by an ideology we are unable to
see out of.
Ford would have us incriminate these
ideologies, and all ideology, as deceiving ar
guments. We have seen them distorted in
Iran, codified in the Soviet Union, freeze
dried in America and perverted in the Third
Reich. These are the imminent dis-utopias
Ford declares are (empirically?) "inexorably
wed" to their more appealing siblings. Inex
orably?

There is a difference between
ideology and Utopia, and were it
not for Utopia, we would have
no hope of eluding ideology.
The aesthetic Utopias we have
all treasured . . . during the
eternal moments of our dreams
are as universal as the practices
of art and music.

There is a difference between ideology and
Utopia, and were it not for Utopia, we would
have no hope of eluding ideology. The aes
thetic Utopias we have all treasured (though
perhaps fleetingly) during the eternal mo
ments of our dreams are as universal as the
practices of art and music.

All people and all cultures have their
Utopias. Some may be more selfless or
humanistic than others. Technological or
futuristic Utopias are more likely to be
daydreams, combinations of fantasy and ob
jective possibility.
What is at stake is determining the
qualitative difference between Utopia and ra
tionalized Utopia? Dis-utopia is sown in the
seeds of Utopian idealogy. In so doing, we
recognize the autonomous value of Utopia
and are freed to tackle the real problems en
demic to modern society.
To say that "it's comforting to know we're
all in good hands" (a reference to the stock
market crash) is to fashion falsity into truth.
Convicting the fictive dialectic of utopia/dis
utopia filters out historical catastrophies of
ideology.
It leaves us with the inescapable emptiness
we feel after the curtains close on a "no-exit"
nuclear holocaust film. We are left with a
dialectic (utopia/dis-utopia) that nullifies indi
vidual importance and defines us as im
potent. To believe that our hands are tied or
that we're disarmed and our limbs are manip
ulated by "Them"' is to fulfill the prophesy
we have just condemned.
It is in the dedication to our own autono
mous Utopian dreams that we work against
the contortion of Utopia into dis-utopia. Were
it not for the Utopias we know should exist
there would be no resistance to dis-utopia.
That is the imperative against ideology.
