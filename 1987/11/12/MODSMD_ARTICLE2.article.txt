# Forum warns abusers
## Prof, tells personal history of alcohol problems 
### Sean Kinch Staff writer 
Three experts on the consequences
of alcohol abuse — including English
Prof. Kenneth Fields, an admitted alco
holic — last night urged students to rec
ognize the potential dangers of alcohol.
At a forum in Kresge Auditorium,
Fields traced the history of his drinking
from its origins in college through
several broken relationships to his final
acceptance of the problem.
Despite many early warning signs.
Fields said that for over 20 years he
denied he had a problem. His anti
social behavior while drunk was an ex
ample of the signals he ignored, he said.
"I didn't drink socially, although 1
thought I did. And I heard a lot of
people say that I would drink socially

for the first 10 minutes of the party,"
Fields said.
The forum, sponsored by the Kappa
Alpha fraternity and the Interfraternity
Council, began with an introduction by
University President Donald Kennedy.
Kennedy praised the organizers for
helping to educate the community
about alcohol.
Kennedy also said the University will
continue to pursue a "moderate" alco
hol policy, one that is "primarily educa
tional and not regulatory." While
recognizing that "alcohol consumption
is a part of the pattern of contemporary
social culture," he said alcohol should
ideally "make its appearance as an ad
junct to, and not as a centerpiece for,
social functions.

Dr. Paul Walters, a psychia
trist at the Cowell Student Health
Center, said most students want
to know "how much is too
much" when drinking, which he
called a "blind approach to alco
hol."
Citing student surveys con
ducted by Cowell, Walters said
almost half of males at Stanford
drink one or two times a week,
and 18 percent drink more than
twice a week. He added that
females drink "almost as much."
Dr. Andrew Mecca, executive
director of the California Health
Research Foundation, focused

his presentation on the alcohol
and drug problems of America as
a whole. Mecca said that al
coholism represents "the worst
health epidemic in the history of
this nation."
Fields told the audience that to
get an alcoholic to face his prob
lem, one must not be judgmental.
Instead, he suggested offering
the alcoholic a list of possible
treatments.
He added that it is dangerous
to believe the myth that you can
not help an alcoholic until he is
ready to be helped.
Fields said most alcoholics
"would die before we are ready"
for help. Many alcoholics, he
said, "need a little nudge" from
someone to help them begin to
overcome alcoholism.
