### Sean Kinch Staff writer 
Three experts on the consequences
of alcohol abuse — including English
Prof. Kenneth Fields, an admitted alco
holic — last night urged students to rec
ognize the potential dangers of alcohol.
At a forum in Kresge Auditorium,
Fields traced the history of his drinking
from its origins in college through
several broken relationships to his final
acceptance of the problem.
Despite many early warning signs.
Fields said that for over 20 years he
denied he had a problem. His anti
social behavior while drunk was an ex
ample of the signals he ignored, he said.
"I didn't drink socially, although 1
thought I did. And I heard a lot of
people say that I would drink socially

for the first 10 minutes of the party,"
Fields said.
The forum, sponsored by the Kappa
Alpha fraternity and the Interfraternity
Council, began with an introduction by
University President Donald Kennedy.
Kennedy praised the organizers for
helping to educate the community
about alcohol.
Kennedy also said the University will
continue to pursue a "moderate" alco
hol policy, one that is "primarily educa
tional and not regulatory." While
recognizing that "alcohol consumption
is a part of the pattern of contemporary
social culture," he said alcohol should
ideally "make its appearance as an ad
junct to, and not as a centerpiece for,
social functions.
