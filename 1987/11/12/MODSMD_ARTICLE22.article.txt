## Conference seeks to educate and motivate Program studies issues of institutional racism 
### kimberly Loffer 
Organizers of this year's "You
Can Make a Difference" confer
ence, which begins today and
will continue through Sunday,
envision the event as an opportu
nity for members of the Univer
sity community to grapple with
the problem of institutional rac
ism at Stanford and at other edu
cational institutions.
The four-day conference, titled
"Institutional Racism: The
Struggle for Change," will
feature panel discussions and
workshops on subjects ranging
from race discrimination in the
criminal justice system to
shaping the future of East Palo
Alto. An ethnic food extrava
ganza is also included in the
schedule.
The largely student-run confer
ence, which is being coordinated
through the Public Service Cen
ter, has employed over 100 stu
dents since last spring. Approxi
mately 55 students, along with
University faculty and staff and
organizations such as the YWCA
will be working on the confer
ence this week.
The "You Can Make a Differ
ence" conference is an annual
project that in the past has dealt
with family and hunger issues.
The goal of the program is to
raise awareness of important so
cial issues and to inspire mem
bers of the Stanford community
to enter into public service
careers.
Charic Daniels, a third-year
law student, and Licia Dorosin, a
1987 graduate, are co
coordinators of this year's con
ference. Both have worked on
previous conferences.

The purpose of the conference,
as outlined by Daniels and
Dorosin, is "to identify, analyze
and discuss strategies to alleviate
institutional racism." The con
ference will focus on four racial
minorities "whose experiences
have oeen linked historically to
the development of the United
States." They are American In
dians, Asian-Americans, Afro-
Americans and Hispanics.

k Through our ignorance
we can be racist. We
have an individual and
collective responsibil
ity that once we learn
about this we are com
pelled to act on it.'
â€” Licia Dorosin,
conference coordinator

Organizers chose institutional
racism as this year's topic be
cause it seems to be on many
peoples' minds, Daniels said.
Daniels explained that "many
people were interested in this.
We wanted to address racism,
and we received a lot of positive
input on it."
The total cost of the project is
estimated to be $25,000, Daniels
said.
In the past, the majority of
people who attended the confer
ences were non-student members
of the community. This year,
Daniels said she expects the
majority of participants to be stu
dents because the topic of racism

applies directly to both Stanford
and its students.
Senior Carolyn Ginsberg, who
is in charge of publicity and
public relations for the confer
ence, said that organizers of the
event have been conducting
weekly meetings since last
spring.
Ginsberg said she has learned
much about the issues the confer
ence will address. "I've been ed
ucated on the issues of racism
and minority life. I have been
exposed to racial issues that I've
never really addressed before,
and it has been the students and
faculty that have educated me,"
she said.
She added that she hopes the
conference will "open up stu
dents' eyes to the struggles that
people of color still face in this
country."
"Every day that 1 work I
realize how important this issue
is," Dorosin said. "If I had not
become involved, I never would
have realized it. There is a big
difference between reading about
something and doing some
thing."
Dorosin added that she feels
there are not enough opportuni
ties for people to seriously dis
cuss and think about racism.
"If we don't understand rac
ism, then we will be perpetuating
it. Through our ignorance we can
be racist. We have an individual
and collective responsibility that
once we learn about this we are
compelled to act on it," she said.
Daniels said she hopes that
people will come away from the
conference with a greater aware
ness that racism is a problem,
and that they will strive to
change the status quo. "Part of

(the purpose of) the conference is
to make people realize that rac
ism is not just a personal issue,
but one which is perpetuated
through structures and institu
tions," she said.
"We don't hope to change the

individual, but instead, to change
the society and structures around
them," Daniels said.
"The conferences also are ed
ucational," Dorosin said, be
cause "they give the student a
chance to work on leadership

abilities, [and because they]
bring many aspects of the Uni
versity together."

tutional racism conference can

Service Center in Owen House.
