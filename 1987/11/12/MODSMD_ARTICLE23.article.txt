# Giardiasis infects backpackers, tourists
## Parasite threat to all

Along with the free/e-dried
food and a sleeping hag. make
sure to include a giardia filter on
your next backpacking trip to the
Sierras.
Although many people have
never heard of giardia or giar
diasis, it's a disease you should
be aware of if" you plan to do any
camping.

There is a particularly high in
cidence of giardiasis, an infection
caused by the giardia lamblia
parasite, which can be picked up
ny campers and backpackers in
the mountains of the Western
United States.
This parasite appears to be es
pecially prevalent in the Rocky
Mountains and the northern
Cascades and is the most com
mon pathogenic intestinal para
site in the United States. Once
thought only to occur in over
crowded regions with poor
sanitation or contaminated water
supplies, the giardia lamblia is
now the most frequent cause of
water-borne outbreaks of diar
rhea in developed countries.
Giardia is apparently acquired
through drinking water from
mountain streams contaminated
by feces from humans, dogs,
cats, rats, raccoons and other
species susceptible to infection
by the parasite.
Transmission of the infection
occurs by ingestion of cysts from
contaminated drinking water or
food. The cysts then multiply in

the upper small intestine and in
terfere with normal fat absorp
tion. The infection is then
diagnosed when cysts are found
in the feces.
To guard against contamina
tion. campers and backpackers
should filter all drinking water.
Because giardia cysts can
survive freezing temperatures,
even water from an icebank
should be filtered.
Fortunately for backpackers,
however, portable giardia water
filters are lightweight and usually
very efficient in screening out
even the smallest of microor
ganisms. These micropore filters
are easier to use than other
precautions, such as iodine
tablets or boiling water.

There is a particularly
high incidence of giar
diasis, the infection
caused by Giardia
lamblia, acquired by
campers and backpack
ers in the mountains of
the Western United
States.

Disinfecting water with iodine,
or by boiling water, has its draw
backs. While the iodine process
destroys virtually all pathogens
within 15 minutes, it may leave a
residual taste. Bringing water to
a boil for 10 minutes kills all cysts
but is a time-consuming process.
Travelers have encountered
the giardia parasite in virtually
every part of the world; espe
cially high attack rates have been
recorded among travelers in the

Soviet Union. There is a well
known association, for example,
between giardiasis and the drink
ing of tap water in Leningrad.
Much of the present information
about the incubation period of
giardiasis — between two to four
weeks — comes from Leningrad
cases.
The infection can also spread
through close person-to-person
contact in which fecal contami
nation may occur. This is partic
ularly common amongs children
in day care centers.
One study carried out by
George Washington University
Medical Center in an affluent
area of Northwest Washington,
D.C., found that 35 percent of
the children at day care centers
were infected and that infection
was spread to at least one
household member of 47 percent
of the infected children.
There has been a steady in
crease in the number of reported
infections in the United States
since the early 19605. Between
1965 and 1984 there were 23,776
recorded cases of giardiasis.
Locally, 148 cases of giardiasis
were reported in San Mateo
County in 1986, according to Gail
Hughes, epidemiologist with the
San Mateo County Department
of Health.
Symptoms of the disease in
clude those typical to normal
diarrhea, as well as cramping, ab
dominal pain, fatigue, nausea and
vomiting. If not treated, the con
dition can also result in dehydra
tion and weight loss.
The antibiotic typically used to
treat the disease is Flagyl, which
requires a prescription.
Available at The North Face at
383 University Ave. in Palo Alto,
giardia filters range in price from
$15 to $150 and have filtering ca
pacities ranging from 400 to 1000
quarts. Replacement filters start
at $14.
