## Hot tamales spice up hip cafe

Finally, someone with enough
style, business sense and taste
for authentic Mexican food has
gotten up the courage to open a
funky, fun Mexican restaurant in
the heart of Palo Alto.
The El Dorado Cafe has
enough style to make up for all
the frumpy, institutionalized
Mexican restaurants we've been
eating at all these years. Tired of
stale tacos, cheesy refried beans
and over-sauced burritos? None
of these items are found on the
menu at the El Dorado.
The restaurant offers a refresh
ing array of authentic Mexican
food, and its bright neon signs,
white walls, cement floors and
loud bar make it the trendiest
hangout in Palo Alto.
One wall sports a bizarre mural
of an Aztec warrior yelling from
the back seat of a stone Cadillac.
Palm trees jut through the ceiling
into large skylights. One side of
the restaurant consists of a long
bar where war-crying waiters
slam poppers on the tables,
readying them for eager custom
ers.
We knew we were at a happen
ing place when we saw Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
at a table across the room.
Needless to say, this restau

rant has attracted more yuppies
than a BMW dealership. All it
needs is a few more college stu
dents, and its reign will begin.
El Dorado s cuisine manages
to hold its own against the deluge
of atmosphere. The menu is ex
tensive, offering unusual cuisine
from a variety of Mexican
provinces.
My friend and 1 couldn't
decide what to order from the
wide selection of appetizers, so
we decided to have it all — in the
form of an appetizer plate.
The service was excellent and
prompt, except for one minor
screw-up: Two waiters came by
to take our drink orders —
which, as my friend noted, is bet
ter than no waiters taking your
drink order.
While we were waiting for our
appetizers, the complimentary
chips and salsa kept our appetites
at bay. The homemade chips
were excellent, and the salsa was
bearably spicy.
Of the appetizers, the gorditas
were my favorite. These small,
thick corn tortillas are stuffed
with sausage, chili and salsa. The
chalupa, which is a small tortilla
topped with chicken, jalapenos,
onions, cheese and sour cream,
was good, but rather difficult to
split between two people.
In fact, my only complaint
about the appetizer plate is that
the El Dorado only offers one of
each type of appetizer. Because
we were eager to try each one,
we had to split them in half — a
messy task.

For an entree, 1 ordered the
chile poblano relleno ($7.25),
which turned out to be a singular
experience.
Topped with a white, creamy
raisin sauce sprinkled with
pomegranate seeds, the chili was
stuffed with flavorful veal. An in
triguing combination of sweet
and spicy, the relleno is worth or
dering.
My friend ordered a tamale
plate ($7.25), which consisted of
a corn masa tamale with chicken
steamed in a corn husk with
green and red chili sauce. The

other tamale, which came
wrapped in a banana leaf, con
sisted of pork, tomato and a chili
salsa.
A brief debate ensued as to
whether the wrappings were
meant to be eaten. My friend, ex
perienced in Mexican food, won
out when he pointed out the stiff
ness of the banana leaf. Never
theless, the tamales were excel
lent.
We could hardly resist when
the waiter offered us dessert.
