# Food, funkiness on a shoestring
## 
### Alan Burdick 
You were misled. Your Ori
entation packet showed you
glossy photos of San Fran
cisco and implied that you'd
be hanging out there every
other day. Meanwhile, you've
only been there once (when
your parents came to visit),
and now you're broke. What's
the deal?
Don't give up hope. Inex
pensive spots to eat, drink and
dance really do exist in the
City, and finding them is not
the arduous task your friends
say it is.
I have set aside my shaky
senior thesis for a higher call
ing: the first installment of an
insider's guide to where to go
and what to do in the City — at
twice the fun and half the
bucks of University Avenue.
My dinner companion and 1
made our first stop of the eve
ning at Manora's Thai Cuisine.
Situated in a storefront at the
corner of 12th and Folsom,
Manora's is spacious and well
lit. The foliage is a nice touch,
more than can be said for the
restaurant's impressive array
of the Thai equivalent of Day-
Glo/black velvet Elvis paint
ings.

Bar service was not much
better; our beers didn't come
until after we were seated, and
even then we weren't served
Shingha, but rather some for
export-only beer. The barten
der did later redeem himself —
by deftly filling both our
glasses at once with one hand.
Our fears were allayed en
tirely once the menus, over
flowing with tempting ap
petizer options, arrived.
We passed up the Yum Hed
(for mushroom lovers) in favor
of Katong l ong (X). ultimately
the best dish of the evening. It
consisted of six fluted batter
shells filled with curried garlic
shrimp, chicken, onions and
fresh peas — garnished with
that paralegal of vegetables,
the fresh red chili pepper. Ac
companying it came the stan
dard but excellent side dish of
cucumbers, chilis and carrots
marinated in vinegar.
Next to come our way was
the Gad-Kiew-Wan (31), a
chicken dish in green curry
and coconut milk served with
fresh eggplant, green beans
and basil. The red chili pepper
again made a small but
profound appearance.
The last main dish. Pad-Kin
Na Ree (48), was a combination
ot prawn, calimari, chicken and
tried rice noodles with baby
corns and green onions. The
calimari was the highlight, served
both in rolled "sheet" form and
as baby squid with lovely little
tentacles. Both were very well
prepared — tender enough to eat
with a fork.
F or dessert, we had the Saim
Gems, the Thai version of a stan
dard Southeast Asian dessert,
made with sweet coconut milk
and crushed ice. The gems them
selves consisted of tapioca beads
stuffed with water chestnuts and
were surrounded by milk with
palm and toddy seeds.
The final tab for one appetizer,
two main dishes, dessert and four
beers came to just $23.30. We
later agreed that two appetizers
and one main dish would have
been more appropriate for later

pub-crawling.
Manora's wins points for its lo
cation. The Oasis and the
Paradise Lounge — landmarks of
the South-of-Market scene — are
situated just one block down on
Poison. The Ottis boasts a
glass-covered pool/dance floor,
but it's a tad expensive and is fre
quented by a rather fetid yuppie
crowd. The Paradise, too, has
suffered from press overkill but
is still great, despite the jostling.
Luckily, the Chronicle hasn't
noticed (yet) that the hip artsy
scene has shifted down to the
North Mission — about 15
minutes by foot from Manora's.
Strung out along 16th between
Valencia and Guerrero lies a host
of nightspots destined for great
ness — the Albion, the Sincere
Cafe, Los Arcos and the New
Dawn.
By the way, cover charges for
these and most city hangouts are
minimal ($2) or nonexistent.
Next, we hit the legendary
Babar for Anchor Steam on tap.
The Babar, a tiny spot on the
map at 24th and Guerrero, is one

of the last Beat bars still stand
ing. The City's best jazz jukebox
can be found in the Babar back
room.
Last stop — the Mirage on the
corner opposite the Babar.
Kvenings do not begin at the
Mirage; the airport lounge-style
furniture, arranged in two long
rows, is not aesthetically accept
able until after midnight. But
where else can you find 75-cent
Stroh's and a jukebox that covers
the range from Patsy Cline to
U2?
Granted, finding your way
home from the City without a car
is not fun. The last Caltrain
leaves the 4th and Towsend stop
at 10 p.m., which is useless for all
but the timid.
Yes, getting in and out of San
Francisco takes a little fore
-thought. But the more you go,
the less that's required. And let's
face it — you didn't come to Cali
fornia to see Palo Alto. There
really is a city up there with ac
cessible, inexpensive restaurants
and nightspots. Discover it
before it falls into the Pacific.

where else can you find 75-cent
Stroh's and a jukebox that covers
the range from Patsy Cline to
U2?
Granted, finding your way
home from the City without a car
is not fun. The last Caltrain
leaves the 4th and Towsend stop
at 10 p.m., which is useless for all
but the timid.
Yes, getting in and out of San
Francisco takes a little fore
-thought. But the more you go,
the less that's required. And let's
face it — you didn't come to Cali
fornia to see Palo Alto. There
really is a city up there with ac
cessible, inexpensive restaurants
and nightspots. Discover it
before it falls into the Pacific.

You were misled. Your Ori
entation packet showed you
glossy photos of San Fran
cisco and implied that you'd
be hanging out there every
other day. Meanwhile, you've
only been there once (when
your parents came to visit),
and now you're broke. What's
the deal?
Don't give up hope. Inex
pensive spots to eat, drink and
dance really do exist in the
City, and finding them is not
the arduous task your friends
say it is.
I have set aside my shaky
senior thesis for a higher call
ing: the first installment of an
insider's guide to where to go
and what to do in the City — at
twice the fun and half the
bucks of University Avenue.
My dinner companion and 1
made our first stop of the eve
ning at Manora's Thai Cuisine.
Situated in a storefront at the
corner of 12th and Folsom,
Manora's is spacious and well
lit. The foliage is a nice touch,
more than can be said for the
restaurant's impressive array
of the Thai equivalent of Day-
Glo/black velvet Elvis paint
ings.

Bar service was not much
better; our beers didn't come
until after we were seated, and
even then we weren't served
Shingha, but rather some for
export-only beer. The barten
der did later redeem himself —
by deftly filling both our
glasses at once with one hand.
Our fears were allayed en
tirely once the menus, over
flowing with tempting ap
petizer options, arrived.
We passed up the Yum Hed
(for mushroom lovers) in favor
of Katong l ong (X). ultimately
the best dish of the evening. It
consisted of six fluted batter
shells filled with curried garlic
shrimp, chicken, onions and
fresh peas — garnished with
that paralegal of vegetables,
the fresh red chili pepper. Ac
companying it came the stan
dard but excellent side dish of
cucumbers, chilis and carrots
marinated in vinegar.
Next to come our way was
the Gad-Kiew-Wan (31), a
chicken dish in green curry
and coconut milk served with
fresh eggplant, green beans
and basil. The red chili pepper
again made a small but
profound appearance.
The last main dish. Pad-Kin
Na Ree (48), was a combination
ot prawn, calimari, chicken and
tried rice noodles with baby
corns and green onions. The
calimari was the highlight, served
both in rolled "sheet" form and
as baby squid with lovely little
tentacles. Both were very well
prepared — tender enough to eat
with a fork.
F or dessert, we had the Saim
Gems, the Thai version of a stan
dard Southeast Asian dessert,
made with sweet coconut milk
and crushed ice. The gems them
selves consisted of tapioca beads
stuffed with water chestnuts and
were surrounded by milk with
palm and toddy seeds.
The final tab for one appetizer,
two main dishes, dessert and four
beers came to just $23.30. We
later agreed that two appetizers
and one main dish would have
been more appropriate for later

pub-crawling.
Manora's wins points for its lo
cation. The Oasis and the
Paradise Lounge — landmarks of
the South-of-Market scene — are
situated just one block down on
Poison. The Ottis boasts a
glass-covered pool/dance floor,
but it's a tad expensive and is fre
quented by a rather fetid yuppie
crowd. The Paradise, too, has
suffered from press overkill but
is still great, despite the jostling.
Luckily, the Chronicle hasn't
noticed (yet) that the hip artsy
scene has shifted down to the
North Mission — about 15
minutes by foot from Manora's.
Strung out along 16th between
Valencia and Guerrero lies a host
of nightspots destined for great
ness — the Albion, the Sincere
Cafe, Los Arcos and the New
Dawn.
By the way, cover charges for
these and most city hangouts are
minimal ($2) or nonexistent.
Next, we hit the legendary
Babar for Anchor Steam on tap.
The Babar, a tiny spot on the
map at 24th and Guerrero, is one

of the last Beat bars still stand
ing. The City's best jazz jukebox
can be found in the Babar back
room.
Last stop — the Mirage on the
corner opposite the Babar.
Kvenings do not begin at the
Mirage; the airport lounge-style
furniture, arranged in two long
rows, is not aesthetically accept
able until after midnight. But
where else can you find 75-cent
Stroh's and a jukebox that covers
the range from Patsy Cline to
U2?
