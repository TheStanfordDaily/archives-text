# Food, funkiness on a shoestring

You were misled. Your Ori
entation packet showed you
glossy photos of San Fran
cisco and implied that you'd
be hanging out there every
other day. Meanwhile, you've
only been there once (when
your parents came to visit),
and now you're broke. What's
the deal?
Don't give up hope. Inex
pensive spots to eat, drink and
dance really do exist in the
City, and finding them is not
the arduous task your friends
say it is.
I have set aside my shaky
senior thesis for a higher call
ing: the first installment of an
insider's guide to where to go
and what to do in the City — at
twice the fun and half the
bucks of University Avenue.
My dinner companion and 1
made our first stop of the eve
ning at Manora's Thai Cuisine.
Situated in a storefront at the
corner of 12th and Folsom,
Manora's is spacious and well
lit. The foliage is a nice touch,
more than can be said for the
restaurant's impressive array
of the Thai equivalent of Day-
Glo/black velvet Elvis paint
ings.

Bar service was not much
better; our beers didn't come
until after we were seated, and
even then we weren't served
Shingha, but rather some for
export-only beer. The barten
der did later redeem himself —
by deftly filling both our
glasses at once with one hand.
Our fears were allayed en
tirely once the menus, over
flowing with tempting ap
petizer options, arrived.
We passed up the Yum Hed
(for mushroom lovers) in favor
of Katong l ong (X). ultimately
the best dish of the evening. It
consisted of six fluted batter
shells filled with curried garlic
shrimp, chicken, onions and
fresh peas — garnished with
that paralegal of vegetables,
the fresh red chili pepper. Ac
companying it came the stan
dard but excellent side dish of
cucumbers, chilis and carrots
marinated in vinegar.
Next to come our way was
the Gad-Kiew-Wan (31), a
chicken dish in green curry
and coconut milk served with
fresh eggplant, green beans
and basil. The red chili pepper
again made a small but
profound appearance.
