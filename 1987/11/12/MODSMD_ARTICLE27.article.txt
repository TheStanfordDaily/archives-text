. ,The ride is over.
The Stanford men's soccer team's roller-coaster
season ended yesterday with a 2-1 overtime loss to
St. Mary's.
The defeat left the Cardinal at .500 for the year.
The squad finished with a 9-9-3 overall record and a
Pacific Soccer Conference tally.
Tied 0-0 at the end of regulation play, Stanford
and St. Mary's went into a 20-minute overtime.
The Gaels attacked quickly, scoring twice in the
first 10-minute half. Stanford answered with a
strike in the second overtime period but was unable
to; muster another and succumbed to yet another
Mnderdog.
The lone goal was scored by leading scorer Chris
Porch when he beat out the St. Mary's sweeper and
was able to go one-on-one with goalie John Ginoc
chio. It was the sophomore forward's seventh
strike of the season.
Stanford started the match strong, controlling
the play the entire first half. The Cardinal moved
the ball well, playing tight defense and keeping the
majority of the action in Gael territory.
"Stanford had many chances early in the game,"
St. Mary's Coach Tom Martin said. "If Ginocchio
hadn't played so well, Stanford would have won."
During the second period the Cardinal lost some
of its momentum but still stayed in the game. The
team was not as domineering as during the first
half, but it was able to shut out the Gaels and con
trol much of the play. Again, however, Stanford
was unable to score.
With 15 minutes remaining in the game Stanford
had a direct shot on goal from close range (due to a
Gael penalty). Usually such a shot is a sure score,
but Ginocchio made another superb save to send
the game into overtime.
"The second half we lost our intensity," Stan

ford Coach Sam Koch said. "We were still attack
ing but couldn't get the ball in."
"We rushed the game too much," co-captain
Mike Mossmer added. "We tried to force scores."
The Gaels' first goal came on a free kick during
the first minutes of extended play. A few plays later
St. Mary's extended its lead when it counterat
tacked off a Stanford corner kick, beat out the Car
dinal fullbacks, and got an open shot at the cage.
Koch praised Stanford goalie Alan Branson, who
started only his second game of the season. "Alan
played really well," Koch said. "Both shots were
very difficult to stop."
The loss capped an up-and-down season for the
talented booters. Stanford began the season with
an Eastern road trip in which it faced three top-20
opponents. Although the Cardinal went 2-3 on the
Eastern swing, the team was encouraged by its
play. Returning to Califorina when school opened,
the squad was 3-4-2.
With a 1-0 defeat of third-ranked San Francisco
Oct. 3, Stanford began its ascent. During the next
two weeks the squad went 4-0, beating three na
tionally ranked foes and allowing only one goal in
the four contests. After winning the ATT/Pacific
West Soccer Classic Oct. 11 there was much
speculation about the possibility of a first-ever
NCAA tournament bid and a top-20 ranking.
But the Cardinal was unable to maintain its con
sistency and dropped game after game to inferior
squads. The last month of the season the team went
2-6-1. It killed its chances of reaching the playoffs
by dropping games to San Jose State. Simon Fraser
and Santa Clara . The loss today prevented Stan
ford from recording its first winning season since
1985.
"Overall it was a good season," Mossmer said.
"We had some tough losses against mediocre
teams. It was typical of us to get pumped up for
great opponents and let the matches against weaker
squads slide."
