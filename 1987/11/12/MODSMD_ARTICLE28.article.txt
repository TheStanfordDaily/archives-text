# Football players a class act
## 
### 
Five-and-a-half weeks ago I
stood outside the Stanford
locker room just minutes after
UCLA had thoroughly
trounced the Cardinal 49-0. I
was waiting, along with a
do/en other reporters, for
Coach Jack Elway to finish his
usually short *peech to the
team so we could go in and in
terview the players.

I had to write a feature on
someone or something for
Monday's paper, but I didn't
want to do it. There were
many other places I would
rather have been.
The Cardinal players had
been overrun for 60 minutes
and were certainly feeling
down. The last thing they
needed now was to talk about
being overrun.
We reporters didn't seem to
care much. We had lurked
outside the entrance to the
locker room while the players
were walking in, our presence
seemingly saying, "It's not
over yet, guys."
When we finally entered the

room, it felt hollow. We all
crowded around Elway be
cause we were too scared or
maybe too ashamed to inter
rogate the players. Twenty
minutes later I walked out of
the locker room thoroughly
impressed.
I was also amazed. Each
player had answered our ques
tions with so much class and
composure that it caught me
off guard. In such circum
stances you might expect the
players to be curt or to study a
tiny particle on the floor the
whole time you're talking to
them.
Instead, almost every player
spoke in a straightforward
manner and looked at the
reporters eye-to-eye. The
players were also patient.
Many of them had to repeat
answers as each reporter made
the rounds and asked the same
questions.
And we ask some stupid
questions. I had decided to do
part of my story on the frustra
tions of senior wide receiver
Jeff James. I needed a quote
about how he was feeling after
Stanford's fourth straight loss.
So I asked, "How does it
feel losing four in a row?" An
obviously stupid question. But
rather than saying something
like, "How do you think it
feels, buddy," James inhaled
and gave me his answer.

"Being 0-4 and getting your
ass kicked in the last one
doesn't feel great," he said.
"I'll try to forget this one.
For that half hour or so,
however, the players were
forced to remember the game
over and over again. Each one
of the players responded in a
manner that should make the
Stanford community proud.
Here come the cliches: The
Cardinal players had more
class in defeat than several
Arizona and USC players had
in victory. And winning isn't
everything. The Stanford foot
ball program may not have a
winning record, but it is turn
ing out winning young men.
At this point, a reader of this
column may be thinking two
things. First, that the column
is just a rationale for losing. If
you think it takes a bunch of
jerks to win football games,
you might be right. But you
might also try looking in the
mirror and asking yourself if
you've won anything recently.
Second, my managing editor
may think I wrote this just to
get on the good side of the
football team. I don't care
what the football team thinks
of me, and they certainly don't
care what 1 think of them.
I just thought readers would
be interested in the topic.
