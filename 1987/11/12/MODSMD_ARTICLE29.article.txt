# Card's Robison enters nation's punting elite
## 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
When most people think of graduating Stanford*
seniors who might be playing in the National Foot
ball League next year, they think of star running
back Brad Muster and standout receiver Jeff
James.
But there's someone else the NFL will be watch
ins closely.
Punter Doug Robison.
"He definitely has a good opportunity to play in
the NFL," Stanford special teams Coach Larry
Kerr said. "He's a big guy with strong legs, and pro
teams are interested. Different clubs have asked
about him; they're well aware what he's done."
The senior is currently third in the nation in pun
ting, with an average of 45.5 yards per punt, trailing
only California's Scott Tabor (46.3 yards per punt)
and national leader Tom Tupa of Ohio State (47.4).
"We certainly will be covering him when we
look at Stanford," Los Angeles Raiders scout John
Kingden said.
Which is fine with Robison. He'd love to play for
the Raiders.
"They've always been my favorite team," he
said. "I've always wanted to be the one to replace
Ray Guy."
The problem with punting is that teams usually
only carry one punter, and their careers seem to
last forever â€” like Guy's did. As Robison said,
he'd like to be drafted by "someone that has no
punter."
It's certain that teams weak in the punting de
partment will be looking at Robison closely, not
just because he's among the national leaders
statistically, but also for reasons that aren't
reflected in statistics.
Things like hang time and an ability to get rid of
the ball quickly. Things Robison excels at.
"Number one, he's got very good hang time,
which allows the coverage to get down and cover
the football," Kerr said. "He also gets the ball off
quickly, which is one of the critical things pro
people ask about."
That's also one of the things Robison's com
panions on special teams appreciate. "He's
awesome," Stanford defensive back Rob
Fnglehardt said. "It's really something when
you've got a punter like that. We always know
we've got a lot of time to get down there and cover
the return man."
Robison thinks his strongest selling point is the
progress he's made since his freshman year. "What
1 have going for me best is that I've improved every
year," the four-year starter said. "There's been a

gradual incline in my performance every year, and
1 don't think any of the other top punters can Say
that."
Of course, it's kind of hard to come in as a fresh
man just out of Putnam High School in Oklahoma
City, Okla., and start the very first game of the
season.
Not intimidated, Robison booted a 50-yard punt
in the game against Oklahoma, the school that had
been Robison's second choice after Stanford.
Robison finished his freshman season with a re
spectable 39.5 yards per kick average and booted a
career-high 70-yarder against Arizona State that
same year. In 1985, he raised his average slightly to
39.7 yards per punt, and his junior season, Robison
hiked his average to 41.6 yards per punt.
This year, 12 of Robison's 35 punts have gone for
50 yards or more, and three have traveled over 60
yards.
"He's been punting since his freshman year, and
every year he's gotten better," Kerr said. "When
you're a freshman it's a little intimidating. You're
in the spotlight, and when you're a punter you go
out and you only get one shot. Everything focuses
on the punter.
"But Doug has gotten more and more confident
in his abilities and the punt team around him,"
Kerr said. "He's become a real leader out there."
Placekicker David Sweeney, who does much of
the short "pooch" punting for the Cardinal, agreed
that Robison has developed tremendously over the
past three years. "I don't think there's any guy
here who has improved as much as Doug has,"
Sweeney said. "He came in as the leading punter in
the nation his senior year of high school, and he
wasn't even a specialist." The 6-foot-4, 215-pound
Robison was an offensive and defensive lineman in
high school.
So what does fellow punter Sweeney, who has
practiced with Robison for four straight seasons,
think of Robison's chances in the NFL?
"As far as the punters I've seen, no one
compares with Doug," Sweeney said. "He's
definitely got the right stuff to be a pro punter."
Kerr concurs. "He definitely will get a shot with
some pro team," Kerr said, "and he's got a good
shot of making a team. He's mature, he under
stands what punting's all about, and physically he's
got all the tools."
But football isn't the only thing Robison has to
look forward to. Somewhere down the line
Robison, a public policy major, plans to go to busi
ness school. "I'd like to give the big boys my best
shot," Stanford's all-time leading punter said. "If it
works out, great; and if it doesn't, I'll get on with
my life."
