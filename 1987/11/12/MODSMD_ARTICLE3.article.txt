# May be first in nation
## Smokeless sections proposed for stadium 
### Laura Morrow 
Next fall Stanford Stadium could become
the first outdoor stadium in the nation to ban
smoking in a majority of its seats, if a recom
mendation made Monday by the Committee
on Athletics, Physical Education and Recrea
tion (CAPER) is approved by the Department
of Athletics.
The current University smoking policy,
which went into effect Jan. 1, 1985, calls for
the creation of "an environment as close to
smoke-free as possible" and prohibits indoor
smoking in all but a few University buildings.
After receiving complaints from fans
seated near smokers in the stadium, the ad

hoc committee responsible for the original
smoking policy urged CAPER to endorse the
creation of smoke-free sections in the
stadium.
"The important thing is that the Athletics
Department achieve consistency with the
University's stated smoking policy," said
CAPER chair Frances Conley, an associate
professor of surgery.
If it accepts the proposal, the Athletics De
partment will face the difficult task of deter
mining which sections will be non-smoking; it
would also have to develop procedures for
reassigning affected ticket-holders.
Alumni Association Director William
Stone, who is a non-smoker and a season

ticket holder, said he thought the proposal
was a "terrific" idea. He added that he would
gladly change seats to leave a smoking sec
tion. "Recognition of non-smokers' rights is
becoming a reality that most people accept,"
he said.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger said he
plans to study a variety of options for sepa
rating smokers and non-smokers in the
stadium. "We may end up creating a
patchwork quilt and hoping the wind blows
the right way," Geiger said.
Geiger said that since the policy will not
take effect until next year, if at all, there is
plenty of time to work out details of the plan
and respond to community concerns.
