# Fischer carries Cardinal to NCAA championships

It takes a special person to
take a basic human talent and
turn it into a skill few humans can
equal.
Like many of us, Stanford
senior Erich Fischer learned to
tread water at any early age.
Now, several years later, Fischer
not only has an extraordinary
ability to tread water for absurdly
long periods of time, but he also
manages to stay afloat with
frustrated foes trying to drown
him at the same time.
You've probably guessed by
now: Fischer is a water polo
player. You should know this as
well: Fischer is the best water
polo player on campus. And one
more thing: Fischer is probably

the best collegiate water polo
player in the country.
Ask his coach for the last four
years, Stanford Coach Dante
Dettamanti. "Erich's the kind of
player that can take over and
dominate a game and singlehan
dedly win a game. . . . Erich's
got to be the most complete
player at the college level right
now."
Mainly a swimmer until high
school, Fischer turned his atten
tion to water polo his freshman
year and embarked on a spectac
ular career with a less-than
noteworthy water polo program
at Reedley High School in Cali
fornia. Fischer followed the lead
of his brother, former Cardinal
goalkeeper Martin Fischer, and
chose Stanford as the school that
would serve as the stage for his

promising collegiate water polo
career.
Fischer immediately made his
mark as a player to be watched,
and not just a former big "Fish"
(Fischer's nickname) from a
small pond. In fact, his transition
was smoother than anybody ex
pected.
"I think he made the adjust
ment from high school to college
water polo faster than just about
any player I've ever had," Det
tamanti said. "He really had a
feel for a game. It's tough for a
freshman to come in and play
right away, but F>ich really
played well his freshman year.
He played like an experienced
player."
"It was really difficult coming
