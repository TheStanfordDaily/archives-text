# Fischer carries Cardinal to NCAA championships
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
It takes a special person to
take a basic human talent and
turn it into a skill few humans can
equal.
Like many of us, Stanford
senior Erich Fischer learned to
tread water at any early age.
Now, several years later, Fischer
not only has an extraordinary
ability to tread water for absurdly
long periods of time, but he also
manages to stay afloat with
frustrated foes trying to drown
him at the same time.
You've probably guessed by
now: Fischer is a water polo
player. You should know this as
well: Fischer is the best water
polo player on campus. And one
more thing: Fischer is probably

the best collegiate water polo
player in the country.
Ask his coach for the last four
years, Stanford Coach Dante
Dettamanti. "Erich's the kind of
player that can take over and
dominate a game and singlehan
dedly win a game. . . . Erich's
got to be the most complete
player at the college level right
now."
Mainly a swimmer until high
school, Fischer turned his atten
tion to water polo his freshman
year and embarked on a spectac
ular career with a less-than
noteworthy water polo program
at Reedley High School in Cali
fornia. Fischer followed the lead
of his brother, former Cardinal
goalkeeper Martin Fischer, and
chose Stanford as the school that
would serve as the stage for his

promising collegiate water polo
career.
Fischer immediately made his
mark as a player to be watched,
and not just a former big "Fish"
(Fischer's nickname) from a
small pond. In fact, his transition
was smoother than anybody ex
pected.
"I think he made the adjust
ment from high school to college
water polo faster than just about
any player I've ever had," Det
tamanti said. "He really had a
feel for a game. It's tough for a
freshman to come in and play
right away, but F>ich really
played well his freshman year.
He played like an experienced
player."
"It was really difficult coming

Senior Erich Fischer, who was lied for the Cardinal lead in scoring on last season's NCAA championship
team with 87 goals, spearheads this year's Stanford attack with 55 goals.
out of there where the high
school team was relatively weak
and then coming to Stanford,
which was a powerhouse in the
nation," Fischer said. "But it
was more exciting than anything,
coming up here and playing with
all these college players I had
admired all these years."
After significant playing time
both his freshman and sopho
more years (scoring a total of 46
goals and helping Stanford to the
1985 NCAA championship) Fis
cher found himself in the spot
light of last year's devastating 36-
0 NCAA championship team. As
the secondary two-meter man be
hind 1987 graduate Craig Klass,
Fischer started the season in top
form and never let down.
When the 1986 season was

over, Fischer not only had a
second NCAA championship
medal to his credit, but he also
had his name in the Cardinal
record hooks. Fischer and Klass
each scored a phenomenal 87
goals, 10 better than James Ber
geson's previous single-season
record.
Although parity has returned
this season to the nation's water
polo elite in California (winning
by an average score of 14-6 or
having two players scoring 87
goals is no longer a possibility, as
it was for last year's Cardinal),
Stanford remains a solid bet to
win this year's NCAA champion
ships in Long Beach Nov. 27-29.
Even without one of its many
talented players, it's possible
Stanford could be in a good posi
tion for the NCAAs. However, it
is doubtful Stanford could be
ranked in the nation's top five
without Fischer.
"He's very definitely carrying

the team this year," Dettamanti
said. "It gets to the point now
where he pretty much scores
when he wants to. He's just
about unstoppable if the referees
don't take away his opportunity
to score by calling a quick foul or
letting the defender manhandle
him.''
Fischer has tallied 55 goals so
far this season, 29 more than the
next Cardinal in line, senior
Grant Stanley. "Fish'' is also the
team's top assist man, one of the
fastest swimmers on the team
and a solid defender.
"He's a very good team
player. Playing the hole position,
he's our primary passer and No.
I assist man," Dettamanti said.
"He's seems to have a knack for
knowing when to pass the ball
and when to shoot it."
With Fischer's role change
from secondary hole man on a
team overflowing with experi
enced talent to the leader of a

team with relatively little experi
ence comes added pressure.
Despite the added responsibility,
however, he said he feels more at
ease than ever.
"(The pressure is] hard to deal
with; I try not to think about it
too much. Actually, I feel a little
more comfortable going out there
than I did before," Fischer said.
"During my freshman and soph
omore years I felt like I was at a
little of a disadvantage because 1
did not know the game as
well. . . . The younger players, 1
think, mentally are at a disadvan
tage to the older players because
they've heard of them. I know 1
was scared of Craig Klass when I
came here."
Although he stands apart from
most other players in his playing
ability, Fischer emphasized the
importance of his teammates to
his continued development.
"Without Matt lingler and
other people, I wouldn't have

half the goals I do," Fischer said.
"It's really a passing game, and if
you have guys who can get you
the ball and know the right time
to do it, that's going to help you
tremendously."
One of the facets of water polo
that appeals most to Fischer is
the game's complexity. A player
does not reach his peak until his
late 20s, he said. Thus Fischer,
like all young players, still has
room for improvement.
One part of his game that
needs no improvement, how
ever, is his mental toughness in
the pool. Take it from somebody
who doesn't just casually volun
teer Cardinal compliments, Cali
fornia Coach Pete Cutino.
"He is very intense, and I
think he's probably one of the
guttiest players I've ever seen,"
said Cutino, who has coached six
NCAA championship teams.
This intensity can be seen out
of the pool as well, where he is

one of the team's leaders. "He's
very intense, really wants to win
badly, and I think that carries
over to the rest of the team>"
Dettamanti said. "He ll say
things during team meetings that
all focus on winning. He gets a
little angry sometimes at guys
who don't have that same desire.
That's the way he leads."
Although Fischer said it was
difficult to actually focus on any
thing outside of water polo, he
said he finds that the sport pro
vides lessons that carry over into
other aspects of his life.
So, while "Fish" may live up
to his nickname very well, and
while he may be considered by
many to be the best collegiate
player in the nation, he is also an
intriguing person. Even Cutino
admitted this much.
"I think very highly of Erich as
a person, and I don't readily
praise any of you guys over
there," he said.
