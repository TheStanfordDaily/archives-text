# Gay group questions attitudes of Supreme Court nominee, son
## 
### Ben Wecht 
A 1984 letter to The Daily con
demning gay student organiza
tions written by Greg Kennedy,
son of Supreme Court nominee
Anthony Kennedy, has sparked
protest from the Stanford Organi
zation for Lesbian and Gay
Equality (SOLGE).
In the letter, then-freshman
Greg Kennedy wrote that groups
such as the Gay and Lesbian Alli
ance at Stanford (GLAS) are
"immoral and threatening to the
well-being of society itself."
SOLGE Chair Barb Voss said
in a SOLGE statement released
yesterday that "the letter raises
questions about the values held
by the Kennedy family.
"Anthony Kennedy may share
the same intolerant attitudes, es
pecially in light of his ruling sup
porting discrimination against
lesbians and gays in the U.S. mil
itary," Voss said.
Greg Kennedy was in Wash
ington, D.C., yesterday and was
not available for comment.
Voss' statement refers to a
1980 opinion by Judge Kennedy
upholding a U.S. Navy decision
to discharge sailors on the basis
of their homosexuality. Judge
Kennedy argued that such action
was necessary to "protect the
fabric of military life."
In a footnote to that opinion.

however, Judge Kennedy wrote
that he acknowledged the exis
tence of "substantial academic
comment" recognizing that
homosexuality might, in some
cases, be protected by a "funda
mental" constitutional right to
privacy.
That footnote drew harsh
criticism from some conservative
senators and may have helped
convince President Reagan to
pass up Kennedy last week and
nominate Judge Douglas Gins
burg for the court.
According to Professor Jack
Friedenthal, associate dean of
the Law School, Greg Kennedy's
statement in his 1984 letter is ir
relevant to his father's stance on
homosexual rights.
"I really think that if parents
are to be influenced by the beliefs
. . . of their nearly adult children,
they're in trouble," he said. "I
would hope my children would
think as individuals, (and) I think
most Stanford students would
not want to think their views
about the world are the same as
their parents'."
Law Prof. Thomas Grey
agreed with Friedenthal that
Judge Kennedy should not be
held to his son's views. "Can
you really infer much about a
person's legal stance from what
their children say?" he asked.
"I'd hate to be held responsi

ble for my daughter's opinions,
(and) I'd certainly resent it if
someone inferred from her views
what my views are," he said.
On the issue of privacy, which
includes the issue of gay rights,
Friedenthal said Judge Kennedy
is less controversial than Bork.
He called the Sacramento
apellate judge "a moderate . . .
willing to recognize the existence
of others' views."
Grey, however, emphasized
that "(Judge) Kennedy is not
going to be on the liberal side" of
issues. "He's not going to be out
there making any pathways for
the cause of gay rights."
Grey added that Judge Ken
nedy "could end up going either
way" on some issues. "Many
judges feel free to take wing once
they're on the Supreme Court."
In response to comments by
Grey and Friedenthal, Voss said
that if Greg Kennedy's views are
irrelevant to his father's legal
stance on homosexuals, "I
would like some response from
(Anthony) Kennedy" confirming
that.
Voss said that Judge Ken
nedy's 1980 decision on gays in
the military, as well as another
decision in which Kennedy
"overturned Washington state
law requiring equal pay for equal
work," raises questions the
judge must answer.

most Stanford students would
not want to think their views
about the world are the same as
their parents'."
Law Prof. Thomas Grey
agreed with Friedenthal that
Judge Kennedy should not be
held to his son's views. "Can
you really infer much about a
person's legal stance from what
their children say?" he asked.
"I'd hate to be held responsi

ble for my daughter's opinions,
(and) I'd certainly resent it if
someone inferred from her views
what my views are," he said.
On the issue of privacy, which
includes the issue of gay rights,
Friedenthal said Judge Kennedy
is less controversial than Bork.
He called the Sacramento
apellate judge "a moderate . . .
willing to recognize the existence
of others' views."
Grey, however, emphasized
that "(Judge) Kennedy is not
going to be on the liberal side" of
issues. "He's not going to be out
there making any pathways for
the cause of gay rights."
Grey added that Judge Ken
nedy "could end up going either
way" on some issues. "Many
judges feel free to take wing once
they're on the Supreme Court."
In response to comments by
Grey and Friedenthal, Voss said
that if Greg Kennedy's views are
irrelevant to his father's legal
stance on homosexuals, "I
would like some response from
(Anthony) Kennedy" confirming
that.
Voss said that Judge Ken
nedy's 1980 decision on gays in
the military, as well as another
decision in which Kennedy
"overturned Washington state
law requiring equal pay for equal
work," raises questions the
judge must answer.
