# Reagan appoints Judge Kennedy
## Alum named to high court vacancy 
### Ben Wecht With wire reports 
President Reagan yesterday
announced his nomination of
federal appeals court Judge An
thony Kennedy, a Stanford
alumnus, to the Supreme Court.
Reagan said, however, that he
would wait to receive the results
of a complete FBI background
investigation before formally
submitting Kennedy's name to
the Senate.
"The experience of the last
several months has made us all a
little bit wiser," Reagan said in a
reference to the controversies
surrounding his two previous un
successful attempts to fill the
seat on the court vacated June 26

retired.
If confirmed, Kennedy, who
earned a bachelor's degree in po

William Rehnquist earned a
coterminal political science
degree here in 1948 and gradu

in 1952, as did Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor. O'Connor
earned a bachelor's degree in
economics here in 1950.
Reagan appointed O'Connor to
the court in 1981 and elevated
Rehnquist, a 1972 Nixon appoin
tee, to chief justice last year.
Two of Kennedy's three
children currently attend Stan
ford. Kristen Kennedy is a soph
omore, and Greg Kennedy is a
senior.
Kristen and Greg Kennedy
were unavailable for comment
yesterday. According to their
roommates, the two left together
Tuesday morning to join their
father in Washington, DC.
Kennedy's other child, Justin,
graduated from Stanford last
year with a bachelor's degree in
economics. Kennedy's wife,
Mary Jeanne, earned her mas
ter's in education here in 1962.
Kennedy, 51, was the presi
dent's third choice to fill the va
cant court seat. Last month, the
Senate rejected Reagan's first
choice. Judge Robert Bork, in a
