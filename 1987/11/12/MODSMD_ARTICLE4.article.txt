# Reagan appoints Judge Kennedy
## Alum named to high court vacancy 
### Ben Wecht With wire reports 
President Reagan yesterday
announced his nomination of
federal appeals court Judge An
thony Kennedy, a Stanford
alumnus, to the Supreme Court.
Reagan said, however, that he
would wait to receive the results
of a complete FBI background
investigation before formally
submitting Kennedy's name to
the Senate.
"The experience of the last
several months has made us all a
little bit wiser," Reagan said in a
reference to the controversies
surrounding his two previous un
successful attempts to fill the
seat on the court vacated June 26
when Justice Lewis Powell Jr.
retired.
If confirmed, Kennedy, who
earned a bachelor's degree in po
litical science here in 1958 and a
law degree from Harvard Law
School, will become the third
Stanford alumnus to sit on the
present court. Chief Justice
William Rehnquist earned a
coterminal political science
degree here in 1948 and gradu

ated from Stanford Law School
in 1952, as did Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor. O'Connor
earned a bachelor's degree in
economics here in 1950.
Reagan appointed O'Connor to
the court in 1981 and elevated
Rehnquist, a 1972 Nixon appoin
tee, to chief justice last year.
Two of Kennedy's three
children currently attend Stan
ford. Kristen Kennedy is a soph
omore, and Greg Kennedy is a
senior.
Kristen and Greg Kennedy
were unavailable for comment
yesterday. According to their
roommates, the two left together
Tuesday morning to join their
father in Washington, DC.
Kennedy's other child, Justin,
graduated from Stanford last
year with a bachelor's degree in
economics. Kennedy's wife,
Mary Jeanne, earned her mas
ter's in education here in 1962.
Kennedy, 51, was the presi
dent's third choice to fill the va
cant court seat. Last month, the
Senate rejected Reagan's first
choice. Judge Robert Bork, in a
-58-to-42 vote. Judge Douglas
Ginsburg, the president's second
nominee, withdrew last Saturday
after disclosures that he had used
marijuana.
Appearing before reporters in
the White House briefing room,
Reagan called Kennedy "a true
conservative," praised his re
cord on the bench and in civic af
fairs and described him as a
"courageous, tough, but fair
jurist."
The president appealed for a
"spirit of cooperation and bipar
tisanship" in the confirmation
hearings on Kennedy, which are
not expected to begin until Janu
ary.
Reaction to Kennedy's nomi
nation in the Senate was gener
ally favorable, but enthusiasm
was muted in light of the troubles
encountered by Ginsburg and
Bork. Most senators said the
nominee could expect intense,
even unprecedented scrutiny be
cause of the controversies that
doomed Bork and Ginsburg.
A broad range of senators from
both parties indicated the federal
appeals judge from California is
likely to be confirmed, based on
what they know now of his ex
perience and philosophy.
White House officials said the
administration grilled Kennedy
for three hours Sunday and that
FBI agents talked to him for 10
hours in an effort to prevent any
repetition of the political embar
rassment caused the administra
tion by the Ginsburg nomination.
A senior official said Reagan
himself asked Kennedy whether
there was anything embarrassing
in his background during a half
hour meeting in the White House
residence on Monday evening
and was told that there was not.
The official said White House
deputy chief of staff Kenneth
Duberstein asked the same ques
tion of Ginsburg before he was
nominated but that Ginsburg said
nothing about marijuana use.
Kennedy told reporters that he
had been asked specifically
whether he had ever used mari
juana and said, "The answer was
no, firmly no." Kristen Ken

nedy told The Daily Sunday that
her father "is anti-drug."
Jack Friedenthal, associate
dean of the Law School, said he
had "had mild concerns that the
Kennedy nomination was dead"
because of comments made by
ultra-conservative senators and
members of the administration
last week that they would
filibuster a Reagan choice of
Kennedy over Ginsburg.
"To tell the president that
Kennedy is unacceptable and
then to support him now that
Ginsburg has withdrawn, it
leaves a strange taste," he said,
adding that it also raises ques
tions about the senators' sin

cerity.
Friedenthal added, however,
that there is no possibility of
Democratic oppostion drawing
out the confirmation process in
order to prevent Reagan from
getting another conservative on
the court.
Referring to Republican
senators, he said, "They're for
him all the way. They don't want
another loss. ... I think the
president has covered all the
bases."
Friedenthal also said that
"Ginsburg's withdrawal and lack
of a hearing leaves ample time"
for confirmation, "and 1 don't
think the Democrats could draw

it out that long. Of course, I've
been wrong before, but I don't
think (the FBI] will turn up
much," he said.
"How the court will tilt
depends on how it goes on 10
major different issues," Frieden
thal said. "There is no question
that Kennedy is basically conser
vative, but it doesn't mean that
on every one of these issues his
decision will be."
Law professor Tom Grey
agreed, saying "Kennedy is
more conservative than Powell
was. . . . He's not as conserva
tive as Bork, Rehnquist or
Scalia, but it's really hard to tell.
He could go either way."
