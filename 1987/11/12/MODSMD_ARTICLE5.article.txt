# Debate focuses on Area One core list

A Western Culture Task Force
proposal to abandon the Western
Culture core reading list could he
an "elusive journey toward
something unattainable," Eng
lish Prof. William Chace warned
in a debate with History Prof.
Paul Seaver last night.
Although Chace said he agrees
with the "prevailing spirit" and
the "laudable commentary" of
the recently released task force
report on the University's West
ern Culture program, he told a
Branner Hall audience of 1(K) that
he nevertheless supports the ex
istence of a core list for the West
ern Culture tracks. "The core list
is not a miscellaneous and ran
dom collection of books," he
said. "It shows the rise and fall
of cultures."
Seaver, who chairs the task
force, disagreed, saying that the
group intentionally decided not
to define a core list in its report.
"The task force report is a
guideline, an invitation to ex
perimentation."
Chace critized the task force
proposal for lacking specific

guidelines. "There is no real sub
stance in the report, no explicit
phrases of how IWestern Cul
ture] might be redirected," he
said.
Chace said that abandoning the
core list would result in "a gen
eral degeneration" of the West
ern Culture tracks. "The Univer
sity in the future could be put in
the embarrassing position of re
quiring a course without really
knowing what's going on in it."
Chace said he believes the core
list is essential. "These works on
the (current) core list and on the
secondary list, many of whose
writers were not supporters of
the status quo, have had an im
pact on our language, our
debates and our way of think
ing," he said.
Seaver countered by arguing
that the fact that the report does
not specify a core list does not
rule out including current re
quired texts from reading lists.
"There is no suggestion in the
report that [the works in the pres
ent core list] would not be read,"
he said. "If they are that impor
tant, who is going to avoid
them?"
According to Seaver, Western
Culture has been defined in the
terms of elite culture, which "by
definition is a white male cul
ture." The proposed changes, he

said, would "suggest in fact a
more adventurous culture, more
open to cultures surrounding
Europe."
Chace said the existing tracks
give students a chance "to begin
somewhere. Students can go to
other places, and we do have the
non-Western (distribution) re
quirement.
