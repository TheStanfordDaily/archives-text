# False alarms create concern
## 
### Susan Mckean Staff writer 
As false fire alarms continue to plague campus
residences, Palo Alto Fire Department and Univer
sity officials are meeting to resolve the problem.
Fire Chief Robert Wall said Tuesday.
According to Wall, 50 percent of all fire alarms at
Stanford are false, compared to only 13 percent in
Palo Alto. The fire department responds to every
alarm with at least one fire truck and three
firefighters, at a cost of $250 per hour, Wall said.
Ralph Buchanan, director of University Opera
tions, Maintenance and Utilities, acknowledged
that there is a problem with false alarms on campus
but said he did not know if the problem is any
worse than it has been in past years.
"Any false alarm is a problem. It creates a
response under emergency conditions unneces
sarily," he said. "It creates apathy, which is the
greatest concern, because after a while no one will
take an alarm seriously. And it creates extra main
tenance expenses."
Most alarm malfunctions this vear have occurred
in Governor's Corner, where a faulty alarm system
was installed when the complex was built, accord
ing to Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington. He
noted, however, that most of the problems have
been repaired.
According to several students from different
residences in Governor's Corner, the frequency of
false alarms varies greatly between houses.

Christine Cissielka, a resident assistant in East
House, said she has encountered no problem there,
but Schiff RA Ruth Weinberg said false alarms oc
cur in Schiff once or twice a week, a situation she
called "a real drag."
Weinberg said the false alarms are mostly due to
extra-sensitive systems activated near the dorm's
kitchenette. She added that the frequency of alarms
has caused apathy among students. Students
"don't take the alarms seriously," she said.
A resident of Griffin House, however, said that
even though there were two or three false alarms in
the house last week, most residents still leave the
building.
And according to David Kang, an RAin Jenkins
House, there were four or five alarms there at the
beginning of the quarter. He said one had been
caused by tampering with "an outside alarm that
was so badly damaged the whole unit had to be
replaced."
Marx House RA Peter Solberg said the alarm
system there is "in good shape" and "has been
quiet lately." In contrast, Adams House has had
"problems with malfunctioning systems" that are
often caused by "spiders or bugs in the alarms,"
according to RA Claudia Hess.
According to Wall, false alarms have three main
causes: alarm system malfunctions, oversensitive
alarms and pranksters.
"Our greatest fear is that with enough false
alarms people won't get out of the buildings when
it's real," Herrington said.
