Cost-of-living increases targeted
WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders and Reagan ad
ministration officials are discussing a budget compromise pro
posal to limit cost-of-living increases on a broad range of federal
benefit programs, including Social Security and other retirement
accounts, while increasing revenues by limiting the indexing of
federal income taxes, according to sources familiar with the
talks.
One senior official said the proposal — dubbed the "2 per
cent" plan — would eliminate the first 2 percentage points on
cost-of-living allowances on retirement benefits that normally
rise according to the rate of inflation. It would also reduce by 2
percentage points the adjustment of individual income tax
brackets and deductions that would otherwise become fully in
dexed to inflation in fiscal 1989.
Cutting the cost-of-living adjustment for federal retirement
benefits including Social Security would save about $5 billion in
fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1, and as much as $12 billion the
following year. The limit on income tax indexation would not
save anything until fiscal 1989, when it would yield about $4 bil
lion in revenue.
However, officials cautioned that the proposal is only part of
a broad examination of all alternatives that could lead to at least
a $23 billion reduction in the deficit this year. The proposal to
cut retirement benefits, they said, would be expected to
encounter significant political hurdles, and could be accom
plished only with the backing of President Reagan and top con
gressional leaders.
Fed: Crash left no serious damage
WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve officials, tracking finan
cial institutions, brokerage firms and the economy in general in
the wake of the recent stock market plunge, so far have found
no indication of serious damage.
Senior Fed officials expressed amazement at the end of last
week that the huge stock market decline has had so little fallout.
While many brokerage firms have suffered large losses, only a
few smaller firms have failed.
No one appeared ready to declare the crisis over, but the
more time that passes without any major institutional or firm
failures — which could send shock waves through the market —
the more relaxed Fed officials have become.
Officials said no financial institution has sought federal help,
such as large loans from the Federal Reserve, because of
market-related losses. Although bank loans to brokers and
others involved in the market jumped by $5 billion or more
shortly after the plunge, officials took that as a sign that standby
lines of credit were being used in a normal way following an un
expected shock that called for more cash.
Since Oct. 19— "Black Monday," when the value of U.S.
stocks fell by more than $500 billion — the Federal Reserve
Board in Washington has had daily telephone conference calls
with officials in the system's 12 regional Federal Reserve banks.
The calls have helped keep the banks informed about what was
being done to try to calm the markets, while officials at the
banks have reported on what careful inquiries around their
regions had turned up in the way of economic effects.
Foes disrupt Kim Dae Jung rally
PUSAN, South Korea — Presidential candidate Kim Dae
Jung crossed the line of South Korea's regional politics yester
day and found himself under siege by angry, rock-throwing op
ponents.
After an afternoon rally here, Kim was hosting his supporters
at a banquet in his hotel when several hundred supporters of his
opposition rival, Kim Young Sam, gathered in the street
outside, according to witnesses. They demanded that Kim
withdraw from the race, leaving Kim Young Sam, a native of
this southern port city, as the major opposition choice.
The protesters' rocks broke windows of the first and second
floors of the hotel, stopping one level short of the floor on which
the banquet was being held. Government-controlled KBS televi
sion reported that at least four of Kim Dae Jung's men — includ
ing one of his bodyguards — were injured in the clash.
Riot police were summoned to separate the rival camps, and
their presence and heavy rains decreased the protesters to 50 or
fewer by late evening.
At his earlier rally, during which he attracted a good crowd on
his rival's turf, Kim was nearly hit by a sand-filled bottle thrown
from the crowd. Late in his nearly hour-long speech, the bottle
arced onto the elevated speaker's stand from the crowd below.
According to press reports, the bottle was apparently thrown by
a 26-year-old Pusan businessman. He was beaten by Kim's sup
porters, then taken into custody by the candidates' security
men.
France rejects ransom offer
BEIRUT, Lebanon — France rejected an offer to recover
three of its citizens held in Lebanon for $3 million and a ship
ment of 500,000 artillery shells to Iran, As Safir newspaper said
yesterday.
The leftist newspaper said the $3 million was asked for kidnap
victims Paul Kaufmann, Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine,
but France, fearing a scandal similar to the U.S. arms-for
hostages deal, declined to accept the Iranian offer forwarded to
Paris through a third party, the paper added.
A member of the Shia Amal movement who was involved in
arranging a safe passage out of Beirut for South Korean
diplomat Do Chae Sung, who was freed last week, told the Ger
man Press Agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur that "a market for
the foreign hostages had opened."
He predicted that for 21 other foreigners still detained by pro-
Iranian Shia Moslems in Lebanon, there would be solutions
similar to the reported $1 million deal for last week's release of
Do.
Environmental issues debated
BEDFORD, N.H. — Five Democratic presidential candi
dates, meeting yesterday to debate environmental issues for the
first time in the 1988 campaign, blasted Reagan administration
policies and called for a variety of new laws and international
summit meetings to control acid rain, nuclear waste, ocean
dumping and other problems.
The Five Democrats offered little disagreement or sharp
criticism of one another in the two-hour televised forum. They
joked, politely complimented one another on policies and
achievements, and generally avoided the personal and political
jabs that marked last week's feisty Republican candidates'
debate in Houston.
Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt appeared to speak the
most forcefully and with the most detail, particularly about his
experiences in Arizona cleaning up an asbestos dump, negotiat
ing with Mexico on air pollution and establishing what is consid
ered the nation's toughest ground water pollution law.

gressional leaders.
Fed: Crash left no serious damage
WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve officials, tracking finan
cial institutions, brokerage firms and the economy in general in
the wake of the recent stock market plunge, so far have found
no indication of serious damage.
Senior Fed officials expressed amazement at the end of last
week that the huge stock market decline has had so little fallout.
While many brokerage firms have suffered large losses, only a
few smaller firms have failed.
No one appeared ready to declare the crisis over, but the
more time that passes without any major institutional or firm
failures — which could send shock waves through the market —
the more relaxed Fed officials have become.
Officials said no financial institution has sought federal help,
such as large loans from the Federal Reserve, because of
market-related losses. Although bank loans to brokers and
others involved in the market jumped by $5 billion or more
shortly after the plunge, officials took that as a sign that standby
lines of credit were being used in a normal way following an un
expected shock that called for more cash.
Since Oct. 19— "Black Monday," when the value of U.S.
stocks fell by more than $500 billion — the Federal Reserve
Board in Washington has had daily telephone conference calls
with officials in the system's 12 regional Federal Reserve banks.
The calls have helped keep the banks informed about what was
being done to try to calm the markets, while officials at the
banks have reported on what careful inquiries around their
regions had turned up in the way of economic effects.
Foes disrupt Kim Dae Jung rally
PUSAN, South Korea — Presidential candidate Kim Dae
Jung crossed the line of South Korea's regional politics yester
day and found himself under siege by angry, rock-throwing op
ponents.
After an afternoon rally here, Kim was hosting his supporters
at a banquet in his hotel when several hundred supporters of his
opposition rival, Kim Young Sam, gathered in the street
outside, according to witnesses. They demanded that Kim
withdraw from the race, leaving Kim Young Sam, a native of
this southern port city, as the major opposition choice.
The protesters' rocks broke windows of the first and second
floors of the hotel, stopping one level short of the floor on which
the banquet was being held. Government-controlled KBS televi
sion reported that at least four of Kim Dae Jung's men — includ
ing one of his bodyguards — were injured in the clash.
Riot police were summoned to separate the rival camps, and
their presence and heavy rains decreased the protesters to 50 or
fewer by late evening.
At his earlier rally, during which he attracted a good crowd on
his rival's turf, Kim was nearly hit by a sand-filled bottle thrown
from the crowd. Late in his nearly hour-long speech, the bottle
arced onto the elevated speaker's stand from the crowd below.
According to press reports, the bottle was apparently thrown by
a 26-year-old Pusan businessman. He was beaten by Kim's sup
porters, then taken into custody by the candidates' security
men.
France rejects ransom offer
BEIRUT, Lebanon — France rejected an offer to recover
three of its citizens held in Lebanon for $3 million and a ship
ment of 500,000 artillery shells to Iran, As Safir newspaper said
yesterday.
The leftist newspaper said the $3 million was asked for kidnap
victims Paul Kaufmann, Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine,
but France, fearing a scandal similar to the U.S. arms-for
hostages deal, declined to accept the Iranian offer forwarded to
Paris through a third party, the paper added.
A member of the Shia Amal movement who was involved in
arranging a safe passage out of Beirut for South Korean
diplomat Do Chae Sung, who was freed last week, told the Ger
man Press Agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur that "a market for
the foreign hostages had opened."
He predicted that for 21 other foreigners still detained by pro-
Iranian Shia Moslems in Lebanon, there would be solutions
similar to the reported $1 million deal for last week's release of
Do.
Environmental issues debated
BEDFORD, N.H. — Five Democratic presidential candi
dates, meeting yesterday to debate environmental issues for the
first time in the 1988 campaign, blasted Reagan administration
policies and called for a variety of new laws and international
summit meetings to control acid rain, nuclear waste, ocean
dumping and other problems.
The Five Democrats offered little disagreement or sharp
criticism of one another in the two-hour televised forum. They
joked, politely complimented one another on policies and
achievements, and generally avoided the personal and political
jabs that marked last week's feisty Republican candidates'
debate in Houston.
Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt appeared to speak the
most forcefully and with the most detail, particularly about his
experiences in Arizona cleaning up an asbestos dump, negotiat
ing with Mexico on air pollution and establishing what is consid
ered the nation's toughest ground water pollution law.

Cost-of-living increases targeted
WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders and Reagan ad
ministration officials are discussing a budget compromise pro
posal to limit cost-of-living increases on a broad range of federal
benefit programs, including Social Security and other retirement
accounts, while increasing revenues by limiting the indexing of
federal income taxes, according to sources familiar with the
talks.
One senior official said the proposal — dubbed the "2 per
cent" plan — would eliminate the first 2 percentage points on
cost-of-living allowances on retirement benefits that normally
rise according to the rate of inflation. It would also reduce by 2
percentage points the adjustment of individual income tax
brackets and deductions that would otherwise become fully in
dexed to inflation in fiscal 1989.
Cutting the cost-of-living adjustment for federal retirement
benefits including Social Security would save about $5 billion in
fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1, and as much as $12 billion the
following year. The limit on income tax indexation would not
save anything until fiscal 1989, when it would yield about $4 bil
lion in revenue.
However, officials cautioned that the proposal is only part of
a broad examination of all alternatives that could lead to at least
a $23 billion reduction in the deficit this year. The proposal to
cut retirement benefits, they said, would be expected to
encounter significant political hurdles, and could be accom
plished only with the backing of President Reagan and top con
gressional leaders.
