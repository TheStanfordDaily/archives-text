University President Donald
Kennedy said yesterday he
would not discourage faculty
members from joining San Fran
cisco's Bohemian Club, a highly
exclusive organization that has
been accused of unfair labor
practices and discriminatory
policies against women.
At a Faculty Senate meeting
yesterday, English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz asked Kennedy to "take
the lead" in asking faculty not to
join a club "where women are
discriminated against." Res
ponding. Kennedy said "those
kinds of decisions are best left to
individuals."
The 115-year-old all-male club,
which includes such prominent
members as President Reagan
and top executives from 40 of the
50 largest corporations in the
United States, has come under
Fire on campus in recent weeks
after members of the United
Stanford Workers union publicly
suggested that the University
may have an official relationship
with the club.
Kennedy denied the existence
of such a relationship and added
that the only connection between
Stanford and the club is a Uni
versity practice of subsidizing
faculty members' dues.
"We have a regular policy of
subsidizing dues to a club where
a member shows that it substan
tially enhances his or her posi
tion, but we do not have a policy
that makes these decisions based
on investigations of these clubs'
policies," he said.
Kennedy saijij that membership
in clubs such as the the
Bohemian Club may provide
University officials in develop
ment or public affairs with "a
constant set of relationships that
make it possible to have contacts
and personal relations."
Rebholz also asked Kennedy
to specify what would happen to
joint Hoover-Stanford resources
if the University were to
"divorce" itself from the Hoover
Institution. Kennedy responded
that although many of Hoover's
library and archival holdings
belong to Stanford, items are of
ten donated to Hoover "under a
set of expectations. . . . It's pos
sible that the courts could be
called in to divide these up," he
said.
No such separation has been
officially proposed, but Rebholz
cited San Francisco Chronicle
columnist Herb Caen's charac
terization of Hoover as "Stan
ford's embarrassment."
University Registrar Sally
Mahoney discussed the revision
of the University's End Quarter
Examination Policy, which was
outlined in a report submitted to
the senate by the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and A
chievement.
Last spring, the senate voted
to stiffen rules regarding the re
scheduling of final exams,
making it much more difficult for
faculty and students to give and
take exams at times other than
those specified by the Univer
sity.
"We will provide faculty with
alternatives to supporting stu
dents who bring forth reasons to
change examination dates,"
Mahoney said.
Committee Chair David Wel
lbery said the committee is con
sidering an investigation that
would examine whether there is a
"lack of parity" in grading
policies among different depart
ments.
