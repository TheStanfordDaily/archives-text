# Security 'disaster' may be a myth
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Intensive
military interrogation of Marine
Sgt. Clayton Lonetree in recent
weeks, supported by polygraph
tests and psychological examina
tions, strongly indicate that the
former guard did not, as earlier
believed, arrange for Soviet
agents to penetrate the U.S. Em
bassy in Moscow, according to
officials of two U.S. agencies.
The new evidence, considered
reliable but not yet conclusive by
officials familiar with it, suggests
strongly that the security
"disaster" of Soviet agents
roaming through sensitive por
tions of the embassy with the
cooperation of Marine guards
never took place.
The fear that Soviets were
allowed into the embassy build
ing after working hours by
Lonetree and a co-worker,
Marine Cpl. Arnold Braey, was
the most sensational aspect of
last spring's Marine guard spy
scandal. Later, however, charges
against Bracy were dropped, and
the spy charges against Lonetree

were changed to delete the ac
cusation that he had helped admit
Soviets to the building. Lonetree
was subsequently convicted of
espionage on other charges
related to his contacts with the
KGB secret police.
But the State Department, as
suming that Soviet spies had pen
etrated the embassy, has treated
even the most heavily guarded
facilities in the building in central
Moscow as having been com
promised. In April, it flew a spe
cial secret communications van
to the Soviet capital for the visit
there by Secretary of State
George Shultz. Highly classified
messages from Moscow continue
to be taken by daily courier to
Frankfurt, West Germany, rather
than transmitted in coded com
munications.
In the midst of the scandal, the
Marine Corps took the unprece
dented step of recalling the entire
28-member Moscow guard
detachment and the State De
partment authorized the spend
ing of millions of dollars to

replace sophisticated communi
cations facilities in Moscow and
overhaul other aspects of the
chancery building on an emer
gency basis.
Officials said there is no rela
tionship between the U.S.
Marine Guard security breaches
in the U.S. Kmbassy and the al
leged bugging of a new U.S. Km
bassy building which has been
under construction nearby for
several years.
Lonetree, who turned himself
in to the Central Intelligence
Agency station chief in Vienna
last December for having contact
with a KGB agent in Moscow,
never said he had allowed Soviet
agents into the embassy and
denied it whenever it was put to
him, according to his civilian at
torney, Lawrence Cohen of St.
Paul, Minn.
The alarm bells over Soviet
penetration were touched off in
mid-March when Bracy, who had
been summoned for interrogation
about his service in Moscow,
signed a statement at Twentynine

Palms, Calif., saying he hail
cooperated with Lonetree in per
mitting Soviet agents access to
sensitive areas and cryptographic
equipment in the Moscow em
bassy.
But then Hracy recanted the
statement, accusing his Naval In
vestigative Service interrogators
of coercing him into making false
declarations.
Nevertheless, many senior of
ficials in the State Department
and U.S. intelligence agencies
continued to operate under the
belief that Bracy's original state
ment had been true, and that he
recanted under the advice of
lawyers to protect himself.
Officials have confirmed*
however, that no listening
devices or other physical signs of
entry into the existing chancery
have been found.
A senior State Department of
ficial recalled that the depart
ment went into "a frenzy' at the
news of the presumed Soviet
penetrations.

torney, Lawrence Cohen of St.
Paul, Minn.
The alarm bells over Soviet
penetration were touched off in
mid-March when Bracy, who had
been summoned for interrogation
about his service in Moscow,
signed a statement at Twentynine

Palms, Calif., saying he hail
cooperated with Lonetree in per
mitting Soviet agents access to
sensitive areas and cryptographic
equipment in the Moscow em
bassy.
But then Hracy recanted the
statement, accusing his Naval In
vestigative Service interrogators
of coercing him into making false
declarations.
Nevertheless, many senior of
ficials in the State Department
and U.S. intelligence agencies
continued to operate under the
belief that Bracy's original state
ment had been true, and that he
recanted under the advice of
lawyers to protect himself.
Officials have confirmed*
however, that no listening
devices or other physical signs of
entry into the existing chancery
have been found.
A senior State Department of
ficial recalled that the depart
ment went into "a frenzy' at the
news of the presumed Soviet
penetrations.
