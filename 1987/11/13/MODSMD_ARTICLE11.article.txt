I he Stanford Symphony Orchestra
received a $27.(KM) grant to tour the
Far East last night from the Stanford
Centennial Celebration Operating
Committee in a move aimed at pro
moting Stanford's image abroad, ac
cording to a member of the or
chestra.
Orchestra member Paul Nghiem
said the symphony's Far East tour
will help counteract the popular
image of Stanford as only a scientific
and technical institution."We feel
that this is evidence that Stanford
University felt too limited to a
'techy' school image," he said.
Steven Peeps, the Centennial
Committee member who presented
the grant, said that by supporting the
tour, the Centennial Committee
hopes to "bring a lot of credit to the
Stanford Department of Humanities
and Sciences." He said the orchestra
members will act "as ambassadors
on behalf of Stanford. "
According to Music Prof. Andor
l oth, the symphony's conductor, the
tour is expected to cost $161,000, and
orchestra members are attempting to
raise over half of this amount.
