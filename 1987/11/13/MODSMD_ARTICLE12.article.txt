# New code may make mail zip

Stanford will gain a second zip code next
month in a Stanford Post Office effort to
decrease the amount of time needed to sort
and deliver mail campus-wide, according to
post office station manager David Gavino.
Post office boxholders were notified this
week that the zip code for their boxes will
change Dec. I from 94305 to 94309. Ken Mar,
a postal clerk here, said boxholders should not
worry that their mail will be lost if it does not
carry the correct zip code.
"Don't worry," he said. "There may be a
small time delay, but as long as it has the cor
rect P.O. box number, it will get to you."
With the installation of as many as 2000 new
boxes last spring, the total number of boxes in
the original zip code has reached 9050 â€” an
unusually large number of boxes for any pos
tal branch to handle, Gavino said. This has
caused delays in mail delivery by increasing
the volume of mail to be handled and
separated.
The new zip code will allow the San Fran
cisco Post Office, where all mail sent to Stan
ford is sorted, to separate the mail going to
Stanford into 94305 for dormitories and Stan
ford offices and 94309 for all Stanford boxes.
According to Mar, splitting Stanford into
two zip codes will greatly reduce the "primary
handling time" for mail in San Francisco.
