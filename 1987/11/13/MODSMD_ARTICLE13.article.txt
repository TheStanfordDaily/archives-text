Like many exclusive private clubs, the
Bohemian Club of San Francisco discriminates
against women and includes a negligible number
of minority members. Unlike most such clubs,
however, the Bohemian Club actively cultivates
an informal association with Stanford by allow
ing Stanford faculty to join at reduced rates and
without the customary wait. Nineteen men affili
ated with Stanford are members of the club.
The private lives of Stanford faculty members
are their own business. Principles of free speech
and free association require that individuals be
permitted to act like philistines or, by the same
token, Bohemians. These principles, however,
also entitle the Stanford community to express
its justifiable outrage about the tact that there
are Bohemians among us.
The Bohemian Club is an organization dedi
cated to elitism and sexism of the most reaction
ary variety. Its association with Stanford, albeit
informal, casts a poor reflection upon the Uni
versity. Persons affiliated with Stanford who are
members of the Bohemian Club or any other
such organization — although they are entitled
to do with their private lives as they wish —
should think seriously about how their participa
tion reflects on the University.
An additional point should also be made with
respect to the Bohemian Club issue. The club's
informal relationship to Stanford was recently

revealed as a result of a press conference called
by MEChA and the United Stanford Workers in
support of the Service Employees International
Union Local 2, which is involved in a labor
dispute with the Bohemian Club. While this fact
does not detract from the value of publicizing the
discriminatory practices of the Bohemian Club
and the club membership of persons from the
University, it once again casts Stanford students
in the role of articulating a position on an issue
while simultaneously serving as foot soldiers for
an outside organization that is pursuing another
agenda.
Local 2's primary interest is its labor dispute
with the Bohemian Club, not the club's discrimi
natory practices. The union has admitted that it
is attempting to exploit to its advantage student
outrage over the club's relationship with Stan
ford.
Similarly, the grape boycott that MEChA has
vigorously been promoting at Stanford, ostensi
bly because of the use of unsafe pesticides, has
been perceived by many as being linked to a
broader farm worker labor dispute with Califor
nia produce growers.
Student activism on these fronts is commen
dable, but Stanford students, and MEChA in
particular, should avoid the appearance of being
used as tools for outside interest groups, or they
may find that the legitimacy of their efforts will
be questioned and their effectiveness curtailed.
