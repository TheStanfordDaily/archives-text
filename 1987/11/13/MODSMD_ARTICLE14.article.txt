## Good life in Casa Zapata 
### 
Casa Zapata, the Chicano theme house located in
Stern Hall, is home to 95 residents. Forty-seven
percent of the residents are Chicano/Latino and 39
percent are white. The rest are black, Asian Ameri
can or Native American. The staff is composed of
four resident assistants and six theme associates
who organize a variety of social, political and cul
tural programs.
Zapata does all the programming that non-theme
houses do (Reach out Today, symphony trips, ski
trips and more) because it also has theme-related
programming (Ballet Folklorico performances,
Cinco de Mayo celebration, grape boycott presen
tations). The house programs give students a good
opportunity to discuss issues that our campus faces
today.

Casa Zapata

The main purpose behind Zapata's creation was
to form a support network so that Latinos from
predominantly Latino communities could better
deal with and understand the alien culture in which
they find themselves â€” Stanford. Subordinate to
this purpose was the experience that an individual
from another culture may receive by living in the
house. Unfortunately people do not understand
this concept of Zapata as a support network for
Chicano students and as a cultural learning experi
ence for those both inside and outside the house.
The misunderstanding of the concept of Zapata,
for those who have never lived here, can be attrib
uted to ignorance and misinformation. Letters to
the editor such as "Ethnic theme houses unfair"
and "Abolish theme houses" help perpetuate neg
ative stereotypes about Zapata. The people who
write these articles probably have never lived in a
theme house and have not visited one before

writing these articles. What business does anybody
have criticizing something which they know noth
ing about? How would they know if theme houses
are unfair? Have they ever lived in one? Maybe
what is unfair is that not everybody has the invalua
ble opportunity to experience such cross-cultural
learning as occurs in Zapata.
Those who are misinformed have been listening
to too many myths about Zapata. Some say that
Zapata house meetings are run in Spanish. Others
say that everyone in the house is Chicano/Latino.
Still others claim that Zapata is a hotbed for radical
politics. These claims are utter nonsense. Anyone
who has lived in the house or knows anything about
it would quickly refute these absurd claims.
Those ignorant and misinformed about theme
houses, like those on the Daily editorial board, call
Zapata self-segregationist. We challenge these
people to look at reality and see that it is they who
constantly live among their own race in the library,
at class, at the store and anywhere else on campus
except for the four ethnic theme houses and cul
tural centers.
The ethnic theme houses are the most well
integrated houses on campus and among the best
places to live, according to last year's residence
evaluations. Last year 98 percent of the Zapata res
idents turned in their evaluations with over 9i) per
cent of them saying Zapata was very supportive
and a great place to live. As someone's evaluation
put it, "Casa Zapata equals the Good Life."
In ending, we would like to mention that this
coming weekend is the "You Can Make a Differ
ence" conference. The conference will feature
various workshops including one on theme houses.
We encourage people to attend this workshop in or
der to learn at least a little about theme houses so
that they can have better informed opinions.
