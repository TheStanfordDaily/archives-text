GLAS fulfills
essential role for
gay community
As the governing body of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford (GLAS), we would like
to state that the letter titled
"Deserve equal rights only"
(Daily, Nov. 10) contains a num
ber of factual errors that need to
be corrected.
First, contrary to the author's
claims, GLAS is not funded by
Student Organization Services,
and the funding it receives from
the ASSU is only for its educa
tional, cultural and supportive
activities, not for its weekly so
cials or quarterly dances. Socials
and dances are self-supporting
through a small admission fee at
dances and a charge for
beverages at socials. Thus, while
GLAS does serve a social func
tion, the funds we receive from
the ASSU do not go toward so
cial activities.
As the author points out, fra
ternities do not receive funds
from the ASSU; the reason for
this is that they are primarily so
cial organizations whose mem
bership is not open to everyone.
In contrast, all GLAS events and
services are open to any inter
ested individual, regardless of
gender, age, race or sexual orien

tation. Perhaps the author of the
letter should have attended a
GLAS event before drawing the
incorrect conclusion that the fra
ternity system and GLAS are
equivalent organizations with
respect to the services they pro
vide.
One point that should he
stressed is the dire need for a stu
dent organization to provide the
gay, lesbian and bisexual com
munity with the social services
that uLAS does. While it is true
that theoretically many dorm and
fraternity functions are open to
us, if we were to attend one of
these parties with a date of the
same gender, we would be
opening ourselves up to possible
harassment, ridicule or physical
assault. For many members of
the Stanford gay, lesbian and
bisexual community, GLAS
dances and socials are among the
few on-campus social situations
where they can feel free to enjoy
themselves with those they care
about without fear of open hostil
ity.
A fundamental misunderstand
ing underlying the author's inac
curacies is his assumption that
we choose our sexual orienta
tion. We do not choose to be gay,
lesbian or bisexual any more than
straight people choose to be het
erosexual. Like other minorities
on campus, we are proud and
happy to be who we are, and we
band together to affirm and sup

port each other and to work for
positive social change.
The author's distinction of the
"real minorities" is artificial and
denies the reality of the om
nipresent homophobia (irrational
hatred of gay, lesbian and
bisexual people based on fear
and ignorance) that we live with
every day. One of the aims of
GLAS is to foster the under
standing necessary to end this
pressing problem.

No ASSU money
for social events
I am writing to respond to Mar
shall SchifTs letter (Nov. 10) in
which he discusses financial ar
rangements for GLAS. At this
time it would be helpful to clarify
tor Schiff, and for all those who
read his letter, the funding of
student-initiated activities at
Stanford.
The primary source of funding
for student organizations' operat
ing and programming expenses
here is the student body. It taxes
itself to support student activities
of an educational and cultural na
ture. Through the fee assessment

and ASSU discretionary proces
ses, the student body allocates
these funds to numerous student
organizations. Purely social ac
tivities do not qualify for these
funds.
It is the custom of the Univer
sity for departments to support
student-initiated programs that
are consonant with departmental
goals and criteria. Student Or
ganization Services (SOS) is one
such office. Departmental contri
butions, including those of this
office, are usually modest — for
example, $25 to support a
speaker series.
University offices and the
ASSU do not support purely so
cial events initiated by student
groups. We expect students to
pay for these things — dances,
parties and so on — out of their
own pockets through dues or
through charging admission at
the door. GLAS is no exception
to this expectation. GLAS
charges admission for its social
events.
Those interested in current in
formation about all aspects of
programming at Stanford, includ
ing funding, are encouraged to
stop by the Student Organization
Services office on the second
floor of Tresidder Union to pick
un a conv of our sourcebook.
