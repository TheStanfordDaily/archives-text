# Discovering public morality
## 
### 
The starting point for all existentialism is
recognition of the totality of possibility one has to
choose from at any moment. The facts of existence
and possibility are prior to the norms we daily
obey. They are prior to belief in God. They are
prior to everything but the levers at one's com
mand. At every instant one possesses unthinkable
power to commit evil and unthought of power to do
good. Existentialism is the psychological birth of
freedom and the beginning of adult moral insight.

By recognizing that possibility is prior to any
system of values, existentialism invites one to con
sider values anew. Faced with the bare facts of ex
istence, what is seen to be important? Twenty dif
ferent schools of existentialism have offered
twenty different answers. The bare facts of exis
tence have the potential to overwhelm reason, and
many non sequiturs have been held to follow from
them. But we can be existential about our existen
tialism and start at the beginning.
The planet earth is a pretty, blue pea spinning in
time and a space so empty that our solar system
may be the practical extent of our universe, yet so
vast that our solar system is but a grain of sand in a
sea of sand. Many existentialists have blown a fuse
right there. How can anything human be important
when we are so insignificant?
An economist can be of help. If it is problematic
to ask what is important, begin instead by asking
what is more important than what. Do not dread
whether all human accomplishment must be tran
sitory. It is enough to consider how transitory our
individual lives are compared to the permanence of
our peoples and our world.
From this perspective, any contribution to on
going mankind is more important than any tran
sitory vanity such as the pursuit of status for its
own sake or material accumulation for its own
sake. There is nothing ascetic about this concep
tion. It is not a matter of giving up one s pleasures
in order to make one's contribution. Rather, if one
is moved by an understanding of what is important,
then making a contribution is itself a pleasure.
Economics, the subject 1 study, limits itself to
taking ends as given and using reason to determine
how best to achieve those ends. But reason can
guide us to ends as well as means. Economics will
never fulfill its promise as the foundation of a
broader social science until it recognizes that.
Consider the distinction John Stuart Mill made
between democracy and majority rule. If represen
tative government merely represents competing
private interests, then majority rule degenerates
into tyranny of the majority. In Mill s ideal
democracy, reason is more important than num
bers, and the ultimate arbiter of public policy is

"the permanent interests of mankind. If people
can see to place a high value on what they achieve
for ongoing mankind, then Mill's ideal democracy
is a possibility.
What do we have today? A Congress stalemated
by private interests and a lawless executive
dominated by religious fundamentalism. But we
have had good government in the past, and we may
have it again.
Hannan Arendt, in her great book "The Human
Condition," offered a theory of how the public life
of a society either remains true to the public inter
est or gets overrun by private interests. She
believed man finds his liveliest interest, his true
self, in a public sphere where contributions to art
and wisdom are made and appreciated. Comple
mentary to this sphere she distinguished a private
sphere where individuals attend to their comfort
and security needs.
In Arendt's ideal scheme, the private sphere
would remain subsidiary, a springboard for par
ticipating in the public sphere. She believed this
ideal was attained in the Greek city states and in
other places where societies and men rose to great
ness. But the ideal is vulnerable to dislocations that
disrupt the underlying understanding of what is im
portant.
Arendt's assessment of modern society was that
dislocations had allowed the private sphere to
invade and dominate the public sphere. Thus we
enter the public sphere today typically not to make
a contribution but to sell what sells. We enter the
public sphere not to appreciate the contributions of
others but to have our appetites catered to. All in
terests are "economic" now.
That isn't as bleak a judgment as it sounds. Even
from a Diaspora the true public sphere can make its
contributions. But w hat does one do if one wants to
be a part of the solution rather than part of the
problem? The existentialist perspective shows us
how to value making a contribution. Theories of
Mill and Arendt reveal the importance of this
value. But few of us have any contribution to make
that will be recited down the ages. How do we
know what constitutes a contribution?
To help us discern what is a contribution, lm
manuel Kant provided us with a magnifying glass.
Kant's categorical imperative reads: "So act that
the maxim of your will could always hold at the
same time as a principle establishing universal
law." One is to project what would happen if
everyone acted as one is proposing to act. The ac
tion is to be taken only if one can approve of that
hypothetical world (i.e., if one can call the change a
contribution).
Suppose your physics professor makes a mistake
on the board. You are nervous at the thought of
pointing it out. Then you consider: "If everyone
who sees the mistake is too nervous to point it out,
the people who don't see it will get screwed up."
Now you know your duty. Kant's magnifying glass
has focused your fortitude as well as your under
standing, and you manage to interrupt. Out of such
small feats societies are made.
