### Mary Elizabeth McNitt Staff writer 
Singing a prayer for unity in his
native Sioux language, Orville
Looking Horse, keeper of the Sa
cred pipe of the Sioux Indians,
opened the "You Can Make a
Difference" conference last night
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Looking Horse's prayer sym
bolized the goals of this year's
conference organizers, who said
they hope their program will edu
cate the public about the problem
of institutional racism.
Following Looking Horse's
call to peace. University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy introduced
Elaine Jones — the assistant
counsel and manager of the
Washington. D.C., office of the
NAACP Legal Defense and Edu
cational Fund, Inc. — who spoke
to the packed auditorium on is
sues surrounding institutional
racism in American society.
" 'We the people' did not in
clude anyone who was not white,
not male and not adult," Jones
said in her address.
The "You Can Make a Differ
ence" conference is an annual,
student-organized event put on
by the Public Service Center in
conjunction with the University
and various community organiza
tions. A panel addressing per

spectives from the black,
Hispanic, Native American,
Asian-American and feminist
communities followed Jones'
remarks.
In her speech, Jones empha
sized that "the struggle for the
right to vote by minorities is a
classic example of institutional
racism.
"If history is any guide there
will once again be attempts to
dilute the minority vote," she
said.
The U.S. Constitution was
written to "make sure that most
of the rights that were there for
whites be denied to blacks,"
Jones said, adding that "we must
have personal contact with
people of different cultures and
different races. We're bound to
gether by certain values, but
we're still not doing very well in
the getting-to-know-you cate
gory."
Lee Brightman, director ot the
Native American Studies Pro
gram at Contra Costa College,
said, "Racism is on a drastic
rise" in the United States.
"White historians refuse to
break away from their Anglo-
Saxon background long enough
to write an objective history
book," he added.
Brightman said that Native
Americans are a "forgotten

people," historically viewed as
barriers to civilization. "Course
work about American Indians
will break down racial barriers,"
he said.
Former Governor of New
Mexico Toney Anaya said,
"We've had an administration
that disdains individuals south of
the border."
He named Congress as a prime
example of institutional racism,
and said that the main function of
U.S. immigration laws is "to put
a stop to the flow of Hispanics
and Asians into this country."
The former governor said
minorities will become the
majority population in Texas and
California within 40 years.
Minority communities should
therefore insist that they "be per
mitted to share in the power
structure of this country," he
said.
"Racism is part of the fabric of
American society," added
panelist John Taborn, associate
professor of Afro-American and
African Studies at the University
of Minnesota.
Taborn discussed prejudice in
the workplace and said, "We
have the tools and the knowledge
to combat it."

Elaine Jones, assistant counsel and of the Washington, D.C., office of the NAACP Legal Defense
and Educational Fund, spoke about institutional racism last night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Jones was the
keynote speaker for the opening of the "You Can Make a Difference" conference being held here this
weekend.
Co-chair of the San Francisco
Chinese Progressive Association
Mabel Teng attacked the "model
minority myth" that plagues
Asians. She called the myth
"dangerous and deceptive" and
urged the audience to view it in
its racist context.
Jing Lyman, the chair of the
National Advisory Council of
Stanford's Institute for Research
on Women and Gender, said, "I
come to this discussion carrying
the inevitable biases of my cul
ture and my personal experi
ences. We will be blind to institu
tional racism unless people from
other cultures will help us."
The evening wound down as
the panel responded to questions
from the audience and moderator
Carole Simpson, a senior corre
spondent with ABC.
Responses from Lyman and
Anaya urged whites to "do some
introspection" and to use their
numbers and credibility to take
leadership roles against racism.
"You Can Make a Difference"
conferences began at Stanford in
1984 and have in the past ad
dressed such issues as entrepre
neurship in the public interest,
world hunger and the future of
the family.
Conference co-coordinator
Licia Dorosin said she hoped this
year's conference, which contin
ues through Sunday, would help
Stanford students leave the
campus "racist free."
