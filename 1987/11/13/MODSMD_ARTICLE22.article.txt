## Golden Grants award diverse student talents 
### Ben Wecht 
This is the first in a two-part
series on the 1987 recipients of
the Golden Grants. The second
part will appear on Monday.

Shelley Sandusky, a double
major in English and political sci
ence, is conducting research on
Henry Fielding's literary transi
tion from drama to the novel.
Steve Dial, an economics and
art major, has created an entire
fantasy world in an artistic
medium called monotype.
Felicia Wong, a double major
in creative writing and political
science, is preparing a manu
script of close to 30 poems.
As diverse as these people and
their endeavors may sound, they
all share one honor in common.
Together with nine other Stan
ford students, they make up the
1987 recipients of the Golden
Grants for Humanities Scholar
ship and Creative Arts. The
Golden Grants are one of three
research grants made available to
Stanford undergraduates through
the Undergraduate Research Op
portunities (URO) program.
Sandusky, a senior, said she
became interested in her topic,
"Henry Fielding and the Change
in 18th Century Literary Form,"
when she took a course last year
on 18th century and Restoration
drama.
Fielding, who began his career
as a playwright in the 17305, was
forced to discover a new way to
pursue his writing when a satiri
cal play about the prime minister
that he wrote led to the creation

of a law that subjected all new
plays to review by the Royal cen
sor in England.
This same law closed Field
ing's own theater. Afterward,
Sandusky explained, "there was
not a lot dramatists could do."
Fielding "was forced to use an
other method of satire," she
said.

At this point Fielding invented
the modern novel with his first
book, "Shamela," a spoof on an
earlier romance, "Pamela." Ac
cording to Sandusky, such earlier
works do not qualify as novels
because they lack realism, which
is generally considered one of the
distinguishing characteristics of
the genre.
"The novel was more private
than the play, and [Fielding]
could say a lot more," Sandusky

said, adding that this project is
important because "Fielding's
own transition points to a
broader transition from drama to
the novel."
With the $2500 she received
from the grant, Sandusky went to
London last summer to conduct
research at the University of
London and the British Museum.
While there, she looked at some
journals from Fielding's time,
particularly the "Covent Garden
Journal," of which Fielding was
the editor in the early 17505.
Sandusky called the opportu
nity provided by the grant
"pretty amazing" and predicted
that "there are going to be more
people applying now because
there is more money" in the un
dergraduate grant program.
Dial, an artist who works in a
medium called monotype, de
scribed his project as "a series
on a theme that involves a fan
tasy world 1 invented."
Phis series incorporates a trop
ical world of creatures, such as
mermaids and fish, with some of
Dial's own experiences, includ
ing scenes from Venice, where he
traveled during his sophomore
year.
Dial is working on this project
outside of his regular course load
and not for credit. He said he
hopes to have 150 prints when he
is finished.
He briefly described monotype
as a process that involves paint
ing with etching ink onto a zinc
plate. Because no acid incisions
are being made, as is done in
engraving, multiple changes can
be made on the same plate.

making possible a progression.
Dial called Nathan Oliveira,
his academic adviser, "one of the
forerunners in the medium of
monotype." According to Dial,
monotype has existed for many
years but was not embraced as an
art form until the 19605, when the
work of artists such as Oliveira
drew attention to the medium.
Dial described his adviser.
Prof. Frank Lobdell of the Art
Department, as having been ex
tremely helpful, particularly with
regard to technical matters. "He
is very supportive," Dial said.
"He allows a lot of freedom and
offers good criticism."
Dial's $ 15(H) grant paid for all
the supplies necessary to com
plete the project.
He described the grant applica
tion process as "worth going
through" and reminded those
thinking of applying that even if
they don't win Golden Grants,
they can always be considered
for Small Grants, which allot
smaller amounts of money to in
dividuals' projects.
Wong's project goal is to write
a manuscript of 20 to 30 poems.
These poems — which largely
concern her father, a Chinese-
American who grew up in Geor
gia before civil rights legislation
was passed — are about "living
in a society that you're not even
a part of," she said.
Wong, a senior, explained
that, like the blacks of that gener
ation, her father "was discrimi
nated against and had to tight to
go to a white school."
Wong's grant enabled her to
attend a poetry conference in

Washington, D.C., last summer
that "really encouraged me to
continue writing poetry. It really
gave me a lot of confidence."
Wong, the youngest poet at the
conference, read some of her
work there, and others gave her
criticism.
Wong's advisers are John
Felstiner and Denise Levertov of
the English Department. She
sends her work periodically to
Levertov, who is in Cambridge
this quarter, and meets regularly
with Felstiner.
"Another good thing that hap
pened up in Washington," Wong
said, "is that 1 got interested in
how poetry interacts with
people's real lives and politics."
As a result of this interest,
Wong started the "Poetry, Prose
and Politics" lecture series at
Stanford this fall, which she
hopes will encourage writers "to
attempt to affect political is
sues." So far this quarter, the se
ries has featured writers Gwen
dolyn Brooks and Adrienne
Rich.
While expressing gratitude to
the Golden Grant program for
making possible the conference
and the lecture series, Wong also
called the process of applying
"relatively unstructured" and
said that, il possible, more grants
should be given out. "A lot of
really great writing was turned
down," she said of some appli
cants who applied but did not
receive grants.
Wong also stressed that stu
dents should utilize their faculty
advisers to "find out how you
can highlight your specialties and

emphasize your talents."
After graduation, Wong said
she plans to put aside poetry for a
while and work as a political con
sultant in Washington, D.C.
Robert Golden, retired chair
man and chief executive officer
of M. H. Golden Construction
Co. in San Diego, made the initial
donations that established the

Golden Grants. Two years ago he
endowed the University with $1
million, to he made available
each year in 12 individual grants
of up to $2500.
His gift also endowed the
Golden medals for excellence in
the humanities and the creative
arts, presented to seniors the day
before graduation.
"There seems to be an abun

dance of grants for engineers and
scientists." said Golden, a 1941
graduate of the University and
former president of the Stanford
Alumni Council. "I'm hoping
these grants in the arts and
humanities will encourage the
best and the brightest to come to
Stanford."
According to William Chace,
vice provost and a professor in

the English Department, Golden
had been giving money to the
University in the form of un
restricted grants for four or five
years before he decided to direct
his gifts exclusively to hu
manities honors students.
A big factor in this decision,
Chace said, was that ample funds
for students in the natural and so
cial sciences — the Firestone
Grants — already existed.
According to Laura Selznick,
direcor of the URO program, the
University's Centennial fund
raising efforts hope to raise $15
million of the desired $1.1 billion

for undergraduate research
grants. These include the Golden
Grants, the URO Major Grants
of up to $2500 and the Small
Grants for research expenses of
up to $S(M). With this year's $1
million gift from the Lane family,
together with Golden's endow
ment, the URO is two-fifteenths
of the way to making its goal.
Selznick said she is enthusias
tic about the effect the grant
money has had on students'
creativity. "Students can now
find ways of doing what they
really care about, and the results
are spectacular," she said.

Steve Dial works on the monotype project that he has paid for with the money from his (iolden (irant award.
The finished product will contain 150 prints of a fantasy world he created.
