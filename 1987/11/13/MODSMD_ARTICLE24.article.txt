What color is puce? Is it
green, purple, yellowish-green
or purple-red?
According to " Talking with
Steve," a show on X-'IV, Stan
ford's student-run television
channel, only a student named
Kat knew or guessed the right
answer. Or at least junior
David Kurt/., the show's host,
said he believed that Kat was
correct when she guessed
purple-red,
"Talking with Steve is just
your average obnoxious
reporter-on-the-street show,'"
said junior Michelle Chapman,
X-'lV's programming director,
of the show's irreverent for
mat. "They talk to anyone on
campus or in dorm rooms."
"It's a take-off of the David
Letterman remote segments,"
Kurtz said. "People can do
anything and try anything on
this campus. So we're looking
around and | finding that I things
are just funny."
Kurt/ and then senior Steve
Zahm started "Talking with
Steve" last year because Zahm
had his own camera equipment.
After filming an ROTC
change of command ceremony
for their first film project, the
pair decided that filming people
at parties and on campus could
be interesting because "people
say funny things under pres
sure," according to Kurtz.
Pia Keagy, a junior, became
the show's producer and
cameraperson after Zahm
graduated at the end of last
year.

Despite Zahm's departure,
the show, which airs Fridays at
10 p.m., still retains its original
name "just because," accord
ing to Keagy and Kurt/.
In search of material for the
show, Kurt/ walks around
campus and talks to anyone he
meets. "The people who just
stand there and won't talk are
actually the silliest," Keagy
said, adding that "the hams
who look for us can also he
pretty funny."
Both said that some of the
best stories they have encoun
tered were off camera.
For example, Kurtz and
Zahm last year went to tape the
people at the Grateful Dead
concert. "This guy who looked
like Christopher Lloyd was sel
ling hits of acid. When he asked
these people next to us if they
wanted some, they answered.
No, we're from Portland.'
Keagy also remembers enter
ing one of the dorms and scar
ing a student named Joe. "His
friends took us into the bath
room where he was about to
take a shower. When David
(Kurtz) asked, if he wanted to
talk to us, Joe yanked the
shower curtain around him. He
thought we were filming him
when he had no clothes on."
One funny scene they did
manage to tape was of someone
describing the worst place to
have an itch. "He told us his
colon and started to describe
how you would itch it," Keagy
said. "It sounds disgusting, but
it's really funny."
The show used to tape
people in White Plaza;

however, just about everyone
would avoid the cameras once
they knew they were being
filmed. "The girls especially
don't like to be on camera; but
guys don't seem to mind as
much," Keagy said.
Instead of filming in the cen
ter of campus, "we try to get
people in situations where they
can't leave," Keagy said.
"Usually in dorm rooms or in
eating situations" are the best
places to corner people, she
added.
Although Chapman de
scribed them as an obnoxious
reporting team, Kurtz and
Keagy do not see themselves as
overbearing. "We don't want
to insult people, and Dave is
not an obnoxious person,'"
Keagy said.
"But if someone is giving me
a hard time or acting like a
sourpuss, I don't mind shoving
him around on camera," Kurtz
said, adding that he also "likes
to get people who have a great
sense of their own importance"
on camera.
The "Talking with Steve'"
shows, based on a question,
place or theme, usually take
two hours to film. There is no
editing, Kurtz said, explaining
that he ' * [trusts] Pia to know
which are the funny parts."
Despite the haphazard con
tent of their show, Keagy and
Kurtz agreed that "Talking
with Steve" has a goal. "We
hope that someday one of the
people on camera will be run
ning for (some public) office
and this show will ruin their
career," Kurtz said.
