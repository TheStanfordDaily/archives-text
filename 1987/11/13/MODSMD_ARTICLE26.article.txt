## 'Less Than Zero' is a less-than-perfect movie 
### Jennifer Reese Staff writer 
The movie version of Bret Eas
ton Ellis' novel "Less than
Zero" will disappoint those who
want a faithful rendering of the
book. What distinguished the
novel was the moral emptiness of
all its characters — including the
narrator, who was as soulless,
sexually ambivalent and druggy
as everyone else in the book. Los
Angeles was depicted as a was
teland of decadent, confused
kids.
The movie changes the nar
rator. Clay, into a collegiate
straight-arrow who comes home
for Christmas to find his high
school friends being sucked into
a whirlpool of drugs, clubs and
prostitution. He's a hero trying
to rescue his best friend and
girlfriend from the hollow and
dangerous lives they're leading.
This is a fundamental change
from the novel, and in a lot of
ways an improvement. The
movie has more heart than the
novel and seems less flimsy. At
least it tries to come to conclu
sions: at least it tries to say some
thing. At least now there's a
character to draw us into the
story. The movie isn't as
bleached out as the book.
But it manages to fail in its own
unique way. Ellis' novel was a
trendy, shallow book with some
lurid subject matter. The movie
is hyped-up, heavy-handed and
moralizes to the point of
stupidity. Which is worse? A
junky, empty book or a clumsy,
glossy movie?
The blame for the movie's fail
ure goes to the screenwriters,
who didn't use their brains or im
aginations. Once again, a poten
tially fascinating piece of mate

rial is botched up by a corny,
patchy script.
Clay, played by Andrew
McCarthy, comes home to Los
Angeles from his Eastern col
lege. He's a good guy with his
feet on the ground. His friends,
though, are all going wrong,
driven to drugs and promiscuity
by neglectful parents. The movie
is a portrait of rich kids with no
values and of Clay's attempts to
keep things together.

The blame for the
movie's failure goes to
the screenwriters who
didn't use their brains
or imaginations.

Julian, Clay's best friend, has
gotten involved in some bad busi
ness deals and now owes a ruth
less drug dealer/pimp large sums
of money. He's been kicked out
of his house by his father and
lives on cocaine and alcohol,
earning money, we discover, as a
prostitute.
Blair, Clay's girlfriend, is mod
eling and doing a lot of drugs.
She's also had a fling with Julian.
She's going down the tubes when
Clay arrives; it's up to the goody
goody Clay to set things straight.
There are nuggets of good ma
terial in "Less than Zero." There
are some startling and
memorable scenes here, but no
thanks should be offered to the
screenwriters. The power of
these scenes comes primarily
from their shocking visual im
pact. There is a very loud and
disgusting episode when Julian,
drunk and coked-up, vomits for a

long time into a metal can. This is
the most repulsive and close-up
vomit seen i have ever seen, for
whatever that's worth. It's also
actually one of the most original
scenes in the movie, though quite
unpleasant to watch.
In another ugly episode a
pretty girl's nose starts to drip
blood because she's been doing
too much coke. "Rusty pipes
. . she says, giggling. This is
bizarre and disturbing; it sticks in
the memory.
Then there's the scene where
Julian is dragged nude from the
bedroom of a man he's been paid
to have sex with. His eyes are
wildly made-up, and there's
white foam caked at the corner of
his mouth. Revolting scenes like
these are the gems of the movie,
so to speak. Most of this film is
predictable, preachy and glossy;
the hideous scenes are the best
because they shake you out of
your stupor and make you at
tentive, it not appalled.
By contrast, when Blair dumps
her coke down the drain of a sink
it looks like an anti-drug pitch —
which is probably what it is. Un
fortunately, the message lacks
subtlety and is poorly conveyed.
In how many movies and televi
sion shows have we watched
characters throwing their drugs
down the drain? Too many.
The interaction between the
kids and their neglectful parents
is also a cliche; it puts all the
blame on the parents, who are
reduced to the stereotyped
images of wealthy, uncaring par
ents. This is simple-minded and
irritating.
Finally, the sex scenes in this
movie are painful to watch. The
volume of the music is turned up
and odd camera angles are used,
probably trying to convey the

passion and urgency of youth.
The only effect achieved is jar
ring, phony and embarrassing.
The scenes should have been cut
or at least toned down.
Despite some awful moments,
the acting in this movie is ex
tremely good. Why can't talented
actors be handed decent scripts?
Robert Downey Jr. is excellent
as Julian. What he does is almost
heroic. He takes a thankless role
in a skimpy movie, and in pitiful
scenes he manages to be compel
ling. His messed-up, lively Julian
becomes the most interesting
character in the movie.
Andrew McCarthy as Clay is

believable and appealing, which
is all the part demands. Maybe he
could have done more with it, but
in a movie like this that could be
asking too much.
Jami Gertz is fine as the
glamorous, coked-up Blair.
Sometimes she seems whiney
and plastic, but other times she
gets it right.
In a small but important role is
Robert Stabler as the smooth,
mean pimp/drug dealer. He's
great to watch. With actors like
these and better writers, "Less
than Zero" could have been a
pretty good movie.
It's easy to point out good

things about almost any movie.
One movie may raise an interest
ing question, another may have a
great actor in it, another may
have one or two really beautiful
scenes or funny lines. Few have
absolutely nothing going for
them. But few manage to get it all
riuht at once, and unless the
whole package is good, a movie
isn't the experience it should be.
There are some super perfor
mances in "Less than Zero" and
some patches of interesting mate
rial, but in between these patches
is some very dumb and forget
table stuff. Yes, another med
iocre movie.

is also a cliche; it puts all the
blame on the parents, who are
reduced to the stereotyped
images of wealthy, uncaring par
ents. This is simple-minded and
irritating.
Finally, the sex scenes in this
movie are painful to watch. The
volume of the music is turned up
and odd camera angles are used,
probably trying to convey the

passion and urgency of youth.
The only effect achieved is jar
ring, phony and embarrassing.
The scenes should have been cut
or at least toned down.
Despite some awful moments,
the acting in this movie is ex
tremely good. Why can't talented
actors be handed decent scripts?
Robert Downey Jr. is excellent
as Julian. What he does is almost
heroic. He takes a thankless role
in a skimpy movie, and in pitiful
scenes he manages to be compel
ling. His messed-up, lively Julian
becomes the most interesting
character in the movie.
Andrew McCarthy as Clay is

believable and appealing, which
is all the part demands. Maybe he
could have done more with it, but
in a movie like this that could be
asking too much.
Jami Gertz is fine as the
glamorous, coked-up Blair.
Sometimes she seems whiney
and plastic, but other times she
gets it right.
In a small but important role is
Robert Stabler as the smooth,
mean pimp/drug dealer. He's
great to watch. With actors like
these and better writers, "Less
than Zero" could have been a
pretty good movie.
It's easy to point out good

things about almost any movie.
One movie may raise an interest
ing question, another may have a
great actor in it, another may
have one or two really beautiful
scenes or funny lines. Few have
absolutely nothing going for
them. But few manage to get it all
riuht at once, and unless the
whole package is good, a movie
isn't the experience it should be.
There are some super perfor
mances in "Less than Zero" and
some patches of interesting mate
rial, but in between these patches
is some very dumb and forget
table stuff. Yes, another med
iocre movie.

Naughty and nice: Robert Downey Jr. and Andrew McCarthy as friends in "Less I han Zero."
The movie version of Bret Eas
ton Ellis' novel "Less than
Zero" will disappoint those who
want a faithful rendering of the
book. What distinguished the
novel was the moral emptiness of
all its characters — including the
narrator, who was as soulless,
sexually ambivalent and druggy
as everyone else in the book. Los
Angeles was depicted as a was
teland of decadent, confused
kids.
The movie changes the nar
rator. Clay, into a collegiate
straight-arrow who comes home
for Christmas to find his high
school friends being sucked into
a whirlpool of drugs, clubs and
prostitution. He's a hero trying
to rescue his best friend and
girlfriend from the hollow and
dangerous lives they're leading.
This is a fundamental change
from the novel, and in a lot of
ways an improvement. The
movie has more heart than the
novel and seems less flimsy. At
least it tries to come to conclu
sions: at least it tries to say some
thing. At least now there's a
character to draw us into the
story. The movie isn't as
bleached out as the book.
But it manages to fail in its own
unique way. Ellis' novel was a
trendy, shallow book with some
lurid subject matter. The movie
is hyped-up, heavy-handed and
moralizes to the point of
stupidity. Which is worse? A
junky, empty book or a clumsy,
glossy movie?
The blame for the movie's fail
ure goes to the screenwriters,
who didn't use their brains or im
aginations. Once again, a poten
tially fascinating piece of mate

rial is botched up by a corny,
patchy script.
Clay, played by Andrew
McCarthy, comes home to Los
Angeles from his Eastern col
lege. He's a good guy with his
feet on the ground. His friends,
though, are all going wrong,
driven to drugs and promiscuity
by neglectful parents. The movie
is a portrait of rich kids with no
values and of Clay's attempts to
keep things together.

The blame for the
movie's failure goes to
the screenwriters who
didn't use their brains
or imaginations.

Julian, Clay's best friend, has
gotten involved in some bad busi
ness deals and now owes a ruth
less drug dealer/pimp large sums
of money. He's been kicked out
of his house by his father and
lives on cocaine and alcohol,
earning money, we discover, as a
prostitute.
Blair, Clay's girlfriend, is mod
eling and doing a lot of drugs.
She's also had a fling with Julian.
She's going down the tubes when
Clay arrives; it's up to the goody
goody Clay to set things straight.
There are nuggets of good ma
terial in "Less than Zero." There
are some startling and
memorable scenes here, but no
thanks should be offered to the
screenwriters. The power of
these scenes comes primarily
from their shocking visual im
pact. There is a very loud and
disgusting episode when Julian,
drunk and coked-up, vomits for a

long time into a metal can. This is
the most repulsive and close-up
vomit seen i have ever seen, for
whatever that's worth. It's also
actually one of the most original
scenes in the movie, though quite
unpleasant to watch.
In another ugly episode a
pretty girl's nose starts to drip
blood because she's been doing
too much coke. "Rusty pipes
. . she says, giggling. This is
bizarre and disturbing; it sticks in
the memory.
Then there's the scene where
Julian is dragged nude from the
bedroom of a man he's been paid
to have sex with. His eyes are
wildly made-up, and there's
white foam caked at the corner of
his mouth. Revolting scenes like
these are the gems of the movie,
so to speak. Most of this film is
predictable, preachy and glossy;
the hideous scenes are the best
because they shake you out of
your stupor and make you at
tentive, it not appalled.
By contrast, when Blair dumps
her coke down the drain of a sink
it looks like an anti-drug pitch —
which is probably what it is. Un
fortunately, the message lacks
subtlety and is poorly conveyed.
In how many movies and televi
sion shows have we watched
characters throwing their drugs
down the drain? Too many.

is also a cliche; it puts all the
