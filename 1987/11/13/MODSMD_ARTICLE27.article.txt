# Nolte good in tumbling 'Weeds'
## 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
Another fine Nick Nolte per
formance is wasted in another
mediocre movie.
Nolte (alls into the category of
actors like Burt Reynolds and
Clint Eastwood, who never seem
to be in movies worthy of their
talents. In films like "North Dal
las Forty," "Who'll Stop the
Rain?" "48 Hours" and "Down
and Out in Beverly Hills," Nolte
has proved his prowess as an ac
tor, hut he hasn't been able to
tind that one special film that
might catapult him to the top and
land him an Oscar nomination.
In his latest well-intentioned
effort, called "Weeds," Nolte
comes really close to the mark.
His performance is realistic, in
tense and full of heart. Unfortun
ately, the film itself does not
share these qualities. "Weeds"
is long, predictable and con
trived, and it lacks the dramatic
punch it could have had.
Nolte plays Lee Umsetter, a
convict sentenced to life at San
Quentin without the possibility of
parole. As the movie begins,
Umsetter, having lost the will to
live, decides to get out of prison
the only way he can â€” by com
mitting suicide.
In his first attempt he takes a

45-foot plunge from the top of a
cell block, but survives. Next, he
tries to hang himself, but that
doesn't work either. Since he
can't seem to kill himself, he
directs his energies elsewhere.
Umsetter goes to the prison li
brary and asks for a "thick
book;" he ends up checking out
"War and Peace." For a guy
who says he only has a sixth
grade education, reading
Tolstoy's epic will not be an easy
task. But Umsetter's got plenty
of time.
After he finally finishes "War
and Peace,'' he asks for more
books. He then begins scaling a
literary mountain, reading au
thors like Nietzsche.
Inspired by all the great works
he has read he writes a play
about prison life and manages to
get San Quentin to let him stage it
as entertainment for the pris
oners. At the first performance, a
glamorous San Francisco theater
critic happens to be in atten
dance, anu she immediately falls
in love with the play, and with
Umsetter.
The critic, played by Rita Tag
gart, subsequently spearheads a
campaign all the way to the
governor's office to get Umsetter
out of prison. Before you can say
Shakespeare, Umsetter's a free
man, performing his play with his

Barbed Wire acting troupe for
college audiences and, later, at
an off-Broadway theater.
The movie is loosely based on
the life of Rick Cluchey, an ex
convict win) founded the San
Quentin Drama Group. Accord
ing to the studio's press release,
director John Hancock ("Bang
the Drum Slowly") insists that
Lee Umsetter is not Rick Cluc
hey. Hancock says that "the
story began with a basis in truth,
then took off on its own energy."
Apparently, this means that
everything else in the movie is
made up.
That certainly would explain a
lot, especially since many of the
prison scenes don't quite ring
true. The San Quentin inmates
seem to be a well-mannered,
even-tempered lot, as if their
only crimes were jaywalking and
not knowing on which side of the
plate the salad fork goes. Even
during the performances of Um
setter's play, they sit up straight,
they're quiet and well-behaved,
and they receive the play with
joyful enthusiasm.
Umsetter's play is supposed to
be about the horrifying,
dehumanizing aspects of being
locked up in prison, but prison at
San Quentin doesn't seem to be
so bad, especially since all the
inmates appear to be buddies.

and the guards never rough up
anyone.
The only scene that suggests
the rowdiness and violence of
prison life comes near the end of
the film when a riot breaks out
(which doesn't even take place at
San Quentin), but the action
comes far too late to turn things
around for this film.
Despite the contrivances and
implausibilities in the script, the
cast, along with Nolte, is uni
formly excellent. Rita Taggart
manages to inject life into her
thankless role as the theater
critic; Bill Forsythe is appropri
ately funny and pathetic as a
bumbling shoplifter; and it's too
bad that we couldn't have seen
more of Joe Mantegna in his
small role as an off-Broadway ac
tor who joins the prison troupe.
It's also too bad that we
couldn't have seen more of the
play that Umsetter writes in
"Weeds." We only see bits and
pieces of the production during
its many performances, and at
times it looks a lot more interest
ing than the movie itself.
Some critics have referred to
Nolte's work in this movie as
"the performance of a lifetime."
Hopefully, in the near future
Nolte will be able to give another
"performance of a lifetime" in a
better movie.
