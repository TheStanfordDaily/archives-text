# Trendy, acid-washed denim is a sign of our times
## 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
The latest fashion trend to
sweep the Stanford campus is the
appearance of acid-washed
denim.
Wait, what is this? A fashion
column in The Daily? In The
Stanford Daily? Who at Stanford
cares about fashion? Aside from
a ragged sweatshirt, faded 5()ls,
old Reeboks and a pair of Ray
Bans, how much more fas
hionable does a Stanford student
need to get?
Actually, there are quite a few
Stanford students who are smart,

unique dressers. Then again, you
see a lot of scruffy grad student
types who are perfectly content
to be wearing the latest in tie-dye
T-shirts and brown sandals.
Now, don't send me letters;
there's nothing wrong with dress
ing like that, especially if you're
stuck in a 1960s time warp.
I have to admit, though, that
my contempt for 60s fashions
isn't as strong as my absolute
aversion to fashions from the
70s. Remember the '70s, when
guys used to wear those
polyester leisure suits with the
shirts that had the collars so wide
they looked like starched wings?
Anytime I see somebody who

still wears a leisure suit, I feel
like I'm going to have a stroke.
Even with leisure suits, Stan
ford has always been on top of
the latest fashions, no matter
how bad they were. A few years
back, paisley was trendy. Re
member paisley? Those were the
patterns that looked like little
sperm cells that floated around as
designs on shirts, skirts, ties,
purses or whatever.
For men. there were those hor
rible madras shirts. Madras were
those summery plaid shirts that
had ungodly, clashing colors ar
ranged in such a way that it
looked like someone puked up 31

tlavors of sherbet.
The latest fashion trend to hit
Stanford thankfully doesn't look
so bad. In fact, acid-washed
denim (a.k.a. blasted denim,
whitewashed denim, distressed
denim) looks terrific, especially
when it's worn by women in the
form of miniskirts or jackets. It
epitomizes the cool, hip. tough,
inner-city urban look.
Acid-washed denim is one of
those concepts where you ask,
why hasn't anyone thought of
this before? After all, the idea be
hind it is very simple. All you do
is take good denim, wash it in a
special bleach in order to make it
look rough, worn-out and 10

years older than it actually is,
and then you sell it for $20 more
than regular denim.
When you think about it, acid
washed denim is not only a hot
fashion item, it is also a metaphor
for contemporary society.
Whereas the '70s were called the
"me" decade, the '80s are being
called the "re-" decade, in which
everything old is made new
again.
Acid-washed denim fits per
fectly into the scheme of things
as an example of the art of recy
cling, ingenuity and the capitalist
mentality.
Since denim is a durable, prac

tical fashion item that will proba
bly never go out of style, there's
no telling how long the acid
washed look will last. It may last
through the rest of the '80s, but I
don't think it will last any longer.
The market is already sat
urated with acid-washed items —
even K-Mart sells acid-washed
jeans. Eventually people will
start to get sick of blasted denim.
Prices will fall, it will disappear
from stores, and the fashion con
scious will have to look for a new
trend to reflect the changing
times.
Anything but a return to
polyester leisure suits will be
fine.

like I'm going to have a stroke.
Even with leisure suits, Stan
ford has always been on top of
the latest fashions, no matter
how bad they were. A few years
back, paisley was trendy. Re
member paisley? Those were the
patterns that looked like little
sperm cells that floated around as
designs on shirts, skirts, ties,
purses or whatever.
For men. there were those hor
rible madras shirts. Madras were
those summery plaid shirts that
had ungodly, clashing colors ar
ranged in such a way that it
looked like someone puked up 31

tlavors of sherbet.
The latest fashion trend to hit
Stanford thankfully doesn't look
so bad. In fact, acid-washed
denim (a.k.a. blasted denim,
whitewashed denim, distressed
denim) looks terrific, especially
when it's worn by women in the
form of miniskirts or jackets. It
epitomizes the cool, hip. tough,
inner-city urban look.
Acid-washed denim is one of
those concepts where you ask,
why hasn't anyone thought of
this before? After all, the idea be
hind it is very simple. All you do
is take good denim, wash it in a
special bleach in order to make it
look rough, worn-out and 10

years older than it actually is,
and then you sell it for $20 more
than regular denim.
When you think about it, acid
washed denim is not only a hot
fashion item, it is also a metaphor
for contemporary society.
Whereas the '70s were called the
"me" decade, the '80s are being
called the "re-" decade, in which
everything old is made new
again.
Acid-washed denim fits per
fectly into the scheme of things
as an example of the art of recy
cling, ingenuity and the capitalist
mentality.
Since denim is a durable, prac

tical fashion item that will proba
bly never go out of style, there's
no telling how long the acid
washed look will last. It may last
through the rest of the '80s, but I
don't think it will last any longer.
The market is already sat
urated with acid-washed items —
even K-Mart sells acid-washed
jeans. Eventually people will
start to get sick of blasted denim.
Prices will fall, it will disappear
from stores, and the fashion con
scious will have to look for a new
trend to reflect the changing
times.
Anything but a return to
polyester leisure suits will be
fine.
