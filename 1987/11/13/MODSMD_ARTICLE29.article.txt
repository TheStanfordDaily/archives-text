## Beavers will test Cardinal pass defense 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
The Oregon State football team's strength is the
pass. Stanford's weakness is pass defense.
In fact, the Beavers (0-5 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, 2-7 overall) average 308.9 yards passing per
game, tops in the Pac-10, while the Cardinal (2-4, 3-
6) gives up 265.1 yards per contest, the most in the
league.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway announced earlier in
the week that he may shake up the defense for to
morrow's 1:30 p.m. game at Corvallis and indicated
personnel changes at free safety and inside line
backer might be made. "We realize we've had a
problem with the forward pass," Elway said.
That could be a big problem against Beaver quar
terback Erik Wilhelm. The junior is sixth in the na
tion in total offense with 261.2 yards per game and
leads the Pac-10 in both total offense and passing
with 272.2 yards per contest. On the year, Wilhelm
has completed 55 percent of his passes for 2450
yards and 16 touchdowns. He has been intercepted
14 times, however.
Wilhelm holds 32 different school and confer
ence records and is now 10th on the Pac-10 career
passing list. He needs only four yards today to hop
over former Stanford quarterback Guy Benjamin
and into ninth place.
The only question mark about Wilhelm is his
health. The Oregon State quarterback has been
hampered by a sprained ankle for two weeks and
left last Saturday's game against UCLA when it
became apparent the Bruins (who won 52-17) were
running away with the game.
"He went into the ball game far less than 1 (K) per
cent," Oregon State Coach Dave Kragthorpe said.
"He wasn't the same Erik Wilhelm we're used to
having on the football field. He progressed through
the week, but he never really entered into the of
fense. So we got him out of the ball game when it
was out of reach."
Wilhelm has a pair of talented receivers to throw
to. Junior flanker Robb Thomas (5.89 catches per
?;ame) and sophomore tight end Phil Ross (5.67) are
irst and second in the Pac-10 respectively in recep

tions. Thomas has 822 yards and 10 touchdowns —
he's tied with UCLA's Gaston Green for the league
lead in that category — on 53 catches this year,
while Ross has picked up 566 yards in receptions
and caught three touchdown passes.
"They're both having fine years, Kragthorpe
said. "Thomas has so many attributes. He's got a
great motor, and he's always running, Those kind
of things pay off and get production."
Tailback Brian Taylor is ranked second in the
Pac-10 in all-purpose yards (156.2 yards per game)
and kickoff returns (24 yards per return). Ihe
junior has caught 41 passes for 310 yards and one
score and is the leading Oregon State rusher with
400 yards on 87 carries.
The offensive line has a standout in center Dave
Orndorff, rated the third- best in the country at his
position by a recent publication. Senior guard Paul
Hopkins is also solid.
On defense, highly touted safety Lavance Nor
thington has missed some games with, of course,
an ankle injury, but junior free safety Andre Harris
has picked up the slack and leads the squad with
111 tackles. Tackle Rich Haggerty has four sacks
on the year.
"Oregon State has a multiple defense, and they
will create the big play," Elway said. "They do a
lot more blitzing than teams we've seen recently.
Of course, they've had a lot of points scored
against them, too."
Opposing teams are averaging 39 points per game
against Oregon State, in fact, while the vaunted
"Air Express" is scoring at a clip of only 20.2
points. Last year against the Cardinal the Beavers
tallied just one touchdown in Stanford's 17-7 win,
as the Cardinal defense held Wilhelm to just 51
yards passing, the lowest total of his career.
After last year's loss at Corvallis, Kragthorpe is
understandably concerned about the Cardinal
defense, despite Stanford's ineffectiveness against
the pass. "Their stats don't look that great, but I
feel they play good defense," Kragthorpe said.
"We'll have to get our offense cranked up to score
points against them."
