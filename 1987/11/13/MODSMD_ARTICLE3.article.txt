# ASSU to begin straw poll
## Phone poll will gauge student views on issues 
### Sky Gallegos 
In an attempt to "incorporate
student opinion into the ASSU"
the ASSU plans to conduct a
straw poll next week of student
views on campus issues, accord
ing to Council of Presidents
member Jim Durkin.
The poll is being conducted to
"help the ASSU make deci
sions," according to Durkin,
who originated the idea for the
poll. "When we're trying to
decide a bill, it would be con
venient to have statistics (from
the poll) on that bill." He added
that the poll may also include
questions designed to gauge stu
dent opinion on general campus
issues such as the pass/no credit
option.
The projected cost for the poll
is about $4000, according to
Durkin. " This project, as is true
of many other ASSU projects, is
funded by profits from business

activities, not student fees. And
in comparison to an election, the
cost isn't much," he said.
According to Pattie Marby, co
ordinator of the straw poll, "the
statistics can be used for a mil
lion things. Besides the immedi
ate reactions, we're still debating
what the poll can be used for,"
she said.
Using a computer program, the
ASSU has generated a list of ran
domly selected student phone
numbers to be used in the poll.
In designing the poll, organi
zers consulted the Statistics De
partment and Political Science
Prof. Richard Brody, who has
done professional phone survey
ing. " This sample is designed to
be representative of the student
body," Brody said of the ASSU
poll.
According to Durkin, the poll
ing procedure is nothing uncom
mon.
'"It's a statistical method of

ten used, and the people on the
list will he called repeatedly until
they are reached," Durkin said.
According to ASSU Senate
Chair Dave Smolen, the proposal
to conduct the poll faced some
opposition in the senate prior to
its approval last month.
Smolen said senators debated
whether to have the poll because
of uncertainty as to how it should
be funded.
Poll organizers originally pro
posed that funding come from
student fees. The senate,
however, stipulated that all costs
for the project should be paid out
of revenues from ASSU business
projects.
"At first the accuracy of the
poll was also questioned,"
Smolen said. "But now we have
no qualms about it."
"Another concern is whether
the poll as a Stanford activity w ill
continue or die out," Smolen
added.
