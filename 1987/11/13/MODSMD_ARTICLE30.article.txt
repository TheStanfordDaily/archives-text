Basketball European style will
once again invade Maples
Pavilion this weekend when the
Stanford men's team hosts the
Swedish Malbas club team Sun
day at 7:30 p.m.
Last year the Cardinal also
opened its season against an Old
World foe, defeating the Nor
wegian national team 93-81.
The Malbas team hails from
Malmo, Sweden, a city with a
population of 250,000. The Mal
bans are currently ranked 10th
among European club teams.
Two nights ago, however, the
Swedes were routed by the St.
Mary's Gaels 80-39. Tonight they
visit San Jose State, and tomor
row they play the University of
San Francisco.
Sten Feldreich, a 6-foot-10
center, leads the Swedes.
Feldreich is familiar with Ameri
can college basketball — he
started for several years at Mich
igan State.
For Stanford, Sunday night
will be the first time the 1987-88
Cardinal players will face an
other squad. Tuesday, Stanford
put in a sub-par performance

during the annual Cardinal-White
intrasquad scrimmage. At least
Stanford fans should hope it was
a sub-par performance.
Words like "sloppy" and
"nervous"' were used to describe
the play in the scrimmage.
Everybody involved was disap
pointed with the opening night
performance. The Cardinal
seemed to struggle without
senior Eric Reveno, who has red
shirted this season after recent
back surgery.
Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery will probably start
four juniors on Sunday: Todd
Lichti and Terry Taylor at guard,
and Brian McSweeney and
Howard Wright at forward.
Senior Greg Butler will start at
center.
Stanford will open its Ameri
can season over Thanksgiving at
the Hawaiian Airlines/Maui Clas
sic. The Cardinal's first round
game is against former Stanford
Coach Tom Davis and his lowa
Hawkeyes. The other teams in
the tournament will be Kansas,
Villanova, Illinois. Nebraska,
Baylor and Chaminade.
The Cardinal's home opener is
Dec. I at Santa Clara.
