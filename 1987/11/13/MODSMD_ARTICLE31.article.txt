### 
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery has announced that high
school seniors Adam Keefe,
Peter Dukes and Paul Garrett
have signed letters of intent to
play hoops on the Farm next
season.
Keefe is the prize catch. The 6-
foot 9, 225-pound forward from
Woodbridge High School in
Irvine carried his team to the
state Division II championship
last season, averaging 22.5 points
and 12.5 rebounds per game.
Keefe is the first big-time
recruit Montgomery has gar
nered since he took over as head
coach last season.
"Adam has been our No. I
recruit since this basketball
coaching staff arrived at Stan
ford," Montgomery said. "He is
an outstanding student athlete
who is recognized as the top
recruit in the West and as one of
the top five in the nation."
Keefe chose Stanford over
North Carolina, Duke, California
and Notre Dame. "Stanford is
considered the No. I university
in the United States, and that
was the key to my decision," he

said.
Dukes, u 6-3, 170-pound guard,
attends Roosevelt High School in
Seattle, Wash. He averaged 16.5
points, seven assists and five
rebounds per game as he led
Roosevelt to a second-place
finish in the state tournament last
year.
Garrett is a senior at Palisades
High School in Southern Califor
nia. A 6-9, 230-pound for
ward/center, Garrett last year
averaged 17 points and 10
rebounds per game as his team
compiled a 15-7 record and
gained a berth in the L.os Angeles
city playoffs.
"Stanford appealed to me be
cause of the campus, its aca
demic reputation and the chance
to play in the Pac-10," Garrett
said.
According to Montgomery,
"Paul is a good, young big man
who possesses outstanding po
tential. He has good hands, ex
cellent court awareness and good
offensive skills. Like most young
big men he needs to pick up in
the strength department, but that
will come with maturity."
