# Field hockey faces Northwestern in NCAAs
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
This is what makes it all
worthwhile: the NCAAs.
All of the Stanford field
hockey team's hard work, deter
mination and execution through
out the year has led the squad to

its third consecutive NCAA tour
nament appearance. The Cardi
nal now travels to lowa with
hopes of earning its first-ever
Final Four berth.
"1 know we have the capabil
ity of reaching the Final Four,"
Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson
said. "We're playing very well
now, and we are ready for the

playoffs." Certainly the Cardi
nal, which finished the year at 10-
5-1, is in a better position this
year heading into postseason
play than it has been in the past.
Stanford enters the tourna
ment with a much more
preparatory regular season be
hind it. Besides two early East
Coast road trips, the Northern

Pacific Conference was also
much tougher. Witness that Stan
ford, at 6-1-1, finished a mere
one-half game ahead of Califor
nia in the final league standings.
San Jose State was only a game
back and would have tied for the
league championship had the
Spartans won their final game of
the season.
Having played such a tough
schedule can do nothing hut help
the Cardinal heading into
postseason play. Especially criti
cal is the fact that Stanford has
already played Northwestern
its first round opponent — and
beaten the Wildcats 1-0 Sept. 11.
"We played our best game of
the year against Northwestern."
Johnson said. "The fact that we
beat them before gives our team
confidence heading into the game
this weekend."
The contest against the
Wildcats was the first game of
Stanford's initial three-game
roadswing at the beginning of the
season. I he Cardinal went 2-1 on
the trip, limiting its opponents to
only two goals, and set the tone
for the rest of the season.
Stanford finished the North
western tournament with a solid
3-1 victory over Ball State before
the team came home to beat
Pacific 3-0 and run its conference
record to 2-0. Then it was time
for the team to experience the
heated competition of New Eng
land.
It didn't go well.
Stanford went 1-2 between
Sept. 24-27, scoring only one

goal in the process. The Cardinal
lost to Delaware and NCAA
bound Westchester State before
shutting out St. Joseph's 1-0.
"We played reasonably well,"
Johnson said. "We just couldn't
get the ball to go in the goal."
Although the team was cer
tainly disappointed with the two
losses, in the long run they may
have helped the Cardinal more
than any other single factor this
season. Besides the fact that the
games were against some very
telling competition, the Cardi
nal's inability to score goals was
also exposed. I hat was a factor
that haunted the team for the rest
of the year.
"Our team has the capability
of scoring a lot of goals,"
Johnson said. "We had a lot of
chances throughout the year, but
some bad luck and the failure to
capitalize on some excellent
chances hurt us. But that's all be
hind us now."
Stanford certainly had no trou
ble scoring from Oct. 3-10. In
three straight conference vic
tories the team scored seven
goals. During that time the Cardi
nal rose to No. 9 in the national
rankings and seemingly had the
conference crown wrapped up
with a 5-0 league mark.
But then the bottom fell out.
Stanford went 2-2-1 over the last
five games and almost lost the
NorPac title. But a 3-0 thrashing
of Chico State in the last game of
the regular season put to rest
fears of a complete end-of-the
year collapse.

Although the squad did have
trouble scoring goals during the
year — Stanford was shut out six
times — other teams clearly
didn't have an easy time of it
against the Cardinal. The stingy
Cardinal defense, led by All-
America candidates Karen Jones
and Ami Chit wood, gave up a
mere 0.63 goals per game during
the season.
Jones, the junior goalie, shut
out eight opponents on her way
to a truly outstanding year. "She
was great," Johnson said. "Al
though many of the NCAA teams
have excellent goalies, I believe
Karen can compete with all of
them."
Chitwood, Stanford's only
senior, will be critical to the
team's postseason effort, as she
will have to bear the burden of
marking the opponent's center
forward. Hut she is confident. "I
believe we can do well," Chit
wood said. "After coming up
short the last two years I really
want to advance this time
around."
And the Cardinal has a good
shot at advancing "this time
around." The team seems to
have returned to its midseason
confidence level and is looking
forward to the relatively weak
Mid West regional, the one in
which Stanford has played the
last two years. "I guess we
lucked out in that sense."
Johnson said. "The regional isn't
that touch."
But the Cardinal will have to
be if it is to break its two-year
jinx.
