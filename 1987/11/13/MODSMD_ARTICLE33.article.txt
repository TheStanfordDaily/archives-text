# Volleyball travels to Arizona
## 
### Chris trader Editorial staff 
Here we go again.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team is on the road once
again for the latest in a long se
ries of 'key" Pacific 10 Confer
ence matchups. The team faces
Arizona tonight in Tucson, then
tomorrow travels to Tempe to
play Arizona State.
The Cardinal is currently 21-4,
13-1 in the Pac-10 and has been
leading the conference since Oct.
10. Stanford has been pressed
hard this month, however, as
UCLA, California and USC are
all within three-and-a-half games
of first place, making every
match the Cardinal plays a
struggle to stay ahead in the
league race.
Stanford will have its hands
full this weekend, as both the
Wildcats and the Sun Devils have
been playing very well at home
all year. Arizona is currently
seventh in the Pac-10 with a 6-8
mark, but the Wildcats have a 15-
10 overall record and have been
in and out of the national top 20
most of the year. The team also
has an 11-4 record on its home
court this season.
The Sun Devils are in a similar
spot. Their 7-7 league mark seats
them in sixth place. They have
spent the whole year among the
top 30 teams in the nation on
their way to a 13-10 mark. Like
their arch-rivals, they have also
been very tough at home, posting
an 8-2 record there. ASU is 6-1 in
home Pac-10 contests, including
a sweep of UCLA and USC there
two weeks ago.
Despite these formidable
records, however, the two

Arizona schools will not have an
easy time with the Cardinal.
Stanford comes in as the third
ranked team in the nation — be
hind Hawaii and Pacific. The
Cardinal had a Pac-10 and school
record 14-match winning streak
snapped by Pacific Nov. 3, but
the team rebounded with a pair of
convincing wins last weekend
against I7th-ranked Oregon and
Oregon State.
The two wins ran Stanford's
conference winning streak to 13.
Stanford is also 16-0 at home in
Pac-10 play since the women's
volleyball conference was
created two years ago.
The key to the Cardinal's suc
cess this season has been consis
tency. The Cardinal has never
dropped lower than fifth in the
national coaches' poll, and all
four of the team's losses have
come to teams ranked higher
than Stanford at the time.
The reason for that consis
tency has been the example put
forth by the team's trio of
seniors: Nancy Reno, Wendi
Rush and Teresa Smith.
Rush, the starting setter for
each of the past four seasons, has
run the offense at a consistently
high level. She sets (seventh in
the country in assists), she digs
(fourth in the league with over
three per game), she blocks (third
on the team, trailing only the two
starting middle blockers) and she
scores points (22 aces this year).
While setting. Rush has often
looked to Reno and Smith, the
two big guns on the squad.
The two have been atop the
team in kills all year, and both
are in the Pac-10's top five in kills
average. At this point, Reno

leads with 343 kills, while Smith
has 327 They excel on defense
as well, as they are among four
Cardinal players who have over
2(H) digs this season (Rush and
junior Amy Hayes are the
others.).
As if this weren't enough pro
duction, the two have 55 aces be
tween them, more than 40 per
cent of the Cardinal's total for
1987. Reno is also the team's
leading blocker, edging junior
Laura Olesen in that category.
The Wildcats, tonight's oppon
ent, are led by senior outside hit
ter Kiyomi Morino. In the two
teams' previous meeting Oct. 17,
Morino had a match-high 17 kills
to go with 15 digs. But her effort
wasn't enough as Stanford swept
Arizona in three games.
Arizona also has one of the
brightest up-and-coming setters
in the league in sophomore
Lindsey Hahn and two good
middle blockers in Stephanie
Murry and Kelly Waage. But
they will have problems provid
ing Morino with enough support
to defeat the high-flying Cardi
nal.
The Sun Devils have had a
season full of ups and downs, but
it has been more down than up
for the team the Pac-10 coaches
picked to finish fourth in their
preseason poll. The Devils have
one of the top setters in the
country in senior Regina Stahl,
an honorable mention All-
America choice last year.
They also have two good
outside hitters in Christy Nore
and Tracey Barberie and another
All-Pac-10 candidate in middle
blocker Sue Nord.
The Sun Devils also fell in
three straight games when they

came to visit the Cardinal last
month in a match made
memorable by Stanford's ability
to come back. Stanford rallied
from an 8-3 deficit in the second
game and came back after trailing
10-4 in the third game as Reno
served 11 consecutive points.
A pair of Stanford wins would
turn the Pac-10 into a two-team
race with a week to play. All four
California schools are still alive,
but the Cardinal needs only one
more win to eliminate third-place
California and clinch a tie with
fourth-place USC. A second
Stanford win would knock the
Trojans out of the running as well
and cut the magic number to one
against UCLA.
Stanford finishes the Pac-10
season by hosting UCLA and
USC next Thursday and Friday.
The Bruins have to face not only
the Cardinal, but also California
next weekend and USC the fol
lowing Wednesday, after hosting
Washington and Washington
State this weekend.
At stake are NCAA tourna
ment bids for teams like Arizona,
ASU and Washington. Stanford,
Cal, UCLA and USC have al
most assured themselves of bids,
but will look to finish strong to
gain a high seeding in the deadly
West Regional — four of the top
seven teams in the country are in
the West.
The Cardinal also hopes to
host the regional tournament, a
hope that will become more real
istic if the Cardinal can win all
four remaining league contests
and put up a strong fight in its
regular season-ending two-match
road trip to Hawaii to face the
top-ranked Rainbow Wahines
(27-1).

Morino had a match-high 17 kills
to go with 15 digs. But her effort

Arizona in three games.
Arizona also has one of the
brightest up-and-coming setters
in the league in sophomore
Lindsey Hahn and two good
middle blockers in Stephanie
Murry and Kelly Waage. But
they will have problems provid
ing Morino with enough support
to defeat the high-flying Cardi
nal.
The Sun Devils have had a
season full of ups and downs, but
it has been more down than up
for the team the Pac-10 coaches
picked to finish fourth in their
preseason poll. The Devils have
one of the top setters in the
country in senior Regina Stahl,
an honorable mention All-
America choice last year.
They also have two good
outside hitters in Christy Nore
and Tracey Barberie and another
All-Pac-10 candidate in middle
blocker Sue Nord.
The Sun Devils also fell in
three straight games when they

came to visit the Cardinal last
month in a match made
memorable by Stanford's ability
to come back. Stanford rallied
from an 8-3 deficit in the second
game and came back after trailing
10-4 in the third game as Reno
served 11 consecutive points.
A pair of Stanford wins would
turn the Pac-10 into a two-team
race with a week to play. All four
California schools are still alive,
but the Cardinal needs only one
more win to eliminate third-place
California and clinch a tie with
fourth-place USC. A second
Stanford win would knock the
Trojans out of the running as well
and cut the magic number to one
against UCLA.
Stanford finishes the Pac-10
season by hosting UCLA and
USC next Thursday and Friday.
The Bruins have to face not only
the Cardinal, but also California
next weekend and USC the fol
lowing Wednesday, after hosting
Washington and Washington
State this weekend.
At stake are NCAA tourna
ment bids for teams like Arizona,
ASU and Washington. Stanford,
Cal, UCLA and USC have al
most assured themselves of bids,
but will look to finish strong to
gain a high seeding in the deadly
West Regional — four of the top
seven teams in the country are in
the West.
The Cardinal also hopes to
host the regional tournament, a
hope that will become more real
istic if the Cardinal can win all
four remaining league contests
and put up a strong fight in its
regular season-ending two-match
road trip to Hawaii to face the
top-ranked Rainbow Wahines
(27-1).

Teresa Smith has made the jump serve her trademark Tor a Cardinal
volleyball team that leads the Pac-10 entering tonight's mateh at
Arizona and tomorrow night's at Arizona State.
Here we go again.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team is on the road once
again for the latest in a long se
ries of 'key" Pacific 10 Confer
ence matchups. The team faces
Arizona tonight in Tucson, then
tomorrow travels to Tempe to
play Arizona State.
The Cardinal is currently 21-4,
13-1 in the Pac-10 and has been
leading the conference since Oct.
10. Stanford has been pressed
hard this month, however, as
UCLA, California and USC are
all within three-and-a-half games
of first place, making every
match the Cardinal plays a
struggle to stay ahead in the
league race.
Stanford will have its hands
full this weekend, as both the
Wildcats and the Sun Devils have
been playing very well at home
all year. Arizona is currently
seventh in the Pac-10 with a 6-8
mark, but the Wildcats have a 15-
10 overall record and have been
in and out of the national top 20
most of the year. The team also
has an 11-4 record on its home
court this season.
The Sun Devils are in a similar
spot. Their 7-7 league mark seats
them in sixth place. They have
spent the whole year among the
top 30 teams in the nation on
their way to a 13-10 mark. Like
their arch-rivals, they have also
been very tough at home, posting
an 8-2 record there. ASU is 6-1 in
home Pac-10 contests, including
a sweep of UCLA and USC there
two weeks ago.
Despite these formidable
records, however, the two

Arizona schools will not have an
easy time with the Cardinal.
Stanford comes in as the third
ranked team in the nation — be
hind Hawaii and Pacific. The
Cardinal had a Pac-10 and school
record 14-match winning streak
snapped by Pacific Nov. 3, but
the team rebounded with a pair of
convincing wins last weekend
against I7th-ranked Oregon and
Oregon State.
The two wins ran Stanford's
conference winning streak to 13.
Stanford is also 16-0 at home in
Pac-10 play since the women's
volleyball conference was
created two years ago.
The key to the Cardinal's suc
cess this season has been consis
tency. The Cardinal has never
dropped lower than fifth in the
national coaches' poll, and all
four of the team's losses have
come to teams ranked higher
than Stanford at the time.
The reason for that consis
tency has been the example put
forth by the team's trio of
seniors: Nancy Reno, Wendi
Rush and Teresa Smith.
Rush, the starting setter for
each of the past four seasons, has
run the offense at a consistently
high level. She sets (seventh in
the country in assists), she digs
(fourth in the league with over
three per game), she blocks (third
on the team, trailing only the two
starting middle blockers) and she
scores points (22 aces this year).
While setting. Rush has often
looked to Reno and Smith, the
two big guns on the squad.
The two have been atop the
team in kills all year, and both
are in the Pac-10's top five in kills
average. At this point, Reno

leads with 343 kills, while Smith
has 327 They excel on defense
as well, as they are among four
Cardinal players who have over
2(H) digs this season (Rush and
junior Amy Hayes are the
others.).
As if this weren't enough pro
duction, the two have 55 aces be
tween them, more than 40 per
cent of the Cardinal's total for
1987. Reno is also the team's
leading blocker, edging junior
Laura Olesen in that category.
The Wildcats, tonight's oppon
ent, are led by senior outside hit
ter Kiyomi Morino. In the two
teams' previous meeting Oct. 17,
Morino had a match-high 17 kills
to go with 15 digs. But her effort
wasn't enough as Stanford swept
Arizona in three games.
Arizona also has one of the
brightest up-and-coming setters
in the league in sophomore
Lindsey Hahn and two good
middle blockers in Stephanie
Murry and Kelly Waage. But
