Call an exterminator, the Banana Slugs are
coming!
The Stanford fencing teams should be able to
contain the threat without pesticides, however.
Though UC-Santa Cruz is the Cardinal's
archrival in fencing, Stanford will wield the
home-floor advantage and the enthusiasm of its
revamped program when it officially opens its
season at 1 p.m. tomorrow in Roble Gym.
"It's going to be a very exciting meet, to say
the least," Stanford senior Tracy Schmidt said.
"The (Stanford) women beat Santa Cruz by one
touch at West Regionals last year. And with a
meet of 16 bouts with five touches each that's
pretty close. They'll be out for a fight.
"The big thing is that we've got a new coach
with a great attitude," Schmidt said of first-year
Coach Zoran Tulum. "We are good technically,
but the new coach has really sparked us.
"If 1 needed to use just one word to describe
Zoran, I'd say that he's a blast. Practice is fast
and funny. We work out much harder than we
did before, but there is no feeling of dread," she
added.
Tulum, originally from Yugoslavia, comes to
Stanford after serving several years as an assis
tant coach at Harvard. "He's really keyed up
about going to nationals just to smirk at Har
vard," Schmidt remarked.
His positive attitude has reinvigorated the
entire fencing program at Stanford. "More
people are coming out for the team, and people
who left the team because of problems with the
old coach (Buzz Hurst) are back," Schmidt said.
More people have come out for classes as well,
and for a team that finds most of its talent in fen
cing classes this is especially important.

Nowhere has this resurgence been more evi
dent than on the men's foil team. Of the four
members, two fencers — Duncan Bell and Chris
Gillen — have returned from an extended hiatus.
They join returnee Craig Ring and freshman Stan
Brobston, who has experience and will serve as
the squad's alternate.
"The team was good last year, but they're
going to stomp Santa Cruz this time,'' Schmidt
said.
The sabre squad features Doug Flinn, Jim Far
rell and men's team captain Dave Russ, who is
currently the sabre team's only returning player,
as senior Mike Cramer is overseas. Until
Cramer's return, sabre will suffice with three
competitors.
The epee team is much more flexible, as the
lineup has yet to be set. Steve Schmidt is the
sole returner, joined by Richard Reader, Joe
Elizondo, Pete Duimestra and Scott Ferguson.
"We're starting new people in sabre and
epee," Schmidt said. "They could do really
well, or they could get beaten badly — it's an un
known quantity."
In direct contrast, the women's foil team en
joys a plethora of returning fencers. Starting this
weekend will be captain Alexandra Rankin,
Elisabeth Spillman. Juliet Johnson and freshman
Olivia Judson. Schmidt, who is working to
return to top form after ankle surgery this sum
mer, will serve as the alternate.
"Alexandra has been working hard and will do
really well," Schmidt said. "She's going to
surprise some people this year."
The meet will be far from a Stanford rout. The
Banana Slugs may have a wimpy mascot, but the
fencers are consistently talented and aggressive
fighters. "It's a toss-up in this meet," Schmidt
said.
