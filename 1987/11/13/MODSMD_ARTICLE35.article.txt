# Water polo alums make splash
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Last year, the Stanford water
polo team was undefeated ... or
was it?
Tomorrow at noon the Cardi
nal of today takes on the Cardinal
of yesterday in the annual water
polo alumni match. Asked
whether or not last year's team
was able to defeat the alumni,
Cardinal senior Boh Abbott said
he could not quite remember.
As it turns out, Abbott was
simply employing normal
memory repression. After all, if
your team won all its regular
season games and then waltzed
through the NCAA champion
ships for the national title
wouldn't you have wiped the
team's only loss from your
memory?
The fact is, the alumni handed
the 1986 Cardinal its only loss of
the season, winning 13-11. It was
a fearsome group of graduates,
including three 1984 Olympians
and two 1986 U.S. national team
members. This year the competi
tion will be a little less impres
sive, thanks to some good timing.
The national team — which in
cludes four Stanford alums — is
playing in Southern California
this weekend. The alumni match,
though, should still be a close
one with an alumni team that will
include two All-Americans from
last year's squad, assistant
coaches Greg Gamble and Greg
Ocasek.

Junior wingman Andrew Lawsou is fifth in scoring on the Stanford
water polo team. The Cardinal is out for revenge this weekend after last
year's loss to the alumni team.
