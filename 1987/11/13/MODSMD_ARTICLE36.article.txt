# Card runs in District-8 meet
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Following a poor showing in
the Pacific 10 Conference cross
country championships, the
Stanford men sand women's
teams will need a superlative ef
fort tomorrow at the NCAA
District-8 championships in
Fresno if they are to qualify for
the nationals.
The Cardinal men finished
eighth and the women fifth at the
recent Pac-10 meet.
The top three men's teams and
the top women's team in tomor
row's meet are guaranteed a
place in the NCAA champion
ships in Virginia Nov. 23. In addi
tion, the three fastest individuals
in each race will qualify.
The Stanford men's team has
not raced up to its potential this
year and will have to pass several
tough competitors — including
Arizona, Oregon, Washington
State and UC-Irvine — to im
prove on its showing in the Pac
10s. James Alborough seems to
be a good bet to move on to the
NCAA championships as an indi
vidual, regardless of how the
team fares.
Eric Mastalir, Steve Schadler,
Mark Mastalir, Jason Martin and
Bill Crowley will all be racing to
break the 31:30 barrier that
Coach Brooks Johnson feels is all
that stands between his team and
victory. Fric Mastalir has shown
he is capable, but the rest have
yet to pass the 32-minute mark.
Unless they do so, Alborough
and Mastalir are the only Stan
ford runners with an opportunity
to advance.
The Cardinal women, led by
Carol Gray, have a more difficult
task ahead of them, yet are more
likely to achieve success. The
District-8 champion will go to
Virginia, and the rest of the teams
will have to battle for an at-large
spot depending on their perform
ance relative to other districts.

Gray was third at the District s
race last year and went on to earn
All-America honors by placing
25th at the NCAA champion
ships. She will be the closest
thing to a sure bet for the Cardi
nal this weekend.
Kim Stevens should bounce
back from the illness that plagued
her during the Pac-10 champion
ships and break the 17:30 barrier
that she and Melanie Bloch have
been chasing.
With Oregon being the domi
nant team having run away with
the Pac-10 race, the Cardinal will
be racing for a strong second to
morrow, targeting Pac-10 runner
up UCLA. Though hurt by the
loss of Cory Schubert, Stanford
can beat UCLA with five runners
under 17:30, according to
Johnson.
The key to success, he said, is
to "run up to our potential. This
is the best I've ever had a team
prepared."
The men's team now appears
to have a No. 4 and No. 5 runner.
Steve Schadler and freshman
Jason Martin have cut a minute
and a half from their previous 10-
kilometer times this season. To
Fight for the third spot at Fresno,
the Cardinal men will need to im
prove by an average of 40
seconds each.
The women's team will have a
better chance. Gray could finish
in or close to first if she can
match her 16:45.6 District-8
finish of a year ago, when the
team was second and went on to
take 15th in the national cham
pionships. Both Stevens and
Bloch could slip inside the top
15.
The women will be racing only
five runners instead of the tradi
tional seven because Johnson
feels that some runners have not
been giving "an honest effort."
The team cannot "race to the
rear" and try to move up while
holding off the pain and fatigue,
he said.

The Stanford men's team has
not raced up to its potential this
year and will have to pass several
tough competitors — including
Arizona, Oregon, Washington
State and UC-Irvine — to im
prove on its showing in the Pac
10s. James Alborough seems to
be a good bet to move on to the
NCAA championships as an indi
vidual, regardless of how the
team fares.
Eric Mastalir, Steve Schadler,
Mark Mastalir, Jason Martin and
Bill Crowley will all be racing to
break the 31:30 barrier that
Coach Brooks Johnson feels is all
that stands between his team and
victory. Fric Mastalir has shown
he is capable, but the rest have
yet to pass the 32-minute mark.
Unless they do so, Alborough
and Mastalir are the only Stan
ford runners with an opportunity
to advance.
The Cardinal women, led by
Carol Gray, have a more difficult
task ahead of them, yet are more
likely to achieve success. The
District-8 champion will go to
Virginia, and the rest of the teams
will have to battle for an at-large
spot depending on their perform
ance relative to other districts.

Gray was third at the District s
race last year and went on to earn
All-America honors by placing
25th at the NCAA champion
ships. She will be the closest
thing to a sure bet for the Cardi
nal this weekend.
Kim Stevens should bounce
back from the illness that plagued
her during the Pac-10 champion
ships and break the 17:30 barrier
that she and Melanie Bloch have
been chasing.
With Oregon being the domi
nant team having run away with
the Pac-10 race, the Cardinal will
be racing for a strong second to
morrow, targeting Pac-10 runner
up UCLA. Though hurt by the
loss of Cory Schubert, Stanford
can beat UCLA with five runners
under 17:30, according to
Johnson.
The key to success, he said, is
to "run up to our potential. This
is the best I've ever had a team
prepared."
The men's team now appears
to have a No. 4 and No. 5 runner.
Steve Schadler and freshman
Jason Martin have cut a minute
and a half from their previous 10-
kilometer times this season. To
Fight for the third spot at Fresno,
the Cardinal men will need to im
prove by an average of 40
seconds each.
The women's team will have a
better chance. Gray could finish
in or close to first if she can
match her 16:45.6 District-8
finish of a year ago, when the
team was second and went on to
take 15th in the national cham
pionships. Both Stevens and
Bloch could slip inside the top
15.
The women will be racing only
five runners instead of the tradi
tional seven because Johnson
feels that some runners have not
been giving "an honest effort."
The team cannot "race to the
rear" and try to move up while
holding off the pain and fatigue,
he said.
