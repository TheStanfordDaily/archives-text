# Dean Fred returns for Greek's anniversary
## 
### 
It's the 10th anniversary of the
Stanford Daily Guest Greek
feature, and to commemorate
this stupendous event we bring
you the very first Guest Greek
himself — former Dean of Ad
missions Fred Hargadon.
Back on Oct. 7, 1977, Daily
"soothsayers" decided to get
"the University's No. 1 pick
man" to help with their weekly
pigskin prognostication. Dean
Fred didn't do so great, correctly
picking only two of the five Pac-8
games that week, but the Guest
Greek became a regular item.
Now, given another chance —
and five additional games to pick
— Hargadon took a conservative
approach, although he did go out
on a limb and predict a tie be
tween Georgia and Auburn.
"With Auburn you never
know who's going to be academi
cally eligible," Hargadon said.
"They have to go up to the last

minute wondering if some guy's
been arrested or flunked out.
That's got to make a coach ner
vous."
In his "heart of hearts," Har
gadon said he'd like to see Goer
gia win, and he'd also like In
diana to beat Michigan State.
Texas A&M will win, accord
ing to Hargadon. "partly because
their head coach (Jackie Sherrill)
needs to justify his salary, and
justify being paid more than col
lege presidents."
Hargadon, who now works for
the College Board in Princeton,
N.J., doing "a little bit of every
thing," said his picks "represent
what true justice would be," and
added, "112 really do hope USC
gets upset."
Dean Fred didn't hestitate in
giving an early Big Game predic
tion. "Stanford is clearly a better
team than Cal," he said de
cisively.
