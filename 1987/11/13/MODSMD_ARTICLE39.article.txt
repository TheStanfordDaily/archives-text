## Fraternity to hold dry Rush in spring 
### Sean kinch Staff writer 
I he Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity
will hold a dry Rush this spring,
according to SAM President
Rene Lacerte.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said he was encouraged
by the voluntary decision but
was uncertain whether other fra
ternities will make the same
choice.
Pisano said the "ideal situation
is that the Interfraternity Council
make the decision on their own"
to sponsor a dry Rush.
Lacerte said the decision,
which was made at a SAM
meeting Monday night, was
based on practical considerations
and was not due to any pressure
from their national office or the
University. SAM is an unhoused
fraternity.
"We think that our Rush will
be much more fun and will pro
vide a much better atmosphere
for people to get to know each
other if we direct our energy and
our money to host creative
events that do not center around
alcohol," Lacerte said.
The presidents of Kappa Alpha
and Phi Delta Theta fraternities
said they are waiting to address
the issue of having a dry Rush

until after it has been discussed
by the Interfraternity Council.
Both noted, however, that many
members of their fraternities
would be opposed to a dry Rush.
KA President Charles Moody
said he thinks the sentiment
among the members is against
having a dry Rush. "We have al
ways had |Rush| wet, and it has
been good in the past," Moody
said.
Phi Delt President John Payne
said his fraternity also wants to
maintain its current Rush policy
but personally feels the house's
Rush would be just as successful
without serving alcohol.
Pisano said the decision by
SAM shows that the SAM mem
bers are "comfortable with who
they are" and are primarily inter
ested in getting rushees to learn
about the fraternity.
Lacerte said SAM members
"felt that alcohol should not fig
ure in the process of getting to
know people during Rush."
He added they will use the
money they would have spent on
alcohol to sponsor "creative al
ternatives" for Rush, such as a
canoe trip.
IFC president Vinny Frost was
unavailable for comment last
night.
