# Sand Hill Road to be extended
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Sand Hill Road, which con
nects Stanford to Interstate 280,
will be extended to connect with
El Camino Real, a committee of
Stanford, Menlo Park and Palo
Alto officials announced yester
day.
The decision by the Sand Hill
Road Corridor Joint Policy Com
mittee ends a 50-year-old politi
cal deadlock over proposals to
extend Sand Hill and re-route
traffic around the Stanford Shop
ping Center. Currently, cars
must drive through the center's
parking lot to reach El Camino
Real.
Before construction begins the
committee will spend about
$20,000 and three to four months
to study the expected impact of
the proposed extension on the
surrounding communities. The
six committee members — two
from each of the three communi
ties — will then negotiate solu
tions to expected environmental
and traffic pattern concerns.
Stanford has committed to spend
$15,000 for an environmental im
pact report to follow the commit
tee's studies.

William Zaner said the next step
will be "the six of you
(committee members) arm
wrestling it about," referring to
the negotiations scheduled to fol
low environmental and traffic
studies.
Committee members said they
are determined to resolve several
remaining issues, including a pro
posal to extend the road further
to Alma Street in Palo Alto.
"The project has been going
on for years and years, and now
we're working from a clean
slate," said Andrew Doty, Stan
ford's director of Community Re
lations. The University has taken
no position on the Alma Street
extension, but according to
Doty, Stanford "is not opposed
to the proposal" and "will
cooperate" as much as possible
to insure that Sand Hill be linked
to El Camino.
Menlo Park city council mem
ber Jan La Fetra said the com
mittee needed to focus on a
larger perspective instead of
sticking on details. "1 want to
look at the big picture," she said.
One important study that
needs to be done is an analysis of
