## Columnist describes technical aspects of X-rated films 
### Leslie Hatamiya Staff writer 
Pornography can have a big
impact on a person's sex life,
an X-rated video columnist told
a packed crowd in Burbank
lounge last night.
Susie Bright, reviewer of
pornographic films for the
Penthouse Forum column
"The Erotic Screen," spoke on
the history of the pornographic
film industry and showed
graphic clips of various adult
films to over 80 students as a
part of a Burbank House Sex
Week program.
"Pornography is such a
private thing (that) most people
aren't comfortable talking
about it, even with friends,"
Bright said.
"But when you're watching
a sex film, it's easy to get
aroused," she said. "When
you watch it, you say, 'That
didn't turn me on,' and then
eight hours later you're in bed
with someone."
Bright called pornograpy "a
new type of film." because it
has been kept underground and
criminalized until the video
revolution. "People who never
dreamed about going into the
Pussycat Theater can now see

(pornographic films] at home
on video," she said.
According to Bright, porno
graphic films are generally con
sidered to he amateur in quality
because the pornography in
dustry has not spent much time
or money dn the cinematograp
hic aspects that make Holly
wood films successful, such as
meaningful scripts, extensive
editing and high-quality cin
ematography.
Although pornography has
only recently gained wide
spread accessibility, Bright
said the very first movie ever
made in the 19205, called "The
Kiss," was about a sexual act.
Bright compared the porno
graphic film to its Hollywood
counterpart by showing a scene
from the hit film ' Body Heat."
According to a survey she
ran in her column,"Body
Heat" was the top non-X-rated
movie that "turned people
on."
This movie is "a great exam
ple of being sexy and witty. It
has the fantastic ability to
create a lot of sexual tension."
she said. "You want to see |the
leads) making love."
Bright emphasized the aspect
of time passage in adult
movies. Compared to having

sexual intercourse in real life,
each erotic scene lasts only five
to 10 minutes on screen, she
said.
"But when you re watching
pornography it seems longer,"
she said, adding that "if you're
watching porn to get aroused,
you need to see those images."
According to Bright, the typ
ical X-rated film shows only the
man's orgasm, but women's
erotica is a new type of pornog
raphy that emphasizes the
female climax, where "you can
vicariously feel what she
feels."
Burbank Resident Assistant
Kelly Wahl invited Bright to
speak as part of the dorm's
week-long series of films and
programs that is loosely titled
"Sex Week." According to
senior John Arino, a Burbank
resident, the purpose of the
program was to educate stu
dents about the industry and to
give them a topic for discus
sion.
Besides writing the monthly
Penthouse Forum column.
Bright edits the lesbian sex
magazine On Our Backs and
previously worked for five
years at Good Vibrations, a
feminist vibrator-sex toy store
in San Francisco.
