# Zschau calls for innovative ideas

A lack of innovative proposals
and programs has led to the
downfall of the Republican
Party, according to ex-cong
ressman and former Stanford
Business Prof. Ed Zschau.
Zschau, who lost to Democrat
Alan Cranston in last fall's U.S.
Senate race in California and is
planning to run again in 1992,
said the Repubicans lost the Sen
ate majority to Democrats in
1986 because they failed to pres
ent specific answers to such
problems as poverty, housing,
education and the economy.
"You can't win elections by
running on past achievements,"
Zschau said to to an audience of
approximately 50 Stanford Col
lege Republicans last night at the
Law School.
"Voters are interested in their
future, so we have to refer to
(that future] in a very specific
way. The reason we have low
voter turnouts is that people
aren't inspired," he said.
Zschau emphasized that the
Republican Party must promote

"positive ideas" in order to be a
strong party.
"The party has developed a
tradition of being against rather
than for things, such as simply
against the Democrats," he said.
"The road to victory in the up
coming presidential election

would be for a candidate to run
on a platform of real problems,
accept some of the blame, and in
dicate a way to deal with them.
It's a high-risk approach, but that
person could attract an enormous
amount of support."
Zschau said that selectivity
within the party is another cause
of its recent election defeats.
"We've had a litmus test as to
who is a good Republican, so it's
not been a party that people felt
they'd be welcome in if their
ideas differed from what a few
important people thought."
To combat this problem
Republicans must learn to accept
diverse ideas. "Everybody's got
a bit of the truth. If you're so
narrow-minded as to listen only
to those who agreed with you,
you put up blinders to what can
strengthen your proposal. We
have to become a party of inclu
sion rather than exclusion," he
said.
Zschau attributed his own loss
to Cranston partly to this factor
of exclusion. "In the primary I
ran as me, because I think you
just have to be yourself and let
the chips fall where they may."
As a result, Zschau said he

worked to persuade Republicans
of the merit of his platform "until
the last weekend of the elec
tion."
"My vision for the Republican
Party is to get back to the roots of
the people," Zschau said. "We
need not just rhetoric, but ac
tion."
He also said the common belief
that Republicans lack compas
sion is a "bum rap."
"The Republican message that
government should be built to
serve the individual, and to be re
sponsible rather than get a free
ride is a complimentary one," he
said. "It says, '1 believe in
you.' "
Zschau said he supports Law
Prof. Tom Campbell in his quest
for the 12th Congressional Dis
trict seat, which Zschau held for
two terms.
In the general election, Zschau
lost to Cranston by less than one
percentage point. Cranston beat
Zschau in Sant Clara County —
home to both candidates — and
in Los Angeles County, where
one third of California's voters
live.
Cranston, a Stanford graduate,
also won in Sacramento, Fresno
and San Francisco counties, but
lost decisively in the more con
servative Orange and Riverside
counties.
