A lack of innovative proposals
and programs has led to the
downfall of the Republican
Party, according to ex-cong
ressman and former Stanford
Business Prof. Ed Zschau.
Zschau, who lost to Democrat
Alan Cranston in last fall's U.S.
Senate race in California and is
planning to run again in 1992,
said the Repubicans lost the Sen
ate majority to Democrats in
1986 because they failed to pres
ent specific answers to such
problems as poverty, housing,
education and the economy.
"You can't win elections by
running on past achievements,"
Zschau said to to an audience of
approximately 50 Stanford Col
lege Republicans last night at the
Law School.
"Voters are interested in their
future, so we have to refer to
(that future] in a very specific
way. The reason we have low
voter turnouts is that people
aren't inspired," he said.
Zschau emphasized that the
Republican Party must promote

"positive ideas" in order to be a
strong party.
"The party has developed a
tradition of being against rather
than for things, such as simply
against the Democrats," he said.

coming presidential election
