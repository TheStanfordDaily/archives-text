Carlucci: Arms budget may he cut
WASHINGTON — The federal budget crunch may force the
United States to face the future with slimmed-down armed
forces, White House national security adviser Frank Carlucci
told senators yesterday, tacitly acknowledging that Pentagon
spending may take cuts in an attack on the deficit.
Nominated by President Reagan to replace Caspar
Weinberger as defense secretary, the 57-year-old Carlucci was
asked w here he expects to turn if the Department of Defense is
forced to accept an outright decline in its budget in the next two
years.
"I think we have to look at everything," he replied at his con
firmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee. "I don't think anything can be sacrosanct. 1 think we might
well be talking about a smaller force."
Carlucci made no promises to the senators about any possible
concessions involving defense cuts. "1 bring no agenda other
than the president's, he said, "to provide efficiently and ef
ffectively for today's defense needs, and to build the bipartisan
consensus necessary to provide for our nation's future secu
rity."
Nevertheless, it was Carlucci's tone, perhaps more than his
words, that differed markedly from that of his dogged predeces
sor, who fought all attempts to pare back his budget while engi
neering an unprecedented buildup of the nation's defenses.
AMA says doctors must treat AIDS
The American Medical Association (AMA), taking note of
public statements by some doctors refusing to treat patients in
fected with the AIDS virus, advised physicians yesterday that it
is unethical to deny care in such situations if the care required is
within the doctor's normal range of practice.
And in a new statement on doctors' obligations in AIDS
cases, the AMA ethics council also told physicians that if a pa
tient carrying the AIDS virus refuses to discontinue dangerous
sexual practices, a doctor should notify public health authorities
and even take it upon himself to directly inform individuals who
may be in danger of infection.
The requirement for informing authorities and endangered
persons, said Dr. Nancy Dickey, a spokeswoman for the
AMA's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, could con
ceivably justify a doctor breaching local and state confiden
tiality laws to warn people who might be at risk of contracting
AIDS from a patient who refuses to modify his or her behavior.
In a telephone interview. Dickey said the notification provi
sions were drafted at least in part with restrictive California
AIDS notification laws in mind. The new AMA strictures con
flict with existing California law, under which it is illegal for a
doctor, without the patient's consent, to tell anyone a person
has tested positive for the AIDS virus or has AIDS.
"If you (a doctor) feel that there is someone in danger and you
have counseled change in behavior and the [patient] still
blatantly refuses," said Dickey, "then there may be times when
you will be put in conflict with the law."
Wright meets with Ortega, contras
WASHINGTON — Amid signs of new progress toward a
Central American peace. House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas)
met separately yesterday with Nicaraguan President Daniel Or
tega and contra political leaders, apparently to discuss cease
fire talks tentatively set to begin between the two sides next
week.
Wright and Ortega were to meet early today with the likely
go-between in those talks, Nicaraguan Roman Catholic Cardinal
Miguel Obando y Bravo, in the Vatican Embassy in Washington.
Wright's office scheduled an announcement to be made after
that session.
Two U.S. officials said yesterday that Ortega appears likely
to present at that time, perhaps with Wright's personal support,
a 15-point outline for a truce in the seven-year war between the
Sandinistas and the contras.
A Wright spokesman said only that the Speaker "has been lis
tening to both sides" and is not an intermediary between Ortega
and his rebel opponents.
"1 would not describe it as mediating. We're trying to get the
talks off and rolling," the spokesman said.
In an unusual development in a hectic day of closed-door
meetings, Secretary of State George Shultz also briefly visited
Wright and the contra leaders at Wright's Capitol office. A
Wright spokesman said "multple items" were discussed, in
cluding Central America and the December summit between
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
One Reagan administration official said Shultz planned to
voice concern over the House Speaker's growing role in what
the State Department views as a foreign-affairs issue.
Companies lure smokers in Asia
TOKYO — U.S. tobacco companies, dismayed by a shrink
ing market at home, are rapidly recruiting new smokers in Asia
and the developing world, often with the aid of the U.S. govern
ment, delegates to an anti-smoking conference here said yester
day.
The percentage of people who smoke in the industrialized
world has decreased steadily in recent years, health experts
here said, but the proportion of smokers in developing countries
is rising. Tobacco companies have particularly targeted young
people and women, who traditionally have not smoked in many
Asian countries, they said.
"The industry plan is to create demand among Oriental
females," said Gregory Connolly, an adviser to the World
Health Organization. "If you have one billion Oriental females
who don't smoke as a market, that would more than replace the
quitters in western Europe and North America. . . . And death
and disease will follow."
Astronomers view eccentric planet
PASADENA, Calif. — The most distant planet in the solar
system, so far away and so tiny it is 16(H) times too faint to be
seen with the unaided eye, is putting on a show for astronomers
that comes only once in a lifetime.
Pluto, the oddest ball in the solar system, lies on its side as it
orbits the sun, and it is so aligned with the earth right now that
its moon passes in front of and directly behind Pluto as it spins
around the planet every 6.4 days.
By measuring such things as reductions in luminosity as part
of the planet or its moon is obscured by the other, astronomers
are able to learn much about the size, density and composition
of both bodies. And they won't have a chance like this again for
124 years. ' •
Not until Pluto travels half through its bizarre orbit
around the sun will it once again position itself so that similar
measurements can be made. And the next time it happens, it will
be much farther from the sun than it is now, so it will be about 10
times fainter, according to David Tholen of the University of
Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy.
