# Trade deficit slims in September
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The nation's mer
chandise trade deficit, in its best showing
since May, narrowed by $1.6 billion in Sep
tember to $14.1 billion, the Department of
Commerce reported yesterday.
The report helped send the stock market
soaring, with the Dow Jones industrial
average up 61 points for its seventh-largest
point gain on record.
A month ago, by contrast, when the de
partment reported a $15.7 billion trade gap
for August, down only slightly from July's
record deficit, the market responded with a
four-day, 750-point crash.
"This is one report with no holes in it,"
said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Shear
son Lehman Bros, in New York.
A leading cause of the narrowing trade gap
was an increase in U.S. manufacturing ex
ports to all major trading partners except
Canada.
Likewise, imports fell across a wide front.
Americans bought fewer Japanese cars,
whose prices have risen as the international
value of the dollar has slid. And they bought
less oil from the Middle Fast after a summer
of inventory stockpiling that had helped
propel the overall trade deficit to record
monthly levels.
David Wyss of Data Resources Inc., a Lex
ington, Mass., forecasting organization,
focused on the $800 million reduction in oil
imports.
"The summer widening in the trade deficit
was entirely accounted for by the oil imports,
and this confirms my feeling that the summer
widening was a fluke," Wyss said. "That
means the improvement in trade is real."
Jay Goldinger, an investment counselor
with the Los Angeles brokerage house of

Cantor, Fitzgerald, also found the decline in
imports significant. "This shows that con
sumption of imports began declining even
before the (stock market) crash," he said.
"That means we can expect a sharply
reduced trade deficit in the next few months,
and we'll probably see imports decrease
faster than we see exports grow."
Goldinger warned, however, that this
probable slowdown in consumption could
also bring a recession next year unless the
Japanese and Europeans expand their own
economies enough to consume more U.S.
products.
"We ll get what we want — a lower trade
deficit," Goldinger said. "But what we get
with it isn't necessarily what we want."
Just as the summer's monthly trade deficit
reports exaggerated the size of the gap, Wyss
said this one overstated the apparent im
provements. The increase in manufacturing
exports, he said, merely reflected a trend that
occurs every September.
And Michael Penzer, an economist with
the Bank of America in San Francisco, noted
that the price of oil fell in September from
$19.31 to $18.53 a barrel, exaggerating the ap
parent fall-off.
Muting the trade report's impact on the fi
nancial markets is the Federal Reserve
Board's continuing effort to Hood the banking
system with cash after the October stock
crash.
An improvement in the trade balance
would ordinarily boost the dollar's value in
international currency markets, taking pres
sure off the Fed to use high U.S. interest
rates to prop up the dollar.
But in current circumstances, the Fed has
already abandoned a policy of tight money

and high interest rates in order to stave off a
market-induced recession. Now the markets
seem more concerned with the value of the
dollar and with the negotiations between
Congress and the administration, which hit a
snag yesterday, to reduce the federal budget
deficit.
"This is not as big a deal as it would have
been a month ago," Wyss said. "Up until
Oct. everyone assumed the Fed would
have to tighten to defend the dollar if there
was a bad trade number. Now everyone
knows the Fed is more worried about reces
sion. So with this good report, there is no rea
son to believe this automatically means lower
interest rates. They already are lower."
Members of Congress who have pressed
for legislation to defend U.S. industries from
what they consider unfair foreign competition
declared themselves to be unimpressed by
September's figures.
"The trade numbers . . . came in lower
than some of our gurus had predicted, and
we're all grateful for that," said Senate
Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen
(D-Texas). But he warned that the decline in
oil imports was unlikely to be repeated in fu
ture months.
The Department of Commerce report
showed that exports rose from $20.2 billion in
August to $21 billion in September. T he $K(M)
million gain was slightly smaller than the $1.1
billion gain in manufacturing exports because
all other exports declined slightly.
At the same time, total imports declined
from $35.9 billion to $35.1 billion. Petroleum
imports, accounting for the entire decline, fell
from $4.7 billion to $3.9 billion.

But in current circumstances, the Fed has
already abandoned a policy of tight money

and high interest rates in order to stave off a
market-induced recession. Now the markets
seem more concerned with the value of the
dollar and with the negotiations between
Congress and the administration, which hit a
snag yesterday, to reduce the federal budget
deficit.
"This is not as big a deal as it would have
been a month ago," Wyss said. "Up until
Oct. everyone assumed the Fed would
have to tighten to defend the dollar if there
was a bad trade number. Now everyone
knows the Fed is more worried about reces
sion. So with this good report, there is no rea
son to believe this automatically means lower
interest rates. They already are lower."
Members of Congress who have pressed
for legislation to defend U.S. industries from
what they consider unfair foreign competition
declared themselves to be unimpressed by
September's figures.
"The trade numbers . . . came in lower
than some of our gurus had predicted, and
we're all grateful for that," said Senate
Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen
(D-Texas). But he warned that the decline in
oil imports was unlikely to be repeated in fu
ture months.
The Department of Commerce report
showed that exports rose from $20.2 billion in
August to $21 billion in September. T he $K(M)
million gain was slightly smaller than the $1.1
billion gain in manufacturing exports because
all other exports declined slightly.
At the same time, total imports declined
from $35.9 billion to $35.1 billion. Petroleum
imports, accounting for the entire decline, fell
from $4.7 billion to $3.9 billion.

WASHINGTON — The nation's mer
chandise trade deficit, in its best showing
since May, narrowed by $1.6 billion in Sep
tember to $14.1 billion, the Department of
Commerce reported yesterday.
The report helped send the stock market
soaring, with the Dow Jones industrial
average up 61 points for its seventh-largest
point gain on record.
A month ago, by contrast, when the de
partment reported a $15.7 billion trade gap
for August, down only slightly from July's
record deficit, the market responded with a
four-day, 750-point crash.
"This is one report with no holes in it,"
said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Shear
son Lehman Bros, in New York.
A leading cause of the narrowing trade gap
was an increase in U.S. manufacturing ex
ports to all major trading partners except
Canada.
Likewise, imports fell across a wide front.
Americans bought fewer Japanese cars,
whose prices have risen as the international
value of the dollar has slid. And they bought
less oil from the Middle Fast after a summer
of inventory stockpiling that had helped
propel the overall trade deficit to record
monthly levels.
David Wyss of Data Resources Inc., a Lex
ington, Mass., forecasting organization,
focused on the $800 million reduction in oil
imports.
"The summer widening in the trade deficit
was entirely accounted for by the oil imports,
and this confirms my feeling that the summer
widening was a fluke," Wyss said. "That
means the improvement in trade is real."
Jay Goldinger, an investment counselor
with the Los Angeles brokerage house of

Cantor, Fitzgerald, also found the decline in
imports significant. "This shows that con
sumption of imports began declining even
before the (stock market) crash," he said.
"That means we can expect a sharply
reduced trade deficit in the next few months,
and we'll probably see imports decrease
faster than we see exports grow."
Goldinger warned, however, that this
probable slowdown in consumption could
also bring a recession next year unless the
Japanese and Europeans expand their own
economies enough to consume more U.S.
products.
"We ll get what we want — a lower trade
deficit," Goldinger said. "But what we get
with it isn't necessarily what we want."
Just as the summer's monthly trade deficit
reports exaggerated the size of the gap, Wyss
said this one overstated the apparent im
provements. The increase in manufacturing
exports, he said, merely reflected a trend that
occurs every September.
And Michael Penzer, an economist with
the Bank of America in San Francisco, noted
that the price of oil fell in September from
$19.31 to $18.53 a barrel, exaggerating the ap
parent fall-off.
Muting the trade report's impact on the fi
nancial markets is the Federal Reserve
Board's continuing effort to Hood the banking
system with cash after the October stock
crash.
An improvement in the trade balance
would ordinarily boost the dollar's value in
international currency markets, taking pres
sure off the Fed to use high U.S. interest
rates to prop up the dollar.
