# Stanford faces major cuts in research funds
## 
### Mary Elizabeth McNitt Staff writer 
Three m«yor scientific research projects at Stan
ford stand to lose as much as one third of their
federal funding — nearly $2 million — if a proposal
to cut the Pentagon's University Research Initia
tive program (URI) is approved by Congress.
The URI program, initiated last year, provides
funding for defense-related projects at 70 univer
sities throughout the United States. The three
Stanford-affiliated projects were to receive $5.7
million over the next two years.
A study of supersonic combustion by mechanical
engineering and aeronautics professors and stu
dents here and at California Institute of Technology
received about $1 million in URI funds this year. A
Stanford project on air movement through jet
engines and around airplanes also received $1 mil
lion. The rest of Stanford's URI funding this year,
$3.7 million, went to a third project in electrical en
gineering.
Larry Horton, associate vice president for Public
Affairs, said that the proposed cuts "would have a
significant impact on California universities and at
Stanford."
Stanford has joined with the University of Cali
fornia system, USC and California Institute of
Technology in an effort to defeat the the proposed
cuts. Last week University President Donald Ken
nedy sent a letter to the U.S. Senate addressing the
proposal.
Horton said the California universities are ban
ding together because implicit in proposed cuts is
the assumption that California currently receives
more than its share of URI funds.
The legislation, which has passed the House Ap
propriations Committee and is awaitng considera
tion by the full House, would reduce the
percentage of funding received by California uni
versities from 22 percent of the URl's total budget
to 14 percent and would reducte the URI budget
from $106 million to $80 million.
Horton, however, said that California univer
sities are not overfunded. "It's not surprising,
given the extraordinary wealth of talent we have,
that quite a few awards would come to California,"
he said.
"Putting a limit on excellence is just prepos
terous," he said. "The proposal is really saying
that excellence is not the criteria. We ll take
second best.
"It's a young program that's just gearing up, and
now it's being cut," said Albert Barber, vice chan
cellor for Research at UCLA. UCLA has one URl
funded program in its math department.
Engineering Prof. William Reynolds, who is in
volved in two of the three URI projects at Stanford
said he is hopeful that the measure won't get past
the Senate. "I think sense will prevail," he said.
"Congress is crazy not to let the best work be
done."
