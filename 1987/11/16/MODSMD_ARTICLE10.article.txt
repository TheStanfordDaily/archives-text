# Jet flips in Denver, killing 19
## 
### 
DENVER â€” A Continental
Airlines DC-9 with 81 people on
board skidded off a runway,
Hipped over and split into pieces
yesterday while taking off during
the season's first major
snowstorm, killing at least 19
people.
A few victims remained
trapped in the wreckage more
than four hours after the crash as
rescue workers using power saws
cut through a mangled piece of
fuselage in an attempt to reach
them.
Others had long since been
taken from Stapleton Interna
tional Airport to area hospitals,
some badly injured but others
able to climb aboard buses that
were rushed to the scene.
Fire Capt. Charles McMillan
said 21 people walked away from
the crash and some were taken to

a fire station 500 yards from the
crash site for first aid.
Driving snow and a 12-degree
wind-chill factor hampered res
cuers as they worked to free sur
vivors from the wreckage of the
Boise, Idaho-bound flight. Emer
gency lights were set up to aid
the rescue operation as night fell
and heat was pumped into the
fuselage to keep trapped sur
vivors from freezing.
The plane, Flight 1713, was
carrying 76 passengers and a
crew of five, a Continental
spokesman said.
"We counted 18 dead outside
the plane, and there are several
dead in the fuselage," airport
spokesman Richard Boulware
said.
There were conflicting reports
on whether the twin-engine jet
liner caught fire. There was no

obvious evidence of fire at the
wreck scene, but some survivors
reportedly were suffering from
smoke inhalation and control
tower personnel reportedly saw a
fireball when the plane crashed.
The wreckage at the end of
Runway 35 was not visible from
the terminal. The view from the
windows of the airport terminal
was little more than a white
mixture of snow and fog and
visibility was reportedly as low
as one-eighth of a mile.
A Fire Department official said
that the plane flipped upside
down on the north-south runway
and skidded for over a quarter of
a mile before coming to a halt.
The fuselage lay on its back with
its wheels pointed .upward. An
airline spokesman said the tail,
and wings had all broken
away.

The crash occurred at 4:16
n.m. EST, according to the
Federal Aviation Administration
in Washington.
Grim-faced Continental em
ployees declined to release infor
mation for several hours after the
accident. Relatives and friends
and passengers on the wrecked
plane were shuttled into a private
terminal club.
A temporary morgue was set
up at the airport fire station.
In the terminal, thousands of
passengers stranded by the
weather lined up at pay phones,
many of them to reassure
relatives that they were all right
as word of the crash circulated.
First reports of the tragedy did
not identify which flight was in
volved.
