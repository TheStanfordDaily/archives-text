# Cardinal to mediate in Nicaragua

### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — The senior
Roman Catholic prelate of Nicaragua said
yesterday that leaders of both the govern
ment and the guerrilla insurgency appear will
ing to give him authority as a mediator to
make proposals for ending the Nicaraguan
war.
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo told
reporters after a Mass that he had "sourlded
out" President Daniel Ortega and leaders of
the guerrillas, known as contras, on the ques
tion of his powers during a visit to the United
States last week.
"1 would not agree (to mediate) if 1 were a
simple messenger," the cardinal said. "We
talked about the formation of a mediation
commission. In that case, I would not be just
a messenger, but an intermediary who could

make suggestions to the government as well
as to the Nicaraguan resistance."
The Roman Catholic leader said he must
receive the rebels' cease-fire proposal and
written confirmation of his authority from
both sides before he can formally accept the
peace mission.
Before indirect cease-fire negotiations can
start, Obando must also resolve disputes over
the site of the talks and the role of four
Americans proposed by House Speaker Jim
Wright (D-Texas) to help the mediation ef
fort, church officials said.
Complying with a Central American peace
accord signed by Ortega, Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government on Nov. 5 reversed its
longstanding refusal of any contact with the
U.S.-backed rebel leadership.

Ortega asked the 61-year-old cardinal to
serve as a go-between in talks to achieve a
cease-fire called for by the accord, then
invited him to receive the government's truce
proposal in Washington last Friday.
The cardinal returned to Managua late Sat
urday after meeting in Miami that day with
Aristides Sanchez, Azucena Ferrey and
Adolfo Calero of the six-member Nicaraguan
Resistance directorate.
The Sandinista government's one-month
truce offer would require rebel troops inside
Nicaragua to move into one of three cease
fire zones by Dec. 5 and surrender their
weapons to a team of international observers
by Jan. 5 in order to be eligible for amnesty.
