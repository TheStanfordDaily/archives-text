# Gore will visit Stanford next week
## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Presidential candidate Sen. Al
bert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) will visit
campus Nov. 24, a newly formed
coalition of student political
groups announced this weekend.
The visit will be the first to be
sponsored by the week-old Stan
ford Coalition for the Candi
dates, formed after a month of
discussion by groups interested
in bringing presidential candi
dates to Stanford. Coalition
members include the Speakers
Bureau, the Stanford Democrats,
the Stanford College Republicans
and Stanford in Government
(SIG).
Organizers said the coalition
was formed as a way to ease ten
sions between various political
groups on campus over the
booking of guest speakers.
Friction between the Speakers
Bureau and SIG developed last
May when both groups competed

to sponsor receptions for visiting
Democratic presidential candi
date Bruce Babbitt. Babbitt s ap
pearance on campus had been ar
ranged by a student with ties to
the Babbitt campaign.
"There was a real spirit of
competition last year," said SIG
Chair Gary Rosen. According to
David Cline, president of Stan
ford Democrats, that competition
detracted from the unity of Dem
ocrats here.
According to Rosen, Hoover
fellow Rodney Kennedy-Minot
put the coalition in contact with
the Gore campaign.
Greg Zipes, co-chair of Stan
ford Students for Gore, said the
details of Gore's visit will be
finalized tomorrow. A tentative
schedule includes a reception
with Gore between 11:30 a.m.
and noon for students and local
businessmen. Plans then call for
Gore to walk with University
President Donald Kennedy to a
site where Gore will address stu

dents, probably Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
The Stanford Students for
Gore plan to set up an informa
tion booth this week in White
Plaza, Zipes said. "We are going
to try to make our booth in White
Plaza a permanent fixture on a
weekly basis/' he said.
Rosen said the Gore visit pro
vides a good example of how the
coalition is designed to work.
"We talked about how to handle
an event,"he said.
According to Rosen, "the idea
behind the coalition is that
despite partisan competiton, it is
important for the Stanford com
munity to hear the candidates.
The outline for the coalition
"states that each group must ac
cept the visit of I any ] candi
date," said Speakers Bureau
Manager Steve Struthers.
Rosen said the coalition will
try to involve other groups in or
ganizing candidates' visits, em

phasizing that coalition members
will not De"the exclusive guar
dians of appearances."
The coalition will be "sending
out letters and using contacts as a
group," said Jason Dominguez,
president of the Stanford College
Republicans.
Struthers said the group will
inform all of the candidates by
mail that a coalition has been
formed at Stanford to organize
candidate visits to the Univer
sity. Cline added that "some can
didates have asked Stanford to
pool its resources."
The standard procedure in the
future for dealing with a candi
date's visit will be for SIG and
the Speakers Bureau to arrange
the location and logistics of the
visit, Struthers saia. The appro
priate party group and the can
diate's campus organizing com
mittee will then be responsible
for publicity, providing "people
power and enthusiasm," he said.
