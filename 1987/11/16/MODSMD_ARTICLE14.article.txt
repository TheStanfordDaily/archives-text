## The
						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Preserve P/NC option 
### 
The pass/no credit option will be the focus of a
year-long review of Stanford's grading policy
begun earlier this month by the the University's
Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (CAAA).
Concern in recent years about student abuse
of the pass/no credit option has led some faculty
members to suggest that the option be removed
altogether and students be required to take all
classes for a grade.
Though it is unlikely that the CAAA will rec
ommend such a drastic move (especially since
reviews such as this, made about every three
years by the committee, have resulted in no
changes in the University's policy since 1975), it
is important to remind the CAAA that the
pass/no credit option is essential to the Univer
sity's goal of promoting liberal education.
When students are allowed to take classes
pass/no credit they are more likely to enroll in
courses outside their areas of academic strength.
Students who have difficulty with foreign lan
guages, for example, are unlikely to risk their
GPAs so that they can be exposed to another
culture's way of communicating. Students with
little background in the sciences would be dis
couraged from taking classes in that area be
cause their otherwise healthy transcripts could
be penalized by a poor mark.

The pass/no credit option does more than
eliminate the disincentive to students to take
classes outside their expertise â€” it encourages
students to do so. Knowing that there can be no
penalty for taking academic risks provides a
very good reason for taking them.
The current policy, therefore, serves the Uni
versity well in prompting students to take a
broad range of classes. To eliminate it would be
a mistake. But the CAAA should not ignore the
fact that the pass/no credit option is sometimes
abused and that students are able to make it
through classes with little or no work.
The committee should consider adding more
structure to the option. It should also define
more specifically what should constitute a pass
ing grade in any Stanford course. The definition
of pass varies widely from course to course, and
students find there is little reliability in its appli
cation.
Two years ago the University decided that
courses required for distribution requirements
had to be taken for a letter grade. This was a pru
dent move; it halted the erosion of the integrity
of those requirements.
The integrity of the pass/no credit option can
be maintained by strengthening the requirements
for passing.
