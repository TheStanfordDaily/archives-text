## Frats reach out to minorities 
### 
I am writing to clarify comments I made in a
Nov. 10 Daily article, "IFC to Address Gay Dis
crimination." In the last paragraph 1 said that "if a
fraternity collectively decides that they are uncom
fortable with homosexual members, which may
well be the case for most fraternities, I think they
have the right not to select them." 1 would like to
retract these remarks because I feel they are con
fusing and do not accurately reflect official Inter
fraternity Council policy.

I intended to say, as a previous paragraph sug
gested, that a fraternity has the right to exclude a
homosexual member only if that decision is based
on the characteristics of that individual other than
his sexual orientation.
Gay men must be judged by the same criteria that
apply to heterosexual men. That is, if a man can
make a valuable contribution to the organization
and add to the quality of the brotherhood of the fra
ternity he should be considered a potential candi
date, whether he is homosexual, bisexual or heter
osexual.
Prejudices and stereotypes based on misinforma
tion and pure ignorance often prevent thoughtful,
open-minded discussion and ultimate acceptance of
a group's differences. Fraternities can never be
comfortable with this situation. It is unfortunate
that my confusing remarks may have over
shadowed the positive steps the Interfraternity
Council (IFC) is now taking to promote greater un
derstanding of gay and lesbian issues.
It is unfortunate as well that the presence of
Samantha Phillips at our meeting was not noted in
the article. Samantha is the chair of the joint Inter
sorority Council-IFC Committee on the Promotion
of Diversity (within the fraternal system). Presenta
tions in fraternities by members of the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford (mentioned in the arti
cle) are only part of a comprehensive education

campaign, under Samantha's leadership, that will
promote greater fraternal understanding of partici
pation in minority issues. This committee will fur
ther IFC goals of reaching out to all minority
groups â€” not only to enlighten fraternal attitudes
but to interest minorities in the system so that we
can add to the diversity the system already enjoys.
To be fair, 1 would like to point out that the arti
cle contains a quote by BarbVoss that does not ac
curately reflect her intentions. When she says het
erosexual values are entrenched in fraternities she
does not suggest that those values should be dis
carded, but only that the homophobia that can be
an extension of those values be addressed so that
the fraternal atmosphere will be a more comforta
ble one for gay and lesbian people.
I would like to take this opportunity to applaud
the leaders of the gay and lesbian community, espe
cially Barb Voss, for the way in which they ap
proached these issues. When Barb heard my state
ments on KZSU that, to her, suggested a comfort
with the status quo, she could have voiced her
opinion in a provocative Daily article, or she could
have put pressure on the Office of Residential Edu
cation to reprimand me.
Instead, she arranged a meeting to talk with
fraternal representatives to reflect calmly and
thoughtfully on the problem and possible solutions.
This diplomatic approach has already initiated con
structive change, and it serves well as an example
for the leaders of any group who wish to further
their interests.
This approach tends to break down stereotypes
that exist on both sides and allows for positive
problem solving. This is why the IFC is willing to
meet with any groups with concerns about fraterni
ties at Stanford; greater communication will only
help our cause. I am strongly convinced that the
more people get to know fraternities and discover
what they really think about community issues, the
more they will respect fraternities and appreciate
their contributions.
Vinton Frost is president of the IFC.
