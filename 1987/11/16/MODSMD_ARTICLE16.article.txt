Police harassment
of blacks routine
It has been rumored that if you
are a black student at Stanford
there is a 99-percent chance you
will be harassed by the Stanford
Police.
Around midnight Nov. 6 we
were unnecessarily pulled over
and harassed by the Stanford
Police. The officer who ques
tioned us claims he was following
routine procedure, but are con
descension and hostility a part of
the routine?
We cooperated with the offi
cer. We gave him the driver's
license and registration he re
quested, but despite our coopera
tion he refused to tell us why we
had been pulled over and subse
quently detained. We complied
with all his "routine" demands,
including the demand that the
driver get out of the car, merely
to be further harassed by the offi
cer's partner about an alleged
"attitude problem."
All during this harassment no
violations on our part were ever
specified. Our persistence — he
called it "paranoia" — is what
eventually pressed him to point
out some violation. He said we
ran a stop sign.
We immediately refuted this
by fact. There were many people

in the crosswalk, and we knew he
was following us. We are not
stupid. We ran no stop sign; that
is evident to anyone.
Pressed, after he was caught in
the fallacy of his own argument,
the truth finally came out, and it
came out indeed. To quote the
officer, "We were responding to
a call about a black, uh, I mean
red compact car driving reck
lessly." Excuse us. Officer, what
was on your mind, the color of
our skin or the color of the car?
The answer is clear — our car is
burgundy.
We are not the first black stu
dents to complain about the be
havior of the Stanford Police De
partment, and we probably will
not be the last. The officer said
we were "paranoid." One might
say our "paranoia" brought on
his behavior. Our behavior,
however, is a direct result of
recurring incidents involving the
harassment of black students by
the Stanford Police.
Paranoia is a precaution when
you are a black on this campus.
Stanford has a responsibility to
insure that its students are not
subjected to this unnecessary,
racist, ignorant, dehumanizing
mistreatment.

Daily 'democracy'
ignores needs of
graduate students
The Daily editorial on Nov. 9
was down to its usual standards.
You did a great job of stereotyp
ing graduate students: "There
just aren't enough graduate stu
dents interested in being ASSU
senators." From a simple obser
vation to inane conclusions. You
don't even look at why graduate
students don't run. There are a
myriad of factors. One is, of
course, that a lot of graduate stu
dents don't get as involved as
they did as undergraduates. But
there are other reasons.
I, for one, am running this fall
because I didn't know last spring
whether I had the money to be
able to attend school this year. I
couldn t just ask my parents.
This is a problem that a lot of
graduate students have that
many undergraduates don't.
Also, we are also very in
volved in other projects. Not
only do master's candidates have
a heavy course schedule, and
Ph.D. candidates have comps,
quals and a lot of research, but a
large portion of graduate aid is in
teaching assistant positions.
Those positions take a lot of
time. Many students spend 30-40

hours a week on 50-percent posi
tions, which are defined as 20
hours per week. Until we know
those kinds of necessary commit
ments we don't know if we'll
have time for all the other things
we'd like to do.
The upcoming elections should
have been run less expensively.
There's no need for the voting
machines. But they should be run
— even though there aren't even
enough graduate candidates to
fill the available slots.
Democracy, as you suggest, al
lows that all interested people
should have a chance at taking
part in our systems. Some of the
positions available are those
vacated by people elected last
year who found out they had
other duties that had to take
precedence.
If democracy means people
shouldn't have a chance to fill at
least those positions, does that
mean you oppose special elec
tions in real government? Or,
since Bork was voted down, and
Ginsburg resigned, that we
should only have eight members
on the U.S. Supreme Court?
You seem to have an interest
ing view of democracy: Only let
people get involved when it suits
our purposes. That's a wonderful
view.

we were "paranoid." One might
say our "paranoia" brought on
his behavior. Our behavior,
however, is a direct result of
recurring incidents involving the
harassment of black students by
the Stanford Police.
Paranoia is a precaution when
you are a black on this campus.
Stanford has a responsibility to
insure that its students are not
subjected to this unnecessary,
racist, ignorant, dehumanizing
mistreatment.

Daily 'democracy'
ignores needs of
graduate students
The Daily editorial on Nov. 9
was down to its usual standards.
You did a great job of stereotyp
ing graduate students: "There
just aren't enough graduate stu
dents interested in being ASSU
senators." From a simple obser
vation to inane conclusions. You
don't even look at why graduate
students don't run. There are a
myriad of factors. One is, of
course, that a lot of graduate stu
dents don't get as involved as
they did as undergraduates. But
there are other reasons.
I, for one, am running this fall
because I didn't know last spring
whether I had the money to be
able to attend school this year. I
couldn t just ask my parents.
This is a problem that a lot of
graduate students have that
many undergraduates don't.
Also, we are also very in
volved in other projects. Not
only do master's candidates have
a heavy course schedule, and
Ph.D. candidates have comps,
quals and a lot of research, but a
large portion of graduate aid is in
teaching assistant positions.
Those positions take a lot of
time. Many students spend 30-40

hours a week on 50-percent posi
tions, which are defined as 20
hours per week. Until we know
those kinds of necessary commit
ments we don't know if we'll
have time for all the other things
we'd like to do.
The upcoming elections should
have been run less expensively.
There's no need for the voting
machines. But they should be run
— even though there aren't even
enough graduate candidates to
fill the available slots.
Democracy, as you suggest, al
lows that all interested people
should have a chance at taking
part in our systems. Some of the
positions available are those
vacated by people elected last
year who found out they had
other duties that had to take
precedence.
If democracy means people
shouldn't have a chance to fill at
least those positions, does that
mean you oppose special elec
tions in real government? Or,
since Bork was voted down, and
Ginsburg resigned, that we
should only have eight members
on the U.S. Supreme Court?
You seem to have an interest
ing view of democracy: Only let
people get involved when it suits
our purposes. That's a wonderful
view.

Police harassment
of blacks routine
It has been rumored that if you
are a black student at Stanford
there is a 99-percent chance you
will be harassed by the Stanford
Police.
Around midnight Nov. 6 we
were unnecessarily pulled over
and harassed by the Stanford
Police. The officer who ques
tioned us claims he was following
routine procedure, but are con
descension and hostility a part of
the routine?
We cooperated with the offi
cer. We gave him the driver's
license and registration he re
quested, but despite our coopera
tion he refused to tell us why we
had been pulled over and subse
quently detained. We complied
with all his "routine" demands,
including the demand that the
driver get out of the car, merely
to be further harassed by the offi
cer's partner about an alleged
"attitude problem."
All during this harassment no
violations on our part were ever
specified. Our persistence — he
called it "paranoia" — is what
eventually pressed him to point
out some violation. He said we
ran a stop sign.
We immediately refuted this
by fact. There were many people

in the crosswalk, and we knew he
was following us. We are not
stupid. We ran no stop sign; that
is evident to anyone.
Pressed, after he was caught in
the fallacy of his own argument,
the truth finally came out, and it
came out indeed. To quote the
officer, "We were responding to
a call about a black, uh, I mean
red compact car driving reck
lessly." Excuse us. Officer, what
was on your mind, the color of
our skin or the color of the car?
The answer is clear — our car is
burgundy.
We are not the first black stu
dents to complain about the be
havior of the Stanford Police De
partment, and we probably will
not be the last. The officer said
we were "paranoid." One might
say our "paranoia" brought on
his behavior. Our behavior,
however, is a direct result of
