# Supporting other sports
## 
### 
Two frothing-at-the-mouth alumni wrote the
Daily last week in order to complain about what
lousy football fans we students are. We leave
games early, we watch the Dollies and the Band,
and we even have the nerve to celebrate when the
team scores a field goal (instead of getting that all
important touchdown.)
Normally I would ignore such silliness, but I've
heard comments like these so many times in the
past few weeks that I'm going to take some time to
set the story straight.
Common Misconception No. 1: Football is Stan
ford's only sport.

This is just plain not true, and by the way, the
one about God declaring football the supreme sport
isn't true either. The hard-working rowers, run
ners, wrestlers and other athletes at this school are
not any less deserving of our support than the foot
ball players. But one football game draws more
people than all the other sports draw in a month. It
seems to me, then, that even if we are lousy foot
ball fans, we are certainly far better football fans
than we are fans of any other sport. So instead of
complaining about our football habits these alumni
should set out to improve our attendance at other
sporting events. *
And for future reference, you die-hard football
buffs, before you even consider telling me again
what a lousy football fan I am, please keep in mind
that 1 am going to require prooi of your attendance
at at least one event in each of the other fall varsity
sports before you will be allowed to complain.
But don't worry, you'll probably enjoy these
other events: Chances are good that you won't be
distracted- by either the Dollies or the Band. And
this brings us to Common Misconception No. 2. . .
Common Misconception No. 2: Leland Stanford
founded this University so that its future alumni
would be able to enjoy good football.
Once again we have a rumor devoid of any truth
ful substance. Sports are just some of the many
things that go on at this University, and they are
not any better or any worse than other pursuits
(Two particular examples of which are music and
dancing).
The members of the Band and the Dollies work
hard to do what they do. If they happen to look like
they are having fun, it's because they are. But that
doesn't make their accomplishments any less
valuable.
So, before anyone starts spouting off again about
how impudent we are to have the preposterous idea
of watching the Band, perhaps they should instead
be asking themselves why they are so narrow
minded about what constitutes a good activity. If

those of us who watch both the team and the Band
are to be called lousy football fans, then those who
watch just the team are certainly horrid patrons of
the arts — and people who live in glass houses
shouldn't be throwing stones.
Stop right there, buster! Now I know you're
about to declare that the football team supports the
Band, and not the other way around, as if this
makes a difference. This is a university, not the real
world, and that means that one pursuit is not given
precedence over another for either financial or
popularity reasons.
The University is not going to drop the Classics
Department because it doesn't attract as many
majors as the human biology program; nor is it
going to drop English because English majors
aren't paid as well immediately after graduation as
computer science majors. Similarly, the real world
appeal of the football team is not relevant here to
making decisions about what to support and what
not to.
Common Misconception No. 3: Winning is
everything.
Many novices fall for this one; but if you're inter
ested in having a balanced, happy and mature life,
it's attitude that is all-important. Although we
would all like the football team to win, there is no
reason to get unduly upset if it doesn't. And the
fact that the Band and many students are happy
after a field goal is just a reflection of the team's
positive attitude: While the "real fans" are busy
complaining that they missed the touchdown, the
rest of us are happily celebrating the field goal.
There is, I think, an important lesson to be gained
from this, and even though this attitude may make
someone a less-than-perfect football fan, it cer-i
tainly makes them a better overall person.
Common Misconception No. 4: Much like the
first Olympics at Athens, college football today is a
celebration of body, training and determination and
is done for no reason other than itself.
Sorry, but just like the Olympics, Stanford foot
ball has long since left the purely athletic arena.
Football here is as much an entertainment and a
business as it is an athletic endeavor, and the foot
ball players reap the rewards of this.
When people say that the team isn't supported,
just what exactly is it that they are comparing it to?
Football has to be the single most supported activ
ity on campus. When the rest of us — including
many other athletes who work just as hard as they
do — get our bills every quarter, football players
get a check. They get different food. They get their
own weight room. They get five years of school,
during one of which they don't even play.
Now I don't begrudge them these perks, and it's
nice to know that at least a few people aren't losing
their shirts here. But then again 1 can't feel terribly
sympathetic when someone says the team is not
supported as it should be. Those of us who buy in
dividual student tickets to Big Game will be paying
$22 just to support the team for one game.

from this, and even though this attitude may make
someone a less-than-perfect football fan, it cer-i
tainly makes them a better overall person.
Common Misconception No. 4: Much like the
first Olympics at Athens, college football today is a
celebration of body, training and determination and
is done for no reason other than itself.
Sorry, but just like the Olympics, Stanford foot
ball has long since left the purely athletic arena.
Football here is as much an entertainment and a
business as it is an athletic endeavor, and the foot
ball players reap the rewards of this.
When people say that the team isn't supported,
just what exactly is it that they are comparing it to?
Football has to be the single most supported activ
ity on campus. When the rest of us — including
many other athletes who work just as hard as they
do — get our bills every quarter, football players
get a check. They get different food. They get their
own weight room. They get five years of school,
during one of which they don't even play.
Now I don't begrudge them these perks, and it's
nice to know that at least a few people aren't losing
their shirts here. But then again 1 can't feel terribly
sympathetic when someone says the team is not
supported as it should be. Those of us who buy in
dividual student tickets to Big Game will be paying
$22 just to support the team for one game.

Two frothing-at-the-mouth alumni wrote the
Daily last week in order to complain about what
lousy football fans we students are. We leave
games early, we watch the Dollies and the Band,
and we even have the nerve to celebrate when the
team scores a field goal (instead of getting that all
important touchdown.)
Normally I would ignore such silliness, but I've
heard comments like these so many times in the
past few weeks that I'm going to take some time to
set the story straight.
Common Misconception No. 1: Football is Stan
ford's only sport.

This is just plain not true, and by the way, the
one about God declaring football the supreme sport
isn't true either. The hard-working rowers, run
ners, wrestlers and other athletes at this school are
not any less deserving of our support than the foot
ball players. But one football game draws more
people than all the other sports draw in a month. It
seems to me, then, that even if we are lousy foot
ball fans, we are certainly far better football fans
than we are fans of any other sport. So instead of
complaining about our football habits these alumni
should set out to improve our attendance at other
sporting events. *
And for future reference, you die-hard football
buffs, before you even consider telling me again
what a lousy football fan I am, please keep in mind
that 1 am going to require prooi of your attendance
at at least one event in each of the other fall varsity
sports before you will be allowed to complain.
But don't worry, you'll probably enjoy these
other events: Chances are good that you won't be
distracted- by either the Dollies or the Band. And
this brings us to Common Misconception No. 2. . .
Common Misconception No. 2: Leland Stanford
founded this University so that its future alumni
would be able to enjoy good football.
Once again we have a rumor devoid of any truth
ful substance. Sports are just some of the many
things that go on at this University, and they are
not any better or any worse than other pursuits
(Two particular examples of which are music and
dancing).
The members of the Band and the Dollies work
hard to do what they do. If they happen to look like
they are having fun, it's because they are. But that
doesn't make their accomplishments any less
valuable.
So, before anyone starts spouting off again about
how impudent we are to have the preposterous idea
of watching the Band, perhaps they should instead
be asking themselves why they are so narrow
minded about what constitutes a good activity. If

those of us who watch both the team and the Band
are to be called lousy football fans, then those who
watch just the team are certainly horrid patrons of
the arts — and people who live in glass houses
shouldn't be throwing stones.
Stop right there, buster! Now I know you're
about to declare that the football team supports the
Band, and not the other way around, as if this
makes a difference. This is a university, not the real
world, and that means that one pursuit is not given
precedence over another for either financial or
popularity reasons.
The University is not going to drop the Classics
Department because it doesn't attract as many
majors as the human biology program; nor is it
going to drop English because English majors
aren't paid as well immediately after graduation as
computer science majors. Similarly, the real world
appeal of the football team is not relevant here to
making decisions about what to support and what
not to.
Common Misconception No. 3: Winning is
everything.
Many novices fall for this one; but if you're inter
ested in having a balanced, happy and mature life,
it's attitude that is all-important. Although we
would all like the football team to win, there is no
reason to get unduly upset if it doesn't. And the
fact that the Band and many students are happy
after a field goal is just a reflection of the team's
positive attitude: While the "real fans" are busy
complaining that they missed the touchdown, the
rest of us are happily celebrating the field goal.
There is, I think, an important lesson to be gained
from this, and even though this attitude may make
someone a less-than-perfect football fan, it cer-i
