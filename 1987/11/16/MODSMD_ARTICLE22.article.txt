## Dance Division seeks to spread joy of dancing

Mark Carter, a Ph.D. candi
date in physics, took a dance
class for the first time last spring
and fell in love with the art form.
"My life has been forever
changed," he said.
According to faculty members
and students in the Athletic De
partment's Dance Division,
Carter is not alone in this experi
ence. "There is something be
hind the technique of dance,"
said Tony Kramer, a faculty lec
turer in the department. "Dance
has a relationship to our lives. In
dance we develop control over
our beings. We learn creativity.
We learn to trust ourselves. The
mind-body problem is no longer a
problem," he said.
Located in Roble Studios, the
Dance Division offers a diverse
range of dance classes, including
modern dance, jazz, ethnic dance
and folk dance.
According to Kramer, there
has been an upsurge of enroll
ment and enthusiasm in recent
years, particularly in the modern
dance classes. Enrollment in the
division's Modern Dance class
has nearly doubled since last fall.
Of the 95 students enrolled in
Modern Dance this quarter, a
good proportion are men,

Kramer said. Students in Modern
Dance include inexperienced
beginners, as well as individuals
with strong backgrounds in ballet
or figure skating, he said.

k Not enough people
know about [the Dance
Division] and not
enough people take the
time to notice it.
Anyone at Stanford
who has the opportu
nity to take just one
course should try.'

candidate in physics

Senior lecturer Inga Weiss said
she is pleased with the division's
success at attracting so many dif
ferent students. "Roble Dance
Studio is like a Roman forum.
We see students — freshmen to
Ph.D.s — of very different fields
who find themselves united men
tally, spiritually and physically
through dance," she said.

Junior Adrienne Greaves
praised the Dance Division and
said that "the dance faculty give
students personal attention and
are interested in people as dan
cers, not as mere bodies."
Beyond offering introductory
dance classes, the division also
encourages exposure to profes
sional dancing.
In the more advanced Modern
Dance 111 class offered this quar
ter, for example, Weiss arranged
for students to receive instruc
tion from a number of different
Bay Area guest artists.
In addition to offering the more
popular modern dance and jazz
classes, the division also tries to
present an academic side to
dancing. A class in "dance heri
tage" is designed to help stu
dents analyze the history of
dance forms and study special
dance techniques.
This year the course will focus
on the Graham dance technique
and will be taught by David
Chase, a former member of the
well-known Martha Graham
Dance Company. Janice Ross, a
dance critic for the Oakland
Tribune, will also give lectures
for the class.

The division has recently
branched out to undertake
several new projects.
Lecturers Kramer and Jancy
Limpert began work this summer
on a film documentary series
about the life of local dancer
Lucas Hoving. Although filming
for the series has been com
pleted, the project is currently
undergoing editing. The
videotape will be released to the
Stanford Instructional Television
Network next year.
Kramer also traveled to New
York this summer to perform a
solo for the dance performance
portion of the "Stanford Artists
in New York" exhibit, a showing
of Stanford paintings, sculptures
and other artwork organized by
the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion.
The division sponsors a num
ber of dance ensembles around
campus. The Stanford Contem

porary Dance Ensemble is an ex
ample of a troupe that has
become strong and active within
only two years of its formation.
Established in 1985, the en
semble now consists of 14 inter
mediate and advanced dancers
who perform in campus and Bay
Area concerts.

k Dance has a relation
ship to our lives. In
dance, we develop con
trol over our beings.
We learn creativity.
We learn to trust our
selves/
— Tony Kramer

Choreography and improvisa
tions designed by Kramer and
Limpert will comprise the en
semble's first showing this year
at a convalescent hospital in Palo
Alto on December 4. In addition

to oneoing appearances in Stan
ford dorms, the group also plans
performances at Hayward and
Berkeley later in the school year.
The division also encourages
students to choreograph their
own solos and improvisations.
Many students perform their own
pieces as part of the division's
spring dance festival, "Spring
Migration."
The division also hosts numer
ous concerts throughout the
year. Every winter quarter, for
example, faculty lecturers put on
the tradional "Dance Division in
Concert" at Roble Studios. Ac
cording to Kramer, many stu
dent at Stanford are good
enough to dance professionally.
"The Dance Division is really
strong and I wish more people
would appreciate it," Senko
said.
Carter agreed, adding that
"not enough people know about
[the division], and not enough
people take the time to notice it.
Anyone at Stanford who has the
opportunity to take just one
course should try," he said.
