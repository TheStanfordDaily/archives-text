## Dance Division seeks to spread joy of dancing

Mark Carter, a Ph.D. candi
date in physics, took a dance
class for the first time last spring
and fell in love with the art form.
"My life has been forever
changed," he said.
According to faculty members
and students in the Athletic De
partment's Dance Division,
Carter is not alone in this experi
ence. "There is something be
hind the technique of dance,"
said Tony Kramer, a faculty lec
turer in the department. "Dance
has a relationship to our lives. In
dance we develop control over
our beings. We learn creativity.
We learn to trust ourselves. The
mind-body problem is no longer a
problem," he said.
Located in Roble Studios, the
Dance Division offers a diverse
range of dance classes, including
modern dance, jazz, ethnic dance
and folk dance.
According to Kramer, there
has been an upsurge of enroll
ment and enthusiasm in recent
years, particularly in the modern
dance classes. Enrollment in the
division's Modern Dance class
has nearly doubled since last fall.
Of the 95 students enrolled in
Modern Dance this quarter, a
good proportion are men,

Kramer said. Students in Modern
Dance include inexperienced
beginners, as well as individuals
with strong backgrounds in ballet
or figure skating, he said.

k Not enough people
know about [the Dance
Division] and not
enough people take the
time to notice it.
Anyone at Stanford
who has the opportu
nity to take just one
course should try.'

candidate in physics

Senior lecturer Inga Weiss said
she is pleased with the division's
success at attracting so many dif
ferent students. "Roble Dance
Studio is like a Roman forum.
We see students — freshmen to
Ph.D.s — of very different fields
who find themselves united men
tally, spiritually and physically
through dance," she said.

Junior Adrienne Greaves
praised the Dance Division and
said that "the dance faculty give
students personal attention and
are interested in people as dan
cers, not as mere bodies."
Beyond offering introductory
dance classes, the division also
encourages exposure to profes
sional dancing.
In the more advanced Modern
Dance 111 class offered this quar
ter, for example, Weiss arranged
for students to receive instruc
tion from a number of different
Bay Area guest artists.
In addition to offering the more
popular modern dance and jazz
classes, the division also tries to
present an academic side to
dancing. A class in "dance heri
tage" is designed to help stu
dents analyze the history of
dance forms and study special
dance techniques.
This year the course will focus
on the Graham dance technique
and will be taught by David
Chase, a former member of the
well-known Martha Graham
Dance Company. Janice Ross, a
dance critic for the Oakland
Tribune, will also give lectures
for the class.
