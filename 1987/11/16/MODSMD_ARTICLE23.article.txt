### Mark Lokensgard 
Saturday, Nov. 14 marked the begin
ning of a new era. Or so say participants
in the Hunger Project, an international
nonprofit organization committed to
ending death by starvation by the year
2000.
The Hunger Project marked the begin
ning of its second decade Saturday in a
four-hour satellite teleconference, which
was viewed by over 50.(MM) people in
more than 70 cities in 18 countries.
Locally, the teleconference was
watched by groups in San Francisco,
Berkeley and San Jose. Altogether,
about 700 Bay Area residents partici
pated.
Broadcast from New York City in
English, the program was simultane
ously translated into each participating
country's language. Some of these in
cluded: Mandarin Chinese, Hindi,
Shona in Kenya and Swahili in Zambia.
John Denver and Werner Erhard, co
founders of The Hunger Project, spoke,
as did Robert McNamara, former U.S.

Secretary of Defense, and Javier Perez
de Cuellar, Secretary General of the
United Nations.
The purpose of the program was to
review what the project has accom
plished over the last 10 years and to
preview its goals for the next 13 years.
Since 1977 the Hunger Project has
worked to change the dream of ending
world hunger into an attainable goal.
Now, according to Erhard, it is time to
change that goal into an opportunity for
action.
The Hunger Project seeks to educate
people about hunger: where it is a prob
lem, what has worked in the past to com
bat it and what action is being taken now
to end.
Individuals can officially enroll in the
Hunger Project by signing a card that
says, "By personal declaration, the
Hunger Project is mine completely. I
commit myself to making the end of the
persistence of hunger and starvation an
idea whose time has come." The project
counts 5.2 million people in 152
countries as members.

Dr. Edward Perper, a Stanford gradu
ate and now a cardiology fellow at the
Stanford Medical Center has taken on
the project of enrolling people from the
Stanford community in the Hunger Proj
ect.

'Next to the nuclear threat, hunger is our biggest problem,
yet it receives little attention proportionate to its size. For
instance, 35,000 people die every day of starvation, more
people than have died of AIDS to date. This doesn't
undermine the AIDS problem, but it indicates our
disproportionate attention on these issues/
â€” Dr. Edward Perper

"l thought Stanford would be a great
place to enroll people because during my
years as an undergraduate I saw an
idealism that wasn't just hopeful and
wishy-washy, but a sort of tough
idealism that led to action," he said. "I
think students here are willing to listen

to this project without resignation, but
as a real possibility. Students [at Stan
ford) are people with vision."
"Next to the nuclear threat, hunger is
our biggest problem," Perper said, "yet
it receives little attention proportionate

to its size. For instance, 35,(KM) people
die every day of starvation, more people
than have died of AIDS to date. This
doesn't undermine the AIDS problem,
but it indicates our disproportionate at
tention on these issues."
"There are very few avenues an indi

vidual can take to help combat AIDS,
but the problem of hunger can be ad
dressed by many people in a wide vari
ety of ways," he said.
According to Perper, the Hunger Proj
ect is based on a conviction that ending
hunger is possible today.
"Only in the last 20 years or so has the
technology existed to end hunger. In
fact, over 50 countries since 1960 have
ended death by starvation as an issue.
This is why we can view ending hunger
not as a noble cause or as something that
we'd like to see happen, but as a real
possibility," he said.
"Enrolling people in the Hunger Proj
ect changes the way people think about
hunger, he said, adding that enlighten
ing people will "lead to action, whether
it be by talking about hunger differently
with others or by organizing a project of
some kind."
Throughout the teleconference
speakers focused on empowering indi
viduals to take action to end hunger on
their own. without waiting for govern
ments or development agencies to act.
