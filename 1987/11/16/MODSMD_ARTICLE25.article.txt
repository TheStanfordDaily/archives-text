## Heaney revives the sonnet in an Irish rhythm

"The Haw Lantern"
By Seamuß Heanev
Farrar, Straus & Glroux, New
York
$12.99
The poetry of Seamus Heaney
has always taken us to Ireland, a
land he portrays as at once myth
ological and reulistic, domestic
and political, ancient and
modern.
Dualities cross and recross the
life of this Irish poet. Although
Derrv-born, he is now a
Dubliner. And he spends half of
each year away from Ireland —
teaching at Harvard, where he is
Boylston Professor of Rhetoric
and Oratory.
Heaney achieves a rare feat in
the literary marketplace: His
work garners both commercial
and critical attention.
"The Haw Lantern" is
Heaney's first published collec
tion since "Station Inland*' in
1985. "Station Island" was
based on Irish themes and was a
meditative companion to
Heaney's 1984 translation of
"Sweeney Astray," an old Irish
adventure. That the rhythms of
Heaney's verse were so effec
tively able to modernize Irish an
tiquity attracted much attention
to the natural and almost unfelt
force of his voice. In"The Haw
Lantern" this voice is once apain
§ resent, although now it lives
eneath the surface of a poetry
addressing new territories.
Most noteworthy in this collec
tion is "Clearances," a series of
sonnets written as a memoriam

to the poet's mother.
The sonnet in English is a form
so thoroughly worked that it has
long suffered from being too
easily filled; its frame has
become fatty. This is not to sug
gest that we have laid it to rest. It
finds practitioners in each gener
ation. who snatch it from its
deathbed — as, say, E.E. Cum
mings and Robert Lowell did ear
lier in this century. Heaney may
well be one in this generation to
do the same.

"Clearances" derives its
shape from two well-worn forms
— the sonnet and the elegy. But
in Heaney's hands these prod
ucts of traditional poetic culture
read with a striking freshness.
For a contemporary Irish poet
to write a sequence of sonnets (a
structure so associated with the
literature of the colonizing Eng

lish) is also something of note.
W.B. Yeats, for example,
shunned the sonnet for most of
hii career, feeling perhaps that to
develop an artistic culture exclu
sively Irish within the English
language was hard enough as it
was — trying to contain Irish
themes and tonalities within an
English form would simply have
been another type of political and
societal incarceration. However,
when Yeats did write an occa
sional sonnet, as in "Leda and
the Swan," the effect was tre
mendous.
Heaney takes on the sonnet in
full force, and he does make it
new. "Clearances" is prefaced
with a short lyrical memory, that
of the poet as a child recalling his
mother s advice on the chore of
coal-splitting. It is the sound he
remembers, the "obliterated
echo," and it is the sound he then
invokes as his muse: "Teach me
now to listen." The eight sonnets
that follow are about the act of
cutting away, the loss of sunder
ing, the search for return, for the
ecno.
Heaney's recollections of his
mother arc decidedly domestic.
He tells of folding linens at home,
of affectionate situations that slip
into verbal awkwardness, of
impressions of sitting together
Easter week in a crowded church
and of one particular Sunday
peeling potatoes in the kitchen —
a moment out of Frost in its
physical intensity, a moment that
formed a connection sustained
until her death: "I remembered
her head bent towards my heud,/
Her breath in mine, our fluent
dipping knives — / Never closer
the whole rest of our lives."

Heaney's language moves him
seamlessly between voices in de
scribing these scenes. He is at
times declaratory: "Fear of af
fection made her affect/ Inade
quacy whenever it came to/
Prounouncing words 'beyond
her.'
And at times his writing is
compressed and sensuous —
"Dippings. Towelings. The
water breathed on./ The water
mixed with chrism and with oil./
Cruet tinkle." Heaney is also ca
pable of metaphorical surprises:
"When all the others were away
at Mass/ I was all hers as we
peeled potatoes./ They broke the
silence, let fall one by one/ Like
solder weeping off the soldering
iron."
It is in a combination of im
agination and declarative voice
that Heaney stores the moment
of separation: "Then she was
dead./ The searching for a pul
sebeut was abandoned/ And we

all knew one thing by being
there./ The space we stood
around had been emptied/ Into us
to keep. it penetrated/
Clearances that suddenly stood
open." The modulation is from
the world of fact to the world of
poetry; art constructs a medium
to familiarize and face the aliena
tion of death.
The sequence s final note, the
concluding eighth sonnet, is both
an epilogue to loss and a synthe
sis of recovery. In its confronta
tion of the emptiness of separa
tion. of the work of the hatchet
cuttinu its clearance, leaving
"shocked tips and wreckage," it
seems to invite us to despair.
And yet there is in a clearance a
suggestion of open spaces, a
swept heart and a new life.
Heaney's attentive ear can't

catch his mother's "soul ramify
ing and forever silent," but in
that mystery of its unseen, un
heard expansion is a kind of af
firmation.
"The Haw Lantern" has much
to offer outside this string of son
nets. Heaney writes politically
and powerfully in "Parable Is
land." "Wolfe Tone" is a histori
cal poem told in the voice of an
Irish revolutionary. "The Sum
mer of Lost Rachel" takes the
dirge to the pastoral. The sen
sibility of the writer and his act of
exploring the mind is woven with
politics in"From the Frontier of
Writing." And of course it is al
ways with old Eire that the sad
song ends: Heaney's "The Dis
appearing Island," the "island
[that] broke beneath us like a
wave" can be none other.

"The Haw Lantern" has much

"The Haw Lantern"
By Seamuß Heanev
Farrar, Straus & Glroux, New
York
$12.99
The poetry of Seamus Heaney
has always taken us to Ireland, a
land he portrays as at once myth
ological and reulistic, domestic
and political, ancient and
modern.
Dualities cross and recross the
life of this Irish poet. Although
Derrv-born, he is now a
Dubliner. And he spends half of
each year away from Ireland —
teaching at Harvard, where he is
Boylston Professor of Rhetoric
and Oratory.
Heaney achieves a rare feat in
the literary marketplace: His
work garners both commercial
and critical attention.
"The Haw Lantern" is
Heaney's first published collec
tion since "Station Inland*' in
1985. "Station Island" was
based on Irish themes and was a
meditative companion to
Heaney's 1984 translation of
"Sweeney Astray," an old Irish
adventure. That the rhythms of
Heaney's verse were so effec
tively able to modernize Irish an
tiquity attracted much attention
to the natural and almost unfelt
force of his voice. In"The Haw
Lantern" this voice is once apain
§ resent, although now it lives
eneath the surface of a poetry
addressing new territories.
Most noteworthy in this collec
tion is "Clearances," a series of
sonnets written as a memoriam

to the poet's mother.
The sonnet in English is a form
so thoroughly worked that it has
long suffered from being too
easily filled; its frame has
become fatty. This is not to sug
gest that we have laid it to rest. It
finds practitioners in each gener
ation. who snatch it from its
deathbed — as, say, E.E. Cum
mings and Robert Lowell did ear
lier in this century. Heaney may
well be one in this generation to
do the same.

"Clearances" derives its
shape from two well-worn forms
— the sonnet and the elegy. But
in Heaney's hands these prod
ucts of traditional poetic culture
read with a striking freshness.
For a contemporary Irish poet
to write a sequence of sonnets (a
structure so associated with the
literature of the colonizing Eng

lish) is also something of note.
W.B. Yeats, for example,
shunned the sonnet for most of
hii career, feeling perhaps that to
develop an artistic culture exclu
sively Irish within the English
language was hard enough as it
was — trying to contain Irish
themes and tonalities within an
English form would simply have
been another type of political and
societal incarceration. However,
when Yeats did write an occa
sional sonnet, as in "Leda and
the Swan," the effect was tre
mendous.
Heaney takes on the sonnet in
full force, and he does make it
new. "Clearances" is prefaced
with a short lyrical memory, that
of the poet as a child recalling his
mother s advice on the chore of
coal-splitting. It is the sound he
remembers, the "obliterated
echo," and it is the sound he then
invokes as his muse: "Teach me
now to listen." The eight sonnets
that follow are about the act of
cutting away, the loss of sunder
ing, the search for return, for the
ecno.
Heaney's recollections of his
mother arc decidedly domestic.
He tells of folding linens at home,
of affectionate situations that slip
into verbal awkwardness, of
impressions of sitting together
Easter week in a crowded church
and of one particular Sunday
peeling potatoes in the kitchen —
a moment out of Frost in its
physical intensity, a moment that
formed a connection sustained
until her death: "I remembered
her head bent towards my heud,/
Her breath in mine, our fluent
dipping knives — / Never closer
the whole rest of our lives."

Heaney's language moves him
seamlessly between voices in de
scribing these scenes. He is at
times declaratory: "Fear of af
fection made her affect/ Inade
quacy whenever it came to/
Prounouncing words 'beyond
her.'
And at times his writing is
compressed and sensuous —
"Dippings. Towelings. The
water breathed on./ The water
mixed with chrism and with oil./
Cruet tinkle." Heaney is also ca
pable of metaphorical surprises:
"When all the others were away
at Mass/ I was all hers as we
peeled potatoes./ They broke the
silence, let fall one by one/ Like
solder weeping off the soldering
iron."
It is in a combination of im
agination and declarative voice
that Heaney stores the moment
of separation: "Then she was
dead./ The searching for a pul
sebeut was abandoned/ And we

all knew one thing by being
there./ The space we stood
around had been emptied/ Into us
to keep. it penetrated/
Clearances that suddenly stood
open." The modulation is from
the world of fact to the world of
poetry; art constructs a medium
to familiarize and face the aliena
tion of death.
The sequence s final note, the
concluding eighth sonnet, is both
an epilogue to loss and a synthe
sis of recovery. In its confronta
tion of the emptiness of separa
tion. of the work of the hatchet
cuttinu its clearance, leaving
"shocked tips and wreckage," it
seems to invite us to despair.
