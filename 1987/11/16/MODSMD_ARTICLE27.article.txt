## Defense dams Beavers, Card romps 38-7 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
CORVALLIS, Ore. â€” There is an old football
adage that says those who live by the pass die by
the pass.
It that s the case, then Oregon State quarterback
Erik Wilhelm met an untimely demise Saturday af
ternoon at Parker Stadium.
I he Stantord detense, which has had problems
against the pass all year, picked off seven Wilhelm
passes and broke up 11 more of the sophomore's 54
attempts as the Cardinal crushed the Beavers 38-7
before a meager crowd of 15,751.
"The outside linebackers played with a whole lot
of intensity," said Stanford Coach Jack Elway,
who brought in additional defensive backs to com
bat the Oregon State "Air Express." "The defense
reacted well and went to the football, which is
something we hadn't done recently."
The win upped Stanford's record to 3-4 in the
Pacific 10 Conference and 4-6 overall heading into
Big Game at Stanford Saturday. Oregon State
remains winless in league action with an 0-6 record.
The Beavers are 2-8 overall.
"This is by far the low point of my career at
Oregon State, there's no question about that,"
Oregon State Coach Dave Kragthorpe said. "Our
defense was horrible in the first half, but they
played decent in the second half. The offense was
horrible all day."
So horrible, in fact, that Stanford held the
Beavers to an incredible two yards rushing the
entire game. The Cardinal offense, on the other
hand, amassed 261 yards on the ground. Fullback
Brad Muster led the squad with 159 yards and two
touchowns on 20 carries, and that was in just the
first half. One of Muster's scores came on a 67-yard
run, the longest touchdown of his Stanford career.
The senior sat out the second half after slightly
re-spraining his injured left ankle in the second
quarter. "Some guy fell on it, and it really stiffened
at the half," said Muster, who is not expected to
miss any playing time against California."l didn't
feel that bad. but there were guys who could fill in,
and I didn't feel pressured to play."
There was no need to take any chances with
Muster. The weather was cold, the turf was slick

and the Cardinal offense had demonstrated that it
had no problem scoring against the Oregon State
defense and led 28-7 at the half.
Quarterback Brian Johnson was in top form,
finishing on 13 of 21 passes for 193 yards and three
scores. The sophomore, who had thrown nine in
terceptions in the previous three games, had only
one pass picked off, and that came on an outstand
ing defensive play by Rich Haggerty off a tipped
pass in the third quarter.
"I though Brian Johnson showed good poise all
day," Elway said. " He obviously got one of the big
plays of the game on the streak to (Ed) McCaffrey
for the touchdown."
That touchdown, a 49-yard scoring pass early in
the fourth quarter, put the Cardinal up 38-7 and
ended the scoring for the day, as Johnson lofted the
ball perfectly into the hands of wide receiver
McCaffrey, who was sprinting down the right
sideline.
"We set that one up pretty well," Johnson said.
"There were a lot of short curl routes, and I had to
pump fake because you want the cornerback to
bite. If he bites, you have it. It's kind of an all-or
nothing deal."
Things were going so badly for the Beavers by
then that the Oregon State band broke into a
spirited rendition of "All Right Now" and the
Oregon State cheerleaders cheered follwing the
score, Stanford's fifth touchdown of the game.
Although the Stanford offense was done scoring,
the Stanford defense was still busy collecting Wil
hem's passes. Safety Brad Humphreys had hauled
in two interceptions in the first half, Brad Cook got
a theft on a flea-flicker in the third quarter and an
acrobatic Rob Englehardt pick set up that final Car
dinal touohdown, but there was more to come.
In the folirth quarter. Cook ended a Beaver drive
with a nifty over-the-shoulder interception at the
Stanford 19-yard line. There were no visible
Oregon State receivers near the ball, and the ever
dwindling crowd loudly booed Wilhelm.
On the very first play of the Beaver s next pos
session, the frustrated quarterback hit Stanford
linebacker Jono Tunney over the middle. The fol
lowing Oregon State series got even the second
