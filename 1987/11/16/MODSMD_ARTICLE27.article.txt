## Defense dams Beavers, Card romps 38-7 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
CORVALLIS, Ore. â€” There is an old football
adage that says those who live by the pass die by
the pass.
It that s the case, then Oregon State quarterback
Erik Wilhelm met an untimely demise Saturday af
ternoon at Parker Stadium.
I he Stantord detense, which has had problems
against the pass all year, picked off seven Wilhelm
passes and broke up 11 more of the sophomore's 54
attempts as the Cardinal crushed the Beavers 38-7
before a meager crowd of 15,751.
"The outside linebackers played with a whole lot
of intensity," said Stanford Coach Jack Elway,
who brought in additional defensive backs to com
bat the Oregon State "Air Express." "The defense
reacted well and went to the football, which is
something we hadn't done recently."
The win upped Stanford's record to 3-4 in the
Pacific 10 Conference and 4-6 overall heading into
Big Game at Stanford Saturday. Oregon State
remains winless in league action with an 0-6 record.
The Beavers are 2-8 overall.
"This is by far the low point of my career at
Oregon State, there's no question about that,"
Oregon State Coach Dave Kragthorpe said. "Our
defense was horrible in the first half, but they
played decent in the second half. The offense was
horrible all day."
So horrible, in fact, that Stanford held the
Beavers to an incredible two yards rushing the
entire game. The Cardinal offense, on the other
hand, amassed 261 yards on the ground. Fullback
Brad Muster led the squad with 159 yards and two
touchowns on 20 carries, and that was in just the
first half. One of Muster's scores came on a 67-yard
run, the longest touchdown of his Stanford career.
The senior sat out the second half after slightly
re-spraining his injured left ankle in the second
quarter. "Some guy fell on it, and it really stiffened
at the half," said Muster, who is not expected to
miss any playing time against California."l didn't
feel that bad. but there were guys who could fill in,
and I didn't feel pressured to play."
There was no need to take any chances with
Muster. The weather was cold, the turf was slick

and the Cardinal offense had demonstrated that it
had no problem scoring against the Oregon State
defense and led 28-7 at the half.
Quarterback Brian Johnson was in top form,
finishing on 13 of 21 passes for 193 yards and three
scores. The sophomore, who had thrown nine in
terceptions in the previous three games, had only
one pass picked off, and that came on an outstand
ing defensive play by Rich Haggerty off a tipped
pass in the third quarter.
"I though Brian Johnson showed good poise all
day," Elway said. " He obviously got one of the big
plays of the game on the streak to (Ed) McCaffrey
for the touchdown."
That touchdown, a 49-yard scoring pass early in
the fourth quarter, put the Cardinal up 38-7 and
ended the scoring for the day, as Johnson lofted the
ball perfectly into the hands of wide receiver
McCaffrey, who was sprinting down the right
sideline.
"We set that one up pretty well," Johnson said.
"There were a lot of short curl routes, and I had to
pump fake because you want the cornerback to
bite. If he bites, you have it. It's kind of an all-or
nothing deal."
Things were going so badly for the Beavers by
then that the Oregon State band broke into a
spirited rendition of "All Right Now" and the
Oregon State cheerleaders cheered follwing the
score, Stanford's fifth touchdown of the game.
Although the Stanford offense was done scoring,
the Stanford defense was still busy collecting Wil
hem's passes. Safety Brad Humphreys had hauled
in two interceptions in the first half, Brad Cook got
a theft on a flea-flicker in the third quarter and an
acrobatic Rob Englehardt pick set up that final Car
dinal touohdown, but there was more to come.
In the folirth quarter. Cook ended a Beaver drive
with a nifty over-the-shoulder interception at the
Stanford 19-yard line. There were no visible
Oregon State receivers near the ball, and the ever
dwindling crowd loudly booed Wilhelm.
On the very first play of the Beaver s next pos
session, the frustrated quarterback hit Stanford
linebacker Jono Tunney over the middle. The fol

team defense into the swing of
things, as backup linebacker
Kevin Mescher snagged a tipped
Wilhem pass with 3:58 to go.
"A lot of his passes weren't
real sharp, especially the deep
balls," said Cook, who also had a
fumble recovery to his credit.
"He just lofted it up to his
receivers and let them run to it."
There was some speculation
that Wilhelm was still bothered
by an ankle injury suffered two
weeks ago, but Kragthorpe put
that rumor to rest. "Erik Wil
helm was definitely off," he said.
"There's no reason for that that I
know of, because he's sound
physically."
The Stanford offense was cer
tainly sound the first half, taking
the opening kickoff and diving 80
yards for the score, which came
on an 18-yard pass from Johnson
to a wide open Jim Price, who
caught the ball over his shoulder
in the end zone.
The next Stanford score was
set up by a patented Alan Grant
punt return. The junior broke
tackles and dodged defenders for
63 yards before he was knocked
out of bounds on the Oregon
State 9-yard line. Muster plowed

the ball into the end zone on the
next play.
The Cardinal opened the
second quarter with a third down
and one yard to go on the Stan
ford 28-yard line. Mustfcr got the
call, and the fullback picked up
for the one yard needed for the
first down. In fact, he broke a
tackle, stayed on his feet, cut to
the right sideline and rambled 67-
yards for the longest touchdown
of his career.
"Marshall (Dillard) got a good
block on the inside guy," Muster
said, "and there was only one
guy left. He came up and didn't
wrap and that was it."
Oregon State finally got on the
board in the second quarter when
Wilhelm went deep to Roland
Hawkins on a 57-yard touch
down pass, but that would be the
extent of the Beaver scoring. It
was the 17th touchdown of the
year for Wilhelm, setting a new
school record for touchdown
passes in one season.
The Cardinal came right back
with another 80-yard scoring
drive, and once again the touch
down came on a pass from
Johnson to Price, this one going
16 yards as Price lunged in for
six. "That was a bootleg pass,"
Price said. "The offense faked
like we were running left, Brian
went right, and I was all alone in
that position. 1 stumbled at first,
but dove in at the last second."
