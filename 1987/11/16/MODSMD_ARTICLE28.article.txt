# Field hockey falls in NCAAs

And the jinx continues.
The Stanford field hockey team,
more confident than ever before
heading into postseason action, lost for
the third successive year in the first
round of the NCAAs, for the third suc
cessive year in the Midwest regional
and for aonnccdtive'year to
Northwestern.
The Cardinal, which has been
plagued all year by its failure to score
goals, was again unable to come up
with any offensive punch, and fell to
Northwestern Saturday 2-0. The
Wildcats lost their opportunity to ad
vance to the Final Four, however,
when they fell 1-0 to lowa Sunday.
"We really had a good feeling about
the game this weekend," Stanford
Coach Sheryl Johnson said. "The girls
were really psyched to play, but it was
Northwestern's day to win."
The Wildcats, looking to avenge a I
-0 loss to Stanford Sept. 11. came out on
fire. But the dependable Cardinal

defense was able to hold Northwestern
at bay until midway through the First
half.
The Wildcats scored off an ex
tremely well-executed corner that just
eluded junior goalie Karen Jones, set
ting the tone for the remainder of the
first half. The payoff came with a mere
27 seconds left in the opening period,
when Northwestern was able to take
advantage of a hectic scramble in front
of the goal and tip a crossing pass into
the cage.
Despite an outstanding second half
by the Cardinal, Stanford was unable
to ever threaten the Wildcats' two-goal
edge. " They played really, really well
in the second half," Johnson said. "We
made some adjustments at halftime
that really paid off."
Junior Missy Jolley agreed. "1
thought we played an excellent second
half," she said, "but we just didn't
generate a lot of attack."
That seems to have been the team's
Achilles heel all season long — the ina
bility to score goals. The Cardinal
averaged only 1.23 goals per game this

year and was shut out seven times. The
problem was most acute during the
squad's late-season slide, when it failed
to score in four out of its last six games.
"We were always looking for the
real excellent chance instead of taking
a lot of shots," Johnson said. "It's
tough to get those kind of chances
against the caliber of teams we were
competing against."
The problem came to a head against
the Wildcats. The statistics tell the
whole story: one corner and six shots
on goal. "We didn't have a lot of team
plays," junior Lena Slachmuijlder
said. "We simply didn't get as many
offensive plays as we usually do."
Northwestern, on the other hand,
had a number of corner opportunities
to go with its 22 shots. The Wildcats'
furious attack forced the Stanford
defense to play very well if the team
was even to stay in the game. And it
did, and they did.
"We did a pretty good job of shutting
them down, especially in the second

team that lost in the first round of NCAA competition Saturday — for the third straight
season.
half," Jolley said. "We played
well. We didn't get embar
rassed."
Junior goalie Karen Jones was
very instrumental in that effort.
She recorded 15 saves on the
match, and almost got to the two
shots that passed her by. Jones
finished the year with a startling
0.70 goals against average.
"Karen Jones played a truly out
standing game," Johnson said.
The Cardinal's loss, though a
disappointing one, should not
take away from the outstanding
season the team has had. Stan
ford won the competitive North
ern Pacific Conference with a 6-
1-1 league record, gaining four
spots on the all-conference squad
in the process. Senior Ami Chit
wood joined juniors Allison
Smith, Kat Thomas and Jones in
receiving all-conference honors.
Sheryl Johnson was named Nor-
Pac Coach of the Year.
Ami Chitwood had an espe
cially good season, finishing
second in the voting for NorPac
Conference Player of the Year.
"Ami had a great season,"
Johnson said. "I'm glad she
finished her career with such a
good performance, despite our
loss."

The team will certainly miss
Chitwood's presence next year.
"Losing Ami is like losing two
players," Jolley said, "but she's
the only member of the team that
isn't returning."
Indeed, the Cardinal returns
almost its entire team for next
year, with the addition of some
quality freshman players. "The
kids are already talking about it
(next year)," Johnson said.
"All of the freshman improved
incredibly this year,"
Slachmuijlder said. "That's a
really good sign. Basically we're
going to be a good team next
year."
The Cardinal will have tq play
for part of the year without the
guidance of Johnson, who will be
playing with the U.S. National
Team in Seoul and participating
in the 1988 Olympic Games.
"Our coach isn't going to be
here, and we'll miss her,"
Slachmuijlder said.
But the Stanford coach should
be pleasantly surprised upon her
return. The Cardinal, if anything,
will be an improved team next
year. In addition to the many re
turning players, Stanford will
also see Laura Gartland, who
will be a senior, back on the
playing field. Gartland went
down with an early injury this
year]
