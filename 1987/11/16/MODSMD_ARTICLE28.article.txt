# Field hockey falls in NCAAs

And the jinx continues.
The Stanford field hockey team,
more confident than ever before
heading into postseason action, lost for
the third successive year in the first
round of the NCAAs, for the third suc
cessive year in the Midwest regional
and for aonnccdtive'year to
Northwestern.
The Cardinal, which has been
plagued all year by its failure to score
goals, was again unable to come up
with any offensive punch, and fell to
Northwestern Saturday 2-0. The
Wildcats lost their opportunity to ad
vance to the Final Four, however,
when they fell 1-0 to lowa Sunday.
"We really had a good feeling about
the game this weekend," Stanford
Coach Sheryl Johnson said. "The girls
were really psyched to play, but it was
Northwestern's day to win."
The Wildcats, looking to avenge a I
-0 loss to Stanford Sept. 11. came out on
fire. But the dependable Cardinal

defense was able to hold Northwestern
at bay until midway through the First
half.
The Wildcats scored off an ex
tremely well-executed corner that just
eluded junior goalie Karen Jones, set
ting the tone for the remainder of the
first half. The payoff came with a mere
27 seconds left in the opening period,
when Northwestern was able to take
advantage of a hectic scramble in front
of the goal and tip a crossing pass into
the cage.
Despite an outstanding second half
by the Cardinal, Stanford was unable
to ever threaten the Wildcats' two-goal
edge. " They played really, really well
in the second half," Johnson said. "We
made some adjustments at halftime
that really paid off."
Junior Missy Jolley agreed. "1
thought we played an excellent second
half," she said, "but we just didn't
generate a lot of attack."
That seems to have been the team's
Achilles heel all season long — the ina
bility to score goals. The Cardinal
averaged only 1.23 goals per game this

year and was shut out seven times. The
problem was most acute during the
squad's late-season slide, when it failed
to score in four out of its last six games.
"We were always looking for the
real excellent chance instead of taking
a lot of shots," Johnson said. "It's
tough to get those kind of chances
against the caliber of teams we were
competing against."
The problem came to a head against
the Wildcats. The statistics tell the
whole story: one corner and six shots
on goal. "We didn't have a lot of team
plays," junior Lena Slachmuijlder
said. "We simply didn't get as many
offensive plays as we usually do."
Northwestern, on the other hand,
had a number of corner opportunities
to go with its 22 shots. The Wildcats'
furious attack forced the Stanford
defense to play very well if the team
was even to stay in the game. And it
did, and they did.
"We did a pretty good job of shutting
them down, especially in the second
