# Card thumps Swedes in opener, 116-63
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Prepare yourself for this score: Stan
ford I 16, Malbas 63. That's right, the
Swedish Malbas club traveled over 6(K)0
miles to lose a basketball game 116-63.
But it was fun.
The Cardinal unleashed a furious offen
sive attack last night in Maples Pavilion,
outscoring the Malbans 56-34 in the first
half and 60-29 in the second half.
Six Stanford players scored in double
figures, as the Malbans were obviously
outmatched in the exhibition contest. In
the last week, the Swedes have lost to St.
Mary's, San Francisco and San Jose
State.
Although the game was terribly
lopsided, the 1455 fans were kept enter
tained by the Stanford offense.
"It was certainly fun," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "Fverybody got
to play, and it was important to have
some fun and get away from all the
pounding they take in practices."
Malban David Duane led all scorers
with 26 points. Stanford forward Todd
Lichti had 21 points, and Cardinal center
Greg Butler finished with 20. On the night
Stanford shot 60 percent from the field.
"We obviously shot the ball very
well," Montgomery said. "I thought the
guys did what they could do. Even
though the competition wasn't tough, we
concentrated well."
Malban player Tony Robinson said
Stanford was the best team the Swedes
have played against in the Bay Area.
"This was the best team we played so
far by far," Robinson said. "They were
well organized, controlled, disciplined."
Robinson, who played for Seattle-
Pacific in college, was impressed with the
trio of Lichti, Butler and junior forward
Howard Wright.
"Those are the big three. As they go,

so goes Stanford," Robinson said.
Swede Coach Per Kallman was equally
impressed with the Cardinal perform
ance.
"St. Mary's killed us with defense, but
they were nothing like Stanford on of
fense," Kallman said. "They have a good
bench.
" The best talent we saw was (San Jose
State's) Kick Berry, but he didn't per
form well against us," Kallman said.
"Number 42 on your team (Lichti) played
the best against lis."
Lichti was nearly perfect, sinking 5-
for-5 from the free-throw line and 8-for-9
from the field, including a breakaway
flying tomahawk thunderdunk.
"1 missed a layup, which 1 don't like
doing, but overall I'm satisfied, espe
cially with the team," Lichti said. "We
had more talent, but we were still patient
and took good shots."
Indeed, Stanford had certain stretches
in which they just couldn't miss. To open
the second half, the Cardinal strung to
gether five layups and three baseline
jumpers before missing a shot.
The Cardinal offensive outburst in
cluded several weapons not present last
season on the Farm.
First, senior Butler has developed a
hook shot from the paint.
"Fric (Reveno) had a lot of success
with it last year, so I knew it would be a
good shot," Butler said. "I have long
arms, so it's going to be hard to block.
Fric had shorter arms than me, and it
worked. The defender has to go across
my body to block it."
Enigmatic junior Brian McSweeney
also looked good in the first half last
night. McSweeney has shown flashes
over the past two years, and last night he
looked calmer and more confident in his
shot selection. He shot 5-for-9 from the

field and added a free-throw to
finish with 11 points.
Finally, there was the presence
of energetic redshirt freshman
Deshon Wingate, who roamed
the court with abandon and with
out his shirt tucked in. Wingate
was charged with a technical foul
five minutes into the game for
hanging on the rim after missing a

dunk off a rebound.
"If you miss that shot they (the
referees) will call it, and if you
make it they won't call it because
they say you're following
through," Montgomery said.
"Deshon was a little excited."
With a few seconds left in the
game Wingate demonstrated that
he could make that shot. The 6-
foot-7 frosh slammed a rebound
just before the buzzer sounded to
end the evening in a rather fitting
fashion.
The Cardinal will open its

season at the Hawaiian Air
lines/Maui Classic the day after
Thanksgiving against the lowa
Hawkeyes. Stanford's home
opener is Tuesday, Dec. 1
against the Santa Clara Broncos.

scheduled for Dec. 4 and 5 at

with 26 points. Stanford forward Todd
Lichti had 21 points, and Cardinal center
Greg Butler finished with 20. On the night
Stanford shot 60 percent from the field.
"We obviously shot the ball very
well," Montgomery said. "I thought the
guys did what they could do. Even
though the competition wasn't tough, we
concentrated well."
Malban player Tony Robinson said
Stanford was the best team the Swedes
have played against in the Bay Area.
"This was the best team we played so
far by far," Robinson said. "They were
well organized, controlled, disciplined."
Robinson, who played for Seattle-
Pacific in college, was impressed with the
trio of Lichti, Butler and junior forward
Howard Wright.
"Those are the big three. As they go,

so goes Stanford," Robinson said.
Swede Coach Per Kallman was equally
impressed with the Cardinal perform
ance.
"St. Mary's killed us with defense, but
they were nothing like Stanford on of
fense," Kallman said. "They have a good
bench.
" The best talent we saw was (San Jose
State's) Kick Berry, but he didn't per
form well against us," Kallman said.
"Number 42 on your team (Lichti) played
the best against lis."
Lichti was nearly perfect, sinking 5-
for-5 from the free-throw line and 8-for-9
from the field, including a breakaway
flying tomahawk thunderdunk.
"1 missed a layup, which 1 don't like
doing, but overall I'm satisfied, espe
cially with the team," Lichti said. "We
had more talent, but we were still patient
and took good shots."
Indeed, Stanford had certain stretches
in which they just couldn't miss. To open
the second half, the Cardinal strung to
gether five layups and three baseline
jumpers before missing a shot.
The Cardinal offensive outburst in
cluded several weapons not present last
season on the Farm.
First, senior Butler has developed a
hook shot from the paint.
"Fric (Reveno) had a lot of success
with it last year, so I knew it would be a
good shot," Butler said. "I have long
arms, so it's going to be hard to block.
Fric had shorter arms than me, and it
worked. The defender has to go across
my body to block it."
Enigmatic junior Brian McSweeney
also looked good in the first half last
night. McSweeney has shown flashes
over the past two years, and last night he
looked calmer and more confident in his
shot selection. He shot 5-for-9 from the

field and added a free-throw to
finish with 11 points.
Finally, there was the presence
of energetic redshirt freshman
Deshon Wingate, who roamed
the court with abandon and with
out his shirt tucked in. Wingate
was charged with a technical foul
five minutes into the game for
hanging on the rim after missing a

dunk off a rebound.
"If you miss that shot they (the
referees) will call it, and if you
make it they won't call it because
they say you're following
through," Montgomery said.
"Deshon was a little excited."
With a few seconds left in the
game Wingate demonstrated that
he could make that shot. The 6-
foot-7 frosh slammed a rebound
just before the buzzer sounded to
end the evening in a rather fitting
fashion.

Swedish Malbas club traveled over 6(K)0
miles to lose a basketball game 116-63.
But it was fun.
The Cardinal unleashed a furious offen
sive attack last night in Maples Pavilion,
outscoring the Malbans 56-34 in the first
half and 60-29 in the second half.
Six Stanford players scored in double
figures, as the Malbans were obviously
outmatched in the exhibition contest. In
the last week, the Swedes have lost to St.
Mary's, San Francisco and San Jose
State.
Although the game was terribly
lopsided, the 1455 fans were kept enter
tained by the Stanford offense.
"It was certainly fun," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "Fverybody got
to play, and it was important to have
some fun and get away from all the
pounding they take in practices."

with 26 points. Stanford forward Todd
