# Reagan Library to be near L.A.

### Jason Bloomstein 
The Ronald Reagan Library Foundation announced Friday that the
Reagan Library and Center for Public Affairs — once scheduled to be
located at Stanford — will be built on 1()0 acres of donated private
property about 40 minutes from Los Angeles and 80 miles southeast
of the Reagans' private ranch in Santa Barbara.

The site for the $30-million,
donated by Blakely Swartz, a
Los Angeles development firm.
Over 30 sites were considered
for the library after the founda
tion last April reversed its deci
sion to build the library at Stan
ford. Controversy over the loca
tion and size of the library, as
well as over the the University's
refusal to allow a public policy
center on campus, caused the
search for an alternate site.
The decision not to affiliate the
library with a major university
came as a suprise, since several
California universities — includ
ing the Claremont colleges, Pep
perdine University, USC,
UCLA, UC-Santa Barbara and
Occidental College — had been
candidates for the library site.
Officials from those univer
sities were unavailable for com
ment yesterday.
Stanford English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz, a longtime critic of
building the library here, said
universities would normally "try
like mad to get the prestige of
having a presidential library,"
but added that "I suspect (the
foundation 1 couldn't find a uni

115,000-square-foot library was
versitv to take the library, per
haps tor the same reasons Stan
ford didn't want it."
Hoover Insitution Director W.
Olenn Campbell and Hoover fel
low Martin Anderson, who serve
on the foundation, also could not
be reached for comment yester
day.
The final agreement for the
land acquisition will be signed
Nov. 23 in Los Angeles. The
foundation expects construction
of the library to begin in late sum
mer of next year and to last 20 to
22 months.
The foundation is "very
pleased" with the site, which is
in the Thousand Oaks-Simi Val
ley area in Southern California,
executive director Gary Jones
told the San Jose Mercury News.
"We think it offers citizens of
that community an educational
center as well as a great opportu
nity to house the presldental
papers."' Jones said.
