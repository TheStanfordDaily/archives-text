# Swedes recruit American help
## 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
Basketball is a growing sport in Sweden. For
now, however, its practitioners aren't above ac
cepting a little American aid.
And, as you might imagine, this basketball-rich
land of ours has plenty of people willing to provide
it. The trick, if you live in Sweden, is finding them.
After playing host to a Pacific Conference all-star
team in Sweden last year, Malbas Coach Per Kal
lman decided to take his squad on an historic tour
of the States — the first ever by a Swedish club
team.
But, as with most good things, there was a prob
lem. Compared to the teams it was scheduled to
play, Malbas, a second-division club in Sweden,
didn't look too competitive.
"We knew we weren't good enough to play with
our regular team. We knew that we would need
some help," Kallman said.
So the coach picked up the phone, dialed Seattle
and asked for Basketball Travelers, a company that
sets up tours and, if necessary, supplies players.
"No problem," the Travellers said, "you need
players, we got em." Enter Richie McKay, the 5-9
point guard of last year's Seattle-Pacific Falcons.
McKay had just left Seattle-Pacific and was
looking for something to do."The guy setting up
the tour asked me if I wanted to play, and it
sounded like fun to me," McKay said.
McKay called up Northern Arizona's David
Duane, a player he knew from high school, and the
two left for Sweden, where they spent two quick
weeks practicing with Malbas.
"Sweden was a little cold for a guy from
Tempe," Duane said, "but they treated us real well
— like kings." McKay quickly became the team's
floor leader, Duane its top forward. Last night the
pair logged a total of 65 minutes for Malbas.
To strengthen a small front line, two other
Americans, Seattle-Pacific's Tony Robinson and
Central Washington's Rodney Taylor (two more
friends of McKay) were recruited after the team
reached the States. Taylor, in fact, met his coach
and teammates during halftime of Malbas' first
game.
"1 got off the plane, got in a
car, drove to the gym, suited up
and played in the second half. 1
was a little tight, but it worked
out," Taylor said.
The biggest problem, accord
ing to Kallman, "was working
them (the new players) into the
team." _
So far, the transition seems to

be going just fine. Last night,
McKay, Taylor, Robinson and
Duane together scored 53 of
Malbas' 63 points. Duane's 26
made him the game's high scorer,
ahead of Todd Lichti by five.
Because of Swedish league
rules which outlaw American
players in Malbas' league, the
four Americans' job will last only
until next weekend when the
team returns to Sweden and
resumes league play. For the mo
ment, however, the players are
enjoying their starring roles. In

return for their services, the
Americans recieve no salary, but
do have all expenses paid.
"It's pretty easy playing with
these guys. They're all patient,
and on the court we all speak
English,'' Taylor said.
"Everybody's unselfish, and
there isn't any animosity,"
Duane said.
According to McKay, Kal-
Iman's coaching also seems to be
acceptable. "For a Swedish
coach, he knows a lot," the point
guard said.
