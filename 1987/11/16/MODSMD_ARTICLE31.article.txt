# Men's, women's cross country finish eighth
## Harriers fail to qualify for NCAAs 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Both the Stanford men's and
women's cross country teams con
cluded their fall seasons with a disap
pointing eighth-place finish Saturday at
the NCAA District-8 Regionals in
Fresno. Because of the low finish, both
Cardinal squads failed to qualify for the
NCAA Championships.
While neither team was able to meet
its goal of qualifying for the NCAAs,
however, each squad improved from
last week's disappointing Pacific 10
Championship performance.
Matt Guisto was the men's regional
w inner, leading Arizona to victory with
a 29:42.7 blowout, nearly 26 seconds
ahead of the second-place finisher and
the fastest course time in four years.
Annette Hand led a trio of Ducks on
the women's side in 16:19.0, as Oregon
crushed the competition with a mere 29
points.
Senior Steve Schadler was the
surprise Cardinal leader on the eighth-

Although the total team
time fell nearly two
minutes from its last race,
the Cardinal slid back three
places from its fifth-place
spot at the Pac-lOs.

place Stanford men's team. Running
with the lead pack for the first four
miles, he went out in front with a 4:36
over the first mile and held on to take
15th overall in 30:53.2.
Schadler improved on his 37th-place
finish last year and broke the 31-minute
mark for the first time in his Stanford
career. He has improved in every race
this year. In the process, Schadler has
sliced over two-and-a-half minutes
from his previous 10-kilometer best
earlier this season.
Sophomores Eric and Mark Mastalir
were next in 21st and 29th overall. Eric

also broke the 31-minute harrier for the
first time at 30:58, while Mark came in
at 31:07. Both eliminated more than a
minute from their disappointing times
at the Pac-10 Championships.
The Cardinal women finished in a
pack at 17:45 with Melanie Bloch end
ing the meet first for Stanford, followed
by Carol Gray, Wendy Neely and Kim
Stevens. All four were within 10
seconds of each other, and the team
finished eighth with 179 points.
Although the total team time fell
nearly two minutes from its last race,
the Cardinal slid back three places
from its fifth-place spot at the Pac-10
Championships. To qualify for the
NCAA Championships the women
would have had to finish second, and
the men in the top three.
Last year the women were second at
the District-8 Championships and
placed 15th at the NCAA Champion
ships. With her low finish, Gray, a 1986
cross-country All-American, also
missed a chance to go to the NCAAs
for individual competition.
