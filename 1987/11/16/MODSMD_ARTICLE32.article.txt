# Spikers sweep Arizona, ASU

### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's volleyball team
sizzled in the state of Arizona this weekend,
sweeping both Arizona and Arizona State.
The Cardinal beat the Wildcats 15-4, 15-6, 16-
14 Friday in Tucson, then came back the next
night to triumph 15-13, 15-12, 15-7 against the
Sun Devils.
Stanford is now 23-4 overall this season,
and 15-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference. The
Cardinal has guaranteed itself at least a tie
with UCLA for the league title, and one more
Stanford conference victory would sign, seal
and deliver the school's first Pac-10 Champi
onship in volleyball.
The wins also add to a few Stanford
streaks. The Cardinal now holds the record
for consecutive Pac-10 wins with 15 in a row.
Stanford's only loss was to UCLA in mid-
September. The Cardinal has also won eight
consecutive road matches, and the team has
triumphed in 18 of its last 19 matches.
"We did a good job," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "We had a good weekend in that
we were ready to play.'
The trip opened with a match against a
Wildcat team that is struggling to earn an
NCAA playoff berth. Arizona came into the
match knowing it had to have a good
showing, as it has only a 16-11 record this
season, 7-9 in the Pac-10. The Wildcats were
not up for the challenge, however, and it
quickly became a blowout.
"Arizona was just fiat," Shaw said.
The first two games took little more than a
half hour as the Cardinal took control, putting
balls down early and often. For the first two
games, Stanford as a team had a .342 hitting
percentage, while the Wildcats hit only .033.
Things became more exciting in game
three, however, as Stanford let down a little,
and Arizona raised the level of its play. After
a brief struggle the Cardinal came though
again, with a 16-14 score.
The Stanford attack was led by senior
outside hitter Teresa Smith, who had 15 kills
and a .565 hitting percentage. Junior Amy

Hayes had nine kills, and senior Nancy Reno
had eight and junior Laura Olesen had seven
and a .500 percentage.
Things were a little different for Arizona.
Senior Kiyomi Morino, the team's top
player, was held to only three kills and a -. 167
percentage. As a whole, the Wildcats' three
starting outside hitters hit for 102.
A strong effort on defense was the key to
shutting down the Arizona attack. Senior set
ter Wendi Rush had a match-high 14 digs to
lead the Cardinal but received a lot of help.
Hayes added eight digs, sophomore Lara
Asper had seven and Smith had six. The
Wildcat defense was not nearly as.successful,
as middle blocker Leigh Halliwell led their ef
fort with only six saves.
The Cardinal also outblocked its foe, led by
Reno's six blocks, Olesen's five and Asper's
four.
Olesen explained that the team'* unity was
the determining factor on both nights. "It's
really cool how we came together so well,"
she said. "As a team we played great."
The following night's contest proved to be
more eventful, if not more exciting. "Arizona
State came out really pumped in the first
game," Shaw said. The Sun Devils' 14-11
mark (8-8 in the Pac-10) also places them near
the cutoff point for selection to the NCAA
tournament.
In the first game ASU started fast, building
to a lead that became 12-8. The Cardinal then
came through, as it has all season, and
mounted a comeback to win the game 15-13.
"We scratched away one point at a time,"
Shaw said. "We managed to pull that game
out."
The second game was more of the same. It
seesawed back and forth until the score read
12-11 Arizona. Olesen had not been feeling
well all night, and finally it caught up with
her. She was forced to leave the court during
a rally, a point which Stanford still won on a
kill by Smith.
Shaw has only three middle blockers on his
roster, and with Olesen having to leave, and
since sophomore Jenny Chaffee had already

been used as a substitute, there was no one to
replace Olesen.
Shaw's only possible move was to put
freshman Tracy Hughes in and hope for the
best. Hughes, who is 5-foot-9, was playing
against the likes of 6-1 Dawn Meidinger, 6-1
Sue Nord and 6-3 Tina Berg. Despite this
"small" difficulty, Stanford was able to get a
sideout to rotate Chaffee into the front row.
The Cardinal then kept the pressure on and
managed to salvage the game. "Everybody
just pulled together and pushed that much
harder," Shaw said.
Smith agreed, saying the team's "kinetic
energy carried us through the match."
After this, the third game was an an
ticlimax. Stanford just ran away with the
game, winning 15-7. "We just smoked
them," Shaw said. "We got on top of them
early."
The stars on this evening were plentiful.
Smith had 18 kills and Reno 13. Chaffee
added seven more in her relief appearance;
Olesen also had seven before leaving the
match. Defensively, Hayes and Smith had 11
digs each, and Chaffee, Asper and Reno all
had three blocks.
"We had fun, and it did us right (winning
the pair)," Hayes said.
Stanford has only four more matches
remaining before NCAA playoffs begin the
first weekend in December. The Cardinal will
close out its Pac-10 schedule this weekend
when second-place UCLA comes to town
Thursday night and third-place USC visits
Friday night. The Bruins are currently ranked
fifth in the nation, and the Trojans fill the No.
13 slot.
Olesen said she is looking forward to ex
tracting a little revenge from the Bruins. "I'm
really excited to have them here," she said.
"Hopefully we'll be able to keep improving
for our final push (the NCAAs)."
After those matches, the squad travels to
the islands to face Hawaii twice over the
Thanksgiving break. The Rainbow Wahines
have been the top-ranked team in the country
for more than a month and have lost only
once all year.
