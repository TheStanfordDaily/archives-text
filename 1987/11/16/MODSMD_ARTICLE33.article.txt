# Water polo defeats alumni team
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
In a tight, if completely unoffi
cial, match Saturday afternoon,
the Stanford water polo team
defeated a Cardinal alumni team
in overtime, 10-9.
The victory avenges the
outcome of last year's alumni
game, when the Cardinal lost its
only game of the season, 11-9.
Because the U.S. National Team
played in Southern California last
weekend, this year's alumni

squad did not include the more
noteworthy current Olympic
team members that last year's
alumni team did.
This year's alumni contingent
did include its share of former
collegiate standouts, however,
including three players from last
year's NCAA championship
team. In addition, 1980 and 1984
Olympian Chris Dorst and three
players from the Olympic Club
Team demonstrated their consid
erable skill, giving the present
day Cardinal some lessons in

international-level water polo.
The more important collegiate
water polo action was taking
place down south, however,
where No. 2 UCLA lost to No. 5
USC. The Bruins' loss should
lead to yet another shift in the na
tional rankings for the top five
teams. The latest coaches poll
had California at No. 1. Stanford
and UC-Irvine were tied for third
behind UCLA.
Stanford (19-6) has fewer
losses than all its top-five rivals
except for Cal, which is solidly

on top at 23-3. With only one
game remaining — the Big Splash
against the Bears at deGuerre
Pool the morning of Big Game —
Stanford is assured of an NCAA
tournament bid.
With only eight teams qualify
ing for the NCAAs (five from
California, one from the East
Coast and two from the Mid
west), the Cardinal is gunning for
a seeding in the top three. A
ranking at No. 2 or 3 would mean
a less difficult draw in the tourna
ment.
