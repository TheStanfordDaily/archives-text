## 
### Mike Shay 
The Stanford fencing teams
took on archrival UC-Santa
Cruz Saturday and walked
away slightly scathed with a
win and a loss.
The men's team won 14-13
overall, losing only in foil
competition. The women's
team suffered a disappointing
loss in the foil, ultimately
losing to the Banana Slugs.
The women's team fought
hard, but in the end the score
was tied 8-8. The winner had
to be determinded by in
dicators (how many touches
each team had scored on the
opposing team). Santa Cruz
won by four touches, 59-55.
"It was close, closer than 1
wanted," Stanford women's
Coach Sherry Posthumus said.
"They (Stanford fencers)
fenced well against a returning
team of three, and one new
fencer. They tied and went to
indicators and were down by
four touches for the match."
The Cardinal's Alexandra
Rankin led her team with a 3-1
record on the day, losing only
to Santa Cruz's Laurel Wil
son. who was 4-0 for the
match.
The men's team also went
back and forth with Santa
Cruz.
"Santa Cruz is our biggest
opponent; it was a little
scary," Stanford men's Coach
Zoran Tulum said.
Stanford lost to Santa Cruz
two out of three times last
year. The Cardinal's only vic
tory over the Banana Slugs
was in the NCAA finals by one
touch last March.
The Santa Cruz match was
Tulum's first meet as coach at

Stanford and the first meet for
the new team this year. The
Santa Cruz fencers had al
ready fenced one meet as a
team this season.
"The meet was friendly, but
hot, very hot," Tulum said.
At the start of the match,
the men's team began with
epee competition and soundly
beat the Banana Slugs.
"It was a surprise," said
Tulum of the epee team's 6-3
win.
The seven-member epee
team has only one returnee,
senior Stephen Schmidt.
Schmidt fenced with two new
epee fencers, sophomore
Peter Duimstra and freshman
Joseph Elizondo. Elizondo is a
recruit from San Antonio,
Texas.
The 6-3 win in the epee
helped counter Stanford's loss
in foil.
The men's foil team lost 6-3.
Most bouts were close, with
the competition often going to
four touches each until the
final point.
The most intriguing division
Saturday, however, was the
sabre competition. The men's
sabre was the final event of the
day and the deciding factor for
the Cardinal men. After the
foil division, the teams were
tied at nine bouts each. But
the Cardinal sabre team came
from behind to soundly beat
Santa Cruz 5-4.
Captain Dave Russ, a
junior, is the sabre team's only
returnee.
The final four bouts went to
Stanford, bringing the Cardi
nal up from behind and win
ning by one bout. The final
competition was won by soph
omore Doug Flinn.
