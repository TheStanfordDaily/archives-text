Declaring that Stanford stu
dents "have an obligation to
work on more than just
graduating or making money
for car payments," former
New Mexico Cbvernor Toney
Anaya encouraged students to
become more politically active.
In an interview Friday,
Anaya said this country needs
"moral guidance" from the
universities and"the intellec
tual ideas of students."
"What is wrong with society
is that college campuses pretty
much went to sleep after the
Vietnam War," Anaya said. "It
was activism that helped bring
about the civil rights movement

and the end to the Vietnam
War."
Anaya encouraged Chicano
students to address not just is
sues of historic importance to
their community, such as bilin
gual education and immigra
tion, but also "broader is
sues," such as U.S. foreign
policy in Central America and
South Africa, the federal
budget, the international trade
deficit, the death penalty and
human rights.
During his term as governor,
from 1983 to 1986, Anaya made
several controversial decisions
that drew national press and
government interest and
Erompted efforts to impeach
im.
As governor, Anaya chose to

grant clemency to the five
death row prisoners then im
prisoned in New Mexico, even
though 84 percent of the state's
voters supported the death
penalty, he said.
"I look at it in the positive
sense," Anaya said. "It was a
rare opportunity that an indi
vidual had the chance to save
lives." The five are now ser
ving life prison sentences.
In what he called a "moral"
decision, Anaya declared New
Mexico a sanctuary state for
Central American refugees. "It
should have been a national de
cision, but it wasn't," Anaya
said. "Somebody had to
respond, so I took action."
