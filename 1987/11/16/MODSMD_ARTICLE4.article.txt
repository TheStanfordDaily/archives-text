# Protests led to library's relocation

### Todd Pierce Editorial Staff 
The decision to build the
Ronald Reagan Library and Cen
ter for Public Affairs at a site in
Southern California marks the
end of the library's seven-month
search for a home after plans to
build it at Stanford were
scrapped last April.
The 100-acre plot near Los An
geles enables the Reagan Presi
dential Foundation to establish a
joint library and think tank with
out the constraints a university
might impose. Although Stanford
and the foundation agreed in 1984
to construct the library in the
Foothills overlooking the Uni
versity, the plans encountered
mounting opposition from faculty
members concerned about the li
brary's environmental effects
and potential partisan influence.
The foundation, then chaired
by Hoover Institution Director
W. Olenn Campbell, initially
wanted to have both the library
and public affairs center on the
Stanford campus, but the Faculty
Senate and tne Board of Trus
tees, fearing that the public af
fairs center might threaten aca
demic neutrality, only granted
permission for tne library and a
small museum.
In 1985, the trustees unani
mously approved a library site in
the Foothills, a move that an
gered local residents and in
creased faculty opposition.
In the 1986 Hoover annual
report Campbell wrote that the
establishment of the library and
the presence of Hoover would al

low the whole University to
"boast of a Reagan connection."
The Faculty Senate then voted
to criticize Campbell for com
promising the "non-partisan
rationale offered by the Board of
Trustees for siting the library on
this campus."
Concerns over the library's im
pact on the Foothills escalated
when the foundation released an
artist's rendering that made clear
that plans for the library included
a large auditorium and a second
floor that would be visible from
campus.
In early April 1987, 12 former
chairmen of the Faculty Senate
drafted a letter stating that the li
brary was too large for the site.
The Senate passed the letter as
a resolution despite a warning
from Warren Christopher, presi
dent of the Board of Trustees,
that the board would not recon
sider its commitment to the li
brary.
On April 23, the foundation an
nounced that it had dccided to
relocate the library to a site other
than Stanford.
