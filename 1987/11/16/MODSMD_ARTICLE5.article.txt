# Corporate tie creates controversy
## Plans set for new psychiatric hospital 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
In a move designed to expand its
clinical psychiatry facilities, fhe Uni
versity announced Friday the con
struction of an $ 11 -million psychia
tric hospital in a joint project of Stan
ford and the Georgia-based Charter
Medical Corp.
Charter will finance the construc
tion of the 80-bed facility, which will
be located across from the Stanford
Barn at the intersection of Quarry
Road and Welch Road. The Univer

sity and the Medical Center will lease
the hospital from Charter for 40
years. After that time is up the Uni
versity will assume full ownership of
the facility.
Some faculty members questioned
the agreement yesterday and said it
would probably be debated at the the
Dec. 3 Faculty Senate meeting. Con
cerns that Stanford's decision
making freedom might be con
strained by such a leasing agreement
with a private company were first
raised in the final senate meeting of
last year, but no action on the issue

was taken.
"This sets a precedent to he de
pendent on private agencies," Eng
lish Prof. Ronald Rebholz said, "The
medical department is in danger of
going to Charter for the power to de
termine what kinds of patients are
healed."
Rehholz said that Charter's profit
motive might discourage treatment of
patients who are unable to afford
medical care.
According to Spyros Andre
opoulos, director of communications
for the Medical School, however, the

agreement contains a provision for
indigent medical care.
"There are also provisions that
community psychiatrists can admit
their patients to the hospital," he
said.
Andreopoulos also dismissed fears
expressed by faculty members that
private interests might affect aca
demic interests. He explained that
Charter and Stanford will have equal
representation on a governing board
to oversee management of the facil
ity.
