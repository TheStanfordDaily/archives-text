## Speaker ties race to foreign policy 
### Alicia Kent Mike MacCrystall Staff writers 
Insisting that "race is an im
portant determinant of Ameri
can foreign policy," Randall
Robinson, executive director
of the Trans Africa lobby
group in Washington, D.C.,
told students here Saturday
that international awareness is
needed to break down "the
rigid wall of institutional rac
ism."
Robinson, delivering the
keynote address at this year's
"You Can Make a Differ
ence" conference, said he is
"not a civil rights leader (but)
a foreign policy leader." He
heads the 15,000-member
TransAfrica organization,
which lobbies nationwide for a
broad range of issues â€” in
cluding global economic san
tions against South Africa and
human rights in the Caribbean
and Africa.
"What we (in the United
States) have to learn as we
deal with (world) problems is a
respect for other races,
religions, cultures and ways of
life," Robinson said "We
have to know each other bet
ter to understand this savage
world."
According to Robinson, the
"disconcern" and "egocentric

outlook" of U.S. foreign
policy is the basis of U.S.
misperceptions. "We are a na
tion of trends," he said. "If
(an issue) is not on television,
it does not exist."
Citing apartheid in South
Africa as an example, Robin
son said that "many Amer
icans believe that the problem
of South Africa no longer
exists; it has become invisible.
Many black Americans have
been lulled into disconcern."
Likening the current situa
tion in South Africa to Nazi
Germany, Robinson said that
if "the roles were reversed in
South Africa we wouldn't
have any trouble getting sup
port; we wouldn't be debating
whether we should be divest
ing or not. The K2nd Airborne
(Division) would have been
there years ago."
"We don't understand the
urgency of (black South
Africans') situation in part be
cause they are black." he said.
"We are dangerously in im
balance in our relations with
the rest of the world. Our na
tion came out of World War II
with the absolutely solid con
ceit that we were the best on
earth, the only place anyone
sane would choose to live," he
said.
