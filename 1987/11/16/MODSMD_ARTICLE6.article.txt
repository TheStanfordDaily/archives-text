# 'You Can Make a Difference'' conference
## Speaker ties race to foreign policy 
### Alicia Kent Mike MacCrystall Staff writers 
Insisting that "race is an im
portant determinant of Ameri
can foreign policy," Randall
Robinson, executive director
of the Trans Africa lobby
group in Washington, D.C.,
told students here Saturday
that international awareness is
needed to break down "the
rigid wall of institutional rac
ism."
Robinson, delivering the
keynote address at this year's
"You Can Make a Differ
ence" conference, said he is
"not a civil rights leader (but)
a foreign policy leader." He
heads the 15,000-member
TransAfrica organization,
which lobbies nationwide for a
broad range of issues â€” in
cluding global economic san
tions against South Africa and
human rights in the Caribbean
and Africa.
"What we (in the United
States) have to learn as we
deal with (world) problems is a
respect for other races,
religions, cultures and ways of
life," Robinson said "We
have to know each other bet
ter to understand this savage
world."
According to Robinson, the
"disconcern" and "egocentric

outlook" of U.S. foreign
policy is the basis of U.S.
misperceptions. "We are a na
tion of trends," he said. "If
(an issue) is not on television,
it does not exist."
Citing apartheid in South
Africa as an example, Robin
son said that "many Amer
icans believe that the problem
of South Africa no longer
exists; it has become invisible.
Many black Americans have
been lulled into disconcern."
Likening the current situa
tion in South Africa to Nazi
Germany, Robinson said that
if "the roles were reversed in
South Africa we wouldn't
have any trouble getting sup
port; we wouldn't be debating
whether we should be divest
ing or not. The K2nd Airborne
(Division) would have been
there years ago."
"We don't understand the
urgency of (black South
Africans') situation in part be
cause they are black." he said.
"We are dangerously in im
balance in our relations with
the rest of the world. Our na
tion came out of World War II
with the absolutely solid con
ceit that we were the best on
earth, the only place anyone
sane would choose to live," he
said.

Randall Robinson, executive director of the Washington-based Trans-
Africa lobbv group, gave the keynote speech for the You Can Make a
Difference''conference here Saturday.
Robinson urged Stanford stu
dents to travel and work abroad
in order to combat the "ignor
ance that pervades every
newsroom, every university,
Congress, every institution.
"There is an awfully huge area
for improvemnt if we are going to
make it through the nuclear age
together," Robinson said. "I
hope to see an ample number of
blacks, Asians, Hispanics and
women in leadership positions,
so that those who make the
policy can make it in a sensitive
and representative way."
Robinson addressed an audi
ence of about 150 in Memorial
Auditorium.
The four-day conference was
made up of panel discussions and
workshops that addressed issues
ranging from minority access to
higher education to ethnic theme
houses to racism in the media.
Other afternoon workshops
centered on specific institutions

that have been accused of per
petuating racism by their policies
or attitudes. Topics included dis
cussions about alleged racism
within the University's Western
Culture requirement as well as
the lack of minorities employed
in permanent University staff
positions.
Arturo Pacheco, director of
the Equal Opportunity Program
at the University of California at
Santa Cruz and moderator of the
panel discussion, asserted that
institutional racism is per
petuated by a society of
"culturally disadvantaged" insti
tutions.
In a workshop discussing Stan
ford's ethnic theme houses,
panel members described these
residences as desirable places to
live.
Ujamaa Resident Fellow Mi
chael Britt defended the principle
of allowing minority students to
group themselves together
residentially. "Minority students
are not here to be someone else's
cultural experience," he said.
"They are here for the education
just like everybody else."
