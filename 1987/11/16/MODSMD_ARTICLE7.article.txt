# Coupons lead to Kinko's copy caper
## 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
A Stanford student ap
proached two Kinko's copy
shops Friday with 25(H) coupons
for 1(H) free copies each in hopes
of making what he calls "a busi
ness deal," but what Palo Alto
Kinko's manager Chuck Dicker
calls "extortion."
According to Dicker, junior
Robert Sterbal called the store
Friday morning and "like a
raving lunatic" asked for $S(XH)
in exchange for the coupons,
which were printed in an on
campus circular titled "Campus
Connection."
Dicker said Kinko's refused to
accept Sterbal's coupons be
cause the offer was supposed to
be a one-per-customer discount
of 25 free copies, but the maga
zine's printer made an error and
left the restrictions off the
coupons.
Until Friday, Kinko's shops
were accepting the coupons "to
give students a break," he said.
According to an employee,
Kinko's will no longer honor the
coupon.
Sterbal said he tried to make a
series of deals with Kinko's that
were "only business" and denies
any attempt at extortion.
Sterbal also said he ended the
phone conversation when Dicker
made a threat on his life.
"I was frightened by what that

man said,'" said Sterbal. "It was
humanly indecent."
Dicker said he made "no death
threat whatsoever" and that he
told Sierbal "only that (he)
would take action to stop him."
"Legally, I am completely in
the right," Sterbal said.
Sterbal said he wants Kinko's
to "keep their word" and accept
the coupons. "If Kinko's will not
take them from me. I'll give them
away to anyone who wants
them."
According to Sterbal, the deal
he wanted to negotiate with
Kinko's would enable him to
copy course materials free or at
reduced cost for resale to stu
dents.
Sterbal also said he intended to
share some of his profits by
giving each student he did busi
ness with a flower.
"I'd be willing to say the
flowers were courtesy of Kinko's
Copies, he said. "It would be
great advertising for them."
Sterbal also approached the
manager of the Menlo Park
Kinko's. Angie Walsh, with his
proposals.
Sterbal said Walsh told him
she "would think it over and call
him back," but told The Daily
last night she had no intention of
ciflling vSterbel.
Walsh, a friend of Dicker's,
said she thought it highly unlikely
