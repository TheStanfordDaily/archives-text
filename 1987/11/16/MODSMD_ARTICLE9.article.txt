Budget negotiators predict accord
WASHINGTON — Congressional budget negotiators from
both parties predicted yesterday that they would achieve an ac
cord with the Reagan administration this week on reducing the
federal deficit by about $30 billion, but said the package will in
clude cuts in popular retirement programs only if the president
and the top leaders in Congress actively support it.
House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D-Wash.), who has
chaired the budget talks that begin their fourth week today, said
yesterday on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley" that the
discussions will produce a multiyear compromise package
before Friday, the date when the federal budget will automati
cally be cut by more than $24 billion under the nation's revised
balanced-budget law.
But Foley, repeating the ground rules established by Presi
dent Reagan when the negotiations began, said that the evolving
compromise package of about $30 billion won't include reduc
tions in Social Security and other retirement benefits "unless
the rules are changed again."
Any change, Foley said, would require "a joint agreement"
by Reagan, House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas) and Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.).
II.S. official makes summit caveat
MOSCOW — A senior U.S. official visiting Moscow said yes
terday that the Soviet Union must loosen its rules on emigration
if it wants next month's U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington to
be a success.
Addressing a group of about 75 Soviet citizens who have been
refused permission to leave the country. Deputy Secretary of
State John Whitehead said he will meet today with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and a top aide on
humanitarian issues.
"We'll tell the Soviets that if they want the summit to be suc
cessful, they've got to change their emigration policy,"
Whitehead said. "No country has the right to keep people in a
prison within its borders when they want to leave."
While the Kremlin has been more lenient on allowing people
to leave the country in recent months, he said, the United States
will continue to work on behalf of free emigration "so long as
there is a single one of you left here," he added.
Whitehead arrived yesterday for a final set of talks on human
rights with his Soviet counterparts in advance of the meeting be
tween President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
starting Dec. 7 in Washington.
In Whitehead's audience at the U.S. embassy were two So
viet women married to Americans who were told just last Friday
that they had permission to leave after years of waiting.
Botha hints at releasing Mandela
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — There are signs that
South African President Pieter Botha, anxious to engage
credible black leaders in a political dialogue before national
elections in 1989, has embarked on a plan that would lead to
freedom for African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
and other imprisoned leaders and eventually to power-sharing
talks with black radicals.
Publicly, Botha has scoffed at such speculation, belittling
journalists for competing with one another in "composing wild
dreams" about Mandela's release.
At a provincial convention of the ruling National Party last
week, he said the government would not talk with the ANC,
adding, "The world cannot expect us to negotiate with people
who are not prepared to make peaceful co-existence a reality."
But the president, by his words and deeds over the last six
months, appears to be trying to placate the extreme right-wing
Conservative Party, which made inroads in last May's whites
only parliamentary elections at the expense of Botha's ruling
National Party.
Senior Cabinet officials admit that the thrust of the govern
ment's actions since the elections has been to lure the ANC and
its supporters into power-sharing negotiations by systematically
removing obstacles that black nationalists have said prevent
them from participating.
Iraq launches new attacks in Gulf
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraq yesterday launched fresh air attacks
against Iranian oil installations, but conceded that it had lost one
fighter-bomber as the tempo of air and ground attacks opera
tions increased in the Persian Gulf war.
Iran said it had downed two Iraqi aircraft that had attacked
the Bakhtaran refinery and the northern gulf oilfields of Gach
Saran. Iran said at least seven villagers were killed and 16 others
wounded by the air raids.
Iraq reported a total of 101 fighter-bomber missions, with at
least 60 Iranian soldiers being killed and one tank, one armored
troop carrier and eight vehicles being destroyed in ground
engagements.
Iraq also reported 10 Iraqi civilians had been killed and nine
others wounded by Iranian artillery shelling attacks on the
southern border city of Basra.
The official Iranian news agency IRNA, meanwhile, reported
that President AM Khamenei had chaired a joint session of the
Cabinet, Supreme Defense Council and Supreme Mobilization
Council aimed at concluding plans for a series of planned ground
offensives along the 700 mile border with Iraq.
Previous reports had suggested that the Iranians were prepar
ing for a massive ground assault across southern Iraq to gain
more territory before any U.N.-imposed ceasefire in the gulf.
India, Sri Lanka clash at border
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (DPA) — Twenty-seven people were
killed and 20 injured yesterday in a clash between Tamil guerril
las and Indian peace-keeping forces in northern Sri Lanka, offi
cial sources said.
Most of the casualties were said to be members of the Libera
tion Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest Tamil guerrilla group
fighting for an independent homeland in the north and east of Sri
Lanka.
Independent sources said an unspecified number of civilians
were killed in the fighting, which took place in Vandaramollai,
about 9 miles west of the town of Batticaloa.
The area has been under curfew since Friday while 6,000 In
dian troops conduct house-to-house searches for Tigers mem
bers believed to have regrouped in the east after the Indian
forces ousted them from their strongholds in the north around
Jaffna.
The curfew was relaxed for several hours Sunday in Bat
ticaloa. Police sources said two suspected Tamil guerrillas were
killed by Indian troops on the outskirts of the town.
In other incidents, four Tigers soldiers were killed in a land
mine explosion near a refugee camp at Vavuniya in the north and
10 Tigers suspects were arrested in the Jaffna region, state radio
said.
