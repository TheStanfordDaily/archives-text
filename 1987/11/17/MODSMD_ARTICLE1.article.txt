"People of the earth must handle human rights,"
declared Jack Healey, executive director of Am
nesty International USA, during a speech on human
rights in the 1980s last night at Cubberley
Auditorium.
Healey said that one of his goals as executive di
rector has been to make people in the United States
aware of what the organization is and what it is
doing.
The world is interdependent and young, Healey
said, and it is up to this generation to make it a bet
ter place. Most of the people who are joining Am
nesty International are young people who have
been reached by music tours sponsored by Am
nesty, according to Healey. Healey also said he
hasn't noticed many college professors in the audi

"The privilege that we Americans have should be
used well," Healey said. "It is not fair to take and
take and not to give.
"When a world teeming with pain and agony rises
up in front of you and you deny its existence, I say
to you, question yourself if you don't do something
about it when it's within your power," Healey said.
One-third of the world's governments torture
their people, according to Healey. Amnesty Inter
national tries to expose these torturers as criminals
and to put public pressure on them to stop their
human rights abuses, Healey said.
The idea that world human rights have improved
is untrue, according to Healey. Instead, public con
sciousness of human rights abuses has increased,
Healey said, due to the efforts of Amnesty Interna
tional and similar organizations.
"If everyone is not protected, then none of us are
protected," Healey said.
People who have been tortured want it never to
happen to anybody ever again, Healey said. Victims
of torture want the story told, and they want some
thing to be done about it, he said.
Healey gave examples of torture in foreign
countries that, he said, happen every day. Chilean
children are grossly abused and threatened with
rape. South African children are abused, and
Iranian fathers are forced to "buy the bullet" to kill
