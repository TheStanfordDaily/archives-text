"People of the earth must handle human rights,"
declared Jack Healey, executive director of Am
nesty International USA, during a speech on human
rights in the 1980s last night at Cubberley
Auditorium.
Healey said that one of his goals as executive di
rector has been to make people in the United States
aware of what the organization is and what it is
doing.
The world is interdependent and young, Healey
said, and it is up to this generation to make it a bet
ter place. Most of the people who are joining Am
nesty International are young people who have
been reached by music tours sponsored by Am
nesty, according to Healey. Healey also said he
hasn't noticed many college professors in the audi
ence during his recent college lecture tours.
"The privilege that we Americans have should be
used well," Healey said. "It is not fair to take and
take and not to give.
"When a world teeming with pain and agony rises
up in front of you and you deny its existence, I say
to you, question yourself if you don't do something
about it when it's within your power," Healey said.
One-third of the world's governments torture
their people, according to Healey. Amnesty Inter
national tries to expose these torturers as criminals
and to put public pressure on them to stop their
human rights abuses, Healey said.
The idea that world human rights have improved
is untrue, according to Healey. Instead, public con
sciousness of human rights abuses has increased,
Healey said, due to the efforts of Amnesty Interna
tional and similar organizations.
"If everyone is not protected, then none of us are
protected," Healey said.
People who have been tortured want it never to
happen to anybody ever again, Healey said. Victims
of torture want the story told, and they want some
thing to be done about it, he said.
Healey gave examples of torture in foreign
countries that, he said, happen every day. Chilean
children are grossly abused and threatened with
rape. South African children are abused, and
Iranian fathers are forced to "buy the bullet" to kill
their own sons, according to
Healey.
Torture never leaves a person,
Healey said. Its effects and its
memories are lifelong and can
rush to the surface at any time,
he said.
Healey credited his organiza
tion and similar groups with
giving torture victims a place to
seek help, and he credited the
people of the world with getting
human rights issues onto the po
litical agenda.
Healey criticized the U.S. gov
ernment tor what he said was its
lack of concern and action on
world human rights. He warned
the sparse crowd to "be suspici
ous of governments."
Four years ago, Healey said,
the United States government
sent 2400 shock batons to the
Republic of South Africa to be
used by the police against anti
apartheid activists. According to
Healey, the Defense Depart
ment s only answer to this charge
was that it "slipped by."
Healey concluded his speech
by saying that people cannot
keep waiting for others to act and
cannot keep "passing the buck."
