# Denver crash death toll at 27
## 
### 
DENVER — Shaken survivors
recounted the last terrible mo
ments of Flight 1713 yesterday as
federal investigators began trying
to find out why the Continental
jetliner crashed during a snowy
takeoff from Denver's Stapleton
Airport.
Another passenger died yester
day, bringing the death toll to 27.
A total of 55 people survived the
crash Sunday afternoon, many of
them walking away from the
twisted debris with just scratches
and bruises. Of the 27 still hospi
talized, six were listed in critical
condition.
"I thought 1 was going to die.
It happened so slowly that 1 had
the time to think it three times,"
said Dr. Fred Helpenstell, a 56-
year-old orthopedic surgeon
from Nampa, Idaho. "I just
hoped that it wouldn't hurt too
much."
Helpenstell, who escaped with
only a broken finger and chills,
was trapped in the wreckage for
more than two hours before "a
man named Larry" was able to

free him.
"I tried to think about other
things — other trips, things in the
past, my wife and family," he
said.
"Thanksgiving seemed an aw
fully good thing to think about."
Airline officials confirmed that
the DC-9 was briefly airborne
before it veered off the slushy
runway and slammed into a shal
low gully.
The plane skidded through the
freshly fallen snow for more than
15(H) feet, overturning and finally
breaking into three maior pieces,
scattering baggage and debris in
its icy wake.
"The whole fuselage twisted
like a chicken whose neck was
wrung," airport official Richard
Boulware said.
Jim Burnett, chairman of the
National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) team investigating
the crash, said it could take
"months" to determine what
caused the accident.
He said the plane's two/'black
boxes" were both recovered in

good condition and sent to Wash
ington for analysis.
The boxes, one called a cock
pit voice recorder and the other a
flight data recorder, are expected
to provide the NTSB with the
conversations in the cockpit and
data about the plane's perform
ance in the final seconds before
the crash.
The NTSB investigative team,
which arrived here yesterday
from Washington, will begin ex
amining the wreckage today for
further clues.
Although the NTSB stressed
that it was still too early to spec
ulate on what caused the acci
dent, investigators were known
to be focusing on a number of
possible factors:
• The weather. Burnett said that
while the weather was "rather
atrocious" at the time, "that
does not necessarily lead to the
conclusion that weather caused
it."
• De-icing. Excess ice on wings
can cripple a takeoff in snowy
weather, but Continental said the

plane was sprayed with a hot
(190-degree) mixture of alcohol
and water about 20 minutes
before takeoff.
• Fire. Some witnesses reported
a brief fire onboard as the nlane
crashed, although the NTSB said
none of the victims suffered
burns. While the wreckage was
not charred, Burnett said he saw
evidence of soot in the debris.
• Mechanical failure. Continen
tal said the 21-year-old plane
passed its last routine inspection
Oct. 27 and had flown only 126
hours since then. The NTSB said
it is still too early to tell whether
there was any major system mal
function.
• Human error. Again, the
NTSB said it is premature to
speculate whether there was any
error by the experienced cockpit
crew.
Aviation officials said the
black boxes were expected to
yield ..helpful data about the
plane's final moments.

breaking into three maior pieces,
scattering baggage and debris in
its icy wake.
"The whole fuselage twisted
like a chicken whose neck was
wrung," airport official Richard
Boulware said.
Jim Burnett, chairman of the
National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) team investigating
the crash, said it could take
"months" to determine what
caused the accident.
He said the plane's two/'black
boxes" were both recovered in

good condition and sent to Wash
ington for analysis.
The boxes, one called a cock
pit voice recorder and the other a
flight data recorder, are expected
to provide the NTSB with the
conversations in the cockpit and
data about the plane's perform
ance in the final seconds before
the crash.
The NTSB investigative team,
which arrived here yesterday
from Washington, will begin ex
amining the wreckage today for
further clues.
Although the NTSB stressed
that it was still too early to spec
ulate on what caused the acci
dent, investigators were known
to be focusing on a number of
possible factors:
• The weather. Burnett said that
while the weather was "rather
atrocious" at the time, "that
does not necessarily lead to the
conclusion that weather caused
it."
• De-icing. Excess ice on wings
can cripple a takeoff in snowy
weather, but Continental said the

plane was sprayed with a hot
(190-degree) mixture of alcohol
and water about 20 minutes
before takeoff.
• Fire. Some witnesses reported
a brief fire onboard as the nlane
crashed, although the NTSB said
none of the victims suffered
burns. While the wreckage was
not charred, Burnett said he saw
evidence of soot in the debris.
• Mechanical failure. Continen
tal said the 21-year-old plane
passed its last routine inspection
Oct. 27 and had flown only 126
hours since then. The NTSB said
it is still too early to tell whether
there was any major system mal
function.
• Human error. Again, the
NTSB said it is premature to
speculate whether there was any
error by the experienced cockpit
crew.
Aviation officials said the
black boxes were expected to
yield ..helpful data about the
plane's final moments.
