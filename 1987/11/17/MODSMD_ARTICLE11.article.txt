Stanford Police will turn over
the complaint of junior Robert
Sterbal against Palo Alto Kinko's
Copies manager Chuck Dicker to
the Santa Clara County District
Attorney to determine whether
arrests should be made, police
officials said yesterday.
Sterbal charges that Dicker
threatened his life after Sterbal
requested $5000 in exchange for
25(H) Kinko's coupons that were
mistakenly missing a one-per
customer limit. Dicker denies
making the threat.

Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington said the police did not
have enough evidence to arrest
Dicker because Dicker and Ster
bal gave conflicting testimonies.
According to Herrington, be
cause Dicker did not take physi
cal action against Sterbal, police
will have to wait for the district
attorney to decide if any further
actions are to be taken.
The district attorney was un
available for comment yesterday.
Dicker, who said that Sterbal's
actions amount to extortion,
does not intend to press any
charges against Sterbal. "What

we want is for him to leave us
alone," Dicker said.
The Palo Alto Police were un
available for comment.
Sterbal is trying to convince
Kinko's to allow him to copy
course readers in exchange for
the coupons so that he can sell
them more cheaply than the
Bookstore. If Kinko's disagrees,
Sterbal said he would hand out
the 25(H) coupons he has amassed
to Kinko's customers.
Sterbal said he has studied
business practices extensively
and that what he is doing is legal.
