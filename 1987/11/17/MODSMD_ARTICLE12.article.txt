## Mancall describes some of the problems the nation faces 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Raising several questions
about the identity of Israel and
pointing out the many "ironic"
problems the nation faces, His
tory Prof. Mark Mancall ad
dressed the "uncertain" future
of Israel in a speech at the Fac
ulty Club yesterday.
Zionism dictates that Israel
should try to become as inde
pendent as possible, Mancall
said. If the country moves
away from strong support from
the United States, American
Jews will have to assert them
selves more actively if they
want to have an effect in Israel,
he said.
"If I participate in Israel as
an American, then I am step
ping away," he said. "If I par
ticipate in Israel as a Jew, then
I am not."
Mancall, who recently re
turned from a two-year sabbati
cal in Israel, said that Israel, 40
years after its independence
was declared, faces an
"existential crisis which re
quires us to engage in reflection
and self-searching of ironies."
According to Mancall, who
called himself a Zionist atheist,
America's image of Israel is
based on "the literary myth of
milk and honey." Mancall,
who helped create the Haifa
Overseas Studies Program in
Israel, said that American Jews
concentrate on "the miracle of
Israel's survival," when in
reality it is not the existence of
Israel, but the political, eco
nomic, cultural and moral prob
lems, that are in question.
"It is a given fact that Israel
exists" as a nation, Mancall
said. "America's continued
emphasis on the celebration of

kk The Holocaust is
now almost a gen
eration in the
past. . . . Now the
question seems to
be: 'Can we sur
vive ourselves? 1 "
— Mark Mancall

survival is a way of masking the
more painful question of what
Israel will become."
Emphasizing that he had no
answers about the future of Is
rael, Mancall outlined the
"crises" that Israel is confront
ing and provided "a host of
moral questions" that he said
he hopes American Jews will
confront.
According to Mancall, there
are four issues that American
Jews must consider if they are
to accept the "reality" of Is
rael:
• the political crisis stemming
from the absence of a unified
national political theory;
• the economic crisis, which
"suffers from the problem of
dependence on the United
States";
• conflict between orthodoxy
and secularism: and
• the conflict between "He
brew culture and cos
mopolitanism."
For American Jews to partic
ipate in "shaping the Jewish
state," Mancall said he wanted
students "to begin asking the

questions (about) the dilemma
of democracy versus Judaism"
in political theory, about the
use of "law versus power."
In addition, he said Ameri
can Jews should examine rac
ism toward Arabs and secular
Jews, the "future of Hebrew
culture and Israel's relation
ship with America.
Lastly, Mancall asked Amer
ican Jews to consider the ques
tion, "How does the nature of
Jewish life change because of
the existence of Israel?"
Mancall said he is unsure
about the survival of Jews
living outside Israel. "The
Holocaust is now almost a gen
eration in the past. The Jewish
people have survived the
West's attempt to destroy it,"
Mancall said. "Now the ques
tion seems to be,' Can we
(American Jews) survive our
selves?' "
The lecture, the first in a
year-long series of five, was
sponsored by Stanford Hillel
and the Stanford Faculty and
Student Campaigns of the
Jewish Community Federation.
