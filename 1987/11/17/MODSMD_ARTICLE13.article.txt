## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Vote no on amendment 
### 
Once again the ASSU is trying to convince
students that they should approve a constitu
tional amendment by which they could be taxed
to pay for large capital projects, such as renova
tion of the Boathouse.
Each of the last two years, similar amend
ments have failed to gain student support. This
year's amendment is nothing more than a bad
rewrite of the one that has been defeated before.
Like amendments proposed in the past, this
year's amendment would create a permanent
mechanism by which students could tax them
selves over several years to finance the large
capital projects of student groups. Just as in the
past, this is a fundamentally bad idea. Students
should not be carrying the burden of financing
construction on campus — that is the Univer
sity's responsibility.
The ASSU's desire to improve the Boathouse
is simply part of a larger desire to better the ath
letic facilities on campus. But that kind of capital
improvement is not the job of students.
Like previous proposals, the present amend
ment is impractical in that passing any given cap
ital fee request would be almost impossible.
Two-thirds of the ASSU Senate must approve a
request for the ballot. Then two-thirds of the stu
dents voting in the election must approve the re
quest, and that two-thirds must represent at least
15 percent of the student body.
Passage of fee requests would be further inhib-

ited by the fact that students would be taxed to
start projects that are unlikely to be completed
during their few years at Stanford. It is unfair
and impractical to ask students to fund building
or renovation that they would never have the
chance to benefit from.
A lot of time and effort would be wasted trying
to gain support for capital fee requests; that time
and effort would be better used in efforts to con
vince the University to meet its obligation of
providing necessary student facilities.
In addition, the amendment could sabotage
capital projects in another way. A failure by stu
dents to approve a capital fee request for a proj
ect — the Boathouse, for example — could con
vey to the University the message that students
don't really need or want that particular project
to be funded.
The only major difference between this year's
amendment and last year's is that voting stu
dents could get their tax refunded under the new
amendment. That, however, is an insignificant
change and doesn't solve the larger problems of
the proposed amendment.
In its first two times before the voters, the
capital fee amendment failed by slim margins.
Voters should demonstrate strong opposition to
the amendment in this year's election so that the
ASSU stops wasting its time on legislation that
does not serve students' best interests.
