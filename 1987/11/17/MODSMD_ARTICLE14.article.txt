## Definitions are vague 
### 
To judge from the letters in
The Daily, there are apparently
two major varieties of religious
belief: the vague and the dog
matic. The recent column "Har
nessing the energies of love with
Christ ' (Daily, Nov. 11) is a per
fect example of the former (an il
lustration of the latter is to be
found in any "bible-thumper").

Webster's Dictionary defines
Christianity as "the religion
derived from Jesus Christ, based
on the Bible as sacred scrip
ture." Given this, the author's
characterization of Christianity,
namely that it is "about the won
derment of living and the affirma
tion of human worth," doesn't
hold water, for this is not what
Christ taught.
Christ taught his followers that
life on earth was unimportant and
that they should concentrate
their attention on the afterlife.
Far from enjoining men to seek
"the wonderment of living" or to
"celebrate life," Christ preached
that indifference to the pleasures
that this life offers is the essence
of virtue. Further, the major em
phasis of Christ's teaching is that
human beings are inherently
worthless (that is, sinful) and can
achieve salvation only through
divine mercy (which, in the
Christian mythology, was

Christ's purpose on earth.)
One thing the author gets right
about Christianity is that it en
joins one to accept others' imper
fections ("sins") and forgive
them, to leave judgment and
thinking to God. In a related
vein, Christ enjoins men to serve
the weak, rather than striving for
personal happiness and fulfill
ment; is this compatible with the
author's "wonderment of
living"? If so, this very Christian
"wonderment of living" has little
to do with personal\appiness,
for service to others is hardly
equivalent to self-fulfillment and
happiness.
As for the author's vagueness,
he offers humanity a prescription
for attaining "holiness" without
ever defining it or saying why
one should strive after it. As far
as I can tell, this odd concept of
"holiness" involves passively
accepting one's imperfections
and those of others.
Is the author telling us that
holiness is the same as
"wholeness," which requires
that one have a certain number of
imperfections and that one
"accept" them? If so, why is this
a desirable condition? How is it
possible to have "respect for
each other's worth" if we are not
worthy, virtuous in some sense?
And, how can one judge worthi
ness and strive for it while
passively accepting one's neg
ative side?
In spite of his apparent inten

tions, the author has not
succeeded in escaping from the
judgmental aspects of Christian
ity. To talk of "self-worth" with
out a standard of worthiness is
gibberish. Nor can one talk of
"imperfections" without a stan
dard of perfection. The author
seems to be telling us that we
should help each other to feel
good about not being perfect, and
that we should consider com
placent imperfection to be the
sine qua non of "holiness."
The author's opening quote
tells us that the essence of
"holiness" is to be partly bad
and partly good, and to accept
this state. Apparently, having a
negative side is necessary if one
wants to be "integrated into the
celebration of life." This, for
once, is a thoroughly Christian
concept: that the good, as
defined by Christianity, is
opposed to enjoyment of life on
earth.
The author is advising us to ac
cept this Christian view that
happiness on earth and the good
are incompatible, but to ignore
the good and conspire with
others to reassure ourselves
about it. My question to him and
to the reader is this: Can a con
cept of the good that makes
happiness in this life a conse
quence of deviations from the
good be a valid concept of the
good?
