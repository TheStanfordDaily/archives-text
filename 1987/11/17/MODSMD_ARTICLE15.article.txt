Ways to solve the
parking problem
I have to disagree with the
Nov. 11 editorial which sugges
ted that we start paving over
Stanford's open lands to solve
our parking problem: better solu
tions are available.
In my more than four years at
Stanford, I've seen students
bring cars to campus for a variety
of questionable reasons: the
Lagunita resident who used his
car to drive to classes on rainy
days; the student who had a car
to visit his parents in Menlo Park
on weekends; or the student who
drove a car twice a quarter â€”
once at the start to get here, once
at the end to leave.
How do we solve the problem?
There are more solutions than
building more parking spaces.
Raise the cost of permits to
reflect actual cost of the loss of
the space the parking lot occu
pies. Require students who want
to pay the subsidized rate of $25
per year to show they need a car
on campus. Provide better bike
lanes to surrounding areas where
students live, and provide bus
service to these areas on rainy
days. Encourage students to rent
cars instead of bringing them
here by leasing Stanford land to a
rental car company, like Rent-a-
Wreck, that could rent cars at

reduced prices for weekend road
trips.

Take the time to
listen and learn
The letter "Falling off the
Lunatic Fringe" (Daily, Nov. 10)
typified the kind of reasoning
that Profs. Manley and Rebholz
are protesting at the Hoover In
stitution. Perhaps if the author of
the letter took the time to listen
and hear what others are saying,
he could learn something.
The author quotes Rebholz
and Manley's position that "no
university can tolerate within its
midst a highly autonomous, poli
tically active think tank, whether
that think tank espouses the
values of Adam Smith or Karl
Marx."
Equating the influence of the
Political Science and English De
partments to that of the Hoover
Institution, the author then
recommends that Rebholz and
Manley resign their positions to
"remedy this injustice" within
those departments. What he fails
to notice, however, is the differ
ence between the influence of
those departments, which at
most have only a moderate effect
on the University's overall politi
cal stance, and the autonomous

nature of the Hoover Institution.
In other words, the author's il
logical and hostile argument
shows that he has missed the real
debate. It is not merely the right
wing politics of the Hoover Insti
tution that Rebholz and Manley
protest, but it is the autonomous
position that allows it to compro
mise Stanford's reputation that is
the essence of their argument.
He claims that Manley and Reb
holz "fear competition" and that
"their definition of academic
freedom [is] the freedom to
espouse their views in an un
opposed, uniform dialogue."
He is accusing them of the kind
of autonomous freedom that the
Hoover Institution alone benefits
from. Next time the author
should get to the heart of the
issue before insulting others and
their viewpoints.
As a final thought, the claim
that Manley and Rebholz's fear
of competition is inherent in their
leftist politics lacks support. As a
matter of fact, why would the au
thor welcome the two professors'
resignations so quickly? Could it
be that the author fears competi
tion? Perhaps this quality is not
unique to leftist politics, but to
certain individuals.

Policy, conference
contrast markedly
According to the article on the
Faculty Senate meeting (Daily,
Nov. 13), President Donald Ken
nedy said that the University
subsidizes membership in clubs
such as the Bohemian Club be
cause they may provide Univer
sity officials with "a constant set
of relationships that make it pos
sible to have contacts and per
sonal relations."
I interpret this to mean that it
is to Stanford's financial and po
litical advantage to have some of
its top officials belong to the
Bohemian Club. If so, then the
clubs policy of barring women
from membership amounts to
economic as well as social dis
crimination.
Stanford's willingness to coun
tenance such discrimination is in
ironic contrast with its sponsor
ship of last weekend's confer
ence on institutional racism,
"You Can Make a Difference."
Elaine Jones, the NAACP offi
cial who opened the conference
with Kennedy's blessing, would
not be allowed into the Bohemian
Club, simply because- she is ;i
woman.
