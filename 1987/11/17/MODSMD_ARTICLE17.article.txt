# In defense of the truth
## 
### 
The major goal of a Stanford education is to im
part both a solid base of knowledge and the critical
thinking skills necessary to use that knowledge.
These skills should include an appreciation of the
importance of factual information in an argument
and a realization that it is important to consider
facts that support both sides of an argument. Since
these skills are necessary to succeed academically
at Stanford, one must presume that they exist in
Stanford students.

However, it is very distressing to see how little
regard for the truth many in the Stanford commu
nity have once they step outside of the classroom.
When 1 read about student politicians and listen to
presentations on campus, by both faculty and stu
dents, I am frequently shocked at how little regard
is placed on factual truths. When someone speaks
publicly, his audience has a right to expect that the
speaker has learned some basic facts about his sub
ject.
True, different people may have different views
of some "facts," but this explanation has its limits.
A few years ago, 1 attended a campus presentation
by a group opposing U.S. involvement in Central
America. 1 found the presentation interesting.
However, when the speaker showed a picture of an
aircraft carrier and called it the battleship New Jer
sey, she lost a lot of,credibility. This was soon fol
lowed by a slide that she described as contras car
rying American-made weapons.
However, the group was armed with Soviet Ak
-475. They may have been contras, and the AK-47s
may have been supplied by the United States, but
her statements gave me no confidence in these
claims, or in anything that she said. 1 was disap
pointed that she hadn't bothered to learn what she
was talking about. But I was even more unhappy at
how little she cared. She rattled off her descriptions
without a second thought.
Students are not the only ones to twist the truth.
Faculty members can do the same thing. 1 remem
ber one professor giving an informal talk on "the
aesthetics of weapons." It was an interesting talk
except that the professor knew very little about
weapons but comfortably recited off a lot of facts
about them. However, many of the "facts" were
wrong. Unfortunately, instances such as these are
all too common at Stanford.
Besides provable misstatements, there are many
other disturbing abuses of truth at Stanford. One
popular abuse is "proof by assertion." This is often
done when someone has no evidence to back up his
claim and no easy way to manufacture any. They
will merely assert something as a truth, or a likely
truth, and put the burden of refutation on their op
ponents.

This technique appeared here recently, when
Stanford was accused of supporting the Bohemian
Club in San Francisco, merely because some Stan
ford faculty belonged to it. It was claimed, without
a shred of evidence, that Stanford was subsidizing
their Bohemian Club membership fees.
Student representatives have a responsibility to
the student body to check on their facts, and not
merely blindly accept assertions from anyone, es
pecially not a union looking for some free publicity.
1 don't want to sound anti-union, and I don't know
how justified their complaints are, but they came to
Stanford merely for publicity. And. by making a
few accusations that were irrelevant to their cause,
they got it. One can also ask why the ASSU is so
concerned with a San Francisco club instead of
campus events, but that is a subject for another
column.
Another way to twist the truth is to try to hide it.
When one has no response to an opponent s factual
arguments, one can try to ignore their facts or their
argument. This is the least blatant abuse of truth
that I will discuss, but it is also one of the most
common. It probably happens to some degree in
any discussion. In an argument, it is natural to em
phasize the positive facts and de-emphasize the
detracting ones. However, it can easily be carried
to extremes.
One way is to ignore unfavorable facts. Adminis
trators are very often guilty of this. Many times I
have heard University billing charges justified with
a simple "that's what it costs us, so that's what we
charge you." Hnd of discussion. No arguments that
the cost is outrageous, or that an outside contractor
could do the same job for half or one-third of the
price, will be accepted.
Another form of this is when one political group
tries to silence another opposing group. Phis hap
pened frequently in the 1960s and 19705, when pro-:
government speakers were often harassed and*
prevented from speaking on college campuses. It is
quite possible to demonstrate against a speaker
without preventing him from speaking.
Last year's anti-apartheid protest at the Centen
nial ceremonies are a good model of how this can
be done effectively. The protesters made their
point without infringing on the speakers' rights or
alienating the audience. When protestors do dis
rupt a speech, they merely reduce the level of dis
cussion to the question of who did what to whom at
the protest and thus obscure the truths of both
sides of the argument.
At Stanford, too often people get involved in po
litical or non-political issues without bothering to
learn about a situation. It is much easier to just
lump an issue in with a similar issue, without
checking if the parallel really holds. In the first ex
ample 1 mentioned, the aircraft carrier New Jersey:
was in the news; the speaker just assumed that the:
aircraft carrier must be the New Jersey.
Without an adequate store of knowledge, it is:
very easy to abuse the little that one does know.:
Such sloppiness rarely gets by in Stanford's aca
demic world. It should not be accepted outside of
the classroom either.

trators are very often guilty of this. Many times I
have heard University billing charges justified with
a simple "that's what it costs us, so that's what we
charge you." Hnd of discussion. No arguments that
the cost is outrageous, or that an outside contractor
could do the same job for half or one-third of the
price, will be accepted.
Another form of this is when one political group
tries to silence another opposing group. Phis hap
pened frequently in the 1960s and 19705, when pro-:
government speakers were often harassed and*
prevented from speaking on college campuses. It is
quite possible to demonstrate against a speaker
without preventing him from speaking.
Last year's anti-apartheid protest at the Centen
nial ceremonies are a good model of how this can
be done effectively. The protesters made their
point without infringing on the speakers' rights or
alienating the audience. When protestors do dis
rupt a speech, they merely reduce the level of dis
cussion to the question of who did what to whom at
the protest and thus obscure the truths of both
sides of the argument.
At Stanford, too often people get involved in po
litical or non-political issues without bothering to
learn about a situation. It is much easier to just
lump an issue in with a similar issue, without
checking if the parallel really holds. In the first ex
ample 1 mentioned, the aircraft carrier New Jersey:
was in the news; the speaker just assumed that the:
aircraft carrier must be the New Jersey.
Without an adequate store of knowledge, it is:
very easy to abuse the little that one does know.:
Such sloppiness rarely gets by in Stanford's aca
demic world. It should not be accepted outside of
the classroom either.

The major goal of a Stanford education is to im
part both a solid base of knowledge and the critical
thinking skills necessary to use that knowledge.
These skills should include an appreciation of the
importance of factual information in an argument
and a realization that it is important to consider
facts that support both sides of an argument. Since
these skills are necessary to succeed academically
at Stanford, one must presume that they exist in
Stanford students.

However, it is very distressing to see how little
regard for the truth many in the Stanford commu
nity have once they step outside of the classroom.
When 1 read about student politicians and listen to
presentations on campus, by both faculty and stu
dents, I am frequently shocked at how little regard
is placed on factual truths. When someone speaks
publicly, his audience has a right to expect that the
speaker has learned some basic facts about his sub
ject.
True, different people may have different views
of some "facts," but this explanation has its limits.
A few years ago, 1 attended a campus presentation
by a group opposing U.S. involvement in Central
America. 1 found the presentation interesting.
However, when the speaker showed a picture of an
aircraft carrier and called it the battleship New Jer
sey, she lost a lot of,credibility. This was soon fol
lowed by a slide that she described as contras car
rying American-made weapons.
However, the group was armed with Soviet Ak
-475. They may have been contras, and the AK-47s
may have been supplied by the United States, but
her statements gave me no confidence in these
claims, or in anything that she said. 1 was disap
pointed that she hadn't bothered to learn what she
was talking about. But I was even more unhappy at
how little she cared. She rattled off her descriptions
without a second thought.
Students are not the only ones to twist the truth.
Faculty members can do the same thing. 1 remem
ber one professor giving an informal talk on "the
aesthetics of weapons." It was an interesting talk
except that the professor knew very little about
weapons but comfortably recited off a lot of facts
about them. However, many of the "facts" were
wrong. Unfortunately, instances such as these are
all too common at Stanford.
Besides provable misstatements, there are many
other disturbing abuses of truth at Stanford. One
popular abuse is "proof by assertion." This is often
done when someone has no evidence to back up his
claim and no easy way to manufacture any. They
will merely assert something as a truth, or a likely
truth, and put the burden of refutation on their op
ponents.

This technique appeared here recently, when
Stanford was accused of supporting the Bohemian
Club in San Francisco, merely because some Stan
ford faculty belonged to it. It was claimed, without
a shred of evidence, that Stanford was subsidizing
their Bohemian Club membership fees.
Student representatives have a responsibility to
the student body to check on their facts, and not
merely blindly accept assertions from anyone, es
pecially not a union looking for some free publicity.
1 don't want to sound anti-union, and I don't know
how justified their complaints are, but they came to
Stanford merely for publicity. And. by making a
few accusations that were irrelevant to their cause,
they got it. One can also ask why the ASSU is so
concerned with a San Francisco club instead of
campus events, but that is a subject for another
column.
Another way to twist the truth is to try to hide it.
When one has no response to an opponent s factual
arguments, one can try to ignore their facts or their
argument. This is the least blatant abuse of truth
that I will discuss, but it is also one of the most
common. It probably happens to some degree in
any discussion. In an argument, it is natural to em
phasize the positive facts and de-emphasize the
detracting ones. However, it can easily be carried
to extremes.
