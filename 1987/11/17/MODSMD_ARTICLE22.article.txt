## Of bumps and the BSU: The Bug goes digging 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
1 went and auditioned for the
Original Winter One-Acts this
week, and I don't mean to brag
or anything, but I must say that I
probably put on one of the worst
performances in the history of
civilized theater.
I wouldn't go so far as to say
my acting was wooden, but then
again, after reading my dialogue
a beaver came out of nowhere
and started gnawing on my leg.
The director was very nice,
though, and she told me that Bug
Me was her favorite part of The
Daily. The unexpressed message
here being that as an actor I'm a
terrific writer.
Send your questions and hate
mail to Bug Me, Stanford Daily,
Stork Student Publications
Building, Stanford, Calif., 94305.
Or send them to Bug-Me (Not
B.Bug-Me) at the Tragedies on
LOTS. And remember, as
Laertes says to Hamlet near the
end of the play, "That's not a
knife, THAT'S a knife."
Dear Bug,
I think it would look great on
my investment banker resume if I
were chairman of the Black Stu
dent Union (BSU). One problem,
is it necessary for me to be
black?
- Empty
I figured on this one 1 ought to
go straight to the source, so 1
called Bill King, the current
chairman of the BSU. According
to King, in keeping with Stanford
Voluntary Student Organization
policies, the BSU does not dis
criminate against any person on
the basis of race, sex, religion,
sexual preference, etc.
However. . .
All black students are automat
ically members of the BSU.
Their names are on the BSU
roster, and they enjoy full
privileges of BSU membership.
If a non-black student wishes
to become a member of the BSU,
he or she must do the following:
• Show a demonstrated and doc
umented interest in the liberation
of African people, and demon
strate prior commitment to issues
of this nature.
• Meet with the officers corps

so they can discuss why the stu
dent is interested in joining the
BSU and so the student can fully
understand the role of the BSU.
• Submit to a vote of the general
body membership of the BSU, at
which the non-black student can
either be accepted or rejected for
membership.
How could this be? An ASSU
funded group having different
membership requirements based
solely on race? I decided that it
was time to go underground. I
put on sweats, threw a backpack
over one shoulder and marched
over to the Black House, confi
dent in my disguise as a clueless
Stanford freshman.

Entering the Black House, 1
found my path blocked by a stu
dent. He didn't appear particu
larly thrilled to see me there.
"Hi!" I said with boundless
freshman enthusiasm. "My name
is Andrew, and I'm interested in
getting involved in issues con
cerning the black community. 1
did some work in high school
against racial discrimination.''
He pulled off his Ray-Bans and
cocked his head to one side.
"Freshman, right?"
I nodded my head. Inside I was
exploding with pride. My dis
guise had worked!
"Who would 1 talk to for more
information?" I asked.
"You're talking to him," he
said gruffly.
"Well," I said, "I've heard a
lot about the work done by the
BSU. How do I go about
joining?"
He stared at me with amaze
ment. "You don't join the
BSU," he said, "you're born
into it."
With that he exited, directing
me to another student, who, in all

fairness, was much nicer and
didn't treat me like an invader
from Jupiter.
1 swear that all of this is true. 1
haven't even changed the names
to protect the innocent.
I fled back to the Bug Cave on
my Bugmobile and called the
Asian American Students Asso
ciation (AASA). They assured
me that students of any race, reli
gion, sex and so on were equally
welcome to join AASA.
Then 1 called Hillel, and they
told me that persons of any reli
gion, race, sexual preference and
so on were equally welcome to
serve on the Hillel board (they
don't have memberships).
MEChA (a Chicano group)
said that all races, religions,
sexes and so on were equally
welcome to join them too.
Bill King told me that the
BSU's membership requirements
are similar to those of the Na
tional Organization for Women
(NOW).
1 called NOW, and according
to a representative, persons of
either sex may join NOW, and, in
fact, the San Francisco chapter
has a man on the board of direc
tors.
1 think you get the point.
Bill King says that allowing
black students automatic mem
bership in the BSU while making
non-black students go through a
different process to be admitted
is the same as allowing Stanford
undergraduates automatic admit
tance into Stanford graduate pro
grams, but making non-Stanford
undergraduates go through a dif
ferent acceptance process.
So, my friend, the answer is
yes, you can become chairman of
the BSU, as long as you first
become a member of the BSU. If
you were black you automati
cally would become a member,
but since you are of another race,
you have to go through the proc
ess outlined above and hope you
can convince them of your inter
est in African liberation issues.
Dear Bug,
Does Stanford's road policy
really say that no road can be
smooth? Palm Drive was recently
renovated and it doubles as a
suspension torture test. In other
places, repairs make roads
smooth, but not at Stanford.

Dear Bug,
Why is Palm Drive in such poor
shape? The University is rolling
in money; you'd think they'd
want to make a good impression
on people driving in the main
campus entrance for the first
time.
Dear Bug,
Why is Palm Drive convex?
Dear Bug,
When is Palm Drive going to be
smoothed out? It reminds me of
home. In Chicago, the Housing
Authority currently rents out the
smaller potholes to under
privileged families, and the
larger ones are inhabited by City
Council members.
After the last question, I'm
glad we can move on to a lighter
topic (absolutely no pun in
tended). These are just a few of
the dozens of questions I've
received about Palm Drive in the
last few weeks.
1 talked to the nice folks at Op

erations and Maintenance, and
according to them you should
quit hitching about ALL the
roads at Stanford, and instead
channel your energies into one
huge funk about Palm Drive.
They (we) recently spent $50,000
fixing Campus Drive, and it's in
pretty good shape.
Palm Drive, however, is a dif
ferent story. In fact, with all
those palm trees, it would make a
great place to film a Vietnam
movie. How bout "Full Asphalt
Jacket?" Or "Potoon?"
"The Nightmare on Palm
Street" (Gee, where have 1 heard
that before?) is caused by water
getting trapped under the road
when it rains, creating huge
potholes and other forms of road
acne.
As you may or may not know,
this is how the Grand Canyon
was formed — it used to be a
Stanford road. The reason that
Palm Drive has the hump in the
middle is to let the water run off
and form puddles when it rains.
What has to happen is (Sound

of deathly music) total re
construction. That means tearing
up Palm Drive, putting in
drainage, repaving, etc., etc.
This will cost in the neighbor
hood of the national debt, and the
Office of Facilities Management
is reluctant to shell out that much
money, because if it does so, it
will have no money left over to
do other stuff like much-needed
landscaping.
So until it is decided that Palm
Drive should be a top priority
item, Operations and Mainte
nance will continue to patch the
potholes as they spring up (spring
down?). It's kind of like putting a
Band-Aid on someone with a
fractured skull.
Of course, if a donor were to
come along and foot the bill for
rebuilding Palm Drive, it could
be fixed tomorrow. Then they
could rename Palm Drive after
the donor. Maybe I'll put up the
money; how does Berkowitz
Drive sound?
Sounds like a cheap Israeli sta
tion wagon, that's what.
