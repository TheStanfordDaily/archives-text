## Scientists hope to prevent the disease Newly-found diabetes molecule probed 
### Eric Ly 
Stanford medical researchers are con
ducting a study of a diabetes-related
molecule and may eventually find a way
to prevent diabetes.
The Stanford research team recently
found the exact form of the molecule
that has been known to increase an indi
vidual's likelihood of developing insulin
dependent diabetes. The molecule is
found on the surface of certain white
blood cells that control the body's
immune system.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is
a common form of diabetes and afflicts

more than one million people in the
United States alone. The term "mel
litus" is Latin for "honeyed" — an ap
propriate name for the disease because it
is characterized by abnormally low
levels of sugar in the blood.
The recent finding allowed research
ers to better predict an individual's
chances of developing diabetes.
However, scientists cannot yet act on
this information to prevent the disease,
the researchers said.
The group cautioned that it may be
many years before scientists will have a
practical method of prevention of
insulin-dependent diabetes. "We don't

want to get anyone excited yet," said
Hans Acha-Orbea, a postdoctoral fellow
on the Stanford research team.
The Stanford research team — con
sisting of Acha-Orbea, John Todd, an
other postdoctoral fellow, and Hugh
McDevitt, professor and chairman of
medical microbiology at Stanford — will
try to mimic the actions of diabetes
preventing molecules in diabetic mice.
While the diabetes-related molecule
gives scientists a target to study, it is
only one of several pieces in the puzzle
of diabetes. There are other factors that
cause diabetes, Todd said.
An individual contracts diabetes after
his immune system has mistakenly at
tacked and destroyed the body's own
insulin-producing "islet" cells in the
pancreas.
Once the islet cells are destroyed, the
pancreas can no longer produce insulin
and, consequently, cannot regulate
blood sugar levels. The overspill of
sugar leads to excessive urination,
hunger and thirst as well as loss of
weight. The patient also develops struc
tural and functional disorders of blood
vessels.
To control sugar levels, the diabetic
patient must take injections of insulin
periodically. The chemical insulin helps
the body use sugar and other car
bohydrates.
The Stanford group had known previ
ous to its recent finding that the protein
molecule it is studying is linked to an in
dividual's likelihood of developing
diabetes. However, the group could not
identify the exact role of the gene that
produced the molecule.
The finding by Todd, McDevitt and
John Bell (a postdoctoral fellow who is
now at Oxford) pinpointed the spot on
the protein molecule responsible for
diabetes. The finding may be the most
precise explanation yet for why diabetes
develops in individuals with this type of
molecule.
The immune system is normally
tolerant of the body's own tissues and
proteins. The target molecule, called
HLA-DQ, in healthy individuals helps
the white blood cells decide which harm
ful tissues or substances it should attack.

Todd explained. If an individual has a
particular form of HLA-DQ molecule,
he is resistant to diabetes.
The three other forms of the molecule
appear to predispose a person to the
disease. These forms of the HLA-DQ
molecule mistakenly help turn the
immune system against its own
pancreatic islet cells, Todd said.
The chemical differences between
these forms of the molecule are minute
and can only be detected with highly so
phisticated molecular probes.
By introducing the diabetes-resistant
HLA-DQ molecules into diabetes
predisposed mice, the Stanford group
hopes to restore the mice's tolerance of
their own insulin-producing pancreatic
cells, Acha-Orbea said.
These kinds of experiments must first
be done on mice prone to diabetes, Todd
said. It will be many years before these
experiments can be tried in humans, he
predicted. If the experiments prove suc
cessful. scientists can then develop a
strategy for prevention. "It will be really
exciting if we can get it to work," Acha-
Orbea said.
Scientists have long known that
diabetes is a hereditary disease, and ef
forts to understand its nature have con
centrated in a specific region of the
human genome, consisting of 46
chromosomes. This region lies on the
sixth chromosome and is call HLA, or
human leukocyte antigen.
Chromosomes, which exist in every
cell, contain complete instructions to
build a human body. Among other
immune system responsibilities, the
HLA region encodes HLA-DQ mole
cules found on the surface of white
blood cells. Those molecules differ from
person to person.
Although scientists have known for
several years that certain HLA genetic
configurations are associated with a
predisposition to diabetes, the exact role
of the HLA-DQ gene had not been pin
pointed previously.
Early studies indicated that another
gene. HLA-DR2, near the DQ gene,
decreased an individual s chances of de
veloping diabetes. However, the results
of those studies were somewhat incon
clusive, Acha-Orbea said. I he diabetic

version of the DK genes appear in more
than 90 percent of diabetes patients.
However, those types also appeared in
approximately half of the individuals
who did not develop diabetes.
Members of the Stanford research
group wanted to study the DQ gene.
They cloned the isolated HLA region in
test tubes and analyzed its chemical
composition, deducing information
about proteins coded for the DR-DQ
region. It is the chemical makeup at po
sition number 57 in the DQ protein that
appears to be crucial, Todd said.
All of the healthy individuals the re
searchers studied had aspartic acid, an
amino acid, at position 57 in the
molecule. Amino acids are the building
blocks of protein molecules in the body.
In contrast, at least 95 percent of the 40
diabetics studied had one of three other
amino acids — alanine, serine or valine
— substituted at the "active site." Tests
on laboratory mice showed similar
results.
The findings demonstrated a direct
link between the appearance of aspartic
acid on the DQ molecule and an individ
ual's predisposition toward diabetes. As
long as the nody encodes DQ molecules
which have aspartic acid at position 57,
it is virtually protected from developing
diabetes.
Although the risk of developing
diabetes increases from two to five times
with the harmful forms of the DQ
molecule, Acha-Orbea said, "most
people who have the susceptible genes
do not get the disease." The finding also
explained why individuals with diabetes
predisposed forms of the DR molecule
were healthy.
"We do not know at present whether
(aspartic acid| alone will confer
decreased susceptibility," Todd stated
in the Oct. 15 issue of Nature, which
published the group's findings.
"The aspartic acid is one of perhaps
many critical factors. The shape of the
molecule is also critical, he wrote. Sci
entists must make "a random search
for unidentified genes between the DR
DQ region or even elsewhere in the 46
chromosomes. Such a search will give a
clearer explanation of diabetes suscep
tibility, he said.

phisticated molecular probes.
By introducing the diabetes-resistant
HLA-DQ molecules into diabetes
predisposed mice, the Stanford group
hopes to restore the mice's tolerance of
their own insulin-producing pancreatic
cells, Acha-Orbea said.
These kinds of experiments must first
be done on mice prone to diabetes, Todd
said. It will be many years before these
experiments can be tried in humans, he
predicted. If the experiments prove suc
cessful. scientists can then develop a
strategy for prevention. "It will be really
exciting if we can get it to work," Acha-
Orbea said.
Scientists have long known that
diabetes is a hereditary disease, and ef
forts to understand its nature have con
centrated in a specific region of the
human genome, consisting of 46
chromosomes. This region lies on the
sixth chromosome and is call HLA, or
human leukocyte antigen.
Chromosomes, which exist in every
cell, contain complete instructions to
build a human body. Among other
immune system responsibilities, the
HLA region encodes HLA-DQ mole
cules found on the surface of white
blood cells. Those molecules differ from
person to person.
Although scientists have known for
several years that certain HLA genetic
configurations are associated with a
predisposition to diabetes, the exact role
of the HLA-DQ gene had not been pin
pointed previously.
Early studies indicated that another
gene. HLA-DR2, near the DQ gene,
decreased an individual s chances of de
veloping diabetes. However, the results
of those studies were somewhat incon
clusive, Acha-Orbea said. I he diabetic

version of the DK genes appear in more
than 90 percent of diabetes patients.
However, those types also appeared in
approximately half of the individuals
who did not develop diabetes.
Members of the Stanford research
group wanted to study the DQ gene.
They cloned the isolated HLA region in
test tubes and analyzed its chemical
composition, deducing information
about proteins coded for the DR-DQ
region. It is the chemical makeup at po
sition number 57 in the DQ protein that
appears to be crucial, Todd said.
All of the healthy individuals the re
searchers studied had aspartic acid, an
amino acid, at position 57 in the
molecule. Amino acids are the building
blocks of protein molecules in the body.
In contrast, at least 95 percent of the 40
diabetics studied had one of three other
amino acids — alanine, serine or valine
— substituted at the "active site." Tests
on laboratory mice showed similar
results.
The findings demonstrated a direct
link between the appearance of aspartic
acid on the DQ molecule and an individ
ual's predisposition toward diabetes. As
long as the nody encodes DQ molecules
which have aspartic acid at position 57,
it is virtually protected from developing
diabetes.
Although the risk of developing
diabetes increases from two to five times
with the harmful forms of the DQ
molecule, Acha-Orbea said, "most
people who have the susceptible genes
do not get the disease." The finding also
explained why individuals with diabetes
predisposed forms of the DR molecule
were healthy.
"We do not know at present whether
(aspartic acid| alone will confer
decreased susceptibility," Todd stated
in the Oct. 15 issue of Nature, which
published the group's findings.
"The aspartic acid is one of perhaps
many critical factors. The shape of the
molecule is also critical, he wrote. Sci
entists must make "a random search
for unidentified genes between the DR
DQ region or even elsewhere in the 46
chromosomes. Such a search will give a
clearer explanation of diabetes suscep
tibility, he said.

Stanford medical researcher John Todd holds a mouse that he and colleagues Hugh
McDevitt and Hans Acha-Orbea are using in a study of diabetes.
Stanford medical researchers are con
ducting a study of a diabetes-related
molecule and may eventually find a way
to prevent diabetes.
The Stanford research team recently
found the exact form of the molecule
that has been known to increase an indi
vidual's likelihood of developing insulin
dependent diabetes. The molecule is
found on the surface of certain white
blood cells that control the body's
immune system.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is
a common form of diabetes and afflicts

more than one million people in the
United States alone. The term "mel
litus" is Latin for "honeyed" — an ap
propriate name for the disease because it
is characterized by abnormally low
levels of sugar in the blood.
The recent finding allowed research
ers to better predict an individual's
chances of developing diabetes.
However, scientists cannot yet act on
this information to prevent the disease,
the researchers said.
The group cautioned that it may be
many years before scientists will have a
practical method of prevention of
insulin-dependent diabetes. "We don't

want to get anyone excited yet," said
Hans Acha-Orbea, a postdoctoral fellow
on the Stanford research team.
The Stanford research team — con
sisting of Acha-Orbea, John Todd, an
other postdoctoral fellow, and Hugh
McDevitt, professor and chairman of
medical microbiology at Stanford — will
try to mimic the actions of diabetes
preventing molecules in diabetic mice.
While the diabetes-related molecule
gives scientists a target to study, it is
only one of several pieces in the puzzle
of diabetes. There are other factors that
cause diabetes, Todd said.
An individual contracts diabetes after
his immune system has mistakenly at
tacked and destroyed the body's own
insulin-producing "islet" cells in the
pancreas.
Once the islet cells are destroyed, the
pancreas can no longer produce insulin
and, consequently, cannot regulate
blood sugar levels. The overspill of
sugar leads to excessive urination,
hunger and thirst as well as loss of
weight. The patient also develops struc
tural and functional disorders of blood
vessels.
To control sugar levels, the diabetic
patient must take injections of insulin
periodically. The chemical insulin helps
the body use sugar and other car
bohydrates.
The Stanford group had known previ
ous to its recent finding that the protein
molecule it is studying is linked to an in
dividual's likelihood of developing
diabetes. However, the group could not
identify the exact role of the gene that
produced the molecule.
The finding by Todd, McDevitt and
John Bell (a postdoctoral fellow who is
now at Oxford) pinpointed the spot on
the protein molecule responsible for
diabetes. The finding may be the most
precise explanation yet for why diabetes
develops in individuals with this type of
molecule.
The immune system is normally
tolerant of the body's own tissues and
proteins. The target molecule, called
HLA-DQ, in healthy individuals helps
the white blood cells decide which harm
ful tissues or substances it should attack.

Todd explained. If an individual has a
particular form of HLA-DQ molecule,
he is resistant to diabetes.
The three other forms of the molecule
appear to predispose a person to the
disease. These forms of the HLA-DQ
molecule mistakenly help turn the
immune system against its own
pancreatic islet cells, Todd said.
The chemical differences between
these forms of the molecule are minute
and can only be detected with highly so
phisticated molecular probes.
