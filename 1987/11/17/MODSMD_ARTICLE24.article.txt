## Cal QB Taylor will miss Big Game again Stanford awaits Bears 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
The Big News so far as Big Game Week 87 kicks
off is the annual injury to California quarterback
Troy Taylor, who is expected to miss the contest
for the second straight year.
Taylor broke the index finger on his right
(throwing) hand in Cal's 38-20 upset of Arizona
State on Saturday. The sophomore refuses to rule
himself out of Big Game, but California trainers say
he will be out for six weeks. Taylor did throw a
touchdown pass after his finger was broken,
however.
Taylor broke his jaw against USC last year and
sat with his mouth wired shut as the Bears upset
Stanford, 17-11, at Memorial Stadium.
"Taylor wasn't in the game last season," Stan
ford Coach Jack Elway said, "and we know what
happened.
"As far as I'm concerned, and as far as the
players are concerned, 1 wish Taylor was playing,"
Elway said. "If we go into the football game and
think that because Taylor is not in the football
game it is going to have a big effect, then we're
wrong."
The Bear quarterback has had an outstanding
season, tossing 18 touchdowns in nine games and
completing 61 percent of his passes for 2081 yards.
He is third in the Pacific 10 Conference in total of
fense with 208.1 yards a game.
Senior Brad Howe, who is 5-for-16 for 68 yards,
no touchdowns and one interception this year, will
fill in for Taylor.
"Howe's a senior and a good leader," California
offensive tackle Kam King said. "He's got a lot of

confidence, and 1 have a lot of confidence in him."
Stanford has injury problems of its own. Star
receiver Jeff James is doubtful for Big Game after
suffering a severe groin pull against USC two
weeks ago. Freshman placekicker John Hopkins
(sprained knee) is also unlikely to play for the fifth
straight game. Starting offensive guard Chuck Gil
lingham is out with torn knee ligaments and was
scheduled to undergo arthroscopic surgery yester
day.
But there are numerous bright spots for the Car
dinal. Safety Brad Humphreys was named the Pac
-10 Defensive Player of the Week for his perform
ance in Stanford's 38-7 win over Oregon State. The
senior collected two interceptions, broke up two
passes and tallied five tackles in what Stanford de
fensive coordinator Dick Mannini said "just might
have been the best game of his career."
The defense came up with seven interceptions in
the outing at Corvallis, tying a team record for in
terceptions in one game set in 1934 against Wash
ington.
"The stats speak for themselves," Elway said.
"Seven interceptions, lots of passes broken up,
lots of dropped passes. . . . They were tackling
better than they had been, and the defense was a lot
more physical."
On offense, running back Brad Muster returned
to his 1986 Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year
form with 159 yards and two touchdowns on 20
carries, while quarterback Brian Johnson finished
13-of-22 for 193 yards and three touchdowns.
Punt returner Alan Grant is first in the nation
with 19.05 yards per return. Punter Doug Robison
still ranks third nationally with an average of 45.5
yards per punt.
