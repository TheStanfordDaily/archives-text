# Humphreys a Card thief
## 
### Scott Roth Staff writer 
Inventor Thomas Edison said
that genius is I percent inspira
tion and 99 percent perspiration.
Had Edison been a football
coach, senior strong safety Brad
Humphreys would be his ideal
player.
Humphreys, once overshad
owed in the Stanford secondary
bv the likes of Toi Cook and Walt
Harris — both graduated now —
has used his considerable athletic
talents and a frightening amount
of dedication and hard work to
become one of the Pacific 10
Conference's best defensive
backs and a bona fide pro
prospect.
"Brad has not taken a shortcut

all year. As a coach, you want to
see someone who has a good atti
tude and is willing to go the extra
mile to get the job done, " Stan
ford defensive secondary coach
Sonny Lubick said. "He has
been doing everything well and
has become the centerpiece of
our backfield."
For Humphreys, a 6-foot-3,
200-pound native of Saratoga,
diligence on the practice field is
just something that carries over
from coaching and desire.
"Each year I have tried to im
prove all aspects of my game.
The coaches spend a lot of time
teaching us, and I feel that I owe
them the best effort I can put
out," Humphreys said.
Humphreys' efforts have not
been in vain. Going into Satur

day's contest against California,
Humphreys leads the Cardinal
secondary with six interceptions,
including two swipes in Satur
day's romp at Oregon State. Not
content to be ordinary,
Humphreys doesn't just try to
pick off errant passes — he wants
to make interceptions happen.
Just about every big play
Humphreys has made this season
would impress both Houdini and
Baryshnikov. He has developed
a reputation for coming down
with balls in a crowd and for
yanking in errant throws with
one hand. But to hear him tell it,
Humphreys considers his acro
batic maneuvers just, well, ordi
nary.
"Our coaches always tell us to
hustle, to fly to the ball and to go
for it. Any balls 1 get are just
rewards for working hard. Also, I
have to credit my teammates.
Many of my picks (interceptions)
have come from tipped balls and
deflections. That's just good
teamwork," Humphreys said.
Modesty aside, Humphreys
has been the clutch man for Stan
ford all season. According to
Lubick, Humphreys is "Mr. De
pendable."
"Brad is having a fine year. He
has been getting better and better
for about the last five weeks. He
plays the run well, and he is a
sure tackier. We have a great
deal of confidence in him,"
Lubick said.
Lubick also explained why
Humphreys is able to come up
with the big play. He said that
Humphreys is an excellent stu
dent of his opponents. "Brad
watches a lot of film and mentally
knows what's coming. After that,
his athletic ability takes over."
Being the oldest member of a
young secondary, one might ex
pect Humphreys to be the de
facto leader of the unit. But ac
cording to Humphreys, a surfer
in his spare time, his job is more
one of a director.
"I just try to make sure every
thing is right before the play —
that everyone is in the right place
and that everyone knows what
type of coverage we're in. Other
than that, I just try to work hard
and lead in that respect,"
Humphreys said. "I try to follow
the example that Walt (Harris)
set last year. He was a great com
municator. After all, you can't be
a good leader by just thinking
you're one."
For all of Humphreys' heroics
this season, it is no secret that
opposing quarterbacks have been
feeding on the Cardinal second
ary this year. Despite a Stanford
victory, San Diego State's Todd

Santos threw for over S(K) yards
against Humphreys and his
cohorts. Arizona and USC's
quarterbacks were also able to
make long bombs look run-of
the-mill. Despite the unpleasant
statistics, Humphreys is undis
turbed by the unit's apparent
problems.
"The losses this year have just
been one of those things," he
said. "I can't compare us to last
year, but the ability and the soul
is still with us. We just have not

been able to nut it all together
consistently, when we have, like
against Washington State or
Oregon State, look what can hap
pen. (Oregon State quarterback
Erik) Wilhelm was supposed to
be a hot QB, but we really shut
him down.
"It's just a matter of the of
fense and defense showing up at
the same time. I really feel that
we're playing well now. I wish

ceptions on the season.
we had five more games,"
Humphreys said.
Because of his play the past
two seasons, Humphreys has
been hearing from a few profes
sional scouts. Despite the strong
chance of being drafted next
April, the economics major
remains philosophical about his
chances of breaking into the
NFL.
"Right now, all the contact I
have had is just preliminary stuff,
and I cannot talk about it at this
point. But, if I get the chance, I'll
try my best to make it. I would
not want to look back in five
years and kick myself for not
having tried to break into the
NFL if I had the chance.
However, like most guys on the
Stanford team, we'll have our ed
ucation to fall back on. It's al
most a no-loss situation," he
said.
Lubick had difficulty evaluat
ing his player's NFL future. "As
a coach it's very hard to say.
Each scout is looking for differ
ent things, so I can't be entirely
sure which of Brad's talents are
going to apeal to a pro scout. All
coaches look for strong fun
damentals, agressi veness and

good physical prerequisites, but
past that it's really tough to fig
ure out. Despite all of this uncer
tainty, 1 feel that he has the basic
skills to get picked by a team."
As a senior, Humphreys will
be putting on the Cardinal and
White for the last time this Satur
day. Humphreys would like to
close out his Stanford career with
a big day against California.
"It's my last time here and it's
like our bowl game. We got em
barrassed up there last year. . . .
We came in too cocky about
going to the Gator Bowl and off
to Japan the following week.
That loss hurt us all deeply and
we all want to make up for it this
year," he said.
Stanford will get a break this
Saturday. Bear quarterback Troy
Taylor broke his finger late in
Cal's upset of Arizona State last
week; he is doubtful for the Big
Game. Many Stanford fans are
breathing a collective sigh ot
relief (Taylor has been on fire of
late, completing 21 of 28 passes
last week).
"I was really looking forward
to the challenge of playing
against him, but to me, it really
doesn't matter who plays. It may
be a cliche, but records and per
sonnel don't matter in the Big
Game. I just don't want to go out
on a losing note," Humphreys
said.

would impress both Houdini and
Baryshnikov. He has developed
a reputation for coming down
with balls in a crowd and for
yanking in errant throws with
one hand. But to hear him tell it,
Humphreys considers his acro
batic maneuvers just, well, ordi
nary.
"Our coaches always tell us to
hustle, to fly to the ball and to go
for it. Any balls 1 get are just
rewards for working hard. Also, I
have to credit my teammates.
Many of my picks (interceptions)
have come from tipped balls and
deflections. That's just good
teamwork," Humphreys said.
Modesty aside, Humphreys
has been the clutch man for Stan
ford all season. According to
Lubick, Humphreys is "Mr. De
pendable."
"Brad is having a fine year. He
has been getting better and better
for about the last five weeks. He
plays the run well, and he is a
sure tackier. We have a great
deal of confidence in him,"
Lubick said.
Lubick also explained why
Humphreys is able to come up
with the big play. He said that
Humphreys is an excellent stu
dent of his opponents. "Brad
watches a lot of film and mentally
knows what's coming. After that,
his athletic ability takes over."
Being the oldest member of a
young secondary, one might ex
pect Humphreys to be the de
facto leader of the unit. But ac
cording to Humphreys, a surfer
in his spare time, his job is more
one of a director.
"I just try to make sure every
thing is right before the play —
that everyone is in the right place
and that everyone knows what
type of coverage we're in. Other
than that, I just try to work hard
and lead in that respect,"
Humphreys said. "I try to follow
the example that Walt (Harris)
set last year. He was a great com
municator. After all, you can't be
a good leader by just thinking
you're one."
For all of Humphreys' heroics
this season, it is no secret that
opposing quarterbacks have been
feeding on the Cardinal second
ary this year. Despite a Stanford
victory, San Diego State's Todd

Santos threw for over S(K) yards
against Humphreys and his
cohorts. Arizona and USC's
quarterbacks were also able to
make long bombs look run-of
the-mill. Despite the unpleasant
statistics, Humphreys is undis
turbed by the unit's apparent
problems.
"The losses this year have just
been one of those things," he
said. "I can't compare us to last
year, but the ability and the soul
is still with us. We just have not

been able to nut it all together
consistently, when we have, like
against Washington State or
Oregon State, look what can hap
pen. (Oregon State quarterback
Erik) Wilhelm was supposed to
be a hot QB, but we really shut
him down.
"It's just a matter of the of
fense and defense showing up at
the same time. I really feel that
we're playing well now. I wish

we had five more games,"
Humphreys said.
Because of his play the past
two seasons, Humphreys has
been hearing from a few profes
sional scouts. Despite the strong
chance of being drafted next
April, the economics major
remains philosophical about his
chances of breaking into the
NFL.
"Right now, all the contact I
have had is just preliminary stuff,
and I cannot talk about it at this
point. But, if I get the chance, I'll
try my best to make it. I would
not want to look back in five
years and kick myself for not
having tried to break into the
NFL if I had the chance.
However, like most guys on the
Stanford team, we'll have our ed
ucation to fall back on. It's al
most a no-loss situation," he
said.
Lubick had difficulty evaluat
ing his player's NFL future. "As
a coach it's very hard to say.
Each scout is looking for differ
ent things, so I can't be entirely
sure which of Brad's talents are
going to apeal to a pro scout. All
coaches look for strong fun
damentals, agressi veness and

good physical prerequisites, but
past that it's really tough to fig
ure out. Despite all of this uncer
tainty, 1 feel that he has the basic
skills to get picked by a team."
As a senior, Humphreys will
be putting on the Cardinal and
White for the last time this Satur
day. Humphreys would like to
close out his Stanford career with
a big day against California.
"It's my last time here and it's
like our bowl game. We got em
barrassed up there last year. . . .
We came in too cocky about
going to the Gator Bowl and off
to Japan the following week.
That loss hurt us all deeply and
we all want to make up for it this
year," he said.
Stanford will get a break this
Saturday. Bear quarterback Troy
Taylor broke his finger late in
Cal's upset of Arizona State last
week; he is doubtful for the Big
Game. Many Stanford fans are
breathing a collective sigh ot
relief (Taylor has been on fire of
late, completing 21 of 28 passes
last week).
"I was really looking forward
to the challenge of playing
against him, but to me, it really
doesn't matter who plays. It may
be a cliche, but records and per
sonnel don't matter in the Big
Game. I just don't want to go out
on a losing note," Humphreys
said.
Inventor Thomas Edison said
that genius is I percent inspira
tion and 99 percent perspiration.
Had Edison been a football
coach, senior strong safety Brad
Humphreys would be his ideal
player.
Humphreys, once overshad
owed in the Stanford secondary
bv the likes of Toi Cook and Walt
Harris — both graduated now —
has used his considerable athletic
talents and a frightening amount
of dedication and hard work to
become one of the Pacific 10
Conference's best defensive
backs and a bona fide pro
prospect.
"Brad has not taken a shortcut

all year. As a coach, you want to
see someone who has a good atti
tude and is willing to go the extra
mile to get the job done, " Stan
ford defensive secondary coach
Sonny Lubick said. "He has
been doing everything well and
has become the centerpiece of
our backfield."
For Humphreys, a 6-foot-3,
200-pound native of Saratoga,
diligence on the practice field is
just something that carries over
from coaching and desire.
"Each year I have tried to im
prove all aspects of my game.
The coaches spend a lot of time
teaching us, and I feel that I owe
them the best effort I can put
out," Humphreys said.
Humphreys' efforts have not
been in vain. Going into Satur

day's contest against California,
Humphreys leads the Cardinal
secondary with six interceptions,
including two swipes in Satur
day's romp at Oregon State. Not
content to be ordinary,
Humphreys doesn't just try to
pick off errant passes — he wants
to make interceptions happen.

type of coverage we're in. Other
than that, I just try to work hard
and lead in that respect,"
Humphreys said. "I try to follow
the example that Walt (Harris)
set last year. He was a great com
municator. After all, you can't be
a good leader by just thinking
you're one."
For all of Humphreys' heroics
this season, it is no secret that
opposing quarterbacks have been
feeding on the Cardinal second
ary this year. Despite a Stanford
victory, San Diego State's Todd

Santos threw for over S(K) yards
against Humphreys and his
cohorts. Arizona and USC's
quarterbacks were also able to
make long bombs look run-of
the-mill. Despite the unpleasant
statistics, Humphreys is undis
turbed by the unit's apparent
problems.
"The losses this year have just
been one of those things," he
said. "I can't compare us to last
year, but the ability and the soul
is still with us. We just have not

been able to nut it all together
consistently, when we have, like
against Washington State or
Oregon State, look what can hap
pen. (Oregon State quarterback
Erik) Wilhelm was supposed to
be a hot QB, but we really shut
him down.
"It's just a matter of the of
fense and defense showing up at
the same time. I really feel that
we're playing well now. I wish

we had five more games,"
Humphreys said.
Because of his play the past
two seasons, Humphreys has
been hearing from a few profes
sional scouts. Despite the strong
chance of being drafted next
April, the economics major
remains philosophical about his
chances of breaking into the
NFL.
"Right now, all the contact I
have had is just preliminary stuff,
and I cannot talk about it at this
point. But, if I get the chance, I'll
try my best to make it. I would
not want to look back in five
years and kick myself for not
having tried to break into the
NFL if I had the chance.
However, like most guys on the
Stanford team, we'll have our ed
ucation to fall back on. It's al
most a no-loss situation," he
said.
Lubick had difficulty evaluat
ing his player's NFL future. "As
a coach it's very hard to say.
Each scout is looking for differ
ent things, so I can't be entirely
sure which of Brad's talents are
going to apeal to a pro scout. All
coaches look for strong fun
damentals, agressi veness and

good physical prerequisites, but
past that it's really tough to fig
ure out. Despite all of this uncer
tainty, 1 feel that he has the basic
skills to get picked by a team."
As a senior, Humphreys will
be putting on the Cardinal and
White for the last time this Satur
day. Humphreys would like to
close out his Stanford career with
a big day against California.
"It's my last time here and it's
like our bowl game. We got em
barrassed up there last year. . . .
We came in too cocky about
going to the Gator Bowl and off
to Japan the following week.
That loss hurt us all deeply and
we all want to make up for it this
year," he said.
Stanford will get a break this
Saturday. Bear quarterback Troy
Taylor broke his finger late in
Cal's upset of Arizona State last
week; he is doubtful for the Big
Game. Many Stanford fans are
breathing a collective sigh ot
relief (Taylor has been on fire of
late, completing 21 of 28 passes
last week).
"I was really looking forward
to the challenge of playing
against him, but to me, it really
doesn't matter who plays. It may
be a cliche, but records and per
sonnel don't matter in the Big
Game. I just don't want to go out
on a losing note," Humphreys
said.
