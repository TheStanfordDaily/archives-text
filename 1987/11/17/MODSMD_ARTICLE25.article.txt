# Humphreys a Card thief
## 
### Scott Roth Staff writer 
Inventor Thomas Edison said
that genius is I percent inspira
tion and 99 percent perspiration.
Had Edison been a football
coach, senior strong safety Brad
Humphreys would be his ideal
player.
Humphreys, once overshad
owed in the Stanford secondary
bv the likes of Toi Cook and Walt
Harris — both graduated now —
has used his considerable athletic
talents and a frightening amount
of dedication and hard work to
become one of the Pacific 10
Conference's best defensive
backs and a bona fide pro
prospect.
"Brad has not taken a shortcut

all year. As a coach, you want to
see someone who has a good atti
tude and is willing to go the extra
mile to get the job done, " Stan
ford defensive secondary coach
Sonny Lubick said. "He has
been doing everything well and
has become the centerpiece of
our backfield."
For Humphreys, a 6-foot-3,
200-pound native of Saratoga,
diligence on the practice field is
just something that carries over
from coaching and desire.
"Each year I have tried to im
prove all aspects of my game.
The coaches spend a lot of time
teaching us, and I feel that I owe
them the best effort I can put
out," Humphreys said.
Humphreys' efforts have not
been in vain. Going into Satur

day's contest against California,
Humphreys leads the Cardinal
secondary with six interceptions,
including two swipes in Satur
day's romp at Oregon State. Not
content to be ordinary,
Humphreys doesn't just try to
pick off errant passes — he wants
to make interceptions happen.
Just about every big play
Humphreys has made this season
would impress both Houdini and
Baryshnikov. He has developed
a reputation for coming down
with balls in a crowd and for
yanking in errant throws with
one hand. But to hear him tell it,
Humphreys considers his acro
batic maneuvers just, well, ordi
nary.
