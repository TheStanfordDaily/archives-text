Rick Lancaster may not be as well-known as
Jack Elway, Brad Muster and some of the other
luminaries involved in Big Game, but his hand
iwork will be on display all around Stanford
Stadium this Saturday.

As an assistant equipment manager,
Lancaster is responsible for the array of gear the
Cardinal will tote on the field, and as a budding
artist, he claims credit for the cover of this
year's Big Game program.
While the combination of equipment man and
artist may seem a bit incongruous, Lancaster has

a degree in graphic art and spent his summers
working for Jim Davis Enterprises, an athletic
equipment reconditioner in San Mateo.
"Being around athletics is kind of like painting

the Golden Gate Bridge, because the job is never
done," he said. "There's always another season
just around the corner."
Both his avocations spring from hobbies he
picked up as a youngster. Lancaster has long
been interested in sports and played high school
football in his native San Mateo. He learned
drawing at the knee of his father, a self-taught
artist.
"My dad used to draw things and I'd copy
them," he said. "The times I spent doing that
with him were real special."
Lancaster and his father would also take the
train down the Peninsula for Stanford football
games. "Those were special Saturdays," he
said. "It's nice to be part of that history."
History is an important aspect of Lancaster's
art, and this year's Big Game program cover
reflects his admiration for bygone days. It
features a California and Stanford player in turn
of-the-century garb, and if one overlooked the
date, it could be mistaken for a poster advertis
ing the ninth Big Game rather than the 9()th.
"I like that old-time era," Lancaster said.
"People back then took a little more time to do
things. The era that 1 look at is the turn of the
