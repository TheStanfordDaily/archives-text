Rick Lancaster may not be as well-known as
Jack Elway, Brad Muster and some of the other
luminaries involved in Big Game, but his hand
iwork will be on display all around Stanford
Stadium this Saturday.

As an assistant equipment manager,
Lancaster is responsible for the array of gear the
Cardinal will tote on the field, and as a budding
artist, he claims credit for the cover of this
year's Big Game program.
While the combination of equipment man and
artist may seem a bit incongruous, Lancaster has
the perfect resume for his dual role.
He graduated from San Jose State in 1979 with
a degree in graphic art and spent his summers
working for Jim Davis Enterprises, an athletic
equipment reconditioner in San Mateo.
"Being around athletics is kind of like painting

the Golden Gate Bridge, because the job is never
done," he said. "There's always another season
just around the corner."
Both his avocations spring from hobbies he
picked up as a youngster. Lancaster has long
been interested in sports and played high school
football in his native San Mateo. He learned
drawing at the knee of his father, a self-taught
artist.
"My dad used to draw things and I'd copy
them," he said. "The times I spent doing that
with him were real special."
Lancaster and his father would also take the
train down the Peninsula for Stanford football
games. "Those were special Saturdays," he
said. "It's nice to be part of that history."
History is an important aspect of Lancaster's
art, and this year's Big Game program cover
reflects his admiration for bygone days. It
features a California and Stanford player in turn
of-the-century garb, and if one overlooked the
date, it could be mistaken for a poster advertis
ing the ninth Big Game rather than the 9()th.
"I like that old-time era," Lancaster said.
"People back then took a little more time to do
things. The era that 1 look at is the turn of the

century and the advertising art of
that time. Every piece that was
produced back then seemed to
have its own special look."
Lancaster, who uses watered
down watercolor to give his
pictures an aura of age, said,
" I here's a lot of nice old artwork
that represents Big Game, but I
didn't have anything particular in
mind when I did my work. I just
tried to make it a special design
to represent a very special
rivalry."
Lancaster has looked at histor
ical photos of Stanford football in
order to make his work as realis
tic as possible. "1 think the
depiction is fairly accurate to the
era," he said.
I he Big Game cover is not
Lancaster's first work of period
piece art. He also did last year's

Stanford baseball poster and pro
gram cover. In addition,
Lancaster created the more
modern-looking posters for the
Apple Basketball Classic and last
year's women's basketball pos
ter.
While Lancaster had become a
sort of Athletic Department
artist-in-residence, it was an old
friend from San Jose State who
got him hooked up with Touch
down Publications, the San
Francisco-based firm that pub
lishes the Stanford programs.
Joe Dearborn, an advertising
man in the Touchdown offices,
brought Lancaster to the atten
tion ot the Touchdown people,
and they liked what they saw of a
pencil mock-up of the Big Game
program.
"They've had a lot of trouble
recently with ideas that show the
tradition and rivalry," Lancaster
said. "I thought the old-time look
would bring out the tradition."
Lancaster reported that his

various commissions have kept
him as busy as he's ever been in
art. He hopes to translate an in
terest in the art of the American
West into commercial success,
but in the meantime, he's happy
at Stanford.
' The thing I like most about
being an equipment man is not
equipment but Stanford and the
people I'm around," Lancaster
said. "There are some real spe
cial people here. I can honestly
say I've never had a problem
with any of our athletes. I feel
like I've had a nice relationship
with them."
Lancaster uses the word
"special'' frequently when he
talks, and the term probably best
applies to Lancaster himself. A
genuinely nice guy, he's univer
sally liked and artistically
talented as well. A lot of
pageantry surrounds Big Game,
and Lancaster is one of those
people who will make this year's
game a truly "special" event.

being an equipment man is not
equipment but Stanford and the
people I'm around," Lancaster
said. "There are some real spe
cial people here. I can honestly
say I've never had a problem
with any of our athletes. I feel
like I've had a nice relationship
with them."
Lancaster uses the word
"special'' frequently when he
talks, and the term probably best
applies to Lancaster himself. A
genuinely nice guy, he's univer
sally liked and artistically
talented as well. A lot of
pageantry surrounds Big Game,
and Lancaster is one of those
people who will make this year's
game a truly "special" event.
Rick Lancaster may not be as well-known as
Jack Elway, Brad Muster and some of the other
luminaries involved in Big Game, but his hand
iwork will be on display all around Stanford
Stadium this Saturday.

As an assistant equipment manager,
Lancaster is responsible for the array of gear the
Cardinal will tote on the field, and as a budding
artist, he claims credit for the cover of this
year's Big Game program.
While the combination of equipment man and
artist may seem a bit incongruous, Lancaster has
the perfect resume for his dual role.
He graduated from San Jose State in 1979 with
a degree in graphic art and spent his summers
working for Jim Davis Enterprises, an athletic
equipment reconditioner in San Mateo.
"Being around athletics is kind of like painting

the Golden Gate Bridge, because the job is never
done," he said. "There's always another season
just around the corner."
Both his avocations spring from hobbies he
picked up as a youngster. Lancaster has long
been interested in sports and played high school
football in his native San Mateo. He learned
drawing at the knee of his father, a self-taught
artist.
"My dad used to draw things and I'd copy
them," he said. "The times I spent doing that
with him were real special."
Lancaster and his father would also take the
train down the Peninsula for Stanford football
games. "Those were special Saturdays," he
said. "It's nice to be part of that history."
History is an important aspect of Lancaster's
art, and this year's Big Game program cover
reflects his admiration for bygone days. It
features a California and Stanford player in turn
of-the-century garb, and if one overlooked the
date, it could be mistaken for a poster advertis
ing the ninth Big Game rather than the 9()th.
"I like that old-time era," Lancaster said.
"People back then took a little more time to do
things. The era that 1 look at is the turn of the

century and the advertising art of
that time. Every piece that was
produced back then seemed to
have its own special look."
Lancaster, who uses watered
down watercolor to give his
pictures an aura of age, said,
" I here's a lot of nice old artwork
that represents Big Game, but I
didn't have anything particular in
mind when I did my work. I just
tried to make it a special design
to represent a very special
rivalry."
Lancaster has looked at histor
ical photos of Stanford football in
order to make his work as realis
tic as possible. "1 think the
depiction is fairly accurate to the
era," he said.
I he Big Game cover is not
Lancaster's first work of period
piece art. He also did last year's

Stanford baseball poster and pro
gram cover. In addition,
Lancaster created the more
modern-looking posters for the
Apple Basketball Classic and last
year's women's basketball pos
ter.
While Lancaster had become a
sort of Athletic Department
artist-in-residence, it was an old
friend from San Jose State who
got him hooked up with Touch
down Publications, the San
Francisco-based firm that pub
lishes the Stanford programs.
Joe Dearborn, an advertising
man in the Touchdown offices,
brought Lancaster to the atten
tion ot the Touchdown people,
and they liked what they saw of a
pencil mock-up of the Big Game
program.
"They've had a lot of trouble
recently with ideas that show the
tradition and rivalry," Lancaster
said. "I thought the old-time look
would bring out the tradition."
Lancaster reported that his

various commissions have kept
him as busy as he's ever been in
art. He hopes to translate an in
terest in the art of the American
West into commercial success,
but in the meantime, he's happy
at Stanford.
