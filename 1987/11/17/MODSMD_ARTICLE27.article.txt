# Returner Grant tops in nation
## 
### Cameron Macky 
To most people, returning
punts probably seems only
slightly less dangerous than
driving north in the southbound
lane of the Bayshore Freeway.
Think about it: the returner
waits, all alone, for the ball to
come down to him, all the while
knowing that somewhere upfield
there are 11 players who have
nothing better to do than sepa
rate the unfortunate receiver
from his senses. This is no place
for the meek.
It is, however, an excellent
place for Alan Grant.
Grant, a junior on the Stanford
football team, has found a home
at the punt returner position. In
his first year returning kicks, he
is leading the nation in yards per
return, and his 19.05-yard
average will destroy the Stanford
single-season record of 14.2, set
by Phil Moffatt in 1973. With 4(H)
yards on 21 returns, he will also
break Stanford's single-season
yardage record if he picks up 73
more yards against California
Saturday.
In his latest outing, at Oregon
State last Saturday, Grant set up

the Cardinal's second touchdown
with a 63-yard return early in the
second quarter. The 63-yarder,
his third-longest of the year, was
the latest in a string of long
returns that have become Grant's
trademark. He has also had
returns of 61, 69, and 77 yards,
the latter two for touchdowns.
Grant downplays the danger of
his occupation. "When you're
out there, it doesn't feel quite as
dangerous," Grant said.
"You've got to have a lot of faith
in the guys who are blocking for
you. If the guys are doing a good
job, then that kind of takes away
the fear aspect."
The return team's blockers
have played a large role in
Grant's success this season, and
he is quick to give them credit.
"We've done well because it's
been a group effort. AH 11 guys
really get into it.(The returns
are] a credit to the entire punt
return team," he said. "1 get the
headlines, but the guys blocking
for me really make it happen."
Stanford assistant coach Larry
Kerr, who coaches the special
teams, agrees. "The guys do a
great job, holding the line of
scrimmage and throwing

blocks," Kerr said. "Rob
Englehardt does a great job pick
ing up the first man downfield.
Its a whole unit working to
gether. And then Alan takes
over. He's got great speed, and
he also makes tacklers miss.
"That's the sign of a good
return man: he has to make
somebody miss, because not
everybody is going to get
blocked."
Grant's speed was developed
as a running back at St. Francis
High School in Pasadena, where
he rushed for 1450 yards his
senior year. In fact, Stanford was
the only school that did not
recruit Grant as a running back,
forcing him to learn the new posi
tion of cornerback during his
freshman year. Since that first
season, when he was redshirted,
he has started every game for the
Cardinal at cornerback except
the 1986 Gator Bowl, which he
missed with an injury.
It was near the end of last
season that Grant got his first
chance to return punts, when
regular returner Thomas Henley
was hurt. "1 was Thomas'
backup, and I returned a couple
times against Arizona and Cal,"

Grant said. "It was my first op
portunity to touch the ball, and I
kind of liked it."
He has turned that opportunity
into a potent offensive threat.
Several times this season Grant
has broken long returns when the
opposing team has had him
hemmed in and expected a fair
catch. Grant sees no need for this
tactic. "They've got to give me
two yards to catch the ball, and
the only way I'll get hit is it
someone times it perfectly. I
guess 1 won't (fair catch) again.
That's just fine with Kerr.
"We try to be aggressive in our
stance when it comes to fair
catching," Kerr said. "If he's
comfortable not fair-catching,
it's up to him.''
Returning punts has allowed
Grant to have an impact on the
team, which is what he would
like to do more on defense. "I
want to get more involved," he
said. "I've been involved in the
outcomes of games, but it hasn't
been positive. 1 really want that
to change."
Despite the fact that corner
back is still a relatively new posi

tion for him, Grant feels the time
will come when he will be com
fortable there. "My run defense
has improved a lot. My pass
defense hasn't been what I'd like
it to be, (but) I've seen a lot of
progress. There's a kind of men

tality, an attitude that goes with
being a cornerback, and I think
I'm starting to get it."
No matter how he fares on
defense, his position on the spe
cial teams is secure. "As far as
returners go, he's definitely up
there with the best of them,"
Kerr said. "Thomas Henley was
a great returner, but Alan has
come up with some even bigger
plays (than Henley did)."

He has turned that opportunity
into a potent offensive threat.
Several times this season Grant
has broken long returns when the
opposing team has had him
hemmed in and expected a fair
catch. Grant sees no need for this
tactic. "They've got to give me
two yards to catch the ball, and
the only way I'll get hit is it
someone times it perfectly. I
guess 1 won't (fair catch) again.
That's just fine with Kerr.
"We try to be aggressive in our
stance when it comes to fair
catching," Kerr said. "If he's
comfortable not fair-catching,
it's up to him.''
Returning punts has allowed
Grant to have an impact on the
team, which is what he would
like to do more on defense. "I
want to get more involved," he
said. "I've been involved in the
outcomes of games, but it hasn't
been positive. 1 really want that
to change."
Despite the fact that corner

tion for him, Grant feels the time
will come when he will be com
fortable there. "My run defense
has improved a lot. My pass
defense hasn't been what I'd like
it to be, (but) I've seen a lot of
progress. There's a kind of men

tality, an attitude that goes with
being a cornerback, and I think
I'm starting to get it."
No matter how he fares on
defense, his position on the spe
cial teams is secure. "As far as
returners go, he's definitely up
there with the best of them,"
Kerr said. "Thomas Henley was
a great returner, but Alan has
come up with some even bigger
plays (than Henley did)."
To most people, returning
punts probably seems only
slightly less dangerous than
driving north in the southbound
lane of the Bayshore Freeway.
Think about it: the returner
waits, all alone, for the ball to
come down to him, all the while
knowing that somewhere upfield
there are 11 players who have
nothing better to do than sepa
rate the unfortunate receiver
from his senses. This is no place
for the meek.
It is, however, an excellent
place for Alan Grant.
Grant, a junior on the Stanford
football team, has found a home
at the punt returner position. In
his first year returning kicks, he
is leading the nation in yards per
return, and his 19.05-yard
average will destroy the Stanford
single-season record of 14.2, set
by Phil Moffatt in 1973. With 4(H)
yards on 21 returns, he will also
break Stanford's single-season
yardage record if he picks up 73
more yards against California
Saturday.
In his latest outing, at Oregon
State last Saturday, Grant set up

the Cardinal's second touchdown
with a 63-yard return early in the
second quarter. The 63-yarder,
his third-longest of the year, was
the latest in a string of long
returns that have become Grant's
trademark. He has also had
returns of 61, 69, and 77 yards,
the latter two for touchdowns.
Grant downplays the danger of
his occupation. "When you're
out there, it doesn't feel quite as
dangerous," Grant said.
"You've got to have a lot of faith
in the guys who are blocking for
you. If the guys are doing a good
job, then that kind of takes away
the fear aspect."
The return team's blockers
have played a large role in
Grant's success this season, and
he is quick to give them credit.
"We've done well because it's
been a group effort. AH 11 guys
really get into it.(The returns
are] a credit to the entire punt
return team," he said. "1 get the
headlines, but the guys blocking
for me really make it happen."
Stanford assistant coach Larry
Kerr, who coaches the special
teams, agrees. "The guys do a
great job, holding the line of
scrimmage and throwing

blocks," Kerr said. "Rob
Englehardt does a great job pick
ing up the first man downfield.
Its a whole unit working to
gether. And then Alan takes
over. He's got great speed, and
he also makes tacklers miss.
"That's the sign of a good
return man: he has to make
somebody miss, because not
everybody is going to get
blocked."
Grant's speed was developed
as a running back at St. Francis
High School in Pasadena, where
he rushed for 1450 yards his
senior year. In fact, Stanford was
the only school that did not
recruit Grant as a running back,
forcing him to learn the new posi
tion of cornerback during his
freshman year. Since that first
season, when he was redshirted,
he has started every game for the
Cardinal at cornerback except
the 1986 Gator Bowl, which he
missed with an injury.
It was near the end of last
season that Grant got his first
chance to return punts, when
regular returner Thomas Henley
was hurt. "1 was Thomas'
backup, and I returned a couple
times against Arizona and Cal,"

Grant said. "It was my first op
portunity to touch the ball, and I
kind of liked it."
He has turned that opportunity
