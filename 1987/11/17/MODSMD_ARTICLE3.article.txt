# Polls open today for student elections
## 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
Students will go to the polls
today and tomorrow to elect
three candidates to the Student
Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) and as many as 13 gradu
ate students to the ASSU Senate.
Students will also decide the fate
of two constitutional amend
ments proposed by the ASSU.
One constitutional amendment
on the ballot would allow the
ASSU to collect "capital fees."
This refundable fee of $1 or $2
per student would allow the
ASSU to fund major improve
ment projects — such as renova
tion of the Old Firehouse or
reconstruction of the Boathouse
— over a number of years, said
Council of Presidents member
Leonard Adler.
COP member Jim Durkin said
the fees would "expand the

scope of things that can be
done."
Similar amendments seeking to
give the ASSU the power to col
lect capital fees have been
defeated in student elections the
past two years.
The other amendment that stu
dents will consider aims to in
crease the flexibility of spring
quarter general elections by al
lowing balloting to be scheduled
within a four-week period instead
of the current two-week span.
Some students last spring ob
jected to election scheduling that
conflicted with Easter and Pass
over.
"This (amendment) should
avoid the religious conflicts of
last year," Durkin said.
If approved by a two-thirds
majority of voting students, the
two constitutional amendments
will be presented to University
President Donald Kennedy for

approval.
The SCLC, a four-member
council that meets quarterly to
review cases of student miscon
duct, presently has three vacant
seats.
All students may vote for three
of the five SCLC candidates:
Howard Finkelstein, an un
declared sophomore; Laurence
Gordon, a junior majoring in
English; Valerie Huang, a senior
majoring in East Asian studies;
Steven Krauss, a freshman; and
Cindy Wurtenberg, a junior
majoring in psychology.
Only graduate students will be
allowed to cast votes for gradu
ate senators. They will be able to
vote for nine candidates running
for 13 seats.
Write-in votes for the SCLC
and graduate senate seats are
"highly encouraged,'" according
to the ASSU election handbook.
This week's election will intro

duce the use of automatic voting
machines rented from Santa
Clara County. The ASSU hopes
the machines will promote effi
ciency and ensure accuracy.
The election will cost about
$9000, including about $5300 for
use of the voting machines.
Senators and some students
have expressed discontent over
the high cost of the election. But
many members of the ASSU, like
Administrative Manager Jack Ot
toway, view the machines as "a
long-term investment that will be
worth it in the long run."
Although special elections
have generally experienced low
voter turnout. Senate Chair Dave
Smolen said he was optimistic.
"1 think there's going to be a
definite curiosity factor (from the
voting machines)," Smolen said.
"I see [the turnout) being higher
than past special elections."
