# Fewer graduates would earn distinction award under plan
## 
### Rob Burwell 
The number of students
graduating with distinction each
year will drop by an average of
about five dozen if the University
approves new standards recently
proposed by the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA).
Earlier this quarter the C-AAA
recommended a new University
wide graduation with distinction
policy to the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies and to the
deans of the University's
schools, according to English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz, a C-AAA
member.
The proposed policy states
that graduation with distinction
would be awarded to students
who graduate in both the top 20
percent of their class and the top
20 percent of students in their
maior.
A committee study estimated
that if such a University-wide
standard were to be adopted this
year, with a grade-point standard
of 3.6, 57 fewer students would
receive distinction than last year.
Under the current policy,
about 25 percent of Stanford
graduates earn distinction

honors, which are based soley on
departmental recommendations,
according to the study.
Under the new policy, depart
ments would still have the power
to nominate a small percentage of
students whom they consider
worthy of graduation with dis
tinction but who would not other
wise qualify.
Graduating with "distinction'
is different from graduating with
"honors": Distinction is a Uni
versity honor based on depart
mental recommendation, while
honors is a departmental award
usually given to students who
complete a senior thesis or proj
ect.
Rebholz said that the recom
mendation aims to bring a sense
of consistency back to the award.
"Distinction is an award given
by the University," he said.
"Right now, however, there is no
consistent policy; each depart
ment has its own varying ap
proach to the award. The new
policy would set guidelines and
make distinction a University
award again."
The committee also con
cluded, based on its statistical
findings, that the greatest reduc
tions in awards would be in the

School of Earth Sciences and in
the social sciences. Natural
sciences would gain slightly; the
percentage of students earning
humanities distinction would
remain about the same.
Rebholz said he thought the
award was losing meaning.
"There was some concern that
25 percent of graduates earning
distinction was a little too
many. . . . Now, we think that
between 20 and 22 percent will
earn the honor," he said.
Roger Kim, a student on the
committee, said the new policy is
more fair to students.
"Stanford really can't do it by
department. Each department's
grading is different," Kim said.
"If it was just by department, it
wouldn't mean much."
Kim also stressed the commit
tee's concern that too many
people were earning distinction.
"If too many people earn the
award, it isn't as praiseworthy,"
he said.
Rebholz said there were no re
actions at the C-AAA meeting
when the recommendations were
made. "I'm surprised that no one
responded. Maybe the earth
sciences representatives weren't
at the meeting," he said.
