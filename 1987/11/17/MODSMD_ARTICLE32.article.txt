# Nicaraguan supporter blasts contras, praises Sandinistas

### Sherrell Evans 
The Nicaraguan rebels — or
"contras" — are mercenaries
and have no support from the
people of Nicaragua, according
to a representative of an organi
zation formed to help promote
development in the war-torn
Central American country.
Fred Colgan, one of the Palo
Alto-area coordinators of Ar
chitects and Planners in Sup
port of Nicaragua (APSNICA),
addressed the war between the
contras and the Sandinista gov
ernment last night at the Bech
tel International Center during
a slide show and presentation
on the organization's construc
tion projects in Nicaragua.
APSNICA is a grass roots
development organization
formed in 1983 with the
motto,"Help Build Not De
stroy in Nicaragua." The or
ganization's goals are to build
houses for people fleeing from
the isolated, war-torn coun
tryside and to train Nic
araguans in building skills, Col
gan said.

Working in north central
Nicaragua, the organization
helps in cooperative projects
that build communities of about
20 homes. The finished com
munities include a school, a
water system and a garden.
The slide show explained the
history of Nicaragua and the
troubles that have brought its
present problems. The 1979
revolution that overthrew dic
tator Anastasio Somosa, who
tied the country with more than
10 times the wealth that
Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos took from his country,
severely aggravated existing
poverty problems, Colgan said.
According to Colgan, the an
nual per capita income today is
$200, and the contra war,
which Colgan said is led by
Somosa supporters, continues
to strain the welfare resources
of the Sandinista government.
APSNICA fully supports the
Sandinista government, he
said. "They're aware of the
problems. They're trying to
help, but first the war must
stop," Colgan said. " The eon
tras are a mercenary army paid

for by the CIA — they have no
popular support in Nicaragua.
Also, most supporters of
U.S. aid to the contras have not
actually spent time in Nic
aragua, he said.
The slide show. Colgan said,
highlighted four programs the
Sandinista government has
been able to carry out despite
the war:
• Health care. Nicaragua used
to have the highest infant mor
tality rate in the Western Hemi
sphere before health care
reforms were enacted, Colgan
said.
• Education. Nicaragua had an
illiteracy rate of 90 percent un
til the 19X0 Year of Literacy
Program, which decreased il
literacy to 13 percent within a
year, he said.
• Land reform. Land once
owned by a few wealthy sup
porters of Somosa has been
redistributed to the poor, he
said.
• Housing. "The one they have
had the most problem in
delivering" is housing, said
Colgan.
