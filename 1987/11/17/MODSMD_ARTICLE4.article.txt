# Endowment fares well despite losses
## 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
Despite losses incurred in the
recent stock market crash, Stan
ford's endowment has grown by
over 10 percent this year,
meeting projections made a year
ago, according to William Massy,
vice president for Business and
Finance.
In a report presented on
Massy's behalf by Vice President
and Provost James Rosse, the
Faculty Senate was assured that
despite a significant "paper loss"
that wiped out gains made earlier
in the year, the endowment will
be well above last year's level
when Massy's office makes its
annual valuation of the fund at
the end of this month.
Since Oct. 19, when the Dow
Jones average plunged 508
points, there has been wide
spread speculation about the
health of Stanford's endowment,
which was valued at $1,547 bil
lion last year.
Immediately after the crash,
Massy estimated that the fund
lost $100 million, but upped his
estimate to $200 million — or 12
to 13 percent of the fund's total
value at the time — the next day.
Massy said the diversity of
Stanford's investments saved the
fund from a worse loss. Stan
ford's endowment is distributed
in many different countries

across various kinds of equity,
real estate and fixed income in
vestments. Such distribution
protects the fund from severe
loss during events like the Wall
Street crash.
Massy's report explains that
the stock market crash only
counteracted gains made earlier
in the year, leaving the endow
ment at a higher level this month
than it was at a year ago.
"In short, what has happened
between last November and this
November was that there was a
large creation of paper value,
very little of which we were able
to capture in terms of income or
assets," Massy said. "The mar
ket crash wiped out that paper in
crease and left us about as well
off this year as we expected to be
when we made last year's set of
plans."
The early gains were due to
what Massy called "an over
heated market" fed by foreign in
vestments and domestic op
timism. Since the crash has
brought overvalued stocks back
down, the coming months will
probably bring a slow revival in
the market, according to Massy.
In the coming year, Massy
said, the University may broaden
its portfolio to include more in
ternational investments, and will
try to improve its use of invest
ment information, in order to
make the endowment even more
profitable. Massy warned, how
ever, that such investments are
inherently risky.
"You just can't predict when
something like last month's
crunch will happen," he said.
"Shifting funds around from one
investment to another frequently
to avoid problems just doesn't
pay off."
If the market crash had not oc
curred, Massy said, Stanford
stood to realize a 30-percent
growth rate this year.
Stanford's endowment is mea
sured each November in prepara
tion for the following year's
budget process. The endowment
feeds the University's yearly
budget with a 4.75 percent
payout rate, in the same way a
mutual fund provides sharehold
ers with an annual dividend.
