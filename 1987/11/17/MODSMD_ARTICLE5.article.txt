# Faculty survey shows Democratic majority
## Concludes Hoover is less partisan 
### kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
One-third of the Hoover Insti
tution's fellows and curates are
registered Democrats, compared
with three-fourths of the Stan
ford faculty at large, according to
a study released yesterday by
Hoover Research Fellow George
Marotta.
Marotta said the study shows
that Hoover scholars are a more
bipartisan group than the Univer
sity faculty, discounting charges
by some faculty members that
Hoover has an overwhelmingly
conservative orientation.
The survey, which sampled all
Hoover scholars and about one
fourth of the Stanford faculty in
10 departments, showed that 34
percent of the Hoover fellows
were registered Democrats,
compared with 93 percent of the
faculty in English, 88 percent in
sociology, 85 percent in history
and political science, and 46 per
cent in the Graduate School of
Business.
But two political science fac
ulty members questioned the
conclusions of the study, assert
ing that party identification has

little to do with political ideol
ogy.
"Through one-party identifica
tion you cannot infer anything
about ideology,'' Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley said,
joking that "the analysis would
get a C-minus in most courses."
Marotta released a preliminary
study of University partisanship
in June, in the wake of Stanford's
loss of the Reagan Library, and
completed his research last
month.
"Underneath all the rhetoric
(concerning the loss of the
Reagan Library), I thought the
partisan accusations might have
been the cause." Marotta said.
Marotta speculated that fac
ulty members such as Manley
and English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz, who have continually
opposed what they said were
Hoover's conservative politics,
accuse the institution of being
partisan simply because they are
intolerant of views more conser
vative than their own.
Marotta said he was hopeful
that his survey would show that
"everything's relative"' â€” that
