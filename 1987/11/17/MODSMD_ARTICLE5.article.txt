# Faculty survey shows Democratic majority
## Concludes Hoover is less partisan 
### kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
One-third of the Hoover Insti
tution's fellows and curates are
registered Democrats, compared
with three-fourths of the Stan
ford faculty at large, according to
a study released yesterday by
Hoover Research Fellow George
Marotta.
Marotta said the study shows
that Hoover scholars are a more
bipartisan group than the Univer
sity faculty, discounting charges
by some faculty members that
Hoover has an overwhelmingly
conservative orientation.
The survey, which sampled all
Hoover scholars and about one
fourth of the Stanford faculty in
10 departments, showed that 34
percent of the Hoover fellows
were registered Democrats,
compared with 93 percent of the
faculty in English, 88 percent in
sociology, 85 percent in history
and political science, and 46 per
cent in the Graduate School of
Business.
But two political science fac
ulty members questioned the
conclusions of the study, assert
ing that party identification has

little to do with political ideol
ogy.
"Through one-party identifica
tion you cannot infer anything
about ideology,'' Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley said,
joking that "the analysis would
get a C-minus in most courses."
Marotta released a preliminary
study of University partisanship
in June, in the wake of Stanford's
loss of the Reagan Library, and
completed his research last
month.
"Underneath all the rhetoric
(concerning the loss of the
Reagan Library), I thought the
partisan accusations might have
been the cause." Marotta said.
Marotta speculated that fac
ulty members such as Manley
and English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz, who have continually
opposed what they said were
Hoover's conservative politics,
accuse the institution of being
partisan simply because they are
intolerant of views more conser
vative than their own.
Marotta said he was hopeful
that his survey would show that
"everything's relative"' â€” that
the institution only looks conser
vative because of the liberal envi
ronment surrounding it.
Citing a 1987 Gallup poll indi
cating that 42 percent of
Americans were registered Dem
ocrats, Maratto emphasized that
while the percentage of Hoover
Democrats is 8 percent lower,
the percentage of Stanford fac
ulty members registered as Dem

ocrats is 32 percent higher than
the national average.
The Hoover Institution has
"been accused of being partisan,
and we turned out to be a little
more balanced" than the Demo
cratic faction at Stanford,
Maratto concluded from the per
centages.
Marotta said he hoped his re
search would lead to more
tolerance to points of view differ
ent from the Stanford liberal
norm.
Calling Marotta's survey "a
farce" that "compares apples

with oranges," Manley said the
survey "purports to compare
party identification of individual
members of the Political Science
Department with a hundred
million-dollar institution.
"The key thing is what Hoover
does and not how Hoover mem
bers vote," said Manley, who
also said that Marotta's analysis
"reduces the issue of Hoover's
political activities and puts the
spotlight on how they vote."
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody agreed that party identifi
cation tells little about ideology.

According to Brody, there "is a
wide variety of views about
policy" within the Democratic
Party. Throughout history, he
said, these views constantly shift
from liberal to ultra-con
servative.
But Brody called the debate
over party labels "silly," be
cause, he said, "the partisan di
mension is the wrong dimension
to study scholarship.
"The question is not about
politics. . . . The question is
about the quality of scholar
ship," Brody added.
