# Big Game week hoopla begins
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth 
Big Game festivities began
yesterday with a "Bearial" in
White Plaza, kicking off a week
of activities designed to "get
everybody stoked for Big
Game," according to Axe Com
mittee Chair Tom Smegal.
The Bearial featured the Band
and the traditional impalement of
a stuffed bear on the Claw.
About 75 people witnessed the
noontime event.
"Cal's Big Game events are
clearly inferior to Stanford's,"
Smegal said, adding that Stan
ford activities will continue today
with a Band rally at a "mystery
spot where they will be heard but
not seen."
Tomorrow's events will
feature the Second Annual Cal-
Stanford Sing-Off at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The pro

gram will include the Berkeley
Glee Club, Berkeley Men's Oc
tet, California Golden Overtones
and another Berkeley group
known as SWiG, pitting their
voices in friendly competition
against the» Stanford Glee Club,
Fleet Street Singers, Mendicants
and Mixed Company.
According to Smegal, Fleet
Street and the Men's Octet will
lead the crowd in a "back and
forth duel of school spirit songs"
during intermission.
Ram's Head will present the
1987 edition of Gaieties,
"Nightmare on Palm Street," on
Thursday at 7 p.m. and on Friday
at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Only the Fri
day late show is sold out.
Continuing a recently renewed
tradition, the Axe Committee
will present the Bonfire on
Thursday night. Construction of
the bontire, to be done mostly by

freshmen, will begin at 6 a.m.
Thursday, with residents of
Francos House drawing the first
shift.
Rob Eno, associate chair of the
Axe Committee and Bonfire co
director, said 10 telephone poles
and 4000 wooden pallets will be
used to construct the bonfire.
By contrast, Smegal said Cal
burns about 200 pallets in its an
nual Greek Theater bonfire,
which he said is more appropri
ately called a "campfire".
The bonfires of the past two
years have featured the tradi
tional slogan "Beat Cal" as well
as a figure of a bear. This year's
bonfire will also have some sort
of special adornment, but the
details will be kept secret until
the bonfire.
The Band will play all over

The master of ceremonies will be
Bob Murphy, who does color
commentary for KCBS broad
casts of Stanford basketball and
football games. Murphy, a Stan
ford alumnus who played both
sports here, "has forgotten more
about Stanford lore than most
people will ever know," Eno
said.
University President Donald
Kennedy will also speak, and
Fleet Street and the Band will
perform. Hal Mickelson, former

announcer for the Band, will
present the story of the Axe and
lead the crowd in the Axe Yell.
The fire is scheduled to be lit at
11:05 p.m., and the show will be
capped with a fireworks display.
The final pre-Big Game event
will be Cardinal and White Night
beginning at 9 p.m. Friday in
White Plaza. The alcohol-free
party will feature music by the
Stanford Band, the Uptones and
Merv Spiegel and the Penguins.
Smegal said he expects the
party, which replaces the tradi
tional San Francisco parade and
rally, to be an even bigger draw
for Stanford students than the
trip to the City. He added that
the alcohol ban will be strictly
enforced.

feature the Second Annual Cal-
Stanford Sing-Off at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The pro

gram will include the Berkeley
Glee Club, Berkeley Men's Oc
tet, California Golden Overtones
and another Berkeley group
known as SWiG, pitting their
voices in friendly competition
against the» Stanford Glee Club,
Fleet Street Singers, Mendicants
and Mixed Company.
According to Smegal, Fleet
Street and the Men's Octet will
lead the crowd in a "back and
forth duel of school spirit songs"
during intermission.
Ram's Head will present the
1987 edition of Gaieties,
"Nightmare on Palm Street," on
Thursday at 7 p.m. and on Friday
at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Only the Fri
day late show is sold out.
Continuing a recently renewed
tradition, the Axe Committee
will present the Bonfire on
Thursday night. Construction of
the bontire, to be done mostly by

freshmen, will begin at 6 a.m.
Thursday, with residents of
Francos House drawing the first
shift.
Rob Eno, associate chair of the
Axe Committee and Bonfire co
director, said 10 telephone poles
and 4000 wooden pallets will be
used to construct the bonfire.
By contrast, Smegal said Cal
burns about 200 pallets in its an
nual Greek Theater bonfire,
which he said is more appropri
ately called a "campfire".
The bonfires of the past two
years have featured the tradi
tional slogan "Beat Cal" as well
as a figure of a bear. This year's
bonfire will also have some sort
of special adornment, but the
details will be kept secret until
the bonfire.
The Band will play all over

At last year's Big Game at Berkeley, Axe Committee members carry the Axe during pregame activities
before it was lost to the Weenies. The football team will try to regain the lost trophy Saturday.
campus following Thursday
night's Gaieties performance and
arrive at the lake bed at 10 p.m.
The master of ceremonies will be
Bob Murphy, who does color
commentary for KCBS broad
casts of Stanford basketball and
football games. Murphy, a Stan
ford alumnus who played both
sports here, "has forgotten more
about Stanford lore than most
people will ever know," Eno
said.
University President Donald
Kennedy will also speak, and
Fleet Street and the Band will
perform. Hal Mickelson, former

announcer for the Band, will
present the story of the Axe and
lead the crowd in the Axe Yell.
The fire is scheduled to be lit at
11:05 p.m., and the show will be
capped with a fireworks display.
The final pre-Big Game event
will be Cardinal and White Night
beginning at 9 p.m. Friday in
White Plaza. The alcohol-free
party will feature music by the
Stanford Band, the Uptones and
Merv Spiegel and the Penguins.
Smegal said he expects the
party, which replaces the tradi
tional San Francisco parade and
rally, to be an even bigger draw
for Stanford students than the
trip to the City. He added that
the alcohol ban will be strictly
enforced.
