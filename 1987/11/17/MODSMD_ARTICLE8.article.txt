Pravda story urges parly discipline
MOSCOW — Kremlin conservatives, riding high following
the ouster of Boris Yeltsin as the Communist Party chief of
Moscow, voiced demands yesterday for greater party control
over elections to leading posts in factories and public organiza
tions.
A half-page article in Pravda, the party's most authoritative
newspaper, raised the question of whether "party democracy"
was diluting the idea of "party discipline." It said that many
workers were disappearing from their jobs to go to Moscow and
complain about shortcomings in the name of "perestroika," the
catcn-word for the reform program of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
Analysts said the hard-line Pravda article was an indirect at
tack on Yeltsin, who was dismissed last week as leader of the
Moscow party.
Yeltsin apparently also has been removed as non-voting mem
ber of the Politburo. Significantly, his name did not appear in a
list of all other Politburo members who signed an obituary for
Pyatras Grishkyavichus, first secretary of the Lithuanian Com
munist Party, who died Saturday at the age of 63.
A Western diplomat, who asked that his name not be used,
said that conservatives in the Kremlin leadership demanded
Yeltsin s dismissal after he accused Politburo member Yegor
Ligachev of slowing the pace of reform during an Oct. 21 speech
at a plenum of the party's Central Committee.
Thatcher asks U.S. to raise taxes
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher yesterday
called on U.S. policymakers to follow her example of raising
taxes when necessary to cut budget deficits and said such cuts
must be "sufficient to restore confidence, clearly and
decisively."
Noting that President Reagan and Congress "are still
negotiating" over the deficit, Thatcher implied they should
ignore "contradictory advice from their own economists,"
some of whom have warned that tax increases would lead to
recession.
Thatcher's comments, in a speech to leading financiers at the
annual banquet of the Lord Mayor of London, were the most
specific yet in a series of public statements over the past several
weeks urging the Reagan administration to take decisive action
to reduce the U.S. budget and trade deficits.
As Reagan's closest international ally and a fellow conserva
tive, Thatcher, according to her aides, has tried repeatedly over
the years to impress on him the need to balance the U.S. budget,
no matter what the short-term political cost. She and other allied
leaders have been closely following the intense negotiations in
Washington, which they see as crucial to reversing the interna
tional economic crisis that began with the Oct. 19 stock market
plunge.
Ortega asks Mexico for oil subsidies
MEXICO CITY — Nicaragua president Daniel Ortega ended
a surprise three-day visit here yesterday with a plea to his hosts
for economic aid and by insisting that future talks with U.S.-
backed Nicaraguan rebels be held in Washington.
Ortega met with Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid and
asked that a "formula" be found to permit the resumption of oil
deliveries from Mexico to cash-strapped Nicaragua. De la
Madrid suspended most oil sales to Nicaragua in 1985 because
Nicaragua failed to make payments on a $500-million debt to
Mexico.
Since then, the Marxist-led nation has relied mainly on the
Soviet Union for oil but has recently been trying to diversify its
sources following reports of Soviet reluctance to increase
deliveries.
A source close to de la Madrid said that although the Mexican
government would study ways to sell oil again to Nicaragua,
Mexico was "not in a position to give away" oil. "Nicaragua
has no money," the Mexican official said.
The source added that Ortega asked de la Madrid to encour
age Latin American governments to help Nicaragua pay its past
oil debts. The Nicaraguan government has been seeking Latin
aid not only to fill practical needs but as a show of political sup
port in the hemisphere. The presidents of eight Latin American
governments are scheduled to meet at the end of November in
the Mexican resort city of Acapulco.
Social Security issue inflames talks
WASHINGTON — Senior citizens' advocates delivered a
blunt warning yesterday to White House and congressional
negotiators not to tamper with Social Security, adding to politi
cal pressure that sent the two sides scurrying for other alterna
tives to cut the deficit.
Arthur Flemming, chairman of a coalition called Save Our Se
curity. told a hastily called Capitol Hill news conference that
"there will be political fallout" if Congress delays expected So
cial Security hikes.
The so-called "budget summit," now in its fourth week, con
tinued to focus on finding an additional savings of at least $2 bil
lion from federal entitlement programs. That appears to be the
only major stumbling block to an agreement by the Republican
White House and the Democratic-led Congress to reduce the
deficit by more than $30 billion.
But, as Friday's deadline for striking a deal approaches, the
quick mobilization of opposition to proposals for making those
final cuts demonstrates the basic reality of deficit-reduction
politics: Despite the shock from the stock market's crash
several weeks ago, it is far from clear that the public is willing to
accept the sacrifices that would be required to bring spending in
line with government revenues.
Howard Beach attacker identified
NEW YORK — A key prosecution witness in the Howard
Beach racial attack trial stood in court yesterday, dramatically
pointed to an 18-year-old defendant and charged that he was the
assailant who smashed his head with a baseball bat so severely it
took 66 stitches to close the wounds.
At one point during his testimony — perhaps the most power
ful in the more than month-long trial of four white youths
charged with murder and manslaughter — Cedric Sandiford told
how he clutched one end of a wooden baseball bat while an at
tacker he described as 5-foot-2, 130 pounds with blond hair, blue
eyes and round, red cheeks, held onto the other end of the
weapon.
"Look around the courtroom and see if you recognize that
person, ordered special New York state prosecutor Charles
Hynes.
"He's right there," Sandiford said, gesturing toward Jon
Lester, one of the defendants in the case that turned a quiet
Queens neighborhood into a national symbol of urban racial vio
lence after a gang of teenagers chased a black man into traffic on
a busy highway where he was struck and killed by an auto.

taxes when necessary to cut budget deficits and said such cuts
must be "sufficient to restore confidence, clearly and
decisively."
Noting that President Reagan and Congress "are still
negotiating" over the deficit, Thatcher implied they should
ignore "contradictory advice from their own economists,"
some of whom have warned that tax increases would lead to
recession.
Thatcher's comments, in a speech to leading financiers at the
annual banquet of the Lord Mayor of London, were the most
specific yet in a series of public statements over the past several
weeks urging the Reagan administration to take decisive action
to reduce the U.S. budget and trade deficits.
As Reagan's closest international ally and a fellow conserva
tive, Thatcher, according to her aides, has tried repeatedly over
the years to impress on him the need to balance the U.S. budget,
no matter what the short-term political cost. She and other allied
leaders have been closely following the intense negotiations in
Washington, which they see as crucial to reversing the interna
tional economic crisis that began with the Oct. 19 stock market
plunge.
Ortega asks Mexico for oil subsidies
MEXICO CITY — Nicaragua president Daniel Ortega ended
a surprise three-day visit here yesterday with a plea to his hosts
for economic aid and by insisting that future talks with U.S.-
backed Nicaraguan rebels be held in Washington.
Ortega met with Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid and
asked that a "formula" be found to permit the resumption of oil
deliveries from Mexico to cash-strapped Nicaragua. De la
Madrid suspended most oil sales to Nicaragua in 1985 because
Nicaragua failed to make payments on a $500-million debt to
Mexico.
Since then, the Marxist-led nation has relied mainly on the
Soviet Union for oil but has recently been trying to diversify its
sources following reports of Soviet reluctance to increase
deliveries.
A source close to de la Madrid said that although the Mexican
government would study ways to sell oil again to Nicaragua,
Mexico was "not in a position to give away" oil. "Nicaragua
has no money," the Mexican official said.
The source added that Ortega asked de la Madrid to encour
age Latin American governments to help Nicaragua pay its past
oil debts. The Nicaraguan government has been seeking Latin
aid not only to fill practical needs but as a show of political sup
port in the hemisphere. The presidents of eight Latin American
governments are scheduled to meet at the end of November in
the Mexican resort city of Acapulco.
Social Security issue inflames talks
WASHINGTON — Senior citizens' advocates delivered a
blunt warning yesterday to White House and congressional
negotiators not to tamper with Social Security, adding to politi
cal pressure that sent the two sides scurrying for other alterna
tives to cut the deficit.
Arthur Flemming, chairman of a coalition called Save Our Se
curity. told a hastily called Capitol Hill news conference that
"there will be political fallout" if Congress delays expected So
cial Security hikes.
The so-called "budget summit," now in its fourth week, con
tinued to focus on finding an additional savings of at least $2 bil
lion from federal entitlement programs. That appears to be the
only major stumbling block to an agreement by the Republican
White House and the Democratic-led Congress to reduce the
deficit by more than $30 billion.
But, as Friday's deadline for striking a deal approaches, the
quick mobilization of opposition to proposals for making those
final cuts demonstrates the basic reality of deficit-reduction
politics: Despite the shock from the stock market's crash
several weeks ago, it is far from clear that the public is willing to
accept the sacrifices that would be required to bring spending in
line with government revenues.
Howard Beach attacker identified
NEW YORK — A key prosecution witness in the Howard
Beach racial attack trial stood in court yesterday, dramatically
pointed to an 18-year-old defendant and charged that he was the
assailant who smashed his head with a baseball bat so severely it
took 66 stitches to close the wounds.
At one point during his testimony — perhaps the most power
ful in the more than month-long trial of four white youths
charged with murder and manslaughter — Cedric Sandiford told
how he clutched one end of a wooden baseball bat while an at
tacker he described as 5-foot-2, 130 pounds with blond hair, blue
eyes and round, red cheeks, held onto the other end of the
weapon.
"Look around the courtroom and see if you recognize that
person, ordered special New York state prosecutor Charles
Hynes.
"He's right there," Sandiford said, gesturing toward Jon
Lester, one of the defendants in the case that turned a quiet
Queens neighborhood into a national symbol of urban racial vio
lence after a gang of teenagers chased a black man into traffic on
a busy highway where he was struck and killed by an auto.

Pravda story urges parly discipline
MOSCOW — Kremlin conservatives, riding high following
the ouster of Boris Yeltsin as the Communist Party chief of
Moscow, voiced demands yesterday for greater party control
over elections to leading posts in factories and public organiza
tions.
A half-page article in Pravda, the party's most authoritative
newspaper, raised the question of whether "party democracy"
was diluting the idea of "party discipline." It said that many
workers were disappearing from their jobs to go to Moscow and
complain about shortcomings in the name of "perestroika," the
catcn-word for the reform program of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
Analysts said the hard-line Pravda article was an indirect at
tack on Yeltsin, who was dismissed last week as leader of the
Moscow party.
Yeltsin apparently also has been removed as non-voting mem
ber of the Politburo. Significantly, his name did not appear in a
list of all other Politburo members who signed an obituary for
Pyatras Grishkyavichus, first secretary of the Lithuanian Com
munist Party, who died Saturday at the age of 63.
A Western diplomat, who asked that his name not be used,
said that conservatives in the Kremlin leadership demanded
Yeltsin s dismissal after he accused Politburo member Yegor
Ligachev of slowing the pace of reform during an Oct. 21 speech
at a plenum of the party's Central Committee.
