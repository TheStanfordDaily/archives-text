# Reagan castigates Wright

### 
WASHINGTON — In a personal meeting
yesterday at the White House, President
Reagan admonished House Speaker Jim
Wright (D-Texas) for talking with Nicaraguan
leaders, but Wright left the meeting un
apologetic for the unorthodox role he is
playing in the Central America peace negotia
tions.
"I don't have to get permission, and I think
it would be demeaning in a sense to have to
get permission," Wright declared, referring
to the administration's contention that he
should not contact Central American leaders
without first clearing it with the Department
of State.
The standoff between Reagan and Wright
is certain to complicate the task of State De
partment officials assigned to carry out U.S.
policy in Central America. Wright's contin
ued participation also will serve to put addi
tional pressure on the administration to hold
bilateral talks with the Sandinista govern
ment.
Described as a "stern session" by White
House participants, the one-hour, face-to
face meeting between Wright and Reagan
also was attended by a number of other top
administration officials, including Vice Presi
dent George Bush, Secretary of State George

Shultz, White House chief of staff Howard
Baker Jr. and National Security Adviser
Frank Carlucci.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said the president told Wright that he disap
proved of the meetings that the speaker held
with Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega late last
week, at a time when administration officials
are refusing to talk to Ortega.
Fitzwater said that Reagan, who has long
supported the contras' effort to overthrow
the Sandinistas, told the speaker that by in
jecting himself into the middle of the
Nicaraguan peace talks he was "getting in
volved in what should be essentially a matter
between the Sandinista government and the
Nicaraguan resistance."
Shultz has said that Wright should have
notified the State Department before his
meetings Thursday and Friday with Ortega
and Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who is
expected to serve as mediator between the
Sandinistas and the contras.
When asked whether the president slapped
his wrist, Wright replied, "1 regard the rela
tionship between the executive and the
legislative branch as a co-equal relationship.
One does not extend one's wrist for slap
ping."

Wright said he would continue meeting
with Central American leaders and would
make a trip to Costa Rica on Dec. I. He
added that when administration officials were
told of his plans to visit the region, they did
not object.
The speaker leveled some of his own
criticism at the administration and argued
that Central American leaders such as Ortega
come to him because they do not feel com
fortable going to State Department officials.
"There is an impression — and perhaps it
is an unfair impression — that the administra
tion treats them as inferiors," he said. "I
don't treat them as inferiors. . . . Perhaps if
they had an open-door policy toward people
in Central America, they would go see them
instead of coming to see me."
Wright asserted that there were factions
within the administration who will settle for
nothing less than a military victory over the
Sandinistas. "It's an open secret that there
are people in the administration who don't
want a settlement," he said.
He likewise dismissed the administration's
contention that his meetings with Ortega give
legitimacy to the communist government.
"Who am I to confer legitimacy?" he asked.
