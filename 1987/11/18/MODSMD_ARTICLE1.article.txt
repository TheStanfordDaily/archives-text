# Universities never sought Reagan library
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Three California universities once thought to be
favored sites for the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library and public affairs center never actively
sought the facility, school officials said yesterday.
The schools were among 30 sites being consid
ered for the library after plans to build it at Stanford
were canceled last spring. Few of those univer
sities, however, expressed strong interest in the li
brary, sources said.
University of Southern California representa
tives revealed for the first time yesterday that they
never proposed to bring the library there.
Officials at Fepperdine University in Malibu and
at UC-Riverside said they would have welcomed
the library, but lost interest weeks ago, when the
Reagan Library Foundation informed the schools
that they were not suitable locations.
The foundation announced Friday that the li
brary will be located on private land near Los An
geles.
According to Roddy Wolper, director of public
information at Pepperdine, the university's deans
and department directors had known "for a couple
of weeks" that Pepperdine was out of the running.
Wolper said Pepperdine President David Daven
port met with school officials in October to inform
them the foundation was looking elsewhere.
Wolper said the national press considered Pep
perdine to be the probable location after the foun
dation decided last April not to build the library at
Stanford.
While the foundation did not inform Pepperdine
of the reasons for its decision, one factor could
have been that Malibu is a limited-growth commu
nity and might have been opposed to tourism
generated by a center for public affairs, according
to Wolper.
Martin Anderson, a past member of the founda
tion and Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution,
said the foundation also decided against Malibu be
cause it lies on a major geological fault line.
However, because the library will still be near
Pepperdine, the school "might strike up a relation
ship" and explore programs on which the institu
tions can work together, Wolper said.
Officials at UC-Riverside said they knew since
early summer that their school probably would not
be chosen for the library's location, according to
Jack Chappell, director of university relations
there.
Chappell said the foundation informed the school
privately that it was searching for a site north of
Los Angeles near where Reagan plans to retire, and
that Riverside, 90 miles away, would be too far
away.
He also said that Riverside did not offer as much
land as the current site, which is a 100-acre plot in
the Thousand Oaks-Simi Valley region of Southern
California, 40 minutes outside Los Angeles.
Robert Biller, director of university affairs at
USC, said that USC did not make a proposal to the
foundation because officials there "never received
enough encouragement" from within the school.
Though some have suggested that the foundation
did not choose to affiliate with a university because
of the controversy at Stanford, Anderson said
many factors were involved in
the search.
He said the foundation, in ad
dition to considering local ac
ceptance of the library and center
for public affairs, also took into
account the locations and sizes of
the sites offered. Also considered
were access to highways and air
ports, services available in the
vicinity, potential earthquake
problems and local zoning laws.
