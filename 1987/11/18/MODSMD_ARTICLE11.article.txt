# Stanford International Development Organization
## Development group plans a fast 
### John M. Wagner Jr 
In an effort to both heighten
student awareness about hunger
and to raise money for project
funding, the Stanford Interna
tional Development Organization
(SIDO) is sponsoring the first of
this year's two campus-wide
fasts tomorrow. The second fast
will take place in the spring.
Students who wish to partici
pate in the fast should turn their
meal cards in to University Food
Service after dinner tonight.
Food Service will then donate to
SI DO the money the students
would have spent on food.
SIDO is a voluntary student
organization at Stanford that
tries to "educate students on

campus about international de
velopment issues," according to
its president Debbie Oilman, a
senior majoring in international
relations.
About 60 percent of the money
collected from the fast will go
toward funding SIDO interna
tional development projects. Ac
cording to Oilman, each year the
organization chooses one to four
"grassroots" projects to fund.
Last year. SIDO supported a
cooperative for Salvadoran
refugees in Nicaragua and
stocked a health clinic in Tijuana,
Mexico, with medicines and
vaccines.
This year's projects will be
chosen after the money has been
collected. According to Oilman,

SIDO chooses to fund "small
scale, bottom-up development."
"It's local initiative," said
Cathy Ross, an organizer of the
fast and also a senior interna
tional relations major.
"The people (who get assis
tance) are really behind (the proj
ect] and see a need for it them
selves and are willing to work for
it themselves," she said. "It's a
'teach me to fish, and I'll eat for a
lifetime' approach."
The remaining 40 percent of
the money raised tomorrow will
be divided between the Ecumeni
cal Hunger Project, a local organ
ization working with the poor in
East Palo Alto, and Oxfam
America, an international agency

that funds self-help development
projects and disaster relief in
economically disadvantaged
countries in Asia, Africa and
Latin America.
SIDO representatives will
place an information table in
White Plaza from 11 a.m. to 1
p.m. today and tomorrow for
those interested in learning more
about the fast and SIDO. Ap
proximately 30 houses on
campus without Food Service
have been invited to make dona
tions from their house funds to
SIDO. Additional donations are
encouraged, Gilman said.
In the four years SIDO has
sponsored campus fasts, each
fast has generated from $1000 to
$6000, Gilman said.
