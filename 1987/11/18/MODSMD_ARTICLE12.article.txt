## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Don't fund club dues 
### 
University President Donald Kennedy was
unapologetic last week in revealing that Stanford
subsidizes the private affiliations of its
employees — including memberships in the all
male Bohemian Club — to the extent that such
affiliations "enhance the employee's effective
ness in performing University duties."
Kennedy emphasized that faculty and staff
can exercise individual choice as to which
groups to join — even if they openly dis
criminate — so long as no such group violates
the law.
Principles of free speech and association re
quire that Stanford faculty and staff be permitted
to join and retain membership in private clubs,
however reprehensible the practices of these
clubs might be, without sanction from the Uni
versity.
The flaw in President Kennedy's reasoning is
that he believes these principles also compel the
University to reimburse the cost of membership
and dues in discriminatory groups if academic
interaction or University development efforts
are promoted. Acquiescence in an individual's
purely private misconduct is one thing. Active
institutional assistance in promoting such mis
conduct through subsidies is another matter en
tirely.

The University has a moral duty to refrain
from aiding and abetting discrimination, whether
or not the discrimination is unlawful. As a conse
quence of its institutional role as an intellectual
leader, the University has a duty to exercise
moral leadership as well.
The University fails to provide moral leader
ship when it pronounces, as Kennedy has effec
tively done, that all legally permissible conduct,
no matter how disdainful, may be appropriately
supported by the University when it is in the
University's interest to do so. To the extent that
the University sacrifices its conscience to
promote interaction with bigots or to inflate its
endowment it prostitutes its principles.
Before subsidizing an employee's club or as
sociation membership, the University ought to
require the employee to attest that he or she has
made a good faith effort to research the organi
zation and believes that the group does not dis
criminate. If the University later finds that the
group does in fact discriminate, it should cease
funding the employee's membership and request
that the employee resign from the group.
In this way the University can promote both
principles of free association and also non
discrimination.
