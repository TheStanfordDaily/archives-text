## Society's straightjacket 
### 
I started to write a letter to The
Daily today, and then stopped
when the idea came to me: "Will
my opinion today haunt me until
my grave?" Will I be allowed to
change my opinions over time, or
will I always be seen as a product
of this letter? These thoughts
would have never entered my
mind without witnessing the
events of the past year with
respect to the presidential candi
dates and Supreme Court
nominees.

The safest route one could take
would be to only come out with
strong opinions on "safe" issues
(i.e. should we prevent nuclear
war, should we improve the eco
nomy, etc.) and to straddle the
fence on abortion, gay rights,
defense spending, education
spending and others.
Sure, I can talk about these is
sues, but only in terms of "seeing
everyone's point of view" and
wanting to protect everyone's
rights (without discussing how).
Had Judge Bork moderated his
views in public and in print, per
haps he would be on the Supreme
Court today. Few argued his abil
ity or intellect. Had Gary Hart
hidden his activities better, per
haps he would have been presi
dent next year.
Should we allow the media or
society to judge us (or others)
with so much weight on our ac
tions and opinions of the past.
Won't this discourage our public
servants from being forthright
with the general population on all
the issues? How many of us have

not grown and changed over the
last five years?
Pat Robertson and Jesse Jack
son both years ago had children
conceived before they were
married. Do we judge them on
these actions or on their beliefs,
standards and expressed opin
ions today, as well as their years
of public service?
We are becoming a society that
does not want to think through
complex issues or wrestle with
which candidate will be best for
public office. We want candi
dates who look and sound nice.
And the candidates themselves
attack the "packaging" of their
competitors. For instance, in
1980 President Carter said to
Senator Kennedy, "I will not
panic in a crisis," dredging up
Chappaquiddick to soil Ken
nedy's "packaging." And
Senator Biden's competitors
(Governor Dukakis, et al.) com
piled his unacknowledged quotes
so that he wouldn't appear
"nice" to the public.
We need to look at substantive
issues with more weight than
"appearance" issues. This re
quires compassion and under
standing for past problems and
mistakes while demanding integ
rity and quality in their activities
today.
How many of us want a rela
tionship with a spouse, friend or
employer in which one or a few
mistakes will destroy the rela
tionship? We want people who
are committed to us and know
our value and see our integrity
and abilities in operation the vast
majority of the time — people
who are suprised when we blow
it (as we ourselves are), because
they expect the best from us, yet
who nonetheless have enough
discernment to know we are
human and we are growing and

maturing, so they don't dump us
at the slightest slip-up. We want
people for ourselves who chal
lenge us to be our best, but ac
cept us when we don't quite
make it.
In our society, however, we
see, "He smoked pot 10 years
ago, and therefore is not fit to sit
on the Supreme Court." Instead
we should ask, "What is his
opinion today (not just on drugs
but on the myriad of issues that
are important to us)?" "What di
rection has he been going the last
10 years?" "How does he view
his past problems and mistakes
(i.e. Pat Robertson's remofse
over a mistake 30 years ago, vs.
Gary Hart's current disregard'for
his promises to his wife)"
Senator Biden made a bad deci
sion while in college years ago
and didn't acknowledge all his
quotes while campaigning this
year. Is this a continuing trend,
or has his public service and in
tegrity over the years been dem
onstrated?
We must think about, investi
gate and form opinions by weigh
ing all the information available
about a person: present work,
opinions and actions; past behav
ior, opinions and work accom
plished; direction ideology is
traveling and has traveled over
the past years. We should see
people for who they truly are, not
for the one-dimensional car
icature portrayed to us by the
media or their critics (con
servative or liberal). It requires a
willingness and effort on our
part, but the people in our soci
ety, and our society itself,
deserve our effort.
Now, on to writing the letter I
had originally planned.

student in engineering manage

1980 President Carter said to
Senator Kennedy, "I will not
panic in a crisis," dredging up
Chappaquiddick to soil Ken
nedy's "packaging." And
Senator Biden's competitors
(Governor Dukakis, et al.) com
piled his unacknowledged quotes
so that he wouldn't appear
"nice" to the public.
We need to look at substantive
issues with more weight than
"appearance" issues. This re
quires compassion and under
standing for past problems and
mistakes while demanding integ
rity and quality in their activities
today.
How many of us want a rela
tionship with a spouse, friend or
employer in which one or a few
mistakes will destroy the rela
tionship? We want people who
are committed to us and know
our value and see our integrity
and abilities in operation the vast
majority of the time — people
who are suprised when we blow
it (as we ourselves are), because
they expect the best from us, yet
who nonetheless have enough
discernment to know we are
human and we are growing and

maturing, so they don't dump us
at the slightest slip-up. We want
people for ourselves who chal
lenge us to be our best, but ac
cept us when we don't quite
make it.
In our society, however, we
see, "He smoked pot 10 years
ago, and therefore is not fit to sit
on the Supreme Court." Instead
we should ask, "What is his
opinion today (not just on drugs
but on the myriad of issues that
are important to us)?" "What di
rection has he been going the last
10 years?" "How does he view
his past problems and mistakes
(i.e. Pat Robertson's remofse
over a mistake 30 years ago, vs.
Gary Hart's current disregard'for
his promises to his wife)"
Senator Biden made a bad deci
sion while in college years ago
and didn't acknowledge all his
quotes while campaigning this
year. Is this a continuing trend,
or has his public service and in
tegrity over the years been dem
onstrated?
We must think about, investi
gate and form opinions by weigh
ing all the information available
about a person: present work,
opinions and actions; past behav
ior, opinions and work accom
plished; direction ideology is
traveling and has traveled over
the past years. We should see
people for who they truly are, not
for the one-dimensional car
icature portrayed to us by the
media or their critics (con
servative or liberal). It requires a
willingness and effort on our
part, but the people in our soci
ety, and our society itself,
deserve our effort.
Now, on to writing the letter I
had originally planned.
Douglas Thoreson is a graduate
student in engineering manage
ment.
I started to write a letter to The
Daily today, and then stopped
when the idea came to me: "Will
my opinion today haunt me until
my grave?" Will I be allowed to
change my opinions over time, or
will I always be seen as a product
of this letter? These thoughts
would have never entered my
mind without witnessing the
events of the past year with
respect to the presidential candi
dates and Supreme Court
nominees.

The safest route one could take
would be to only come out with
strong opinions on "safe" issues
(i.e. should we prevent nuclear
war, should we improve the eco
nomy, etc.) and to straddle the
fence on abortion, gay rights,
defense spending, education
spending and others.
Sure, I can talk about these is
sues, but only in terms of "seeing
everyone's point of view" and
wanting to protect everyone's
rights (without discussing how).
Had Judge Bork moderated his
views in public and in print, per
haps he would be on the Supreme
Court today. Few argued his abil
ity or intellect. Had Gary Hart
hidden his activities better, per
haps he would have been presi
dent next year.
Should we allow the media or
society to judge us (or others)
with so much weight on our ac
tions and opinions of the past.
Won't this discourage our public
servants from being forthright
with the general population on all
the issues? How many of us have

not grown and changed over the
last five years?
Pat Robertson and Jesse Jack
son both years ago had children
conceived before they were
married. Do we judge them on
these actions or on their beliefs,
standards and expressed opin
ions today, as well as their years
of public service?
We are becoming a society that
does not want to think through
complex issues or wrestle with
which candidate will be best for
public office. We want candi
dates who look and sound nice.
And the candidates themselves
attack the "packaging" of their
competitors. For instance, in
1980 President Carter said to
Senator Kennedy, "I will not
panic in a crisis," dredging up
Chappaquiddick to soil Ken
nedy's "packaging." And
