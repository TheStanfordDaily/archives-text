## GLAS provides comfortable setting 
### 
We would like to respond to
some of the statements by Mar
shall Schiff and Vinny Frost in
the Nov. 10 and 11 issues of The
Daily.

Fitzpatrick,
Inness

Schiff said: "One might argue
that homosexuals are a minority
and deserve funding because of
their minority status, but like fra
ternity members, GLAS mem
bers choose to become part of
their respective group. It is unfair
to the real minorities on campus
that funds must go to a social or
ganization when the funds could
be better spent."
Some gay and lesbian people
perceive their sexual orientation
as chosen, and others of us ex
perience it as a condition of our
beings. However, whether we do

or do not choose our sexual ori
entation, we do not choose to
lose or risk the loss of our jobs,
friends, families, children, emo
tional health and physical safety
because we are men who love
other men and women who love
other women. We do not choose
to have to either hide and lie in
our jobs, classes, dorms, teams
and, yes, fraternities and so
rorities, or to be the recipients of
violence, hostility and exclusion
if we are-"out."
If lesbians and gay men are not
a "real" minority, then why does
Interfraternity Council President
Frost state that "if a fraternity
collectively decides that they are
uncomfortable with homosexual
members, I think they have the
right not to select them."
Isn't this a blatant statement of
discrimination against a gay
minority? Could Frost as easily
say that a fraternity may choose
not to select Jewish or black
members because they make
them "uncomfortable?" (We are

not implying that blacks and
Jews are not discriminated
against in the fraternity commu
nity, but rather that discrimina
tion against them does not seem
to be as socially acceptable these
days.)

Lesbians and gay
men are a very "real"
minority, and we are
parts of both majority
and minority racial and
cultural groups.

Said Schiff: "If GLAS gets
funding for homosexual activi
ties, then why don't fraternities
correspondingly receive funds

for providing the heterosexual
community tne same social op
portunities?"
Were you ever excluded from
any dorm activities because you
were a heterosexual? Have you
ever been called names, threat
ened with physical violence or
beaten up because you walked
down the street holding your
girlfriend's hand? Have you ever
thought to yourself that it would
be great if you could be some
where where you didn't have to
hide your heterosexuality from
anyone, where people didn't
treat you with hatred and con
tempt because of your sexual ori
entation?
GLAS provides lesbians and
gay men with a social setting
where everyone can be "out"
and where no one has to deal
with the homophobia prevalent
in so many segments of the Stan
ford community.
