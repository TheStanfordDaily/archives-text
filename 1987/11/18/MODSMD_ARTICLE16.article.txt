Editors and paper-graders must be universally
hated almost as much as dentists. I don't know a
single individual who hasn't been degraded,
humiliated, pinched, kicked, punched, or bitten by
comments or deletions made by these people. And
yet we go back for more. Perhaps, we should stage
an apocalyptic rebellion in which we slay them all
mercilessly with red ink pens and then strew their
entrails out in the streets to spell "VAGUE" or the
ever-popular "AWKWARD. '

You're probably surprised that such fighting
words are coming from an English major— "one of
them"' so to speak. Well, enough is enough, and 1
personally will orchestrate the aforementioned
carnage. Let's begin with that omnipotent beast we
call "editor."
Every piece of writing submitted for publication
must be edited. Without exception. But even when
an editor has such admirable intentions as having to
make the writer's work fit into the given space,
editing must demonstrate good judgment.
1 would contend that even bad writing is more re
warding than bad editing. One should create a
work, not slaughter it. I've always wanted to ask an
editor, "If you yourself could write, would you still
be an editor?" From a psychological perspective,
however, the urge to maim must be very strong.
We've had vandalism for centuries. Marginal
editing will surely persist. When writers read their
edited work, they will still feel like they're looking

at their first newborn child after someone has taken
a butcher knife and lopped off its left leg.
On to an equally formidable creature: the paper
grader. The only way we can learn how to write ef
fectively is through constructive and penetrating
comments from whoever reads our papers. I al
ways hold these individuals in the highest esteem
when they put out as much energy grading my
papers as I do writing them, and when they try to
preserve my intention in the paper, not warping my
ideas to fit their own interpretations of the subject
matter.
But, over the past few years, some of the com
ments I've had written in my papers' margins have
been hilarious. I'll limit myself to monstrosities
everyone has seen at some point. It will help estab
lish the community of malcontents crucial to our
militant efforts.
First, their handwriting is often illegible. I'm
curious: Are these TAs trained in special writing
techniques that involve holding pens in their teeth?
And some of the words they scrawl make you
laugh out loud, once your initial, hurt feelings pass.
The innocent word "vague'' springs to mind. I
can't think of a more "vague" piece of writing than
that word, alone, appearing in a margin. What, spe
cifically, is vague about the passage? If the paper
reader had clear enough thoughts to articulate what
was indistinct, I could respect such a criticism.
"Awkward"' is a good one, too. Again, many
paper-readers don't elaborate on what specifically
is amiss. Most of the time they don't even bother to
write out the entire word. They assume "AWK" is
enough. The next time you see that written on your
paper, imagine your TA perched in a cage, croak
ing that word like a myna bird.
Hmmm. I wonder why this column was so short.
Thank an editor.
