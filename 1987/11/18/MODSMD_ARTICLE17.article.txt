A front page story in The Daily
Nov. II quoted Interfraternity
Council President Vinny Frost as
saying he believes that a frater
nity has the right to exclude gays,
provided the fraternity's selec
tion is "based more on the indi
viduals than on prejudice, ignor
ance or stereotypes. If a frater-

nity collectively decides that
they are uncomfortable with
homosexual members, which
may well be the case for most fra
ternities, I think they have the
right not to select them."
Were Frost to have made the
same statements substituting
"blacks" or "Jews" or "Poles"
for "gays" and "homosexuals,"
the Stanford community as a
whole would have been properly
outraged at the bigotry ex
pressed. It would be a positive
sign if the community were

outraged with Frost's actual
bigotry.
Certainly the University
should not even give the appear
ance of condoning this sort of
discrimination by granting Uni
versity housing to groups that
systematically discriminate
against persons because of their
ethnic background or sexual ori
entation.
