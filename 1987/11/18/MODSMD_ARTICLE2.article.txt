# Kennedy on KZSU:
## Debate will not damage Area One 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy said last night that
recent faculty skirmishes over
the Western Culture Task Force

requirement will not ultimately
harm the integrity of the program
itself.

the theme of individual choice,
which he called the proper crite
