# Kennedy on KZSU:
## Debate will not damage Area One 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy said last night that
recent faculty skirmishes over
the Western Culture Task Force
proposal to reform the Area One
requirement will not ultimately
harm the integrity of the program
itself.
Responding to reports that a
significant number of humanities
professors feel alienated by the
proposal to shift Western Culture
away from a Eurocentric point of
view, Kennedy said, "There is
often crisp difference among fac
ulty members on matters of cur
riculum reform.
"I don't think it's the kind of
revolt that is going to divide the
faculty with respect to their con
duct and implementation of the
program that's ultimately agreed
to,' he said, adding that he was
"cautious" about taking a posi
tion before the proposal has been
finally debated in faculty com
mittee. He noted, however, that
he hopes eventually to be "a con
tributor."
In a 45-minute interview on the
KZSU show "Campus Confer

ence," Kennedy defended a vari
ety of University policies, includ
ing University Food Service's
decision not to boycott grapes,
the decision to continue to sub
sidize University officials' mem
berships in the Bohemian Club,
and the Career Planning and
Placement Center's policy of al
lowing "legally discriminating"
organizations to recruit on
campus.
Kennedy said the University's
switch on the grape boycott
called by MEChA and the United
Farm Workers was "carefully
considered" over the summer.
The deciding factor, he said, was
the theme of individual choice,
which he called the proper crite
rion on which to base policy deci
sions.
"Should we intervene in this
matter so that individual choices
are foreclosed and institutional
choices substituted for them?"
Kennedy asked. "The answer is
no.
"But we do need to give stu
dents the mechanisms to make
the choice. We agreed to make
information available and spon

sor public forums on the sub
ject."
Kennedy acknowledged,
though, that he had received
complaints from residences that
information was not readily
available. "If that is the case,
then we're clearly delinquent,"
he said.
Kennedy stressed that individ
ual choice was again the deciding
factor in allowing University sub
sidies for some faculty members
to join the Bohemian Club, an al

legedly elitist men's club based in
San Francisco. Kennedy said
that legality is the only standard
that should be applied to deter
mine whether Bohemian Club
membership is "materially rele
vant to job performance."
"1 do have some sensitivity to
the argument that University
subsidized endeavors need to be
scrutinized," he said. "But 1
would hope that we would not
make institutional judgments for
faculty members."
Responding to criticism that
the CPPC's non-discrimination
policy is looser than the Univer
sity's general employment and

admissions non-discrimination
policy, Kennedy said, "The
CPPC will not permit the appear
ance on campus of any organiza
tion guilty of illegal discrimina
tion. But it leaves other matters
to the play of political dis
course."
Those who oppose on-campus
recruitment by the CIA, said
Kennedy, "are perfectly open to
display their dislike of the organi
zation, within limits."
Kennedy took phone calls
from around the campus on a va
riety of issues. Some excerpts:
• On police harassment of

blacks: "There's always a prob
lem. On the one hand, police are
accused of being overzealous.
On the other hand, they're
accused of negligence if they do
too little "
• On public scrutiny of his
divorce and remarriage: "It's
given me more cause to reflect on
what others in the public arena
are experiencing. The real test
with respect to political figures is
whether the concerns are
germane to the evaluation of job
performance. In my own case, *
the relevance of a divorce and
remarriage to my performance as
president is not germane."
