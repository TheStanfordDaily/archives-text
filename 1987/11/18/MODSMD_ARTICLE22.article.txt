## Spouses of foreign students struggle to fit in 
### Marthe Lemut 
"1 am always homesick. It is
not that 1 am not happy, but I
want to go back home," Yael
Shiran, from Israel, said of her
life at Stanford.
Shiran is spending her sixth
year here, while her husband,
Yehuda Shiran, works toward his
Ph.D. in mechanical engineering.
Every year a number of inter
national students — mostly
graduates — come to Stanford to
study, and bring their spouses
with them.
The experiences of these
spouses — most of whom leave
families and careers back home
— are mixed. While some find
the opportunity to temporarily
live abroad overwhelmingly posi
tive, most experience at least
some alienation in a strange land
where they have come to follow
the path of another.
"Leaving your friends and
your family is a difficult situa
tion," Yael Shiran said.
Despite the diversity of inter
national spouses' experiences at
Stanford, "what they have in
common is a lack of social sup

port network," said Ghislene
Botelho de Magalhaes, assistant
adviser to international families
at Bechtel International Center,
and an international wife herself.
The I-Center hosts many pro
grams to help international
spouses adjust to their new lives
in the United States.
"You tend to compare [life at
Stanfordl with your previous life
style, — what you were,"
Botelho de Magalhaes said.
"Here, you're just a student's
wife."
Leaving behind her work as a
counseling professor at the Cath
olic University in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, Botelho de Magalhaes
came to Stanford four years ago.
After a difficult first few
months here she decided to begin
work as a volunteer researcher at
the School of Education, where
she stayed for two years before
moving to her post at the I-
Center.
"Even learning as much as I
did (at Stanford), even having the
opportunity to apply what I
learned, if you speak in career
terms, you're lost," Botelho de
Magalhaes said, referring to the

fact that in coming to the United
States she relinquished her
professorship in Brazil.
Like Botelho de Magalhaes,
Yael Shiran also had to leave a
prestigious job and start on a
lower level when she came to
Stanford.
Once a civil engineer in Israel,
she now works as a computer
programmer at the Stanford
Medical Center; she studied
computer science at the Univer
sity of Santa Clara for three
years.
The Shirans planned to come
to Stanford together and were
both admitted to the Civil Engi
neering Department. However,
because of financial difficulties,
only Yehuda could study at Stan
ford while Yael went to Santa
Clara.
"It was obvious that she was
going to study," Yehuda said of
his wife's plans in America.
While education has been a
concern for the Shirans, the
Fuyamas, a couple from Japan,
found that learning English was
"a very serious problem," ac
cording to Hiroyuki Fuyama, a
second-year student in the Civil
Engineering Department.
Fuyama came to Stanford last
year and took a summer English
course to prepare for the fall. At
the end 01 the summer his wife,
Hiromi, joined him.
At a speech the couple gave at
the I-Center orientation at the be
ginning of this quarter, the
Fuyamas said that not being able
to speak English made them both
feel "mute and deaf."
"Fortunately we survived,"
they said, "even though we
could not overcome the language
problem."
"At first I was nervous — even
going shopping," Hiromi said of
ner first couple of months here.
In an attempt to reduce the lan
guage barrier she has enrolled in
English lessons at Escondido Vil
lage and attends "English in Ac
tion," a program at the I-Center
this year.

The different needs of each in
ternational couple make the 1-
Center's task a difficult one.
Gwyn Dukes, adviser to inter
national families at the 1-Center,
whose job is to provide programs
for international spouses, calls
her work a challenge. "You want
to be able to find appropriate
links to the community and in
volvement for each of Ithe
couples! in a way that they are
comfortable," she said, adding
that this task "is very different
from one person to the next."
The I-Center offers programs
designed to meet spouses' basic
needs. The center gives English
lessons, helps spouses find jobs
and assists them in enrolling in
educational programs at local
universities.
The I-Center also offers its
own educational programs, such
as an American cooking class.
Aside from cooking, "a lot of
sharing and friendliness is going
on" in the class, according to
program coordinator Anne Rut
herdale. The students "get a kick
out of cooking a Thanksgiving
dinner," she added.
The I-Center hopes that in
classes like these foreign spouses
will learn about American cul
ture.
The "English in Action" pro
gram, for example, seeks to in
troduce spouses to the American
people. Engaging in one hour of
English conversation per week
with American volunteers,
spouses often find that their
"partners turn into friendships,"
according to Marilyn Hawley,
co-chairman of the program.
Through these activities, the I-
Center provides a base for many
foreign spouses. Without the
supporting structure of a school
schedule and with no logical con
tinuation to their career develop
ment, the adjustment to a new
country may be greater for the in
ternational spouse than for the
international student, according
to Dukes.
"[Spouses] start at ground

zero," she said. "Some are for
tunate to be flexible enough to
pick up a new interest so that
their time here is a good opportu
nity rather than a waste."
However, the time it takes to
carve a niche depends largely on
the spouse's personality. "It can
take a few months, but it also can
take years," Botelho de
Magalhaes said.
Corinne and Hock Ng from
Singapore just arrived at Stan
ford this year. After two months,
"the thing I miss most is
working," said Corinne, who had
a job as a tax accountant in Sin
gapore.
Corinne and Hock, who is
working toward his Ph.D. in eco
nomics, may have an easier time
than most international couples
because they met during a four
year period in which they both
studied abroad in Australia.
Like most international wives,
Corinne said she feels she must
work to have a life of her own.
As Botelho de Magalhaes said,
"being at Stanford, the only solu
tion for a wife is to have an inde
pendent life."

Hiromi Fuyama, who has no
children, no job, a very busy hus
band and difficulties speaking
English, uses the I-Center to or
ganize her life at Stanford.
Through its classes, the I-
Center plays a crucial role in get
ting the wives together, accord
ing to Lota Pati 1, teacher of the
American cooking program. "It
is doing a lot of good," she said
of the class.
Even if not all the spouses at
tend the programs — for exam
ple, Yael Shiran has not attended
one of them in her six years here
— they all know that the l-Center
exists. "They have to know that
we are available" to provide as
sistance if ii is needed, Botelho
de Magalhaes said.
Apart from Escondido Village,
which also provides programs for
foreigners, there are few alter
nate programs in which spouses
can enroll to seek social support.
To till the great need, Dukes
said she hopes the l-Center can
be "an intermediary with the
campus and the community for
the spouses.

While her husband, Hiroyuki, studies civil engineering, lliromi
Fuvama, from Japan, keeps busy with I-Center programs designed for
spouses of international students.
"1 am always homesick. It is
not that 1 am not happy, but I
want to go back home," Yael
Shiran, from Israel, said of her
life at Stanford.
Shiran is spending her sixth
year here, while her husband,
Yehuda Shiran, works toward his
Ph.D. in mechanical engineering.
Every year a number of inter
national students — mostly
graduates — come to Stanford to
study, and bring their spouses
with them.
The experiences of these
spouses — most of whom leave
families and careers back home
— are mixed. While some find
the opportunity to temporarily
live abroad overwhelmingly posi
tive, most experience at least
some alienation in a strange land
where they have come to follow
the path of another.
"Leaving your friends and
your family is a difficult situa
tion," Yael Shiran said.
Despite the diversity of inter
national spouses' experiences at
Stanford, "what they have in
common is a lack of social sup

port network," said Ghislene
Botelho de Magalhaes, assistant
adviser to international families
at Bechtel International Center,
and an international wife herself.
The I-Center hosts many pro
grams to help international
spouses adjust to their new lives
in the United States.
"You tend to compare [life at
Stanfordl with your previous life
style, — what you were,"
Botelho de Magalhaes said.
"Here, you're just a student's
wife."
Leaving behind her work as a
counseling professor at the Cath
olic University in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, Botelho de Magalhaes
came to Stanford four years ago.
After a difficult first few
months here she decided to begin
work as a volunteer researcher at
the School of Education, where
she stayed for two years before
moving to her post at the I-
Center.
"Even learning as much as I
did (at Stanford), even having the
opportunity to apply what I
learned, if you speak in career
terms, you're lost," Botelho de
Magalhaes said, referring to the

fact that in coming to the United
States she relinquished her
professorship in Brazil.
Like Botelho de Magalhaes,
Yael Shiran also had to leave a
prestigious job and start on a
lower level when she came to
Stanford.
Once a civil engineer in Israel,
she now works as a computer
programmer at the Stanford
Medical Center; she studied
computer science at the Univer
sity of Santa Clara for three
years.
The Shirans planned to come
to Stanford together and were
both admitted to the Civil Engi
neering Department. However,
because of financial difficulties,
only Yehuda could study at Stan
ford while Yael went to Santa
Clara.
"It was obvious that she was
going to study," Yehuda said of
his wife's plans in America.
While education has been a
concern for the Shirans, the
Fuyamas, a couple from Japan,
found that learning English was
"a very serious problem," ac
cording to Hiroyuki Fuyama, a
second-year student in the Civil
Engineering Department.
Fuyama came to Stanford last
year and took a summer English
course to prepare for the fall. At
the end 01 the summer his wife,
Hiromi, joined him.
At a speech the couple gave at
the I-Center orientation at the be
ginning of this quarter, the
Fuyamas said that not being able
to speak English made them both
feel "mute and deaf."
"Fortunately we survived,"
they said, "even though we
could not overcome the language
problem."
"At first I was nervous — even
going shopping," Hiromi said of
ner first couple of months here.
In an attempt to reduce the lan
guage barrier she has enrolled in
English lessons at Escondido Vil
lage and attends "English in Ac
tion," a program at the I-Center
this year.

The different needs of each in
ternational couple make the 1-
Center's task a difficult one.
Gwyn Dukes, adviser to inter
national families at the 1-Center,
whose job is to provide programs
for international spouses, calls
her work a challenge. "You want
to be able to find appropriate
links to the community and in
volvement for each of Ithe
couples! in a way that they are
comfortable," she said, adding
that this task "is very different
from one person to the next."
The I-Center offers programs
designed to meet spouses' basic
needs. The center gives English
lessons, helps spouses find jobs
and assists them in enrolling in
educational programs at local
universities.
The I-Center also offers its
own educational programs, such
as an American cooking class.
Aside from cooking, "a lot of
sharing and friendliness is going
on" in the class, according to
program coordinator Anne Rut
herdale. The students "get a kick
out of cooking a Thanksgiving
dinner," she added.
The I-Center hopes that in
classes like these foreign spouses
will learn about American cul
ture.
The "English in Action" pro
gram, for example, seeks to in
troduce spouses to the American
people. Engaging in one hour of
English conversation per week
with American volunteers,
spouses often find that their
"partners turn into friendships,"
according to Marilyn Hawley,
co-chairman of the program.
Through these activities, the I-
Center provides a base for many
foreign spouses. Without the
supporting structure of a school
schedule and with no logical con
tinuation to their career develop
ment, the adjustment to a new
country may be greater for the in
ternational spouse than for the
international student, according
to Dukes.
"[Spouses] start at ground

zero," she said. "Some are for
tunate to be flexible enough to
pick up a new interest so that
their time here is a good opportu
nity rather than a waste."
However, the time it takes to
carve a niche depends largely on
the spouse's personality. "It can
take a few months, but it also can
take years," Botelho de
Magalhaes said.
Corinne and Hock Ng from
Singapore just arrived at Stan
ford this year. After two months,
"the thing I miss most is
working," said Corinne, who had
a job as a tax accountant in Sin
gapore.
Corinne and Hock, who is
working toward his Ph.D. in eco
nomics, may have an easier time
than most international couples
because they met during a four
year period in which they both
studied abroad in Australia.
Like most international wives,
Corinne said she feels she must
work to have a life of her own.
As Botelho de Magalhaes said,
"being at Stanford, the only solu
tion for a wife is to have an inde
pendent life."

Hiromi Fuyama, who has no
children, no job, a very busy hus
band and difficulties speaking
English, uses the I-Center to or

schedule and with no logical con
tinuation to their career develop
ment, the adjustment to a new
country may be greater for the in
ternational spouse than for the
international student, according
to Dukes.
"[Spouses] start at ground

zero," she said. "Some are for
tunate to be flexible enough to
pick up a new interest so that
their time here is a good opportu
nity rather than a waste."
However, the time it takes to
carve a niche depends largely on
the spouse's personality. "It can
take a few months, but it also can
take years," Botelho de
Magalhaes said.
Corinne and Hock Ng from
Singapore just arrived at Stan
ford this year. After two months,
"the thing I miss most is
working," said Corinne, who had
a job as a tax accountant in Sin
gapore.
Corinne and Hock, who is
working toward his Ph.D. in eco
nomics, may have an easier time
than most international couples
because they met during a four
year period in which they both
studied abroad in Australia.
Like most international wives,
Corinne said she feels she must
work to have a life of her own.
As Botelho de Magalhaes said,
"being at Stanford, the only solu
tion for a wife is to have an inde
pendent life."

Hiromi Fuyama, who has no
children, no job, a very busy hus
band and difficulties speaking
English, uses the I-Center to or
ganize her life at Stanford.
Through its classes, the I-
Center plays a crucial role in get
ting the wives together, accord
ing to Lota Pati 1, teacher of the
American cooking program. "It
is doing a lot of good," she said
of the class.
Even if not all the spouses at
tend the programs — for exam
ple, Yael Shiran has not attended
one of them in her six years here
— they all know that the l-Center
exists. "They have to know that
we are available" to provide as
sistance if ii is needed, Botelho
de Magalhaes said.
Apart from Escondido Village,
which also provides programs for
foreigners, there are few alter
nate programs in which spouses
can enroll to seek social support.
To till the great need, Dukes
said she hopes the l-Center can
be "an intermediary with the
campus and the community for
the spouses.

While her husband, Hiroyuki, studies civil engineering, lliromi
Fuvama, from Japan, keeps busy with I-Center programs designed for
spouses of international students.
"1 am always homesick. It is
not that 1 am not happy, but I
want to go back home," Yael
Shiran, from Israel, said of her
life at Stanford.
Shiran is spending her sixth
year here, while her husband,
Yehuda Shiran, works toward his
Ph.D. in mechanical engineering.
Every year a number of inter
national students — mostly
graduates — come to Stanford to
study, and bring their spouses
with them.
The experiences of these
spouses — most of whom leave
families and careers back home
— are mixed. While some find
the opportunity to temporarily
live abroad overwhelmingly posi
tive, most experience at least
some alienation in a strange land
where they have come to follow
the path of another.
"Leaving your friends and
your family is a difficult situa
tion," Yael Shiran said.
Despite the diversity of inter
national spouses' experiences at
Stanford, "what they have in
common is a lack of social sup

port network," said Ghislene
Botelho de Magalhaes, assistant
adviser to international families
at Bechtel International Center,
and an international wife herself.
The I-Center hosts many pro
grams to help international
spouses adjust to their new lives
in the United States.
"You tend to compare [life at
Stanfordl with your previous life
style, — what you were,"
Botelho de Magalhaes said.
"Here, you're just a student's
wife."
Leaving behind her work as a
counseling professor at the Cath
olic University in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, Botelho de Magalhaes
came to Stanford four years ago.
After a difficult first few
months here she decided to begin
work as a volunteer researcher at
the School of Education, where
she stayed for two years before
moving to her post at the I-
Center.
"Even learning as much as I
did (at Stanford), even having the
opportunity to apply what I
learned, if you speak in career
terms, you're lost," Botelho de
Magalhaes said, referring to the

fact that in coming to the United
States she relinquished her
professorship in Brazil.
Like Botelho de Magalhaes,
Yael Shiran also had to leave a
prestigious job and start on a
lower level when she came to
Stanford.
Once a civil engineer in Israel,
she now works as a computer
programmer at the Stanford
Medical Center; she studied
computer science at the Univer
sity of Santa Clara for three
years.
The Shirans planned to come
to Stanford together and were
both admitted to the Civil Engi
neering Department. However,
because of financial difficulties,
only Yehuda could study at Stan
ford while Yael went to Santa
Clara.
"It was obvious that she was
going to study," Yehuda said of
his wife's plans in America.
While education has been a
concern for the Shirans, the
Fuyamas, a couple from Japan,
found that learning English was
"a very serious problem," ac
cording to Hiroyuki Fuyama, a
second-year student in the Civil
Engineering Department.
Fuyama came to Stanford last
year and took a summer English
course to prepare for the fall. At
the end 01 the summer his wife,
Hiromi, joined him.
At a speech the couple gave at
the I-Center orientation at the be
ginning of this quarter, the
Fuyamas said that not being able
to speak English made them both
feel "mute and deaf."
"Fortunately we survived,"
they said, "even though we
could not overcome the language
problem."
"At first I was nervous — even
going shopping," Hiromi said of
ner first couple of months here.
In an attempt to reduce the lan
guage barrier she has enrolled in
English lessons at Escondido Vil
lage and attends "English in Ac
tion," a program at the I-Center
this year.

The different needs of each in
ternational couple make the 1-
Center's task a difficult one.
Gwyn Dukes, adviser to inter
national families at the 1-Center,
whose job is to provide programs
for international spouses, calls
her work a challenge. "You want
to be able to find appropriate
links to the community and in
volvement for each of Ithe
couples! in a way that they are
comfortable," she said, adding
that this task "is very different
from one person to the next."
The I-Center offers programs
designed to meet spouses' basic
needs. The center gives English
lessons, helps spouses find jobs
and assists them in enrolling in
educational programs at local
universities.
The I-Center also offers its
own educational programs, such
as an American cooking class.
Aside from cooking, "a lot of
sharing and friendliness is going
on" in the class, according to
program coordinator Anne Rut
herdale. The students "get a kick
out of cooking a Thanksgiving
dinner," she added.
The I-Center hopes that in
classes like these foreign spouses
will learn about American cul
ture.
The "English in Action" pro
gram, for example, seeks to in
troduce spouses to the American
people. Engaging in one hour of
English conversation per week
with American volunteers,
spouses often find that their
"partners turn into friendships,"
according to Marilyn Hawley,
co-chairman of the program.
Through these activities, the I-
Center provides a base for many
foreign spouses. Without the
supporting structure of a school
schedule and with no logical con
tinuation to their career develop
ment, the adjustment to a new
country may be greater for the in
ternational spouse than for the
international student, according
to Dukes.
"[Spouses] start at ground

zero," she said. "Some are for
tunate to be flexible enough to
pick up a new interest so that
their time here is a good opportu
nity rather than a waste."
However, the time it takes to
carve a niche depends largely on
the spouse's personality. "It can
take a few months, but it also can
take years," Botelho de
Magalhaes said.
Corinne and Hock Ng from
Singapore just arrived at Stan
ford this year. After two months,
"the thing I miss most is
working," said Corinne, who had
a job as a tax accountant in Sin
gapore.
Corinne and Hock, who is
working toward his Ph.D. in eco
nomics, may have an easier time

year period in which they both
studied abroad in Australia.
Like most international wives,
Corinne said she feels she must
work to have a life of her own.
As Botelho de Magalhaes said,
"being at Stanford, the only solu
tion for a wife is to have an inde
pendent life."

Hiromi Fuyama, who has no
children, no job, a very busy hus
band and difficulties speaking
