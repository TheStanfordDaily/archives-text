## R.E.M. and U2 concerts rock the Bay Area 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
Five bands in two days.
It has a sort of obscene ring to it. Kind of like
eighteen girls totally nude, or Pat Robertson for
president. Nevertheless, purely in the name of
journalism, I saw Jive bands in two days, and after
reading this review you'll feel as though you were
actually there. Come to think of it, with an esti
mated crowd of 3.4 million people at the U2 con
cert on Saturday, you probably were there.
Friday was the R.E.M. concert at the Oakland
C oliseum Arena, which is not to be confused with
the Oakland Coliseum Stadium. Here, for the first
time in print, is a guide to telling them apart:
I he Oakland Coliseum Arena is a big building off
Highway 880 in Oakland where sporting events and
concerts are held.

Friday's concert began with the warm-up band,
the dß's. No, I've never heard of them either.
What does dB stand for? David Bowie? Donut
Boys? Dumb Band? They had a raw, rough edge to
their music, meaning that they didn't really know
how to play their instruments.
After the dß's exited to a sitting ovation, we
decided to sneak down into better seats closer to
the stage. In doing this I nearly dismembered a
woman who was in the row we were sneaking into,
but later she and her boyfriend got even by
smoking eight kilos of dope.
R.E.M.'s stage had modest lighting and a big
screen behind the stage where they could show
obscure images during their obscure lyrics. Singer
Michael Stipe is pretty weird, but he can sure belt
out those songs. He wore a Bono-like ponytail — I
think it's now a federal law that all singers must try
to look like Bono.
R.E.M. did some stuff from "Document," their
new album, as well as a lot of songs from their pre
vious albums. Although their commercially suc
cessful singles have been mostly tame (i.e., " The
One I Love"), they came across as a pretty hard
rockin band in concert. During "It's the End of the
World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine)," the
screen flashed rapid-fire images, including the
visage of (I'm dead serious) Mr. Spock. How Mr.
Spock relates to R.E.M.'s mysterious, southern
rooted lyrics is beyond me.
I give thumbs up to R.E.M. and thumbs down to
the audience. Not only was the crowd way too
quiet for a rock n roll concert, but they also did not
know how to dance. R.E.M. would be playing a
nice romantic slow song, and some high school
rocker chick next to me would be slam-dancing
with the back of my chair.
Saturday was U2. I'd say that I'm not a fan of U2
and find them horribly overrated, but then some
one might find this article in 20 years and force me
to resign my bid for the Supreme Court.
Basically, we did everything wrong in going to

the concert. First of all, we got to the stadium at
1:00 in the afternoon, which was way too early for a
5 p.m.concert. Here was our philosophy: If we get
there early, then we can be nearer to the stage.
Here is what we forgot: If we are near to the stage,
there will be 70,000 people trying to be in exactly
the same spot.
So we waited in line for two-and-a-half hours,
during which time we were privileged to watch 600
hibachis, 4000 kegs of beer, 92 frisbees, 18 foot
balls, 140,000 U2 Joshua free Tour official $17 T
shirts, and four unnatural acts performed by
drunken couples. At 3:30 p.m. we were allowed
into the stadium (I must say I was searched rather
perfunctorily at the door — I could have smuggled
in a small recording studio had I wanted to.), and
we waited on the grass for another hour and a half.
Everything was cool while we were sitting on the
grass, but as soon as a roadie who looked
moderately like Bono came on stage to adjust a
speaker, everybody jumped up and tried to move
closer.
We should have known right off that we were in
trouble. Promoter Bill Graham came out and an
nounced before the show that a makeshift hospital
had been set up by the third base dugout to take
care of the wounded and that "we should all remain
calm and enjoy the show." What were we getting
ready for; a concert or World War III?
The BoDeans came on right at 5 p.m., and they
put on a good half-hour set. I'd actually heard a
couple of their songs before, and I predict some big
things from them in the future. I give them thumbs
up.
Then the Pretenders came on, and all hell broke
loose. I was about 20 feet from the stage with three
hearty friends. Imagine, if you will, an entire
baseball field packed with people. Now, imagine
those people all trying to stand on my head at once.
Suddenly I was swept away from my friends, and
every so often I would bob up on a wave and see a
familiar face. I became panicky and started pushing
back, which really helped a whole lot. I wasn't
even facing the stage and couldn't hear what
Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders was singing. I
was drowning in a sea of U2 fans. What a way to
go.
Hynde is way too thin, but she still has a cool
voice and she even strums a little guitar. Ex-Smiths
guitarist Johnny Marr handled the lead plucking.
The Pretenders played some old favorites like
"Middle of the Road" and a lot of stuff off the
latest album, but my most lasting memory of the
Pretenders will be that they are the band I was lis
tening to when I was almost crushed to death. I
give them my broken thumbs up.
Finally, U2 came on at about 8 p.m. to a roaring
ovation. Their stage was pretty huge, with speakers
on either side covered by cloth painted with the
thorn bushes from the Joshua Tree. Bono was
wearing a cowboy hat that made him look
decidedly silly. As always. The Fldge, Adam and
Larry looked stylin'.
They launched into "Where the Streets Have No
Name," and by the time they had finished they
played the whole first side of "The Joshua Tree,"

as well as a lot of the old stuff like "Pride (In the
Name of Love)," " October," "Sunday, Bloody
Sunday" and much, much more. They pretty much
reproduced their album sound on stage, although
Bono sang some a cappella stuff and some oldies
but goodies from the 60s.
They Hew in from Canada the artist whose
sculpture Bono had defiled last week during their
free concert in San Francisco, and the guy spray
painted anti-war slogans onto the U2 set. It was a
pretty hokey moment.
Bono does, however, have the niftiest accent this
side of Jim Kerr, and he brogued to the audience
frequently between songs.
As always, a screaming female managed to break
through the huge stage guards and grab onto Bono.
I always find il amazing that these stagehands
could stop an Iranian terrorist team from getting
near the band, but a small hysterical female can get
through with ease. Just before the roadies could
pounce on her and rip her to shreds. Bono called
them off like a pack of dobermans. He hugged the

girl, kissed her and basically gave her the biggest
thrill of her life. The crowd was moved; she was to
tally paralyzed. I think her brain snapped when he
kissed her.
Meanwhile, the crowd up front continued to as
sault one another. It's kind of funny how the audi
ence chants anti-war slogans while at the same time
trying to kill each other. Somebody even managed
to throw a frisbee at the stage. Why you would
want to tell your grandchildren that you hit Adam
Clayton in the forehead with a Wham-O is beyond
me.
U2 finished the show after about two hours of
playing, and the crowd seemed decidedly satisfied.
Even though I wasn't a big U2 fan before 1 went, 1
left the show with a deeper respect and admiration
tor the band than before and an inner sense of
peace.
Then again, during the car ride home a
Pretenders song came on the radio, and I uncon
sciously tried to shove my date out the window.

decidedly silly. As always. The Fldge, Adam and
Larry looked stylin'.
They launched into "Where the Streets Have No
Name," and by the time they had finished they
played the whole first side of "The Joshua Tree,"

as well as a lot of the old stuff like "Pride (In the
Name of Love)," " October," "Sunday, Bloody
Sunday" and much, much more. They pretty much
reproduced their album sound on stage, although
Bono sang some a cappella stuff and some oldies
but goodies from the 60s.
They Hew in from Canada the artist whose
sculpture Bono had defiled last week during their
free concert in San Francisco, and the guy spray
painted anti-war slogans onto the U2 set. It was a
pretty hokey moment.
Bono does, however, have the niftiest accent this
side of Jim Kerr, and he brogued to the audience
frequently between songs.
As always, a screaming female managed to break
through the huge stage guards and grab onto Bono.
I always find il amazing that these stagehands
could stop an Iranian terrorist team from getting
near the band, but a small hysterical female can get
through with ease. Just before the roadies could
pounce on her and rip her to shreds. Bono called
them off like a pack of dobermans. He hugged the

girl, kissed her and basically gave her the biggest
thrill of her life. The crowd was moved; she was to
tally paralyzed. I think her brain snapped when he
kissed her.
Meanwhile, the crowd up front continued to as
sault one another. It's kind of funny how the audi
ence chants anti-war slogans while at the same time
trying to kill each other. Somebody even managed
to throw a frisbee at the stage. Why you would
want to tell your grandchildren that you hit Adam
Clayton in the forehead with a Wham-O is beyond
me.
U2 finished the show after about two hours of
playing, and the crowd seemed decidedly satisfied.
Even though I wasn't a big U2 fan before 1 went, 1
left the show with a deeper respect and admiration
tor the band than before and an inner sense of
peace.
Then again, during the car ride home a
Pretenders song came on the radio, and I uncon
sciously tried to shove my date out the window.

Five bands in two days.
It has a sort of obscene ring to it. Kind of like
eighteen girls totally nude, or Pat Robertson for
president. Nevertheless, purely in the name of
journalism, I saw Jive bands in two days, and after
reading this review you'll feel as though you were
actually there. Come to think of it, with an esti

cert on Saturday, you probably were there.
Friday was the R.E.M. concert at the Oakland

the Oakland Coliseum Stadium. Here, for the first
time in print, is a guide to telling them apart:

Friday's concert began with the warm-up band,
the dß's. No, I've never heard of them either.
What does dB stand for? David Bowie? Donut
Boys? Dumb Band? They had a raw, rough edge to
their music, meaning that they didn't really know
how to play their instruments.
After the dß's exited to a sitting ovation, we
decided to sneak down into better seats closer to
the stage. In doing this I nearly dismembered a
woman who was in the row we were sneaking into,
but later she and her boyfriend got even by
smoking eight kilos of dope.
R.E.M.'s stage had modest lighting and a big
screen behind the stage where they could show
obscure images during their obscure lyrics. Singer
Michael Stipe is pretty weird, but he can sure belt
out those songs. He wore a Bono-like ponytail — I
think it's now a federal law that all singers must try
to look like Bono.
R.E.M. did some stuff from "Document," their
new album, as well as a lot of songs from their pre
vious albums. Although their commercially suc
cessful singles have been mostly tame (i.e., " The
One I Love"), they came across as a pretty hard
rockin band in concert. During "It's the End of the
World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine)," the
screen flashed rapid-fire images, including the
visage of (I'm dead serious) Mr. Spock. How Mr.
Spock relates to R.E.M.'s mysterious, southern
rooted lyrics is beyond me.
I give thumbs up to R.E.M. and thumbs down to
the audience. Not only was the crowd way too
quiet for a rock n roll concert, but they also did not
know how to dance. R.E.M. would be playing a
nice romantic slow song, and some high school
rocker chick next to me would be slam-dancing
with the back of my chair.
Saturday was U2. I'd say that I'm not a fan of U2
and find them horribly overrated, but then some
one might find this article in 20 years and force me
to resign my bid for the Supreme Court.
Basically, we did everything wrong in going to

the concert. First of all, we got to the stadium at
1:00 in the afternoon, which was way too early for a
5 p.m.concert. Here was our philosophy: If we get
there early, then we can be nearer to the stage.
Here is what we forgot: If we are near to the stage,
there will be 70,000 people trying to be in exactly
the same spot.
So we waited in line for two-and-a-half hours,
during which time we were privileged to watch 600
hibachis, 4000 kegs of beer, 92 frisbees, 18 foot
balls, 140,000 U2 Joshua free Tour official $17 T
shirts, and four unnatural acts performed by
drunken couples. At 3:30 p.m. we were allowed
into the stadium (I must say I was searched rather
perfunctorily at the door — I could have smuggled
in a small recording studio had I wanted to.), and
we waited on the grass for another hour and a half.
Everything was cool while we were sitting on the
grass, but as soon as a roadie who looked
moderately like Bono came on stage to adjust a
speaker, everybody jumped up and tried to move
closer.
We should have known right off that we were in
trouble. Promoter Bill Graham came out and an
nounced before the show that a makeshift hospital
had been set up by the third base dugout to take
care of the wounded and that "we should all remain
calm and enjoy the show." What were we getting
ready for; a concert or World War III?
The BoDeans came on right at 5 p.m., and they
put on a good half-hour set. I'd actually heard a
couple of their songs before, and I predict some big
things from them in the future. I give them thumbs
up.
Then the Pretenders came on, and all hell broke
loose. I was about 20 feet from the stage with three
hearty friends. Imagine, if you will, an entire
baseball field packed with people. Now, imagine
those people all trying to stand on my head at once.
Suddenly I was swept away from my friends, and
every so often I would bob up on a wave and see a
familiar face. I became panicky and started pushing
back, which really helped a whole lot. I wasn't
even facing the stage and couldn't hear what
Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders was singing. I
was drowning in a sea of U2 fans. What a way to
go.
Hynde is way too thin, but she still has a cool
voice and she even strums a little guitar. Ex-Smiths
guitarist Johnny Marr handled the lead plucking.
The Pretenders played some old favorites like
"Middle of the Road" and a lot of stuff off the
latest album, but my most lasting memory of the
Pretenders will be that they are the band I was lis
tening to when I was almost crushed to death. I
give them my broken thumbs up.
Finally, U2 came on at about 8 p.m. to a roaring
ovation. Their stage was pretty huge, with speakers
on either side covered by cloth painted with the
thorn bushes from the Joshua Tree. Bono was
wearing a cowboy hat that made him look
decidedly silly. As always. The Fldge, Adam and
Larry looked stylin'.
They launched into "Where the Streets Have No
Name," and by the time they had finished they
played the whole first side of "The Joshua Tree,"

as well as a lot of the old stuff like "Pride (In the
Name of Love)," " October," "Sunday, Bloody
Sunday" and much, much more. They pretty much

Bono does, however, have the niftiest accent this
side of Jim Kerr, and he brogued to the audience
frequently between songs.
As always, a screaming female managed to break

we waited on the grass for another hour and a half.
Everything was cool while we were sitting on the
grass, but as soon as a roadie who looked
moderately like Bono came on stage to adjust a
speaker, everybody jumped up and tried to move
closer.
We should have known right off that we were in
trouble. Promoter Bill Graham came out and an
nounced before the show that a makeshift hospital
had been set up by the third base dugout to take
care of the wounded and that "we should all remain
calm and enjoy the show." What were we getting
ready for; a concert or World War III?
The BoDeans came on right at 5 p.m., and they
put on a good half-hour set. I'd actually heard a
couple of their songs before, and I predict some big
things from them in the future. I give them thumbs
up.
Then the Pretenders came on, and all hell broke
loose. I was about 20 feet from the stage with three
hearty friends. Imagine, if you will, an entire
baseball field packed with people. Now, imagine
those people all trying to stand on my head at once.
Suddenly I was swept away from my friends, and
every so often I would bob up on a wave and see a
familiar face. I became panicky and started pushing
back, which really helped a whole lot. I wasn't
even facing the stage and couldn't hear what
Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders was singing. I
was drowning in a sea of U2 fans. What a way to
go.
Hynde is way too thin, but she still has a cool
voice and she even strums a little guitar. Ex-Smiths
guitarist Johnny Marr handled the lead plucking.
The Pretenders played some old favorites like
"Middle of the Road" and a lot of stuff off the
latest album, but my most lasting memory of the
Pretenders will be that they are the band I was lis
tening to when I was almost crushed to death. I
give them my broken thumbs up.
Finally, U2 came on at about 8 p.m. to a roaring
ovation. Their stage was pretty huge, with speakers
on either side covered by cloth painted with the
thorn bushes from the Joshua Tree. Bono was
wearing a cowboy hat that made him look
decidedly silly. As always. The Fldge, Adam and
Larry looked stylin'.
They launched into "Where the Streets Have No
Name," and by the time they had finished they
played the whole first side of "The Joshua Tree,"

as well as a lot of the old stuff like "Pride (In the
Name of Love)," " October," "Sunday, Bloody
Sunday" and much, much more. They pretty much
reproduced their album sound on stage, although
Bono sang some a cappella stuff and some oldies
but goodies from the 60s.
They Hew in from Canada the artist whose
sculpture Bono had defiled last week during their
free concert in San Francisco, and the guy spray
painted anti-war slogans onto the U2 set. It was a
pretty hokey moment.
Bono does, however, have the niftiest accent this
side of Jim Kerr, and he brogued to the audience
frequently between songs.
As always, a screaming female managed to break
through the huge stage guards and grab onto Bono.
I always find il amazing that these stagehands
could stop an Iranian terrorist team from getting
near the band, but a small hysterical female can get
through with ease. Just before the roadies could
pounce on her and rip her to shreds. Bono called
them off like a pack of dobermans. He hugged the

girl, kissed her and basically gave her the biggest
thrill of her life. The crowd was moved; she was to
tally paralyzed. I think her brain snapped when he
kissed her.
Meanwhile, the crowd up front continued to as
sault one another. It's kind of funny how the audi
ence chants anti-war slogans while at the same time
trying to kill each other. Somebody even managed
to throw a frisbee at the stage. Why you would
want to tell your grandchildren that you hit Adam
Clayton in the forehead with a Wham-O is beyond
me.
U2 finished the show after about two hours of
playing, and the crowd seemed decidedly satisfied.
Even though I wasn't a big U2 fan before 1 went, 1
left the show with a deeper respect and admiration
tor the band than before and an inner sense of
peace.
Then again, during the car ride home a
Pretenders song came on the radio, and I uncon
sciously tried to shove my date out the window.

Five bands in two days.
It has a sort of obscene ring to it. Kind of like
eighteen girls totally nude, or Pat Robertson for
president. Nevertheless, purely in the name of
journalism, I saw Jive bands in two days, and after
reading this review you'll feel as though you were
actually there. Come to think of it, with an esti
mated crowd of 3.4 million people at the U2 con
cert on Saturday, you probably were there.
Friday was the R.E.M. concert at the Oakland
C oliseum Arena, which is not to be confused with
the Oakland Coliseum Stadium. Here, for the first
time in print, is a guide to telling them apart:
I he Oakland Coliseum Arena is a big building off
Highway 880 in Oakland where sporting events and
concerts are held.
I he Oakland Coliseum Stadium is a big building
in Oakland off Highway 880 where sporting events
and concerts are held.
Save this indispensible guide for future refer
ence.
Friday's concert began with the warm-up band,
the dß's. No, I've never heard of them either.
What does dB stand for? David Bowie? Donut
Boys? Dumb Band? They had a raw, rough edge to
their music, meaning that they didn't really know
how to play their instruments.
After the dß's exited to a sitting ovation, we
decided to sneak down into better seats closer to
the stage. In doing this I nearly dismembered a
woman who was in the row we were sneaking into,
but later she and her boyfriend got even by
smoking eight kilos of dope.
R.E.M.'s stage had modest lighting and a big
screen behind the stage where they could show
obscure images during their obscure lyrics. Singer
Michael Stipe is pretty weird, but he can sure belt
out those songs. He wore a Bono-like ponytail — I
think it's now a federal law that all singers must try
to look like Bono.
R.E.M. did some stuff from "Document," their
new album, as well as a lot of songs from their pre
vious albums. Although their commercially suc
cessful singles have been mostly tame (i.e., " The
One I Love"), they came across as a pretty hard
rockin band in concert. During "It's the End of the
World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine)," the
screen flashed rapid-fire images, including the
visage of (I'm dead serious) Mr. Spock. How Mr.
Spock relates to R.E.M.'s mysterious, southern
rooted lyrics is beyond me.
I give thumbs up to R.E.M. and thumbs down to
the audience. Not only was the crowd way too
quiet for a rock n roll concert, but they also did not
know how to dance. R.E.M. would be playing a
nice romantic slow song, and some high school
rocker chick next to me would be slam-dancing
with the back of my chair.
Saturday was U2. I'd say that I'm not a fan of U2
and find them horribly overrated, but then some
one might find this article in 20 years and force me
to resign my bid for the Supreme Court.
Basically, we did everything wrong in going to

the concert. First of all, we got to the stadium at
1:00 in the afternoon, which was way too early for a
5 p.m.concert. Here was our philosophy: If we get
there early, then we can be nearer to the stage.
Here is what we forgot: If we are near to the stage,
there will be 70,000 people trying to be in exactly
the same spot.
So we waited in line for two-and-a-half hours,
during which time we were privileged to watch 600
hibachis, 4000 kegs of beer, 92 frisbees, 18 foot
balls, 140,000 U2 Joshua free Tour official $17 T
shirts, and four unnatural acts performed by
drunken couples. At 3:30 p.m. we were allowed
into the stadium (I must say I was searched rather
perfunctorily at the door — I could have smuggled
in a small recording studio had I wanted to.), and
we waited on the grass for another hour and a half.
Everything was cool while we were sitting on the
grass, but as soon as a roadie who looked
moderately like Bono came on stage to adjust a
speaker, everybody jumped up and tried to move
closer.
We should have known right off that we were in

guitarist Johnny Marr handled the lead plucking.
