## Snelson anchors Card offense 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
With 21 catches and three touch
downs at tight end for the Stanford
football team last season, senior Eric
Snelson was expected to play a key
role in the Cardinal's offense this year.
Heading into Saturday's Big Game,
however, Snelson has just five recep
tions on the season.
Although some might interpret this
to mean that Snelson has had a disap
pointing senior season, he has contrib
uted in other ways to the diverse Cardi
nal offense under Stanford Coach Jack
Elway. And with senior wide receiver
Jeff James unlikely to play Saturday,
Snelson could take on an even greater
offensive role against California.
"Statistics lie," said senior quarter
back Greg Ennis, who has played with
Snelson since they were both fresh
men. Ennis stressed that although
Snelson did not have a catch in Satur
day's 38-7 victory over Oregon State,

he played one of his best games ever.
"We must have run 35 sweeps in that
game because Eric had his man 15
yards off the line," Ennis said. "It's
rare to see a tight end dominate an
outside back like that."
An early-season injury is one reason
why Snelson's reception total this year
has not lived up to expectations. He
tore the ligaments in his left ankle after
making a catch on the fifth play of the
season opener Sept. 5 against Washing
ton.
The injury forced him to miss only
the Colorado game. Since that game,
Snelson has played with pain for much
of the season, often aggravating his in
juries in practices and games.
His left ankle is still swollen to twice
its normal size, but Snelson continues
to play because he believes in "just
playing if it's bearable."
Over the years Stanford's offense
has made extensive use of the tight
end. The short passing game has been a
trademark of the Cardinal offense, par

ticularly under Elway.
Eormer Cardinal Greg Baty — who
played for the New England Patriots
last season and is now on the Los An
geles Rams — and Snelson are exam
ples of good receiving tight ends who
have excelled in Elway's offensive
game plan.
As a consequence of the Cardinal's
success in passing to the tight end,
Stanford's Pacific 10 Conference rivals
have reshaped their defenses to at
tempt to eliminate the tight end's re
ceiving role.
This defensive reorientation partially
explains why Cardinal quarterbacks
have not been able to find either Snel
son or junior tight end Jim Price open
very often this season. Elway has also
often used three wide receivers this
year, further reducing Snelson's oppor
tunities to catch the ball.
Another factor contributing to Snel
son's low receiving total this year is the

season. Nevertheless, his powerful blocking ability makes him a bona fide NFL prospect.
Cardinal's inexperience at the
quarterback position. None of
the three quarterbacks Elway has
used this season had started a
Pac-10 game before this season,
and only Ennis had seen any ac
tion.
According to Stanford tight
end Coach Gary Gagnon, inexpe
rienced quarterbacks tend not to
throw to the tight end because
"it's easier to look for a wide
receiver." Gagnon feels that the
more experience sophomore
Brian Johnson gets at quarter
back, the more the tight ends will
get the ball.
Perhaps Snelson's finest con
tribution to the team has been his
blocking. Gagnon refers to Snel
son as "as good a blocking tight
end as there is." A tight end's job
is "equally important in the run
ning game as in the passing
game," Gagnon said.
Snelson said he "wanted to
contribute by catching the ball
this year," but added that block
ing is his "forte."
• In addition to his ability to
block effectively and catch the
ball, Snelson's qualities as a team
leader have been particularly im
portant for this year's inexperi
enced Cardinal.
Snelson is "very supportive in
the huddle," according to Ennis.
"He is always in control of his
situation and can help others."
"He leads by example and
works hard in practice," Gagnon
said.
Saturday's game against
archrival Cal "will not be Eric's
last as a football player," accord
ing to Ennis. Several pro scouts
have been looking at Snelson in
practice and have liked what they
have seen.
"I've practiced well and
caught a lot of balls in practice,"
Snelson said.
According to Gagnon, Snelson
will certainly have an opportu
nity to play pro ball, "either
through the draft or as a free
agent."
Ennis said he hopes the Stan
ford crowd will have an opportu
nity to see Snelson catch some
passes in Big Game. "No one has
seen him catch the ball and run
with it," Ennis said. "He just
carries people with him."
Even if Snelson does not make
a single reception against the
Golden Bears, he will undoubt
edly contribute to the Cardinal
offense in other ways as he has
for the Cardinal all season long.

Heading into Saturday's Big Game,
however, Snelson has just five recep
tions on the season.
Although some might interpret this
to mean that Snelson has had a disap
pointing senior season, he has contrib
uted in other ways to the diverse Cardi
nal offense under Stanford Coach Jack
Elway. And with senior wide receiver
Jeff James unlikely to play Saturday,
Snelson could take on an even greater
offensive role against California.
"Statistics lie," said senior quarter
back Greg Ennis, who has played with
Snelson since they were both fresh
men. Ennis stressed that although
Snelson did not have a catch in Satur
day's 38-7 victory over Oregon State,

he played one of his best games ever.
"We must have run 35 sweeps in that
game because Eric had his man 15
yards off the line," Ennis said. "It's
rare to see a tight end dominate an
outside back like that."
An early-season injury is one reason
why Snelson's reception total this year
has not lived up to expectations. He
tore the ligaments in his left ankle after
making a catch on the fifth play of the
season opener Sept. 5 against Washing
ton.
The injury forced him to miss only
the Colorado game. Since that game,
Snelson has played with pain for much
of the season, often aggravating his in
juries in practices and games.
His left ankle is still swollen to twice
its normal size, but Snelson continues
to play because he believes in "just
playing if it's bearable."
Over the years Stanford's offense
has made extensive use of the tight
end. The short passing game has been a
trademark of the Cardinal offense, par

ticularly under Elway.
Eormer Cardinal Greg Baty — who
played for the New England Patriots
last season and is now on the Los An
geles Rams — and Snelson are exam
ples of good receiving tight ends who
have excelled in Elway's offensive
game plan.
As a consequence of the Cardinal's
success in passing to the tight end,
Stanford's Pacific 10 Conference rivals
have reshaped their defenses to at
tempt to eliminate the tight end's re
ceiving role.
This defensive reorientation partially
explains why Cardinal quarterbacks
have not been able to find either Snel
son or junior tight end Jim Price open
very often this season. Elway has also
often used three wide receivers this
year, further reducing Snelson's oppor
tunities to catch the ball.
Another factor contributing to Snel
son's low receiving total this year is the


Catches like this one against Oregon State last year have been few and far between for senior tight end Eric Snelson (82) this
season. Nevertheless, his powerful blocking ability makes him a bona fide NFL prospect.
Cardinal's inexperience at the
quarterback position. None of
the three quarterbacks Elway has
used this season had started a
Pac-10 game before this season,
and only Ennis had seen any ac
tion.
According to Stanford tight
end Coach Gary Gagnon, inexpe
rienced quarterbacks tend not to
throw to the tight end because
"it's easier to look for a wide
receiver." Gagnon feels that the
more experience sophomore
Brian Johnson gets at quarter
back, the more the tight ends will
get the ball.
Perhaps Snelson's finest con
tribution to the team has been his
blocking. Gagnon refers to Snel
son as "as good a blocking tight
end as there is." A tight end's job
is "equally important in the run
ning game as in the passing
game," Gagnon said.
Snelson said he "wanted to
contribute by catching the ball
this year," but added that block
ing is his "forte."
• In addition to his ability to
block effectively and catch the
ball, Snelson's qualities as a team
leader have been particularly im
portant for this year's inexperi
enced Cardinal.
Snelson is "very supportive in
the huddle," according to Ennis.
"He is always in control of his
situation and can help others."
"He leads by example and
works hard in practice," Gagnon
said.
Saturday's game against
archrival Cal "will not be Eric's
last as a football player," accord
ing to Ennis. Several pro scouts
have been looking at Snelson in
practice and have liked what they
have seen.
"I've practiced well and
caught a lot of balls in practice,"
Snelson said.
According to Gagnon, Snelson
will certainly have an opportu
nity to play pro ball, "either
through the draft or as a free
agent."
Ennis said he hopes the Stan
ford crowd will have an opportu
nity to see Snelson catch some
passes in Big Game. "No one has
seen him catch the ball and run
with it," Ennis said. "He just
carries people with him."
Even if Snelson does not make
a single reception against the
Golden Bears, he will undoubt
edly contribute to the Cardinal
offense in other ways as he has
for the Cardinal all season long.
With 21 catches and three touch
downs at tight end for the Stanford
football team last season, senior Eric
Snelson was expected to play a key
role in the Cardinal's offense this year.
