## Snelson anchors Card offense 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
With 21 catches and three touch
downs at tight end for the Stanford
football team last season, senior Eric
Snelson was expected to play a key
role in the Cardinal's offense this year.
Heading into Saturday's Big Game,
however, Snelson has just five recep
tions on the season.
Although some might interpret this
to mean that Snelson has had a disap
pointing senior season, he has contrib
uted in other ways to the diverse Cardi
nal offense under Stanford Coach Jack
Elway. And with senior wide receiver
Jeff James unlikely to play Saturday,
Snelson could take on an even greater
offensive role against California.
"Statistics lie," said senior quarter
back Greg Ennis, who has played with
Snelson since they were both fresh
men. Ennis stressed that although
Snelson did not have a catch in Satur
day's 38-7 victory over Oregon State,

he played one of his best games ever.
"We must have run 35 sweeps in that
game because Eric had his man 15
yards off the line," Ennis said. "It's
rare to see a tight end dominate an
outside back like that."
An early-season injury is one reason
why Snelson's reception total this year
has not lived up to expectations. He
tore the ligaments in his left ankle after
making a catch on the fifth play of the
season opener Sept. 5 against Washing
ton.
The injury forced him to miss only
the Colorado game. Since that game,
Snelson has played with pain for much
of the season, often aggravating his in
juries in practices and games.
His left ankle is still swollen to twice
its normal size, but Snelson continues
to play because he believes in "just
playing if it's bearable."
Over the years Stanford's offense
has made extensive use of the tight
end. The short passing game has been a
trademark of the Cardinal offense, par

ticularly under Elway.
Eormer Cardinal Greg Baty — who
played for the New England Patriots
last season and is now on the Los An
geles Rams — and Snelson are exam
ples of good receiving tight ends who
have excelled in Elway's offensive
game plan.
As a consequence of the Cardinal's
success in passing to the tight end,
Stanford's Pacific 10 Conference rivals
have reshaped their defenses to at
tempt to eliminate the tight end's re
ceiving role.
This defensive reorientation partially
explains why Cardinal quarterbacks
have not been able to find either Snel
son or junior tight end Jim Price open
very often this season. Elway has also
often used three wide receivers this
year, further reducing Snelson's oppor
tunities to catch the ball.
Another factor contributing to Snel
son's low receiving total this year is the


Catches like this one against Oregon State last year have been few and far between for senior tight end Eric Snelson (82) this
season. Nevertheless, his powerful blocking ability makes him a bona fide NFL prospect.
