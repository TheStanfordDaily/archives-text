# A 						big slate of Big Games
## 
### 
Well, just about everything that can
be written about the Big Hype, as the
annual Stanford-California game is af
fectionately known, has already been
written — and written a hundred times.
"It makes or breaks the whole
season," and all that stuff. We hear it
all the time.

Of course it is an important game,
and a long, intense rivalry. But when
was the last time Big Game really meant
something?
The Oklahoma-Nebraska game Sat
urday, for instance, will determine the
No. 1 football team in the country.
Oklahoma was ranked No. 1 all year
until this week, when Nebraska moved
up to the top spot and swapped places
with the Sooners. This is a real rivalry.
"It's a typical OU-Nebraska game,"
said Brett Jones of the Oklahoma Daily.
"It's a showdown of two top-ranked
teams facing off in the most exciting
game in college football this season.
"It's the most intense rivalry we
have," Jones said of the 67-year series.
"It always pits the top two teams in the
conference. It's strange to have the top
two teams in the country in the same
conference."
"All during the week you see a real
intensity, " said Daily Nebraskan staf
fer Jeff Apel, who admits he's really an
Oklahoma fan. " The whole season is
based around this game."
This is a rivalry characterized by
respect rather than dislike, however.
"We hate Oklahoma State," Jones
said. "We have more respect for Ne
braska. We're both good teams with
good coaches. There are no bonfires or
out-of-control people running around."
That's more than you can say for the
UCLA-USC matchup. Tommy Trojan
may be the most victimized statue in
California. "He's all wrapped up now,"
said Larry McAlister of the Daily
Trojan. "You can only see his outline.
UCLA used to paint him blue and gold,
and he use to have a wooden sword, but
they took it."
Rumor has it that UCLA students
once even dumped paint on old Tommy
T. from a helicopter. USC has been
known to retaliate with the tried and
true method of releasing thousands of
mice in the UCLA library.
"There are fights in the game, but
there are a lot more fights in the
stands," McAlister said. "It's always
sold out and there are 92.0(H) people

there. It's definitely the most intense
rivalry west of the Mississippi. L.A. is
sports-crazy, and if you win, everybody
knows."
This year's version of the L.A.
Championship is nothing special. The
winner just goes to the Rose Bowl,
that's all. In fact, this is the 19th
meeting between the Trojans and
Bruins in which the winner of the game
gets to play in the "Granddaddy of
them all."
"This one is for all the marbles, and
all the players know it," said Daily
Briun staffer Tom Sullivan. "It's
definitely different from other rivalries,
like OU-Nebraska, because this one is
the only cross-town rivalry. It's a
friends and family thing, and you hear
about it all year long."
There's another rivalry you always
hear about, but nobody ever really
takes it seriously. The most traditional
matchup in the country: Harvard and
Yale.
Usually Harvard-Yale means about
as much to the Ivy League standings as
Oregon-Oregon State means to the Pac
-10 standings. But this year is different.
This year Harvard and Yale are
playing for . . . the Ivy League champi
onship — one of the more illustrious
titles in college football, what with pow
erhouses like Columbia in the same
conference. But hey, a division winner
is a division winner.
"This is the first time in ages the
game actually means something," said
Michael Lartigue of the Harvard Crim
son. "It would be even better if we
could win the Ivy League title by
beating Yale. Everyone is really
excited."
Lartigue described the ancient rivalry
between the Crimson and the Bulldogs
as "friendly," however. "We respect
each other," he said. "Afterwards we
go out and party together. We just for
get about the game. It's more important
to be friends."
Harvard and Yale means something
for once, but for the first time in a long
while, the Michigan-Ohio State game
means nothing. Nothing in terms of na
tional rankings or the Rose Bowl, that
is.
Although Michigan State has already
clinched the Big Ten Rose Bowl bid.
the great Michigan-Ohio State game is
fueled this year by something other
than conference rivalry. This week,
Ohio State announced the firing of
coach Earle Bruce — a man who went
80-26-1 in his nine years with the
Buckeyes — effective after this Satur
day's game. n •
"I have a bad feelirtg that Ohio State
will win to send Earle Bruce out on
top," said Scott Miller of the Michigan
Daily. "He'll be carried off on his
players' shoulders, laughing at the
people who fired him."

with the Sooners. This is a real rivalry.
"It's a typical OU-Nebraska game,"
said Brett Jones of the Oklahoma Daily.
"It's a showdown of two top-ranked
teams facing off in the most exciting
game in college football this season.
"It's the most intense rivalry we
have," Jones said of the 67-year series.
"It always pits the top two teams in the
conference. It's strange to have the top
two teams in the country in the same
conference."
"All during the week you see a real
intensity, " said Daily Nebraskan staf
fer Jeff Apel, who admits he's really an
Oklahoma fan. " The whole season is
based around this game."
This is a rivalry characterized by
respect rather than dislike, however.
"We hate Oklahoma State," Jones
said. "We have more respect for Ne
braska. We're both good teams with
good coaches. There are no bonfires or
out-of-control people running around."
That's more than you can say for the
UCLA-USC matchup. Tommy Trojan
may be the most victimized statue in
California. "He's all wrapped up now,"
said Larry McAlister of the Daily
Trojan. "You can only see his outline.
UCLA used to paint him blue and gold,
and he use to have a wooden sword, but
they took it."
Rumor has it that UCLA students
once even dumped paint on old Tommy
T. from a helicopter. USC has been
known to retaliate with the tried and
true method of releasing thousands of
mice in the UCLA library.
"There are fights in the game, but
there are a lot more fights in the
stands," McAlister said. "It's always
sold out and there are 92.0(H) people

there. It's definitely the most intense
rivalry west of the Mississippi. L.A. is
sports-crazy, and if you win, everybody
knows."
This year's version of the L.A.
Championship is nothing special. The
winner just goes to the Rose Bowl,
that's all. In fact, this is the 19th
meeting between the Trojans and
Bruins in which the winner of the game
gets to play in the "Granddaddy of
them all."
"This one is for all the marbles, and
all the players know it," said Daily
Briun staffer Tom Sullivan. "It's
definitely different from other rivalries,
like OU-Nebraska, because this one is
the only cross-town rivalry. It's a
friends and family thing, and you hear
about it all year long."
There's another rivalry you always
hear about, but nobody ever really
takes it seriously. The most traditional
matchup in the country: Harvard and
Yale.
Usually Harvard-Yale means about
as much to the Ivy League standings as
Oregon-Oregon State means to the Pac
-10 standings. But this year is different.
This year Harvard and Yale are
playing for . . . the Ivy League champi
onship — one of the more illustrious
titles in college football, what with pow
erhouses like Columbia in the same
conference. But hey, a division winner
is a division winner.
"This is the first time in ages the
game actually means something," said
Michael Lartigue of the Harvard Crim
son. "It would be even better if we
could win the Ivy League title by
beating Yale. Everyone is really
excited."
Lartigue described the ancient rivalry
between the Crimson and the Bulldogs
as "friendly," however. "We respect
each other," he said. "Afterwards we
go out and party together. We just for
get about the game. It's more important
to be friends."
Harvard and Yale means something
for once, but for the first time in a long
while, the Michigan-Ohio State game
means nothing. Nothing in terms of na
tional rankings or the Rose Bowl, that
is.
Although Michigan State has already
clinched the Big Ten Rose Bowl bid.
the great Michigan-Ohio State game is
fueled this year by something other
than conference rivalry. This week,
Ohio State announced the firing of
coach Earle Bruce — a man who went
80-26-1 in his nine years with the
Buckeyes — effective after this Satur
day's game. n •
"I have a bad feelirtg that Ohio State
will win to send Earle Bruce out on
top," said Scott Miller of the Michigan
Daily. "He'll be carried off on his
players' shoulders, laughing at the
people who fired him."

Well, just about everything that can
be written about the Big Hype, as the
annual Stanford-California game is af
fectionately known, has already been
written — and written a hundred times.
"It makes or breaks the whole
season," and all that stuff. We hear it
all the time.

Of course it is an important game,
and a long, intense rivalry. But when
was the last time Big Game really meant
something?
The Oklahoma-Nebraska game Sat
urday, for instance, will determine the
No. 1 football team in the country.
Oklahoma was ranked No. 1 all year
until this week, when Nebraska moved
up to the top spot and swapped places
with the Sooners. This is a real rivalry.
