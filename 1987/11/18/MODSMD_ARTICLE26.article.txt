# Fortune cashing in on Olympic future
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
As is the case with most diffi
cult decisions, there's an up side
and a down side to senior Scott
Fortune's choice to take a year
off from Stanford and attempt to
make the U.S. Olympic volley
ball team. *
The bad news for the Stanford
men's volleyball team is that it
will be without the services of
perhaps its best player this
season. The good news from
Fortune's vantage point is that he
stands an excellent chance of
joining the long line of Stanford
Olympians.
"I miss Stanford very much,
that's for sure," Fortune said.
"But 1 talked to a lot of guys on
the team who told me to go for it.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
chance."
Although Fortune is taking a
year off from school, he is by no
means taking it easy. Trying to
make an Olympic team is a de
manding process.
Fortune practices four hours a
day with the Olympic team, from
8 a.m. to noon. In the evenings,
three days a week, team mem
bers lift weights to improve their
strength.
In addition to training for the
team, most squad members work
at internships that Olympic pro
gram hfclps sponsor. Fortune is
planning to intern with an invest
ment banking firm.
Another aspect of being a
member of an Olympic team is
having to travel. Fortune and the
team recently departed for a
three-week tour of Asia, includ
ing a stop in South Korea, the
site of next year's Summer
Olympics.
In August, the U.S. team
traveled to the Soviet Union and
also toured the western United
States with the Soviet national
team. According to Fortune, the
U.S. team "gets along with the
Soviet team better than anyone."
Fortune thinks his chances of
making the Olympic squad are
excellent. He is a middle blocker,
a position that is in great demand
heading into the Olympics. There
are five players tryng out for the
spot, and the team will probably
take four. Fortune sees himself
as one of the top contenders.
"I've been subbing in for one
of the starters," he said, "and I
expect to push him for the start
ing jobv'

Coach Fred Sturm also believes
Fortune will make the team.
Sturm said she rates Fortune's
chances highly because of the
athlete's powerful attitude
toward the game and his natural
playing ability.
"He was one of the top three
or four players in the country last
year," Sturm said. "His attitude
makes him great. He never gives
up or lets up."
According to Sturm, Fortune
will be a particularly strong asset
to the Olympic team because he
"outworks everybody, gives
maximum effort and is the con
summate team player."
Whether or not he participates
in the Olympics, Fortune plans
"to come right back in 1988-
1989" to play for Stanford and
finish his athletic and academic
career.

fc He was one of the
top three or four
players in the
country last year.
His attitude makes
him great. He never
gives or lets up.'
— Fred Sturm

Fortune's domestic and inter
national experiences this year
will undoubtedly enhance his
ability, regardless of whether he
makes the Olympic team. While
playing on the national team, he
is playing with older, more
internationally-experienced
players. Sturnj and the Stanford
team will undoubtedly profit
from his return next season.
"The biggest difference
(between playing at Stanford and
on the Olympic team) is competi
tion," Fortune said. "You have
to play well the whole time be
cause there is always someone to
replace you. Next year, college
play might seem slow (in compar
ison)."
Until next year, however,
Stanford volleyball fans should
turn their eyes south, because
they might see a future Olympian
in Scott Fortune.
