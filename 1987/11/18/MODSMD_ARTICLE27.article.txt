Construction of a controversial
$18.1-million annex to the Gradu
ate School of Business (GSB) is
on schedule and will be com
pleted this April, according to
Cathy Castillo, GSB spokesper
son.
The Edmund W. Littlefield
Center, named for the alumnus
who is the principal donor for the
project, will provide space for
100 faculty offices, as well as

classrooms, seminar rooms and
meeting rooms for the University
Board of Trustees, according to
GSB Associate Dean Paul
Johnson.
Art Prof. Paul Turner and the
Stanford Historical Society have
criticized the planned addition
because of its impact on the
once-symmetrical architecture of
the University's formal entrance.
After the project was approved
by the trustees in 1984, Turner,
an expert on the history of Amer

ican campus design, told Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
that the annex was "a grave
threat to the physical integrity of
the campus." The Stanford His
torical Society board of directors
also unanimously criticized the
building site because "it im
pairs" the original plan created
for the University by Leland
Stanford and noted landscape ar
chitect Frederick Law Olmsted.
According to Turner, the plan
"designated the area between

Lassen Street and Lomita Drive
as park land â€” a great front gar
den, in effect, spanning the full
width of the Outer Quad."
Crossing Lassen "would destroy
the integrity of this park land
(and) set the worst kind of prece
dent," Turner said.
University Planning Director
Phil Williams acknowledged that
the building site is controversial
but said the site was the result of
"competing interests, all of
which can't be met."
