# Former budget director
## Stockman predicts economic disaster 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
"Devastating collapses" in the eco
nomy within the next three years will
make the Oct. 19 stock market crash
"look like spring training," David Stock
man, former director of the Office of
Management and Budget predicted yes
terday.
Speaking before approximately 300
students at the Graduate School of Busi
ness, Stockman described the Reagan ad
ministration's fiscal policies as "so mis
guided that future historians will shake
their heads and wonder how a great
democracy such as ours went on such a
free lunch binge."
Stockman traced the root of the
country's economic problems to the 1981
Kemp-Roth tax cut, calling it a "gigantic
policy mistake."
"It was simply one of those events
where the system collectively lost its
sanity for a short period of time," he
said.
The bill cut $2 trillion from the national
tax base, according to Stockman, who
noted that "there was not the remotest

chance that a commensurate reduction
would occur on spending side."
Stockman said subsequent attempts to
counter the tax cut with spending reduc
tions proved futile because "everything
was put on the table except taxes and So
cial Security.
"A compromise was reached that we
wouldn't do anything. It was never indi
cated to the taxpayers that if you want to
have ,all of this garbage, you're going to
have to pay for it,"he said.
According to Stockman, efforts to cut
spending are often nothing more than
bookkeeping adjustments. One example
he cited and criticized involved postpon
ing payments to the military's civilian
employees until the next fiscal year.
"These are accounting measures, not
policy measures. There is no consistency
or logic or theory to these policies. They
just swing from one extreme to another."
Stockman pointed to three major
trends that contributed to the "fun
damental instability" in the current eco
nomic system.
The first is the federal budget deficit.
