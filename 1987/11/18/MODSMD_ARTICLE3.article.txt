# Former budget director
## Stockman predicts economic disaster 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
"Devastating collapses" in the eco
nomy within the next three years will
make the Oct. 19 stock market crash
"look like spring training," David Stock
man, former director of the Office of
Management and Budget predicted yes
terday.
Speaking before approximately 300
students at the Graduate School of Busi
ness, Stockman described the Reagan ad
ministration's fiscal policies as "so mis
guided that future historians will shake
their heads and wonder how a great
democracy such as ours went on such a
free lunch binge."
Stockman traced the root of the
country's economic problems to the 1981
Kemp-Roth tax cut, calling it a "gigantic
policy mistake."
"It was simply one of those events
where the system collectively lost its
sanity for a short period of time," he
said.
The bill cut $2 trillion from the national
tax base, according to Stockman, who
noted that "there was not the remotest

chance that a commensurate reduction
would occur on spending side."
Stockman said subsequent attempts to
counter the tax cut with spending reduc
tions proved futile because "everything
was put on the table except taxes and So
cial Security.
"A compromise was reached that we
wouldn't do anything. It was never indi
cated to the taxpayers that if you want to
have ,all of this garbage, you're going to
have to pay for it,"he said.
According to Stockman, efforts to cut
spending are often nothing more than
bookkeeping adjustments. One example
he cited and criticized involved postpon
ing payments to the military's civilian
employees until the next fiscal year.
"These are accounting measures, not
policy measures. There is no consistency
or logic or theory to these policies. They
just swing from one extreme to another."
Stockman pointed to three major
trends that contributed to the "fun
damental instability" in the current eco
nomic system.
The first is the federal budget deficit.

which Stockman said has
"careened out of control." He
said legislators have only had "a
big debate about one percent
marginalia, which means the
problem isn't going to be cor
rected."
"I guess I've been on Wall
Street long enough to believe that
you probably ought to pay the in
terest on the public debt," he
said.
The second trend, which
Stockman called the "money
creation binge," results from the
national deficit. He said that be
cause the United States has such
a large debt, it has increased the
production of its currency to
keep interest rates low.
Stockman said this trend has
"driven the world system to a
level of liquidity," prompting
other nations to increase their
production of currency to keep
up with the United States.
"One of the great dangers of
this is the creation of an environ
ment in which a large mistake
could happen," he said. "The
longer this goes on, the more
likely it will happen."
The third trend is a "binge of
borrowing," Stockman said. He

noted that in six years, the
United States has reversed its
status from being the largest
creditor i. .tion (having $180 bil
lion in loans) to the largest debtor
nation.
"There is so much momentum
in this trend that the debt is cer
tain to be $800 billion by the end
of this decade," he said.
Stockman added that the real
problem arises from the fact that
the United States does not have
the domestic manufacturing
capacity to increase exports and
reverse the trend.
"It's not feasible to believe
that we can export our way out of
it, because most of our industry
is already operating at 95 percent
capacity," he said. "The only
way it's going to happen is by a
staggering reduction in imported
goods. We've been living way
beyond our means, especially in
the public sector."
When asked which of the pres
idential candidates he felt could
best repair the economy, Stock
man responded that he "would
move to New Zealand' if Rep.
Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) were
nominated.
He endorsed Sen. Robert Dole
(R-Kan.) for the Republicans and
Sen. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) for
the Democrats.

tax base, according to Stockman, who
noted that "there was not the remotest

chance that a commensurate reduction
would occur on spending side."
Stockman said subsequent attempts to
counter the tax cut with spending reduc
tions proved futile because "everything
was put on the table except taxes and So
cial Security.
"A compromise was reached that we
wouldn't do anything. It was never indi
cated to the taxpayers that if you want to
have ,all of this garbage, you're going to
have to pay for it,"he said.
According to Stockman, efforts to cut
spending are often nothing more than
bookkeeping adjustments. One example
he cited and criticized involved postpon
ing payments to the military's civilian
employees until the next fiscal year.
"These are accounting measures, not
policy measures. There is no consistency
or logic or theory to these policies. They
just swing from one extreme to another."
Stockman pointed to three major
trends that contributed to the "fun
damental instability" in the current eco
nomic system.
The first is the federal budget deficit.

which Stockman said has
"careened out of control." He
said legislators have only had "a
big debate about one percent
marginalia, which means the
problem isn't going to be cor
rected."
"I guess I've been on Wall
Street long enough to believe that
you probably ought to pay the in
terest on the public debt," he
said.
The second trend, which
Stockman called the "money
creation binge," results from the
national deficit. He said that be
cause the United States has such
a large debt, it has increased the
production of its currency to
keep interest rates low.
Stockman said this trend has
"driven the world system to a
level of liquidity," prompting
other nations to increase their
production of currency to keep
up with the United States.
"One of the great dangers of
this is the creation of an environ
ment in which a large mistake
could happen," he said. "The
longer this goes on, the more
likely it will happen."
The third trend is a "binge of
borrowing," Stockman said. He

noted that in six years, the
United States has reversed its
status from being the largest
creditor i. .tion (having $180 bil
lion in loans) to the largest debtor
nation.
"There is so much momentum
in this trend that the debt is cer
tain to be $800 billion by the end
of this decade," he said.
Stockman added that the real
problem arises from the fact that
the United States does not have
the domestic manufacturing
capacity to increase exports and
reverse the trend.
"It's not feasible to believe
that we can export our way out of
it, because most of our industry
is already operating at 95 percent
capacity," he said. "The only
way it's going to happen is by a
staggering reduction in imported
goods. We've been living way
beyond our means, especially in
the public sector."
When asked which of the pres
idential candidates he felt could
best repair the economy, Stock
man responded that he "would
move to New Zealand' if Rep.
Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) were
nominated.
He endorsed Sen. Robert Dole
(R-Kan.) for the Republicans and
Sen. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) for
the Democrats.

"look like spring training," David Stock
man, former director of the Office of
Management and Budget predicted yes
terday.
Speaking before approximately 300
students at the Graduate School of Busi
ness, Stockman described the Reagan ad
ministration's fiscal policies as "so mis
guided that future historians will shake
their heads and wonder how a great
democracy such as ours went on such a
free lunch binge."
Stockman traced the root of the
country's economic problems to the 1981
Kemp-Roth tax cut, calling it a "gigantic
policy mistake."
"It was simply one of those events
where the system collectively lost its
sanity for a short period of time," he
said.
The bill cut $2 trillion from the national
tax base, according to Stockman, who
noted that "there was not the remotest

chance that a commensurate reduction
would occur on spending side."
Stockman said subsequent attempts to
counter the tax cut with spending reduc
tions proved futile because "everything
was put on the table except taxes and So
