# University honors Native Americans
## 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
In symbolic recognition of
Americans Indians' contribu
tions to the United States, Stan
ford campus leaders gathered
yesterday to address the Univer
sity's obligations to this histori
cally oppressed minority.
At a news conference outside
the Native American Cultural
Center, Director of United Cam
pus Christian Ministry Byron
Bland said that Stanford students
have a "moral and civic respon
sibility to rediscover our mutual
heritage with American Indian
people and to inform ourselves
about treaties, promises and
agreements that have been
made."
Bland read a prepared state
ment, signed by several campus
leaders, including University
President Donald Kennedy,
which called for greater study of
the principles upon which trea
ties and agreements with Ameri
can Indians have been based and
how they would apply to current
public policy.

Bland said he hoped to high
light the obligation Stanford has
to American Indians before
American Indian Week —
declared by Congress — begins
Nov. 22, and also before this
weekend's Big Game, because
awareness of the American In
dian — Stanford's former mascot
— is highest at this time of year.
Arvol Looking Horse, the
Keeper of the Sacred Buffalo-
Calf Pipe of the Sioux Nations,
said he had a positive feeling
about recent efforts to raise
public awareness of Native
American issues.
"It is really a strong movement
in spirituality. I feel it's a good
step," said Looking Horse, who
was visiting Stanford from South
Dakota as part of the "You Can
Make a Difference" conference.
"When I feel good inside, 1 know
everything is good.-That's the
way 1 feel."
David Josephson, a former
visiting professor and organizer
of a decentralized national edu
cation project called "Indians,
Promises, and Us," also spoke at
the news conference.
In conjuction with American
Indian Week, Josephson asked
Stanford students to:
• Use the Thanksgiving meal to
remind themselves that there was
a flourishing culture already here
when Europeans arrived and that
the Pilgrims' survival was depen
dent upon a sustained and sup
portive relationship with Ameri

can Indians;
• Reflect on the lack of knowl
edge concerning the principles
upon which promises, agree
ments and treaties with Ameri
can Indians were based;
• Begin an education process
over the next year to discover the
nation's responsibilities for
agreements made with American
Indians.
Reading from the statement.
Bland said. "We, the President
of Stanford University, the dean
of Memorial Church, the dean of
Student Affairs, the directors of
the Public Service Center and
Residential Education, campus

ministers and concerned Univer
sity citizens, urge people at Stan
ford and elsewhere to a deeper
consideration of cur full national
history and the continuing obliga
tions to American Indians."
Vice President and Provost
James Rosse, representing Ken
nedy, endorsed the statement at
the press conference. Among the
other Stanford administrators
who attended the gathering were:
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons; Dean of Memorial
Church Robert Gregg; Dean of
Campus Affairs Michael Jack
son; Timothy Stanton of the
Public Service Center.
