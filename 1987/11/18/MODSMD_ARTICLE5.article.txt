# Fetter returns from European tour
## 
### Bobby Schrader Staff writer 
Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions Jean Fetter returned
from Europe Sunday after com
pleting a seven-country tour of
European secondary schools
with admissions officers from
five other American colleges.
Fetter traveled with admis
sions officers from Williams
College, Carleton College,
Duke University, Columbia
University and Wesleyan Uni
versity, and visited schools in
Austria, Belgium, England,
France, Italy, Switzerland and
West Germany.
The trip, organized this year
by Carleton Associate Dean of
Admissions Henry Wittman,
sought to provide European and
expatriate American students
with information about the
American university system
and the educational opportuni
ties available to foreigners in
American schools.
Although Stanford has partic
ipated in similar outreach pro
grams to Europe since 1983,
Fetter initially opposed the idea

of making the trip this year.
"My first instinct was to say
no. . . . While these trips were
informative on a number of
counts, it's hard to justify
making that kind of a commit
ment of time and money to do it
each time."
However, Fetter dropped her
reservations because Stanford
was the only West Coast school
invited to participate in the
tour, and the trip provided
other opportunities aside from
student recruitment. Fetter said
the trip was an ideal opportu
nity to re-establish alumni con
tacts in Europe, as well as to in
crease Stanford's international
visibility.
Fetter, who visited alumni in
London, Paris and Rome, said
"the trip was a nice way of
keeping in touch with people.
You know, the Stanford family
doesn't stop when you graduate
from here. One of my responsi
bilities as an officer of the Uni
versity that goes beyond admis
sions is talking to friends of the
Stanford family."
When asked why she partici
pated in a program that focused

exclusively on recruiting
European students as opposed
to targeting students from de
veloping countries or upgrading
domestic minority recruitment.
Fetter said the trip was "not
mutually exclusive to our other
recruiting responsibilities.
"With this trip I merely took
advantage of an opportunity
which was extended to me. We

are doing as much as we can to
attack the problem of encourag
ing students to consider Stan
ford from a number of different
angles," she said.
Fetter stressed that foreign
students represent an essential
ingredient in making the under
graduate environment at Stan
ford as challenging and dynamic
as possible. "One of the
benefits of being at Stanford is
the diversity of the student
body, and 1 think we should
take advantage of any opportu
nity we get to enhance that di
versity."
Fetter noted that American
universities are gaining a
broader-based appeal in Europe
because of fundamental differ
ences in the educational philos
ophy and structure of higher ed
ucation in the United States as
compared to higher education
in Europe.
"One of the dramatic differ
ences, and 1 can say this with
authority, having been ed
ucated in Oxford myself, is that
liberal arts education is viewed
differently," Fetter said.
