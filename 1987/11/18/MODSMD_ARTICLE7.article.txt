## DATELINE 
### 
Gorbachev will address Congress
WASHINGTON — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has
been invited to address a joint meeting of Congress on Dec. 9
during his summit with President Reagan, congressional and
White House officials said yesterday.
A White House official who asked not to be identified said the
Gorbachev address was conditioned on Soviet acceptance of a
U.S. position that Reagan be allowed to make "a reciprocal
speech' to the Soviet people on television "during the same
general time frame ' The official said that House Majority
Leader Jim Wright (D-Tex.) and Senate Majority Leader Robert
Byrd (D-W.Va.) agreed with the White House condition and
praised the Democratic leaders for their cooperation.
The official! said agreement on the two speeches would not
formally become "a done deal" until the Soviets accepted the
invitation for Gorbachev to address the joint meeting, but he
added, "We don't expect any problem." The plan calls for Gor
bachev to speak at 10 a.m. on Dec. 9, which would be 6 p.m. in
Moscow, the time requested by Soviet officials in pre-summit
discussions with their U.S. counterparts.
The Gorbachev address would be the first ever made by a
Communist leader to a joint meeting of Congress. It was an
nounced on Capitol Hill by Wilson Morris, a spokesman for
Wright, who said the White House had requested the joint
meeting.
Negotiators will pare entitlements
WASHINGTON — White House and congressional budget
negotiators, prevented by a stubborn political calculus from cut
ting federal retirement benefits, worked late into last night in
search of additional savings from entitlement programs that are
the key to a deficit-reduction accord.
As the high-level talks, spurred by the Oct. 19 stock-market
plunge, continued into their 17th day without producing a con
crete result, negotiators on both sides faced increasing pressure
to conclude an agreement by Friday, when otherwise $23 billion
in across-the-board spending cuts will take effect, as mandated
by the revised balanced-budget law.
"We have no choice but to put it together," said Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen (D-Texas), chairman of the Finance Committee. "We
have to show the president and Congress can work together,
otherwise the psychological fallout on financial markets will be
very bad."
One participant said Treasury Secretary James Baker 111 had
repeatedly made similar warnings during the discussions this
week.
White House officials said they did not think that an accord
could be reached quickly and expressed concern about an addi
tional negative response by financial markets if there is no
agreement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 stocks fell
26.85 points yesterday.
Although negotiators remained only about $2 billion shy of an
agreement that would reduce this year's deficit by about $30 bil
lion, that gap remained a major impediment.
Arms envoys ready summit treaty
GENEVA — Top U.S. and Soviet negotiators yesterday
ended three days of intensive talks aimed at resolving lingering
differences over an intermediate-range missile treaty, and senior
officials on both sides said they expected the pact to be ready
fot sJgjning at the December summit meeting between President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
Chief Soviet negotiator Yuli Vorontsov said after meeting his
U.S. counterpart. Max Kampelman, that the treaty text should
be completed by next Monday. U.S. officials said they were un
aware that such a deadline had been fixed.
A senior U.S. official said there had been "substantial prog
ress" in the talks here and that he had "no reason to doubt" that
the treaty would be completed in time to be signed by Reagan
and Gorbachev when they meet in Washington Dec. 7-10.
The meetings here, which began Sunday evening, yielded
"helpful movement" in resolving the timing and phasing of
reductions in missile forces, another U.S. official said.
Nevertheless, several U.S. officials cautioned that a substan
tial amount of work on verification issues remained to be com
pleted before the treaty would be ready. One suggested that the .
pact would not be completed as scheduled unless the Soviets
soon showed greater "flexibility" on measures sought by the
United States to guard against cheating.
Reagan responds to Walsh's queries
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, aided by his staff, is
drafting responses to a list of written questions posed by inde
pendent counsel Lawrence Walsh on the president's recollec
tions about the Iran-contra affair, the White House said yester
day.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that Reagan
was complying voluntarily with Walsh's request for information
for use in the-Criminal cases the special prosecutor is preparing
in the scandal. Fitzwater stressed that Reagan was not a target
of the probe.
I he presidential spokesman said that Reagan received the
questions last month and is answering them in sworn responses
that carry the same legal standing as a deposition delivered un
der oath.
A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the responses were arranged as part of an agreement that
would, at least for the time being, allow Reagan to avoid a face
to-face interrogation by Walsh and his investigators.
Fitzwater said no specific agreement was reached about fu
ture questioning of the president. "There were no deals associ
ated with it, no indication of whether or not the independent
counsel wants any further examination or interviews," he said.
Crash investigators focus on icing
DENVER — Ice accumulating on the wings became a central
focus yesterday of federal investigators trying to determine why
a Continental Airlines jetliner crashed on takeoff during a
snowstorm Sunday, killing 27.
I he plane was a DC-9 Model 10 built in 1966. National Trans
portation Safety Board Chairman Jim Burnett said the board's
staff had noted months ago that such older-model DC-9s were
especially vulnerable to icing, as the result of their wing design.
I he early models were built without "slats", surface exten
sions of the leading edge of the wings that give added lift on
takeoff. Slats were added on later models.
I here have been at least three DC-9 accidents in recent years
in which icing was found to have been a contributing factor.
Burnett also said that the plane involved in Sunday's ill-fated
flight 1713 had waited on the ground in sub-freezing tempera
tures for more than 20 minutes after de-icing before the takeoff
attempt was made.
He noted that the board at one time had considered recom
mending that icing checks be made at intervals of no more than
7,0 minutes.
