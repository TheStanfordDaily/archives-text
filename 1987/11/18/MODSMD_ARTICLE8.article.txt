# Report faults Reagan's knowledge
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The congressional
Iran-contra committees, in their final report
to be released today, refuse to exonerate
President Reagan of complicity in the diver
sion of profits from the Iran arms sales to the
Nicaraguan rebels, according to committee
members.
The committees' 500-page majority report,
signed by 15 Democrats and three
Republicans, will argue that the president
should have known about the diversion of
$3.8 million to the contras and will leave open
the question of whether he actually did know.
The president has repeatedly asserted that
he did not know about the diversion, and
John Poindexter, his former national security
adviser, told the committees in July that he
authorized then-White House aide Oliver
North to divert money to the contras from the
Iran arms sale without ever telling the presi
dent.
The issue of whether Reagan knew about
the diversion has long been considered to be
the central issue of the Iran-contra scandal.

and Poindexter's testimony was widely
viewed at the time as the final word on the
subject.
Committee members said yesterday that
the report asserts that the profits from U.S.
arms sales to Iran belonged to the IKS. Trea
sury and that there was no legal basis for
diverting any of them to Nicaragua's contra
rebels. The Treasury is also entitled to the ap
proximately $11 million in arms sale profits
still sitting in Swiss bank accounts controlled
by Iranian-American businessman Albert
Hakim, according to the report.
In addition, committee members said, the
majority report will conclude:
• That former CIA Director William Casey
clearly approved the creation of an "off-the
shelf, privately funded covert operations"
unit outside of the CIA.
• That Reagan violated the Constitution by
encouraging third-country donations to the
contras.
• That administration officials carried out a
"systematic cover-up" of the Iran-contra af

fair in late 1986, as the first details became
public.
Those key points came to light yesterday
when a portion of the committees' minority
report, signed by eight of its Republican
members, was publicly released. The infor
mation was later confirmed by other sources
within the committee majority.
Minority members strongly objected to the
report by the committees' 18-member
majority on grounds that it drew highly par
tisan conclusions that go beyond the
evidence.
"That report is a raw political document,"
said Rep. Henry Hyde (R-lll.), a member of
the minority. "What boggles my mind is how
three Republicans could have signed it."
The three Republicans are Sens. Warren
Rudman of New Hampshire, Paul Trible of
Virginia and William Cohen of Maine.
The dissenters particularly criticized the
majority's unwillingness to clear Reagan of
any involvement in the diversion.
