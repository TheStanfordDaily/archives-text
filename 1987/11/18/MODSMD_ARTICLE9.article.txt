# Shultz, Wright achieve consensus
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — House
Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas)
and Secretary of State George
Shultz signed an agreement yes
terday promising to put behind
them their disagreements over
Wright's meetings last week with
Nicaraguan leaders.
"The speaker and I — as is
well known — had a little tiff, as
sometimes happens in
democracies like ours. . . . Both
of us felt that the important thing
now is to look ahead and focus
on the things we agree on,"
Shultz told reporters.
Seeming to replicate the for
mality of the diplomatic process
in Central America, Wright and
Shultz signed their own six-point

peace plan aimed at restoring
tranquility between the Demo
cratic speaker and the Republi
can administration. Among its
provisions: "Neither one of us
want to create unnecessary prob
lems. We want to work together
to bring about solutions."
However, it was unclear
whether the two sides agreed on
the meaning of their pact.
A State Department spokes
man called the agreement
"basically a restoration of the
status quo, with the secretary in
charge of foreign policy and bi
partisan support for that policy."
The spokesman noted that one
point of the agreement signed by
the two men stipulates that

Central American peace negotia
tions should be conducted mainly
by Central Americans, some
thing the White House un
derlined in criticizing Wright's
meetings with Nicaraguan Presi
dent Daniel Ortega last week.
But when Wright was asked
whether he had agreed not to
meet again with Nicaraguan
leaders, he only grinned. A
source close to Wright said that
he had not made any such deal
and added that the speaker still
planned to travel to Costa Rica
Dec. 1, as he had previously an
nounced.
Wright and Shultz said that
their unusual agreement was
mediated by Democratic political

strategist Robert Strauss.
Even before the agreement
was announced, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
took pains to play down any
animosity between the adminis
tration and the speaker.
"The war's over. The war's
over," he told reporters at mid
day, turning aside repeated ef
forts to prod him into disclosing
President Reagan's opinions of
Wright's efforts.
Reagan and Shultz had con
fronted Wright at a White House
meeting Monday, complaining
that the speaker should not be in
jecting himself into the peace
process.
