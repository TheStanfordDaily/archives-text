Ink Bowl '87
• Attention staffers: Eat your Wheaties and knot up
your cleats and come help The Daily beat The Daily
Californian and recapture that vaunted symbol of
cross-Bay journalistic rivalry, the Exacto Axe.
Kickoff is slated for 10 a.m., Saturday, Nov. 21, at
Roble Field. Food and drink aplenty will be provided
through the generousity of the Friends of The Daily.
• As if all that weren't enough: The Ink Bowl will also
mark the triumphant return of "Killer" John Lis, a
legend of Daily sportswriting and one of the most
decorated soldiers of the intramural battlefields.
Come meet John. And like him.
• Also: All staffers and Daily alums are invited, urged
and exhorted to attend The Daily's Big Game Happy
Hour, at 5 p.m. Friday. John Freed, a former Daily
editor now with The New York Times, will be in at
tendance. You should be. too.
Be there!
