MAKE A PILGRIMAGE TO
MAC ARTHUR PARK
THIS THANKSGIVING.
iW \bu know what our oakwood smoker does to ribs.
Imagine what it would do to turkey. Juicy white meat,
smokey and savory, with crispy golden skin.
And we know that turkey, no matter how
beautifully prepared wouldn't be tine same without suitable
accompaniments. Homemade bread stuffing, rich giblet
gravy, gently simmered cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie made
from fresh pumpkin, not cans.
Sound like a great Thanksgiving.' Turkey s ready starting
at 2:00. And if you're absolutely devoted to our ribs, we
wont turn you away. pARR
