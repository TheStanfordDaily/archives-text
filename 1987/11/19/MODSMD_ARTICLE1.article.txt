# Cal prank smokes campus

Two homemade smoke bombs in blue back
packs exploded in White Plaza yesterday after
noon in what Stanford officials said was proba
bly a Big Game-related prank.
One bomb spewed yellow while the other dis
charged blue smoke, staining nearby wails sur
rounding the Claw fountain.
Hours after the bombs went off Stanford
safety officials cordoned off the entire area be
tween the Bookstore and Old Union because
they feared the backpacks still contained
"explosive devices."
According to witnesses, the smoke bombs
went off near the Claw at about 1:30 p.m. yester
day. The Palo Alto Fire Department received a
call but decided not to respond when the caller
described the event as "just a smoke bomb,"
firefighter Rich Dean said.
An hour-and-a-half later, Stanford Police were
called to check out a backpack on the ledge of
the fountain that "had a chemical smell and was
corroding." The caller, who refused to give her
name, told The Daily she was concerned be

cause her three children were playing near the
backpack.
When Stanford police officers arrived they
found a second backpack in a garbage can near
the corner of the fountain. Deputy Timothy
Schreiner pulled the backpack out of the garbage
can and set it on top.
Fire officials arrived on the scene shortly
thereafter and called Stanford Health and Safety
officials to remove the backpacks as a precau
tionary measure.
"We know the bombs have expended. We're
not worried about cordoning off the area â€” it
would only draw attention," said Fire Capt.
Dale Hopkins.
Jennifer Gates, a Health and Safety risk man
agement specialist, arrived but declined to
remove the backpacks because her expertise is
in chemicals, not explosive devices, she said.
She added that she was concerned because
"anytime you have a detonated device you have
to make sure it did its job."
Officials surrounded the area with yellow bar
rier tape, causing scores of students leaving late

yesterday afternoon. Police say the backpacks, which contained yellow and blue smoke bombs, may
have been planted by Cal pranksters.
