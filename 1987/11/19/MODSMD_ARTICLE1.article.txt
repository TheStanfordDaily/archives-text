# Cal prank smokes campus

### Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
Two homemade smoke bombs in blue back
packs exploded in White Plaza yesterday after
noon in what Stanford officials said was proba
bly a Big Game-related prank.
One bomb spewed yellow while the other dis
charged blue smoke, staining nearby wails sur
rounding the Claw fountain.
Hours after the bombs went off Stanford
safety officials cordoned off the entire area be
tween the Bookstore and Old Union because
they feared the backpacks still contained
"explosive devices."
According to witnesses, the smoke bombs
went off near the Claw at about 1:30 p.m. yester
day. The Palo Alto Fire Department received a
call but decided not to respond when the caller
described the event as "just a smoke bomb,"
firefighter Rich Dean said.
An hour-and-a-half later, Stanford Police were
called to check out a backpack on the ledge of
the fountain that "had a chemical smell and was
corroding." The caller, who refused to give her
name, told The Daily she was concerned be

cause her three children were playing near the
backpack.
When Stanford police officers arrived they
found a second backpack in a garbage can near
the corner of the fountain. Deputy Timothy
Schreiner pulled the backpack out of the garbage
can and set it on top.
Fire officials arrived on the scene shortly
thereafter and called Stanford Health and Safety
officials to remove the backpacks as a precau
tionary measure.
"We know the bombs have expended. We're
not worried about cordoning off the area — it
would only draw attention," said Fire Capt.
Dale Hopkins.
Jennifer Gates, a Health and Safety risk man
agement specialist, arrived but declined to
remove the backpacks because her expertise is
in chemicals, not explosive devices, she said.
She added that she was concerned because
"anytime you have a detonated device you have
to make sure it did its job."
Officials surrounded the area with yellow bar
rier tape, causing scores of students leaving late

scene and dozens to question of

Police then called to the scene
Community Safety Coordinator
Doug Williams, the University's
bomb specialist. But when Wil
liams had not arrived 45 minutes
later, deputies became upset.
"This should have been taken
care of a long time ago," said one
deputy, who blamed the dis
patcher for failing to contact Wil
liams. Once Williams was called,
he arrived in four minutes.
Without touching the back
packs, Williams looked in each
with a flashlight. He then care

fully opened them and inspected
what was left of the bomns. At
4:45 p.m., Gates assisted Wil
liams in putting the backpacks
into fireproof canisters.
Williams described the bombs
as "homemade devices" but
could not confirm statements
made earlier by officers that they
were set off by timers. "1 can't
tell until they're dismantled," he
said.
Williams said that both back-
Eacks were wet, leading him to
elieve that after the smoke
bomb in each went off, someone
threw them into the fountain to
put them out.
Police had no leads on the inci
dent, and one officer said he was
unsure "whether there will be
any follow-up."
