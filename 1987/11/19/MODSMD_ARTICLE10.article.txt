# London subway blaze kills 32
## 
### 
LONDON — At least 32
people died and scores were
injured when a tire broke out last
night at central London's busiest
subway and train station.
A police official on the scene at
King's Cross Station described
the tire as a "major catastrophe"
and said the death toll could rise
significantly. "There are many
people dead," he said.
A number of people were said
to be trapped underground
several hours after the fire,
which began just before 8 p.m. at
the end of evening rush hour, had
been extinguished. Firefighters
were said to be making their way
slowly through the smoke-tilled
underground passageways
looking for other dead and

injured.
Survivors spoke of panic in the
station passageways and of
seeing people with their clothing
and bodies burned.
Paul Medland, who escaped
uninjured, said hundreds of pas
sengers fought their way in a
stampede to escape the smoke.
United Press International re
ported. "It was chaos," Medland
said. "People were panicking
and just running everywhere and
treading on each other. It was
awful."
"We saw a man and a woman
coming up," said an eyewitness.
"The man had all his hair burned
off and his face was black and the
woman was screaming."
The death toll was the worst

for the London subway system
since Feb. 28, 1975, when a train
hit a wall at Moorgate station,
killing 43.
Traffic in much of central Lon
don was brought to a standstill as
police blocked major roads
around the King's Cross-St.
Pancras station complex to allow
firefighters and fleets of am
bulances to reach the scene.
According to Keith Bright,
chairman of London Regional
Transport, the tire began in a ma
chine room under the station's
main escalator.
The fire quickly spread upward
to the ticket office at the station
entrance, while the heavy smoke
poured down into the tunnels.
Bright said that, in addition to

the smoke, the principal cause of
death and injury appeared to
have been the intense heat of the
blaze.
Police would not speculate as
to the cause of the fire, but initial
indications were that it began ac
cidentally in the escalator mecha
nism itself.
Hundreds, and possibly thou
sands, of commuters were in the
massive underground labyrinth
of the station when the fire broke
out. King's Cross is a junction
for five subway lines, and the
main London rail station for
travel to the northeastern part of
the country. Hundreds were
taken to hospitals.
