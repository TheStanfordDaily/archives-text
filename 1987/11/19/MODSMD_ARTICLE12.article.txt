# Kennedy holds conference with MEChA
## Short meeting disappoints Chicanos 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy met with members of the campus
Chicano community last night to dis
cuss a range of issues, including the
recent grape boycott effort, Chicano
faculty representation and admissions
recruitment policies.
Many students expressed disap
pointment after the meeting, charging
that the hour-long meeting did not al
low enough time to discuss issues
thoroughly.
Junior Miguel Marquez said the
meeting was "kind of disappointing."
"There was so much more to say.
We didn't get to a lot of important is
sues, like the University's ties to the
Bohemian Club,"he said.
According to students present, the
meeting last night was the first between
Kennedy and the Chicano community
in two years.
Kennedy defended the University's
decision not to require Food Service to
stop serving grapes, which have been
the target of a boycott organized by the
United Farm Workers union. He said
that the decision whether or not to join
in the boycott should be up to individ
ual students, not the institution. Ken

nedy added that a University move to
ban grapes would prevent students
from exercising their freedom.
Kennedy advised students to pursue
an active residence information cam
paign to encourage other students to
join the boycott, which has been spon
sored on campus by MEChA, the
Chicano-Latino student organization.
Kennedy said a boycott imple
mented by students would have a
greater political effect on grape
growers than one imposed by Stanford
and said the "serving of grapes is not a
values statement."
Members of the Chicano community
present at the meeting voiced concern
that University officials are ignoring
the health of farm workers.
"It's a battle of wealthy grape
growers and poor farm workers," said
senior Julie Martinez. "Who's the Uni
versity going to listen to?"
Kennedy encouraged students to es
tablish a boycott on their own initative
"without all students, but with enough
to let Food Service see that (grape) use
is lower."
In discussing the difficulty of finding
ethnic minority faculty members, Ken
nedy affirmed the importance of active
ethnic minority faculty recruitment. He
said there is no "shortage of commit

ment" on his part or on the part of
Provost James Rosse for greater repre
sentation of minorities on the faculty.
Kennedy also said there has been a
"modest increase" in the number of
Chicano faculty.
According to History Prof. Al
Camarillo, however, that number has
not changed "in a decade." Stanford
has hired two Chicano professors in the
last two years, he said, but two other
Chicano professors vacated their posi
tions, leaving the number unchanged.
According to Kennedy, the small
percentage of ethnic minorities cur
rently enrolled in graduate school pro
grams partially explains the Univer
sity's difficulty in finding and hiring
qualified minority faculty members.
Many students criticized a recent
trip to Europe by Dean of Undergradu
ate Admissions Jean Fetter to recruit
European students and argued that
recruitment of inner-city high school
students warranted the same attention.
"She can fly to Europe, but she
won't go to East L.A.," said junior
Jerilvn Lopez-Mendoza.
Confirming he would "try to carry
that message to the right place," Ken
nedy said he "would like to hear
more" about inner-city recruiting by
students.
