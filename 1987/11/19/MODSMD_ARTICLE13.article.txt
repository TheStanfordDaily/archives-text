## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Expand 'Course Guide' 
### 
One of Stanford's great strengths is the variety
of classes it offers. To an undergraduate un
familiar with the Stanford system, however, this
wide selection of offerings can be a paralyzing
trap.
Students, especially during their first few
years here, need a resource to help them choose
intelligently from among the myriad of possible
courses. "Courses and Degrees" is a helpful
outline, but its institutional descriptions are dry
and tend to miss the peculiar character of many
classes.
In the (now distant) past, Stanford students
had a resource to help them choose classes intel
ligently â€” the "Course Guide." The guide pro
vided the Stanford community with student
evaluations of classes and professors, which
helped students avoid the blind experimentation
with classes that too often characterizes the first
few weeks of a quarter.
The "Course Guide" also reminded the fac
ulty that students evaluate faculty performance
critically. Grading is a good thing; it makes stu
dents work harder. By the same token, student
evaluations of faculty performance can act as a
"grading" system that work as an incentive for
quality teaching.
For these reasons the guide's evaluation of
classes was an essential and direct service to the
entire student population. The ASSU should
never have allowed it to disappear. Fortunately
the ASSU has recently decided to revive the
"Course Guide." We hope the ASSU
recognizes the importance of this undertaking
and invests the project with the energy it
deserves.
The ASSU should remember that the students

need a quality guide and that such a resourse will
demand long-term effort. This effort should
focus on three areas.
First, get the guide published. The current
ASSU plan calls for the guide to be on-line in
stead of printed. For the short term, this ar
rangement is fine. However, a guide that can be
accessed only by computer will be inconvenient
for a great majority of students. The ASSU
should develop a long-range plan for printing the
guide.
Second, make the guide comprehensive. If it
is to be a valuable resource, the guide can't just
cover the big lecture classes. Word-of-mouth
alone can take care of Economics I, Political
Science 35 and the Human Biology core. Stu
dents need special assistence not in these giant
classes, but rather in the smaller ones.
Third, develop a new rating system. The old
guide provided no information other than quotes
from students and an account of the number of
students who rated the course "good," "fair,"
etc. These numerically based student ratings are
uninformative. As an example of an alternative
evaluation system, the ASSU should look at
Harvard's informative and witty (and profitable)
"Confidential Guide." Stanford's new guide
should aim for such meaningful and interesting
assessments.
These expansions of the proposed guide
would be costly. They would demand a large
staff and a multi-year plan. But the money and
effort would be well spent. The ASSU should
make the initial investment in the guide, but then
it should set it up as a publishing enterprise in its
own right. To defray costs, the guide could be
sold instead of distributed free. Few students
would mind paying for a quality guide.
