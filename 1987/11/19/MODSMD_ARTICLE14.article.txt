Food Service will
feast on Fast Day
I am a Sterling Quad resident,
and I partake in the glorified
fjgint system (a.k.a. Stanford
Starvation Diet). By this point in
the year 1 suppose most residents
have come to terms with this sys
tem. However, something ridic
ulous is going to happen on Fast
Day, Nov. 19, which should be
mentioned.
On this day we will be able
donate up to 1000 points, and the
Stanford International Develop
ment Organization (SIDO) will
receive I cent per point. Students
pay 3 cents per point on their
meal plans, which means the real
winner on Fast Day is Food Ser
vice!
Put another way, at least two
thirds of the money we donate to
this charity will never see a
hungry person.
This is surely a travesty.
Maybe SIDO does not even ex
ist, because to the impartial ob
server this all looks like a clever
scheme to enrich Food Service
coffers. However, I have dis
counted this possibility because
the people who manage the most
inefficient enterprise in the his
tory of Stanford could not be so
clever.
Perhaps as a compromise to

the inequity in the proceeds
problem we could hold a fast day
for Food Service where it gets
one-third and SI DC) gets two
thirds.

ASSU bumbling
What sort of farce is the ASSU
trying to pass off as an election?
The switch to the new voting
machines has resulted in one of
the biggest displays of incom
petence I have ever seen associ
ated with such a thing.
As a graduate student, I was
not particularly interested in
voting for senators (seeing "vote
for no more than seven" over a
list of four names is a hint my
vote might not matter much
anyway), but I did feel like
having a say in the constitutional
amendments. Imagine my
amusement when I saw that in
stead of being given a chance to
vote for or against the amend
ments I thought were under con
sideration, the ballot was set up
so that I could voice my opinion
about the (mythical) "item No.
1" through "item No. 10."
A request for help directed to
the person manning the booth at
first elicited a blank incompre

hension, but after assuring him
self that the official ballot did
indeed offer nothing with which
to tell which of the mythical
items might correspond to some
thing in the real world, he offered
me a copy of Monday's Daily
opened to the ASSU page; he
assured me that the amendment
whose text started in the lower
left of the page corresponded to
"item No. I," and the ammend
ment whose text started in the
lower right corresponded to
"item No. 2."
Well, 1 voted accordingly, but
there was no indication in The
Daily, or in any other written ma
terial 1 saw, as to whether or not
this was the case. It would not
suprise me at all to find out that 1
should have voted for items No.
9 and 10 instead, or that my vote
for item No. 2 should have been
for item No. 1 and vice versa.
It is gratifying to have one's
opinion as to the general com
petence of the student govern
ment so amply confirmed.
