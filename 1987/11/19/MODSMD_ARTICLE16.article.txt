# World culture is now reality
## 
### 
Anyone who has bothered to look has probably
noticed it is all the rage to be "ethnic" these days.
High fashion designers are featuring models who
aren't of European descent, and internationalism
prevails in advertising from the United Colors of
Benetton to Coca-Cola drinkers from the far
reaches of the globe. Whether it's "La Bamba" or
"The Cosby Show," America has finally discov
ered the human diversity of the world and of its
own melting pot.

Unfortunately, all of this cross-cultural trendi
ness hasn't been translated into the language of
progressive social change. The whites of Pretoria
tune into the family exploits of the Huxtables while
demanding that South Africa's black families carry
passes to leave their shanties.
Americans celebrate international good will
vicariously via their small screens — while their
president drops bombs on children in North Africa
and supports terror in Central America.
But the marketing trends do reflect the new
realities of the modern world. Madison Avenue is
quick to absorb demographic change. But what of
the institutions that, one hopes, are more responsi
ble for shaping our culture and collective con
sciousness?
Are the halls of academia as willing and as able to
respond to change? Is the learning process at the
undergraduate university keeping pace with a
changing world and a changing student body? Are
America's universities, and Stanford in particular,
producing graduates who are prepared and inclined
to address the issues of ethnicity and inter
nationalism that have so captivated Hollywood and
Madison Avenue and to address them in a manner
that amounts to more than token gestures or mass
marketing?
Stanford's attempt to promote the common un
derstanding and values of a liberal education has
been, first and foremost, its Western Culture re
quirement. If in any way Stanford is preparing an
increasingly careerist student body to become re
sponsible members of society at large, it is through
the Area One effort. Thus we delve into the cur
rently hot issue of the merits and faults of Western
Culture.
What is "Western culture?" If we work back
ward from the curricula of Stanford's Western Cul
ture courses, perhaps we can gain an insight into at
least the Area One faculty's conception of Western
culture. The consensus, it seems, is that Western
culture began with the ancient Greeks and ended
roughly in the early 2()th century. In order to gain

intellectual focus we restrict the definition of
"Western" to European and early American
societies and study this Western culture in a
vacuum, as if it were not influenced at all by intel
lectual currents outside the West.
Are we prepared to accept this definition of
Western culture? 1 would suggest that for the
reasons given above and by the Area One faculty
we should be. Are we prepared to devote 15 quar
ter units to the study of this Western Culture?
Many Stanford students are not white males, but
rather women and students of all races interested in
and enriched by the current Area One course offer
ings. Should all Stanford students be required, on
this basis, to spend three quarters studying West
ern culture?
There is no doubt that the works and currents of
thought presented in the Western Culture tracks
had a profound influence on American society.
There is no question as to the value of their study.
But the Western Culture requirement supposes that
these are the only, or at least the most important,
historical and intellectual influences on our society
today. Given the modern conditions of American
life, both inside and outside the ivory tower of
academia, this assumption is patently false.
The writings of John Locke could not begin to
take on meaning for blacks and Native Americans
in the early days of America, when an entirely dif
ferent kind of "social contract" was imposed, not
agreed upon. And while many of their decendants
may know the consequences of the modern day
mutations of Darwin's writings, how much more do
they understand the thoughts of King, Mahatma
Ghandi or perhaps of Malcolm X? These men and
many others conspicuously absent from Area One
reading lists have profoundly affected the concep
tions and realities of the Western culture in which
we live today and of the world culture of which it is
a part.
For we really live today in a world society; dis
tinctions such as East and West are rapidly becom
ing obsolete. With the advance of modern commu
nications, production and warfare, ignorance of the
world at large may soon quite literally become the
eighth deadly sin.
This is not to suggest that a revised Area One
should attempt to provide a comprehensive educa
tion in world culture (just as the current Area One
fails to do so with respect to Western culture). It is
to suggest that changing times demand a changing
standard of a liberal education.
I will forgo the usual sentiments regarding Stan
ford students' potential as world leaders and simply
propose that as educated citizens in the world's
largest democracy, Stanford students have a
unique opportunity and responsibility to them
selves, to American society and to the world at
large. The present Area One requirement, held in
this light, becomes increasingly inadequate and of
ten irrelevant to the concerns of a dynamic student
body and to the realities of a dynamic world.

rently hot issue of the merits and faults of Western
Culture.
What is "Western culture?" If we work back
ward from the curricula of Stanford's Western Cul
ture courses, perhaps we can gain an insight into at
least the Area One faculty's conception of Western
culture. The consensus, it seems, is that Western
culture began with the ancient Greeks and ended
roughly in the early 2()th century. In order to gain

intellectual focus we restrict the definition of
"Western" to European and early American
societies and study this Western culture in a
vacuum, as if it were not influenced at all by intel
lectual currents outside the West.
Are we prepared to accept this definition of
Western culture? 1 would suggest that for the
reasons given above and by the Area One faculty
we should be. Are we prepared to devote 15 quar
ter units to the study of this Western Culture?
Many Stanford students are not white males, but
rather women and students of all races interested in
and enriched by the current Area One course offer
ings. Should all Stanford students be required, on
this basis, to spend three quarters studying West
ern culture?
There is no doubt that the works and currents of
thought presented in the Western Culture tracks
had a profound influence on American society.
There is no question as to the value of their study.
But the Western Culture requirement supposes that
these are the only, or at least the most important,
historical and intellectual influences on our society
today. Given the modern conditions of American
life, both inside and outside the ivory tower of
academia, this assumption is patently false.
The writings of John Locke could not begin to
take on meaning for blacks and Native Americans
in the early days of America, when an entirely dif
ferent kind of "social contract" was imposed, not
agreed upon. And while many of their decendants
may know the consequences of the modern day
mutations of Darwin's writings, how much more do
they understand the thoughts of King, Mahatma
Ghandi or perhaps of Malcolm X? These men and
many others conspicuously absent from Area One
reading lists have profoundly affected the concep
tions and realities of the Western culture in which
we live today and of the world culture of which it is
a part.
For we really live today in a world society; dis
tinctions such as East and West are rapidly becom
ing obsolete. With the advance of modern commu
nications, production and warfare, ignorance of the
world at large may soon quite literally become the
eighth deadly sin.
This is not to suggest that a revised Area One
should attempt to provide a comprehensive educa
tion in world culture (just as the current Area One
fails to do so with respect to Western culture). It is
to suggest that changing times demand a changing
standard of a liberal education.
I will forgo the usual sentiments regarding Stan
ford students' potential as world leaders and simply
propose that as educated citizens in the world's
largest democracy, Stanford students have a
unique opportunity and responsibility to them
selves, to American society and to the world at
large. The present Area One requirement, held in
this light, becomes increasingly inadequate and of
ten irrelevant to the concerns of a dynamic student
body and to the realities of a dynamic world.

Anyone who has bothered to look has probably
noticed it is all the rage to be "ethnic" these days.
High fashion designers are featuring models who
aren't of European descent, and internationalism
prevails in advertising from the United Colors of
Benetton to Coca-Cola drinkers from the far
reaches of the globe. Whether it's "La Bamba" or
"The Cosby Show," America has finally discov
ered the human diversity of the world and of its
own melting pot.

Unfortunately, all of this cross-cultural trendi
ness hasn't been translated into the language of
progressive social change. The whites of Pretoria
tune into the family exploits of the Huxtables while
demanding that South Africa's black families carry
passes to leave their shanties.
Americans celebrate international good will
vicariously via their small screens — while their
president drops bombs on children in North Africa
and supports terror in Central America.
But the marketing trends do reflect the new
realities of the modern world. Madison Avenue is
quick to absorb demographic change. But what of
the institutions that, one hopes, are more responsi
ble for shaping our culture and collective con
sciousness?
Are the halls of academia as willing and as able to
respond to change? Is the learning process at the
undergraduate university keeping pace with a
changing world and a changing student body? Are
America's universities, and Stanford in particular,
producing graduates who are prepared and inclined
to address the issues of ethnicity and inter
nationalism that have so captivated Hollywood and
Madison Avenue and to address them in a manner
that amounts to more than token gestures or mass
marketing?
Stanford's attempt to promote the common un
derstanding and values of a liberal education has
been, first and foremost, its Western Culture re
quirement. If in any way Stanford is preparing an
increasingly careerist student body to become re
sponsible members of society at large, it is through
the Area One effort. Thus we delve into the cur
rently hot issue of the merits and faults of Western
