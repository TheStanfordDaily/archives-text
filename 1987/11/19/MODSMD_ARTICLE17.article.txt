## BSU asks only for commitment

I would like to respond to the "Bug Me"
column (Daily, Nov. 17) and the criteria for
entering the Black Student Union. Your arti

nifty piece of investigative journalism, hut I
want to complete the picture for prospective
members. The first criterion for membership
is to be chill (translated "cool"), and I don't
think your presentation of our policy was
very calm: it bordered on being defensive and
heavv-handed, anil it might discourage inter

the uplift of black and African people.

The Black Student Union (BSU) has a
unique role on Stanford's campus because it
has been recognized as the representative of
black student interests at Stanford. The pri
mary role of the BSU, as defined in our con
stitution, is to advance the liberation of
African people. Our basic job is to address
the institutional or overt racism that affects
black students and to interact with the black
and mainstream Stanford community in
maintaining black identity and cultural heri
tage.
The distinction that is important to the
BSU is not race, but whether or not members

have an expressed commitment to the uplift
and liberation of black and African peoples.
Most advocacy groups have similar ideals.
The Black Student Union, however, func
tions under the assumption that those people
who identify themselves as black or African
American are in favor of their own and their
community's advancement.
The Black Student Union believes we have
the right to maintain our sense of identity and
cultural heritage; therefore, we make an ef
fort to ensure no black community members
are excluded. But we, like all Stanford organ
izations, allow any student who believes in
the ideals of the organization to join.
The Black Student Union has no official
membership roster, and no one is excluded
from participating in BSU committees, activi
ties or general meetings. There is also no offi
cial membership process, all students who
would like to actively participate in the or
ganization must come to the BSU officers
and discuss their level of commitment.
Black students do not enjoy any privileges
by being members and must come to the BSU
officers to enjoy the drudgery and hard work
of being an active member. Any black stu
dent who asks to be disconnected from the
BSU will be removed from the mailing roster
at their request, and any black student who is
actively antagonistic to the black community
might be asked to resign from the BSU mem
bership. The BSU will continue to work for
the uplift of all black people regardless of
their involvement, but we give them the op

tion to decline our support.
There are white students who are actively
involved in the programs and actions of the
BSU, yet no non-black student has actually
pursued membership in the BSU since 1 have
been at Stanford. It a white student asked to
join the BSU, there would not be a vote of the
membership; I would want to sit the inter
ested student down and explain the workings
and ideals of the BSU. The Stanford black
community is a rather close-knit group, and
students who have not been actively involved
but would like to have a more active role
would be involved in a dialogue regardless of
their race.
However, I would make a special effort to
talk to white students who asked to join be
cause it would be important for them to un
derstand and be comfortable with an organi
zation that is strongly committed to our
ideals, and for them to understand the desire
of the black community to maintain its
autonomy and control over its own destiny.
They would have to understand that by
joining the BSU they would be subject to re
actions of fear, paranoia and misunderstand
ing from the general Stanford community and
would be fighting an uphill battle for the
legitimacy of black institutions, culture and
identity. I hope any students who have a
genuine commitment to the advancement of
black people come to meet with the BSU offi
cers and become involved in our organiza
tion; we need all the help we can get.

I would like to respond to the "Bug Me"
column (Daily, Nov. 17) and the criteria for
entering the Black Student Union. Your arti
cle had some of the facts correct and was a
nifty piece of investigative journalism, hut I
want to complete the picture for prospective
members. The first criterion for membership
is to be chill (translated "cool"), and I don't
think your presentation of our policy was
very calm: it bordered on being defensive and
heavv-handed, anil it might discourage inter
ested folks from joining or being active mem
bers. I he Black Student Union is not an or
ganization that excludes anyone who is for
the uplift of black and African people.

The Black Student Union (BSU) has a
unique role on Stanford's campus because it
has been recognized as the representative of
black student interests at Stanford. The pri
mary role of the BSU, as defined in our con
stitution, is to advance the liberation of
African people. Our basic job is to address
the institutional or overt racism that affects
black students and to interact with the black
and mainstream Stanford community in
maintaining black identity and cultural heri
tage.
The distinction that is important to the
BSU is not race, but whether or not members

have an expressed commitment to the uplift
and liberation of black and African peoples.
Most advocacy groups have similar ideals.
The Black Student Union, however, func
tions under the assumption that those people
who identify themselves as black or African
American are in favor of their own and their
community's advancement.
The Black Student Union believes we have
the right to maintain our sense of identity and
cultural heritage; therefore, we make an ef
fort to ensure no black community members
are excluded. But we, like all Stanford organ
izations, allow any student who believes in
the ideals of the organization to join.
The Black Student Union has no official
membership roster, and no one is excluded
from participating in BSU committees, activi
ties or general meetings. There is also no offi
cial membership process, all students who
would like to actively participate in the or
ganization must come to the BSU officers
and discuss their level of commitment.
Black students do not enjoy any privileges
by being members and must come to the BSU
officers to enjoy the drudgery and hard work
of being an active member. Any black stu
dent who asks to be disconnected from the
BSU will be removed from the mailing roster
at their request, and any black student who is
actively antagonistic to the black community
might be asked to resign from the BSU mem
bership. The BSU will continue to work for
the uplift of all black people regardless of
their involvement, but we give them the op

tion to decline our support.
There are white students who are actively
involved in the programs and actions of the
BSU, yet no non-black student has actually
pursued membership in the BSU since 1 have
been at Stanford. It a white student asked to
join the BSU, there would not be a vote of the
membership; I would want to sit the inter
ested student down and explain the workings
and ideals of the BSU. The Stanford black
community is a rather close-knit group, and
students who have not been actively involved
but would like to have a more active role
would be involved in a dialogue regardless of
their race.
However, I would make a special effort to
talk to white students who asked to join be
cause it would be important for them to un
derstand and be comfortable with an organi
zation that is strongly committed to our
ideals, and for them to understand the desire
of the black community to maintain its
autonomy and control over its own destiny.
They would have to understand that by
joining the BSU they would be subject to re
actions of fear, paranoia and misunderstand
ing from the general Stanford community and
would be fighting an uphill battle for the
legitimacy of black institutions, culture and
identity. I hope any students who have a
genuine commitment to the advancement of
black people come to meet with the BSU offi
cers and become involved in our organiza
tion; we need all the help we can get.
