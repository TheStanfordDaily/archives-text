# Symposium draws Soviet
## Scientist to visit arms meeting; no word on Sakharov 
### Bobby Schrader Staff writer 
A noted Soviet physicist will travel here next
month to participate in a conference on interna
tional security and arms control, according to con
ference organizers.
Sergei Kapitza, a member of the Soviet Acad
emy of Sciences, is expected to arrive here shortly
before the conference, scheduled for the weekend
of Dec. 4. A professor at the Institute of Physical
Problems in Moscow, Kapitza is a respected figure
in scientific circles in the United States and the So
viet Union, according to Sidney Drell, chief organ
izer of the conference and co-director of the Uni
versity's Center for International Security and
Arms Control.
Drell said he didn't think Kapitza's visit would
hurt the chances that Soviet officials would allow a
visit by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Andrei Sak
harov to participate in the conference. According
to Drell, Sakharov expressed a keen interest in
coming to the United States and participating in the

conference during a June conversation with Drell in
Moscow.
Calling Kapitza "an excellent representative,"
Drell said he didn't "read any special significance
into his coming" and declined to speculate whether
Soviet officials would allow Sakharov, a primary
player in the development of the Soviet hydrogen
nomb and later winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, to
attend.
"While I'd like to be optimistic about Sakharov's
chances of coming (to the conference), we have
had no indication either way," said Drell, who is
also deputy director of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center.
David Bernstein, a research fellow at the Arms
Control Center and the assistant coordinator of the
conference, agreed. "[The Soviets'] sending
Kapitza does not really say anything about Sak
harov's status," he saia.
Bernstein said he didn't view the selection of
Kapitza as a Soviet effort to appease the Western
scientific community by sending
an equally respected academic
with a less controversial political
record.
Kapitza's participation in the
conference will "give us a view
of what the scientists connected
with the establishment in the So
viet Union think of the (Reagan-
Gorbachev) summit," Bernstein
said.
According to Drell, the two
other invited Soviets, former
Ambassador to the United States
Anatoli Dobrynin and Academy
of Sciences Vice President Yev
genii Velikov, are not expected to
attend the conference because
they "will be subsumed into the
summit process."

Noting that Kapitza represents
a more moderate political branch
of the Soviet academic commu
nity, Bernstein emphasized the
critical advisory role academics
can play in government.
"While the people at the con
ference are connected with gov
ernment, they represent a broad
spectrum of academic positions,
and through their perspectives
they can better reflect on what is
going on now in international
arms control."
Bernstein stressed the impor
tance of academic conferences
because they provide a less in
hibited environment than sum
mits or formal negotiations.
' The academic setting is more
conducive to an unfettered ex
change of ideas," he said. "In
diplomatic meetings and summits
people are more cautious about
their proposals/ Bernstein said.
