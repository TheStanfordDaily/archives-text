## Despite risks, women are smoking more today 
### Lydia Selling Staff writer 
A comedian at a San Francisco
nightclub recently spoofed the
dangers of smoking: "Sure
cigarettes have less tar, but less
tar than what?" he asked. "They
don't tell you it's less tar than a
freeway offramp."

Even as the audience laughed
hilariously, many women
casually tapped the ashes off
their cigarettes.
Despite common knowledge
about the health threats of
smoking, the rate of smoking
continues to rise among young
women, even though it has
dropped among the population at
large.
This week is the American
Cancer Society's 11th annual
Great American Smoke-Out
Week, and today is the day the
society has targeted to convince
smokers to finally quit.

"The more women climb the
executive ladder, the more they
resort to smoking to handle
stress," said Florence Strom
berg, program associate for the
American Lung Association of
Santa Clara County. "Tobacco
companies have brainwashed the
American public into thinking
that having a cigarette will relax
you. It's sad because there's no
truth to it. You don't relax with a
stimulant."
An estimated 44,000 women
died from lung cancer at
tributable to smoking in 1986, ac
cording to American Cancer So
ciety statistics. Lung cancer has
surpassed breast cancer as the
leading killer of women and is on
the rise among American
women.
Large numbers of women
started smoking after World War
11, and the rates of lung cancer
have risen steadily over the last
40 years. The total percentage of
Americans who smoke,
however, has declined to its cur
rent rate of 26.5 percent. Yet
today, young women are
smoking more than ever.
"The cigarette manufacturers
have gotten very clever with
marketing techniques like Vir
ginia Slims ads,"' said Jane
Haley, director of Public Educa

tion for the American Cancer So
ciety of San Mateo County .
"We're fighting smoking by
not making it a glamorous thing
to do. It damages your circula
tion and wrinkles your skin,
(giving it a) grey pallor — not to
mention the risk factors of heart
disease," she said.
"The main reason (for the rise
in women smokers) is a lot of
marketing by Philip Morris (a
tobacco company) trying to get
smoking identified with high
fashion. Women are getting
caught up in marketing. They're
taking advantage of the high
fashion-smoking mode," said
Alfredo Benavides, health educa
tor with the American Cancer
Society of Santa Clara County.
Smoking can be particularity
damaging to a woman's ability to
bear healthy children. A preg
nant woman who smokes 15 to 20
cigarettes per day is more likely
to miscarry and two to three
times more likely to have a stil
lborn child.
Babies born to women who
smoke are often about one-half
pound lighter than babies born to
mothers who don't smoke. In ad
dition, these undersized babies
are more prone to develop respi
ratory problems than their
healthier counterparts.

In addition to threatening the
lives' of their children, people
who smoke — fathers as well as
mothers — severely endanger
their own health.
For example, smokers are
twice as likely to die from car
diovascular heart disease than
are non-smokers. In cardiac care
units, 70 percent of the patients
under 65 admitted for heart at
tacks are smokers.
Studies have shown that even
taking precautions such as
switching to a milder cigarette is
of little help because smokers of
ten unconsciously smoke a
greater number of cigarettes and
inhale more deeply to compen
sate for the change.
The Stanford Center for Re
search in Disease Prevention is
following 1226 participants in a
random study to examine the ef
fectiveness of psychological and
pharmacological self-help meth
ods designed to prevent relapses
among people who have kicked
the habit.
According to Project Director
Barbara Newman, final results
will not be available until the
summer of 1989, although prelim
inary results are expected much
sooner.
Sandy Kee, director of Nur
sing at Cowell Student Health

Center, counsels students who
want to stop smoking. "I am an
ex-smoker," she said.
"Sometimes it takes an ex
smoker to help another one stop.
Their sense of denial is so great
(and the feeling that) it's not

going to harm [them]. There's a
whole excuse system" that stu
dents set up. A smoker often
gives himself/herself excuses
such as, "I've got midterms com
ing up, and another [cigarette!
won't hurt," she explained.

units, 70 percent of the patients
under 65 admitted for heart at

Studies have shown that even
taking precautions such as
switching to a milder cigarette is

The Stanford Center for Re

following 1226 participants in a

According to Project Director
Barbara Newman, final results
will not be available until the
summer of 1989, although prelim

sooner.
Sandy Kee, director of Nur

"Sometimes it takes an ex
smoker to help another one stop.
Their sense of denial is so great
(and the feeling that) it's not

going to harm [them]. There's a

such as, "I've got midterms com

won't hurt," she explained.


A comedian at a San Francisco
nightclub recently spoofed the
dangers of smoking: "Sure
cigarettes have less tar, but less
tar than what?" he asked. "They
don't tell you it's less tar than a

Even as the audience laughed
hilariously, many women
casually tapped the ashes off
their cigarettes.
Despite common knowledge
about the health threats of
smoking, the rate of smoking
continues to rise among young
women, even though it has
dropped among the population at
large.
This week is the American
Cancer Society's 11th annual
Great American Smoke-Out
Week, and today is the day the
society has targeted to convince
smokers to finally quit.

"The more women climb the
executive ladder, the more they
resort to smoking to handle
stress," said Florence Strom
berg, program associate for the
American Lung Association of
Santa Clara County. "Tobacco
companies have brainwashed the
American public into thinking
that having a cigarette will relax
you. It's sad because there's no
truth to it. You don't relax with a
stimulant."
An estimated 44,000 women
died from lung cancer at
tributable to smoking in 1986, ac
cording to American Cancer So
ciety statistics. Lung cancer has
surpassed breast cancer as the
leading killer of women and is on
the rise among American
women.
Large numbers of women
started smoking after World War
11, and the rates of lung cancer
have risen steadily over the last
40 years. The total percentage of
Americans who smoke,
however, has declined to its cur
rent rate of 26.5 percent. Yet
today, young women are
smoking more than ever.
"The cigarette manufacturers
have gotten very clever with
marketing techniques like Vir
ginia Slims ads,"' said Jane
Haley, director of Public Educa

tion for the American Cancer So
ciety of San Mateo County .
"We're fighting smoking by
not making it a glamorous thing
to do. It damages your circula
tion and wrinkles your skin,
(giving it a) grey pallor — not to
mention the risk factors of heart
disease," she said.
"The main reason (for the rise
in women smokers) is a lot of
marketing by Philip Morris (a
tobacco company) trying to get
smoking identified with high
fashion. Women are getting
caught up in marketing. They're
taking advantage of the high
fashion-smoking mode," said
Alfredo Benavides, health educa
tor with the American Cancer
Society of Santa Clara County.
Smoking can be particularity
damaging to a woman's ability to
bear healthy children. A preg
nant woman who smokes 15 to 20
cigarettes per day is more likely
to miscarry and two to three
times more likely to have a stil
lborn child.
Babies born to women who
smoke are often about one-half
pound lighter than babies born to
mothers who don't smoke. In ad
dition, these undersized babies
are more prone to develop respi
ratory problems than their
healthier counterparts.

In addition to threatening the
lives' of their children, people
who smoke — fathers as well as
mothers — severely endanger
their own health.

twice as likely to die from car
