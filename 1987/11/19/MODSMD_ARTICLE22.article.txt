# Big Game II: Cardinal chess beats Berkeley
## 
### Gaby Banks 
I he fans are restless in anticipation. Will the
Cardinal pull through in the clutch?
Glancing circumspectly to his left and his right,
the Stanford competitor lifts his hand, and after a
long pause, lets it fall down to his side. Again, he
knits his brow, rethinking the move.
Loud, ryhthmic chanting begins in the bleachers.
Minutes pass. Again the hand goes up.
The crowds are on their feet. Fingertips grab a
pawn and move it from E5 to E6. Over the din a
deep voice bellows, "Check mate!"
Clearly, this scenario strains the confines of
reality. Unlike football, chess has never been
known as a major spectator sport.
Although chess tournaments can't usually match
the visual excitement of football, the Stanford
chess team quietly succeeded recently in making a
name for itself, and for Stanford, by defeating Cali
fornia.
Since its creation last year Stanford's chess team
has twice pulled the board out from under Cal. Up
until Stanford's appearance on the scene, Cal had
enjoyed a six-year reign as the dominant West
coast chess team.
Conquering the Bears last year in the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Championships, Stanford
finished the tournament with a 15-1 record. Phis
year, despite discouraging ratings, the team again
emerged victorious against its cross-Bay rival.
Stanford's "rivalry against Cal extends to all
competitive events including chess," said sopho
more team member Barney Pell.
Team members (in order of their U.S. Chess
Federation titles) include: sophomore Adam Lief,
national master; junior Peter Thiel, national
master; graduate student Paul Rejto, expert; and
Pell, who is also an expert.
Lief, Thiel and Pell founded the Stanford Chess
Team last year.
On Nov. 7, the Stanford team traveled to the

U.S. Army Defense Language Institute in Mon
terey to defend its Pacific Coast title.
Eight teams, from Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo,
Occidental College, the Defense Language Insti
tute. Cal and Stanford battled for the coveted title.
"Our whole team felt very excited. Thiel said.
"We knew it was going to be tough, even though
we were the defending champions."

Players attributed the small number of tourna
ment spectators to the fact that the average time
span for one chess game is four hours.
Highlights of the first two rounds included two 4-
0 triumphs: over Cal's No. 2 team and over the
Defense Language Institute's No. I team.
The clincher, however, came during the pivotal
third round against Cal's top-ranked team when
Adam Lief, Stanford's top player, pulled off the
critical win.
To the astonishment of onlookers, Lief, a na
tional master, defeated Berkeley's highly-touted
senior master and boosted the round score to two
-and-a-half to one-and-a-half.
"Rivalry is generally a good thing," Thiel said,
"as long as it doesn't get out of hand."
After downing arch-rival Cal, Stanford polished
off the streak with an easy 4-0 win over Cal Poly's
No. I.
During the victory celebration that followed.
Cardinal spirits were noticeably roused. "Chess
tournaments are pretty quiet places," I.ief said.

At the end of the tournament Stanford took home
the Top College prize. In addition, each player
from the uncoached Stanford team garnered a Best
Individual Player award, leaving none to their com
petitors.
Team players said they sometimes use psycho
logical tactics to outwit their opponents.
"Sometimes we wear our Stanford sweatshirts to
intimidate them," Pell said.

Upcoming battles the chess team faces include
the U.S. Amateur Team West Championships and
possibly the Pan American Games, held over win
ter break. Whether or not the players can attend
will depend on the team's financial condition.
But for the moment Stanford chess team mem
bers said they feel they have done their share in the
rivalry between the Bear and the Card.
"Now it's up to the football team," Thiel said.
