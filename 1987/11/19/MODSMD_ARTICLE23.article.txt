The Hoover Institution
recently acquired a major collec
tion of aocuments on the
Mexican Communist Party as
sembled by longtime party mem
ber Rodolflo Encheverria-
Martinez, according to a Hoover
archivist.
George Esenwein, library spe
cialist for the Latin American
collection at Hoover, declined to
quote the exact purchase price,
but said the collection was
valued in the tens of thousands of
dollars.
Combined with Stanford's cur
rent Mexican history collection,
the newly acquired documents
make Stanford "the best source
for information on Mexican com

munism in the United States,"
Esenwein said.
The collection is not an official
archive of the Partido Comunista
de Mexico, Esenwein said, but
rather consists of the personal
collections of Encheverria-
Martinez and a second party
member, Gabino Alcaraz.
The collection, which contains
books, pamphlets, newspapers,
journals, party memoranda and
political posters, documents the
history of the Mexican Commu
nist Party from its founding in
1919 until it merged with other
leftist groups in 1981.
"Certainly for people studying
electoral politics it is interesting,
especially since Mexico's was
the first Communist Party in
Latin America," Esenwein said.
