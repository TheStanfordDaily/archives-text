## Behind enemy lines: going undercover in Berkeley 
### Kathy Lachenauer Lori Silver Senior staff writers 
For one day, we undertook a
dangerous mission. We crossed
enemy lines, ventured into un
charted territory. For one day,
we became Weenies.
Because Big Game is at home
this year, and Stanford students
don't have to leave plush Palo
Alto, we traveled incognito to
discover the real UC-Berkeley.
Driving up Telegraph Avenue,
Cal's equivalent of Palm Drive,
we immediately saw a striking
difference between the two
campuses.
We thought we had entered the
Twilight Zone. The spirit of the
1960s is very much alive and well
at Cal. In contrast to scenic Palm
Drive with its gorgeous view of
Mem Chu, Telegraph is lined
with hippies selling tie-dyed T
shirts and with students hurrying
to their classes.
Perched at the top of
Telegraph is Sather Gate, a large
copper arch marking the official
entrance to Weenieland. Sather
Gate is the famous sight of most
of the major Cal riots in the '60s.
Silly us; we thought the '60s
were over. Unfortunately no one
has told this to Cal students —
obviously a serious deficiency in
their education.
As we innocently walked
through Sather Gate we got
swept up in a silent protest

march. By Stanford standards
this march was huge. About 500
students marched through the
campus with clenched fists up
held.
According to Krishna Henry, a
sophomore, Cal's ethnic minor
ity groups were protesting the in
adequate office space provided
for student services. Their
offices are housed in 40-year-old
"temporary" shacks that re
minded us of Manzanita Park —
except that the shacks were
wooden and puce-colored.
"Cal's administration is just as
conservative as Stanford's,"
Henry said, noting that the Cal
administration had yet to ac
knowledge the protesters'
demands.
As we talked to with Henry his
common misconceptions about
Stanford became apparent. What
do Cal students really think
about Stanford students? We
decided to find out.
Kathy decided to risk her life
for The Daily. She approached a
Cal student dressed in red and
white.
"Do you know that you're
wearing Stanford colors? We're
from Stanford — what do you
think of us?"
Shocked, the Weenie immedi
ately responded, "All Stanford
students are clean-cut and rich."
Although we're too mature to
stereotype all Weenies, we found
that Cal students met our expec
tations. During our walk we

passed three Hare Krishnas,
enough punkers to fill a Dead
Kennedys concert and five dazed
students celebrating Guy Fawkes
Day. Who is Guy Fawkes? We
don't know, and we didn't want
to ask.
Lost and a little freaked out,
we longed for a familiar sight —
anything to help us escape from
Bezerkely. . . oops, Berkeley. A
fro-yo store on Durant Street
seemed ready to offer us refuge.
Yogurt Village turned out to be
a fro-yo lover's paradise. With
six exotic flavors, millions of top
f>ings and an enormous serving
or only 90 cents the store gave
us the will to continue our mis
sion.
Next stop on our quest to un
cover the essence of Cal was an
actual sorority house. Unlike
Stanford, Cal has 15 housed
sororities and 42 fraternities. . . .
And people think the Greek sys
tem is intense at Stanford.
We picked one of Cal's most
popular sororities and ventured
in for a tour. The palace . . . uh
. . . house was immaculate,
decorated in pink and beige with
Oriental carpets covering wood
floors and huge windows over
looking San Francisco.
The girls were as elegantly
dressed as the house was
decorated. We knew they would
have the answer to the question
that plagues Stanford students.
"Do people date at Cal?" Lori
asked.

"Of course. We go out all the
time," one skinny blonde
remarked.
On the way to the admissions
office to pick up transfer applica
tions we decided to eat our way
out of depression and stopped at
Blondie's Pizza.
For only $1, we bought a slice
of greasy pizza three times larger
and ten times better than Co Po
pizza. A Cal landmark, Blondie's
Pizza even delivers a large, 16-
inch pizza to a dorm room for $7.
Not only do restaurants
feature cheaper and more deli
cious food at Cal than at Stan
ford, but record stores and cloth
ing shops also offer more flavor
and variety than the over-priced
stores at the Stanford Shopping
Center.
Across the street from
Blondie's Pizza, Rasputin's
Record Shop specializes in used
and unusual records, as well as
Marilyn Monroe posters.
Palo Alto is sorely lacking in
good outdoor cafes, but we had
no trouble finding one at
Berkeley. At Roma's we loaded
up on cappucino and Diet Coke
before making the trek back to
our car, which we had parked in
the $2-an-hour lot.
With a sigh of relief upon dis
covering that the stereo was still
in the car, we pulled on our red
sweatshirts with the bold Stan
ford insignias and made our
escape from Weenieland. Mis
sion accomplished.

pizza. A Cal landmark, Blondie's
Pizza even delivers a large, 16-
inch pizza to a dorm room for $7.
Not only do restaurants
feature cheaper and more deli
cious food at Cal than at Stan
ford, but record stores and cloth
ing shops also offer more flavor
and variety than the over-priced
stores at the Stanford Shopping
Center.
Across the street from
Blondie's Pizza, Rasputin's
Record Shop specializes in used
and unusual records, as well as
Marilyn Monroe posters.
Palo Alto is sorely lacking in
good outdoor cafes, but we had
no trouble finding one at
Berkeley. At Roma's we loaded
up on cappucino and Diet Coke
before making the trek back to
our car, which we had parked in
the $2-an-hour lot.
With a sigh of relief upon dis
covering that the stereo was still
in the car, we pulled on our red
sweatshirts with the bold Stan
ford insignias and made our
escape from Weenieland. Mis
sion accomplished.

Berkeley students protest the lack of adequate office space for campus
minority organizations.
For one day, we undertook a
dangerous mission. We crossed
enemy lines, ventured into un
charted territory. For one day,
we became Weenies.
Because Big Game is at home
this year, and Stanford students
don't have to leave plush Palo
Alto, we traveled incognito to
discover the real UC-Berkeley.
Driving up Telegraph Avenue,
Cal's equivalent of Palm Drive,
we immediately saw a striking
difference between the two
campuses.
We thought we had entered the
Twilight Zone. The spirit of the
1960s is very much alive and well
at Cal. In contrast to scenic Palm
Drive with its gorgeous view of
Mem Chu, Telegraph is lined
with hippies selling tie-dyed T
shirts and with students hurrying
to their classes.
Perched at the top of
Telegraph is Sather Gate, a large
copper arch marking the official
entrance to Weenieland. Sather
Gate is the famous sight of most
of the major Cal riots in the '60s.
Silly us; we thought the '60s
were over. Unfortunately no one
has told this to Cal students —
obviously a serious deficiency in
their education.
As we innocently walked
through Sather Gate we got
swept up in a silent protest

march. By Stanford standards
this march was huge. About 500
students marched through the
campus with clenched fists up
held.
According to Krishna Henry, a
sophomore, Cal's ethnic minor
ity groups were protesting the in
adequate office space provided
for student services. Their
offices are housed in 40-year-old
"temporary" shacks that re
minded us of Manzanita Park —
except that the shacks were
wooden and puce-colored.
"Cal's administration is just as
conservative as Stanford's,"
Henry said, noting that the Cal
administration had yet to ac
knowledge the protesters'
demands.
As we talked to with Henry his
common misconceptions about
Stanford became apparent. What
do Cal students really think
about Stanford students? We
decided to find out.
Kathy decided to risk her life
for The Daily. She approached a
Cal student dressed in red and
white.
"Do you know that you're
wearing Stanford colors? We're
from Stanford — what do you
think of us?"
Shocked, the Weenie immedi
ately responded, "All Stanford
students are clean-cut and rich."
Although we're too mature to
stereotype all Weenies, we found
that Cal students met our expec
tations. During our walk we

passed three Hare Krishnas,
enough punkers to fill a Dead
Kennedys concert and five dazed
students celebrating Guy Fawkes
Day. Who is Guy Fawkes? We
don't know, and we didn't want
to ask.
Lost and a little freaked out,
we longed for a familiar sight —
anything to help us escape from
Bezerkely. . . oops, Berkeley. A
fro-yo store on Durant Street
seemed ready to offer us refuge.
Yogurt Village turned out to be
a fro-yo lover's paradise. With
six exotic flavors, millions of top
f>ings and an enormous serving
or only 90 cents the store gave
us the will to continue our mis
sion.
Next stop on our quest to un
cover the essence of Cal was an
actual sorority house. Unlike
Stanford, Cal has 15 housed
sororities and 42 fraternities. . . .
And people think the Greek sys
tem is intense at Stanford.
We picked one of Cal's most
popular sororities and ventured
in for a tour. The palace . . . uh
. . . house was immaculate,
decorated in pink and beige with
Oriental carpets covering wood
floors and huge windows over
looking San Francisco.
The girls were as elegantly
dressed as the house was
decorated. We knew they would
have the answer to the question
that plagues Stanford students.
"Do people date at Cal?" Lori
asked.

"Of course. We go out all the
time," one skinny blonde
remarked.
On the way to the admissions
office to pick up transfer applica
tions we decided to eat our way
out of depression and stopped at
Blondie's Pizza.
For only $1, we bought a slice
of greasy pizza three times larger
and ten times better than Co Po
pizza. A Cal landmark, Blondie's
Pizza even delivers a large, 16-
inch pizza to a dorm room for $7.
