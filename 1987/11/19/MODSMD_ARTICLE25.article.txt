Watercourse Way is a self-described "family
bathing center." We, however, would describe it
as the perfect locale for any sort of aquatic frolick
ing you might desire.
Located at the corner of High Street and Chan
ning Avenue, Watercourse Way is everything your
dormitory bathroom isn't.
The first thing we noticed about this place (in
contrast to the post-industrial hell all around it) is
that it's nice. After checking in at the desk, Dave
and Jon were led past a rather large fountain, which
made up a portion of the entryway's wall, and Eric
traipsed off to the sensory-deprivation tank.
Down the hall we found a room with a bed, a
wood tub, a combination steam room/shower and a
cold plunge.
Living well through wetness
The room we had (one of nine available)
reflected Watercourse Way's general atmosphere
— a decor that combines both the traditional
Japanese and the less-traditional California styles.
First, Dave put on his bathing suit (while I faced
the wall). Then I did the same. Then we ventured
into the white-tiled steam room that contained the
shower. Watercourse Way requests that all patrons

shower prior to using the tubs. The shower/steam
bath had been warmed for us and was equipped
with a bottle of peppermint shampoo.
The preliminaries complete, we returned to the
main room, where Dave hopped into the tub. After
the hot shower, however, I preferred to jump into
the cold plunge. Our tub and plunge were both
made of a soft, comfortable wood.
The hot tub had the traditional jets, easily con
trolled with a single button at the tub's edge. The
cold plunge, about four feet in diameter and four
feet deep was the perfect medium between the
steam and the tub. Although the water was cool, it
was kept at a comfortable temperature.
Our visit to Watercourse Way, during midterms,
turned out to be a perfect escape from all the ten
sion that exams create. No, it isn't like going to
Disneyland — but it's fun anyway. No lines, no
screaming kids, and the floor isn't sticky
anywhere. It's a pure, relaxing form of entertain
ment — the kind everyone can use every once in a
while.
Ten minutes before the hour was up we were
warned with a pleasant knock and a loud reminder:
"Ten minutes!" We waited for seven minutes and
then attempted to move. Happy and warm, we
dressed. Relaxed and rather damp, we waited for
Eric to finish being deprived.
Like the Great Salt Lake, only better
No, 1 did not metamorphose into an ape-man, a
primordial blob or William Hurt, nor did my states

become otherwise altered iri any fashion.
In case you don't know what a sensory
deprivation tank is, it's a large, enclosed bathtub
filled with a foot or so of saline solution, so that
when you lie down in it you can actually float with
out any effort. The water is kept at body tempera
ture, thus canceling out any sensation you might
feel through your skin. When the door of the tank is
closed all light and sound is effectively blocked out.
The purpose of the tank is to isolate your mind
from your body by eliminating all sensory input
(except of course, for taste; so don't eat anything
really nasty before you go).
At Watercourse Way the tank is located in a
clean, comfortable room on the second floor. There
is a shower in the room, which you will definitely
want to use (that is, unless you enjoy walking
around all day covered with salt). Towels, sham
poo, conditioner and soap are provided.
The room also has a mattress to relax on and a
cassette player you can use to play music while
you're in the tank (if you want to defeat the entire
purpose of going in there). By the way, it might be a
good idea to bring a bathing suit.
I found the tank to be very relaxing. Some
people, however, are overwhelmed with boredom;
others with claustrophobia. Although I did have a
few interesting daydreams, the experience was
nothing like what the movie "Altered States"
might lead you to believe. No hallucinations, no
cosmic epiphanies —just absolute tranquillity. If
you're looking for a great way to unwind, or if

you're just plain curious, the sensory-deprivation
tank at Watercourse Way is well worth consider
ing.
From 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Watercourse Way
charges $6.50 per person per hour for a room with a
hot tub and shower, $8 for a room with a sauna or
steam-bath and a cold plunge. From 5:30 p.m. to
11:30 p.m. the prices increase $2. Note that per
sons tubbing alone during evening hours will pay an
additional fee of $4. In addition to the sensory
deprivation tanks at $20 for each 90-minute ses
sion, massages of various types and skin treat
ments are also available.
Innovative, enjoyable, and thoroughly relaxing,
Watercourse Way is a most welcome change from
typical Palo Alto entertainment. For not much
more than the cost of a movie you and a significant
other could have a great time. We would have to
say that your time and money are both well spent at
Watercourse Way.
