## Time to hate Cal 
### 
Yesterday I killed my
stuffed hear.
Zack was his name (short
for Zachary — my mother sent
him to me during a finals week
sometime in the past). I picked
Zack off the floor and went to
the closet to get some rope. I
tied a noose.

1 slung the rope over a hook
on the ceiling. I slipped the
noose over Zack's head. And I
strung him up.
Then 1 sat hack and watched
him die. Fivery once and a
while I reached up and poked
him — it was more fun watch
ing him swing back and forth.
Zack is going to stay hang
ing in that room at least until
Saturday because we Stanford
students finally have a reason
to hate the California Golden
Bears.
For the last three years 1
played along. 1 sang "The
Dirty Golden Bear," chanted
"We got in,"and referred to
Cal students as Weenies. But
there was a missing link.
If they are all attending the
university of their second
choice, and if Stanford keeps
beating them at Big Game,
then why do we hate them?
Alas, Big Game rolled
around last year, and Stanford
was 7-2, headed for a bowl
game, while Cal was 1-9, and
California Coach Joe Kapp

was headed for oblivion. It
looked as if the Cardinal
would win the Axe for the
third consecutive year.
But noooooooo.
Cal wide receiver Mike
Ford took a pitch on a reverse
and ran 47 yards straight at the
Stanford rooting section, and
straight into the end zone. We
had a perfect view of him gal
loping down the sideline. Ford
spiked the hall and pointed at
the Axe.
After the final gun of the 17-
11 Bear victory in Berkeley,
we watched the Weenies
swarm the field. Linebacker
Hardy Nickerson climhed the
hand conductor's ladder and
led the throngs in the Cal fight
song. We watched Kapp get
carried around the field. And
we listened to the Weenies
chant, "We've got the Axe."
I should have strung the
sucker up earlier.

On the Wednesday night
before Big Game in 1984 my
freshman resident assistants
showed us The Play on
videotape 10 times. They
pointed out every illegal
lateral and every downed
knee. They worked us into a
fury. This should he manda
tory training for all freshman.
Luckily, for the past three
years Big Game Week has
lived up to all the hype.
In 1984 the week began with
50 mice painted Blue and Gold
miraculously appearing in
Meyer Library. It was the last
time Stanford had a full rally in
