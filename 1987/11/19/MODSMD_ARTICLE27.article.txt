## Time to hate Cal 
### 
Yesterday I killed my
stuffed hear.
Zack was his name (short
for Zachary — my mother sent
him to me during a finals week
sometime in the past). I picked
Zack off the floor and went to
the closet to get some rope. I
tied a noose.

1 slung the rope over a hook
on the ceiling. I slipped the
noose over Zack's head. And I
strung him up.
Then 1 sat hack and watched
him die. Fivery once and a
while I reached up and poked
him — it was more fun watch
ing him swing back and forth.
Zack is going to stay hang
ing in that room at least until
Saturday because we Stanford
students finally have a reason
to hate the California Golden
Bears.
For the last three years 1
played along. 1 sang "The
Dirty Golden Bear," chanted
"We got in,"and referred to
Cal students as Weenies. But
there was a missing link.
If they are all attending the
university of their second
choice, and if Stanford keeps
beating them at Big Game,
then why do we hate them?
Alas, Big Game rolled
around last year, and Stanford
was 7-2, headed for a bowl
game, while Cal was 1-9, and
California Coach Joe Kapp

was headed for oblivion. It
looked as if the Cardinal
would win the Axe for the
third consecutive year.
But noooooooo.
Cal wide receiver Mike
Ford took a pitch on a reverse
and ran 47 yards straight at the
Stanford rooting section, and
straight into the end zone. We
had a perfect view of him gal
loping down the sideline. Ford
spiked the hall and pointed at
the Axe.
After the final gun of the 17-
11 Bear victory in Berkeley,
we watched the Weenies
swarm the field. Linebacker
Hardy Nickerson climhed the
hand conductor's ladder and
led the throngs in the Cal fight
song. We watched Kapp get
carried around the field. And
we listened to the Weenies
chant, "We've got the Axe."
I should have strung the
sucker up earlier.

On the Wednesday night
before Big Game in 1984 my
freshman resident assistants
showed us The Play on
videotape 10 times. They
pointed out every illegal
lateral and every downed
knee. They worked us into a
fury. This should he manda
tory training for all freshman.
Luckily, for the past three
years Big Game Week has
lived up to all the hype.
In 1984 the week began with
50 mice painted Blue and Gold
miraculously appearing in
Meyer Library. It was the last
time Stanford had a full rally in


Chris
Fialko
the City, with a long march
through San Francisco and the
Band concert at Aquatic Park.
The game marked the emer
gence of a redshirt freshman
named Brad Muster. He rumbled
for 204 yards as Stanford
overcame an early 10-0 deficit to
defeat the Bears 27-10. The post
game celebration was marred
slightly by Berkeley security
guards who tackled Stanford fans
trying to rush the field and beat
several students with billy clubs.
The game ball was given to
then junior linebacker Dave
Wyman. who had wrecked his
knee a week earlier when he was
crack-back-blocked in the
Arizona game.
In 1985 the "S" and the "U"
in the "South San Francisco, the
Industrial City" sign along High
way 101 were painted red. And a
giant Cardinal football helmet
was placed on the head of the
statue of Father Junipero Serra
along Highway 280.
Fire returned to Lake Lagunita
after an extended hibernation as
the Big Game bonfire tradion was
rekindled, but both Stanford and
Cal were sub-.500.
The game itself was a
rollercoaster ride. The Cardinal
dominated for the first 35
minutes and led 24-0. Then the
Bears roared back to score 22
straight points in five minutes.
From there on out it was a
cliffhanger, as an ironically
named Cal field goal kicker,
Leland Rix, missed a possible
game-winning 30-yard field goal
with 8:32 left on the scoreboard.
As Stanford tried to kill the
clock, the game continued to be
nerve-wracking for Stanford and
Cal fans alike. On third-and-22.
Cardinal quarterback John Paye
astoundingly found receiver Jeff
James to keep the drive alive.
And on third-and-eight. Muster
ran a gutsy sweep to get the first
down. The Axe stayed on the
Farm.
Last year was simply bizarre.
The band was on probation and
received a pardon only a few
days before the game. The rally
in the City did not include any
marching. And the best Stanford
team in a decade lost to the worst
California team in a decade.
Finally, someone had stolen
the 500-pound Cal mascot, Oski.
How do you steal something that
weighs 500 pounds? More impor
tantly, can you find a rope strong
enough to hang it?
