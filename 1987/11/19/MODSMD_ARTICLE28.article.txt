# UCLA visits for key matchup
##

The moment of truth is here.
The Stanford women's volley
hall team will try to clinch the
Pacific 10 Conference title
tonight against the UCLA
Bruins, the team that gave the
Cardinal its only league loss.
Stanford, the third-ranked team
in the country, is 23-4, 15-1 in the
Pac-10; the fifth-ranked Bruins
are 27-7, 12-3. The match begins
at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
With only a UCLA-USC
match remaining after this
weekend — to be played Tues
day — league play is nearly over.
Stanford and UCLA are the only
teams with a shot at wearing the
conference crown.
The Cardinal has won 15 con
ference matches in a row since
falling to UCLA Sept. IS, a
league record. Stanford has now
clinched at least a tie with the
Bruins for the league title. A win
tonight, or tomorrow here
against USC, would give the Car
dinal the second-ever Pac-10 title
outright. UCLA won the league
last year hy finishing one game
ahead of Stanford.
"UCLA is real strong," said
Stanford Coach Don Shaw, "and
they're playing really well now."
Really well is an understatement,
as the Bruins have now won six
straight matches, despite the bat
tle UCLA Coach Andy Banac
howski has been lighting against
injuries the past month-and-a
half.
The Bruins lost senior middle
blocker Stacy Buck when she
hurt her knee, but she returned
from arthroscopic surgery to lead
her team to a four-game upset of
fourth-ranked Brigham Young in
Provo, Utah, two weeks ago.

With Buck back, Banachowski
now has the No. 2 hitter in the
Pac-10 (.376 percentage) and the
league's third-best blocker (1.42
blocks per game).
Complementing Buck is the
other Bruin middle blocker,
sophomore Daiva Tomkus.
Tomkus leads the conference in
service aces, is second in blocks,
sixth in hitting percentage and
eighth in kills. "Daiva Tomkus is
playing great," Shaw said.
" They've got plenty of talent."
The Bruins have needed this
strong play from that pair be
cause other injuries have greatly
weakened their depth at outside
hitter. Freshman Samantha
Shaver, who had a great match
against Stanford in September,
recently needed to have a bone
chip removed. She is not ex
pected to return this year.
Also out is another freshman
outside hitter, Traci Broadway,
who had worked her way into the
starting lineup before developing
a stress fracture. She is likely
done for the year as well.
In recent years these losses
would not have made much of a
difference, but this year's Bruin
squad lacks depth. While
UCLA's top six is as good as al
most any team in the country, the
Bruins have only seven players
really ready to play at the college
level. While seniors Lori Zeno
and Wendy Fletcher are great
players, the third outside hitter
spot needs to be tilled by a fresh
man who hasn't had the high
school experience Shaver and
Broadway have.
Banachowski used frosh Pia
Svenson and Ali Dickson in the
big win at BYU; a key for tonight
is whether their inexperience can
be used to the Cardinal's advan
tage.

The Bruins do have one of the
top defensive players in the
country in back row specialist
Julie Barnes. Look for her to give
Buck a rest and dig a lot of balls
tonight. The Bruins also will
likely use sophomore Hilary Mal
loy in a similar role.
One other department in which
the Bruins are loaded is setter.
The two best setters in the Pac-10
take the floor tonight as UCLA
junior Ann Boyer squares off
against Stanford senior Wendi
Rush. Boyer, a 6-0 from Poway,
was a second-team All-America
last year and is currently second

in the nation in assists, trailing
only Cindy Cox of Colorado
State.
Rush currently trails only
Boyer in assists in the Pac-10 and
is also second in digs in the
league. The leader of the Stan
ford attack has been a three-time
All-America selection here and
has outdone her rival by being
named the Pac-10 Player of the
Week five weeks ago, an award
Boyer has not received this year.
When she is setting Rush will
often look for this week's Pac-10
