# Bigger Brad is better
## 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
In August 1983 a freshman running
back named Brad Muster arrived on the
Stanford campus for fall practice.
He didn't attract much attenion. The
lanky Novato native stood 6-foot-2 but
weighed only 185 pounds and was not
highly touted coming out of a high school
(San Marin) in a small conference.
Stanford had a number of running
backs who were thought to be the future
of the Cardinal that year. Kaulana Park
was a junior, Kevin Scott and Brian Mor
ris were sophomores, and both Marshall
Dillard and Thomas Henley played ex
tensively as freshmen in 1983.
"I came here hoping to play as a fifth
year senior and maybe start," Muster
said.
"Marshall Dillard and Thomas Henley
were going to be the stars," Morris said.
"Brad was playing on the scout team.
Nobody even noticed him."
The next year, running back coach
Jimmy Walsh put Muster on a weight
training program to increase his size and
durability ("It wasn't very fun," Muster
said) and discussed a possible position
change with the second-year back be
cause of the large number of talented run
ners on the Stanford squad.
"There was no doubt about Brad's ath
letic ability," Walsh said. "It was just a
matter of where we wanted to play him."
According to Walsh, Muster could have
played in the defensive secondary
"without a doubt" and also could have
handled outside linebacker, wide receiver
and tight end.
Four years later and over forty pounds
heavier. Muster is the unquestioned star
of the Stanford offense and the object of
close scrutiny by the National Football
League.
"He has what people look for," Los
Angeles Raiders scout Ron Wolf said.
"He has a great ability to catch the ball
and a knack for hitting the open spot on
the line.
"Everyone in this business is trying to
get good football players, but they're a
rare breed," Wolf said. "Brad is among

them."
Last season, Muster rushed for 1053
yards and caught 61 passes while leading
the Cardinal to the Gator Bowl. In the
process he was named Pacific 10 Confer
ence Offensive Player of the Year and
made numerous All-America teams.
Muster was also an All-Pac-10 performer
and was named to the conference aca
demic team for the second straight year.
At the beginning of this season Muster
was considered a candidate for the
Hesiman Trophy but missed five games
with an ankle injury suffered on the first
day of fall practice.
"It's kind of frustrating," Muster said.
"I wanted to improve as a player, and I
didn't get the opportunity 1 was hoping to
get."
But Muster said he doesn't regret his
decision to remain at Stanford another
season — even though there was much
speculation that he might enter the NFL
draft last spring, after his fourth year of
school. "I never second-guessed
myself," Muster said. "There was a lot
more to it than playing pro ball. There
were a lot of other people involved, and 1
had a lot of opportunities in school 1 had
to choose from."
Despite his injury, the senior back
leads the Cardinal team with 456 yards
and six touchdowns rushing and has 17
receptions for 166 yards and one score.
Last week against Oregon State, Muster
rushed 20 times for 159 yards and two
touchdowns — in just the first half.
It's Muster's running style people com
ment on most, however. "I love to watch
Brad run," Walsh said. "It almost seems
like he's on a bike ride on a Sunday with
that pedaling motion; it's so hypnotic.
His stride length is pretty frightening —
he takes two steps and he's got seven
yards."
"Bradley is a hard runner and a very
fluid runner," said Dillard. who starts in
the backfield with Muster. "He's really
deceptive and does a lot of things no one
expects him to do because of his decep
tion."

When he got to Stanford Brad Muster hoped to play as a fifth-year senior, hut four years
and 40 pounds later, he can't keep the pro scouts oft his back.
Muster credits his success to
listening to his coaches. "I've
had a lot of good coaches during
my playing time, from Pop
Warner (grade school-level foot
ball) to Stanford," he said.
"They're out there to help their
players improve, and they know
what's best for you."
"He's real diligent, and he has
good work habits," said Walsh,
who has coached Muster for four
years. "He's been such a con
stant — you can always count on
Brad. There hasn't been one
meeting he's missed, and he's
never missed his weight room
commitment. You know the sun
is coming up, and you know that
Brad will be there."
"There were some intangible
things we didn't see in the begin
ning," Morris said. "He's got a
great heart, and he's mentally
tough. He's a real workhorse."
