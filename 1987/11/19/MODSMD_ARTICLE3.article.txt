# Gym gets condom dispensers
## Encina installs campus’ first contraceptive vending machines

They're here.
Stanford's first condom dis
pensers were installed yesterday
in two Encina Gym restrooms,
and several additional machines
will be installed later this week in
Encina and Roble Gyms, accord
ing to Athletic Director Andy
Geiger.
Council of Presidents member
Leonard Adler said he met with
Geiger about the idea Tuesday
morning and Geiger "gave the
go-ahead" for Auler to get the
machines. Adler called the ven
ding machine distributor yester
day, and company representa
tives in a mobile telephone
dispatched van arrived — ready
to install the machines — in 30
minutes.
Geiger said that he responded
to input from the Stanford com
munity and from the Committee
on Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation in making his de
cision to allow the vending
machines in Athletic Department
facilities.
Adler said he plans to meet
with University library officials
and the Housing Operations Ad

visory Committee (HOAC) to
morrow to ask them to approve
the installation of machines in li
braries and dormitories.
Last spring, a survey of 400
students conducted by students
in a human biology class showed
widespread campus support for
installing condom machines in
campus restrooms, and the
ASSU Senate later passed a bill
supporting the proposal.
The newly installed machines
at Encina, one in a men's room
and one in a women's room, dis
pense lubricated Protex brand
condoms for 50 cents each.
Senior Daniel Bao, director of
the AIDS Education Project, said
condom machines in restrooms
are "an idea whose time has
come." He noted, however, that
"people should plan ahead" and
that a greater variety of condoms
sold at cost (9 to 15 cents) are
available in the Contraceptive In
formation Center at Cowell and
at the Safer Sex Shoppe in White
Plaza.
Neither Geiger nor Adler knew
where profits from the machines
will go, but Geiger said he
doubted they would benefit the
Athletic Department. A contract

with the vending machine com
pany has yet to be signed.
Sophomore Christina Fuller, a
member of HOAC, said she
thinks having condom vending
machines in dorms is "a fine
idea/' Soto Residence Fellow
Frenchie Perry also voiced sup
port for the idea, saying the
machines could be "pretty
shocking, especially to parents
