# Dante's fire leads Stanford into Big Splash
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti has two axioms for
anyone who wants to play water
polo on the Farm: "Don't be a
jerk, and swim fast."
That's the extent of Det
tamanti's rule book. Although a
lack of other rules may draw
criticism of his disciplinary skills,
no one can criticize Dettamanti's
results in his 10 years at the helm
of Cardinal water polo. Heading
into this weekend's Big Splash
against Cal he is 271-44-6.
Those 271 victories include
Five national championships. The
other five years? A mere two
second-place and two third-place
finishes at the NCAA Champion
ships. Overall, his NCAA Cham
pionship record is 23-4, the best
of any coach in the country.
"He knows how to get you to
win," senior driver Matt Tingler
said of Dettamanti.
Dettamanti's key to success at
Stanford has primarily been his
excellence at team strategy. He
has always been able to adapt his
plays to changes in his team and
in the game itself, according to
junior goalie Todd Kemp.
For example, there used to be
a limit on fouling; a defensive
player could only commit two
consecutive fouls. A third con

secutive foul resulted in a 35-
second ejection, during which
the defense would be a man
short. The old strategy, accord
ing to Dettamanti, was to get the
ball to the hole man twice, and
after the second foul the defender
would have to switch positions,
opening up an outside snot.
The three-foul limit has been
eliminated, and now the offense
relies more on pick-and-roll plays
and aggressive driving to create
open space.
The rule change has benefited
the Cardinal, according to Det
tamanti. "Our offense relies on
speed," he said. Faster players
are able to get around their
defenders more easily, thus cre
ating more open area.
However, speed has always
been essential to Dettamanti's
system. "The counterattack is
the crux of the system," Det
tamanti said.
His offense is commonly
referred to by other coaches as
unorthodox. "I like to run the
fast break," he said, "kind of
like the L.A. Lakers."
"He always tells us how of
fense starts with defense,"
Kemp said.
However unconventional his
offense may be. Dettamanti has
gained a reputation that places
nim among tne few coaches being
considered to head the 1992

Olympic team. Unlike volleyball,
however, coaching the Olym
pians in water polo is only a part
time job, and it would not inter
fere with his coaching at Stan
ford.
After playing water polo at
UC-Davis, Dettamanti enrolled
at UCLA, where he was a coach
ing assistant while he earned a
master's in the physiology of ex
ercise. "My goal was always to
be a college coach," he said.
"To be the best, you have to
learn from the best," he said.
"And at that time UCLA was the
best in both swimming and water
polo."
Dettamanti began coaching at
Occidental College in Los An
geles, where he coached both
swimming and water polo. "In
those days you had to coach
both," he said.
"It was great at Oxy. I could
run my own program," he said.
At Occidental Dettamanti in
herited an aquatics program that
frequently lost to Cal Tech, and
in three years he built a confer
ence champion that lost to the
country's dominant teams, such
as UCLA and USC, "by only
two or three goals."
"1 really learned how to recruit
there," he said. "I'd have to look
at 200 guys. If I was lucky, 20 of
them would apply and maybe
five or six would get accepted."

He then went to UC-Santa
Barbara, where he coached
water polo for three years. "1
probably would've stayed the
rest of my life (had 1 not come to
Stanford)," he said.
In 1976, after Stanford won its
first NCAA Championship,
Coach Art Lambert announced
his retirement, and Dettamanti
was chosen as his replacement.
"It was an opportunity to be a
top coach and have top teams.
(At Santa Barbara) we might
have had a good team every three
years or so. I now had the chance
to have one every year."
Dettamanti's credentials since
1977 speak for themselves. For
three consecutive years he has
been NCAA Coach of the Year
and has earned Pacific 10 Confer
ence Coach of the Year honors
seven times. He coached the
U.S. team to a gold medal at the
World University Games in 1979
and a silver medal in 1981.
His players have been equally
honored. Twenty-five of them
have earned a total of 51 All-
America selections, including
four current and three previous
members of U.S. Olympic teams.
"Stanford is the school every
high school water polo player
wants to attend," he said. But if
you're a jerk or swim like a rock,
forget it.
