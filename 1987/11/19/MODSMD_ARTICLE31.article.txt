# Cal swims with Card
## 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
Stanford swimming will kick off its
season today at deGuerre Pool with a 2
p.m. meet against California.
For both the defending NCAA cham
pion men's and runner-up women's
teams today's contest will be both the be
ginning of an unusually long season and
the first of four meetings with their cross-
Bay rivals.
The atmosphere should be friendly,
and the inter-school competition fierce as
ever. No team scores will be kept, but in
dividuals will certainly know how they
fared. For many Cardinal swimmers
today's meet marks the start of a 10-
month march to the Olympic trials.
"It's a chance to find out where we
are," senior co-captain Anthony Mosse
said. "It's also a big chance for the frosh
to swim their first meet. The teams are
pretty friendly, and no team scores are
kept, but it will still matter to individ
uals."
To make the meet interesting the

coaches have chosen to hold "double
distance" races. Instead of a 2(X)-meter
butterfly there will be a 4(H); instead of a
1000-meter freestyle, a 2(MM). The extra
distance will help the swimmers' training
and could — especially in the medley
events — produce many lead changes and
exciting finishes as each swimmer's best
and worst strokes will be twice as effec
tive or twice as damaging.
From a coaching standpoint, meets like
today's give the athletes both a break
from grueling two-a-day practices and a
tangible goal to point toward.
"It's real tough to train twice a day and
not have any meets in sight," Men's
Coach Skip Kenney said. "This is set up
to try and pick up on some of the excite
ment and hoopla of Big Game Week.
Times don't mean anything; it's just to
find out where we are in our training."
The women's team next competes in
the Long Course Senior Meet at
deGuerre Nov. 28-29, then they battle the
University of Pacific at home Dec. 4,
with Chico State and UOP visiting the
men's team.
