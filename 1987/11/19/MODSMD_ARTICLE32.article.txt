No one knows how she does it, but
she does it.
For the third consecutive year of her
three-year tenure at Stanford, women's
basketball Coach Tara VanDerveer has
landed one of the strongest recruiting
classes in the nation. Though basketball
season does not begin for a week-and-a
half, three high school seniors, all
ranked in the top 10 on the list of
prospects by USA Today, signed letters
of intent yesterday, concluding the fall
recruiting period.
"I'm ecstatic," VanDerveer said.
"Even if we had successfully recruited
just one of these outstanding players I
would have been happy."
Martha Richards, a 5-foot-11 guard
from Hudson, Wis., is perhaps the top
recruit in the nation. Richards, who was
named preseason First Team Ail-

American by both Street and Smith
magazine and by USA Today, last year
averaged 29.4 points per game, 9.1
rebounds, 5.2 assists and 3.1 steals.
"Martha is an extremely talented
player who runs the floor very well,"
VanDerveer said. "She's a very good
shooter capable of the three-point shot,
a Steve Altord type."
Joining Richards on the Farm next
fall will be 6-3 forward Julie Zeilstra and
6-0 forward Chris MacMurdo. Zeilstra,
a three-sport athlete from Vernal, Utah,
is rated preseason First Team Ail-
American by USA Today, Off the Glass
magazine and by Women's Basketball
News Service. In her junior season she
averaged 26 points, 17 rebounds and 11
assists per game.
MacMurdo. a native of Aiken, S.C.,
has been her state's AAA Player of the
Year for the past two seasons. Her
junior year she totaled 24 points, 13
rebounds and four assists per game.
