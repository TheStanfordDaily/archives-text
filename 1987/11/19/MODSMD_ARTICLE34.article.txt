# California's bid
## SLAC will not lobby for collider 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
Scientists at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center will
not participate in the state's lob
bying efforts to win the bid for
the nation's largest atom smas
her, according to the deputy di
rector of SLAC.
Sidney Drell explained that the
U.S. Department of Energy has
asked SLAC not to get involved
with lobbying efforts for the proj
ect, although SLAC scientists
can provide information for lob
bying uses.
He said that SLAC is funded
by the Department of Energy and
that the department has asked all
of its laboratories to stay out of
the lobbying efforts.
The Superconducting Super
Collider, known as SSC, will be
the largest atom smasher ever
built — about 20 times more
powerful than the atom smasher
at SLAC. The bid is scheduled to
be awarded in June.
California is one of about two
dozen states competing for the
federal project.
The atom smasher is consid
ered a major economic prize for
the state that wins the bid be
cause it will create between 4000
and 60(H) construction jobs and
will permanently employ about
2500 scientists and technicians.
California has come under

criticism by proponents of the
SSC because it submitted a bid
for the atom smasher only
minutes before the deadline,
causing some scientists to ques
tion the state's commitment to
winning what is considered the
nation's largest scientific project.
The state is proposing that the
supercollider be situated near
Davis or Stockton.
According to Bill Kirk, special
assistant to the director at
SLAC, the Energy Department
has prohibited federally funded
labs from agitating for their own
interests.
Drell said that scientists at
SLAC may "be interested in the
bid on an individual basis, but we
(SLAC) have our own research
efforts."
Kirk said the supercollider,
like SLAC, will be involved in
high-energy physics and will
search for sub-atomic particles.
However, Kirk said, "each fa
cility is aiming at sub-atomic re
search from a different direc
tion. . . . The research done at
SLAC and at the supercollider
will balance each other out."
Kirk explained that a major
difference between the two atom
smashers is that SLAC
"smashes" electrons, while the
SSC will use protons for its re
search.
In addition, the SSC will use a
superconducting magnet to speed

protons around a racetrack
shaped course, giving the
protons many opportunities to
smash into each other.
SLAC does not use a super
conducting magnet, but instead
shoots beams of electrons and
positrons down a tennis racket
shaped course. The electrons and
positrons smash into each other
in the loop section of the course,
causing collisions scientists hope
will yield a sub-atomic particle
called a Z or "zee-zero" particle.
Scientists at SLAC are seeking
the Z particle because it may lead
to new information about the
"Grand Unification Theory."
This theory would explain how
the four fundamental forces of
nature — gravitational, electro
magnetism, strong, and weak —
work together, Kirk said.
Kirk noted that a recently
renovated linear collider at
SLAC, finished last spring, is
still in the experimental stages.
He said physicists at SLAC
"are in the process of fixing the
bugs" in the collider and that it
will be operational by next
February or March.
The SLAC linear collider has
already produced the most pow
erful beam of electron particles
ever generated, with an energy
level of 53 billion electron volts.
Kirk said the SSC has come
under criticism by some scien
tists, who say the technology

used in the collider will be ob
solete by the time the project
enters the construction stages.
Kirk added that this criticism
does not apply to the SLAC col
lider because the recent techno
logical advances that threaten to
make the SSC obsolete are in the
field of superconductivity.
He said that since SLAC
doesn't use a superconducting
magnet, the SLAC linear collider
won't be rendered obsolete by
the new technology.
