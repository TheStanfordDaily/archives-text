# Group calls for diverse law faculty
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
A coalition of ethnic and
minority law students yesterday
released a compromise list of
demands calling on Law School
officials to "set minimum goals
in the struggle to eliminate the
problems of prejudice at the Law
School."
The Multicultural Council, a
fjroup of female, ethnic minority,
esbian and gay law students,
said in a notice circulated at the
Law School that Law Dean Paul
Brest should use the occasion of

the Friday appearance of former
visiting Law Prof. Derrick Bell to
answer the following demands:
• As of next fall, each first-year
student "should be taught by
both a minority and a woman
professor."
• The enforcement procedure for
the school's non-discrimination
policy, which is currently under
discussion in a faculty commit
tee, should be implemented
"before first-year on-campus in
terviews begin in the spring of
1988."
• A public commitment should
be made "to increasing minority.

women, cay and lesbian faculty
hiring anu to eradicating law firm
interviewing discrimination."
The three-point agenda
adopted by the council "will
make reasonable starting
points," said member Shelley
Wessels, "but we asked the dean
for a whole lot more."
Wessels, a second-year law
student and chair of the Gay and
Lesbian Law Students Associa
tion, said further demands w ill be
made in a prepared statement at a
Law School torum Friday on the
alleged mistreatment Bell suf
fered while teaching at Stanford

in the spring of 19K6.
Bell, a black professor at Har
vard Law School and an expert
on constitutional law. taught a
course on constitutional law to
first-year students that called the
Constitution a "racist docu
ment." The class caused a group
of dissatisfied students and pro
fessors to organize an series of
supplementary lectures to cor
rect the alleged deficiencies of
his course. The series was can
celed after a single session.
Presently all first-year students
receive instruction from one of
the five white women professors
on the faculty, but there are only
two minority professors teaching
first-year courses, and "at least
two more are needed," Wessels
said.

Brest, who, along with the
Multicultural Council is co
sponsoring Bell's appearance,
said last night that he had no
comment on the student
proposals, but that he would
make a statement at the noon
forum Friday.
Law Prof. Robert Gordon,
who invited Bell to speak, said
the students' call for affirmative
action was "appropriate" but

criticized the council's demand
that first-year students must be
exposed to women and minority
professors as "mechanistic."
"I'm not happy with lockstep
policy,'' Gordon said. "The
quota is a remedy of last resort."
Responding to the proposal for
a time limit on the school's Fac
ulty Placement Committee to im
plement an enforcement proce

dure for the school's non
discrimination policy. Assoc.
Dean Thomas Mcßride said,
"That's realistic."
Mcßride, who is responsible
for administering the non
discrimination policy, cautioned
that any new policy would
remain subject to revision even
after implementation in the
spring.
