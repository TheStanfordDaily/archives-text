# Ten percent cast votes in ASSU election
##

Voter turnout was no more or less than ex
pected in the ASSU fall general election yes
terday and Tuesday, as between 6(H) and 7(H)
students tried out standardized voting
machines rented from Santa Clara County.
"People (were) very inquisitive about the
polling machines," said Elections Commis
sioner Steve Baer, a senior. "I think that
(was) the big draw."
But Baer said voter turnout was lowered
by Tuesday's rain and by the fact that stu
dents won't receive refunds for voting in this
election.
The Election Conmmission expected no
more than 7(M) people to vote, he said.
"If they weren't going to get the refund,
they didn't vote," Baer said.
He said he hopes to obtain the results of
the election as early as tomorrow afternoon.
Students who voted over the past two days

decided the fate of two constitutional amend
ments proposed by the ASSU. They also se
lected three candidates to the Student Con
duct Legislative Council and as many as 13
graduate students to the ASSU Senate.
After major problems with counting ballots
in last spring's election, the ASSU decided
this fall to use the machines in this election to
promote efficiency and ensure accuracy.
Each of the nine polling places on campus
had three machines for undergraduates and
one for graduates.
"They're easy to use because they're stan
dardized like state and national elections,"
said pollster Hem Shah, a senior. "If people
have voted (in such elections) before, then
it's simple."
Two poll monitors at each polling place
gave voters students voting instructions and
information on the issues in the election.
Poll monitor Darren Schneider, a senior,
said he believed the ASSU "should have
spent more time publicizing such an expen

sive election." Costs for this election are esti
mated to total nearly $9(XK).
Junior Yoshi Murata, another poll monitor,
agreed. "Personally, I don't think (students)
are really well-informed (about the elec
tion)."
Several poll monitors agreed that the main
complaint of students was that each polling
booth did not have its own ASSU election
handbook.
Baer said he saw the election as "a warm
up for the spring (election)." He said the ef
fectiveness of this polling method can be bet
ter measured after the votes have been
tallied.
Baer said he will evaluate the efficiency of
future use of the voting machines and will
suggest improvements in a report to the
Council of Presidents.
The cost of the voting machines was $S.MX),
but the ASSU hopes that the high cost of the
machines will be an effective long-term in
vestment.
