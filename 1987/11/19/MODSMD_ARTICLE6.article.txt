### kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
A five-year-old suit hy the
University against a Stanford
alumnus accused of cutting
down trees in Stanford's
Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve was settled in the
University's favor Tuesday in
San Mateo County Superior
Court.
Coming after two days of
preliminary hearings that in
cluded remarks from Univer
sity President Donald Ken
nedy. the settlement ended
five years of legal disputes be
tween the University and Ed
ward Mendell, whose property
borders the University's 1300-
acre preserve, which is used
as an outdoor lab for profes
sors and students.
Mendell has agreed to pay
Stanford $70.(KM) in cash and
to build an 8-foot-tall fence be
tween Jasper Ridge and his
property, according to John
Schwartz, University vice
president and general counsel.
As part of the settlement,
Mendell, a 1968 graduate of
the School of Education, also
agreed to drop a $ I-million
countersuit charging the Uni
versity with spying on him and
of violating the terms of a 1986

court settlement.
The tree-cutting dispute
began in 1982, when Univer
sity personnel found Mendell
cutting down trees on the
preserve with a chainsaw,
Schwartz said.
In 1983, the University filed
suit against Mendell for cut
ting down the trees. Without
admitting guilt, Mendell
agreed to stay away from the
preserve and to pay the Uni
versity $5000.
A year later, in 1985, the
University discovered "whole
trees'' cut down and filed an
other suit against Mendell for
contempt of court, Schwartz
said. In this second suit a
judge ordered Mendell to pay
a $1000 fine.
The suit settled Tuesday
was a civil action that arose
out of the 1985 tree-cutting in
cident. Filed in August 1986
by the University, the suit
asked for about $250,000 in
damages and legal fees from
Mendell. Schwartz explained.
Saying he was "very
pleased with the settlement,
Mendell agreed to pay $70,000
but did not admit any liability.
"I have no hard feelings at
all for Stanford," Mendell
said.
