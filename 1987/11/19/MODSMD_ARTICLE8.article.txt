Deficit package nears completion
WASHINGTON — After four weeks of marathon talks.
White House and congressional negotiators yesterday
tentatively settled on key elements of a two-year, $75 billion
deficit reduction package but once again stalled short of an
agreement amid an outburst of criticism of the plan.
With a deadline of tomorrow that would trigger automatic,
across-the-board spending cuts looming nearer, negotiators
forged a plan that would trim the deficit by $30 billion in the 1988
fiscal year, with $9 billion in additional taxes and funding cuts
for Medicare, farm price supports, student loan programs,
defense projects and other programs, sources said. Another $45
billion in deficit reduction was projected for the next year.
However, several leading Republicans immediately attacked
the plan and questioned whether it could be approved.
"It's pretty weak. A pretty weak package unless you like
taxes," said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who
indicated that many Republicans would be hard pressed to vote
for it.
"It is so marginal as to be embarrassing," said Sen. Bob
Packwood of Oregon, one of the negotiators and the ranking
GOP member of the Senate Finance Committee.
Negotiators still expressed optimism that an agreement would
be reached today, however.
Soviet will allow U.S. verification
WASHINGTON — In what would be a major arms control
breakthrough, Soviet negotiators appear to have moved far
toward accepting a U.S. proposal for the presence of U.S. in
spectors at one or more missile production facilities in the So
viet Union for perhaps 10 years to help verify compliance with a
ban on medium-range nuclear missiles, the Los Angeles Times
learned yesterday.
A comparable U.S. missile production plant or plants, proba
bly those in Southern California that make cruise missiles,
would presumably be offered for Soviet inspectors to patrol,
U.S. officials said.
A State Department official said that the Soviets have ac
cepted the U.S. position, but a White House official said that
the matter is "still under discussion and not nailed down." An
accord would help clear the way for President Reagan and So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to sign a ban on medium-range
nuclear missiles during their meeting here Dec. 7 to 10.
Although the State Department and White House officials of
fered slightly different descriptions of how the inspection would
be conducted, both said that inspectors from the other side
would be permanently stationed at entrances to missile plants to
check material entering and leaving.
The prospective treaty will also provide for a specified num
ber of sudden visits by inspectors at other locations to watch for
cheating elsewhere, the officials said.
Housing starts take sharp plunge
WASHINGTON — Housing starts dropped 8.2 percent in
October, the largest monthly decline in three years, the govern
ment reported yesterday. Analysts blamed higher interest rates
for the drop, not the Oct. 19 stock-market collapse.
Analysts said they expect the housing market to improve
slightly this month and in December, primarily because the
stock market's decline last month has brought down interest
rates. Mortgage rates recently have declined more than 1
percentage point, to 10 or 10.5 percent, at many lenders around
the country.
"Builders may have pulled in their horns" and gone to the
sidelines, said Warren Lasko, executive director of the
Mortgage Bankers Association of America. "But they will be
back in November because (interest) rates are really down."
The Commerce Department reported that housing starts in
October fell to an annual rate of 1.51 million units, a reversal
from September, when starts rose 4 percent to 1.65 million
units. Single-family construction dropped 7 percent last month
to an annual rate of 1.1 million units, after a 6.8 percent rise in
September. Construction of multifamily homes fell 11.3 percent
to an annual rate of 410,000 units, compared with a 3 percent
drop in September.
Pilot inexperience cited in crash
DENVER — Controversy continued to mount yesterday over
the relative inexperience of the pilots of the Continental Airlines
jetliner that crashed on takeoff here Sunday, killing 28 of the 82
aboard.
"It was wrong to put those two people in the cockpit to
gether," said Wally Roberts, a veteran airline pilot who has
served both as an accident investigator and as a safety consul
tant for the Airline Pilots Association.
"The co-pilot was almost right off the street," Roberts said.
"His background was fine, but that meant fine to fly with an ex
perienced pilot. The pilot was fine, but he needed an experi
enced co-pilot. Together, it left something to be desired.
"I blame the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration). They
should have rules to prevent that sort of thing. Continental isn't
doing anything anyone else isn't."
In a press briefing Tuesday night, Jim Burnett, chairman of
the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigat
ing the accident, said that while Capt. Frank Zvonek, 43, of
Carlsbad, Calif., had over 12,000 hours total flight experience,
he had "only" 33 hours of time as a captain of a DC-9.
Burnett said the co-pilot, First Officer Lee Bruecher, 26, of
Houston, who had about 3150 hours of total flight experience in
commuter planes and other smaller aircraft before coming to
Continental in July, had "only" 36 hours and 36 minutes of
flight time in a DC-9, all of it with Continental.
Ousted Moscow head gets new job
MOSCOW — Boris Yeltsin, ousted as chief of the powerful
Moscow Communist Party organization a week ago, has been
given a government post with responsibilities for construction,
the official news agency Tass reported last night.
Yeltsin is now in the hospital with a heart condition after he
was publicly criticized by Communist Party leader Mikhail Gor
bachev and others for challenging the party's authority.
Yeltsin's removal from the Moscow job marked Gorbachev's
first major political crisis, exposing a split in the top ranks of the
party leadership.
Tass reported last night that Yeltsin will become a first deputy
chairman of the U.S.S.R. State Committee of Construction,
with ministerial rank. The title of minister will allow him to sit
on the Council of Ministers, the top administrative body in the
Soviet government.
The new job is a marked demotion for Yeltsin, one of the most
fervent supporters of Gorbachev's proposed reforms. As Mos
cow party chief, Yeltsin was made a candidate member of the
ruling Politburo, a title which he is sure to lose when the party's
Central Committee meets again.
