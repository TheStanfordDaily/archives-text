# Iran report blasts Reagan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” President Reagan
failed to carry out his constitutional oath of
office to "take care that the laws be faithfully
executed" and bears ultimate responsibility
for the Iran-contra scandal, the House and
Senate committees that investigated the affair
declared yesterday in their final report.
The sharply-worded report, signed by
three Republican Senators and all the Demo
crats on the special committees, charged that
Reagan repeatedly misled the Congress and
the public about secret activities, failed to su
pervise his subordinates properly and created
an environment in which a small band of ad
ministration zealots felt that lying to
Congress and defying established rules and
procedures were justified in pursuit of the
president's goals.
"The common ingredients of the Iran and
contra policies were secrecy, deception, and
disdain for the law," declared the long
awaited report, which capped a 10-month in
vestigation by the two special committees.

"What may aptly he called 'the cabal of the
zealots' was in charge," the report said.
"A small group ot senior officials believed
that they alone knew what was right. They
viewed knowledge of their actions by others
in the governmnent as a threat to their objec
tives," said the report, which was based on
three months of nationally televised hearings
and some 500 interviews with government of
ficials and other participants in the scandal.
These officials, the committees said, told
neither the secretary of state, the Congress
nor the American people of their actions and
when exposure was threatened, "they
destroyed official documents and lied to
Cabinet officials, to the public, and to elected
representatives."
In this atmosphere, the committees contin
ued, former officials of the National Security
Council staff and their private agents "could
lecture the committees that a 'rightful cause'
justifies any means, that lying to Congress
and other officials in the executive branch it

self is acceptable when the ends are just, and
that Congress is to blame for passing laws
that run counter to administration policy."
A minority report, signed by all six Repub
lican House members and two GOP Senators
on the committees, challenged the thrust of
the majority report and accepted Reagan's
explanation that the Iran-contra affair in
volved only "mistakes' that amounted to
little more than errors of judgment.
On one of the most crucial questions raised
by the affair, the committees' majority report
did not accept or reject Reagan's contention
that he had not known about the diversion of
funds from the Iranian arms sales to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
Nonetheless, "the president created or at
least tolerated an environment where those
who did know of the diversion believed with
certainty that they were carrying out the
president's policies," the majority said.
