# Students win drug-testing injunction

### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Calling the NCAA drug-testing
program "unconstitutionally
void and overbroad," Santa
Clara County Superior Court
Judge Conrad Rushing granted a
preliminary injunction yesterday
allowing all Stanford athletes ex
cept football and men's basket
ball players to compete in inter
collegiate sports without submit
ting to drug tests.
"The NCAA drug program, as
it is administered, violates the
California constitution and the
United States Constitution in
that there is no evidence of a
'compelling need' to engage in
drug testing of college athletes,"
Rushing wrote in his opinion.
"Moreover, even if a compel
ling need were shown the pro
gram is not narrowly tailored to
meet its goal," the judge added.
University attorney Debra
Zumwalt predicted that the ruling
will have a "strong" influence on
other suits brought by athletes
across the state and country be
cause of the federal precedent,
although she cautioned that the
case would only set a binding
precedent in California if it were

appealed and upheld in an ap
pellate court.
"But this ruling effectively
tosses the program out," Zum
walt said.
George Gangwere, who is gen
eral counsel for the National Col
legiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) but did not participate
directly in the case, said he
thought the NCAA would appeal
the decision and that was sure
that, in any event, the NCAA
"would not be dissuaded from

conducting a drug-testing pro
gram."
The decision came three weeks
after the end of hearings in which
Stanford student athletes Jenni
fer Hill and Barry McKeever
criticized the NCAA's premise
that participation in intercol
legiate athletics is "a privilege"
and that the right to privacy must
be subordinate to the interest of
competitive fairness protected by

Bam McKeever
drug testing.
McKeever and Hill were
represented by attorneys acting
on behalf of the American Civil
Liberties Union. Stanford acted
as a third-party "intervenor" in
the case, arguing for students'
rights and for a drug program
based on education rather than
on potentially punitive testing.
Stanford is the only university
to date to challenge the NCAA
program in court.
Rushing singled out football
and men's basketball as the only
sports whose athletes demon
strated evidence of significant
drug involvement and directed
the NCAA to present him with a
revised drug-testing program for
those sports by Nov. 30.
The judge appeared to have
been heavily influenced by test
results from last year, the first
year of testing, which showed
that 33 of 34 athletes who tested
positive for drugs and were
declared ineligible for postseason
competition were football or
men's basketball players.
The drugs detected in those
players were cocaine and an
abolic steroids.
On Dec. 4, Rushing will hear
arguments from NCAA lawyers
and lawyers for plaintiffs
McKeever and Hill before decid
ing whether a new program can
be implemented without violating
the "spirit" of his criticisms in

yesterday's "Intended Deci
sion."
Rushing will then issue a final
decision that is expected to
remain largely the same as yes
terday's ruling.
Hill, a senior in bioengineering
and co-captain of the women's
soccer team, said last night she
was "thrilled" with the decision
but "somewhat disappointed"
that it was "not a complete vic
tory."
Although she said she didn't
know whether she would con
tinue to actively press the case,
Hill said she "would definitely be
very supportive of the football
and basketball players."
McKeever, a junior in political
science and a linebacker on the
football team, and NCAA attor
neys Richard Archer and
Christine Hanson were un
available for comment last night.
In his 36-page ruling, Rushing
agreed with the students' conten
tion that the program violated
their privacy in three ways:
• interfering with the patient
physician relationship;
• unfairly reviewing the life style
of the student; and
• monitoring urination.
" Monitor' and 'collection'
are both euphemisms for a per
son staring at another during the
act of urination," Rushing said.
"It is only the exhibitionist, or
perhaps the voyeur, who will not
find this an offense against
decency."
Rushing faulted the NCAA for
not presenting a case that the
3(XX) drugs on its banned list ac
tually enhance athletic perform

ance. "The NCAA did not pres
ent any hard data showing that
anabolic steroids enhance per
formance," he said.
While anabolic steroids are
known to build muscle mass,
they have dangerous side effects.
Rushing noted. "What seems to
be true is that the perception of
advantage is itself an advantage
in playing sports."
"It is exactly this problem that
would be best addressed by an
educational program," he said.
In other passages, Rushing
criticized the inclusion of street
drugs on the list as "overly
prescriptive," and attacked "un
certain ' language on the list that
prevented athletes from knowing
whether a drug they had taken
would place them in violation of
the rules.
Rushing's decision to expand
the ruling to inclu Je the Fourth
Amendment of the U.S. Consti
tution came as a surprise to most
observers. The Fourth Amend
ment, which protects against un
reasonable "search and sei
zure," was not applied in the
January ruling for Simone
LeVant, a former Stanford diver
who filed the original drug
testing suit against the NCAA
last year.
Levant was granted a prelimi
nary injunction against the
NCAA program under the Cali
fornia constitution, but her case
was declared moot after she
graduated and became athleti
cally ineligible. Hill joined the
suit in February, and McKeever
and Stanford added their names
in July.

In August, Rushing issued
McKeever and Hill a temporary
restraining order against the pro
gram, enabling the athletes to
begin fall competition without
signing the drug-testing consent
forms required of all varsity ath
letes.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
who has been an outspoken op
ponent of the program since its
inception, applauded the ruling.
"I'm delighted," he said, adding
that he would certainly imple
ment testing for the football and
basketball teams if ordered by
the NCAA to do so.
"For the football team this
season, the point is moot,"
Geiger said, referring to the fact
that the squad will not qualify for
postseason competition this
year.

Calling the NCAA drug-testing
program "unconstitutionally
void and overbroad," Santa
Clara County Superior Court
Judge Conrad Rushing granted a
preliminary injunction yesterday
allowing all Stanford athletes ex
cept football and men's basket
ball players to compete in inter
collegiate sports without submit
ting to drug tests.
"The NCAA drug program, as
it is administered, violates the
California constitution and the
United States Constitution in
that there is no evidence of a
'compelling need' to engage in
drug testing of college athletes,"
Rushing wrote in his opinion.
"Moreover, even if a compel
ling need were shown the pro
gram is not narrowly tailored to
meet its goal," the judge added.
University attorney Debra
Zumwalt predicted that the ruling
will have a "strong" influence on
other suits brought by athletes
across the state and country be
cause of the federal precedent,
although she cautioned that the
case would only set a binding
precedent in California if it were

appealed and upheld in an ap
pellate court.
"But this ruling effectively
tosses the program out," Zum
walt said.
George Gangwere, who is gen
eral counsel for the National Col
legiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) but did not participate
directly in the case, said he
thought the NCAA would appeal
the decision and that was sure
that, in any event, the NCAA
"would not be dissuaded from

conducting a drug-testing pro
gram."
The decision came three weeks
after the end of hearings in which
Stanford student athletes Jenni
fer Hill and Barry McKeever
criticized the NCAA's premise
that participation in intercol
legiate athletics is "a privilege"
and that the right to privacy must
be subordinate to the interest of
competitive fairness protected by

drug testing.
McKeever and Hill were
represented by attorneys acting
on behalf of the American Civil
Liberties Union. Stanford acted
as a third-party "intervenor" in
the case, arguing for students'
rights and for a drug program
based on education rather than
on potentially punitive testing.
Stanford is the only university
to date to challenge the NCAA
program in court.
Rushing singled out football
and men's basketball as the only
sports whose athletes demon
strated evidence of significant
drug involvement and directed
the NCAA to present him with a
revised drug-testing program for
those sports by Nov. 30.
The judge appeared to have
been heavily influenced by test
results from last year, the first
year of testing, which showed
that 33 of 34 athletes who tested
positive for drugs and were
declared ineligible for postseason
competition were football or
men's basketball players.
The drugs detected in those
players were cocaine and an
abolic steroids.
On Dec. 4, Rushing will hear
arguments from NCAA lawyers
and lawyers for plaintiffs
McKeever and Hill before decid
ing whether a new program can
be implemented without violating
the "spirit" of his criticisms in

yesterday's "Intended Deci
sion."
Rushing will then issue a final
decision that is expected to
remain largely the same as yes
terday's ruling.
Hill, a senior in bioengineering
and co-captain of the women's
soccer team, said last night she
was "thrilled" with the decision
but "somewhat disappointed"
that it was "not a complete vic
tory."
Although she said she didn't
know whether she would con
tinue to actively press the case,
Hill said she "would definitely be
very supportive of the football
and basketball players."
McKeever, a junior in political
science and a linebacker on the
football team, and NCAA attor
neys Richard Archer and
Christine Hanson were un
available for comment last night.
In his 36-page ruling, Rushing
agreed with the students' conten
tion that the program violated
their privacy in three ways:
• interfering with the patient
physician relationship;
• unfairly reviewing the life style
of the student; and
• monitoring urination.
" Monitor' and 'collection'
are both euphemisms for a per
son staring at another during the
act of urination," Rushing said.
"It is only the exhibitionist, or
perhaps the voyeur, who will not
find this an offense against
decency."
Rushing faulted the NCAA for
not presenting a case that the
3(XX) drugs on its banned list ac
tually enhance athletic perform

ance. "The NCAA did not pres
ent any hard data showing that
anabolic steroids enhance per
formance," he said.
While anabolic steroids are
known to build muscle mass,
they have dangerous side effects.
Rushing noted. "What seems to
be true is that the perception of
advantage is itself an advantage
in playing sports."
"It is exactly this problem that
would be best addressed by an
educational program," he said.
In other passages, Rushing
criticized the inclusion of street
drugs on the list as "overly
prescriptive," and attacked "un
certain ' language on the list that
prevented athletes from knowing
whether a drug they had taken
would place them in violation of
the rules.
Rushing's decision to expand
the ruling to inclu Je the Fourth
Amendment of the U.S. Consti
tution came as a surprise to most
observers. The Fourth Amend
ment, which protects against un
reasonable "search and sei
zure," was not applied in the
January ruling for Simone
LeVant, a former Stanford diver
who filed the original drug
testing suit against the NCAA
last year.
