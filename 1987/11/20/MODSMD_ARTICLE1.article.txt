### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Calling the NCAA drug-testing
program "unconstitutionally
void and overbroad," Santa
Clara County Superior Court
Judge Conrad Rushing granted a
preliminary injunction yesterday
allowing all Stanford athletes ex
cept football and men's basket
ball players to compete in inter
collegiate sports without submit
ting to drug tests.
"The NCAA drug program, as
it is administered, violates the
California constitution and the
United States Constitution in
that there is no evidence of a
'compelling need' to engage in
drug testing of college athletes,"
Rushing wrote in his opinion.
"Moreover, even if a compel
ling need were shown the pro
gram is not narrowly tailored to
meet its goal," the judge added.
University attorney Debra
Zumwalt predicted that the ruling
will have a "strong" influence on
other suits brought by athletes
across the state and country be
cause of the federal precedent,
although she cautioned that the
case would only set a binding
precedent in California if it were

appealed and upheld in an ap
pellate court.
"But this ruling effectively
tosses the program out," Zum
walt said.
George Gangwere, who is gen
eral counsel for the National Col
legiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) but did not participate
directly in the case, said he
thought the NCAA would appeal
the decision and that was sure
that, in any event, the NCAA
"would not be dissuaded from

conducting a drug-testing pro
gram."
The decision came three weeks
after the end of hearings in which
Stanford student athletes Jenni
fer Hill and Barry McKeever
criticized the NCAA's premise
that participation in intercol
legiate athletics is "a privilege"
and that the right to privacy must
be subordinate to the interest of
competitive fairness protected by
