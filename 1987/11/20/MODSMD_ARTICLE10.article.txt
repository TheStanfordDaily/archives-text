cussions this week between Undersecretary

cluded Soviet statements that a new round of
U.N.-sponsored talks on Afghanistan is ex
pected to begin by February and should be

The State Department sources said
Vorontsov seemed to validate recent public
statements from a Soviet official that a troop
pullout could be completed seven to 12
months after an agreement, indicating a pos
sibility that Soviet forces would be out of Af
ghanistan by the end of the Reagan adminis
tration.

the Afghanistan war was described as one of
several purposes of the Shultz-Shevardnadze
meeting, wnich is to be formally announced
in Washington and Moscow today and is to
be the fourth round of talks by the two in little
more than two months.
One topic at the meeting is to be the

ingly sticky issue of his possible appearancc
before a joint meeting of Congress.
House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R
-III.) yesterday joined a GOP revolt against in
viting Gorbachev to address Congress.
Michel's announcement, which followed a
letter to President Reagan from 75 conserva
tive House members opposing a Gorbachev
address, put such an event in grave doubt.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said "as far as we're concerned'' Gorbachev
has not been formally invited to address a
joint congressional meeting.
