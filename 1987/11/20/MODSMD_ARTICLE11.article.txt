# Hundreds fast for hungry
## Proceeds will combat Third World problems 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Several hundred Stanford stu
dents gave up their University
Hood Service meals yesterday in
a campuswide fast aimed at al
leviating hunger in the Third
World, according to Food Ser
vice officials.
Food Service officials were
unable last night to provide exact
figures on the number of partici
pants.
The fast, sponsored by the
Stanford International Develop
ment Organization (SIDO) is ex
pected to raise about $3(HH) for
hunger relief projects, according
to SI DC) volunteer Megan
Beardsley.
Turning in their meal cards
after dinner Wednesday night,
students gave up two or three
Food Service meals yesterday,
depending on their meal plan.
University Food Service will
donate savings from the reduced
food consumption to two non
profit international relief pro
grams: the Ecumenical Hunger
Project and OxFam America.
Part of the savings will also be

used for a SIDO-sponsored de
velopment project in the Third
World, according to SIIX) volun
teer Cathy Ross. Ross said that
in past years the group has spon
sored a health clinic in Tijuana,

'There is world
hunger, and it's
more prevalent than
we realize. . . .
Most people don't
know what it's like
to be without food
for a day.'

Mexico, and a Salvadoran
refugee cooperative in Nic
aragua. "We haven't chosen the
project (for this year)," she said.
"We should choose it at the end
of the quarter."
According to William Carl

stead, assistant Food Service
manage! at Stern Hall. Univer
sity Food Service donates to
hunger relief only the amount of
money saved on food, not the
costs of labor or overhead.
Consequently, the amount
donated by the students giving up
their meals is less than the actual
cost of each meal.
Carlstead said the amount of
money finally donated is reduced
further by students who turn in
their meal cards and then sneak
into the dining halls and eat
anyway, thus reducing Food Ser
vice's savings. There is "a large
minority (that) grab salads and
milk and peanut butter sand
wiches and sit down and eat,
trying to be sly about it,"
Carlstead said.
Ross said SI DO hopes the fast
will "show people how they can
do something concrete and effec
tive" to help relieve hunger in
the Third World and "raise the
consciousness" of the campus.
