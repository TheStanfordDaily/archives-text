Frances Conley feels burned by
Jane Fonda — but not from
doing too many leg lifts. Conley
is suing Fonda for publishing an
allegedly unauthorized photo of
her in Fonda's book "Women
Coming of Age."
The photo originally ap
peared in an August 1982 Time
magazine article called "The
New Idea of Beauty" with the
provision that it would not be
published anywhere else, ac
cording to photographer John
McDermott.
"Dr. Conley had been very
reluctant and wouldn't grant to
do it unless it didn't appear
anywhere else," said McDer
mott, who has also tiled a suit
claiming Time violated federal
copyright laws by selling the
photo to Fonda without his
permission.
Conley's suit names Fonda,
co-author Mignon McCarthy,

the Book-of-the-Month Club,
Time magazine and Simon and
Schuster, the book's publisher.
It was tiled two years ago and is
scheduled to go to trial this
spring, according to Conley's
attorney, John Tyndall 111.
McDermott's suit names the
same parties.
"For Conley, this is a viola
tion of the California civil code,
which says you can't use a per
sonal photo or information for
commercial purposes without
the consent of that person,"
said Tyndall, who is also hand
ling the McDermott case.
Conley works with many
Vietnam veterans in her
neurosurgery practice and "has
had some negative comments
by patients and other neurosur
geons," according to Tyndall.
"Fonda is not particularly
popular with Vietnam veterans
or veterans in general," he
said. "People assume there's
some kind of alliance with
Fonda, or that Fonda paid

her."
According to McDermott,
the reappearance of the photo
in Fonda's book came as "a
mutual surprise. I had given
(Conley) my word that it would
never happen, but [Time] had
retained, without my knowl
edge, the original copy of the
photo."
McDermott refuted claims
by lawyers for the defendants
that he gave permission to print
the photo. "Nothing like that
ever occurred. Flad it not been
for the fact that Dr. Conley and
1 had become friends, I would
have been a defendant in the
lawsuit."
McDermott noted that a pho
tographer owns all the rights to
his work in the absence of a
written agreement or contract,
and alleged that Time had ear
lier used one of his photos with
out his permission.
"In an effort to make some
money they set up a syndica
tion service where they would
resell pictures," he said.
