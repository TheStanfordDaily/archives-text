### 
When the morrow comes the cardinal-clad
gladiators will take to the gridiron for pitched
battle with the blue-and-gold minions of Califor
nia.
Eventually, mayhap, the bothersome Bears
will recognize their natural inferiority to the
mighty Cardinal, and these yearly skirmishes
will no longer be necessary. But in the meantime
it must needs be that the two parties engage each
other in the ritualistic warfare known as Big
Game.
Hardly will the rosy fingers of dawn have
reached out to tickle the Foothills and flatlands
of the Farm on the morrow before hordes of hor
rible Golden Bear supporters will invade the
stadium to beseech their team to perform fantas
tic football feats against the courageous Cardinal
eleven. Forsooth, the Stanford backers must ex
hort their squad with every bit as much vigor and
excitement, raising a terrific tumult lest their
warriors fall flat and fail to win back the coveted
and hallowed Axe.
Alas and alack, in years past the Farm faithful
have allowed themselves to be outdone in this
regard, and the Axe has too often found itself
estranged from its rightful owners — they who
live in the shade of El Palo Alto.
Violence must be done unto the impudent and
pusillanimous pigskin pretenders who call them
selves Bears when, really they ought more

rightly to be called the Weasels, mayhap the
Opossums or Mongooses.
Every sign indicates that the Cardinal will
demonstrate its superiority to the lowly ones
from across the Bay.
Only five years ago the crafty and devious
Bears committed the most heinous and infamous
of football felonies ever, flipping the ball hither
and thither whilst returning a kickoff, and then
weaving through a wayward band of court
musicians to score and rob the Cardinal of a
hard-earned Big Game victory and a bowl berth
with a play — "the Play" — of altogether dubi
ous legality.
Since that darkest and most despicable day,
the pigskin pugilism has been fought evenly,
with the Berkeley barbarians and the honored
men of Stanford emerging triumphant from r; ie
fray twice each. Now comes the contest to settle
once and for all the disputed dowry that is the
Axe.
Kicking the Golden Bears hither and yon on
the earthen surface of the stadium seems the
most appropriate manner by which to settle the
matter, and that is the fervent hope held out be
the Cardinal backers.
In the course of the morrow's battle, forsooth,
Stanford, urged on by its feverish fans, will take
the Bears to task and fulfill its manifest destiny,
vanquishing the flea-bitten ones and bringing the
burnished blade back to its blessed birthplace.
