Column lacked
sensitivity, depth
Andrew Berkowitz's column
"Bug Me" Nov. 17 is shocking
for its complete lack of sensitiv
ity and its trivialization of impor
tant political and social issues.
Berkowitz seems completely ig
norant of the nature and purpose
of the Black Student Union.
Indeed, Berkowitz's column is
decidedly antagonistic. "En
tering the Black House I found
my path blocked by a student.
He didn't seem particularly
thrilled to see me there." This is
precisely the kind of ignorance
and hostility the "You Can Make
A Difference" conference at
tempted to dispel.
If Berkowitz writes on such
important issues in the future we
hope he will do so with more in
sight, depth and sensitivity.

Help save the
W. Culture tracks
The proposed restructuring of
the Area One requirement would
make Area One resemble closely
the present "Conflict and
Change" program in its educa
tional philosophy and approach.
Past student evaluations of the
Western Culture program indi
cate that the student body will

not rate such a program highly.
"Conflict and Change" has
consistently ranked near the bot
tom of these student evaluations
relative to the other tracks.
Therefore, instead of regarding
"Conflict and Change" as a
model, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies should look to
those tracks that the student
body rates most favorably, such
as Humanities, Structured
Liberal Education and Great
Works. (These tracks, by the
way have, already integrated the
works of minorities and women
to the task force's satisfaction.)
The statistics of the past
clearly indicate that we once
cared about the Western Culture
program â€” why aren't there
more of us speaking out now that
the program is at stake?

No prohibition
on P/NC option
The Daily editorial on Nov. 16
offered opinion and advice to the
Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement (C
-AAA), which this year plans a
review of the general University
grading system. The editorial
misstates the status quo with
respect to the use of the student
elected "pass."
As a University matter, a stu
dent who elects the "pass"
where an instructor permits it
may use the course to satisfy any

Stanford baccalaureate degree
requirement. In fact, where
writing, distribution and lan
guage requirements are con
cerned, there is neither prohibi
tion nor limit on the student's use
of courses taken on a pass basis.
Further, students may use such
courses in satisfaction of major
requirements to the extent per
mitted by the individual depart
ments and programs.
It is the case that two years ago
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies (C-US), which form
ulates policy about undergradu
ate distribution requirements,
proposed that students should
present only letter-graded
courses in satisfaction of these
requirements. However, the Ac
ademic Senate returned that rec
ommendation for reconsidera
tion. No proposal emerged
during 1986-87. It remains to be
seen whether C-US will discuss
the matter in the current year.
C-AAA is at a preliminary
stage of its review of the grading
system. As Prof. Wellbery told
the Academic Senate on Nov. 12,
the Committee's thrust will be to
address the question: "Does the
current grading system function
to motivate student achieve
ment?" So important a matter
deserves care with the facts,
thoughtful consideration of the
purpose and use of grades within
and without the University and
candid discussion of the extent to
which current and alternative
systems support the University's
goals for graduate and under
graduate education.
