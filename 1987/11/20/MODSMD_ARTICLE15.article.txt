## Need dialogue to end ignorance 
### 
I have been following the gay people and
fraternities with great interest. One of the
great failures of my life has been my inability
to reconcile my "fraternity type" personality
with being gay. As a result, I am happy but
dubious about the optimism being expressed.

Most of my friends from senior year of high
school and freshman year of college went on
to join fraternities. I went through rush and
received some bids but didn't join my friends
because I knew that I couldn't explore my
sexuality in a fraternity.
When I came to Stanford as a graduate stu
dent, I found that being openly gay made it
virtually impossible to make similar friends.
The irony of the turnabout hit me most
strongly while I was distributing flyers for a
gay group. I was turned away at the Stanford
chapter of the fraternity I almost joined at my
undergraduate school. I felt a chill when I
saw the look of hostility in their eyes as they
told me, "Nobody here would be interested
in that."
Since that time I have had ample opportu
nity to observe what happens to gay men in
fraternities at Stanford. During my nine
months as a live-in counselor at the Bridge, 1
talked to at least a dozen gay men living in
fraternities. Most were frustrated, some even

suicidal, but they chose not to act on their
gay feelings because it would jeopardize their
position in the house.
At gay socials I met a group of gay men
who have a kind of split personality of frater
nity life and gay life that only comes together
with the small group of fraternity friends who
are sensitive enough to be told.
Over the years I have heard rumors about
all of the houses, and I have actually met gay
men living at SAE, Sigma Chi, Phi Delts,
KAs, Dekes and Betas. 1 have no doubt that
there are gay men living in all Stanford frater
nities and that none of them feel they can
openly share their feelings.

My own experience suggests
that ignorance can always be
overcome and that anyone can
learn to be comfortable with
gay people.

I admire Vinny Frost's honesty two weeks
ago in stating what I believe is the prevailing
attitude in Stanford fraternities. His follow
up column makes me wonder whether this
issue will deteriorate into a battle of political
rhetoric.
The real issue here is whether the members
of a fraternity can feel comfortable living with

a gay man. It would defeat the purpose of the
fraternity system to force a house to accept
someone who makes them uncomfortable.
They have to believe that they can easily
shower with him, honestly welcome the male
dates he will bring to their socials, proudly
talk about their gay brother during Rush and
staunchly defend him against criticism from
alumni and the national chapter, just as they
would for a Jew, black or any other minority
member of their house.
I don't believe that these problems are in
surmountable. My own experience suggests
that ignorance can always be overcome and
that anyone can learn to be comfortable with
gay people. But my experience with Stanford
fraternities convinces me that overcoming ig
norance in even a handful of fraternities is a
monumental task.
The plan to have gay/lesbian speaking
engagements in fraternities is a excellent first
step, but an even stronger educational cam
paign is necessary. Individual fraternities
should arrange talks from their gay alumni
and from gay faculty and staff. The Univer
sity should organize some open forum discus
sions.
If true progress is to be made on this front
we need significant and uninhibited discus
sion. My fear is that the fraternities will in
stead choose to maintain the status quo while
spouting all the right words about equality
and nondiscrimination.
