# U2 love affair is finished
## 
### 
Dear Bono,
Let me say from the outset that I am not a "hard
core" fan. I'm one of the converts who jumped on
the bandwagon after the Joshua Tree. I don't know
the words to "Twilight." 1 only have one poster,
and sometimes I can't even remember which one of
you is Larry.
But 1 suspect that my love affair with U2 has
been quite similar to that of your other faithful fol
lowers. 1 remember taping the Joshua Tree from
my RA (1 told you 1 wasn't hard-core) and liking a
few of the songs. A few. Then, slowly but surely, I
began to embrace the album, finding myself moved
by the "sound" and the ideas.

Within a month or so I was walking down the hall
naked, boldly proclaiming that the Joshua Tree was
the "greatest album ever made." (Just kidding.)
But there is some truth to that statement. 1 began
to discuss the album with fellow students, treating
it more like a spiritual text than a rock album. We
discussed lyrics, themes and style. Every day I
would hear something new. But always, always,
we ended up simply reveling in the music. What an
overpowering sound!
In this cruel, absurd world we live in, where
Janet Jackson passes off as great music, there is
sometimes little to hope for. But then you four
came out of the blue and sang about things that
were important, with an intensity that was breath
taking. You felt our pain, asked our questions and
dreamt our dreams. You gave us hope, and we
loved you for it.
You simply dwarfed other groups as you
powered your way to the top of the charts. I
couldn't walk down a hall last year without hearing
at least one person playing one of your records.
Your concerts sold out instantly, and you must
have sold enough paraphernalia to cover half of
Alaska.
It is no surprise that U2 fans have a contempt for
other music fans, because the U2 fans are listening
to the greatest rock band in the world, while every
one else is listening to garbage. But it was surpris
ing to watch the hard-core U2 fans cringe as people
like me started to figure out "the truth." One friend
of mine practically cried when she saw your picture

splattered on the cover of Time. "They've ruined
it," she said.
I could not figure out why your old fans were so
dismayed at your phenomenal success. After all,
"the masses" were suddenly showing good taste
and rewarding quality music instead of that top-40
trash. Why not rejoice in this unexpected develop
ment?
Which brings me to last Saturday night, at your
concert in Oakland. The masses showed up, and
they wanted to hear you in full force. By the time
the first chord of "Where the Streets Have No
Name" was played, I was so hyper that the 13-
year-old girls in back of me had to hold me down.
Quite an opening.
Unfortunately, by the end of the show I realized
what your fans were so afraid of, although it is diffi
cult to put my finger on it. Your old fans were
afraid that money and fame would tarnish you. Ap
parently it has. The music is now secondary. What
is primary is the fact that you guys can fill up a
stadium in minutes and say or do anything you
want.
You can make some ridiculous distinction be
tween graffiti art and vandalism. You can bring out
some incoherent old fool on crutches who appar
ently still loves you even though you spray-painted
on his masterpiece. You can let him spray some
gibberish over your set in a gesture of good will.
You can cuss out some kid for not letting a couple
of balloons go off during one of your songs. You
can preach about the failures of everyone from
Ronald Reagan to the San Francisco police force. I
guess when you've achieved deity status you can
get away with those things.
I'm certainly not sc naive that 1 expect you to be
the same righteous souls you used to be before the
Joshua Tree. Power affects people in profound
ways. But it seems to me that you have a special
obligation to carry yourself in a way befitting a
"moral super-group." Along with all that control
and influence comes responsibility.
Or maybe you don't. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe
the moral of the story is that it is dangerous to
idolize a musical group, to expect more from you
than you have to give. We should expect you to do
stupid things just like the rest of us. You're only
mortals.
Maybe it was wrong for me to keep turning on a
U2 tape everytime 1 felt lonely or depressed. I
should have realized that music is only a temporary
escape, not a permanent solution to all of my prob
lems. You yourself have said that people make far
too much of the music. As one paper put it, "It's
getting hard to take U2 seriously."
I guess that's the way it should be.

and rewarding quality music instead of that top-40
trash. Why not rejoice in this unexpected develop
ment?
Which brings me to last Saturday night, at your
concert in Oakland. The masses showed up, and
they wanted to hear you in full force. By the time
the first chord of "Where the Streets Have No
Name" was played, I was so hyper that the 13-
year-old girls in back of me had to hold me down.
Quite an opening.
Unfortunately, by the end of the show I realized
what your fans were so afraid of, although it is diffi
cult to put my finger on it. Your old fans were
afraid that money and fame would tarnish you. Ap
parently it has. The music is now secondary. What
is primary is the fact that you guys can fill up a
stadium in minutes and say or do anything you
want.
You can make some ridiculous distinction be
tween graffiti art and vandalism. You can bring out
some incoherent old fool on crutches who appar
ently still loves you even though you spray-painted
on his masterpiece. You can let him spray some
gibberish over your set in a gesture of good will.
You can cuss out some kid for not letting a couple
of balloons go off during one of your songs. You
can preach about the failures of everyone from
Ronald Reagan to the San Francisco police force. I
guess when you've achieved deity status you can
get away with those things.
I'm certainly not sc naive that 1 expect you to be
the same righteous souls you used to be before the
Joshua Tree. Power affects people in profound
ways. But it seems to me that you have a special
obligation to carry yourself in a way befitting a
"moral super-group." Along with all that control
and influence comes responsibility.
Or maybe you don't. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe
the moral of the story is that it is dangerous to
idolize a musical group, to expect more from you
than you have to give. We should expect you to do
stupid things just like the rest of us. You're only
mortals.
Maybe it was wrong for me to keep turning on a
U2 tape everytime 1 felt lonely or depressed. I
should have realized that music is only a temporary
escape, not a permanent solution to all of my prob
lems. You yourself have said that people make far
too much of the music. As one paper put it, "It's
getting hard to take U2 seriously."
I guess that's the way it should be.

Dear Bono,
Let me say from the outset that I am not a "hard
core" fan. I'm one of the converts who jumped on
the bandwagon after the Joshua Tree. I don't know
the words to "Twilight." 1 only have one poster,
and sometimes I can't even remember which one of
you is Larry.
But 1 suspect that my love affair with U2 has
been quite similar to that of your other faithful fol
lowers. 1 remember taping the Joshua Tree from
my RA (1 told you 1 wasn't hard-core) and liking a
few of the songs. A few. Then, slowly but surely, I
began to embrace the album, finding myself moved
by the "sound" and the ideas.

Within a month or so I was walking down the hall
naked, boldly proclaiming that the Joshua Tree was
the "greatest album ever made." (Just kidding.)
But there is some truth to that statement. 1 began
to discuss the album with fellow students, treating
it more like a spiritual text than a rock album. We
discussed lyrics, themes and style. Every day I
would hear something new. But always, always,
we ended up simply reveling in the music. What an
overpowering sound!
In this cruel, absurd world we live in, where
Janet Jackson passes off as great music, there is
sometimes little to hope for. But then you four
came out of the blue and sang about things that
were important, with an intensity that was breath
taking. You felt our pain, asked our questions and
dreamt our dreams. You gave us hope, and we
loved you for it.
You simply dwarfed other groups as you
powered your way to the top of the charts. I
couldn't walk down a hall last year without hearing
at least one person playing one of your records.
Your concerts sold out instantly, and you must
have sold enough paraphernalia to cover half of
Alaska.
It is no surprise that U2 fans have a contempt for
other music fans, because the U2 fans are listening
to the greatest rock band in the world, while every
one else is listening to garbage. But it was surpris
ing to watch the hard-core U2 fans cringe as people
like me started to figure out "the truth." One friend
of mine practically cried when she saw your picture

splattered on the cover of Time. "They've ruined
it," she said.
I could not figure out why your old fans were so
dismayed at your phenomenal success. After all,
"the masses" were suddenly showing good taste
and rewarding quality music instead of that top-40
trash. Why not rejoice in this unexpected develop
