# Ruling's exceptions draw fire

### Christ Fialko Senior staff writer 
Superior Court Judge Conrad Rushing's ruling
against the NCAA drug-testing program will
cause student athletes to be treated uneaually,
Stanford athletes and coaches said yesterday.
Rushing issued an injunction barring the
NCAA from testing Stanford athletes for drug
use, except for those on the football and men's
basketball team. In the future, therefore, Stan
ford football and basketball players may be
tested, while their fellow student athletes in
other sports will not.
Rushing ruled the NCAA has a "compelling
reason" to test football and basketball players
because 33 of the 34 violations discovered in last
year's testing occurred among athletes in those
sports.
Last night Stanford Basketball Coach Mike
Montgomery expressed opposition to the differ
entiation between athletes imposed by Rushing's
ruling. Although he had not had a chance to read
the ruling last night, Montgomery said he was "a
little surprised" that Rushing singled out football
and basketball players.
"The (drug) problem in the first place is a
societal problem and is not just athletes,"

Montgomery said. "The same logic could be ap
plied to athletics — you shouldn't just pick on
football and basketball athletes."
Stanford wide receiver Jeff James agreed.
"My original opinion was that I opposed the
testing mainly because athletes were singled out
from the rest of the students," James said.
"Obviously the ruling doesn't change that —
football and basketball players will still be sin
gled out."
Stanford basketball player Todd Lichti voiced
similar complaints. "I think it's ridiculous that
some athletes will get tested, and others won't,"
Lichti said. "I'm indifferent as to whether we
get tested or not, but it seems a little awkward
that only some of us will be tested. "
But junior Howard Wright, a forward on the
basketball team, said he thought the ruling was
understandable.
"Although we're not the biggest sports fig
ures, we are role models," Wright said. "When I
was growing up some college players were my
role models, so I can understand where the
NCAA is coming from. You have to admit that
college athletics is a business, and what is on TV
every week is not tennis or water polo — it's
top-10 football and basketball."
