## UCLA offers 'AIDS: The Modern Plague' AIDS class takes ethical approach 
### Angle Kim Staff writer 
A course on AIDS taught by a biology professor
at UCLA has stirred interest not only on that
campus, but nationwide.
Richard Siegel, who teaches a course titled
"AIDS: The Modern Plague," said he decided to
offer the class last year so that "the Biology De
partment [could| use AIDS as a vehicle to under
stand the culture which we are now in, as well as
the origins of our culture and where our culture is
heading.''
Because of Siegel's approach to the topic, the na
tional media, including the Associated Press and
ABC-TV, have focused attention on him in recent
weeks.
Like UCLA, Stanford has also introduced a
course on AIDS this year. The SWOPSI course is
titled "Politics of AIDS: Fear and Loathing in
America." The classes at both universities attempt
to tackle issues — aside from the biological issues
— that surround the disease.
"Even just the course name is controversial,"
Siegel said of the UCLA class. "By stating that
(AIDS) is a modern plague, I'm implying that there
is collective destiny involved here, that it's going to
lead the human race to societal dislocations —
maybe even disaster," he said.
The uniqueness of the course is due to the fact
that it focuses on humanities even though it is pre
sented by the Biology Department at UCLA.
"Of course biology is important," Siegel said.
"But when it comes to a matter like this, which in
volves everyone in the world, it becomes more
than a matter involving science.
"Before being a biologist, a person must be a
humanist. How can students learn about AIDS if
they don't learn about themselves and their values
first?" he asked.
Only 14 students signed up for the course when it
was offered for the first time last winter quarter.
Within a year, however, interest in the course has
increased dramatically. Administrators at UCLA
said they expect at least S(H) students to register for
the course this winter quarter.
"Maybe it was my Moby Dick analogy that
[generated so much interest)," Siegel joked.
Siegel said he begins the course by giving a
lecture on the theme of "Moby Dick," intimating
that he is Ahab leading an expedition to a common
i»oal — to discover neonles' values that are formed
rom their different backgrounds and cultures.
Siegel said he hopes his class generates as much
interest as possible throughout the student body at
UCLA and among the general public, in order to in

form the greatest number of people about the full
impact AIDS could have on society.
"We need to recognize the depth of this public
health disaster," he said, adding that the reality of
AIDS "brings the world closer together.
"We realize that we're all one, we're one world,
and we form the human race. We can't combat
| AIDSI by ourselves. Maybe the newspaper arti
cles, Associated Press releases and IV news stories
will be a beginning'' to help people realize that they
need to work together, he said.
Stanford classes that deal with AIDS include ad
vanced courses in human biology and the SWOPSI
course, which is the first of its kind at the Univer
sity.
While these courses have not attracted the same
number of students as the UCI.A course has, they
are creating a stir in the student body.
Instructors of the SWOPSI class said they feel
the course has not generated as much interest as
the UCLA class because it is new this year,
whereas the UCLA class is a year older.
While the Human Biology Department offered

courses last year that incorporated AIDS into dis
cussion, this is the first year that a course has been
offered that deals with AIDS specifically.
The Human Biology Program office said that the
AIDS-related courses Human Biology introduced
last year received a "favorable response," but that
does not expect a great increase in enrollment in
these courses this year.
Instead, officials said they hope to stir more in
terest in a new class — titled "The Impact of
AIDS" — to be introduced spring quarter.
Robert Siegel (no relation to Richard Siegel), the
instructor of this new class at Stanford, said that
response from students has been "greater than an
ticipated." However, due to the fact that the class
will focus on the scientific aspects of AIDS, he said
he does not anticipate a response like the one at
UCLA.
"It's difficult to assess just exactly how [these
courses will) affect Stanford, since we haven't had
any classes directly dealing with AIDS until this
year," Robert Siegel said.

Instructor Pat Christen teaches the SWOPSI class "Politics of AIDS: Fear and loathing in America." Like a
similar course at UCLA, the SWOPSI class deals with the societal and biological issues that surround the
disease.
A course on AIDS taught by a biology professor
at UCLA has stirred interest not only on that
campus, but nationwide.
Richard Siegel, who teaches a course titled
"AIDS: The Modern Plague," said he decided to
offer the class last year so that "the Biology De
partment [could| use AIDS as a vehicle to under
stand the culture which we are now in, as well as
the origins of our culture and where our culture is
heading.''
Because of Siegel's approach to the topic, the na
tional media, including the Associated Press and
ABC-TV, have focused attention on him in recent
weeks.
Like UCLA, Stanford has also introduced a
course on AIDS this year. The SWOPSI course is
titled "Politics of AIDS: Fear and Loathing in
America." The classes at both universities attempt
to tackle issues — aside from the biological issues
— that surround the disease.
"Even just the course name is controversial,"
Siegel said of the UCLA class. "By stating that
(AIDS) is a modern plague, I'm implying that there
is collective destiny involved here, that it's going to
lead the human race to societal dislocations —
maybe even disaster," he said.
The uniqueness of the course is due to the fact
that it focuses on humanities even though it is pre
sented by the Biology Department at UCLA.
"Of course biology is important," Siegel said.
"But when it comes to a matter like this, which in
volves everyone in the world, it becomes more
than a matter involving science.
"Before being a biologist, a person must be a
humanist. How can students learn about AIDS if
they don't learn about themselves and their values
first?" he asked.
Only 14 students signed up for the course when it
was offered for the first time last winter quarter.
Within a year, however, interest in the course has
increased dramatically. Administrators at UCLA
said they expect at least S(H) students to register for
the course this winter quarter.
"Maybe it was my Moby Dick analogy that
[generated so much interest)," Siegel joked.
Siegel said he begins the course by giving a
lecture on the theme of "Moby Dick," intimating
that he is Ahab leading an expedition to a common
i»oal — to discover neonles' values that are formed
rom their different backgrounds and cultures.
Siegel said he hopes his class generates as much
interest as possible throughout the student body at
UCLA and among the general public, in order to in

form the greatest number of people about the full
impact AIDS could have on society.
"We need to recognize the depth of this public
health disaster," he said, adding that the reality of
AIDS "brings the world closer together.
"We realize that we're all one, we're one world,
and we form the human race. We can't combat
| AIDSI by ourselves. Maybe the newspaper arti
cles, Associated Press releases and IV news stories
will be a beginning'' to help people realize that they
need to work together, he said.
Stanford classes that deal with AIDS include ad
vanced courses in human biology and the SWOPSI
course, which is the first of its kind at the Univer
sity.
While these courses have not attracted the same
number of students as the UCI.A course has, they
are creating a stir in the student body.
Instructors of the SWOPSI class said they feel
the course has not generated as much interest as
the UCLA class because it is new this year,
whereas the UCLA class is a year older.
While the Human Biology Department offered

courses last year that incorporated AIDS into dis
cussion, this is the first year that a course has been
offered that deals with AIDS specifically.
The Human Biology Program office said that the
AIDS-related courses Human Biology introduced
last year received a "favorable response," but that
does not expect a great increase in enrollment in
these courses this year.
Instead, officials said they hope to stir more in
terest in a new class — titled "The Impact of
AIDS" — to be introduced spring quarter.
Robert Siegel (no relation to Richard Siegel), the
instructor of this new class at Stanford, said that
response from students has been "greater than an
ticipated." However, due to the fact that the class
will focus on the scientific aspects of AIDS, he said
he does not anticipate a response like the one at
UCLA.
"It's difficult to assess just exactly how [these
courses will) affect Stanford, since we haven't had
any classes directly dealing with AIDS until this
year," Robert Siegel said.
