# Study targets loan defaulters

According to a study done recently at
UCLA, students who drop out of community
colleges and vocational schools are more
likely to default on Guaranteed Student
Loans (GSLs) than those who complete their
education.
Prof. Wellford Wilms, dean of the Graduate
School of Education at UCLA, conducted a
survey of more than 6000 students at West
Coast community colleges and vocational
schools in 1985. He found that 38 percent of
students who dropped out later defaulted on
loans, as compared to 17 percent of those who
finished their studies.
Wilms' study was mandated by the Califor
nia Assembly as a result of public outcry
against the high default rate. The taxpayer
bears the brunt of the problem, paying the in
terest on all GSLs and paying the full cost of
defaults.
The study — titled "Whose Fault is
Default?" — dealt only with vocational
schools and community colleges because
these institutions have the highest default
rates.
Wilms said the study should have no impact
on four-year schools but recommended that
these institutions carry out their own studies.
He said that more studies are needed before
decisive action can be taken to respond to the
problem of loan defaults. Such studies should
take into account student default patterns and
their connection with later levels of income.
For the present, however, schools should
counsel their students on the terms of GSLs,
he said.
Wilms also said that penalties for defaulting
on GSLs are minimal, limited to withholding
, tax refunds and docking salaries for federal
employees.
Wilms said he is particularly concerned
with the problem of schools that abuse the
GSL program. Some institutions specifically
recruit students who are eligible for GSLs be
cause of the money the loans bring in.
"Schools that abuse the program," he said,
"should be kicked out of it immediately."
Roberta Johnson, associate director of Fi
nancial Aids at Stanford, said the study
should have no effect on Stanford's aid
policies because Stanford has one of the
lowest loan default rates in the nation.
