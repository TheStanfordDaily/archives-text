# Stanford Instructional Television Network
## Network brings classes to working students 
### Bruce LeDesma 
Next year marks the 20th anniversary of the
Stanford Instructional Television Network (SITN),
a network that allows thousands of employees from
outside technology industries to take Stanford
classes via television.
Generating about $3 million a year in revenue for
the School of Engineering, the network sells
classes to such companies as IBM and Hewlett-
Packard.
SITN classifies its off-campus industrial students
in three categories: those who audit the course,
those taking it for a grade but no credit (with the
option to apply for credit later) and those taking the
course for credit.

Today the program extends
to more than 170 high
technology companies in
Silicon Valley, offering some
270 Stanford graduate courses

This last group of viewers are regular Stanford
students. Admitted to the graduate School of Engi
neering, they take courses while working toward
advanced technical degrees. They also pay tuition
in addition to the regular class fee charged to all
those taking the course.
Begun in 1968, SITN is an outgrowth of the
Honors Cooperative Program (HCP), an on
campus program that enabled company employees
to become part-time graduate students while simul
taneously maintaining their professional careers.
This program became so popular that the classes
soon became overcrowded, and more people were
requesting admission than could fit in the available
space.
Responding to the need for a broader program,
Prof. Joseph Pettit, then dean of the School of En
gineering, came up with the idea of having the stu
dents in industry remain in their workplaces and
view the classes live on television.
This new system dramatically increased the
number of people who could then enroll in Stanford
courses.
Problems arose in the system immediately when

many people questioned the quality of education
being offered without student-teacher interaction.
To address this concern classrooms were
equipped with microphones that could transmit
questions to the professor giving the lecture.
However, some questioned the effectiveness of
this program. "We were concerned students were
being exploited," said Prof. Robert Kincheloe,
now acting director of SITN.
To combat the problem, "in the early 1970s we
(SITN) took polls of the students to get their reac
tion (to the system)," Kincheloe said.
The positive results indicated that students
enjoyed the classes and still considered them of
high quality. Since then no significant complaints
have surfaced, although no more polls have ever
been conducted.
Today the program extends to more than 170
high-technology companies in Silicon Valley, offer
ing some 270 Stanford graduate courses in engi
neering, math, applied physics, computer science
and statistics.
The network has also increased its activities to
include videotaping selected courses and sending
them to remote locations around the country and
abroad. In these instances, a tutor must sit with a
small group of students, guiding discussion and
answering questions when needed.
Some consider this method more effective than
live television. "Students view at their conven
ience," said Judy Day, education specialist for
Hewlett-Packard's Santa Rosa division, adding
that many employees have meetings, project
deadlines and family lives to tend to. "They get an
awful lot more out of it [when they are] not under
pressure," she said.
Very recently SITN also began working with
SUNet, the on-campus cable network, to record
Stanford classes for on-campus students, a situa
tion that has sparked some controversy.
Critics complain that this limits student-teacher
interaction. Supporters counter, however, that stu
dents should have the option to watch the class on
television, or see the lecture in person if they want
to.
Only one course. Industrial Engineering 133,
currently substitutes television for live lectures.
Due to his busy schedule, Prof. Henry Riggs —
who teaches I.E. 133 and is also the University vice
president for Development — only gives two
lectures a week and videotapes the third.
"That is the one instance on campus where there
is a TV class," said Kincheloe. "Prof. Riggs has a
popular course, and yet his time is extremely lim

ited."
According to Kincheloe, however, the network
would prefer not to substitute class time for televi
sion. "The network itself would be reluctant to see
that happen. For one we don't have the facilities to
do it,"he said.
For the most part, students and industry seem
appreciative of the services provided by SITN. The
service remains a popular and convenient way for
employees working in outside industry to enhance
their knowledge and skill in their Held and, in some
cases, allow them to pursue advanced degrees.
Companies as well, often find it is to their advan

tage to place their employees in the program, and
usually pay all of the costs involved in enrolling the
employees in the class.
"I firmly believe that [employeesl should con
tinue their education," said Day, adding that in the
world of competitive high technology, knowledge
rapidly becomes outdated, and professionals must
continuously expose themselves to new material.
Commenting on the use of television in educa
tion, Kincheloe said, "|lt| can be a help, it can be
useful. But you have to be careful. The faculty (at
SITN) is not going to do anything that will degrade
the academic experience."

soon became overcrowded, and more people were
requesting admission than could fit in the available
space.
Responding to the need for a broader program,
Prof. Joseph Pettit, then dean of the School of En
gineering, came up with the idea of having the stu
dents in industry remain in their workplaces and
view the classes live on television.
This new system dramatically increased the
number of people who could then enroll in Stanford
courses.
Problems arose in the system immediately when

many people questioned the quality of education
being offered without student-teacher interaction.
To address this concern classrooms were
equipped with microphones that could transmit
questions to the professor giving the lecture.
However, some questioned the effectiveness of
this program. "We were concerned students were
being exploited," said Prof. Robert Kincheloe,
now acting director of SITN.
To combat the problem, "in the early 1970s we
(SITN) took polls of the students to get their reac
tion (to the system)," Kincheloe said.
The positive results indicated that students
enjoyed the classes and still considered them of
high quality. Since then no significant complaints
have surfaced, although no more polls have ever
been conducted.
Today the program extends to more than 170
high-technology companies in Silicon Valley, offer
ing some 270 Stanford graduate courses in engi
neering, math, applied physics, computer science
and statistics.
The network has also increased its activities to
include videotaping selected courses and sending
them to remote locations around the country and
abroad. In these instances, a tutor must sit with a
small group of students, guiding discussion and
answering questions when needed.
Some consider this method more effective than
live television. "Students view at their conven
ience," said Judy Day, education specialist for
Hewlett-Packard's Santa Rosa division, adding
that many employees have meetings, project
deadlines and family lives to tend to. "They get an
awful lot more out of it [when they are] not under
pressure," she said.
Very recently SITN also began working with
SUNet, the on-campus cable network, to record
Stanford classes for on-campus students, a situa
tion that has sparked some controversy.
Critics complain that this limits student-teacher
interaction. Supporters counter, however, that stu
dents should have the option to watch the class on
television, or see the lecture in person if they want
to.
Only one course. Industrial Engineering 133,
currently substitutes television for live lectures.
Due to his busy schedule, Prof. Henry Riggs —
who teaches I.E. 133 and is also the University vice
president for Development — only gives two
lectures a week and videotapes the third.
"That is the one instance on campus where there
is a TV class," said Kincheloe. "Prof. Riggs has a
popular course, and yet his time is extremely lim

ited."
According to Kincheloe, however, the network
would prefer not to substitute class time for televi
sion. "The network itself would be reluctant to see
that happen. For one we don't have the facilities to
do it,"he said.
For the most part, students and industry seem
appreciative of the services provided by SITN. The
service remains a popular and convenient way for
employees working in outside industry to enhance
their knowledge and skill in their Held and, in some
cases, allow them to pursue advanced degrees.
Companies as well, often find it is to their advan

tage to place their employees in the program, and
usually pay all of the costs involved in enrolling the
employees in the class.
"I firmly believe that [employeesl should con
tinue their education," said Day, adding that in the
world of competitive high technology, knowledge
rapidly becomes outdated, and professionals must
continuously expose themselves to new material.
Commenting on the use of television in educa
tion, Kincheloe said, "|lt| can be a help, it can be
useful. But you have to be careful. The faculty (at
SITN) is not going to do anything that will degrade
the academic experience."

Next year marks the 20th anniversary of the
Stanford Instructional Television Network (SITN),
a network that allows thousands of employees from
outside technology industries to take Stanford
classes via television.
Generating about $3 million a year in revenue for
the School of Engineering, the network sells
classes to such companies as IBM and Hewlett-
Packard.
SITN classifies its off-campus industrial students
in three categories: those who audit the course,
those taking it for a grade but no credit (with the
option to apply for credit later) and those taking the
course for credit.

Today the program extends
to more than 170 high
technology companies in
Silicon Valley, offering some
270 Stanford graduate courses

This last group of viewers are regular Stanford
students. Admitted to the graduate School of Engi
neering, they take courses while working toward
advanced technical degrees. They also pay tuition
in addition to the regular class fee charged to all
those taking the course.
Begun in 1968, SITN is an outgrowth of the
Honors Cooperative Program (HCP), an on
campus program that enabled company employees
to become part-time graduate students while simul
taneously maintaining their professional careers.
