# 'Gaieties' '87: hilarious again
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
It is 8 p.m. Wednesday
night, and Katie Kershner, the
producer of "Gaieties: The
Nightmare on Palm Street,"
has a problem. Sitting at the
back of Memorial Auditorium
during the final night of
rehearsals Kershner watches
as the orchestra plays, the cur
tain raises and Gaieties 1987
runs into the first of what will
be a long night of technical dif
ficulties.
The show stops, a few ad
justments are made, and then
the orchestra gamely starts up
again with the opening theme.
This time the Ram's Head
technical wizards pull off the
show's introduction flaw
lessly, and a half-hearted
cheer goes up from the 40 or
so crew members scattered
throughout the cavernous
auditorium.
It is less than 23 hours until
the curtain goes up on opening
night . . .
Putting on the annual Big
Game Gaieties — a musical
comedy show written, pro
duced and acted entirely by
students — is a Herculean
task, and one that Kershner
and director Brian "Vinnie"
Hoffman seem to relish.
The road to Gaieties '87
began way back in February,
when Kershner — who had
worked in a professional musi
cal theater company and was
the associate producer of last
year's campus production of
"West Side Story" — was se
lected as producer. A junior
majoring in history and politi
cal science, Kershner immedi
ately set to work picking the
artistic and technical staff with
whom she would work. Hoff
man, now a junor majoring in
international relations, was
chosen almost immediately as
director, and soon thereafter a
team of six writers was hired.

"I knew the writers were
funny," said Kershner, "be
cause they kept leaving funny
messages on my answering
machine." But, she joked, her
first priority wasn't humor. "I
told them my first objective
was for them to meet their
deadline. Getting the script in
late slows down the music."
A rough script was com
pleted by the third week of
May and was polished
throughout the summer. By
the first week in October the
script was more or less in its
final form. Then the musical
composers took the songs the
writers had created and put
music to them.
In early October over 70
students auditioned for ap
proximately 30 parts. Those
auditioning were required to
read a monologue, sing and
have their range tested, and
dance in a short chor
eographed routine.
"We all heard 'Hey hey
we're the Monkees' way too
many times," Kershner said.
The cast has rehearsed for
the show since Oct. 9, during
which time the actors had to
learn their lines, the dance
numbers and the songs. Mean
while, the technical crew and
costumers were busy in
Memorial Auditorium work
shops and various people's
rooms around campus creating
the visual effects, lighting and
props for the show. Not until
the final week did the rehear
sals move into Memorial
Auditorium — a frenzied week
of coordinating lighting, sound
and the rest of the technical
aspects of Gaieties.
. . . With the first show less
than a day away, Kershner
sighs about a dance number
that was re-choreographed an
hour ago, and hurries off to
consult with Hoffman and the
technical staff. They know
