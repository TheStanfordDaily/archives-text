# 'Hope': a child's view of war
## 
### Chip Catalano 
At a time marked by the
cynicism of stock market
crashes. Middle East strife,
AIDS and so forth, what could be
more refreshing than a film that
translates the ruin and chaos of
World War II into a little boy's
adventure?
"Hope and Glory," a new film
by writer/producer/director John
Boorman ("Deliverance," "Ex
calibur, rhe Emerald For
est"), is based on Boorman's
fond memories of his childhood
during the blitz of London in
World War 11. It's an intriguing
premise that makes for an ex
tremely entertaining movie.

The story centers on 7-year
old Bill Rohan (convincingly
played by first-time actor Sebas
tian Rice Edwards), a schoolboy
character semi-autobiograph
ically drawn from Boorman.
With his father s departure to
join the war effort. Bill is left at
home with his mother and two
sisters, adorable 5-year-old Sue
and 15-year-old Dawn.
The film traces the family's
wartime experiences through
Bill's eyes, from nightly air raids
on the city to Dawn's romantic
and rebellious encounters with a
Canadian soldier. When Bill is
not going through the drudgery of
school, he and his schoolboy
friends are having fun among the

ruins, which serve as their play
ground.
Because of the episodic nature
of the story, there doesn't seem
to be any narrative drive to carry
things along. As a result, the film
at times seems to move slowly.
In spite of this, the "Hope and
Glory" still succeeds at being
very amusing.
In many ways, "Hope and
Glory" is similar to Woody Al
len's "Radio Days." Both films
are very personal and have an ap
pealingly nostalgic tone that
presents a glorified appreciation
of childhood memories. But in
dealing with the issue of war,
Boorman goes a step further than

Allen in proposing the limits to a
child's ability to glorify things.
In one particular scene, a
young girl s mother has been
killed the night before in a bomb
ing raid.
One of the boys in Bill's
schoolboy clan is running up and
down the street announcing it to
everyone as if it were all a big,
fun game.
I3espite the inherent serious
ness of such a scene and of the
whole chaotic situation of World
War 11 itself, "Hope and Glory''
does a wonderful job of depicting
the simplicity, excitement and
wonder unique to a child's per
spective.
