# Good laughs save 'Cross My Heart'
## 
### Jennifer Reese Staff writer 
"Cross My Heart" is a short,
skimpy but surprisingly fresh
comedy. It doesn't do much that
hasn't been done before — it
won't knock anyone's socks off
— but it's at times very funny.
Although much of the movie is
flawed, it at least makes you
laugh.
"Cross My Heart" is about a
couple on a disastrous third date.
David is a geeky, nice guy, eager
to impress. On the day of his
long-awaited promotion, he is
fired and doesn't have the guts to
tell Kathy, whom he has invited
out to celebrate with him. On top
of this, he borrows his friend's
slick car and high-tech apart
ment, passing them off as his
own. The lies keep piling up.
He isn't the only apprehensive
and deceitful character, though.
Kathy neglects to tell David that
she smokes, and that she has a 7-
year-old daughter. The movie
centers around the twists and
turns of the evening as the two
try to hide their secrets and yet
somehow come together.
Much of this movie has a
cheesy 1970s feel to it — almost
like an episode from "Love
American Style" — and Martin
Short as David even looks a little
like Barry Manilow. But the sub
ject matter is firmly grounded in
the 1980s. The prolonged conver
sation and questioning before sex
is loaded with the concerns of the
AIDS generation. There's even a
sequence that plays off the
choice and use of condoms
At its heart, "Cross My
Heart" is basically a comedy
about sex today. Central to the
movie is a very long bedroom
scene that makes fun of the
modern mating ritual. The
bedroom scene is like a movie
within a movie. There's the
screwball comedy of the date,
then there's the bedroom com
edy which is more experimental
— and probably less funny.
The jokes in the bedroom
scene make fun of sexual insecu
rity: the fears most people have
of being unsexy, klutzy in bed or
just doing something foolish. The
laughs this scene induces are ner

vous laughs, and with them
comes a very slight feeling of
anxiety and a desire for the film
to move onto less sensitive terri
tory.
Kathy blows passionately in
David's ear trying to turn him on;
we know already that she's very
insecure about the evening.
David hates having his ears
touched; Kathy is momentarily
crushed and humiliated. It's done
as a joke, but it seems a little
cruel. It digs at a sore spot. The
movie lifts the covers off the un
romantic, unerotic, insecure side
of sex. Perhaps this is the stuff of
comedy, but in this movie it
seems too raw, a little in
sensitive. You smile nervously.
The characters seem too vulnera
ble.
The plot of this movie could
use some beefing up. It doesn't
hang together well at all. There

aren't any sensational turns of
plot; it all falls into a fairly pre
dictable pattern. But there are
laughs in this movie, and when
you're laughing it doesn't always
matter that the movie is basically
dumb and that the storyline is
inane.
Martin Short is funny as
David. He is not a good-looking
man, and it's slightly implausible
that Kathy wants this scrawny,
goony guy. But with a little leap
of faith it works out alright. The
movie needs Short's comic abil
ity more than it needs a hand
some face.
Annette O'Toole is a volup
tuous red-haired Meryl Streep
type. She's good on the whole,
but her character shifts too
abruptly from nice girl to nym
phomaniac. She isn't as credible
as Short.
The movie suffers from sexual

stereotyping, and O'Toole's
character may be a victim of this.
David and Kathy are squeezed
into narrow, stale sex roles that
don't really suit their characters.
David, who is an unassuming,
gentle guy through most of the
movie, is made into the
stereotypical male lech during
the pre-bedroom scene ("Men
want sex"). Kathy who generally
seems independent, smart and at
tractive is turned into the clinging
woman who wants commitment
before she makes love ("Women
want a relationship"). These atti
tudes are glued onto the charac
ters, and it doesn't seem natural;
it jars and slows the movie down.
This is certainly no great
movie. The plot is predictable,
trite and insubstantial. It treads
on some sensitive ground, but
doesn't really make it into any
thing special or memorable. But
there are some good laughs here.
