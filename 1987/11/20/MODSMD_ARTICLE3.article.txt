## 
### Russell korobkin Editorial staff 
The University has been served with a lawsuit
filed by a student who was severely beaten in an
alcohol-related tight on campus two years ago, ac
cording to a Stanford attorney.
The suit — which names as defendants Stanford,
the now unrecognized Delta Upsilon fraternity, the
Sigma Chi fraternity and juniors William McKelvy
and Randall Von Feldt — was filed by junior David
Curry, who suffered a collapsed lung after being
beaten by McKelvy and Von Feldt near the DU and
Sigma Chi houses April 11, 1986. The suit calls into
question to what extent the University and its or
ganizations are responsible for alcohol-related inju
ries on campus.
The suit was tiled by Curry in the Santa Clara
County Superior Court Oct. 9, 1986. According to
Debra Zumwalt of the Stanford Legal Counsel's
Office, the plaintiff had three years to serve the
complaint to the defendants, and the case only
arrived in her office recently.
On April 11, 1986, at 3 a.m., a fight broke out on
Lasuen Mall between Curry, McKelvey and Von
Feldt, all freshmen who had attended Rush parties
at the DU House (now 553 Mayfield) and the Sigma
Chi House. After the fight, which was eventually
broken up by a DU member. Curry was taken to
Stanford Hospital's intensive care unit where he
remained for over a week. University administra
tors and Stanford police said at the time the situa
tion was clearly related to alcohol abuse.
The complaint — the document outlining the suit
— accuses the defendants of negligence because
they "owned, controlled, supervised and
operated"' the premises on which alcoholic
beverages were being served and "knew, or in the
exercise of reasonable care, should have known"
there existed a "dangerous condition and unrea
sonable risk of harm of which the plaintiff was, at
all times hereinmentioned unaware."
It asserts that the defendants should have taken
steps to make the conditions safe
or to warn Curry of the danger
ous condition.
The complaint further states
that "Stanford University, Delta
Upsilon and Signa (sic) Chi
negligently failed to warn,
prohibit or control the conduct at
or near the premises."
Curry is asking for general and
punitive damages, medical ex
penses, attorney fees and lost
earnings, but the complaint does
not specify how much financial
compensation is being sought.
Curry said last night he was out
of school all of last year, but
would not comment further on
his suit or on the extent of his in
juries.

Zumwalt said the University
plans to defend itself
"vigorously" because "Stanford
is not liable for everything its stu
dents do."
The complaint argues that the
University is liable; it accuses
Stanford of permitting the frater
nities to provide alcohol to un
derage students and that the Uni
versity and the fraternities "at all
times herein mentioned, con
trolled and supervised the activi
ties of McKelvey and Von
Feldt."
Fraternal Affairs Advisor Joe
Pisano said the University is very
committed to its alcohol policy,
which is "predicated on individ
ual responsibility."
Pisano also said that Interfra
ternity Council guidelines require
fraternities to provide sober
party monitors but that in the
Curry incident events happened

so fast that virtually nothing
could be done.
Another issue addressed in the
complaint is that Curry, Von
Feldt and McKelvy were all
younger than the legal drinking
age at the time of the incident. It
contends the University and the
two fraternities "furnished
and/or sold alcoholic beverages
to the three minors."
Zumwalt, defending the Uni
versity, said the alcohol policy
clearly states that it is illegal to
serve alcohol to persons under
21.
Sigma Chi President Charlie
Ahern said his fraternity has not
been served with the complaint
and declined to comment.
Von Feldt also has not been
served with the complaint and
declined to comment on the mat
ter. McKelvy was unavailable for
comment.
