## Stanford hopes to Axe Cal in Big Game 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
This year's Big Game is a jour
ney into The Great Unknown.
Stanford (3-4 in the Pacific 10
Conference, 4-6 overall) and Cal
ifornia (2-2-1, 2-5-1) have had
their ups and downs this season,
and both teams have key injuries
going into tomorrow's I p.m.
matchup.
Stanford is favored by six
points over Cal, but then the Car
dinal was favored by 18 last year
and lost 17-11.
Cal quarterback Troy Taylor
will miss Big Game with a broken
index finger on his right
(throwing) hand. He broke it last
Saturday in the Golden Bears'
38-20 upset over Arizona State.
Of course, Taylor sat out last
year's Big Game with a broken
jaw — and Cal still came up with
the upset of Gator Bowl-bound
Stanford.
"1 know we won't be taking
anything for granted this year,"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
Taylor's replacement, senior
Brad Howe, will be facing a
defense that intercepted seven
passes in Stanford's 38-7 win
over Oregon State last week.
Howe has completed just five of
16 passes this season tor 68 yards
and one interception.
Taylor, just a sophomore,
completed 61 percent of his
passes for 2081 yards and a Pac
-10-leading 18 touchdowns this

season.
"Obviously Troy is an excel
lent quarterback," California of
fensive guard Kam King said.
"He can really spark the team.
But Howe is a good leader, and I
have a lot of confidence in his
ability."
Howe, whose father John let
tered in football two years at
Stanford, will have good
receivers to throw to. Former
quarterback Brian Bedford is on
the other end of passes this year
and has 37 receptions for 489
yards and four touchdovyns. The
senior has been hampered by an
ankle sprain but is probable for
tomorrow's contest.
Receiver Michael Ford has
caught 28 passes for 424 yards
and three touchdowns, and tight
end Darryl Ingram has 27 recep
tions for 380 yards and three
scores.
Without Taylor at quarter
back, however, first-year coach
Bruce Snyder is likely to rely
more on the running game than
the pass. California has a pair of
talented tailbacks in Chris Ric
hards (fifth in the conference in
rushing) and backup Tyrone
Moore, who ran for 173 yards on
20 carries last week.
"Howe hasn't gotten a lot of
snaps," King said. "Snyder
probably won't change the offen
sive game plan a lot, but we'll
probably try to establish the run
ning game first and then try to
balance things out a little more. 1

think we'll be able to adjust
fine."
Stanford has had good success
against the run this season,
however, especially near the goal
line. The Cardinal has allowed
just 12 rushing touchdowns all
season, lowest in the Pac-10.
The California defense is much
improved this season. The Bears
held Oregon to five yards rushing
and allowed Pacific just six yards
passing this year. Even more im
pressive, Cal kept Ari/.ona State
under 100 yards rushing last Sat
urday.
"It cannot go unnoticed that
they've gotten better and better
and better," Elwav said.
"They're as good a defensive
football team right now as we will
have faced this year."
Inside linebacker David "The
Shark" Ortega leads the team
with 104 tackles and five inter
ceptions. Outside linebacker Ken
Harvey, who had three sacks
against Stanford last year, has 79
stops, as does inside linebacker
Steve Hendrickson. Noseguard
Majett Whiteside and tackle
Natu Tuatagaloa have 56 and 55
tackles, respectively.
They'll be facing a nearly
healthy Brad Muster, who
rushed for 159 yards and two
touchdowns in just the first half
against Oregon State a week ago.
Sophomore Brian Johnson is 3-2
as a starting quarterback and


Benjamin Tong/Daily file
Stanford's Brian Johnson needs a day much like the one he had at Oregon State if the Cardinal is to beat a
(■olden Bear team hot off its upset of last year's Rose Bowl champion, Arizona State.
