# Card wears Pac-10 crown
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Well, it's time to get the champagne
out.
The Stanford women's volleyball
team won the Pacific 10 Conference
title last night by sweeping second
place UCLA 15-8, 15-1 I, 16-14 in
Maples Pavilion. With the win, the
Cardinal ran its record to 24-4 this
year, 16-1 in the Pac-10. UCLA is now
27-8, 12-4 in the league.
Stanford finishes Pac-10 play tonight
with an 8 p.m. match against USC (17-
8, 11-4) in Maples. The contest is the
last regularly-scheduled home match
for the team this year and provides the
Cardinal with a shot at a 17-1 league
mark, which would tie the league
record set by UCLA last year.
The Cardinal put together one of its
best matches of the season last night as
junior Amy Hayes and senior Nancy
Reno led the squad in defeating the
fifth-ranked Bruins and gaining a bit of
revenge. The two teams first met in
Los Angeles Sept. 18, a match the
Bruins won rather handily in four
games.
Senior outside hitter Teresa Smith
explained the different result, saying
the two matches were like "night and
day.''
"We were real raw then," she said.
"(Tonight | our enthusiasm was due to
playing UCLA and getting them back
. . . and we're at that part of the season
where we have to go for it."
With the NCAA playoffs begining in
two weeks the Cardinal certainly
picked the right time to peak. Stanford
has won 19 of its last 20 matches and
has already set a record by winning 16
consecutive Pac-10 contests (since the
UCLA loss.)
The Cardinal had serving and pass
ing troubles two months ago, but not
last night. "Serving and passing were

our main focus," Smith said. Last
week's Pac-10 Player of the Week was
a big part of Stanford's success. Smith
has been the Cardinal's most consis
tent passer all season and, despite the
tough serves UCLA threw at her and
her teammates, the Bruins recorded
only four service aces in the match. In
the previous match between the two
schools, UCLA sophomore Daiva
Tomkus alone recorded five aces
against the Cardinal.
In addition to fine passing, the Cardi
nal also served very well, forcing bad
passes and disrupting the Bruin attack.
Smith again was the leader, as her
jump-serve kept UCLA scrambling all
night. Senior setter Wendi Rush occa
sionally used a tonspin serve of her
own to keep the Bruins on their col
lective toes, recording one ace, while
junior Laura Olesen had two aces with
her floater serve.
"I thought they played really well
tonight," Smith said, "(but) they didn't
pass well because of our serving."
Stanford Coach Don Shaw agreed.
"We served them tough enough that
they couldn't get many good passes,"
he said.
The beginning of the match was sym
bolic of the entire night. The first point
of the match was scored when Smith
and Olesen blocked Tomkus. While
Tomkus had those five aces and 15 kills
in the September match, she was held
to only one ace and six kills last night.
She also made six hitting errors, giving
her a .000 hitting percentage for the
night.
The Cardinal jumped out to a quick
10-1 lead behind a balanced offense and
strong blocking. UCLA woke up, and a
few Stanford errors allowed the Bruins
to come to within four, at 12-8, but mo
ments later the game was over on a kill
by Hayes.
Game 2 saw the Bruins grab their
first lead of the match as they went

ahead 5-3, but Stanford came right
back. After Reno and sophomore Lara
Asper stuffed Bruin co-captain Lori
Zeno twice in succession it was 9-6
Stanford.
The Bruins weren't done, though.
They were able to knot the count at 11,
but Olesen then served up another ace.
The Cardinal then watched three free
points come its way as three UCLA
hitting errors ended the game.
This battle for the Pac-10 crown was
expected to involve a lot of drama, and
finally, in the third game, the estimated
crowd of 19(H) was treated to some dra
matic moments. Stanford scored four
fast points, but a sideout and four con
secutive Bruin points deadlocked the
game. The game remained close
throughout, when finally UCLA served
for the game at 14-13.
On the ensuing point, Rush set
Asper, who saved the game with a kill.
A kill by senior Wendy Fletcher gave
UCLA another shot at the game, but
Hayes got a sideout to save the game a
second time.
Hayes then aced senior Stacy Buck
to tie the score at 14, and UCLA got
desperate. Setter Ann Boyer kept
looking to Fletcher, and while she got
one sideout, a Reno kill gave Stanford
the ball again. This time, Fletcher
could not get a sideout, as she sent a
sharply-angled crosscourt shot just
wide.
Reno served match point, and again
Boyer went to Fletcher. Reno was
equal to the task and came up with a
tough dig. The ball was set to Smith,
and as she hit it Tomkus was called for
a net violation, and the Cardinal had
the second Pac-10 women's volleyball
title (UCLA won in the league's in
augural season last year.).
"That was a great feeling," Asper
said.

Seniors Wendi Rush (left) and Nancy Reno helped Stanford defeat L'CLA in three straight
games last night in Maples Pavilion to clinch tne Pac-IO title.
"We're a much more cohesive
group, and it's paying off," Rush
said. "We were behind, and we
came back from the deficit and
hung together."
The Cardinal's thoughts now
turn to USC, tonight's foe. Smith
knows she and her teammates
cannot afford to overlook the
I3th-ranked Trojans. "They'll be
tough," she said. "We have to be
ready for them. We can't have a
letdown."
"We just want to come out and
play with intensity and beat these
guys," Shaw said.
The hero of last night's match
had to be Hayes, as she tallied 11
kills and a .476 hitting percentage
to go along with her match-high
20 digs. "She had a really nice
night all the way around," Shaw
said.
Reno had 17 kills, the night's
high, and five blocks, while
Smith had II kills. Rush re
corded six kills in seven attempts
for an .857 percentage, and had
12 digs. Olesen also had 12 digs
to go with her 10 kills, while
Asper added eight digs and four
blocks.
Fletcher led the Bruin attack

with I I kills, while Buck and
Zeno had 10 each. Defensively,
Boyer led with 13 digs and
Tomkus had II and a team
leading four blocks.
As the new Pac-10 champion,
Stanford gets an automatic hid to
the NCAA playoffs, which will
begin Dec. 3. But that is not the
real prize the team won tonight.
Even if it had not won the confer
ence title, the third-ranked Cardi
nal would have receive a bid to
the 32-team tournament anyway
as an at-large team.
Winning the Pac-10 gives the
team an advantage in seeding. In
addition to the N0.3 Cardinal,
the West Region contains No. 4
Brigham Young, No. 5 UCLA,
No. 6 Colorado State, as well as
four other top-20 teams. Eight
teams will qualify for the
playoffs, and the Cardinal is
looking not only to host its first
round match on Dec. 3, but also
to host the regional tournament
the following weekend. The de
termination of the host school is
not based on any strict criteria,
but the highest-ranked team in
the region has the inside track.
With a win against USC
tonight and a good showing at
No. I Hawaii next Wednesday
and Friday, Stanford will retain
its No. 3 ranking heading into the
tournament.
