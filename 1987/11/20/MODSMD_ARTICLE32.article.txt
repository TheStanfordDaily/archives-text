# Golden Bears visit de Guerre for Big Splash
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
No offense to the Stanford football program, hut
it can be well-argued that the big game tomorrow
starts at 10:30 a.m., not I p.m.
It's at that early hour, when most students will
be looking to rejuvenate themselves in time for the
Big Game tailgaters, that the No. 3 Stanford water
polo team dives into deGuerre Pool for the Big
Splash against No. I California.
A Cardinal win is of vital importance if the team
wants to bring Stanford its third straight NCAA
water polo title at next weekend's NCAA tourna
ment in Long Beach.
More than just a clash of cross-Bay rivals, the
Big Splash is perenially one of collegiate water
polo's biggest games. Stanford and Cal have
combined to win 12 of the last 14 NCA A champion
ships — six apiece. Should one of the two go on to
win this fall, it will mark the sixth straight season
that either the Cardinal or the Golden Bears have
taken home the national title.
Both Stanford (19-6) and Cal (23-3) are assured a
spot among the eight-team field that will vie for this
fall's title. Tomorrow's game, though, will play a
significant role in determining the Cardinal s
positioning at the tournament next weekend. A win
tor Stanford would mean the Cardinal would head
into the NCAA tourney as the second seed. The
first and second seeds will draw Brown and Navy,
respectively, and are sure to advance to the Final
Four.
The third-seeded team w ill have to play the No. f>
team, which will be a California squad — most
likely Pepperdine. As a result, the No. 3 team will

have three tough tournament matches instead of
just two. The nation's top 10 has consisted solely of
California teams throughout the season, but since it
is the National Collegiate Athletic Association,
two teams from the East are invited to join the pool
party.
"The next four games we have to play great
games/' Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"Every guy is going to have to play at his very best
in order for us to have a chance to win the NCAAs.
Getting the No. 2 seed gives you a great chance to
win the NCAAs. Getting the No. 3 seed makes it
more difficult. Really, vou're halfway to winning
the NCAAs by getting the No. 2 seed.'
Meanwhile, the Bears will definitely enter next
week's championships at No. I, giving them less
incentive than Stanford to win tomorrow's match.
Cal senior Luis Ortiz said the Bears recognize this,
but thinks he and his teammates will overcome the
disadvantage.
"There's nothing else we can achieve until the
NCAAs." Ortiz said, "but Big Game is always im
portant, and I am sure (Cal Head Coach) Cutino
will make sure we play our best."
"They don't have to win the game, and things
arc so close this year that I think that will give us a
little bit of an edge." Dettamanti said. "I don't
know how much Cutino will rest them for this
game. They are probably looking ahead to the
NCAAs."
Although over the years Stanford has been supe
rior to the Bears in their titanic clashes, very recent
history is in favor of California. In the past 12
years, the Cardinal is 31-13-3 against Cal. I'his fall.
