# Golden Bears visit de Guerre for Big Splash
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
No offense to the Stanford football program, hut
it can be well-argued that the big game tomorrow
starts at 10:30 a.m., not I p.m.
It's at that early hour, when most students will
be looking to rejuvenate themselves in time for the
Big Game tailgaters, that the No. 3 Stanford water
polo team dives into deGuerre Pool for the Big
Splash against No. I California.
A Cardinal win is of vital importance if the team
wants to bring Stanford its third straight NCAA
water polo title at next weekend's NCAA tourna
ment in Long Beach.
More than just a clash of cross-Bay rivals, the
Big Splash is perenially one of collegiate water
polo's biggest games. Stanford and Cal have
combined to win 12 of the last 14 NCA A champion
ships — six apiece. Should one of the two go on to
win this fall, it will mark the sixth straight season
that either the Cardinal or the Golden Bears have
taken home the national title.
Both Stanford (19-6) and Cal (23-3) are assured a
spot among the eight-team field that will vie for this
fall's title. Tomorrow's game, though, will play a
significant role in determining the Cardinal s
positioning at the tournament next weekend. A win
tor Stanford would mean the Cardinal would head
into the NCAA tourney as the second seed. The
first and second seeds will draw Brown and Navy,
respectively, and are sure to advance to the Final
Four.
The third-seeded team w ill have to play the No. f>
team, which will be a California squad — most
likely Pepperdine. As a result, the No. 3 team will

have three tough tournament matches instead of
just two. The nation's top 10 has consisted solely of
California teams throughout the season, but since it
is the National Collegiate Athletic Association,
two teams from the East are invited to join the pool
party.
"The next four games we have to play great
games/' Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"Every guy is going to have to play at his very best
in order for us to have a chance to win the NCAAs.
Getting the No. 2 seed gives you a great chance to
win the NCAAs. Getting the No. 3 seed makes it
more difficult. Really, vou're halfway to winning
the NCAAs by getting the No. 2 seed.'
Meanwhile, the Bears will definitely enter next
week's championships at No. I, giving them less
incentive than Stanford to win tomorrow's match.
Cal senior Luis Ortiz said the Bears recognize this,
but thinks he and his teammates will overcome the
disadvantage.
"There's nothing else we can achieve until the
NCAAs." Ortiz said, "but Big Game is always im
portant, and I am sure (Cal Head Coach) Cutino
will make sure we play our best."
"They don't have to win the game, and things
arc so close this year that I think that will give us a
little bit of an edge." Dettamanti said. "I don't
know how much Cutino will rest them for this
game. They are probably looking ahead to the
NCAAs."
Although over the years Stanford has been supe
rior to the Bears in their titanic clashes, very recent
history is in favor of California. In the past 12
years, the Cardinal is 31-13-3 against Cal. I'his fall.

Grant Stanley and the Stanford nater team badly want a victory in the Big Splash so the> can enter the
NCAA Championships as the No. 2 seed.
however, the Bears have won
two of the teams' three matches.
The 1987 Bears have everybody
back from last season's NCAA
runner-up team and have clearly
outdone the rest of the nation's
elite so far.
"Talent, experience, depth,
speed, size — they've got every
thing," Dettamanti said. "They
have a good goalie. They've got
everything going for them.
They're really a solid team, and
they have a lot of bodies. They
can play 14 guys out there, and
they wear other teams down."
The only place Dettamanti
feels Cal is a little weak (i.e., not
superior to most other teams) is

at the two-meter positon, water
poio's focal point. This is where
Stanford excels, with senior
Erich Fischer, who is arguably
the nation's top collegiate player.
Fischer has 55 goals this
season. Senior Grant Stanley's
26 tallies put him in the team's
No. 2 scoring slot, just ahead of
junior Jeff Oeding, senior Matt
Tingler and junior Andrew Law
son.
You would expect that anyone
who has played four years with
one of the nation's two dominant
water polo programs would be
rising to the occasion as his final
season winds down. And indeed,
this has been the case for the '87
Cardinal.
Besides Fischer, Stanley and
Tingler have really turned it on
lately. Tingler is the team's pool
general and its finest passer.

Stanley has dramatically im
proved his scoring total recently,
tallying three hat tricks in the last
seven games.
"The seniors would like to go
out in style. 1 don't think there's
going to be any problem getting
really excited," Stanley said. "I
think we are more satisfied with
our play recently. The team feels
it's at its peak going into these
last games."
Defensively, the main man is
also a senior, goalkeeper Obi
Greenman. He will be making his
saves in tomorrow's game behind
a slightly different defense from
the one the Cardinal has been
employing most of the season.
Because Cal's hole men are weak
relative to the excellence of the
rest of the Bear team, Stanford's
defense will be keying more on
pressuring the wing players and

stifling their movement.
In the most recent Stanford-
Cal matchup, a Bear victory at
Berkeley Oct. 9, it was Cal's
relentless motion on offense that
gave the Bears their scoring op
portunities.
Stanford, as well, got a good
number of scoring opportunities
in that match, but was able to
score only three times to Cal's
seven. Throughout the middle
part of the season the Cardinal
showed an inexplicable inability
to score, despite maintaining a
fairly high number of shots per
game. This problem seems to
have been erased, however,
based on the team's most recent
games, against UCLA and USC.
Stanley pointed to concentration
as the facet of the Cardinal game
upon which the outcome of the
Big Splash hinges.

"The seniors would like to go
out in style. 1 don't think there's
going to be any problem getting
really excited," Stanley said. "I
think we are more satisfied with
our play recently. The team feels
it's at its peak going into these
last games."
Defensively, the main man is
also a senior, goalkeeper Obi
Greenman. He will be making his
saves in tomorrow's game behind
a slightly different defense from
the one the Cardinal has been
employing most of the season.
Because Cal's hole men are weak
relative to the excellence of the
rest of the Bear team, Stanford's
defense will be keying more on
pressuring the wing players and

stifling their movement.
In the most recent Stanford-
Cal matchup, a Bear victory at
Berkeley Oct. 9, it was Cal's
relentless motion on offense that
gave the Bears their scoring op
portunities.
Stanford, as well, got a good
number of scoring opportunities
in that match, but was able to
score only three times to Cal's
seven. Throughout the middle
part of the season the Cardinal
showed an inexplicable inability
to score, despite maintaining a
fairly high number of shots per
game. This problem seems to
have been erased, however,
based on the team's most recent
games, against UCLA and USC.
Stanley pointed to concentration
as the facet of the Cardinal game
upon which the outcome of the
Big Splash hinges.
No offense to the Stanford football program, hut
it can be well-argued that the big game tomorrow
starts at 10:30 a.m., not I p.m.
It's at that early hour, when most students will
be looking to rejuvenate themselves in time for the
Big Game tailgaters, that the No. 3 Stanford water
polo team dives into deGuerre Pool for the Big
Splash against No. I California.
A Cardinal win is of vital importance if the team
wants to bring Stanford its third straight NCAA
water polo title at next weekend's NCAA tourna
ment in Long Beach.
More than just a clash of cross-Bay rivals, the
Big Splash is perenially one of collegiate water
polo's biggest games. Stanford and Cal have
combined to win 12 of the last 14 NCA A champion
ships — six apiece. Should one of the two go on to
win this fall, it will mark the sixth straight season
that either the Cardinal or the Golden Bears have
taken home the national title.
Both Stanford (19-6) and Cal (23-3) are assured a
spot among the eight-team field that will vie for this
fall's title. Tomorrow's game, though, will play a
significant role in determining the Cardinal s
positioning at the tournament next weekend. A win
tor Stanford would mean the Cardinal would head
into the NCAA tourney as the second seed. The
first and second seeds will draw Brown and Navy,
respectively, and are sure to advance to the Final
Four.
The third-seeded team w ill have to play the No. f>
team, which will be a California squad — most
likely Pepperdine. As a result, the No. 3 team will

have three tough tournament matches instead of
just two. The nation's top 10 has consisted solely of
California teams throughout the season, but since it
is the National Collegiate Athletic Association,
two teams from the East are invited to join the pool
party.
"The next four games we have to play great
games/' Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"Every guy is going to have to play at his very best
in order for us to have a chance to win the NCAAs.
Getting the No. 2 seed gives you a great chance to
win the NCAAs. Getting the No. 3 seed makes it
more difficult. Really, vou're halfway to winning
the NCAAs by getting the No. 2 seed.'
Meanwhile, the Bears will definitely enter next
week's championships at No. I, giving them less
incentive than Stanford to win tomorrow's match.
Cal senior Luis Ortiz said the Bears recognize this,
but thinks he and his teammates will overcome the
disadvantage.
"There's nothing else we can achieve until the
NCAAs." Ortiz said, "but Big Game is always im
portant, and I am sure (Cal Head Coach) Cutino
will make sure we play our best."
"They don't have to win the game, and things
arc so close this year that I think that will give us a
little bit of an edge." Dettamanti said. "I don't
know how much Cutino will rest them for this
game. They are probably looking ahead to the
NCAAs."
Although over the years Stanford has been supe
rior to the Bears in their titanic clashes, very recent
history is in favor of California. In the past 12
years, the Cardinal is 31-13-3 against Cal. I'his fall.

however, the Bears have won
two of the teams' three matches.
The 1987 Bears have everybody
back from last season's NCAA
runner-up team and have clearly
outdone the rest of the nation's
elite so far.
"Talent, experience, depth,
speed, size — they've got every
thing," Dettamanti said. "They
have a good goalie. They've got
everything going for them.
They're really a solid team, and
they have a lot of bodies. They
can play 14 guys out there, and
they wear other teams down."
The only place Dettamanti
feels Cal is a little weak (i.e., not
superior to most other teams) is

at the two-meter positon, water
poio's focal point. This is where
Stanford excels, with senior
Erich Fischer, who is arguably
the nation's top collegiate player.
Fischer has 55 goals this
season. Senior Grant Stanley's
26 tallies put him in the team's
No. 2 scoring slot, just ahead of
junior Jeff Oeding, senior Matt
Tingler and junior Andrew Law
son.
You would expect that anyone
who has played four years with
one of the nation's two dominant
water polo programs would be
rising to the occasion as his final
season winds down. And indeed,
this has been the case for the '87
Cardinal.
Besides Fischer, Stanley and
Tingler have really turned it on
lately. Tingler is the team's pool
general and its finest passer.

Stanley has dramatically im
