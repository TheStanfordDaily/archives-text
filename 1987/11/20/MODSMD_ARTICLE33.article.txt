# Stanford swimmers perform well against Cal
## 
### David Earnest Staff writer 
You could say that Matt Nance, the senior
tri-captain of the Stanford men's swimming
team, had a good meet yesterday, winning
the 800-meter individual medley and placing
second in the 400 backstroke.
You could also say he is in good shape,
racing in an additional two events in yester
day afternoon's "double-distance" meet with
California. Nance's performance highlighted
an all-around solid showing in the season
debut of both the men's and women's swim
ming teams.
Tne meet, held at deGuerre Pool, is the
traditional Big Game week match between
Cal and Stanford. It is the first of four
meetings for the rival teams.
"It's good, to race against someone after
weeks of conditioning," senior tri-captain
Anthony Mosse said. "Up to now we've
been working to get into shape. Now we can
look forward to competition."
The meet was double-distance — each
event was twice the normal distance so that
the swimmers could work on conditioning as
well as competing. The extended length
meant that many of the races were not as fast
but had closer finishes.
Races were held for both men and women

in numerous events. The afternoon's compe
tition began with the 2000-meter freestyle.
Races were then held in the 400 freestyle, 800
individual medley, 400 butterfly, 4(H) back
stroke, 400 breaststroke and the 800 freestyle
relay.

k Matt Nance was awesome
today. He has accepted the
leadership role he is capable of.
That's really important for us
this year/
— Coach Skip Kenney

Among the top performers on the day was
Nance, who raced in three individual events
and swam the second leg of one of Stanford's
four relay teams. Teammate and senior tri
captain Sean Murphy also swam well, win
ning the 400 backstroke in 3:51.47, almost a
full 13 seconds ahead of Nance. Sophomore
John Witchel won the 400 freestyle in
3:34.71.
Solid all-around performances anchored a
successful debut for the women's team as
well. Senior Stacy Shupe and sophomore

Bethanne Lambert highlighted the effort by
the women's team. Shupe beat out Califor
nia's Ann Walker by seven seconds in the 400
butterfly with a time of 4:31.03. Lambert
placed second in the 800 individual medley
and later placed third in the 400 breaststroke.
Men's coach Skip Kenney had mixed reac
tions about yesterday's meet. "Matt Nance
was awesome today. He has accepted the
leadership role he is capable of. That's really
important for us this year," Kenney said. He
also indicated that he was pleased with the
team's freshmen, saying they have a "good
attitude and enthusiasm."
However, Kenney said he was not entirely
satisfied. "We need to improve our mental
attitude. We're physically well-conditioned,
but we need to be mentally tough," he said.
Murphy agreed. "We showed some im
provement, but there are still some areas that
we need to work on." Nonetheless, he said
the meet was a "good beginning" for the
season.
After weeks of conditioning, the men's and
women's teams are looking forward to, in the
words of Mosse, "cranking it up a notch."
The teams will now await the official season
in January.
The men's team faces the nation's top
ranked team, Texas, in an unofficial but for
mal match next month.
