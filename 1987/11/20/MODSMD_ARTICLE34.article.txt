# Stanford hosts Cal in fencing Big Meet
## 
### Mike Shay 
The University of California
is coming to town. So what
else is new. It looks like all of
Cal is moving to Stanford to
morrow.
After the Big Game is the
Big Meet. It comes sometime
after the Big Splash and near
the end of Big Game Week.
Actually, it takes place tomor
row at 4 p.m. at Roble Gym.
The Big Meet is where the
Cardinal fencing team at
tempts to show the Golden
Bear fencing team how to
fence.
Sabre team captain Dave
Russ has been telling his team
one thing all week: "I don't re
member the last time Berkeley
beat us, and we're not going to
[lose 1.' * Russ went 3-0 in his
matches last week against UC-
Santa Cruz.
Last year the men's team
won 15-12 against the Bears at
Big Meet. The women wiped
the floor with Cal, 11-5. Tradi
tionally Stanford has done
well against Berkeley, particu
larly in comparison to how it
has done against the Banana
Slugs.
After last week's meet with
Santa Cruz, the fencing teams
are ready to take on anyone,
especially the Bears. The
women lost to Santa Cruz last
week by only four touches,
and the men's team beat the
Slugs.
With the hardest meet in the
region already over, Stanford
is ready to go the distance with
Cal.
The coaches are confident
in their teams' abilities. "We
have confidence because we
won against Santa Cruz,"
Men's Coach Zoran Tulum
said.
"1 will start with the same
team; they fenced well,"
Tulum added.
Last year the foil team beat

Cal 8-1. This year the foil
group is the weakest link in the
Stanford men's team. It was
the only team to lose to Santa
Cruz.
The men's epee team turned
in a surprisingly good perform
ance against the Slugs. The
sabre team heat Cal 9-0 last
year, and this year's team
looks strong, if last week's win
is any indication.
Tulum confessed to not
knowing that much about the
Berkeley team, but that is to
be expected from a new coach
from the East. In addition, the
Bears are only a club team.
A club team isn't bound as
strictly to NCAA rules as a
varsity team like Stanford, ex
plained Cardinal women's
Coach Sherry Posthumus. A
club team doesn't have to
worry about the age of it's
competitors, how long they
have been competing and
other rules to which Stanford
has to adhere.
"You never know what you
are coming up against," Pos
thumus said. But still she was
confident about the abilities of
her team. Posthumus also said
she will start with roughly the
same lineup she used against
Santa Cruz, but she will give
her new fencers a chance.
"With a team of nine I can
pick and choose," Posthumus
said. Starting will be
Alexandra Rankin, the wo
men's foil captain, Elisabeth
Spillman and four other new
comers to the team's roster.
Posthumus is counting on
Spillman and Rankin to win all
four of their bouts. That would
leave just one more individual
win needed for the overall
team victory.
"All 1 need is one of the
eight, but 1 am expecting much
better," Posthumus said. "If I
put in all experienced fencers,
it would be no problem ''

confident about the abilities of
her team. Posthumus also said
she will start with roughly the
same lineup she used against
Santa Cruz, but she will give
her new fencers a chance.
"With a team of nine I can
pick and choose," Posthumus
said. Starting will be
Alexandra Rankin, the wo
men's foil captain, Elisabeth
Spillman and four other new
comers to the team's roster.
Posthumus is counting on
Spillman and Rankin to win all
four of their bouts. That would
leave just one more individual
win needed for the overall
team victory.
"All 1 need is one of the
eight, but 1 am expecting much
better," Posthumus said. "If I
put in all experienced fencers,
it would be no problem ''
