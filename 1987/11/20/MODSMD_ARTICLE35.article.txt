# UC-Davis visits Card wrestlers

Picture, if you will, the 1987-88
Stanford wrestling team: one
senior, no juniors and eight fresh
men and sophomores competing
in a sport where experience is ar
guably the athlete's greatest as
set; six points forfeited each
meet due to the lack of a 118-
fiound wrestler; and a record
rom last season that placed the
Cardinal at the bottom of its con
ference.
Now, disregard any notions
that the above may have created,
and envision this year's grap
plers, three of whom entertain
All-America hopes, and all of
whom are hopeful that the Cardi
nal can improve on last year's
performance.
"They are young, but they are
learning fast," Stanford Coach
Chris Horpel said. "A lot
depends on how quickly the
freshmen improve during the
course of the season."
Horpel looks to today's 4:30
p.m. match against UC-Davis
with much optimism. Having
defeated the Aggies 37-12 last
season, another victory this af
ternoon at Maples Pavilion

seems imminent. "I think we
have a good chance of beating
them again," Horpel said.
In order to maintain the Big
Game spirit UC-Davis is sched
uled each year on Big Game
weekend. Since Davis is the only
school in the UC system to sup
port a wrestling team, the Aggies
fill in for the "Big Match."
With today's match marking
the Cardinal's home-opener,
here is a weight-by-weight break
down of the Stanford team:
118 pounds: Again this season
the Cardinal will have to forfeit
this lowest weight class. Fresh
man Matt Paradise, at 105
pounds, is growing quickly, but
Horpel wants to wait until he
gains both size and experience
before Paradise enters the varsity
ranks.
126 pounds: Freshman Loren
Vigil, who boasts second-, third
and fifth-place finishes in the
New Mexico state champion
ships, will compete in this
bracket. Joe Reilly, another
freshman, will back up Vigil.
Reilly placed first and second in
