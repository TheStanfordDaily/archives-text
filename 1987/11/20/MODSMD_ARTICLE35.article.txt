# UC-Davis visits Card wrestlers
## 
### Gordon S. Stephenson 
Picture, if you will, the 1987-88
Stanford wrestling team: one
senior, no juniors and eight fresh
men and sophomores competing
in a sport where experience is ar
guably the athlete's greatest as
set; six points forfeited each
meet due to the lack of a 118-
fiound wrestler; and a record
rom last season that placed the
Cardinal at the bottom of its con
ference.
Now, disregard any notions
that the above may have created,
and envision this year's grap
plers, three of whom entertain
All-America hopes, and all of
whom are hopeful that the Cardi
nal can improve on last year's
performance.
"They are young, but they are
learning fast," Stanford Coach
Chris Horpel said. "A lot
depends on how quickly the
freshmen improve during the
course of the season."
Horpel looks to today's 4:30
p.m. match against UC-Davis
with much optimism. Having
defeated the Aggies 37-12 last
season, another victory this af
ternoon at Maples Pavilion

seems imminent. "I think we
have a good chance of beating
them again," Horpel said.
In order to maintain the Big
Game spirit UC-Davis is sched
uled each year on Big Game
weekend. Since Davis is the only
school in the UC system to sup
port a wrestling team, the Aggies
fill in for the "Big Match."
With today's match marking
the Cardinal's home-opener,
here is a weight-by-weight break
down of the Stanford team:
118 pounds: Again this season
the Cardinal will have to forfeit
this lowest weight class. Fresh
man Matt Paradise, at 105
pounds, is growing quickly, but
Horpel wants to wait until he
gains both size and experience
before Paradise enters the varsity
ranks.
126 pounds: Freshman Loren
Vigil, who boasts second-, third
and fifth-place finishes in the
New Mexico state champion
ships, will compete in this
bracket. Joe Reilly, another
freshman, will back up Vigil.
Reilly placed first and second in

the national prep school cham
pionships.
134 pounds: Josh I.isle, a re
turning letterman who has three
years of eligibility remaining, will
provide strength for the Cardi
nal's lower weights.
142 pounds: Freshman James
Dinette of Oregon will attempt to
fill the spot vacated by All -
American Scott Wiggen. who
graduated last year. Freshman
Dary Mozaffarian, from Mercer
Island, Wash., will try to chal
lenge Dinette for the varsity posi
tion.
150 pounds: A series of heated
challenge matches has pitted re
turning sophomore letterman

Geoff Baum against freshman
Jerome Farmer from Michigan.
Farmer won his first collegiate
match last week at San Jose State
only to have his spot taken away
by Baum during this week's chal
lenge matches.
158 pounds: Sophomore Steve
Yarbrough, who finished last
season only one match away
from the NCAA tournament, will
provide solid competition.
Yarbrough, from New Mexico, is
coming off a minor knee injury
that kept him out of competition
last week. Freshman Jeremy
Newman, who filled in for
Yarbrough last week, will pro
vide support in this bracket.
167 pounds: Senior tri-captain
and two-year letterman Eric Har
ber was defeated in challenge
matches this week by freshman
Steve Buddy. Buddy, who
placed second and fourth in the

Ohio state championships, will
continue to be pushed as Harber
tries to regain his position.
177 pounds: Ron Perry, a
sophomore returning letterman
who narrowly missed qualifying
for the NCAA tournament last
year, will be the man to beat in
this bracket.
190 pounds: Senior tri-captain
Terry Mclntyre will anchor the
team from this bracket. Mc
lntyre, who recorded a pin last
week at San Jose State, hopes for
a return engagement at the
NCAA tournament this season.
Heavyweight: Competing in a
bracket that allows wrestlers to
weigh up to 275 pounds, sopho
more Trent Smith, who comes in
at 2(X) (dripping wet), will try to
hold his own in this class. Smith
was victorious last week against
a 259-pound competitor.
