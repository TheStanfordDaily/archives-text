# Kennedy goes Greek for Big Game week
## 
### 
Last year, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, as he
keeps reminding us, humiliated
the entire sports stafT by better
ing us all in the Greek competi
tion one week, going 7-3.
Gosh, no wonder he's the pres
ident of a major university, with
such uncanny intuition.
We invited Kennedy back this
year, despite the fact that he
thrashed the regular Greeks last
year. He proved to be a true con
servative, selecting only one up
set (Clemson) in his 10 picks.
Kennedy did predict that both
his current university and his
alma mater. Harvard, would win
their Big Games. "Harvard-Yale
is going to be an interesting game
this year," Kennedy said. "At
the beginning of the year Har
vard was much better, but Yale
has improved a lot. Harvard has
more good athletes on defense,
though."
Kennedy is a bit concerned
about cross-Bay rival California,
however. "I'm really worried
about Big Game," he said. "Cal

has found a defense, and they're
a good, solid club. They should
have lost something on offense
without (quarterback) Troy
Taylor, but Stanford is going to
need to perform well on offense
to win. "
Kennedy picked No. I Ne
braska to beat No. 2 Oklahoma,
but said, "I think the winner of
the Big Eight should automati
cally go to jail instead of the Or
ange Bowl."
In the Daily ranks, sports
editor Matthew Bodman remains
on top after going 7-3 last week.
Cardinal Today Editor Chris
Crader is still in second, but
dropped a notch to two games
out.
Crader's Cardinal Today
partner Evan Tuchinsky and last
week's Guest Greek, former
Dean of Admissions Fred Har
gadon, deserve special note for
going 8-2 and moving into a tie
for third. Tuchinsky shocked
everyone by correctly picking
Cal's upset over Arizona State.

Last year, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, as he
keeps reminding us, humiliated
the entire sports stafT by better
ing us all in the Greek competi
tion one week, going 7-3.
Gosh, no wonder he's the pres
ident of a major university, with
such uncanny intuition.
We invited Kennedy back this
year, despite the fact that he
thrashed the regular Greeks last
year. He proved to be a true con
servative, selecting only one up
set (Clemson) in his 10 picks.
Kennedy did predict that both
his current university and his
alma mater. Harvard, would win
their Big Games. "Harvard-Yale
is going to be an interesting game
this year," Kennedy said. "At
the beginning of the year Har
vard was much better, but Yale
has improved a lot. Harvard has
more good athletes on defense,
though."
Kennedy is a bit concerned
about cross-Bay rival California,
however. "I'm really worried
about Big Game," he said. "Cal

has found a defense, and they're
a good, solid club. They should
have lost something on offense
without (quarterback) Troy
Taylor, but Stanford is going to
need to perform well on offense
to win. "
Kennedy picked No. I Ne
braska to beat No. 2 Oklahoma,
but said, "I think the winner of
the Big Eight should automati
cally go to jail instead of the Or
ange Bowl."
In the Daily ranks, sports
editor Matthew Bodman remains
on top after going 7-3 last week.
Cardinal Today Editor Chris
Crader is still in second, but
dropped a notch to two games
out.
Crader's Cardinal Today
partner Evan Tuchinsky and last
week's Guest Greek, former
Dean of Admissions Fred Har
gadon, deserve special note for
going 8-2 and moving into a tie
for third. Tuchinsky shocked
everyone by correctly picking
Cal's upset over Arizona State.
