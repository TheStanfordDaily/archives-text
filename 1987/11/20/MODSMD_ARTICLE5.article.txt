# Preliminary election results
## ASSU capital fees narrowly defeated 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
Only a handful of votes
defeated a constitutional amend
ment that would have allowed
the ASSU to collect capital fees
from the student body, according
to Elections Commissioner Steve
Baer. who yesterday received
preliminary results of the fall
quarter general election.
Proposed by Council of Presi
dents member Leonard Adler,
the failed amendment aimed to
provide funds for large projects
— such as renovating the Boat
house or rebuilding the Old
Firehouse — by allowing the
ASSU to collect a $1 or $2 re
fundable fee from students over a
number of years.
Similar amendments in support
of capital fees have failed in stu
dent elections over the past two
years.
Baer said students overwhelm
ingly approved another constitu
tional amendment, authored by
COP member Jim Durkin, that
will allow the ASSU greater
flexibility in scheduling elec
tions.
Because of the amendment,
students will now be able to
avoid conflicts between voting in
the spring election and observing
Easter and Passover.
Adler and Durkin were un
available for comment.
In addition, the election may
have filled all 13 vacant Graduate
Senate seats, said Baer. "Every
one who ran should basically
win," he said.
Although only nine graduate
students declared candidacy.

Baer predicted that students cast
enough write-in votes to fill the
vacant seats.
"We just have to verify the
write-ins as actual students,"
said Baer.
David Kang, a senatorial can
didate from the School of
Humanities and Sciences, said he
"would like to change some of
the perceptions of the senate."
Graduate senators have been
"divorced from the people that
they're supposed to be represent
ing,'" Kang said.
The preliminary statistics also
showed senior Valerie Huang and
juniors Cindy Wurtenberg and
Laurence Gordon as "clear
front-runners" in the contest to
fill three vacant seats on the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Coun
cil (SCLC), according to Baer.
The SCLC meets quarterly to
review policy changes relating to
the Honor Code.
Gordon said he was pleased
with the election results. "1 look
at it as a good chance for me to
get involved in Stanford," he
said. "1 like decisions involving
ethics and legal questions."
The election featured stan
dardized ballots that were
counted by semi-automatic
voting machines. Five hours
after giving the ballots to Santa
Clara County Assistant Registrar
of Voters John Molchan, Baer
received "numbers (that) were
pretty finalized."
According to Baer. Molchan
will process the ballots again and
send him ";t letter of verifica
tion" guaranteeing accuracy
before the results are officially
posted Monday afternoon.
