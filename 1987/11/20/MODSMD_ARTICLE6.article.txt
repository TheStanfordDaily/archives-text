# Faulty power transformer cited as cause
## Worst blackout in years strikes Escondido Village 
### Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
Nearly 1500 people in over l(K) Escon
dido Village buildings remain without
electricity today, after the graduate
housing complex was hit last night with
its most extensive blackout in several
years.
Operations and Maintenance was
"swamped with hundreds of calls" last
night, according to shift supervisor
Peggy Flahtery, who said her office
received the first report of a power
outage just before 6 p.m. yesterday.

Electrical power could he restored as
early as today, said Bob Mibach,
facilities manager for graduate student
housing.
University engineers worked through
the night to discover the source of the
blackout, which affected the three oldest
clusters of Escondido Village buildings.
Early this morning, workers deter
mined that the cause of the outage was a
faulty power transformer near Black
welder Hall.
At press time this morning, officials
were making arrangements to replace
the old transformer with one they "just

happened to have on hand," Mibach
said.
Noting the luck of finding the spare
transformer, Mibach said it is possibly
the only one of its kind on the West
Coast. "These are very rare," he said.
"We may be able to press it into ser
vice," he said, adding that the trans
former will have to be "tested and
checked out" before it can be used.
Mibach described the transformer —
which reduces incoming electricity from
about 15.(KM) to 4000 volts and then dis
tributes the power to various other

transformers in the area — as an oil
enclosed capsule about eight feet tall and
six feet in circumference.
Early this morning workers were
looking for equipment to lift the old
transformer over the 12-foot cement wall
that surrounds it and put the spare into
place.
The buildings affected in the blackout
have no backup heating source, but resi
dents contacted yesterday seemed gen
erally unconcerned despite expectations
that temperatures would drop into the
low 40s.

Emergency lights were activated in
the five eight-story high-rises that are a
mong the buildings without power, hut
elevators there are out of service,
Mi bach said.
The high-rises affected are Abrams,
Barnes, Hoskins, Hulme and McFarland
halls. Escondido s two 12-story build
ings. Blackwelder and Quillen halls, ex
perienced no power outage.
Fscondido Village buildings I through
115 were struck by the power outage,
but all other campus residences were un
affected.
