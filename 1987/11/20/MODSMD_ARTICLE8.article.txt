Bloody protests plague Bangladesh
DHAKA, Bangladesh — As the bloodiest civilian rioting in
Bangladesh's 16-year history settled down yesterday. President
Hussain Ershad appeared to have ridden out yet another of the
political storms that have plagued his six-year rule of the
world's most densely populated and impoverished nation.
But the crisis for the 57-year-old retired army general is far
from over, with the opposition calling a 48 hour general strike
and public rallies tomorrow and Sunday in a further bid to
topple the army-backed government.
Eighteen people have died and more than 1000 others have
been injured in clashes with security forces in Dhaka and other
major cities during strikes that began Nov. 10, forcing banks,
business houses, post offices and public transport to shut down.
Government ministers and senior officials slept in their offices
last week as angry mobs took over the streets torching build
ings, hurling hand bombs and smashing transport.
The unrest quickly spread across the country as Ershad
blocked all road, rail and river transport to the city to pre-empt
an opposition program of "Dhaka siege" Nov. 10 by tens of
thousands of opposition supporters from the countryside.
Protests erupted last week as the main opposition parties, the
eight- and seven-party alliances, objected to tne army's
strengthening grip on the fledgling democracy.
Crash investigators probe engines
DENVER — Investigators probing the wreckage of the Con
tinental Airlines jet that crashed Sunday in a snowstorm here
focused on the jet's engines yesterday, looking for evidence that
could indicate the plane had ice on its wings.
Engine sounds heard on the cockpit voice recorder were de
scribed by a source close to the investigation as being similar to
an engine compressor stall, which could be caused by a disrup
tion of air flow over the wings. In a compressor stall, the engines
continue running, but not smoothly, and the engine blades could
be damaged if the stall continues.
The sounds were described as sharp thumps, similar to the
sound of a car backfiring, and they occurred after the jet lifted
off the runway, but before the plane began to tip to the side.
The plane crashed a few seconds after taking off from Den
ver's Stapleton International Airport and broke up between par
allel runways. Twenty-eight of the 82 on board, including the
captain, co-pilot and a senior flight attendant, were killed.
Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
also are looking for signs of soot on the interior of the engines,
which could indicate there was a compressor stall. If there was
ice on the wings, the air flowing over them would be distorted,
changing the plane's ability to lift and requiring greater speed to
get off the ground.
Senate approves defense budget
WASHINGTON — The Senate, on an 86-9 vote, gave final
congressional approval yesterday to a $296 billion compromise
defense spending package and sent the measure to President
Reagan despite objections to key arms control provisions.
The House voted 264-158 Wednesday night to approve the
measure, which covers Pentagon spending for the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1 and represents a $16 billion reduction from the
amount Reagan requested. The bill makes substantial cuts in
several major programs, including the Strategic Defense Initia
tive, the MX missile and the B-IB bomber.
"This chamber was in gridlock with the House and with itself
on some issues," said Virginia Sen. John Warner, ranking Re
publican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a mem
ber of the House-Senate conference committee that wrote the
final bill. "It faced certain veto because of some of the arms
control language. Given those constraints and given those
realities, we did our best."
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Armed Services
Committee and the conference panel, said: "No doubt some of
these provisions will not be popular in the White House. I hope
and expect the president will sign this bill, but we have no
guarantees."
Banker talks at Deaver lobby trial
WASHINGTON — A San Francisco investment banker tes
tified yesterday that three months after Michael Deaver left his
post at the White House, the banker was able to reach Deaver
by calling a special White House number and asking for
"Foxtrot," the Secret Service code name for first lady Nancy
Reagan.
William Timbers, a vice president of the Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co. investment firm, said that a White House opera
tor connected him to Deaver on a government airplane in Au
gust 1985, at a time when Deaver was lobbying for the firm un
der a $200,000 contract.
A later witness testified that Deaver and his wife, Carolyn,
were on a weekend trip with Mrs. Reagan to Boston and
Martha's Vineyard at that time.
Timbers' testimony came as Deaver's perjury trial resumed
after a week's recess during which Deaver underwent surgery
for removal of a kidney stone. The appearance of the banker,
who was a prosecution witness, seemed designed to lay the
groundwork for additional testimony today that Deaver perjured
himself in denying that he had contacted high government offi
cials on behalf of the Smith Barney firm.
Timbers said that Smith Barney hired Deaver to lobby admin
istration officials to try to preserve a U.S. tax break for Ameri
can companies that had investments in Puerto Rico. Former Na
tional Security Adviser Robert McFarlane testified earlier this
month that Deaver contacted him about the matter, despite
Deaver's sworn statements to federal investigators that he could
not recall such a contact.
Laxalt pushes breaks for wealthy
WASHINGTON — Former Sen. Paul Laxalt is lobbying the
Treasury Department to allow wealthy individuals who have in
vested in questionable tax shelters to escape sizable interest and
penalty charges in return for paying the back taxes the IRS says
they owe.
The lobbying effort, described as a way to reduce the federal
deficit, would save billions of dollars for hundreds of thousands
of investors who obtained improper tax write-offs through the
shelters, according to the IRS. Law firms representing some of
those investors hired Laxalt's law firm to push the proposal.
The terms Laxalt is seeking would be far more generous than
those normally offered by the IRS, which is adamantly opposed
to the proposal. Many investors presumably would take advan
tage of the offer, paying the back taxes rather than waging
protracted battles against the IRS.
As a result, supporters estimate, federal tax receipts would
rise by as much as $8.6 billion in 1988 and $1.2 billion in 1989.
But the proposal would reduce revenues in subsequent years, in
part because the Treasury would not be collecting interest and
penalties on the contested tax claims.

Bloody protests plague Bangladesh
DHAKA, Bangladesh — As the bloodiest civilian rioting in
Bangladesh's 16-year history settled down yesterday. President
Hussain Ershad appeared to have ridden out yet another of the
political storms that have plagued his six-year rule of the
world's most densely populated and impoverished nation.
But the crisis for the 57-year-old retired army general is far
from over, with the opposition calling a 48 hour general strike
and public rallies tomorrow and Sunday in a further bid to
topple the army-backed government.
Eighteen people have died and more than 1000 others have
been injured in clashes with security forces in Dhaka and other
major cities during strikes that began Nov. 10, forcing banks,
business houses, post offices and public transport to shut down.
Government ministers and senior officials slept in their offices
last week as angry mobs took over the streets torching build
ings, hurling hand bombs and smashing transport.
The unrest quickly spread across the country as Ershad
blocked all road, rail and river transport to the city to pre-empt
an opposition program of "Dhaka siege" Nov. 10 by tens of
thousands of opposition supporters from the countryside.
Protests erupted last week as the main opposition parties, the
eight- and seven-party alliances, objected to tne army's
strengthening grip on the fledgling democracy.
Crash investigators probe engines
DENVER — Investigators probing the wreckage of the Con
tinental Airlines jet that crashed Sunday in a snowstorm here
focused on the jet's engines yesterday, looking for evidence that
could indicate the plane had ice on its wings.
Engine sounds heard on the cockpit voice recorder were de
scribed by a source close to the investigation as being similar to
an engine compressor stall, which could be caused by a disrup
tion of air flow over the wings. In a compressor stall, the engines
continue running, but not smoothly, and the engine blades could
be damaged if the stall continues.
The sounds were described as sharp thumps, similar to the
sound of a car backfiring, and they occurred after the jet lifted
off the runway, but before the plane began to tip to the side.
The plane crashed a few seconds after taking off from Den
ver's Stapleton International Airport and broke up between par
allel runways. Twenty-eight of the 82 on board, including the
captain, co-pilot and a senior flight attendant, were killed.
Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
also are looking for signs of soot on the interior of the engines,
which could indicate there was a compressor stall. If there was
ice on the wings, the air flowing over them would be distorted,
changing the plane's ability to lift and requiring greater speed to
get off the ground.
Senate approves defense budget
WASHINGTON — The Senate, on an 86-9 vote, gave final
congressional approval yesterday to a $296 billion compromise
defense spending package and sent the measure to President
Reagan despite objections to key arms control provisions.
The House voted 264-158 Wednesday night to approve the
measure, which covers Pentagon spending for the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1 and represents a $16 billion reduction from the
amount Reagan requested. The bill makes substantial cuts in
several major programs, including the Strategic Defense Initia
tive, the MX missile and the B-IB bomber.
"This chamber was in gridlock with the House and with itself
on some issues," said Virginia Sen. John Warner, ranking Re
publican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a mem
ber of the House-Senate conference committee that wrote the
final bill. "It faced certain veto because of some of the arms
control language. Given those constraints and given those
realities, we did our best."
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Armed Services
Committee and the conference panel, said: "No doubt some of
these provisions will not be popular in the White House. I hope
and expect the president will sign this bill, but we have no
guarantees."
Banker talks at Deaver lobby trial
WASHINGTON — A San Francisco investment banker tes
tified yesterday that three months after Michael Deaver left his
post at the White House, the banker was able to reach Deaver
by calling a special White House number and asking for
"Foxtrot," the Secret Service code name for first lady Nancy
Reagan.
William Timbers, a vice president of the Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co. investment firm, said that a White House opera
tor connected him to Deaver on a government airplane in Au
gust 1985, at a time when Deaver was lobbying for the firm un
der a $200,000 contract.
A later witness testified that Deaver and his wife, Carolyn,
were on a weekend trip with Mrs. Reagan to Boston and
Martha's Vineyard at that time.
Timbers' testimony came as Deaver's perjury trial resumed
after a week's recess during which Deaver underwent surgery
for removal of a kidney stone. The appearance of the banker,
who was a prosecution witness, seemed designed to lay the
groundwork for additional testimony today that Deaver perjured
himself in denying that he had contacted high government offi
cials on behalf of the Smith Barney firm.
Timbers said that Smith Barney hired Deaver to lobby admin
istration officials to try to preserve a U.S. tax break for Ameri
can companies that had investments in Puerto Rico. Former Na
tional Security Adviser Robert McFarlane testified earlier this
month that Deaver contacted him about the matter, despite
Deaver's sworn statements to federal investigators that he could
not recall such a contact.
Laxalt pushes breaks for wealthy
WASHINGTON — Former Sen. Paul Laxalt is lobbying the
Treasury Department to allow wealthy individuals who have in
vested in questionable tax shelters to escape sizable interest and
penalty charges in return for paying the back taxes the IRS says
they owe.
The lobbying effort, described as a way to reduce the federal
deficit, would save billions of dollars for hundreds of thousands
of investors who obtained improper tax write-offs through the
shelters, according to the IRS. Law firms representing some of
those investors hired Laxalt's law firm to push the proposal.
The terms Laxalt is seeking would be far more generous than
those normally offered by the IRS, which is adamantly opposed
to the proposal. Many investors presumably would take advan
tage of the offer, paying the back taxes rather than waging
protracted battles against the IRS.
As a result, supporters estimate, federal tax receipts would
rise by as much as $8.6 billion in 1988 and $1.2 billion in 1989.
But the proposal would reduce revenues in subsequent years, in
part because the Treasury would not be collecting interest and
