## Deficit nears deadline for cuts 
### 
WASHINGTON — White
House officials said last night
that $23 billion in automatic,
across-the-board spending cuts
will begin taking effect at mid
night today, even as they
struggled to complete an agree
ment with congressional leaders
that would trim the anticipated
budget deficit by $30 billion.
Even if an agreement is
reached today, as some
negotiators predict, growing Re
publican opposition to its general
shape in the Senate and the
House cast doubt on its chances
of passing both bodies.
But other lawmakers predicted
that once their colleagues fully
considered the alternative of

deep, automatic cuts, they would
view the plan in a more favorable
light. "When they (negotiators)
agree, people are going to have to
vote for it," predicted Rep. Jim
Slattery (D-Kan.).
White House chief of staff
Howard Baker Jr. said that Presi
dent Reagan is opposed to any
delay in the across-the-board
cuts mandated by the revised
balanced budget law, even if the
high-level budget talks produce
an accord by today.
The plan under discussion is a
mix of military and domestic
spending cuts, higher taxes and a
one-time saving achieved by
refinancing rural electric loans.
"I do what the president says.

and he says he won t go along
with postponing the sequester,"
said Baker, using the technical
term for the automatic spending
reductions required by the law.
The president's opposition to
any delay, which came after
overwhelming numbers of law
makers said they were opposed
to a postponement that had been
planned r»y Democratic leaders,
means that the first effects of the
automatic cuts will begin taking
place by midnight tonight. Under
the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
balanced budget law, the presi
dent must sign an order by
tonight implementing the $23 bil
lion in spending cuts if he and
Congress have not agreed on al

ternate means of reducing the
deficit.
At first, however, the reduc
tions would have only minimal
impact, because most of them
would not take hold until
Congress passes full-year appro
priations legislation for the fiscal
year that began last month. Ap
proval of the full-year appropria
tions is expected next month.
The automatic cuts became a
certainty at the same time that
negotiators in the high-level
talks, now nearing the end of
their fourth week, said they prob
ably could achieve a tentative
agreement today .
