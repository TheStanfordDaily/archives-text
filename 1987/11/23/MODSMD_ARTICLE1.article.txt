# Card crushes the Bears, 31-7
## Sports 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
Big Game 1987 turned out to
be a complete win for Stanford in
every possible way, and fittingly,
senior running back Brad Muster
was the star of the game as he
closed out his celebrated Stan
ford career.
The Cardinal (which finished
4-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference,
5-6 overall) dominated Satur
day's 31-7 win over California (2-
3-1, 3-6-1) at Stanford Stadium in
all the offensive categories and
finished with 368 yards of total
offense to Cal's 201 yards.
The Stanford defense forced
three Cal turnovers and only
allowed the Bears into Cardinal
territory three times the entire
game. Eight California drives
were stifled before the Bears
could even muster a single first
down.
Special teams, however, may
have been the factor most di
rectly responsible for the Cardi
nal win in the 90th meeting be
tween the two teams. The pun
ting unit consistently gave the
Bears poor field position, and the
punt return team put Stanford in
good field position throughout
the game.
"This was a total victory,"
said Stanford Coach Jack Elway,
who has a 3-1 record in Big
Games. "We won all three
phases of the football game. The

intensity was there all day.
That's what we like to have."
Stanford standout Muster, an
almost guaranteed first-round
National Football League draft
choice, finished with 90 yards
and one touchdown on 22 carries
and caught seven passes for 56
yards in the last game of his Stan
ford career.
"I wanted to thank the fans,"
said Muster, who went over to
the Stanford student section to
greet the crowd after the contest.
"Everyone shows up for Big
Game, and their cheering really
meant a lot to me throughout the
year."
"Brad is a tremendous back,
and I'm thrilled to death for him
and the finish he had today," El
way said. "He's an outstanding,
outstanding running back, and
this is the way I wanted his
career to end."
Despite missing five games this
season with an ankle injury
Muster scored more career rush
ing touchdowns (27) than anyone
else in Cardinal history. The
senior leaves Stanford as the
second all-time leading rusher
(2943 yards on 686 carries) and
receiver (194 receptions for 1669
yards) in school history. He trails
only current Minnesota Viking
running back Darrin Nelson in
both categories.
"Muster's a heck of a great

sought him out after the game to
congratulate him."
Another Stanford senior also
deserved recognition — punter
Doug Robison. Robison, who en
tered the contest as the third
leading punter in the nation be
hind Ohio State's Tom Tupa and
Cal's Scott Tabor, put on a mag
nificent performance under a
heavy rush and averaged 49
yards per kick in a highly
publicized battle with Tabor.
"Tabor was pretty much what
I thought he'd be," Robison said.
"He's a good kicker, and he's
got a good leg. But he could be a
great punter if he wasn't as in
consistent. I'd like to think that I
came out on top."
Not only diu Robison win the
battle with Tabor in Big Game,
he also won the seasonal contest
with his California counterpart.
Tabor averaged just 41 yards per
kick on the day, allowing
Robison to squeeze pass the Cal
senior and claim the conference
punting crown. Robison finished
the season with an average of
45.70 yards per punt, while
Tabor wound up with a 45.67
average.
"What it came down to was
two guys who had never seen
each other — Tabor and
Robison," Stanford linebacker
Kurt Colehower said. "I'd say
that Doug won that battle."
Early on, it was uncertain
which team would win the battle
of Big Game. Stanford took the
opening kickoff and drove to the
Cal 43 — where David Ortega in
tercepted a Brian Johnson pass.
The Bears failed to get a first
down, punted and the Cardinal
then took seven minutes to go
from the Stanford 39 to the Cal
20, where David Sweeney missed
a 36-yard field goal.
The Bears took over and sus
tained a drive of their own all the
way to the Stanford 35, but quar
terback Brad Howe, who started
in place of the injured Troy
Taylor, lofted a pass for the end
zbne intended for Mike Ford.
First Stanford cornerback Kevin
Scott tipped the pass, then Ford
got a hand on it before the ball
fell in the arms of Cardinal free
safety Bruce Richardson.
"Kevin was right on top of the
receiver," Stanford strong safety
Brad Humphreys said. "That
was just the way it was supposed

to work."
The first Cal turnover led to
the first and most dramatic Car
dinal score, as Johnson hit
receiver Walter Batson on a slant
pattern on the left side with just
12 seconds left in the first quar
ter. The freshman turned on the
speed, and it was a foot race to
the end zone with Ortega and de
fensive back Travis Oliver. The
touchdown went for 82 yards, the

longest touchdown pass in Big
Game history.
"That's Walter s record,"
Johnson said. "He can be proud
of it. Walter was able to get up in
the seam, and all I had to do was
get it to him. It was his touch
down; he did all the work."
"I managed to break one
tackle and then I knew I could
take it all the way," Batson said.
"It wasn't easy; 1 was right in the

pack and those guys from Cal can
really run."
The Bears responded by
driving 87 yards for a score on
their next possession. California
running back Chris Richards,
who finished with 89 yards on 19
carries, scored the lone Cal
touchdown on a two-yard dive.
No more would be heard from
the Bear offense, but the Stan
ford crew hadn't even warmed

up. After a Tabor punt went just
29 yards, the Cardinal had field
positon at the 50. Again the of
fense stalled at the Cal 20, but
this time Sweeney booted a 37-
yarder to put Stanford up by
three going into the half.
"After I missed the first one, I
wasn't going to miss anything
else," said Sweeney, who also

the third period.
booted two perfect pooch punts that
twice nailed the Bears within their own
10-yard line. "This is the best way to
go out. This is the only way to go out."
On Stanford's opening possession of
the second half, the Cardinal got down
to the Cal 7, where the offense was
faced with fourth down and two.
Despite the fact that the entire Califor
nia team and all 85,000 people at Stan
ford Stadium knew who would get the
ball, the amazing Muster picked up
three yards on the carry for the first
down.
Three plays later, Johnson took it in
himself from one yard out. "(Center)
Andy Sinclair and the rest of the guys
on the line told me to go left, so I just
followed them," Johnson said. "It was
lucky I did because the defense was
right there.

"Last week they told me to go left
and 1 didn't hear them and went right,"
Johnson added. "It didn't work. So 1
made sure 1 had it this time."
Meanwhile, the Stanford defense
was also putting on an excellent per
formance. In the next California series,
midway through the third quarter, de
fensive tackle Sean Scheller put a
devastating hit on Howe from behind.
Howe fumbled, and the ball was
recovered at the Cal 39 by Stanford
linebacker Kevin Richardson.
"They had a pretty solid and consis
tent drive going," said Scheller, who
finished with a team-high 14 tackles.
"We knew we had to get a big play to
stop their momentum. The guard came
around to cut me off and I jumped over
him and kept running after the quarter
back. He stopped to try to throw, and I
hit him.
"Out of the corner of my eye, I saw
the ball go up, but the hit felt so good 1
just wanted to make sure the quarter
back didn't go after the ball," Scheller

said. "That was one of the best hits of
my career."
The fumble seemed to take away any
life that still remained in the Cal of
fense. The Bears did not manage an
other first down until the second-to-last
play of the game. The Cardinal, how
ever, kept right on rolling, going 38
yards on seven plays to open the fourth
quarter. Muster capped the drive with
a 15-yard touchdown run into the left
side of the end zone.
The final Stanford touchdown came
on a two-yard scoring run by JonVolpe
with 6:06 left to go. The Cardinal cause
was helped by Cal linebacker Ortega,
who finished with an astonishing 24
tackles but kicked a penalty flag after
he was called for a personal foul. The
double penalty moved the ball down to
the Cal 9-yard line.
Cardinal defensive back Chris
Young put the final nail in the Bears'
coffin by picking off a Howe pass at the
Stanford I-yard line with 4:48 left to
deny California another score.

intensity was there all day.
That's what we like to have."
Stanford standout Muster, an
almost guaranteed first-round
National Football League draft
choice, finished with 90 yards
and one touchdown on 22 carries
and caught seven passes for 56
yards in the last game of his Stan
ford career.
"I wanted to thank the fans,"
said Muster, who went over to
the Stanford student section to
greet the crowd after the contest.
"Everyone shows up for Big
Game, and their cheering really
meant a lot to me throughout the
year."
"Brad is a tremendous back,
and I'm thrilled to death for him
and the finish he had today," El
way said. "He's an outstanding,
outstanding running back, and
this is the way I wanted his
career to end."
Despite missing five games this
season with an ankle injury
Muster scored more career rush
ing touchdowns (27) than anyone
else in Cardinal history. The
senior leaves Stanford as the
second all-time leading rusher
(2943 yards on 686 carries) and
receiver (194 receptions for 1669
yards) in school history. He trails
only current Minnesota Viking
running back Darrin Nelson in
both categories.

sought him out after the game to
congratulate him."
Another Stanford senior also
deserved recognition — punter
Doug Robison. Robison, who en
tered the contest as the third
leading punter in the nation be
hind Ohio State's Tom Tupa and
Cal's Scott Tabor, put on a mag
nificent performance under a
heavy rush and averaged 49
yards per kick in a highly
publicized battle with Tabor.
"Tabor was pretty much what
I thought he'd be," Robison said.
"He's a good kicker, and he's
got a good leg. But he could be a
great punter if he wasn't as in
consistent. I'd like to think that I
came out on top."
Not only diu Robison win the
battle with Tabor in Big Game,
he also won the seasonal contest
with his California counterpart.
Tabor averaged just 41 yards per
kick on the day, allowing
Robison to squeeze pass the Cal
senior and claim the conference
punting crown. Robison finished
the season with an average of
45.70 yards per punt, while
Tabor wound up with a 45.67
average.
"What it came down to was
two guys who had never seen
each other — Tabor and
Robison," Stanford linebacker
Kurt Colehower said. "I'd say
that Doug won that battle."
Early on, it was uncertain
which team would win the battle
of Big Game. Stanford took the
opening kickoff and drove to the
Cal 43 — where David Ortega in
tercepted a Brian Johnson pass.
The Bears failed to get a first
down, punted and the Cardinal
then took seven minutes to go
from the Stanford 39 to the Cal
20, where David Sweeney missed
a 36-yard field goal.
The Bears took over and sus
tained a drive of their own all the
way to the Stanford 35, but quar
terback Brad Howe, who started
in place of the injured Troy
Taylor, lofted a pass for the end
zbne intended for Mike Ford.
First Stanford cornerback Kevin
Scott tipped the pass, then Ford
got a hand on it before the ball
fell in the arms of Cardinal free
safety Bruce Richardson.
"Kevin was right on top of the
receiver," Stanford strong safety
Brad Humphreys said. "That
was just the way it was supposed

to work."
The first Cal turnover led to
the first and most dramatic Car
dinal score, as Johnson hit
receiver Walter Batson on a slant
pattern on the left side with just
12 seconds left in the first quar
ter. The freshman turned on the
speed, and it was a foot race to
the end zone with Ortega and de
fensive back Travis Oliver. The
touchdown went for 82 yards, the

longest touchdown pass in Big
Game history.
"That's Walter s record,"
Johnson said. "He can be proud
of it. Walter was able to get up in
the seam, and all I had to do was
get it to him. It was his touch
down; he did all the work."
"I managed to break one
tackle and then I knew I could
take it all the way," Batson said.
"It wasn't easy; 1 was right in the

pack and those guys from Cal can
really run."
The Bears responded by
driving 87 yards for a score on
their next possession. California
running back Chris Richards,
who finished with 89 yards on 19
carries, scored the lone Cal
touchdown on a two-yard dive.
No more would be heard from
the Bear offense, but the Stan
ford crew hadn't even warmed

up. After a Tabor punt went just
29 yards, the Cardinal had field
positon at the 50. Again the of
fense stalled at the Cal 20, but
this time Sweeney booted a 37-
yarder to put Stanford up by
three going into the half.
"After I missed the first one, I
wasn't going to miss anything
else," said Sweeney, who also

booted two perfect pooch punts that
twice nailed the Bears within their own
10-yard line. "This is the best way to
go out. This is the only way to go out."
On Stanford's opening possession of
the second half, the Cardinal got down
to the Cal 7, where the offense was
faced with fourth down and two.
Despite the fact that the entire Califor
nia team and all 85,000 people at Stan
ford Stadium knew who would get the
ball, the amazing Muster picked up
three yards on the carry for the first
down.
Three plays later, Johnson took it in
himself from one yard out. "(Center)
Andy Sinclair and the rest of the guys
on the line told me to go left, so I just
followed them," Johnson said. "It was
lucky I did because the defense was
right there.

"Last week they told me to go left
and 1 didn't hear them and went right,"
Johnson added. "It didn't work. So 1
made sure 1 had it this time."
Meanwhile, the Stanford defense
was also putting on an excellent per
formance. In the next California series,
midway through the third quarter, de
fensive tackle Sean Scheller put a
devastating hit on Howe from behind.
Howe fumbled, and the ball was
recovered at the Cal 39 by Stanford
linebacker Kevin Richardson.
"They had a pretty solid and consis
tent drive going," said Scheller, who
finished with a team-high 14 tackles.
"We knew we had to get a big play to
stop their momentum. The guard came
around to cut me off and I jumped over
him and kept running after the quarter
back. He stopped to try to throw, and I
hit him.
"Out of the corner of my eye, I saw
the ball go up, but the hit felt so good 1
just wanted to make sure the quarter
back didn't go after the ball," Scheller

said. "That was one of the best hits of
my career."
The fumble seemed to take away any
life that still remained in the Cal of
fense. The Bears did not manage an
other first down until the second-to-last
play of the game. The Cardinal, how
ever, kept right on rolling, going 38
yards on seven plays to open the fourth
quarter. Muster capped the drive with
a 15-yard touchdown run into the left
side of the end zone.
The final Stanford touchdown came
on a two-yard scoring run by JonVolpe
with 6:06 left to go. The Cardinal cause
was helped by Cal linebacker Ortega,
who finished with an astonishing 24
tackles but kicked a penalty flag after
he was called for a personal foul. The
double penalty moved the ball down to
the Cal 9-yard line.
Cardinal defensive back Chris
Young put the final nail in the Bears'
coffin by picking off a Howe pass at the
Stanford I-yard line with 4:48 left to
deny California another score.
Big Game 1987 turned out to
be a complete win for Stanford in
every possible way, and fittingly,
senior running back Brad Muster
was the star of the game as he
closed out his celebrated Stan
ford career.
The Cardinal (which finished
4-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference,
5-6 overall) dominated Satur
day's 31-7 win over California (2-
3-1, 3-6-1) at Stanford Stadium in
all the offensive categories and
finished with 368 yards of total
offense to Cal's 201 yards.
The Stanford defense forced
three Cal turnovers and only
allowed the Bears into Cardinal
territory three times the entire
game. Eight California drives
were stifled before the Bears
could even muster a single first
down.
Special teams, however, may
have been the factor most di
rectly responsible for the Cardi
nal win in the 90th meeting be
tween the two teams. The pun
ting unit consistently gave the
Bears poor field position, and the
punt return team put Stanford in
good field position throughout
the game.
"This was a total victory,"
said Stanford Coach Jack Elway,
who has a 3-1 record in Big
Games. "We won all three

sought him out after the game to
congratulate him."
Another Stanford senior also
deserved recognition — punter
Doug Robison. Robison, who en
tered the contest as the third
leading punter in the nation be
hind Ohio State's Tom Tupa and
Cal's Scott Tabor, put on a mag
nificent performance under a
heavy rush and averaged 49
yards per kick in a highly
publicized battle with Tabor.
"Tabor was pretty much what
I thought he'd be," Robison said.
"He's a good kicker, and he's
got a good leg. But he could be a
great punter if he wasn't as in
consistent. I'd like to think that I
came out on top."
Not only diu Robison win the
battle with Tabor in Big Game,
he also won the seasonal contest
with his California counterpart.
Tabor averaged just 41 yards per
kick on the day, allowing
Robison to squeeze pass the Cal
senior and claim the conference
punting crown. Robison finished
the season with an average of
45.70 yards per punt, while
Tabor wound up with a 45.67
average.
"What it came down to was
two guys who had never seen
each other — Tabor and
Robison," Stanford linebacker
Kurt Colehower said. "I'd say
that Doug won that battle."
Early on, it was uncertain
which team would win the battle
of Big Game. Stanford took the
opening kickoff and drove to the
Cal 43 — where David Ortega in
tercepted a Brian Johnson pass.
The Bears failed to get a first
down, punted and the Cardinal
then took seven minutes to go
from the Stanford 39 to the Cal
20, where David Sweeney missed
a 36-yard field goal.
The Bears took over and sus
tained a drive of their own all the
way to the Stanford 35, but quar
terback Brad Howe, who started
in place of the injured Troy
Taylor, lofted a pass for the end
zbne intended for Mike Ford.
First Stanford cornerback Kevin
Scott tipped the pass, then Ford
got a hand on it before the ball
fell in the arms of Cardinal free
safety Bruce Richardson.
"Kevin was right on top of the
receiver," Stanford strong safety
Brad Humphreys said. "That
was just the way it was supposed

to work."
The first Cal turnover led to
the first and most dramatic Car
dinal score, as Johnson hit
receiver Walter Batson on a slant
pattern on the left side with just
12 seconds left in the first quar
ter. The freshman turned on the
speed, and it was a foot race to
the end zone with Ortega and de
fensive back Travis Oliver. The
touchdown went for 82 yards, the

longest touchdown pass in Big
Game history.
"That's Walter s record,"
Johnson said. "He can be proud
of it. Walter was able to get up in
the seam, and all I had to do was
get it to him. It was his touch
down; he did all the work."
"I managed to break one
tackle and then I knew I could
take it all the way," Batson said.
"It wasn't easy; 1 was right in the

pack and those guys from Cal can
really run."
The Bears responded by
driving 87 yards for a score on
their next possession. California
running back Chris Richards,
who finished with 89 yards on 19
carries, scored the lone Cal
touchdown on a two-yard dive.
No more would be heard from
the Bear offense, but the Stan
ford crew hadn't even warmed

up. After a Tabor punt went just
29 yards, the Cardinal had field
positon at the 50. Again the of
fense stalled at the Cal 20, but
this time Sweeney booted a 37-
yarder to put Stanford up by
three going into the half.
"After I missed the first one, I
wasn't going to miss anything
else," said Sweeney, who also


After an injury-plagued season this year, senior Brad Muster ended his
Cardinal career Saturday against California on a high note. Muster ran

the third period.
booted two perfect pooch punts that
twice nailed the Bears within their own
10-yard line. "This is the best way to
go out. This is the only way to go out."
On Stanford's opening possession of
the second half, the Cardinal got down
to the Cal 7, where the offense was
faced with fourth down and two.
Despite the fact that the entire Califor
nia team and all 85,000 people at Stan
ford Stadium knew who would get the
ball, the amazing Muster picked up
three yards on the carry for the first
down.
Three plays later, Johnson took it in
himself from one yard out. "(Center)
Andy Sinclair and the rest of the guys
on the line told me to go left, so I just
followed them," Johnson said. "It was
lucky I did because the defense was
right there.

"Last week they told me to go left
and 1 didn't hear them and went right,"
Johnson added. "It didn't work. So 1
made sure 1 had it this time."
Meanwhile, the Stanford defense
was also putting on an excellent per
formance. In the next California series,
midway through the third quarter, de
fensive tackle Sean Scheller put a
devastating hit on Howe from behind.
Howe fumbled, and the ball was
recovered at the Cal 39 by Stanford
linebacker Kevin Richardson.
"They had a pretty solid and consis
tent drive going," said Scheller, who
finished with a team-high 14 tackles.
"We knew we had to get a big play to
stop their momentum. The guard came
around to cut me off and I jumped over
him and kept running after the quarter
back. He stopped to try to throw, and I
hit him.
"Out of the corner of my eye, I saw
the ball go up, but the hit felt so good 1
just wanted to make sure the quarter
back didn't go after the ball," Scheller

said. "That was one of the best hits of
my career."
The fumble seemed to take away any
life that still remained in the Cal of
fense. The Bears did not manage an
other first down until the second-to-last
play of the game. The Cardinal, how
ever, kept right on rolling, going 38
yards on seven plays to open the fourth
quarter. Muster capped the drive with
a 15-yard touchdown run into the left
side of the end zone.
The final Stanford touchdown came
on a two-yard scoring run by JonVolpe
with 6:06 left to go. The Cardinal cause
was helped by Cal linebacker Ortega,
who finished with an astonishing 24
tackles but kicked a penalty flag after
he was called for a personal foul. The
double penalty moved the ball down to
the Cal 9-yard line.
Cardinal defensive back Chris
Young put the final nail in the Bears'
coffin by picking off a Howe pass at the
Stanford I-yard line with 4:48 left to
deny California another score.
Big Game 1987 turned out to
be a complete win for Stanford in
every possible way, and fittingly,
senior running back Brad Muster
was the star of the game as he
closed out his celebrated Stan
ford career.
The Cardinal (which finished
4-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference,
5-6 overall) dominated Satur
day's 31-7 win over California (2-
3-1, 3-6-1) at Stanford Stadium in
all the offensive categories and
finished with 368 yards of total
offense to Cal's 201 yards.
The Stanford defense forced
three Cal turnovers and only
allowed the Bears into Cardinal
territory three times the entire
game. Eight California drives
were stifled before the Bears
could even muster a single first
down.
Special teams, however, may
have been the factor most di
rectly responsible for the Cardi
nal win in the 90th meeting be
tween the two teams. The pun
ting unit consistently gave the
Bears poor field position, and the
punt return team put Stanford in
good field position throughout
the game.
"This was a total victory,"
said Stanford Coach Jack Elway,
who has a 3-1 record in Big
Games. "We won all three
phases of the football game. The

intensity was there all day.
That's what we like to have."
Stanford standout Muster, an
almost guaranteed first-round
National Football League draft
choice, finished with 90 yards
and one touchdown on 22 carries
and caught seven passes for 56
yards in the last game of his Stan
ford career.
"I wanted to thank the fans,"
said Muster, who went over to
the Stanford student section to
greet the crowd after the contest.
"Everyone shows up for Big
Game, and their cheering really
meant a lot to me throughout the
year."
"Brad is a tremendous back,
and I'm thrilled to death for him
and the finish he had today," El
way said. "He's an outstanding,
outstanding running back, and
this is the way I wanted his
career to end."
Despite missing five games this
season with an ankle injury
Muster scored more career rush
ing touchdowns (27) than anyone
else in Cardinal history. The
senior leaves Stanford as the
second all-time leading rusher
(2943 yards on 686 carries) and
receiver (194 receptions for 1669
yards) in school history. He trails
only current Minnesota Viking
running back Darrin Nelson in
both categories.
"Muster's a heck of a great
