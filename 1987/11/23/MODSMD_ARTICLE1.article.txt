# Card crushes the Bears, 31-7

### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
Big Game 1987 turned out to
be a complete win for Stanford in
every possible way, and fittingly,
senior running back Brad Muster
was the star of the game as he
closed out his celebrated Stan
ford career.
The Cardinal (which finished
4-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference,
5-6 overall) dominated Satur
day's 31-7 win over California (2-
3-1, 3-6-1) at Stanford Stadium in
all the offensive categories and
finished with 368 yards of total
offense to Cal's 201 yards.
The Stanford defense forced
three Cal turnovers and only
allowed the Bears into Cardinal
territory three times the entire
game. Eight California drives
were stifled before the Bears
could even muster a single first
down.
Special teams, however, may
have been the factor most di
rectly responsible for the Cardi
nal win in the 90th meeting be
tween the two teams. The pun
ting unit consistently gave the
Bears poor field position, and the
punt return team put Stanford in
good field position throughout
the game.
"This was a total victory,"
said Stanford Coach Jack Elway,
who has a 3-1 record in Big
Games. "We won all three
phases of the football game. The

intensity was there all day.
That's what we like to have."
Stanford standout Muster, an
almost guaranteed first-round
National Football League draft
choice, finished with 90 yards
and one touchdown on 22 carries
and caught seven passes for 56
yards in the last game of his Stan
ford career.
"I wanted to thank the fans,"
said Muster, who went over to
the Stanford student section to
greet the crowd after the contest.
"Everyone shows up for Big
Game, and their cheering really
meant a lot to me throughout the
year."
"Brad is a tremendous back,
and I'm thrilled to death for him
and the finish he had today," El
way said. "He's an outstanding,
outstanding running back, and
this is the way I wanted his
career to end."
Despite missing five games this
season with an ankle injury
Muster scored more career rush
ing touchdowns (27) than anyone
else in Cardinal history. The
senior leaves Stanford as the
second all-time leading rusher
(2943 yards on 686 carries) and
receiver (194 receptions for 1669
yards) in school history. He trails
only current Minnesota Viking
running back Darrin Nelson in
both categories.
"Muster's a heck of a great
