# Theta Delts call in police to end party
## 
### Sean kinch Staff writer 
Police officers were called in
by the Theta Delta Chi fraternity
president Saturday night to break
up a Theta Delt party that, be
cause of large numbers of visiting
UC-Berkeley students, had
become too l<yge to be con
trolled.
Theta Delt President Robin
Vasan spoke to an officer outside
of the Theta Delt house around
midnight after Vasan's attempts
at controlling the party had
failed. Vasan said the house was
overcrowded and there were too
many people outside to monitor
the situation properly.

Vasan estimated that there
were between 400 and 500 people
at the party, 70 percent from
Berkeley, when fraternity mem
bers began to ask people to
leave.
Vasan said the Theta Delts
were watching the front door, but
"the problem was that there
were a large number of Cal
people coming in other en
trances. Our house just isn't big
enough to hold that many
people."
Vasan said he and several other
Theta Delt members were able to
remove many of the guests, but
needed the help of the police offi
cers to finish the task.

Pisano said Vasan's actions Sat
urday night demonstrated good
judgment.
Pisano praised Vasan and the
Theta Delts for trying to control
the party on their own first, then
requesting police assistance
when the party had become "out
of hand."
Sergeant Nick Brunot, the
Stanford Police watch com
mander Saturday night, con
firmed that the Stanford police
were approached by Theta Delt
members to intervene in the
party. Brunot said the police de
partment had recieved no com
plaints of noise or safety prob
lems about the party prior to
Vasan's request for assistance.

According to Brunot, police
officers issued some citations
outside of the party to minors
who were in possession of alco
hol, but no citations were given
inside the house.
Brunot said five officers en
tered the party wearing helmets
because they had seen people
throwing bottles on the back
porch, but they had no difficul
ties when they asked people to
leave. The officers stayed in the
house for about an hour, accord
ing to Brunot.
"I think it's our responsibility
to control the party as far as pos
sible. All risks cannot be min
imized, but we have to do every
thing we can," Vasan said.
