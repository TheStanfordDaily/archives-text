Reformers in the Chinese government hope
to encourage U.S. capital investment in their
country, a delegation of high-ranking Chinese
officials intent upon "bringing China into the
21st century" said here Friday.
The delegation was here to study "the in
teraction between science and technology
and its relationship to social change," said
delegation head Ma Hung at a Friday press
conference at Bechtel International Center.
Ma and his entourage were the first high
ranking Chinese visitors to come to the Bay
Area since General Secretary Deng Xiaoping

stepped down as head of the Communist
Party at the 13th Party Congress two weeks
ago.
Deng's resignation was part of a leadership
reorganization he devised to bring into power
younger leaders who would continue to
develop economic cooperation with the
West.
"We're seeking a "new face' with regard to
Sino-American cooperation," Ma said
through an interpreter. "We're looking at the
experience in Silicon Valley and what would
suit China's needs in science and technologi
cal development."
Ma, who submitted a report titled "China
in 2000'' to the State Council, the country's

supreme executive body, said the current
reform is "open to the outside world" and
aims at "developing the Chinese economy
faster and better."
The Stanford stopover capped the delega
tion's week-long California visit after a five
day retreat with a group of Silicon Valley and
national business executives aimed at in
creasing U.S. capital investment in China.
Among participants on the retreat were
representatives from the onetime Stanford
Research Institute, now SRI International,
which was divorced from the University in
1970 amid controversy over Vietnam-related
research.
