# Judge Kennedy to visit this winter
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
Supreme Court nominee
Anthony Kennedy told The
Daily yesterday he has
postponed a Dec. 16 engage
ment to speak here before the
Stanford Federalist Society,
because he will be in Washing
ton appearing before the U.S.
Senate in his confirmation
hearings.
Kennedy, speaking in a tele
phone interview last night
from his home in Sacramento,
refused to comment on his ex
pected confirmation, saying
that "will be up to the Sen
ate."
Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Joseph Biden (D-
Del.) announced Friday that
the hearings would begin Dec.
14. A vote is not likely until
February, however, due to the
Christmas recess. Kennedy
said he hopes to speak to the
Federalists "sometime during
winter quarter."
Second-year law student
John Reynen, vice-president
of the Federalist Society, said
the Federalists chose Ken
nedy in part because of his
1985 ruling on comparable

worth, which reversed a lower
court decision requiring the
state of Washington to pay
comparable wages for similar
work.
"I, as most Federalists, am
a big believer in the free mar
ket," Reynen said, explaining
that disparities in wages are
often the result of market
forces and not gender discrim
ination. "His views com
port well with those of the
(Federalist) Society," Reynen
said of Kennedy. "He did not
pass a litmus test.
Kennedy earned a bache
lor's degree in political science
here in 1958 before receiving a
law degree from Harvard Uni
versity and taking his current
position as a federal appeals
court judge in Sacramento.
The Federalists are "a na
tional organization consisting
of conservative and libertarian
law students, professors and
attorneys with no particular
political affiliation," accord
ing to Reynen.
Federalism advocates "in
creasing power to the state
vis-a-vis the national govern
ment," said Reyden, who
added that the Federalists are
a relatively new group.
