## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper NCAA ruling flawed 
### 
On Thursday Santa Clara County Superior
Court Judge Conrad Rushing came down hard
on the NCAA. "The NCAA drug program," he
wrote, "violates the California constitution and
the United States Constitution in that there is no
evidence of a 'compelling need' to engage in the
testing of college athletes."
Rushing's decision has implications that tran
scend the specific case of Stanford athletes Jen
nifer Hill and Barry McKeever. The judge ruled
that the embarrassing practice of forcing stu
dents to undergo monitored urination in order to
determine athletic eligibility violates the privacy
of the students. This right to privacy is explicit in
the Constitution of the State of California.
But according to Rushing, the NCAA's drug
testing program is illegitimate not only in Cali
fornia but also in the rest of the United States be
cause it violates the Fourth Amendment's
prohibition of unreasonable searches and
seizures. To be allowed to infringe this basic
constitutional right, the NCAA would have to
prove there is a "compelling need" to test col
lege athletes for drugs. Finding no such need,
Rushing forbade the NCAA to continue testing.
Despite this strong statement, however. Rush
ing exempted football and men's basketball from
his injunction. The NCAA will be able to con
tinue testing athletes in these two sports if it
brings its testing program into line with the
"spirit" of the judge's decision.
This proposed division of college athletics into
two unequal groups — football and men's bas

ketball on one hand and every other sport on the
other — is unfair and unproductive. We hope
that after Rushing's more thorough review of the
two sports, scheduled for a Dec. 4 hearing, he
will conclude that no drug-testing program the
NCAA might propose could fall within the
"spirit" of his eloquent and powerful decision.
The NCAA's plan to subject football players
and men's basketball players to mandatory,
monitored testing stems from its desire to ensure
fair athletic competition and to regulate the
health and well-being of college athletes. Neither
fairness nor paternalistic concern, however, can
justify the systematic, unprovoked and degrad
ing searches of students that drug testing entails.
In and of itself, drug use is not the root prob
lem leading to unfair collegiate athletic competi
tion. Rather, it is a symptom of the semi
professional attitude many schools adopt toward
their football and basketball programs. The ben
efit given by steroids to individual players is
marginal. The benefit given to certain institu
tions by unscrupulous recruiting practices and
routine fudging of academic standards, however,
is huge.
If the NCAA is serious about leveling the ath
letic playing field, it should crack down on these
institutional practices. It should not abridge the
constitutional rights of students.
Free and equitable collegiate athletics is a de
sirable thing. But the right to privacy — whether
explicit in the California constitution or implicit
in the guarantees of the U.S. Constitution — is
fundamental to the functioning of our society.
