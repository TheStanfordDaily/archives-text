Speaker marred
conference with
slander of Jews
We are deeply angered that the
efforts to decrease racism on this
campus necessitate increased
and blatant anti-Semitism. We
firmly support the efforts of all
minority groups at Stanford to
eliminate discrimination, but we
have little sympathy, and instead
utter intolerance and rage, for
people such as Lawrence Carter,
a guest speaker at the "You Can
Make a Difference" conference.
His remarks, describing Jews
as "selfish, arrogant and supe
rior" greatly undermined a con
ference "intended to attack rac
ism." How can one seriously
consider the message of this con
ference when Rev. Carter blames
the Jews for contributing to the
institution of black slavery and
accuses them of believing that
"all non-Jews can take a free jet
ride to hell."
We are greatly disappointed
that few if any individuals pres
ent for this speech voiced any
concern or discontent. If we
can't "make a difference" for the
benefit of all, then our efforts for
change are meaningless.

Story on MEChA
told only one side
The Daily's story on my
meeting with MEChA ("Short
meeting disappoints Chicanos,"
Nov. 19) was unfortunate in
three respects, although The
Daily is responsible for only one
of these.
First, I thought the meeting
was both constructive and use
ful. The Daily reported disap
pointment* that some subjects
were not discussed, but that is
because they were not raised.
There was not time to do so. A
wide range of matters was dis
cussed thoroughly, including
those listed on an agenda
supplied by students in advance.
Thus, 1 am at a loss to explain the
negative tone of the article.
Second, the article reports stu
dents' disappointment that the
meeting was too short, yet the
length of it had been agreed upon
weeks in advance, and no one
raised an objection beforehand.
In fact, I stayed a little beyond
the allotted time â€” and was glad
to do so. The Daily could have
checked into the validity of these
charges by asking my office
about the advance arrangements,
but no effort was made to get our
side of the story.
Finally, the reason there was
not a similar meeting last year is
that none was requested.

Truth of Stanford
stereotype shown
in Berkeley article
In "Behind enemy lines: Going
undercover in Berkeley" (Daily,
Nov. 19), the authors described
how Berkeley students stere
otype all Stanford students as
"clean-cut and rich."
While Big Game hyperbole is
understandable, making fun of
street people who live on
Telegraph Avenue and of stu
dents demonstrating against dis
crimination is the wrong way to
go about it. If the authors had
wanted to show that many Stan
ford students are socially con
cerned, they could easily have
pointed to recent efforts by the
Black Student Union, MEChA
and other undergraduate stu
dents to diversify the campus
curriculum, combat institutional
racism and to support the health
and rights of farm workers, or to
recent initiatives by some law
students to end discrimination by
visiting employers.
The authors stated, perhaps
correctly, that the 500-person
demonstration by Berkeley
stuents was huge compared to
Stanford standards; however, I
for one do not find such stan
dards anything to be proud of.
