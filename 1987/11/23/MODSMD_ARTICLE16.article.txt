# Taking on Thanksgiving
## 
### 
Well, it's back again. No, not Star Trek. Thanks
giving. I'm awfully sorry to belabor the point, be
cause right now we're all being inundated with
turkey things everywhere we look. But I have a few
things to get off my chest in regard to this holiday.
Plainly speaking, I despise Thanksgiving. Let's
face it: Thanksgiving has the dubious distinction of
being the only holiday more useless than Arbor
Day.

Pinko, you scream? Enemy of the American
Way and cranberry sauce? Perhaps, but I don't
think I'm the only one. In preparation for this
column 1 asked several friends to share past
Thanksgiving experiences that stuck out in their
minds as being particularly representative of the
holiday. The results were sobering. Almost without
exception, they all qualified as sample plots for the
Twilight Zone.
For myself, Thanksgiving is a veritable ware
house of bad memories. Vomiting after eating enor
mous quantities of sweet potatoes at age seven.
Nearly grinding up my right index finger while
making cranberry sauce in a hideous ouasi
medieval contraption 1 suspect was originally de
signed for use by the Spanish Inquisition.
There was the year we had dinner prepared by
my mother and both of my grandmothers. Each
made her own favorite recipe for stuffing and then
watched like hawks to make sure that if you had a
helping of one kind, you had more of the other,
also. And God help you if you finished the oyster
stuffing before the celery one or left a bit of bread
filling on the side of your plate. Hell hath no fury
like cooks who have had their stuffing scorned.
The worst by far was last year. I didn't go home
for Thanksgiving, thinking it a bit excessive to pay
over $200 for a whopping four days of canned cran
berry sauce. Instead, I accompanied a friend from
my dorm to his aunt's house in San Carlos for my
first real taste of how Californians celebrate
Thanksgiving. The results were, to put it mildly,
shocking.
When I came down south to school, I expected
decadence. I assumed I was casting myself into a
pit of questionable morality and bizarre customs,
but I thought I could handle it. But this was too
much. You can call me old-fashioned and set in my
ways, but I always assumed that one cooked the
traditional turkey in an oven. Whoops. Wrong
there. In California, it appears one barbecues the
turkey on the grill outside.
I kid you not. My friend's aunt was sunbathing,
basting herself with Hawaiian Tropics oil, then

hopping up to baste the bird on the Grillmaster Por
table Patio Fun Barbecue. I was afraid she'd get
confused and we'd end up with a turkey that tasted
of the "natural essences of cocconut and papaya."
When I tactfully expressed surprise at this mode of
preparation, she became defensive and reminded
me that the Pilgrims did not have GE electric
ovens, so this was closer to the way our forefathers
had made their meal.
I countered by observing that I doubted they had
worn bikinis during the process. She became
decidedly unfriendly after that, and 1 noticed a
glaring omission of my name in her husband's
lengthy grace, in which he asked for blessings for
everyone else present, absent family members, the
entire NFL and the soul of the departed turkey that
lay before us, zebra-striped with grill marks.
By now you're probably saying, "So you don't
like Thanksgiving. Alright, maybe it is as worthless
as an Axe Rally without an axe, but what are you
going to do about it?" Patience, gentle reader, pa
tience. I have given it a good deal of thought and
decided that when in doubt, be dogmatic.
With this in mind, I present the following
manifesto of demands. Please clip it out. sign it and
send it to the appropriate authority. Try the Grand
Poobah of Official Holidays. Together we can beat
Thanksgiving. I know we can. Trust me.
A Manifesto of Protest in the Face of Imminent
Turkey
We, the undersigned, demand that the following
be met:
1. Thanksgiving is entirely too close to
Christmas. It is too much to ask that we be full oÂ£
cheer and good will twice within the'space of
month. We demand that it be moved to May.
2. The pumpkin is a gourd. Gourds arc
decorative, even whimsically charming in center
pieces and the like. They do not, however, belong
in pie.
3. Pilgrim clothing, while quaint, is still stupid.
Pilgrims were narrow-minded, overly serious
people with a penchant for witch-burning. They are
hardly appropriate symbols for any kind of festive
occasion. We demand that they be replaced by
something more cheerful, like the Quaker Oat Man,
or perhaps Smurfs. At the very least, they should
be portrayed as attired in pastel colors.
4. It shall be made postal service policy not to
deliver Thanksgiving cards of any kind, especially
those with overly sentimental messages or puns on
the words "turkey'' and "pilgrim." Let those who
wish to send cards, send cash. This will be reason
for some real thanksgiving.
We suggest that this manifesto not be dis
regarded. Just because it is printed on newspaper
doesn't mean we're not serious. Think protest
marches. Think sit-ins. Think mass releases of
captive turkey flocks. It could get ugly. We mean
it. Really.
Oh, by the way, happy Thanksgiving.
