## 'Outside' interests cannot be ignored 
### 
1 applaud the central thrust of the Daily's
Nov. 13 editorial ("No Bohemians, please").
We are indeed entitled to express "justifiable
outrage" not just that Stanford functionaries
find it desirable to belong to the blatantly
racist and sexist Bohemian Club, but that, as
President Kennedy has now been forced to
admit, the University subsidizes their mem
bership in the club.

The Daily makes a more disputable point,
however, in suggesting that students are
"being used as tools for outside interest
groups" when they support unions like Ser
vice Fmployees International Local 2 and the
United Farm Workers.
No one likes to be used. That is a form of
exploitation denounced by a long line of
moral philosophers — among them Kant,
Marx and Sartre. But one should distinguish
between exploitation and the conscious deci
sion to stand up in defense of others who are
themselves being used. Students have a right
to assert their solidarity with the victims of
skulduggery in the "outside" world and to
protest the clandestine alliances with it that
Stanford administrators don't seem to tell us
about until they run out of deniability.
This raises the question of whether some
interests are more "outside" than others.
Must we shudder with horror only when we

learn there are students who care about the
farm workers or the Bohemian Club's dis
criminatory practices?
Does The Daily seriously believe that Stan
ford is a sheltered grove of academia, free of
all other ties with "outside organizations?"
What of Stanford's ties with the Defense De
partment, the corporations represented in the
Center for Integrated Systems? And what of
the University's place in the biomedical in
dustry? The setting up of the "outside inter
ests" strawman reminds me of Ronald
Reagan's repeated vow to resist the pressure
of "special interest groups" — meaning, of
course, women, ethnic minorities and the
poor.
A few decades ago, Southern politicians
regularly used to denounce NAACP lawyers
as subversive "outside agitators" sent down
from the North to stir up trouble among the
local blacks, to "use" them in the pursuit of
"another agenda." Now it's Cesar Chavez
and Local 2 who are the villains.
In the spring of 1977, following the arrest of
almost 300 students in a nonviolent sit-in at
the Old Union to protest Stanford invest
ments in U.S. firms operating in South
Africa, Donald Kennedy's predecessor,
Richard Lyman, who, like Kennedy,
defended those investments, declared that
the University's freedom depended on "our
not becoming captives of any political move
ments."
I suggest we look at the revelation of Stan
ford's under-the-counter deal with the

Bohemian Club as part of an overall pattern
developed in a historical context.
Stanford has come a long way since its
founding a century ago as a charitable institu
tion for the education of poor people's
children. Consider its many links through the
Board of Trustees with the corporate world,
its history of weapons-oriented research and
its financial dependence on the Defense De
partment during the Vietnam war, a relation
ship now again being avidly cultivated by
President Kennedy.
Consider the snail's pace of divestment,
the refusal over many years to take women
and minority students' criticism of the West
ern Culture requirement seriously, the way
the administration dragged its feet in coming
to a commitment to end discrimination
against gay people and how the University
still responds feebly to accusations of institu
tional racism.
Consider finally Stanford's intransigent
hostility toward the unionization of its own
workers. In this context, the "Scandal in
Bohemia" is no anomaly.
The pattern is clear. For Stanford, the rich
and powerful, cavorting in the Bohemian
Grove or cutting deals in board rooms across
the nation, are "insiders,'' whose legitimacy
on the campus is not to be questioned.
Working people, particularly when they are
women or ot color, are "outsiders" — and
tricky ones to boot.
