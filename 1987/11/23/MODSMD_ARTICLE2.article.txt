# Precedent not yet assured in NCAA case

Although Thursday's decision to give two Stan
ford athletes an injunction against NCAA drug test
ing may help other college athletes in similar court
battles, it must he upheld in higher state and federal
courts before it is to become a binding legal prece
dent, constitutional experts predicted over the
weekend.
Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Conrad
Rushing's ruling that the National Collegiate Athle
tic Association drug-testing program violated ath
letes' rights to privacy under the state and federal
constitutions currently applies only to Stanford ath
letes, with the exception of football and men's bas
ketball players. These players still must sign con
sent forms submitting themselves to drug testing if
participate in postseason competition.
David Tarshes, a lawyer representing a Univer
sity of Washington athlete who has filed suit against
her school and its drug-testing program, said Fri
day, "I think the decision is going to carry some
weight in other cases." But larshes acknowledged
that the federal court hearing his client's case would
not be "obliged'' in any way to follow Rushing's de
cision.
Reaction to the ruling was similar at the Univer
sity of Southern California, another Pacific 10 Con
ference school. USC l aw Prof. Erwin Chemerinski
called the decision "extremely important." He was
optimistic that the decision would bring about
changes in the current NCAA testing program. "1
have grave questions about a routine test for street
drugs. I think we should focus (tests) on
performance-enhancing drugs such as anabolic
steroids."
The final ruling in the case will likely be cited in
other cases around the country where student ath
letes oppose school drug-testing programs, said Jim
Steyer, a Stanford political science lecturer.
Jack Friedenthal, associate dean of Stanford Law
School and faculty athletic representative to the
NCAA, called the decision a good one, adding that
"the NCAA program as a whole did not justify the
testing."
Friedenthal noted that an appeal by the NCAA in
the California Supreme Court could backfire if it is
unsuccessful. "What is the NCAA going to do?" he
asked. "Are they going to test everybody except
California athletes?
If the NCAA were to appeal further, the case
would then approach the District Court, whose
jurisdiction spans the western United States. A
ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court would set a legal
precedent for all federal and state courts in the
country.
The NCAA has been ordered to re-appear in
court on Dec. 4 to present an alternate testing pro
gram for football and men's basketball, the only two
sports the court has determined demonstrate a
"compelling need" for testing on the grounds of last
year's drug-test results.
