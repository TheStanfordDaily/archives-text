## Central America is 1987 topic Frosh debaters head the pack

The trophies are starting to pile
up for the Stanford debate team.
The team has been impressive
so far, placing in all three tourna
ments it has competed in. More
impressive still is that all the
trophies have been won by fresh
men.
The first tournament Stanford
attended this year was at Cal
State-Hay ward last month.
Though only two Stanford teams
were sent, one, consisting of
freshmen Paul Bailin and Mark
Lee, placed third in the senior di
vision at the competition.
"We were real happy with how
it went," Bailin said about the
tournament. "Usually freshmen
start off in the novice . . . divi
sion. We decided to go varsity
just to see how it would go, and
we were real happy with it."
The next weekend at the Hum
boldt State tournament Stanford
freshmen placed again. Ekwan
Rhow and Paula Gani competed
in the open division and took first
place. They finished ahead of
teams from the southern part of
Oregon and the northern half of
California.
Two weekends ago freshman
Irwin Gross from Alondra placed
second in the senior division of
impromptu speaking — an indi
vidual event — at a Sacramento
tournament.
Senior Mark Lemley coaches

the team along with Jan Berman,
who completed a master's degree
here last year. Lemley re
established the debate team in
1985 after a 15-year hiatus.
In the past, the team was sup
ported by the Speech and Drama
Department. However, when the
speech section was abolished 15
years ago the Stanford debate
team was dissolved. The team is
now run entirely by students and
gets no university funding.
At the beginning of the quarter
Lemley and. Berman called a
meeting for all prospective
debaters. The turnout was good,
according to Lemley. He said the
club has a fluid membership of al
most 70 people, although only
about 20 attend each Thursday
night meeting.
At the meetings, evidence to
be included in the team's case is
distributed, and the next tourna
ment is discussed.
Every one of the winning
freshmen participated in some
sort of debate or public speaking
in high school, with the excep
tion of Gani, who is a novice.
According to Mark Lee, col
lege debate — which is organized
under the Cross Examination
Debate Association (CEDA) — is
different from high school
debate, which is organized ac
cording to the National Debate
Tournament (NDT) format.
In NDT, high school students
debate a hypothetical policy res

olution, whereas in CEDA
debate, the resolution deals with
more genuine, "real life" prob
lems, Lee said.
This year's resolution, for ex
ample, states: "Resolved that
continued U.S. covert involve
ment in Central America would
be undesirable." Because of the
difference between high school
and college debate, it is difficult
at first to get accustomed to col
lege debating, according to Lee.

Although the team is young, it
already has a reputation for
having some excellent debaters.
Last year, Lemley and junior
Steve Jurvetson won first place
in the National College Invita
tional Debate Tournament, in
which only the top 10 college
teams in the nation participated.
Lemley is hoping to continue the
Stanford tradition. "We have

and Paula Gani, have led the Stanford debate team to three top finishes
so far this year.
good people with a lot of poten
tial," he said.
In addition to participating in
other colleges' tournaments, the
Stanford debate team will be
hosting a competition Feb. 19-21
in order to raise money. The
tournament, which will be for
high-schoolers, should attract
students from schools all over
the country. Last year between
750 and 1000 students competed
in the tournament, which netted
approximately $6000.
The principal complaint among
Stanford debaters is that par
ticipating on the debate team
monopolizes a great deal of their
time. They must do extensive re
search, write their cases and
prepare their speeches. Accord
ing to the debaters, the work can
be very draining.
Currently, although there is no
existing way to lighten the work
load, Lemley is trying to improve
the program itself. He said he
hopes someday to see the revival
of a public speaking department.
"Their hearts are in the right
place, but things won't get done
unless it's someone's job," Lem
ley said of the administration's
support for the debate team.

so far this year.
good people with a lot of poten
tial," he said.
In addition to participating in
other colleges' tournaments, the
Stanford debate team will be
hosting a competition Feb. 19-21
in order to raise money. The
tournament, which will be for
high-schoolers, should attract
students from schools all over
the country. Last year between
750 and 1000 students competed
in the tournament, which netted
approximately $6000.
The principal complaint among
Stanford debaters is that par
ticipating on the debate team
monopolizes a great deal of their
time. They must do extensive re
search, write their cases and
prepare their speeches. Accord
ing to the debaters, the work can
be very draining.
Currently, although there is no
existing way to lighten the work
load, Lemley is trying to improve
the program itself. He said he
hopes someday to see the revival
of a public speaking department.
"Their hearts are in the right
place, but things won't get done
unless it's someone's job," Lem
ley said of the administration's
support for the debate team.
The trophies are starting to pile
up for the Stanford debate team.
The team has been impressive
so far, placing in all three tourna
ments it has competed in. More
impressive still is that all the
trophies have been won by fresh
men.
The first tournament Stanford
attended this year was at Cal
State-Hay ward last month.
Though only two Stanford teams
were sent, one, consisting of
freshmen Paul Bailin and Mark
Lee, placed third in the senior di
vision at the competition.
"We were real happy with how
it went," Bailin said about the
tournament. "Usually freshmen
start off in the novice . . . divi
sion. We decided to go varsity
just to see how it would go, and
we were real happy with it."
The next weekend at the Hum
boldt State tournament Stanford
freshmen placed again. Ekwan
Rhow and Paula Gani competed
in the open division and took first
place. They finished ahead of
teams from the southern part of
Oregon and the northern half of
California.
Two weekends ago freshman
Irwin Gross from Alondra placed
second in the senior division of
impromptu speaking — an indi
vidual event — at a Sacramento
tournament.
Senior Mark Lemley coaches

the team along with Jan Berman,
who completed a master's degree
here last year. Lemley re
established the debate team in
1985 after a 15-year hiatus.
In the past, the team was sup
ported by the Speech and Drama
Department. However, when the
speech section was abolished 15
years ago the Stanford debate
team was dissolved. The team is
now run entirely by students and
gets no university funding.
At the beginning of the quarter
Lemley and. Berman called a
meeting for all prospective
debaters. The turnout was good,
according to Lemley. He said the
club has a fluid membership of al
most 70 people, although only
about 20 attend each Thursday
night meeting.
At the meetings, evidence to
be included in the team's case is
distributed, and the next tourna
ment is discussed.
Every one of the winning
freshmen participated in some
sort of debate or public speaking
in high school, with the excep
tion of Gani, who is a novice.
According to Mark Lee, col
lege debate — which is organized
under the Cross Examination
Debate Association (CEDA) — is
different from high school
debate, which is organized ac
cording to the National Debate
Tournament (NDT) format.
In NDT, high school students
debate a hypothetical policy res

olution, whereas in CEDA
debate, the resolution deals with
more genuine, "real life" prob
lems, Lee said.
This year's resolution, for ex
ample, states: "Resolved that
continued U.S. covert involve
ment in Central America would
be undesirable." Because of the
difference between high school
and college debate, it is difficult
at first to get accustomed to col
lege debating, according to Lee.

Although the team is young, it
already has a reputation for
having some excellent debaters.
Last year, Lemley and junior
Steve Jurvetson won first place
in the National College Invita
tional Debate Tournament, in
which only the top 10 college
teams in the nation participated.
Lemley is hoping to continue the
Stanford tradition. "We have
