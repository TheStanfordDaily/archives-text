# Women's Center seeks recognition
## 
### Lisa Brooks Staff writer 
The Stanford Women's
Center currently suffers from
the same stereotypes about
women it tries to battle, ac
cording to Merielle Flood, co
ordinator for the tenter.
Often people believe "that
women in the Women's Cen
ter have a grudge against
men," Flood said. "They
think we're male-bashers â€”
people who want to get away
from men."
This image problem, which
is compounded by the center's
poor location and lack of fund
ing, may account for the fact
that relatively few people use
the Women's Center at Stan
ford or even know about it.
In order to gain more expo
sure for the center and to edu
cate students about women's
issues, including gender
stereotypes, the center spon
sors a number of programs
throughout the year.
Programs this year have run
the gamut from a forum that
the center co-hosted with the
Intersorority Council called
"Wonderworker Meets Super
woman," to an evening of
comedy with feminist and les
bian humorist Kate Clinton.
In the "Wonderworker

Meets Superwoman" forum in
October, professional women
from various fields discussed
both how they manage to bal
ance career, family and per
sonal goals and how others
can deal as well.
Aside from these smaller
forums, the center hopes that
by sponsoring larger events
and bringing bigger names like
Clinton to campus it can bring
more attention to the organiza
tion.
The center also sponsors
ongoing programs to attract
the general public. Every
Monday night, for example,
the center holds an open
house, called the "Coffee
house," where anyone can
drop in to meet other people
and a variety of live en
tertainment from members of
the center or the student body
at large.
Along with sponsoring its
own programs, the center
seeks to address gender and
racial issues by supporting
other groups on campus.
These groups include the
SURE escort service (Stu
dents United for Rape Elimi
nation), which operates on a
nightly basis out of the
Women's Center, and the
