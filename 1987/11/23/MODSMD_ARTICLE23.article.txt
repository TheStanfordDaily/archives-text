# Women's Center seeks recognition
## 
### Lisa Brooks Staff writer 
The Stanford Women's
Center currently suffers from
the same stereotypes about
women it tries to battle, ac
cording to Merielle Flood, co
ordinator for the tenter.
Often people believe "that
women in the Women's Cen
ter have a grudge against
men," Flood said. "They
think we're male-bashers —
people who want to get away
from men."
This image problem, which
is compounded by the center's
poor location and lack of fund
ing, may account for the fact
that relatively few people use
the Women's Center at Stan
ford or even know about it.
In order to gain more expo
sure for the center and to edu
cate students about women's
issues, including gender
stereotypes, the center spon
sors a number of programs
throughout the year.
Programs this year have run
the gamut from a forum that
the center co-hosted with the
Intersorority Council called
"Wonderworker Meets Super
woman," to an evening of
comedy with feminist and les
bian humorist Kate Clinton.
In the "Wonderworker

Meets Superwoman" forum in
October, professional women
from various fields discussed
both how they manage to bal
ance career, family and per
sonal goals and how others
can deal as well.
Aside from these smaller
forums, the center hopes that
by sponsoring larger events
and bringing bigger names like
Clinton to campus it can bring
more attention to the organiza
tion.
The center also sponsors
ongoing programs to attract
the general public. Every
Monday night, for example,
the center holds an open
house, called the "Coffee
house," where anyone can
drop in to meet other people
and a variety of live en
tertainment from members of
the center or the student body
at large.
Along with sponsoring its
own programs, the center
seeks to address gender and
racial issues by supporting
other groups on campus.
These groups include the
SURE escort service (Stu
dents United for Rape Elimi
nation), which operates on a
nightly basis out of the
Women's Center, and the
Women Defending Ourselves,
which holds two or three self
defense classes per quarter in the
center.
The center also supports
Aurora, a feminist newsletter,
and the Pornography Media
Watch Project, which acts
against advertisers that exploit
men and women.
Besides helping feminist
groups, the Women's Center also
supports efforts of minority
groups to gain greater represen
tation in the community.
At the center's Wednesday
night meetings, which are open
to the public, the 15 core mem
bers of the Women's Center col
lective decide policy for the or
ganization. Of these 15 members,
two are men.
"I believe that women are
equal to men," said graduate stu
dent Richard Vaughan, one of the
two male members, in explaining
why he joined the group.
"I think that most people be
lieve that men and women are
equal, but they have a perception
that [feminists] are radical
women hating men," Vaughan
said. "We have to change the
perception of what a feminist is."

However, Sarah Tiederman, a
junior majoring in anthropology,
said she believes that there is
some truth to anti-men
stereotypes surrounding the
Women's Center.
"Most of the women involved
here have made women the cen
ter of their lives," she said.
Speaking about membership in
the center, Audrey Berlowitz, a
Stanford graduate and teacher in
the Women Defending Ourselves
classes, said, "Some people are
straight, some bisexual, and
some are lesbians."
This diversity among members
of the Women's Center provides
"one of the few safe places that a
woman can go and be supported
for being herself," according to
Flood.
However, the center, which is
located in the Toyon Eating
Clubs, finds it difficult to spread
its services to the rest of the com
munity because few people know
about the organization. One of
the reasons for this, according to
Flood, is the location of the cen
ter.
Members of the Women's Cen
ter said they feel that if the organ
ization was more centrally lo
cated on campus, people would
know about its existence and
take advantage of the opportuni
ties that it offers.
"Where you're placed (on

campus) indicates how much you
count," Flood said.
The Women's Center has
fought unsuccessfully to be
moved to Old Union in order to
be in the mainstream of campus
life.
With the reorganization of
Tresidder Union, members said
they hope to establish an office
there.
Besides facing image and loca
tion problems, the Women's
Center contends with budget
troubles that its counterparts on
other college campuses don't
have to face.
Currently, the center receives
$14,000 per year from ASSU
funds. This money goes toward
Flood's salary and various
events that the organization
sponsors.
Similar centers at UC-
Berkeley and UC-Santa Cruz
receive heftier budgets and pro
vide more services to their
respective communities.
The Women's Resource Cen
ter at Berkeley, for example,
received around $190,000, after
budget cuts, this year from stu
dent registration fees.
The Women's Center at UC-
Santa Cruz has a $60,000 income
from student registration fees,
according to Patty Marrotte, a
volunteer there.
An important drawback to

these centers' large operating
budgets, however, is the fact that
the University of California
maintains more control over its
women's centers because the or
ganizations are run by adminis
trators chosen by the university
rather than by students.
Although the Stanford
Women's Center suffers from a
lack of resources, many Stanford
women said they appreciate the
fact that students and not the
University run the Women's
Center, according to Flood.

Berlowitz said that the Santa
Cruz center "is beautiful, but it
seems to be run by professional
women. Give me students any
day."
While acknowledging that
"Santa Cruz has a lot of organ
ized activities," Tiederman said
she felt the Stanford group is
more personal.
"Our [Women's Center] em
phasizes more personal develop
ment and how you're going to
change your thinking' about
women in society, she said.

The Stanford Women's
Center currently suffers from
the same stereotypes about
women it tries to battle, ac

women said they appreciate the
fact that students and not the
University run the Women's
Center, according to Flood.

Berlowitz said that the Santa
Cruz center "is beautiful, but it
seems to be run by professional
women. Give me students any
day."
While acknowledging that
"Santa Cruz has a lot of organ
ized activities," Tiederman said
she felt the Stanford group is
more personal.
"Our [Women's Center] em
phasizes more personal develop
ment and how you're going to
change your thinking' about
women in society, she said.

The Stanford Women's
Center currently suffers from
the same stereotypes about
women it tries to battle, ac
cording to Merielle Flood, co
ordinator for the tenter.
Often people believe "that
women in the Women's Cen
ter have a grudge against
men," Flood said. "They
think we're male-bashers —
people who want to get away
from men."
This image problem, which
is compounded by the center's
poor location and lack of fund
ing, may account for the fact
that relatively few people use
the Women's Center at Stan
ford or even know about it.
In order to gain more expo
sure for the center and to edu
cate students about women's
issues, including gender
stereotypes, the center spon
sors a number of programs
throughout the year.
Programs this year have run
the gamut from a forum that
the center co-hosted with the
Intersorority Council called
"Wonderworker Meets Super
woman," to an evening of
comedy with feminist and les
bian humorist Kate Clinton.
In the "Wonderworker

Meets Superwoman" forum in
October, professional women
from various fields discussed
both how they manage to bal
ance career, family and per
sonal goals and how others
can deal as well.
Aside from these smaller
forums, the center hopes that
by sponsoring larger events
and bringing bigger names like
Clinton to campus it can bring
more attention to the organiza
tion.
The center also sponsors
ongoing programs to attract
the general public. Every
Monday night, for example,
the center holds an open
house, called the "Coffee
house," where anyone can
drop in to meet other people
and a variety of live en
tertainment from members of
the center or the student body
at large.
Along with sponsoring its
own programs, the center
seeks to address gender and
racial issues by supporting
other groups on campus.
These groups include the
SURE escort service (Stu
dents United for Rape Elimi
nation), which operates on a
nightly basis out of the
Women's Center, and the
Women Defending Ourselves,
which holds two or three self
defense classes per quarter in the
center.
The center also supports
Aurora, a feminist newsletter,
and the Pornography Media
Watch Project, which acts
against advertisers that exploit
men and women.
Besides helping feminist
groups, the Women's Center also
supports efforts of minority
groups to gain greater represen
tation in the community.
At the center's Wednesday
night meetings, which are open
to the public, the 15 core mem
bers of the Women's Center col
lective decide policy for the or
ganization. Of these 15 members,
two are men.
"I believe that women are
equal to men," said graduate stu
dent Richard Vaughan, one of the
two male members, in explaining
why he joined the group.
"I think that most people be
lieve that men and women are
equal, but they have a perception
that [feminists] are radical
women hating men," Vaughan
said. "We have to change the
perception of what a feminist is."

However, Sarah Tiederman, a
junior majoring in anthropology,
said she believes that there is
some truth to anti-men
stereotypes surrounding the
Women's Center.
"Most of the women involved
here have made women the cen
ter of their lives," she said.
Speaking about membership in
the center, Audrey Berlowitz, a
Stanford graduate and teacher in
the Women Defending Ourselves
classes, said, "Some people are
straight, some bisexual, and
some are lesbians."
This diversity among members
of the Women's Center provides
"one of the few safe places that a
woman can go and be supported
for being herself," according to
Flood.
However, the center, which is
located in the Toyon Eating
Clubs, finds it difficult to spread
its services to the rest of the com
munity because few people know
about the organization. One of
the reasons for this, according to
Flood, is the location of the cen
ter.
Members of the Women's Cen
ter said they feel that if the organ
ization was more centrally lo
cated on campus, people would
know about its existence and
take advantage of the opportuni
ties that it offers.
"Where you're placed (on

campus) indicates how much you
count," Flood said.
The Women's Center has
fought unsuccessfully to be
moved to Old Union in order to
be in the mainstream of campus
life.
With the reorganization of
Tresidder Union, members said
they hope to establish an office
there.
Besides facing image and loca
tion problems, the Women's
Center contends with budget
troubles that its counterparts on
other college campuses don't
have to face.
Currently, the center receives
$14,000 per year from ASSU
funds. This money goes toward
Flood's salary and various
events that the organization
sponsors.
Similar centers at UC-
Berkeley and UC-Santa Cruz
receive heftier budgets and pro
vide more services to their
respective communities.
The Women's Resource Cen
ter at Berkeley, for example,
received around $190,000, after
budget cuts, this year from stu
dent registration fees.
The Women's Center at UC-
Santa Cruz has a $60,000 income
from student registration fees,
according to Patty Marrotte, a
volunteer there.
An important drawback to

these centers' large operating
budgets, however, is the fact that
the University of California
maintains more control over its
women's centers because the or
ganizations are run by adminis
trators chosen by the university
rather than by students.
Although the Stanford
Women's Center suffers from a
lack of resources, many Stanford
women said they appreciate the
fact that students and not the
University run the Women's
Center, according to Flood.

Berlowitz said that the Santa
Cruz center "is beautiful, but it
