In the 90th annual Big Game Saturday, the mighty Stanford
Cardinal recaptured the Axe from the dreaded California
Golden Bears.
The victory added a little sweetness to what has often been a
bitter season for the team â€” injury after injury kept the Cardi
nal from achieving all it set out to do.
Nevertheless, after an 0-4 start Stanford came on strong. Led
by an unparalleled tailback named Brad Muster, a freshman
quarterback named Brian Johnson and a tough defense that
wouldn't quit, the Cardinal won five of its last seven games.
The victory marked the end of the college careers of several
outstanding players, including punter Doug Robison, tight end
Eric Snelson, wide receiver Jeff James, strong safety Brad
Humphreys, placekicker David Sweeney, fullback Marshall
Dillard, free safety Bruce Richardson and defensive end Sean
Scheller.
