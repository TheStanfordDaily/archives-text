# Cardinal edged by No. 1 Bears
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
The collegiate water polo god
may have already chosen this
season's big winner.
Stanford fans may believe that
every year the Cardinal should
be No. 1, but somebody with
more clout seems to have
decided otherwise. So far, 1987 is
definitely California's year, and
the year only has one weekend
left.
Saturday morning at deGuerre
Pool, No. 3 Stanford and No. I
Cal fought hard for the Big
Splash's rustproof Axe in the
regular season finale. The Bears,
who have been just barely edging
their opponents all season, won
5-4 in a game played at such a
high level that both teams will go
confidently into Thanksgiving
weekend's NCAA champion
ships at Long Beach State's Bel
mont Arena.
The game was just as close as
the score indicated. Stanford's
players and coach pointed to a
few Cardinal errors, smart and
physical Bear play and over
lenient refereeing as the factors
that made the difference in the
contest.
"We played well and there's
not much you can do," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"It's just frustrating when the
referee doesn't call anything, and
so Cal just hacks all over the
place.
"It takes away the offense;
you just don't get many opportu
nities. Every little mistake is
magnified. We didn't really make
that many mistakes. It was the
one or two mistakes they capital
ized on that made the differ
ence."
"They're impressive," Cardi
nal sophomore Steve Millham
said. "They're big and strong
and fast, and they played well
today. But I think we did well

too. I think we're two evenly
matched teams."
Stanford never had a lead, as
Cal scored early and stayed up
by one or two goals for almost
the entire game. With help from
the referee's lack of foul calls,
the match quickly proved to be a
defensive battle.
"We had to play very, very
well — great defensively," said
California Coach Pete Cutino,
who has coached the Bears for
(he past quarter-century. "Five
to four with that kind of intensity
is a great game."
Stanford played its best polo in
the game's final minutes, re
peatedly stopping the Bears' of
fense and then getting good shots
at the other end. The 15(H) fans at
deGuerre, comprising by far the
Cardinal's largest home water
polo crowd of the season, were
worn down to a bundle of nerves
by the time the Stanford players
made their last dash for a game
tying goal after a clutch steal
gave them one final possession.
After a couple of passes among
wing players, Stanford got the
ball into senior Erich Fischer,
who held solid position in front of
the cage at three meters. A well
timed drive by Millham left him
instantaneously open between
his defender and the goal just a
meter out. Fischer's pass was
there, but Millham, suddenly,
was not. In front of the net in per
fect position to score, Millham
had been dragged underwater by
a Cal defender. The ball was
picked up by Cal as Millham re
emerged from underwater.
"I think we got reamed by the
refs at the end," Millham said. "I
drove inside water down there,
Fish (Fischer) passed me the ball
but the guy just mauled me. It
should have been a four-meter
(penalty shot)."
Millham said he thought he
would have scored. "If the guy

wasn't holding, it was a good
pass, it was a perfect pass. I was
reaching out to get it and the guy
just clubbed me," he said.
"When it gets down to the end of
the game, the refs are afraid to
make the call that's going to
decide the whole game.'
Outside of a couple of Cardinal
charges in the second half —
when the game seemed to shift
into a higher gear, with Cal's
defense usually keeping right
alongside the Stanford offense —

the match seemed like one steal
after another, with intermittent
shots. According to Dettamanti,
it was Cal's better shooting that
provided them with the slight of
fensive edge.
Each team had only two shots
in the first quarter. The only goal
was scored by Pat Reid early in
the period from almost 10 meters
out. Rcid s raised fist after the
shot was directed light at Cardi
nal goalie Obi Greenman, who
admitted afterward that Reid had

faked him well.
Cardinal junior Jeff Oeding
provided early highlights in the
second quarter when, as he
looked at the cage as if to shoot,
he lobbed the ball perfectly into
the hole to Fischer, who rose out
of the water and redirected the
ball past Cal goalkeeper Jeff
Brush. The goal tied the game at
one.
The game saw only eight ejec
tions, four of them in the second
quarter. Each team capitalized

on each of its man-up opportuni
ties, and Cal's goal with 34
seconds left in the half gave the
Bears a 3-2 lead.
During the third quarter,
senior Matt Biondi took advan
tage of Stanford's third and final
ejection to give the Bears a 4-2
lead going into the final quarter.
Two minutes into that final pe
riod. Fischer scored his, and
Stanford's, third goal. Cal went
