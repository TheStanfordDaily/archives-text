# Elway gives team talk, spurs Card
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Emotions always run high on
Big Game day, but this time for
the Stanford fooball players, the
emotions began one day earlier.
The Stanford football team
thoroughly demolished the
Golden Bears of California in
every statistical category im
aginable during the 31-7 rout Sat
urday afternoon. But according
to Cardinal players after the
game, the numbers on the
scoreboard could be attributed to
a team meeting Friday night.
"Coach Elway decided to put
a twist in the team meeting and
let the seniors take over," junior
defensive tackle Lester Archam
beau said. "The seniors talked
about the team and what they
liked about football. It was pretty
simple, but it allowed everybody
to draw strength from each
other."
The longstanding cliche says
that football games are won on
emotion, and last year the Stan
ford team experienced the verity
of that cliche firsthand as a 1-9
Bear squad feasted entirely on
emotion to defeat a 7-2 Stanford
team.
"We learned our lesson last
year," senior strong safety Brad
Humphreys said. "We knew we
had to play with some emotion,
and I think we caught them at
one of our high points."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway
said that his son John, who quar
terbacked Stanford from 1979 to
1982, recommended the meeting
to him last Wednesday.
"It was kind of a private thing
where we gave our seniors an op
portunity to reflect on their
thoughts about Big Game,"
Coach Elway said.
For many of the seniors, those
thoughts dwelled on the result of
last year's 17-11 loss in Berkeley.
"For me there was no way I
was going to go the rest of my life
with the bad memories of last
year," Cardinal defensive tackle
Sean Scheller said. "It ended up
working well for me."
It certainly did. Scheller gar
nered a team-high 14 tackles,
caused a fumble and recorded a
quarterback sack. The senior's
performance led the Stanford
defense to one of its best games
of the season.
"I'd have to say we rose to the
occasion," Archambeau said.
"On Friday night we said that
this was the beginning of a new
season. Ten games and then this
one — this was the first win of a
new season."
Cardinal senior linebacker
Kurt Colehower also pointed out
thm,,<C#ltfornia was in a similar
position as Stanford was last
season with regard to the
schedule. The Bears have an

other game on their schedule,
next week against Washington
State in Japan.
"Our performance today had a
lot to do with this being the last
game of our careers," Colehower
said. "Cal has another game left
to play, like we had two more to
play last year (including the
Gator Bowl)."
Stanford All-America center
Andy Sinclair, who has another
year of eligibility, believed that
the meeting helped the non
seniors as well.
"That was a pretty emotional
talk last night, and we were
playing the game for the seniors
today, which sparked a little ex
tra effort," Sinclair said. "I had a
good feeling before the game."
"The meeting allowed the un
derclassmen who were there to
get a feeling of what Big Game is

about," Scheller said. "It forced
us all to focus on what the game
meant. There's not much that's
more important."
For wide receiver Walter Bat
son, who caught a Big Game
record 82-yard touchdown pass
and is one of the few true fresh
men to play in Big Game in
recent years, the importance of
the contest still hasn't settled in.
"They (the seniors) know what
Big Game is about. Right now,
for these guys it means a lot more
than it does to me," Batson said.
"You really have to take part in a
couple to know what it's about."
Batson's touchdown catch cer
tainly gave him a notion of the
significance of Big Game.
"1 looked up and 80,000 people
or something were cheering,"
Batson said. "It was a great
feeling."

occasion," Archambeau said.
"On Friday night we said that
this was the beginning of a new
season. Ten games and then this
one — this was the first win of a
new season."
Cardinal senior linebacker
Kurt Colehower also pointed out
thm,,<C#ltfornia was in a similar
position as Stanford was last
season with regard to the
schedule. The Bears have an

other game on their schedule,
next week against Washington
State in Japan.
"Our performance today had a
lot to do with this being the last
game of our careers," Colehower
said. "Cal has another game left
to play, like we had two more to
play last year (including the
Gator Bowl)."
Stanford All-America center
Andy Sinclair, who has another
year of eligibility, believed that
the meeting helped the non
seniors as well.
"That was a pretty emotional
talk last night, and we were
playing the game for the seniors
today, which sparked a little ex
tra effort," Sinclair said. "I had a
good feeling before the game."
"The meeting allowed the un
derclassmen who were there to
get a feeling of what Big Game is

about," Scheller said. "It forced
us all to focus on what the game
meant. There's not much that's
more important."
For wide receiver Walter Bat
son, who caught a Big Game
record 82-yard touchdown pass
and is one of the few true fresh
men to play in Big Game in
recent years, the importance of
the contest still hasn't settled in.
"They (the seniors) know what
Big Game is about. Right now,
for these guys it means a lot more
than it does to me," Batson said.
"You really have to take part in a
couple to know what it's about."
Batson's touchdown catch cer
tainly gave him a notion of the
significance of Big Game.
"1 looked up and 80,000 people
or something were cheering,"
Batson said. "It was a great
feeling."
Emotions always run high on
Big Game day, but this time for
the Stanford fooball players, the
emotions began one day earlier.
The Stanford football team
thoroughly demolished the
Golden Bears of California in
every statistical category im
aginable during the 31-7 rout Sat
urday afternoon. But according
to Cardinal players after the
game, the numbers on the
scoreboard could be attributed to
a team meeting Friday night.
"Coach Elway decided to put
a twist in the team meeting and
let the seniors take over," junior
defensive tackle Lester Archam
beau said. "The seniors talked
about the team and what they
liked about football. It was pretty
simple, but it allowed everybody
to draw strength from each
other."
The longstanding cliche says
that football games are won on
emotion, and last year the Stan
ford team experienced the verity
of that cliche firsthand as a 1-9
Bear squad feasted entirely on
emotion to defeat a 7-2 Stanford
team.
"We learned our lesson last
year," senior strong safety Brad
Humphreys said. "We knew we
had to play with some emotion,
and I think we caught them at
one of our high points."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway
said that his son John, who quar
terbacked Stanford from 1979 to
1982, recommended the meeting
to him last Wednesday.
"It was kind of a private thing
where we gave our seniors an op
portunity to reflect on their
thoughts about Big Game,"
Coach Elway said.
For many of the seniors, those
thoughts dwelled on the result of
last year's 17-11 loss in Berkeley.
"For me there was no way I
was going to go the rest of my life
with the bad memories of last
year," Cardinal defensive tackle
Sean Scheller said. "It ended up
working well for me."
It certainly did. Scheller gar
nered a team-high 14 tackles,
caused a fumble and recorded a
quarterback sack. The senior's
performance led the Stanford
defense to one of its best games
of the season.
"I'd have to say we rose to the
occasion," Archambeau said.
"On Friday night we said that
this was the beginning of a new
season. Ten games and then this
one — this was the first win of a
new season."
