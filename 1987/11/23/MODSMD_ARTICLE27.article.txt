# Spikers end Pac-10 with win over USC
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
It's a happy time of year for most Stan
ford students. Stanford beat California
31-7 in Big Game Saturday, midterms are
over with, and all but a few students now
have some time off before finals.
The Stanford women's volleyball team
finds itself in a similarly satisfying posi
tion. With a 15-12, 15-7, 15-9 victory over
USC at Maples Pavilion Friday night, the
Cardinal ended its Pacific 10 Conference
schedule with a 17-1 record.
Stanford next takes its 25-4 record and
No. 3 national ranking to Hawaii to face
the top-ranked Rainbow Wahines both
Wednesday and Friday nights in a pair of
non-conference contests. After those two
matches, the last on Stanford's regular
season slate, the Cardinal will have a
week off to prepare for the NCAA Cham
pionships, which begin Dec. 3.
Finishing up Pac-10 play with a 17-
match conference winning streak, the
Cardinal achieved its top goal this
season: winning the Pac-10 title. UCLA,
the runner-up to Stanford, has a 13-4 con
ference record with a match at USC
remaining on its schedule. USC finished
third at 12-5, 18-9 overall, followed by
Oregon (12-6) and California (10-6).
The Cardinal was not at top form for
the match Friday but still played well
enough to overwhelm the I3th-ranked
Trojans. "I don't think we were real
sharp," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"(But) when you're not playing your best
and you beat a good team ... I'm always
happy."
The match marked the final regular
season appearance at Maples for graduat
ing seniors Nancy Reno, Wendi Rush and
Teresa Smith. All three heavily contrib
uted in the win. Rush, who came in to the
weekend ranked second in the Pac-10 in
digging, had a team-high 13 digs, second
only to USC's Nancy Hillman's 17.
Rush also had another fine perform
ance running the Cardinal attack.
"Wendi did a good job running the of
fense," Shaw said. This was made clear
all night as Rush was continually able to
fool the Trojan blockers, often allowing
her teammates to hit unopposed.
Reno was the Cardinal's big gun in the
middle, tallying 15 kills and a .480 hitting
percentage. She also added a match-high
six blocks and 10 digs. Smith, a 6-foot
outside hitter, had 13 kills, a .500
percentage, seven digs and three blocks.
"Reno and Smith, statistically they
were awesome," Shaw said.
Junior outside hitter Amy Hayes also
continued her great weekend after a stan
dout performance against UCLA
Thursday. She had eight kills against the

Trojans and a .316 hitting percentage to
go along with 10 digs. "Amy had a good
weekend," Shaw said. "She's doing a
good job."
Game one was hack and forth until,
with the score 5-all, Stanford put together
a run. The Cardinal ran out to a 10-6 lead
before the Trojans rallied back to 10-all.
The Cardinal put a stop to the USC
rallies, however, and after two con
secutive kills by sophomore Lara Asper,
the home team led 14-10. The Trojans
fought off two game points, scoring twice
in the process, but a USC hitting error
ended game one on game point No. 3.
The second game involved less uncer
tainty as Stanford was in control through
out. The end came quickly this time, with
the Cardinal scoring points in bunches.
The final point was scored when Rush
blocked a USC overpass to the floor. In
the game, the Cardinal outhit the visitors
.370 to .079.
The third game was more of the same
— a display of how a good volleyball
team can be dominated by a great volley
ball team. USC did lead by a 9-7 score at
one point, but as in game one, the Cardi
nal went into high gear after starting out
behind early on. On match point. Rush
served, the Trojans passed, set and hit —
into the net. Game and match to Stan
ford.
Despite the Cardinal's lackluster per
formance against USC after the big win
the previous night vs. the Bruins, Shaw
said he was happy with what he saw
against the Trojans.
"Our blocking and defense did a good
job (against that offense)," he said. "I'm
really looking forward to the playoffs.
"We're going to learn as much as we
can about [Hawaii]," he said. "It's a
good preparation to play the best team in
the country two times."
Asper agreed, saying the team has
nothing to lose and could have a lot to
gain. "lt d be great if we could go over
there and have two really good matches
with them," she said. "It would boost
our confidence a great deal."
The first round of the NCAA playoffs
begins in two weeks. Stanford will in all
likelihood enter the West Regional and is
the favorite to be the top seed in a region
that will contain four of the nation's top
six teams (Stanford, UCLA, Brigham
Young and Colorado State).
The top seeding would give the Cardi
nal the home-floor advantage in the first
round match Dec. 3. The West Regional
tournament takes place the following
weekend at a site yet to be determined,
with Maples Pavilion as a distinct"pcMl* 1
bility.

Junior Amy Hayes, coming off a match-high 20-dig effort against UCLA Thursday, continued her hot play of late with another
fine performance against No. 13 USC Friday.
Card Notes
Stanford has won six consecutive
matches. Stanford has also won 20 of
its last 21, posting a 62-9 game record
in that time. The Cardinal completed
the year 9-0 at home in league play.
In the two-year history of the
women's Pac-10, the Cardinal is the
only team with a perfect record at
home (18-0).
The Cardinal is the only team to
have three Pac-10 Players of the
Week this year. Reno, Rush and
Smith have each won the award
once.
There will be a volleyball all-star
game this year, the first in recent
years. Yugo is sponsoring the East-
West Collegiate Volleyball Classic
Jan. 16 at Pacific.
It's a happy time of year for most Stan
ford students. Stanford beat California
31-7 in Big Game Saturday, midterms are
over with, and all but a few students now
have some time off before finals.
The Stanford women's volleyball team
finds itself in a similarly satisfying posi
tion. With a 15-12, 15-7, 15-9 victory over
USC at Maples Pavilion Friday night, the
Cardinal ended its Pacific 10 Conference
schedule with a 17-1 record.
Stanford next takes its 25-4 record and
No. 3 national ranking to Hawaii to face
the top-ranked Rainbow Wahines both
Wednesday and Friday nights in a pair of
non-conference contests. After those two
matches, the last on Stanford's regular
season slate, the Cardinal will have a
week off to prepare for the NCAA Cham
pionships, which begin Dec. 3.
Finishing up Pac-10 play with a 17-
match conference winning streak, the
Cardinal achieved its top goal this
season: winning the Pac-10 title. UCLA,
the runner-up to Stanford, has a 13-4 con
ference record with a match at USC
remaining on its schedule. USC finished
third at 12-5, 18-9 overall, followed by
Oregon (12-6) and California (10-6).
The Cardinal was not at top form for
the match Friday but still played well
enough to overwhelm the I3th-ranked
Trojans. "I don't think we were real
sharp," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"(But) when you're not playing your best
and you beat a good team ... I'm always
happy."
The match marked the final regular
season appearance at Maples for graduat
ing seniors Nancy Reno, Wendi Rush and
Teresa Smith. All three heavily contrib
uted in the win. Rush, who came in to the
weekend ranked second in the Pac-10 in
digging, had a team-high 13 digs, second
only to USC's Nancy Hillman's 17.
Rush also had another fine perform
ance running the Cardinal attack.
"Wendi did a good job running the of
fense," Shaw said. This was made clear
all night as Rush was continually able to
fool the Trojan blockers, often allowing
her teammates to hit unopposed.
Reno was the Cardinal's big gun in the
middle, tallying 15 kills and a .480 hitting
percentage. She also added a match-high
six blocks and 10 digs. Smith, a 6-foot
outside hitter, had 13 kills, a .500
percentage, seven digs and three blocks.
"Reno and Smith, statistically they
were awesome," Shaw said.
Junior outside hitter Amy Hayes also
continued her great weekend after a stan
dout performance against UCLA
Thursday. She had eight kills against the

Trojans and a .316 hitting percentage to
go along with 10 digs. "Amy had a good
weekend," Shaw said. "She's doing a
good job."
Game one was hack and forth until,
with the score 5-all, Stanford put together
a run. The Cardinal ran out to a 10-6 lead
before the Trojans rallied back to 10-all.
The Cardinal put a stop to the USC
rallies, however, and after two con
secutive kills by sophomore Lara Asper,
the home team led 14-10. The Trojans
fought off two game points, scoring twice
in the process, but a USC hitting error
ended game one on game point No. 3.
The second game involved less uncer
tainty as Stanford was in control through
out. The end came quickly this time, with
the Cardinal scoring points in bunches.
The final point was scored when Rush
blocked a USC overpass to the floor. In
the game, the Cardinal outhit the visitors
.370 to .079.
The third game was more of the same
— a display of how a good volleyball
team can be dominated by a great volley
ball team. USC did lead by a 9-7 score at
one point, but as in game one, the Cardi
nal went into high gear after starting out
behind early on. On match point. Rush
served, the Trojans passed, set and hit —
into the net. Game and match to Stan
ford.
Despite the Cardinal's lackluster per
formance against USC after the big win
the previous night vs. the Bruins, Shaw
said he was happy with what he saw
against the Trojans.
"Our blocking and defense did a good
job (against that offense)," he said. "I'm
really looking forward to the playoffs.
"We're going to learn as much as we
can about [Hawaii]," he said. "It's a
good preparation to play the best team in
the country two times."
Asper agreed, saying the team has
nothing to lose and could have a lot to
gain. "lt d be great if we could go over
there and have two really good matches
with them," she said. "It would boost
our confidence a great deal."
The first round of the NCAA playoffs
begins in two weeks. Stanford will in all
likelihood enter the West Regional and is
the favorite to be the top seed in a region
that will contain four of the nation's top
six teams (Stanford, UCLA, Brigham
Young and Colorado State).
The top seeding would give the Cardi
nal the home-floor advantage in the first
round match Dec. 3. The West Regional
tournament takes place the following
weekend at a site yet to be determined,
with Maples Pavilion as a distinct"pcMl* 1
