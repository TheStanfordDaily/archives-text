# Wrestling comes back to conquer UC-Davis
## 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
Stanford's wrestling team opened its
home season Friday at Maples Pavilion
with some surprising performances by
the younger wrestlers on the squad.
In helping the Cardinal rally for a 24-20
victory over UC-Davis, freshman Steve
Buddie pinned the Aggies' 167-pound
Kipp Magnussen. Buddie, competing in
his first collegiate match after taking over
senior Eric Harber's position, brought
home the fall late in the third period of his
match.
Sophomore Josh Lisle also recorded a
quick fall for the Cardinal in the 134-
pound match, bringing Stanford out of an
8-2 deficit created by a forfeit at the 118-
pound weight class.
Senior Terry Mclntyre, however,
surprised the Maples Pavilion crowd in a
less-than-positive manner. Coming off a
match last week at San Jose State in
which he had the only fall of the evening,
Mclntyre lost to the Aggies' Adam Cole
14-5.
In what may have been the most ag
gressive match of the day, sophomore
Ron Perry defeated Don Zeeman.
Perry, who was down several points in
the second period, pummeled Zeeman
until stall warnings against the Aggie gave
Perry a point. That pivotal call tiecl the
match at 5-5, which gave the 177-pound
Perry an added edge to finish off the third
period with a 7-6 victory.
"The younger guys wrestled much bet
ter this week," said Stanford Coach

Chris Horpel, who was obviously pleased
with his team's performance.
In some other close matches, freshman
Loren Vigil, wrestling at 126 pounds,
ended his match in a 1-1 tie. James
Dinette, another freshman, lost 16-8 in
the 142-pound weight class.

Sophomore Trent Smith out
wrestled an opponent who
outsized the 195-pound
Smith by over 30 pounds.
Smith scored three team
points and secured the Cardi
nal victory.

Sophomore Geoff Baum, wrestling in
the varsity 150-pound bracket after win
ning his challenge match this week
against freshman Jerome Farmer, lost a
difficult bout to Davis senior Todd Geerts
by a 16-6 score.
The meet came down to the
heavyweight class with Stanford leading
by a score of 21-20. A Davis victory in the
final bracket would have handed the Car
dinal a dual meet defeat.
Sophomore Trent Smith, heeding this
call, outwrestled an opponent who
outsized the 195-pound Smith by over 30
pounds. With his aggressive 4-0 triumph
over Davis' Chris Carlson, Smith scored
three team points and secured the Cardi
nal victory.
