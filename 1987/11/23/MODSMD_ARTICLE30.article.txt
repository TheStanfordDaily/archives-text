# Daily seizes Ink Bowl crown
## 
### Buck Montana Staff writer 
Senior quarterback Ken
"The Rifle" Stevens, coming
off a painful rotator cuff injury
from earlier in the season,
threw for one touchdown and
ran for another as The Stanford
Daily reclaimed the Exacto
Axe with a convincing 12-6 vic
tory over The Daily Californian
in the 91st Ink Bowl Saturday
morning at Roble Field.
The Daily squad used an in
tricate offense engineered by
Stevens and a stingy "flex"
defense led by veteran John
"The Legend" Lis to jump out
to an early lead and then turn
back a late Daily Cal rally to se
cure the win.
"It was brutal," Lis said
after the game.
"Lis was probably the key
for us," Daily coach and wide
receiver Matthew Bodman
said. "He's pretty much the
spark that lights our fire."
The game started out well for
The Daily, as junior cornerback
Russell "The Candidate"
Korobkin came up with an in
terception on the Daily Cal's
first play from scrimmage.
The Daily's offense sput
tered on its first drive, but
Stevens, his right shoulder
pumped with painkiller, was
able to connect with sopho
more wide receiver Sean "We
needed him on IMs" Kinch on
a 26-yard touchdown toss early
in the second quarter to put the
home team on the board.
The Daily defense, mean
while, was impermeable. Bar
rett "Ad side is good for some
thing after all" Hey wood and
Win "The Animal" Reis con
sistently invaded the pocket,
while Lis, Todd "Psycho"
Sitrin and a host of others kept
the secondary as tight as a
drum.
"Basically, we came to
play," Heywood said. "Win
(Reis) and I were stunting like
crazy, trying to get them out of
their rhythm and force them to
audibilize on the line. It was

pretty effective for most of the
first half."
But the defense broke down
late in the second quarter and
the Daily Cal scored on a 35-
yard bomb.
Lis, clearly the team's spiri
tual leader, upbraided the
defense during halftime, and
the offense did a bit of soul
searching of its own during the
intermission.
"We talked about a lot of
things during the half," senior
slotback Ken Fenyo said.
"Like what we were doing
after the game and whether we
should start drinking beers then
or wait until the game was
over."
Renewed in body and spirit
and led by the tenacious block
ing of senior offensive lineman
Bob "The Other Candidate"
Michitarian, The Daily came on
like gangbusters in the second
half. The gritty Michitarian
shook off a bloody nose to pro
vide Stevens with plenty of
time to throw.
The Daily got the break it
needed early in the third quar
ter when Sitrin made a leaping
interception deep in Daily Cal
territory. Stevens wasted no
time before scampering around
left end for the go-ahead score.
The conversion attempt
failed, however, and The Daily
clung to a tenuous 12-6 lead.
The defense continued to
hold the line for most of the
remainder of the game, and
Stevens repeatedly rescued the
offense from trouble with
booming punts that reminded
observers of Stevens' child
hood hero, Ray Guy.
"Yeah, 1 really worshipped
Guy when 1 was growing up,"
said Stevens, who punted six
times on the day for an average
of 67 yards per kick. "That's
why I was really psyched when
the Raiders came to L.A. But 1
used to practice punting a lot.
"My high school coach gave
me the key to the football
stadium so 1 could practice at

all hours. 1 guess 1 didn't have
much of a social life during high
school, but winning the Ink
Bowl makes it all worthwhile.
This is a lifelong dream come
true."
Stevens has been mentioned
as a prominent candidate for
the Heisman Trophy, awarded
annually to the most outstand
ing player in college football.
As the clock ran down in the
final quarter, the Daily Cal
mustered a final drive. They
drove deep into Daily territory,
but then, on fourth-and-goal
with two minutes left in the
game, a thunderous rush by
Heywood forced the Daily Cal
quarterback to hurry his throw.
It fell incomplete and The Daily
ran out the clock for the vic
tory.
The Exacto Axe Committee
then triumphantly reclaimed
the coveted blade, displaying it
with appropriate pomp and
pride. The Exacto Axe will be
stored in a bullet-proof, rein
forced concrete case in the
Daily office until next year's
Ink Bowl.
"This is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me in
my entire life," senior
wingback Chris Fialko gushed
after the game.
"This is the finest group of
young men I've ever worked
with," said the normally re
served Bodman, a disciple of
the legendary Paul "Bear"
Bryant.
Bodman has reportedly been
offered in the neighborhood of
six figures to take over the
coaching duties at the Harvard
Crimson next season, but he
said after the Ink Bowl that he
will not be lured away. "After
the performance my players
put in Saturday, there's no way
I could leave them now, even
though The Daily pay rates are
not all that adequate — some
might say downright abysmal.
The players mean too much to
me to leave. I'll never forget
this particular unit."

the Raiders came to L.A. But 1
used to practice punting a lot.
"My high school coach gave
me the key to the football
stadium so 1 could practice at

all hours. 1 guess 1 didn't have
much of a social life during high
school, but winning the Ink
Bowl makes it all worthwhile.
This is a lifelong dream come
true."

As the clock ran down in the
final quarter, the Daily Cal
mustered a final drive. They
drove deep into Daily territory,
but then, on fourth-and-goal
with two minutes left in the
game, a thunderous rush by
Heywood forced the Daily Cal
quarterback to hurry his throw.
It fell incomplete and The Daily
ran out the clock for the vic
tory.
The Exacto Axe Committee
then triumphantly reclaimed
the coveted blade, displaying it
with appropriate pomp and
pride. The Exacto Axe will be
stored in a bullet-proof, rein
forced concrete case in the
Daily office until next year's
Ink Bowl.
"This is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me in
my entire life," senior
wingback Chris Fialko gushed
after the game.
"This is the finest group of
young men I've ever worked
with," said the normally re
served Bodman, a disciple of
the legendary Paul "Bear"
Bryant.
Bodman has reportedly been
offered in the neighborhood of
six figures to take over the
coaching duties at the Harvard
Crimson next season, but he
said after the Ink Bowl that he
will not be lured away. "After
the performance my players
put in Saturday, there's no way
I could leave them now, even
though The Daily pay rates are
not all that adequate — some
might say downright abysmal.
The players mean too much to
me to leave. I'll never forget
this particular unit."
Senior quarterback Ken
"The Rifle" Stevens, coming
off a painful rotator cuff injury
from earlier in the season,
threw for one touchdown and
ran for another as The Stanford
Daily reclaimed the Exacto
Axe with a convincing 12-6 vic
tory over The Daily Californian
in the 91st Ink Bowl Saturday
morning at Roble Field.
The Daily squad used an in
tricate offense engineered by
Stevens and a stingy "flex"
defense led by veteran John
"The Legend" Lis to jump out
to an early lead and then turn
back a late Daily Cal rally to se
cure the win.
"It was brutal," Lis said
after the game.
"Lis was probably the key
for us," Daily coach and wide
receiver Matthew Bodman
said. "He's pretty much the
spark that lights our fire."
The game started out well for
The Daily, as junior cornerback
Russell "The Candidate"
Korobkin came up with an in
terception on the Daily Cal's
first play from scrimmage.
The Daily's offense sput
tered on its first drive, but
Stevens, his right shoulder
pumped with painkiller, was
able to connect with sopho
more wide receiver Sean "We
needed him on IMs" Kinch on
a 26-yard touchdown toss early
in the second quarter to put the
home team on the board.
The Daily defense, mean
while, was impermeable. Bar
rett "Ad side is good for some
thing after all" Hey wood and
Win "The Animal" Reis con
sistently invaded the pocket,
while Lis, Todd "Psycho"
Sitrin and a host of others kept
the secondary as tight as a
drum.
"Basically, we came to
play," Heywood said. "Win
(Reis) and I were stunting like
crazy, trying to get them out of
their rhythm and force them to
audibilize on the line. It was

pretty effective for most of the
first half."
But the defense broke down
late in the second quarter and
the Daily Cal scored on a 35-
yard bomb.
Lis, clearly the team's spiri
tual leader, upbraided the
defense during halftime, and
the offense did a bit of soul
searching of its own during the
intermission.
"We talked about a lot of
things during the half," senior
slotback Ken Fenyo said.
"Like what we were doing
after the game and whether we
should start drinking beers then
or wait until the game was
over."
Renewed in body and spirit
and led by the tenacious block
ing of senior offensive lineman
Bob "The Other Candidate"
Michitarian, The Daily came on
like gangbusters in the second
half. The gritty Michitarian
shook off a bloody nose to pro
vide Stevens with plenty of
time to throw.
The Daily got the break it
needed early in the third quar
ter when Sitrin made a leaping
interception deep in Daily Cal
territory. Stevens wasted no
time before scampering around
left end for the go-ahead score.
The conversion attempt
failed, however, and The Daily
clung to a tenuous 12-6 lead.
The defense continued to
hold the line for most of the
remainder of the game, and
Stevens repeatedly rescued the
offense from trouble with
booming punts that reminded
observers of Stevens' child
hood hero, Ray Guy.
"Yeah, 1 really worshipped
Guy when 1 was growing up,"
said Stevens, who punted six
times on the day for an average
of 67 yards per kick. "That's
why I was really psyched when
the Raiders came to L.A. But 1
used to practice punting a lot.
