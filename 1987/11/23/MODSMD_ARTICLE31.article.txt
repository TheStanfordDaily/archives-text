# Fencing outduels Bears
## 
### Mike Shay Staff writer 
The California fencing team
met the Stanford fencing team
Friday evening for the annual Big
Meet.
The Bears almost lost in fen
cing as badly as Cal did in the
football Big Game the next day.
The Card women's foil team
won 11-5, and the men's team
won the three weapons (epee,
sabre, foil) 18-9.
Big Meet started late Friday
because the Cal team was caught
in traffic. The Bears probably
would have been better off if they
had remained caught in the traffic
jam. Big Meet started 45 minutes
later than planned, and the Bears
stayed about 45 minutes behind
the whole match.
The men's team had very little
trouble beating the Bears by the
same score they had won by last
year. After the win Friday, the
men's team is 2-0 on the season.

The women's team, as had
been originally planned, started
Alexandra Rankin and Elisabeth
Spillnian. Each went 3-1, not
quite as planned. Stanford
women's Coach Sherry Pos
thumus had planned on both
players winning all four bouts.
The idea was to reduce pressure
on the more inexperienced fen
cers.
The four new fencers following
Spillman and Rankin, however,
didn't mind the pressure. They
went on to win more than enough
touches to take the match.
Vanessa Southern, Toni Nic
hols, Laurel Mend and Grace
Chang all fought their first bouts
Friday. Between the four fencers
they won five and lost only three.
"Vanessa and Toni are both
tall," Posthumus said. "It makes
a big difference — they have the
advantage."
A taller fencer has a greater
reach against shorter competi

tors. For a short fencer to do well
against a tall one, she must be
fast and aggressive. She has to
move in fast, make her touch and
retreat quickly.
"Laurel and Grace are both
short, but they are fiesty. They
are real fighters," Posthumus
said.
Stanford's next meet is Dec. 4-
5 at Northwestern in Evanston,
111. The Cardinal will take on
Notre Dame, St. Mary s, Wis
consin, Illinois, Minnesota,
Lawrence (Mich.) College, the
University of Chicago and Michi
gan State. Only a limited number
of Cardinal fencers will make the
trip.
According to Posthumus,
trying to decide which five of her
nine fencers to take to Illinois is a
difficult decision.
"If I could just put the right
combination together we could
do quite well (in the tourna
ment)," Posthumus said.
