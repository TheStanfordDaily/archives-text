# Knight apologizes for incident

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — In
diana Coach Bob Knight,
embroiled in another incident
caused by his uncontrollable
temper, admitted he was wrong
in ordering his team to forfeit its
exhibition basketball game to the
Soviet Union.
Knight pulled the Hoosiers off
the floor with 15:05 remaining in
Saturday's game after he was
ejected following his third techni
cal foul.
"I apologize to our fans for
what should have been a good
evening. . . a chance to see our
players play," Knight said in
remarks taped after the game.
The show was to be broadcast
by WTTV and other Indiana sta
tions last night. Knight allowed
Bob Hainmel, sports editor of
The Herald-Telephone in
Bloomington, to attend the
taping. Hammers report on the
program was published in yester
day's editions of the newspaper.
The Soviets, helped by six free
throws following the three
technicals against Knight, were

leading 66-43 when the Hoosiers
followed their coach into the
dressing room. Knight refused to
be interviewed after the game or
make his players available for in
terviews. The Soviet team and
coach also declined comment.
"I had said publicly that win
ning the game wasn't important
to me," Knight said during his
show. "I didn't think it was a
game we could have won under
any circumstances. I think the
Russians played much better
than we did.
"As far as taking the team off
the floor — there are things 1
wish I could do over again. That
is one of them. "
Knight, convicted of hitting a
Puerto Rico police officer during
an incident at the 1979 Pan Amer
ican Games and disciplined after
throwing a chair onto the floor at
a Purdue-Indiana game during
the 1984-85 season, explained
that the latest incident began
over a dispute involving a rule in
terpretation.
"I'm not sure that even people

who saw it (the incident) would
understand, hut I'll he glad to try
to explain," Knight said. "I
don't think 1 was right in what I
did."
Knight, who coached the U.S.
men s basketball team to a gold
medal in the 1984 Olympics,
which the Soviets boycotted,
said last week that he didn't un
derstand why U.S. officials "can
let them (the Soviets) use this
(U.S. tour) as a training ground
when we're going to have to play
them next year in Seoul (in the
Olympics)."
Indiana, the defending NCAA
champion, trailed the entire game
but rallied from 13 points back to
within five early in the second
half.
I he Soviets outscored Indiana
20-2 after that, including 11 free
throws by Sharunas Marchulenis
— with six following the three
technicals.
After the third technical,
Knight said that if he had to go,
so would his team.
