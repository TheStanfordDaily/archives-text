## Didion explores 'New Havana' in 'Miami'

-Miami"

Simon and Schuster, New York
$17.95
Joan Didion's new book, "Miami," is
one of those non-fiction works that
demonstrates how closely life imitates
art — how sociological facts, historical
events and the actions of real people in
international politics too accurately
resemble the wild imaginings of Holly
wood scriptwriters.
A real-life history, it is a compilation
and expansion of a series of reports writ
ten in Didion's evocative and personal
journalistic prose and first published in
The New York Review of Books, May-
July 1987.
"Miami" is a contemporary history of
a place, a people and a loose weave of
facts that offers the reader perspective
on the potential consequences of Wash
ington's 30 years of confused foreign
policy in its own hemisphere.
Didion points to the city of Miami as a
harbinger in the game of U.S. interna
tional politics — as it was, is and will be
played in the Caribbean, Central
America and South America. It is, she
asserts, a ". . . tropical capital: long on
rumor, short on memory, one built on
the chimera of runaway money. . . part
of the Cuban stage where declamatory
exits are made, and side deals."
"Miami" offers readers insight into
certain clandestine activities urged by
the CIA, such as a Howard Johnson's in
Miami that advertised $ 17-per-night
"guerrilla discounts" and served as a
CIA headquarters for weapons flights to

Nicaragua. It is a litany of use and abuse
of Cuban exiles by Washington, the CIA
and interests in the military and private
sectors. Its cacaphony of detail provides
sufficient motivation and a believable
context for a myriad of guerrilla and ter
rorist actions throughout not only
Central and South America but also a
number of North American cities.
Such a marriage between Washington
and convicted and/or alleged terrorists
seems all the more unholy for the fact
that the CIA and the American military
trained these men for their work — as
Bay of Pigs guerrilla fighters who, as a
result of Washington's betrayal, never
reached Cuba's shores.

Didion treads the ground of
primary history . . . [using|
her first-hand experience of
places, people and events.

Didion depicts Miami's intimacy with
Washington through a history of the im
passioned sentiments and resentments
(toward the U.S. and Castro regimes) of
the "el exilio," the displaced Cuban
Right (and its younger, more liberal, or
"progressive," counterparts), through
an examination of the nearly impassable
gap between Miami's Cuban and Anglo
communities (a gap not successfully
spanned, even by the Miami Herald) and
its consequences in Miami's mayoral
politics. She also illuminates the connec
tions between the Cuban exiles' dissatis
faction with President John Kennedy's
waffling policies and his assassination.

and between the Bay of Pigs and the
Keagan administration's U.S. involve
ment in Nicaragua.
Among the names that surface in this
book are Lt. Col. Oliver North, Ken
nedy and President Ronald Reagan,
Batista and Anastasio Somoza, Ramon
Medina and Lee Harvey Oswald.
In a nutshell, "Miami" is a commen
tary on a bumper sticker/poster popular
in Miami: Nicaragua Hoy: Cuba
Manana!
In "Miami", as with "Salvador" and
"The White Papers," Didion treads the
ground of primary history, mixing re
search of contemporary documents and
historical events with her first-hand ex
perience of places, people and events.
Like any historian, she has her bias;
thankfully it tends toward issues of
human nature rather than ideologies.
She remains, however, loyal to the no
tion that a few passionate 1960s liberals,
North American "progressives," may
still exist and, flatteringly, sets their con
victions and their battles alongside "la
lucha," the struggle of the Latin
peoples.
Despite her distinctly personal vision,
however, Didion remains a journalist,
not an ideologue; she emphasizes the at
mosphere of Miami, respects the senti
ments of its inhabitants, recognizes the
difference between the fevered alle
giance to "patria" (among Latin
Americans) and the empty rhetoric of
Washington bureaucrats. She expertly
weaves these and a multitude of
seemingly innocuous details into a fabric
that provides the backdrop for larger ac
tion, namely a discussion of major his
torical events and the clues to the moti

vations of minor and lead players in
American international politics.
In Didion's vision of U.S.-Latin
American relations. Washington, preoc
cupied with domestic power, engages in
a media show of mirrors while South
Florida waits in the wings — empas
sioned and angry, a foothold on the
North American continent of what lies
to the south and in the future.
"Miami" is somewhat heavy reading
by virtue of its factual content. It is, at
worst, informative, strewn with dates.

names, reportage, pinned down with
"Notes" and "Index." Didion's style,
however, remains engaging — complex,
evocative and tinged with her personal,
very human vision.
The book is controversial at the least,
a must-read for students of international
relations and Latin American studies. It
is a should-read for anyone concerned
about U.S. political and military in
volvement in arenas so close to home, as
well as — if we pay heed to Didion — in
our own Miami, the "New Havana."

-Miami"
Bv Joan Didion
Simon and Schuster, New York
$17.95
Joan Didion's new book, "Miami," is
one of those non-fiction works that
demonstrates how closely life imitates
art — how sociological facts, historical
events and the actions of real people in
international politics too accurately
resemble the wild imaginings of Holly
wood scriptwriters.
A real-life history, it is a compilation
and expansion of a series of reports writ
ten in Didion's evocative and personal
journalistic prose and first published in
The New York Review of Books, May-
July 1987.
"Miami" is a contemporary history of
a place, a people and a loose weave of
facts that offers the reader perspective
on the potential consequences of Wash
ington's 30 years of confused foreign
policy in its own hemisphere.
Didion points to the city of Miami as a
harbinger in the game of U.S. interna
tional politics — as it was, is and will be
played in the Caribbean, Central
America and South America. It is, she
asserts, a ". . . tropical capital: long on
rumor, short on memory, one built on
the chimera of runaway money. . . part
of the Cuban stage where declamatory
exits are made, and side deals."
"Miami" offers readers insight into
certain clandestine activities urged by
the CIA, such as a Howard Johnson's in
Miami that advertised $ 17-per-night
"guerrilla discounts" and served as a
CIA headquarters for weapons flights to

Nicaragua. It is a litany of use and abuse
of Cuban exiles by Washington, the CIA
and interests in the military and private
sectors. Its cacaphony of detail provides
sufficient motivation and a believable
context for a myriad of guerrilla and ter
rorist actions throughout not only
Central and South America but also a
number of North American cities.
Such a marriage between Washington
and convicted and/or alleged terrorists
seems all the more unholy for the fact
that the CIA and the American military
trained these men for their work — as
Bay of Pigs guerrilla fighters who, as a
result of Washington's betrayal, never
reached Cuba's shores.

Didion treads the ground of
primary history . . . [using|
her first-hand experience of
places, people and events.

Didion depicts Miami's intimacy with
Washington through a history of the im
passioned sentiments and resentments
(toward the U.S. and Castro regimes) of
the "el exilio," the displaced Cuban
Right (and its younger, more liberal, or
"progressive," counterparts), through
an examination of the nearly impassable
gap between Miami's Cuban and Anglo
communities (a gap not successfully
spanned, even by the Miami Herald) and
its consequences in Miami's mayoral
politics. She also illuminates the connec
tions between the Cuban exiles' dissatis
faction with President John Kennedy's
waffling policies and his assassination.

and between the Bay of Pigs and the
Keagan administration's U.S. involve
ment in Nicaragua.
Among the names that surface in this
book are Lt. Col. Oliver North, Ken
nedy and President Ronald Reagan,
Batista and Anastasio Somoza, Ramon
Medina and Lee Harvey Oswald.
In a nutshell, "Miami" is a commen
tary on a bumper sticker/poster popular
in Miami: Nicaragua Hoy: Cuba
Manana!
In "Miami", as with "Salvador" and
"The White Papers," Didion treads the
ground of primary history, mixing re
search of contemporary documents and
historical events with her first-hand ex
perience of places, people and events.
Like any historian, she has her bias;
thankfully it tends toward issues of
human nature rather than ideologies.
She remains, however, loyal to the no
tion that a few passionate 1960s liberals,
North American "progressives," may
still exist and, flatteringly, sets their con
victions and their battles alongside "la
lucha," the struggle of the Latin
peoples.
Despite her distinctly personal vision,
however, Didion remains a journalist,
not an ideologue; she emphasizes the at
mosphere of Miami, respects the senti
ments of its inhabitants, recognizes the
difference between the fevered alle
giance to "patria" (among Latin
Americans) and the empty rhetoric of
Washington bureaucrats. She expertly
weaves these and a multitude of
seemingly innocuous details into a fabric
that provides the backdrop for larger ac
tion, namely a discussion of major his
