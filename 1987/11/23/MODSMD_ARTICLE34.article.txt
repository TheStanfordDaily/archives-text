# Multicultural Council demands criticized
## Federalists charge 'abject silliness' 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
A group of conservative and
libertarian law students ridiculed
recent affirmative action pro
posals by the Multicultural Coun
cil Friday, calling them "abject
silliness."
Responding to the council's
demand for concrete minority
faculty hiring goals, Stanford
Federalist Society President and
third-year law student David
Cavicke said, "We should be
focusing on quality of instruc
tion, not on the race or gender of
the instructor."
Shelley Winters, a member of
the Multicultural Council,
responded, "It's ridiculous to
assume we can't have both
minority representation and
quality of scholarship as top
priorites."
John Reynen, vice-president of
the society, shared Winters' con
cerns yesterday."The school is
certainly within its prerogative to
look actively for minorities,"
said Reynen. "Ideally, all groups
should be represented in our fac
ulty according to the percentages
they account for in society."

Reynen noted a "large" dis
crepancy between the percentage
of women and minorities in the
student population of the Law
School and the percentage of
female and minority representa
tion in the faculty.
He predicted along with
Cavicke, however, that leveling
of these discrepancies would oc
cur only gradually, as the current
generation of students enters the
teaching profession, not through
the establishment of artificial
hiring quotas.
Current student enrollment at
the school is 43 percent female
and 35 percent minority, while
women and minority faculty
members constitute 12 percent of
the faculty each.
Reynen also discounted the
Multicultural Council's recent
claims that homophobia is a
problem at the Law School.
Winters, who is chair of the
Gay and Lesbian Law Students
Association, bristled at this.
"We've gotten the Law School,
to its credit, to offer a course in
sexual orientation," said
Winters. "But it's a shame we
need a special course."
