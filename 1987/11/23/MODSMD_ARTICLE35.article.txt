# Governor says U.S. can compete abroad
## 
### Haru Connolly Senior staff writer 
The United States can effectively compete
in world markets "if we can educate and if we
try," New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean told a
Business School audience here Friday.
Kean, a second-term Republican credited
with turning around his state's troubled eco
nomy with tax increases and budget cuts, is a
rising national figure recently named by
Newsweek magazine as "one of the five most
effective governors" in the United States.
Kean stressed the importance of having ed
ucated, skilled workers to increase American
competitiveness. "We need them to not only
read and write, but to also understand what
they read and write," he said.
Noting there are 17 million functionally il
literate people in the United States. Kean
stressed the need for improving education.
"When we fail at educating our kids, industry
pays the price," he said.
According to Kean, American businesses
pay $25 billion each year for remedial educa
tion for employees, which is half the amount
budgeted for research and development. He
also predicted that four out of five jobs in the
future will require education beyond the high
school level.

"We need to stop tinkering around the
edges," Kean said. "Schools are only as
good as the teachers, and we need to reward
them and get new talent into the classroom."
Kean also said schools should be able to
compete in a free market for the best teach
ers, who "should get between $70,(KM) and
$80,(KM) a year."
According to Kean. increasing teachers'
accountability for students' knowledge is cru
cial. Noting that under the current educa
tional system, there is no penalty for teachers
who year after year turn out students who
cannot read or write, he said, "We need to
face them with higher standards."
He added that Americans' lack of educa
tion in foreign languages hampers competi
tiveness in business abroad. "It is most obvi
ous that our lack of competition lies in our
refusal to learn foreign languages.
"At Samsung (a Korean company), to be
promoted one needs to know three lan
guages," Kean said.
U.S. companies send people overseas "all
the time" who can speak only English, he
said. "American competitors send young ex
ecutives to Seoul, Tokyo and Hong Kong to
stay for only two or three years, while Britain
sends them for seven or eight years," he said.
"We need to make a commitment to sell

American products abroad, he added.
According to Kean, America also lacks the
individualism, creativity and spirit of entre
preneurship that is strong in Korea. "That
creative genius is lacking in many corporate
leaders" in the United States, he said.
"These people (Koreans) are not just com
peting to build a company, but to build a na
tion," Kean said. Meeting Korean business
leaders on a recent trip to Korea "was like
going back in history, meeting men like
Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon, he
said.
Kean also cautioned against protecting
U.S. markets. "Tariffs are like a narcotic,"
he said. "They make you feel good in the
near term, but in the long term, they are dis
astrous.
"America must not erect high trade bar
riers and bury our heads in tariffs," Kean
said. "Korea is loosening its trade restric
tions, and Japan is too, only more slowly."
New Jersey, Kean said, is giving small- and
medium-sized companies state grants and
loans to explore export opportunities.
"There are potential built-in costs involved
they (companies) can t foresee," he said,
citing the potential incompatibility of Ameri
can electrical components with foreign
voltage.
