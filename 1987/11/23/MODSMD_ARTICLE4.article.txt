# Law dean apologizes to ex-visiting prof.
## Brest speaks at anti-discrimination forum 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Suggesting that the Law School had
been given "a unique opportunity for in
trospection," Law School Dean Paul
Brest publicly apologized to black former
visiting Prof. Derrick Bell Friday before a
crowd of over 200 students and faculty at
the Law School.
Greeted with a standing ovation in his
first Stanford appearance since 1986,
when he left here in anger following a
dispute with Law School administrators
over allegedly racist treatment, Bell said
he was ' humbled" by his warm recep
tion.
In the spring of 1986, Bell's course on
constitutional law was compromised by a
proposed series of supplementary
lectures organized without his knowledge
by Law School administrators acting on
students' complaints. Critics said his
course focused too much on perceived
racism in the Constitution, and that sup
plementary lectures were necessary to
provide students with a more traditional
interpretation. The supplementary
lectures were cancelled after protest by
the Black Law Students' Association.
I he occasion for Brest's apology was a
forum called by Brest and the Multicul
tural Council — a coalition of women,
minority, gay and lesbian law students —
to discuss possible solutions to questions
of racism raised by the treatment Bell
received here.
"You were able to take a situation in
which 1 was the vehicle, at best, and
make a real opportunity to move this law
school in the direction that all law schools

and all education will eventually have to
go," said Bell, a tenured professor of law
at Harvard, who lectured later in the day
on his new book, "And We Are Not
Saved."
Brest read a prepared statement in
which he acknowledged for the first time
the "institutional responsibility" borne
by the entire Law School for the Bell inci
dent. which occurred while Law Prof.
John Fly was dean.
Brest also partially agreed to demands
raised last week by the Multicultural
Council, which called for concrete action
in affirmative action for minority faculty
hiring and speedy implementation of an
enforcement procedure for the non
discrimination policy.
Heated discussion followed Brest's as
sertion that he could only commit to an
"imaginative, aggressive" search for
more minority faculty, "and not to partic
ular results.
"We have some particular needs to fill
— most desperately in corporate law, tax
and bankruptcy. These fields have not at
tracted minority and women law teachers
to nearly the same extent as certain other
areas where our needs are not as strong,"
said Brest, referring to the school's
strength in constitutional law.
Brest also agreed to the Multicultural
Council's call for implementation, by
February at the latest, of a new non
discrimination enforcement procedure.
After Brest spoke, second-year law
student Laura Allan of the Multicultural
Council read a statement lauding Brest's
affirmative principles but criticizing his
rejection of concrete hiring goals.
Allan proposed filling four of
six currently open positions with
women and minorities and re
quiring that every first-year stu
dent be taught by one minority
and one female faculty member.
"Only a formula will guarantee
that the composition of the Law
School's faculty will no longer

reflect institutional racism," Al
lan said.
The number of minority fac
ulty at the Law School became a
contentious issue in the wake of
the Bell incident. The Multicul
tural Council has charged that
Bell would not have been under
cut if the faculty had had more
minority members.
Of 43 Law School faculty
members, five are women, two
are black, two are Latinos and
one, a visiting professor, is
Asian-American.
