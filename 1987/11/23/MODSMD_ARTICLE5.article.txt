# NCAA decision
## Athletic directors disagree on ruling 
### Chris Crader Editorial stall 
Athletic directors across the
country disagreed widely over this
weekend about the practical impact
that Thursday's ruling granting two
Stanford athletes an injunction
against NCAA drug testing will have
on collegiate anti-drug programs
state and nationwide.
While some athletic directors
predicted the ruling will encourage
similar suits across the country,
others downplayed this and said the
decision would not siunificantlv af

others predicted an increase in ath
letes' drug use stemming from the
ruling.
"It's sure going to cause (the
NCAA| to step back a hit," Univer

similar suit. "1 would imagine,
sooner or later, that's what's going to
happen."
Distressed by the ruling, Cobb said
he feared uninformed athletes would
be more likely to abuse illegal and
potentially dangerous substances if
there was no one monitoring them.
"Unless the ACLU (American Civil
Liberties Union) can find a better
way to control I the drug problem. |
we'll have more cases like (Don!
Rogers (and Len) Bias. . .
Rogers was a member of the

Cleveland Browns football team who
died in the summer of 1986 of heart
failure resulting from an overdose of
cocaine. Bias was the Boston Cel
tics' 1986 first-round draft choice
from Maryland. He also died of a
cocaine overdose in June 1986.
Athletic directors at other schools
said they don't expect the decision to
affect them in any way. Bngham
Young University Athletic Director
Cilen Tuckett, who supports the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association
program, said BYU implemented its
