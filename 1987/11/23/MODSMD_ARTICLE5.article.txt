# NCAA decision
## Athletic directors disagree on ruling 
### Chris Crader Editorial stall 
Athletic directors across the
country disagreed widely over this
weekend about the practical impact
that Thursday's ruling granting two
Stanford athletes an injunction
against NCAA drug testing will have
on collegiate anti-drug programs
state and nationwide.
While some athletic directors
predicted the ruling will encourage
similar suits across the country,
others downplayed this and said the
decision would not siunificantlv af

feet colleges' testing programs. Still
others predicted an increase in ath
letes' drug use stemming from the
ruling.
"It's sure going to cause (the
NCAA| to step back a hit," Univer
sity of the Pacific Associate Athletic
Director Tom Stuhbs said, ack
nowledging however that he did not
think it would cause the NCAA to
halt drug testing entirely.
Marvin Cobb, an assistant athletic
director at the University of South
ern California, disagreed. "Ob
viously, it's going to be a barrier to
the NCAA's doing what they in

tended." he said, adding it would be
naive to assume others won't file a
similar suit. "1 would imagine,
sooner or later, that's what's going to
happen."
Distressed by the ruling, Cobb said
he feared uninformed athletes would
be more likely to abuse illegal and
potentially dangerous substances if
there was no one monitoring them.
"Unless the ACLU (American Civil
Liberties Union) can find a better
way to control I the drug problem. |
we'll have more cases like (Don!
Rogers (and Len) Bias. . .
Rogers was a member of the

Cleveland Browns football team who
died in the summer of 1986 of heart
failure resulting from an overdose of
cocaine. Bias was the Boston Cel
tics' 1986 first-round draft choice
from Maryland. He also died of a
cocaine overdose in June 1986.
Athletic directors at other schools
said they don't expect the decision to
affect them in any way. Bngham
Young University Athletic Director
Cilen Tuckett, who supports the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association
program, said BYU implemented its
own independent testing and ed
ucation program three years ago.
"It's a great way to educate
our athletes," he said. "We are
doing it voluntarily, and we like
it."
While other students may seek
protection from the NCAA's
mandatory drug testing, Cobb
feels the program will not disap
pear. "For the time being, we're
going to continue with our pro
gram (the NCAA's testing at
USC)," he said. "We do think
[the evidence of danger for drug
users] is an important enough
case that our student athletes
should be involved in such a pro
gram. There are different ways of
implementing a drug-testing pro
gram without going against the

ACLU's view of the Constitu
tion."
Stubbs said Pacific will also
continue testing. "The Univer
sity of the Pacific is probably in
favor of mandatory drug test
ing," he said. "None of our ath
letes who signed the consent
form have said anything about it.
1 don't anticipate any lawsuits."
Another proponent of drug ed
ucation programs is UC-Ber
keley water polo coach Pete
Cutino, whose team is currently
ranked No. I in the nation. "I be
lieve in mandatory drug educa
tion," he said.
"I think drugs are truly in
sidious," he added. "I think the
first thing that should be done is
(to establish) a drug education
program in the schools."
Cutino, whose team will be
tested during the NCAA cham
pionships in Long Beach this
weekend, doesn't believe the ex

ception granted to Stanford stu
dents will make much of a differ
ence in the actual competition,
however. "1 don't think (drug
abuse] is a problem in our sport.
We may be tested and Stanford's
not; that doesn't bother me. That
doesn't bother me in my sport."
He said he had mixed feelings
about mandatory testing, but
added that he understood the
NCAA's predicament.
"I firmly believe in the consti
tutional individual rights," he
said. "I had to tell the truth (in a
team meeting last year). We are
voluntarily in the NCAA â€” if
you don't like the rules, you can
pull out."
The Stanford suit may affect
two other cases currently pend
ing. David Bally, a senior at
Northeastern University in Bos
ton, has filed suit in Massachu
setts Superior Court against
Northeastern's year old indepen

dent testing and education pro
gram. A decision is expected at
any time.
Bally and a lawyer provided by
the ACLU, David Casey, asked
the Massachusetts Supreme
Court for an injuction allowing
Bally to compete without signing
a drug test consent form. An
NCAA rule requires athletes to
sign consent forms obligating
them to submit to drug tests, if
selected for testing, before par
ticipating in postseason competi
tion.
The injuction was denied and
the case was sent down to the su
perior court. A hearing was held
several weeks ago, but no deci
sion has yet been announced.
Even after learning of the ruling
here, Irwin Cohen, the North
eastern athletic director, said his
school's program "will be found
constitutional," though it may go
to the state Supreme Court.
