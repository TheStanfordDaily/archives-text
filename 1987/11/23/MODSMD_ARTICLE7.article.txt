Shultz offers inspection concession
GENEVA — Secretary of State George Shultz said yesterday
the United States will offer the Soviet Union on-site inspection
rights at a U.S. missile facility as part of an effort to strike the
final bargain today and tomorrow on an arms control treaty to
be signed at the Washington summit conference.
Speaking to reporters during his flight here for wrap-up
meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in
Geneva, Shultz said the negotiators on both sides appear to be
coming to the showdown sessions with both the intention and
the authority to resolve remaining issues in the way of comple
tion of the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) treaty.
"We expect and they expect to have the treaty concluded so
it can be signed at the summit meeting," which is scheduled to
bring Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to Washington Dec. 7,
said Shultz. "That's an essential ingredient, and we'll finish it,"
he said.
Shevardnadze arrived in Geneva shortly before Shultz and
said he "thinks and expects" that the treaty can be concluded
for signing at the summit. However, he cautioned that "difficult
(and) very sensitive issues" remain to be decided in the next
two days.
Shultz and members of his delegation, which includes Presi
dent Reagan's newly chosen national security adviser, Lt. Gen.
Colin Powell, were encouraged by the promised presence in the
Soviet delegation of Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, chief of staff
of the Soviet armed forces and a figure of great authority.
U.S. increases contra shipments
WASHINGTON — Even as the contras prepare for cease-fire
negotiations with the Nicaraguan government, the United States
has accelerated its shipment of military supplies to the rebels,
ensuring that they can continue to fight well into next year, ac
cording to administration and congressional sources.
"The troops are fighting. They are not leaving. They are not
quitting," said a State Department official who briefed reporters
last week. "They have more supplies than they've ever had
before."
The upsurge in U.S. military support to the contras inside
Nicaragua comes in striking contrast to the perception in
Congress that activity would wane with the expiration of $100
million in contra aid in September, coupled with the refusal of
Congress to consider more military assistance in the face of a
Central American peace plan.
While President Reagan has given lukewarm endorsement to
the regional peace process, he has said he wants to keep the
rebels supplied until "full democracy" is in place in Nicaragua.
Congressional experts said the weapons and equipment now
being delivered were paid for out of the $100-million contra aid
package for 1986, which included $70 million in military assis
tance.
They attributed the lag to the ClA's slow start last year in
resuming military aid to the contras after a two-year congres
sional cutoff. Deliveries did not resume until December, more
than a month after contra aid received final passage.
Iran fires on Greek tanker in Gulf
TEHRAN, Iran (DPA) — An Iranian gunboat early yesterday
damaged a Greek tanker headed for Saudi Arabia as Iran
boasted that the U.S. Navy a few hours earlier had "chickened
out" of helping another Greek vessel commandeered by its Is
lamic Navy.
Independent shipping sources in the Persian Gulf said that the
hull of the tanker Andromeda was severely damage in the early
morning attack but that there were no casualties.
The 63,953-ton vessel, sailing from Singapore to Saudi
Arabia, was attacked near the United Arab Emirate island of Sir
Aby Nu'ayr. The ship was heading to the Dubai dry dock for re
pairs.
Iran claimed, meanwhile, that its naval units had stalled an at
tempt by two U.S. warships and four helicopters to help the
Greek freighter Jimilta, which according to independent ship
ping sources had been forced under fire to drop anchor at the
fortified upper Gulf Iranian island of Farsi Saturday.
"The U.S. force fled the scene after our naval units opened
fire on the helicopters," said a report broadcast over Tehran
Radio.
The U.S. Navy made no comment on the Iranian report, but
announced that it had detonated two more mines off Farsi Is
land.
Crash leaves lawsuits in its wake
DENVER — Millions of dollars will be at stake for Continen
tal Airlines and victims of doomed Flight 1713 when lawsuits
stemming from the Denver air crash begin to hit courts around
the country, possibly as early as this week, according to legal
experts.
San Francisco lawyer Melvin Belli is expected to file suit this
week on behalf of an unnamed Idaho survivor of the Nov. 15
crash at Stapleton Airport that killed 28 people.
Belli's firm has declined to say where it will file or whom it
will sue, but few doubt that Belli, renowned for quick action in
personal injury cases, will be among the earliest to file a Flight
1713 suit.
The first filings will begin what could become years of litiga
tion in state and federal courts in Colorado, the crash site;
Texas, corporate headquarters of Continental; and Idaho, home
to most of Flight 1713's passengers
The compensation eventually paid to crash survivors and vic
tims' relatives may average more than $500,000 a claim and
could reach as high as $1.5 million a claim — the range for typi
cal court awards in recent air crashes, according to studies by
HALT, a Washington-based legal reform group.
That means that defendants in the Flight 1713 case could pay
anywhere from $40 million to more than $100 million in dam
ages.
Pope beatifies 85 British martyrs
VATICAN CITY (DPA) — In the presence of the Anglican
bishop of Birmingham, Mark Santer, and 2500 British pilgrims,
Pope John Paul II yesterday beatified 85 British martyrs who
were tortured and executed during the time of the Reformation.
The 63 Catholic priests and 22 lay members of the Catholic
church were from all parts of Britain and included one Scot and
six Welshmen.
Nearly all were hanged, drawn and quartered during the reign
of Queen Elizabeth I, who isolated the Catholic community with
a series of repressive laws. After she was excommunicated by
Pope Pius V, official persecution of Catholic missionaries
became.particularly savage.
The beatification of the 85 martyrs with Santer present was
seen as another step toward bridging the gap between the Catho
lic and the Anglican church. Beatification is the last stage before
canonization.

coming to the showdown sessions with both the intention and
the authority to resolve remaining issues in the way of comple
tion of the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) treaty.
"We expect and they expect to have the treaty concluded so
it can be signed at the summit meeting," which is scheduled to
bring Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to Washington Dec. 7,
said Shultz. "That's an essential ingredient, and we'll finish it,"
he said.
Shevardnadze arrived in Geneva shortly before Shultz and
said he "thinks and expects" that the treaty can be concluded
for signing at the summit. However, he cautioned that "difficult
(and) very sensitive issues" remain to be decided in the next
two days.
Shultz and members of his delegation, which includes Presi
dent Reagan's newly chosen national security adviser, Lt. Gen.
Colin Powell, were encouraged by the promised presence in the
Soviet delegation of Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, chief of staff
of the Soviet armed forces and a figure of great authority.
U.S. increases contra shipments
WASHINGTON — Even as the contras prepare for cease-fire
negotiations with the Nicaraguan government, the United States
has accelerated its shipment of military supplies to the rebels,
ensuring that they can continue to fight well into next year, ac
cording to administration and congressional sources.
"The troops are fighting. They are not leaving. They are not
quitting," said a State Department official who briefed reporters
last week. "They have more supplies than they've ever had
before."
The upsurge in U.S. military support to the contras inside
Nicaragua comes in striking contrast to the perception in
Congress that activity would wane with the expiration of $100
million in contra aid in September, coupled with the refusal of
Congress to consider more military assistance in the face of a
Central American peace plan.
While President Reagan has given lukewarm endorsement to
the regional peace process, he has said he wants to keep the
rebels supplied until "full democracy" is in place in Nicaragua.
Congressional experts said the weapons and equipment now
being delivered were paid for out of the $100-million contra aid
package for 1986, which included $70 million in military assis
tance.
They attributed the lag to the ClA's slow start last year in
resuming military aid to the contras after a two-year congres
sional cutoff. Deliveries did not resume until December, more
than a month after contra aid received final passage.
Iran fires on Greek tanker in Gulf
TEHRAN, Iran (DPA) — An Iranian gunboat early yesterday
damaged a Greek tanker headed for Saudi Arabia as Iran
boasted that the U.S. Navy a few hours earlier had "chickened
out" of helping another Greek vessel commandeered by its Is
lamic Navy.
Independent shipping sources in the Persian Gulf said that the
hull of the tanker Andromeda was severely damage in the early
morning attack but that there were no casualties.
The 63,953-ton vessel, sailing from Singapore to Saudi
Arabia, was attacked near the United Arab Emirate island of Sir
Aby Nu'ayr. The ship was heading to the Dubai dry dock for re
pairs.
Iran claimed, meanwhile, that its naval units had stalled an at
tempt by two U.S. warships and four helicopters to help the
Greek freighter Jimilta, which according to independent ship
ping sources had been forced under fire to drop anchor at the
fortified upper Gulf Iranian island of Farsi Saturday.
"The U.S. force fled the scene after our naval units opened
fire on the helicopters," said a report broadcast over Tehran
Radio.
The U.S. Navy made no comment on the Iranian report, but
announced that it had detonated two more mines off Farsi Is
land.
Crash leaves lawsuits in its wake
DENVER — Millions of dollars will be at stake for Continen
tal Airlines and victims of doomed Flight 1713 when lawsuits
stemming from the Denver air crash begin to hit courts around
the country, possibly as early as this week, according to legal
experts.
San Francisco lawyer Melvin Belli is expected to file suit this
week on behalf of an unnamed Idaho survivor of the Nov. 15
crash at Stapleton Airport that killed 28 people.
Belli's firm has declined to say where it will file or whom it
will sue, but few doubt that Belli, renowned for quick action in
personal injury cases, will be among the earliest to file a Flight
1713 suit.
The first filings will begin what could become years of litiga
tion in state and federal courts in Colorado, the crash site;
Texas, corporate headquarters of Continental; and Idaho, home
to most of Flight 1713's passengers
The compensation eventually paid to crash survivors and vic
tims' relatives may average more than $500,000 a claim and
could reach as high as $1.5 million a claim — the range for typi
cal court awards in recent air crashes, according to studies by
HALT, a Washington-based legal reform group.
That means that defendants in the Flight 1713 case could pay
anywhere from $40 million to more than $100 million in dam
ages.
Pope beatifies 85 British martyrs
VATICAN CITY (DPA) — In the presence of the Anglican
bishop of Birmingham, Mark Santer, and 2500 British pilgrims,
Pope John Paul II yesterday beatified 85 British martyrs who
were tortured and executed during the time of the Reformation.
The 63 Catholic priests and 22 lay members of the Catholic
church were from all parts of Britain and included one Scot and
six Welshmen.
Nearly all were hanged, drawn and quartered during the reign
of Queen Elizabeth I, who isolated the Catholic community with
a series of repressive laws. After she was excommunicated by
Pope Pius V, official persecution of Catholic missionaries
became.particularly savage.
The beatification of the 85 martyrs with Santer present was
seen as another step toward bridging the gap between the Catho
lic and the Anglican church. Beatification is the last stage before
canonization.

Shultz offers inspection concession
GENEVA — Secretary of State George Shultz said yesterday
the United States will offer the Soviet Union on-site inspection
rights at a U.S. missile facility as part of an effort to strike the
final bargain today and tomorrow on an arms control treaty to
be signed at the Washington summit conference.
