OAKDALE, La. — Rioting Cuban
prisoners who overpowered their guards and
took control of the federal detention center
here refused to surrender or release an esti
mated 28 hostages yesterday and again
demanded that they not he deported.
About 1000 Cuban prisoners took over the
detention center in rioting that began Satur
day night in the wake of an announcement by
the Reagan administration Friday that nearly
3000 Cuoans, most of them criminals or men
tally ill, would be returned to their home
country.
Russ Bergeron, a spokesman for the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, said
last night that the hostages — all of them
detention center employees — were still
being held by the Cubans.
An additional dozen or so hostages were
released during the day. Bergeron also said
that the inmates went on a destructive
rampage through the center, setting fire to
and heavily damaging all 14 buildings in the
compound. A pall of smoke hovered over the
compound yesterday, although the fires ap
peared to be out.
Among the buildings burned were the
chapel and dormitories. Heat and electricity
were cut off during the night and tempera
tures dropped to near-freezing.
The center opened in April 1986, despite
protests by the American Civil Liberties Un
ion that it was so isolated that few inmates

would have access to legal advice. Oak wood,
a town of about 70(H) residents, is about 30
miles south of Alexandria.
"The latest update 1 have is that the negoti
ations are continuing and that progress is
being made," Bergeron said.
A reporter who was allowed into the prison
compound said that negotiations were stalled
by arguments among the inmates. The
reporter, Paul Murphy of television station
KPLC in Lake Charles, La., who was
allowed on the prison grounds along with two
television crews, said that the prisoners could
not agree on a spokesman.
"We are dealing with a tired bunch.
They're unruly," Murphy said. "The inmates
have been up for a day and a half. They are
tired. They're confused. They can't agree on
who is going to do the talking."
Meanwhile, in another development, 17
Cuban inmates in Laredo, Texas, escaped
from a medium-security detention center
early yesterday, but most of them were
captured several hours later.
The mood immediately after the takeover
was extremely tense at the Louisiana prison,
primarily because of fear by the inmates that
the hundreds of law officers surrounding the
compound would storm it.
But the scene calmed considerably when
an agreement was reached that as long as ne
gotiations were continuing and the hostages
were safe, no one would enter the compound

forcibly.
Bergeron said that the inmates are demand
ing several things, including a guarantee they
would not he sent back to Cuba as well as as
surances they would not be punished for
staging the riot.
"They want information on what will hap
pen to them in the future," said J.R. Johnson,
the detention center warden.
When the announcement of the return to
Cuba was made Friday, Johnson attempted
to assuage the fears of the prisoners that they
would all be sent back in a group. Bergeron
said that steps were taken in anticipation of
trouble, including the beefing-up ot security
around the perimeter of the compound.
He said that there was a large food tight in
the center cafeteria Friday night, but that the
mood had remained calm until the riot
erupted about 6:30 p.m. Saturday.
Authorities said that 23 people suffered
minor injuries during the riot. All but about
50 of the 1050 inmates at the prison are
Cuban.
The Rev. Roy Bourgeois, a Roman Catho
lic priest, said that the announcement that the
prisoners would be sent to Cuba was the last
in a long line of injustices.
"When I got the word they were being
shipped back, my first thought was that
something serious was going to happen," he
said.

tally ill, would be returned to their home
country.
Russ Bergeron, a spokesman for the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, said
last night that the hostages — all of them
detention center employees — were still
being held by the Cubans.
An additional dozen or so hostages were
released during the day. Bergeron also said
that the inmates went on a destructive
rampage through the center, setting fire to
and heavily damaging all 14 buildings in the
compound. A pall of smoke hovered over the
compound yesterday, although the fires ap
peared to be out.
Among the buildings burned were the
chapel and dormitories. Heat and electricity
were cut off during the night and tempera
tures dropped to near-freezing.
The center opened in April 1986, despite
protests by the American Civil Liberties Un
ion that it was so isolated that few inmates

would have access to legal advice. Oak wood,
a town of about 70(H) residents, is about 30
miles south of Alexandria.
"The latest update 1 have is that the negoti
ations are continuing and that progress is
being made," Bergeron said.
A reporter who was allowed into the prison
compound said that negotiations were stalled
by arguments among the inmates. The
reporter, Paul Murphy of television station
KPLC in Lake Charles, La., who was
allowed on the prison grounds along with two
television crews, said that the prisoners could
not agree on a spokesman.
"We are dealing with a tired bunch.
They're unruly," Murphy said. "The inmates
have been up for a day and a half. They are
tired. They're confused. They can't agree on
who is going to do the talking."
Meanwhile, in another development, 17
Cuban inmates in Laredo, Texas, escaped
from a medium-security detention center
early yesterday, but most of them were
captured several hours later.
The mood immediately after the takeover
was extremely tense at the Louisiana prison,
primarily because of fear by the inmates that
the hundreds of law officers surrounding the
compound would storm it.
But the scene calmed considerably when
an agreement was reached that as long as ne
gotiations were continuing and the hostages
were safe, no one would enter the compound

forcibly.
Bergeron said that the inmates are demand
ing several things, including a guarantee they
would not he sent back to Cuba as well as as
surances they would not be punished for
staging the riot.
"They want information on what will hap
pen to them in the future," said J.R. Johnson,
the detention center warden.
When the announcement of the return to
Cuba was made Friday, Johnson attempted
to assuage the fears of the prisoners that they
would all be sent back in a group. Bergeron
said that steps were taken in anticipation of
trouble, including the beefing-up ot security
around the perimeter of the compound.
He said that there was a large food tight in
the center cafeteria Friday night, but that the
mood had remained calm until the riot
erupted about 6:30 p.m. Saturday.
Authorities said that 23 people suffered
minor injuries during the riot. All but about
50 of the 1050 inmates at the prison are
Cuban.
The Rev. Roy Bourgeois, a Roman Catho
lic priest, said that the announcement that the
prisoners would be sent to Cuba was the last
in a long line of injustices.
"When I got the word they were being
shipped back, my first thought was that
something serious was going to happen," he
said.
