# Sandinistas release 985 prisoners
## 
### 
TIPITAPA, Nicaragua â€” The
government of Nicaragua re
ported freeing 985 political
prisoners yesterday in a gesture
aimed at ending the war against
U.S.-backed rebels. It was the
largest single pardon in eight
years of Sandinista rule.
At a ceremony on a prison
farm here, Alvaro Guzman, chief
of the country's penitentiary sys
tem, told most of those being
pardoned that they were released
under terms of the Central Amer
ican peace accord of Aug. 7.
"The Nicaraguan people are
seeking peace," he said, "and
from now on, you are carriers of
this peace."
The prisoners, many of them
peasant farmers accused of
aiding the rebels, stood in forma
tion under a hot sun and burst
into applause at the end of Guz
man's speech, then scrambled to
embrace relatives waiting on the
other side of a rope.
Aristides Anastasio Esquivel,

41, an alleged collaborator with
the contra guerrillas who spent
three years in prison, dropped to
his knees in the dusty field with
five members of his family and
led them in prayer.
"Praised be the Lord, and may
He bring us Nicaraguans to
gether," Esquivel said. The
prayer ended in tears.
The prisoner release was the
first outcome of a continuing
emotional dispute in Nicaragua
over the terms of a political am
nesty required by the vaguely
worded peace accord signed by
the live Central American presi
dents.
Guzman said that 612 inmates
held in prisons near Managua
were freed at the ceremony here,
14 miles east of the capital, and
another 173 were released else
where.
He said that 3039 people
accused or convicted of security
offenses are still imprisoned. The
non-government human rights

commission puts the number at
between 8500 and 9000.
The leftist Sandinista govern
ment has offered amnesty to any
rebel combatant who surrenders,
but it refuses to extend a blanket
amnesty to prisoners until other
Central American countries stop
aiding the contras, as the peace
accord requires.
Even then, the government
says, anyone jailed before 1981
would not be eligible for am
nesty. That would exclude the
2(HH) or so imprisoned members
of former President Anastasio
Somoza's disbanded National
Guard, which was defeated in an
insurgency that brought the San
dinistas to power in 1979.
According to the Sandinistas'
logic, an amnesty that would for
get the Somoza regime's crimes
would undermine the legitimacy
of their revolution; but amnekty,
for the contras would be permit
ted because it would be aimed at
settling a conflict that arose after

they gained power.
For now, the Sandinistas have
adopted a policy of selective par
dons, agreeing to consider ap
peals on behalf of National
Guardsmen and other prisoners
who are not accused of killing.
About 2000 guardsmen were
freed yesterday.
But that policy is under sharp
attack by Nicaragua's Roman
Catholic bishops and opposition
political parties, who say the
peace accord requires that all
prisoners be freed. Cardinal
Miguel Obando y Bravo repeated
that position yesterday in a
homily at his Mass.
While praising the pardons,
Obando said he would "keep in
sisting on a broad amnesty." He
criticized an anti-amnesty cam
paign by an organization of San
dinista women whose relatives
dieil lighting the National Cnrnffd
-orthe Korrtras.
