# Reagan silent on pardon prospect
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Despite
renewed speculation over
whether President Reagan will
pardon the two central figures in
the Iran-contra affair, Reagan
and White House officials yester
day avoided sending any signals
about the president's intentions.
When asked whether he might
pardon Rear Adm. John Poindex
ter and Marine Lt. Col. Oliver
North, Reagan responded,
"That's a question no one can
answer."
The question has lingered for
nearly a year, and it took on a
renewed life over the weekend
when rumors circulated that
Reagan might issue the pardons
Thanksgiving Day.
Such pardons would cut short
the independent counsel's inves
tigation of the Iran-contra roles
of Poindexter, who was Reagan's

national security adviser during
the affair, and North, who was a
Poindexter deputy on the staff of
the National Security Council.
They quit the White House staff
a year ago as the scandal un
folded.
Independent counsel Law
rence Walsh is presenting
evidence to a federal grand jury
investigating the sale of weapons
to Iran and the diversion of prof
its to the Nicaraguan rebels. No
indictments are expected until
January.
The White House confirmed
last week that Reagan received a
letter last summer from William
Clark, one of Poindexter's
predecessors as national security
adviser and a longtime Reagan
adviser, recommending pardons
for the two. When the letter was

disclosed. White House spokes
man Marlin Fitzwater would say
only, "The president says he
won't discuss it, period."
Fitzwater yesterday refused
again to discuss the politically
explosive issue. But he indicated
that no pardons should be an
ticipated while Reagan spends
the holiday at his ranch north
west of Santa Barbara.
"I don't expect any significant
news on this trip, and I would
send out skeleton crews," the
spokesman said, calling the
rumors a "media phenomena"
and adding: "I don't want to lend
any credence to these media
rumors. It just lends credence to
idle speculation and ill-founded
rumors." Reagan was ques
tioned twice in public yesterday
about pardons, first when he

posed with a 55-pound Thanks
giving turkey presented to the
White House and then during a
photo session at the start of a
meeting with business leaders.
Eleven months ago — just
before the Christmas holiday —
the subject of pardons was raised
by White House aides, said then-
White House spokesman Larry
Speakes, who added that Reagan
rejected the idea.
Meanwhile, Reagan defended
his appointment of a military offi
cer, Army Lt. Gen. Colin Powell,
to be his national security adviser
despite the recommendation of
the Iran-contra committees that a
civilian hold the post. Powell
would succeed Frank Carlucci,
who was sworn in yesterday as
secretary of defense.
