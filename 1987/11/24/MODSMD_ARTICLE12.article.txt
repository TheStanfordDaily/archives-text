# Escondido blackout resolved
## Design problems remain 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
University officials said yes
terday they believe the problems
that caused a widespread black
out in Escondido Village last
week are solved, but they would
not rule out future power outages
there and said delays in restoring
power will remain because of
design flaws in the complex's
power system.
It took workers 23 hours to
return power to the residences
affected by the blackout, which
began around 6 p.m. Thursday.
Nearly 15(H) people in over 100
units were without power.
Escondido does not have a net
worked power system like most
University residences, said Jeff
Sultan, a University electricity
distribution and systems
manager. Instead, large portions
of the complex's power are
routed through one power trans
former, which broke down
Thursday and caused the black
out.
"Escondido is a little harder to
get back on," Sultan said.
In addition. Sultan said, Es
condido lacks a secondary power

source that can be looped into
service in the event of a break
down.
Some residents of Escondido
complained about the frequency
of power loss in their homes. The
recent blackout follows a series
over the past year of scheduled
maintenance shutdowns, many
of which have extended far
beyond originally planned, said
resident Ursula Bishop.

The large number of
children in Escondido
makes the electricity
problem more serious
there than in other
residence areas.

Bishop said an unplanned,
several-hour blackout spring
quarter and the University's de
cision to shut down power cam
puswide Dec. 20 also are contri
buting to discontent among resi
dents.
Sultan said the University
would not replace the system be

cause of "prohibitive expense."
He added, however, that he
believed such an overhaul would
be "money well spent."
Bishop said the large number
of children in Escondido makes
the electricity problem more
serious than in other residence
areas. "Escondido is full of
people with children" who need
heat and food more than adults,
she said.
Sultan said the recent prob
lems should be solved soon, once
the University completes its ef
fort to replace all of Escondido's
wiring with new wiring. He
predicted that the new trans
former installed this weekend
after the blackout should work
without problems for an in
definite period.
Thursday's blackout resulted
from the breakdown of the trans
former that supplies power to
most of Escondido Village. Ac
cording to Bob Mibach, facilities
manager for Graduate Student
Housing, the type of transformer
used in the village is "very rare."
Fortunately, University offi
cials were able to locate a similar
transformer on campus that had
been purchased but never used.
