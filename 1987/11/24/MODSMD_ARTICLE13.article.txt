Presidents of 15 major U.S. universities,
including Stanford President Donald Ken
nedy, sent a letter Friday to South Africa's
minister of education criticizing that
country's recently imposed restrictions on
universities.
The restrictions, enacted last month, re
quire the five major South African univer
sities to prohibit student demonstrations on
campus. I'he regulations threaten to cut off
all state subsidies to the universities if they
do not comply. In South Africa, government
funding provides 70 to KO percent of univer
sity operating costs.
All five South African universities
Rhodes University and the universities of
Cape Town, Natal, the Western Cape and
Witwatersrand â€” have challenged the re
strictions and have organized marches in
defiance of the government order.

The letter, addressed to F.W. deKlerk,
minister of National Education in South
Africa, argues that the restrictions on
protests "are inconsistent with universal
standards of academic freedom and
autonomy." It says that "conditions can only
further compromise the freedom of speech
and inquiry on the campuses of South
Africa."
"Any university of standing must enjoy the
independence and freedom required to carry
out its essential mission," the presidents
said. "Accordingly we urge you (deKlerk)
and the South African government not to
impose these conditions.'
Justin Harmon, director of communication
at Princeton University, said the initial re
quest for the letter came from a visiting rector
from a South African university. The rector
"expressed a need to have U.S. universities
join in the protest of the policies," he said.
Princeton President William Bowen and
Harvard President Derek Bok drafted the let

ter and circulated it to the other college presi
dents, Harmon said.
The signatories of the letter are presidents
Edward Bloustien of Rutgers, James Freed
man of Dartmouth, David Gardner of the
University of California, Hanna Gray of the
University of Chicago, Sheldon Hackney of
the University of Pennsylvania, Jean Mayer
of Tufts, Frank Rhodes of Cornell, David
Saxon of MIT, Benno Schmidt of Yale,
Harold Shapiro of the University of Michi
gan, Howard Swearer of Brown, acting Co
lumbia President Robert Goldberger, Bok,
Bowen and Kennedy.
Diana Diamond, assistant director of Uni
versity Relations at Stanford, said one of the
reasons Kennedy signed the letter was his
concern over the threat to academic freedom
posed by the restrictions. The letter is in
tended "to impress upon the South African
government" the need for a change in policy,
she said.
