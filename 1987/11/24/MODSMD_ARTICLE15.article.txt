Law School Dean Paul Brest's public apology
Friday to former visiting Prof. Derrick Bell was
a well-considered action. Brest should be ap
plauded for his candidness in referring to the
Law School's treatment of Bell, who is black, as
"an affront." In 1986, the school drew fire from
Bell and many law students when it scheduled a
lecture series designed to "supplement" Bell's
constitutional law class.
Brest's apology indicates that the concerns
raised by the Law School's Multicultural Coun
cil — a coalition of ethnic minority, women's,
lesbian and gay groups — are having an effect on
the Law School's public positions.
But while the council is to be congratulated for
its influence in being heard, and while it is to be
commended for its dedication to addressing the
broad goal of eliminating discrimination, its in
sistence on setting quotas of minority and female
representation among faculty is both unrealistic
and unfair.

After Brest's apology, the council issued a list
of demands that included one requiring that all
first-year law students be "taught by both a
minority and a woman professor."
Because qualified professors who would not
meet the council's criteria would have a slimmer
chance of being allowed to teach first-year stu
dents, such a restriction is wrongfully discrimi
natory.
Candidates for teaching positions should be
judged on the basis of their capabilities and their
potential to enrich the learning experiences of
their students. None should be excluded be
cause she or he does not fit into a meaningless
mold intended to test for sensitivity to minority
and women's concerns.
The council's extreme position undermines
the legitimacy of its efforts to gain effective ac
tion on the council's other demands, which are
reasonable and desirable.
