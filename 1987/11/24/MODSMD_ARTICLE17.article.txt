## The
						forgotten facts about Area One proposal 
### 
As a newcomer to the administration
with no firsthand experience in the
Western Culture program, I have been
hesitant these past weeks to make public
pronouncements on the controversy sur
rounding the Area One Task Force pro
posal.

Thomas Wasow

I now feel compelled, however, to
speak out publicly, for 1 fear that the
rather shrill tone of some of the recent
rhetoric on this subject is leading to an
unfortunate polarization — just the op
posite of the intended effect of the pro
posal. 1 believe, moreover, that a good
deal of the negative comment stems
from some fairly widespread misconcep
tions about the proposal. 1 hope that 1
can clarify a few points that will help the
parties to this debate find common
ground.
Here are some facts that are often
overlooked or forgotten.
First, what is being proposed is legis
lation, not a course outline. It does not
spell out the content of the courses that
would be in the new program. Rather, it
sets general guidelines for courses that
would fill the Area One distribution re
quirement and provides a rationale for
the requirement.
Hence, it should be considered in the
context of the entire system of distribu
tion requirements: It should be
evaluated as a specification of a distribu
tion requirement, not as if it were a
course description. Viewed from this
perspective, the proposal is not, as some
have charged, excessively vague.
Indeed, it is considerably less vague
than the legislation describing any of the
other distribution requirements, includ
ing the existing Western Culture legisla
tion.
Many people seem to fear that ele
ments of the current courses not explic
itly mentioned in the task force proposal
would be eliminated from the program

altogether, a prime example being
coverage of ancient Greece. This fear is
based on misunderstanding. The ena
bling legislation of the current require
ment says nothing about ancient Greece.
Works from ancient Greece were in
cluded on the original core list, and suc
cessive Western Culture committees
have chosen to retain them. There is
every reason to believe that our faculty
places great value on these works, and
every reason to expect that many of the
tracks will retain them. Any that do not
will be approved only if the replace
ments are themselves works of great
value.
What is being legislated away, quite
properly, is the failure to acknowledge in
a substantive way the contributions of
women and minorities. There is a long
tradition that treats our culture as if it
were the product solely of white males.
While the core list seems to support the
tradition, the full syllabi of the present
tracks do not. The task force proposal
makes the break with this tradition ex
plicit and opens the door to the develop
ment of innovative new courses.
A second widespread misunderstand
ing concerns the role of non-European
cultures in the proposed program. The
task force has not suggested a world cul
ture requirement. Rather, the proposal
requires that every track include "works
. . . from at least one of the non-
European cultures that have become
components of our diverse American so
ciety."
This requirement follows from the in
sistence that the role of minorities be
taken seriously in the program: this role
cannot be adequately appreciated with
out some attention to the non-European
ancestry of the minorities in question.
The proposal is not intended as a substi
tute for or a strengthening of the current
non-Western Culture requirement.
That requirement is admittedly weak
and in need of careful examination. The
Committee on Undergraduate Studies is
in the process of setting up a subcommit
tee to undertake such an examination.
But the passage in the task force's pro

posal quoted above addresses a problem
that is orthogonal to the shortcomings of
the non-Western Culture requirement.
It is worth mentioning, incidentally,
that the misperception that the task
force is advocating some sort of world
culture course appears to exist on both
sides of the current debate. Thus, on the
one hand, a group of students writing in
Campus Report criticized the proposal
for "trying to be all things to all people,"
suggesting a strengthening of the non-
Western Culture requirement as one
preferable alternative; on the other
hand, the ASSU Senate passed a resolu
tion calling on the readings to be divided
equally between European and non-
European works. Both positions indi
cate that their advocates misunderstand
the task force proposal.
Another fact widely ignored in the
heat of debate is that the current pro
gram is judged to be very successful by
most of the students who go through it.
The task force proposal is designed to
preserve those elements of the program
that have made it so successful, while at
the same time recognizing the role that
women and people of non-European
descent have played in the development
of our culture.
There are at least four critical compo
nents of the current program that the
task force proposal preserves. First, the
tracks provide an integrated look at art,
literature, philosophy, politics and reli
gion over a period of centuries. Second,
each track is a year-long sequence of
courses, making it possible to sustain
lines of inquiry beyond the normal limits
of the quarter system.
Third, all courses in the program in
volve regular small group sessions led by
highly qualified and carefully selected
instructors. Fourth, only a small number
of tracks are approved for the program,
and each one is scrutinized closely, both
before and after approval, by an over
sight committee. 1 believe that these are
the key ingredients of the strength of the
current Western Culture program. Be
cause the task force proposal preserves
them, I am convinced that the new pro

gram, if approved, will be a success.
Finally, let me turn to the divisive
issue of the core list. Some critics of the
task force proposal have argued that the
elimination of a common reading list for
the tracks renders the requirement con
tentless. In reply, I would point out that
no other distribution requirement stip
ulates specific readings, authors, or
ideas that must be covered. This is true
even in areas whose subject matter is
quite cohesive and well-defined.
Thus, for example, we do not demand
that every course satisfying the Area Six
(mathematical sciences) requirement
cover the fundamental theorem of cal
culus (although one could argue that
every educated person should be
familiar with it). There is a good reason
for this. Every one of the eight distribu
tion areas is too large to pick out certain
milestones as being so important as to be
required, even to the exclusion of other
great accomplishments. There is simply
too much to know and too little time for

our students to learn it all.
We can require that their programs of
study exhibit both breadth and depth,
and we can control for the substance and
quality of the courses that satisfy those
requirements. But trying to stipulate in
advance what material is to be covered
cuts out too much, and ultimately does
the students a disservice.
The task force proposal is only an ena
bling document. Like the legislation now
in force, it could be implemented in a va
riety of different ways. It is an attempt
— an impressive one, in my opinion —
to preserve what is best about the cur
rent Western Culture program while at
the same time addressing the legitimate
complaints of its critics. With the sup
port of the Stanford community, the fac
ulty can turn the task force report into an
exciting program, and Stanford could
become a model for other institutions
wrestling with the same issues.
