Talk to pertinent
faculty in Western
Culture debate
If anything is clear in a modern univer
sity, it is that faculty decide what the
students need to know. The pertinent
faculty in the case of Western Culture is
the humanities faculty. But the task
force appointed by the provost to pro
pose a radical revision of the Area One
requirement in that subject has excluded
all humanists but one. (English) Prof.
(Albert) Gelpi, accordingly, has publicly
called for a reconstitution of that task
force, to include a majority of
humanists.
It isn't going to happen, I am told. But

at least let's call a spade a spade: this is a
harsh violation of civilized academic
procedure, one which shows amazing
disregard for the feelings of many indi
viduals who have devoted their lives to
the furtherance of higher learning.
The exact same thing happened a gen
eration ago, with the rigged committee
which produced the Study of Education
at Stanford. There was only one
humanist on that one, too. The result:
The 11 volumes of the report have been
shredded and forgotten, a sheer embar
rassment to all concerned.
Why? Well, in time the objective truth
tends to get the better of shallow trendi
ness and brute political power. But oh,
the waste. . . .
