## Choose a conservative Democrat 
### 
An overwhelming majority of
students at Stanford are liberal.
If Stanford were the United
States, Walter Mondale would be
president right now. Walter
Mondale collected about 70 per
cent of Stanford votes against
Reagan in the 1984 election.
Many Stanford students saw
Mondale as the ideal candidate, a
crusader for social welfare in this
country and for accommodation
with the Soviets. The general
American public, however, per
ceived him as weak and voted for
Reagan, whom they believed,
correctly or incorrectly, was a
strong leader.

An editorial writer explains
that recent Democratic candi
dates have strayed from "what
was once a winning formula for
the Democratic Party: an activist
foreign policy backed by military
strength and an energetic domes
tic policy on behalf of the eco
nomically weak and vulnerable.
Adapting this formula to chang
ing circumstances, the Demo
crats won seven of the nine presi

dential elections from 1932 to
1964."
Democrats can win upcoming
elections only by proving to the
American people that they have
resolve in the area of foreign
policy. Unfortunately, many of
the Democratic candidates are al
ready committing themselves to
views that the American public
will perceive as weak.
In a recent foreign policy
debate among the Democratic
candidates, for example, the
question was raised about
whether or not the United States
should be involved in the Persian
Gulf right now. All of the candi
dates, except for Albert Gore, in
itially opposed United States in
volvement.
The Persian Gulf was not the
only example of the current
Democratic candidates' deviat
ing from American opinion in
foreign policy. Gore was the only
Democratic candidate who en
dorsed the U.S. invasion of
Grenada. The other candidates
either disagreed with the inva
sion or changed the subject when
asked about it.
Gore was the only Democrat
who portrayed himself as willing
to use force to defend U.S. inter
ests in the Persian Gulf and

around the world. This fact
makes him eminently electable.
The Stanford Democrats must
ask themselves a hard question
about the upcoming election: Is it
best to again support an ultra
liberal candidate, one who
opposes the use of force in
Grenada, the Persian Gulf or
elsewhere?

It is better for Stanford
students to support a
conservative Demo
crat, one that has more
appeal to the American
people.

In my view, it is better for
these Stanford students to sup
port a conservative Democrat,
one who has more appeal to the
American people. A conserva
tive Democrat in office is better
than a Republican who came to
office because of his strong stand
on defense. I personally have no
problem with selecting a conser
vative Democrat because I am
also a conservative Democrat.
Albert Gore is my candidate

partly because he is the only con
servative Democrat. He presents '
himself as a tough Democrat,
ready to face challenges around '
the world.
While Albert Gore is more
conservative than the other Dem
ocratic candidates, he agrees
with them in certain foreign
policy issues. Gore, for example,
opposes the deployment of Star
Wars. As president, Gore will
eliminate unnecessary U.S. mili
tary programs and will support
U.S. force where it is needed.
Gore, in keeping with Demo
cratic tradition, is liberal in do
mestic issues. Gore believes the
Reagan cuts in welfare programs
have been disastrous to the poor
and would take steps to reverse
this trend. Gore also supports the
Kqual Rights Amendment and in
creasing the budget for AIDS re
search.
From a practical standpoint,
Democrats must support a candi
date who has a chance of being
elected and not just one who fits I
into their idealized visions of the
world. Albert Gore is the obvious
choice for the Democratic nomi
nation, both on this campus and
nationally.
