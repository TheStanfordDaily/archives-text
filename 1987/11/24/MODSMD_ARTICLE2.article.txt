# Res Ed report due in January
## Lyons says door closed to new housed fraternities 
### Sean Kinch Staff writer 
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons told the Interfraternity Council
last night that he plans to bar un
housed fraternities from gaining Uni
versity residences.
"The University does not plan to in
crease the number of residences as
signed to fraternal organizations. The
unhoused organizations will remain
unhoused, the housed will remained
housed," Lyons said at a regularly
scheduled IFC meeting.
Lyons said that by articulating this
policy he is simply formalizing a gen
eral understanding that has existed for
almost 20 years.
Although up to now the University
has never officially adopted such a
policy. Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson, who also attended
the meeting, cited University reports
from 1968 and 1977 that assume the
University had an unwritten policy
limiting the number of fraternal
residences to the ones already in
place.
IFC President Vinny Frost said he
disagrees with Lyons' position and
that he hopes Lyons changes his mind
about the matter. "I am disappointed
that they (the University) would make
it explicit. It's a bad move," Frost
said.
Frost said there may be fraternal or
ganizations in the future that deserve
housing and would like to have it.

Lyons' proposal came as he an
nounced that the long-awaited Resi
dential Education report on the future
of fraternities at Stanford will proba
bly be released in January.
The report, written by a task force
appointed by Lyons, will recommend
that the fraternities make their selec
tion process "as objective as possi
ble." Lyons said, however, that he
would be opposed to any policy that

would remove the selection process
from fraternity control.
Lyons warned the IFC that many in
the University community will inter
pret the report's recommendations to
mean the fraternities should be re
quired to enter the Draw. Lyons said
he anticipated that some will argue
that any system in which students
select the members of their own group
is by its very nature not "as objective
as possible," and should therefore be
eliminated.
The principle behind this view,
Lyons said, is that students should not
be permitted to deny other students
access to University-owned housing.
The University owns all of the frater
nity residences except the Sigma Chi
house.
Both Lyons and Robinson said they
oppose adding fraternities to the
Draw.
The purpose of the fraternity task
force is to make recommendations to
him concerning the future of fraterni
ties at Stanford, Lyons said.
Lyons said he will not make any
final policy changes until the report's
recommendations have been pub
lished and thoroughly discussed by the
community.
Robinson said the report also
recommends that the fraternties make
their selection standards available to
potential applicants in order to give
them and the fraternities an opportu-
