# A 						plea for the Foothills
## 
### 
What do you do when you have a problem?
Something pressing down on you like a great
weight that won't go away?
Bad problems can get to the point where they
start to mess up your mind. They pressure you so
much that you lose all motivation to study or work.
Somewhere, somehow, you have to find a release.
Mine is the Dish.

When my problems reach the point where I start
getting desperate, I run. Anywhere. The more
frenzied I feel, the faster I go. 1 run wherever in
stinct tells me to. And every single time 1 end up
going to the Dish.
My problems melt away. Around me I experi
ence nothing but silence, beauty and peace. I can
see the whole mess of civilization from up there,
but it's so far away that it doesn't seem to exist.
Alone in the Foothills, above all things stress
related, the problems that pressure me so relent
lessly start to fall away, until they become utterly
insignificant. By the time I come down I've got
control over my problems, and life feels good.
What would we do without the Foothills? They
are a precious island in a sea of yuppie develop
ment. They lie right next to campus, and yet in
terms of human habitation, they are practically un
touched. Other than a few satellite dishes and an
observatory or two, the Dish hills contain hardly
any reminders of the bustling civilization around
them. For those of us without cars, they represent
one of the few places we can go to escape from all
the pressure, worry and pain of school, work and
relationships. I ran in the Foothills nearly every
day of winter quarter last year, and I believe now
that that was the only thing that kept me sane.
The Dish hills are sacred. Seriously, though,
think how lucky we are to have them. Look at
Berkeley. They re stuck in the middle of a city. If
any Weenies desperately needed to return to nature
for a while and set their lives back in order, they
couldn't do it. On the Farm, we can.
But not for long.
The Stanford university Planning Commission
has released a report containing long-range
guidelines for developing all but ISO acres of the
Foothills.
One hundred eighty acres. Compared to the size
of the Foothills, that's not much. Specifically, it is
the "bowl," the area facing campus just in front of
the faculty houses. Other than this area, all other
parts of the Foothills, including the ridge where the
Dish is located, may become sites for future devel

opment of "academic programs." This alarming in
formation first appeared in an article by my friend
Tim Hullar, "Plan outlines future development of
Foothills region" (Daily, Nov. 4).
I am not a politically oriented person. I know
close to nothing about present-day political or
moral issues. Normally when I'm faced with any
thing to do with politics, I shy away with the old "1
can't do anything about it" apathy. But this is dif
ferent.
For once, I know something about this issue. I
care about it. They are talking about developing the
foothills. The thought makes me sick. Oh, the
planning commission words it so nicely, but you
know that clever manipulations of the Fnglish lan
guage will never make up for the destruction of the
beauty of an undeveloped landscape.
Take the statement about leaving the "bowl" un
touched. According to the planning commission,
the purpose of this action is to "keep the bowl in
tact as an environmental and recreational
resource." Nice thought, but it is only 180 acres,
concentrated in one small space. Developing the
rest of the region would wipe out the myriad of
trails that run all over the Dish hills.
Furthermore, it is rather difficult to construct
recreationally pleasing trails through a bowl. You
either struggle up and down steep grades or you run
around in concentric circles. Wow, what fun.
Or take the statement about utilizing
"techniques to lessen the visual impact," such as
partially burying buildings or painting them so that
they "blend'' into the environment. Well, isn't that
special! Please tell me how you can blend four or
live buildings totaling 25,000 square feet into the
relatively open landscape of the Foothills.
The domino theory strikes again. First you con
struct a building. Then you need a parking lot for
the building. Parking lots require access roads.
Access roads have a way of becoming too "small,"
requiring expansion into two-lane roadways. Pretty
soon you have constant traffic, litter, air pollution
and an irreversibly ruined environmental and
recreational resource. It is enough to stand on the
Dish ridges and see civilization from a distance.
The thought of having it creep all the way up to the
ridges themselves disgusts me.
I could rant on and on, but 1 think you under
stand my general meaning. 1 say leave the Dish hills
alone. 1 realize these development plans are not
set; they are preliminary guidelines only. I realize
also that the University has an obligation to use the
Foothills land for "academic purposes." While I
respect this right, 1 cannot stand the thought of the
Foothills being developed, even for academic
purposes. It is because of academics that we need
open, untouched areas like the Foothills in the first
place. We need them for exercise, for relaxing, for
figuring out our problems and for setting our lives
straight again.
Without them, we'll surely become Weenies.
