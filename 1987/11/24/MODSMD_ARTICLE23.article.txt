An invitation to
eat at Stern Hall
I really enjoyed the article,
"Beyond Roses: the Bay Area's
best romantic dates" (Daily.
Nov. 5). I will use some of your
ideas on my next "romantic
date.''
Your opening paragraph upset
me, though. As a manager at
Stern Food Service, I know that
my staff, hashers and the other
managers work very hard to pro
vide the residents with the best
food service possible. Stern Hall
offers some very unique features
that are very popular with stu
dents around the campus, such
as a daily stir-fry bar, a deli lunch
line and a make-your-own break
fast and brunch bar.
We are aware of the fact that
Stern Food Service is "picked"
on for our food service. But we
want you to know that there are
many dedicated people working
here, and we feel hurt by unnec
essary comments like the one
you made in your article.
I invite students to eat at Stern
for lunch or dinner sometime to
discuss Stern Hall and food ser
vice in general. Perhaps you
could write a story on the behind
the-scenes work of a large
kitchen that serves over 1400

meals per day.

Last week, 49 years after Kris
tallnacht — the day that all the
synagogues were burned
throughout Germany — some
person or group painted swas
tikas all over a temple in Red
wood City and wrote, "We'll get
you." I was horrified and
furious, yet I found some peace
in the fact that these views and
actions probably came from a
small Aryan group.
But today I am not so sure. On
Nov. 15, Rev. Lawrence Carter
preached anti-Semitism in
Memorial Church. He was
invited by the "You Can Make A
Difference Conference" on insti
tutional racism to give a sermon
encouraging people to try. to
change the racist in
which we live. Having spent Ifhe
past five months working on the
conference, I felt extremely
betrayed. He said that Jews
believed that all non-Jews could
"take a jet ride to hell" and that
"God is for us Jews." Carter also
claimed that Jews were only will

ing to light for their own eman
cipation and, in essence, said this
was one of" the main causes of in
stitutional racism.
His speech was eloquent, and
his condemnation of the Jews
was within the first five minutes.
As a result, I wonder how many
people left the church outraged. I
was and I still am! The reason we
organized the conference was to
show how we live in a global vil
lage. We are responsible to one
another, for we are all members
of the human race. How pitiful
that such good intentions and the
other successful and informative
parts of the conference must be
tainted with such blatant anti-
Semitism.
I hope that others were equally
outraged by the division and
alienation that Carter inspired
and by his cruel and historically
incorrect portrayal of Jews.
When I returned this summer
from a German-Jewish exchange
program, I realized more than
ever that the Nazi, the ability to
stereotype and dehumanize an
other, lies within us all. We can
not step on one another to reach
our own goals. Oppression is
oppression, regardless of who is
doing it or in whose name it is
done.
