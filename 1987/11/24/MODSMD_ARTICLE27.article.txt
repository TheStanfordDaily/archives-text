## A
						Kappa pledge and inquiring minds want to know Bug Me checks out ye olde Safer Sex Shoppe 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
I was listening to the news on KCBS radio the
other day, and the newscaster came on to do a
story about U2's Bono being charged with damag
ing public property during the group's free concert
in downtown San Francisco a couple weeks ago.
She said, "No charges will be filed against Irish
rock star Sonny Bono." This is a true story.
I almost fell out of bed laughing.
Quickly now, allow me to answer this week's
three most asked questions:
1. No, I don't make up the questions.
2. Yes, Hindola, I will marry you.
3. You can send your questions to Bug Me, Stan
ford Daily, Storke Building, Stanford, CA 94305.
Or send them to Bug Me (not B.Bug-Me) at the
tragedies on LOTS.

Dear Bug,
I recently read an article in the Daily about the
Safer Sex Shoppe that mentioned a "Chocolate
Flavored Dental Dam." What are they used for?
How do the\ Jit/attach in the human mouth? What
additional flavors are available? Are they endorsed
by the American Dental Association? And do they
help fight cavities?
- A Kappa Pledge
You know what I love about this job? I get to go
to places that I would otherwise never ever have
the nerve to visit. This week, the Bug visited the
Safer Sex Shoppe in the Old Firehouse to get the
lowdown on dental dams and other stuff.
A girl walked by while I was parking my bike in
front of the Old Firehouse, and I did my best to put
an expression on my face that said: "You probably
think I'm about to go into the Safer Sex Shoppe and
purchase condoms for a wild night of debauchery,
out let me reassure you that 1 am simply parking
my bike here so I can enjoy the cool and crisp night
air."
She gave me a knowing smirk and went on her
way. 1 went into the Safer Sex Shoppe.
Never before had I seen such a wide array of safe
sex devices in my young, Puritan life. A zillion
brands of condoms, lubricants, pamphlets and yes,
those darned dental dams.
They have individual condoms of all shapes and
sizes, and condom gift packs in festive Christmas
colors that would make great stocking stuffers.
Somewhere there is a brilliant marketing executive
who designed a box of condoms that looks exactly
like a box of candy.
There is also the box of "Blacky" condoms that
looks exactly like a box of Godiva chocolates.
They have the Rough Rider condom, which is
"studded for more pleasure." It looks and feels
like a snow tire. Then there's the Yamabuki con
dom, which the guy at the Shoppe blew up into a

balloon that was three feet long.
I would love to put up a bunch of those condom
balloons at a church party and then slowly let the
air out as the evening progressed. By 11 p.m. there
would be a bunch of condoms hanging around the
room.
Then we played with lubricants. They had two
brands. Probe, and Astroglide. Probe sounds okay
to me, but frankly Astroglide is out of the question;
I don't use a lubricant named after the Jetsons'
dog.
Water-based lubricants seem to dry up on your
fingers but later can be brought back to life by add
ing a little water. Kind of like Sea Monkeys.
Next we looked at "How to Use Condoms"
pamphlets, which can, believe me, get very ex
plicit.
For those who are completely unsqeamish, the
Safe Sex Shoppe has "The Hot n Healthy Times,
a condom newsletter that includes live color photos
of condoms actually in use. This might make an
other terrific stocking stuffer.
But on to the dental dams. You're going to be
very disappointed to hear that the dental dams
aren't chocolate flavored but chocolate scented. 1
know this ruins your whole week. A dental dam is
just a six-by-six-inch sheet of latex; the same thing
that dentists stick in your mouth when giving you a
filling or performing some other disgusting maneu
ver within your jaw.
They (the dams, not the dentists) come in four
scents: Chocolate, Mint, Cherry and Latex, but
they all smelled exactly the same to me.
Dental dams, which go for 50 cents each, are
used as a barrier method for disease protection
when performing any kind of oral sex. The reason
you need a dental dam, is because sexual diseases
such as AIDS and herpes can be caught when per
forming oral sex.
Which brings us to the question: Why has "safe
sex" suddenly been replaced by "safer sex?" Ac
cording to the Safer Sex Shoppe guy, there is no
such thing as completely safe sex; there is always
some kind of risk involved.
So, for all your one-stop safer sex shopping
needs, visit the Safer Sex Shoppe in the Old
Firehouse Wednesday nights, or in White Plaza
Tuesdays and Thursdays.
A box of condoms costs a little over $1 at the
Safer Sex Shoppe, which for my money is a much
better deal than forking over $5 at The Store for the
privilege of having a perky cashier say something
like, "A whole box or condoms, eh? Those should
last you for quite a while, shouldn't they?"
Dear Bug,
Why is the road near Maples Pavilion named
Bonair Siding?
- Inquiring Minds
I swear to God you ain't gonna believe this one. 1
don't know exactly who Bonair was, but it was
called Siding because it was a railroad siding. Yes,
there used to be an electric railroad that ran smack
dab through the center of campus.
Back in 1906. folks discovered that without cars
it was a little bit difficult to get to the center of
campus from Palo Alto. Horse-drawn carriages and
bicycles simply did not cut it. (Strange, then, how
the Housing Office still tries to convince us that
bicycles are an effective way of getting to campus
from off-campus housing.) Hence, an electric rail
road was built.
The campus terminus was right across from The
Daily office. From there, the tracks ran south,
across Lasuen Street, where there was a covered

shed that served as a waiting area.
Then it curved through fields of wheat past En
cina Hall, where it took a left past the Oval through
the Arboretum to HI Camino Real, which was then
called Country Road. It followed Country Road for
a little ways until it hit University Avenue; and
then it headed straight up University to Pope
Street.
But allow me to put this into modern terms: The
tracks started at The Daily, went parallel to the
Quad, through Meyer Library, left at Encina Hall,
past Encina Gym and Stanford Stadium, through
the woods to grandmother's house. Oh yeah, it
probably went along Bonair Siding for a while, too.
Affectionately called "the Toonerville Trolley,"
the little red railroad cars would take students and
visitors from Palo Alto into the center of campus.
The train was finally abandoned in 1929, when
cars and buses made the railroad obsolete. The
tracks have all been paved over now.
I owe a lot to the University Archives Special
Collections for the answer to this one. The ar
chives, on the seventh floor of Green Library, is
probably the coolest place I've been on campus.
First of all. to get there you have to go into Green
through the old entrance facing the Quad, and then
you take a hidden elevator up to the seventh floor.
This is the oldest elevator on campus. It's one of
those ones where you have to open the doors your
self, and then a cage shuts in front of you.
The archives have all kinds of cool stuff, like all
the froshbooks since 1969, and all the University
Bulletins since the Stone Age. Leafing through the

bulletin of 1926, I couldn't help but giggle at a few
classes offered by the Psychology Department:
"Psych 50 — Mental Hygiene." Sounds to me
like they stick a hose in your ear and start cleaning.
"Psych 152 — Selling" Here's the actual course
description from 1926: "General theory of influenc
ing others. Intended for students who expect to in
fluence others in business, education, etc."
Tuition then was $75 per quarter, plus a $20 stu
dent fee, which just proves that Stanford's student
unions have been gouging us for most of the cen
tury. Housing cost $24 a quarter. But you wouldn't
have wanted to go to Stanford b-.ck then — there
wasn't any Western Culture. He vv boring.
Dear BnMf
A church Is a place for worship isn't it? Then why
is there a hurnongous antenna on top of the office
behind Mem Chu? Do they get cable and the
Playboy Channel?
-Devil's Advocate
The following is a true story:
1 marched into the Round Room behind Mem
Chu and asked what the antenna was for, and a guy
came over and said, "Oh, that's how we talk to
God." I assume he was struck by lightning shortly
thereafter.
Actually, according to the secretary there, the
antenna was donated by an alumnus who wanted
the church administrative office to be able to get
good TV reception. Sure enough, there's a big TV in
there that gets great reception.
