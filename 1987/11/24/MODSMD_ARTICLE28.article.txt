## Psychologist's theory unifies behavior 
### Mari Yamaguchi 
You meet a new person who reminds
you one of your best friends, and you
find yourself attracted to that person.
You are in the middle of a midterm, and
a question a lot like one on a previous as
signment is easy for you.
According to Psychology Prof. Roger
Shepard, behavior like this may demon
strate the existence of a universal psy
chological law governing behavior.
Shepard, who said he was inspired by
Newton's universal law of gravitation,
has proposed a "universal law of
generalization" for psychology.
In calling the law "universal,"
Shepard suggested that the law applies
to any animals, wherever they may have
evolved on Earth.
He said he thinks psychologists must
always search for general principles
when studying behavior. "We never
confront exactly the same situation
twice, so we somehow have to base our
behavior on similarity," Shepard said.
In order to establish psychology as a
quantitative science, psychologists have
tried to determine the relationship be
tween the probability of an animal's
response and the degree of difference
between similar but separate behavioral
situations, Shepard said.
Qualitative studies of generalization in
psychology began around the turn of the
century, when Ivan Pavlov conducted
his now-famous experiments on the con
ditioned responses of dogs. Pavlov
trained dogs to salivate when he
sounded a bell by repeatedly feeding
them after the bell rang.
In subsequent experiments, Pavlov
demonstrated that such trained dogs
would salivate not only at the sound of a
bell but also at other sounds. He also
found that amount of saliva was greater
when the sound was more similar to the
original sound.
Following Pavlov's example, behav
ioral researchers have traditionally used
physical measures of stimulus difference

for their experiments â€” such as the dif
ference in the wavelength of light, tone
frequency or the angular orientation of a
shape.
In general, researchers have found,
the more difference there is between two
sounds or two colors, the less similiar
are the two resulting behavioral
responses.
According to Shepard, psychologists
have been unable, however, to consis
tently describe the results of their ex
periments mathematically or physically.
The reason for this, Shepard ex
plained, is that any mathematical func

tion describing a given experiment will
vary depending on experimental
specifics, such as the training stimulus
or the species of animal used.
Some experiments may be accurately
described by functions that show a con
sistently less intense response when the
stimulus moves farther away from its
original form, but most actual experi
ments show more complicated mathe
matical results, Shepard said.
A pencil, for example, looks more like
itself when rotated ISO degrees than
when turned just 90 degrees; likewise,
tones sound more alike if they are ex

actly an octave apart than if they are
slightly less than an octave apart, ac
cording to Shepard.
He said such results have led many
psychologists to doubt that there is a
universallaw of generalization.
In a recent article, Shepard argues
that what is required in behavioral ex
periments is not more or better data, but
rather a different conception of the prob
lem.
The article, published in the Septem
ber 1987 issue of Science magazine and
titled "Toward a Universal Law of
Generalization for Psychological Sci
ence," explains that Isaac Newton
arrived at universal laws of motion only
by departing from Aristotle's and
Ptolemy's choice of the earth as a fixed
reference. Newton chose a more
abstract framework.
"I said in my dissertation in 1955 that
we had to use a psychological measure
of dissimilarity in order to get an in
variant law," Shepard said.
He said that what he uses to obtain a
psychological measure of stimulus dis
tance is something called "nonmetric
multidimensional scaling."
It was not until in 1962, when he first
obtained access to computers, that
Shepard was able to test his multidimen
sional scaling idea on data from many
laboratory experiments on generaliza
tion, he said.
Shepard explained that his early ex
periments used data from his own ex
periments on human learning responses
to colors, as well as information from
other psychologists' experiments on
animals ranging from pigeons to
humans.
In his color experiments, Shepard col
lected data from 36 people as they
learned associations between nine differ
ent shades of red that had been arbitrar
ily assigned numbers from one to nine.
In his experiments, Shepard has found
that the same curve, relating probability
of generalization to psychological dis

tance between stimuli, emerged no mat
ter what species or type of stimuli he
used.
In addition to finding a consistent
curve describing all of his data, Shepard
said he can also explain the shape of that
curve mathematically.

Shepard said he thinks
psychologists must al
ways search for general
principles when studying
behavior. 4 We never
confront exactly the
same situation twice, so
we somehow have to
base our behavior on
similarity/ he said.

Shepard added that he is also inter
ested in studies of the generalization
process of very different species, such
as fish and insects, which have not been
investigated yet.
According to Shepard, it is difficult to
prove that a law of generalization exists
in our day-to-day lives because consis
tent results are quantifiable only under
controlled laboratory experiments.
He stressed, however, that "we are
obeying the law whenever we try to
decide whether a new stimulus belongs
in the same class that shares some im
portant consequence, such as food or
danger."
Tne universal law of generalization
governs behavior, something which is al
ready built into human mental capabili
ties through day-to-day experience,
Shepard explained.
