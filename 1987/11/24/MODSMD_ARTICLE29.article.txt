## Card vies for volleyball title 
### 
Wendi Rush never gambles when she goes
to Reno.
As Stanford's setter, Rush finds that getting
the hall to middle blocker Nancy Reno is the
safest bet she can make. The payoff has been
25 wins and a record 17-game Pacific 10 win
ning streak.

Soon Rush, Reno and the rest of the Stan
ford women's volleyball team will ante up for
the biggest jackpot of all.
It's the NCAA Championship, a title that
has long eluded the Cardinal. Stanford is the
perennial bridesmaid, having been the only
team to reach the final four each of the last
five years and yet finishing second in two of
the last three NCAAs. The players are tired of
seeing other suitors get the ring; this year they
want it for themselves.
However, unlike past years when Stanford
has entered the tournament as the favorite, it
will be tabbed as a dark horse at best. Hawaii
and Pacific are considered the class of the
country, with the Cardinal leading a second
echelon that includes UCLA and BYU and is
considerably ahead of regional powers Ne
braska, Illinois, Colorado State and Texas.
Stanford, though, may be more contender
than pretender.
The Cardinal is peaking. Much like last
year, when they surprised everyone but them
selves by streaking to the final four, the Stan
ford players seem to be hitting their stride at
the right time.
They're coming off a big weekend that in
cluded three-game victories over USC and
UCLA and will wind up their schedule with
two games at No. 1 Hawaii over Thanksgiv
ing.
The games could well be more important
for Hawaii than Stanford. The Cardinal ap
pears to have the inside track on a top seeding
in the NCAA West Regional and may even
host the tournament. The Rainbow Wahines,
meanwhile, are dueling No. 2 Pacific for the
top spot in the Northwest Regional, and their
seeding may be determined by their perform
ance against Stanford.
It may seem a bit incongruous that the best
two teams in the country would be placed in
the same regional, but that's the way the
NCAA volleyball tournament has been run
since last year, when teams began to be as
signed to regions by geography rather than by
ranking.
The change was instituted to lessen the
West Coast's dominance of the sport. Before
the new rule was made, a team from the Mid
west had about as good a shot at making the
final four as Equatorial Guinea does of win
ning the Olympic gold medal in basketball.
The new system both helps and hurts the
Cardinal. It helps in that only one of the top
two teams will reach the final four, but it's no
boon to Stanford to play in a regional that in
cludes the four teams ranked third through
sixth in the latest national polls.
The West Regional will be a dogfight, but
Stanford Coach Don Shaw has a veteran team
that's no stranger to high-pressure competi
tion.
Stanford will go as far as its three seniors.
Rush, Reno and Teresa Smith, can take it.
Now in her final season, Reno is having the
best campaign of her Stanford career. Always
a solid player, Reno has upped her level of
play a notch or two and is perhaps the key to
Stanford's title drive. As teams have concen
trated on Smith, last season's Pac-10 Player
