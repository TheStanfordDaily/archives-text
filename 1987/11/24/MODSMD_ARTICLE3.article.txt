# Heller suggests research program
## Overseas Studies considers China 
### Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
The Office of Overseas Studies
may establish a research program
in mainland China that would dif
fer significantly from the pro
grams it currently runs, if an idea
of Overseas Studies Director
Thomas Heller proves workable.
Heller confirmed last night that
University officials are in the
"earliest stages" of exploring the
possibility of establishing a pro
gram in C hina that "would focus
on joint (Stanford-China) re
search groups," instead of fol
lowing the office's longtime
policy of maintaining classroom
based overseas campuses.
The program would connect a
handful of Stanford students and
professors with Chinese scholars
and would not be based in a par
ticular location, Heller said.
"There are already a number
of faculty members who are
doing research in China. We
could expand (those efforts) at
the margins where it would be
useful to faculty members," he
said.
Heller, who stressed that the
idea remains embryonic, said
that "when you move into a new

environment you have to think
about new ways of arranging
things."
Heller said he plans a fact
finding visit to China as early as
this summer but added that "the
odds of the trip producing any
thing substantial are slim."
Undergraduate Research Op
portunities (URO) would be
invited to cooperate in forming
the program, according to Over
seas Studies Deputy Director
Nancy Padgett, but URO has not
yet been involved in discussions
about the idea.
A Stanford expansion into
China would be consistent with
Overseas Studies' effort to diver
sify its West European focus,
begun when Heller took over as
director in 1985. The office
closed Stanford's Vienna
campus, established a center in
Krakow. Poland, and is complet
ing plans for programs in Latin
America and Kyoto, Japan.
Heller pointed out that the
soon-to-be-established Latin
America and Japan programs will
also emphasize undergraduate
research, but will follow a
"different model" because they
are larger, centralized programs.
The Chinese are "very enthu

siastic" about the establishment
of a Stanford program in their
country. Heller said, because
they see it as an opportunity to
obtain access to U.S. technology
and training. Stanford's interest,
however, would be in gaining
cultural understanding. Heller
said. "I don't like that asym
metry," he added.
"I'm not comfortable with a
program where it would be per

ceived that the point (of it) is a
trade." he said. When asked if
those divergent motives could be
overcome, Heller said, "Hon
estly, I don't know."
Heller said he wants to make
sure he doesn't "create expecta
tions in the mind of the Chinese
that we could follow through
Iwith a center on the scale of the
Kyoto project]."
The Kyoto center is "a
massive undertaking," Heller
said, and the Chinese "don't un
derstand how much the Japanese
have put into that effort."
According to Education Prof.
Martin Carnoy. several Stanford
departments are involved in re
search on technology transfer to
China, and the University stands
poised to become a leader in that
area, which he called "a rapidly
growing field" in which "there is
no leader."
Carnoy, who met with a high
level delegation of Chinese offi
cials here Friday to discuss the
impact of modernization on
China's social values, said the
possibility of Stanford beginning
a program there was "mentioned
by the delegated"
