# Difficult end to season for James
## 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
There was one Stanford senior
standing on the sidelines during
the Cardinal's 31-7 victory over
California who wasn't quite as
exuberant as some of his
teammates were.
Star wide receiver Jeff James,
one of the top players in the
country at his position, was
forced to sit out the final game of
his college career with a severely
pulled groin muscle suffered two
weeks earlier at USC.
"It was frustrating and kind of
disappointing/' James said.
"Everyone else was out there
having a good time, and I really
wanted to be a part of it."
"He's probably really disap
pointed," said former Stanford
quarterback John Paye, now with
the San Francisco 49ers, who
missed the last game of his senior
year himself because of a
shoulder injury. "I was really
disappointed when I couldn't
play in my final game, and I feel
for him."
James is a good bet to join
Paye in the professional ranks
next year, however, and couldn't
take the risk of reinjuring the
muscle if he played. "I made the
decision for later on, " he said,
"because there was a strong risk
of pulling the muscle again. I
really couldn't sprint or ac
celerate, and if you can't do that
you can't play football."
Professional scouts have their
eye on James, a Los Angeles
native, but haven't had much of a
chance to rank him because of
his injury. "I like him as a
receiver," Los Angeles Raiders'

scout Ron Wolf said, "but it's
difficult to evaluate a guy when
you haven't seen him work out.''
James should be ready to pjay
by the Jan. 16 East-West Shrine
game in Stanford Stadium, and
scouts will get a good opportu
nity then to see the Cardinal's
fourth all-time leading receiver in
action. James received an invita
tion to play in the college all-star
game yesterday."It looks pretty
realistic that I'll be ready to go
then, and I'm hoping to play
well," he said.
There is little doubt among
those who have seen James play
that the 6-foot, 186-pound
reciever is professional material.
"He has the intelligence and the
desire to play the game," said
Stanford receiver coach Dave
Baldwin, who predicted that
James will be drafted in the first
three rounds of the spring draft.
"He's a complete receiver, and
his name will be up there in the
professional ranks for a number
of years."
"He's got all the tools," said
Stanford quarterback Greg En
nis, who also believes his
teammate will be snatched up in
the first three rounds. "A guy
who can catch the ball that well
in traffic, has great speed, good
height, runs perfect routes all the
time. . . . He's a good one, I can
tell you that."
So good, in fact, that James
was an honorable mention Ail-
American last year and a candi
date for All-America honors this
season. He finished with 154 re
ceptions for 2265 yards and 16
touchdowns during his Stanford

Wide receiver Jeff James finished fourth in Stanford career receptions, receiving yardage
and touchdown receptions. He also ended up sixth in Pac-10 career receptions.
career. James is sixth on the
Pacific-10 all-time career recep
tion list.
Even so, James is not as cer
tain about the draft as his
teammates. "1 wish 1 could share
everybody's optimism," he said.
"I'm kind of learning that you
can't take everything for granted.

and you can't expect that .kind of
thing. Whatever happens, I'll
have to be satisfied."
Whichever team drafts James
should be satisfied with its selec
tion. The senior economics major
is the kind of reciever quarter
backs love. "He makes up for a
lot of mistakes a quarterback
makes," Ennis said.
"He was one of my favorite
receivers," Paye said. "When
ever we needed anything like a
touchdown, or we had third and

long, we looked to J.J. He's a big
play receiver."
James is also popular with run
ning backs, but for an ability one
often doesn't associate with
receivers. "As a running back 1
really appreciate his blocking
ability on sweeps," said Stanford
running back Brad Muster,
James missed his last game at
Stanford when he had to sit out
Big Game, but as Ennis said,
"That's not his final football
game, for sure."
