# Women's hoops brings high hopes
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
One month ago, when the women's
basketball team began practicing,
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer felt
she had a long row to hoe to cultivate
a championship-caliber team.
The preseason nrognosticators
have not shared ner pessimism.
Street and Smith s annual college
basketball poll rated the Cardinal
20th out of all Division 1 teams, while
USA Today placed the women in the
22nd spot. In addition, coaches
predicted that Stanford, 4-14 overall
and 8-10 in league last year, will
finish third in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
After Stanford garnered the
second-best recruiting team in the
country, which joined 1987 Pac-10
All-Freshman team members Jenni
fer Az/.i and Katy Steding, as well as
preseason Honorable Mention Ail-
American senior Kami Anderson and
the rest of a strong Stanford squad,
the acclaim hardly surprised anyone.
Except VanDerveer and the team,
that is. While some programs accept
polls as gospel, the Stanford squad
refuses to take all the hype seriously.
"1 really think you have to take it
with a grain of salt," Steding said. "1
know we have the potential to be bet
ter than that. It's a matter of gelling."
The Cardinal coach concurred. "I
think we should be in the top 20 by
the end of the year," she said.
"Where we are right now, that's just
hype, just someone looking at the

players you have — but don't really
know anything that's going on."
"But I think the significant thing
about it is that Stanford, I think, in
the past five years is the only team to
be a new team in the top 20," Van-
Derveer said. "It's always just like
football: Every year they shuffle
them up and throw them out. Stan
ford is one of the only new kids on
the block. We're predicted to be a
sleeper or a Cinderella story," she
added.
Stanford's schedule is neither a
fairy tale nor a dream come true.
Starting on the road this weekend and
opening its home season during win
ter break, the Cardinal's confidence
certainly won't come from crowd
support.
"Our schedule this year is stronger
than last year's," the coach noted.
"We're playing a lot of strong teams
on the road. This year's schedule is
very good.
"I wish I could believe we could
beat those teams [we'll play], but
honestly no team on our schedule
falls in that category," VanDerveer
said. "We're not at the top of a
mountain looking down at anyone,
we're at the bottom looking up the
mountain. We're climbing a pretty
big hill."
Though the climb may be great, the
Cardinal has some pretty strong
mountaineers. Even ignoring the
highly touted group of freshmen, the
squad has more talent than some
coaches could even dream of having.
Anderson is perhaps the jewel in

the Cardinal crown. She led the team
in scoring last year with an average of
13.4 points per game, and her career
total of 1013 points places her in a tie
for sixth place on the Stanford all
time scoring list. The senior is also
strong defensively, second on the
1987 squad with 5.1 rebounds per'
game.
Stanford's other starting forward
last year was Steding. The sopho
more proved to be a defensive tower
of power, leading the team with an
average of 8.7 rebounds per game and
a total of 243 for the season . No
slouch on offense, she averaged 11.1
points per game and in eight different
games last year reached double fig
ures in both scoring and rebounding.
This feat is very familiar to Azzi as
well. The Oak Ridge, Tenn., native
averaged 9.1 points per game, and
rewrote all the assists records: 16 in
one game and 165 in the season for a
6.1 average. In addition, Azzi re
corded the first triple-double in Stan
ford history at BYU last year (14
points, 16 assists, 10 rebounds), only
the second woman ever to do so in
the Pac-10.
Junior Jill Yanke rounds out the list
of talented returnees who are ex
pected to start this season. The 6-
foot-5 center averaged 10.2 points per
game, many due to a baseline turn
around fadeaway that she has artfully
employed.
The freshman class is equally as
dynamic, featuring five players who
could all could start in the near future
and will definitely receive playing

time.
Atop the pack is 5-8 Sonja Hen
ning, who will assume the role of
starting point guard as Azzi moves to
shooting guard. Last year's Associ
ated Press and UPI Player of the
Year in Wisconsin (as well as her
state's "Miss Basketball ") Henning
averaged 24.6 points per game, 9.2
rebounds, 5.4 assists, four steals and
five blocks over the course of her
high school career.
Take into account the remaining
eight members of the squad, each im
pressive in her own right, and the
top-20 ranking comes into perspec
tive. It is also easy to see that with a
little work Stanford has a reasonable
chance to take the Pac-10 title.
"The top of the Pac-10 — and
we're shooting for the top — is USC
and Washington," VanDerveer said.
"Those teams are very strong with
good returning players and played in
the NCAA (tournament]. Oregon
also played in the NCAA.
"Those three teams are sitting up
there, and we're looking at them and
saying, 'What do we have to do to
beat them?' It's a very physical
league, and you also have to be con
sistent."
"In a lot of leagues, one or two
teams just go through and beat every
one," she said. "In the Pac-10, you
can be beat by anybody, because the
other teams are not that far off the
pace. We have the potential to beat
anyone in our league, but at the same
time we could lose to anyone in our
league,"

she had a long row to hoe to cultivate
a championship-caliber team.
The preseason nrognosticators
have not shared ner pessimism.
Street and Smith s annual college
basketball poll rated the Cardinal
20th out of all Division 1 teams, while
USA Today placed the women in the
22nd spot. In addition, coaches
predicted that Stanford, 4-14 overall
and 8-10 in league last year, will
finish third in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
After Stanford garnered the
second-best recruiting team in the
country, which joined 1987 Pac-10
All-Freshman team members Jenni
fer Az/.i and Katy Steding, as well as
preseason Honorable Mention Ail-
American senior Kami Anderson and
the rest of a strong Stanford squad,
the acclaim hardly surprised anyone.
Except VanDerveer and the team,
that is. While some programs accept
polls as gospel, the Stanford squad
refuses to take all the hype seriously.
"1 really think you have to take it
with a grain of salt," Steding said. "1
know we have the potential to be bet
ter than that. It's a matter of gelling."
The Cardinal coach concurred. "I
think we should be in the top 20 by
the end of the year," she said.
"Where we are right now, that's just
hype, just someone looking at the

players you have — but don't really
know anything that's going on."
"But I think the significant thing
about it is that Stanford, I think, in
the past five years is the only team to
be a new team in the top 20," Van-
Derveer said. "It's always just like
football: Every year they shuffle
them up and throw them out. Stan
ford is one of the only new kids on
the block. We're predicted to be a
sleeper or a Cinderella story," she
added.
Stanford's schedule is neither a
fairy tale nor a dream come true.
Starting on the road this weekend and
opening its home season during win
ter break, the Cardinal's confidence
certainly won't come from crowd
support.
"Our schedule this year is stronger
than last year's," the coach noted.
"We're playing a lot of strong teams
on the road. This year's schedule is
very good.
"I wish I could believe we could
beat those teams [we'll play], but
honestly no team on our schedule
falls in that category," VanDerveer
said. "We're not at the top of a
mountain looking down at anyone,
we're at the bottom looking up the
mountain. We're climbing a pretty
big hill."
Though the climb may be great, the
Cardinal has some pretty strong
mountaineers. Even ignoring the
highly touted group of freshmen, the
squad has more talent than some
coaches could even dream of having.
Anderson is perhaps the jewel in

the Cardinal crown. She led the team
in scoring last year with an average of
13.4 points per game, and her career
total of 1013 points places her in a tie
for sixth place on the Stanford all
time scoring list. The senior is also
strong defensively, second on the
1987 squad with 5.1 rebounds per'
game.
Stanford's other starting forward
last year was Steding. The sopho
more proved to be a defensive tower
of power, leading the team with an
average of 8.7 rebounds per game and
a total of 243 for the season . No
slouch on offense, she averaged 11.1
points per game and in eight different
games last year reached double fig
ures in both scoring and rebounding.
This feat is very familiar to Azzi as
well. The Oak Ridge, Tenn., native
averaged 9.1 points per game, and
rewrote all the assists records: 16 in
one game and 165 in the season for a
6.1 average. In addition, Azzi re
corded the first triple-double in Stan
ford history at BYU last year (14
points, 16 assists, 10 rebounds), only
the second woman ever to do so in
the Pac-10.
Junior Jill Yanke rounds out the list
of talented returnees who are ex
pected to start this season. The 6-
foot-5 center averaged 10.2 points per
game, many due to a baseline turn
around fadeaway that she has artfully
employed.
The freshman class is equally as
dynamic, featuring five players who
could all could start in the near future
and will definitely receive playing

time.
Atop the pack is 5-8 Sonja Hen
ning, who will assume the role of
starting point guard as Azzi moves to
shooting guard. Last year's Associ
ated Press and UPI Player of the
Year in Wisconsin (as well as her
state's "Miss Basketball ") Henning
averaged 24.6 points per game, 9.2
rebounds, 5.4 assists, four steals and
five blocks over the course of her
high school career.
Take into account the remaining
eight members of the squad, each im
pressive in her own right, and the
top-20 ranking comes into perspec
tive. It is also easy to see that with a
little work Stanford has a reasonable
chance to take the Pac-10 title.
"The top of the Pac-10 — and
we're shooting for the top — is USC
and Washington," VanDerveer said.
"Those teams are very strong with
good returning players and played in
the NCAA (tournament]. Oregon
also played in the NCAA.
"Those three teams are sitting up
there, and we're looking at them and
saying, 'What do we have to do to
beat them?' It's a very physical
league, and you also have to be con
sistent."
"In a lot of leagues, one or two
teams just go through and beat every
one," she said. "In the Pac-10, you
can be beat by anybody, because the
other teams are not that far off the
pace. We have the potential to beat
anyone in our league, but at the same
time we could lose to anyone in our
league,"
