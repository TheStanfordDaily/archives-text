# Crippling conditions in Carolina
## Kuhnle ninth at nationals 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff Writer 
After an unbroken series of
victories in regattas this fall,
Stanford sailing team senior Tom
Kuhnle finally discovered what a
sailboat looks like from behind
this weekend, finishing ninth at
the Singlehanded National
Championships in Charleston,
SC.
Although Kuhnle had proven
himself the best of the West in
qualifying regattas earlier this
season, facing the nation's top 16
sailors proved overwhelming.
"The fleet was extremely
deep; you couldn't just blow by
people the way you can in some
regattas," Kuhnle said.
Indeed, the skipper who won
the regatta both of the last two
years could only finish second
this year, losing to this year's
Pan American Games gold medal
winner. Both had a nard time
beating the third-place skipper,
who is the current World Youth
champion, and the fourth-place
finisher, who is this year's Laser
class national champion.
In addition to intense competi
tion, Kuhnle had to battle
Charleston Harbor's demanding

conditions. The site of the regatta
featured a vicious current that
constantly threatened to sweep
competitors into the Atlantic. In
order to race in the tide-swept
area, the fleet had to wait for hieh
winds that allowed them to make
progress against the current.
When the needed breeze came,
it lowered temperature levels to
below freezing, which left the
skippers fighting both to keep
upright and to keep warm.

'It was a brutal regatta:
My hands were bleed
ing, my legs ached, and
my feet were numb/

"It blew 25-30 knots (about 30-
35 mph) on Friday, and I don't
think I've ever gone faster in a
sailboat," Kuhnle said.
According to Kuhnle, it was
difficult to finish consistently in
the talented fleet and adverse
conditions. Too often, he said,
small mistakes translated into big
losses at the finish line.
"I had some trouble with fouls
and capsizes, and they really
hurt. When I tried to make up for

mistakes by doing something
drastic, though, it usually didn't
work. Shooting the moon just
didn't pay off," he said.
Stanford Sailing Coach Blake
Middleton also emphasized the
challenges Kuhnle Faced at the
regatta, and said that in a lighter
breeze, Kuhnle might have
finished a good deal higher in the
standings.
"The guys Tom was sailing
against are definitely some of the
very best sailors around, and he
had to sail against them in less
than-optimal conditions. If the
wind had been under 15 knots or
so, he could have stayed up at
the top. As it was, he had a tough
time staying in the top five,"
Middleton said.
With last weekend's regatta,
Kuhnle said goodbye to col
legiate singlehanded sailing.
From now on, he said, he will
join the rest of the team in its ef
forts to win the doublehanded
and team nationals at the end of
the spring.
"It was a brutal regatta: My
hands were bleeding, my leas
ached, and my feet were numb.
From now on I'm only going to
do civilized sailing in Flying
Juniors," Kuhnle said.
