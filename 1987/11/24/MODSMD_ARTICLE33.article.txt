# Pac-10 little men play big
## 
### 
If you enjoy ballhandlers and shooters, then
you might want to mosey on down to ol" Roscoe
Maples Pavilion over the next few months.
That red-roofed concrete tent will play host to
a bounty of darn tootin' good little guys from the
Pacific 10 Conference who can scurry with the
best of em and can throw up three-pointers as
well as chummy Bobby Knight can throw a
tantrum.

I'm talking about guards. The Pac-10 has a
slew of talented point men, penetrators and
shooters this season. The quality of games in the
conference over the past few years just hasn't
measured up to other conferences, and if that
continues this season, at least we'll be able to
watch some little guys light it up.
The smallest of the backcourt men may be the
most exciting one. Arizona State's 5-foot-9
senior Arthur Thomas will move out of the
shadows of graduated Sun Devil sharpshooter
Steve Beck and into the hearts of Pac-10 fans.
The tiny Thomas reportedly has a vertical leap
of 46 inches and can dunk with authority. But
there will be more to the Sun Devil attack — 50

inches more.
Junior college transfer Joey Johnson (brother
of Celtic guard Dennis Johnson) reportedly has a
50-inch vertical leap and will probably join
Thomas in the backcourt. Rumor has it Thomas
and Johnson are working on a leapfrog fast
break.
Down in cactus country it is no longer a
rumor: Arizona guard Steve Kerr has returned
from the severe knee injury he suffered in the
summer of 1986. Kerr was the best field general
in the conference before his injury, and now he's
18 months wiser.
The 6-3 senior is not flashy. He controls the
ball, bombs away well and above all executes
the team offense. Do not underestimate the im
portance of execution — I believe every losing
coach in the history of athletics has said "We
didn't execute very well."
The city of Los Angeles will bring the Pooh
and Pendleton show into Maples over Christmas
break. UCLA junior Pooh Richardson may be
the best in the conference at leading the fast
break, and his hair style is always interesting.
While everyone will be watching Pooh, you
might want to sneak a peak at Bruin freshman
Gerald Madkins. Madkins could deprive senior
guard Dave Immel of some running time.
You've heard of Pooh, but does the name
Pendleton ring a bell? It's Anthony Pendleton of
USC. The 6-4 redshirt freshman is a bit of a se
cret in the Pac-10 — he accompanied Trojan
coach George Raveling when Raveling left lowa
