# W. Culture debate continues
## Speakers criticize Area One 'alienation' 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz,
speaking out against proposed
cnanges in the University's
Western Culture requirement,
said last night that careful exam
ination of the "dominant culture
of white, heterosexual males" is
necessary as a preliminary step
toward understanding other
cultures.
"Alienation informed by the
knowledge of its source can
make more effective politics for
making society better," Rebholz
said in a five-person debate on
recommendations made this fall
by the Western Culture Task
Force urging greater representa
tion of non-European cultures in
Western Culture tracks.
Rebholz, who teaches in the
Literature and Fine Arts track,
said the benefits of the current
Western Culture program come
from understanding both the pos
itive and negative contributions
of its primarily white, male
European perspective. He de
scribed the curriculum as "an act
of psychoanalysis. We can
liberate ourselves from it when
we know it. We must know the
enemy in order to defeat it."
Junior Marc Pizarro, however,
said the current Western Culture
program is "untruthful, alienat
ing and incomplete" and should
follow the task force's recom
mendations to include texts by
women and minorities in its cur
riculum.
The Faculty Senate is sched
uled to vote on the proposal at its
Jan. 25 meeting.
Pizarro said there was a gen
eral feeling of exclusion among
members of the Stanford
Chicano community as a result of
the Western Culture curriculum.
"Imagine the alienation, the
seclusion and the pain that many
of us felt when we came to this
great institution of learning and
discovered that all that our par
ents had stood for doesn't mat
ter," Pizarro said.
He said the task force recom
mendations are important if the
program is to abide by the
"absolute necessities of equality
and truth in education."
Senior Jake Madden, a resi

dent assistant in Madera who
took the Great Works track as a
freshman, agreed with Rebholz,
saying "constructive changes
can only come from within the
system. To make changes you
have to be able to argue and
speak the language."
But Spanish and Portugese
Prof. Sylvia Wynter, who has
developed and proposed an alter
native program focusing on
"North American" culture, said:
'Whoever controls the words
and systems of meaning controls
the social order. Knowledge is
never neutral, and all curricula
perform a function."
"This curriculum is the ex
pression of the American idea of
a nation," she said. "Europe
cannot help us â€” she does not
have the problem of having to
deal with various cultures."
Wynter added that one can
know the world only from spe
cific frames of reference. The in
clusion of additional perspec
tives, she said, is the only way in
which one can come to a fuller
understanding of the world.
Also speaking at the forum was
sophomore Canetta Ivy, who en
rolled in an alternative Western
Culture class last spring. The
course was offered on a one-time
basis and covered several sec
ondary readings by women and
minorities not on the core list of
works now required for all
tracks.
"I was fortunate enough to
hear the other side and found
myself exposed to a world I
didn't know existed," said Ivy,
chair of the Black Student Un
ion's Western Culture Commit
tee. "Many students felt the al
ternate view increased their abil
ity to analyze all of this, which
we didn't get from Western Cul
ture."
History Prof. Paul Seaver,
who chairs the task force and
teaches in the Values, Technol
ogy, Science and Society track,
said the goal of the task force is
to "channel the changes " within
the curriculum.
"We haven't proposed courses
in cultural anthropology, but
rather those that reflect the pres
ent day and complexities of the
current West," he said.
