# Tax changes hurt art contributions
## 
### Angie Kim Staff writer 
Last year's reform of the
federal tax code may have had a
tremendous impact on the quality
and quantity gifts of art to col
leges, including Stanford.
According to Susan Roberts-
Manganelli, Stanford Art
Museum registrar, there has been
a 50-percent decrease in gifts of
art to Stanford in the past year .
"This is a drastic change from
last year, when we received more
artwork — about 150 direct gifts
of art,'' she said. "It's been very
slow this year."
She said there seems to be a
direct correlation between gifts
of art and taxes. "There is al
ways an influx, a swelling, of
gifts at the end of the year when

people start doing taxes," she
said.
"But I don't know how it will
be this year with the tax
change," she said. "Maybe it'll
cause people not to donate as
much even at the end of the
year."
Prof. John Shoven, chair of the
Economics Department, said two
fundamental tax-law changes
may be discouraging people from
donating material objects to
schools: changes in the tax rate
and the alternate tax minimum.
Before the tax change, the
value of artwork to be declared
for tax purposes was legally its
value at the time of the donation,
not its value at the time of the
purchase. This encouraged
people to donate appreciated
property to institutions for tax
purposes.

Shoven said, however, that the
increase in tax rates has made
donation of appreciated property
less attractive. "The tax rates
have been lower, and there's
been an increase in tax cost for
people that want to donate gifts
— it's more expensive now," he
said.
The main change in the tax
code is the application, for the
first time, of the alternate tax
minimum (ATM) to art dona
tions. The ATM taxes the differ
ence between the value of a prop
erty at the time of purchase and
its value at the time of donation.
In calculating the ATM, the
new law requires that all artwork
be appraised by a professional
appraiser for the donation and
that the appraiser be accountable
for the value they set.
Manganelli said this change is

probably responsible for the fact
that there has been a decrease in
material gifts, but not monetary
donations to Stanford for the
Arts Department.
"It's definitely made a differ
ence," she said. "But we're still
getting significant art pieces by
purchasing them with monetary
funds given from donors."
"There used to be quite a bit of
marginal quality art gifts," she
said. "Now, we get the works
that we want with the money
we're getting."
"It might be the state of eco
nomy — it could be a coinci
dence that the art works are not
being donated to institutions as
much this year, but I am
speculating that the tax changes
have a lot to do with the
decrease," Shoven said
