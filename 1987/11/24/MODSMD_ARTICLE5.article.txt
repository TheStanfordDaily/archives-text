# Campbell criticizes budget agreement
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
The $30 billion deficit reduc
tion package agreed upon Fri
day by congressional leaders
and President Reagan is "un
satisfactory" because its
spending cuts do not meet the
minimum goals set forth by the
Gramm-Rudman Act, Law
Prof. Tom Campbell told the
Stanford College Republicans
last night.
Campbell, who is attempt
ing to unseat first-term Rep.
Ernie Konnyu in the June 1988
Republican primary for the
12th Congressional District,
said the $180 billion federal

deficit could not be eliminated
without "attacking it from two
sides."
"The problem with the
Republicans is that some
members aren't willing to talk
about taxes at all," said
Campbell. "They hand the
issue to the Democrats."
The Gramm Rudman Act
would have automatically ini
tiated $23 billion in across-the
board spending cuts if the con
gressional efforts had failed.
Under the new plan. $21 bil
lion in cuts this year will be
augmented by a $9 billion tax
increase.
