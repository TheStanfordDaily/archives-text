# Campbell criticizes budget agreement
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
The $30 billion deficit reduc
tion package agreed upon Fri
day by congressional leaders
and President Reagan is "un
satisfactory" because its
spending cuts do not meet the
minimum goals set forth by the
Gramm-Rudman Act, Law
Prof. Tom Campbell told the
Stanford College Republicans
last night.
Campbell, who is attempt
ing to unseat first-term Rep.
Ernie Konnyu in the June 1988
Republican primary for the
12th Congressional District,
said the $180 billion federal

deficit could not be eliminated
without "attacking it from two
sides."
"The problem with the
Republicans is that some
members aren't willing to talk
about taxes at all," said
Campbell. "They hand the
issue to the Democrats."
The Gramm Rudman Act
would have automatically ini
tiated $23 billion in across-the
board spending cuts if the con
gressional efforts had failed.
Under the new plan. $21 bil
lion in cuts this year will be
augmented by a $9 billion tax
increase.


Richard Murphy/Daily
l.au Prof. Tom Campbell, a candidate for the Republican nomi
nation for the 12th Congressional District, argues against the
latest congressional budget agreement in a forum at the Law
School yesterday sponsored bv the Stanford College Republicans.
Campbell's proposal would
retain the 52.1 billion in Gramm-
Rudman cuts and add $22 billion
in revenue through excise taxes
on oil, tobacco and alcohol.
Taxing those commodities, he
said, would least harm entre
peneui ship.
Though he has not yet adopted
a position on the deficit package,
Kbnnyu has repeatedly stated his
"Unconditional" opposition to
increasing taxes to balance the
budget.
Campbell warped his audience
of 30 students at the Law School
that, unless he is the Republican
nominee, the Democrats could
defeat a "vulnerable" Konnyu
and gerrymander the 12th Dis
trict in IWO so that the current

edge enjoyed by the GOP in that
district will be lost "until the
year 2000."
In other points raised during a
question-and-answer session,
Campbell said the following:
• On the Strategic Defense Initi
ative: "Its concept is very
humane. But it violates the ABM
treaty, which prohibits the
deployment of new kinetic and
exotic technologies."
• On foreign policy: "I am a lib
ertarian. Policy decisions should
be made by determining our eco
nomic advantage, not whether
we like a government or not."
• On drug testing: "As a judge. I
would not find drug testing by
private organizations, when
there is a demonstrated need, un
constitutional. As a legislator, I
would support the right to
privacy."
