Pre-election violence wracks Haiti
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Waves of violence that left at
least one person dead and scores injured swept through Port-au-
Prince yesterday, apparently aimed at disrupting Sunday's
planned presidential election, Haiti's first in 30 years.
An elderly man was clubbed to death early in the morning by
a gang of arsonists who chased sleeping food-sellers out of the
capital city's third-largest covered market, injuring dozens of
them, before spreading gasoline and burning the 90-year-old
Salomon Market to the ground.
According to a witness interviewed by the Los Angeles
Times, a second man was shot to death and another wounded by
a gunman who threw the body of the unknown victim into a car
and raced away.
In other incidents that continued into the early afternoon,
armed men fired on and attempted to burn the new headquarters .
of the independent Electoral Council, shot at the headquarters
of two leading presidential candidates, assanlted a group of
squatters in an abandoned house, blockaded many roads with
burning tires and drove through downtown streets firing gun
shots in the air. A major electoral office responsible for
municipal elections also was sacked.
For the first time since general strikes were called in July,
most shops and stores in downtown Port-au-Prince were shut
tered. and many families kept their children home from school.
As with previous incidents of pre-election terrorism, the
army-led provisional government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy
made no visible effort to stop the violence. After hundreds of
terrorized stall-keepers in the Salomon Market were herded out
screaming and the building was set alight, one army trooper in a
five-man police post across the street said that he and his
comrades saw and heard nothing.
Aide informs on Deaver lobbying
WASHINGTON — A White House staff member testified
yesterday that former deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver
called him at home to discuss briefly a Puerto Rican tax issue for
which Deaver was lobbying.
"Clearly, in my view, Mr. Deaver was weighing in on this
issue," Steven Danzansky, a National Security Council aide,
said of the contact in 1985. Danzansky was the 35th witness to
testify at Deaver's perjury trial in U.S. District Court here..
Danzansky's account of Deaver's telephone call was similar
to testimony by other administration officials whom Deaver is
accused of lobbying. As did the other witnesses, Danzansky
said that the contact was brief and that Deaver made no effort to
sway him.
"In that call, he just asked how things are going, didn't he?"
said Stephen Braga, a defense lawyer.
"Yes," Danzansky replied.
Deaver is accused of lying to a congressional subcommittee
and a federal grand jury in saying he could not recall key lobby
ing contacts that he made with officials of the administration
after he left the White House in May 1985.
Securities merger may be coming
NEW YORK — Securities (giants E.F. Hutton Group and
"indications of interest" from an unspecified number of suitors
about buying all or a portion of the company. l •»
Hutton, dogged by weak earnings and legal problems in
recent years, disclosed early yesterday morning that it had been
approached about the possible acquisition. Shortly after noon,
Shearson announced that Hutton had approached Shearson ex
ecutives about a takeover, and company officials said later that
talks had already begun.
In a statement, Hutton said it had directed its financial ad
visers to "pursue discussions with prospective investors and ac
quirers as part of the board's review of strategic alternatives."
Shearson, a unit of American Express Co., said it believes that
Hutton "could represent an attractive and complementary addi
tion to our organization."
Hutton and Shearson began merger talks in October 1986 but
Hutton broke them off a month later because it considered
Shearson's $50-a-share, $1.6 billion offer too low.
A merger between the two would continue the consolidation
of major Wall Street investment houses and would create a com
pany with huge capital resources. Together, the two have $4.8
billion in capital, which would put them ahead of Salomon Inc.,
now No. 1 in capital resources with about $3.5 billion.

on Sunday.
