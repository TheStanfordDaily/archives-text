# Cuban inmates take hostages
## 
### 
ATLANTA — Cuban inmates
fighting deportion to their
homeland staged a bloody riot at
the federal penitentiary here yes
terday, seizing dozens of
hostages and setting fire to the
prison.
At least one prisoner was
killed, according to unconfirmed
reports. Several local hospital of
ficials reported admitting dozens
of Cubans — eight suffering gun
shot wounds, along with two
prison guards who were slightly
injured.
In Washington, Attorney Gen
eral Edwin Meese 111 offered a
moratorium on returning any of
the refugees to Cuba soon in an
effort to help quell the Atlanta
riot and regain control of the
federal detention center in
Oakdale, La., where inmates
were holding hostages for the
third day and threatening to kill
them if their demands were not

met.
Meese promised that before a
renewed U.S.-Cuba agreement
goes into effect, the inmates
would first be given "a full, fair
and equitable review" of their
cases.
The Oakdale riots began the
day after the Reagan administra
tion announced an agreement
with the Cuban government for
the return of about 2500 of the es
timated 125,000 refugees who
came here during the 1980 Mariel
boatlift. There are about 1400
Cuban detainees in Atlanta — as
well as 200 American prisoners at
the facility — and another 1000
Cubans in Oakdale.
The Atlanta disturbance broke
out shortly before II a.m., as
prisoners seized control of the
dilapidated 63-year-old building,
setting fire to a warehouse area.
At about 3:30 p.m., gunfire
erupted from inside the prison.

according to witnesses, one of
whom said "it sounded like a
popcorn popper."
Throughout the day, thick
clouds of dark grey smoke rose
from the facility, but fire depart
ment officials would not allow
firefighters to go into the prison
until their safety could be
guaranteed. Instead, several
helicopters with 2000-gallon can
nisters swooped over the prison,
dropping water in an effort to
fight the raging fires.
At about 7:30 p.m., fire depart
ment officials decided to send 60
firefighters inside, with police es
corts.
Atlanta Fire Chief W.H.
Hamer told reporters that a great
deal of wood was used in the con
struction of the prison, making it
a virtual tinderbox in some loca
tions.
The antiquated institution,
considered one of the most dan

gerous prisons in the country,
was difficult to secure. And the
job was made tougher because
the prisoners reportedly had bro
ken up into at least 19 factions,
controlling different portions of
the prison.
A dozen ambulances were
lined up outside the three-story
grey stone prison, and through
out the day, attendants carried
out the wounded in stretchers.
City police, Georgia state
police, and several psychologists
shuttled in and out of the prison,
but oficials refused to brief the
dozens of reporters and
prisoners' relatives camped out
across the street from the prison.
However, several family mem
bers brought a portable radio and
tuned it to a frequency that
allowed them to hear conversa
tions between police and the
inmates.
