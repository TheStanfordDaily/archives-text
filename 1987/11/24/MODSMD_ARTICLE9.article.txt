# Salvadoran rights case erupts
## 
### 
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Presi
dent Jose Napoleon Duarte charged yester
day that former army Maj. Roberto
D'Aubuisson, a rightist leader long accused
of ties to clandestine death squads, ordered
the 1980 assassination of the Roman Catholic
Archbhisop of San Salvador.
Duarte said that the driver of the killer's
car has provided "absolutely accurate" tes
timony implicating D'Aubuisson and a
former army captain in the murder of Msgr.
Oscar Arnulfo Romero.
"The case of Msgr. Romero is solved. We
know who gave the order and who carried out
the execution," Duarte said.
Romero was shot to death on the pulpit of
the Divine Providence Hospital chapel as he
said Mass on the evening of March 24, 1980.
He had denounced widespread military re
pression and the killing of thousands of
peasants, students, church and union
workers by rightist death squads.
The archbishop's death is one of the most
emotional and politically charged human
rights cases in El Salvador and the only one

specifically omitted from a new amnesty law
that pardons political crimes.
Duarte's announcement coincided with the
return to El Salvador of leftist political
leaders who are allied with guerrillas fighting
to oust his U.S.-backed government.
Guillermo Ungo, president of the civilian
Revolutionary Democratic Front returned
yesterday and Ruben Zamora, vice president
of the front, arrived Saturday. Both have
been in exile for seven years.
Five of the Revolutionary Democratic
Front leaders were slain by death squads in
1980 and diplomats have warned that Ungo
and Zamora could become the targets of
rightist extremists.
The leader of a small social democratic
party newly allied with Ungo and Zamora's
front said yesterday that he has received
three death threats in the last 10 days. Mario
Reni Roldan said that four armed men in ci
vilian dress arrived at the house of his ex-wife
yesterday morning warning him to break his
alliance.
Duarte suggested at a press conference that

reopening the Romero killing could add to the
risk to the returning leftist leaders. He said
there is a danger "that these persons ac
customed to killing will assassinate someone.
I have great fear that something might happen
because there are persons who could pay for
this act by the government."
Duarte denied Sunday that the timing of
the Romero testimony was politically
motivated to counter the return of Zamora
and Ungo. He said then that the left rather
than the right may try to kill them to create
martyrs.
Zamora, who has worn a bullet-proof vest
since arriving three days ago, angrily rejected
Duarte's claim and said it was "carte blanche
for the extreme right to kill us. Anything that
happens, the president has already said who
is responsible."
Duarte, meanwhile, claimed the Romero
investigation as a personal political victory
and likened the lengthy case to the investiga
tion into the killing of John Kennedy in the
United States.
