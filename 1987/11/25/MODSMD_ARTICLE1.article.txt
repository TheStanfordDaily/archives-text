### Haru Connolly Senior staff writer 
Seniors will have an opportunity next quarter to
take a new Western Culture course taught by Stan
ford emeriti and senior faculty, according to
Charles Junkerman, assistant to the dean of
Humanities and Sciences.
Enrollment in the elective history course, "The
Origins of Modern Society," will be restricted to
seniors, Junkerman said.
"This is a special offering to the graduating class
of 1988," he said. "If there are spaces left, we will
open it up to juniors, then sophomores, then fresh
men."
Expected enrollment is "anyone's guess,"
Junkerman said, but organizers have reserved a
History Corner room that seats about 200 students.
Although course organizers did not poll seniors,
Junkerman said about 30 to 40 seniors expressed in
terest in the course's announcement in a sum
mertime University mailer. "That's a pretty good
indication," he said.
Junkerman said the course follows a traditional
approach to teaching Western Culture and does not
incorporate the recommendations of the Area One
Task Force, which seek to broaden the focus of the
University's requirement.
"You can have many readings of Western cul
ture," he said. "This is not the reading, but a possi
ble one of many."
"It is more traditional than some of the present
tracks, but some lectures will reflect modern con
sciousness," Junkerman said. Those lectures in
clude such topics as "Women, Cities, East and
West" and "Europe and the Rest of the World."
History Prof. Paul Seaver, who chairs the Area
One Task Force has no trouble with the format of
the new course. "It is an elective and not re
quired," he said.
"It has been put together by emeriti faculty, who
have a right to teach what they wish," Seaver said.
"Besides, half the charm is simply a chance to see
faculty who are no longer teaching in the Univer
sity."
Students may elect to only attend lectures for one
unit, pass/no credit or attend lectures and a discus
sion section for three units, graded or pass/no
credit. "We want to be as flexible as possible,"
Junkerman said.
Funded by a $300,000 grant from the Ford Foun
dation, the course will be offered this year only.
"We're doing this as a treat to graduating seniors,"
said Emeritus History Prof. Wayne Vucinich, who
developed the course. "If this is successful, we will
repeat it."
According to Junkerman, the 22 professors who
will teach the course will give lectures relating to
their research interests. "These will be big subjects,
not the bitty details. It should be fun." Examples of
subjects covered by each lecture include Rome and
the Renaissance.
Vucinich called those giving the course "top
notch — the best that Stanford has."
"Some of these names will be familiar to stu
dents," he said, noting that English Prof. Bill Chace
and History Prof. David Kennedy will give lectures.
Informal gatherings between students and emeriti
will be possible in this course, Vucinich said.
Although Vucinich said he has had this course in
mind "for years," it was not until last year, when
he spoke to then-Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee about establishing the course, that
the idea really got off the ground.
"I knew of many brilliant emeriti who would
teach," Vucinich said. "I also hear nothing but
regret Ifrom alumnil that they did not take Western
Culture in their senior year."
