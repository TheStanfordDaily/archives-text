Milan Kundera should know something about
thankfulness for intellectual freedom. An impor
tant voice in the "Prague Spring," the brief re
naissance of the arts in Czechoslovakia in 1968,
Kundera was forced out of his job and eventu
ally into exile.
He relocated to France, in what one would
think a good move for a writer of his political
mettle. Yet he has encountered at times a West
that is sadly lethargic, disinterested in maximiz
ing the open discourse its constitutions atford.
The right of expression, when unchallenged,
ceases to be cherished, he argues; a million
phrases of freedom spoken in a Western univer
sity are not worth a single one uttered in the
Eastern block.
Tomorrow, our Thanksgiving, may catch us
outside for a long walk or toss of a football,
raking leaves or bringing in firewood, or gath
ered around a table with friends and family, full
of talk and story. That these simple activities are
longstanding American liberties goes unex

amined for most of us. But a day of feast and
relaxation should also be one of contemplation.
At Stanford, we have the privilege of shaping
ourselves in an atmosphere of academic open
ness unrealized in most parts of the globe. Our
voices can be heard; we have no need to shout
over the sound of invading tanks.
Yet all too often Stanford students, particu
larly at his time of the quarter, raise their col
lective voices to whine about the difficulty of
their life here, what with exams and papers and
problem sets to be done. It's easy to feel sorry
for yourself and lose sight of the fact that every
one at Stanford is enjoying resources and oppor
tunities for personal and academic enrichment
unheard of in many foreign countries and un
matched in most of the rest of the United States.
To fully appreciate Stanford we must respect
the freedom of our birthright that makes it possi
ble. And then, perhaps, our millions of words
will regain their meaning.
