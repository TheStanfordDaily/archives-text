# Prejudice nothing but ignorance
## 
### 
It was my third year in the dorms, and I ap
proached the doorway of my new room with
the usual excitement tinged with trepidation
that meeting a new roommate evokes in me. I
distinctly remember my exact thoughts as I
stepped through the door and shook hands
witn my roommate for the year: "My God,
he's black," quickly followed by, "Does it
matter?" A pause, then 1 thought, "No," and
over the next year 1 was proud of myself that
I could learn to dislike him as a person.

' m Actually, that's not quite true. As a person.
Pete was really an okay guy, as I found out
when I ran into him in later years, but as
roommate he was . . . well, a freshman.
Maybe there is something to the idea of put
ting all the freshmen in roughly one spot as
they do on this campus: but in any case, at
least at the beginning of that year, life with
Pete was problematical.
' Pete was a guy with a lot of drive, but un
fortunately, that drive didn't seem to have a
whole lot of focus. He lifted weights daily,
played trumpet in the jazz band, took his re
sponsibilities in ROTC quite seriously and
was taking the usual heavy load demanded of
an engineering major. He spent a lot of really
late nights trying to keep up in all of his activ
ities. Because he was a heavy sleeper, he had
a great deal of trouble waking up in the morn
ing. Which was why, I suppose, he felt the
need for two mechanical alarm clocks.
I don't know, maybe it sounds petty, but
such is the stuff that roommate feuds are
made of. I hated those clocks. I mean the in
cessant "tick, tick, tick" of one such clock is
bad enough, but when you have two of them
you get the rhythms of each machine going in
and out of alignment all night long. That beat
frequency proved unendingly fascinating to
the physics major that I was, and sleep, con

sequently, often seemed just beyond my
reach because of those stupid clocks.
Oh, 1 tried to get the message across to
Peter that 1 thought his clocks were really an
noying. But, having never shared a room with
anyone before, he didn't seem to be able to
pick up on my hints, no matter how blatant
they were ("Hey, Pete, do you really need to
use both those clocks?") Fortunately for my
sanity, his clocks did not long survive the
abuse they got when they woke him for his 6
a.m. Thursday morning ROTC drills, and by
the end of the first quarter they were both,
happily, dead. He had switched to using a
mercifully silent clock radio.
Actually, by the end of the year, Pete had
become quite a conscientious and con
siderate roommate — we cannot, fortunately,
remain freshmen forever — but we never
managed to establish much more than a
(thankfully quiet) detente. The usual lesson
about prejudice had been learned, however.
It seems like such a stale, trite point to be
making in the 1980s, but it's a lesson 1 know
I've had to learn with every prejudice I have.
It's a lesson that seems to have been forgot
ten or never learned by some elements on this
campus. People are people.
Vacuous? Try this: Blacks are people.
Asians are people. Jews are people. Gays are
people. Not much better, 1 know, but I have
had close relationships of one type or another
with members of each of these groups, and
the only thing that I've been able to deter
mine with any certainty is that there really is
no correlation between race, religion or
sexual orientation and how well we are going
to like each other.
The point is that once you've really had a
chance to know a member of group X, to see
his or her worthiness, as well as his or her im
perfections, and finally, to acknowledge in
your heart his or her essential humanity, you
can no longer maintain the fiction that every,
or indeed any, member of that group is all
that different from anyone else.
Confronting your prejudice is uncomfort
able. I remember the first time that I went to
a get-together with some of my homosexual
friends and had to witness (horror of horrors)
same-sex couples casually holding each other
as we talked. I felt like I was watching some

sort of optical illusion and that if I was just
patient enough, each couple would resolve it
self into the "correct" male/female ratio.
Confronting prejudice from others is un
comfortable. 1 once met a really nice woman
in Japan, and we fell in love for a time. When
she was visiting my family the next summer,
we attended church that first week, picking
up Grandma on the way as usual. It was
pretty chilling to watch my own grandmother
realize that we were more than just friends
and have her react by refusing to attend
church with us thereafter while my girlfriend
was around.
Yes, prejudice is uncomfortable. But it is
also wrong. It is based on the fallacy that an
other group is irreconcilably different, if not
essentially inferior. We are taught subtly yet
thoroughly that such differences and in
feriorities exist. I can remember my other
wise socially liberal mother telling me to lock
the car doors when we had to drive through
certain sections of Oakland when I was
young. Funny, Pete never did pull a knife on
me, despite the image of "those dangerous
blacks" that such incidents gave me. I could
see him short-sheeting someone's bed, but
never something like that.
Prejudice is ultimately no more than ignor
ance, and it is a sick kind of ignorance at that.
Yeah, I know it's pretty tfite to be saying that
we should not tolerate prejudice; however,
it's pretty clear that there do exist some
restricted groups on this campus. If there is
any kind of universal moral imperative, it is
the imperative that such restrictions be
fought wherever they emerge.
Such fallacious, unjustified isolation is the
spawning pit of fear, hatred and prejudice
motivated violence. It is only by being af
forded the opportunity to meet, know and
yes, live with members of those groups with
which we feel uncomfortable that such preju
dice can be conquered. Furthermore, it is my
opinion that it is only when we begin to con
front our prejudices on a personal, individual
level that we can even begin to take strides to
combat the effects such prejudice has on our
community, our nation and our world.

It was my third year in the dorms, and I ap
proached the doorway of my new room with
the usual excitement tinged with trepidation
that meeting a new roommate evokes in me. I
distinctly remember my exact thoughts as I
stepped through the door and shook hands
witn my roommate for the year: "My God,
he's black," quickly followed by, "Does it
matter?" A pause, then 1 thought, "No," and
over the next year 1 was proud of myself that
I could learn to dislike him as a person.

' m Actually, that's not quite true. As a person.
Pete was really an okay guy, as I found out
when I ran into him in later years, but as
roommate he was . . . well, a freshman.
Maybe there is something to the idea of put
ting all the freshmen in roughly one spot as
they do on this campus: but in any case, at
least at the beginning of that year, life with
Pete was problematical.
' Pete was a guy with a lot of drive, but un
fortunately, that drive didn't seem to have a
whole lot of focus. He lifted weights daily,
played trumpet in the jazz band, took his re
sponsibilities in ROTC quite seriously and
was taking the usual heavy load demanded of
an engineering major. He spent a lot of really
late nights trying to keep up in all of his activ
ities. Because he was a heavy sleeper, he had
a great deal of trouble waking up in the morn
ing. Which was why, I suppose, he felt the
need for two mechanical alarm clocks.
I don't know, maybe it sounds petty, but
such is the stuff that roommate feuds are
made of. I hated those clocks. I mean the in
cessant "tick, tick, tick" of one such clock is
bad enough, but when you have two of them
you get the rhythms of each machine going in
and out of alignment all night long. That beat
frequency proved unendingly fascinating to
the physics major that I was, and sleep, con

sequently, often seemed just beyond my
reach because of those stupid clocks.
Oh, 1 tried to get the message across to
Peter that 1 thought his clocks were really an
noying. But, having never shared a room with
anyone before, he didn't seem to be able to
pick up on my hints, no matter how blatant
they were ("Hey, Pete, do you really need to
use both those clocks?") Fortunately for my
sanity, his clocks did not long survive the
abuse they got when they woke him for his 6
a.m. Thursday morning ROTC drills, and by
the end of the first quarter they were both,
happily, dead. He had switched to using a
mercifully silent clock radio.
Actually, by the end of the year, Pete had
become quite a conscientious and con
siderate roommate — we cannot, fortunately,
remain freshmen forever — but we never
managed to establish much more than a
(thankfully quiet) detente. The usual lesson
about prejudice had been learned, however.
It seems like such a stale, trite point to be
making in the 1980s, but it's a lesson 1 know
I've had to learn with every prejudice I have.
It's a lesson that seems to have been forgot
ten or never learned by some elements on this
campus. People are people.
Vacuous? Try this: Blacks are people.
Asians are people. Jews are people. Gays are
people. Not much better, 1 know, but I have
had close relationships of one type or another
with members of each of these groups, and
the only thing that I've been able to deter
mine with any certainty is that there really is
no correlation between race, religion or
sexual orientation and how well we are going
to like each other.
The point is that once you've really had a
chance to know a member of group X, to see
his or her worthiness, as well as his or her im
perfections, and finally, to acknowledge in
your heart his or her essential humanity, you
can no longer maintain the fiction that every,
or indeed any, member of that group is all
that different from anyone else.
Confronting your prejudice is uncomfort
able. I remember the first time that I went to
a get-together with some of my homosexual
friends and had to witness (horror of horrors)
same-sex couples casually holding each other
as we talked. I felt like I was watching some

sort of optical illusion and that if I was just
patient enough, each couple would resolve it
self into the "correct" male/female ratio.
Confronting prejudice from others is un
comfortable. 1 once met a really nice woman
in Japan, and we fell in love for a time. When
she was visiting my family the next summer,
we attended church that first week, picking
up Grandma on the way as usual. It was
pretty chilling to watch my own grandmother
realize that we were more than just friends
and have her react by refusing to attend
church with us thereafter while my girlfriend
was around.
Yes, prejudice is uncomfortable. But it is
also wrong. It is based on the fallacy that an
other group is irreconcilably different, if not
essentially inferior. We are taught subtly yet
thoroughly that such differences and in
feriorities exist. I can remember my other
wise socially liberal mother telling me to lock
the car doors when we had to drive through
certain sections of Oakland when I was
young. Funny, Pete never did pull a knife on
me, despite the image of "those dangerous
blacks" that such incidents gave me. I could
see him short-sheeting someone's bed, but
never something like that.
Prejudice is ultimately no more than ignor
ance, and it is a sick kind of ignorance at that.
Yeah, I know it's pretty tfite to be saying that
we should not tolerate prejudice; however,
it's pretty clear that there do exist some
restricted groups on this campus. If there is
any kind of universal moral imperative, it is
the imperative that such restrictions be
fought wherever they emerge.
Such fallacious, unjustified isolation is the
spawning pit of fear, hatred and prejudice
motivated violence. It is only by being af
forded the opportunity to meet, know and
yes, live with members of those groups with
which we feel uncomfortable that such preju
dice can be conquered. Furthermore, it is my
