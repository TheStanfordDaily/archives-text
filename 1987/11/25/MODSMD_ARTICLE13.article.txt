## Death penalty is not acceptable 
### 
A few months ago the United
States Supreme Court rendered a
decision upholding the death
penalty for a black man con
victed of killing a white police of
ficer in Georgia. But although the
legal issues of the McCleskey
case are not necessarily applica
ble to other death row prisoners,
Jhe effect of the decision has
been to cast the first stone in a
growing number of other execu
tions that had been on hold until
the McCleskey case was
decided.

; Unlike executions of ancient
or even relatively recent times,
most of these are occurring not in
public hut behind closed doors,
in the early morning hours while
most Americans sleep. As the ex
ecutions become routine they
will slip deeper into the morning
papers. But although many
Americans regard executions as
an unpleasant but necessary
function of government — like
garbage collection — these kil
lings are beginning to disturb our
neighbors.
Amnesty International, the
London-based international hu
man rights organization that was

awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1977 was awakened to the situ
ation early. Amnesty's leader
ship decided to put its growing
popular support in the United
States on the line this year by
openly opposing the death
penalty in the United States.
Amnesty, well-known and al
most universally acclaimed for
its work with prisoners of con
science, opposes the use of
torture and the death penalty in
all cases everywhere, and has for
a long time. But this year it has
decided to bring the international
pressure usually directed toward
repressive regimes in scores of
countries around the world to
bear on the United States.
The many arguments Amnesty
advances against the death
penalty include the intellectually
but not emotionally satisfying le
gal ones and the economic (life
imprisonment is cheaper than ex
ecution) ones that are doubtless
true but seem aimed at moral
midgets.
The fact that the mentally
retarded and even minors can be
executed in the United States
(but not in Libya, South Africa or
the Soviet Union) is shameful.
And a look at the evidence about
the death penalty's effectiveness
as a deterrent will lead many to
doubt that murderers consider

the consequences of their crimes
before they act.
However, it seems to me that
the acceptability of the death
penalty is more a question of
human nature, of justice and of
morality, although perhaps not in
the way that most Americans (if
they think about it at all) perceive
it to be.
It has been said that
Americans love the death penalty
(we are the only Western indus
trial nation to retain it) and even
convince ourselves that we need
it.
And yet to allow the death
penalty even for the worst crimes
and in the clearest cases of guilt
invites its abuse for other ends,
such as political and religious re
pression. It has in Malaysia —
where execution is mandatory
for possession of small quantities
of drugs — even become a form
of murder by proxy where busi
ness or political rivals work as
hard at planting drugs on their
enemies as smugglers do at con
cealing their contraband.
But even supposing the pun
ishment does fit the crime, how
can we be sure that it fits the
criminal? Isn't it a fundamental
American tradition to risk
sparing some of the guilty in or
der to avoid punishing some of
the innocent? The American

jurist Learned Hand wrote that
he should like to have every
court begin "I beseech ye in the
bowels of Christ, think that we
may be mistaken." Granted, the
time an innocent person spends
in prison cannot be repaid. But
we can, while he still lives,
restore his freedom.
And what of the victim's life?
Does executing the killer restore
that? "The old law of an eye for
and eye," said Gandhi, "leaves
the whole world blind."
If we must make an example of
some criminals (for in fact we do
not sentence all murderers to die,
and we execute an unlucky hand
ful of those we condemn), let it
be the example we really want to
teach. Perhaps it is too much to
ask that we give up wanting to
kill someone who has committed
some horrible crime. We may
lust for vengence, but its con
summation is incompatible with
civilization.
The model of behavior we
must embrace as society is one in
which no matter how much we
may want to take a human life,
either in passion or cold blood or
as punishment for a crime, we
stop ourselves. We don't do it,
ever.
