One parking lot
for all students
1 have another opinion on the
student parking problem. To
pave over yet more land, as your
editorial (Daily, Nov. 11) sugges
ted, would he a big mistake,
ecologically and aesthetically. It
also does not make sense to take
away employees' spots. Em
ployees need a place to park on
campus, since few of us live here
or live close enough to bicycle,
whereas on-campus students
don't need to use cars on a daily
basis.
When I was a student at Yale
there was one parking garage for
all on-campus students to use.
Yale has an urban campus, and
there is no space to build parking
lots next to each dorm, so the ga
rage is at the edge of campus, and
it is a 15- to 35-minute walk to the
dorms. Few students, conse
quently, bothered to have cars at
school. Perhaps Stanford stu
dents who really feel they need to
keep a car can reflect on the Yale
situation before complaining
about having to walk a few extra
feet when parking.

Program ought to
enhance thinking
1 would like to suggest that the
purpose of the Western Culture
program should be to enhance
ability of students to think criti
cally about current affairs.
In the long run, we could give
incoming students a choice of a
variety of tracks that would
cover the full spectrum of their
diverse interests and back
grounds. But for the moment we

can best achieve our aim by con
centrating on the way the exist
ing tracks are taught. I suggest
that the faculty should devote
more time to lectures rather than
sections and that the students
should devote more time to
writing rather than reading.
The teaching of Western Cul
ture involves a degree of subjec
tivitiy not found in the sciences.
The "Conflict and Change"
track of two years ago is not the
same as the present one. Math 43
undoubtedly is.
In Western Culture, the com
munication of the lecture's con
tent is more important than the
content itself. A student who un
derstands well the professor's
viewpoint can pass his own judg
ment on it. The professors should
be given the chance to teach
whatever excites them most, so
that they convey their message in
the best possible way. Any in
crease in lecture time relative to
section time could help in that.
However, 1 know of many tracks
in which exactly the reverse is
happening and would like to
voice my strong opposition to it.
Another way to enhance the
critical skills of students would
be to emphasize in-depth analy
sis of only two major readings
per quarter. Right now, the stu
dents have to spend a lot of time
just to be able to peruse of their
weekly readings. By contrast, if
they had to read carefully one
major book every month and
write a paper on it they would
focus more on the faculty and
each other.
The teaching of Western Cul
ture should be done with our
aims in mind. Making plans for
the material covered in the future
is fine, so long as it does not
divert our attention from the way
it is taught now. Otherwise we
will be worse off.
