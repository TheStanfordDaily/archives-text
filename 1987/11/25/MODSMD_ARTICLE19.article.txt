## Projects located in Pakistan, India and Africa Medical student puts his skills to work abroad 
### Matt Werdegar 
In Africa's rural Sierra Leone,
where local doctors practice
magic and mysticism, young
American volunteers work tire
lessly to improve the health of
the local villagers.
In a rustic medical clinic in an
Afghan refugee camp in Pakis
tan, grizzled old men with long
white beards comfort their young
grandchildren, who are about to
receive modern health care for
the first time.
What both these scenes have
in common is Stanford medical
student Chris Grover. While
most students spend their sum
mer vacations at home working
part-time jobs or simply whiling
away the hours, Grover has
spent the past two summers
working to promote health care
far from his home in America.
Grover has volunteered his
time to medical development
work in Africa, India and Pakis
tan. Most recently he helped to
perfect a new test for filariasis, a
parasitic disease that afflicts 1 (K)
million people in developing na
tions.
He has also worked in a

remote region of Sierra Leone,
referred to in the 19th century as
"white man's graveyard" due to
the numerous tropical diseases
that plague the area. There
Grover helped develop a grass
roots medical infrastructure. He
also spent several weeks in an
Afghan refugee camp helping to
resupply rural health clinics and
train medics.
In addition to gaining valuable
medical experience, Grover has
encountered his share of ad
ventures during the course of his
work abroad.
He has contracted malaria; ex
plored Freetown, the capital of
Sierra Leone; run into gun-toting
Afghan rebels while jogging; dis
cussed policy with the head of
public health for an entire prov
ince of India; and has worked
with volunteers from across the
United States and Europe.
Before going to Africa for the
first time, Grover said, he had
only vague notions of what he
wanted to do for a career. Today,
despite the dangers posed by this
line of work, Grover said he is
convinced that his future lies in
international health.
"Going overseas made it com

pletely clear to me that I wanted
a career in medicine," he said.
His chosen field, he said, of
fers the greatest challenges and
the greatest rewards to a person.
"There are an incredible num
ber of diseases in the developing
world that were wiped out long
ago in the more developed na
tions — like leprosy, malaria and
polio," Grover said.
"That's what's so crazy about
international health — that so
many people die of diseases for
which there are simple cures. It's
not an easy problem to solve, but
it's tragic that it hasn't been.
"I'm incredibly privileged, as
an American going to an elite
school like Stanford, but five bil
lion other people in the world
aren't nearly so privileged. I feel
an obligation to help those people
out, and health care is one of the
more useful ways of doing that."
Grover explained that with the
right attitude most people adapt
to the varied and primitive condi
tions prevalent in developing na
tions.
He said he believes that
working in these areas provides a
global experience unattainable in
California. The experience of
working with Afghan refugees,
for example, provided him with
insight into a radically foreign
culture, he said. "It was an abso
lutely different world and an ex
tremely interesting window into
Islam."
While admitting that many
people may not be suited for de
velopment work, Grover said
working in medicine abroad pro
vides important experience for
any potential medical student.
"The experience you gain in a
clinic in a developing country in a
short time is amazing," he said.
Grover got his start in interna
tional health through an organi
zation called Operation Cross
roads Africa, based in New
York.

Crossroads sends about 200
college undergraduates to Africa
to do work rural development
projects for six-week periods.
Approximately 10 Stanford stu
dents participate in the program
each year.
Grover worked with Cross
roads in Sierra Leone the sum
mer after his junior year. He
spent the second half of that sum
mer working in the Ivory Coast
with International Health
Services, a group based in East
Palo Alto, whose president is
Stanford Medical School Associ
ate Prof. Charles Beal.
In Pakistan, Grover worked
for the International Medical
Corps in a volunteer position he
obtained with the help of Dr.
Donald Nagel, an orthopedic sur
geon at the Medical School.
All of these organizations offer
valuable opportunities for Stan
ford students, Grover said.
"Stanford encourages you to
take your own direction, not to
follow anybody else's track — to
decide what you want to do and
start doing it. If you want to do
something, the support is here,
and there is a great deal of
flexibility, like being able to stop
out," Grover said.
On the institutional level, the
University is also getting more
involved in the Held of interna
tional health. The Medical
School today offers numerous re
search projects in developing
countries and is working to set up
a permanent research program in
Chiapos, Mexico.
Unlike other medical schools,
Stanford encourages students to
take the wide variety of courses
needed to prepare for interna
tional health work.
"International health care is a
highly interdisciplinary field,"
Grover said. "You need to know
languages, politics, economics,
how to do basic research, as well
as clinical medicine. The medical

school here gives you the oppor
tunity to take courses outside of
medicine, which is very unus
ual."
The Medical School also
makes grants available to help
fund this type of international
work. Grover said that financial
aid from the University helped
pay for his work abroad.
An undergraduate research
grant, however, partially funded
his summer in Africa, while a
Public Service Summer Fellow
ship for $ 15(H) funded the greater
part of his summer in India and
Pakistan.

"Stanford is great because
there are so many resources and
opportunities here." Grover said
of the support he received to
pursue his development work.
Grover will be showing slides
of his work in Africa and Pakis
tan around campus next quarter.
"I meet many students inter
ested in pursuing public service
work overseas. My slide shows
are a simple way of conveying to
them that improving people's
health is one crucial way they
can become involved in the de
veloping world and make a differ
ence," he said.



Working abroad for the pas! two summers convinced medical student
Chris Grover to pursue a career in international health.
