## Barbra Streisand goes 'Nuts' 
### Marc Borsak 
In one or two scenes of the
new movie, "Nuts," Barbra
Streisand looks almost incredibly
sexy. She's playing Claudia
Draper, a high-class prostitute
who makes quite a healthy living.
All was well and good when
Claudia was raking in over
$ KM),000 a year net, but that was
before she killed one of her
clients in self-defense. The ques
tion in this film is not whether or
not Mrs. (yes, Mrs.) Draper is
guilty of murder, it's whether
she's competent to stand trial.
You see, everyone thinks poor
Claudia is slightly off the wall.
She occasionally has violent out
bursts (usually justifiable), she
will sometimes become totally
silent, and at other times she will
lapse into her prostitute persona
when it is slightly inappropriate
(during the hearing, for instance).
In any case, almost the entire
film takes place during the

hearing to decide whether or not
Claudia is nuts — hence the title.
Unfortunately, a courtroom
hearing (not even a trial, for
God's sake) doesn't cut it for a
big movie.
The flashbacks and revelations
in which we learn of Claudia's
troubled childhood and her
career are often more intriguing
than the film itself. In fact, there
may have been a better film left
unexplored in those flashbacks.
Streisand is the star of this
film, and her performance is
definitely star material. She
never stops being Barbra
Streisand for a minute. We never
believe that we're seeing any
thing other than Barbra Streisand
playing a character, but we're
impressed by her performance
nonetheless.
Streisand spouts her sexually
explicit, cold-blooded, strong
woman dialogue with relish, and
her violent outbursts are con
vincing, as is her mental anguish
when her childhood is dredged

up. Also, during the flashbacks
of her recent past, she looks ter
rific.
Richard Dreyfuss gives a good
performance as Claudia's attor
ney, but he doesn't have much
material to work with. We are
drawn into his character in the
beginning, but the screenwriters
lose sight of him as soon as he
and Claudia team up. Their rela
tionship has potential, which also
goes largely unexplored; and
Dreyfuss' character becomes just
another good-guy movie attor
ney.
The film was adapted from
Tom Topor's Broadway play,
and that is one of its fundamental
problems. Screenwriters Tom
Topor, Darryl Ponicsan and Al
vin Sargent have not opened it up
enough to make it into a satisfac
tory film. About two-thirds of
'Nuts" is spent in the court
room, often in long stretches of
15 to 20 minutes. This material
probably had extremely strong

impact on stage, but something
more creative than simply insert
ing five or six brief flashbacks
should have been done to make it
suitable for the screen.
The film's second fundamental
problem is that we are never
really forced to call Claudia's
sanity into question, except for
the first 15 or 20 minutes. The au
dience knows that she is simply a
strong woman who has become
cynical and distrustful because of
her harsh life. The movie
pretends not to know this,
though.
"Nuts" is an actresses' movie,
and that is probably why
Streisand may win an Oscar for
this role. After all, she lets her
self look worn during most of the
movie.
"Nuts" is an interesting idea,
but other than the kick of seeing
Streisand in some sexy photos
and in her somewhat interesting
portrayal of Claudia Draper,
"Nuts" just doesn't have what it
takes for a good movie.

lapse into her prostitute persona
when it is slightly inappropriate
(during the hearing, for instance).
In any case, almost the entire
film takes place during the

hearing to decide whether or not
Claudia is nuts — hence the title.
Unfortunately, a courtroom
hearing (not even a trial, for
God's sake) doesn't cut it for a
big movie.
The flashbacks and revelations
in which we learn of Claudia's
troubled childhood and her
career are often more intriguing
than the film itself. In fact, there
may have been a better film left
unexplored in those flashbacks.
Streisand is the star of this
film, and her performance is
definitely star material. She
never stops being Barbra
Streisand for a minute. We never
believe that we're seeing any
thing other than Barbra Streisand
playing a character, but we're
impressed by her performance
nonetheless.
Streisand spouts her sexually
explicit, cold-blooded, strong
woman dialogue with relish, and
her violent outbursts are con
vincing, as is her mental anguish
when her childhood is dredged

up. Also, during the flashbacks
of her recent past, she looks ter
rific.
Richard Dreyfuss gives a good
performance as Claudia's attor
ney, but he doesn't have much
material to work with. We are
drawn into his character in the
beginning, but the screenwriters
lose sight of him as soon as he
and Claudia team up. Their rela
tionship has potential, which also
goes largely unexplored; and
Dreyfuss' character becomes just
another good-guy movie attor
ney.
The film was adapted from
Tom Topor's Broadway play,
and that is one of its fundamental
problems. Screenwriters Tom
Topor, Darryl Ponicsan and Al
vin Sargent have not opened it up
enough to make it into a satisfac
tory film. About two-thirds of
'Nuts" is spent in the court
room, often in long stretches of
15 to 20 minutes. This material
probably had extremely strong

impact on stage, but something
more creative than simply insert
ing five or six brief flashbacks
should have been done to make it
suitable for the screen.
The film's second fundamental
problem is that we are never
really forced to call Claudia's
sanity into question, except for
the first 15 or 20 minutes. The au
dience knows that she is simply a
strong woman who has become
cynical and distrustful because of
her harsh life. The movie
pretends not to know this,
though.
"Nuts" is an actresses' movie,
and that is probably why
Streisand may win an Oscar for
this role. After all, she lets her
self look worn during most of the
movie.
"Nuts" is an interesting idea,
but other than the kick of seeing
Streisand in some sexy photos
and in her somewhat interesting
portrayal of Claudia Draper,
"Nuts" just doesn't have what it
takes for a good movie.
