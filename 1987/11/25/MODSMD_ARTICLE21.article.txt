# Remembering a good Gaieties
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
When a loved one dies, we hold a cere
mony to remember them by. That analogy
has absolutely nothing to do with this article,
but we had to have some kind of introduc
tion. Thus, while mourning the passing of an
other Gaieties, here are some things by which
to remember "Nightmare on Palm Street":
Remember this name: Torrence Boone.
He's got an unforgettable name anyway, but
freshman actor Boone had one of the most
memorable Stanford debuts in some time.
This young talent, who reminds one of a
dancing Eddie Murphy, showed great comic
timing in the "All My Freshmen" dorm
scene, and played Masculine Studies teacher
I.M. Hanginlow in a perfect take-off on Billy
Joel's "Uptown Girl" video.
Remember this scene: "The Bursar of
Seville," the opera send-up that is being
called the best Gaieties scene ever, was the
unquestionable highlight of the show.
Besides being right on target (Student: "How
do you know my adviser didn't sign my study
list?" Study List Lady: "Because he is my
lover."), the scene also had the distinction of
having subtitles small enough as to be un

readable by the obnoxious yet lovable Bran
ner frosh in the balcony on Friday night.
Remember these cameos: All surfers take
note. This year's Gaieties featured the
world's first cameos by Jan and Dean. No,
not the singing group, we're talking about
Janet from the 21st century and Dean Sel
domridge from the Bookstore. For those of
you who didn't go to last year's Gaieties,
Janet (played by Brooke Ramel) was the main
character in last year's Gaieties, which, coin
cidentally, also didn't have a plot. Seldom
ridge, the wonderful lady who is a smiling
fixture at the Bookstore, came out and saved
the Gaieties Bookstore scene, which was
about to go belly up.
Remember these songs: I don't even re
member the words, but I can't get the tune of
"Nightmare on Palm Street," the opening
song, out of my head. Maybe therapy would
help. "You Can't Understand the Words to
this Song," a song whose lyrics you can't un
derstand, was the best and most clever song
in the show: "... the acoustics suck, but we
don't give a (insert rhyming expletive and
pelvic thrust here)."
Remember this analysis: "Nightmare on

Palm Street" succeeded for three reasons.
First, the writers chose to lampoon Stanford
more than Cal. Frankly, we re funnier.
Second, by not having a running plot line, the
writers were able to have more freedom in
creating autonomous scenes. Third, any
Gaieties that knocks Conflict and Change ("I
decided to take Conflict and Change because
I want to major in International Relations") is
OK by me.
Remember this idea: How about letting the
actors take their bows before having the
Band come on. Granted, this is a radical idea,
but it would be nice to applaud the
performers.
Remember this stuff too: Acts one to nine
were good, but acts 10, 11 and 12 were poorly
written. . . . The entire cast was terrific;
literally no weak parts. . . . Diminutive Kris
ten Strout is the cutest thing to hit the Stan
ford stage since Dr. Ruth. . . . The original
title for this year's show was "50-Foot Mon
ster Gaieties from Hell in 3D." Glad they
changed the title?. . . . University President
Donald Kennedy, during a lunch with The
Daily staff Monday, asked the rhetorical
question, "Is there anyone who didn't get
ripped in this year's Gaieties?" But he
added,"! thought it was very good."

Remember this scene: "The Bursar of
Seville," the opera send-up that is being
called the best Gaieties scene ever, was the
unquestionable highlight of the show.
Besides being right on target (Student: "How
do you know my adviser didn't sign my study
list?" Study List Lady: "Because he is my
lover."), the scene also had the distinction of
having subtitles small enough as to be un

readable by the obnoxious yet lovable Bran
ner frosh in the balcony on Friday night.
Remember these cameos: All surfers take
note. This year's Gaieties featured the
world's first cameos by Jan and Dean. No,
not the singing group, we're talking about
Janet from the 21st century and Dean Sel
domridge from the Bookstore. For those of
you who didn't go to last year's Gaieties,
Janet (played by Brooke Ramel) was the main
character in last year's Gaieties, which, coin
cidentally, also didn't have a plot. Seldom
ridge, the wonderful lady who is a smiling
fixture at the Bookstore, came out and saved
the Gaieties Bookstore scene, which was
about to go belly up.
Remember these songs: I don't even re
member the words, but I can't get the tune of
"Nightmare on Palm Street," the opening
song, out of my head. Maybe therapy would
help. "You Can't Understand the Words to
this Song," a song whose lyrics you can't un
derstand, was the best and most clever song
in the show: "... the acoustics suck, but we
don't give a (insert rhyming expletive and
pelvic thrust here)."
Remember this analysis: "Nightmare on

Palm Street" succeeded for three reasons.
First, the writers chose to lampoon Stanford
more than Cal. Frankly, we re funnier.
Second, by not having a running plot line, the
writers were able to have more freedom in
creating autonomous scenes. Third, any
Gaieties that knocks Conflict and Change ("I
decided to take Conflict and Change because
I want to major in International Relations") is
OK by me.
Remember this idea: How about letting the
actors take their bows before having the
Band come on. Granted, this is a radical idea,
but it would be nice to applaud the
performers.
Remember this stuff too: Acts one to nine
were good, but acts 10, 11 and 12 were poorly
written. . . . The entire cast was terrific;
literally no weak parts. . . . Diminutive Kris
ten Strout is the cutest thing to hit the Stan
ford stage since Dr. Ruth. . . . The original
title for this year's show was "50-Foot Mon
ster Gaieties from Hell in 3D." Glad they
changed the title?. . . . University President
Donald Kennedy, during a lunch with The
Daily staff Monday, asked the rhetorical
question, "Is there anyone who didn't get
ripped in this year's Gaieties?" But he
added,"! thought it was very good."
