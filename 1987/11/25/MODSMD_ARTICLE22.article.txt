## Card seeks third straight title 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
The following is an understatement: The
Stanford water polo team will have to per
form a near miracle to win the NCAA title at
this weekend's NCAA tournament.
For upperclassmen, that contention must
seem somewhat foolish. After all, the Cardi
nal water polo program has won the last two
national championships, and six of the last
twelve.
But this year is different. It's not that the
1987 Cardinal is a lesser team than its
predecessors; it's just that the rest of the
country has caught up to Stanford and the
other water polo juggernaut, California,
which has won six of the last fourteen na
tional titles.
Friday at 7:30 p.m. at Long Beach's Bel-

Mont Plaza Olympic Arena, the No. 4-
seeded Stanford Cardinal (19-7) will play the
No. 5 UC-Irvine Anteaters (18-8). Irvine won
its last match against the Cardinal, in the
same arena three weeks ago by an 8-3 score.
Stanford, though, won the teams' two previ
ous meetings this fall.
Should it win, the Cardinal will also win the
privilege of playing this season's relatively
dominant collegiate team, the top-ranked
California Bears (24-3). The word relatively is
used because, while Cal has won all but three
of its matches against the rest of the nation's
top five teams, the majority of its victories
have been by one goal. Meanwhile, the other
four squads seem to have been trading vic
tories more eagerly than kids trade duplicate
baseball cards of Randy Lerch.
As Cardinal junior Jeff Oeding said, surviv
ing Irvine and Cal and reaching the finals

would he "a feat in itself' and cause for
celebration. Oeding also said he thinks that in
the Anteaters and the Bears, the Cardinal is
facing the toughest two games possible in the
eight-team tournament.
Irvine, especially, has improved lately,
Oeding said. "They (the Anteaters) started
off slow, but I think they've been the team to
beat in the past few weeks."
The Bears' top ranking is undisputed. USC
(20-7) is second seed, followed by UCI.A (23-
8), Stanford and Irvine. Cardinal Coach
Dante Dettamanti said that those four teams
could justifiably be ranked in any order and
that seedings were based on the teams' play
versus each other. Fepperdine (18-15) is
ranked sixth, ahead of Navy and Brown,
which hold the token Eastern team slots.

Senior Obi Greenman will have to play extremely well in the Stanford
»oal if the Cardinal is to negotiate an extremely tough draw in the
NCAA Championships.
The seedings were something
of a surprise for the Cardinal
players and coaches, who ex
pected to be placed third in the
tournament field. A N0.3 seeding
would have put the Cardinal
against No. 6 Pepperdine in the
first round and then against USC,
which Stanford defeated easily in
the teams' last match, in the
semifinals. Perhaps more signifi
cantly, it would have meant not
having to face Cal until the cham
pionship game Sunday at 7:30
p.m.
As it stands now, though, the

Cardinal will not be able to relax
for a second of play, something
which Oeding said may help the
team. "If you go in there thinking
you're going to have it easy,
you'll probably lose," Oeding
said. "When we found out (what
the seedings were) we were kind
of low. Dante tried to keep us
positive, though, and now we're
really psyched. We know that to
win will be a lot more reward
ing."
Still, Oeding would not have
minded another seed — any
other seed, "lt d be easier to be
ranked sixth," Oeding said.
In preparing for Friday night's
Irvine match, Stanford watched
films of its last game against the

Anteaters — the nightmarish 8-3
loss.
"The last time we played them,
they beat us by five goals, but
that was probably our worst
game of the season," Dettamanti
said.
In the teams' previous two
matches, the Cardinal won 10-9
in overtime at Irvine and then
won again, 4-2, at deGuerre Pool.
Friday night, Irvine will be facing
a Stanford squad far better than
the team it defeated and slightly
better than the Stanford team it
lost to. After the Big Splash Sat
urday, when they lost to Cal 5-4
in an intense, superbly played
battle, the team attitude was very
positive, and many players said
they felt the team was beginning

to peak.
"We will have to play three
tough teams to win, but I think
we're ready," Dettamanti said.
"We're playing better water polo
now. Our shooting is much bet
ter. . . . You've go to remember,
we have a fairly young team, but
now that we've played each of
these teams we know them bet
ter."
And of course each of those
teams knows Stanford better.
The play will be nerve-wracking
throughout, and for those of you
not treading water for Thanksgiv
ing break, think good things for
those who are. They may return
with Stanford's third straight
NCAA water polo championship
trophy.

"We're playing better water polo
now. Our shooting is much bet
ter. . . . You've go to remember,
we have a fairly young team, but
now that we've played each of
these teams we know them bet
ter."
And of course each of those
teams knows Stanford better.
The play will be nerve-wracking
throughout, and for those of you
not treading water for Thanksgiv
ing break, think good things for
those who are. They may return
with Stanford's third straight
NCAA water polo championship
trophy.
The following is an understatement: The
Stanford water polo team will have to per
form a near miracle to win the NCAA title at
this weekend's NCAA tournament.
For upperclassmen, that contention must
seem somewhat foolish. After all, the Cardi
nal water polo program has won the last two
national championships, and six of the last
twelve.
But this year is different. It's not that the
1987 Cardinal is a lesser team than its
predecessors; it's just that the rest of the
country has caught up to Stanford and the
other water polo juggernaut, California,
which has won six of the last fourteen na
tional titles.
Friday at 7:30 p.m. at Long Beach's Bel-

Mont Plaza Olympic Arena, the No. 4-
seeded Stanford Cardinal (19-7) will play the
No. 5 UC-Irvine Anteaters (18-8). Irvine won
its last match against the Cardinal, in the
same arena three weeks ago by an 8-3 score.
Stanford, though, won the teams' two previ
ous meetings this fall.
Should it win, the Cardinal will also win the
privilege of playing this season's relatively
dominant collegiate team, the top-ranked
California Bears (24-3). The word relatively is
used because, while Cal has won all but three
of its matches against the rest of the nation's
top five teams, the majority of its victories
have been by one goal. Meanwhile, the other
four squads seem to have been trading vic
tories more eagerly than kids trade duplicate
baseball cards of Randy Lerch.
As Cardinal junior Jeff Oeding said, surviv
ing Irvine and Cal and reaching the finals

would he "a feat in itself' and cause for
celebration. Oeding also said he thinks that in
the Anteaters and the Bears, the Cardinal is
facing the toughest two games possible in the
eight-team tournament.
Irvine, especially, has improved lately,
Oeding said. "They (the Anteaters) started
off slow, but I think they've been the team to
beat in the past few weeks."
The Bears' top ranking is undisputed. USC
(20-7) is second seed, followed by UCI.A (23-
8), Stanford and Irvine. Cardinal Coach
Dante Dettamanti said that those four teams
could justifiably be ranked in any order and
that seedings were based on the teams' play
versus each other. Fepperdine (18-15) is
ranked sixth, ahead of Navy and Brown,
which hold the token Eastern team slots.

Senior Obi Greenman will have to play extremely well in the Stanford
»oal if the Cardinal is to negotiate an extremely tough draw in the
NCAA Championships.
The seedings were something
of a surprise for the Cardinal
players and coaches, who ex
pected to be placed third in the
tournament field. A N0.3 seeding
would have put the Cardinal
against No. 6 Pepperdine in the
first round and then against USC,
which Stanford defeated easily in
the teams' last match, in the
semifinals. Perhaps more signifi
cantly, it would have meant not
having to face Cal until the cham
pionship game Sunday at 7:30
p.m.
As it stands now, though, the

Cardinal will not be able to relax
for a second of play, something
which Oeding said may help the
team. "If you go in there thinking
you're going to have it easy,
you'll probably lose," Oeding
said. "When we found out (what
the seedings were) we were kind
of low. Dante tried to keep us
positive, though, and now we're
really psyched. We know that to
win will be a lot more reward
ing."
Still, Oeding would not have
minded another seed — any
other seed, "lt d be easier to be
ranked sixth," Oeding said.
In preparing for Friday night's
Irvine match, Stanford watched
films of its last game against the

Anteaters — the nightmarish 8-3
loss.
"The last time we played them,
they beat us by five goals, but
that was probably our worst
game of the season," Dettamanti
said.
In the teams' previous two
matches, the Cardinal won 10-9
in overtime at Irvine and then
won again, 4-2, at deGuerre Pool.
Friday night, Irvine will be facing
a Stanford squad far better than
the team it defeated and slightly
better than the Stanford team it
lost to. After the Big Splash Sat
urday, when they lost to Cal 5-4
in an intense, superbly played
battle, the team attitude was very
positive, and many players said
they felt the team was beginning

to peak.
"We will have to play three
tough teams to win, but I think
we're ready," Dettamanti said.
"We're playing better water polo
