Usually, going to Hawaii means relaxa
tion. There is the sun, the ocean and the
generally laid-back pace of life. It's just a
great place to take a break from life â€” as
long as you don't go to play volleyball.
Playing the No. 2-ranked Hawaii
women's volleyball team is definitely no
vacation.
The Rainbow Wahines have not lost at
home this season and have dominated al
most all opposition. Led by two returning
All-Americans, seniors Tita Ahuna and
Suzanne Eagye, as well as perhaps the na
tion's most electrifying young player,
sophomore Teee Williams, the team was
picked to win the national championship
in Volleyball Monthly magazine's
preseason poll.
Third-ranked Stanford will be in the is
lands over Thanksgiving to play a pair of
matches against the 30-2 Rainbow
Wahines. The first match is tonight at 9:30
(PST) and the two teams will square off
again Friday night.
Before last weekend Hawaii was ranked
No. 1, having beaten two-time defending
NCAA champion Pacific twice in Hawaii
six weeks ago. The Rainbow Wahines
seemed unbeatable for most of the year,
and a five-game loss to UC-Santa Barbara

three weeks ago was viewed as an
anomaly. Common wisdom was that
Hawaii was a shoe-in for its third NCAA
title in six years.
Now, though, things are different.
Hawaii looked quite human falling in four
games to Pacific for the Wendy's Classic
Championship Sunday in Stockton. A
raucous hometown crowd of 6(XM) made it
a very tough trip to the mainland for the
Rainbow Wahines, and the visitors'
second loss of the season dropped them to
No. 2 in the rankings, witn the Tigers
rising to the top spot.
Now Hawaii will have to rebound very
quickly or face a similar fate at the hands
of the continually improving Cardinal (25-
4). Stanford goes into the two matches, its
last of the regular season, with a six-match
winning streak. The Cardinal also recently
clinched the Pacific 10 Conference title by
beating both UCLA and USC last
weekend. Stanford finished 17-1 in what
some observers call the nation's toughest
league.
The success the Cardinal has enjoyed
this season has been due to a well
balanced attack, strong blocking and
tough defense. Four different Cardinal
players have been named Pac-10 Players
of the Week this season, including junior
