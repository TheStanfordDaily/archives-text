# Spikers visit Islands

Usually, going to Hawaii means relaxa
tion. There is the sun, the ocean and the
generally laid-back pace of life. It's just a
great place to take a break from life — as
long as you don't go to play volleyball.
Playing the No. 2-ranked Hawaii
women's volleyball team is definitely no
vacation.
The Rainbow Wahines have not lost at
home this season and have dominated al
most all opposition. Led by two returning
All-Americans, seniors Tita Ahuna and
Suzanne Eagye, as well as perhaps the na
tion's most electrifying young player,
sophomore Teee Williams, the team was
picked to win the national championship
in Volleyball Monthly magazine's
preseason poll.
Third-ranked Stanford will be in the is
lands over Thanksgiving to play a pair of
matches against the 30-2 Rainbow
Wahines. The first match is tonight at 9:30
(PST) and the two teams will square off
again Friday night.
Before last weekend Hawaii was ranked
No. 1, having beaten two-time defending
NCAA champion Pacific twice in Hawaii
six weeks ago. The Rainbow Wahines
seemed unbeatable for most of the year,
and a five-game loss to UC-Santa Barbara

three weeks ago was viewed as an
anomaly. Common wisdom was that
Hawaii was a shoe-in for its third NCAA
title in six years.
Now, though, things are different.
Hawaii looked quite human falling in four
games to Pacific for the Wendy's Classic
Championship Sunday in Stockton. A
raucous hometown crowd of 6(XM) made it
a very tough trip to the mainland for the
Rainbow Wahines, and the visitors'
second loss of the season dropped them to
No. 2 in the rankings, witn the Tigers
rising to the top spot.
Now Hawaii will have to rebound very
quickly or face a similar fate at the hands
of the continually improving Cardinal (25-
4). Stanford goes into the two matches, its
last of the regular season, with a six-match
winning streak. The Cardinal also recently
clinched the Pacific 10 Conference title by
beating both UCLA and USC last
weekend. Stanford finished 17-1 in what
some observers call the nation's toughest
league.
The success the Cardinal has enjoyed
this season has been due to a well
balanced attack, strong blocking and
tough defense. Four different Cardinal
players have been named Pac-10 Players
of the Week this season, including junior
Amy Hayes this week.
Hayes, an outside hitter, pro
vided both offense and defense
against the Bruins and Trojans
and is second on the squad in
digs.
The other Stanford players
who have won Pac-10 Player-of
the-Week honors this year are
the team's three seniors, Nancy
Reno, Wendi Rush and Teresa
Smith. Smith and Reno have
been in the conference top 10 in
kills all season and have been the
mainstays of both the Cardinal's
hitting and passing. Rush, the
squad s starting setter for the
fourth consecutive year, has
been marvelous in getting the ball
to Reno and Smith and has also
been a force on defense, leading
the team in digs.
Junior middle blocker Laura
Olesen and sophomore Lara
Asper, the starting right-side hit
ter, have also been keys to Stan
ford's phenomenal recent suc
cess — 20 victories in its last 21
matches — and sophomore
Jenny Chaffee, a 6-foot-2 middle
blocker/outside hitter, has estab
lished herself as a force for the
future. She has come in on

several occasions to spell Haves,
often contributing a big block or
kill.
Hawaii, though, is also pretty
well-stocked, Lagye, who is 6-
foot-3, anchors the block, with
Williams serving as her counter
part at middle blocker. Coach
Dave Shoji also has the option of
using talented freshman Karrie
Trieschman in the middle, allow
ing Williams to play outside hit
ter, a spot where she is more ef
fective.
In addition to Ahuna, a 5-8
leaper with a great volleyball
sense, Shoji also has senior
Diana Jessie on the outside.
Jessie injured her ankle near the
end of the first game at Pacific
Sunday but returned for limited
duty throughout the match and
still recorded 20 kills, second
only to Williams' 23.
When Williams is in the middle
and Trieschman is out the Rain
bow Wahines also have 5-6
senior Mahina FJeneki. She is the
stereotypical Hawaii-style player
— a short but very quick player
who can jump, hit smart despite
her height and dig anything the
other team sends at her.
Setting for the squad is junior
Martina Cincerova, a Chechos
lovakian emigree who moved to
Torrance in 1983.

Starting outside hitler Lara Asper has been a big part of the Cardinal's
current six-game winning streak.
