Seventeen months ago Dr.
Tom Davis said "Aloha" to the
Stanford basketball program and
headed for land-locked lowa.
This weekend Mike Mont
gomery's Stanford Cardinal will
say "Aloha" to Davis and his
llth-ranked Hawkeyes in the
first round of the Hawaiian Air
lines/Maui Classic.
Stanford plays lowa at 4 p.m.
(PST) Friday. The winner of that
contest plays the winner of the
Kansas-Chaminade game Satur
day at 1 p.m. The other contests
Friday feature Illinois vs. Baylor
andVillanova vs. Nebraska.
The Cardinal players, how
ever, are obviously not looking
past lowa. All of the Stanford up
perclassmen were recruited by
Davis, and they are definitely
looking forward to meeting their

former coach on the playing
floor.
"When (Davis) recruited us
one of the selling points was 'I
love Stanford, and I'll never
leave it,' and blah, blah, blah,"
Cardinal point guard Terry
Taylor said. "And then he turned
around a year later and left."
"Some of us kind of resented
that. You don't have to worry
about us being flat on Friday,
Taylor said.
Center Derek Bruton is not as
piqued as Taylor.
"Yeah, it'll be nice to play
Coach Davis, and we'll have a
little more motivation, but I'd
like to beat lowa as lowa the top
ic team and not as just Davis's
team," Bruton said after practice
last night.
In any case, Coach Mont
gomery and his troops will have

finished last season 30-5 and
returns top scorers B.J.
Armstrong and Roy Marble from
that squad.
The Hawkeyes play a very up
tempo style of basketball, and
the tempo begins with Davis'
trademark full-court press.
"lowa is unique in that it does

press as a steady diet — it does it
for 40 minutes," Montgomery
said. "It's something I think we
can handle if we're ready to un
derstand it, not be impatient and
not get sloppy."
If there is any team in the na
tion that can understand Davis'
press, it's Stanford.
"Remember most of us once
ran that press ourselves," Taylor
pointed out yesterday. "We're
pretty familiar with it — where
they want you to go, where the
flow is. I think we'll be able to
handle it better than most

teams."
Taylor and Coach Montgom
ery both said they were espe
cially concerned about rebound
ing against the Hawkeyes.
lowa's starting lineup is not very
tall but bangs the boards well.
"They're 6-8, 235-type
players, and they're very good
athletes, so they're not small by
any stretch of the imagination, '
Montgomery said.
The less-than-tiny Hawkeyes
include starters A 1 Lorenzen (6-
8, 225), center Kent Hill (6-6,
225) and subs Ed Horton (6-8,

230) and Marble, who is nursing a
bad knee but is expected to play.
Stanford's probable starters
are Taylor, juniors Todd Lichti,
Bryan McSweeney and Howard
Wright and senior center Greg
Butler. Because of the full-court
press and the Hawaii heat, Mont
gomery expects to use 10 or 11
players.
Each team in the tournament is
guaranteed to play at least three
games. The championship game
will be broadcast on ESPN Sun

past lowa. All of the Stanford up
perclassmen were recruited by
Davis, and they are definitely
looking forward to meeting their

former coach on the playing
floor.
"When (Davis) recruited us
one of the selling points was 'I
love Stanford, and I'll never
leave it,' and blah, blah, blah,"
Cardinal point guard Terry
Taylor said. "And then he turned
around a year later and left."
"Some of us kind of resented
that. You don't have to worry
about us being flat on Friday,
Taylor said.
Center Derek Bruton is not as
piqued as Taylor.
"Yeah, it'll be nice to play
Coach Davis, and we'll have a
little more motivation, but I'd
like to beat lowa as lowa the top
ic team and not as just Davis's
team," Bruton said after practice
last night.
In any case, Coach Mont
gomery and his troops will have

role for the Cardinal.
to turn in a stellar performance to
upend the Hawkeyes. lowa
finished last season 30-5 and
returns top scorers B.J.
Armstrong and Roy Marble from
that squad.
The Hawkeyes play a very up
tempo style of basketball, and
the tempo begins with Davis'
trademark full-court press.
"lowa is unique in that it does

press as a steady diet — it does it
for 40 minutes," Montgomery
said. "It's something I think we
can handle if we're ready to un
derstand it, not be impatient and
not get sloppy."
If there is any team in the na
tion that can understand Davis'
press, it's Stanford.
"Remember most of us once
ran that press ourselves," Taylor
pointed out yesterday. "We're
pretty familiar with it — where
they want you to go, where the
flow is. I think we'll be able to
handle it better than most

teams."
Taylor and Coach Montgom
ery both said they were espe
cially concerned about rebound
ing against the Hawkeyes.
lowa's starting lineup is not very
tall but bangs the boards well.
"They're 6-8, 235-type
players, and they're very good
athletes, so they're not small by
any stretch of the imagination, '
Montgomery said.
The less-than-tiny Hawkeyes
include starters A 1 Lorenzen (6-
8, 225), center Kent Hill (6-6,
225) and subs Ed Horton (6-8,

230) and Marble, who is nursing a
bad knee but is expected to play.
Stanford's probable starters
are Taylor, juniors Todd Lichti,
Bryan McSweeney and Howard
Wright and senior center Greg
Butler. Because of the full-court
press and the Hawaii heat, Mont
gomery expects to use 10 or 11
players.
Each team in the tournament is
guaranteed to play at least three
games. The championship game
will be broadcast on ESPN Sun
day at 10 p.m.
