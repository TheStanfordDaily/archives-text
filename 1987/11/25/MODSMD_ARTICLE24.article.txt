Seventeen months ago Dr.
Tom Davis said "Aloha" to the
Stanford basketball program and
headed for land-locked lowa.
This weekend Mike Mont
gomery's Stanford Cardinal will
say "Aloha" to Davis and his
llth-ranked Hawkeyes in the
first round of the Hawaiian Air
lines/Maui Classic.
Stanford plays lowa at 4 p.m.
(PST) Friday. The winner of that
contest plays the winner of the
Kansas-Chaminade game Satur
day at 1 p.m. The other contests
Friday feature Illinois vs. Baylor
andVillanova vs. Nebraska.
The Cardinal players, how
ever, are obviously not looking
past lowa. All of the Stanford up
perclassmen were recruited by
Davis, and they are definitely
looking forward to meeting their

former coach on the playing
floor.
"When (Davis) recruited us
one of the selling points was 'I
love Stanford, and I'll never
leave it,' and blah, blah, blah,"
Cardinal point guard Terry
Taylor said. "And then he turned
around a year later and left."
"Some of us kind of resented
that. You don't have to worry
about us being flat on Friday,
Taylor said.
Center Derek Bruton is not as
piqued as Taylor.
"Yeah, it'll be nice to play
Coach Davis, and we'll have a
little more motivation, but I'd
like to beat lowa as lowa the top
ic team and not as just Davis's
team," Bruton said after practice
last night.
In any case, Coach Mont
gomery and his troops will have

With Eric Reveno sidelined for the season, 6-
foot-10 Greg Butler will play a more significant
role for the Cardinal.
