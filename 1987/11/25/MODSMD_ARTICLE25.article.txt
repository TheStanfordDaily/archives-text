# Women's basketball opens year in Utah
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team is certainly a
trendsetter.
While two other varsity
teams travel to sunny Hawaii
for a weekend of tough compe
tition, the women hoopsters
head to beautiful Utah to open
their season with games
against Utah Friday and BYU
Saturday.
The Cardinal has been
ranked 20th in both the AP and
Street and Smith's preseason
polls. Though neither of the
team's opponents this
weekend are similarly ranked,
Stanford will have its hands
full.
"We could go 2-0 this
weekend, but we could just as
easily go 0-2," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDeveer said. "We're
not the kind of team that can
just show up; we have to be
there 100 percent. Maybe if
one person isn't there we can
pick up the slack, but we can't
for two or three or four
people."
Utah, the Cardinal's first
foe, is definitely an unknown
quantity. The Cardinal has
only faced the Utes once, de
feating them 77-65 at Maples
Pavilion in the 1985-86 season.
"The Utah team has won I
think 20 games in the last
seven straight seasons," Van-
Derveer said. "They've been
in the NCAA [tournamentj,
they've won their conference,
they're a very strong, confi
dent team."
The Cardinal is much more
familiar with BYU, a team that
visited Stanford last year.
Though the Cougars handed

the Cardinal a 94-82 loss, Stan
ford point guard Jennifer Azzi
was the real winner that eve
ning, recording 14 points, 16
assists and 10 rebounds to
earn the only triple-double in
school history and only the
second ever in the Pacific 10
Conference.
"BYU is a little younger,
but they're again a very good
team and a team that plays
with a lot more confidence on
their own floor," VanDerveer
added.
The home court advantage
will work against the visiting
Cardinal, but in VanDerveer's
eyes, winning on the road is
vitally important.
"It's something you have to
adjust to," she said. " We're
playing tough teams on the
road because you have to be
able to play on someone else's
court. To do well in the Pac
-10, you have to beat good
teams on the road.
"I'm really looking at what
the team can do," the Cardinal
coach continued. "I think I
have a good handle on what
people can do. It's the first
game, and everyone's excited,
but we need to play smart."
After a month of practice
and scrimmages, VanDerveer
has finally settled on a starting
lineup, "though I doubt that
anyone will play a full 40
minutes," she said. The
frontcourt will feature 6-5
junior Jill Yanke at center,
with senior Kami Anderson
and sophomore Katy Steding
as forwards. Sophomore Azzi
will move to shooting guard to
exploit the new three-point
rule, allowing highly touted
freshman Sonja Henning to
start at point guard.
