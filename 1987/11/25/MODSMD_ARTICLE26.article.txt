# Humphreys, Grant make All-Pac-10 team
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Senior Brad Humphreys and sophomore
Alan Grant have been named to the All-
Pacific 10 Conference team, Pac-10 Commis
sioner Thomas Hansen announced yester
day.
In addition, seniors Jeff James, Brad
Muster and Doug Robison, along with juniors
Lester Archambeau, Ray Huckestein and
Andy Sinclair were named to the all
conference second team.
Humphreys anchored the Cardinal's sec
ondary this season from the strong safety po
sition with a team-leading seven intercep
tions.
Grant was cited not for his cornerbacking

but for his punt returns. Going into Big Game
he led the nation with a 19.1-yard average per
return. A sub-par performance against Cali
fornia left Grant with a 16.5-yard season
average and knocked him out of first place.
Muster, whose playing time was cut short
by a nagging ankle injury, still managed to
gain 563 yards rushing and 224 yards receiv
ing. He is almost certain to be selected in the
first round of the NFL draft.
In a head-to-head Big Game battle between
the Pac-10's top two punters, Robison moved
ahead of California's Scott Tabor in average
yards per punt. Nevertheless, Tabor was
placed on the first team and Robison on the
second team.
At center, Sinclair was the best of an excel
lent offensive line. He will likely be named to

The Sporting News' All-America team,
despite only making the conference's second
team. Though he is a senior academically,
Sinclair still has a year of eligibility left.
James recevied recognition for his 42-catch
effort on the year. One of Stanford's finest
receivers ever, James, like Muster, will al
most certainly be drafted by an NFL club this
spring.
Archambeau and Huckestein were fixtures
on the defensive line with 78 and 64 tackles,
respectively.
Troy Aikman, the UCLA quarterback who
passed for 2354 yards and 16 touchdowns,
and Arizona safety Chuck Cecil, who inter
cepted four passes when the Wildcats met the
Cardinal, were named Pac-10 Players of the
Year.
