### 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. â€”
Indiana basketball coach
Bobby Knight, in trouble
again, was reprimanded yes
terday by the university for
pulling his team off the court
during an exhibition game
against the Soviet Union.
Knight refused to let his
team finish the game on Satur
day night after he was ejected
for arguing with a referee.
A statement issued by the
university's news bureau said
Knight recognized he "had
made a serious mistake of
judgment" and that his actions
had caused "great embarrass
ment not only to himself and
the basketball program, but
also, and most importantly, to
the entire university and its
supporters."
Indiana Sports Information
Director Kit Klingelhoffer said
Knight has not specifically
commented on the reprimand,
but he has apologized several
times.
Knight told the Blooming
ton Rotary Club and Rotarians
on yesterday that he "let some
personal feelings outweigh

good judgment as far as the
general scope of things in that
particular game were con
cerned.' '
Knight received three tech
nical fouls Saturday night and
pulled his team oft' the court
about five minutes into the
second half. The Soviets,
leading 66-43, were declared
winners by forfeit.
Knight was protesting what
he said was a lane violation
that was ignored by officials
during free throws taken by a
Soviet player. He was ejected
from the game after getting his
third technical foul. He
refused to leave and told the
officials if he had to go, his
team would also go.
"1 had said publicly that
winning the game wasn't im-
Eortant to me," Knight said on
is weekly television show
Sunday. "I don't think it was a
game we could have won un
der any circumstances. . . .
As far as taking the team off
the floor after I was ejected,
there are things I wish I could
do over again. That is one of
them."
