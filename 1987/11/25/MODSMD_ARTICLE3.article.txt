# 'You Can Make a Difference'
## Organizers regret speaker's remarks 
### Alicia Kent Senior Staff writer 
Organizers of the "You Can
Make a Difference" conference
have accepted responsibility for
including in the conference pro
gram a sermon by a Baptist min
ister who made allegedly anti-
Semitic remarks, according to
Carolyn Ginsburg, a conference
organizer.
The Rev. Lawrence Carter,
Dean of the Chapel at Morehouse
College in Atlanta, said in his ser
mon that Jews "told non-Jews
they could take a free jet ride to
hell; after all they had been hurt
by them too much."
Stanford Jewish leaders, stu
dents and professors said they
were appalled by what they
called "anti-Semitic and inac
curate remarks" made by Carter
in his sermon on the final day of
the conference, which addressed
institutional racism.
Ginsburg, a senior who was in
charge of publicity for the confer
ence, said the event's organizers
"do accept responsibility for in
cluding the reverend in the pro
gram, but we don't accept re
sponsibility for his message. We
are just as angered and upset as
everyone else."
In response to charges that his
sermon was anti-Semitic, Carter
said in a telephone interview yes
terday he could "not agree with
the whole notion that I was anti-
Semitic."
In retrospect, Carter said he
understands how misconceptions
about his message could be
formed, but said that he was

never given the benefit of the
doubt that he was not attacking
Jews. "People want to interpret
my comments monolithically,"
he said. Carter said it is difficult
to express a message in a "cross
cultural setting."
Carter said his remarks were
"simply homolitical devices for
helping the congregation further
understand the depth of the hurt
that the Jews felt. They were
metaphors."
In the sermon. Carter told how
the biblical story of Jonah
portrayed the "evasion" of
moral responsibility that "all
people experience during their
lives."
Carter, who is black, argued
that because the Old Testament,
which contains the parable of
Jonah, is "a significant aspect of
Afro-American tradition, 1 dis
agree that it is anti-Semitic. As a
Christian, I am just as strong in
support of the Old Testament as
those who are Jewish."
According to Rabbi Ari Cartun
and senior Steven Simon, both of
Hillel, the Jewish student organi
zation, Jewish students were
shocked when Carter said that
Jews made the decision "to be
Jews and not care about the
Gentiles."
Simon, who is a member of the
executive board of Hillel, said,
"It bothers me that a man who is
trying to make a point for
equality does so by lashing out at
one group."
"Instead of achieving the con
ference's aim of "breaking down
