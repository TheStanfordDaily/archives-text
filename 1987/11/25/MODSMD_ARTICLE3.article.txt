# 'You Can Make a Difference'
## Organizers regret speaker's remarks 
### Alicia Kent Senior Staff writer 
Organizers of the "You Can
Make a Difference" conference
have accepted responsibility for
including in the conference pro
gram a sermon by a Baptist min
ister who made allegedly anti-
Semitic remarks, according to
Carolyn Ginsburg, a conference
organizer.
The Rev. Lawrence Carter,
Dean of the Chapel at Morehouse
College in Atlanta, said in his ser
mon that Jews "told non-Jews
they could take a free jet ride to
hell; after all they had been hurt
by them too much."
Stanford Jewish leaders, stu
dents and professors said they
were appalled by what they
called "anti-Semitic and inac
curate remarks" made by Carter
in his sermon on the final day of
the conference, which addressed
institutional racism.
Ginsburg, a senior who was in
charge of publicity for the confer
ence, said the event's organizers
"do accept responsibility for in
cluding the reverend in the pro
gram, but we don't accept re
sponsibility for his message. We
are just as angered and upset as
everyone else."
In response to charges that his
sermon was anti-Semitic, Carter
said in a telephone interview yes
terday he could "not agree with
the whole notion that I was anti-
Semitic."
In retrospect, Carter said he
understands how misconceptions
about his message could be
formed, but said that he was

never given the benefit of the
doubt that he was not attacking
Jews. "People want to interpret
my comments monolithically,"
he said. Carter said it is difficult
to express a message in a "cross
cultural setting."
Carter said his remarks were
"simply homolitical devices for
helping the congregation further
understand the depth of the hurt
that the Jews felt. They were
metaphors."
In the sermon. Carter told how
the biblical story of Jonah
portrayed the "evasion" of
moral responsibility that "all
people experience during their
lives."
Carter, who is black, argued
that because the Old Testament,
which contains the parable of
Jonah, is "a significant aspect of
Afro-American tradition, 1 dis
agree that it is anti-Semitic. As a
Christian, I am just as strong in
support of the Old Testament as
those who are Jewish."
According to Rabbi Ari Cartun
and senior Steven Simon, both of
Hillel, the Jewish student organi
zation, Jewish students were
shocked when Carter said that
Jews made the decision "to be
Jews and not care about the
Gentiles."
Simon, who is a member of the
executive board of Hillel, said,
"It bothers me that a man who is
trying to make a point for
equality does so by lashing out at
one group."
"Instead of achieving the con
ference's aim of "breaking down
differences between racial
groups," Simon said, Carter's
sermon succeeded in "inadver
tently offending certain groups."
According to Ginsburg,
"Carter took an opportunity to
inspire and unify his audience
and instead created separation
and doubt."
"He subsequently perpetuated
and distorted stereotypes of
Jewish values and behavior,"
she said.
Carter's sermon said that
Jewish attitudes in 400 B.C.
"were: 'We will make sure
slavery never happens to Jews
again.' Their attitude should
have been, 'We'll make sure
slavery never happens again to
mankind.' But they decided they
were going to practice the protec
tive strategy of deliberate selfish
ness," Carter said.
"They felt that all non-Jews
could take a free jet ride to hell;
after all they had been hurt by
them too much. So, the Jews, in
their defensiveness, arrogance
and feeling of superiority,
scorned non-Jews and, in es
sence, said, 'Let them spin
slowly in the wind,' 'God is for
us,' and 'He is our God.' "
Cartun, who is executive di

rector of Hillel. said in a letter
that the "Jew-hating tone of the
talk" presented Jews "as
scapegoats again, the most
racist, blind bigots in God's un
verse, needing Christian love to
save us.
When the letter was read to
him. Carter said he was not ac
cusing Jews of being like Jonah,
who, he said, denied Ciod's will.
"At no point in the sermon did
I indicate that Jonah was all Jews
in all periods of history," Carter
said. He added, however, that in
retrospect it would have been
helpful to add this point as a
qualifier to his remarks.
Religious Studies Prof. Kdwin
Good, who teaches a class on the
Hebrew Bible here, said Carter's
remarks that Jews wanted non-
Jews to take a "free jet ride to
hell' was "very inaccurate. Jews
don t believe in hell, so they
don't believe Gentiles should go
to hell," Good said.
Good, who said he is very criti
cal of Carter's remarks, said that
the problem is Carter's "real
misunderstanding and ignorance
about Judaism. Rev. Carter
needs to read up on the thing and
educated himself about
Judaism."
Religious Studies Prof.
Lawrence Berman also said
Carter's remarks were inac
curate. "On the face of it, it is
just not correct in terms of
Jewish sources. In the Talmud

there is a discussion whether
righteous Gentiles have a place in
the world to come," Berman
said. "Righteous Gentiles who
observe ethical codes have a
place in the world to come. They
are not going to go to hell, but
will be saved," Berman said.
"(Carter's) statements were
based on stereotypes without
having good knowledge of Jewish
sources, ethical behavior and in
dividual Jews," Berman said.
"This distortion of the reality of
history books and of the actual
situation of individual Jews could
be a result of a prejudice not
based on a rational assessment."
Carter responded by saying, "I
chalk that (the 'hell' statement)
to my unfamiliarity with the
Jewish community's refusal to
relate to the Christian concept."
Cartun said, "I don't think that
(Carter) is a conscious racist. He
is as affected by racism, as I am,
only (because) he is unaware of
his racism, and I am aware and
try to compensate for racist
societal programming."
Cartun said that he believed
Carter's "vicious attack" was a
result of Carter's "anger. . . that
Jews rejected Jesus." Cartun
said Carter is "mad at (Jews in
Jonah's time), at us today, at the
state of Israel for only focusing
on Jewish issues. If this were
true, there wouldn't have been so
many Jews helping with the con
ference."
