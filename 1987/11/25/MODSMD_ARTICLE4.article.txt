# ASSU announces vote tally, reviews methods
## 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
The ASSU last night validated the
official results of last week's fall
quarter general election in which 728
students — over 14 percent of those
registered — cast ballots.
Students soundly defeated a con
stitutional amendment that would
have allowed the ASSU to collect
capital fees from the student body.
Although the ballots were almost
equally divided on the amendment,
the measure required a two-thirds
majority for approval.
The ASSU hoped to fund large
projects — such as the renovation of
the Old Firehouse or the reconstruc
tion of the Boathouse — with the
amendment by assessing students $1
or $2 refundable fees over a number
of years.
According to Council of Presidents
member Leonard Adler, an author ot
the amendment, the University has
not funded such projects in the past

because "academic interests (have)
priority."
Adler reacted positively to the
defeat of the amendment, saying it
"just means we now have more am
munition when we approach the Uni
versity with these projects' because
the ASSU has no way to raise capital
itself.
The second constitutional amend
ment on the ballot won by a three-to
one margin. The amendment will
give the ASSU more flexibility in
scheduling its spring election.
The amendment will now be pre
sented to University President
Donald Kennedy for his approval,
which is expected.
The election also filled three va
cant seats on the Student Conduct
Legislative Council, a 12-member
panel that meets quarterly to review
cases of student violations of the
Honor Code.
Senior Valerie Huang collected 37
percent of the vote, while juniors
Cindy Wurtenburg and Laurence

Gordon collected 33 percent and 29
percent, respectively.
Wurtenburg said she is qualified
for the position because she is
"impartial, fair and serious."
"It'll be fascinating to hear all the
different cases," she said.
In addition, graduate voters
elected 13 graduate students, includ
ing four successful write-in candi
dates, to the ASSU Senate.
The nine graduate senators who
declared candidacy were approved
overwhelmingly.
Senator Steven Piche, a first-year
engineering student who attended his
first senate meeting last night, said he
was "not super-familiar with the
ASSU."
"I'm going to be learning . . . the
context of new issues (in) a new uni
versity," Piche said before the
meeting.
Senator Ed Plumer, a write-in from
the School of Engineering, said he
does not know much about the sen
ate and "was not sure if (his) election

was serious or not.
"I'll look into it ... to know if I'll
be able to put sufficient time and ef
fort into it to make it worthwhile,"
he said.
Senate Chair Dave Smolen said the
increased number of graduate
senators provides a "bigger variety
of opinions."
"We'll try for 20 elected graduate
senators in the spring . . . with more
publicity," he said.
The exact cost of the election,
which featured standardized voting
machines rented from Santa Clara
County, has not yet been deter
mined, according to ASSU Adminis
trative Manager Jack Ottoway.
Original predictions approached
$9000, and many senators said they
found the amount excessive.
Elections Commissioner Steve
Baer did not attend the meeting last
night, but said earlier that he will
prepare a report next week to the
Council of Presidents with his evalu
ation of the election
