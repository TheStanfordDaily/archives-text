## Gore urges new arms control tack 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Democratic presidential candidate
Albert Gore Jr. predicted yesterday
that the next president of the United
States will have a "historic opportu
nity to control the arms race" through
meaningful negotiations with the So
viet Union.
Speaking to a lunchtime crowd of
over 400 people in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Gore, a U.S. Senator
from Tennessee, said the United
States is "in an unusual period of his
tory, almost as if we are between two
eras." He explained that the first era,
which began in 1945, was character
ized by "visionary leadership that
created a reciprocal free trade system,
the Marshall Plan and made the
Americans "bankers to the world.
"That era is now ending in many
ways," Gore said. As evidence of this,
he cited the current U.S. trade deficit,
the Japanese takeover of the world s

banking industry, increased foreign
borrowing by the United States and
the U. S. military burden in Western
Europe.
"Many of the countries that we are
protecting and defending are the very
ones that are competing very sucess
fully against us," Gore said.
Gore called for new leadership
during this transition period. "If we
are going to move from that postwar
era to a new era, as yet undefined, we
need leadership to accomplish that
transition."
According to Gore, the next presi
dent must focus attention on arms con
trol and take "advantage of what
might be a historic opportunity to con
trol the arms race in a verifiable way."
He called on Americans to "change
the way we think" about arms control,
noting that simple numerical equality
in the number of missiles should not be
the United States' main goal.
Gore said the relationship between
the superpowers is destabilized by

missiles with MIRVs, multiple inde
pendently re-targetable warheads that
can destroy several unlaunched enemy
missiles at once.
A solution. Gore said, would he a
treaty limiting U.S. and Soviet
missiles to a single warhead. He first
introduced this arms control proposal
six years ago.
According to Gore, the U.S. gov
ernment's "initial reaction (to this pro
posal) was underwhelming" hut the
Soviet government has expressed in
terest in the idea.
Following his speech. Gore an
swered questions from the audience.
When asked about the Strategic
Defense Initiative, Gore criticized the
high cost of the proposed system and
questioned the wisdom of attempting
to mitigate the effects of a Soviet first
strike, which he said is highly unlikely.
Gore said the budget deficit could be
brought under control by ending the
arms race, selectively cutting the
budget and possibly by raising taxes.
