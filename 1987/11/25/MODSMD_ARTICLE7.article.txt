Powerful quake hits Southern Cal.
EL CENTRO — A strong earthquake, measuring 6.3 on the
Richter scale, jolted California's Imperial Valley early yesterday
morning, injuring 94 people in the United States and Mexico,
and damaging some structures. It came just 12 hours after a
quake of slightly smaller magnitude struck the same area.
Across the Mexican border, in the town of Mexicali, the Red
Cross said a mother and child were killed when they fled a
downtown factory during the temblor and were struck by an au
tomobile.
Fifty persons were treated for injuries in Mexicali, Mexico,
and 44 in Imperial County. Most of the injuries were minor.
The quake hit at 5:16 a.m. and was felt as a rolling motion
across Southern California and as far east and north as Phoenix
and Las Vegas.
The epicenter of yesterday's shock, like that of the 6.0 quake
that struck Monday evening and its numerous aftershocks, was
in a lightly populated desert area 10 to 14 miles west and south
west of the small community of Westmorland, about 90 miles
east of San Diego.
Its distance from populated areas kept damage and injuries
down compared to the severe disruption caused by the state's
Oct. 1 earthquake, which was only about half as strong but was
centered in heavily populated areas just east of Los Angeles.
Cuban inmates release one hostage
ATLANTA — Cuban inmates in control of two federal pris
ons released one hostage yesterday, but refused to free dozens
of others despite a promise by Attorney General Edwin Meese
III to delay deportations.
Atlanta Federal Penitentiary officials confirmed that one pris
oner was shot dead when the takeover began Monday but
denied reports that others were killed. Twelve other people
were injured here.
Late in the day, 315 inmates — including some Americans —
who asked not to participate in the uprising turned themselves in
and were escorted out of the prison by troops armed with auto
matic weapons.
At the Oakdale, La., federal detention center, where the first
rioting erupted Saturday, prisoners brandished weapons — in
cluding knives, machetes and spears — and displayed two of
their hostages to show they were unharmed.
One reporter who was briefly allowed to observe the
perimeter of the Oakdale facility late Tuesday afternoon said
that inmates had salvaged bricks, wood and even bedsprings to
build a barrier about 80 feet long and up to three feet high be
tween the administration building and burned barracks. But au
thorities confirmed later that they had used a water cannon to
destroy the makeshift blockade.
The Oakdale Cubans rioted the day after the State Depart
ment announced an agreement with Cuba calling for the return
of about 2500 of the 125,000 refugees who came to this country
from Mariel in a 1980 boatlift. About 1400 Cubans are in the At
lanta prison, and another 1000 are detained in Oakdale.
GNP increases for third quarter
WASHINGTON — An unusual surge in business investment
and heavy consumer spending pushed the nation's economy to a
strong annual growth rate of 4.1 percent during the three months
before the October stock market crash, the Department of Com
merce reported yesterday.
The third-quarter growth estimate for the gross national prod
uct, revised upward from a preliminary estimate a month ago of
3.8 percent, was about in line with predictions. It generally rein
forced the belief of economists that the economy was expanding
at a substantial and well-balanced clip before the Oct. 19 market
plunge.
I he Department of Commerce also issued a new measure of
one of the economy 's most nagging problems, the trade deficit.
Measured on a balance-of-payments basis in 1987 dollars,
Americans imported $39.8 billion more goods than they ex
ported during the July-September period, the largest quarterly
trade deficit ever.
That trade deficit occurred even though exports, up 9 percent
in the quarter, have been growing faster than imports, up 6 per
cent.
By a different measure, which also takes into account trade in
services and income from investment abroad and is used as a
basis for the GNP estimate, the U.S. trade deficit for the third
quarter grew at an annual rate of $119.8 billion, or $29.9 billion
for the quarter.
Germany cuts interest rate
West German officials lowered a key interest rate by a quarter
of a point yesterday in an apparent response to Congress' plan
to trim the federal deficit, triggering a stock market rally and
boosting the dollar. Then those officials made comments that
raised doubts about their intent, sending a chill through the
markets.
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told his nation's par
liament that Germany was prepared to "contribute actively" to
international efforts aimed at economic growth and employ
ment, but he added, "This cannot — and should not — lead to
any drastic policy steps."
The stock market and dollar soared in response to the action,
which was coordinated with similar rate cuts in France and the
Netherlands. Investors interpreted it as a long-sought signal that
Germany was taking on greater responsibility for the world's
economic growth in the wake of the stock market collapse.
But as a German official's criticism of the U.S. budget-cutting
plan began to circulate later in the day, disappointment rippled
through the financial community, and the dollar abruptly
reversed course, actually ending the day lower than it started.
"The dollar went on a roller-coaster ride — up in the morning
and down in the afternoon, and the bond market followed the
dollar," observed Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Manufac
turers Hanover Trust Co. in New York. "It's been an interest
ing day."
GOP senators suggest deficit panel
SANTA FE, N.M. — Two key Republican architects of the
latest federal deficit-cutting plan said yesterday the new pro
posal is so feeble that the time has come to take the deficit issue
away from Congress and entrust it to a non-partisan commission
of fiscal experts.
In a speech to the Republican Governors' Association
meeting here, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) pro
posed the creation of a "national economic commission" to
produce a detailed blue print for balancing the federal budget
which would go to Congress after the 1988 elections.
Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican
on the Senate Budaet Committee, endorsed the commission
idea. Using identical language, Dole and Domenici both said a
blue-ribbon commission could "give Congress some cover" to
make decisions on taxes and spending cuts that have proven im
possible because of political fears among the members.
