# Shultz finalizes arms pact

### 
GENEVA, Switzerland — The United
States and the Soviet Union announced yes
terday that they have completed six years of
work on a treaty to ban all ground-launched
medium-ranne nuclear missiles.
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevard
nadze, who resolved the outstanding obsta
cles to an agreement with Secrtary of State
George Shultz in two days of intensive talks
here, called the agreement "historic" and of
"tremendous importance for the world."
The agreement, the first ever that would
actually reduce the number of nuclear weap
ons, is scheduled to be signed by President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
at a Washington summit meeting just two
weeks from now.
Under its terms, the Soviets will eliminate
four times as many missiles as the United
States, and roughly six times as many war
heads. The weapons will be eliminated within
three years and inspectors for both sides will
monitor compliance for another 10 years after

that.
The announcement of an agreement was
made by Shultz and Shevardnadze outside
the U.S. Mission to the United Nations here
in a cold but gentle rain late yesterday after
noon.
"We've now completed agreement on all
the outstanding INF issues," Shultz said,
using the initials for Intermediate Nuclear
Forces, as the medium-range missiles have
been called. "All that remains is treaty lan
guage, which others will be able to do."
Once ratified by the U.S. Senate, the treaty
will provide for a system of on-site inspection
in both countries that will go "far beyond
anything attempted before," Shultz said in
announcing the agreement.
Ratification is expected despite opposition
from more than a dozen Senate conserva
tives. To opponents who plan to vote against
the agreement, Shultz said, "Critics must say
why they want more nuclear weapons rather
than less." This argument — that fewer nu

clear weapons is better than more — is ex
pected to be the administration's mainstay in
the upcoming ratification debate.
In Denver, where he stopped off to make a
speech while on his way to his Santa Barbara
ranch for the Thanksgiving holiday, Reagan
said that he was pleased about the pact.
"It appears that all of the remaining issues
on reaching an INF agreement have been re
solved, including a reliable and credible
verification package," he said.
Under the terms of the treaty, Soviet in
spectors will have the right to examine two
facilities in the United States. Shultz would
not specify which U.S. plants would be sub
ject to inspection but U.S. officials provided
enough detail that the possibilities could be
narrowed down to a ballistic missile produc
tion plant, probably in Orlando, Fla., and a
General Dynamics Corp. plant in San Diego
that produces cruise missile launchers.
