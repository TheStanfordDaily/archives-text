Three Stanford graduates of
ficially agreed Monday to
donate MX) acres of Southern
California property near Presi
dent Reagan's private ranch to
build the Reagan Library and
Center for Public Affairs.
The graduates are three of
the four partners of Blakely
Swartz, a Los Angeles-based
land development firm that an
nounced last week it would to
offer the land to the Reagan Li
brary Foundation. The founda
tion in April canceled plans to
build the library at Stanford.
According to partner Donald
Swartz, who graduated in 1968
with a bachelor's degree in eco
nomics and two years later
graduated from the Business
School, the partners' affection
for Stanford was one of the
reasons the group became in
terested in the library.
"Being a graduate of Stan
ford, I felt bad when the library
fell out of bed there," Swartz
said. "I'm also a native of

Southern California, I like to
preserve history, and I'm into
charitable giving," he said.
"The combination of these
traits made me want to have the
library in Southern California,"
Swartz said.

The other Stanford alumni
participating in the agreement
are Swartz's wife Rita, a 1977
Business School graduate, and
David Maddux, who graduated
from the Business School in
1970.
Swartz said his partnership
first offered a preliminary pro
posal May 1, 1987, one week
after the foundation decided
not to follow through with
plans to build at Stanford. The
two groups have worked
closely since a formal proposal

was made in mid-June, he said.
According to Gary Jones, ex
ecutive director of the founda
tion, the development firm will
not receive anything in ex
change for the land, but it may
qualify for federal and state tax
breaks.
The foundation decided not
to build the library at Stanford
because the University refused
to allow an autonomous center
for public affairs to be built
along with the library, Jones
said.
Jones declined to comment
on the widely held belief that
faculty and student complaints
about the library's proposed
site in the Stanford Foothills
caused the foundation to look
elsewhere.
"I don't want to look back
and plow old ground," he said.
Jones also refused to divulge
details about the site selection
process that followed the deci
sion to move the library from
Stanford.
"The foundation is looking
ahead," said Jones. "We're
putting the past behind us."
