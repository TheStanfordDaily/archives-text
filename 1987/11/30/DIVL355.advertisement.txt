Management Information Consulting
in
Northern California
Who We Are
We have nearly 90 consulting offices in more than 20 countries, and we have been growing at an
annual rate of 15%. That growth supports a professional staff of approximately 13,000 consultants
worldwide.
Here in Northern California, Arthur Andersen & Co. is the largest consulting organization, having
grown from 60 to over 240 professionals during the past decade.
What We Do
Our management information consulting practice focuses on the design and implementation of infor
mation systems. We also do general management consulting such as strategic planning and profitability
cost studies. We emphasize a strong industry approach to client service, with personnel specializing in
health care, financial services, manufacturing, distribution, construction/engineering, high-technology,
productivity/JIT, regulated industries and government services.
We have a strong commitment to personnel development and consequently offer extensive technical
and industry-oriented training to all members of our professional staff. We typically hire individuals
with an undergraduate or a graduate degree in Business, Computer Science, Industrial Engineering,
Economics, or MIS. We selectively hire students from other disciplines who have a strong interest in
pursuing a career in management information consulting.
