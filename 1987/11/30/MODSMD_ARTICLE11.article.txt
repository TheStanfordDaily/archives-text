Athletic Director Andy Geiger and Council of
Presidents member Leonard Adler should be.
commended for their efforts in facilitating the
recent installment of condom dispensers in En
cina and Roble Gyms.
Last spring a survey of 400 students con
ducted by members of a human biology class
showed campus support for installing the
machines in campus restrooms. The ASSU Sen
ate later created a bill supporting the proposal.
Adler has met with University library officials
and with the University's Housing Operation's
Advisory Committee seeking approval for in
stalling condom machines in the restroortis of li
braries and dormitories.

The Office of Residential Education now

should take concrete steps to see that condom
dispensers are installed in dormitories as soon as
possible.
In doing so, Res Ed would be providing a ne
cessary and perhaps lifesaving service to the stu
dents of this university.
Recently, Res Ed bought out the house for
two extra performances of the Drama Depart
ment s production of "The Normal Heart," a
play that sought to personalize the AIDS
epidemic. These performances were reserved
exclusively for students.
Res Ed can further strengthen its commitment
to promoting student awareness of safer sex and
the AIDS epidemic by allowing condom dis
pensers in the dorms.
