# An alternative to Food Service
## 
### 
I Mfas going to be tactful in this columft, but
then I decided there was no need to obspure r
the truth. University Food Servite is just
plain awful.
They serve lousy food at exorbitant prices,
they force you to buy more meals than you
can eat, and then they have the nerve to claim
they really aren't all that bad.

In fact, their explanations db almost sound
Flausible. But 1 know a few things for certain:
live in Alpha Sig; 1 pay $317 less per quarter
than a Food Service client, but 1 receive 19
better meals a week, have full use of a well
stocked open kitchen and never $ave to
worry about sneaking guests past a card
checker. In fact, I don't ifVen have a F6od
Service card. Furthermore, the longest food
line all year held me up for less than three
minutes. ' >
All this means that I save.abofcit $50(f per
quarter. Not only do I pay less-at the begin
ning, I also don't have to pay for a pizza
every night to make up for the dinner that
didn't quite cut it. I also don't have to buy
cereal, drinks, extra sna£ks, tea, coffee, hot
chocolate and the numerous 6tn£r'items we
all go through a lot of.
Five-hundred dollars per quarter is a lot
more than just a number or a silly complaint.
By the end of the year, it's a top-notch stereo"
system. By the time I graduate, it's a Kyuiv
dai. So literally, while I'm ei\joymg my 19
much higher quality meals each week, I'm
also earning myself a new car.
This is part of why I think we should air
stop joking about Food Service and start ga
ting serious about dumping^t.
Although it is true thatdt Alpha Sig I haVte
to hash four times a quarter, for a total titae
commitment of three hours, any fool can tell
who's getting the better deal. Any fool, that
is, besides the ones at Food Service who con
tinue to insist that they're providing a
"valuable service" to the Stanford.
nity. * 112
Now, in a few paragraphs I'm going
pose that Food Service be
banded, and I'll explain what can be d6rfe to
insure that all students, not just the ot)e&vtQjth
low draw numbers, get dood deals oi&thttr
meals.
But before I do that, let me exfcttluttftfte
truth behind why Food Service is
sive. Food Service'officials like to claiifftirat
it's not their fault Food Service is so
sive. According to them, the real culprits are
high labor costs and the fact that they have to
divide their service among many small

houses. Frankly, this a classic case of blatant
lying. Neither of their excuses holds water.
First, all the food operations on campus pay
the same high labor costs. Second, the
houses they're serving aren't any smaller
than the ones like Alpha Sig, and we get great
food deals.
The real problem is that the clods at Food
Service spend a whole lot more of our money
than they need to. Take, for example, those
three servers you see on every Food Service
line. What are they doing there? Some Stan
ford students may indeed be a teensy bit
more capable than others, but it's fair to say
that not only tfcf we all know how to pick up a
slice of turkey, we also all know how to put it
dta oar j>latesv v*
Back to those three people. Three people,
at $6 an hour, at seven serving hours a day, at
say 22fbod lines across campus, at about 220
servTn&datfs, adds up to . . . $610,000 a year.
Divide this u$ per student, and you have
quite a figure.
Now I won't pfetend that my figures are
exact* but any way you look at it that's still
an awful lot of money to pay someone to
scoop your mashed potatoes for you. And
please, Food Service officials, let's not kid
"ourselves about people taking too much food
if it weren't for the servers. Even if we could
stand to eat any more of your food than abso
lutely tiecessary, we'd eat a lot less than
$610,000 worth.
along, how about that checker at
the beginning of each line? Who are we kid
dihg there? All those boyfriends and
girlfriends who come out to visit for a week
certainly aren't handing over $7 dollars per
meal to Food Service. No, just like everyone
else who needs free food they sneak right on
by. Conclusion: The checkers are useless.
Let's see now, one checker per line, at six
dollars an hour, at. . .
. And while we're on the subject, how about
all those card reader machines at $1000 each?
And hbw much does it cost to make all those
"Cards for the whole freshman class each
year? And how much are the people who run
the computer system paid? It's all just more
wasted money.
How about those pretty plastic trays ? You
don't need a tray to eat at home, and you
shouldn't need one here. If you could get
your plate at the beginning of the line, instead
of haying to Wait for the expensive server to
give it to yon, then you could put your sil
verware «rt'd your dessert on your plate
where it belongs and dispense with the tray
altogether. How many man hours does it take
to clean all those trays each meal? So many
man hours, $6 an hour, at. . .
I've never worked at Food Service, so 1
can't comment Oh how much waste goes on
inside the kitchens. But if the outside is any
indication, I'm-sure they're wasting quite a
bit In there too. '
Now that, we've cleared away some of the
mystery surrounding Food Service prices, let
me explain why I think Food Service should

be eliminated before next year. The food
paradise that exists at the self-ops can be du
plicated in all University residences. Just
take all the equipment Food Service owns
and distribute it among the various dorms and
houses; this would free up Food Service's
space to be used as open kitchens.
Although implementing these changes
might take some doing, it wouldn't be that
hard, and the rewards would be great. After
doing this, all that would be required would
be for each residence to elect a kitchen
manager (offer a salary of $500() per year, and
there will be plenty of applicants) and to hire
a cook. Getting a cook isn't all that hard
either, since you could hire back the ex-Food
Service cooks.

I live in Alpha Sig; I pay $317
less per quarter than a Food
Service client, but I receive 19
better meals a week, have full
use of a well-stocked open
kitchen and never have to
worry about sneaking guests
past a card checker. In fact, I
don't even have a Food Service
card. Furthermore, the longest
food line all year held me up for
less than three minutes.

By taking these steps you would:
• eliminate Food Service incompetence and
thus reduce cost,
• give every house on campus an open
kitchen,
• provide for higher quality food because
each cook would now cook for a much
smaller number of people, and
• make all that dining space available to the
residence all the time, not just when the Food
Service staff feels like unlocking it.
For those who worry that this system
might lead to 100 versions of Synergy, never
fear. Except for the one well-paid kitchen
manager in each residence, no one has to
notice the change. There would still be three
meals a day made by a professional cook and
served at the appropriate times. If a student
doesn't want to hash at all, that's fine. There
are always enough people who want to work,
and the cost would still be much cheaper than
Food Service.
There is no reason to continue forcing high
bills and bad food on the Stanford commu
nity. Eliminate University Food Service and
establish a kitchen in each residence.
Now, about that fourth year of housing. . .
