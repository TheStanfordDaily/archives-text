## Appreciate Stanford opportunity 
### 
On Nov. 19 The Daily ran an
ad for Tolston-Brown, a financial
corporation interviewing on
campus. "It's a career most
people find only in their
dreams," the ad states. Many
Tolston-Brown agents, we are
told, eventually earn $200,000
annually and retire as multimil
lionaires. Understandably, Tol-.
ston-Brown is "looking for
people who are comfortable with
wealth," probably like the man

Ken
Zimmerman

pictured in the ad: yotmg, good
looking, reading The Wall Street
Journal and sitting in the back of
what must be a very, very long
Cadillac.

, It could be argued that
Tolstoto'-Brown is actually
looking for people who have no
social conscience and have never
felt compassion. Mr: Vuppie in
thf Cadillac does not strike me as
the fVpte of person who is particu
larly Concerned over the fact
thity while tie earns (I use the
term- loosely), hundreds of
thoesahds of dollars each year,
dV£r V5 percehl of the population
in the United" States now lives
below the poverty line.
112 m not saying there's anything
wrong with making money. We
all need-to make a living, and it's
silly v to^ feel guilty'about being
able t6r do so. But people Who
think Of money as an end in and
of ? who feel comfortable
with weattKT' have ldst all sense
of perspective. Their intehse and
seruptilonls focus on profit
maxifhization is dangerous.

These are the type of people to
whom this ad appeals.
I like to think Tolston-Brown
is wrong in assuming enough
Stanford students think this way
about money to make the ex
pense of printing the ad
worthwhile. I fear, however, that
I'm being naive about Stanford
students, in which case I'm not
quite sure to whom I'm writing
this.
Perhaps, I'm appealing to the
editors of The Daily to use more
discretion in choosing the ads
they print; perhaps I'm appealing
to students who go to these inter
views to think twice before com
mitting themselves to a field like
investment banking. Granted,
the ad in question offers not only
money, but also "professional
satisfaction." But isn't this just
another way of saying "not only

will you make millions, you will
also feel satisfied about making
millions?"
I agree that paying Stanford
tuition for four years merits earn
ing lots of money soon after grad
uation. But what many students
fail to realize is that to pay for a
Stanford degree is to pay for the
opportunity to do just about any
thing you want to do in the
world. Let's face it, Stanford stu
dents have it made. There is no
such thing as an unemployed
Stanford graduate who actively
seeks work (except right after
graduation, of course). To limit
oneself to the career that offers
the most money is both to have
misunderstood and to have
wasted the opportunities Stan
ford has to offer.
