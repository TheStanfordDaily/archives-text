Criticisms in
reverend's speech
did not slander
I was surprised at the distor
tions of Rev. Lawrence Carter's
sermon appearing in the letter
"Speaker marred conference
with slander of Jews" (Daily,
Nov. 23). Rev. Carter's focus
was on a victim's need to forgive
and was entirely in keeping with
Christian theology. The letter er
roneously construed this focus
and its accompanying biblical
analogies as an attack on Jews.
All of the comments cited in the
letter were made in the context of
describing the kind of attitude
Jonah (a Jewish victim of dis
crimination) had toward Ninevah
(a non-Jewish city) when God
called him to preach in that city.
The letter further ignores the
fact that Carter (a black man)
"confessed" to a similar intran
sigence when Martin Luther
King Jr. was assassinated. It
takes quite a stretch of the im
agination to construe a biblical
story on the importance of
forgiveness and such a
"confession" into slander of
Jews. Perhaps what really upset
the authors of the letter were
Carter's criticisms of present-day
Israel's treatment of Pales
tinians. While one may disagree
with those criticisms, they could

hardly be characterized as
slander.

Ideas are unclear
on political party
The recent viewpoint "Choose
a conservative Democrat"
(Daily, Nov. 24 ) leaves me be
wildered. The author of the view
point urges the Democratic Party
to readopt a tried and true mix of
foreign activism and military
strength, but does the Vietnam
War serve as a "winning for
mula?"
With all due respect, one need
not be an "ultra-liberal" to
oppose injudicious or immoral
use of force in Grenada and else
where. Our nation's policy in the
Persian Gulf is at best undefined
and at worst potentially dis
astrous. The suggestion that one
deviates from "American
opinion in believing so strikes
mcayimfiiH'.jfi--
rurthermore, consider the cir- N
cular reasoning in the statement, ;
I personally have no problem •
with selectng a conservative
Democrat because I am also a I
conservative Democrat." Appar
ently, the author is not entirely
immune to the sort of "idealized
visions of the world" he protests.
Few of us are.
