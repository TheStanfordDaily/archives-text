When Brendan Kelly's friends
Id him the Stanford Band
mid only allow a woman to be
e Stanford Tree, he decided to
ove them wrong.
Acting on a dare from one of
s friends, Kelly set his sights on
•coming the Band's mascot. "1
id I could get it, and 1 did just
at," said Kelly, a fifth-year
nior from Seattle, Wash.
Despite his sincere desire to
come the Tree, Kelly said he
is rather blase about the appli
tion process. "1 filled out the
say three hours before it was
le and survived the 45-minute
terview," he said.
Kelly not only survived the in
rview, but convinced the Band
was the right man for the job.
"The next thing 1 knew, 50
and members showed up
itside my door at 2 a.m. and
asted me with a rocking rendi
>n of'All 1 Ever Wanted Was to
a With You,' " Kelly said.
Faced with this overwhelming
itiation, Kelly said he immedi
ely looked at the Oliver Wen
•11 Holmes quote on his wall
id repeated, "When God wants
punish you, he grants you your
ish."
Indeed, some would call
elly's recent misadventures
ith the Band a sort of punish
ent.

During this year's Big Game,
for example, Kelly fended off a
brutal attack by Berkeley band
members. "I was bummed when
they took the bear 1 was carry
ing," Kelly said of the assault.
"However, five minutes later,
with a new bear and a Cal band
member's hat, my spirits were
back up."
Kelly said that once Stanford
"got the Axe back, pretty much
everything else settled down. All

the Tree. Whether you like the new
look or not, you've got to admire the
creativity and energy he has put into
this low-paying job.'

arguments stopped there."
Todd Olson, the Band's former
manager, said he approved of
Kelly's aggressiveness at the
game. "What he did was OK,"
Olson said, adding that "he was
never on the offensive, as they
were attacking him. He was
within his rights; the Cal band
was out of line."
According to Olson, Kelly

stands out from Trees of the past.
"He has helped us in our objec
tive this year of creating more
crowd and band interaction," Ol
son said.
Comparing himself to past
Trees, Kelly said, "First of all
I'm male — which is a big
change. People tell me I'm much
more aggressive. I go into the au
dience all the time to talk to
people and make smart-aleck
comments," he said.

According to Kelly, he has the
most fun when spectators are un
familiar with the Band and its
reputation. "On the mall in
Boulder, (Colo., during the week
of the Stanford-Colorado game),
people stopped and really got
into it with us. For the first time I
finally understood why we're
'incomparable.'
Kelly said one of the best parts

of his job is "dancing in an offi
cial capacity with music that is
magical." He added that his fa
vorite tune is the Band's rendi
tion of the Hawaii Five-O theme
song.
New Band manager John
Manion said that although some
alumni have objected to Kelly's
overt aggressiveness, the overall
reaction has been positive.
"We've never had so many small
children follow the Band. He has
a real way with the kids,"'
Manion said.
According to Band member
Mark Anderson, Kelly has
"done incredible things for the
Tree. Whether you like the new
look or not, you've got to admire
the creativity and energy he has
put into this low-paying job."
Being the Tree isn't always
easy, Kelly said. In addition to
the attack at Big Game, last
spring at the Bay to Breakers run
in San Francisco, Cal band mem
bers tackled, punched and kicked
him.
In addition to working as the
Tree, Kelly is also involved in
other activities at Stanford. He
has acted in Gaeities the past two
years and helped write this year's
show.

University to approve his indi

license and plans to go to the
U.S. Navy Aviation Officer Can
didate School when he graduates
in June.
For now, though, Kelly will
continue as the Tree until he is
replaced in the spring.
Kelly represents the fourth
generation of his family to gradu
ate from Stanford and said his
relatives are thrilled he is the
Tree.
Although hiding underneath
his costume provides him with
relative anonymity, Kelly occa
sionally gets a taste of celebrity.
Once, while he was sitting next
to his easily recognizable Tree
costume, a passing student
stopped to ask Kelly if he was the
Tree and said, "1 didn't expect
you to look like that. You dance
like you've got rhythm. You're
great. My whole dorm loves
you!"
"Now that's what 1 like about
being the Tree,'' Kelly said.
