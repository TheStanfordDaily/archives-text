## Will Spielberg do justice to British novelist? New movie based on Ballard's 'Empire of the Sun' 
### Mark Tompkins Editorial staff 
I his month Steven Spielberg is going
to put away his toys and release
"Empire of the Sun, his latest film,
which is based on a 1984 novel by British
author J.G. Ballard.
Spielberg knows that it's time for him
to put up or shut up, and so he's picked
an unusual and exceptional work to
adapt. But the Big Question is: Will he
get it right? As a Ballard groupie, I see
red every time I think of someone violat
ing the master's work.
There's an outside chance that Spiel
berg will knock me for a loop. "Empire
of tne Sun" opens with the Japanese in
vasion of Shanghai in 1941 and tells the
adventures of Jim, an 11-year-old British
boy who is interned in a Japanese con
centration camp. There Jim, endures
harsh treatments and witnesses more of
the same. At the end of the war he sees
the atomic flash from Nagasaki and asks
if another war has just begun. The book
is told from Jim's reasonable yet irra
tional perspective, and Spielberg is fa
mous for getting inside the minds of
children (Ciod knows he's tried it enough
times).
I wonder what people will make of the
movie. Ballard, its author, isn't exactly a
household name over here. But he
deserves to be widely read; so let me
play matchmaker for a while. Welcome
to the world of J.G. Ballard.
Taking a broad cue from surrealist
painters like Dali, Magritte, Ernst and
the whole gang, Ballard takes powerful
modern symbols and juxtaposes them in
disturbing ways. Advertising, public re
lations and political propaganda have
left the "real'' world so devoid of
meaning that the only reality left is the
one inside our heads, according to Bal
lard.
As you might guess, Ballard is a long

way off from the territory covered by
most modern fiction. In interviews he is
refreshingly dismissive about most
modern fiction, especially English fic
tion, which he calls provincial and
tediously devoted to describing every
last nuance of human relationships at the
expense of telling what it's like to live on
this planet in this century. Ballard him
self is labeled a science-fiction writer,
which I've avoided mentioning until
now, because on hearing this far too
many people will want to banish him
from the grown-ups' table.

The book is at least semi
autobiographical, and the
roots of many of his obses
sions and symbols are evi
dent. Abandoned places,
drained swimming pools,
complete isolation, the life
and death of technology,
artificial man-made
landscapes and the Atomic
Age all figure into this book

He is, however, as critical of science
fiction as he is of other fiction, feeling
that most science fiction falls far short of
its potential as the folk literature of the
20th century. Ballard's motto is, "Earth
is the only alien planet." He believes
that science fiction is perfect for explor
ing earth as it is, not as it might be.
Born in Shanghai in 1930, Ballard
moved to England after World War 11.
After training as a doctor, he began
writing short stories in the late 19505. He

first made a name for himself in 1962
with "The Drowned World," the first of
several Ballard novels that mock the
conventions of the traditional disaster
novel. In"The Drowned World" earth
is reverting to its prehistoric state due to
mutated vegetation and the melting of
the polar ice caps. All of humanity is at a
loss except for the scientist hero, who
undergoes a total reorientation of his
personality in the face of earth's trans
formation.
Herein lies the twist of Ballard's disas
ter novels: His heroes don't fear
whatever natural disaster is occurring,
they actually embrace it. The hero of
"The Drowned World"' moves back
through psychic time, unconsciously ab
sorbing the landscapes of forgotten
epochs. He ultimately heads toward his
own death as he sets out for the burning
equator, "a second Adam searching for
the forgotten paradises of the reborn
sun." For Ballard, this is a happy end
ing.
Included among Ballard's prolific
1960s output were an uncharacteristi
cally light-hearted (for him) series of
stories about a Palm Springs-type resort
of the future. Collected as "Vermilion
Sands' (1971), these stories postulate a
future not in the manner of "1984," but
rather as one giant suburb, a huge
country-club belt where computers are
integrated into everv facet of life.
But it was in a 1964 story, "The Ter
minal Beach," that Ballard truly found
himself. Or more accurately, he found
his obsessions. The story is about an ex-
Air Force pilot who comes to Eniwetok,
the abandoned hydrogen bomb testing
site, to look for his dead wife and son.
I he landscape of bunkers and runways
mediates the rise of subconscious
meaning in the pilot's increasingly unsta
ble mind.
Here Ballard's inimitable style
reaches full development. Full of medi

cal jargon, obsessive and repetitive, it
avoids any whiff of the melodramatic.
For this reason critics bemoan the ap
parent amorality of Ballard's tone; and
yet a story like " The Terminal Beach" is
achinyly sad, especially when the hero
engages in a delusionary conversation
with the corpse of a Japanese doctor.
Continuing in this style, "The
Atrocity Exhibition" (1970) was the
novel that gave Ballard his reputation as
a full-fledged psycho and made Ameri
can publishers leery of him for years af
terward. "The Atrocity Exhibition"
may be fiction's most creative and ap
propriate response to the 19605, that

death-dance which began in Dallas in
1963. In an oblique and fragmented
style, the book tells of an insane psychi
atrist's attempts to align media events
(the Kennedy assassinations, the Viet
nam War, Marilyn Monroe and
Elizabeth Taylor) and physical things in
a way his psyche will find meaningful.
This is a strange, strange book. The
atmosphere is electric with violence and
sexuality, and the events described are
certainly shocking, but the flat, medical
tone denies the reader any emotional in
volvement.

Throughout the 1970s and
early 1980s, Ballard's work
found an increasing number of
admirers and defenders in Eng
land. Among the high points of
his work during this period are
"Crash" (1973), after whose
publication Ballard was told that
he was "beyond psychiatric
help." This book gives new
meaning to the term auto
eroticism, as it's about a small
group dedicated to exploring the
full meaning and psycho-sexual
potential of car crashes. Loudly
condemned in 1973, it has aged
well, especially in light of how
blatantly sensual and fetishistic
car commercials have become in
the last few years.
"Empire of the Sun," pub
lished in 1984, however, brought
Ballard widespread acclaim in
both England and America tor
the first time. In it he practically
decodes himselt. The book is at

least semi-autobiographical, and
the roots of many of his obses
sions and symbols are evident.
Abandoned places, drained
swimming pools, complete isola
tion, the life and death of tech
nology, artificial man-made
landscapes and the Atomic Age
all figure into this book. These el
ements have provided the main
action of Ballard's fiction for the
last 30 years.

Spielberg . . . has
picked an unusual and
exceptional work to
adapt.

Ideally, Steven Spielberg's
film adaptation will inspire a few
people to pick up a Ballard book,
and maybe more of his older
works will finally get printed
over here. To this day, Ihe
Atrocity Exhibition is still an al
most impossible book to find. 1

Spielberg . . . has
picked an unusual and
exceptional work to
adapt.

Ideally, Steven Spielberg's
film adaptation will inspire a few
people to pick up a Ballard book,
and maybe more of his older
works will finally get printed
over here. To this day, Ihe
Atrocity Exhibition is still an al
most impossible book to find. 1
wonder why Spielberg didn't
decide to do that one?
I his month Steven Spielberg is going
to put away his toys and release
"Empire of the Sun, his latest film,
which is based on a 1984 novel by British
author J.G. Ballard.
Spielberg knows that it's time for him
to put up or shut up, and so he's picked
an unusual and exceptional work to
adapt. But the Big Question is: Will he
get it right? As a Ballard groupie, I see
red every time I think of someone violat
ing the master's work.
There's an outside chance that Spiel
berg will knock me for a loop. "Empire
of tne Sun" opens with the Japanese in
vasion of Shanghai in 1941 and tells the
adventures of Jim, an 11-year-old British
boy who is interned in a Japanese con
centration camp. There Jim, endures
harsh treatments and witnesses more of
the same. At the end of the war he sees
the atomic flash from Nagasaki and asks
if another war has just begun. The book
is told from Jim's reasonable yet irra
tional perspective, and Spielberg is fa
mous for getting inside the minds of
children (Ciod knows he's tried it enough
times).
I wonder what people will make of the
movie. Ballard, its author, isn't exactly a
household name over here. But he
deserves to be widely read; so let me
play matchmaker for a while. Welcome
to the world of J.G. Ballard.
Taking a broad cue from surrealist
painters like Dali, Magritte, Ernst and
the whole gang, Ballard takes powerful
modern symbols and juxtaposes them in
disturbing ways. Advertising, public re
lations and political propaganda have
left the "real'' world so devoid of
meaning that the only reality left is the
one inside our heads, according to Bal
lard.
As you might guess, Ballard is a long

way off from the territory covered by
most modern fiction. In interviews he is
refreshingly dismissive about most
modern fiction, especially English fic
tion, which he calls provincial and
tediously devoted to describing every
last nuance of human relationships at the
expense of telling what it's like to live on
this planet in this century. Ballard him
self is labeled a science-fiction writer,
which I've avoided mentioning until
now, because on hearing this far too
many people will want to banish him
from the grown-ups' table.

The book is at least semi
autobiographical, and the
roots of many of his obses
sions and symbols are evi
dent. Abandoned places,
drained swimming pools,
complete isolation, the life
and death of technology,
artificial man-made
landscapes and the Atomic
Age all figure into this book

He is, however, as critical of science
fiction as he is of other fiction, feeling
that most science fiction falls far short of
its potential as the folk literature of the
20th century. Ballard's motto is, "Earth
is the only alien planet." He believes
that science fiction is perfect for explor
ing earth as it is, not as it might be.
Born in Shanghai in 1930, Ballard
moved to England after World War 11.
After training as a doctor, he began
writing short stories in the late 19505. He

first made a name for himself in 1962
with "The Drowned World," the first of
several Ballard novels that mock the
conventions of the traditional disaster
novel. In"The Drowned World" earth
is reverting to its prehistoric state due to
mutated vegetation and the melting of
the polar ice caps. All of humanity is at a
loss except for the scientist hero, who
undergoes a total reorientation of his
personality in the face of earth's trans
formation.
Herein lies the twist of Ballard's disas
ter novels: His heroes don't fear
whatever natural disaster is occurring,
they actually embrace it. The hero of
"The Drowned World"' moves back
through psychic time, unconsciously ab
sorbing the landscapes of forgotten
epochs. He ultimately heads toward his
own death as he sets out for the burning
equator, "a second Adam searching for
the forgotten paradises of the reborn
sun." For Ballard, this is a happy end
ing.
Included among Ballard's prolific
1960s output were an uncharacteristi
cally light-hearted (for him) series of
stories about a Palm Springs-type resort
of the future. Collected as "Vermilion
Sands' (1971), these stories postulate a
future not in the manner of "1984," but
rather as one giant suburb, a huge
country-club belt where computers are
integrated into everv facet of life.
But it was in a 1964 story, "The Ter
minal Beach," that Ballard truly found
himself. Or more accurately, he found
his obsessions. The story is about an ex-
Air Force pilot who comes to Eniwetok,
the abandoned hydrogen bomb testing
site, to look for his dead wife and son.
I he landscape of bunkers and runways
mediates the rise of subconscious
meaning in the pilot's increasingly unsta
ble mind.
Here Ballard's inimitable style
reaches full development. Full of medi

cal jargon, obsessive and repetitive, it
avoids any whiff of the melodramatic.
For this reason critics bemoan the ap
parent amorality of Ballard's tone; and
yet a story like " The Terminal Beach" is
achinyly sad, especially when the hero
engages in a delusionary conversation
with the corpse of a Japanese doctor.
Continuing in this style, "The
Atrocity Exhibition" (1970) was the
novel that gave Ballard his reputation as
a full-fledged psycho and made Ameri
can publishers leery of him for years af
terward. "The Atrocity Exhibition"
may be fiction's most creative and ap
propriate response to the 19605, that

death-dance which began in Dallas in
1963. In an oblique and fragmented
style, the book tells of an insane psychi
atrist's attempts to align media events
(the Kennedy assassinations, the Viet
nam War, Marilyn Monroe and
Elizabeth Taylor) and physical things in
a way his psyche will find meaningful.
This is a strange, strange book. The
atmosphere is electric with violence and
sexuality, and the events described are
certainly shocking, but the flat, medical
tone denies the reader any emotional in
volvement.

Throughout the 1970s and
early 1980s, Ballard's work
found an increasing number of
admirers and defenders in Eng
land. Among the high points of
his work during this period are
"Crash" (1973), after whose
publication Ballard was told that
he was "beyond psychiatric
help." This book gives new
meaning to the term auto
eroticism, as it's about a small
group dedicated to exploring the
full meaning and psycho-sexual
potential of car crashes. Loudly
condemned in 1973, it has aged
well, especially in light of how
blatantly sensual and fetishistic
car commercials have become in
the last few years.
"Empire of the Sun," pub
lished in 1984, however, brought
Ballard widespread acclaim in
both England and America tor
the first time. In it he practically
decodes himselt. The book is at

least semi-autobiographical, and
the roots of many of his obses
sions and symbols are evident.

nology, artificial man-made

I his month Steven Spielberg is going
to put away his toys and release
"Empire of the Sun, his latest film,
which is based on a 1984 novel by British
author J.G. Ballard.
Spielberg knows that it's time for him
to put up or shut up, and so he's picked
an unusual and exceptional work to
adapt. But the Big Question is: Will he
get it right? As a Ballard groupie, I see
red every time I think of someone violat
ing the master's work.
There's an outside chance that Spiel
berg will knock me for a loop. "Empire
of tne Sun" opens with the Japanese in
vasion of Shanghai in 1941 and tells the
adventures of Jim, an 11-year-old British
boy who is interned in a Japanese con
centration camp. There Jim, endures
harsh treatments and witnesses more of
the same. At the end of the war he sees
the atomic flash from Nagasaki and asks
if another war has just begun. The book
is told from Jim's reasonable yet irra
tional perspective, and Spielberg is fa
mous for getting inside the minds of
children (Ciod knows he's tried it enough
times).
I wonder what people will make of the
movie. Ballard, its author, isn't exactly a
household name over here. But he
deserves to be widely read; so let me
play matchmaker for a while. Welcome
to the world of J.G. Ballard.
Taking a broad cue from surrealist
painters like Dali, Magritte, Ernst and
the whole gang, Ballard takes powerful
modern symbols and juxtaposes them in
disturbing ways. Advertising, public re
lations and political propaganda have
left the "real'' world so devoid of
meaning that the only reality left is the
one inside our heads, according to Bal
lard.
As you might guess, Ballard is a long

way off from the territory covered by
most modern fiction. In interviews he is
refreshingly dismissive about most
modern fiction, especially English fic
tion, which he calls provincial and
tediously devoted to describing every
last nuance of human relationships at the
expense of telling what it's like to live on
this planet in this century. Ballard him
self is labeled a science-fiction writer,
which I've avoided mentioning until
now, because on hearing this far too
many people will want to banish him
from the grown-ups' table.

The book is at least semi
autobiographical, and the
roots of many of his obses
sions and symbols are evi
dent. Abandoned places,
drained swimming pools,
complete isolation, the life
and death of technology,
artificial man-made
landscapes and the Atomic
Age all figure into this book

He is, however, as critical of science
fiction as he is of other fiction, feeling
that most science fiction falls far short of
its potential as the folk literature of the
20th century. Ballard's motto is, "Earth
is the only alien planet." He believes
that science fiction is perfect for explor
ing earth as it is, not as it might be.
Born in Shanghai in 1930, Ballard
moved to England after World War 11.
After training as a doctor, he began
writing short stories in the late 19505. He

first made a name for himself in 1962
with "The Drowned World," the first of
several Ballard novels that mock the
conventions of the traditional disaster
novel. In"The Drowned World" earth
is reverting to its prehistoric state due to
mutated vegetation and the melting of
the polar ice caps. All of humanity is at a
loss except for the scientist hero, who
undergoes a total reorientation of his
personality in the face of earth's trans
formation.
Herein lies the twist of Ballard's disas
ter novels: His heroes don't fear
whatever natural disaster is occurring,
they actually embrace it. The hero of
"The Drowned World"' moves back
through psychic time, unconsciously ab
sorbing the landscapes of forgotten
epochs. He ultimately heads toward his
own death as he sets out for the burning
equator, "a second Adam searching for
the forgotten paradises of the reborn
sun." For Ballard, this is a happy end
ing.
Included among Ballard's prolific
1960s output were an uncharacteristi
cally light-hearted (for him) series of
stories about a Palm Springs-type resort
of the future. Collected as "Vermilion
Sands' (1971), these stories postulate a
future not in the manner of "1984," but
rather as one giant suburb, a huge
country-club belt where computers are
integrated into everv facet of life.
But it was in a 1964 story, "The Ter
minal Beach," that Ballard truly found
himself. Or more accurately, he found
his obsessions. The story is about an ex-
Air Force pilot who comes to Eniwetok,
the abandoned hydrogen bomb testing
site, to look for his dead wife and son.
I he landscape of bunkers and runways
mediates the rise of subconscious
meaning in the pilot's increasingly unsta
ble mind.
Here Ballard's inimitable style
reaches full development. Full of medi

cal jargon, obsessive and repetitive, it
avoids any whiff of the melodramatic.
For this reason critics bemoan the ap
parent amorality of Ballard's tone; and
yet a story like " The Terminal Beach" is
achinyly sad, especially when the hero
engages in a delusionary conversation
with the corpse of a Japanese doctor.
Continuing in this style, "The
Atrocity Exhibition" (1970) was the
novel that gave Ballard his reputation as
a full-fledged psycho and made Ameri
can publishers leery of him for years af
terward. "The Atrocity Exhibition"
may be fiction's most creative and ap
propriate response to the 19605, that

death-dance which began in Dallas in
1963. In an oblique and fragmented
style, the book tells of an insane psychi
atrist's attempts to align media events
(the Kennedy assassinations, the Viet
nam War, Marilyn Monroe and
Elizabeth Taylor) and physical things in
a way his psyche will find meaningful.
This is a strange, strange book. The
atmosphere is electric with violence and
sexuality, and the events described are
certainly shocking, but the flat, medical
tone denies the reader any emotional in
volvement.

Throughout the 1970s and
early 1980s, Ballard's work
found an increasing number of
admirers and defenders in Eng
land. Among the high points of
his work during this period are
"Crash" (1973), after whose
publication Ballard was told that
he was "beyond psychiatric
help." This book gives new
meaning to the term auto
eroticism, as it's about a small
group dedicated to exploring the
full meaning and psycho-sexual
potential of car crashes. Loudly
condemned in 1973, it has aged
well, especially in light of how
blatantly sensual and fetishistic
car commercials have become in
the last few years.
"Empire of the Sun," pub
lished in 1984, however, brought
Ballard widespread acclaim in
both England and America tor
the first time. In it he practically
decodes himselt. The book is at

least semi-autobiographical, and
the roots of many of his obses
sions and symbols are evident.
Abandoned places, drained
swimming pools, complete isola
tion, the life and death of tech
nology, artificial man-made
landscapes and the Atomic Age
all figure into this book. These el
ements have provided the main
action of Ballard's fiction for the
last 30 years.

Spielberg . . . has
picked an unusual and
exceptional work to
adapt.

Ideally, Steven Spielberg's
film adaptation will inspire a few
people to pick up a Ballard book,
and maybe more of his older
works will finally get printed
over here. To this day, Ihe
Atrocity Exhibition is still an al
most impossible book to find. 1
wonder why Spielberg didn't
decide to do that one?
