## UC-Irvine upsets Stanford in NCAAs 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
LONG BEACH â€” It was a disap
pointing way to end the season for a
group of athletes who have grown to
expect the best from themselves and
their teammates . . . and to expect that
their best would bring a national cham
pionship.
The Stanford water polo program
has finished among the nation's top
three in 10 of the last 12 years, finish
ing fourth one year and with no
ranking the other. Six of these years
the Cardinal won the title.
This year, with a team that included
11 players from last year's undefeated
NCAA champions (36-0), six of whom
also played on the 1985 championship
team, the Stanford squad entered the
national tournament ranked fourth
with a chance to match the successes
of its predecessors.
It was a team capable of ending up
first with the right breaks, or in sixth
with no breaks at all. Yesterday after
noon's loss to Pepperdine put the Car

dinal into the sixth-place slot.
Stanford finished the season 20-9.
Late last night, California (27-3)
captured its seventh NCAA title in 14
years, defeating No. 2-seeded USC 9-8
in overtime.
With an unforgiving draw ahead of
it, the Cardinal knew it would have to
play its best all weekend. In its first
match, Friday against No. 5 UC-
Irvine, Stanford kept hinting that it
might take control and defeat the Ant
eaters.
Key Stanford mistakes, however,
and opportunistic (if unspectacular)
Irvine play gave the Anteaters a semi
final berth and put the Cardinal right
into the loser's bracket.
"An inch here and an inch there,
and we win the game," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "We
played well enough to win, but the
breaks of the game just didn't go in our
favor. We made those two mental er
rors, and they took advantage of them.
That's what it boiled down to."
The mental errors Dettamanti
referred to came on the defensive end

of the team's operation, and each
lapse gave the Anteaters an opportu
nity they couldn't pass up. Mean
while, the offensive heroics necessary
to make up for the defensive errors
were not there for the Cardinal.
Stanford's major offensive force,
senior Erich Fischer, started things off
appropriately Friday with the game's
first goal. Throughout the tournament,
Fischer excelled despite frequent
physical assaults committed against
him by opposing players without repri
mand from the referees.
Down 1-0, Irvine never fell behind
the Cardinal again. Early in the second
period, Mike Halphide put the An
teaters up by one, only to see his work
negated on the next Stanford posses
sion, when senior Matt Tingler fought
off a fierce Anteater defense, emerging
from a frenzy of action to score 26
seconds later.
On the next series Irvine came right
back, as its standout two-meter man,
Mike Doting, scored his first of two
goals. Again, Stanford tied on a goal
by sophomore Erik Blum just a minute
and a half later, and there the teams
stayed, at 3-3, until the final seconds
of the half.
After Stanford had consistently
created offensive opportunities only to
find Anteater goalie Mark Maizel or
shooting inaccuracy blocking the path
to a one-goal lead, Irvine's Julian Har
vey gave the Cardinal an example of
how it should be done; he scored with
only 25 seconds left on the clock. One
final Cardinal charge was to no avail,
and Irvine led 4-3.
The Anteaters took advantage of a
6-on-5 situation created by the ejection
of Fischer and went up by two goals
less than a minute into the third quar
ter. Midway through the period,
Fischer countered on a Cardinal man
up advantage; but again, Irvine would
not let the Cardinal get too close. With
eight seconds remaining in the quarter.
Doting scored again to put his team up
6-4.


Benjamin long/Daily
Despite Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti's tactic of shuffling in several fresh players at a
time, including sophomore Krik Blum, the No. 4 C ardinal came up short against fifth
seeded UC-Irvine 8-6.
