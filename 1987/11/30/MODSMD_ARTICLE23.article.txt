# Fischer, Tingler excel in tournament
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
LONG BEACH — Stanford water
polo's grim NCAA tournament
weekend was an unfitting end to the
storybook careers of seniors Erich
Fischer and Matt Tingler.
Fischer was a prominent member of
the 1985 Cardinal NCAA champion
ship team and was named second-team
All-America last year when he set the
school scoring record of 87 goals (also
accomplished last season by the now
graduated Craig Klass).
This year, "Fish" scored 64 goals,
and Stanford counted on him for a

third of its total goal production. He
was one of the four Pacific 10 Confer
ence players to be voted unanimously
to the all-conference team. When it
really counted, and usually even if it
didn't, Fischer was the man on offense
for this fall's Cardinal.
The passes leading to Fischer's
goals most often came from Tingler.
Tingler was an All-American last year
and scored the title-winning overtime
tally against UC-lrvine in 1985's
NCAA tournament. Tingler, besides
performing his playmaker role nearly
to perfection, scored 30 goals of his
own this fall, second best on the
squad.
Tingler seems to pull out all the
stops for the NCAA tournament
each year. In addition to his
clutch play in 1985 and his partic
ipation on last season's champi
onship team, Tingler repeatedly
led Stanford from behind against
the Anteaters Friday. Known for
his quickness and consistent
defense, the senior from New
port Beach snuck behind Irvine
defenders to score two goals in
the contest.
The inspired play of Tingler
and Fischer against Irvine Friday
and vs. Pepperdine yesterday
was a dazzling display of polo
prowess that surely satisfied any
fans curious as to whether the
two were as good as they had
heard.
The Cardinal scored 18 goals in
the two games. Fischer or
Tingler either scored or assisted
on 14 of these tallies. They

combined with each other on six
goals, and each provided the as
sist for the other's final goal yes
terday.
"Tney really have been doing
that all year," Dettamanti said in
reaction to his two stars' play.
"They're the two guys we've
been counting on all year, and
they came through again."

They really have been
doing that all year.
They're the two guys
we've been counting
on all year, and they
came through again.'

Both will continue to play
water polo. Fischer is considered
a strong candidate for the 1992
U.S. Olympic Team. Never,
though, will they be as important
to their teams as they were to this
year's Cardinal.
