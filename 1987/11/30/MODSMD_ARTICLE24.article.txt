# Cardinal 2-1 in Maui Classic
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball team
returns from the Hawaiian Islands today
with a 2-1 record and the knowledge that
the Cardinal can compete with one of
the best teams in the country.
After leading the llth-ranked lowa
Hawkeyes by as much as 15 points in
both the first and second half Friday,
Stanford finally succumbed to lowa's
full-court pressure and bowed to the
Hawkeyes 78-75 in the first round of the
Hawaiian Airlines/Maui Classic in
Lahaina, Maui.
Coach Mike Montgomery's Cardinal
squad rebounded from the lowa defeat
to beat the Chaminade Silverswords 93-
82 and the Baylor Bears 69-56 to win the
consolation round championship.
lowa played Villanova late last night
in the tournament championship game.
In the Stanford-lowa contest Friday
afternoon, the Cardinal played an im
peccable game for 28 minutes, but the
Hawkeyes' relentless pressure finally
took its toll.
"lowa was clearly the aggressor in the
second half," Montgomery said. "The
situation changed in the second half. We
backed off a bit, and it got physical. We
got tentative and could not get the final
spurt to put us over the hump."
Stanford led 41-26 with three minutes
left in the first half and 61-46 with 12:34
left in the game before the Hawkeyes
ran off a 20-5 spurt to even the score at
66-66 with five minutes remaining.
Remarkably, in that stretch not a
single foul was called on the lowa
players, who executed a continuous full
court press. The lead changed hands
several times in the final minutes until
Hawkeye guard B.J. Armstrong sank a
crucial baseline jumper with 1:05 left to
put lowa up 73-70.
Stanford had one last chance to tie the
game with 24 seconds left. With the
score 73-71, Cardinal guard Scott
Meinert grabbed a rebound off of a
missed Greg Butler free throw, but
Meinert's hurried eight-foot jumper
from the baseline fell short. lowa for
ward Bill Jones sealed the victory with
three free throws down the stretch.
Jones led lowa in scoring with 17
points, and Armstrong finished with 16.
Butler paced the Cardinal with 19
points, and point guard Terry Taylor
finished with 17, including five three
pointers.
Stanford outrebounded lowa 33-29 â€”
the first time the Hawkeyes have been
outrebounded since Tom Davis took
over as coach. Cardinal forward
Howard Wright pulled down 10 boards.
Stanford guard Todd Lichti contrib
uted a relatively disappointing 11 points,
shooting 4-for-14 from the field. Lichti
also missed most of the last 10 minutes
of the contest because of foul trouble.
"We were really up for the game
against lowa," Lichti said. "However,
we were not able to hit our shots, and

they were able to play extremely well in
the second half."
Lichti came back Saturday afternoon
in a big way, scoring a career-high 31
points in the victory over Chaminade,
including 23 in the second half.
'I thought Todd had a good game
(against Chaminade),'* Montgomery
said. "He played aggressively and went
to the ball both offensively and
defensively."
Although Stanford led throughout, the
Cardinal could never break out to a big
lead thanks to an K-for-12 three-point
shooting performance by the Sil
verswords.
"We just could never shake them
off," Montgomery said. "Our execution

wasn't very good, and we allowed them
to hit a high percentage of shots."
In last night s consolation champion
ship game, Stanford defeated a talented
Baylor team, which has been picked by
some to win the Southwest Conference
title this year.
Lichti continued his torrid pace,
scoring 27 points on the night, including
a perfect 14-for-14 performance from the
foul line. In the three tournament
games, Lichti scored 69 points and shot
28-for-31 from the free-throw line.
Montgomery's squad opened up a 50-
40 lead with nine minutes left, but
Baylor trimmed that to 50-46 before
Stanford pulled away for the 69-56 win.
