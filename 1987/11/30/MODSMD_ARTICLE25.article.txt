# Card women's hoops defeats Utah, BYU
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
A trip to Utah — what a great way
to start.
Mirroring its success at the start of
last season, the Stanford women's
basketball team, rated No. 20 in the
Associated Press and Street and
Smith's preseason polls, opened its
1987-88 schedule with a bang,
soundly defeating Utah 87-71 Friday
night and squeaking by Brigham
Young 84-83 Saturday.
"It was a very good weekend for
the team," Stanford Coach TaraVan-
Derveer said. "We are aware of
things we have to work on, but it was
a really good start. I was real pleased
with the overall intensity and enthu
siasm."
The season-opener against the
Utes went almost without a hitch.
The Stanford squad got out to a fast
start and enjoyed a 48-33 lead at
halftime.
Thanks to outstanding play by
junior center Jill Yanke and sopho
more guard Jennifer Azzi, the Cardi
nal never looked back. Yanke went
8-for-13 for 19 points and provided
excellent defense.
Despite her smaller stature, the 5-
foot-7 Azzi commanded more atten
tion and was Stanford's ace in the
hole. Using the new three-point rule
to her advantage, she led the team
with 20 points, shooting 4-for-6 from
the field, recording four assists and
garnering three steals.
"The game was characterized by
Jill running the fast break and Jenni
fer bombing them from three," Van-
Derveer said. "It was a great team
effort running, but Jill ran especially
well and rebounded pretty well."
Perhaps the Cardinal squad's big
gest strength was its depth. VanDer
veer used all of her players in the
contest, which helped minimize the
effects of Salt Lake City's high alti
tude on any one player.
"The players were definitely af
fected by the altitude," she said.
" They played hard for three or four
minutes, then took a break."
Defense posed a problem as well.
Stanford was tough on the boards but
also gave its opponent many scoring
opportunities.
"We had some trouble defending
Tiffany Rogers-Kramer," said Van-
Derveer of the contest with the Utes.
The 6-2 senior forward rattled off 30
points against the Cardinal.
"We saw that we needed to work
on improving our defense and our
timing on offense," VanDerveer said.
Saturday night's game at BYU was
certainly more dramatic. The
Cougars beat Stanford last year on
the Farm 94-82, which helped set the
stage for a close contest this year.
Once again, the Cardinal got off to
a very fast start, getting out to quick

15-4 and 17-5 leads, but the Cougars
came back to lead by 11 at the half.
"We got out to a quick start and
then just blanked out," VanDerveer
said. "At one time we were down 42-
29, but people began to play really
focused. It's the first time that 1 can
remember Stanford being down by as
much as 13 and coming back to win."
In the last six minutes of the game
the Cardinal did just that, and the
unlikely heroine of the moment was
freshman forward Celeste Lavoie.
Most of the fans at BYU had their
eyes set on Azzi, who last year re
corded Stanford's first-ever triple
double against the Cougars at Maples
Pavilion, but it wasn't until Azzi
fouled out that the game became
riveting to watch.

'They said prayers at
BYU before the game
started, but it was our
prayers that came true
with those shots/
— Tara VanDerveer

"Jennifer fouled out with 6:04
remaining, and Charli Turner came
in," VanDerveer said. "We were
down by seven, and from that point
on things looked up. Charli got the
ball to Jill, who got two big baskets
down the stretch."
With 30 seconds left, sophomore
forward Katy Steding tied up the
score at 83-83 with two quick nuck
ets. "Katy had two unbelievable
moves, two steals and really
acrobatic moves with shots that were
almost prayers," VanDerveer said.
"They said prayers at BYU before
the game started, but it was our
prayers that came true with those
shots."
Enter Lavoie. With less than five
seconds left in the game, Lavoie was
ton led by I raci Red on an offensive
rebound, bringing her to the free
throw line to shoot two. The Cougars
took a time out in an attempt to shake
the Ireshman, but Lavoie dropped
the shot to give the Cardinal a one
point advantage. She missed the
second shot, but a rebound by
Steding ended the game.
I here was no doubt in my mind
that she (Laroiel was going to make
it, " VanDerveer said.
Lavoie and Yanke led Stanford's
scoring effort with 17 points each.
BYU's Cathy Nixon tallied 10-of-l7
shots for a game-high 2N points.
However, as in Friday's game,
rebounding saved the Cardinal.
I he story of the second game
was rebounding," VanDerveer said.
Offensive rebounding really won
the game for us."
