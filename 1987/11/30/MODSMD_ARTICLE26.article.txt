# No. 2 Hawaii upends spikers

At least the weather was nice.
The Stanford women's volley
hall team just returned home
from five days in Hawaii, where
it suffered two losses to second
ranked Hawaii. The No. 3 Cardi
nal didn't quite have enough to
beat the Rainbow Wahines on
their home court, falling Wednes
day 10-15, 15-7, 9-15, 15-7, 15-7,
and again Friday, 15-13, 15-10,
12-15, 15-11.
With the losses, Stanford
ended its regular season at 25-6,
while Hawaii improved to 32-2.
Both teams will open the NCAA
playoffs late this week with
teams and sites yet to be deter
mined.
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said
he saw many good things in the
two losses. "The matches were
very competitive," he said. "It
wasn't by any means a lost
weekend."
Both teams were trying for a
good showing in their final
matches of the regular season.
The NCAA will announce
seedings and pairings for the
playoffs today, and both Stan
ford and Hawaii are hoping to be
the top seed in their respective
regions.
Stanford will be playing in the
West region, containing teams
from the Pacific 10, High
Country Athletic and West Coast
Athletic Conferences. Because
the Cardinal is the highest-rated
team in the region, Stanford ap

pears to have the edge for the
region's top seed, and may be the
host of the regional tournament
next week.
The region is full of good
teams, however, as No. 4 BYU,
No. 5 UCLA, No. 6 Colorado
State and No. 18 Pepperdine are
also in contention. The region
also boasts USC, Oregon, Cali
fornia, Arizona and Arizona
State, all in the nation's top 30.
Hawaii is in the Northwest
region with all the other schools
from the Pacific Coast Athletic
Conference. Besides No. 2
Hawaii, this region has top
ranked Pacific and four other
top-20 teams.
The two other regions seem al
most empty this year, as each has
only three top-20 teams. In the
Mideast, Illinois is the favorite to
be the representative in the Final
Four. The eighth-ranked Illinois
will be tested, however, as No.
10 Nebraska will be looking to
match its perfornmace last year,
when it reached the title match
before falling to Pacific.
In the South, Texas is in the
driver's seat as it looks to return
to the Final Four. The Lady
Longhorns have reached the No.
7 spot in the polls, thanks to a
win over Illinois and two tri
umphs over Nebraska in the last
three weeks. Ninth-rated Ken
tucky, 29-1 this year, will provide
the biggest roadblock for Texas.
The Hawaiians nut on a show
in trying to earn tne top seed in
the Northwest this weekend;
their efforts may well have

earned them the right to host the
regional tournament. This would
provide a big advantage for them
in the event they face Pacific for
a Final Four berth, since the
Rainbow Wahines traditionally
play much better at home.
In addition, most other teams
are not usually prepared to deal
with the heat, humidity and dis
tractions of Hawaii. "It's really
tough to win over there," Shaw
said. "Their home-court advan
tage is worth three to five points
a game."
These disadvantages did not
seem to affect the Cardinal much
during the beginning of Wednes
day's match, however. The Car
dinal was able to jump out to a
two-games-to-one lead behind
the play of seniors Nancy Reno
and Teresa Smith.
At this point, Hawaii Coach
Dave Shoji got a little desperate
and tried a different lineup. He
removed senior Tita Ahuna, a
second-team Ail-American each
of the last two years, and
replaced her with freshman
Karrie Trieschman. This allowed
him to also switch sophomore
Teee Williams from the middle to
the outside, where she has been
more effective.
Trieschman's fine play made
Shoji look like a genius, and the
team s other middle blocker,
Suzanne Eagye, got hot. Eagye
finished with IS kills, 14 of which
came in the last two games.
