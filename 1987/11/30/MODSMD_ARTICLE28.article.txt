"If something means some
thing. then sacrifices are noth
ing," 1972 Olympic wrestling
champion and national wrestling
guru Dan Gable once said.
Truer words were never
spoken for members of the Stan
ford wrestling team Friday, who
sacrificed hearty Thanksgiving
dinners Thursday in order to
"make weight" in preparation
for a meet against the Western
Oregon State Wolves.
This dedication paid off for the
Cardinal on the team s first major
road trip of the season last
weekend, when it faced the
Wolves and Oregon. Stanford
returned with a win against the
Wolves and a loss against
Oregon, bringing its overall
record to 2-2.

"I felt pretty good about the
trip overall," Stanford Coach
Chris Horpel said.
Making an early start Friday
morning, the wrestlers flew to
Eugene, Ore., then packed into
vans for the trip to Western
Oregon State, which is near Cor
vallis. Upon arriving in Eugene,
the team donned layers of sweat
suits for the traditional pre
weigh-in workout designed to
burn off excess weight.
All nine Cardinal wrestlers
weighed in and proceeded to
dominate the Wolves by a team
score of 48-6. The only points
given up by Stanford were due to
a forfeit at I IS pounds.
Demonstrating their experi
ence over Western Oregon
State's first-year program, all but
one Cardinal wrestler beat his

opponent by either a fall or a
technical fall. A technical fall oc
curs when one wrestler takes a
15-point lead in a match.
James Dinette, the single ex
ception in the pinning exhibition,
won his 142-pound match by a re
spectable score of 10-5.
In the lighter weights, fresh
man Loren Vigil pinned Mike
Halbleib in the second round of
the 126-pound match, and junior
Josh Lisle, at 134 pounds, re
corded a technical fall over Phil
Anderson.
Sophomore Geoff Baum also
pinned his opponent, 150-pound
Buddy Pucket, in the second
round. The victory was Baum's
first of the season.
Sophomore 158-pounder Steve
Yarbrough brought home the
meet's quickest pin only 1:15 into
the first period.
Following that performance,
167-pound Steve Buddie im
proved his season record to 2-0
with a first round technical fall
over Darin Shimanek. Buddie, a
freshman from lowa, has been a
consistent performer for Stan
ford since he challenged senior
tri-captain Eric Harber for his
starting position.

Sophomore Kon Perry re
corded a technical fall at 177
pounds, and senior Terry
Mclntyre brought in a shoulders
to-the-mat fall at 190 pounds.
Freshman Dave Nahama
tallied six more team points for
Stanford as Western Oregon
State forfeited the heavyweight
division.
Moving on to Eugene Satur
day, Stanford faced a much more
experienced team at Oregon. The
Ducks have only lost to the Car
dinal once in 15 years, and this
year the trend continued.
Coming off a bright day against
the Wolves, Stanford lost in all
but two of its matches at Oregon,
bowing 34-9.
Highlights of the afternoon
came in the 158- and 167-pound
brackets for the Cardinal, where
the team's only two undefeated
wrestlers posted victories.
At 158 pounds, Yarbrough
decisioned his Duck 5-2 to put
three team points on the board
for Stanford. Buddie, at 167
pounds, added six more before
Stanford's point column became
dormant for the day.
Buddie, upping his season
record to 3-0, posted a fall over
Danny White of Oregon. Buddie
has now won all of his matches
by fall or technical fall, but it ap
peared that even he was
surprised at the outcome of this

match.
"Steve was on his back on top
of the guy and pinned him in an
'airplane,' " teammate Jeremy
Newman said. "He got up with a
grin on his face and pointed at
coach (Horpel) like, 'You guys
aren't going to believe I really
pinnednim.
The "airplane," normally a de
fensive maneuver, was turned
into an offensive position by
Buddie.
Despite Buddie's efforts, he
couldn't spark a rally in the Car
dinal upper weight divisions. At
177 pounds. Perry was beaten 7-
6, his third match of the season
decided by just one point. The
other two matches were decided
in Perry's favor.
Mclntyre lost as well, by a
score of 6-4, and was followed by
Nahama at heavyweight, who
was pinned 2:39 into the first
round.
"We were in it right until the
end," Horpel said. "Perry and
Mclntyre could have won at the
final bell."
Oregon, which has already
beaten last year s NCAA Divi
sion II champion Bakersfield this
season, boasts a comparatively
experienced team.
"We were out-techniqued and
intimidated in some matches. It's
to be expected with the younger
guys on the team," Horpel said.
