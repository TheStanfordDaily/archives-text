"If something means some
thing. then sacrifices are noth
ing," 1972 Olympic wrestling
champion and national wrestling
guru Dan Gable once said.
Truer words were never
spoken for members of the Stan
ford wrestling team Friday, who
sacrificed hearty Thanksgiving
dinners Thursday in order to
"make weight" in preparation
for a meet against the Western
Oregon State Wolves.
This dedication paid off for the
Cardinal on the team s first major
road trip of the season last
weekend, when it faced the
Wolves and Oregon. Stanford
returned with a win against the
Wolves and a loss against
Oregon, bringing its overall
record to 2-2.

"I felt pretty good about the
trip overall," Stanford Coach
Chris Horpel said.
Making an early start Friday
morning, the wrestlers flew to
Eugene, Ore., then packed into
vans for the trip to Western
Oregon State, which is near Cor
vallis. Upon arriving in Eugene,
the team donned layers of sweat
suits for the traditional pre
weigh-in workout designed to
burn off excess weight.
All nine Cardinal wrestlers
weighed in and proceeded to
dominate the Wolves by a team
score of 48-6. The only points
given up by Stanford were due to
a forfeit at I IS pounds.
Demonstrating their experi
ence over Western Oregon
State's first-year program, all but
one Cardinal wrestler beat his


Heryamin long/Daily
Senior Matt Tingler, with two NCAA championship rings, is at his best
at NCAA tournament time. Despite his efforts, however, victory
escaped the Cardinal in Long Beach Friday.
