# Arms control conference
## Chances are slim for Sakharov visit 
### Bobby Schrader Staff writer 
Organizers of next weekend's arms con
trol symposium here have become
"increasingly pessimistic" about Soviet
physicist Andrei Sakharov's chances of
attending the conference, according to
David Bernstein, assistant director of the
conference.
Despite exhaustive appeals to Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev from confer
ence organizer Sidney Drell and the presi
dents of Stanford, Princeton and MIT, no
official word has come from the Soviet
government as to whether Sakharov will
receive permission to make his scheduled
speech in Memorial Auditorium Saturday
evening.
Although they have not abandoned all
hope of a Sakharov visit, Drell and
Bernstein said they remain baffled at the
Soviets apparent reluctance to allow the
Sakharov visit.
"We simply can't see why they
wouldn't let him out," Bernstein said.
"Although some people maintain that
Sakharov knows too much about top
secret research to be allowed out of the
country, I must point out that he has not
worked on anything classified in over 20
years."
Pointing out the coincidental timing of
the Stanford symposium with the Reagan-
Gorbachev summit in Washington, Politi
cal Science Prof. David Holloway said the
Soviets might be afraid that Sakharov's
presence at the conference may "detract
from the attention on Gorbachev's visit."
Holloway also suggested that Soviet
hard-liners resentful of Sakharov's past
political activism might have pressured
Gorbachev not to allow the visit. The posi
tive publicity the trip would likely attract
in the West might have been judged by

Gorbachev as not worth the domestic po
litical costs of allowing the visit.
"Many of the political attitudes that un
derlay (Sakharov'sl exile have not
vanished completely," Holloway said.
"Even though Gorbachev echoes some of
those criticisms which Sakharov leveled
against Soviet society, Gorbachev might
feel he has has no particular incentive to
let him go because of sticky political prob
lems."
Although an early announcement by
Drell of Sakharov's invitation to the sym
posium generated a flurry of media atten
tion, Drell said the issues raised by the
conference "should not be overshadowed
by the presence or absence of one man."
"Whether he (Sakharov) shows or not,
we still have a substantial body of
speakers," Drell said.
Bernstein said that if Sakharov does not
receive permission to visit the conference,
a panel discussion will be substituted in
Sakharov's 6 p.m. time slot.
The panel will discuss the recent politi
cal, technological and economic develop
ments in the Soviet Union and their impli
cations for arms control and international
security, Bernstein said.
Drell will serve as mediator and the
nanel will feature Soviet experts including
Holloway; Alexander Dallin, professor of
history and political science; Robert Con
quest, senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution; David Perlman, sci
ence editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle; and Wolfgang Panofsky, direc
tor emeritus of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center.
"In the event that Sakharov can make
the conference after all, the speech will go
on as scheduled, and the members of the
panel will hold a question-and-answer ses
sion for the audience with Sakharov,"
