# Stanford experts:
## On-site verification is key to arms treaty 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Kxtensive on-site verification
is the most important provision
in last week's U.S.-Soviet agree
ment to scrap all ground
launched intermediate-range nu
clear missiles, Stanford arms
control experts said yesterday.
"The Soviets certainly have
changed their position," said
Physics Prof. Sidney Drell, co
director of the Stanford Center
for International Security and
Arms Control. "In this treaty
they allow much more of an on

site presence than ever before."
Scheduled to he signed by
President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev at a
Washington, D C., summit meet
ing next week, the treaty will al
low both countries to inspect two
missile production sites before,
during and after the three-year
long dismantling process. In the
ensuing 10 years, 'challenge" in
spections of suspected missile
hiding places are also provided
for under the terms of the treaty,
which will abolish all ground
launched missiles with a range
between 300 and 3000 miles.

These provisions are consid
ered a breakthrough because the
Soviets have traditionally oppos
ed on-site inspections, saying
they are too intrusive; this has
forced the United States to rely
heavily on satellite intelligence to
verify arms pacts.
Drell speculated that Gorba
chev's policy of "glasnost," or
openness, may have influenced
Soviet negotiators, but stressed
that a "new realism" among the
Soviets was ultimately responsi
ble for the policy switch.
"They quite correctly gauge
that on the American side there is

equal resistance to the idea of on
site inspections," he said, refer
ring to the hesitance of the CIA
and the National Security
Agency to open sensitive manu
facturing sites to Soviet visitors.
Condoleezza Rice, assistant
professor of political science,
predicted that the verification
precedent set by the treaty would
help current negotiations to pare
down the levels of conventional
forces in Europe.
"There's a greater openness
by the Soviet military in gen
eral." said Rice. "Confidence
building measures in conven

tional forces, such as the ex
change of military observers be
tween NATO and the Warsaw
Pact, pointed toward this, and
on-site verification can only in
crease the likelihood of a conven
tional forces agreement."
Rice said the reduction of con
ventional forces, although
"difficult to achieve," is the next
logical step toward alleviating
military tension in Europe. West
Germany in particular has in
sisted that NATO ensure con
ventional parity with the Warsaw
Pact before proceeding with fur
ther nuclear disarmament.
Although he said he did not
foresee an agreement to limit
conventional arms in the near fu
ture, Political Science and His
tory Prof. Alexander Dallin said
he agreed with Rice that a per
ceived imbalance of conventional
forces in Europe is creating ten
sion.
"On the whole, the agreement
won't create a security crisis in
Europe," Dallin said. "But the

(West) Germans are in the most
difficult position. They're afraid
of decoupling.'
Decoupling refers to the theory
that if the United States
withdraws its "nuclear guaran
tee" to defend the West at all
costs, the likelihood that the
Warsaw Pact would invade
Western Europe would increase.
Although the new treaty will
remove over 500 Pershing and
ground-launched cruise missiles,
it allows NATO to retain several
categories of battlefield nuclear
weapons under the 300-mile
ceiling, as well as air- and sea
launched missiles. NATO there
fore will maintain its long

standing posture of "flexible
response" to Soviet aggression.
Rice noted that the role of the
European-based Pershing II as a
quicic strike strategic missile
against Soviet command centers
could be assumed by longer
range intercontinental missiles.
Rice said that of all categories
of nuclear weapons, the inter
mediate-range missiles were
probably the "easiest" to
remove.
Dallin predicted that because
of domestic political pressures
"the only other accord that could
be achieved within the Reagan
term would be a 50 percent re
duction in strategic weapons."

of decoupling.'
Decoupling refers to the theory
that if the United States
withdraws its "nuclear guaran
tee" to defend the West at all
costs, the likelihood that the
Warsaw Pact would invade
Western Europe would increase.
Although the new treaty will
remove over 500 Pershing and
ground-launched cruise missiles,
it allows NATO to retain several
categories of battlefield nuclear
weapons under the 300-mile
ceiling, as well as air- and sea
launched missiles. NATO there
fore will maintain its long

standing posture of "flexible
response" to Soviet aggression.
Rice noted that the role of the
European-based Pershing II as a
quicic strike strategic missile
against Soviet command centers
could be assumed by longer
range intercontinental missiles.
Rice said that of all categories
of nuclear weapons, the inter
mediate-range missiles were
probably the "easiest" to
remove.
Dallin predicted that because
of domestic political pressures
"the only other accord that could
be achieved within the Reagan
term would be a 50 percent re
duction in strategic weapons."
Kxtensive on-site verification
is the most important provision
in last week's U.S.-Soviet agree
ment to scrap all ground
launched intermediate-range nu
clear missiles, Stanford arms
control experts said yesterday.
"The Soviets certainly have
changed their position," said
Physics Prof. Sidney Drell, co
director of the Stanford Center
for International Security and
Arms Control. "In this treaty
they allow much more of an on

site presence than ever before."
Scheduled to he signed by
President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev at a
Washington, D C., summit meet
ing next week, the treaty will al
low both countries to inspect two
missile production sites before,
during and after the three-year
long dismantling process. In the
ensuing 10 years, 'challenge" in
spections of suspected missile
hiding places are also provided
for under the terms of the treaty,
which will abolish all ground
launched missiles with a range
between 300 and 3000 miles.

These provisions are consid
ered a breakthrough because the
Soviets have traditionally oppos
ed on-site inspections, saying
they are too intrusive; this has
forced the United States to rely
heavily on satellite intelligence to
verify arms pacts.
Drell speculated that Gorba
chev's policy of "glasnost," or
openness, may have influenced
Soviet negotiators, but stressed
that a "new realism" among the
Soviets was ultimately responsi
ble for the policy switch.
"They quite correctly gauge
that on the American side there is

equal resistance to the idea of on
site inspections," he said, refer
ring to the hesitance of the CIA
and the National Security
Agency to open sensitive manu
facturing sites to Soviet visitors.
Condoleezza Rice, assistant
professor of political science,
predicted that the verification
precedent set by the treaty would
help current negotiations to pare
down the levels of conventional
forces in Europe.
"There's a greater openness
by the Soviet military in gen
eral." said Rice. "Confidence
building measures in conven

tional forces, such as the ex
change of military observers be
tween NATO and the Warsaw
Pact, pointed toward this, and
on-site verification can only in
crease the likelihood of a conven
tional forces agreement."
Rice said the reduction of con
ventional forces, although
"difficult to achieve," is the next
logical step toward alleviating
military tension in Europe. West
Germany in particular has in
sisted that NATO ensure con
ventional parity with the Warsaw
Pact before proceeding with fur
ther nuclear disarmament.
Although he said he did not
foresee an agreement to limit
conventional arms in the near fu
ture, Political Science and His
tory Prof. Alexander Dallin said
he agreed with Rice that a per
ceived imbalance of conventional
forces in Europe is creating ten
sion.
"On the whole, the agreement
won't create a security crisis in
Europe," Dallin said. "But the

(West) Germans are in the most
difficult position. They're afraid
of decoupling.'
