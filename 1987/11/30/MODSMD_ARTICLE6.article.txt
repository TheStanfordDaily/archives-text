# Peace groups form PAC
## Committee will endorse candidates for local office 
### Frank Quaratiello Staff writer 
Members of several Stanford and Bay Area
based peace groups have joined together to form a
political action committee that will endorse candi
dates for local office.
The stated purpose of the Political Impact Coali
tion of Northern California, known as PIC-PAC, is
to allow members of area peace groups such as
Physicians for Social Responsibility, the New
Forum, Beyond War and concerned members of
the public to play a more direct role in local
politics.
PIC-PAC Chair Walter Hays said the aim of the
group, which currently has 24 members, "is to or
ganize support for candidates who have a broader
definition of national security than just weapons."
"Education and health issues are an important
part of keeping America strong and secure," Hays
said. "We need more of a balance."
Both Hays and Sylvia Rogers, a member of the
MKmember PIC-PAC board that will guide the or
ganization, agreed that the group will focus its at
tention on the 12th Congressional District race.
The coalition may. however, eventually become
active in national politics, Hays said.
In an effort to remain nonpartisan, PIC-PAC
plans to endorse both a Democratic and a Republi
can candidate in the 12th District primary election
and then to support one candidate in the final elec
tion, Rogers said.
So far. PIC-PAC has interviewed all but one of

the declared candidates in the race, Rogers said.
PIC-PAC has also sent out questionnaires to the
candidates to supplement the interviews.
Democratic candidate Jim Garrison said he is
actively seeking PIC-PAC"s endorsement. Law
Prof. Tom Campbell, who is running for the Repub
lican nomination, said he simply "met with them
like 1 would any group that asked to talk with me."
The other candidates could not be reached for com
ment last night.
Hays said that PIC-PAC is already starting to
make an impact on the Bay Area's political scene in
that it has begun changing the agendas of some can
didates.
"Candidates are very eager to talk to us," he
said. "Just the fact that this organization exists
forces candidates to look at the issue of national se
curity."
According to Rogers, another goal of PIC-PAC is
to increase public awareness about national secu
rity issues.
The organization plans to hold a forum in Kresge
Auditorium Jan. 29 for 12th District candidates to
exchange their views on national security issues.
Hays said.
Garrison said he would attend, but Campbell
said, "I am in the process of making that deci
sion."
Campbell said the forum "seems like a
worthwhile idea," adding that he hoped Republi
can incumbent Rep. Frnie Konnyu would attend
According to Hays, Konnyu has
neither agreed nor declined to
participate.
After the forum, members of
PIC-PAC will determine which

candidates they will support in
the primary election and will an
nounce their recommendations.
Each member of PIC-PAC
must donate at least $100 to the
organization. The money will
serve as a financial base for the
organization and will also be

used to support candidates en
dorsed by PIC-PAC, Hays said.
Since state and federal laws
limit the amount of money politi
cal action committees can donate
to candidates, PIC-PAC mem
bers will also do volunteer work
for the candidates they endorse,
Hays said.
