Korean jet is missing over Burma
SEOUL, South Korea — A Korean Air passenger jet with 115
people aboard disappeared over Southeast Asia yesterday and
was feared to have crashed while traveling here from the Middle
East.
The jet was over Burma, en route from Abu Dhabi, in the
United Arab Emirates, to Bangkok for a refueling stop when air
traffic controllers lost contact, airline and Korean government
officials said yesterday.
If the plane crashed, it would be the second major airline dis
aster in two days. A South African Airways jumbo jet carrying
160 people crashed Saturday off the Indian Ocean island of
Mauritius, killing all aboard.
The Korean plane, a four-engine Boeing 707, was believed to
have crashed near the Thailand-Burma border, but no wreckage
had been found in the dense jungle area. Officials did not rule
out the possibility that the aircraft was hijacked or otherwise
targeted by terrorists.
' We can't exclude the possibility of the KAL airliner being
missing, having an emergency landing or involved in a hijack
ing," said South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Kim
Hang Kyong.
Burmese government officials conducted ground and air
searches of the border area yesterday but said they found no
signs of a crash. Korean television reported this morning that a
team of 21 government and airline investigators, including KAL
chairman Cno Chong Hoon, left today for Bangkok.
Haitian voting halted by violence
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haiti's first free election in 30
years collapsed yesterday in gory violence.
At least 30 people died in Port-au-Prince alone, 17 of them in a
brutal and bloody schoolhouse massacre. It was feared that the
toll will be much higher when the turmoil that accompanied the
opening of the polls subsides.
Witnesses saw troops of the U.S.-supported provisional gov
ernment — which had pledged to safeguard the voting — join
plain-clothes killers in the schoolhouse massacre and other vio
lent incidents in the capital. The United States responded by
suspending all non-humanitarian economic aid to the army
dominated provisional government.
Gunmen and in at least two cases police and army troops also
fired on foreign journalists and election observers, killing a
Dominican Republic television cameraman.
The Rev. Leslie Griffiths, a Church of England observer, said
that two parishioners died when rock- and gun-wielding bands
invaded and desecrated four Roman Catholic churches. "They
struck old people on their heads with rocks," Griffiths said. He
said that witnesses identified 17 Army troops in another attack
that silenced the Catholic radio station.
France releases Iranian in trade
PARIS — The French government allowed Wahid Gordji, an
Iranian official suspected of helping terrorists in Paris, to leave
the besieged Iranian Embassy and return home to Iran yester
day as part of an obvious trade for the two French hostages
released by their captives in Beirut two days ago.
The office of Premier Jacques Chirac, in a carefully worded
statement, also held out the hope that Iran would now use its in
fluence to help arrange the release of the three other French
hostages in Beirut.
The departure of Gordji, holed up in the embassy for five
months, also appeared to signal an end to what the French press
had called "the war of the embassies" and could signal an early
resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
France broke relations with Iran over Gordji last July 17.
On the surface, France, in releasing Gordji, merely followed
its normal judicial procedures. The 27-year-old Gordji, officially
listed as an embassy interpreter but widely regarded as an intel
ligence agent, had refused for five months to leave the embassy
and submit to questioning by the French judge in charge of the
investigation of the terrorist bombings that killed 13 people in
Paris during the fall of 1986.
Suddenly, at 6:30 p.m. yesterday, Gordji, under police escort,
was whisked in a black Mercedes to the Palace of Justice to be
questioned by the investigating judge.
There was little doubt about the outcome of the questioning.
A small jet plane was already waiting for Gordji at Le Bourget
airport north of Paris.
Turnout low in Polish reform vote
WARSAW, Poland — The government reported a turnout
barely adequate to allow success yesterday as Poles voted in a
national referendum on political and economic reforms, includ
ing radical price increases.
Official reports said that approximately 63 percent of Poland's
26 million eligible voters had cast their ballots by 8 p.m. yester
day evening, two hours before the polls closed, on two proposi
tions covering official plans for a "radical healing" of the eco
nomy and a "Polish model" of political reform.
The referendum was the first held in Poland since 1946 and
was described by officials as a step toward democratization and
the "socialist pluralism" promised by the reform plan.
However, critics said the propositions offered voters no
reasonable choice, and contended that the balloting amounted
to an attempt to make Poles feel obliged to accept price in
creases next year.
Early results indicated that the government might record the
lowest total turnout ever reported in an election under commu
nist rule. However, the vote appeared high enough to allow pas
sage of both propositions, which require approval by more than
50 percent of registered voters for passage.
The turnout total is important for the government of Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski because it indicates to what extent Poles
may be reidy to accept austerity measures, including a doubling
of basic food prices and a tripling of rents and utilities next year.
The banned Solidarity trade union condemned the referendum
as a propaganda stunt and advised Poles not to vote.
Lawmakers ask for Philippine aid
WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of lawmakers has
asked President Reagan to launch an international, five-year,
multibillion-dollar "Marshall Plan" for the Philippines to help
President Corazon Aquino carry out a peaceful transition to
democracy there.
Their letter sent last Wednesday said the United States has a
major interest in helping the Aquino government meet the politi
cal and economic challenges it faces. The goals, according to the
letter, are to assure continued access to the U.S. military bases
at Subic Bay and Clark Air Field and to prevent the failure of
democracy there.
The authors of the letter are Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.),
chairman of the Senate subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific
affairs, and his House counterpart, Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-
N.Y.).

Haitian voting halted by violence
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haiti's first free election in 30
years collapsed yesterday in gory violence.
At least 30 people died in Port-au-Prince alone, 17 of them in a
brutal and bloody schoolhouse massacre. It was feared that the
toll will be much higher when the turmoil that accompanied the
opening of the polls subsides.
Witnesses saw troops of the U.S.-supported provisional gov
ernment — which had pledged to safeguard the voting — join
plain-clothes killers in the schoolhouse massacre and other vio
lent incidents in the capital. The United States responded by
suspending all non-humanitarian economic aid to the army
dominated provisional government.
Gunmen and in at least two cases police and army troops also
fired on foreign journalists and election observers, killing a
Dominican Republic television cameraman.
The Rev. Leslie Griffiths, a Church of England observer, said
that two parishioners died when rock- and gun-wielding bands
invaded and desecrated four Roman Catholic churches. "They
struck old people on their heads with rocks," Griffiths said. He
said that witnesses identified 17 Army troops in another attack
that silenced the Catholic radio station.
France releases Iranian in trade
PARIS — The French government allowed Wahid Gordji, an
Iranian official suspected of helping terrorists in Paris, to leave
the besieged Iranian Embassy and return home to Iran yester
day as part of an obvious trade for the two French hostages
released by their captives in Beirut two days ago.
The office of Premier Jacques Chirac, in a carefully worded
statement, also held out the hope that Iran would now use its in
fluence to help arrange the release of the three other French
hostages in Beirut.
The departure of Gordji, holed up in the embassy for five
months, also appeared to signal an end to what the French press
had called "the war of the embassies" and could signal an early
resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
France broke relations with Iran over Gordji last July 17.
On the surface, France, in releasing Gordji, merely followed
its normal judicial procedures. The 27-year-old Gordji, officially
listed as an embassy interpreter but widely regarded as an intel
ligence agent, had refused for five months to leave the embassy
and submit to questioning by the French judge in charge of the
investigation of the terrorist bombings that killed 13 people in
Paris during the fall of 1986.
Suddenly, at 6:30 p.m. yesterday, Gordji, under police escort,
was whisked in a black Mercedes to the Palace of Justice to be
questioned by the investigating judge.
There was little doubt about the outcome of the questioning.
A small jet plane was already waiting for Gordji at Le Bourget
airport north of Paris.
Turnout low in Polish reform vote
WARSAW, Poland — The government reported a turnout
barely adequate to allow success yesterday as Poles voted in a
national referendum on political and economic reforms, includ
ing radical price increases.
Official reports said that approximately 63 percent of Poland's
26 million eligible voters had cast their ballots by 8 p.m. yester
day evening, two hours before the polls closed, on two proposi
tions covering official plans for a "radical healing" of the eco
nomy and a "Polish model" of political reform.
The referendum was the first held in Poland since 1946 and
was described by officials as a step toward democratization and
the "socialist pluralism" promised by the reform plan.
However, critics said the propositions offered voters no
reasonable choice, and contended that the balloting amounted
to an attempt to make Poles feel obliged to accept price in
creases next year.
Early results indicated that the government might record the
lowest total turnout ever reported in an election under commu
nist rule. However, the vote appeared high enough to allow pas
sage of both propositions, which require approval by more than
50 percent of registered voters for passage.
The turnout total is important for the government of Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski because it indicates to what extent Poles
may be reidy to accept austerity measures, including a doubling
of basic food prices and a tripling of rents and utilities next year.
The banned Solidarity trade union condemned the referendum
as a propaganda stunt and advised Poles not to vote.
Lawmakers ask for Philippine aid
WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of lawmakers has
asked President Reagan to launch an international, five-year,
multibillion-dollar "Marshall Plan" for the Philippines to help
President Corazon Aquino carry out a peaceful transition to
democracy there.
Their letter sent last Wednesday said the United States has a
major interest in helping the Aquino government meet the politi
cal and economic challenges it faces. The goals, according to the
letter, are to assure continued access to the U.S. military bases
at Subic Bay and Clark Air Field and to prevent the failure of
democracy there.
The authors of the letter are Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.),
chairman of the Senate subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific
affairs, and his House counterpart, Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-

Korean jet is missing over Burma
SEOUL, South Korea — A Korean Air passenger jet with 115
people aboard disappeared over Southeast Asia yesterday and
was feared to have crashed while traveling here from the Middle
East.
The jet was over Burma, en route from Abu Dhabi, in the
United Arab Emirates, to Bangkok for a refueling stop when air
traffic controllers lost contact, airline and Korean government
officials said yesterday.
If the plane crashed, it would be the second major airline dis
aster in two days. A South African Airways jumbo jet carrying
160 people crashed Saturday off the Indian Ocean island of
Mauritius, killing all aboard.
The Korean plane, a four-engine Boeing 707, was believed to
have crashed near the Thailand-Burma border, but no wreckage
had been found in the dense jungle area. Officials did not rule
out the possibility that the aircraft was hijacked or otherwise
targeted by terrorists.
' We can't exclude the possibility of the KAL airliner being
missing, having an emergency landing or involved in a hijack
ing," said South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Kim
Hang Kyong.
Burmese government officials conducted ground and air
searches of the border area yesterday but said they found no
signs of a crash. Korean television reported this morning that a
