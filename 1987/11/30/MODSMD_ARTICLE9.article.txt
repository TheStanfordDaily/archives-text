# Cuban riot collapses in Louisiana

### 
OAKDALE, La. — Cuban detainees who
had controlled the Federal Detention Center
here for eight days surrendered yesterday
and released their 26 hostages, all in good
health.
The surrender came after intervention by
Agustin Roman, the Cuban-born auxiliary
bishop of the Archdiocese of Miami. The
detainees had demanded his presence since
Friday, when an earlier agreement to release
the hostages broke down.
Federal officials refused to detail the terms
of their agreement with the detainees.
"To disclose those details would be unfair
to the hostages" still held by a second group
of Cuban detainees at the federal penitentiary
in Atlanta, said J.D. Williams, regional direc
tor of the federal Bureau of Prisons, who
commanded the operation here.
A lawyer for Roman, however, showed a
copy of the seven-point agreement to
reporters. It does not guarantee the Cubans
against deportation but provides for addi
tional individual review of their cases and
amnesty for damage done in the takeover.
Resolution of the situation in Oakdale,
however, appeared to have no immediate ef
fect on the crisis at the federal penitentiary in
Atlanta, where 90 hostages still were being
held. Cuban inmates released four hostages

early in the day and federal authorities said
that the move was cause for some optimism.
Negotiations between federal officials and
the Cuban detainees there went on during the
day, including a face-to-face meeting be
tween an FBI negotiator and one of the
prisoners — the first such session since
Thursday.
Release of the Oakdale hostages was
greeted with shouts of joy by relatives and
friends, who had gathered earlier in the day
for services in the local Roman Catholic
church.
Attorney General Edwin Meese 111, in a
statement released in Washington, said, "I
am very pleased that the situation in Oakdale
has been peacefully resolved and that all . . .
those held hostage are safe and in good condi
tion. . . . While this is understandably a time
of rejoicing and thanksgiving, the Depart
ment of Justice will not rest until the situation
in Atlanta is peacefully concluded, and all the
hostages there are released."
Roman also mentioned Atlanta, saying at a
press conference that "I am ready" to go
there if federal officials request his presence.
Speaking in Spanish, he sent a message to
the Cubans there: "A man who wants liberty
cannot hold another in prison," he said.
Asked about the agreement, Williams said:

"We did not give away the store. ... (It is]
an agreement that we can all live with."
Williams added that he had guaranteed
Roman that the detainees would be treated
fairly.
"There will be no reprisals" against the
roughly I (KM) detainees, who will be dispersed
to other federal prisons on a "beds-available
basis," he said.
Asked why the government had waited un
til yesterday to bring Roman to Oakdale, Wil
liams said only that "in negotiations, there is
a time and place for everything." Roman's
attorney, Rafael Penalver, who accompanied
the bishop here, said that the agreement in
cludes provision for careful and expeditious
review of each detainee's case.
Efforts will be made to ensure due process,
including input from the Cuban community,
and all detainees with medical problems, in
cluding mental illness, will be treated, he
said. In addition, any detainee eligible and
wanting to go to another country could re
quest a hearing.
Talks to free the hostages had broken down
Friday over detainees' demand that a third
party witness the agreement between them
and the government. Later that day they
decided that the witness should be Roman.
