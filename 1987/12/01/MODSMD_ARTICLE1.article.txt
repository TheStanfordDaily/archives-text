# NCAA offers drug test revisions
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
In answer to a Santa Clara
County Superior Court order, the
NCAA yesterday submitted a
proposal to revise its drug-testing
program for Stanford football
and men's basketball players.
According to University attor
ney Debra Zumwalt, the two
page brief proposes changes in
NCAA hearing procedures for
athletes who test positive for
drugs. The brief also suggests
eliminating the ambiguous phrase
". . . and related compounds"
from the NCAA's list of over
3000 banned drugs, Zumwalt
said.
The text of the brief filed by
NCAA attorneys Richard Archer
and Christine Hanson was not
available last night, and Archer
and Hanson could not be reached
for comment.
Zumwalt said that in her
assessment, the brief "doesn't
meet the intent of the court's or
der."
"It doesn't answer the
criticism of the court that the
testing is highly intrusive, and it
doesn't significantly reduce the
list of banned drugs that the
judge found over-broad," she
said.
All Stanford athletes except
those in football and men's bas-
ketball were exempted from drug
testing by a preliminary injunc
tion against the NCAA drug
testing program granted Nov. 19
by Santa Clara County Superior
Court Judge Conrad Rushing.
Football and men's basketball
were singled out by Rushing as
the only sports demonstrating "a
compelling need" for the NCAA
program to override the U.S. and
California constitutions' protec
tions of privacy. After hearings
scheduled to begin Friday, Rush
ing will rule whether to include
an injunction for the two sports
in his final decision.
Zumwalt said the University
and attorneys for Stanford stu
dent plaintiffs Barry McKeever
and Jennifer Hill will submit
answering briefs this week in
preparation for Friday's court
date.
In his intended ruling, Rushing
commended the NCAA for
"attempting to do justice" to ath
letes wno test positive for drugs
in its ad-hoc hearing procedure,
he directed however that more
specific guidelines should be es
tablished.
Rushing's intended ruling
harshly rebukes the NCAA for

the "uncertainty" of the phrase
. .and related compounds" on
its banned drug list because, he
argues, it does not respect "the
right of an athlete to know when
his conduct is innocent." The
revised list for the new program
reportedly strikes the phrase.
But the NCAA apparently did
not eliminate any specific drugs
from the list, such as the over
the-counter drug Sudafed, which
Rushing said was "unnecessary"
for the NCAA to include in its
program.
The brief submitted today ap
peared to be the first move in an
attempt by the NCAA to attack
the substance of Rushing's in
tended ruling. John Kitchen,
head attorney for the NCAA,
said yesterday that the brief con
tains "a proposal for football and
men's basketball, as the judge re
quested, while preserving the
right to object to the ruling it
self."
Asked how the NCAA planned
to criticize the ruling. Kitchen
said the NCAA would point out
in court Dec. 4th "several blatant
factual errors" in the text of
Rushing's decision. He gave as
an example a passage from the
decision in which Rushing said
Hill, a women's soccer player,
had undergone drug testing.
Hill, a senior, has confirmed
that she in fact was not tested last

year because the soccer team
failed to qualify for postseason
competition.
Zumwalt discounted the
NCAA's charge. "It's not impor
tant whether Hill actually was
tested," she said. "What's im
portant is what would have hap
pened had she been tested."
The ambivalence surrounding
the intended ruling handed down
Nov. 19 may clear up this week
as attorneys for the NCAA and
for McKeever reply to the
judge's decision.
The NCAA expressed mixed
reactions to the ruling when it
first came out. "We're encour
aged and disappointed at the
ruling," said Jim Marchiony, a
press secretary at NCAA
headquarters in Mission, Kan.
Marchiony said the NCAA
was "pleased that one of the
plaintiffs lost," referring to Stan
ford football player Barry
McKeever, who unlike women's
soccer player Jennifer Hill was
not granted an injunction.
University President Donald
Kennedy is among those who
doubt the NCAA can effectively
meet the requirements of Rush
ing's intended decision. "I chal
lenge you to determine how a
program would be set up to test
that would be within the spirit of
the decision," Kennedy said last
week.

first came out. "We're encour
aged and disappointed at the
ruling," said Jim Marchiony, a
press secretary at NCAA
headquarters in Mission, Kan.
Marchiony said the NCAA
was "pleased that one of the
plaintiffs lost," referring to Stan
ford football player Barry
McKeever, who unlike women's
soccer player Jennifer Hill was
not granted an injunction.
University President Donald
Kennedy is among those who
doubt the NCAA can effectively
meet the requirements of Rush
ing's intended decision. "I chal
lenge you to determine how a
program would be set up to test
that would be within the spirit of
the decision," Kennedy said last
week.
In answer to a Santa Clara
County Superior Court order, the
NCAA yesterday submitted a
proposal to revise its drug-testing
program for Stanford football
and men's basketball players.
According to University attor
ney Debra Zumwalt, the two
page brief proposes changes in
NCAA hearing procedures for
athletes who test positive for
drugs. The brief also suggests
eliminating the ambiguous phrase
". . . and related compounds"
from the NCAA's list of over
3000 banned drugs, Zumwalt
said.
The text of the brief filed by
NCAA attorneys Richard Archer
and Christine Hanson was not
available last night, and Archer
and Hanson could not be reached
for comment.
Zumwalt said that in her
assessment, the brief "doesn't
meet the intent of the court's or
der."
"It doesn't answer the
criticism of the court that the
testing is highly intrusive, and it
doesn't significantly reduce the
list of banned drugs that the
judge found over-broad," she
said.
All Stanford athletes except
those in football and men's bas-
ketball were exempted from drug
testing by a preliminary injunc
tion against the NCAA drug
testing program granted Nov. 19
by Santa Clara County Superior
Court Judge Conrad Rushing.
Football and men's basketball
were singled out by Rushing as
the only sports demonstrating "a
compelling need" for the NCAA
program to override the U.S. and
California constitutions' protec
tions of privacy. After hearings
scheduled to begin Friday, Rush
ing will rule whether to include
an injunction for the two sports
in his final decision.
Zumwalt said the University
and attorneys for Stanford stu
dent plaintiffs Barry McKeever
and Jennifer Hill will submit
answering briefs this week in
preparation for Friday's court
date.
In his intended ruling, Rushing
commended the NCAA for
"attempting to do justice" to ath
letes wno test positive for drugs
in its ad-hoc hearing procedure,
he directed however that more
specific guidelines should be es
tablished.
Rushing's intended ruling
harshly rebukes the NCAA for

the "uncertainty" of the phrase
. .and related compounds" on
its banned drug list because, he
argues, it does not respect "the
right of an athlete to know when
his conduct is innocent." The
revised list for the new program
reportedly strikes the phrase.
But the NCAA apparently did
not eliminate any specific drugs
from the list, such as the over
the-counter drug Sudafed, which
Rushing said was "unnecessary"
for the NCAA to include in its
program.
The brief submitted today ap
peared to be the first move in an
attempt by the NCAA to attack
the substance of Rushing's in
tended ruling. John Kitchen,
head attorney for the NCAA,
said yesterday that the brief con
tains "a proposal for football and
men's basketball, as the judge re
quested, while preserving the
right to object to the ruling it
self."
Asked how the NCAA planned
to criticize the ruling. Kitchen
said the NCAA would point out
in court Dec. 4th "several blatant
factual errors" in the text of
Rushing's decision. He gave as
an example a passage from the
decision in which Rushing said
Hill, a women's soccer player,
had undergone drug testing.
Hill, a senior, has confirmed
that she in fact was not tested last

year because the soccer team
failed to qualify for postseason
competition.
Zumwalt discounted the
NCAA's charge. "It's not impor
tant whether Hill actually was
tested," she said. "What's im
portant is what would have hap
pened had she been tested."
The ambivalence surrounding
the intended ruling handed down
Nov. 19 may clear up this week
as attorneys for the NCAA and
for McKeever reply to the
judge's decision.
The NCAA expressed mixed
reactions to the ruling when it
first came out. "We're encour
aged and disappointed at the
ruling," said Jim Marchiony, a
