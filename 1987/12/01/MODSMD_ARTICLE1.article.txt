# NCAA offers drug test revisions
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
In answer to a Santa Clara
County Superior Court order, the
NCAA yesterday submitted a
proposal to revise its drug-testing
program for Stanford football
and men's basketball players.
According to University attor
ney Debra Zumwalt, the two
page brief proposes changes in
NCAA hearing procedures for
athletes who test positive for
drugs. The brief also suggests
eliminating the ambiguous phrase
". . . and related compounds"
from the NCAA's list of over
3000 banned drugs, Zumwalt
said.
The text of the brief filed by
NCAA attorneys Richard Archer
and Christine Hanson was not
available last night, and Archer
and Hanson could not be reached
for comment.
Zumwalt said that in her
assessment, the brief "doesn't
meet the intent of the court's or
der."
"It doesn't answer the
criticism of the court that the
testing is highly intrusive, and it
doesn't significantly reduce the
list of banned drugs that the
judge found over-broad," she
said.
All Stanford athletes except
those in football and men's bas-
