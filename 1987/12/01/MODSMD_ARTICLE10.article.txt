## Stocks, dollar fall sharply 
### 
NEW YORK — Sideswiped
by the dollar's continuing plunge
on foreign exchange markets, the
stock market staggered to its
worst trading day in more than a
month yesterday as nervous in
vestors took cover against the
prospects of another market
crash.
The Dow Jones industrial
average suffered its eighth
largest point loss on record —
falling 76.93 points to close at
1833.55 in the New York Stock
Exchange's 12th-busiest day
ever. Broader market measures
suffered similar setbacks, and
about eight stocks declined for
every one that rose on the Big
Board.
But when the day was over, in

vestors and traders took some
solace in knowing that the
damage could have been far
worse. In the first half-hour of
trading the Dow fell 56.37 points,
and by mid-afternoon the loss
had widened to 110. Analysts
said that only some late
afternoon fishing for good buys
saved the index of 30 blue-chip
stocks from its third-worst day
ever.
The magnitude but not the di
rection of the market surprised
traders and analysts. When last
week's trading ended with a drop
in the Dow, snapping a 21-year
string of Thanksgiving holiday
rallies, predictions were
widespread that stocks would
nose-dive yesterday.

"This was foreshadowed on
Friday," said Hildegarde Zag
orski, a market strategist for
Prudential-Bache Securities in
New York. "Before we even
opened, we knew which direc
tion we were headed."
Retailers added to the gloomy
picture by turning in mixed
reports about their crucial post-
Thanksgiving sales — a key in
dicator of what lies ahead for the
economy, because the Friday
after Thanksgiving is usually the
busiest shopping day of the year.
And to make matters worse,
U.S. investors awoke to discover
that the dollar's value had sunk
overnight to post-World War II
lows against the Japanese yen
and the West German mark amid

foreign investors' fears that
Congress won't act quickly to
rein in the federal budget deficit
and that U.S. officials are con
tent to let the dollar's value drift.
Such declines in the dollar's
value auger higher inflation,
higher interest rates and a
gloomier economy at home, and
they make foreign products more
expensive and thus less competi
tive in the United States.
The combination drew waves
of sellers into the trading pits and
threw the stock market into a
tailspin. Traders said that many
stocks opened the day fully two
to four points lower than their
close on Friday.
