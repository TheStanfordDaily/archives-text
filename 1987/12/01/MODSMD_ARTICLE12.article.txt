# Electronic mail forgery on the rise
## 
### Otto Lin Staff writer 
Academic Information Re
sources (AIR) officials have re
ported an increase in the number
of cases of student-forged e
lectronic mail (E-mail) on the
University's computer systems,
a violation of the 112 undamental
Standard punishable by suspen
sion, according to Sean Welsh,
division director of AIR.
Welsh said several students
have sent E-mail claiming that it
is from somebody else. These
cases have been referred to the

Judicial Affairs Office, he said.
The systems staff of the
Facilities and Operations Depart
ment of AIR discovered the mail
forgery, Welsh said. Apparently,
some of the fraudulent messages
were erroneously coded and
could not he delivered. The
messages were detected by sys
tems staff members, who then
closely monitored suspicious ac
counts to identify the culprits.
The cases were then brought to
the attention of the directors,
who decided to press charges.
According to Welsh, the
"policy statement" each LOTS

user is required to read before he
or she can open an account
clearly "forbids fraudulent be
havior that degrades another's
use of these facilities." E-mail
forgery can therefore be classi
fied as a violation of the Funda
mental Standard, he said.
Welsh said messages have al
ready been put in the "policy
statement" and on the public bul
letin board at LOTS (Low Over
head Timesharing System) warn
ing users to be cautious about
messages they receive.
Some students, however, are
apparently still unaware that E

mail forgery violates the Funda
mental Standard. Impersonations
that are without malicious intent
are just as much a violation as
deliberate forgery, he said.
According to Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole, many Stan
ford students inadvertently vio
late the Honor Code and the Fun
damental Standard because they
are not sufficiently familiar with
these policies. Cole said that only
a portion of the violations are in
tentional, adding that accidental
violations are especially regret
table because "they are the most
easily rectified or avoided."
