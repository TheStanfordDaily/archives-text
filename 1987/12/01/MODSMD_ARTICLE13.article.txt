# Expert says studies remain inconclusive
## Ozone layer deterioration could spread 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Although a 50 to M) percent re
duction in the ozone layer over
Antarctica occurs annually in
October and November, current
studies have proven inconclusive
as to whether this ozone hole will
spread over the rest of the globe,
an expert on the earth's atmos
phere said here yesterday.
Although some of the
molecules that shield the Earth
from the sun's harmful ultravio
let rays are replenished, over 45
percent of the layer has been

destroyed in the last 15 years, ac
cording to Owen Toon, a senior
fellow at NASA.
NASA has been conducting
several studies to determine if
the ozone hole will spread to in
habited regions of the earth, but
further studies are needed. Toon
said.
Currently, "No one is predict
ing any major decrease in the
ozone layer globally," he said.
According to Toon, who spoke
in Skilling Auditorium, one of the
harmful effects of a decrease in
ozone is the lack of adequate
shielding from the sun's ultravio

let rays, which can cause skin
cancer in humans after prolonged
exposure.
A I-percent decrease in ozone
in the atmosphere could increase
the cases of skin cancer by 2 per
cent, he said.
A complete depletion of ozone
would destroy all life on Earth,
Toon added.
There are two main theories
that attempt to explain the
decrease in ozone over the South
Pole.
The "dynamic theory" argues
that ozone from the lower atmos

phere is swept up into the upper
atmosphere, where it is then
destroyed. The "chemical the
ory" argues that the unique
climate and temperature fluctua
tions in Antarctica allow for reac
tions to take place between
ozone and ozone-destroying
molecules.
Though NASA has performed
several chemical experiments
over the South Pole during the
past few years and much
evidence indicates the validity of
the chemical theory. Toon said,
"the jury is still out" on both
theories.
