## The
						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Zip change not enough 
### 
The Stanford Post Office has been a chronic
source of frustration for as long as most of us can
remember.
Around this time every year, as the holiday
mail rush begins, the inadequacies of the Post
Office become even more acutely apparent.
The long lines, slow delivery and broken
stamp machines are a daily reminder that Soviet
style bureaucratic bumbling is alive and well
right here in Palo Alto.
To be fair, there have been a few indications
recently that Big Brother might just be listening
(at least a little bit) to complaints from below.
Last spring, for example, the Post Office in
stalled more P.O. boxes. Unfortunately,
however, the office's trademark long lines and
slowness don't seem to have eased much.
Four weeks ago, postal officials announced
the creation of a new zip code for Stanford
boxholders. The Post Office claims that chang
ing the zip from 94305 to 94309 — a change that
goes into effect today — will make the the sort
ing and processing of mail significantly more ef
ficient. Despite the fact that the new code was
announced only a few weeks before its imple
mentation — making transition and compliance
difficult at best — the new zip is a hopeful sign
that postal officials are thinking about ways to

improve the deplorable conditions at the Post
Office.
However, it should be clear to anyone who
has used the Post Office recently that a whole lot
more than a new zip code will be necessary to
correct the facility's unacceptably poor perform
ance.
The Stanford Post Office is woefully under
staffed and underfunded. The building it is
housed in — particularly the area where postal
customers are forced to cluster together for the
requisite 15-30 minute wait for service — is sim
ply not adequate to the demands placed on it. To
make it equal to the task of serving the demands
of a large university, the Post Office needs to
receive a significant boost in the financing it gets
from the U.S. Postal Service.
The University should apply its considerable
clout to the urgent task of getting its post office
up to minimal standards of efficiency and ser
vice. If the University is capable of landing
major Defense and Energy Department research
contracts, it is certainly capable of putting a little
pressure on national postal authorities.
The campus will soon have a glistening new
Childrens' Hospital and an entirely new Near
West scientific complex. Why not a workable
Post Office?
