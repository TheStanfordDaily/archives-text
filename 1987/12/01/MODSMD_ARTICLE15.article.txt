Offensive sermon
shows importance
of communication
As planners of the "You Can
Make A Difference" conference,
our hope was to close our pro
gram with a sense of unity. In
stead, Rev. Lawrence Carter's
sermon Sunday, Nov. 15,
created separation. After dis
cussing the incident in depth, we
realize that our job and our edu
cation on the complexities of
race and culture has just begun.
We anticipated that Cartel
would deliver a sermon accen
tuating the mutual cooperation
that was so much a part of this
conference. However, he ini
tially focused on a partial and
slanted account of the Jews of
the biblical period. Failing to
subsequently place the group in a
light of contemporary responsi
bility, he perpetuated dangerous
stereotypes 01 Jewish values.
He took an opportunity to in
spire and unify his listeners, but
instead, by reinforcing unfair
generalizations about several
groups, he created a climate of
doubt. Although we cannot ac

cept responsibility for the
message he conveyed, we regret
Carter's insensitivity to his audi
ence.
In planning the conference,
our intent was to address institu
tional racism. We chose an enor
mous task and exerted much en
ergy in selecting the cultures on
which to focus. Because the time
to plan and conduct the four-day
event was so limited, we sought
to define our topic more closely.
Although we decided to concen
trate on the institutional racism
encountered by four particular
ethnic groups, we did not dis
count the existence of other
forms of prejudice and stereotyp
ing directed toward other groups.
Ironically, we found an example
of this prejudice within our own
guest's comments.
Carter's message was unex
pected and unacceptable.
However, we must respond to it
by creating and maintaining an
environment of communication.
We must work to prevent the oc
currence of similar events di
rected toward any group on the
Stanford campus.
We plan to continue the
dialogue begun by the conference

in the form of programs and open
discussion during winter quarter.

enjoyed themselves.
