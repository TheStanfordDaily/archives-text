# Being Jewish difficult in America
## 
### 
Being Jewish in America today is
sometimes difficult. While it is possible to
ignore our Jewishness most of the time, every
once in a while something happens that
forces us to confront it.
We realize we are not a part of the
majority. Either they won't accept us, or we
realize we just don't belong. On the other
hand, we are not really recognized as a
minority; we are too rich or too white or too
establishment. In short, we have "made it."
Sometimes, this neglect can lead to very
distressing incidents, when people make
thoughtless or ignorant remarks.

This happened at the "You Can Make a
Difference" conference recently held here at
Stanford. One would expect a conference
devoted to "fighting institutional racism" to
take special pains to avoid offending anyone.
Unfortunately, that did not happen.
As part of the conference, the Rev.
Lawrence Carter gave a sermon which most
Jews found profoundly disturbing at best, and
anti-Semitic at worst. The conference organi
zers were very upset by the speech. To their
credit, they accepted responsibility for invit
ing Carter, even though they had no way of
knowing what he would say.
I am amazed, however, at the response of
many other non-Jews. While every Jew I
showed his speech to was at least disturbed
by it, many non-Jews had little understanding
of why I was so upset, even after reading the
most offensive portions of Carter's remarks.
Since many non-Jews fail to see why we
are upset, I feel a need to discuss it here.
Carter based his sermon on the Book of
Jonah, written 400 years before Jesus. In it,
God called on Jonah, a Jew, to travel to
Nineveh, an Assyrian city, to tell the people
to repent from their evil ways, because other
wise God planned to destroy the city.

Instead, Jonah tried to run away. God
caught him and forced him to go to Nineveh
and preach to the people to repent. He did,
and they did, and God decided not to destroy
Nineveh.
When he saw that God would spare
Nineveh, Jonah was upset to see that his
prophecies would not come to pass, so he
went and sat outside the city. God saw this
and grew a castor oil plant to shade Jonah.
The next day, God made the tree wither.
Jonah was very angry that God had taken
away his shade. The story ends with God tell
ing Jonah, "You are upset about a castor oil
plant that cost you no labor . . . which
sprouted in a night and perished in a night.
Am I not to feel sorry for Nineveh, the great
city, in which there are more than 120,(KM)
people?" The message of Jonah is that we
must care for all of our fellow men, just as
God cares about all of his creations.
Carter interpreted this story to mean that
all Jews didn't care about non-Jews. He says,
" They felt that all non-Jews could take a free
jet ride to hell. . . . So, the Jews, in their
defensiveness, arrogance and feeling of supe
riority, scorned non-Jews and in essence
said, 'Let them spin slowly in the wind." "
One might as well take a speech by Louis
Farrakhan and say that all blacks feel that
way. I found the closing words of Carter's
speech even more disturbing. He ended by
describing Jesus as "our Jonah." To me, this
is just another repetition of traditional pre
modern Christian anti-Semitism.
"The Jews rejected (and/or killed) Jesus,
so they are evil people who deserve to be
punished." By saying that the Jews rejected
Jonah's message, Carter brands Jews as sel
fish at best. When he equates Jonah with
Jesus, he is bringing his case against the Jews
up to the present day, and is in effect saying
that today's Jews scorn non-Jews and don't
care if they "spin slowly in the wind."
It is especially insulting to hear these
words come from a black Southerner in view
of the large numbers of Jews who actively
fought for civil rights in the South in the
19605.
And given the exclusively Christian con
text of his remarks, it is especially appalling
that Stanford's Christian clergy has remained
silent. They, at least, should see the defama

tions in the speech and speak out against it.
It this were an isolated incident, I could
shrug it off. However, it brought back into
focus many memories from my past. I grew
up in Fullerton, a lily- white suburb near Los
Angeles. At most there were a dozen Jews in
my high school's I9(X) students. For the most
part, we were ignored. While more visible
minorities might consider this to be helpful at
times, it led to several unfortunate incidents.
At my high school baccalaureate, billed as
a non-denominational occasion, many of the
student participants didn't realize that there
were denominations that weren't Christian.
Afterwards, a teacher who had helped organ
ize the service told me that if prayers to Jesus
bothered me, 1 shouldn't have come.
Fvery year, we had to bring a note from
our parents explaining why we missed school
for the High Holy days. In elementary
school, every December we had a 'cultural'
C hristmas assembly and sang 'nonreligious'
Christmas songs and did 'nonreligious'
Christmas skits, it is no small thing for a
fourth-grader to be faced with an entire class
reveling in a culture he does not share. If we
were lucky, there might be a few Hanukkah
songs thrown in.
Finally, 1 recall going to a Kiwanis Club
breakfast as part of my high school Key Club.
Although it is hard to put it into words, I ex
perienced a profound feeling that I didn't
belong there, that it was part of a different
culture entirely.
Later, I tried to explain to the Key Club
president why I didn't want to attend another
of these breakfasts. Not only did he fail to un
derstand my alienation, but he was also
unable to understand how anyone could be
alienated by such an experience.
I guess that occasional experiences like
these are inevitable in homogenous Orange
County. But 1 expect more at Stanford Uni
versity. I have heard that, largely as a result
of C arter's speech, there will be a conference
on anti-Semitism held at Stanford later this
year. F his is an excellent idea â€” a good way
to make the best of a bad situation.
