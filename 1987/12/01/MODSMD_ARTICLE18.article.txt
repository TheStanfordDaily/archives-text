## Proposal weakens education 
### 
In an admirable spirit of tolerance and good in
tentions a subcommittee has formulated, and the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies will proba
bly soon forward to the Faculty Senate, a proposal
to alter the Area One (Western Culture) require
ment to meet persistent criticism that it has a
European, male bias.

Although judged imperfect by many, the pro
posal seems sufficiently broad to have struck a
common denominator. It may well pass senate
scrutiny. And yet, it seems that by making these
changes we shall seriously damage the general edu
cation environment at Stanford, an environment al
ways precariously balanced with the demands of
professional training.
Commendable as the proposal may be as an at
tempt to resolve a long and often heated debate, I
fear it stems from a misconception of what
"Western" culture is and why it should be taught
and learned and a misrepresentation of what, in
20th-century North America, the role is of "non-
Western" culture. I trust the reader will recognize
these two terms for what they are intended to be:
shorthand.
It is a fact, though unpleasant to many of good
will, that the culture of Europe and, by extension
that of the United States, grew from roots in the
Near East and Europe that go back to at least the
first millenium 8.C., and that for most of its 3000-
year history it was influenced little and only
episodically by other cultures and by women. Like
many, I tind this both an astonishing and an un
pleasant fact, but a historical fact it is.
It is only in the present century, and much more
so in America than in Europe, that this ancient

body of art, philosophy, science and social behav
ior that we call Western culture is being
progressively challenged and increasingly modified
and altered by non-Western cultures and by
women.
It is our purpose to assist Stanford students in
understanding their cultural heritage, a task espe
cially important at a time when this heritage is
being changed and enriched in major ways. To
achieve this purpose, it is above all essential that
the heritage itself be fully understood and the use of
its concepts mastered. Only so is it possible to un
derstand where one comes from, and only by un
derstanding this is one able to discern where one is
going.
One must be able to use Western culture, not just
know of it, not only to understand non-Western
cultures but above all to grasp their growing influ
ence on American culture.
To shorten the time spent on Western Culture, to
abandon or greatly alter the common reading core,
to substitute short overviews (all that can be ac
commodated in little time) of selected other
cultures â€” all this yields to the pervasive current
habit of substituting a buffet of light facts for
penetrating study. Knowing a little of much is per
missible as a prelude to further work, but not if this
is all the student will ever be taught. And that, un
fortunately, is likely to be true for a great many of
them.
One suspects that in this very political issue, po
litical considerations may underlie the proposal,
consciously or unconsciously. No one, not even a
committee, views with pleasure the possibility of
being called racist or sexist, as 1 surely shall be.
I o water down our educational program to avoid
such epithets or, more importantly, to sidestep
serious clashes of opinion shifts the cost of our
protection against them onto those whom we are
expected to teach.
