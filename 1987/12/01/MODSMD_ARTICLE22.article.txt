## Intrepid Bug solves the riddle of roommates 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
Hope you all had a wonderful
I hanksgiving holiday with your
friends or family. It's amazing
how so many different cultures
throughout the world give thanks
by dining on the carcass of a
large dead bird.

-1 spent Thanksgiving with my
grandparents in Napa. 1 was
talking with Grandpa Joe on
Thursday night, when all of a
sudden Grandma Lois came over
and started running her fingers
through his hair.
Then she went and got a pair of
scissors, came back, and, with
out a word, gave him a haircut.
He didn't stop talking. I don't
think he even noticed. Someday I
hope to be married for so long
that I don't notice when my wife
performs personal grooming on
me.
You think that's weird? They

also lie in bed at night and
practice being dead. That's right,
they lie stiffly with their eyes and
mouths open, and practice being
corpses. I swear this is all true.
Send those questions,
roommate gripes, and small, un
marked bills to Bug Me, Stanford
Daily, Storke Student Publica
tions Building, Stanford, Calif.,

(not B.Bug-Me) at the Tragedies
on L.OTS. Aren't you sick of this
sentence? It's been in every
column this year.
Dear Bug,
How are freshman roommates
assigned? Is it true that they
throw darts at a darthoard? Is it
true that they are assigned hy
height? Is it true that they put
guys named John near the bath
room ?
- / Hate My Perm
Thinking back to my freshman
roommate, 1 can't help but re
member that old saying,
"opposites attract." This was
particularly true in my case, be
cause not only was my roommate
very much opposite, but he also
attracted. Attracted what? At
tracted fleas, that's what. Eight
hundred freshman guys, and I
had to be paired with Jabba the
Butt.
This year's frosh were paired
by recent graduate Phil Cline and
junior Anne Hickling. During the
summer, Cline and Hickling were
responsible for sending out all
those nifty Freshman Informa

tion Project mailings, such as the
Roommate Preference Form, the
Summer Reading List and the
You've - Been - Assigned - to -
Modern - and - Spacious - Lucie
Stern - Hall - and - Welcome - to -
Hell letter.
Best of all, Cline and Hickling
got to match roommates, thus
guaranteeing pairs of neophyte
Freshmen a year of either com
plete misery or total incom
patibility.
All frosh are assigned to dorms
by a monstrous computer pro
gram on the basis of Western
Culture choice and their
preferences for all-freshmen or
four-class and coed or single-sex
floors. Yup, that's right, Conflict
and Change may be the penalty
for getting to live in Toyon. Once
students are assigned to dorms,
the fun really begins. Cline and
Hickling sit down in a small
room, and, using the Roommate
Preference Forms supplied by
freshmen, precede to destroy
15(H) lives.
"We take our job very
seriously," says Hickling.
Yeah, so did Charles Manson.
Many factors go into the actual
roommate pairings. Students
from the same state are separated
(from each other, not dismem
bered), and students with similar
academic interests or the same
Western Culture are also not put
together. Then they try to match
roommates who have similar mu
sical tastes, or perhaps a mutual
hobby or an extra-curricular in
terest in common.

The result, of course, is two
roommates who hate the living
guts out of each other, but can
listen to the same music. Many
times my roommate and I would
throw some Madonna onto the
stereo and scream insults at each
other to the soothing sound of
"Love Makes the World Go
Round."
The merry matchmakers also
assign pairs of roommates to spe
cific rooms, trying to put shy
roommates in heavily traveled
parts of the dorm, and putting
loud roommates as far away from
the resident fellow as possible.
According to Hickling, fresh
men often request specific dorms
that they would like to live in.
Those requests are unilaterally
denied. Requests for roommates
of the same religion are also
turned down. Ethnic roommates
may choose to have a roommate
of the same ethnicity. Res Ed
wants freshman roommates to
learn from one another, but, adds
Hickling, "A lot of the best
matches are pure luck."
They get some strange re
quests too: "One girl called to
ask if her dorm had a stable for
her horse," says Hickling. An
other guy requested assignment
to Flo Mo, because he claimed he
wanted to take part in the Flo Mo
Olympics.
"One guy wrote on his prefer
ence form, 'Please don't put me
with a dork,' " she said.
Dear Bug,
Is it true that Wilbur Food Ser

vice causes uncontrollable fits of
hunger? If not, why is there a
mass migration from Wilbur over
to Branner every night at dinner?
-Julia Child
Obviously the only way to get
the answer to this question was
to take a scientific poll, so last
Tuesday 1 scooted into the Bran
ner dining hall, stood on a chair
in the middle of the room, and
screamed out the following ques
tion:
"How many people here are
from Wilbur; please raise your
hands."
1 know, witnessing pure scien
tific method at work makes you
weak with respect. Out of ap
proximately 100 diners in the
dining hall, four raised their
hands signifying they were from
Wilbur.
1 rushed over to a table of Wil
burites (Wilburoids? Wilburians?
Wilburents?). According to a
spokesman (the only guy without
food hanging out of his mouth),
they eat at Branner because the

food at Wilbur sucks. That's a
sensitive analysis.
According to Branner RA Julie
Lythcott, Wednesday is the big
day for Branner dining migration.
On Wednesdays, the swim team
and other athletic groupies (many
of whom are Wilburites) meet at
Branner for their weekly chow
down.
Ordinarily, the cooks make
enough food for 180 to 220
people, but the influx of hungry
swimmers caused them to run
out of food on Wednesdays. Now
they have wised up, and they
make extra food that night.
However, on Wednesdays the
lines to get into the Branner
dining hall when it opens at 5:15
p.m. can include as many as 60
people, because the residents of
Branner are worried about not
having enough left to eat.
"1 remember one night when
Wilbur served liver â€” there was
a mass exodus to Branner,"
Branner resident Rebecca King
said. "Ill never forget that
night."
