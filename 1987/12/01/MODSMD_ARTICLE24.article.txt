## Doctors apply computers to diagnosis and treatment Artificial intelligence adapts to medicine 
### Michael Yang 
A computer can't, by itself,
cure a sick person, but it can help
a doctor treat the person's
disease.
Using artificial intelligence
(Al) techniques, Stanford scien
tists have created computer pro
grams that can act as medical ex
perts or consultants. Such
"medical expert systems" can
perform tasks ranging from
diagnosing diseases to helping
doctors in surgery.
One Stanford program can tell
a doctor how to treat a cancer pa
tient. The program, called On
cocin, monitors a patient's condi
tion by asking the physician
questions about the patient, the
treatment the patient has
received and the results of any
tests performed on the patient.
Based on this information, the
program aids in the administering
of chemotherapy, often a com
plex and difficult task.
Oncocin is one of the largest
medical Al projects at Stanford.
It was developed by Charlotte
Jacobs, a professor in the Oncol
ogy Department at the Medical
School. Oncocin has a large
database of knowledge that is
„ updated constantly with the most
current research results, accord
ing to an article in Stanford
\ Medicine magazine.
Stanford plays a large role in
'the development of expert sys
tems worldwide. Another impor
tant medical expert system,
developed at Stanford in the mid
► 19705, recommends therapies for
'patients with bacterial infections.
J As part of his doctoral disser
tation, Edward Shortliffe, an as
sociate professor of medicine at
the Medical School, worked with
computer scientist
<Bruce Buchanan to design the
which they named
'^Mycin.
And the program has been

quite successful so far.
"Eminent infectious disease
experts agreed with Mycin's
judgement more often than they
agreed with each other's," said
Stanford computer scientist Ed
ward Feigenbaum, who helped
develop one of the first expert
systems in the 19605.
"For blood infections and
meningitis infections, Mycin is a
world-class expert," Feigen
baum said.
Mycin interacts with its user to
acquire the data if needs. It
evaluates this clinical informa
tion while considering the many
diagnostic and therapy rules it
knows concerning infectious
diseases, trying to narrow down
the diagnostic possibilities and
prescribe an effective antibiotic
treatment.
Mycin asks the user only what
is necessary. Once it has come
up with a minimal set of possibili
ties, Mycin uses its therapy rules
to prescribe a treatment that will
cover all potential diseases.
An example of such a therapy
rule is, "If the site of the disease
culture is blood, and the organ
ism is rod-shaped, then there is
evidence that the organism is
Pseudomonas-Aeruginosa.''
Mycin also explains the basis
for its decisions. That gives the
physician reason to accept or
reject its recommendations. For
instance, the physician may ask
Mycin, "Why did you ask me
that?" "How did you arrive at
that conclusion?" or "Why did
you not consider this?" Mycin
answers these questions to create
confidence in the user, Feigen
baum said.
"Computer systems do not
now — nor will they soon —
have a sufficiently complete un
derstanding of medicine's techni
cal, clinical and social considera
tions to approach the richness
and flexibility of human ex
pertise," Shortliffe said in a

recent Scientific American arti
cle about advanced computing
for medicine.
Ultimately, expert systems re
quire "the common sense and
judgement of an experienced
health-care worker," Shortliffe
said. There are still many aspects
of human problem-solving that
cannot be modeled in a computer
program.
Mycin's collection of rules —
its knowledge base — can be
separated from its logical compo
nent. With a different knowledge
base, the logical part of Mycin
called Emycin, can be applied to
an area of expertise other than in
fectious diseases.
Scientists combined a data
base of knowledge about lung
diseases with the Mycin program
to produce an expert system
called Puff. Puff interprets physi
ological tests of lung patients at
Pacific Medical Center in San
Francisco, according to an article

in Stanford Medicine magazine.
Some mechanical devices now
under development may soon be
incorporated with future Stan
ford medical expert systems.
One of these devices, called
Data Glove, consists of a special
glove worn on the human hand
with sensors to detect hand and
finger movements in three
dimensional space. The glove,
combining the precision, control
and agility of the hand, can be
used to simulate situations, such
as in surgery, where coordinated
hand movements play a key role.
The revolutionary aspect of
Data Glove, made by VPL Re
search, Inc., is that it is not lim
ited to two dimensions. Existing
devices, such as the mouse used
with the Apple Macintosh com
puter. are limited in this respect,
according to a recent Scientific
American article.
Another device, a helmet with
a visual display, will allow

astronauts inside a space station
to control the "sight" of a robot
outside the station and see what
it "sees." The astronaut wears
the helmet and when he turns his
head, the robot's camera eyes
swing in the same direction, ac
cording to the Scientific Ameri
can article.
The helmet was created at the
Ames Research Center of NASA
at Moffett Field, near San Jose.
The space-station helmet and
glove would allow scientists to
research subjects ranging from
surgical technique to chemistry
in new ways. Using these
devices, the scientist only need
gesture with his hand to select an
option of the program, turn his
head to view an object from a dif
ferent angle, or reach out to ma
nipulate objects.
Scientists can use the helmet in
conjunction with the glove to vis
ually model systems they are
researching. Chemists can study
the binding of molecules or doc
tors can study surgical tech
niques in three dimensions in
stead of by typed commands on a
keyboard or manipulations of a
two-dimensional device like the
mouse, the Scientific American
article said.
Such tools, used in conjunc
tion with an expert system,
would allow a student to perform
surgery on an electronic cadaver
instead of on a real patient. The
expert system would provide in
formation on particular organs as
the student required it, according
to Joseph Rosen, a professor in
the Surgery Department at Stan
ford Medical School.
"Even more advanced would
be an expert system which
monitors the students' actions,
acting as a professor and provid
ing advice, assistance, or even
indicating mistakes," Rosen
said.
Expert systems will be used in
more and more areas of knowl

edge gathering and processing.
People using such systems must
be able to easily interact with the
computer. The easiest way to in
teract is in the way one interacts
with the natural world.
Expert systems are easier to
use if there is "a greater degree
of interaction between man and
machine," according to Scien
tific American. A more natural
environment, such as the one
provided by the helmet-and
glove combination, will increase
the usefulness of sophisticated
computers.
Much of the research to
develop expert systems at Stan
ford takes place at the Knowl
edge Systems Laboratory (KSL).
KSL is a unique entity, collabo
rating with many different disci
plines. Among the various
groups involved in KSL's proj
ects are the Chemistry, Bio
physics and Civil Engineering de
partments, a group at Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, bio
statisticians at the Medical
School and outside companies.
KSL researchers say they be
lieve that working with hard,
real-world problems is the best
way to observe the limitations of
current technology and emerge
with new and innovative ways to
do things.
"Working with hard problems
produces solutions to hard prob
lems," said KSL Research Asso
ciate Craig Cornelius.
Expert systems, once
developed, can be incredibly use
ful tools, researchers say.
However, the process of devel
oping them can be very difficult.
Building an expert system's
knowledge base — a process
known as "knowledge engineer
ing" — requires an enormous
amount of effort, depending on
the size of the knowledge base.
Cornelius acts as a "knowledge
engineer" in the construction of
expert systems.


The Data Glove illustrated here could he used by surgeons-in-training to
operate on an electronic cadaver instead of on a real patient.
