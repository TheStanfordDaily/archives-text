## Cagers take on Broncos at Maples 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
For those of you planning to
attend the Stanford men's bas
ketball continental and home
opener tonight, please be
forewarned: You might not
recognize this Cardinal club.
Not because the squad is
sporting a 2-1 record after an
impressive performance in the
Maui Classic over the week
end, but rather because the
team may be sporting interest
ing uniforms.
Ah yes, on the journey
home from the tropics the
Stanford team luggage was
delayed, including both sets of
uniforms and a whole bunch of
basketballs.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal
is set to host the Santa Clara
Broncos tonight at 7:35 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion. The Broncos
lost their season opener to
UC-Santa Barbara by a score
of 67-64.
Along with a dose of jet lag,
the Cardinal will bring a good

amount of momentum into
tonight's contest. After losing
a heartbreaker to the lowa
Hawkeyes Friday 78-75 in the
opening round of the Maui
Classic, Stanford rebounded
to defeat Chaminade and
Baylor to win the consolation
title.
"I have a good feeling that
we are going to be a very good
basketball team this year,"
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said.
Last season the Santa Clara
basketball team was good
enough to qualify for the
NCAA tournament, some
thing the Stanford hasn't done
since since 1942. The Broncos
finished last season with an 18-
14 record, losing to who else
but lowa in the first round of
the NCAA tourney, 99-76.
