# Marinovich the next Stanford QB hope?
## 
### 
The Miami Herald calls him
"The Next Big Thing," and
Todd Marinovich is probably the
most sought-after prep quarter
back in the country.

Marinovich is a husky 6-foot-5,
215-pounder from Capistrano
Valley High School, and, accord
ing to the Herald, Stanford is
right behind front-running UCLA
in the race for his services.
Marinovich, who recently
broke the national high school
record for career passing yards,
would like to play his college
football in California, but also
plans to visit Miami (Fla.), BYU,
Arizona State and Washington.
The competition for Marino
vich's signature on Feb. 10, the
national letter-of-intent signing
date, is intense. Only top football
schools with a tradition of good
quarterbacking need apply.
While UCLA and Stanford ap

pear to lead the pack, Miami is a
dark horse and will almost cer
tainly land Marinovich if he
leaves California. USC is also a
candidate and is the alma mater
of both Todd's father, Marv, a
former Oakland Raider, and his
uncle, Craig Fertig, a former
head coach at Oregon State who
is now an assistant athletic direc
tor for the Trojans.
What that all means is that it
will be tough sledding for Stan
ford to land Marinovich, but the
Cardinal is not without its attrac
tions. The Stanford football an
nals boast a bevy of legendary
quarterbacks, and the Farm's ac
ademic assets will likely appeal
to Marinovich.
"He's still in the decision
making process," said Capis
trano Valley Coach Eric Patton,
who refused to speculate on
which way Marinovich is
leaning. "He wants to go to a
place that throws the football. He
is a good student, and he wants
to maintain that level of achieve
ment."
Time is another factor on Stan
ford's side. Miami just entered
the recruiting derby this fall, but
