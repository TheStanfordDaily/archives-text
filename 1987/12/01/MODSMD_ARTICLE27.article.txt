# Hoops challenges Bulldogs
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
The rambling Stanford women's basketball team
just refuses to settle down. Only two days after re
turning from a weekend in Utah that netted wins
against both Utah and BYU, a youthful but suc
cessful Cardinal heads to central California tonight
to face Fresno State.
Stanford has been ranked in the top 20 by several
polls, and the game in the Bulldog den probably
won't disappoint the pollsters. The contest,
however, won't be a rout by any stretch of the im
agination. Fresno State has the ingredients for a
tough teams, the Bulldogs and thumped the Cardi
nal 81-64 last year at Maples Pavilion.
"First of all, they're very big," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "They're probably one of
the biggest teams we'll face, like Oregon last year
(which had one of the tallest front lines in the
NCAA).
"They have a 6-foot-6 center who's a sophomore
and is playing pretty well, a 6-5 forward whom we
held to 25 points last year, and then they have a 5-
11 forward who's probably their best athlete, an ex
cellent rebounder and an excellent scorer in low.
Then they have a guard who was a redshirt that we
didn't play against last year who runs their offense
very well and an off-guard who's quite good.
"They play a 2-3 zone, which we haven't played
against, so I don't know how we'll do against it,"
VanDerveer added. "Basically, they're a big team
and thev execute offensively very well."
Stanford, however, also has a power-packed
lineup that can execute well, including Pacific 10

Conference Player of the Week. Jill Yanke. Yanke,
a 6-5 junior center from Boise, Idaho, recorded l
points and eight rebounds against the Utes and a
game-high 17 points and 12 rebounds against the
Cougars.
"Jill had as good a weekend as she's ever had. as
good a two back-to-back games she's ever had.
VanDerveer said. "I'm pleased for her, and I hope
it's a good start for her. She has some high goals set
for herself this season, and I don't think she's even
playing as well as she could play."
The rest of the Stanford squad is also playing
well. In the weekend's two games the Cardinal
scored a total of 171 points, grabbed 95 rebounds
and had 28 assists.
"We're looking to play a little more full-court
defense, which should give Fresno State some
trouble," VanDerveer said. "That helped us
against both Utah and BYIJ. I think we have a
quicker and better backcourt. Our front line will be
challenged by their size, but I think it will be a good
matchup for (front-court players) Jill (Yanke),
(freshman) Trisha (Stevens), (freshman) Celeste
(Lavoie), (freshman) Ann (Adkins) and (freshman)
Tammy (Svoboda)."
VanDerveer played everyone on the roster this
weekend, which, along with giving the young Car
dinal team experience, has allowed players like
Lavoie to surprise the opposition. Lavoie scored
the game-winning point Saturday against BYU with
a last-minute free throw.
Sophomore guard Stacy Parson could be Stan
ford's next rising star. "She's been playing really
well, and in the up-tempo could be the one who
really gets us going." VanDerveer said.
