# Card nine tours Taiwan
## 
### Robert Portnoy Editorial staff 
On the basis of its victory in this year's College
World Series, Stanford will represent the United
States at the Taipei International Baseball Tourna
ment in Taiwan Dec. 1-14. The Cardinal leaves
today and will play at least nine games during its
two-week stay. The team will play 10 games if it
reaches the tournament final.
The Cardinal begins the tournament in Kaoh
siung, where Holland, Puerto Rico, Japan and one
of three Taiwanese teams join Stanford in a five
team bracket. In Taipei, a second bracket of six
teams includes Korea, Australia, Canada, Guam
and the remaining two teams from Taiwan.
Round-robin play will select three teams from
each bracket to compete in the championship
round in Taipei. The remaining teams will compete
in a consolation round in Kaohsiung.
The Cardinal will face some stiff competition in
the annual event. Taiwan's national team, which
will in all likelihood not open in Stanford's bracket,
won the Asian Championship last summer to
qualify for the 1988 Olympic Games.
Puerto Rico and Holland are also sending their
national team to the tournament. Puerto Rico
finished third in this year's Pan American Games,
and Holland qualified for the Olympic games by de
feating Italy in the 1987 European Championships.
It is not known whether Japan is sending its na
tional team.
"Our players will be surprised at the caliber of
play. The other players will be 4-5 years older and
stronger," Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.

"The competition will be outstanding, especially
the Japanese.
"The Taiwanese are very disciplined. The Latin
teams are much looser. It'll be interesting to see the
different styles of play and how talented they are.''
Stanford will not be at full strength entering the
tournament. Sophomore outfielder Paul Carey, just
named to the Collegiate Baseball 1988 preseason
All-America team, will accompany the Cardinal to
Taiwan, but several players, including pitchers Lee
Plemel, Jim Price and catcher Eric Cox, were
unable to make the trip because of their academic
schedules.
The team returns from Taiwan on the first day of
final exams. Stanford is also coming off a two-week
break from practice to allow players a chance to
catch up in their studies.
"The number one criteria for the players was to
work it out academically. Coming back the first day
of finals is tough," Marquess said. "The main rea
son we're going is because it's such a tremendous
educational experience for the kids. We'll do as
much touring and sightseeing as we can without in
terfering with our preparation for the games."
According to Marquess, the tournament's loca
tion was another factor in deciding to make the trip.
"If it were in Dallas or Canada, we wouldn't be
going," he said "It's an opportunity to see a part of
the world we'll probably not get a chance to see
again in our lifetime. And we are the defending na
tional champions representing the United States.
Ideally, it's not the best time academically."
The two-week layoff will set Stanford back a bit,
but Marquess looks for the team to improve as the
tournament progresses.
