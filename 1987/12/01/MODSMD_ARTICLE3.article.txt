The establishment of a pilot program for a
Stanford campus in Latin America will be
delayed at least six months because of the
postponement of an Overseas Studies fact
finding trip scheduled for early this month.
Overseas Studies officials intended to
make a final site selection for the pilot pro
gram after the trip, which has now been
delayed until late spring. The program was
slated to begin next summer, but now the ear
liest it could begin is late 1988 or early 1989,
according to Overseas Studies Director Tom
Heller.
Heller stressed that postponement of the
trip means a delay in but not cancellation of
the pilot program.
"The trip has been canceled for now, but
our priorities haven't shifted. We still plan to
open the Latin American campus. It will just
be delayed a few months," Heller said.
Heller said he does not think the delay will
be detrimental to planning of the Latin Amer
ican program.
"We are committed to opening a campus in
a Third World, Latin American country," he
said. "It is of academic importance to give
students an opprotunity to experience the
reality of the Third World."

The trip to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and
Santiago, Chile — the two locations being
considered for a campus — was postponed
because of a University planning and
budgetary review that requires Heller's pres
ence on camnus. The review is nart of the
"regular budgetary process," Heller said,
and is not exclusive to the Overseas Studies
Office.
According to Overseas Studies Asst. Di
rector Nancy Padgett, "Each Humanities
and Sciences department has to come up with
a three-year plan, and as we have major proj
ects in the works, such as Kyoto, (Japan), an
Eastern European campus and a Latin Amer
ican campus, Tom Heller has to be on
campus to present our proposals."
"We knew the review would take place
during fall quarter, but we didn't know that
our presentations would take place in early
December, the same time as the planned
trip," Padgett said.
Heller said the budget reviews "are neces
sary for the planning of the next three years.
We want to create new campuses and enrich
the quality of the existing ones. IThe review |
will help determine how we want to develop
as an institution."
The budgetary reviews were scheduled in
dependently of the recent stock market
crash. However, the economic planning of

the next tew years is essential to the Over
seas Studies program. "Any American or
ganization outside of America is experiencing
hard economic times. With the dollar declin
ing, everything is twice as expensive, espe
cially in places like Western Europe and
Japan," Heller said.
However, Heller said he sees no problem
with funding. "With the combination of Uni
versity funds and outside fund raising, we'll
do tine. We have the funding schemes to sup
plement the University budget,"he said.
In Kyoto, for example, "The funds to build
the facility are coming from the Japanese
government and private individuals, while
the money for the operating budget is coming
from the University," Padgett said.
The Latin American campus will not ex
perience the same economic problems, as
Latin America is better protected against the
decline of the dollar. There are other factors
involved that are unique to the establishment
of the Third World campus. Heller said.
"All the major countries, except for Chile,
are experiencing triple-digit inflation, which
leads to a black market and economic insta
bility. The economics are tricky," he said.
There are also major cultural differences to
consider.The establishment of a Latin Ameri
can campus "is not going to be as easy as es
tablishing a European campus," Heller said.
