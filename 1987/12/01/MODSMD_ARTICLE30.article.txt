Christmas came early on the
Farm this year.
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team received the
payoff for its 26-6 season yes
terday when the NCAA
Seeding Committee announ
ced the pairings for this year's
playoffs. The Cardinal earned
the No. I seed in the West
regional, and will host 17th
ranked Oregon Thursday night
at 7:30 p.m.
The third-ranked Cardinal
faces the Ducks in Maples
Pavilion in a first round match,
with the winner advancing to
the Western regional tourna
ment. Since the Cardinal is the
region's top seed, if Stanford
beats the Ducks the regional
tournament will be held at
Maples Pavilion Dec. 11 and
12.
This year's matchup must
seem vaguely familiar to the

Cardinal, which faced Oregon
in the first round last year as
well. Stanford won that match
handily in four games and
hopes things won't be any dif
ferent this time around. The
Cardinal came out on top both
times the teams met this year,
winning 15-8, 19-17, 15-11 at
Oregon and 15-10, 15-4, 15-12
at Maples.
In the region's three other
matches, No. 15 USC travels
to Fort Collins, Colo., to face
the sixth-ranked Lady Rams
of Colorado State, No. 5
UCLA hosts No. 19 California
and 18th-ranked Pepperdine
visits No. 4 BYU.
In next weekend's regional
tournament, the Stanford-
Oregon winner will face the
Colorado State-USC winner,
while the UCLA-California
victor will meet the survivor of
the BYU-Pepperdine contest.
The two winners there will
then play to go to the final
four.
