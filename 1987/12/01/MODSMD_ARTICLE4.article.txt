# University seeks space research center
## NASA to review Stanford bid 
### Jay Bhattacharya Staff writer 
NASA today will begin evalu
ating proposals from universities
across the country, including
Stanford, for the sites of its
planned eight university-based
space research centers, accord
ing to Bill Barry of the NASA
Ames Research Center in Moun
tain View.
Stanford's $8.5-million pro
posal focuses on the problems of
working in space and developing
technology to live there, said
Computer Science Prof. Nils
Nilsson. If awarded to Stanford,
the center would offer many stu
dent internships and graduate re
search assistant positions,
Nilsson said.
The proposed center would

develop autonomous robots to
work on space stations, assemble
equipment and prepare for possi
ble Mars landings, said Michael
Genesereth, assistant professor
of computer science.
Barry said NASA has received
115 proposals, including two
from UC-Berkeley. Nilsson said
he expects a number of other
"outstanding" proposals from
schools sucn as the MIT and
Carnegie-Mellon University in
Pittsburgh. Of those 115, NASA
will choose eight as new research
center sites.
NASA officials will announce
its final selections this spring,
Barry said.
According to Barry, NASA's
purpose in setting up the space
research centers is to "rebuild
the nation's infrastructure in

space engineering research. . . .
There has been a gradual
decrease in the number of people
involved in space engineering in
the past few years." The pro
gram would bring "qualified
young people into the industry,"
he said.
Among other criteria, each
school will be judged on its abil
ity to meet funding goals, Barry
said. "Evaluators are looking for
innovative funding solutions, in
cluding industry involvement in
the p roc ram," he said.
Another criterion is the pro
posal's relevancy to NASA's
current programs, Barry said.
Nilsson is optimistic about
Stanford's ability to measure up
to the criteria.
"We have a strong proposal
and a good chance," he said.
