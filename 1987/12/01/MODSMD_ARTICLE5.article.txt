# Divestment policy may be broadened
## Trustees to consider tougher standards 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
The Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR) issued
recommendations Wednesday in
tended to toughen University
standards for investment in cor
porations doing business in
South Africa.
In a report to the Special Com
mittee on Investment Responsi
bility (SCIR) — the arm of the
Board of Trustees that makes
University investment decisions
— the CIR advocated divestment
from corporations that sell goods
and services to "apartheid
enforcing agencies," such as
police and military organizations.
"Through the course of the
past year, the CIR came to recog
nize that in addition to consider
ing the Sullivan Ratings, another
important factor was whether a
company's goods and services
were serving to help apartheid,"
said Operations Research Prof.

Frederick Hillier, co-chair of the
CIR. "This is a carry-over from a
growing concern from last year."
The Sullivan Ratings are a set
of standards currently used by
the University to measure the
degree to which corporations are
"working actively to counter
apartheid and avoiding actions
that tend to reinforce apartheid."
Hillier said the CIR officially
made the recommendations last
week to allow the SCIR time to
act on them during the trustee
meeting next Monday and Tues
day.
The CIR is a 12-member com
mission consisting of three stu
dents, three faculty members,
three alumni and three Univer
sity staff members. It makes rec
ommendations on investment
policies to the SCIR, which is
made up solely of trustees. "A
majority of our recommendations
are approved," Hillier said.
