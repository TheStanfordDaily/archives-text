# Divestment policy may be broadened
## Trustees to consider tougher standards 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
The Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR) issued
recommendations Wednesday in
tended to toughen University
standards for investment in cor
porations doing business in
South Africa.
In a report to the Special Com
mittee on Investment Responsi
bility (SCIR) — the arm of the
Board of Trustees that makes
University investment decisions
— the CIR advocated divestment
from corporations that sell goods
and services to "apartheid
enforcing agencies," such as
police and military organizations.
"Through the course of the
past year, the CIR came to recog
nize that in addition to consider
ing the Sullivan Ratings, another
important factor was whether a
company's goods and services
were serving to help apartheid,"
said Operations Research Prof.

Frederick Hillier, co-chair of the
CIR. "This is a carry-over from a
growing concern from last year."
The Sullivan Ratings are a set
of standards currently used by
the University to measure the
degree to which corporations are
"working actively to counter
apartheid and avoiding actions
that tend to reinforce apartheid."
Hillier said the CIR officially
made the recommendations last
week to allow the SCIR time to
act on them during the trustee
meeting next Monday and Tues
day.
The CIR is a 12-member com
mission consisting of three stu
dents, three faculty members,
three alumni and three Univer
sity staff members. It makes rec
ommendations on investment
policies to the SCIR, which is
made up solely of trustees. "A
majority of our recommendations
are approved," Hillier said.
If the SCIR approves the re
commendations, the CIR will
present a list of corporations that
may be eligible for divestment at
the February trustees meeting,
according to Hillier.
A 90-day period would be
given to allow each company
time to respond, and recommen
dations for final action on divest
ment would be made before the
June trustees meeting.
Trustee James Ware, an SCIR
member, called the recommenda
tions "a logical extension of

present policies."
"I think Stanford has consis
tently taken a position as a share
holder in direct opposition to
agencies that support the military
and police organizations," Ware
said. "Given our past policies, I
would hope that the effects of ex
tending the policy to other
agencies, excepting humanitarian
ones, would be small."
Ware would not speculate
whether the SCIR would approve
the recommendations but noted
that "the purpose of having a
policy on investment respon
siblity is to take an action you
feel is right irrespective of how
much stock you have."
A list of corporations in the

Stanford portfolio that might be
affected by the recommendation
was compiled last November by
the Investor Responsibility Re
search Center, an independent
organization established by Stan
ford and other non-profit organi
zations in the early 19705.
According to Hillier, the list
estimated that six dozen compan
ies would be eligible for divest
ment if the SCIR agrees to the
new standards.
But Ware dismissed the esti
mate, saying that "November
1986 is old, given how fast stock
trades."
Hillier said a revision of the
1986 report is expected by Janu
ary.
