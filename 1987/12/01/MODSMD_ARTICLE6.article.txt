# Task force report finalized
## W. Culture plan set for approval 
### Haru Connolly Senior staff writer 
I he Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies (CUS) is expected
to approve the Western Culture
Task Force s final proposal to
morrow, according to CUS Chair
Craig Heller.
"We've spent our time gather
ing information from concerned
people," Heller said. "It's time
that CUS makes up its mind."
If the CUS approves the Area
One legislation, the Faculty Sen
ate will consider the proposal —
which seeks to address concerns
that Stanford's current Western
Culture program stresses a white
male historical perspective — at
its Jan. 21 meeting.
According to task force Chair
and History Prof. Paul Seaver,
the task force had hoped the sen
ate would consider the proposal
this month for a new program,
titled Cultures, Ideas and Values.
"The Senate knew we were
aiming for December, but there
was no way we could get it on the
agenda," Seaver said. "The
problem is the Senate agenda (for
the Dec. 3 meeting) was made up
weeks ago."
"At this point, it is difficult to
make any kind of prediction,"
said Vice Provost and English
Prof. Bill Chace. Chace said he
supports the legislation except
for its abolition of a core reading
list.

According to Heller, CUS can
generate a separate piece of legis
lation calling for a core list or re
quire that the tracks be
reevaluated in three years. Heller
refused to speculate on the
chances of the CUS considering
such legislation.
The senate usually accepts the
recommendations of its commit
tees, Seaver said.
Nevertheless, Seaver ex
pressed apprehension over the
debate in the senate. "I can't
imagine it will sail through the
senate without protest," he said.
"It is conceivable (the senate


Paul Seaver
could reject the proposal) be
cause many objections have been
heard, and those who throw a lot
of weight are determined to
defeat it." Opponents of the leg
islation could attempt to create
an impression that no one could
teach the new course, he added.
"If the senate shoots (the pro
posal) down, it would be terribly
disillusioning," Seaver said. "As
a university, we would be in trou

ble."
According to Seaver, if the
senate wants minor amendments
to the proposal it will send it back
to the CUS, but any major objec
tions would force a vote "up or
down."
Chace also foresees contro
versy in the senate deliberations.
"I see people speaking in favor
of retention of the core list," he
said, adding that "not a tiny
minority" opposes the proposal.
"Correctly or incorrectly, the
core list became synonymous
with male, white, Western domi
nation of the program, to the
point that it is symbolic now,"

Heller said. Removing the core
list from Western Culture
eliminates the symbolism and
makes the tracks more flexible,
he said.
According to Seaver, the core
list originally was not intended to
be "a canon. There was a lot of
competition among representa
tives of the four (Western Cul
ture) tracks then, and it was evi
dently so painful (to come up
with a core list) they left it with
out modification," he said.
"Since then, almost every
track has recognized the limita
tions of the core list," Seaver
said.
