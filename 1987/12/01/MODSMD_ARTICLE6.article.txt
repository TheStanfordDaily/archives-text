# Task force report finalized
## W. Culture plan set for approval

I he Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies (CUS) is expected
to approve the Western Culture
Task Force s final proposal to
morrow, according to CUS Chair
Craig Heller.
"We've spent our time gather
ing information from concerned
people," Heller said. "It's time
that CUS makes up its mind."
If the CUS approves the Area
One legislation, the Faculty Sen
ate will consider the proposal —
which seeks to address concerns
that Stanford's current Western
Culture program stresses a white
male historical perspective — at
its Jan. 21 meeting.
According to task force Chair
and History Prof. Paul Seaver,
the task force had hoped the sen
ate would consider the proposal
this month for a new program,
titled Cultures, Ideas and Values.
"The Senate knew we were
aiming for December, but there
was no way we could get it on the
agenda," Seaver said. "The
problem is the Senate agenda (for
the Dec. 3 meeting) was made up
weeks ago."
"At this point, it is difficult to
make any kind of prediction,"
said Vice Provost and English
Prof. Bill Chace. Chace said he
supports the legislation except
for its abolition of a core reading
list.

According to Heller, CUS can
generate a separate piece of legis
lation calling for a core list or re
quire that the tracks be
reevaluated in three years. Heller
refused to speculate on the
chances of the CUS considering
such legislation.
The senate usually accepts the
recommendations of its commit
tees, Seaver said.
Nevertheless, Seaver ex
pressed apprehension over the
debate in the senate. "I can't
imagine it will sail through the
senate without protest," he said.
"It is conceivable (the senate
