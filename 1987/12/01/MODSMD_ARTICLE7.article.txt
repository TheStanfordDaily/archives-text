### Laura Morrow 
The University's libraries hope to install a
fully automated circulation system by the early
19905, according to Joan Krasner. chief of Li
brary Access Services and a member of the Uni
versity Library Committee.
The new system will replace the handwritten
cards currently used in University libraries with
magnetic identification cards and will identify
books with bar codes similar to those used on
groceries, Krasner said.
She said the proposal for the automated cir
culation system is still in its preliminary stages
but hopefully will be approved by the provost's
office in February.
If approved, work on the new system will
probably begin in 1989 and would take three to
five years to install, she said. Eventually Stan
ford will automate all University libraries.
Hoover and the Law School library, she added.

Meyer and Green libraries will probably be the
first to be automated, according to Susan Perry,
head librarian at Meyer Library.
No projection has been made regarding the
cost of purchasing and installing the new system.
However, according to Krasner. the proposal
would "entail some major hardware and
software purchases." Also, as part of the pro
posal by the library committee installation of the
system will include the joint efforts of the Uni
versity libraries. Hoover and Law library staffs.
Perry said it is likely that once installed, the
system will be interfaced with Socrates, the Uni
versity's on-line card catalogue, enabling a per
son using Socrates to see if a book has been
checked out and when it is due back.
Krasner said the libraries will try to make a
card that can be used not only as a library card,
but also as a meal card and as general student
identification card.
