Prison siege continues in Atlanta
ATLANTA — Federal authorities said yesterday that a
"small but aggressive minority" of the Cuban inmates holding
90 hostages in the Atlanta penitentiary appeared to be obstruct
ing a settlement of the week-long prison takeover.
Officials said there were no face-to-face negotiations yester
day with the inmates who hold portions of the 85-year-old
federal prison, and there were only sporadic contacts on a tele
phone line leading into buildings occupied by the prisoners.
They said one additional Cuban detainee surrendered overnight,
leaving 1118 Cuban and 20 American prisoners still inside.
More than 24 hours after settlement of the prison takeover by
Cuban detainees in Oakdale, La., Cuban prisoners in Atlanta
have given no indication that the resolution of that uprising
would affect the Atlanta mutiny, federal officials said.
Although it appeared that a majority of the Atlanta prisoners
favored an agreement that would release the hostages, the De
partment of Justice said in a statement, a "small but aggressive
minority appears to be able to intimidate this majority into drag
ging out the incident and avoiding a settlement."
The statement added that federal authorities were "prepared
to be as patient as necessary" while the prisoners sought to
resolve differences among themselves .
Haitian electoral council dissolved
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Military government leader
Gen. Henri Namphy has moved to ensure himself a prolonged
hold on power by dissolving an independent electoral council
Sunday, having already canceled national elections after
widespread violence and killing by forces opposed to the elec
tion, Western diplomats and politicans said yesterday.
His actions set the stage tor a new, potentially violent con
frontation between armed forces leaders and politicians for
mally allied with the ousted Duvalier dictatorship on one side,
and defenders of the electoral council and Sunday's thwarted
vote on the other.
"It was a coup d' etat against the constitution. The (army) will
have an election, but they'll have it the way they want it," com
mented one European diplomat.
Namphy's ruling National Government Council abolished
election laws and halted the electoral process late Sunday after
army troops and marauding Ton-Tons Macoutes, former mem
bers of disbanded Duvalier paramilitary squads, disrupted the
vote by savagely killing at least 25 people and wounding more
than 60 in the capital.
Namphy said the Government Council would organize an
other round of balloting and inaugurate a president by Feb. 7.
Haiti has not had a free election in at least three decades.
Late Sunday night, bursts of gunfire, presumably from Ton-
Tons Macoutes, were heard again across the city but died down
in the dawn hours Monday. At least two bullet-riddled bodies of
unidentified Haitians were found in city streets yesterday morn
ing. But there was no sign of the terrorists during the day.
Polish government suffers setback
WARSAW, Poland — The government of Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski appeared to suffer a significant political setback yes
terday as two referendum propositions on official plans for polit
ical and economic reform failed to win sufficient voter support
for legal approval.
Official figures released last night showed that only 44 percent
of registered voters cast ballots during the national referendum
Sunday in favor of a government proposition for "radical
healing" of the economy, while 46 percent voted for the official
model of political liberalization.
Both propositions thus fell short of the legal standard of 50
percent of eligible voters necessary for the propositions to be re
garded as binding. Although those voting in favor of the proposi
tions outnumbered those voting against by more than two-to
one, the nearly 33 percent of voters who did not turn out for the
referendum made a decisive difference.
The reported abstention rate and negative vote of up to 27
percent were unprecedented under communist rule here or in
other Warsaw Pact countries. Authorities have never previously
acknowledged less than complete victory in an election or a
turnout rate below 75 percent.
Officials denied that the results, which sharply contradicted
pre-referendum opinion polls, represented a political defeat for
Jaruzelski or the broad reform plans he announced in October.
Spokesman Jerzy Urban pointed out that more than two-thirds
of those voting approved the government propositions, a result
he said would be regarded as an overwhelming victory by any
western government.
Reagan tempers hopes for summit
WASHINGTON — With only a week remaining before his
summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Presi
dent Reagan said yesterday the two nations are "pressing
ahead" with negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear arsenals,
but warned, "We must never be afraid to walk away from a bad
deal."
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater indi
cated that it appeared unlikely that the three-day summit would
produce a breakthrough in the effort to reduce Soviet and U.S.
strategic missile arsenals by half. There had been speculation
that the summit might be extended if the two leaders made prog
ress toward an agreement on long-range missiles.
"Looking at the point we are now in the (strategic arms) nego
tiations and the number of issues that have to be dealt with, it
seems unlikely we would have the kind of breakthroughs that
would demand additional time," Fitzwater told reporters.
Reagan's comments, which came during a speech to the con
servative Heritage Foundation, apparently were an effort to
quiet conservative fears that the president will go too far in
making arms control concessions to the Soviets.
"Our Geneva negotiators have made progress" toward an
agreement to reduce intercontinental missiles, Reagan said.
"But as I've said repeatedly, I've waited six years to get an
agreement that is botn reliable and verifiable," with no plan yet
resolved. "We must never be afraid to walk away from a bad
deal. On that point, there is no negotiation," he said.
Kennedy decries election coverage
A press fixated with the horse-race mechanics of politics,
with polling and with simplistic labels has helped cause some
thing to be "very wrong" with the way America elects presi
dents, Sen. Edward Kennedy said yesterday.
Presidential elections, the Massachusetts Democrat said, are
becoming an unreal spectacle of illusion and expectation, glib
one-liners, and fake momentum: "Frequently events matter less
than what was now widely referred to as spin control — who in
which campaign can explain why something doesn't mean what
it seems."
