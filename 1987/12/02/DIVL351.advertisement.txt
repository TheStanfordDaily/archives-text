Rotary Scholarship —
Rotary Foundation Scholarships are offered every year to
both undergraduates and graduate students interested in
spending a year abroad studying or conducting research.
The primary purpose of the scholarship is to promote
international understanding. Students interested in these
grants will be required to make application to a local
Rotary Club in the spring of 1987 for a trip abroad in the
autumn of 1988. For more information attend a meeting
at the International Center or visit the Overseas Resource
Center Library.
