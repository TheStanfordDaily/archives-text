### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons last week announced six
fall quarter recipients of the
Dean's Award for Service.
Chosen from a pool of 20
nominees, seniors Rosemarie
Day, Laurie Larson and Laurie
Langfitt, junior Charlie Ahern
and graduate students Alberto
Bolanos and Alex Triantis were
recognized for service to the Uni
versity community.
Initiated in 1983, the non
monetary award is given quar
terly to both undergraduates and
graduate students. "It's a low
key, modest and deliberately
simple thank you," Lyons said.
The recipients will receive a
medallion and certificate at a
Dec. 3 ceremony and dinner.
"It shows the emphasis being
placed on residential education,"
said Triantis, a graduate student
in industrial engineering and en
gineering management who, as
neighborhood coordinator for
Escondido Village, has helped or
ganize sports events, parties and
clothing drives for the past three
years.
"Over the last four years
there's been a lot of enthusiasm
to make the quality of life as a
graduate student a lot better,"
Triantis said.
Triantis explained that other
graduate residences such as
Crothers Memorial Hall have
resident assistants to coordinate
student activities, while Escon
dido does not. " There is now
more emphasis on Escondido Vil
lage as well," he said.
Day, a public policy major and
Toyon resident assistant,
received the award largely for
her contribution to the Public
Service Center. Last year Day
organized a spring charity car
nival to raise money for students
in Escondido Village, Palo Alto
and East Palo Alto.
"It was a fun day in itself with
food, entertainment and a bus
that circulated through East Palo
Alto. But we also raised $1500,"
Day said.
She added that the proceeds
helped fund the student-run East
Palo Alto Stanford Summer
Academy (EPASSA), a daytime
summer program on campus that
brings "promising middle school
students from East Palo Alto to
Stanford" and provides them
with access to computer
facilities.
"There are also games, field
trips and volunteer work for the
students," said Day, who ex
plained that the program is
mainly designed to lessen school

dropout rates through "exposure
to the University."
Ahem, who was nominated by
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano and Sally Cole of the Judi
cial Affairs Office, is a history
major who was cited for his work
with the Stanford Students Safe
Transporation Program. STOP
provides Stanford students with
rides home from parties if they
have had too much to drink and
are unable to drive.
Fellow medical student Kevin
Shrock cited Bolanos' involve
ment in student government and
counseling for minority pre-meds
as well as his "sparkle and
panache."
Larson was nominated by
Registrar Sally Mahoney and
Margaret Ann Fidler of Student
Affairs for her work in the
campus Lutheran community.
