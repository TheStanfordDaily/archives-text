### 
SEOUL, South Korea — A
man and a woman who took
poison yesterday while under
detention at the airport in Bah
rain on the Persian Gulf may
have been responsible for the
crash Sunday of a Korean Air
Lines jetliner with 115 people on
board, a South Korean govern
ment official said.
The official, Assistant Foreign
Minister Park Soo Gil, told
reporters, "1 strongly suspect
they are the criminals who could
have planted a bomb in the
plane."
The man involved, who ap
peared to be in his 60s, and the
woman, around 30, were travel
ing on false Japanese passports,

according to news agency
reports. They left the jetliner,
which was en route from Bagh
dad, Iraq, to Seoul, South Korea,
in the Persian Gulf state of Abu
Dhabi, its last stop before the
crash. They later flew to nearby
Bahrain.
There they were detained be
cause of suspicions raised by the
the woman's passport, and as
they were being questioned, they
bit into vials ot poison concealed
in cigarettes.
The man died shortly after
ward. The woman was reported
in critical condition at a hospital
but officials said that she is likely
to survive.
Park said that Japanese inves

tigators had found evidence that
appeared to link the woman with
a pro-North Korean organization
in Japan. He said that the two
may have left explosives on the
plane when they disembarked.
The plane, a Boeing 707, disap
peared Sunday in an area near
the Thai-Burmese border, but it
was not until yesterday that
search teams sighted its
wreckage. A Thai border
policeman was quoted by news
agencies as saying that the site
was about six miles into Burma
near the Salween River, which
forms part of the border between
the two countries.
Thai officials said that there
was little hope of finding any sur

vivors. All but two of the pas
sengers on the plane were
Korean, according to KAL.
Even before the two were
detained, Korean Air Lines offi
cials had suggested the possibil
ity that a bomb had caused the
crash because the plane went
down without any warning.
KAL President Cho Choong
Kun told the state-run television
network, "Without a sudden ex
plosion, which I very strongly
suspect is the work of terrorists
in connection with the 1988
Olympic Games, it could never
have happened." The 1988 sum
mer games are scheduled to be
held in Seoul.
