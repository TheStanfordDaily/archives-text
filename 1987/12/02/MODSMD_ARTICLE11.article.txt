# Trapping yields no trace of crop-threatening insects
## Officials conclude fruit fly threat over 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Harmful Oriental fruit flies
have been eradicated from the
campus and the surrounding
area, county agricultural officials
have determined after concluding
another futile trapping campaign.
The officials said, however, that
trapping will continue until mid-
April to ensure that no third
generation flies emerge.
In September, county officials
found several fruit flies on

campus and stepped up efforts to
exterminate the insects. How
ever, Santa Clara County agricul
tural workers have found no new
fruit flies after four periods of in
tensive trapping. The flies are
dangerous because they can
damage valuable fruit crops.
"Tne fruit flies are eradicated
hopefully now," said Denis Grif
fin, area manager of the Califor
nia Department of Food and
Agriculture. He added, however,
that the county will continue to
trap "at a level higher than nor
mal."

Griffin said the state routinely
traps for fruit flies year-round.
Whenever officials find evidence
of a fruit fly infestation, efforts
are made to eradicate them.
Trapping will continue until
mid-April in order to kill third
generation fruit flies. Griffin said.
"That's the last generation we
have to worry about," he said.
When the flies were first dis
covered three months ago, pes
ticides and chemical lures were
sprayed in trees and on telephone
poles. The pesticides killed male

fruit flies and thus prevented the
insects from reproducing.
"This particular fly is fairly
simple to eradicate since [it is]
very easily attracted to the lure,"
Griffin said.
The cardboard traps currently
used do not contain pesticides,
but instead contain a sticky sub
stance that holds the insects until
workers remove them.
Griffin said the fruit flies were
probably introduced into the area
through the mail, possibly from
Hawaii.
