### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Soviet officials have con
firmed dates and a general
itinerary for a delegation of
Stanford students planning a
two-week visit to the Soviet
Union later this year, accord
ing to a spokesperson for the
Stanford Soviet Exchange
Project.
Jenny Schmitz, a member of
the group, said a delegation of
12 Stanford undergraduates,
one graduate student and a
faculty adviser will leave Stan
ford for the Soviet Union on
March 19 and will return on
April 2.
The group will visit the Uni
versity of Novosibirsk in
Novosibirsk, Siberia, and will
also tour Moscow and
Leningrad.
After the Stanford group
returns from Novosibirsk, So
viet students from that univer
sity will spend one week visit
ing New York City and Wash
ington before continuing on to
Stanford for one week midway
through spring quarter.

During the exchange, the
Stanford group and the Soviet
group will discuss issues such
as trade, immigration and the
arms race, in addition to
sharing experiences of college
life in the two countries.
Group member Kathy
Healy said the Soviet students
will also interact with the
Stanford community at large.
"It's our goal to involve as
much of the campus as possi
ble" through programs in
various dorms, she said.
Expressing confidence that
the Stanford group would
meet its $43,000 fund-raising
goal, Schmitz said fund raising
from individuals and corpora
tions was progressing "stead
ily but slowly."
The student-organized ex
change is receiving assistance
from the Citizens Exchange
Council, a New York-based
non-profit organization that
facilitates citizen exchange be
tween the United States and
the Soviet Union. According
to Schmitz, the council will
underwrite the cost of the
Novosibirsk students' plane
tickets to the United States.
