## The
						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Keep food services open 
### 
Chances are that Stanford students who
remained on campus over the Thanksgiving
break are not overly concerned about burning
off calories. While they may have stuffed them
selves with a traditional Thanksgiving feast, stu
dents on campus were forced to scrounge for
meals the remainder of the holiday weekend.
University Food Service was reportedly not
providing meals at any of the dorms or houses
during the break. Tresidder Union was also
closed, aside from the Coffee House and the
Store, both of which operated at reduced hours.
The decision by Food Service and Saga Corp.
(which controls food service at Tresidder) to in
terrupt the serving of food over the course of the
break implicitly assumed that virtually all Stan
ford students would be traveling home for the
holiday. However, Stanford is a national univer
sity, and the great majority of its students are
from outside of California. Many simply cannot
afford the expense or the time to leave campus
over a four-day holiday weekend, especially
with the winter break only a matter of weeks
away.
Hundreds of students, both undergraduate

and graduate, did in fact remain on campus
during the Thanksgiving break, many without
cars. Obtaining meals off-campus, necessitated
by the lack of food service on campus, therefore
involved considerable inconvenience and ex
pense.
University Food Service and Saga have a
monopoly on food distribution on campus and
consequently extract exorbitant prices for their
fare. Students therefore have a right to expect
that well-balanced meals for breakfast, lunch
and dinner will be available on campus during
short holiday periods as well as during the regu
lar course of the academic year.
It is understood that full service during a break
would not be feasible because of reduced
demand. However, the ordinary weekend ser
vice as a result of lowered demand already in
volves reduced hours and locations in compari
son to weekday service. Such reduced service
would be appropriate for holiday breaks also,
since it represents a reasonable compromise be
tween full weekday service and complete ab
dication of providing food to students remaining
on campus during short holiday breaks.
