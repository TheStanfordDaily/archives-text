Other students
need recognition
As many of you are probably
aware, there are now condom
dispensers in the restrooms of
Encina Gym. The article that an
nounced the installation of the
dispensers (Daily, Nov. 19) ne
glected the contribution of other
students. I would like to take this
opportunity to acknowledge
those others who were in
strumental in the bringing of the
dispensers to Stanford.
The issue of installing condom
dispensers was first raised last
year by a group of students in a
Human Biology class taught by
Prof. Carl Djerassi. These stu
dents were Sami Gotlieb, Marie
Lacour, Kim Thomason, Shirley
Wang and Jennifer Yu. In winter
quarter, they brought a proposal
before various campus sectors
(including Red Ed, the libraries,
Tresidder, the President's office,
CAPER) with no success.
They also came before the
ASSU Senate to look for sup
port, and it was there where I
first picked up the issue. My
work now continues as I am pres
ently having discussions with the
University libraries, the dean of
Student Affairs and Tresidder.
I am optimistic that we will see
more dispensers on campus very
soon, and that they will be sup
plemented by educational materi
als on safe sex. However, before
things move any farther along, I
would like to stop and thank the
original group of students for first
raising the issue. The courage
they displayed last spring by
bringing up such a sensitive topic
is most appreciated.

Finding parking
is a hassle
Let's get serious now. The
issue of parking is no longer
something that can be put off.
Living ofi-campus thanks to the
Draw, I have no alternative but
to drive here every morning, es
pecially on rainy days. However,
unless I arrive by 9 a.m., the only
legal "C" parking I can find is in
the new lot by the Medical Cen
ter.
I don't favor the idea of turning
Stanford into a giant parking lot,
but it's clear that we definitely do
need more parking. Students
who commute often miss their
first classes due to the factor in
volved in driving from lot to lot
across campus. Today, I gave up
and parked illegally. I fully ex
pect to find my car ticketed when
1 get back. The problem is, 1
shouldn't be faced with this di
lemma. It's time the University
took action on the parking prob
lem. Off-campus students don't
need the extra hassle.

Gore's speech
contradicted vote
1 find it bitterly ironic that Sen.
Albert Gore, in his recent cam
paign speech on campus (Daily,
Nov. 25), now says he advocates
sensible arms control and
opposes MIRV-type missiles
(those with multiple indepen
dently targetable warheads).
Gore is certainly correct that
MIRV weapons are a destabiliz
ing threat to nuclear deterrence.
Yet in March 1985, Gore pro
vided one of the crucial votes in

favor of the MX missile, handing
Ronald Reagan one of the most
important victories of his
presidency.
The 10-warhead MX is the
worst possible kind of MIRV
weapon. Deployed in the old
Minuteman silos, it is
ridiculously vulnerable to a So
viet first strike and offers a very
tempting target since its 10 war
heads could be destroyed by a
single Soviet one. Indeed, given
its vulnerability and high ac
curacy, it is clear the MX has no
deterrent value at all. Its only
possible use is as a first-strike
weapon itself.
Gore had his chance in 1985 to
take a stand for sensible arms
control and against Reagan's
reckless nuclear policies. In
stead, voting against 45 senators
of both parties (including many
pro-defense conservatives as
well as fellow Democratic presi
dential aspirant Sen. Paul
Simon), Gore helped give us a
multibillion-dollar white elephant
that has done nothing to enhance
our national security and has
dangerously destabilized the nu
clear balance.
