# Overcome homophobia
## 
### 
When GLAS came to visit my freshman dorm
last year, members of the student panel read to us
our answers to questionnaires we had filled out
prior to the session. To the question, "How would
you react to seeing two men or two women holding
hands in public?" the answers were: 1 would stare,
1 would leave the area immediately, 1 would spit on
them. The second answer I recognized as mine.

1 remember the guarded hurt in the voice of the
student who read these answers to us, and how he
prefaced the discussion with an apologetic shrug
and the statement, "The first thing I'll tell you is
that we're not here to recruit anybody." He
glanced at all of us as if he thought some people
might get up and leave, staring as tney left perhaps,
or spitting.
I feel bad when I think about this. The atmos
phere of our freshman dorm was not inhospitable to
GLAS members, but it was definitely characterized
by ignorant curiosity and confusion. I and the
people there couldn't admit much knowledge on
the subject of homosexuality. GLAS members
were there to provide the dorm with information
and discussion that would hopefully dispel some of
the ignorance and misconceptions.
But what is it like, I wonder, to get up in front of
a large group of people to explain your sexuality?
What is it like to be faced by a majority of people
who watch you with expressions of "Go on, prove
yourself to be a \vorthy minority"? When do
heterosexuals ever have to defend their desire to
ask a person out, hold hands with'someone, love
another person?
Homophobia is one of the most tenacious and
overt prejudices today simply because it's still ac
ceptable to make fag jokes at the dinner table and
still possible to expect that everyone is heterosex
ual and happy. This is a revelation that has come
lately to me, and although I'm embarrassed for its
tardiness, I'm glad it's finally here. All this time,
with my inability to comprehend the subject of
homosexuality, I've been doing my own sort of
damage with a prejudice that I suddenly realize
isn't directed toward abstract sexual orientations
or opinions, but real people.
I've learned a term for the type of prevalent
narrow-mindedness in our society — heterosexist.
It's a heterosexist world we live in, what with con
versations, film, advertising, books'and television
directed toward heterosexuals. Actors like the late
Rock Hudson have played romantic heterosexual
leads for quite some time, and it looks like this
trend won't change until people decide that
homosexuality isn't an abnormality.
Fortunately movies like "Maurice" and plays
like "The Normal Heart" make the theaters now,
challenging the notion that the screen and stage are
limited to portrayals of male-female romantic rela
tionships. Comedian Jay Leno provides a twist to

his routine with some "hetero" jokes, a refreshing
switch from the usual "dyke" and "fag"
wisecracks. Perhaps, I like to think, awareness is
on the upswing.
But I know better. Homophobia is a prejudice
strongly intertwined with the values in our society,
primarily because gender roles rule our day-to-day
interactions. A lot of people still cling to an ideal
for relationships: strong independent man meets
beautiful affectionate woman, and after several
dates of moonlit romance, movies lauding their ex
perience and nights of passion, they tie the knot
and produce hordes of bouncing active boys and
sweet attractive girls. Not many people live this
"dream," and yet there's pressure all around us to
conform in some manner to it by playing a specific
role of masculinity or femininity and pursuing in an
appropriate manner a member of the opposite sex.
Life and people are just too diverse to match this
stereotype.
I've experienced simple pressures about being 5
feet, 9 inches (tall girls aren't as feminine), asking a
guy out (you should let him make the first move)
and initiating physical contact (you're too forward,
aggressive). If I think these are societal pressures,
what do you call the prevailing fear and hatred of
homosexuality?
How would it feel, not being able to kiss or hug in
public someone you loved, not being able to admit
you liked a certain person for fear of being singled
out, stared at, brutalized? 1 don't know that enough
heterosexuals ever give this a thought. It's so easy
to assume that another person makes trouble for
his or her self and simply ought to "fit in" if he or
she wants to live comfortably with everyone else.
Again, 1 did my share of staring when 1 went to
see "The Normal Heart." But 1 was jolted into
thinking that yes, men do have serious romantic re
lationships with other men, and that women have
serious romantic relationships with other women.
Previously I had categorized gays and lesbians un
der a "Different Sexual Preferences" grouping,
identifying them as people obsessed with their
sexual orientation. But these relationships involve
more than a sexual aspect to them — they are
"homoloving," not purely homosexual, as one per
son from GLAS explained to me recently.
What strikes me now as 1 write this is that there
will be people out there at the opposite end of the
spectrum who might think these ideas are strange
and wrong. I don't think I've ever written with
such a divided audience in mind. It was hard to
write this column for this reason and the worry that
I would be callously displaying my ignorance or
preaching my point of view. Now if this column
concerned racism or sexism, you know I'd have
very little problem blowing my horn. It's fas
hionable now to say those prejudices are wrong.
My main intention is to share my new frame of
mind with people. I credit this new attitude to some
very open-minded friends and the efforts of people
at GLAS to wipe out myths and open up channels
of communication at Stanford. We can get rid of
homophobia if people look into themselves and
decide what it is they really fear — and decide if it's
worth hurting other people in order to perpetuate
this fear.

ual and happy. This is a revelation that has come
lately to me, and although I'm embarrassed for its
tardiness, I'm glad it's finally here. All this time,
with my inability to comprehend the subject of
homosexuality, I've been doing my own sort of
damage with a prejudice that I suddenly realize
isn't directed toward abstract sexual orientations
or opinions, but real people.
I've learned a term for the type of prevalent
narrow-mindedness in our society — heterosexist.
It's a heterosexist world we live in, what with con
versations, film, advertising, books'and television
directed toward heterosexuals. Actors like the late
Rock Hudson have played romantic heterosexual
leads for quite some time, and it looks like this
trend won't change until people decide that
homosexuality isn't an abnormality.
Fortunately movies like "Maurice" and plays
like "The Normal Heart" make the theaters now,
challenging the notion that the screen and stage are
limited to portrayals of male-female romantic rela
tionships. Comedian Jay Leno provides a twist to

his routine with some "hetero" jokes, a refreshing
switch from the usual "dyke" and "fag"
wisecracks. Perhaps, I like to think, awareness is
on the upswing.
But I know better. Homophobia is a prejudice
strongly intertwined with the values in our society,
primarily because gender roles rule our day-to-day
interactions. A lot of people still cling to an ideal
for relationships: strong independent man meets
beautiful affectionate woman, and after several
dates of moonlit romance, movies lauding their ex
perience and nights of passion, they tie the knot
and produce hordes of bouncing active boys and
sweet attractive girls. Not many people live this
"dream," and yet there's pressure all around us to
conform in some manner to it by playing a specific
role of masculinity or femininity and pursuing in an
appropriate manner a member of the opposite sex.
Life and people are just too diverse to match this
stereotype.
I've experienced simple pressures about being 5
feet, 9 inches (tall girls aren't as feminine), asking a
guy out (you should let him make the first move)
and initiating physical contact (you're too forward,
aggressive). If I think these are societal pressures,
what do you call the prevailing fear and hatred of
homosexuality?
How would it feel, not being able to kiss or hug in
public someone you loved, not being able to admit
you liked a certain person for fear of being singled
out, stared at, brutalized? 1 don't know that enough
heterosexuals ever give this a thought. It's so easy
to assume that another person makes trouble for
his or her self and simply ought to "fit in" if he or
she wants to live comfortably with everyone else.
Again, 1 did my share of staring when 1 went to
see "The Normal Heart." But 1 was jolted into
thinking that yes, men do have serious romantic re
lationships with other men, and that women have
serious romantic relationships with other women.
Previously I had categorized gays and lesbians un
der a "Different Sexual Preferences" grouping,
identifying them as people obsessed with their
sexual orientation. But these relationships involve
more than a sexual aspect to them — they are
"homoloving," not purely homosexual, as one per
son from GLAS explained to me recently.
What strikes me now as 1 write this is that there
will be people out there at the opposite end of the
spectrum who might think these ideas are strange
and wrong. I don't think I've ever written with
such a divided audience in mind. It was hard to
write this column for this reason and the worry that
I would be callously displaying my ignorance or
preaching my point of view. Now if this column
concerned racism or sexism, you know I'd have
very little problem blowing my horn. It's fas
hionable now to say those prejudices are wrong.
My main intention is to share my new frame of
mind with people. I credit this new attitude to some
very open-minded friends and the efforts of people
at GLAS to wipe out myths and open up channels
of communication at Stanford. We can get rid of
homophobia if people look into themselves and
decide what it is they really fear — and decide if it's
worth hurting other people in order to perpetuate
this fear.

When GLAS came to visit my freshman dorm
last year, members of the student panel read to us
our answers to questionnaires we had filled out
prior to the session. To the question, "How would
you react to seeing two men or two women holding
hands in public?" the answers were: 1 would stare,
1 would leave the area immediately, 1 would spit on
them. The second answer I recognized as mine.

1 remember the guarded hurt in the voice of the
student who read these answers to us, and how he
prefaced the discussion with an apologetic shrug
and the statement, "The first thing I'll tell you is
that we're not here to recruit anybody." He
glanced at all of us as if he thought some people
might get up and leave, staring as tney left perhaps,
or spitting.
I feel bad when I think about this. The atmos
phere of our freshman dorm was not inhospitable to
GLAS members, but it was definitely characterized
by ignorant curiosity and confusion. I and the
people there couldn't admit much knowledge on
the subject of homosexuality. GLAS members
were there to provide the dorm with information
and discussion that would hopefully dispel some of
the ignorance and misconceptions.
But what is it like, I wonder, to get up in front of
a large group of people to explain your sexuality?
What is it like to be faced by a majority of people
who watch you with expressions of "Go on, prove
yourself to be a \vorthy minority"? When do
heterosexuals ever have to defend their desire to
ask a person out, hold hands with'someone, love
another person?
Homophobia is one of the most tenacious and
overt prejudices today simply because it's still ac
ceptable to make fag jokes at the dinner table and
still possible to expect that everyone is heterosex
ual and happy. This is a revelation that has come
