## Presidential predictions for 1988 
### 
While my neck is still on the line with the
drug-crazed prediction that the stock market
would drop to 1250, I'd like to hazard an
other, only slightly more sober, prediction:
Paul Simon will be the next U.S. president.
As Simon gathers momentum in lowa, it is
becoming increasingly clear that either the
great bread-basket of the Western world is
populated with a bunch of inebriated lunatics
let loose from graduate school, or that Simon
is a serious candidate with a good shot at win
ning it all, which I think he will.

Eden Quainton

Simon will win for two reasons. First, of all
the Democratic candidates, he has the nar
rowest "reality gap," and this will be
decisive in 1988. The central fact of political
life under Ronald Reagan has been the com
plete separation of rhetoric and reality. The
anti-government, anti-spending rhetoric that
we have heard ad nauseam for the last seven
years has in fact led to increased spending
and a larger, more inefficient government.
In 1988 the crucial question will be whether
a candidate's image and rhetoric correspond
to the substance of who he is and what he
stands for. Gary Hart and Joseph Biden
failed, in my judgment, not because of some
puritan juggernaut, but because they said one
thing and did another — their reality gaps
were about as wide as the Trans-Siberian ex

press.
Look at the other Democratic candidates
and you'll notice a similar reality gap. Jesse
Jackson, the quintessential urban politician,
is posing as the champion of farmers. Albert
Gore, the quintessential Eastern insider,
Washington bom and bred, is masquerading
as a good old Southern boy. Richard Gep
hardt, a man with no clear image at all, is sim
ply and opportunistically riding a Japan
bashing, protectionist wave. Michael
Dukakis, despite his spectacular fund-raising
successes, does not seem to stand for any
thing save his own self-aggrandizement. And
Bruce Babbit? With a name like Babbit,
you'll never be president of the United States
of America.
Simon, however, styles himself an old
fashioned F.D.R., Harry Truman, Jimmy
Carter Democrat, and he really is one. He has
introduced more education legislation than all
the other candidates combined. He founded
the community college system. Although he
is from a coal-producing state, he has been a
leader in the fight against acid rain. His bills
to keep handicapped children in the main
stream of U.S. education, to include pre
scription drugs under Medicare and to pro
vide for part-time, in-house care for senior
citizens all testify eloquently to his long
standing, old-fashioned, F.D.R., Harry
Truman, Jimmy Carter commitment to
"government that cares." Whether you agree
with Simon on the issues is in some sense
beside the point. He really stands for some
thing and you can really believe in him, a

combination that I think will be irresistible in
today s glitzy, insincere, high-tech political
world.
The second reason Simon will win in "88 is
what might be called "imperial backlash."
Almost instinctively, when a president ar
rogates too much power to himself, as
Keagan did in the first six years of his
presidency, voters turn to someone more un
assuming.
Simon is a small, modest man. He never
finished college or went to law school. He
speaks with the eloquence of an average per
son who is genuinely committed to certain
ideals. And like his intellectual honesty,
Simon's unassuming idealism will be tremen
dously powerful amid the shrill, brash
sloganeering that is sure to develop in 1988.
All of which only gets me halfway through
my prediction. Even if he does win the Dem
ocratic nomination, could Simon pose a
serious threat to such pillars of the corporate
establishment as George Bush or Bob Dole?
Instead of arguing any further, I'd like to
propose a test: Get a nice bottle of Stolich
naya or illegally imported Nicaraguan rum,
lock yourself in your room, knock off three or
four double shots and stare at the wall in front
of you. If you can really see Bush or Dole or
any other Republican blabbering away at you
for another four years, finish that bottle.
You'll need it.

Gore, the quintessential Eastern insider,
Washington bom and bred, is masquerading

hardt, a man with no clear image at all, is sim
ply and opportunistically riding a Japan
bashing, protectionist wave. Michael
Dukakis, despite his spectacular fund-raising
successes, does not seem to stand for any

Bruce Babbit? With a name like Babbit,
you'll never be president of the United States

Simon, however, styles himself an old
fashioned F.D.R., Harry Truman, Jimmy
Carter Democrat, and he really is one. He has
introduced more education legislation than all
the other candidates combined. He founded
the community college system. Although he
is from a coal-producing state, he has been a
leader in the fight against acid rain. His bills
to keep handicapped children in the main
stream of U.S. education, to include pre
scription drugs under Medicare and to pro
vide for part-time, in-house care for senior
citizens all testify eloquently to his long
standing, old-fashioned, F.D.R., Harry
Truman, Jimmy Carter commitment to
"government that cares." Whether you agree
with Simon on the issues is in some sense
beside the point. He really stands for some
thing and you can really believe in him, a

combination that I think will be irresistible in
today s glitzy, insincere, high-tech political
world.
The second reason Simon will win in "88 is
what might be called "imperial backlash."
Almost instinctively, when a president ar
rogates too much power to himself, as
Keagan did in the first six years of his
presidency, voters turn to someone more un
assuming.
Simon is a small, modest man. He never
finished college or went to law school. He
speaks with the eloquence of an average per
son who is genuinely committed to certain
ideals. And like his intellectual honesty,
Simon's unassuming idealism will be tremen
dously powerful amid the shrill, brash
sloganeering that is sure to develop in 1988.
All of which only gets me halfway through
my prediction. Even if he does win the Dem
ocratic nomination, could Simon pose a
serious threat to such pillars of the corporate
establishment as George Bush or Bob Dole?
Instead of arguing any further, I'd like to
propose a test: Get a nice bottle of Stolich
naya or illegally imported Nicaraguan rum,
lock yourself in your room, knock off three or
four double shots and stare at the wall in front
of you. If you can really see Bush or Dole or
any other Republican blabbering away at you
for another four years, finish that bottle.
You'll need it.

While my neck is still on the line with the
drug-crazed prediction that the stock market
would drop to 1250, I'd like to hazard an
other, only slightly more sober, prediction:
Paul Simon will be the next U.S. president.
As Simon gathers momentum in lowa, it is
becoming increasingly clear that either the
great bread-basket of the Western world is
populated with a bunch of inebriated lunatics
let loose from graduate school, or that Simon
is a serious candidate with a good shot at win
ning it all, which I think he will.

Simon will win for two reasons. First, of all
the Democratic candidates, he has the nar
rowest "reality gap," and this will be
decisive in 1988. The central fact of political
life under Ronald Reagan has been the com
plete separation of rhetoric and reality. The
anti-government, anti-spending rhetoric that
we have heard ad nauseam for the last seven
years has in fact led to increased spending
and a larger, more inefficient government.
In 1988 the crucial question will be whether
a candidate's image and rhetoric correspond
to the substance of who he is and what he
stands for. Gary Hart and Joseph Biden
failed, in my judgment, not because of some
puritan juggernaut, but because they said one
thing and did another — their reality gaps
were about as wide as the Trans-Siberian ex

press.
Look at the other Democratic candidates
and you'll notice a similar reality gap. Jesse
Jackson, the quintessential urban politician,
is posing as the champion of farmers. Albert
Gore, the quintessential Eastern insider,
Washington bom and bred, is masquerading
as a good old Southern boy. Richard Gep
hardt, a man with no clear image at all, is sim
ply and opportunistically riding a Japan
bashing, protectionist wave. Michael
Dukakis, despite his spectacular fund-raising
successes, does not seem to stand for any
thing save his own self-aggrandizement. And
Bruce Babbit? With a name like Babbit,
