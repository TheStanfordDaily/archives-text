## Old teach young new tricks through Friends and Helpers 
### Kimberly Loffer Staff writer 
While Stanford offers a wide
spectrum of opportunities for
its young students, the occa
sional undergraduate may find
something lacking in the local
youth culture here.
Some seek the perspective of
people who have lived longer
than 21 years, while others sim
ply miss the comfort of a
grandparent's presence on the
Farm.
Friends and Helpers is an
ASSU-sponsored program de
signed to help young and old in
the Stanford community to get
to know each other better.
The program pairs Stanford
students with retired Stanford
professors in order to encour
age friendships as well as pro
vide volunteers to help retirees
in caring for their homes and
gardens.
Many of the professors also
need students to assist with re
search or in organizing aca
demic projects.
Christine Theberge, a senior
majoring in linguistics, and
Tony Arroyo, a senior majoring
in civil engineering, co-direct
the Friends and Helpers pro
gram.
Theberge said she became in
terested in Friends and Helpers
during her freshman year after
she began to miss her grandfat
her.
Now in her fourth year of the
program, Theberge regularly
visits her friends, a couple of
whom she helps in the garden.
Or if it is raining, they sort
through old pictures together.
"My friends love to give me
treats," Theberge said, recall
ing the time they "sat out on
the patio and had root beer
floats."
Theberge emphasized that it
"feels good to help" people in
need and that she has learned a
great deal from her friends. "I
tell them how much they teach
me, but they don't believe
me," she said.
Arroyo joined Friends and
Helpers last year after realizing
that his Stanford career to that
point had not been fufilling
enough.
"I wanted to get more in
volved with the community.
Schoolwork is challenging, but

not very productive. This has
made my life here at Stanford
much more meaningful," he
said of the program.
Arroyo visits a retired civil
engineering professor. Because
his friend stays busy with build
ing projects, Arroyo helped
him build a garden and a tool
storage area.
Arroyo said he has benefitted
from the friendship by learning
from his friend's past experi
ences.
"1 enjoy being able to talk
with someone who has so much
experience in life. My friend
has been at Stanford for 20
years, and he loves telling me
what Stanford was like in the
olden days," Arroyo said.
Sara Dougherty, an un
declared junior, joined the pro
gram last spring. She and two
other students helped Elisabeth
Stenbock-Fermor, assistant
professor in the Department of
Slavic Languages and Litera
tures, date and classify
hundreds of letters from the So
viet Union from 1919 to 1938,
which Stenbock-Fermor later
donated to the Hoover Ar
chives.
Last year, Dougherty helped
another woman organize and
catalog a collection of paint

ings.
While Dougherty said she
has learned from both of her
friends, she feels she was also
able to give to them as well.
The sharing process ' goes both
ways," she said.
In a letter written to the
Friends and Helpers office,
Lawrence Washington, former
assistant professor of engineer
ing, said that the service
Friends and Helpers provides
for retirees is invaluable.
"The interchange of ideas
and communication between
generations enriches both the
young and the old. Deep is the
appreciation and lasting are the
friendships," he wrote.
"I found out, much to my
surprise . . . that the 80-year
old professor with whom 1 was
matched seemed to have more
energy and vitality than me,"
Patrick McGannon, another
volunteer, wrote to the Friends
and Helpers office. McGannon
added that he was "amazed
and inspired by the rich life she
(the professor) has had, and ap
preciative of her honesty and
willingness to share."
The Friends and Helpers
program emerged six years ago
as a result of a SWOPSI class
on aging.
