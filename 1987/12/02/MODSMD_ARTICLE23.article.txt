## Martin and Candy on a wild ride in 'Planes' 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
When 1 first saw the coming at
tractions trailer for "Planes,
Trains and Automobiles," I
thought I was seeing the first
signs of a disaster worse than a
six-car pile-up. First of all, the
trailer, which consisted of Steve
Martin and John Candy perform
ing screwball schtick, simply
wasn't that funny. Secondly, the
film was directed by John
Hughes.
I've never liked John Hughes'
movies. His contrived, pointless
coming-of-age pics, namely
"Sixteen Candles" and"The
Breakfast Club," reeked of ob
noxious young actors and
pseudo-truthful revelations about
teenage life. For a while it
seemed unlikely that Hughes
would ever make a zitless movie
with a cast over 21, but he finally
has.
Hughes' new film is a grown
up movie starring grown-ups,
and in spite of the uninteresting
trailer, the film is actually quite
good.
"Planes, Trains and Auto
mobiles" is a funny, sometimes
mean-spirited, sometimes poig
nant film which is a metaphorical
representation of everyone's
worst fears of traveling in a world
in which every taxi is taken,
every plane is delayed, every
train breaks down, every car gets
wrecked and everything just goes
wrong. The movie emerges as
sort of a commuters' version of
"After Hours."
There are plenty of laughs in
the film, many of which come
from the sight gags and the
slapstick. But the real source of
the film's strength comes from
the relationship and the interplay
between the two very different

main characters.
Steve Martin plays Neal Page,
an uptight, dapper businessman
who is trying to get home from
New York to Chicago for
Thanksgiving. John Candy plays
Del Griffith, a shower-curtain
ring salesman whose overbear
ing, boisterous, unrefined
demeanor is a constant annoy
ance to Martin during their ill
fated odyssey and makes the two
as funny and as odd a couple as
Felix Unger and Oscar Madison.
Their stormy relationship
begins when Candy steals Mar
tin's cab while a rushed Martin is
on his way to the airport. It con
tinues when, on the plane, Mar
tin is bumped from his first-class
seat and forced to sit next to
Candy, whose good-natured but
constant and pointless jabbering
is enough to drive Martin crazy.
It escalates when Martin and
Candy, stranded in Kansas, are
forced to stay in the same hotel
room and sleep in the same bed,
and Martin must put up with
Candy spilling beer in the bed,
cracking every joint in his body
and making sinus noises.
It's not that Candy's Del Grif
fith is a bad person. It's just that
he's not the kind of guy you'd
take to an Emily Post conven
tion. He's bumbling, crude and
not too bright. Martin says he'd
rather spend the whole day at an
insurance seminar than be stuck
with Candy.
Director/writer Hughes tends
to be a little cruel and look down
on the simple nature of Griffith.
Since the Griffith character
remains constant throughout the
picture, the story starts to
become more about the change in
Martin's character as he learns to
tolerate and finally show com
passion for Griffith.
Candy manages to inject just

the right amount of dignity and
sweetness to prevent the charac
ter from becoming a total put
down. He skillfully manages to
turn a role that could have made
him look as stupid as the charac
ter into his best film performance
to date.
Candy was always hilarious
during his days on "SCTV," and
except for "Splash," Candy's
talent has been totally misused in
such inane films as "Brewster's
Millions" and "Armed and Dan
gerous." It's good to see that
he's finally in a film that shows

his flair for comic acting.
Martin is definitely one of the
most underrated actors in films
today. He is deftly able to handle
all sorts of acting, from the elabo
rate physical comedy of "All of
Me" to the graceful, anguished
romanticism of "Roxanne." In
"Planes, Trains and Automo
biles," Martin gets to play a
repressed straight man in a won
derful. understated performance.
Aside from the great comic
pairing of Martin and Candy, I
think that one of the reasons I

enjoyed the film so much was
that I could identify with many of
the horrors of traveling depicted
in the film. For some people, this
humor may be too cruel and
nerve-wracking; for others, it's
right on target.
Despite the good perfor
mances, the movie does have its
share of faults, most of which are
due to Hughes. Hughes doesn't
seem to be willing to take any
chances with his story. Martin
and Candy seem to get out of
their predicaments a little too
easily in spite of the no-win situa

tion into which they seem to be
placed.
Also, the movie seems to run
on a little too long with subplots
about stolen money and ex
changed credit cards that should
have been left on the cutting
room floor.
Finally, the contrived ending is
a little too mushy for my taste
and too reminiscent of Hughes'
sickly sweet teen comedies.
Overall, however, the movie is
a step in the right direction for
Hughes and Candy, and another
feather in Martin's cap.
