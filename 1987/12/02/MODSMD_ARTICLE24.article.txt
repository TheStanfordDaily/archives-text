Circle Jerks — 44 VI"
You see, there's this dance in
punkdom, and it goes like this:
You bounce up and down, not
too lightly. You move to your left
or right, or maybe in a circle,
smashing the guy next to you
with real gusto. Hey, if some
one's nose or eye socket gets in
the way, no problem. Some call it
slamming, others skanking. The
Circle Jerks, one of the true bas
tions of California-grown punk,
just call it life.
The legendary Jerks formed in
1979, when ex-Black Flag
vocalist Keith Morris and former
Redd Kross guitarist Greg Het
son hit the road to greener
pastures. The first lineup was
completed in 1980, and they
dubbed themselves The Circle
Jerks, from (according to their
biography) the Latin "Jurkist
Pi," which were derogatory
remarks made by the Druids
during the construction of
Stonehenge. Jeepers, I always
thought it was some sort of sex
type of, uh . . . never mind.
After four great albums, three
soundtrack credits, two movie
appearances (including "Repo
Man"), a lot of stale beer, a bro
ken back and playing no-name
towns in crammed basements
otherwise known as "clubs," the
Jerks are back yet again with
their fifth album, brilliantly titled
"VI."
Their sound has more of a
metal-ish tinge than in past ef
forts, with a couple guitar solos
thrown in for good measure.
Don't be mistaken, though. High
energy rock (some would call it
"punk") fused with creative lyrics
is still the norm for the band. Songs
such as "Beat Me Senseless" and
"All Wound Up" literally jump at
you with tireless power (how's that
for an aural description).
Rounding out this 12-song opus
are "Love Kills" (originally found
on the "Sid and Nancy"
soundtrack) and a super-charged
cover of CCR's "Fortunate Son."
No polite, soothing pop-pap sold
here. To be sure, the Jerks put full

throttle rock back where it belongs
— in yo' face, dude.

Soup Dragons — " Hang Ten"
"Buzzcockmania. Not the Buz
zcocks but an Amazing Simula
tion." If such a musical ever
existed, the producers would have
no trouble filling the cast — they
could hire the Soup Dragons. One
of the top independent bands in the
UK, the Dragons have finally found
their way to the States. This new
release features all 10 tracks from
their 12-inch singles, only available
previously through import (i.e., six
or seven bucks for two or three
songs).
OK, but what does it sound like?
It's apparent that this delightfully
foppish quartet set the Wayback
Machine for London, 1977. That is,
they truly are the Buzzcocks in
carnate; they sleep, drink and eat
Buzzcocks. One might call them a
retrorock or "rip-off" band, but
there's no denying one fact: They
do it so damn well!
Simple guitar, drums and bass

'Housey' music isn't difficult to ponder.
Just imagine that an extremely affluent
music enthusiast has bribed the Style
Council, The Smiths and the Buzzcocks
into producing a joint project for the
Motown label.

mesh simply, creating two-minute
classic pop punches such as
"Pleasantly Surprised," "Whole
Wide World" and "Hang-Ten."
Singer "Sean" has one of the best
imitation Pete Shelley (Buzzcocks)
whines in the business and greatly
complements the simple power-pop
spewed forth from the rest of the
band.
Wait, do I assume too much?
What do you mean you've never
heard of the Buzzcocks? OK, little
mister (or mistress), I want you to

march right this instant to your lo
cal music outlet and buy one of
their records. They only happen to
be one of the true fathers of modern
pop rock. Don't know which
record to buy? Just get the Soup
Dragons — they sum it up so darn
nicely.

The Housemartins — "The People
Who Grinned Themselves to Death"
What is a "housemartin"? It's a
quaint form of life that somehow
reflects life's realities with a playful
sense of humor. When supplied
with guitars and drums, these
strange creatures gather periodi
cally in order to emit delightful pop
melodies. It seems that after only
having put out two albums, four
housemartins from a small, sheep
town in Scotland have inadver
tently defined a new concept in

music, which has been affec
tionately termed "housey" music
by their hometown fans.
Musically, "housey" music isn't
difficult to ponder. Just imagine
that an extremely affluent music en
thusiast has bribed the Style Coun
cil, The Smiths and the Buzzcocks
into producing a joint project for the
Motown label. I know, I hate it
when reviewers combine groups to
describe other groups. But I swear
to you, this collaboration would
come out of the studio having
created "housey" music.
But the music only adds texture
to the attitude that comes across on
the album. The Housemartins'
music is a pleasant mix of pure pop
sensitivity and naivete. Take the
song "I Can't Put My Finger On
It." It seems that The Housemar
tins like to babble about their subur
ban friends with sarcastic subtlety.
You see, they are sick and tired of
people like "Xanthe," "Marti" and
"FiFi" who "hold hands in the
park" and"chat."
Despite its tendency to immerse
itself in trivial matters of taste and
upbringing, the band does deserve
credit for its treatment of political
matters from a uniquely down-to
earth, personalized viewpoint. In
stead of generalizing the entire situ
ation in South Africa, the song
"Johannesburg" is from the point
of view of one person. The ap

proach is impeccably straightfor
ward, so that the tendency of the
listener is not to agree or disagree
as it were, but to attempt to under
stand the point of view of the
speaker.
In songs such as "The People
Who Grinned Themselves to
Death" and "You Better Be
Doubtful," the approach is similar
in that the tone is expository, not
didactic or condescending. Essen
tially, if you enjoy fast-paced, infec
tious pop music that prompts you
to sing along and dance, this is an
album for you to investigate.
It seems that although in many
cases The Housemartins attempt to
preserve their credibility by occa
sionally throwing in culture and po
litical observations, the brilliantly
crafted, frivolous musical arrange
ments dominate. In the final analy
sis, it's simply fun to listen to The
Housemartins.

The BoLshoi —"Lindy's Party"
Post-punk (or is it post-post
punk?) seems to have come of age.
An entire generation of new groups
has emerged. They are fond of criti
cizing governments and policy
makers in general. According to
these groups, the world is a gloomy
place and we are all alienated
whether or not we know it. Al
though The Bolshoi has been
grouped as such, the label does not
seem entirely appropriate. You see,
they don't particularly care if you
are alienated or not. They are con
cerned with themselves and how
they view the world.
This self-insulation is evident in
the esoteric title of the album itself
as well as the accompanying song
titles. "Lindy's Party," "Aunt
Jean," "Can You Believe It?" and
"She Don't Know" are not titles
that seem to connote understanding
on a wide scale.
In "Lindy's Party," the title cut,
lead vocalist Trevor Tanner
reminisces in self-indulgence, "Say
you were laughing at something
when I saw you the first time/ Such
a model, what an actress/ I must
confess, I never thought you'd be

who you are. . . . But I remember
your eyes/ And your thighs/ And
the jet black tights you wore under
neath your long blue shirt you
bought secondhand to keep you dry
on rainy night." Calm down
Trevor!
According to Tanner, the reason
for using this particular song title as
the album title is "because it
seemed to me like a good title for an
album." Clearly, Tanner didn't
consider the potential commercial
accessibility of the title; it just
"occurred" to him. This recal
citrant notion typifies the truly cyni
cal yet happy-go-lucky attitude of
The Bolshoi.
It seems that the only reason for
the existence of the outside world
in their opinion is to consume their
music. Given the current state of af
fairs in the music industry, The Bol
shoi are mildly refreshing.
Truthfully, the musical perform
ance on "Lindy's Party" is simply
not worthy of note. Their sound is
an inoffensive amalgam of gothic
gloom and modern pop. The dis
tinctive feature is the brash vocal
performance delivered by band
leader Tanner. From his debut with
The Bolshoi in 1985 to his participa
tion in the current album, Tanner
seems to have cultivated a uniquely
virulent disposition.
Displaying his fondness for sar
donic vocal flourishes, he pom
pously comments in "Crack in
Smile," "You wish upon a star . . .
well/ You will wish on anything/
Yes wishing on a tinsel covered
star/ Hanging by a fraying string
. . . now/ Something has to break/
How can you believe when they've
forced you to thieve from yourself/
Something in your smile/ You
know you lire amazing but so self
effacing . . . yes." Yes . . .
presumptious poses of boredom
and an air of contrived mock
sophistication are his specialty, but
of course Tanner is fond of sarcas
tic witticism.
Overall, well ... the album is
mediocre at best. Yes, it does have
its moments. It is well worth a lis
ten or two.

Pi," which were derogatory
remarks made by the Druids
during the construction of
Stonehenge. Jeepers, I always
thought it was some sort of sex
type of, uh . . . never mind.
After four great albums, three
soundtrack credits, two movie
appearances (including "Repo
Man"), a lot of stale beer, a bro
ken back and playing no-name
towns in crammed basements
otherwise known as "clubs," the
Jerks are back yet again with
their fifth album, brilliantly titled
"VI."
Their sound has more of a
metal-ish tinge than in past ef
forts, with a couple guitar solos
thrown in for good measure.
Don't be mistaken, though. High
energy rock (some would call it
"punk") fused with creative lyrics
is still the norm for the band. Songs
such as "Beat Me Senseless" and
"All Wound Up" literally jump at
you with tireless power (how's that
for an aural description).
Rounding out this 12-song opus
are "Love Kills" (originally found
on the "Sid and Nancy"
soundtrack) and a super-charged
cover of CCR's "Fortunate Son."
No polite, soothing pop-pap sold
here. To be sure, the Jerks put full

throttle rock back where it belongs
— in yo' face, dude.

Soup Dragons — " Hang Ten"
"Buzzcockmania. Not the Buz
zcocks but an Amazing Simula
tion." If such a musical ever
existed, the producers would have
no trouble filling the cast — they
could hire the Soup Dragons. One
of the top independent bands in the
UK, the Dragons have finally found
their way to the States. This new
release features all 10 tracks from
their 12-inch singles, only available
previously through import (i.e., six
or seven bucks for two or three
songs).
OK, but what does it sound like?
It's apparent that this delightfully
foppish quartet set the Wayback
Machine for London, 1977. That is,
they truly are the Buzzcocks in
carnate; they sleep, drink and eat
Buzzcocks. One might call them a
retrorock or "rip-off" band, but
there's no denying one fact: They
do it so damn well!
Simple guitar, drums and bass

'Housey' music isn't difficult to ponder.
Just imagine that an extremely affluent
music enthusiast has bribed the Style
Council, The Smiths and the Buzzcocks
into producing a joint project for the
Motown label.

mesh simply, creating two-minute
classic pop punches such as
"Pleasantly Surprised," "Whole
Wide World" and "Hang-Ten."
Singer "Sean" has one of the best
imitation Pete Shelley (Buzzcocks)
whines in the business and greatly
complements the simple power-pop
spewed forth from the rest of the
band.
Wait, do I assume too much?
What do you mean you've never
heard of the Buzzcocks? OK, little
mister (or mistress), I want you to

march right this instant to your lo
cal music outlet and buy one of
their records. They only happen to
be one of the true fathers of modern
pop rock. Don't know which
record to buy? Just get the Soup
Dragons — they sum it up so darn
nicely.

The Housemartins — "The People
Who Grinned Themselves to Death"
What is a "housemartin"? It's a
quaint form of life that somehow
reflects life's realities with a playful
sense of humor. When supplied
with guitars and drums, these
strange creatures gather periodi
cally in order to emit delightful pop
melodies. It seems that after only
having put out two albums, four
housemartins from a small, sheep
town in Scotland have inadver
tently defined a new concept in

music, which has been affec
tionately termed "housey" music
by their hometown fans.
Musically, "housey" music isn't
difficult to ponder. Just imagine
that an extremely affluent music en
thusiast has bribed the Style Coun
cil, The Smiths and the Buzzcocks
into producing a joint project for the
Motown label. I know, I hate it
when reviewers combine groups to
describe other groups. But I swear
to you, this collaboration would
come out of the studio having
created "housey" music.
But the music only adds texture
to the attitude that comes across on
the album. The Housemartins'
music is a pleasant mix of pure pop
sensitivity and naivete. Take the
song "I Can't Put My Finger On
It." It seems that The Housemar
tins like to babble about their subur
ban friends with sarcastic subtlety.
You see, they are sick and tired of
people like "Xanthe," "Marti" and
"FiFi" who "hold hands in the
park" and"chat."
Despite its tendency to immerse
itself in trivial matters of taste and
upbringing, the band does deserve
credit for its treatment of political
matters from a uniquely down-to
earth, personalized viewpoint. In
stead of generalizing the entire situ
ation in South Africa, the song
"Johannesburg" is from the point
of view of one person. The ap

proach is impeccably straightfor
ward, so that the tendency of the
listener is not to agree or disagree
as it were, but to attempt to under
stand the point of view of the
speaker.
In songs such as "The People
Who Grinned Themselves to
Death" and "You Better Be
Doubtful," the approach is similar
in that the tone is expository, not
didactic or condescending. Essen
tially, if you enjoy fast-paced, infec
tious pop music that prompts you
to sing along and dance, this is an
album for you to investigate.
It seems that although in many
cases The Housemartins attempt to
preserve their credibility by occa
sionally throwing in culture and po
litical observations, the brilliantly
crafted, frivolous musical arrange
ments dominate. In the final analy
sis, it's simply fun to listen to The
Housemartins.

The BoLshoi —"Lindy's Party"
Post-punk (or is it post-post
punk?) seems to have come of age.
An entire generation of new groups
has emerged. They are fond of criti
cizing governments and policy
makers in general. According to
these groups, the world is a gloomy
place and we are all alienated
whether or not we know it. Al
though The Bolshoi has been
grouped as such, the label does not
seem entirely appropriate. You see,
they don't particularly care if you
are alienated or not. They are con
cerned with themselves and how
they view the world.
This self-insulation is evident in
the esoteric title of the album itself
as well as the accompanying song
titles. "Lindy's Party," "Aunt
Jean," "Can You Believe It?" and
"She Don't Know" are not titles
that seem to connote understanding
on a wide scale.
In "Lindy's Party," the title cut,
lead vocalist Trevor Tanner
reminisces in self-indulgence, "Say
you were laughing at something
when I saw you the first time/ Such
a model, what an actress/ I must
confess, I never thought you'd be

who you are. . . . But I remember
your eyes/ And your thighs/ And
the jet black tights you wore under
neath your long blue shirt you
bought secondhand to keep you dry
on rainy night." Calm down
Trevor!
According to Tanner, the reason
for using this particular song title as
the album title is "because it
seemed to me like a good title for an
album." Clearly, Tanner didn't
consider the potential commercial
accessibility of the title; it just
"occurred" to him. This recal
citrant notion typifies the truly cyni
cal yet happy-go-lucky attitude of
The Bolshoi.
It seems that the only reason for
the existence of the outside world
in their opinion is to consume their
music. Given the current state of af
fairs in the music industry, The Bol
shoi are mildly refreshing.
Truthfully, the musical perform
ance on "Lindy's Party" is simply
not worthy of note. Their sound is
an inoffensive amalgam of gothic
gloom and modern pop. The dis
tinctive feature is the brash vocal
performance delivered by band
leader Tanner. From his debut with
The Bolshoi in 1985 to his participa
tion in the current album, Tanner
seems to have cultivated a uniquely
virulent disposition.
Displaying his fondness for sar
donic vocal flourishes, he pom
pously comments in "Crack in
Smile," "You wish upon a star . . .
well/ You will wish on anything/
Yes wishing on a tinsel covered
star/ Hanging by a fraying string
. . . now/ Something has to break/
How can you believe when they've
forced you to thieve from yourself/
Something in your smile/ You
know you lire amazing but so self
effacing . . . yes." Yes . . .
presumptious poses of boredom
and an air of contrived mock
sophistication are his specialty, but
of course Tanner is fond of sarcas
tic witticism.
Overall, well ... the album is
mediocre at best. Yes, it does have
its moments. It is well worth a lis
ten or two.

Circle Jerks — 44 VI"
You see, there's this dance in
punkdom, and it goes like this:
You bounce up and down, not
too lightly. You move to your left
or right, or maybe in a circle,
smashing the guy next to you
with real gusto. Hey, if some
one's nose or eye socket gets in
the way, no problem. Some call it
slamming, others skanking. The
Circle Jerks, one of the true bas
tions of California-grown punk,
just call it life.
The legendary Jerks formed in
1979, when ex-Black Flag
vocalist Keith Morris and former
Redd Kross guitarist Greg Het
son hit the road to greener
pastures. The first lineup was
completed in 1980, and they
dubbed themselves The Circle
Jerks, from (according to their
biography) the Latin "Jurkist
Pi," which were derogatory
remarks made by the Druids
during the construction of
Stonehenge. Jeepers, I always

"All Wound Up" literally jump at
you with tireless power (how's that
for an aural description).
Rounding out this 12-song opus
are "Love Kills" (originally found
on the "Sid and Nancy"
soundtrack) and a super-charged
cover of CCR's "Fortunate Son."
No polite, soothing pop-pap sold
here. To be sure, the Jerks put full

throttle rock back where it belongs

Soup Dragons — " Hang Ten"
"Buzzcockmania. Not the Buz
zcocks but an Amazing Simula
tion." If such a musical ever
existed, the producers would have
no trouble filling the cast — they
could hire the Soup Dragons. One
of the top independent bands in the
UK, the Dragons have finally found
their way to the States. This new
release features all 10 tracks from
their 12-inch singles, only available
previously through import (i.e., six
or seven bucks for two or three
songs).
OK, but what does it sound like?
It's apparent that this delightfully
foppish quartet set the Wayback
Machine for London, 1977. That is,
they truly are the Buzzcocks in
carnate; they sleep, drink and eat
Buzzcocks. One might call them a
retrorock or "rip-off" band, but
there's no denying one fact: They
do it so damn well!
Simple guitar, drums and bass

'Housey' music isn't difficult to ponder.
Just imagine that an extremely affluent
music enthusiast has bribed the Style
Council, The Smiths and the Buzzcocks
into producing a joint project for the
Motown label.

mesh simply, creating two-minute
classic pop punches such as
"Pleasantly Surprised," "Whole
Wide World" and "Hang-Ten."
Singer "Sean" has one of the best
imitation Pete Shelley (Buzzcocks)
whines in the business and greatly
complements the simple power-pop
spewed forth from the rest of the
band.
Wait, do I assume too much?
What do you mean you've never
heard of the Buzzcocks? OK, little
mister (or mistress), I want you to

march right this instant to your lo
cal music outlet and buy one of
their records. They only happen to
be one of the true fathers of modern
pop rock. Don't know which
record to buy? Just get the Soup
Dragons — they sum it up so darn
nicely.

The Housemartins — "The People
Who Grinned Themselves to Death"
What is a "housemartin"? It's a
quaint form of life that somehow
reflects life's realities with a playful
sense of humor. When supplied
with guitars and drums, these
strange creatures gather periodi
cally in order to emit delightful pop
melodies. It seems that after only
having put out two albums, four
housemartins from a small, sheep
town in Scotland have inadver
tently defined a new concept in

music, which has been affec
tionately termed "housey" music
by their hometown fans.
Musically, "housey" music isn't
difficult to ponder. Just imagine
that an extremely affluent music en
thusiast has bribed the Style Coun
cil, The Smiths and the Buzzcocks
into producing a joint project for the
Motown label. I know, I hate it
when reviewers combine groups to
describe other groups. But I swear
to you, this collaboration would
come out of the studio having
created "housey" music.
But the music only adds texture
to the attitude that comes across on
the album. The Housemartins'
music is a pleasant mix of pure pop
sensitivity and naivete. Take the
song "I Can't Put My Finger On
It." It seems that The Housemar
tins like to babble about their subur
ban friends with sarcastic subtlety.
You see, they are sick and tired of
people like "Xanthe," "Marti" and
"FiFi" who "hold hands in the
park" and"chat."
Despite its tendency to immerse
itself in trivial matters of taste and
upbringing, the band does deserve
credit for its treatment of political
matters from a uniquely down-to
earth, personalized viewpoint. In
stead of generalizing the entire situ
ation in South Africa, the song
"Johannesburg" is from the point
of view of one person. The ap

proach is impeccably straightfor
ward, so that the tendency of the
listener is not to agree or disagree
as it were, but to attempt to under
stand the point of view of the
speaker.
In songs such as "The People
Who Grinned Themselves to
Death" and "You Better Be
Doubtful," the approach is similar
in that the tone is expository, not
didactic or condescending. Essen
tially, if you enjoy fast-paced, infec
tious pop music that prompts you
to sing along and dance, this is an
album for you to investigate.
It seems that although in many
cases The Housemartins attempt to
preserve their credibility by occa
sionally throwing in culture and po
litical observations, the brilliantly
crafted, frivolous musical arrange
ments dominate. In the final analy
sis, it's simply fun to listen to The
Housemartins.

The BoLshoi —"Lindy's Party"
Post-punk (or is it post-post
punk?) seems to have come of age.
An entire generation of new groups
has emerged. They are fond of criti
cizing governments and policy
makers in general. According to
these groups, the world is a gloomy
place and we are all alienated
whether or not we know it. Al
though The Bolshoi has been
grouped as such, the label does not
seem entirely appropriate. You see,
they don't particularly care if you
are alienated or not. They are con
cerned with themselves and how
they view the world.
This self-insulation is evident in
the esoteric title of the album itself
as well as the accompanying song
titles. "Lindy's Party," "Aunt
Jean," "Can You Believe It?" and
"She Don't Know" are not titles
that seem to connote understanding
on a wide scale.
In "Lindy's Party," the title cut,
lead vocalist Trevor Tanner
reminisces in self-indulgence, "Say
you were laughing at something
when I saw you the first time/ Such
a model, what an actress/ I must
confess, I never thought you'd be

who you are. . . . But I remember
your eyes/ And your thighs/ And
the jet black tights you wore under
neath your long blue shirt you
bought secondhand to keep you dry
on rainy night." Calm down
Trevor!
According to Tanner, the reason
for using this particular song title as
the album title is "because it
seemed to me like a good title for an
album." Clearly, Tanner didn't
consider the potential commercial
accessibility of the title; it just
"occurred" to him. This recal
citrant notion typifies the truly cyni
cal yet happy-go-lucky attitude of
The Bolshoi.
It seems that the only reason for
the existence of the outside world
in their opinion is to consume their
music. Given the current state of af
fairs in the music industry, The Bol
shoi are mildly refreshing.
Truthfully, the musical perform
ance on "Lindy's Party" is simply
not worthy of note. Their sound is
an inoffensive amalgam of gothic
gloom and modern pop. The dis
tinctive feature is the brash vocal
performance delivered by band
leader Tanner. From his debut with
The Bolshoi in 1985 to his participa
tion in the current album, Tanner
seems to have cultivated a uniquely
virulent disposition.
Displaying his fondness for sar
donic vocal flourishes, he pom
pously comments in "Crack in
Smile," "You wish upon a star . . .
well/ You will wish on anything/
Yes wishing on a tinsel covered
star/ Hanging by a fraying string
. . . now/ Something has to break/
How can you believe when they've
forced you to thieve from yourself/
Something in your smile/ You
know you lire amazing but so self
effacing . . . yes." Yes . . .
presumptious poses of boredom
and an air of contrived mock
sophistication are his specialty, but
of course Tanner is fond of sarcas
tic witticism.
Overall, well ... the album is
mediocre at best. Yes, it does have
its moments. It is well worth a lis
ten or two.

Circle Jerks — 44 VI"
You see, there's this dance in
punkdom, and it goes like this:
You bounce up and down, not
too lightly. You move to your left
or right, or maybe in a circle,
smashing the guy next to you
with real gusto. Hey, if some
one's nose or eye socket gets in
the way, no problem. Some call it
slamming, others skanking. The
Circle Jerks, one of the true bas
tions of California-grown punk,
just call it life.
The legendary Jerks formed in
1979, when ex-Black Flag
vocalist Keith Morris and former
Redd Kross guitarist Greg Het
son hit the road to greener
pastures. The first lineup was
completed in 1980, and they
dubbed themselves The Circle
Jerks, from (according to their
biography) the Latin "Jurkist
Pi," which were derogatory
remarks made by the Druids
during the construction of
Stonehenge. Jeepers, I always
thought it was some sort of sex
type of, uh . . . never mind.
After four great albums, three
soundtrack credits, two movie
appearances (including "Repo
Man"), a lot of stale beer, a bro
ken back and playing no-name
towns in crammed basements
otherwise known as "clubs," the
Jerks are back yet again with
their fifth album, brilliantly titled
"VI."
Their sound has more of a
metal-ish tinge than in past ef
forts, with a couple guitar solos
thrown in for good measure.
Don't be mistaken, though. High
energy rock (some would call it
"punk") fused with creative lyrics
is still the norm for the band. Songs
such as "Beat Me Senseless" and
"All Wound Up" literally jump at
you with tireless power (how's that
for an aural description).
Rounding out this 12-song opus
are "Love Kills" (originally found
