## Santa Clara shocks Stanford, 72-71 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
A whole lot of Todd Lichti
turned out to he not quite enough
last night at Maples Pavilion, as
Stanford lost a hearthreaker to
the Santa Clara Broncos 72-71.
Registering 31 points in 38
minutes (tying a career-high for
points set last weekend against
Chaminade), Lichti kept the Car
dinal in the lead for most of the
game. But helped along by an of
ficial's questionable call and
some lackluster, downright emo
tionless Stanford play, the
Broncos outscored the Cardinal
12-4 in the final two minutes to
walk away with a surprising win.
"I hope we're a better basket
ball team than that," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"We were outplayed, simple as
that."
There were a lot of things the
Cardinal could have blamed for
the loss; officiating and fatigue
were two obvious factors. A ref
eree's call helped the Broncos
pull off a rarely seen five-point
play, and with last night's game
the fourth in five days for the
team, Stanford was probably a
bit tired.
But Montgomery would have
none of the expected rationaliza
tions. "There's no excuses," he
said. "We didn't compete. Santa
Clara wanted it worse than we
did.
"Todd did a great job, but we
need some other people doing
some other things."
Specifically, the Cardinal
needed more defense, more
second-half rebounds and more
points from players other than
Lichti. After outrebounding the
Broncos 17-10 in the first half,

the Cardinl finished the game un
only one board. 31-30. Of
fensively, only senior Greg But
ler, with 14 points for the game,
was able to join Lichti in double
figures. And defensively, a flat
footed Cardinal fell prey to pick
after Bronco pick.
"We weren't staying in the
proper positions," Montgomery
said. "When you don't stay in
position, you get screened out."
Lichti's final two points came
with 4:32 left in the game. Junior
Howard Wright scored the
game's next bucket at 2:42 to
give the Cardinal what looked
like a comfortable seven-point
lead, 67-60. From there on out,
however,the game was all Santa
Clara.
Two free throws by Santa
Clara guard Osei Appiah and the
third three-pointer of a 4-for-4
night from the perimeter by for
ward Mitch Burley brought the
Broncos to within 67-65.
The Cardinal's Bryan Mc-
Sweeney made good on both
ends of a one-and-one from the
line to make it 71-65, and the
stage was set for the five-point
play. The Broncos' Jens Gordon,
a regular starter who had sat out
most of the first half because of
bursitis in his knees, set a pick to
spring the sharp-shooting Burley
from a trailing McSweeney.
Trying to follow his man,
McSweeney pushed through
Gordon and committed a foul. In
doing so, he ended up on the
ground. With McSweeney
watching from the floor, Burley
let fly his fourth three-pointer of
the night. The official ruled the
basket good and awarded a one
and-one to Gordon.
There was little question of the

foul. "1 was holding my ground,
and he pushed and pushed,"
Gordon said. But whether the
shot should have counted
seemed questionable at best.
Montgomery's only response:
"1 won't comment on the of
ficiating."
Stanford called a timeout, but
it didn't rattle Gordon, who
nailed both free throws to put the
Broncos ahead by one.
There were 50 seconds left and
the Cardinal had the ball. With 33
seconds to go, Wright made good
on a shot from seven feet to give
Stanford a one-point lead.
On the other end, the Broncos
missed a shot, but gained another
chance when Appiah grabbed the
rebound. Appiah got the ball
down low to Bronco center Dan
Weiss, who was fouled by Lichti
as he went up. With two seconds
to go and Stanford up by one,
Weiss was sent to the line tor two
shots.
Montgomery called timeout.
"I was praying he would make it.
1 was calling on every lucky
totem I had," Gordon said.
Whether or not Gordon's fortune
made the difference, Weiss made
the shot and tied the score.
Montgomery called a second
timeout.
But Weiss wasn't rattled. He
hit the second free throw and put
the Broncos ahead by one, giving
Santa Clara its first lead since
8:11 to go in the first half.
"Free throws hurt us in the
first half (in which the Broncos
went l-for-8 from the line) and
helped us in the end," Santa
Clara Coach Carroll Williams
said.
After one last timeout, Stan
ford freshman Andrew Vlahov
threw a long inbound pass to
Wright. Wright's last-second
shot missed, and the game was
over. Butler tipped the ball in,
but the excitement died quickly
as the official signaled that But
ler's effort was too late.
