# Lichti zeroes in from the line
## 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
Stanford has found the closest thing to The Per
fect Shot.
It's known as the Todd Lichti free-throw attempt,
although in Lichti's case, it's more of a free-throw
certainty. Going into last night's game against Santa
Clara, the junior had connected on 23 straight free
throws, and during the contest, he hit another 12 in
a row.
Thirty-five straight free throws. That's like going
5-for-5 in baseball, or birdieing seven consecutive
holes in golf. It's somewhat akin to getting A's on
all your finals. It's pretty good.
Lichti's shot is so automatic that when he missed
free throw No. 36 with 7:17 left to play, a murmur of
surprise went up from the crowd of 4216.
"I had no idea how many I'd made," Lichti said.
"I just knew I was shooting fairly well from the
free-throw line."
That's something of an understatement. On the
season, the Cardinal guard is 40-for-44 from the line
— an average of .909.
To put that in perspective, the all-time best free
throw percentage in Stanford history was recorded
by Gerry Thuesen in 1960 with a season average of
.888. Stanford's top free-throw average last year
was Terry Taylor's .848, which led the Pacific 10
Conference. Lichti had a percentage of .809.
"He's just a great athlete," said Santa Clara
guard Chris Lane, who spent much of the game at
tempting to defend Lichti. "And great athletes
make their free throws. We were told not to foul
him, but I guess we didn't listen to that too much."
"Lichti was all he was cracked up to be," Santa
Clara Coach Carroll Williams said. "We did every
thing we could against him. He can shoot, and he
can score."
The junior tied his career high
with 31 points on 9-for-13 shoot
ing from the field (including one
three-pointer) and 12-of-13 from
the line. "He's a scoring ma
chine," Bronco forward Jens
Gordon said. "He's hard to stop.
He'll just jump over you, and he
can go with either hand."
The All-America candidate,
who made the All-Pac-10 team as
a forward both his freshman and
sophomore years, seems to be
settling in at the guard position
this year. "I feel pretty comforta
ble there," Lichti said. "I'm up
at the top of the key, and I can go
either way to the basket."

Ironically, it was a Lichti foul,
his third of the game, that sent
Bronco center Dan Weiss to the
line with two seconds left and
Stanford leading 71-70.
"They passed it in, and 1 went
over to help," Lichti said. "1
thought he (Weiss) would put it
on the floor, and I was going to
knock it away. But he went up
with it. Yeah, it was a foul."
"Weiss was going to shoot a
lay-in," Williams said. "You've
got to do something — don't
blame it on Lichti."
Up until that point, Lichti had
more free throws (12) than the
entire Santa Clara squad (10).
But Weiss, who had missed his
first two free-throw attempts, hit
two to win the game for Santa
Clara.
