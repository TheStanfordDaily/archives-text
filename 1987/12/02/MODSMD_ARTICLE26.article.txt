# Lichti zeroes in from the line

Stanford has found the closest thing to The Per
fect Shot.
It's known as the Todd Lichti free-throw attempt,
although in Lichti's case, it's more of a free-throw
certainty. Going into last night's game against Santa
Clara, the junior had connected on 23 straight free
throws, and during the contest, he hit another 12 in
a row.
Thirty-five straight free throws. That's like going
5-for-5 in baseball, or birdieing seven consecutive
holes in golf. It's somewhat akin to getting A's on
all your finals. It's pretty good.
Lichti's shot is so automatic that when he missed
free throw No. 36 with 7:17 left to play, a murmur of
surprise went up from the crowd of 4216.
"I had no idea how many I'd made," Lichti said.
"I just knew I was shooting fairly well from the
free-throw line."
That's something of an understatement. On the
season, the Cardinal guard is 40-for-44 from the line
â€” an average of .909.
To put that in perspective, the all-time best free
throw percentage in Stanford history was recorded
by Gerry Thuesen in 1960 with a season average of
.888. Stanford's top free-throw average last year
was Terry Taylor's .848, which led the Pacific 10
Conference. Lichti had a percentage of .809.
"He's just a great athlete," said Santa Clara
guard Chris Lane, who spent much of the game at
tempting to defend Lichti. "And great athletes
make their free throws. We were told not to foul
him, but I guess we didn't listen to that too much."
"Lichti was all he was cracked up to be," Santa
Clara Coach Carroll Williams said. "We did every
thing we could against him. He can shoot, and he
can score."
