# Cagers rebound to outduel 'Dogs
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
It's tough to play three straight
games on the road. It's tougher
still to enter enemy territory as
the 17th-ranked team in the land,
knowing that your opponent
would like nothing more than to
knock you from your lofty perch.
And, it's perhaps toughest of all
when that opponent blew you out
81-64 on your home court last
year.
Last night, though, the Stan
ford women's basketball team
showed its toughness in over
coming a seven-point deficit in
the second half to defeat the
Fresno State Bulldogs 61-53 and
up its record to 3-0 on the season.
Sophomore forward Katy
Steding led the Cardinal with 16
points. Sophomore guard Jenni
fer Azzi was just a notch behind,
chalking up 15 in the contest.
Azzi also did it defensively —
coming up with seven steals — as
did junior center Jill Yanke, who
blocked five shots while tallying
13 points of her own.
The win didn't come easily for
the Cardinal. Facing a 2-3 /one

— the first zone the team has
faced all season — the Cardinal
was unable to cope with the Bull
dog defense in the first half. The
team shot only 13-of-37 for a .351
field-goal percentage.
Fresno State, on the other
hand, shot 42 percent from the
field and went into the locker
room leading 30-29. Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer then
"went over things" during
halftime.
But the second half started off
even worse than the first had
ended. In the first three minutes,
the Bulldogs put together a 6-0
run and the Cardinal fell behind
36-29. Then Azzi came up with a
three-pointer and Steding fol
lowed with a three-point play,
pulling the Cardinal to within
one.
Things seesawed back and
forth for the next several
minutes. Fresno State was cling
ing to a one-point lead, at 44-43,
with exactly nine minutes to
play.

game. Steding completed another
three-point play, sparking a 12-3
Stanford run. When the run was
finally snapped, the Cardinal
held a 55-47 lead and only 5:48
was showing on the clock.
Stanford continued to pour it
on and held a 10-point lead with
2:31 left in the game. The Bull
dogs would only be able to shave
two points off the lead before it
was over.
The game was played before a
crowd of 1007, the largest ever to
watch a women's nasketball
game at Fresno State, and appar
ently the hostile fans had an ef
fect on the Cardinal in the early

going. "It is not an easy place to
play," VanDerveer said.
But the tough test gave the
Cardinal a chance to show some
of the stuff that has merited the
high ranking the team has
received. Though Stanford com
mitted 20 turnovers, the Cardinal
forced Fresno State into 26.
When it needed to, the Cardi
nal found its shooting touch also,
sinking 44 percent of its shots in
the second half. On top of that,
the defense turned rock-solid and
held the Bulldogs to 31 percent.
VanDerveer was able to work
12 players into the game, includ
ing several of the highly touted
freshmen. Forward Celeste
Lavoie played 21 minutes off the
bench, scoring two points and
pulling down four rebounds.
