# A
						wild and woolly year for Pacific 10
## 
### 
The Pacific 10 Conference
football regular season is now
over, and it ended in a fittingly
bizarre fashion — with two
ties.

\o t that the California-
Washington State 17-17 tie
was any surprise. This year's
Coca-Cola Bowl in Tokyo was
a battle to determine which
team was worse, and the
Bears and the Cougars proved
that they are equally bad.
The amazing thing about the
game is the attempts of local
sportswriters and columnists
to defend Cal's poor perform
ance in Japan. Too many dis
tractions, they say. Gosh, the
Bears had to teach that pow
der puff girl's team to play and
stuff. No wonder they lost.

And, of course, Cal had to use
its backup quarterback.
Funny, 1 seem to remember
Stanford traveling to Tokyo
last season and upsetting
Arizona (an infinitely better
team than Washington State)
despite the distractions — and
the Cardinal had to go with
backup quarterback Greg En
nis in the second half.
The Stanford coaching staff
took a practical approach to
the game in Japan by minimiz
ing distractions and making
sure the team followed a rigid
schedule to combat jet lag,
such as enforcing an early cur
few.
Arizona didn't have an early
curfew last year, and Wildcat
players were spotted all over
town at all hours of the night.
They lost. Cal should have
learned a lesson from this and
should stop making excuses
about how impossible it is to
play football with "distrac
tions." They tied Washington
State because neither team
