Awards do not take away frus
tration, but they can ease the
pain.
Sam Koch, coach of the
talented but often disappointing
Stanford men's soccer team, has
been selected Pacific Soccer
Conference Coach of the Year
for 1987 by league coaches.
The Cardinal finished the
season 9-9-3 overall and in third
place with a 3-3 mark in confer
ence matches. However, the un
heralded squad, which was not
expected to be a contender for
the league crown, was in the run
ning for both the PSC champion
ship and an NCAA playoff berth
midway through the season.
In an eight-day period from
Oct. 3-11, Stanford defeated four
nationally ranked opponents,
shutting out three of the four
teams. Wins over No. 2 San
Francisco, No. 4 Fresno State,
No. 8 UCLA and No. 20 Wash
ington and a victory in the
ATT/Pacific West Soccer Classic
raised the Cardinal's record to 7-
4-3 and gave the squad hopes of a
national tournament bid.
But the team put itself out of
contention when it dropped
several key contests in the
second half of the season.
"I was very surprised, espe
cially because I felt we should
have won some games that we
didn't," Koch said of the award.
"I'm really honored to be picked
by the other coaches in the
league, considering the competi
tion. There are some great
coaches in the conference."
" He definitely deserved the
award this year, because we
showed the greatest improve
ment of any team in our divi
sion," sophomore defender
Mark Semioli said.
In his four years at Stanford,
Koch has compiled a 38-33-13
record. Although he has coached

a number of talented squads, the
Cardinal with Koch at the helm
has yet to reach the NCAA
playoffs.
Koch was not the only member
of the soccer team to be honored
this year. Four players were also
selected by the conference
coaches for the all-league
squads.

'If anyone on the team
deserved a first-team
selection, it was him.'
— Sam Koch

Standout sophomore fullback
Semioli was named to the Pacific
Soccer Conference's first team.
The sweeper, voted the Most
Valuable Player of the 1986 Stan
ford squad, played the key role in
the Cardinal's defense. Semioli
was also chosen as MVP of the
ATT/Pacific West tournament,
and was selected to play on the
Western Regional Team.
"Mark was a definite selec
tion, there is no doubt in my
mind," Koch said. "If anyone on
the team deserved a first-team
selection, it was him."
"It was almost a given that he
would be chosen," co-captain
Pat Sheehy said. "He was
definitely deserving."
Sheehy himself was the
recipient of a league award. The
senior midfielder was chosen for
the all-league second team for the
second time in his Stanford
career. Sheehy was the Cardi
nal's third-leading scorer with
three goals and two assists, and
had the game-winning goal
against UCLA Oct. 11.
Junior fullback Dave Thorpe
and sophomore forward Chris
Porch were honorable mention
all-league selections. Thorpe also
scored three goals this season,
while Porch was Stanford's
leading scorer with seven goals
and one assist.
