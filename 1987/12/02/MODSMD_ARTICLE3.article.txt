# University seeks to protect tropics

### Jennifer Jenkins 
The Stanford Center for Con
servation Biology and a Wash
ington-based biological preserva
tion organization have an
nounced a joint effort to manage
and preserve vast, newly
acquired tracts of tropical rain
forest in Central and South
America.
The Stanford center, a small
independent institute that is part
of the the Biological Sciences
Department, will provide techni
cal advice in developing a man
agement plan for sections of land
controlled by Conservation In
ternational, an organization that
seeks to preserve tropical rain
forests and the species that live
in them.
The Stanford center and Con
servation International will sign
an agreement here Dec. 10 that
will address governance of the
Bolivian Beni Biosphere
Reserve, a 4-million-acre tract in
Bolivia that was acquired by
Conservation International last
summer. Conservation Interna
tional, which obtained the land in
exchange for writing off part of
Bolivia's international debt, will
manage the tract, primarily
Amazonian lowland, as a natural
preserve.

"Stanford will soon be doing
something very beneficial for de
veloping countries," said Anne
Ehrlich, acting director of the
Stanford Center for Conserva
tion Biology.
The joint program to save
Latin America's tropics is a new
concept, according to Ehrlich.
"It's a completely new kind of
thing," Ehrlich said. "It's a very
promising approach to helping to
save biological diversity in an
area where it is so endangered."
Officials of Conservation In
ternational were unavailable for
comment last night.
Kathy Rehm, a research assis
tant at the Stanford center, ex
plained that the novel project is
important to preserve rare
species. "This idea is catching on
as a great way to preserve land in
the Third World," she said.
"The land down there needs to
be preserved so that the unit can
survive as an ecological whole.
"It's an effort to keep alive
more of the species that are
native to that area," she added.
"If it's not done, more and more
things will disappear."
The first of its kind in any aca
demic institution, the center was
established in 1985 to provide
technical support to conservation
projects worldwide. The center
draws on expertise in many aca
demic disciplines to develop
strategies for preserving the
world's flora and fauna. These
disciplines include biology, pop
ulation studies, ecology, anthro
pology and economics.
In addition to creating a plan
for managing the Beni Reserve,
the center will also provide train
ing in conservation biology for
visiting Latin American students
and professionals who will even
tually take over the management
of the area. "We will be helping
them to be better at managing
what they have," Ehrlich said.
Groups of Stanford students

and faculty are planning to travel
to the reserve in the future.
"They will be working and train
ing people in Bolivia who will be
running the preserve," said
Marybeth Buechner, a research
associate at the center.
"There will be collaboration
and consultation with the local
people," said Ehrlich. "The pro
gram will involve timber harvest
ing and farming as well as pre
servation, and planning with the
local people is necessary."
As many as four or five other
biological preserves may also
receive Stanford's assistance as
part of the December agreement,
because Conservation Interna
tional has ties with several
countries in Central and South
America, as well as connections
with different funding groups that
could help finance additional
projects.
