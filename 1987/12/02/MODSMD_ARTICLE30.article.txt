# Grapplers tackle Gators
## Paradise to compete in 118-pound division 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
Optimism prevails as the Stanford wrestling team
heads into tonight's match with San Francisco
State at 7:30 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
"Last year we lost by a disappointing margin,"
177-pound Ron Perry said. "This year we will
win."
With two undefeated wrestlers competing— 158-
pound sophomore Steve Yarbrough and freshman
Steve Buddie at 167 pounds — the 2-2 Stanford
squad has a good chance of proving Perry's predic
tion correct.
Supporting Perry's positive outlook is the new
presence of 118-pound Matt Paradise. For the first
time this season the Cardinal will be competing
with a 118-pound wrestler. Stanford has been
forced to forfeit that weight class in each of its first
four meets.
Because of Paradise's low weight (about 105
pounds), Stanford Coach Chris Horpel has decided
against using Paradise in competition thus far this
season. Most 118-pound wrestlers cut weight from
as much as 140 pounds before their seasons begin.
Paradise is at a disadvantage because he is
working to gain weight. Horpel, however, believes
that tonight, since the Gators' 118-pound wrestler
is relatively small, Paradise should have a fair
match.
"I'm just anxious to be out there," Paradise
said. "I'm as ready as I'll ever be."
Last year's loss to the Gators was especially dif
ficult for the Cardinal to swallow, because in
several close matches the scales tipped away from
Stanford's favor.

With only 10 matches to decide each meet, it's
important to win in as many weight brackets as
possible. In addition, different margins of victory
garner different amounts of team points. Since a tie
gives each team one point while a pin gives the win
ning side six points, a meet can be mathematically
won by just a handful of wrestlers.

'Last year we lost by a disap
pointing margin. This year we
will win.'
— Ron Perry

A team with five good wrestlers can potentially
become dominant during the dual meet season.
Thus, the scoring system makes wrestling the quin
tessential combination of team and individual com
petition.
As in every match, tonight's meet should prove
to be a good test of the contribution of each
wrestler to his team's score.
"I think they (San Francisco State) have a pretty
comparable team to ours," Stanford tri-captain
Terry Mclntyre said. "It'll be close."
This week will be a particularly busy one for
Stanford. The team leaves tomorrow morning for a
trip to the Las Vegas Invitational, which Horpel de
scribed as "the NCAAs without the Eastern
schools." Perennial powerhouses from the Mid
west such as lowa, Wisconsin and Nebraska will
loom as large roadblocks for the Cardinal.

Heading into tonight's contest with a 2-2 record this season, freshman 142-pounder James Dinette and the
Cardinal wrestling team look to move above the .S(H) mark at San Francisco State.
