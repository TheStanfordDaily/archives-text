A visiting professor in Stan
ford's Hansen Laboratories was
struck and killed Saturday by an
alleged drunk driver while cross
ing a street in Sunnyvale.
Prof. De-Yu Pan, a visiting
professor of precision engineer
ing in Stanford's Gravity Ptobe B
program, died from injuries
received after being struck by a
car south-bound on Hollenbeck
Avenue around 8:45 p.m. Satur
day.
Sunnyvale police officials said
charges will likely be pressed
against the driver of the vehicle,
who is under investigation for
driving while intoxicated.
A colleague of Pan called his
death "a terrible blow" to the
Gravity Probe B program. "De-
Yu was a fine engineer and a
wonderful colleague. Although

she had only been with us for 18
months, it is hard now to imagine
the group without her. We shall
miss her," said Prof. Francis
Everitt, principal investigator for
the program.
Pan arrived in the United
States two years ago from the
People's Republic of China,
where she was an associate pro
fessor in the Department of Me
chanical Engineering at Shanghai
JiaoTong University.
John Turneaure, manager of
hardware development for the
program, called Pan "a very ded
icated worker, with a pleasant
and radiating personality. Her
technical contributions were ex
cellent."
Pan joined the Gravity Probe B
Program in June 1986. According
to Turneaure, the program is at-

tempting to measure two etYects
of Einstein's general theory of
relativity that have not yet been
measured. The project involves
putting a gyroscope in polar orbit
and measuring the procession of
the gyroscope with respect to a
star.
Pan was responsible for ultra
precise fabrication and measure
ments of gyro rotors, or spinning
balls, used in the experiment.
She was the program's specialist
in making spheres and measuring
their roundness. According to W.
Stephen Cheung, a department
colleague, "She was meticulous
in data-taking."
Cheung said Pan was a model
for her students and a "very pos
itive person who always had a
smile on her face.
"She was not an ordinary pro

fessor who would act superior to
her students," Cheung said.
"She was an inspiration to all the
students who worked with her.
She was well respected by her
Chinese friends in the Stanford
community."
Cheung said the program will
suffer because of Pan's death,
but said the department is still in
shock over the accident and has
not yet thought about naming a
successor.
Fan is survived by her hus
band, Prof. Gao Ming, a distin
guished material scientist cur
rently at Lehigh University in
Betlehem, Pa., and two children,
16 and 22 years of age.
Funeral services have been ar
ranged for Sunday, Dec. 6, at 2
p.m. at the Lima Family Mor
tuary in Sunnyvale.
