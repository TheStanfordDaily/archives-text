# Black leader defends membership rules
## Controversy emerges over BSU membership rules 
### Lori Silver Editorial staff 
Recent discussion that the
Black Student Union's member
ship policies discriminate against
non-blacks has brought to light
what BSU Chair Bill King terms
misperceptions of the BSU's
function and purpose at Stan
ford .
King disputed the findings of a
"Bug Me" column (Daily, Nov.
12) that reported that a white stu
dent wanting to become a mem
ber of the BSU would have to go
through a different process than a
black student — since blacks are
automatically members. This

raised questions about who could
become a member of the BSU
and what membership entails.
If a non-black student wishes
to be a member of the BSU, the
article stated, he or she must
show a demonstrated interest in
the liberation of African people,
meet with the BSU officer corps
to discuss the student's desire to
join the BSU and then submit to
a vote of the general BSU mem
bership. in which the student will
either be accepted or rejected as
a member.
According to King, anyone can
be a member of the BSU, as long
as the person has a "genuine
commitment to the uplift of the

black community, the liberation
of the black people." Non-black
students who wish to be mem
bers would not be subjected to a
vote, he said.
"The Black Student Union has
no official membership roster,
and no one is excluded from par
ticipating in BSU committees,
activities or general meetings.
There is no official membership
process. All students who would
like to actively participate in the
organization must come to the
BSU officers and discuss their
level of commitment," King said
in a letter to The Daily.
In fact, the BSU's constitution
makes no reference to member

ship procedures for non-black
students. The constitution
defines its membership as "all
currently registered black stu
dents at Stanford University."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said he believed "Bill
King Jwas] saying that the BSU
wants evidence of commitment
to the organization. But, 1
wonder if the color of one's skin
is evidence of commitment.
"I think that any organization
that has race as a condition of
membership runs the risk of
losing University recognition,"
Lyons said. University policy
states that any recognized organ
ization must be open to all stu

dents.
Lyons said "there may have
been conversation" about inves
tigating the policies of the BSU.
He added that Associate Dean of
Campus Affairs Michael Jackson
would be inquiring about the
BSU's membership policies —
the first step in determining the
BSU's status as a student organi
zation.
As a result of the controversy,
the BSU may consider redefining
the word membership in its con
stitution, King said.
"For active membership, there
must be a genuine commitment
