# Black leader defends membership rules
## Controversy emerges over BSU membership rules 
### Lori Silver Editorial staff 
Recent discussion that the
Black Student Union's member
ship policies discriminate against
non-blacks has brought to light
what BSU Chair Bill King terms
misperceptions of the BSU's
function and purpose at Stan
ford .
King disputed the findings of a
"Bug Me" column (Daily, Nov.
12) that reported that a white stu
dent wanting to become a mem
ber of the BSU would have to go
through a different process than a
black student — since blacks are
automatically members. This

raised questions about who could
become a member of the BSU
and what membership entails.
If a non-black student wishes
to be a member of the BSU, the
article stated, he or she must
show a demonstrated interest in
the liberation of African people,
meet with the BSU officer corps
to discuss the student's desire to
join the BSU and then submit to
a vote of the general BSU mem
bership. in which the student will
either be accepted or rejected as
a member.
According to King, anyone can
be a member of the BSU, as long
as the person has a "genuine
commitment to the uplift of the

black community, the liberation
of the black people." Non-black
students who wish to be mem
bers would not be subjected to a
vote, he said.
"The Black Student Union has
no official membership roster,
and no one is excluded from par
ticipating in BSU committees,
activities or general meetings.
There is no official membership
process. All students who would
like to actively participate in the
organization must come to the
BSU officers and discuss their
level of commitment," King said
in a letter to The Daily.
In fact, the BSU's constitution
makes no reference to member

ship procedures for non-black
students. The constitution
defines its membership as "all
currently registered black stu
dents at Stanford University."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said he believed "Bill
King Jwas] saying that the BSU
wants evidence of commitment
to the organization. But, 1
wonder if the color of one's skin
is evidence of commitment.
"I think that any organization
that has race as a condition of
membership runs the risk of
losing University recognition,"
Lyons said. University policy
states that any recognized organ
ization must be open to all stu

dents.
Lyons said "there may have
been conversation" about inves
tigating the policies of the BSU.
He added that Associate Dean of
Campus Affairs Michael Jackson
would be inquiring about the
BSU's membership policies —
the first step in determining the
BSU's status as a student organi
zation.
As a result of the controversy,
the BSU may consider redefining
the word membership in its con
stitution, King said.
"For active membership, there
must be a genuine commitment
for liberation and a desire to in
crease understanding," King
said.
King said some BSU members
may be apprehensive of people
who are not members of Stan
ford's black community becom
ing actively involved in the BSU.
King defined the black commu
nity as including both blacks and
non-blacks who identify with the
Afro-American experience.
King explained that "the BSU
is under such pressure, is misper
ceived so much that there is al
ways a real fear of people coming
in who aren't committed, who
have other motivations."
"There's a fear of folks coming
in with completely different per
spectives, coming in and ques
tioning our basic assumptions
and ideas — like questioning
Malcolm X," he added.

The BSU maintains its integ
rity as a voice for the black com
munity by ensuring that its lead
ership is comprised of blacks,
King said. A non-black may
become a member of the organi
zation, but not a leader.
"I don't think the BSU should
have to defend why it's all
black," said freshman Dereca
Blackmon, a BSU member.
"Being the voice of the black
community, the BSU couldn't ef
fectively do that if we let white
students in. There is no place for
[a white student] to tell me what
racism against blacks is. You
don't really know."
The BSU's fear of outsiders is
understandable when examined
in context of the organization's
history, said Keith Archuleta,
dean of black community
services.
"People need to have a histori
cal context. White people have

not been beating down doors to
join (the BSU)," Archuleta said.
"The BSU has had to exist
through racist times, with the
University against them.
The BSU nas a long history of
standing alone and fighting which
has resulted in its suspicion of
outsiders, Archuleta said. While
the group was very successful in
the late 1960s as a result of the
heightened awareness of racism
during the civil rights movement,
it lost most of its allies in the
19705.
"The BSU was the lone voice
in the '705," Archuleta said,
noting that it was during this pe
riod that the BSU was labeled as
radical. "Now it's good to see
other organizations participat
ing."
At other schools in California,
organizations of black students
have followed routes similar to
Stanford's BSU.
The African American Student
Association (AASA) at UC-
Berkeley is an open organization,
because all student organizations
at Berkeley need to have a non
discrimination clause, said Mike
Berry, an AASA member.
"In practicality, the AASA is
open to anyone who believes in
the goals of the organization,"
Berry said. "But there are no
white members.
However, at USC the Black
Student Union differs from the
organizations at Stanford and
Berkeley.
BSU chair Mark Forte said
anyone can become a member of
the organization. "We don't dis
criminate. We're not exclusive,"
he said.
The BSU at USC represents
the black population's political
thinking as well as bringing to
gether black students, Forte said.
"We're not just for the black stu
dents," he said. "Our objective
is to enhance the entire student
population."
For non-black students at
Stanford who want to fight
against racism, Archuleta recom
mended that they attempt to or
ganize themselves, work directly
with the BSU's committees or
with other organizations in con
cert with the BSU.
White students have worked
with the BSU in connection with
the "You Can Make a Differ
ence" conference and Stanford
Out of South Africa, King said.
But, he added, "No white stu
dent who has been committed to
our ideals has ever asked to be
part of the BSU.
"When the time comes, we'll
see what happens," he said.

ing actively involved in the BSU.
King defined the black commu
nity as including both blacks and
non-blacks who identify with the
Afro-American experience.
King explained that "the BSU
is under such pressure, is misper
ceived so much that there is al
ways a real fear of people coming
in who aren't committed, who
have other motivations."
"There's a fear of folks coming
in with completely different per
spectives, coming in and ques
tioning our basic assumptions
and ideas — like questioning
Malcolm X," he added.

The BSU maintains its integ
rity as a voice for the black com
munity by ensuring that its lead
ership is comprised of blacks,
King said. A non-black may
become a member of the organi
zation, but not a leader.
"I don't think the BSU should
have to defend why it's all
black," said freshman Dereca
Blackmon, a BSU member.
"Being the voice of the black
community, the BSU couldn't ef
fectively do that if we let white
students in. There is no place for
[a white student] to tell me what
racism against blacks is. You
don't really know."
The BSU's fear of outsiders is
understandable when examined
in context of the organization's
history, said Keith Archuleta,
dean of black community
services.
"People need to have a histori
cal context. White people have

not been beating down doors to
join (the BSU)," Archuleta said.
"The BSU has had to exist
through racist times, with the
University against them.
The BSU nas a long history of
standing alone and fighting which
has resulted in its suspicion of
outsiders, Archuleta said. While
the group was very successful in
the late 1960s as a result of the
heightened awareness of racism
during the civil rights movement,
it lost most of its allies in the
19705.
"The BSU was the lone voice
in the '705," Archuleta said,
noting that it was during this pe
riod that the BSU was labeled as
radical. "Now it's good to see
other organizations participat
ing."
At other schools in California,
organizations of black students
have followed routes similar to
Stanford's BSU.
The African American Student
Association (AASA) at UC-
Berkeley is an open organization,
because all student organizations
at Berkeley need to have a non
discrimination clause, said Mike
Berry, an AASA member.
"In practicality, the AASA is
open to anyone who believes in
the goals of the organization,"
Berry said. "But there are no
white members.
However, at USC the Black
Student Union differs from the
organizations at Stanford and
Berkeley.
BSU chair Mark Forte said
anyone can become a member of
the organization. "We don't dis
criminate. We're not exclusive,"
he said.
The BSU at USC represents
the black population's political
thinking as well as bringing to
gether black students, Forte said.
"We're not just for the black stu
dents," he said. "Our objective
is to enhance the entire student
population."
For non-black students at
Stanford who want to fight
against racism, Archuleta recom
mended that they attempt to or
ganize themselves, work directly
with the BSU's committees or
with other organizations in con
cert with the BSU.
White students have worked
with the BSU in connection with
the "You Can Make a Differ
ence" conference and Stanford
Out of South Africa, King said.
But, he added, "No white stu
dent who has been committed to
our ideals has ever asked to be
part of the BSU.
"When the time comes, we'll
see what happens," he said.

The Black Student Union feels that many of its activities, like the
protest at last May's Cornerstone Weekend celebration, are misun
derstood outside the black community.
Recent discussion that the
Black Student Union's member
ship policies discriminate against
non-blacks has brought to light
what BSU Chair Bill King terms
misperceptions of the BSU's
function and purpose at Stan
ford .
King disputed the findings of a
"Bug Me" column (Daily, Nov.
12) that reported that a white stu
dent wanting to become a mem
ber of the BSU would have to go
through a different process than a
black student — since blacks are
automatically members. This

raised questions about who could
become a member of the BSU
and what membership entails.
If a non-black student wishes
to be a member of the BSU, the
article stated, he or she must
show a demonstrated interest in
the liberation of African people,
meet with the BSU officer corps
to discuss the student's desire to
join the BSU and then submit to
a vote of the general BSU mem
bership. in which the student will
either be accepted or rejected as
a member.
According to King, anyone can
be a member of the BSU, as long
as the person has a "genuine
commitment to the uplift of the

black community, the liberation
of the black people." Non-black
students who wish to be mem
bers would not be subjected to a
vote, he said.
"The Black Student Union has
no official membership roster,
and no one is excluded from par
ticipating in BSU committees,
activities or general meetings.
There is no official membership
process. All students who would
like to actively participate in the
organization must come to the
BSU officers and discuss their
level of commitment," King said
in a letter to The Daily.
In fact, the BSU's constitution
makes no reference to member

ship procedures for non-black
students. The constitution
defines its membership as "all
currently registered black stu
dents at Stanford University."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said he believed "Bill
King Jwas] saying that the BSU
wants evidence of commitment
to the organization. But, 1
wonder if the color of one's skin
is evidence of commitment.
"I think that any organization
that has race as a condition of
membership runs the risk of
losing University recognition,"
Lyons said. University policy
states that any recognized organ
ization must be open to all stu

dents.
Lyons said "there may have
been conversation" about inves
tigating the policies of the BSU.
He added that Associate Dean of
Campus Affairs Michael Jackson
would be inquiring about the
BSU's membership policies —
the first step in determining the
BSU's status as a student organi
zation.
As a result of the controversy,
the BSU may consider redefining
the word membership in its con
stitution, King said.
"For active membership, there
must be a genuine commitment
for liberation and a desire to in
crease understanding," King
said.
King said some BSU members
may be apprehensive of people
who are not members of Stan
ford's black community becom
ing actively involved in the BSU.
