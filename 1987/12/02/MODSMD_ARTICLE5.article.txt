# DA: No charges in Kinko's caper
## 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
The Santa Clara County
District Attorney s Office said
yesterday there was not
enough evidence concerning a
recent coupon-redemption in
cident at Kinko's Copies to
file charges against any of the
parties involved.
On Nov. 13, Stanford junior
Robert Sterbal attempted to
redeem 25(H) coupons for 1(K)
free copies each at two local
Kinko's copies shops, but was
turned away by managers of
both shops.
Sterbal filed a police report
the same day alleging that Palo
Alto Kinko's manager Chuck
Dicker threatened his life after
he made several attempts to
negotiate a deal regarding use
of the coupons.
Deputy district attorney
Neil Kimball read the report
yesterday and determined that
it did not contain enough
evidence to support Sterbal's
claim.
Kimball said the argument
between Sterbal and Dicker
was "basically a civil
dispute."
"The case is over as far as
Kinko's is concerned,'"
Dicker said. "He (Sterbal) can
do whatever he wants with

those coupons."
When asked about the dis
trict attorney's decision to
drop the case, Sterbal said he
was not suprised by the deci
sion.
"It was just his word against
mine," he said.
Beginning early in fall quar
ter, Sterbal collected more
than 25(H) coupons from an on
campus advertising circular.
Campus Connection. He said
he hoped to use the coupons to
reproduce reading materials
for certain courses, which he
intended to sell, using some of
his profits to provide flowers
for Stanford students.
According to Dicker, the
coupon's offer of 100 free
copies is invalid because of an
error on the coupon as it ap
peared in the circular.
Dicker said Kinko's in
tended the coupon to be
redeemable for only 25 free
copies, and that it include a
disclaimer that read, "Offer
limited to one per customer."
He added that the publisher of
Campus Connection, Uncom
mon Solution Inc.. admitted
responsibility for the errors in
the coupon.
He also said yesterday that
Sterbal "is banned from
Kinko's stores."
