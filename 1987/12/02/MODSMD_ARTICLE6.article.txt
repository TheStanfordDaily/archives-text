## Turner urges environmental sensitivity 
### Scott Renshaw Staff writer 
Broadcasting magnate Ted Turner yester
day called for a "change in our way ot'think
ing" about the deteriorating state of the envi
ronment and urged students to become in
volved in this issue.
"Modern man has viewed the world as the
enemy," Turner said. "We conquer the
forests, conquer the land."
In a rambling, hour-long talk, the out
spoken president of Turner Broadcasting and
owner of the Atlanta Hawks basketball and
Atlanta Braves baseball franchises encour
aged graduates of business schools to seek
employment with companies "exploring al
ternative energy sources and environmental
clean-up."
Turner also expressed particular concern
about the effects of world overpopulation.
"The world is collapsing all around us under
the weight of its population," Turner said.
"In 20 years, this planet could be ter
minally ill," he said.
Turner said that after entering the broad
cast news business, "I started getting much
more serious. ... I became a do-gooder."
Turner noted his involvement with Na
tional Geographic and Audobon Society spe
cials on W I BS and the formation of the Bet
ter World Society, an environmental action
group.
Turner described his speaking schedule as
part of his involvement. "I could be in At
lanta smoking a joint (and) taking it easy," he
said. "I'm not getting paid for this."
Turning to his business interests. Turner
said "the way to make a lot of money is to
come up with a new idea."
He acknowledged, however, that the idea
for W I BS, his Atlanta-based satellite super-

station, was not new. "HBO was
the first to use a satellite,"
Turner said. "I just read it in a
magazine.
"I went to the government and
asked if 1 could use the satellite,"
he added. "But there's no appli
cation form, so I did it."
Turner also discounted rumors
about his wealth, saying,
"People ask me how you make a

billion dollars, but I don't have a
billion. I owe a billion."
"Besides," Turner added, "a
billion after 40-percent taxes is,
what, 600 million. I mean, what's
the point of it all?"
Turner frequently injected
humor into his remarks, saying,
"If I just stood up here telling
you the way it was in the world,
you'd all be crying."
Turner answered questions
from the audience on a variety of
subjects. Regarding possible po

litical ambitions, Turner
responded, "No. I've thought
about it real hard, (but) I don't
want to worry about the domes
tic details of one little country."
Turner also addressed his com
pany's controversial colorization
of classic black-and-white films.
"Opposition to colorization was
a plan of mine to get publicity,"
Turner said.
"If I had decided to colorize
the Three Stooges or the black
and-white episodes of Gilligan's

Island,' nobody would have
cared," he said. "As it is, five
billion dollars of free publicity."
At the beginning of his
remarks. Turner corrected an in
troduction that stated he
graduated from Brown Univer
sity.
"I didn't graduate," he said.
"I was thrown out a couple
times.
"I'm sure I would have made a
lot more money if I'd had a little
education," he added.
