NASA awards $30 hill ion contract
NASA selected four aerospace contractors yesterday to
design and build the U.S. manned space station, a project worth
as much as $30 billion that will create about 12,000 jobs in seven
states across the nation.
The NASA awards went to McDonnell Douglas Astronautics
Co. in Huntington Beach. Rockwell International's Rocketdyne
Division in Canoga Park, General Electric's Astro-Space Divi
sion in Pennsylvania and Boeing's Aerospace Co. in Huntsville,
Ala.
All four prime contractors will use dozens of subcontractors
to do about 50 percent of the work. Peak employment on the
project is expected in about three years.
The space station will be assembled in orbit above the earth in
the mid-1990s and will require 19 flights by the space shuttle to
haul various parts into place. The station, which will be home to
a crew of six to eight astronauts, will have living quarters, labo
ratories and work areas. It will be the largest structure ever put
into space and is expected to be used for decades.
Although the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
plans to issue preliminary contracts within two weeks, funding
of the space station faces an uncertain future because of severe
federal budget pressure.
"Our guess is that there will be enough (funds) to go ahead
with these contracts, but we don't really know," said NASA
Administrator James Fletcher in announcing the awards. "It
took a little bit of courage on our part to go ahead."
Contras outline truce proposal
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica — Nicaraguan rebel leaders yester
day outlined a truce proposal that called for an end to Sandinista
control over several major areas of Nicaraguan life as a condi
tion for halting their guerrilla war.
The proposal would freeze the positions of Sandinista and
rebel troops and bar both sides from rearming during a cease
fire. The rebels would lay down their weapons only when a
process of "irreversible democratization" was under way in
Nicaragua and when the Sandinistas agreed to joint control of a
new national army.
Exiled civilian leaders of the U.S.-backed insurgency issued
their 15-point plan here after Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo,
Nicaragua's Roman Catholic primate, agreed to mediate cease
fire negotiations. He summoned both sides to open separate
talks with him tomorrow in the Dominican Republic.
The rebel document rejects most elements of the 11-point
Sandinista position announced Nov. 13, which calls on the con
tras simply to disarm within a month and return to civilian life.
The rebels' demands would require political discussions that the
government has repeatedly ruled out.
"We can never accept disarmament as the first stage of a
truce,"' said Alfredo Cesar, a rebel leader. "It must proceed in
pace with the democratization of Nicaragua."
Politicians battle for mayor's post
CHICAGO — Politicians dropped all pretense of mourning
over the late Mayor Harold Washington yesterday as open, po
tentially violent trench warfare broke out between city council
factions trying to seize control of the vacant mayor's office.
Only a day after the funeral of the city's first black mayor,
thousands of demonstrators packed city hall corridors and the
streets outside, trying to block a vote engineered by black Al
derman Eugene Sawyer to install himself as acting mayor.
The demonstrators, who had been urged on Monday by Dem
ocratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, were supporting
Alderman Timothy Evans, who is also black and who, as Wash
ington's floor leader, claims to be the mayor's heir apparent.
Though Sawyer was also a Washington supporter, the demon
strators complained that his support on the council was too
heavily weighted with white aldermen tied to the old Demo
cratic political machine Washington had toppled.
Sawyer was pressing for a quick vote before his support could
erode, but Evans, believing that a delay could shift momentum
his way, was trying to erect parliamentary and other roadblocks
to a Sawyer vote.
Evans supporters, trying to whip up grass-roots support,
lobbied black community leaders. Meanwhile, at least two black
Sawyer allies said they had come under intense pressure from
angry constituents and called for a delay in the vote.
Former lawyer testifies on Deaver
WASHING I ON — Former White House counsel Fred Field
ing said yesterday that he cautioned an associate of Michael
Deaver that Deaver's lobbying firm should curtail efforts to con
tact senior White House officials "regardless of the tech
nicalities of the law."
Fielding said he assumed that his warning to William Sittman
was relayed to Deaver, who had resigned as White House dep
uty chief of staff a month earlier in 1985 to form a lobbying firm
here.
Fielding's testimony highlighted a central element in the five
count perjury case against Deaver, who has maintained that his
lobbying contacts with senior administration officials were legal
and proper under a ruling in 1983 by the Office of Government
Ethics.
Despite the ruling, Fielding said, he did not want Deaver or
Sittman, both of whom left the White House in May 1985, con
tacting senior officials.
Fielding said he suggested that they could talk to Secretary of
State George Shultz or National Security Council staff members
because such contacts would be acceptable under the ethics
ruling.
American writer Baldwin dies
PARIS — James Baldwin, a renowned writer who spent a
lifetime in literature trying to explore his identity as a black and
as an American, died Monday night at the age of 63 in his home
in St. Paul de Vence in the south of France.
His death from cancer was announced yesterday morning by
Bernard Hassalle, a longtime companion and secretary.
The eldest son of a Harlem preacher, Baldwin, a small, slight
man, was looked on for much of two decades both as a distin
guished young American novelist and as a black essayist with
the extraordinary, almost uncanny power of making his black
experience meaningful to a white audience.
But, after the 1950s and 19605, his reputation waned, perhaps
because he had become too strident a black for white audiences,
perhaps because he failed, like other American novelists of the
20th century, to maintain the excitement and freshness of his
earlier work.
But there is little doubt that his first novel, "Go Tell It on the
Mountain," an autobiographical work about his youth in Har
lem, and his first book of essays, "Notes of a Native Son," a se
ries exploring his life as a black living in Flurope, made an unus
ual impact on the literary scene when published in 1953 and
1955, respectively. Both works are still highly regarded.
