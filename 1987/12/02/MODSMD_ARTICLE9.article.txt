# Reagan: Soviets violate arms pact
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — A week before his
summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, President Reagan has decided to
charge the Soviet Union with a new violation
of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile (ABM)
Treaty, senior U.S. officials said yesterday.
The alleged violation, expected to be re
ported to Congress today in the administra
tion's annual Soviet arms control compliance
report, involves several old radars the
Soviets moved to new locations this year, al
though the ABM treaty requires that they
remain at a designated ABM "test range."
Reagan made his decision Monday after
hearing from senior arms control and military
advisers, some of whom argued that the So
viet action was ambiguous, had little military
significance and needed further investigation

before any conclusions could be reached, the
officials said.
These advisers, including senior State De
partment representatives, pointed out that
the Soviets invited the United States in Octo
ber to conduct an on-site inspection of one of
the radars and argued that it was premature
to charge the Soviets with a treaty violation
while the offer is pending.
The administration responded to the Soviet
offer last month by asking to inspect the
radars, located in the Moscow region and at
an electronics plant in the city of Gomel,
north of Kiev. The administration is still
awaiting a Soviet response.
The officials said the "violation" claim
was initially pressed by the Defense Depart
ment and vigorously opposed by the State

Department. The Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency (ACDA) took the intermediate
position that the radar redeployments were a
"probable violation" but that further investi
gation was needed before making a firmer al
legation.
Some officials also argued that release of
the annual compliance report should be
delayed until after the summit's conclusion.
But conservatives on Capitol Hill, unhappy
with the summit and the intermediate-range
nuclear forces (INF) treaty to be signed
there, pressed the White House not to delay
the report past Congress' Dec. 1 due date.
The Defense Department position on the
radars was set by Caspar Weinberger before
he left office as secretary of defense.
