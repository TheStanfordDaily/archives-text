# Adult education proposed
## 
### Michael MacCrystall Staff writer 
I he Faculty Senate will consider today a pre
liminary proposal to create a continuing educa
tion program that will offer various liberal arts
courses to qualified individuals from communi
ties surrounding Stanford.
I he program, the first of its kind at Stanford,
will draw from the University's best faculty, ac
cording to Vice Provost William Chace, who
chairs the Provostial Task Force on Continuing
Education.
Chace said yesterday he believes Stanford fac
ulty members are supportive of the idea because
it will help improve relations between Stanford
and nearby communities, including Atherton,
Menlo Park and Mountain View.
"Members of these communities often drive
by or walk around campus," Chace said. "This
program will let these people see what is going
on in the most important part of the school: the
classroom."
Chace emphasized that the program could be
quite lucrative for the University. Harvard
grosses about $6 million annually from its con
tinuing education program, which boasts 13,000
students in 50 fields of study, he said.
Stanford's program will be less ambitious,
said Diana Diamond, assistant director of Uni
versity Relations. It will start small and grow to
include as manv as 40 courses, she said.
Stanford will award academic credit but no

degrees to students taking continuing education
courses.
According to the program proposal, profes
sors who teach continuing education classes will
earn $3500 per course, a figure comparable to
the amount paid instructors of similar courses at
other universities.
There is strong interest in the program among
faculty members, Chace noted, but he said the
task force is worried that distracting professors
from their regular teaching responsibilities could
be a danger.
"It you say that Stanford's faculty is already
stretched thin, then wouldn't this stretch it thin
ner?" he asked. This concern will likely be the
focus of today 's senate discussions.
Another point of concern is that the Stanford
program may compete unfairly with local junior
colleges, the report says. One way to eliminate
that possibility would be for the Stanford pro
gram to be based in San Francisco.
A recent area telephone survey revealed that
nearby community members have a strong inter
est in classes relating to their work and personal
growth.
The survey, conducted under the supervision
of Communication Prof. Donald Roberts,
revealed that 70 percent of the 273 persons
polled had a "definite" or "probable" interest in
arts, music, drama or creative writing. Strong in
terest was also expressed in business manage
ment, literature, social science and natural sci
ence.
