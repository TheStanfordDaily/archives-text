# Rev.'s remarks spark forum
## Rabbi and chapel dean discuss anti-Semitic comments 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
In response to the controversy surrounding Rev.
Lawrence Carter's alleged anti-Semitic remarks at
last month's "You Can Make a Difference" confer
ence, Rabbi Ari Cartun and Dean of the Chapel
Robert Gregg discussed the question of "Christian
Anti-Semitism" at a forum here last night.
At the Nov. 15 conference, Carter said in his ser
mon that Jews "told non-Jews they could take a
free jet ride to hell" and that "Jews, in their
defensiveness, arrogance and feeling of superior
ity, scorned non-Jews." He made his comments in
reference to the parable of Jonah in the Bible.
Cartun said Carter's statements were not a result
of a "purposeful hatred" of Jews but rather
stemmed from a "teaching of hateful contempt that
goes on in Christianity."
Gregg said that Carter's statements, even consid
ering that they refer to Jews of past times, are hurt
ful because they show "hostility and stereotyp
ing." Gregg, who said he felt upset about the
remarks, indicated that he has expressed his con
cern to Carter. Gregg said Carter's comments "had
the effect of neutralizing and in fact of working di
rectly against the main point of the sermon."
However, Gregg pointed out that although Car
tun said he viewed the remarks as anti-Semitic and
anti-Zionist, he found these charges to be
"unfounded, unfair, untrue and unconstructed."
Some students and staff members of different
faiths expressed feelings of hurt and surprise at

Carter's remarks, while others expressed anger and
misunderstanding about the "over-sensitivity'" of
the issue.
Sophomore Karen Abrams, who worked on the
conference which was devoted to the subject of in
stitutional racism, said she felt betrayed by
Carter's comments. At a conference whose aim
was to eradicate prejudices, she said, these
"blanket statements" about Jews were
"inappropriate."
Similar concerns were expressed by other stu
dents and by Cartun. Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, who moderated the discussion in
Otero House, said he was surprised at reactions to
the sermon.
Ernie Young, a senior lecturer at Memorial
Church, expressed anger at what he saw as Jewish
prejudices and "over-sensitivity." He argued that
Jews have perpetuated racism by refusing to marry
outside of their faith and by the fact that some rab
bis refuse to perform interracial marriage
ceremonies.
Keith Archuleta, assistant director of the Row
Office and director of the Black Community
Services Center, responded to these charges of
"over-sensitivity." He said he understood Jews'
need to feel part of a distinct group. In light of
Carter's comments, he said, students "have an ob
ligation to make things better."
A tape of last night's discussion will be sent to
Carter, who has expressed his concern through let
ters to students and telephone conversations, ac
cording to Gregg and Lyons.
