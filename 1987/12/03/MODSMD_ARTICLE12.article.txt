Soon, students and faculty may no longer
have to waste time filling out library checkout
cards. If administration support is forthcoming,
Stanford w ill get a fully automated checkout sys
tem.
The Stanford University libraries — Green,
Meyer and the branch libraries — have come out
with a set of goals for library automation over
the next five years. Foremost among these goals
is the acquisition and installation of a modern,
automated system for the checking out, return
ing and recording of books and periodicals.
For the faculty and students who use the Stan
ford libraries, as well as the staff that
administers them, such a change has been too
long in coming. The benefits of such an
automated system will be substantial. First,
automated checkout will increase the conven
ience of library use by saving time for the pa
trons. Second, it will help the libraries handle
their extensive holdings more efficiently.
Paper card-filing is obsolete and inefficient,
especially for the second-largest university li

brary in the state of California. Such a hap
hazard filing system often leads to false overdue
charges and other inconveniences.
Unfortunately, as things stand now automated
checkout will not he available at Stanford for at
least five years. It is difficult to understand this
delay. True, getting the books into machine
readable format will require a staggering number
of man hours. But five years is an unacceptably
long time to wait. In order to speed up the proc
ess, the University administration, especially
the Office of the Provost, must commit fully to
this plan. The provost should take whatever fi
nancial and administrative steps are necessary to
expedite the conversion from manual to
automated checkout.
The whole Stanford community needs such a
system. This need cuts across disciplinary
boundaries and affects people at every level of
the Stanford hierarchy, from endowed profes
sors to incoming freshmen. The libraries recog
nize the problem. They deserve full financial and
institutional support from the University in or
der to improve their services.
