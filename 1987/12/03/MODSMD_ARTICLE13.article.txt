Permit prices
should be raised
I am responding to the letter
"Finding parking is a hassle"
(Daily. Dec. 2). In the letter, the
distraught off-campus student,
while stating she did not favor
turning Stanford into a giant
parking lot. concluded, "It's
clear we definitely need more
parking." I wholeheartedly dis
agree. Having lived off campus
myself, I empathize with the
problem. However, 1 have been
to many universities across the
country, and I can confidently
state that Stanford does not lack
enough parking spaces.
The problem lies in the fact
that Stanford does not administer
its parking efficiently. What
needs to happen is that the price
of the parking passes needs to go
up.
With this system, only those
who really value (i.e. need) to
park a car will buy the expensive
parking permit. In this way,
those like the off-campus student
will find it easier to find a space
because fewer parking permits
will be sold at the higher price.
Obviously, if this off-campus stu
dent was willing to eat a one-time
$13 parking ticket just to park for
that day, she must be willing to
pay a higher price for the
privilege of parking with ease.
Let's face it, with cheap parking
permits, even those who don't
need to drive to campus will pay
the token fee for convenience.
As for building more parking
lots, I have just one question:
How much parking is needed to
meet the demand, and where is it
to be built? There isn't a whole
lot of empty space near campus.
Moreover, while parking is obvi
ously valuable to campus life,
space used for parking can be put

to much better use as academic
buildings, or more importantly,
as housing.
After all, a lack of housing was
what put the off-campus student
in her position anyway. The bot
tom line is that we need to
administer the parking we have
more effectively and not build
more lots.

Task Force has
humanist profs.
Over the years, 1 have read
French Prof. Robert Cohn's let
ters with considerable interest,
not to say fascination, and his let
ter in The Daily last week is no
exception (Daily, Nov. 24). In
it we learn that "the task force
appointed by the provost to pro
pose a radical revision of the
Area One requirement in that
subject excluded all humanists
but one." Good heavens!
Whatever was the provost think
ing of?
As 1 recall, the faculty on the
task force are as follows: Susan
Stephens (classics), John Perry
(philosophy), Clay Carson
(history), Carolyn Lougee
(history and, at the time of her
appointment to the task force,
dean of Undergraduate Studies),
Barry Katz (Values, Technology,
Society and Science) and me
(history). One might complain
that there were entirely too many
historians on the committee; in
fact, the composition would have
been different had the person the
provost had first asked to chair
the task force been able to serve.
However, I am amazed to learn
that we are not humanists (but
one, presumably Susan Step
hens, our lone classicist). In the
16th and 17th centuries, the pe

riod I know something about,
philosophy and history were both
considered humanistic studies, at
least by the humanists. In fact,
history was considered philoso
phy taught by example. Were we
read out of the guild in the inter
vening centuries?

Grads bankrolling
undergraduates
Stanford graduate students
have been subjected to the
egregious indignity of bankrolling
undergraduates for far too long.
As the veritable "cream of the
cream of the crop," we object to
the appalling use of a devious and
complicated negative check-off
system on tuition bills. Graduate
students have more than demon
strated their disdain for the
ASSU elections (Far less than 1
percent of the graduate students
voted in the last spring election
â€” despite a near $30 tax on
abstention. We dare say that
throughout known history no po
litical group has displayed such
devotion to principle.) This spon
taneous boycott highlights our
collective moral outrage at this
last vestige of injustice in the
Stanford community. Why do the
myopic shovelheads at the ASSU
allow this festering and divisive
situation to persist? The answer
eludes us.
