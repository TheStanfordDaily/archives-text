# Modern photo literacy
## 
### 
In order to he a functioning adult in this society,
one is obliged to have one's photo taken more than
a few times. Driver's license, passport, yearbook
and the inevitably mortifying meal card are a few
examples of photos we not only need to have taken
but also must carry around and present to others on
demand.
Quite a few, perhaps the majority, of people are
less than thrilled about the prospect of saying
"cheese" and holding a cheesy grin until the click
of the shutter and the flash of the bulb. As for my
personal disposition toward smiling for the camera,
a look at the charming likeness that accompanies
this column should make further comment unnec
essary.

Some people "ham it up" for the camera; many
models claim to, or are said to have a relationship
with the camera. One prominent sex syfiibol of the
1950s and '60s is said to have described being
photographed as "like screwing a thousand guys all
at once, and you can't get pregnant." Quite a rela
tionship. What seems to be clear, in any case, is
that few if any people are indifferent about
pictures, especially their own.
That old cliche that members of some primitive
societies believe the photograph contains the soul
of its subject says more about our own society than
it does about primitives ignorant of technology. We
imagine that pictures possess something more than
the visual image. We are upset and embarrassed by
an unflattering picture because we know, or at least
fear, that we are in some way evaluated according
to its merits. Somehow a photograph is supposed to
convey more than the superficial; the photo has
replaced the painted portrait, and we implicitly
assume that the camera feels and conveys feeling,
as the did the brush of the expressionist painter.
The picture is not only assumed to convey some
thing of the "soul" of its subject, but also of the cir
cumstances surrounding its subject. A picture can
attempt to sum up an event, an organization, a pe
riod of history. A famous photo of a U.S. officer
holding a gun to the head ot a pleading Vietnamese
man was, for many Americans, the visual sum of all
arguments against the Vietnam war. Today it also

represents a nation in a period of crisis. To a
pacifist, it embodies the effects of war in general.
To a Marxist, it becomes the evils of capitalist im
perialism.
The picture is, in this sense, ambiguous. One
picture may convey many "meanings;" it is the
symbol for many things, but it is inherently nothing
more than an image. What the picture commun
icates depends on what we bring to bear upon it;
the message results from the experiences of the in
dividual, not from any quality inherent in the
picture itself. The "soul" tnat the picture captures
is the "soul" of the viewer. The meaning of a pho
tograph is a fiction that we as viewers create, quite
independent of the subjects whose images are the
photo.
While the expressionist painter sought to convey
more than the photographic likeness in a portrait,
later artists endeavored to show us the limits of the
photograph. Andy Warhol's "Four Jackies" is a
particularly striking example: A photo of Jac
queline Onassis, taken at Jonn Kennedy's funeral,
is presented repeatedly in a lithograph.
The photo shows us nothing beyond the superfi
cial. We do not perceive the grief of a recent
widow; we could not distinguish this from many
other photos of Jacqueline Onassis if it had not
been imbued with deeper meaning in its original
context — the news media covering the assassina
tion of a president. In the latter context we read the
suffering of a widow into the picture; in the neutral
setting of the art gallery or museum we are forced
to see only what the picture itself conveys: an
image that superficially resembles Jacqueline
Onassis and nothing more.
The media specialists know all too well that the
ambiguous photo can be bent to "mean" a great
many things. Once the seeds of suggestion are
planted in the minds of viewers, photographs take
on "meanings" that are presented as reality. In the
1984 presidential campaign, photos of Ronald
Reagan standing at a podium with watery eyes
were of a world leader with compassion and moral
conviction on issues of importance, not of a
seasoned actor playing a well-rehearsed role. In the
1988 campaign, photos of Gary Hart and Donna
Rice are of an adulterer and his mistress. We knew
what these photos meant before we saw them; we
had been told in advance. The camera doesn't lie,
but sometimes it can be made to bend the truth.
Maybe a picture is worth 1000 words, but
whether the 1000 words enlighten or deceive
depends on our literacy in the language of the vis
ual media.

suffering of a widow into the picture; in the neutral
setting of the art gallery or museum we are forced
to see only what the picture itself conveys: an
image that superficially resembles Jacqueline
Onassis and nothing more.
The media specialists know all too well that the
ambiguous photo can be bent to "mean" a great
many things. Once the seeds of suggestion are
planted in the minds of viewers, photographs take
on "meanings" that are presented as reality. In the
1984 presidential campaign, photos of Ronald
Reagan standing at a podium with watery eyes
were of a world leader with compassion and moral
conviction on issues of importance, not of a
seasoned actor playing a well-rehearsed role. In the
1988 campaign, photos of Gary Hart and Donna
Rice are of an adulterer and his mistress. We knew
what these photos meant before we saw them; we
had been told in advance. The camera doesn't lie,
but sometimes it can be made to bend the truth.
Maybe a picture is worth 1000 words, but
whether the 1000 words enlighten or deceive
depends on our literacy in the language of the vis
ual media.

In order to he a functioning adult in this society,
one is obliged to have one's photo taken more than
a few times. Driver's license, passport, yearbook
and the inevitably mortifying meal card are a few
examples of photos we not only need to have taken
but also must carry around and present to others on
demand.
Quite a few, perhaps the majority, of people are
less than thrilled about the prospect of saying
"cheese" and holding a cheesy grin until the click
of the shutter and the flash of the bulb. As for my
personal disposition toward smiling for the camera,
a look at the charming likeness that accompanies
this column should make further comment unnec
essary.

Some people "ham it up" for the camera; many
models claim to, or are said to have a relationship
with the camera. One prominent sex syfiibol of the
1950s and '60s is said to have described being
photographed as "like screwing a thousand guys all
at once, and you can't get pregnant." Quite a rela
tionship. What seems to be clear, in any case, is
that few if any people are indifferent about
pictures, especially their own.
That old cliche that members of some primitive
societies believe the photograph contains the soul
of its subject says more about our own society than
it does about primitives ignorant of technology. We
imagine that pictures possess something more than
the visual image. We are upset and embarrassed by
an unflattering picture because we know, or at least
fear, that we are in some way evaluated according
to its merits. Somehow a photograph is supposed to
convey more than the superficial; the photo has
replaced the painted portrait, and we implicitly
assume that the camera feels and conveys feeling,
as the did the brush of the expressionist painter.
The picture is not only assumed to convey some
thing of the "soul" of its subject, but also of the cir
cumstances surrounding its subject. A picture can
attempt to sum up an event, an organization, a pe
riod of history. A famous photo of a U.S. officer
holding a gun to the head ot a pleading Vietnamese
man was, for many Americans, the visual sum of all
arguments against the Vietnam war. Today it also

represents a nation in a period of crisis. To a
pacifist, it embodies the effects of war in general.
To a Marxist, it becomes the evils of capitalist im
perialism.
The picture is, in this sense, ambiguous. One
picture may convey many "meanings;" it is the
symbol for many things, but it is inherently nothing
more than an image. What the picture commun
icates depends on what we bring to bear upon it;
the message results from the experiences of the in
dividual, not from any quality inherent in the
picture itself. The "soul" tnat the picture captures
is the "soul" of the viewer. The meaning of a pho
tograph is a fiction that we as viewers create, quite
independent of the subjects whose images are the
photo.
While the expressionist painter sought to convey
more than the photographic likeness in a portrait,
later artists endeavored to show us the limits of the
photograph. Andy Warhol's "Four Jackies" is a
particularly striking example: A photo of Jac
queline Onassis, taken at Jonn Kennedy's funeral,
is presented repeatedly in a lithograph.
The photo shows us nothing beyond the superfi
cial. We do not perceive the grief of a recent
widow; we could not distinguish this from many
other photos of Jacqueline Onassis if it had not
been imbued with deeper meaning in its original
context — the news media covering the assassina
tion of a president. In the latter context we read the
suffering of a widow into the picture; in the neutral
setting of the art gallery or museum we are forced
to see only what the picture itself conveys: an
