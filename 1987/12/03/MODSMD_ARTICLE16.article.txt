## Individuals must fight racism 
### 
There is general agreement that racism
must be stopped. However, there is little
agreement on methods.
Some propose paying attention only to a
person's merits and not to race membership
— the colorblindness doctrine. Others pro
pose affirmative action or quota legislation —
holding that in order to rectify past injustices,
disadvantaged minorities should be given a
slight edge in the hiring process.

Quota proponents often base their argu
ment on a notion of racial debt: Because
oppression of minorities has been pervasive,
society should favor minorities in compensa
tion. But should individuals in the majority
compensate for the crimes of their ancestors
or of fellow members of their race? This
seems like the kind of logic that leads to rac
ism in the first place. Second, quotas are of
ten touted as maximizing cultural diversity.
But (his equates race with culture. Consider a
non minority student from the deep South
who is rejected only because of the quota sys
tem. Is he/she necessarily less able to con
tribute to the school's diversity?
Affirmative action, another program
favored by those disagreeing with the
colorblindness doctrine, is designed to favor
the minority candidate in equal merit hiring

choices. But what about members of
minorities that do not have political represen
tation?
Discrimination is acting on the irrational
belief that arbitrary group membership
reflects on individual merit. Reverse discrim
ination is the attempt to equalize group debt;
but I have argued that this is irrational. Thus,
only the colorblindness doctrine seems to
make sense in addressing racism. So how
should law reflect colorblindness and, more
generally, blindness to anything not merit
related?

If you are in a dorm and hear
one of the fc in' minority jokes,
your silence will validate the
unspoken lie: 'We know they're
really like that; we just can't
say it openly now/ Minority
jokes propagate racism, yet
people rarely identify the joker
as a k higot.' They should.

Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning
economist, has demonstrated that non
discrimination legislation almost always

works against minorities in the long run.
Clarence Pendleton Jr., director of the
United States Civil Rights Commission, takes
a similar stand (including the notion that gov
ernment intervention causes a loss of" "moral
freedoms" and damages the economy).
Some may feel that the views presented
here identify with intolerant right-wing politi
cal views. Bigots may feel vindicated to dis
criminate without consequcnce. The opposite
is true. The point of my message is: Every in
dividual is responsible for ending discrimina
tion. It is not a task that can he delegated to
the government.
Delegating the task of fighting discrimina
tion to the government won't work. But indi
vidual intervention can. If you are in a dorm
and hear one of the"in" minority jokes, your
silence will validate the unspoken lie: "We
know they're really like that; we just can't
say it openly now." Minority jokes propagate
racism, yet people rarely identify the joker as
a "bigot." They should.
And if you are a victim of bigotry, you do
not have the luxury of lying low and hoping
that it will go away. You have to speak up.
I argue we can end discrimination without
sacrificing individual rights — this means
working together to ensure that in the mar
ketplace, individuals are valued not by their
class, race, sex, size or lineage, but by their
merit.
