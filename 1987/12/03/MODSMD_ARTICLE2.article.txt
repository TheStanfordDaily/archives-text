## Minor changes in drug-test program not a winning strategy

Legal maneuverings by the
NCAA this week — a last-ditch
effort to convince Judge Conrad
Rushing to overturn his intended
drug-testing ruling — will proba
bly backfire and cause the court
to throw out testing in football
and men s basketball.

University President Donald
Kennedy voiced doubts last
week that NCAA lawyers would
be able to design a new testing
program that would meet Rush
ing's requirements. "1 challenge
you to determine how a program
would be set up to test that would
be within the spirit of the deci

In his Nov. 19 ruling, the Santa

Clara County Superior Court
judge declared the drug-testing
program "unconstitutionally
void and overbroad" and or

to design a program that would fit

Rushing's stringent guidelines.
The organization filed a two-page
brief Monday that makes a few
minor changes in the program hut
leaves the original essentially in
tact. In addition, the NCAA filed
a second brief that is harshly cri

for a rev ersal of the decision.
Rushing had criticized the
NCAA list of over 30(H) banned
drugs for requiring that college
athletes meet international Olym
pic drug standards, for including
common over-the-counter drugs
and for failing to prove that any
drugs on the list enhance per
formance.
In response, the NCAA, in its
first brief, merely agreed to elimi
nate the phrase "and related
compounds" from its list.
