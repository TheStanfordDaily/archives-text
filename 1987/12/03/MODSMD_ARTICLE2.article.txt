# NCAA tries last-minute play
## Minor changes in drug-test program not a winning strategy

Legal maneuverings by the
NCAA this week — a last-ditch
effort to convince Judge Conrad
Rushing to overturn his intended
drug-testing ruling — will proba
bly backfire and cause the court
to throw out testing in football
and men s basketball.

News analysis

University President Donald
Kennedy voiced doubts last
week that NCAA lawyers would
be able to design a new testing
program that would meet Rush
ing's requirements. "1 challenge
you to determine how a program
would be set up to test that would
be within the spirit of the deci
sion," Kennedy said.
In his Nov. 19 ruling, the Santa

Clara County Superior Court
judge declared the drug-testing
program "unconstitutionally
void and overbroad" and or
dered the NCAA to present him
with a proposal that would justify
testing for football and men's
basketball — the only two sports
that he said appeared to show a
"compelling need" for testing.
Rushing requested, moreover,
that any proposal for a new test
ing program in those sports,
which were exempted from his
preliminary injunction, should
"carry out the spirit" of his in
tended decision. The ruling was
based broadly on the Fourth
Amendment of the U.S. Consti
tution and the right-to-privacy
clause of the California Constitu
tion.
However, the NCAA appar
ently did not consider it possible
to design a program that would fit

Rushing's stringent guidelines.
The organization filed a two-page
brief Monday that makes a few
minor changes in the program hut
leaves the original essentially in
tact. In addition, the NCAA filed
a second brief that is harshly cri
tical of Kushing's ruling and asks
for a rev ersal of the decision.
Rushing had criticized the
NCAA list of over 30(H) banned
drugs for requiring that college
athletes meet international Olym
pic drug standards, for including
common over-the-counter drugs
and for failing to prove that any
drugs on the list enhance per
formance.
In response, the NCAA, in its
first brief, merely agreed to elimi
nate the phrase "and related
compounds" from its list.
Rustling's intended ruling had
also criticized the NCAA for
neglecting to outline a coherent,
consistent appeals process for
athletes who test positive for
drugs.
In response, the NCAA said it
would "provide Stanford with a
copy of the 1987-88 Drug Testing
Program . . . and the text of any
modification in the NCAA
news."
And that was all. There was no
mention of the judge's extensive
suggestions for a program based
on educational, rather than
punitive, meaures. Nor did the
NCAA brief recognize any merit
in the judge's condemnation of
urinalysis.

Stubbornly refusing to design a
testing program that would meet
Rustling's standards, the NCAA
attempted to shoot holes in the
judge's legal reasoning in its
second brief, a 34-page attack on
the intended ruling.
In effect, the NCAA may have
sacrificed its chances of retaining
testing in football and men's bas
ketball by betting that the judge
will reconsider the substance of
his intended ruling.
It is not unheard of for a judge
to reverse an intended ruling if a
party in a case demonstrates a
sufficiently novel approach to the
evidence, but such actions are
rare.
Two arguments emerged from
the NCAA's second brief: first,
that Rushing had confused some
of the basic facts of the case; and
second, that the judge should
have applied a more relaxed stan

dard than "compelling need" in
determining the constitutionality
of the program s invasion of
privacy.
The NCAA pointed out that
senior Jennifer Hill, a women's
soccer player and co-plaintiff in
the case, had not undergone drug
testing, contrary to what the
judge stated in his intended
ruling. But University attorney
Debra Zumwalt, representing
Stanford as a third party in the
case, defused that criticism.
"What matters is what would
have happened had Hill been
tested," she said.
Indeed, Hill was not tested.
But junior Barry McKeever, a
football player and the other
plaintiff in the case, did undergo
testing before last January's
Gator Bowl; his testimony
stressed the embarrassing in
trusiveness of monitored urin

alysis.
In the brief s second argument,
the NCAA said it objected "to
the use of the 'compelling need,'
or strict scrutiny, standard as in
correct" and insisted that "the
correct legal standard under the
California Constitution is the
'rational relation standard,' or
balancing' test."
Throughout the two-week trial
in October, however, NCAA
lawyers appeared to have ac
cepted the plaintiffs' claim that
the right to privacy merited a
strict scrutiny test.
In some privacy cases the bal
ancing test is applied, but the
judge generally retains the dis
cretion to choose which test is
appropriate. Law Prof. John
Kaplan said last night, "It makes
sense that the NCAA would
press for the rational relation test
because it's the weakest."
