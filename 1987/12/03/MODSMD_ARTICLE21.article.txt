## Many students haven't been vaccinated Measles cases on the rise on college campuses

Stopping out for a quarter to
sail in the Caribbean or ski in
Colorado may sound great to stu
dents tired of Stanford's aca
demic grind.

But taking a break to recover
from measles or rubella is not on
most people's wish list.
Yet many college students
across the country are forced to
do exactly that each year.
"Measles killed some kids at
Principia (College)," said Dr.
John Dorman, associate medical

director of Cowell Student
Health Center. "They had an
epidemic at Dartmouth last year,
even in students who had been
immunized. Now Dartmouth re
quires all students to be re
immunized when they register —
but they are running scared."
There were 174 measles cases
reported on college campuses in
1986, according to data collected
by the U.S. Center for Disease
Control. In 1986, 41 percent of all
reported rubella (German
measles) cases occurred among
persons between the ages of 15
and 29.
Experts estimate that from 5 to
20 percent of college students
still do not have documented im
munity to these diseases.
There are several reasons why
large numbers of college students
don't have proper immunity, ac
cording to local health officials.
"In terms of measles and
rubella, there are a fair number of

college students who are suscep
tible and never have been vac
cinated to begin with," said Dr.
Pamela Diaz, assistant clinical
professor of Pediatric Infectious
Diseases at the Medical Center.
Diaz explained that secondary
schools are often not careful
enough in ensuring that their stu
dents have been immunized.
"No vaccine is 100-percent
preventative," she added.
"There is a very small percen
tage of vaccine failures, and
there is a population of non
vaccinated students," she said.
Experts at the Center for
Disease Control cite other
reasons for the spread of
measles. For example, because
many current students entered
college before state laws required
proof of prior immunization, a
significant number remain unim
munized.
Also, certain vaccination
practices carried out between

1963 and 1967 have been found to
have produced inadequate long
term immunity in some people.
Measles is a highly-contagious
viral infection, noted for inducing
rash, fever, cough and fatigue.
"Measles in an adult is a severe
disease," Diaz said. "It is not
rare to have complications. In
Third World countries measles is
one of the biggest killers."
Rubella is usually a harmless
disease in adults, causing only a
slight rash, mild cold and en
larged glands. There is, however,
a slight chance that more serious
complications may arise. These
can include arthritis, encephalitis
and severe illness.
Also, rubella in a pregnant
woman can be extremely harmful
to the child she carries. "Rubella
doesn't harm the person who
gets it, but that person can
expose pregnant women with dis
astrous results for the fetus,"
Dorman said.

According to the Center for
Disease Control, a recent out
break of measles at Boston Uni
versity spread to nearby Boston
College, MIT, Northeastern Uni
versity and — officials believe —
Villanova University outside of
Philadelphia. "During the epi
demic at Boston University the
media showed pictures of hockey
games," Dorman said. "Some
stands were empty because [the
University] didn't want large
groups of students together in tne
same place."
The American College Health
Association adopted a policy in
1983 recommending that all col
leges and universities require stu
dents to present documentation
of immunity prior to registration.
Stanford requires each enter
ing student to present verifica
tion of vaccination for or immu
nity to measles and rubella within
the six months prior to registra
tion. The student is given a three

month grace period during his or
her first quarter in which to fulfill
this requirement.
If a student hasn't presented
proof of either immunity or im
munization by the end of the first
quarter, the University will place
a hold on his or her registration,
said John Mendoza, an office su
pervisor at Cowell.
"We were one of the leaders in
these requirements," Dorman
said. "At the time of the Prin
cipia College deaths, we already
had our requirements in place."
Center for Disease Control fig
ures show that other colleges
have not been as rigorous as
Stanford in setting and enforcing
disease-control standards.
"Stanford may be very good
about it; other schools may not
be," Diaz said. "If 95 percent of
the people are vaccinated, and
the other 5 percent are not, we'll
get quite a few people getting
[measles]," Diaz said.
