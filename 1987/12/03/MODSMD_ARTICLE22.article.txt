# Revival magazine Glosses over the literary spectrum
## 
### Cheryl Schneider Ann Marsh 
A revival of the late 1970s is occurring on this
campus.
No, it's not the Bee Gees, nor is it disco.
Glosses, the undergraduate journal for Stan
ford's literary-minded is returning from a 10-
year hiatus.
The journal 's title refers to a quote from James
Joyce: "Wipe your glosses with what you
know."
The publication will include original works of
literary criticism, poetry, fiction and plays.
Sarah Lau, a senior majoring in English and
creative writing, and Matthew Bruck, a senior in
English, began an effort to revive Glosses earlier
this year. Lau and Bruck, who are also co
presidents of the undergraduate literary society
READ (Revitalized English Association with Di
rection), said they and other READ members
saw a need for a student publication devoted to
printing literary criticism.
Lau said she came upon the idea of establish
ing a journal for critical works by students when
she realized that "many of these papers (from
classes) never see the light of day."
As a result, one of the major goals of the jour

nal will be to showcase undergraduate papers of
quality that would otherwise only be read by the
grading professor or by a teaching assistant, Lau
said.
The motivation to revive Glosses, now a sepa
rate entity from READ, "kind of sprung up
among English majors,' Bruck said.
"We want to make it an interdisciplinary jour
nal," Lau added, explaining that Glosses editors
will consider literary submissions from all aca
demic departments, including poems and crea
tive works written in languages other than Eng
lish.
Unlike Dialtone, another student-run literary
publication, the revived Glosses will seek a more
academic image, Lau said.
"We see [Dialtone] as being more of a com
mercial enterprise," Lau said, explaining that
Dialtone features mostly short fiction, poetry
and often photographs. "We want to be very
selective in choosing creative writing especially.
"Our format is very different. Whereas
Dialtone is published on newsprint and distrib
uted in bulk, we want to be more like Sequoia,
the Stanford literary magazine," Lau said.
While Sequoia is trying to
become "nationally based" and
thus accepts submissions from all
over the country, Lau said
Glosses will be a forum exclu
sively for undergraduate writers.
The journal will be funded in
part by the ASSU Publications
Board, as well as by various aca
demic departments. Contributing
departments so far include the
Creative Writing Department,
the Comparative Literature De
partment and the Modern
Thought and Literature Depart
ment.
To create an enduring base for
the publication, Lau said she is
working with English Depart
ment Chair Albert Gelpi to form
an undergraduate seminar in
which students who work on
Glosses will receive two units of
credit. The seminar would also
be a literary criticism class and
would host visiting speakers.
Future plans for the journal

may also include publishing ex
cerpts from undergraduate
honors ttheses and devoting
entire issues to specific central
themes.
Although Lau said the first
issue of the journal will contain
one of hur own works, she
stressed that Glosses editors will
generally avoid publishing their
own writing.

Unlike Dialtone,
Glosses will seek a
more academic image

"We want to demonstrate that
there's outside interest and that
we don't have to rely on our
selves (to fill Glosses)," Bruck
said. . ,
"If we put our own names in it,
it's going to look like a closed
group â€” which it isn't. Every
one's welcome," he added.
According to Lau, submissions
for the winter issue will be ac
cepted in the Glosses box in
Building 40 until Dec. 8.
