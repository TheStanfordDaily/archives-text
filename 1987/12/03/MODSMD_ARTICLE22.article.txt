# Revival magazine Glosses over the literary spectrum
## 
### Cheryl Schneider Ann Marsh 
A revival of the late 1970s is occurring on this
campus.
No, it's not the Bee Gees, nor is it disco.
Glosses, the undergraduate journal for Stan
ford's literary-minded is returning from a 10-
year hiatus.
The journal 's title refers to a quote from James
Joyce: "Wipe your glosses with what you
know."
The publication will include original works of
literary criticism, poetry, fiction and plays.
Sarah Lau, a senior majoring in English and
creative writing, and Matthew Bruck, a senior in
English, began an effort to revive Glosses earlier
this year. Lau and Bruck, who are also co
presidents of the undergraduate literary society
READ (Revitalized English Association with Di
rection), said they and other READ members
saw a need for a student publication devoted to
printing literary criticism.
Lau said she came upon the idea of establish
ing a journal for critical works by students when
she realized that "many of these papers (from
classes) never see the light of day."
As a result, one of the major goals of the jour

nal will be to showcase undergraduate papers of
quality that would otherwise only be read by the
grading professor or by a teaching assistant, Lau
said.
The motivation to revive Glosses, now a sepa
rate entity from READ, "kind of sprung up
among English majors,' Bruck said.
"We want to make it an interdisciplinary jour
nal," Lau added, explaining that Glosses editors
will consider literary submissions from all aca
demic departments, including poems and crea
tive works written in languages other than Eng
lish.
Unlike Dialtone, another student-run literary
publication, the revived Glosses will seek a more
academic image, Lau said.
"We see [Dialtone] as being more of a com
mercial enterprise," Lau said, explaining that
Dialtone features mostly short fiction, poetry
and often photographs. "We want to be very
selective in choosing creative writing especially.
"Our format is very different. Whereas
Dialtone is published on newsprint and distrib
uted in bulk, we want to be more like Sequoia,
the Stanford literary magazine," Lau said.
