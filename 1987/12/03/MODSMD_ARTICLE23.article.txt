## Discover the elegant escape of tea dancing 
### Myriam B. Perez 
Have you grown tired of danc
ing to top-40 hits? Are the
crowded beer bashes on campus
becoming passe? Have you al
ready seen all of the good
movies? Don't despair if you are
in a rut. An evening of tea danc
ing in San Francisco might just
be the change of pace you're
looking for.
Although tea dancing implies a
staid, prim-and-proper type of
waltzing, the name is actually a
misnomer. Tea dancing, also
known as swing dancing, is a
jazzy, upbeat form of dance from
the 1940s Big Band Era that
combines the fun of fast dancing
with the romantic nostalgia of
ballroom dancing.
The Hyatt Regency Hotel in
San Francisco has Big Band
dancing every Friday evening
from 5:30-8:30 p.m. The Hyatt
offers an amusing environment
that features a live band, glass
elevator rides, indoor water
fountains and a bizarre wire
sculpture that vibrates to the beat
of the music.
Another tea dancing program
will resume in the spring at the
Garden Court Hotel in Palo Alto.
Surprisingly, t'here appears to
still be quite a large audience for
the distinctive sounds of Glenn
Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Chick
Webb and dozens of other bands
that were once thought to be
gone forever.
Not only is tea dancing making
a strong comeback, but on any
given Friday night you find that
the people fox-trotting on the
dance floor range from students
to out-of-town businesspeople to
die-hard swing fans from the
"40s.

"One of the reasons that I
think tea dancing is becoming
more popular among Stanford
students is because more people
want to return to the concept of
'touch dancing/ where there is
more interaction between the
couple, instead of the impersonal
modern style of dancing at an
other person," said senior Steve
Schloss, an American studies
major and an avid swing dancer.
In fact, quite a few dorms,
sororities and student organiza
tions have adopted tea dancing as
a group activity.
Mimi Coughlin, a senior and a
resident assistant in Twain, said
she thinks that besides being
"good, clean fun," tea dancing is
a good outing because it gives
people a reason to get dressed
up, get off campus and go into
the City.
"The concierge at the Hyatt
Hotel is more than happy to help
make dinner reservations for
your group and give you helpful
information about San Fran
cisco, so planning the event for a
large group like a dorm is really
easy," Coughlin said.
Some groups find it helpful to
learn and practice a few of the
basic steps before actually taking
to the dance floor.
My dorm. Twain, arranged for
Schloss and his dance partner
Suzanne Meier, a senior, to teach
us a few steps before our tea
dancing excursion. To our
surprise, we were swinging and
twirling our partners to Tommy
Dorsey tunes within a half hour.
Even though routines vary in
degrees of intricacy, with a little
bit of practice it is not hard to
master them. Schloss, Coughlin
and Meier, along with junior
Doug Gray, give informal lessons

to groups on campus.
But if you really want a change
from your tedious weekly routine
and to meet some new people in
the process, then it might be a
good idea to enroll in Colin and
Yvonne Hester's ballroom dance
class next quarter.
Not only will you learn several
variations of ballroom dancing,
such as the samba, the cha-cha.

the rumlja and the fox-trot, but
you won't have to go all the way
to the Hyatt in San Francisco in
search of fun.
"Besides," Yvonne Hester
said, "you can't dance if you
don't know the basics. Our
classes for beginners start
slowly, so that we work our way
up to the harder steps."
Hester and her husband will

begin their 16th year as ballroom
dance instructors next month.
Their evening classes are offered
through STARTS and are held in
the ballroom of Old Union.
Interested students should
look for informational flyers,
which will be posted after
Christmas break. The eight-week
course costs about $20 per per
son.

Whether you take formal ball
room dance lessons to learn the
basic steps or you just want to
"wing it," tea dancing at the
Hyatt is not difficult to do, and it
could prove to be an exciting al
ternative to the usual dance
clubs. Admission is free, so even
if dancing is not your forte, you
may still want to go watch the
people and enjoy the live band.
