## Cagers' loss in a nutshell 
### 
The top 10 reasons the Santa Clara Broncos
defeated the Stanford Cardinal Tuesday night,
72-71 (compiled in the Daily home office by
Buck Montana).
10. Santa Clara senior center Dan Weiss's
confidence. Weiss sank two free throws with
two seconds left, and from the look in his eye the
only place he wanted to be in the world was on
that line with the chance to win it.
9. Fatigue. The Stanford players were playing
their fourth game in five days. The excitement of
a home opener wasn't enough to energize the
Cardinal.

8. The new Stanford cheerleaders. Think of
these folks as an appendix â€” they're certainly
unnecessary. But we can blame them for all
sorts of ailments, like losing.
7. Stanford substitute point guard Scott
Meinert couldn't sink a three-point shot in the
second half. Meinert was able to give junior
starter Terry Taylor a good long rest, but he
didn't contribute any points to the scoreboard.
Taylor's three-pointers are a key to the Stanford
offense, and Meinert's presence thus needs to be
positive, rather than just a stopgap measure.
6. Cardinal junior forward Bryan McSweeney
is still looking to pass rather than shoot. On a
fast break near the end of the contest
McSweeney tried to make a finesse pass to
teammate Greg Butler instead of taking an open
eight-foot jump shot. The pass went out of
bounds. Go to the hole, Bryan.
5. Bronco players repeatedly penetrated into
the paint. When the offense gets the ball in there,
