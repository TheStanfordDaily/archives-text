## Cagers' loss in a nutshell 
### 
The top 10 reasons the Santa Clara Broncos
defeated the Stanford Cardinal Tuesday night,
72-71 (compiled in the Daily home office by
Buck Montana).
10. Santa Clara senior center Dan Weiss's
confidence. Weiss sank two free throws with
two seconds left, and from the look in his eye the
only place he wanted to be in the world was on
that line with the chance to win it.
9. Fatigue. The Stanford players were playing
their fourth game in five days. The excitement of
a home opener wasn't enough to energize the
Cardinal.

8. The new Stanford cheerleaders. Think of
these folks as an appendix — they're certainly
unnecessary. But we can blame them for all
sorts of ailments, like losing.
7. Stanford substitute point guard Scott
Meinert couldn't sink a three-point shot in the
second half. Meinert was able to give junior
starter Terry Taylor a good long rest, but he
didn't contribute any points to the scoreboard.
Taylor's three-pointers are a key to the Stanford
offense, and Meinert's presence thus needs to be
positive, rather than just a stopgap measure.
6. Cardinal junior forward Bryan McSweeney
is still looking to pass rather than shoot. On a
fast break near the end of the contest
McSweeney tried to make a finesse pass to
teammate Greg Butler instead of taking an open
eight-foot jump shot. The pass went out of
bounds. Go to the hole, Bryan.
5. Bronco players repeatedly penetrated into
the paint. When the offense gets the ball in there,

not much good can happen to the
defense. And with the likes of
UCLA's Pooh Richardson and
Arizona's Sean Elliot looming on
the Cardinal schedule, penetra
tion could be a problem.
4. Stanford junior forward
Howard Wright got a little out of
control trying to block shots.
When the Broncos came in close,
Wright went hunting for the big
swats. A blocked shot is cer
tainly exciting, but when Wright
missed, his momentum carried
him out of position for the
rebound. Wright is arguably
Stanford's best rebounder — so
it's not good to see him watching
the fight for the rebound from the
three-point line.
3. As Cardinal Head Coach
Mike Montgomery said, "Santa
Clara wanted it worse than we
did." Why? Stanford, possibly a
team on the rise, was hosting an

NCAA tournament team from
last season, a team the Cardinal
might be competing with for a
berth this year, and a possible lo
cal rival. Sounds like motivation
enough.
2. The Maples Pavilion crowd
is improved but could still be bet
ter. Jumping on the floor to dis
rupt free throws may be a unique
tactic, but it doesn't compare to
the distraction of waving arms
behind the basket. Why don't
Stanford students sit behind the
hoop the visiting team uses in the
second half?
1. The Stanford timer was not
a "homer." Butler scored a win
ning basket a uuarter-of-a-second
after the final buzzer sounded.
When it's that close, the home
team should somehow win.
