# Spikers begin NCAA tourney
## Cardinal hosts No. 17 Oregon 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Here we go again.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team is off and running again
in the NCAA playoffs as Oregon
comes to town tonight. The
match is at 7:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
A Cardinal victory would send
Stanford to the West regional
tournament, which would be held
here next Friday and Saturday
nights.
In the six years the NCAA vol
leyball playoffs have been in ex
istence, the Cardinal has quali
fied every year, posting a fifth
place finish, a fourth, two thirds
and two seconds.
Several Cardinal players yes
terday received postseason
honors from the Pacific 10 Con
ference. Don Shaw was named
Coach of the Year, and senior
setter Wendi Rush was named
Player of the Year. Joining Rush
on the Pac-10 first team are her
two classmates, middle blocker
Nancy Reno and outside hitter
Teresa Smith.
The 5-foot-10 Rush has been
attracting attention ever since
her high school days at Rim of
the World High in Lake Ar
rowhead. There she was a three
time California 11-A Player of the
Year and led her team to three
straight 11 - A titles. She came to
Stanford regarded as the top prep
player in the country and has dis
appointed no one.

Rush has been named an All-
American each of the three previ
ous years and was a member of
last year's first-team All-Pac-10
team. She is second in the con
ference in assists and fifth in
digs, and she holds every Stan
ford assist record.
"1 was surprised," she said,
adding that the selections "show
how well our team has played."
She also thanked her teammates
for their assistance all year,
saying the squad "has certainly
made my job easier."
Reno, a 5-11 native of Glen El
lyn, 111., has made her last year
on the Farm her best. Reno was a
second-team All-Pac-10 pick last
year and came on even stronger
in 1987. She is fifth in the league
in kills average and eighth in
blocks. Like teammates Rush,
Smith and junior Amy Hayes,
Reno was also a Pac-10 Player of
the Week once this year.
Smith, at 6 feet, has also
shown tremendous improvement
while at Stanford. The native of
Playa Del Rey blossomed into a
college star last season and was
named 1986 Pac-10 Player of the
Year and a first-team Ail-
American. This year, despite
being targeted for extra attention
by most of Stanford's opponents,
she is fourth in the league in kills
average and 10th in hitting per
centage.
Shaw, in his fourth year as
head coach, has posted a 97-24
record (.802 winning percentage)

and has seen his squad reach the
Final Four each year. He
coached jointly with Fred Sturm
in 1984 and 1985 before taking
full control last season, guiding
the team to a 24-10 record. The
then-1 Ith-ranked Cardinal upset
No. I BYU in Provo, Utah, at
the West regional last year before
finally bowing out of the tourna
ment in the national semifinals.
While the awards show how
strong the Cardinal team is this
year, they say the same thing
about the 17th-ranked Oregon
Ducks. Both Teri Kramer, an
outside hitter, and Lauri Krejcha
were named to the AII-Pac-10
team for Oregon (17-10). Kra
mer, a senior, leads the team in
kills, aces and digs, and Krejcha,
a junior middle blocker, leads the
team in hitting percentage and
leads the nation in blocks.
The Ducks also have Michele
Krebsbach, the Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year last year, and Stepha

nie Snyder, who led the nation in
assists last season.
"They're a good team," Shaw
said of the visiting Ducks.
"Krejcha and Kramer are really
good players . . . (and) if
JKrebsbach is] healthy, she's
going to be a factor."
Rush concurred, saying, "We
need to play well to win."
"They're going to be ready to
play well against us," Smith said.
"She's one of their great
players," Smith said of Kramer.
"She has the ability to turn the
match around. It could be the last
college match of her career."
"We're excited for playoffs,"
Smith said. "This is my last shot
at it, and I'm just going to go for
it. I just have this mindset that
I'm going to go all-out for the
next three weeks," she said.
"I think we have a lot of talent,
comparable to my freshman year
(when the team was edged by
UCLA in the national champion
ship match)," Smith added.
"One big diffence is that we're a
lot closer as a team. That makes
a big difference — all the differ
ence in the world."

"We're excited for playoffs,"
Smith said. "This is my last shot
at it, and I'm just going to go for
it. I just have this mindset that
I'm going to go all-out for the
next three weeks," she said.
"I think we have a lot of talent,
comparable to my freshman year
(when the team was edged by
UCLA in the national champion
ship match)," Smith added.
"One big diffence is that we're a
lot closer as a team. That makes
a big difference — all the differ
ence in the world."
Here we go again.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team is off and running again
in the NCAA playoffs as Oregon
comes to town tonight. The
match is at 7:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
A Cardinal victory would send
Stanford to the West regional
tournament, which would be held
here next Friday and Saturday
nights.
In the six years the NCAA vol
leyball playoffs have been in ex
istence, the Cardinal has quali
fied every year, posting a fifth
place finish, a fourth, two thirds
and two seconds.
Several Cardinal players yes
terday received postseason
honors from the Pacific 10 Con
ference. Don Shaw was named
Coach of the Year, and senior
setter Wendi Rush was named
Player of the Year. Joining Rush
on the Pac-10 first team are her
two classmates, middle blocker
Nancy Reno and outside hitter
Teresa Smith.
The 5-foot-10 Rush has been
attracting attention ever since
her high school days at Rim of
the World High in Lake Ar
rowhead. There she was a three
time California 11-A Player of the
Year and led her team to three
straight 11 - A titles. She came to
Stanford regarded as the top prep
player in the country and has dis
appointed no one.

Rush has been named an All-
American each of the three previ
ous years and was a member of
last year's first-team All-Pac-10
team. She is second in the con
ference in assists and fifth in
digs, and she holds every Stan
ford assist record.
"1 was surprised," she said,
adding that the selections "show
how well our team has played."
She also thanked her teammates
for their assistance all year,
saying the squad "has certainly
made my job easier."
Reno, a 5-11 native of Glen El
lyn, 111., has made her last year
on the Farm her best. Reno was a
second-team All-Pac-10 pick last
year and came on even stronger
in 1987. She is fifth in the league
in kills average and eighth in
blocks. Like teammates Rush,
Smith and junior Amy Hayes,
Reno was also a Pac-10 Player of
the Week once this year.
Smith, at 6 feet, has also
shown tremendous improvement
while at Stanford. The native of
Playa Del Rey blossomed into a
college star last season and was
named 1986 Pac-10 Player of the
Year and a first-team Ail-
American. This year, despite
being targeted for extra attention
by most of Stanford's opponents,
she is fourth in the league in kills
average and 10th in hitting per
centage.
Shaw, in his fourth year as
head coach, has posted a 97-24
record (.802 winning percentage)

and has seen his squad reach the
Final Four each year. He
coached jointly with Fred Sturm
in 1984 and 1985 before taking
full control last season, guiding
the team to a 24-10 record. The
then-1 Ith-ranked Cardinal upset
No. I BYU in Provo, Utah, at
the West regional last year before
finally bowing out of the tourna
ment in the national semifinals.
While the awards show how
strong the Cardinal team is this
year, they say the same thing
about the 17th-ranked Oregon
Ducks. Both Teri Kramer, an
outside hitter, and Lauri Krejcha
were named to the AII-Pac-10
team for Oregon (17-10). Kra
mer, a senior, leads the team in
kills, aces and digs, and Krejcha,
a junior middle blocker, leads the
team in hitting percentage and
leads the nation in blocks.
The Ducks also have Michele
Krebsbach, the Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year last year, and Stepha

nie Snyder, who led the nation in
assists last season.
"They're a good team," Shaw
said of the visiting Ducks.
"Krejcha and Kramer are really
good players . . . (and) if
JKrebsbach is] healthy, she's
going to be a factor."
Rush concurred, saying, "We
need to play well to win."
"They're going to be ready to
play well against us," Smith said.
"She's one of their great
players," Smith said of Kramer.
"She has the ability to turn the
match around. It could be the last
college match of her career."
"We're excited for playoffs,"
Smith said. "This is my last shot
at it, and I'm just going to go for
it. I just have this mindset that
I'm going to go all-out for the
