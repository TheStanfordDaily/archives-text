Coming from behind, the Stan
ford wrestling team recorded vic
tories in the upper weights to
defeat San Francisco State last
night by a score of 28-15.
Senior tri-captain Terry Mc
lntyre (190-pound class) and
freshmen Loren Vigil (126) and
Steve Buddie (167) each brought
home falls to lead Stanford to
victory.
Buddie, who is undefeated
with a 4-0 record so far this
season, has won every match by
a fall (a pin) or a technical fall (in
which one wrestler gains a 15-
point-lead). Dubbed the "fresh
man sensation" by some of his
teammates, Buddie rolled San
Francisco State s Esteban Bur
chard onto his back 2:39 into the
match to claim the fall.
Mclntyre, now 3-2 on the
season, ran the score of his
match up to the limit for a techni

cal fall, then turned and pinned
freshman John Whitaker 2:30
into the first round. If he had in
creased the point margin to the
technical limit, Mclntyre would
have only earned five team
points instead of the six points
that are awarded for a regular
fall.
Vigil, recording his second pin
of the season, pummeled fresh
man Tony Valli before putting
him into a "fireman's carry" and
taking him to the mat.
"It just felt right â€” 1 hit it,"
Vigil said.
In the lowest weight bracket,
118 pounds, Stanford freshman
Matt Paradise lost by technical
fall to junior Eric Botehlo.
Paradise was wrestling in his first
match of the season, having been
held out of competition so far by
Coach Chris Horpel. Paradise is
small, even for his bracket, but
Horpel considered Botehlo's size

Cardinal sophomore Josh Lisle (right) suffered a 7-3 loss to San Fran
cisco State's Nathaniel Medrano in the 134-pound class.
and let Paradise make his debut.
Although he lost by technical
fall, Stanford gave up only five
team points rather than the six
points awarded when the weight
is forfeited.
At 158 pounds, sophomore
Steve Yarbrough kept his own
winning streak alive. Yarbrough,
now 4-0 on the season, defeated
Raul Rodriguez 5-0 to pull Stan
ford ahead by a meet score of 12-
11.
From then on it was all Cardi
nal until freshman Dave Nahama
stepped onto the mat to compete
in tne heavyweight bracket.
Nahama lost to 230-pound Alex
Koehl, 15-4.
Sophomore Trent Smith, who
held the heavyweight position
earlier in the season until an in
jury to his ribs put him out of
commission, was waiting on the
sidelines to compete if the meet
score had been closer.
