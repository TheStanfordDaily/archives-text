# Stanford sailors struggle

### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
Most people in the Chicago area celebrated
Thanksgiving under cloudy skies, but four Stanford
sailors who went to the Midwest for the Timme
Angsten Memorial regatta last weekend had an es
pecially bleak stay.
Plagued by bad fortune and inconsistent sailing,
the four seniors who spent their break in the Windy
City finished a disappointing lOth in an 18-boat
fleet at the national regatta.
Defending champion Tulane returned from the
South to show its skills again this year, taking the
overall victory by an impressive 45 points. Navy
finished next in the overall standings, edging out
teams from Harvard, Washington and Wisconsin.
Sailors from across the country met un
seasonably warm temperatures at the regatta,
which in the past has featured raging blizzards. The
worst this year's event had to offer were intermit
tent showers and temperatures in the low 40s.
Winds ranged from moderate breezes Friday to
light zephyrs Sunday, the final day of racing.
The competition was stiff at all wind levels as the
nation's best sailors fought it out in the protected
waters of the Chicago Yacht Club's harbor.

Stanford found the competition intimidating,
despite having scored an impressive fifth-place
finish at last year's regatta. Although it has had
several streaks of top finishes this fall season, the
Cardinal's sailors couldn't escape bad luck and a
lukewarm performance.
In the A division, seniors Doug Hagan and Gina
Ottoboni had difficulties all weekend long, as a se
ries of bad starts and disqualifications left them
near the rear of the pack right from the start. Even
when the pair started off well, they tended to fall
victim to changes in the wind or fouls by other
competitors.
"I've never seen anyone have so much bad luck
for three days in a row," Stanford Coach Blake
Middleton said.
In the B division, seniors Drew Gashler and
Courtney Biggert fared a bit better, ending up fifth
in their division. The two looked particularly im
pressive during Saturday's racing, when they
scored one first- and three second-place finishes.
"They rarely finished outside of the top half this
weekend," Middleton said. "They had some bad
luck, but generally they weren't as cursed as their
teammates. They had some really good races.
"It's too bad that all four had so much difficulty.
They really had the potential to finish in the top
few, but they just didn't."
