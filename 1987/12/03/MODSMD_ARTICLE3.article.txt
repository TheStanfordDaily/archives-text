## 
### Bobby Schrader Senior staff writer 
The Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies yesterday unani
mously approved a slightly
modified version of the Western
Culture Task Force's final pro
posal, according to CUS Chair
Craig Heller.
The CUS decision marks a cul
mination of over a year of
painstaking work aimed at revis
ing the University's Area One, or
Western Culture, requirement.
The proposal, in its now
finalized form, will next be voted
on by the Faculty Senate Jan. 21.
"We have shaped legislation
that we feel will pass the sen
ate,'' said Heller, who is also a
professor of human biology.
"The committee considered all
the information we have heard
from both the faculty and student
body. . . . The purpose of our ef
fort was to be responsive to valid

concerns that have been voiced
by the community as well as to
preserve the objectives of the
Area One Task Force."
CUS member Ralph Cohen,
professor of mathematics, noted
the changes affected in the West
ern Culture Task Force proposal
were mainly structural and not
substantive. "We made no signif
icant alterations to the legislative
aspects of the (task force)
report," Cohen said.
The CUS did make two
changes in the document,
however, separating the phil
osophical statement of purpose
— the preamble — from the
legislative part of the proposal
and adding more explicit
guidelines about including an im
aginative literature component in
the Western Culture require
ment.
Cohen said the CUS decision
to separate the preamble from
the legislative section of the task

force report is a way to reduce
the Faculty Senate vote purely to
a decision on the substance of the
proposal without tying it down to
the controversial views ex
pressed in the preamble. Al
though Cohen acknowleged that
