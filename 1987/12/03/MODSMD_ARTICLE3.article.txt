# W. Culture proposal earns panel approval
## 
### Bobby Schrader Senior staff writer 
The Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies yesterday unani
mously approved a slightly
modified version of the Western
Culture Task Force's final pro
posal, according to CUS Chair
Craig Heller.
The CUS decision marks a cul
mination of over a year of
painstaking work aimed at revis
ing the University's Area One, or
Western Culture, requirement.
The proposal, in its now
finalized form, will next be voted
on by the Faculty Senate Jan. 21.
"We have shaped legislation
that we feel will pass the sen
ate,'' said Heller, who is also a
professor of human biology.
"The committee considered all
the information we have heard
from both the faculty and student
body. . . . The purpose of our ef
fort was to be responsive to valid

concerns that have been voiced
by the community as well as to
preserve the objectives of the
Area One Task Force."
CUS member Ralph Cohen,
professor of mathematics, noted
the changes affected in the West
ern Culture Task Force proposal
were mainly structural and not
substantive. "We made no signif
icant alterations to the legislative
aspects of the (task force)
report," Cohen said.
The CUS did make two
changes in the document,
however, separating the phil
osophical statement of purpose
— the preamble — from the
legislative part of the proposal
and adding more explicit
guidelines about including an im
aginative literature component in
the Western Culture require
ment.
Cohen said the CUS decision
to separate the preamble from
the legislative section of the task

force report is a way to reduce
the Faculty Senate vote purely to
a decision on the substance of the
proposal without tying it down to
the controversial views ex
pressed in the preamble. Al
though Cohen acknowleged that


Craig Heller
"not everybody agrees with the
rationale of the preamble," he
downplayed the political motives
for the separation.
Cohen explained the division
as being "a matter of what makes
good sense for (Faculty Senate)
legislation and what doesn't. The
preamble was more or less a his
tory of the discussion (of the
Western Culture debate) . . . and
a piece of legislation should
describe the program. The his
tory of how the program came to
be should not be part of the legis
lation."
Mounting criticism of the cur
rent Western Culture program
prompted the CUS last fall to
recommend the establishment of

a special task force to consider
the problems of the requirement
to Provost James Rosse.
The task force, formed by the
Faculty Senate in October 1986,
initiated an exhaustive process of
revising the requirement and en
couraging debate about whether
the contributions of minorities
and women should be a more
substantial part of the program.
The debate grew last spring
when the Rainbow Agenda, a co
alition of ethnic minority groups,
demanded that the University
eliminate the "white, male,
eurocentric bias" from its West
ern Culture program.
In October the task force
issued a proposal for changing
the Western Culture program. In
essence, the task force report
called for three reforms to the
Western Culture requirement:
the study of at least one non-

Western culture in all tracks, the
abolition of the core reading list
and a substantial increase in the
representation of works by
women and minorities.
The Black Student Union
criticized the task force findings,
saying they did not go far enough
and lacked sufficiently "strong
language."
In response, the BSU drafted
an amendment to the findings
calling for increased recruitment
of minority faculty to teach in the
changed Western Culture pro
gram.
The task force adopted the
amendment and sent its modified
proposal to the CUS. After
making a few minor revisions,
the CUS sent the report back to
the task force. The task force
submitted a final version of its
report to the CUS two weeks
ago.

that we feel will pass the sen
ate,'' said Heller, who is also a
professor of human biology.
"The committee considered all
the information we have heard
from both the faculty and student
body. . . . The purpose of our ef
fort was to be responsive to valid

concerns that have been voiced
by the community as well as to
preserve the objectives of the
Area One Task Force."
CUS member Ralph Cohen,
professor of mathematics, noted
the changes affected in the West
ern Culture Task Force proposal
were mainly structural and not
substantive. "We made no signif
icant alterations to the legislative
aspects of the (task force)
report," Cohen said.
The CUS did make two
changes in the document,
however, separating the phil
osophical statement of purpose
— the preamble — from the
legislative part of the proposal
and adding more explicit
guidelines about including an im
aginative literature component in
the Western Culture require
ment.
Cohen said the CUS decision
to separate the preamble from
the legislative section of the task

force report is a way to reduce
the Faculty Senate vote purely to
a decision on the substance of the
proposal without tying it down to
the controversial views ex
pressed in the preamble. Al
though Cohen acknowleged that


Craig Heller
"not everybody agrees with the
rationale of the preamble," he
downplayed the political motives
for the separation.
Cohen explained the division
as being "a matter of what makes
good sense for (Faculty Senate)
legislation and what doesn't. The
preamble was more or less a his
tory of the discussion (of the
Western Culture debate) . . . and
a piece of legislation should
describe the program. The his
tory of how the program came to
be should not be part of the legis
lation."
Mounting criticism of the cur
rent Western Culture program
prompted the CUS last fall to
recommend the establishment of

a special task force to consider
the problems of the requirement
to Provost James Rosse.
The task force, formed by the
Faculty Senate in October 1986,
initiated an exhaustive process of
revising the requirement and en
couraging debate about whether
the contributions of minorities
and women should be a more
substantial part of the program.
The debate grew last spring
when the Rainbow Agenda, a co
alition of ethnic minority groups,
demanded that the University
eliminate the "white, male,
eurocentric bias" from its West
ern Culture program.
In October the task force
issued a proposal for changing
the Western Culture program. In
essence, the task force report
called for three reforms to the
Western Culture requirement:
the study of at least one non-

Western culture in all tracks, the
abolition of the core reading list
and a substantial increase in the
representation of works by
women and minorities.
The Black Student Union
criticized the task force findings,
saying they did not go far enough
and lacked sufficiently "strong
language."
In response, the BSU drafted
an amendment to the findings
calling for increased recruitment
of minority faculty to teach in the
changed Western Culture pro
gram.
The task force adopted the
amendment and sent its modified
proposal to the CUS. After
making a few minor revisions,
the CUS sent the report back to
the task force. The task force
submitted a final version of its
report to the CUS two weeks
ago.
