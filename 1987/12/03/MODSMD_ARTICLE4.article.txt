# Pentagon research grants not limited by Senate bill

Stanford researchers expressed relief yesterday
that a defense appropriations bill passed Tuesday
by a U.S. Senate appropriations subcommittee
does not place a limit on defense-related research
funds to individual states.
Researchers at Stanford, IJC-Berkeley and other
California state schools have been worried that re
search funding might be cut because of a bill ap
proved last month by a U.S. House subcommittee
calling for a cap on the share of money available to
each state from the Pentagon's University Re
search Initiative program (URI).
URI is a program established last year to fund
defense-related research of airplane and submarine
design.
"I'm delighted with the Senate bill," said Engi
neering Prof. William Reynolds, who is involved in
two projects that could be affected by the bill.
The House version of the bill would limit the
amount of money any one state can receive from
the program to 14 percent. Stanford and other Cali
fornia universities opposed the bill because Califor
nia research projects received 22 percent of
available URI funds last year. In addition, the
House bill proposes an overall cut in URI funding
to $X 0 million from $105 million, which would fur
ther limit California URI research projects.

The Senate bill, however, would increase the
amount of URI funding to $92.7 million and would
remove the limit on funding to individual states.
Larry Horton. University associate vice presi
dent for Public Affairs, said he expects both the
House and the Senate to pass their respective ver
sions of the defense appropriations bill; then the
issue will be resolved in a joint House-Senate com
mittee, he said.
Stanford has a special interest in the matter be
cause the URI this year gave the University
roughly $5.7 million to fund three major research
projects here.
A study of supersonic combustion by mechanical
engineering and aeronautics professors and stu
dents here and at the California Institute of Tech
nology received about $1 million in URI funds this
year. A Stanford project on air movement through
jet engines and around airplanes also received $1
million. The remaining $3.7 million went to a third
project in electrical engineering.
Horton said the Senate bill was significant be
cause if it had also proposed a cap. "the issue of
funding would be over."
He said that since the URI program was only a
small item in the defense budget, if both the House
and the Senate had proposed limiting appropria-
