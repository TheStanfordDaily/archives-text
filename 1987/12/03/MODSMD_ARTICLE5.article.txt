# Why so little vacation time for Holidays?
## 
### Vivian Rogers Staff writer 
Have you made plans for Christmas break yet?
Maybe you've decided to spend the first week with
your family, the second week on the ski slopes and
the third week with your friends?
Not so fast.
While your friends at other colleges enjoy three
or more weeks off during winter break, you will
only get two this year.
According to the registrar's office, two-week
breaks only occur about twice a decade â€” deter
mined by a calendar set years in advance. Winter
vacations will gradually become longer over the
next few years.
Vacation time in 1991, however, will be shor
tened to accomodate a celebration planned for the
commemoration of the 100 th anniversary of the
Universary's opening. Because of ceremonies
planned for Oct. I, 1991, winter break will not start
until Dec. 21. Classes will resume Jan. 8.
Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the president, said
he believes that Stanford's academic calendar was
established not long after the University was
founded and hasn't been changed since.
"A general constitution set the calendar dates
many years ago," said Registar Sally Mahoney.
Stanford's quarter system was designed to be
similar to quarter systems at other universities. The
calendar is calibrated from year to year according
to a formula developed by a professor in the Statis-
tics Department, Mahoney said.
Some students, faculty and
staff members feel the Univer
sity's old calendar should be
changed to allow longer winter
breaks.
The Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement
(CAA A), a committee of the Fac
ulty Senate, is responsible for ad
ministering the calendar. As
early as 1961, it was agreed that
registration for fall quarter would
begin the Monday between Sept.
23 and 29.
Winter quarter is scheduled to
start the first Monday after Jan.
2, according to a modification in
the calendar made in 19K0.
Before that time, the quarter oc
casionally began on a Thursday
or Friday. The calendar was
modified after some professors
argued that not many students
would go to class on the short
week.
These dates determine the
length of winter break. "Normal
ly a two-week vacation occurs
only two to three times a dec
ade," Mahoney said. They occur
when the last Monday in Septem-

ber falls on a late date.
The Centennial year, 1991, will
be an exception to the rule. The
Centennial celebration planned
for Stanford's 10()th anniversary
will be held Oct. 1. Because Oct.
1 is the actual date of Stanford's
100 th anniversary, commem
orative events are planned for
that date.
"The actual (scheduled) first
day is the 26th (of September),"
Mahoney said. "However, to
avoid this problem (classes con
flicting with Centennial events),
the first day of classes was
changed to Oct. 2."
A two- or three-week break
can determine whether a foreign
student can spend the vacation at
home. Some believe the cost of
airline tickets and the hours
spent on the plane do not leave
enough time to visit both family
and friends.
"My flight is 17 hours each
way, and the ticket will cost me

around $700," said Ophelia
Ngan, a sophomore from Hong
Kong. "I decided to stay here,
since the break won't be three
weeks."
Students are not the only ones
who feel a two-week break is too
short. Some faculty and adminis
trators argue that a two-week
break means preparation for win
ter quarter is rusned.
"Between Christmas and New
Year's Eve we can't really get
any work done," said Nan
Bentley, an administrator in the
History Department. "The days
that are left before and after
these holidays are so few that we
have no time to get ready for win
ter quarter or to relax."
Professors often have conven
tions, seminars or work on other
projects during the break. They
must also plan for their next
quarter courses.
Linn Zastoupil, an assistant
professor of history, said he
could use the extra week. "Two
weeks is much too short to allow
me to do what I want to do nor
mally. The time is next-to
nothing if you celebrate

Christmas and New Year's
Eve."
Since a two-week winter break
occurs only infrequently, Maho
ney said she believes it has not
caused much of a problem. "The
policy concern for CAAA is
mostly the distinction between a
quarter or semester system, not
the schema of the calendar."
"It has always been this way,
and we have never had any prob
lems," Hamrdla said.
"No one is really mad about
the two-week break because
most of the graduate students
and professors are here any
way," said Sandra Mustiful, an
administrative assistant in the Bi
ology Department. "Sometimes
they work here night and day."
"In regards to the faculty, [the
two-week break] wouldn't make
too much of a difference," Biol
ogy Prof. Robert Schimke said.
"1 haven't taken a vacation in a
long time, but you do need a few
days to relax."
Marsha Makino, a foreign stu
dent adviser at the Bechtel Inter
national Center, said the two
week break has some impact on

foreign students. "But it hasn't
affected enough of them to notice
that the short break is hurting
travelers ''
Like Stanford, both UCLA
and Dartmouth College are on
quarter systems. UCLA ends its
quarter this year Dec. 11, and
Dartmouth finishes Dec. 9. Both
universities begin winter quarter
Jan. 4, which leaves more than
three weeks for Christmas break.
UCLA and Dartmouth have
longer breaks than Stanford this
year because their fall quarters
started before Sept. 28.
"1 wouldn't mind starting ear
lier because all my friends are
back at school anyway," Stan
ford senior Leslie Faye said.
"I think it is unusual to start
school later than other univer
sities," Schimke said.
"1 would prefer starting one
week earlier. No one would
notice the week in summer, and
most people need a longer break
between the fall and winter quar
ters," Zastoupil said.
Hamrdla and Mahoney said
they believe changing the present
system would not be difficult.
