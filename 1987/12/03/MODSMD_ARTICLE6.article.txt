# Prof, says missile treaty signals Soviet shift
## Significance of Reagan-Gorbachev summit great 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
A specialist in Soviet studies last night
characterized the probable signing of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF)
treaty by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev next week as a
likely first step toward a broader agree
ment involving strategic nuclear forces.
Tracing the events leading to this
weekend's Reagan-Gorbachev summit in
Washington, D C., Political Science Prof.
David Holloway said that "the Russians
have shown for a long time that this (an
INF treaty) is not enough."
According to Holloway, the Soviets
may have originally thought they could
prevent the 1983 NATO deployment of
Pershing II medium-range missiles in
Western Europe.
In recent years, however, the Soviet
leadership has "reassessed" its position
on arms control, Holloway said. The INF
treaty is symbolic of a larger shift in Soviet
policy, he said, a "step they have taken to
show they are willing to make an agree
ment with the United States."
He cited the NATO policy of deploying
ground-launched cruise and Pershing II
missiles as a significant motivation for the
Soviets' current willingness to negotiate.
Speaking at the Theta Delta Chi house,
Holloway predicted that Gorbachev will
push Reagan to sign some sort of agree
ment that will reduce strategic nuclear

weapons and limit the Strategic Defense
Initiative. "The INF treaty is not what
they are really after. I don't think this
agreement does very much for Gorba
chev," he said.
Because the governments of several
Western European countries "expended a
lot of political capital getting the (Pershing
II) missiles deployed," European leaders
are concerned by the precedent the up
coming treaty might establish, Holloway
said. Some European NATO members
fear de-nuclearization because they say it
will remove the only effective Western
defense against a "preponderance" of
Warsaw Pact conventional forces, Hol
loway said.
According to Holloway, cutbacks in
strategic nuclear weapons should not be
discussed without also considering reduc
tion of conventional forces. "My feeling is
that even if you have nuclear weapons,
you should have a conventional balance,"
he said.
Looking ahead to a potential ratification
battle in the Senate, Holloway said oppo
sition to the INF treaty may have
"nothing to do with the agreement." In
stead. he said, some senators who oppose
the treaty "are afraid that Reagan will go
for a strategic agreement" that could leave
Europe vulnerable to Warsaw Pact con
ventional forces.
Holloway added that Gorbachev may
also try to get Reagan to commit to a Mos
cow visit.
