Bishop's tape played for inmates
ATLANTA — A tape-recorded message by the Roman Cath
olic bishop who had a key role in ending the Cuban inmate
revolt in Louisiana was played yesterday for Cuban inmates in
the Atlanta federal penitentiary as part of the government's ef
forts to resolve the 10-day-old siege here.
Federal officials said that the tape by Auxiliary Bishop Agus
tin Roman of the Miami archdiocese was broadcast in the late
afternoon over the prison's public address system to the 1106
Cubans who still hold 89 hostages.
Department of Justice spokesman Patrick Korten declined to
disclose the nature of Roman's remarks, but the government's
action in playing the tape apparently represents a decided step
forward in settling the uprising.
Department of Justice officials have repeatedly said they
would not involve Roman in Atlanta until the inmate leadership
was unified and spoke with a single voice in negotiations.
"It's an appropriate moment to bring in a taped message from
him," Korten told reporters at an afternoon news briefing.
"There has been forward movement. We are closer."
He also said the addition of two more negotiators for the
detainees to the four already involved in talks with federal au
thorities has broadened the spectrum of inmates represented at
the bargaining table so that it now includes a "fairly full" range
of the inmate factions.
Haitians organizing new elections
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — The military-dominated gov
ernment made its first moves yesterday to organize a new round
of national elections in what Haitians familiar with the efforts
described as a last-ditch attempt to avert either a U.S. military
intervention or civil war.
Late yesterday, said informed Haitian sources, the three-man
National Government Council headed by Gen. Henri Namphy
prepared a letter addressed to eight broad confederations in
cluding church, human rights and university groups,
The letter summons the eight organizations to meet this week
with the government council to begin planning a new election —
to take place by Jan. 10, according to sources familiar with its
text. Namphy has pledged that a new president will be in
augurated Feb. 7.
The government council, the sources said, was also in urgent
negotiations with a range of politicians for a compromise that
would allow a new election. Talk of a possibility of a direct U.S.
or multinational military action spread through the city.
After bloody terrorist attacks by Army troops and allies of the
deposed Duvalier dictatorship forced the first electoral council
to call off elections last Sunday, Namphy dissolved that elec
toral body. Since then, the capital has been nearly paralyzed
with tension. Diplomats used terms like "volatile" and "highly
dangerous" to describe the situation.
Korean is key suspect in jet crash
SEOUL, South Korea — A Korean resident of Japan who
disappeared two years ago is a central figure in the mystery sur
rounding Sunday's crash of a Korean Air jetliner with 115
aboard, Korean and Japanese authorities said yesterday.
Japanese police say a man using the name Akira Miyamoto
has been on a wanted list as a suspect in a North Korean spy
case since March of last year, the Korea Times reported from
Tokyo.
South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan, citing progress
made by Japanese investigators, expressed strong suspicion
yesterday that Communist North Korea was involved in causing
the crash of KAL's Flight 858 in Burma. The plane, a Boeing
707, was en route to Seoul from Baghdad, Iraq, when it disap
peared abruptly Sunday, without warning or distress signal.
There was still confusion and doubt yesterday as to whether
the crash site has been identified from the air. Searchers on the
ground had not reached the wreckage.
"It is clear that North Korea has intensified its provocative
moves to obstruct the upcoming (Dec. 16) presidential election
and the 1988 Seoul Olympics," Chun said at a Cabinet meeting.
Study paints grim Soviet picture
WASHINGTON — Mikhail Gorbachev is not likely to
achieve his most ambitious economic goals for many years, if
ever, and the failure to show quicker results could cause him
serious political problems, according to a 1132-page report on
the Soviet economy released today by Congress' Joint Eco
nomic Committee.
Issued five days before the start of summit meetings between
Gorbachev and President Reagan in Washington, the two
volume series of studies by Soviet specialists in government and
the private sector provides a frequently grim account of the
massive problems facing Soviet economic reformers.
"The consensus among the economists in the report is that
there are so many problems in so many areas of the economy
that there is no way the Gorbachev policy of reform can change
anything in the foreseeable future," said Richard Kaufman, the
committee s general counsel.
"Gorbachev's burden is to struggle with a faltering economy,
even one that may require austerity until his reforms are imple
mented and have time to take effect," Kaufman said. "You're
talking about the end of the centurv."
Ed Hewitt, an economist at the Brookings Institution who tes
tified before the committee, said in an interview, "Gorbachev
has far-reaching plans, but pretty quickly he has to come up
with a down payment to keep the people interested."
Chicago council elects mayor
CHICAGO — In a scene so bizarre and raw that four televi
sion stations carried it to its near-dawn conclusion, the city
council yesterday elected Eugene Sawyer to succeed the late
Mayor Harold Washington.
The pandemonium ended at 4 a.m., 10 hours after the special
meeting to elect an acting mayor was scheduled to begin.
One alderman wore a bulletproof vest; another climbed atop
his desk in the chambers shouting as thousands of demonstra
tors chanted in the street outside.
Some council members were called "thieves" and
"vultures." Others were accused of "inciting mob rule" during
four stormy hours of debate that did not begin until after mid
night.
When it was over, Sawyer, a longtime South Side ward boss,
became the acting mayor until April 1989, when a special gen
eral election will be held.
A veteran black alderman, Sawyer wasn't so much elected as
he was pushed into office by white aldermen after some of his
black allies on the city council had announced they wanted to
postpone balloting until Friday because Sawyer did not have
enough support among black citizens to govern.
He defeated Alderman Timothy Evans, Washington's council
floor leader and chief political spokesman, with the support of
23 white aldermen.
