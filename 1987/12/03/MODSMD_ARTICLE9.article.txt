# Soviets rebut ABM charges

### 
WASHINGTON â€” Senior Soviet officials
strongly rebutted yesterday what they called
a "surprise" U.S. accusation that the Soviets
have recently violated the Anti-ballistic
Missile Treaty and said the controversy
should not poison the atmosphere for next
week's Washington summit meeting.
The Soviet rebuttal, by Communist Party
spokesman Albert Vlasov and Col. Gen.
Nikolai Chervov of the Soviet General Staff,
came in a Washington nevvs conference about
an hour before the White House otYicially
released its charge that Moscow's redeploy
ment of radar equipment and components is a
newly discovered violation of the pact.
Senior U.S. and Soviet officials also traded
charges on last-minute hitches in the way of a
completed intermediate-range nuclear forces
(INF) treaty to be signed by President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
here Tuesday.
"No violations of a treaty can be consid
ered to be a minor matter, nor can there be
confidence in agreements if a country can
pick and choose which provisions of an
agreement it will comply with," Reagan said

in his fifth-annual "Soviet non-compliance"
report to Congress. He said the new radar
related violation "can quickly be corrected
by the Soviet Union if it so chooses."
The Soviet officials said, however, that the
alleged violation is a mere shift of partly dis
mantled equipment which they informed the
United States about and invited U.S. officials
to inspect.
Vlasov, deputy propaganda chief for the
Communist Party's Central Committee, said,
"We do not believe these issues will hamper
the atmosphere of the upcoming summit
meeting."
Appearing at the first Soviet contribution
to a presummit "battle of the briefings" that
is shaping up in Washington, Vlasov said, "It
is possible to clear those difficulties if we
create between our two countries an atmos
phere of trust."
U.S. chief arms negotiator Max Kampel
man, appearing on a U.S. Information
Agency "Worldnet" telecast, also seemed to
play down the allegation by repeatedly refer
ring to the radars as a "technical violation"
of the ABM Treaty. He said the charge

"really should bear no relationship to the
summit."
The U.S. charge, leveled by Reagan
against the recommendation of the State De
partment and the Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency, was that "rmyor parts" of a
Soviet radar, known to Western analysts as
Flat Twin, and the van belonging to a second
radar, known as Pawn Shop, were observed
last March at an electronics plant in Gomel,
about 370 miles southwest of Moscow.
The violation occurred when they were
moved to Gomel from a missile test center at
Sary Shagan more than 20()0 miles away, the
U.S. report said, adding that under the 1972
Treaty, "ABM components" cannot be
deployed outside a designated test range such
as Sary Shangan.
Chervov, the equivalent of a U.S. four-star
general and chief of the arms control section
of the General Staff of the Soviet armed
forces, said the Soviet Union destroyed one
radar and "dismantled" two others at Sary
Shagan in order to allay U.S. concerns.
