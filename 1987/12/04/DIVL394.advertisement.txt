My friends think I'm weird because I
think it's neat to see my breath in the
winter. Ifs true, I do. But shoot! I'm
from Hawaii, and spewing fog when
you talk just doesn't happen there...l
love to scooter. I scooter every
where... to classes and to parties...Last
night I scootered over to The Store at
1 30 in the morning to grab a study
break snack and to pick up one of
those spiffy highlighters they're giving
away. Yup. They're free. No purchase
necessary, like they say in ads You
'fHYt' ca n just walk right in and pick one up
And The Store's open way until 2a.m.
4 during Dead Week. Isn't that swell?
