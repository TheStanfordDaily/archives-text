# SLAC worker will sue his supervisors
## 
### kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
Charging SLAC management with "verbal,
physical and mental harassment" on the job. an
employee of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter said yesterday he will file suit against two of his
supervisors.
Victor Wilson, a maintenance technician at
SLAC, has filed charges with the United Stanford
Workers (USW) and the National Labor Relations
Board alleging that SLAC management treated him
abusively on several occasions.
Wilson said he also will seek reimbursent for
"pain and suffering" in a small claims court suit
against SLAC managers Wesley Asher and Earl
Hamner.
According to a representative of the USW and
the SLAC personnel director, labor relations prob
lems have plagued SLAC and its parent body, the
University, since the linear accelerator began oper
ation 20 years ago.
Since Nov. 1985, Wilson has filed 11 grievances
with the USW, the most recent charging Asher
with verbal abuse.
According to USW field representative Bill Di
Vita, the union filed a grievance concerning this in
cident with the University. Subsequently, the Uni
versity confirmed that Asher's behavior was inap
propriate and counseled him about it.
Di Vita expressed sympathy for Wilson, and said
the USW is preparing to confront the University
with these issues. "I understand his (Wilson's)
frustrations," Di Vita said, claiming that SLAC is
an "oppressive environment."
Di Vita said the USW serves as a "neutral ar
bitrator" to prevent court battles between the Uni
versity and its workers.
But Wilson said USW support has been inade
quate in addressing all his complaints; he added
that he must hire a private attorney to fight man
agement on his own.
Both Wilson and Di Vita attribute a recent rise in
workers' grievances to a change in management,
pointing in particular to the appointment of Burton
Richter as the new SLAC director.
Richter, who is presently in Washington seeking
financial support for the construction of a new ac
celerator, was unavailable for comment.
According to DiVita, more USW workers have
filed grievances against SLAC administration in the
past two years than against the managements of
campus and administrations the Stanford Medical
Center combined.
But SLAC Personnel Director Doug Dupen said
he saw no correlation between the new administra
tion and the recent escalation in grievances.
"There have always been lots and lots" of griev
ances against management, but no increase within
the past two years, he said.
Dupen, however, speculated that budgetary and
time constraints associated with the construction of
the new accelerator may have increased tension
among workers.
