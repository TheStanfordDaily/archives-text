# Rosse hails budget process
## New system to be fully implemented by 1990 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
Stanford has "made good progress" in its budget
planning for 1988-89 under a new budget process
initiated this year, University Provost James Rosse
told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
Speaking at a meeting of the senate, Rosse said
the new budget pjanning system is better than the
old one because it decentralizes decision-making.
The old system assigned full responsibility for the
budget to the provost, which "discourages local in
itiative and responsibility," according to Rosse's
report.
Despite possible problems of adjusting prior fi
nancial commitments to the new budget process,
Rosse concluded that he is "guardedly optimistic"
about the new procedure.
Rosse said the University's budget process will
be in a transitional phase until the 1990-91 aca
demic year, when "we'll be entirely in the new
mode."
"Based on early returns, we find a great deal of
enthusiasm in putting decision-making in the hands
of others," he said. Rosse said he began to work on
the new system with the faculty Budget Redesign
Steering Committee two years ago.
The senate yesterday also received an interim
report on continuing education at Stanford. The
report, prepared by English Prof. William Chace,
speculated on possible expansion of the Univer
sity's current continuing education program.
The continuing education program currently in
cludes the following:
• the Stanford Instructional Television Network
and the Honors Cooperative Program, which offer

technical or professional courses via television;
• the summer session for current Stanford students
and post-B. A. students from other institutions;
• the Knight Fellowship program (for no credit) for
two dozen journalists; and
• programs offered by the Alumni Association;
The Provostial Task Force on Continuing Educa
tion examined programs at other schools, including
Harvard University, the University of Chicago and
Duke and conducted a telephone survey to monitor
what community interest there would be in such a
program.
Chace said that "there is an invisible moat that
surrounds this university.'' He said that continuing
education courses would enable members of the
community to enter the University "in the class
room," rather than just through programs.
Chace said that in "teaching to a new kind of stu
dent clientele whose questions might be different
and arresting," the program would "be a genuine
positive virtue to the faculty."
But faculty polled by the task force expressed
concern that the additional courses might burden
the faculty teaching them.
"This would be over and above the respon
siblities of each faculty member," Chace said."lf
there is a genuine problem . . . we d have no inten
tion of establishing the program."
Tentative figures from the task force estimated
the cost of the courses to be between $300 and
$500, and faculty compensation to run between
$3500 and $5000 per course.
Because of the difference in tuition and lack of a
student screening process, Stanford students
would not be eligible to participate in the classes
for credit.
