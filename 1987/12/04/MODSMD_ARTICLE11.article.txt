## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Summit is a beginning 
### 
This weekend, as part of the University's on
going celebration of its Centennial, Stanford will
play host to "Building a Safer 21st Century," a
conference on international security and strate
gic relations between the superpowers.
Serendipitously, the conference comes on the
heels of recent progress in arms control talks be
tween the United States and the Soviet Union,
and coincides almost exactly with the arms con
trol summit meeting between President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, scheduled
to begin next week in Washington.
That timeliness gives the conference, which is
free and open to the public, particular pertinence
and makes it an appropriate occasion for reflect
ing on what direction — if any — U.S.-Soviet
arms control efforts are taking.
Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last
week announced agreement on a ground
breaking treaty to ban all U.S. and Soviet
intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe. It
is the first arms agreement that will actually
reduce the number of nuclear weapons.
Clearly, the agreement is a much needed step
away from the policies of escalation that have
held sway in both the United States and the So
viet Union, and it is a promising and long
overdue sign of some progress in arms control.
In short, it is a beginning.
Reagan and Gorbachev, if they achieve noth
ing else in their summit meeting, should sign the
treaty and initiate the process of dismantling
their short- and intermediate-range arsenals.
But the two leaders should do more than that.
They should also lay the groundwork now for
real advances in reducing the store of the most
troubling and potentially destructive weapons in
the nuclear arsenal. Certainly, reductions in
intermediate- and short-range missiles are neces
sary, but the present treaty doesn't address long
range intercontinental ballistic missiles, bomb
ers and submarine-launched missiles.
Both leaders must come to the summit
meeting with a willingness to talk substantively
about that long-range strategic arsenal. And the
president must be willing to compromise on his

stubborn plans for a space-based defense sys
tem.
One hopes the two leaders will be able to talk
candidly and cooperatively and reach some
agreements. Already, however, the president is
playing games with Gorbachev, potentially cre
ating an atmosphere of increased distrust and
suspicion.
Reagan declared this week that the Soviet Un
ion has committed another violation of the 1972
Antiballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. The Wash
ington Post reported that Reagan decided to
press the treaty violation charge despite the fact
that his advisers told him the alleged Soviet
violation "was ambiguous, had little military sig
nificance and needed further investigation
before any conclusions could be reached."
Next week's summit must be conducted in an
atmosphere of detente, not in the environment of
petty Cold War one-upmanship Reagan seems to
be cultivating with this most recent charge. The
president's commitment to arms control has al
ways been questionable; this summit will largely
determine the arms control legacy his adminis
tration will leave to succeeding presidents.
The summit and this weekend's campus con
ference are a valuable opportunity to think about
the fundamental importance to mankind of arms
control accords between the superpowers. And
the conference also affords the Stanford commu
nity an excellent opportunity to learn more
about the proposed treaty and its significance in
the context oi the goals of arms control.
Ultimately, the measure of the effectiveness
of any arms control measure is the degree to
which it makes nuclear war less likely. As a
recent New York Times analysis said, arms con
trol negotiation "is the search for a carefully
drawn balance of incentives, deterrents and ex
pectations designed to lead each side to con
clude that it cannot ultimately gain by being the
first to launch a devastating nuclear attack
against the other."
It is hoped that officials of both countries will
pursue that search with the profound earnest
ness and due speed this issue merits.
