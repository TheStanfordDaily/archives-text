Co-ops offer most
significant savings
over Food Service
In his column explaining the
advantage of self-op eating plans
over regular dorm eating plans,
Bruce Klein (Daily, Nov. 30)
made several valid points.
However, he neglected to men
tion an even better option — the
co-ops.
The co-ops (Columbae, Ham
marskjold, Kairos, Phi Psi, Syn

ergy. Terra and Theta Chi) offer
students a drastically lower
board rate in exchange for a few
hours of work per week. An
average board bill at one of the
co-ops is about $325 per quarter.
Compare this to the self-ops
(about $575) or to a University
operated residence (U-op) with
food service (about $825). Over
an entire year, co-opers save
about $750 compared to the self
ops and about $ 15(H) compared to
the U-ops.
That's big bucks! Why do co
op residents save so much, you
ask? Simply because they spend

about three (or fewer) hours a
week cooking and cleaning for
themselves. Just about
everybody could spare those few
hours, especially when they find
out that cooking with their
housemates can be a heck of a lot
of fun. And, as most co-opers
will tell you, the food is just as
good as anywhere else (if not bet
ter). So, if you're on the run from
food service, or if you just want
to live in a great community
developed out of cooperative ef
fort, check out the co-ops. Din
