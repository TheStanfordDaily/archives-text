# America's apathy a reflection of pragmatic views
## 
### 
I was going to write a boring, long
winded column about my impressions of
Mikhail Gorbachev's interview last
Monday night with Tom Brokaw. I even
took notes. Late that night, however, it
dawned on me that most people proba
bly wouldn't read past the first para
graph, a thought that almost made me
cry. But real journalists don't cry, so I
scrambled to come up with another idea.

Scrambling is something I have done
all too often this quarter. Every other
Monday night I have sat down in front of
the computer with literally no idea of
what 1 would write about. Don't get me
wrong; being a columnist gets me invited
to a lot of parties, but topics for columns
have been extremely hard to come by.
That is because very little has hap

pened on campus this quarter. Last year
there was the Western Culture debate,
the Rainbow Agenda protests and the
Reagan Library, to name but a few. This
year has seen no parallels. I for one have
not been able to get fired up about the
grape boycott.
Life outside Stanford has been pretty
uneventful as well. We have the Su
preme Court vacancy, the stock market,
the arms control summit and presidential
elections around the corner. There are
many issues that merit our attention,
both locally and nationally, and sober
people will undoubtedly deal with them.
But who wants to be sober on the Friday
before Dead Week? In short, can we not
agree that for the past nine weeks or so
life has been pretty boring?
But I do not think that this relative
lack of controversy should be viewed as
an isolated time period. Rather, let me
submit to you that it signals a growing
trend in our society â€” boredom.
When was the last time you read a
book that "you couldn't put down?"
The last book I read in one frenzied sit
ting was J.D. Salinger's "Catcher in the
Rye," in my sophomore year of high
school.

How about a movie? Music? When's
the last time you took time out from your
studies to go watch a presentation on
campus?

What we are now seeing is
pragmatism in its highest
and most advanced stage.
. . . People don't get in
volved in politics because
they know that, contrary to
what some people tell them,
they will not make a differ
ence.

I've always felt Stanford students are
generally too apathetic about life, but
probably no more than the rest of the
country. Chances are, if we aren't
reading the newspaper, no one else is
reading it either.
The cultural gurus have responded to
this general lack of interest with overkill.

They realize we have no attention spans
so they bombard us with hype. Instant
gratification. Shock value. They give us
shorter articles with bigger headlines.
They give us U.S.A. Today. They
give us Rambo. Worse yet, they give us
Blue Velvet. Come to think of it, worse
yet, they give us the Democratic candi
dates for president.
Maybe all that stuff about nihilism and
moral relativism described by Allan
Bloom is behind it all. Maybe the kind of
people who have been changing our
Western Culture requirements have
failed to impart all of those great West
ern values in our little tykes. Ergo, they
grow up stupid and bored.
Maybe. But let me submit a different
theory. I read somewhere that prag
matism is America's greatest philosophi
cal contribution. Ironic, considering that
I thought we were known for our
idealism. What we are now seeing is that
pragmatism, in its highest and most ad
vanced stage.
People don't get involved in politics
because they know that, contrary to
what some people tell them, they will
not make a difference. People don't read
the newspaper because thev know some

one else is going to mess things up,
anyway. Why waste the time to read
about someone else's mistakes? Why go
to a protest if no one is going to listen?
I was passionately involved in the
Western Culture debate last spring quar
ter. 1 was staunchly opposed to the pro
posed changes. But this year I have
barely kept up with the issue, let alone
gone to a debate. That is because deep
down 1 know the changes are going to
occur whether 1 get involved or not.
For all of the pure souls who yearn for
the activism of the 19605, this phenome
non should be quite disconcerting. But
pragmatism is not to be confused with
crass yuppie materialism. People still
have the same dreams, the same ideals;
they just lack the motivation to waste
time achieving their goals. "Making a
statement" is an awfully abstract con
cept these days.
Someone will inevitably come along
and excite us or challenge our thinking
yet again. The American mind seems to
thrive on adversity. But I think it's going
to take a hell of a lot to get people to put
on their tye-died shirts again.
