## Ideas are more important than profits

I want to express my excitement over
reading Ken Zimmerman's analysis of the
goal of a Stanford education (Daily, Nov. 30).
I was happy to see that someone at Stanford
shares my views about the consequences of
gearing an education toward profit maximiza

An educational focus on making money in
evitably leads to a decrease in social con
sciousness and an increase in apathy about is
sues of social justice. Such a money-making
ideology is a barrier to intellectual growth. It
seems to me our role as intellectuals is to
generate ideas about what is good for society.
We must define public problems and the
range of possible solutions to those problems.
All of us have a role to play in helping the
public confront these issues. Such an ex
plicative process, properly managed, can
build on itself: As society defines and
evaluates its collective goals, it examines its
norms and beliefs; in defining its purposes, it
becomes better able to mobilize resources to
achieve its goals.
Furthermore, ideas establish the assump
tions, justifications, purposes and means of
public action. They simultaneously authorize
and instruct members of society to take ac
tion for public purposes. Ideas create a rea
son for people to act by setting out the public
value or necessity of the act and by giving the

act a social meaning that is accessible to both
the person who acts and the people who are
watching. In this way ideas both motivate
and direct action.
An idea, like a spotlight, illuminates the
particular parts of the world on which it
focuses. When attention is directed to some
possibilities for action, other possible modes
are inevitably left in the dark. But this is
precisely that which reveals the power of a
particular idea. When ideas become domi
nant in debates, when a university develops a
strong sense of mission or when a social norm
mobilizes actions on behalf of public
purposes, ideas demonstrate their power by
providing a context for public debate and ac
tion.
As students at one of the top universities in
the country, I believe it is our duty to provide
the public with alternative visions of what is
desirable and possible, to stimulate delibera
tion about them, to provoke re-examination
of premises and values and to broaden
thereby the range of potential responses and
deepen society's understanding of itself.
I understand it is a considerable challenge
to engage the public in rethinking the way
certain problems are defined, alternative so
lutions envisioned and responsibilities for ac
tion allocated. However, to the extent that
deliberation and reflection yield a broader
perspective on available possibilities, society
is better equipped to cope with change and to
learn from its past. The thoughtless adher
ence to outmoded conceptions of problems,
choices and responsibilities can threaten so

ciety's survival. An education from Stanford
should consist of more than the discovery of
what we want; it should entail the creation of
contexts in which people can critically evalu
ate and revise what they believe.
To accomplish these idealistic goals we
must be the leaders. A leader identifies her
self by taking stands, even unpopular stands.
Moreover, a leader is expected to reach out
to the people, explain her position, solicit the
support of the people and gain their accept
ance. The mark of leadership is to succeed in
carrying out one's goals; the means of suc
ceeding involve skillful interaction with
people.
Ultimately, if we devote our lives to the
pursuit of material well-being, we will fail to
appreciate the power of ideas and the impor
tance of deliberation about them. In an era
like the present one — when overall public
purposes are less clear than during wars and
depressions; when the ways public problems
are defined, choices posed and responsibili
ties subtly allocated can make all the differ
ence; when many issues are so technically
complex that values are easily hidden within
expert judgments and when "great com
municators" can hold center stage on na
tional media geared to visionary appeals —
our strongest defense against demagoguery is
the habit of critical discussion about and self
conscious awareness of the ideas that en
velop us.

I want to express my excitement over
reading Ken Zimmerman's analysis of the
goal of a Stanford education (Daily, Nov. 30).
I was happy to see that someone at Stanford
shares my views about the consequences of
gearing an education toward profit maximiza
tion.

An educational focus on making money in
evitably leads to a decrease in social con
sciousness and an increase in apathy about is
sues of social justice. Such a money-making
ideology is a barrier to intellectual growth. It
seems to me our role as intellectuals is to
generate ideas about what is good for society.
We must define public problems and the
range of possible solutions to those problems.
All of us have a role to play in helping the
public confront these issues. Such an ex
plicative process, properly managed, can
build on itself: As society defines and
evaluates its collective goals, it examines its
norms and beliefs; in defining its purposes, it
becomes better able to mobilize resources to
achieve its goals.
Furthermore, ideas establish the assump
tions, justifications, purposes and means of
public action. They simultaneously authorize
and instruct members of society to take ac
tion for public purposes. Ideas create a rea
son for people to act by setting out the public
value or necessity of the act and by giving the

act a social meaning that is accessible to both
the person who acts and the people who are
watching. In this way ideas both motivate
and direct action.
An idea, like a spotlight, illuminates the
particular parts of the world on which it
focuses. When attention is directed to some
possibilities for action, other possible modes
are inevitably left in the dark. But this is
precisely that which reveals the power of a
particular idea. When ideas become domi
nant in debates, when a university develops a
strong sense of mission or when a social norm
mobilizes actions on behalf of public
purposes, ideas demonstrate their power by
providing a context for public debate and ac
tion.
As students at one of the top universities in
the country, I believe it is our duty to provide
the public with alternative visions of what is
desirable and possible, to stimulate delibera
tion about them, to provoke re-examination
of premises and values and to broaden
thereby the range of potential responses and
deepen society's understanding of itself.
I understand it is a considerable challenge
to engage the public in rethinking the way
certain problems are defined, alternative so
lutions envisioned and responsibilities for ac
tion allocated. However, to the extent that
deliberation and reflection yield a broader
perspective on available possibilities, society
is better equipped to cope with change and to
learn from its past. The thoughtless adher
ence to outmoded conceptions of problems,
choices and responsibilities can threaten so

ciety's survival. An education from Stanford
should consist of more than the discovery of
what we want; it should entail the creation of
contexts in which people can critically evalu
ate and revise what they believe.
To accomplish these idealistic goals we
must be the leaders. A leader identifies her
self by taking stands, even unpopular stands.
Moreover, a leader is expected to reach out
to the people, explain her position, solicit the
support of the people and gain their accept
ance. The mark of leadership is to succeed in
carrying out one's goals; the means of suc
ceeding involve skillful interaction with
people.
Ultimately, if we devote our lives to the
pursuit of material well-being, we will fail to
appreciate the power of ideas and the impor
tance of deliberation about them. In an era
like the present one — when overall public
purposes are less clear than during wars and
depressions; when the ways public problems
are defined, choices posed and responsibili
ties subtly allocated can make all the differ
ence; when many issues are so technically
complex that values are easily hidden within
expert judgments and when "great com
municators" can hold center stage on na
tional media geared to visionary appeals —
our strongest defense against demagoguery is
the habit of critical discussion about and self
conscious awareness of the ideas that en
velop us.
