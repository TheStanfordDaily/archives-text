## Students will get a taste of glasnost this spring 
### K. Kay Devgun 
During the week of April 17, a
group of 12 select students from
the Soviet Union will be visiting
the Stanford campus in what is
hoped will be the beinning of a
long tradition of intellectual and
cultural exchange between Stan
ford and the Soviet Union.
The Soviet students are from
the University of Novosibirsk in
Siberia, and their one-week visit
will be the culmination of a
year's worth of planning and
preparation by the Stanford-
Soviet Exchange Project (SSEP),
a new student organization inter
ested in fostering greater under
standing between the people of
the United States and the Soviet
Union.
In addition to hosting the So
viet students, the project has also
selected a group of 12 Stanford
undergraduates and one graduate
student to travel to the Unversity
of Novosibirsk from March 19 to
April 2, 1988, as student
delegates from Stanford.
The Stanford delegates were
selected through a two-step ap
plication process. Applicants
whose written applications were
selected from an original pool of
130 hopefuls were then inter
viewed by the selection commit
tee. The students selected for the
first exchange are seniors Alma
Derricks, Debbie Oilman, Kathy
Healy, David Kang, Michael Lu,
John Pollack, Harpal Sandhu,
Lili Shaver and Carole Solomon;
sophomores Kim Grose, Na
deem Hussain and Elizabeth
Perez; and graduate student
Jamie Driscoll.
If any of the 12 cannot go,
three alternates have also been
selected for the trip. They are
junior Mary Robins and sopho

mores Jeff Lager and Rob
Mihalko.
This year marks the group's
first attempt to establish an ex
change program with a Soviet
university. Originally, the SSEP
at Stanford was initiated by Den
nis Matthies, resident fellow of
Otero House. This year, how
ever, the SSEP decided to follow
the example of a similar ex
change program at Yale Univer
sity — a program that is entirely
student-run.
The Stanford program is pat
terned closely after Yale's very
successful Soviet exchange pro
gram, which now includes
several faculty members as well
as students. SSEP members hope
that their annual exchange even
tually will involve more faculty,
too.
During the Soviets students'
one-week stay on campus, April
22-28. the SSEP plans to host nu
merous discussion panels, infor
mal talks, tours, parties and ac
tivites to introduce the Stanford
community to the Soviet delega
tion. The SSEP will be responsi
ble for housing, feeding, enter
taining and educating the Soviets
during their stay here.
According to David Kang,
chair of the SSEP. "The main
purpose of the exchange is to ed
ucate the Stanford community
and the Soviets about each
other."
Holly Kramer, a representa
tive of the Citizens Exchange
Council, a New York- based or
ganization that promotes citizen
diplomacy, advised the SSEP
about the opportunities for travel
in the Soviet Union. Kramer said
the atmosphere for foreigners in
the Soviet Union has improved
considerably as a result of

"glasnost,'" Mikhail Gorba
chev's policy of relative "open
ness."
Harpal Sandhu, a senior in in
dustrial engineering, said he ex
pects his preconceptions about
the Soviet Union will be shat
tered by this experience. "An
opportunity like this doesn't
come around very often," he
said. "It's going to be a once-in
a-lifetime experience to meet
people my age, interested in
politics and engineering in Rus
sia. It will be refreshing to see
their perspective of important is
sues."
David Kang, a senior in organi
zational behavior, decided to ap

ply to the program after reflect
ing on his experience in high
school, when he wrote letters to
the Soviet Embassy to protest
the shooting down of Korean Air
Lines Flight (M) 7 in 1983.
He said he feels his beliefs
about the Soviets are largely
biased by what he sees in the
media and added that "because
technology has made the world a
much smaller place, it has
become more important to in
crease understanding between
citizens of different nations."
Elizabeth Perez, an undeclared
sophomore said she believes
"that individual or personal in
teractions are basic to cultural

understanding and apprecia
tion."
Kramer noted that this year
the Soviet Union has granted
funds for 21 of its universities to
conduct exchanges with 21
American universities in the near
future.
For the American schools
however, funding is not so easily
attained. The SSEP receives no
funding from Stanford Univer
sity. According to Sandhu. co
chairman of the group's fund
raising committee, the SSEP
needs to raise $43.0(X) by the end
of January.
Each delegate in the group is
responsible for raising $ 1 (KK) on

his or her own to contribute to
the the group s funds. The rest of
the money is expected to come
from local alumni, Silicon Valley
corporations and grant-giving
foundations.
Contributions to the group, in
cluding a $5000 grant from the
Citizens Exchange Council, have
been coming in steadily, but
much more fund raising must be
completed before the Soviets
arrive.
The SSEP plans to pay for the
Soviet delegation's food, hous
ing, sightseeing and round-trip
airfare from New York to San
Francisco. The Soviet group
plans to host the Stanford delega
tion in the same manner.
During their one-week stay
here, the Soviet students will be
split up into pairs and housed
with students in dormitories, co
ops and Row houses that volun
teer to host them. It is hoped that
such close contact will foster dis
cussion and learning between all
the students involved.
While most of the Stanford stu
dents' time in the Soviet Union
will be spent at Novosibirsk,
they will also tour Leningrad and
Moscow.
Members of the Stanford dele
gation are not required to be
fluent in Russian, but all the stu
dents are learning a few funda
mental phrases in Russian. Lan
guage barriers are not expected
to be a major difficulty, because
all Soviet university students are
required to learn to speak and
write English.
For students interested in
joining the program next year,
the SSEP expects to start its ap
plication and selection proce
dures some time during spring
quarter.

Senior David Kang (second from right) makes a point during a recent meeting with his fellow participants in
the Stanford-Soviet Exchange Program.
During the week of April 17, a
group of 12 select students from
the Soviet Union will be visiting
the Stanford campus in what is
hoped will be the beinning of a
long tradition of intellectual and
cultural exchange between Stan
ford and the Soviet Union.
The Soviet students are from
the University of Novosibirsk in
Siberia, and their one-week visit
will be the culmination of a
year's worth of planning and
preparation by the Stanford-
Soviet Exchange Project (SSEP),
a new student organization inter
ested in fostering greater under
standing between the people of
the United States and the Soviet
Union.
In addition to hosting the So
viet students, the project has also
selected a group of 12 Stanford
undergraduates and one graduate
student to travel to the Unversity
of Novosibirsk from March 19 to
April 2, 1988, as student
delegates from Stanford.
The Stanford delegates were
selected through a two-step ap
plication process. Applicants
whose written applications were
selected from an original pool of
130 hopefuls were then inter
viewed by the selection commit
tee. The students selected for the
first exchange are seniors Alma
Derricks, Debbie Oilman, Kathy
Healy, David Kang, Michael Lu,
John Pollack, Harpal Sandhu,
Lili Shaver and Carole Solomon;
sophomores Kim Grose, Na
deem Hussain and Elizabeth
Perez; and graduate student
Jamie Driscoll.
If any of the 12 cannot go,
three alternates have also been
selected for the trip. They are
junior Mary Robins and sopho

mores Jeff Lager and Rob
Mihalko.
This year marks the group's
first attempt to establish an ex
change program with a Soviet
university. Originally, the SSEP
at Stanford was initiated by Den
nis Matthies, resident fellow of
Otero House. This year, how
ever, the SSEP decided to follow
the example of a similar ex
change program at Yale Univer
sity — a program that is entirely
student-run.
The Stanford program is pat
terned closely after Yale's very
successful Soviet exchange pro
gram, which now includes
several faculty members as well
as students. SSEP members hope
that their annual exchange even
tually will involve more faculty,
too.
During the Soviets students'
one-week stay on campus, April
22-28. the SSEP plans to host nu
merous discussion panels, infor
mal talks, tours, parties and ac
tivites to introduce the Stanford
community to the Soviet delega
tion. The SSEP will be responsi
ble for housing, feeding, enter
taining and educating the Soviets
during their stay here.
According to David Kang,
chair of the SSEP. "The main
purpose of the exchange is to ed
ucate the Stanford community
and the Soviets about each
other."
Holly Kramer, a representa
tive of the Citizens Exchange
Council, a New York- based or
ganization that promotes citizen
diplomacy, advised the SSEP
about the opportunities for travel
in the Soviet Union. Kramer said
the atmosphere for foreigners in
the Soviet Union has improved
considerably as a result of

"glasnost,'" Mikhail Gorba
chev's policy of relative "open
ness."
Harpal Sandhu, a senior in in
dustrial engineering, said he ex
pects his preconceptions about
the Soviet Union will be shat
tered by this experience. "An
opportunity like this doesn't
come around very often," he
said. "It's going to be a once-in
a-lifetime experience to meet
people my age, interested in
politics and engineering in Rus
sia. It will be refreshing to see
their perspective of important is
sues."
David Kang, a senior in organi
zational behavior, decided to ap

ply to the program after reflect
ing on his experience in high
school, when he wrote letters to
the Soviet Embassy to protest
the shooting down of Korean Air
Lines Flight (M) 7 in 1983.
He said he feels his beliefs
about the Soviets are largely
biased by what he sees in the
media and added that "because
technology has made the world a
much smaller place, it has
become more important to in
crease understanding between
citizens of different nations."
Elizabeth Perez, an undeclared
sophomore said she believes
"that individual or personal in
teractions are basic to cultural

understanding and apprecia
tion."
Kramer noted that this year
the Soviet Union has granted
funds for 21 of its universities to
conduct exchanges with 21
American universities in the near
future.
For the American schools
however, funding is not so easily
attained. The SSEP receives no
funding from Stanford Univer
sity. According to Sandhu. co
chairman of the group's fund
raising committee, the SSEP
needs to raise $43.0(X) by the end
of January.
Each delegate in the group is
responsible for raising $ 1 (KK) on

his or her own to contribute to
the the group s funds. The rest of
the money is expected to come
from local alumni, Silicon Valley
corporations and grant-giving
foundations.
