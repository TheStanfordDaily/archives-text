# Soviets will talk via satellite link
## Arms conference begins today 
### Bobby Schrader Senior staff writer 
At least one high-ranking
member of the Soviet delegation
to the upcoming Reagan-
Gorbachev summit will address
the Stanford Arms Control Sym
posium in a direct satellite link
from Washington Saturday.
Andrei Sergeyev, the head of
the Soviet space program and a
key figure in the talks between
the United States and the Soviet
Union next week, will participate
in a round-table discussion on
"recent developments in the
U.5.5.R.," according to Diana
Diamond, assistant director of
University Relations.
The discussion was set up
Monday by symposium director
Sidney Drell in place of a sched
uled address by Soviet physicist
Andrei Sakharov as it became in
creasingly apparent that the
Nobel laureate would not be
allowed to leave the Soviet Un

ion to attend the conference.
Symposium co-director David
Bernstein said last night that two
high-ranking Soviet officials
were likely to participate in the
discussion via the satellite link,
but he declined to release the
names of the officials.
Conference organizers were
able to arrange the telecon
ference through contacts with the
Soviet summit delegation.
The symposium begins today
at 2 p.m. in Memorial Auditor
ium with opening speeches by
University President Donald
Kennedy and former National
Security Adviser McGeorge
Bundy. It represents the largest
conference addressing issues of
international security and arms
control ever held at Stanford.
Coincidentally, the symposium
will take place on the weekend
before Reagan and Gorbachev
meet in Washington, D.C., to
discuss arms control.
Symposium organizers have
attracted a number of interna
tionally renowned political and
academic figures, including
Bundy, Soviet scientist Sergei
Kapitza, former U.S. Special En
voy to the Middle East Philip
Habib and Japanese Ambassador
to the United Nations Ryukichi
Imai.
A panel discussion on "Secu
rity, Stability, and Deep Cuts,"
chaired by Drell, who is also dep

uty director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, will
follow Kennedy's speech. Panel
members include U.S. Sen.
Timothy Wirth (D-Colo.), a Stan
ford alumnus; former Under
secretary of Defense William
Perry; John Steinbruner of the
Brookings Institution; and Albert
Wheelon, chairman of the board
of Hughes Aircraft Corp.
At 8 p.m., in what may turn
out to be the most topical and
certainly the most immediate
issue raised at the symposium, a
round-table discussion of the up
coming summit and its prospects
for success will be moderated by
Warren Christopher, former dep

uty secretary of state and chair of
the Stanford Board of Trustees.
The teleconference with Ser
geyev will be tomorrow at 6
p.m., following a day's worth of
panel discussions featuring
Habib and Imai.
Symposium events conclude
Sunday with a final panel discus
sion that includes U.S. Sens.
Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.), as
well as a closing address on
"Ethical Considerations in the
Nuclear Era" by Father Bryan
Hehir of the U.S. Catholic Con
ference.
All events will be held in
Memorial Auditorium and will be
open to the public.
