# Computer team hopes to take nationals
## Programmers tops in competition 
### Angie Kim Staff writer 
Many people like to balance
their academic lives at Stanford
by singing, playing in a band,
participating in athletic events or
pursuing any number of recrea
tional activities. However, a
select group of students recently
spent some free time matching
w its with other computer wizards
in programming competitions.
For eight of these Stanford stu
dents, this year's Big Game day
didn't mean squashing Berkeley;
instead it meant winning the
Computer Machinery Program's
annual regional competition at
UC-Davis.
After taking last year's
regionals, Stanford's team of
programmers went on to beat
such competitors as Harvard,
Cal Tech, UCLA and Johns Hop
kins at the nationals to secure
their position as the best and the
brightest in the collegiate com
puter world.
This year, Stanford may be on
its way to a repeat performance,
as one team of four students con
tinued Stanford's winning streak
by taking the regional title for the
fourth consecutive year.
The other Stanford team came
in sixth place in the regional com
petition, which featured 27 teams
from California, Oregon and

Washington.
The winning team consisted of
Daniel Amnion and Mike Yang,
who are both graduate students
in computer science; Alan Hu, a
junior majoring in mathematical
and computational science; and
Sanjoy Mahajan, a sophomore
majoring in physics.
The four will go on to the na
tional competition in Atlanta,
Ga., during the last week of
February.
The victory brings significant
recognition to both the team and
the University. Team members
said the competition was fun and
rewarding despite the agonizing
hours.
"I definitely hate Pascal (a
widely used computer language)
more than ever now," Mahajan
said, adding that he was nonethe
less pleased with Stanford's vic
tory.
Although "it was a good
time," the competition was also
"six hours of hell," according to
Mahajan. "But when it was all
over, it was great. I had never
even seen any of | the other com
petitors] before, but at the end
there was such a spirit of
camaraderie."
For Stanford, the competi
tion's biggest surprise came
when the less experienced of
Stanford's two teams took first
place.

"They (the second team) were
supposed to be the team that was
going to win this contest," Yang
said. "We were kind of ignored
because we were supposedly the
worse team, but we ended up
winning instead of them."
To win such a computer pro
gramming competition, one must
program as fast and as accurately
as possible in Turbo Pascal,
using one IBM personal com
puter per team.
Each team is given seven prob
lems to solve in six hours.
Whichever team has the most
correct solutions wins, and if
more than one team has the same
number of correct solutions, the
team with the least amount of ac
cumulated time wins.
Accumulated time is calcu
lated by adding up the time taken
for each correct solution. A 20-
minute penalty is given for each
incorrect solution taken to the
judges.
Stanford's winning team had
five correct solutions with an ac
cumulated time of 1258 minutes.
Sacramento State took second
place with four correct solutions
in 632 minutes. UC Davis, the
host school, took third place with
three correct solutions in 846
minutes.
According to Sanjoy, the con
test produced a lot of stress for
the winning team members. "At

first, we were being destroyed.
We did nothing right the first
couple of hours. Then, all of a
sudden, a coincidence happened,
and we started getting all these
solutions. It was weird," he said.
"The competition is really
tough and very intense. You
have to make sure that every
thing is correct," said Tomas
Rokicki, a graduate student in
computer science who acts as
coach and coordinator for the
team.
"Adrenalin is flowing for all
six hours, and you know that 26
other teams are trying to beat
you. When you're done, you're
flyng," he added.
"During the competition, 1
was kind of wishing that 1 was at
the Big Game," Rokicki said.
"But since we won, it was
definitely worth missing.''
While some of the team mem
bers admitted that they didn't en
joy the actual programming part
of the contest, they agreed that
the desire for fame inspired them
to endure.
"The most important conse
quence in winning this competi
tion is the recognition it brings to
Stanford," Rokicki said.
"This is a big deal in the com
puter world. Stanford is looked
upon as one of the best in com
puters now," he said.

"We're going to attract a lot of
great computer minds who hear
that Stanford's winning this con
test. I heard one of the judges say
as we walked in, 'Oh, here's
Stanford. It looks like they're
going to win again,' " he said,
Last year, the national title
brought Stanford's Computer
Science Department not only
fame and recognition, but $1500
in scholarship money and an Ap
ple Macintosh development sys
tem.
"The team members got a lot
out of this experience, and they
didn't even have to spend billions
of years preparing for it, either,"
said Mahajan, who explained

that the teams were formed only
two days before the competition.'
"We had a short meeting
which not everyone attended on
Thursday, and then we went to
UC-Davis (the location of the
competition) on Saturday. We
didn't really prepare together.
We just talked a lot about it in the
car on the way over there. I'm
amazed that we did so well with
out even being prepared,"
Mahajan said.

Sanjoy Mahajan, a sophomore
majoring in physics.
The four will go on to the na
tional competition in Atlanta,
Ga., during the last week of
February.
The victory brings significant
recognition to both the team and
the University. Team members
said the competition was fun and
rewarding despite the agonizing
hours.
"I definitely hate Pascal (a
widely used computer language)
more than ever now," Mahajan
said, adding that he was nonethe
less pleased with Stanford's vic
tory.
Although "it was a good
time," the competition was also
"six hours of hell," according to
Mahajan. "But when it was all
over, it was great. I had never
even seen any of | the other com
petitors] before, but at the end
there was such a spirit of
camaraderie."
For Stanford, the competi
tion's biggest surprise came
when the less experienced of
Stanford's two teams took first
place.

"They (the second team) were
supposed to be the team that was
going to win this contest," Yang
said. "We were kind of ignored
because we were supposedly the
worse team, but we ended up
winning instead of them."
To win such a computer pro
gramming competition, one must
program as fast and as accurately
as possible in Turbo Pascal,
using one IBM personal com
puter per team.
Each team is given seven prob
lems to solve in six hours.
Whichever team has the most
correct solutions wins, and if
more than one team has the same
number of correct solutions, the
team with the least amount of ac
cumulated time wins.
Accumulated time is calcu
lated by adding up the time taken
for each correct solution. A 20-
minute penalty is given for each
incorrect solution taken to the
judges.
Stanford's winning team had
five correct solutions with an ac
cumulated time of 1258 minutes.
Sacramento State took second
place with four correct solutions
in 632 minutes. UC Davis, the
host school, took third place with
three correct solutions in 846
minutes.
According to Sanjoy, the con
test produced a lot of stress for
the winning team members. "At

first, we were being destroyed.
We did nothing right the first
couple of hours. Then, all of a
sudden, a coincidence happened,
and we started getting all these
solutions. It was weird," he said.
"The competition is really
tough and very intense. You
have to make sure that every
thing is correct," said Tomas
Rokicki, a graduate student in
computer science who acts as
coach and coordinator for the
team.
"Adrenalin is flowing for all
six hours, and you know that 26
other teams are trying to beat
you. When you're done, you're
flyng," he added.
"During the competition, 1
was kind of wishing that 1 was at
the Big Game," Rokicki said.
"But since we won, it was
definitely worth missing.''
While some of the team mem
bers admitted that they didn't en
joy the actual programming part
of the contest, they agreed that
the desire for fame inspired them
to endure.
"The most important conse
quence in winning this competi
tion is the recognition it brings to
Stanford," Rokicki said.
"This is a big deal in the com
puter world. Stanford is looked
upon as one of the best in com
puters now," he said.

"We're going to attract a lot of
great computer minds who hear
that Stanford's winning this con
test. I heard one of the judges say
as we walked in, 'Oh, here's
Stanford. It looks like they're
going to win again,' " he said,
Last year, the national title
brought Stanford's Computer
Science Department not only
fame and recognition, but $1500
in scholarship money and an Ap
ple Macintosh development sys
tem.
"The team members got a lot
out of this experience, and they
didn't even have to spend billions
of years preparing for it, either,"
said Mahajan, who explained

that the teams were formed only
two days before the competition.'
"We had a short meeting
which not everyone attended on
Thursday, and then we went to
UC-Davis (the location of the
competition) on Saturday. We
didn't really prepare together.
We just talked a lot about it in the
car on the way over there. I'm
amazed that we did so well with
out even being prepared,"
Mahajan said.
The Association of Computing
Machinery began sponsoring the
annual competition 12 years ago
in order to generate more interest
in computer science at U.S. uni
versities.

Many people like to balance
their academic lives at Stanford
by singing, playing in a band,
participating in athletic events or
pursuing any number of recrea
tional activities. However, a
select group of students recently
spent some free time matching
w its with other computer wizards
in programming competitions.
For eight of these Stanford stu
dents, this year's Big Game day
didn't mean squashing Berkeley;
instead it meant winning the
Computer Machinery Program's
annual regional competition at
UC-Davis.
After taking last year's
regionals, Stanford's team of
programmers went on to beat
such competitors as Harvard,
Cal Tech, UCLA and Johns Hop
kins at the nationals to secure
their position as the best and the
brightest in the collegiate com
puter world.
This year, Stanford may be on
its way to a repeat performance,
as one team of four students con
tinued Stanford's winning streak
by taking the regional title for the
fourth consecutive year.
The other Stanford team came
in sixth place in the regional com
petition, which featured 27 teams
from California, Oregon and

Washington.
The winning team consisted of
Daniel Amnion and Mike Yang,
who are both graduate students
in computer science; Alan Hu, a
junior majoring in mathematical
and computational science; and
Sanjoy Mahajan, a sophomore
majoring in physics.
