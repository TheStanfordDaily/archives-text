## Drama Department scores with two plays 
### Debbie Frockt 
The Drama Department's season brochure
boasts that it does not "present the standard
theatrical menu; often our work is experimental."
The department's pair of one-act plays — "The
Basement" and "Urlbsen" — validates that ambi
tious and potentially risky claim. The two plays,
playing tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday
at 2 p.m. in the Nitery, brilliantly explore the possi
bilities of alternative theater. Absolutely engaging,
the two complementary pieces combine for an ex
perience not to be missed.
Director Humphrey Gyde's interpretation of
Harold Pinter's "The Basement" — a piece written
for television — uses painfully cruel and uncom
fortable images to very successfully translate the
small screen experience into a workable, if ex
cruciating, work for the stage.
The minimalist set, consisting mainly of an over
head screen on which the stage directions are

projected, effectively guides the audience through
the chronology of the story while allowing us to
focus our attention, with very little distraction, on
the ACtOn. This method also wonderfully captures
and echoes the terse quality of Pinter's dialogue
and the structure of the play.
Without any distraction, we are immediately
drawn into Pinter's vision of the perversity of
human relationships. The play opens as two old
friends, Scott and Law, have a less-than-touching
reunion. In tow is Scott's apparent girlfriend, Jane,
who waits in the rain for her cue to enter. What fol
lows is an almost perverse exploration of
friendship, love and loneliness. More precisely, it
is an honest exploration of the perverse nature of
friendship, love and loneliness.
In either case, what struck me was not what hap
pens (because 1 was often unclear on what was hap
pening) but how the play looks and feels. Any con
fusion in the show comes from the script and not
from the direction, but that confusion actually adds

to a general effect of agitation, quite well created
by Gyde.
This quality is indicative of the entire play. Gyde
plays oft the brutality of Pinter's script by present
ing the story as a series of still, almost photograp
hic images. As the lights fade on and off we don't
concentrate so much on a continuous story line but
instead more on frozen moments of horror encaps
ulated into a single look or stance.
Credit goes not only to Gyde for his vision, but
also to the actors, who do a solid job of holding the
moments. With little dialogue to rely on, the cast
must convey much of the play's tension with highly
refined expressions, movements and interactions.
David Kurtz as Scott, Kristi Pado as Jane and Jeff
Janger as Law do a good job of this and should be
applauded for their ability to convey a story with a
limited amount of story behind it.
"Urlbsen" also delivers. I was skeptical about
this play; after all, is it possible to trust a graduate
student director attempting to adapt and perform a

play which, if it were a record, might be called
"Ibsen's Greatest Hits"? The answer is a most
resounding Yes. After seeing this, I'd be clamoring
for director David Saltz to give us more Monarch
Notes of the classics on stage.
Saltz takes on the enormous task of compiling Ib
sen's entire body of work into a single coherent
piece. He has taken lines from every play and given
us a taste of Ibsen that leaves one wanting more.
Saltz should be commended for having the
creativity to turn what could have been a motley,
incoherent melange into a workable and successful
piece.
The program claims that one need not be familiar
with Ibsen to understand the play — it simply
stands on its own. As someone with only a high
school knowledge of Ibsen, I can attest to the truth
of that statement. The lines flow smoothly and
naturally in and out of one another and make sense.
This is a wonderful experiment,
pushing the limits of coherence
but still presenting an interesting
sequence of events that involves
the audience emotionally. The
audience is not abstracted into
boredom.
There is compelling interplay
at practically every moment in
the performance. The play opens
with a conversation between the
Husband and the Wife, played by
Andrew Harker and Alicia Mil
ler. It is clear that there are deep
rooted problems between the
two, as the Husband rants about
"the space" as the wife
desperately begs her mate to lis
ten for "the silence" — the
silence which obviously fills the
space in their lives between his
obsessive rigidity of order and
appearance and her acute
feelings of loneliness and entrap
ment.
The silence contrasts mar

velously with the tones of
varying pitch Saltz uses to cue
his audience as to what play a
particular line comes from. Even
if one is unfamiliar with Ibsen's
canon, the tones are still a won
derful concept, adding rhythym
and power to the dialogue and
emphasizing the movement of
the speech.
One performance particularly
stands out. Kate Gallun as the In
sider captures the spotlight as
soon as she comes onstage. Her
statuesque frame dominates the
stage and is perhaps best appreci
ated in her scene with Harker, as
she exposes his petty weakness.
She is endearing and admirable
as she attempts to lure the Wife
from her husband. A few mo
ments later she has transformed
herself into a lasciviously leering
femme fatale whose desire and
heartache ooze onto the stage.
Everything about this works.
Both "Urlbsen" and"The
Basemen!" are packed with a
painful but vital power, and seen
together their differing styles
play wonderfully off each other.
