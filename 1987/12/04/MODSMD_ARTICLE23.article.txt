# 'Wagon' finally ready to ride
## 
### Kelly Brown 
Kincaid Jones has reason to be
relieved.
After three years of work,
Jones, a graduate student in the
Stanford Film Department, has
finally completed her degree
project, "The Red Wagon."
" The Red Wagon" is a 30-
minute film about the struggle of
a young boy to accept his par
ents' divorce. Caught in between
his parents in joint custody, the
boy, Peter, has lost interest in his
friends and school. On Christ
mas, he discovers a magic red
wagon that follows him wherever
he goes.
At first he ignores the wooden
wagon, but eventually he accepts
it, and the two become in
separable. The wagon becomes
Peter's best friend, tilling the gap
of loneliness left by his parents'
divorce. When the wagon is inad
vertently killed by some gar
bagemen, Peter's parent's realize
their neglect, and the family is
brought back together through
this loss.
"The film is about the pains of

divorce from the child's perspec
tive," Jones said. Although the
film is not autobiographical,
Jones uses insights culled from
her own experience as a member
of a broken family.
"The Red Wagon'' tells a
simple story, but getting the
movie made was not a simple
task. Countless problems with lo
cation shooting, scheduling and
the cast repeatedly delayed com
pletion of the project.
Jones recalls that one scene
took nine hours to shoot because
trains, cars, planes and barking
dogs kept breaking the needed
silence. In addition, because the
cast and crew — made up
primarily of Jones' friends and
colleagues — worked essentially
for free, she had to schedule film
ing around numerous different
personal schedules.
Jones' own schedule was com
plicated by the fact that she has
been working full time as an
editor at Lockheed Corp. That
meant more delays because most
of the filming had to be done on
weekends.
There were also problems with

the film's 13-year-old star, Matt
Hall. For one thing, as the pro
duction of the film was taking
longer than planned. Hall, as
most young bovs are wont to do,
was getting oluer. At one point,
filming was further delayed be
cause Hall got a punkish haircut.
Finally, Jones' attention to
detail meant long hours in the

editing room. The film had to be
technically perfect for Jones. In
fact, the film barely made it to its
own premiere, after having been
flown to Detroit because of tech
nical problems.
"Tne Red Wagon" project was
underwritten by a $IS,(XH) grant
from the Peninsula Community
Foundation to the Stanford Film
Department. The money was
given with the stipulation that it
be used for a fiction film.
Jones said the final cost of the
film was about $19,(MX).
Jones said she is looking to
market her movie to HBO, for
whom she once worked, and to
the Public Broadcasting
Services, the Disney Channel
and Nickelodeon.
Jones says that making "The
Red Wagon" has been a good ex
perience. That's not surprising,
given the fact that she has spent
much of her life preparing hersef
for a career in the creative arts.

Before coming to Stanford,
Jones did undergraduate work in
radio and television at the Uni
versity of Texas at Austin. At
Stanford, Jones worked under
the supervision of her adviser,
Adjunct Communications Prof.
Emeritus Julian Blaustein,
producer of "The Day the Earth
Stood Still" and "Khartoum."
Both of Jones' parents are
theater directors, and Jones her
self has been directing plays
since the age of 12. She admitted
that she chose filmmaking over
live theater primarily for the
money.
She also said that she liked
being involved with movies more
than plays because "producing a
movie gives me more control
over the final product. Filmmak
ing is nerve-racking until you're
done; then it feels great, whereas
with a play you're there every
night biting your nails wondering
whether or not it will come otf."
One of her dreams is to be on a
shoot with director Sidney Pol
lack, "to see how it's really
done."

There were also problems with

the film's 13-year-old star, Matt
Hall. For one thing, as the pro
duction of the film was taking
longer than planned. Hall, as
most young bovs are wont to do,
was getting oluer. At one point,
filming was further delayed be
cause Hall got a punkish haircut.
Finally, Jones' attention to
detail meant long hours in the

editing room. The film had to be
technically perfect for Jones. In

flown to Detroit because of tech

"Tne Red Wagon" project was
underwritten by a $IS,(XH) grant
from the Peninsula Community
Foundation to the Stanford Film
Department. The money was
given with the stipulation that it
be used for a fiction film.
Jones said the final cost of the
film was about $19,(MX).
Jones said she is looking to
market her movie to HBO, for
whom she once worked, and to
the Public Broadcasting
Services, the Disney Channel
and Nickelodeon.
Jones says that making "The
Red Wagon" has been a good ex
perience. That's not surprising,
given the fact that she has spent
much of her life preparing hersef
for a career in the creative arts.

Before coming to Stanford,
Jones did undergraduate work in
radio and television at the Uni
versity of Texas at Austin. At
Stanford, Jones worked under
the supervision of her adviser,
Adjunct Communications Prof.
Emeritus Julian Blaustein,
producer of "The Day the Earth
Stood Still" and "Khartoum."
Both of Jones' parents are
theater directors, and Jones her
self has been directing plays
since the age of 12. She admitted
that she chose filmmaking over
live theater primarily for the
money.
She also said that she liked
being involved with movies more
than plays because "producing a
movie gives me more control
over the final product. Filmmak
ing is nerve-racking until you're
done; then it feels great, whereas
with a play you're there every
night biting your nails wondering
whether or not it will come otf."
One of her dreams is to be on a
shoot with director Sidney Pol
lack, "to see how it's really
done."

Kincaid Jones has reason to be
relieved.
After three years of work,
Jones, a graduate student in the
Stanford Film Department, has
finally completed her degree
project, "The Red Wagon."
" The Red Wagon" is a 30-
minute film about the struggle of
a young boy to accept his par
ents' divorce. Caught in between
his parents in joint custody, the
boy, Peter, has lost interest in his
friends and school. On Christ
mas, he discovers a magic red
wagon that follows him wherever
he goes.
At first he ignores the wooden
wagon, but eventually he accepts
it, and the two become in
separable. The wagon becomes
Peter's best friend, tilling the gap
of loneliness left by his parents'
divorce. When the wagon is inad
vertently killed by some gar
bagemen, Peter's parent's realize
their neglect, and the family is
brought back together through
this loss.
"The film is about the pains of

divorce from the child's perspec
tive," Jones said. Although the
film is not autobiographical,
Jones uses insights culled from
her own experience as a member
of a broken family.
"The Red Wagon'' tells a
simple story, but getting the
movie made was not a simple
task. Countless problems with lo
cation shooting, scheduling and
the cast repeatedly delayed com
pletion of the project.
Jones recalls that one scene
took nine hours to shoot because
trains, cars, planes and barking
dogs kept breaking the needed
silence. In addition, because the
cast and crew — made up
primarily of Jones' friends and
colleagues — worked essentially
for free, she had to schedule film
ing around numerous different
personal schedules.
Jones' own schedule was com
plicated by the fact that she has
been working full time as an
editor at Lockheed Corp. That
meant more delays because most
of the filming had to be done on
weekends.
There were also problems with

the film's 13-year-old star, Matt
Hall. For one thing, as the pro
duction of the film was taking
longer than planned. Hall, as
most young bovs are wont to do,
was getting oluer. At one point,
