# 'Wagon' : well-made and cute
## 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
For Stanford University film
student Kincaid Jones, Wed
nesday night was probably one
of the most important nights in
her life. Jones' film, "The Red
Wagon," a film that took
nearly three years to make, had
its first public showing at the
Palace of Fine Arts Theater in
San Francisco.
The screening was attended
by over 200 people, including a
liberal sprinkling of Jones' fam
ily members, friends, cast
members, friends of cast mem
bers, members of the crew and
students from Stanford's grad
uate film program.
When the lights finally went
down and the opening credits
began to roll, it quickly became
apparent "The Red Wagon
wasn't going to be an ordinary
student film. For one thing, it
didn't have the sloppy, choppy,
cheap look that one usually

equates with student films.
In fact, Jones' film looks
very good. Fxcept for some
grainy cinematography in a few
scenes, the film has a polished,
almost professional quality.
The composition of the scenes,
the lighting and the editing are
all very well done.
The two most impressive
aspects of the film are the use
of locations and the quality of
the sound. Jones' location
shots around the Napa Valley
and Bay area are very effec
tive; the director clearly knows
that the Bay Area is
photogenic, and she uses it to
her advantage.
The sound and sound effects
have a crispness and clarity
that one usually finds only in
big-budget feature films. In ad
dition, the noticeable but un
obtrusive musical score contri
butes nicely to the overall
mood of the film.
The red wagon itself is a nifty
technical achievement. Devel

oped by mechanical whiz Jerry
Guerrero, it's a remote
controlled wagon that is able to
take a leisurely ride down Lom
bard Street as well as honk its
own horn. Most of the film's
humor comes from the actions
of the wagon.
Although 'The Red Wagon"
is a handsome film, its story —
about a little boy who befriends
a magical red wagon while
going through the pains of his
parents' divorce — is strictly
for kids. It's simplistic, con
trived and fanciful. Children
will love it, but their parents
probably will find that the char
acters are sketchily drawn, the
dialogue is artificial and the sit
uations aren't convincing.
Maybe that's too much
criticism for a half-hour film
aimed at the Disney Channel
audience, but I think Kincaid
Jones is a talented director with
a good future ahead of her.
Given better material, there's
no telling what she might do.
