## Card spikers trounce Oregon 
### Chris Cruder Senior staff writer 
There's nothing like a good dose of the
present to help people forget the past. Espe
cially if the present looks a lot brighter than
what is in one's memories.
The Stanford women's volleyball team,
which has been so close to a national title
each of the last three years, took its first step
to a sixth consecutive final four appearance
last night at Maples Pavilion. The third
ranked Cardinal dominated Oregon, swamp
ing the Ducks 15-6, 15-8, 15-4 in a first round
match in the NCAA playoffs. The Cardinal
has now reached the "sweet 16" and will
next play one week from tonight in the West
Regional tournament, to be held at Maples.
Stanford will face Colorado State in the
first of two matches next Friday. The Lady
Rams defeated USC last night 7-15, 15-8, 15-
9, 11-15, 15-12 at Fort Collins, Colo., to
qualify for regional play. The second regional
semifinal will pit the winners of tonight's
UCLA-California match and tomorrow's
contest between BYU and Pepperdine.
The Cardinal got through the first round
with almost no opposition, as the Ducks
came into the match incredibly flat. As has

been the norm this season, the Cardinal
played high-level, consistent volleyball from
start to finish, while the Ducks started slowly
and migrated further south as things got
worse and worse.
"We played pretty well," Stanford Coach
Don Shaw said after the 64-minute contest.
"We pretty much were prepared for what
they gave us, and we handled every situation
that came our way."
The key for the Cardinal was shutting
down Teri Kramer and Michele Krebsbach,
the Ducks' two big outside hitters. As has
been the case in each of the last five Stanford-
Oregon contests — all easy Stanford wins —
the Cardinal overplayed the two, rendering
them completely ineffective, and Oregon's
other players were not able to take advantage
of what was almost free reign.
The statistics tell all, as senior Kramer,
who led the nation in kills last year, finished
her collegiate career by posting a nightmarish
-.094 hitting percentage and Krebsbach, last
year's Pacific 10 Conference Freshman of the
Year, hit -.083. As a whole, the Ducks were
held below zero in hitting percentage while
Stanford hit .343.
The key to the Stanford attack was senior
outside hitter Teresa Smith. Smith led both

teams with her 15 kills and .591 hitting per
centage and tallied 12 digs. She also dis
played how much damage a jump-serve can
do by recording two service aces and causing
a lot of poor Oregon passes.
"She had a nice all-around match.' Shaw
said, adding that he felt each of his other
players also played well.
Junior Laura Olesen totaled 10 kills to go
with her match-high eight blocks. By way of
comparison, Oregon's Lauri Krejcha leads
the nation in blocking but was able to come
up with just three last night.
Olesen also added 12 digs, trailing only
senior Wendi Rush on the Cardinal. Kush,
recently named Pac-10 Flayer of the Year,
contributed heavily, as she had five kills, a
service ace and three blocks besides her 18
digs.
Shaw, who thinks his team is "getting bet
ter every day," was surprised — but obvi
ously rather pleased — at such a lopsided vic
tory over the Ducks, a team that was ranked
17th in the nation coming into the match.
"You do a good job like this-against a good
team; that's the sign of a good match, Shaw
said.

Cardinal senior Teresa Smith passes in last night's three-game thrash
ing of the outmatched Oregon Ducks as junior Amy Hayes looks on.
"We started slowly; we were
5-3 at one point . . . (but) if
you're ready for them in the
end. . ~" added Shaw, who was
named the Pac-10 Coach of the
Year.
It looks like Cardinal fans may
be able to recall memories of
1987 as the most pleasant of all.
