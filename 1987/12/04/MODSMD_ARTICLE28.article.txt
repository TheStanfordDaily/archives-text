# Hoops hosts Apple Invite

### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball
team will hold a meeting of minds
between the lines of Maples
Pavilion this weekend as it hosts
the Apple Invitational Tourna
ment today and tomorrow.
In the first game tonight the 2-2
Cardinal will meet the William &
Mary Tribe at 6:35 p.m. The
second contest, between the
Texas Longhorns and the Brown
Bruins, will begin at approxi
mately 8:35 p.m.
The teams from all four of the
well-regarded academic institu
tions will play again tomorrow,
with the consolation game begin
ning at 6:35 p.m., followed by the
championship match.
"All four of these schools rep
resent college basketball well,"
William & Mary Head Coach
Chuck Swenson said last night.
"They don't have any Proposi
tion 48 casualties. This should be

a fine tourney."
Proposition 48 is NCAA legis
lation that forces athletes to sit
out a year of competition if they
do not meet certain minimum ac
ademic requirements.
The Tribe of William & Mary,
0-2 on the year, will he trying to
upend defending Apple cham
pion Stanford. The Cardinal
defeated Alabama-Birmingham
99-80 in the final of last year's
tournament.
According to Swenson, his
William & Mary team will
definitely not resemble an aging
New England couple, as com
edian George Carlin once de
scribed the college.
"I don't like setting up against
a good defense," Swenson said.
"We try to be opportunistic and
take a quick shot if we can. On
defense we play about 95 percent
man-to-man."
The Tribe, which, according to
Swenson, took a walk down
Lombard Street in San Francisco

"to get some momentum" earlier
in the week, is led by 6-foot-5
junior guard Greg Burzell and 6-6
senior forward Mark Batzel, who
are averaging 17 and 11.5 points
per game, respectively.
Batzel said he thinks Stanford
is the team to heat in the tourney,
and that his squad has a chance
to beat the Cardinal.
"1 think we're ready to play a
good game â€” our drawback so
far is that we haven't been able to
play two solid halves," Batzel
said. "Against Old Dominion we
scored 46 (points) in the first half
and only 26 in the second."
In order to beat Stanford,
William & Mary will have to stop
Cardinal guard Todd Lichti. Mr.
Instant Offense, who moved
from forward to guard at the be
ginning of this season, has scored
31, 27 and 31 points in his last
three games.
