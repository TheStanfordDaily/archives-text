The men's swim team begins its
quest for a fourth straight NCAA
Championship today. And even
though Olympic and 11-time NCAA
victor Pablo Morales and five-time
NCAA champion Jeff Kostoff are no
longer here, the team is optimistic.
The talented squad kicks off the
1987-88 season this afternoon when it
hosts Pacific and Chico State, then
takes on powerhouse Texas tomor
row.
With five returning All-Americans
and a preseason No. 2 national
ranking, the Cardinal is definitely a
team to be reckoned with.
Stanford will be led by senior An
thony Mosse (butterfly), senior Sean
Murphy (backstroke), senior Matt
Nance (back and intermediate med
ley), junior Jay Mortenson (butterfly,
freestyle and back) and sophomore
John Witchel (freestyle) — all of
whom placed at the NCAA champion
ships last spring. The All-Americans

are joined by a number of talented vet
erans, as well as a promising crop of
freshmen.
Although Chico and Pacific are
fairly small teams with little depth,
Stanford is still looking forward to be
ginning competition and recording its
first times of the year. Stanford did
compete against California Nov. 20,
but it was a double-distance meet, so
no swimmer raced his true distance.
"Their quality doesn't compare to
us, but the meet gives us a chance to
compete and find out where we are,"
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney said.
The meet Saturday is a different
story. The Longhorns are the only
squad to defeat the Cardinal in the past
four years. The 64-49 defeat in Austin
last season stopped Stanford's dual
meet winning streak, dating back to
1982, at 46.
Texas was ranked No. I in the
preseason but has dropped to third
after a loss to Arizona State in its first
meet of the season.
"Texas is a quality team," Kenney
said. "They are always among the top

three or four squads in the NCAA."
The Longhorns will be weakened by
the loss of two of their top swimmers,
however. Doug Gjertson, the NCAA
champion in the 200-meter back
stroke, is academically ineligible to
compete, and top freestyler Chris
Jacobs has suffered an elbow injury.
Junior Andy Gill (backstroke) and
senior Spencer Martin (breaststroke)
will try to pick up the slack.
"We can defintely beat Texas be
cause we're a strong team," tri
captain Mosse said. "Its going to be an
interesting situation because both
teams are basically untested this
season."
Mosse said there should be good
one-on-one competition with the
Longhorns, especially in the middle
distance freestyle, medley relay and
backstroke events.
In addition to swimmers' scores,
divers' scores are also included in the
team tally. The Cardinal has two
divers this year — junior Matt

One of the top hackstrokers in the country, senior Sean Murphy leads the Cardinal into its
first dual meets of the season today and tomorrow.
Frawley, who qualified for the
NCAAs last season, and fresh
man Mike Burton, a high school
All-American. Kenney said the
divers' performances will be a
definite factor in determining the
outcome of meets this season.
Kenney said this year's team is
outstanding, but added that he
feels the swimmers have not yet
started to race fast in practice.
"I'm not worried about our per
formance for the whole season,
but I am concerned about the
Texas meet," he said.
Kenney said he doesn't want
to be overconfident about the
Cardinal's chances of repeating
as national champions, but
Mosse said he feels Stanford can
definitely take its fourth straight
NCAA crown.
