Excellence has its rewards,
and for the Stanford women's
basketball team paradise is the
payoff. The Cardinal, fresh off a
61-53 win at Fresno State Tues
day night that extended Stan
ford's record to 3-0, travels to
Hawaii this weekend to bask in
the sun, take a little break before
finals and play in the Hawaii
Tournament. Stanford will face
Loyola Marymount tonight in the
tournament's opening round.
The other opening-round game
pits Hawaii against Arkansas.
Winning the tournament would
seem easy enough for Stanford,
which is ranked 17th in the nation
by the Associated Press; none of
the other teams competing in the
tourney received a single vote in
this week's poll. However, the
opponents are as unfamiliar to
Stanford as they are to the pol
lsters.
"It's really an unknown,"
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer
said of the Cardinal's opponents.
"We haven't seen any of them on
tape, and since we really don't
know that much about the other
teams, we'll really just concen
trate on our own playing."
Lately, the squad's play has
been superlative, both of
fensively and defensively. In the
first three games this season, the
Cardinal has made 96-of-226
from the field for a .425 percen
tage and 50-of-68 free throws for
a lofty .735 average. Couple that
with the team's 131 rebounds, 10
blocked shots and 33 steals, it is
easy to see why Stanford has out
scored its opponents 232-207.

Most of the damage to oppo
nents has been inflicted by junior
center Jill Yanke, who was
named this season's first Pacific
10 Conference Player of the
Week for her excellent play
against Utah and BYU last
weekend. Yanke has grabbed a
team-high 34 rebounds and is
averaging 16.3 points per game to
lead the squad in scoring, just
ahead of sophomore guard Jenni
fer Azzi's 14.7 points per game
and sophomore forward Katy
Steding's 13.7.
The leading trio will have to
work a little harder this weekend
to compensate for the temporary
loss of Stanford's fourth-highest
scorer, freshman forward Celeste
Lavoie. Lavoie, who shot the
winning free throw against BYU,
did not make the Hawaii trip be
cause of a bruised spleen, an in
jury suffered in the Fresno State
game.
"We'll really miss her spirited
play and her offensive rebound
ing," VanDerveer said.
Senior forward Kami Ander
son could very well pick up most
of the slack this weekend, as she
often did last season when she
was named to the All-Pac-10
First Team. Street and Smith's
has selected her as a preseason
Honorable Mention All
- and she is due for a
landmark game after a slow start.
According to VanDerveer, the
whole team is more than ready
for a great weekend of competi
tion and has adjusted very well to
the humidity and heat of the trop
ical climate. "Hawaii seems to
agree with everyone just fine,"
the coach said in a phone inter
view yesterday.
