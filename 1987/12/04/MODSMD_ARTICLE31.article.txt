### David Earnest Staff writer 
This weekend Maloney
Field will be the site of the
Stanford 10-a-side Rugby
Tournament, one of the pre
mier rugby events in the West.
Over 60 teams — including
some of the country's finest
club and collegiate teams —
will be competing in four
men's divisions and one
women's division. The Stan
ford rugby club will field four
teams to compete in three of
the four divisions.
Stanford Coach Kahu Pere,
in his first season here, em
phasized that this tournament
will be a benchmark for the
club, which is 2-3 so far this
season.
"This tournament tells us
exactly how far along we are
compared to some of the
stronger, more experienced
teams" he said. "But we're
really not looking for any defi
nite results until next year."
The 10-a-side tournament is
designed to promote a faster
paced, more wide- open style
of play. The tournament's
rules permit only teams of 10
players to compete for each
club, instead of the usual team
of 15. Each period is shor
tened to insure an intense style
of play throughout each
match.
There are four men's divi
sions and one women's divi

sion in the tournament. Men's
Division A features many of
the Bay Area's and the na
tion's top club teams. Most of
the top collegiate and a few of
the lesser-talented club teams
comprise the field in Division
B.
Divisions C and D feature
the younger, developing teams
from many universities, as
well as a few high school
teams. A round-robin format
insures that each team plays
an equally competitive
schedule within each division.
Stanford's top rugby team
will compete in Division B. In
addition, one team will play in
Division C and two in Division
D.
Pere said he likes the tour
nament structure. "Each divi
sion provides a different level
of play for our players of dif
fering skills" he said. "The
competition helps us to better
develop our talents."
Junior Xavier Briggs point
ed out that the annual tourna
ment at Stanford is vital to the
preservation of Stanford's
rugby heritage. "It's a chance
for us to show that we are de
veloping a first-rate program,"
he said.
After being dropped from
the University's varsity pro
gram in 1977, Stanford's rugby
program is trying to establish
an endowment fund to finance
travel and to maintain quality
coaching and facilities.
