# Swimmers host two meets
## 
### Chris Cruder Senior staff writer 
Sometimes life just isn't fair.
That is probably the No. 1
thought on the mind of all the
swimmers at the University of
the Pacific as they prepare for
today's 2 p.m. meet against the
talent-laden Cardinal women's
team at deGuerre Pool.
Stanford swimmers will also be
competing Saturday and Sunday
in a seniors long-course invita
tional. The meet runs all day on
both days at deGuerre.
The Cardinal opens the 1987-
88 season returning 14 of 15 Ail-
Americans from last year's na
tional runner-up squad, including
two-time Olympic gold medalist
Jenna Johnson and siver medalist
Susan Rapp.
"They're looking real good
(right now)," Stanford Coach
George Haines said of this year's
squad. "We're going to be really
good in March (at the NCAA
Championships)."
Haines plans on having his
swimmers swim in "off" events
(events that aren't their special
ties) against a Tiger team that ap
pears to present little challenge.

The long-course meet, however,
will see swimmers competing in
their strongest events against a
field that will likely contain many
of Northern California's best.
Because it is so early in the
season and because the Cardinal
has been practicing hard every
day (rather than tapering work
outs as the meets get closer), this
weekend's meets "won't mean
anything," Haines said. How
ever, he said that to "just be able

to get in the pool," against some
non-Stanford competition will be
a welcome change of pace for the
team.
The top person to watch for
the Cardinal is Johnson, a junior.
In two years at Stanford, she has
won five NCAA titles.
Rapp, a senior co-captain, has
three individual NCAA titles to
her credit and was a member of
both the 1980 and 1984 U.S.
Olympic teams.
