# Fencing travels to Midwest
## 
### Mike Shay Staff writer 
The Stanford fencing team will be traveling to
Evanston, 111., a day later than planned.
Twelve hours before the team was scheduled
to leave for Northwestern the coaches found
that the fencers were slated to compete Saturday
and Sunday, not Friday and Saturday, as they
originally thought.
When the team does get to Evanston, it will
face a talent-laden field that includes two-time
defending NCAA champion Notre Dame.
In addition to the fencing Irish, the field also
includes Michigan State, Chicago, Ohio State,
Wisconsin and Illinois. Cal. State-Long Beach
and Air Force, two other teams from the West,
will also be in attendance.
Stanford will not be fencing either of the West
ern teams this weekend.
The Cardinal is something of a dark horse at
the tournament, Stanford women's Coach
Sherry Posthumus said. Two years ago at North
western, Stanford lost only to Wisconsin. Last
year, the team did not do as well against the
strong teams east of the Mississippi — the men's
team went 3-5 and the women's team went 4-3.
Men's coach Zoran Tulum cited the inexperi
ence of this year's team as its biggest handicap
— a handicap the team has been overcoming
quite well.
By contrast, Notre Dame will be fencing with
almost the same team as last year, Posthumus

said.
This year's Stanford team has a few very
strong returning fencers, including junior Chris
Gillen, who competed two years ago but took
last year off.
But Stanford still has a lot of new fencers. The
Northwestern meet will be the first competition
away from Roble Gym for many of them.
"Meets against harder schools provide better
experience for the future and also better results
in the future," Tulum said.
"By subjecting them to more competitive and
stronger teams the win-loss record means
more," Posthumus said. Another important fact
to consider is postseason competition.
The way in which schools are selected for the
NCAAs is becomming more subjective, Pos
thumus explained. Competing against teams like
Notre Dame, regardless of the outcome, will
give the team more experience, both in reality
and in the eyes of the NCAA selection commit
tee.
"The weakest part of the men's team is
sabre," Tulum said. Only Junior Dave Russ is a
returning member of the sabre team.
Two weeks ago at the Big Meet against Cali
fornia, the sabre team won 7-2 — not too bad for
the weak link.
The foil team is led by Chris Gillen, who
fenced at Northwestern two years ago.
"The foil team is better. We have four equal,
very good fencers," Tulum said. The foil team
also went 7-2 against Berkeley in the Big Meet.
