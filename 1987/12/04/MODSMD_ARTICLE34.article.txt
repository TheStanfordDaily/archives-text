# Card grapplers to Las Vegas
## 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
After a victorious effort against San Francisco
State Wednesday night, Stanford's wrestlers left
yesterday morning to compete in the annual Las
Vegas Tournament today and tomorrow.
This two-day affair, which pits some of the
country's finest wrestlers against each other, will
put the Cardinal wrestlers to the test.
"It's an opportunitity to compete with the best
and to see what that level of wrestling is like,"
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel said.
While nearly 45 teams are invited to the tourna
ment, most, like Stanford, do not bring all 10 of
their wrestlers with them. This year Horpel will
bring all of his wrestlers except a 118-pounder and
a heavyweight.
So many wrestlers are able to make the trip with
Stanford this year because the cancellation of a
Christmas tournament in Hawaii loosened up the
team's budget.
Josh Lisle (134-pound class), Steve Yarbrough
(158), Ron Perry (177) and Terry Mclntyre (190) are
the only veterans of the tournament. While none of
those wrestlers placed in the competition, they all
gained valuable experience that should help them
handle the tournament pressures this time around.
The Las Vegas Tournament is also a time for
"the wrestling community to get together,' Horpel
said.
Horpel will be reunited with several of his wres
tling compatriots. One of his erstwhile pupils,
former Stanford assistant coach and Olympic gold
metlalist Dave Schultz, will be in attendance at Las
Vegas. Horpel worked with Schultz when he was
wrestling at Palo Alto High School, and later at
UCLA, where Schultz wrestled for a year.
Schultz is now coaching at the University of Wis
consin at Madison, where Dave Lee, who trans
ferred from Stanford two years ago, is wrestling.
Lee is another name some Stanford wrestling
fans may remember. A former three-time Califor

nia high school state champion, Lee fulfilled his
collegiate promise at Stanford in 1985 and 1986.
During his two years here, Lee won the Pac-10
championship in his weight class twice and placed
fifth in the NCAA tournament during his sopho
more year. At Wisconsin, Lee was ranked No. 2 in
the nation this season. In Las Vegas he will face last
year's NCAA champion, Royce Alger of lowa in
Las Vegas if both wrestlers advance to the 167-
pound finals.
While most of Stanford's team is composed of
freshmen and sophomores — Mclntyre is currently
the squad's only senior, and there are no juniors
competing — Horpel remains hopeful.
"Terry and some of the returning wrestlers have
the experience, and the younger guys have the en
thusiasm to do something (in the tournament!,"
Horpel said.
Freshman Steve Buddie, at 167 pounds, and
Yarbrough both seem to be on fire. Buddie is 4-0-0
with three pins and a technical fall; while
-Yarbrough is 4-0-0 as well. With these two
wrestlers carrying winning streaks, coupled with
the experience of Mclntyre, Lisle and Perry, Stan
ford stands a good chance of earning a respectable
placing in the tournament.
Las Vegas, like the NCAA tournament, is a
single-elimination competition. If a wrestler loses a
match, he becomes dependent on the wrestler who
beat him. That man must advance to the Quarter
finals in order for the initial loser to enter tne con
solation rounds, wherein he has a chance to finish
third in the tournament if he wins the remaining
matches.
There are 32 wrestlers in each weight class, with
some classes having "pigtail brackets" before the
main rounds begin. With this structure, it is possi
ble that a competitor could wrestle five times
today, the first day of the tournament, and as many
as three more times tomorrow.
All things considered, the meet is grueling at
best, and endurance and experience become a
major factor for the wrestlers.
