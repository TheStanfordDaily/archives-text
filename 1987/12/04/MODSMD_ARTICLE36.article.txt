# Twenty-one delegates chosen
## BSU will aid southern voters 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
The Black Student Union yesterday selected a
delegation of 21 students to travel to Alabama
during the first week of winter quarter to help
blacks register to vote in the 1988 election.
Former BSU Chair Amanda Kemp, who is coor
dinating the trip, said 25 students applied to take
part in the trip, called "Project Democracy."
When the project was first announced last month,
the BSU said it hoped to send as many as 30 to 50
students.
Kemp would not release the names of the selec
ted students last night because they had not yet
been notified.
Kemp said the number of students selected for
the trip was limited by a lack of funding. The trip
has received about $20,000 in donations, $10,000
less than the BSU had hoped for, she said. Project
organizers will continue fund raising up to the time
of the trip, Kemp added.
"Fund raising has been difficult and a little frus
trating," she said. "But we have enough money

now so that it is possible to do it with some skimp
ing."
Kemp said the project has received donations
from the Anthropology Department, at least two
trustees whom she would not name, and the Wash
ington, D.C.,-based Citizen's Education Fund,
among others.
She said the four students who were not selected
will be allowed to join the trip if they pay the full
costs of their trips or if any of the 21 chosen partici
pants drop out.
"All the people who applied are good people to
go," Kemp said. "I was pleased with the quality of
the applications."
During the trip, which will take place Jan. 2-9,
students will conduct door-to-door registration in
the Selma, Ala., area; work in the offices of coordi
nating the National Right to Vote Week; and meet
.vith Southern civil rights activists.
Project organizers said the trip aims to register
some of the more than 3.5 million unregistered
black voters in the South, to rekindle the spirit of
the voter registration drives of the 1960s and to of
fer the participants an educational opportunity.
