# Latino students form new group
## Ex-member leads MEChA dissent 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
A group of Latino students an
nounced last night that they in
tend to form a new student or
ganization that will speak "more
accurately" for Stanford's Latin
o community than MEChA, an
existing student group that adv
ocates Latino causes.
At a MEChA forum called to
discuss MEChA's role on
campus, the dissenting move
ment's leader, senior Rudy
Fuentes, spoke in favor of the
creation of a broader Latino or
ganization to gain "an open vehi
cle for people to voice their
opinions."
Fuentes, a former MEChA
leader, said that the problem with
MEChA is that although "it has
never been voted on, it, by de
facto, represents the Chicano
community, which is a problem
in itself."
MEChA supporter Sandra
Viera disagreed, saying that
MEChA has "had community
forums to get input. . . . We do
want more input from people.
We are open to different stances.
Tell us what they are; we'll work
on them."
Over 40 concerned students,
about evenly divided between
MEChA supporters and the dis
senting group's supporters,
packed Casa Zapata's lounge for
what Resident Fellow Cecilia
Burciaga called "the most atten
ded (Latino) community meeting
(in Casa Zapata) in seven or eight
years."

According to Fuentes,
MEChA planned last night's
forum only three days ago in or
der to pre-empt a meeting of the
dissenters' planned for Saturday,
which was scheduled to discuss
the possibility of forming an al
ternate group.
Fuentes 1 fellow dissenters
argued that a new organization is
necessary because MEChA has
been unwilling to respond to in
ternal dissent.
Sophomore Valentin Aguirre
criticized MEChA for not
respecting all points of view in
Stanford's Latino community.
He asked, "Will you listen to
what I say? You'll let me say
whatever I want, but that doesn't
mean that you'll act on it."
Longtime MEChA member
Lucky Gutierrez, a senior,
agreed that some changes in the
organization may be necessary,
but he argued that changes
should be made within the exist
ing MEChA structure.
"MEChA has a lot of re
sources and can do a lot of
things," Gutierrez said. "Streng
then MEChA and make it
broader."
Another controversial topic
discussed at the forum was the
issue of official University repre
sentation.
Beckie Flores, siding with
Fuentes, argued that it isn't pos
sible to unite the Latino commu
nity under the present MEChA
structure. She said, "It's not fair
to MEChA and those who don't
agree with MEChA for MEChA
to be the only voice. MEChA
should not be forced to compro
mise. I don't want MEChA to be
my voice."
Junior Julie Martinez, a mem
ber of MEChA and the El Centro
Chicano staff, contended that
MEChA is often mistakenly seen
as the only voice for Stanford's
Latino community. "Organiza
tions like The Daily call and ask
MEChA for comment and refer
to us as 'MEChA, Stanford's
Chicano organization.' We are
not the Chicano organization.
MEChA speaks for MEChA, not
for the whole Chicano commu
nity."
Fuentes said his main com
plaint is that MEChA has no for
mal leaders, which results in a
lack of accountability to the com
munity it is seen to represent.
"Who can we point to as being
responsible?" Fuentes said. "No
one is there. We never know who
does what."
MEChA elects no leaders and
has no executive committee.
MEChA member Gina Her
nandez, a junior, countered
Fuentes, saying that MEChA ac
knowledges its lack of structure,
but is working on the problem.
'MEChA has no real
structure: that's a given," Her

nandez said. "But we're attempt
ing to get structure and personal
accountability."
Both sides agreed that MEChA
has done considerable good for
the Latino community and the
University community as a
whole, citing its work supporting
the grape boycott and the Rain
bow Agenda, a coalition of ethnic
minority groups that last spring

called for improvement in
minority life at Stanford.
Former MEChA member Neil
"Chili" Rojas attempted to bring
both sides together by saying,
"We can grant that MEChA is
good. The question is, how can
we make MEChA better?"
The meeting ended with both
sides agreeing to reconvene and
discuss the issues Jan. 14.

discussed at the forum was the
issue of official University repre
sentation.
Beckie Flores, siding with
Fuentes, argued that it isn't pos
sible to unite the Latino commu
nity under the present MEChA
structure. She said, "It's not fair
to MEChA and those who don't
agree with MEChA for MEChA
to be the only voice. MEChA
should not be forced to compro
mise. I don't want MEChA to be
my voice."
Junior Julie Martinez, a mem
ber of MEChA and the El Centro
Chicano staff, contended that
MEChA is often mistakenly seen
as the only voice for Stanford's
Latino community. "Organiza
tions like The Daily call and ask
MEChA for comment and refer
to us as 'MEChA, Stanford's
Chicano organization.' We are
not the Chicano organization.
MEChA speaks for MEChA, not
for the whole Chicano commu
nity."
Fuentes said his main com
plaint is that MEChA has no for
mal leaders, which results in a
lack of accountability to the com
munity it is seen to represent.
"Who can we point to as being
responsible?" Fuentes said. "No
one is there. We never know who
does what."
MEChA elects no leaders and
has no executive committee.
MEChA member Gina Her
nandez, a junior, countered
Fuentes, saying that MEChA ac
knowledges its lack of structure,
but is working on the problem.
'MEChA has no real
structure: that's a given," Her

nandez said. "But we're attempt
ing to get structure and personal
accountability."
Both sides agreed that MEChA
has done considerable good for
the Latino community and the
University community as a
whole, citing its work supporting
the grape boycott and the Rain
bow Agenda, a coalition of ethnic
minority groups that last spring

called for improvement in
minority life at Stanford.
Former MEChA member Neil
"Chili" Rojas attempted to bring
both sides together by saying,
"We can grant that MEChA is
good. The question is, how can
we make MEChA better?"
The meeting ended with both
sides agreeing to reconvene and
discuss the issues Jan. 14.

A group of Latino students an
nounced last night that they in
tend to form a new student or
ganization that will speak "more
accurately" for Stanford's Latin
o community than MEChA, an
existing student group that adv
ocates Latino causes.
At a MEChA forum called to
discuss MEChA's role on
campus, the dissenting move
ment's leader, senior Rudy
Fuentes, spoke in favor of the
creation of a broader Latino or
ganization to gain "an open vehi
cle for people to voice their
opinions."
Fuentes, a former MEChA
leader, said that the problem with
MEChA is that although "it has
never been voted on, it, by de
facto, represents the Chicano
community, which is a problem
in itself."
MEChA supporter Sandra
Viera disagreed, saying that
MEChA has "had community
forums to get input. . . . We do
want more input from people.
We are open to different stances.
Tell us what they are; we'll work
on them."
Over 40 concerned students,
about evenly divided between
MEChA supporters and the dis
senting group's supporters,
packed Casa Zapata's lounge for
what Resident Fellow Cecilia
Burciaga called "the most atten
ded (Latino) community meeting
(in Casa Zapata) in seven or eight
years."

According to Fuentes,
MEChA planned last night's
forum only three days ago in or
der to pre-empt a meeting of the
dissenters' planned for Saturday,
which was scheduled to discuss
the possibility of forming an al
ternate group.
Fuentes 1 fellow dissenters
argued that a new organization is
necessary because MEChA has
been unwilling to respond to in
ternal dissent.
Sophomore Valentin Aguirre
criticized MEChA for not
respecting all points of view in
Stanford's Latino community.
He asked, "Will you listen to
what I say? You'll let me say
whatever I want, but that doesn't
mean that you'll act on it."
Longtime MEChA member
Lucky Gutierrez, a senior,
agreed that some changes in the
organization may be necessary,
but he argued that changes
should be made within the exist
ing MEChA structure.
"MEChA has a lot of re
sources and can do a lot of
things," Gutierrez said. "Streng
then MEChA and make it
broader."
