# Latino students form new group
## Ex-member leads MEChA dissent 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
A group of Latino students an
nounced last night that they in
tend to form a new student or
ganization that will speak "more
accurately" for Stanford's Latin
o community than MEChA, an
existing student group that adv
ocates Latino causes.
At a MEChA forum called to
discuss MEChA's role on
campus, the dissenting move
ment's leader, senior Rudy
Fuentes, spoke in favor of the
creation of a broader Latino or
ganization to gain "an open vehi
cle for people to voice their
opinions."
Fuentes, a former MEChA
leader, said that the problem with
MEChA is that although "it has
never been voted on, it, by de
facto, represents the Chicano
community, which is a problem
in itself."
MEChA supporter Sandra
Viera disagreed, saying that
MEChA has "had community
forums to get input. . . . We do
want more input from people.
We are open to different stances.
Tell us what they are; we'll work
on them."
Over 40 concerned students,
about evenly divided between
MEChA supporters and the dis
senting group's supporters,
packed Casa Zapata's lounge for
what Resident Fellow Cecilia
Burciaga called "the most atten
ded (Latino) community meeting
(in Casa Zapata) in seven or eight
years."

According to Fuentes,
MEChA planned last night's
forum only three days ago in or
der to pre-empt a meeting of the
dissenters' planned for Saturday,
which was scheduled to discuss
the possibility of forming an al
ternate group.
Fuentes 1 fellow dissenters
argued that a new organization is
necessary because MEChA has
been unwilling to respond to in
ternal dissent.
Sophomore Valentin Aguirre
criticized MEChA for not
respecting all points of view in
Stanford's Latino community.
He asked, "Will you listen to
what I say? You'll let me say
whatever I want, but that doesn't
mean that you'll act on it."
Longtime MEChA member
Lucky Gutierrez, a senior,
agreed that some changes in the
organization may be necessary,
but he argued that changes
should be made within the exist
ing MEChA structure.
"MEChA has a lot of re
sources and can do a lot of
things," Gutierrez said. "Streng
then MEChA and make it
broader."
Another controversial topic
discussed at the forum was the
issue of official University repre
sentation.
Beckie Flores, siding with
Fuentes, argued that it isn't pos
sible to unite the Latino commu
nity under the present MEChA
structure. She said, "It's not fair
to MEChA and those who don't
