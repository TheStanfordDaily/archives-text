# No decision on dorm vending machines
## Condom dispensers in Tresidder likely 
### Elizabeth Howton Staff writer 
The Space and Operations Com
mittee of the Tresidder Union Hoard
yesterday gave its approval for in
stallation of condom dispensers in
some Tresidder restrooms.
Final approval by the full board is
expected early next month, accord
ing to Tresidder Board Chair Jonat
han Schwartz.
Schwartz, a junior, said passage of
the Tresidder proposal "won't be
any problem" when the board con
venes for its first meeting in winter
quarter.

Meanwhile, the Housing Opera
tions Advisory Committee (HOAC).
in its first discussion of whether con
dom dispensers should be allowed in
the dormitories, postponed a deci
sion until early next month, citing a
need to further consider guidelines
for the implementation of the dis
pensers.
Sophomore Marnie Lum, chair of
HOAC, said the issue of putting con
doms into dorms is a complex one.
"You're talking about peoples'
homes and privacy," she said. Other
student members of the committee
expressed support for the proposal
and optimism that it would pass, but

were concerned that some students
might consider the machines an inva
sion of their privacy.
Council of Presidents member
Leonard Adler said that if the com
mittee decides in favor of dispensers,
it will allow each residence to make
its own decision on the issue. Adler,
a junior, and senior Daniel Bao, di
rector of the Stanford AIDS Educa
tion Project, presented to the com
mittee a proposal in favor of dis
pensers.
Lum said she wanted to open the
issue to student input before HOAC
reaches a final decision. A survey of

approximately 400 students last
February showed strong student sup
port for dispensers.
HOAC was formed last year to
consider the housing-related issues.
Yesterday's meeting was the com
mittee's second this year.
