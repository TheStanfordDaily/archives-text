# Teller says 'Star Wars' is best defense
## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) expert Edward
Teller last night called for research and limited
deployment of a space-based anti-missile system,
and criticized the complete reliance of the United
States on mutual assured destruction as a deterrent
to nuclear war.
Teller, a noted physicist and senior research fel
low at the Hoover Institute, said he would push for
rapid deployment of a limited "Star Wars" system,
but emphasized the possibility — suggested by
President Reagan — of mutual research and simul
taneous deployment by both the Soviet Union and
the United States.
This would stop "accidental attacks and intro
duce a small doubt about the success of an
agressive attack," Teller said.
Teller advocated maintaining the present level of
SDI-related research funding, which he said was as
I percent of the defense budget.
"To put a lot of effort into retaliation and none
into defense is suicide. I would support spending
more on SDI and less on other areas in the Penta
gon," he said.

tive in a speech in the Terra House lounge yesterday evening.
Citing a 30-year Soviet head
start on development of a similar
defensive system, Teller said
"We have a situation clearly

very dangerous for [the United
States]."
He said that in 1978 "the
Soviets estimated the Moscow
(antiballistic missile) defense
would be at least 50-percent ef
fective, but they were planning
an upgrade which was estimated
to be 95- percent effective and is

undoubtedly in place."
According to Teller, the
Soviets have clearly demon
strated a belief in the workability
of a defense system by their com
mitment to research.
Teller justified SDI by saying
"better a shield than a sword,"
which is the title of his book.
