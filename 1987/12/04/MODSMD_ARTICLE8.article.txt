Reagan expects another summit
WASHINGTON — President Reagan said yesterday he ex
pects his meeting next week with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev will be followed by another summit in Moscow that would
likely "make another gigantic step" toward the elimination of
all nuclear weapons.
He also said that conservative opposition to the medium
range nuclear weapons treaty he and Gorbachev are to sign at
the White House is based on a lack of knowledge about the
treaty and that some opponents, "down in their deepest
thoughts," believe that war between the superpowers is inevita
ble.
In a White House interview conducted by four television
anchormen, Reagan said that he has not retreated from his view
that the Soviet Union is "an evil empire" — a view he ex
pressed in a speech in 1983. Thus, he said, the treaty "is hinged
on arriving at solid verification measures" to ensure that neither
side cheats on the arms reductions they agree to make.
The 30-minute interview with ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC,
broadcast last night, represented a central element in the White
House campaign to focus public attention on the summit and
dispel concerns that the arms agreement will make the United
States and its Western allies more vulnerable to attack.
With the summit's opening Monday, Reagan and his aides are
keenly sensitive to suggestions by conservatives at the bedrock
of his political support that he is giving up too much simply to
finalize a pact with the Soviet Union before leaving office.
Markets fall broadly, Dow off 72
Nervous investors, focusing on negative economic news in
stead of long-awaited cuts in overseas interest rates, sent the
Dow Jones industrial average reeling yesterday to its lowest
level since the Oct. 19 crash, renewing fears of further sharp
declines.
The 72.44-point plunge, to a close of 1776.53, represented a
drop of 3.92 percent and was the ninth-biggest single-day point
loss ever. The decline was suffered broadly, with about five
stocks falling for every one that rose on the New York Stock
Exchange. Volume was moderately heavy at 204.16 million
shares, up from 148.89 million Wednesday.
The nose dive had many analysts and traders bracing for the
possibility of the Dow settling under the 1738.74 level it was at
after the Black Monday 508-point free fall. Such a "test" of that
Oct. 19 floor has been awaited for weeks as an indicator of the
market's underlying strength.
If the Dow can hold firm above that level, it would boost in
vestor confidence and set the stage for a new rally, analysts say.
But if the Dow breaks significantly below that support level,
confidence would be so eroded that another panic selling wave
could ensue.
Lehman, E. F. Hut ton merge
NEW YORK — Investment giants E.F. Hutton Group and
Shearson Lehman Bros, formally announced yesterday a $960-
million merger that ended troubled Hutton's long struggle to
remain independent.
Shearson said that it will pay $821.9 million in cash and $139.8
million in 10-year debt securities in the deal, the largest ever
among U.S. investment firms. Officials said the definitive agree
ment, which will create the largest U.S. investment firm in
terms of capital, was reached Wednesday night about 10:30 p.m.
At a Manhattan press conference, Hutton President and Chief
Executive Robert Rittereiser insisted that the 83-year-old
brokerage was on the verge of a turnaround before the stock
market's crash drained away capital and darkened the outlook
for the retail brokerage business. Rittereiser, brought in last
year to save the faltering firm, said he was proud of his effort,
though it had not succeeded.
Referring to a starting pitcher for the Houston Astros, Rit
tereiser said he felt "a little like Nolan Ryan on one of those
days when he strikes out 12 men, gives up three hits and loses
three to nothing."
Rittereiser said the discussion that led to the deal began on the
evening of Oct. 20 — one day after Black Monday — when he
held a joint conference call with other directors of the invest
ment firm to discuss its condition. Within a few days, Rittereiser
had concluded that a sale of part or all of Hutton would be ne
cessary.
After Black Monday, Hutton had to find a partner, "rather
than have the world change on us," Rittereiser said.
Nicaraguan cease-fire talks begin
SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic — The first formal
talks aimed at a cease-fire in the Nicaraguan war opened here
yesterday under the mediation of Nicaragua's Roman Catholic
primate.
The mediator. Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, received a
four-man contra negotiating team at the headquarters of the
Catholic archdiocese here. He was to meet there later with a
Sandinista government delegation.
Obando said the initial round of indirect talks will last through
Friday. He said that he brought specific suggestions to both
sides on how to reconcile their widely divergent truce
proposals.
I he cardinal Monday proposed Santo Domingo as a compro
mise site for the talks, ending a month-long dispute between the
Sandinistas, who wanted the negotiations held in Washington,
and the contras, who insisted they be held in Central America.
The Sandinistas proposal, made three weeks ago, calls on the
contras simply to surrender, accept amnesty and return to civil
ian life. The rebels insist on major political changes in Nicaragua
before laying down their weapons.
Obando said before leaving Managua for Santo Domingo that
he would seek at least a temporary truce by Christmas even if
major issues remain unsettled.
The talks are a result of a Central American peace accord that
requires governments in the region to take all possible steps to
halt their guerrilla wars.
Haitian civil-military tensions rise
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — A general strike called by
several opposition parties failed to take hold yesterday as a
struggle arose between the military-dominated government and
civilian political forces over the creation of a new electoral
board.
Sylvio Claude, a firebrand Baptist minister who was the
Christian Democrat presidential candidate, issued the strike call
in protest of Sunday's scuttling of national elections. But with
most radio stations that might have broadcast the strike call still
off the air, the protest had no effect.
Shops and open-air markets in Port-au-Prince were jammed.
Noisy traffic jams clogged the downtown area, where violence
Sunday by soldiers and armed gangs disrupted the scheduled
vote. At his headquarters here Claude said he would issue an
other strike call in coming days.
