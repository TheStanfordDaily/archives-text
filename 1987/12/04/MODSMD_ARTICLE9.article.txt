ATLANTA — Cuban inmates
holding 89 hostages voted yestet
day to accept an agreement with
the federal government to end
their 11-day takeover of the At
lanta federal prison and free their
captives, federal officials an
nounced.
Patrick Korten, a Department
of Justice official, said that
inmate leaders called federal offi
cials at about 4 p.m. to announce
that the pact had been approved
by a majority of the detainees.
"We are waiting for word from
them concerning the timing and
manner in which they would like
to formally sign this agreement
and put an end to the incident,"
he told reporters at an open-air
briefing across the street from
the prison.
Although Korten refused to
discuss any details of the accord,
he said that it covered every
issue of concern to the Atlanta
inmates and would apply to all of

the estimated 3800 Cuban
detainees held in prisons, jails
and detention centers across the
country.
There was no definite word
from either side on when the
hostages might be released.
The inmates reportedly wanted
the formal signing to be wit
nessed by seven outside persons,
including Auxiliary Bishop Agus
tin Roman of the Miami arch
diocese, who played a key role in
ending a similar eight-day siege
at the federal detention center in
()akdale, I .a.
Moth the Oakdale rebellion,
which began on the night of Nov.
21, and the Atlanta uprising,
which began two days later, were
sparked by news of an agreement
between the United States and
Cuba to deport some of the
detainees to their native country.
Roman, a 59-year-old Cuban
born prelate, was flying to At
lanta aboard a twin-engine U.S.
Customs Service plane and was

scheduled to arrive late Thurs
day, according to sources in
Miami.
The mutinous detainees voted
on the two-page pact about two
hours after it had been approved
in Washington by Attorney Gen
eral Edwin Meese Ml and
tentatively agreed to by six
inmate leaders.
According to a message broad
cast by inmates from a loud
speaker atop the prison hospital
annex, the vote was taken alter
about two hours of debate in the
prison chapel by the 1105 Cuban
detainees at the prison.
Korten said that federal offi
cials were informed that the vote
was not unanimous, but that the
inmate leaders would enforce the
majority will on the others.
News of the outcome of the
vote came first from inmates on
the hospital annex roof. They
cheered and shouted, and blew

kisses to their wives and loved
ones standing across the street
from the prison.
Then they stood stitlly at at
tention as the Cuban national an
them was playedy over the
loudspeaker.
Wives of the hostages, who
have kept a constant vigil across
(he street, were elated by the
news.
"I'm floating on a cloud right
now," said Maltha Heredia of
Laredo, Texas. "I was getting
ready to go home because I
didn't see an end to this, but now
it looks like it's finally over."
Gladys Miranda of New York,
whose husband, Eladeo, was
among the inmates on the hospi
tal annex roof, said, "I'm glad
they did this (take over the
prison). If this hadn't happened,
they would have sent them all
back to Cuba. I'm really proud of
all of them, especially my hus
band."
