An ASSU Network for Student Groups
COP END-OF-QUARTER UPDATE
Here are some of the things we've worked on, or assisted others to accomplish.
t he best is yet to come!
• All Campus Party featuring the TUBES — Co-sponsored with the Concert Network, this was the lirst ASSU all-campus party in
many years. The success of this event paved the way for other suih events, such as the Axe Committee's "Cardinal b While Night.'
• ASSU Renovation Project—Over the summer the COl' made modifications to the renovation plans of last year that saved over
$5,000. They supervised and completed the project including installing new offices and phone lines.The new ASSU oltices opened on
schedule at the beginning of the school year.
• Condom Dispensers in Encina and Roble Gyms-Thc COP worked with Athletic Director Andy Geiger to liase condom
dispensers installed in the bathrooms ol Roble and Encina. This has paved the way for others to be installed in dorms, libraries and
Tresidder.
• Election Reform-In an arrangement reached with Santa Clara County, the ASSU used professional voting machines, enabling
faster and more accurate results than the ASSU had ever been able to deliver.
• Networking - In an effort to promote co-operation and strength among campus sectors, the COP has staged large meetings with the
Minority Communities, Women's Groups, and Volunteer Organizations.
• Student Alcohol Task Force —Because of quick action by students and ASSU personnel, we were able to head off the University's
plan to ban alcohol in the stadium.
• Student Group Office Space —Members of the ASSU have been lobbying Administrators all quarter in an effort to have student
office space expanded and improved. They have been working on a committee that will be making recommendations on long-term
plans for student office space. The re|x>rt will be released during Winter Quarter.
• University Committees-All open positions were filled by the third week of the quarter and over HO percent of student members
attended the Fall orientation meeting. A computerized reporting system was implemented this year, which enables students to easily
inform the ASSU on important issues that are coming up in their committees (like the alcohol-banning proposal)

COP END-OF-QUARTER UPDATE
Here are some of the things we've worked on, or assisted others to accomplish.
t he best is yet to come!
• All Campus Party featuring the TUBES — Co-sponsored with the Concert Network, this was the lirst ASSU all-campus party in
many years. The success of this event paved the way for other suih events, such as the Axe Committee's "Cardinal b While Night.'
• ASSU Renovation Project—Over the summer the COl' made modifications to the renovation plans of last year that saved over
$5,000. They supervised and completed the project including installing new offices and phone lines.The new ASSU oltices opened on
schedule at the beginning of the school year.
• Condom Dispensers in Encina and Roble Gyms-Thc COP worked with Athletic Director Andy Geiger to liase condom
dispensers installed in the bathrooms ol Roble and Encina. This has paved the way for others to be installed in dorms, libraries and
Tresidder.
• Election Reform-In an arrangement reached with Santa Clara County, the ASSU used professional voting machines, enabling
faster and more accurate results than the ASSU had ever been able to deliver.
• Networking - In an effort to promote co-operation and strength among campus sectors, the COP has staged large meetings with the
Minority Communities, Women's Groups, and Volunteer Organizations.
• Student Alcohol Task Force —Because of quick action by students and ASSU personnel, we were able to head off the University's
plan to ban alcohol in the stadium.
• Student Group Office Space —Members of the ASSU have been lobbying Administrators all quarter in an effort to have student
office space expanded and improved. They have been working on a committee that will be making recommendations on long-term
plans for student office space. The re|x>rt will be released during Winter Quarter.
• University Committees-All open positions were filled by the third week of the quarter and over HO percent of student members
attended the Fall orientation meeting. A computerized reporting system was implemented this year, which enables students to easily
inform the ASSU on important issues that are coming up in their committees (like the alcohol-banning proposal)
