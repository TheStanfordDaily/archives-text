How do you
wrap success?
You don't need to use a ribbon. Just tell the most
important people on your gift list you're giving them
a course from Stanley H. Kaplan.
Why not give a high school youngster the best
possible preparation for the SAT 7
Or how about treating a college student to Kaplan
confidence before a graduate or licensing exam? And
what better present for a busy executive than a Kaplan
speed reading program 7
Call us. We've got lots more "smart" gift ideas!
with Holiday Greetings
