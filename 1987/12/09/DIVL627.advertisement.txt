funding. Along with one of the most elementary tools for thinking— a door,
which leads to your own private office. All backed by management that truly
speak your language, because they probably helped write it.

on-campus interview.
Software Design Engineers
We're working on everything from compilers, operating systems, and net
working to sophisticated graphics, powerful productivity software, and more.
In fact we're working on some truly visionary ideas we can't even reveal yet.
You could be too, if you have programming experience and a background
that includes micro's, 4k C \ 8086, UNIX*/XENIX™, or MS-DOS®.
Program Managers
Instant responsibility. You select the features, you shape the product, you
design the user interface for new generations of software. Guide product
development from programming through documentation and testing. Keep
your product at the foretront of technology by knowing your competition and
product trends.

languages, or CD-ROM. II you're about to graduate with a B.S. in computer
science, math or a related major, we want to talk to you.
