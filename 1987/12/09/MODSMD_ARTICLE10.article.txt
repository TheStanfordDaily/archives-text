The Black Student Union is not discriminatory,
BSU spokesperson Dereca Blackmon said at a press
conference yesterday.
Responding to recent allegations that the BSU's
membership policy is racially discriminatory, Black
mon, a freshman, identified the BSU's "constitu
ents" as "all registered students who have identified
themselves as black or African/African American
and those students actively committed to the uplift
of black and African peoples and culture." Under
the BSU's constitution, black students are automati
cally members of the organization, while non-black
students must demonstrate their commitment to
black issues to gain membership.
According to BSU chair Bill King, the noontime
press conference in Old Union was called "to clear
up any lingering misconceptions about the BSU." In
a prepared statement read by King, Michael
Ramsey-Perez, director of Student Organization
Services (SOS), dismissed allegations of discrimina
tion in the BSU's constitution, maintaining that it is
consistent with the University's operating guidelines
for voluntary student organizations.
King also read a statement from Associate Dean
of Students for Campus Affairs Michael Jackson,
who also wrote that the BSU constitution complies
with University guidelines for such organizations.
In a prepared statement that was not read at the
press conference, Assistant Director of the Row and
Director of the Black Community Services Center
Keith Archuleta wrote that SOS "has consistently
reviewed the BSU's constitution over the years and
found nothing exclusionary about its wording." The
Stanford BSU was founded in 1967.
"The BSU has consistently worked with other
students of color and white students and student or
ganizations and has welcomed all students of any
color who wanted to work with and support the ef
forts of the BSU," according to Archuleta.
King noted that excluding students from the BSU
would only work against the organization's goals.
"We aren't here to exclude people from making
Stanford a better place. That wouldn't help the
BSU."
According to Blackmon, the BSU's membership
requirements should not be an issue. "The real issue

is racism at Stanford," she said. She noted the posi
tive role of the HSU in promoting diversity and so
cial justice on campus and in the surrounding com
munity.
Student representatives from Hillel, the Stanford
American Indian Organization (SAIO), the Asian
American Student Association (AASA), MEChA
and Students United for a Democratic Education
(SUDE) also read statements in support of the
HSU.
Sophomore Hillel representative Evan Lurie said
he came to the conference to "demonstrate a com
mitment to the ideals of HSU. which he said has no
desire to discriminate against any people.
Junior SAIO representative Willy Thompson en
couraged "white tolks (who) are so interested in
membership policies" to go to the organizations
themselves for information "instead of relying on
I he Daily to give them some humorous overview."
I he Daily last month published a Hug Me column
that discussed HSU membership rules.
