## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Dump quarter system 
### 
Having gone from midterm crunch to paper
crunch to finals, and now looking forward to a
meager two-week winter break, Stanford stu
dents cannot help but ponder the idiocy of the
University's academic calendar.
Stanford's calendar has terminal problems. If
the University is serious about the quality of the
education it provides and the quality of student
life, it should stop pretending that the quarter
system can be made to work. Stanford, as almost
every other major university has already done,
should adopt a semester calendar.
The semester system would permit a depth and
scope of sustained inquiry that a quarter's brevity
inevitably truncates. With a semester calendar,
both student and faculty interest in and apprecia
tion of a subject would no longer be hemmed in
by the short 10 weeks of the quarter.
Granted, the quarter system allows students to
take a larger number of courses. But the number
of courses taken is hardly an adequate measure of
one's intellectual development. The quarter sys
tem deceives students by pretending that taking a
lot of classes with different names is an educa
tion. The need for semesters is particularly strong
in the humanities, where neither the content nor
the style of courses is amenable to the quarter
system.

Student quality of life also cries out for a shift
from the quarter to the semester. The incessant
barrage of exams and papers that is the hallmark
of the quarter system undoubtedly exacerbates
student stress. The quarter system's three exam
periods a year — without a real Dead Week
before any of them — end up testing endurance
more than they do knowledge.
Moreover, the quarter system puts Stanford
out of sync with other universities, making it very
difficult to coordinate programs with schools on
semesters, such as UC-Berkeley or Harvard.
Most of Stanford's calendar problems are in
trinsic to the quarter system and will not disap
pear until the University adopts semesters.
However, current University scheduling goes
beyond necessity to make the worst of an already
bad system.
Until it switches to semesters, the University
should at least move quickly to make the calen
dar more responsive to student and faculty needs.
Fall classes ought to start a few weeks earlier.
Two additional weeks of vacation after a stressful
set of finals would be much more useful than two
weeks at the end of the summer, when most sum
mer jobs have ended and everyone else is already
back in school.
