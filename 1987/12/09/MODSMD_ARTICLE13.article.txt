# Groups lack definition

### 
Recent debates concerning the representative
ness of the Black Student Union and MEChA, a
Latino student group, together indicate that or
ganizations purporting to speak for minority
communities must be careful in identifying their
respective constituencies and in representing
their views.
The BSU has drawn criticism for using differ
ent membership procedures for black and non
black students. All black students are automati
cally members of the BSU, while other students
must show a "genuine commitment"' to the
group's political agenda. MEChA, meanwhile,
has been criticized from within the Latino com
munity for "not respecting all points of view"
among Latino students at Stanford.
Traditionally, minority organizations have
aimed to represent only those students who share
a defining minority characteristic. This traditional
self-identification is now becoming recognized as
both over- and under-inclusive. It is clearly non
representative: No group can possibly speak poli
tically as the exclusive voice of an entire minority
community. Ethnic and racial minorities at Stan
ford are heterogeneous, having members of dif
ferent backgrounds, politics and temperament.
The few individuals who control minority groups,
therefore, enjoy political leverage dispropor
tionate to the number of people their political
views actually represent. On the other hand,

many politically sympathetic non-minorities who
might otherwise participate are made to feel
alienated by what they perceive to he self
segregation ist practices.
Minority student groups serve an important
supportive function that is well-served by some
degree of self-segregation. However, when a
group's social role is not distinguishable from its
political activities, there is a silencing effect on
part of the group's constituency. Stanford's gay
community has recognized this potential prob
lem, and GLAS is consciously apolitical so as not
to socially alienate segments of the gay commu
nity. Another gay organization, Stanford Organi
zation for Lesbian anil Gay Equality, has
developed independent of GLAS, with a specifi
cally political mission for those gay students who
are interested, and it actively invites non-gay
membership.
The BSU and MEC'hA, as well as other
campus minority organizations, ought to consider
the experience of the gay community in evaluat
ing their respective functions. Being a social sup
port network and being a political organization
are two different things.
Full membership in a political community
should not be based on factors such as race anil
ethnicity but rather on individual beliefs and
commitment. Nor should minorities be forced to
sacrifice political autonomy for social cohesive
ness.
