# Continuing to educate
## 
### 
The University announced last week that it
may next fall begin a continuing education pro
gram, focusing primarly on the liberal arts.
Such a program is an excellent idea and long
overdue at Stanford.
Continuing education, provided that it can be
offered at a reasonable price, is a valuable service
to the community. As Vice Provost and English
Prof. William Chace, head of the Task Force on
Continuing Education, pointed out, the program
will help bridge "the invisible moat" that
separates the local community from Stanford's
classrooms.
The proposed program is particularly attractive
because its stated emphasis is the liberal arts.
Much of the continuing education that already
goes on at Stanford and other local schools is
professionally or technically oriented. A continu
ing education program for the general commu
nity should not be just a vocational training or
finishing school for middle-aged professionals.
At the same time, if there is significant commu
nity interest in and sufficient faculty available for
technical courses, then the program's organizers
should consider future expansion into those
fields.
However, in a survey conducted during plan

ning of the program, only 28 percent of the com
munity members polled expressed "definite" or
"probable" interest in technical courses, while
about 70 percent said they would be interested in
classes in art, music, drama or creative writing.
Provided the program is approved and enough
faculty members are available, classes will begin
next fall, with offerings in fields such as history,
literature, the arts, social science and introduc
tory science.
There is some concern that a continuing educa
tion program at Stanford would compete unfairly
with the programs at neighboring junior colleges.
But if the University's program is set up as pro
posed, it will likely offer a different type of edu
cation than that offered by other continuing edu
cation programs in the area.
Although there is a great deal of money to be
made in continuing education, Stanford should
not launch such a program with profit as the sole
motive. Costs, both to the University and to the
continuing education students, should be kept to
a minimum. Any profits made through continu
ing education should be earmarked to go back
into the program so it can be expanded or to go
into a scholarship fund for undergraduate and
graduate students.
