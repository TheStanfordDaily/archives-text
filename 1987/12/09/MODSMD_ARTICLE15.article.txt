MEChA coverage
sensationalized
On Friday, The Daily pub
lished a front-page article titled
"Latino students form new
group." We were surprised to see
this story was given front-page
coverage, given that so many
other activities of the Chicano
community go unnoticed by The
Daily.
This sensationalist and inac
curate portrayal of our commu
nity meeting seems to suggest that
The Daily is more interested in
getting a good headline than in
accurately reporting what goes on
in the University community. The
fact that this article comes only
three days after another sen
sationalist headline attacking the

BSU suggests that The Daily has
taken upon itself to exaggerate
controversies about students of
color on campus. This raises
serious questions as to The
Daily's commitment to responsi
ble journalism.
We are writing this letter to
correct the distortion about what
actually happened at the Dec. 3
Chicano community forum. The
forum was called by MEChA as
an educational presentation
about what the role of MEChA in
our community has been and to
have a public consultation about
what issues MEChA should take
up for the rest of the school year.
Many people, MEChA members
and non-members, commended
the role MEChA has played in
making the voice of Chicano stu
dents heard on campus.
Contrary to what The Daily re

ported, there was no such thing as
an "anti-MEChA movement"
emerging at that meeting, nor was
any new group formed as an
"alternative." A few people ex
pressed reservations about
MEChA's ability to serve as the
representative body for the
Chicano community, and some
did suggest the possibility of cre
ating another group for people
who do not want to work in
ME< hA.
Since no vote was taken for or
against MEChA, and since only
six or seven people spoke criti
cally of it. we wonder where the
reporter came up with the idea
that the meeting was "evenly
divided between MEChA sup
porters and dissenting groups."
We feel that MEChA has been
and will continue to be open to
constructive criticism from other

students. The specific question*
individuals raised at the forun*
will probably be discussed tot
some time to come. Obviously, it
they desire, they are free to form
their own organization. If this or
ganization takes up issues pertin
ent to our community, it is
probable there will be much over
lap between this new group and
the present MF.ChA. However,
we feel The Daily is doing a great
disservice to Stanford by focusing
on the controversial aspects of
one particular forum rather than
giving a more complete picture of
the many events and activities of
a very dynamic and united com
munity.
