# Environment in jeopardy
## 
### 
One emerging shibboleth of the presidential
campaign is "growth." Some kinds of growth obvi
ously are good. It is good when we figure out better,
cleaner, faster ways of doing things. But there is
nothing good about using up our natural resources
faster or polluting the Earth.
Throughout the Reagan years the "pro-growth"
label has merely been a cover for "anti
responsibility." Environmental protections impose
costs on business. They slow business growth. In the
name of "growth," the Reagan administration
declared war on environmental protections. James
Watt as secretary of the Interior and Anne Gorsuch
at the Environmental Protection Agency were ap
pointed generals.

Watt was a religious fundamentalist who testified
before Congress that we might as well use up the en
vironment now because Armaggedon was coming in
our lifetime anyway. Reagan's preoccupation with
biblical prophecy is well-known. Whether one attri
butes his war on the environment to this fascination
or to the usual "conservative" approbation of greed
makes no difference. The results are the same.
Reasonable people used to be concerned about
the population explosion. Now our government is
against family planning throughout the world. De
mographics is still the most powerful force on Earth,
yet we won't even deal with the demographics of
poverty in our own country. For every kid who gets
no education and for every child who has a child
there will be untold costs to pay. Yet we sell the fu
ture short for a few dollars today.
Again, the religious fundamentalism of the
Reagan right looms large. "Go forth and multiply,"
the fundamentalists urge. Whatever ensues is God's
will. They love to see things coming to a head. What
the rest of us would see as the brutal end of a short
lived species the fundamentalists look forward to as
the day of salvation.
And a lot of things are coming to a head.
Reagan's mountain of fiscal debt, devastating as it
may be, is only the flagship of his, and our, irrespon
sibility. It is the tip of the iceberg of the real debt we
have run up. Most threatening are two pending en
vironmental crises: the warming of the Earth due to
the greenhouse effect and the breakdown of the
ozone layer due to the release of chlorofluorocar
bons (CFCs).

We have known for a decade that CFCs rise
slowly to the top of the atmosphere, where a single
CFC molecule may destroy thousands of ozone
molecules. Ozone is what blocks the sun's highest
energy radiation from reaching the surface of the
Earth. CFCs are a big industry. Billions of pounds
are produced every year for use in foams, refrigerat
ing systems and many other products. Every year.
400 kilotons are released into the atmosphere.
Twenty years from now, to lay out in the sun will
be to have your skin cells exploded by the hundreds.
That fate is already sealed. The only question is for
how many decades it will last. Stopping the damage
will require global leadership. The Reaganauts have
not only eschewed such leadership, they have been
ideologically opposed to it because environmental
protections are "anti-growth." Seven critical years
have already been wasted.
The greenhouse effect is even worse. Pollutants in
the atmosphere trap heat that would otherwise
escape into space, causing the temperature of the
Earth's surface to rise. This too is already taking
place. Further, it has the potential to feed off itself
as warmer temperatures draw water vapor into the
atmosphere, where it exacerbates the greenhouse
effect. The territory is uncharted. All we know for
sure is that we are going to crash on a reef. Yet our
government ignores the situation, and so do we.
To combat the greenhouse effect we will have to
stop most of the world's air pollution and regrow the
Earth's forests to bind the carbons that pollute the
air. If we are going to favor growth it must be real
growth â€” growth that takes into account the debts
incurred, not this cancerous, distending "growth"
that looks only at profits today.
Some of the Democratic candidates could be
pretty good. All of them are for investing in educa
tion, at least. Albert Gore has been a leader in the
Senate on trying to cut CFC production, on the
greenhouse problem and on other environmental is
sues. The Republican candidates, unfortunately,
must all vie for the support of the irrational right. If
any of them are capable of rationality we won't see
it until after the Republican convention, but I am
not optimistic.
Of all these pressing problems, Reagan has come
to grips with none of them. With his happy talk and
his "pro-growth" anti-responsibility he has lulled
the moral fiber of a nation that needs to face reality.
He has slandered the '60s generation that was will
ing to sacrifice for the environment, and he has
glorified waste.
We have followed Reagan down the garden path
long enough.
