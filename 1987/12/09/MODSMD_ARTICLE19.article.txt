## BSU needs autonomy 
### 
I he ideal of a "colorblind" society, as expressed
by Michael Ciinn's viewpoint (Daily, Dec. 3) is one
that at first glance may strike some as appealing.
Upon a deeper examination, however, it is clear that
Ginn's ideal is one based on an assumption that
equality for all in our society can only be gained by
ignoring all ethnic and cultural distinctions.
His neo-liberal analysis of socioeconomic in
equities presumes that all goods (individuals) are
equal and being traded upon a free market
(society). One only needs to look around to deter
mine that this mode of analysis functions neither for
our economic system nor for our society. The
"markets" of our society are not free, nor do all in
dividuals have equal access to the market.

l his false assumption is what underlies the recent
attacks upon the Black Student Union (BSU), re
flecting a basic misunderstanding of the role of
whites in fighting racism, as well as of the historic
pattern of the failure of attempts to include whites
in black organizations.
We are writing as white students who are con
cerned about and working on the issue of racism and
are addressing this letter to white students who may
not understand the need for a BSU. The debate in
The Daily over the specifics of the BSU's member
ship policy for non-blacks focuses the debate on the
wrong issue: The real issue is why it is important for
black students to have an autonomous political
voice for their community.
Because we cannot fully understand the experi
ence of blacks oppressed by racism, we must respect
black leadership on issues that concern them. We
feel that as white students we can best fight racism
not by joining the BSU but by working through Stu
dents United for a Democratic Education and by
joining BSU efforts in coalition on issues of racism.
As white students, the fact is that we cannot fully
understand or identify with the experience of rac
ism. Well-intentioned white students may listen to
and strive to understand as best they can the experi
ence of African Americans, but our understanding
is limited by the fact that we do not know what it is
like to live every day as a black person in this society
or this university.
In the early 19605, the Student Nonviolent Coor
dinating Committee (SNCC), formed by black stu
dents who started the wave of lunch counter sit-ins
in the South, sought initially to include both whites
and blacks in its organization. After years of strug
gling to overcome such problems as whites dominat
ing meetings and whites having unconscious
patronizing attitudes toward blacks. SNCC decided
to ask their white members to leave.

SNCC realized that to foster black pride and
identity, their organization needed to be structured
around blacks organizing blacks to avoid the same
limitations placed on them in the wider society.
After this experience, many black students across
the country began organizing autonomous black
student unions.
History has taught that there needs to be an au
tonomous political voice for the black community,
and African Americans have taken this role upon
themselves. This need derives from the unequal
power among races and ethnic groups in our
country. In order to be able to work together, we
and people of color must come together on a basis
of equality and mutual respect.
Separate organizations empower those who have
historically been discriminated against to define
their own needs without the interference of those
who oppress them in the outside society. Unlike the
situation for whites, the only means that our society
affords Third World people to combat their oppres
sion are organizations like the BSU. It is a fact that
our society's institutions, from television to schools,
are structured to facilitate and perpetuate white
access to economic and political power. This is why
we do not have a White Student Union or a white
theme house. We do not need them. Every aspect of
the Stanford experience is geared to suit our needs
as whites.
None of this should be construed to mean that
whites have no role in fighting racism or that the
BSU has ever said that it does not want to work with
white students on this issue. We feel that fighting for
a society based on equality between races is in the
interests of all people, and it is everybody's respon
sibility to work toward this goal. We have worked
on the Western Culture issue this quarter and have
had joint meetings, events and demonstrations with
the BSU and other Third World student organiza
tions. We respect the leadership of these communi
ties on issues of racism and know from our experi
ence that separate organizations do not "separate
the races," but instead facilitate working together
on a more equal footing.
The raising of this issue, when there has been no
complaint by any non-black student about being ex
cluded from the BSU, is clearly The Daily's attempt
to foment controversy where there really is none.
Critics of the BSU claim they are trying to defend
the rights ol white students who want to work on is
sues of black liberation, but the real result of their
attacks is outside determination of BSU member
ship policies. We feel that all those who question the
BSU's policies should look for information beyond
the pages of The Daily, and instead of immediately
going on the attack, should strive to listen to and un
derstand the need tor autonomous organizations for
students of color.
