# Board adopts CIR policy
## Trustees discuss divestment, on-campus townhouses 
### Steve Kasierski Erin Martin Senior staff writers 
The University Board of Trus
tees yesterday broadened its
South African divestment policy
and approved a preliminary pro
posal to build 332 townhouse
units and a senior citizens'
residence complex on the west
side of campus.
The board also discussed
former University President
Richard Lyman's intention to
return to Stanford as director of
the newly formed Institute of In
ternational Studies (IIS).
The board approved two
amendments to the University's
present divestment policy recom
mended by the Commission on
Investment Responsibility (CIR).
The CIR, a 12-member group
of faculty, staff, students and
alumni, advises the trustees on is
sues of divestment from compan
ies with financial holdings in
South Africa.
The first of the two divestment
amendments requires that the
trustees not expand the Univer
sity's business relationship with a
company once the CIR has rec
ommended divestment from that
firm.
The second amendment calls
for University divestment from

companies with direct sales of
non-educational and non-human
itarian goods and services to
agencies that perpetuate apart
heid.
The CIR will continue its policy
of contacting companies to give
them the opportunity to demon
strate that their dealings do not
support apartheid. The CIR may
then recommend to the board
that Stanford divest from the
company if the evidence offered
by the company is deemed insuf
ficient.
According to Asst. Director of
University Relations Diana Dia
mond, who is also a staff member
of the trustees' Special Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility
(SCIR), the CIR amendments
were accepted in the form the
CIR had submitted them, with
only slight alterations. The SCIR
is a committee of the trustees es
tablished to examine divestment
issues.
In other business, the board
£ave its tentative support to locat
ing a 332-unit townhouse project
and a 450-unit senior citizens' de
velopment on 72 acres at the site
of the old Children's Hospital
bordering Oak Creek Apart
ments, Sand Hill Road, Ronald
McDonald House and San Fran
cisquito Creek.
Very preliminary estimates by

the University suggest that
phased construction of the two
projects over a seven-year period
will cost more than $80 million.
According to the plan, any pro
posed building will be set back
from San Francisquito Creek and
a nearby 12-acre archaeological
preserve.
The University will lease the
townhouses, giving residence
priority to faculty, staff, students,
special groups related to aca
demic programs and alumni, in
that order.
The townhouses will be three
or four-story units with under
ground parking structures.
University officials believe the
project will reduce long-distance
commuting by Stanford employ
ees through nearbv communities.
If the supply of units in the
early years of the project exceeds
demand by those with priority,
units could be leased to the gen
eral public.
The senior citizens' complex
could include 200 large apart
ments, 250 congregate care units
and a 100-bed skilled nursing fa
cility.
Although the townhouses will
be developed by Stanford, the
board authorized University Vice
President for Business and
Finance William Massy to seek
proposals from outside develop
ers for the senior citizens' project.
The proposal approved yester
day will have less than half the
density of an initial 46-acre,
1200-unit Stanford West project
that has been the subject of
design and feasibility studies since
June 1982. The original project
was approved by the City of Palo
Alto in 1983, but with restrictions
unacceptable to the University.
Lyman. 64, who was University
president from 1970 to 1980, will
take the helm at lIS Sept. 1,
1988. As director, he will oversee
several existing research pro
grams, including the Center for
International Security and Arms

Control, the Project on U.S.-
Mexico Relations and the Brazil
Project, as well as existing area
studies.
According to Alexander Dal
lin, a history and political science
professor and a member of the
search committee that selected
Lyman, the new institute is an at
tempt to coordinate "a variety of
programs in the international
field that have been proliferating
without direction."
Lyman, who has served as pres
ident of the Rockefeller Founda
tion since leaving Stanford in
1980, will also be able to work
with school deans to develop in
terdisciplinary curricula at the un
dergraduate and master's degree
levels.
"Interdependence is a popular
buzzword (in discussing interna
tional questions), but real under
standing of what it means and will

mean to us, economically, politi
cally and culturally, is still lack
ing," Lyman said.

The University will lease the
townhouses, giving residence
priority to faculty, staff, students,
special groups related to aca
demic programs and alumni, in
that order.
The townhouses will be three
or four-story units with under
ground parking structures.
University officials believe the
project will reduce long-distance
commuting by Stanford employ
ees through nearbv communities.
If the supply of units in the
early years of the project exceeds
demand by those with priority,
units could be leased to the gen
eral public.
The senior citizens' complex
could include 200 large apart
ments, 250 congregate care units
and a 100-bed skilled nursing fa
cility.
Although the townhouses will
be developed by Stanford, the
board authorized University Vice
President for Business and
Finance William Massy to seek
proposals from outside develop
ers for the senior citizens' project.
The proposal approved yester
day will have less than half the
density of an initial 46-acre,
1200-unit Stanford West project
that has been the subject of
design and feasibility studies since
June 1982. The original project
was approved by the City of Palo
Alto in 1983, but with restrictions
unacceptable to the University.
Lyman. 64, who was University
president from 1970 to 1980, will
take the helm at lIS Sept. 1,
1988. As director, he will oversee
several existing research pro
grams, including the Center for
International Security and Arms

Control, the Project on U.S.-
Mexico Relations and the Brazil
Project, as well as existing area
studies.
According to Alexander Dal
lin, a history and political science
professor and a member of the
search committee that selected
Lyman, the new institute is an at
tempt to coordinate "a variety of
programs in the international
field that have been proliferating
without direction."
Lyman, who has served as pres
ident of the Rockefeller Founda
tion since leaving Stanford in
1980, will also be able to work
with school deans to develop in
terdisciplinary curricula at the un
dergraduate and master's degree
levels.
"Interdependence is a popular
buzzword (in discussing interna
tional questions), but real under
standing of what it means and will

mean to us, economically, politi
cally and culturally, is still lack
ing," Lyman said.
The University Board of Trus
tees yesterday broadened its
South African divestment policy
and approved a preliminary pro
posal to build 332 townhouse
units and a senior citizens'
residence complex on the west
side of campus.
The board also discussed
former University President
Richard Lyman's intention to
return to Stanford as director of
the newly formed Institute of In
ternational Studies (IIS).
The board approved two
amendments to the University's
present divestment policy recom
mended by the Commission on
Investment Responsibility (CIR).
The CIR, a 12-member group
of faculty, staff, students and
alumni, advises the trustees on is
sues of divestment from compan
ies with financial holdings in
South Africa.
The first of the two divestment
amendments requires that the
trustees not expand the Univer
sity's business relationship with a
company once the CIR has rec
ommended divestment from that
firm.
The second amendment calls
for University divestment from

companies with direct sales of
non-educational and non-human
itarian goods and services to
agencies that perpetuate apart
heid.
The CIR will continue its policy
of contacting companies to give
them the opportunity to demon
strate that their dealings do not
support apartheid. The CIR may
then recommend to the board
that Stanford divest from the
company if the evidence offered
by the company is deemed insuf
ficient.
According to Asst. Director of
University Relations Diana Dia
mond, who is also a staff member
of the trustees' Special Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility
(SCIR), the CIR amendments
were accepted in the form the
CIR had submitted them, with
only slight alterations. The SCIR
is a committee of the trustees es
tablished to examine divestment
issues.
In other business, the board
£ave its tentative support to locat
ing a 332-unit townhouse project
and a 450-unit senior citizens' de
velopment on 72 acres at the site
of the old Children's Hospital
bordering Oak Creek Apart
ments, Sand Hill Road, Ronald
McDonald House and San Fran
cisquito Creek.
Very preliminary estimates by

the University suggest that
phased construction of the two
projects over a seven-year period
will cost more than $80 million.
According to the plan, any pro
posed building will be set back
from San Francisquito Creek and
a nearby 12-acre archaeological
preserve.
The University will lease the
townhouses, giving residence
priority to faculty, staff, students,
special groups related to aca
