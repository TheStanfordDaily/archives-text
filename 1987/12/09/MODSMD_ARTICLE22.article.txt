Assign parking by
need, not by price
I am responding to the col
lective and appalling egocen
tricity displayed by the authors of
"Permit prices should be raised"
and "Grads bankrolling under
graduates" (Daily, Dec. 3). The
authors of both letters fail to ac
knowledge one simple fact: Many
Stanford undergraduates lured
into enrolling by the promise of
an excellent opportunity funded
by a "reasonable" financial aid
package did not receive one
beyond freshman year. We have
the opportunity, not the funds.
In light of this fact, the pom
pous claim that Stanford graduate
students are somehow above
paying ASSU fees and "bank
rolling undergraduates" is noth
ing short of ludicrous, as is the
concept of increasing the cost of
parking permits.
While I am certain many grad
uate students are just as finan
cially strapped, they surely must
know that undergraduate tuition
is more than $15,000 a year and
that it pays for the very facilities
that graduate students here on
endowments are using for a much
smaller fee. Graduate students
should have as big an interest in
organizations designed to better
student life as undergraduates
and not balk at paying for them.
Along this line, the concept of
increasing the price of parking

permits is totally ignorant. Some
of us who live off campus and
really "need and value" parking
places can barely pay for them as
it is, and the ones we can obtain
are located in recesses of campus
that are totally unsafe at night.
Why not give parking permits (at
the same price) only to those who
can prove a need. If you do not
live off campus, you have no need
to obtain a permit that lets you
park near the Ouad, for example.
If "the last vestige of injustice
in the Stanford community" is to
be eliminated, certain people
need to demonstrate their eco
nomic expertise and notice the
economic diversity of Stanford
students.

Food Service not
taking SIDO funds
The members of the Stanford
International Development Or
ganization (SIDO) would like to
thank all of the students who par
ticipated in the fast held Nov. 20
and all of the other people who
supported our effort through per
sonal donations, help with
publicity and most importantly
through their enthusiasm in
taking a step toward ending world
hunger.
The fast raised $3333 from the
almost 1000 students turning in
meal cards, and we are still col
lecting money from non-Food

Service houses. We expect the
final total to be near $3750, all of
which will be used for develop
ment projects.
We would also like to clarify an
issue that has bothered many stu
dents. A letter to The Daily,
printed on the day of the fast,
claimed that turning in a meal
card was, in effect, a donation to
Food Service, since they give
SI DO only a part of the money
that students have paid for their
meals. Food Service does this be
cause although many students
are not eating, they must still
keep the dining halls open for
those who choose not to fast, and
they must pay the cooks, hashers
and other employees at the nor
mal rates.
Food Service does contribute
the 33 percent of board costs that
is actually spent on food, and
SI DO receives the full dollar
value of donated points from stu
dents on the point system. We
would, of course, be overjoyed if
Food Service gave us the full
amount that students are charged
per day, or if students chose not
to turn in their meal cards for the
fast but instead sent us the money
they would have spent on a pizza
or a trip to the Corner Pocket.
Still, there is a lot that can be
accomplished with the money
that has been raised, and we hope
to be even more successful when
we repeat the fast in the spring.

Assign parking by
need, not by price
I am responding to the col
lective and appalling egocen
tricity displayed by the authors of
"Permit prices should be raised"
and "Grads bankrolling under
graduates" (Daily, Dec. 3). The
authors of both letters fail to ac
knowledge one simple fact: Many
Stanford undergraduates lured
into enrolling by the promise of
an excellent opportunity funded
by a "reasonable" financial aid
package did not receive one
beyond freshman year. We have
the opportunity, not the funds.
In light of this fact, the pom
pous claim that Stanford graduate
students are somehow above
paying ASSU fees and "bank
rolling undergraduates" is noth
ing short of ludicrous, as is the
concept of increasing the cost of
parking permits.
While I am certain many grad
uate students are just as finan
cially strapped, they surely must
know that undergraduate tuition
is more than $15,000 a year and
that it pays for the very facilities
that graduate students here on
endowments are using for a much
smaller fee. Graduate students
should have as big an interest in
organizations designed to better
student life as undergraduates
and not balk at paying for them.
Along this line, the concept of
increasing the price of parking

permits is totally ignorant. Some
of us who live off campus and
really "need and value" parking
places can barely pay for them as
it is, and the ones we can obtain
are located in recesses of campus
that are totally unsafe at night.
Why not give parking permits (at
the same price) only to those who
can prove a need. If you do not
live off campus, you have no need
to obtain a permit that lets you
park near the Ouad, for example.
If "the last vestige of injustice
in the Stanford community" is to
be eliminated, certain people
need to demonstrate their eco
nomic expertise and notice the
economic diversity of Stanford
students.

Food Service not
taking SIDO funds
The members of the Stanford
International Development Or
ganization (SIDO) would like to
thank all of the students who par
ticipated in the fast held Nov. 20
and all of the other people who
supported our effort through per
sonal donations, help with
publicity and most importantly
through their enthusiasm in
taking a step toward ending world
hunger.
The fast raised $3333 from the
almost 1000 students turning in
meal cards, and we are still col
lecting money from non-Food

Service houses. We expect the
final total to be near $3750, all of
which will be used for develop
ment projects.
We would also like to clarify an
issue that has bothered many stu
dents. A letter to The Daily,
printed on the day of the fast,
claimed that turning in a meal
card was, in effect, a donation to
Food Service, since they give
SI DO only a part of the money
that students have paid for their
meals. Food Service does this be
cause although many students
are not eating, they must still
keep the dining halls open for
those who choose not to fast, and
they must pay the cooks, hashers
and other employees at the nor
mal rates.
Food Service does contribute
the 33 percent of board costs that
is actually spent on food, and
SI DO receives the full dollar
value of donated points from stu
dents on the point system. We
would, of course, be overjoyed if
Food Service gave us the full
amount that students are charged
per day, or if students chose not
to turn in their meal cards for the
fast but instead sent us the money
they would have spent on a pizza
or a trip to the Corner Pocket.
Still, there is a lot that can be
accomplished with the money
that has been raised, and we hope
to be even more successful when
we repeat the fast in the spring.
