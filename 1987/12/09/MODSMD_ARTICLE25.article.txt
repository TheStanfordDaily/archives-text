## Ethics in business courses fight 'money culture' 
### Surah McCraw Staff writer 
"Making money and the activi
ties related to money are the
driving forces of our society
today," New York investment
banker Felix Rohatyn said in a
commencement address last June
at Long Island University.
"The pursuit of wealth and
power is so pervasive today as to
create something that may be en
tirely new â€” namely, a money
culture" in American society, said
Rohatyn, a senior partner at the
investment banking firm Lazard
Freres.
Whether or not such a money
culture actually exists today, the
effects of the insider trading scan
dal of a year ago and the stock
market crash in October have
reached beyond Wall Street.
"Insider trading isn't new,"
Dean of Stanford Business School
Robert Jaedicke said. "But it's
come out in a form and intensity
we haven't seen before. You have
to step back and say, 'What does
it mean?' "
One of the things it means is
that ethics and ethics classes are a
hot topic in business schools
today.
Last year, former Securities
and Exchange Commission
Chairman John Shad gave $20
million to Harvard Business
School. The gift was to be
combined with others to create a
$30-million endowment for a
program called "Business Lead
ership and Ethics."

The news media have treated
this endowment as a prime exam
ple of the trend toward teaehing
business ethics in American busi
ness schools.
While the Stanford Business
School has no such endowment, it
does have Kirk Hanson, a lec
turer who is considered by his col
leagues at other business schools
to be a a national leader in the
teaching of business ethics.
Hanson teaches an elective
course called Ethical Dilemmas in
Management to Stanford's sec
ond-year business students.
About 20 percent of each class
at the Business School takes the
course, in which Hanson teaches
students how to think about eth
ics. Defining a set of values and
then communicating them, Han
son said, is the best way for a
manager to approach ethical
dilemmas.
The class benefits from the fact
that Hanson spends about half of
his time consulting with busi
nesses. Working with corpora
tions to help them define their
values, he said, is the best kind of
field research for teaching busi
ness ethics.
"It's a really valuable course,"
said Gus Schwed, a second-year
student taking the course this fall.
"It exposes you to predictable
ethical dilemmas that you're
likely to face (as a manager),"
Schwed said. "It provides you
with an analytical framework that
makes it much easier to recognize
ethical dilemmas."
In addition to having the option

of taking Hanson's class, Stanford
MBA students are required to
participate in ethics workshops
before classes begin the first year.
They must also take a course
called Business and the Changing
Environment; about one-fourth
of the material in that class deals
with ethics, Hanson said.
However, the Business and the
Changing Environment course

"doesn't adequately address eth
ics," said Bill Patzer, a second
year student who will return to in
vestment banking next year. "I
think everyone should take
[Hanson's class]," said Patzer,
who is currently enrolled in the
course himself.
Patzer said, "[ln Hanson's
class] you try to put yourself in
positions you'll probably be faced

with later. I'm hoping that when
they come up I'll recognize them
and have the tools to deal with
them."
According to a recent study by
the Ethics Resource Center in
Washington, 92 percent of ac
credited business schools said
they included business ethics in
their curriculum. Only 21 per
cent, however, offered a separate
course in ethics. And of those,
only 6 percent required all stu
dents to take that course.
Stanford, because it offers a
separate ethics course, is unusual
among business schools.
"You'd probably find a differ
ence of opinion about whether to
single out ethics in one course" or
to address ethical topics as only a
part of standard course offerings,
Jaedicke said.
At Stanford, "We don't argue.
We just try to offer both," he
added.
"[Ethics] doesn't come up as
much as it should in other
courses, Schwed said. "It would
be very useful to learn how ethi
cal issues arise in a particular
topic [such as marketing]."
Yet, while most students be
lieve that ethics is an important
topic in business today, some say
business school isn't the proper
place to teach ethics.
"Business schools are always
criticized for not teaching ethics
or morals," said Kevin Martin,
Dean of Students at the Univer
sity of Chicago's business school.
"You can't teach (students)
morals when they're 26, 27 vears

old. If you think that teaching an
ethics course will change a per
son's morality, you're naive," he
explained .
About 20 percent of business
schools, according to Hanson,
have ideological objections to
teaching ethics. Included in this
group are the University of
Chicago, UCLA, MIT and the
University of Rochester, he said.
University of Vermont Provost
John Hennesey said he disagrees
that ethics cannot be learned
beyond the college level. "My
teaching experiences have led me
to conclude that ethics can be
taught," Hennesey said.
"One can lead students to a
sharper appreciation of ethics and
the vocabulary, concepts and im
agination to deal with business
ethics. So practicing ethics in the
classroom becomes very desira
ble," he said.
In a class he developed with
Dartmouth Religion Prof. Ronald
Green, Hennesey teaches stu
dents to use moral philosophy to
attack management dilemmas.
"You can't teach students
virtue or character, but to fail to
offer business ethics seems to be
taking a very high risk," Hen
nesey said. "If faculty members
brush it aside in their classes,
that's wrong."
While other schools, like
Northwestern's Kellogg School of
Management, offer no specific
ethics classes, ethical issues still
crop up in many courses, accord
