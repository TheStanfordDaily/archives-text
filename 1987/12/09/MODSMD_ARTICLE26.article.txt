# Bug visits Bloom County
## The
						intrepid one also figures out the flaws in Flicks

Dear Bug Me,
On Tuesday, Nov. 24, The Daily and the San
Jose Mercury News published different versions of
"Bloom County." In the Mercury News version, a
geeky single guy was desperately seeking a waffle
iron through the personal ads. In the Daily's ver
sion, he was seeking gerhils. Which version is the
original? Why did the paper that put in the change
do so?
-A Bloom County fan

The Daily is one of the few newspapers in the
country — if not the only one — that printed the
version of "Bloom County" with "gerbils" instead
of "a waffle iron." Is this because The Dailv is a

newspaper with an historic penchant for journalistic
honesty? No! It is because we have a lousy mail sys
tem.
According to the Washington Post Writers'
Group, the syndicate that distributes "Bloom
County," the original version of the Nov. 24 strip
had the geeky single guy desperately seeking ger
bils. They sent the strip out, blissfully unaware of
the havoc it might wreak.
Ooooooops.
A few days later it suddenly occurred to someone
at the syndicate, and here I'm quoting, "that gerbils
are sometimes used in homosexual practices." The
limits of taste absolutely forbid me to explain what
those practices are, but you're free to use your im
agination.
Realizing this, the syndicate quickly sent out a
new and improved copy of the strip to all the
newspapers, this time replacing those obscene ger
bils with the innocuous waffle iron.
Those members of the community who secretly
use waffle irons to get their jollies are probably
laughing up their sleeves right now, but the rest of
us, who are used to using only non-electric kitchen
implements in our sex lives, say "Ho hum."
Apparently, "Bloom County" cartoonist Berke
Breathed didn't have any choice in the matter, and
the syndicate didn't say whether Breathed chose "a
waffle iron" or not.
So the syndicate sent out this tame replacement
strip to all the subscribing newspapers, giving them
the option of running strip no. 1 or strip no. 2.
Finding someone responsible for "Bloom
County" at The Daily is about as easy as finding

someone responsible for the Iran-contra mess. Ap
parently, either the "waffle iron" strip never found
its way through the Daily's mail system, or else,
whichever editor was responsible for choosing be
tween "gerbils" and "a waffle iron" thought
"gerbils" was better.
A random perusal of some newspapers
nationwide revealed that "a waffle iron" was
definitely the strip of choice. The Mercury News,
The San Francisco Chronicle, The Miami Herald,
The San Diego Union and even the UCLA Daily
Bruin all ran the "waffle iron" strip.
Think about it: We may be the only newspaper to

print "gerbils." Call us trailhlazers, ladies and
gentlemen! Of course The Daily has a history of
printing controversial comic strips, including the
"Peanuts" a few years hack where Charlie Brown
gets the little red-haired girl pregnant.
Dear Bug Me,
I've always found that movies seen at the Flicks
are much more entertaining than those at normal
theaters. Occasionally, however, serious moments
do occur at the Flicks. Just as one character starts
