# Bug visits Bloom County
## The 						intrepid one also figures out the flaws in Flicks 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
Dear Bug Me,
On Tuesday, Nov. 24, The Daily and the San
Jose Mercury News published different versions of
"Bloom County." In the Mercury News version, a
geeky single guy was desperately seeking a waffle
iron through the personal ads. In the Daily's ver
sion, he was seeking gerhils. Which version is the
original? Why did the paper that put in the change
do so?
-A Bloom County fan

The Daily is one of the few newspapers in the
country — if not the only one — that printed the
version of "Bloom County" with "gerbils" instead
of "a waffle iron." Is this because The Dailv is a

newspaper with an historic penchant for journalistic
honesty? No! It is because we have a lousy mail sys
tem.
According to the Washington Post Writers'
Group, the syndicate that distributes "Bloom
County," the original version of the Nov. 24 strip
had the geeky single guy desperately seeking ger
bils. They sent the strip out, blissfully unaware of
the havoc it might wreak.
Ooooooops.
A few days later it suddenly occurred to someone
at the syndicate, and here I'm quoting, "that gerbils
are sometimes used in homosexual practices." The
limits of taste absolutely forbid me to explain what
those practices are, but you're free to use your im
agination.
Realizing this, the syndicate quickly sent out a
new and improved copy of the strip to all the
newspapers, this time replacing those obscene ger
bils with the innocuous waffle iron.
Those members of the community who secretly
use waffle irons to get their jollies are probably
laughing up their sleeves right now, but the rest of
us, who are used to using only non-electric kitchen
implements in our sex lives, say "Ho hum."
Apparently, "Bloom County" cartoonist Berke
Breathed didn't have any choice in the matter, and
the syndicate didn't say whether Breathed chose "a
waffle iron" or not.
So the syndicate sent out this tame replacement
strip to all the subscribing newspapers, giving them
the option of running strip no. 1 or strip no. 2.
Finding someone responsible for "Bloom
County" at The Daily is about as easy as finding

someone responsible for the Iran-contra mess. Ap
parently, either the "waffle iron" strip never found
its way through the Daily's mail system, or else,
whichever editor was responsible for choosing be
tween "gerbils" and "a waffle iron" thought
"gerbils" was better.
A random perusal of some newspapers
nationwide revealed that "a waffle iron" was
definitely the strip of choice. The Mercury News,
The San Francisco Chronicle, The Miami Herald,
The San Diego Union and even the UCLA Daily
Bruin all ran the "waffle iron" strip.
Think about it: We may be the only newspaper to

print "gerbils." Call us trailhlazers, ladies and
gentlemen! Of course The Daily has a history of
printing controversial comic strips, including the
"Peanuts" a few years hack where Charlie Brown
gets the little red-haired girl pregnant.
Dear Bug Me,
I've always found that movies seen at the Flicks
are much more entertaining than those at normal
theaters. Occasionally, however, serious moments
do occur at the Flicks. Just as one character starts


BUG
ME

baring his soul to another and the audience is com
pletely wrapped up in the movie, a microphone
pops onto the screen from above and starts poking
around like an aardvark.
Why is it these microphones always seem to ap
pear at the Flicks hut never at other theaters? Do
they take the extra $4 you pay elsewhere and buy
an attachment that holds the microphones back?
- Flick Freak
You know, you just can't expect to get Rolls
Royce movies at Yugo prices. Because the Flicks
folks pay much less for tne films they show — nor
mal theaters are charged a rental fee as well as a
percentage of the profits — they are given cheaper
prints of the movies than the ones you'd see at a
normal theater.
Still, you may wonder how a cheaper print
translates into so many guest appearances by Mr.
Microphone. Some of the distinguishing characteris
tics of the cheaper prints are those green lines that
seem to run up and down the films, as well as a less
than-dynamic soundtrack. It doesn't help, naturally,
that the Flicks projectors are older than Ronald
Reagan.

When movies are shot, the actual film captures a
larger area than the final print will show. Thus, the
cameras may pick up such extraneous materials
along the edges as the boom microphone, the side
lighting or Sean Penn slugging a fan or gaffer. The
theory is that the film will be cropped when edited
so only the stuff relevant to the movie is shown.
There is a little disagreement about why the
microphone ends up in the copies that we get.
Theoretically, a sloppy editing job is done on those
prints not destined for first-run theaters, which is
why the microphone appears on our prints.
According to a spokesman for Films Inc., the dis
tributor of the prints we get, the projectionist should
be able to adjust the projector to cut out the top of
the picture with the microphone.
Bob Litle, the director of Sunday Flicks, says that
the Films Inc. folks are being unduly harsh on the
projectionist. All 1 know is that at $1 a ticket I'd be
willing to see the microphone, the key grip and the
director's rear end.
I'm told that Mr. Mike had a major starring role
in the copy of "Black Widow" that was shown a
couple of weeks ago, and also made a few cameos in
the sneak preview of "Gardens of Stone" shown last
year. Rumor has it that Mr. Mike is up for an Acad
emy Award nomination this year for the best per
formance by a boom microphone in a supporting
role.

You know, you just can't expect to get Rolls
Royce movies at Yugo prices. Because the Flicks
folks pay much less for tne films they show — nor
mal theaters are charged a rental fee as well as a
percentage of the profits — they are given cheaper
prints of the movies than the ones you'd see at a
normal theater.
Still, you may wonder how a cheaper print
translates into so many guest appearances by Mr.
Microphone. Some of the distinguishing characteris
tics of the cheaper prints are those green lines that
seem to run up and down the films, as well as a less
than-dynamic soundtrack. It doesn't help, naturally,
that the Flicks projectors are older than Ronald
Reagan.

When movies are shot, the actual film captures a
larger area than the final print will show. Thus, the
cameras may pick up such extraneous materials
along the edges as the boom microphone, the side
lighting or Sean Penn slugging a fan or gaffer. The
theory is that the film will be cropped when edited
so only the stuff relevant to the movie is shown.
There is a little disagreement about why the
microphone ends up in the copies that we get.
Theoretically, a sloppy editing job is done on those
prints not destined for first-run theaters, which is
why the microphone appears on our prints.
According to a spokesman for Films Inc., the dis
tributor of the prints we get, the projectionist should
be able to adjust the projector to cut out the top of
the picture with the microphone.
Bob Litle, the director of Sunday Flicks, says that
the Films Inc. folks are being unduly harsh on the
projectionist. All 1 know is that at $1 a ticket I'd be
willing to see the microphone, the key grip and the
director's rear end.
I'm told that Mr. Mike had a major starring role

Dear Bug Me,
On Tuesday, Nov. 24, The Daily and the San
Jose Mercury News published different versions of
"Bloom County." In the Mercury News version, a
geeky single guy was desperately seeking a waffle
iron through the personal ads. In the Daily's ver
sion, he was seeking gerhils. Which version is the
original? Why did the paper that put in the change
do so?
-A Bloom County fan

The Daily is one of the few newspapers in the
country — if not the only one — that printed the
version of "Bloom County" with "gerbils" instead
of "a waffle iron." Is this because The Dailv is a

newspaper with an historic penchant for journalistic
honesty? No! It is because we have a lousy mail sys
tem.
According to the Washington Post Writers'
Group, the syndicate that distributes "Bloom
County," the original version of the Nov. 24 strip
had the geeky single guy desperately seeking ger
bils. They sent the strip out, blissfully unaware of
the havoc it might wreak.
Ooooooops.
A few days later it suddenly occurred to someone
at the syndicate, and here I'm quoting, "that gerbils
are sometimes used in homosexual practices." The
limits of taste absolutely forbid me to explain what
those practices are, but you're free to use your im
agination.
Realizing this, the syndicate quickly sent out a
new and improved copy of the strip to all the
newspapers, this time replacing those obscene ger
bils with the innocuous waffle iron.
Those members of the community who secretly
use waffle irons to get their jollies are probably
laughing up their sleeves right now, but the rest of
us, who are used to using only non-electric kitchen
implements in our sex lives, say "Ho hum."
Apparently, "Bloom County" cartoonist Berke
Breathed didn't have any choice in the matter, and
the syndicate didn't say whether Breathed chose "a
waffle iron" or not.
So the syndicate sent out this tame replacement
strip to all the subscribing newspapers, giving them
the option of running strip no. 1 or strip no. 2.
Finding someone responsible for "Bloom
County" at The Daily is about as easy as finding

someone responsible for the Iran-contra mess. Ap
parently, either the "waffle iron" strip never found
its way through the Daily's mail system, or else,
whichever editor was responsible for choosing be
tween "gerbils" and "a waffle iron" thought
"gerbils" was better.
A random perusal of some newspapers
nationwide revealed that "a waffle iron" was
definitely the strip of choice. The Mercury News,
The San Francisco Chronicle, The Miami Herald,
The San Diego Union and even the UCLA Daily
Bruin all ran the "waffle iron" strip.
Think about it: We may be the only newspaper to

print "gerbils." Call us trailhlazers, ladies and
gentlemen! Of course The Daily has a history of
printing controversial comic strips, including the
"Peanuts" a few years hack where Charlie Brown
gets the little red-haired girl pregnant.
