# Anthropology's dynamic duo still going strong
## 
### Joe Metcalfe Staff writer 
Since their marriage in 1942,
Anthropology Prof. George
Spindler and his wife Louise have
had a unique relationship, a rare
combination of collaboration in
the home, classroom and in the
field.
"Most people relate to each
other on the basis of independent
strength," George said. "We are
past that stage in our relationship.
We don't have the need for equal
assertiveness (when working)."
With the help of Louise, who
also has a doctorate in anthropol
ogy, George has developed a con
siderable reputation, both as an
anthropologist and as a teacher.
His use of the "case" method in
the classroom has revolutionized
the teaching of anthropology at
universities across the country.
He was one of the first anthropol
ogists to recognize the impor
tance of cultural influences on ed
ucation.
But to speak of George without
mention of Louise would be tell
ing only half the story.
"All of our (collaborative)
writing in the past 10 years has
been credited to 'George and
Louise Spindler,' " he said.
"What we are trying to communi
cate is that there is one identity
involved and that we have
reached the point where we are
not striving for separate identities
in terms of publications."
This give-and-take is evident
even in the Spindlers' conversa
tion. As one Spindler's voice
trails off, the other completes the

sentence. The result is almost un
interrupted dialogue, as if one
person is speaking.
Louise explained that she and
her husband try to keep a healthy
perspective on their relationship
and careers. "What does it matter
if IGeorge] has one more book
published or vice versa?" she

asked. "The fact that we are to
gether is much more important."
"We don't compete with each
other," George said.
In addition to collaborating on
their scholarly work, the
Spindlers also team up in the
lecture hall. The two cooperate in
teaching several different courses
and are known for developing un
usually close relationships with
students. "We never had anything
but good rapport with the stu
dents," George said.
Students in the Spindlers' in
troductory anthropology class

agree. "(Prof. Spindler] wants to
make the students feel more com
fortable in the class," senior
Andy Hyman said.
Although the Spindlers regu
larly teach a number of classes,
the class that most undergradu
ates are familiar with is Anthro
pology 1: Social and Cultural An
thropology.
The class is perhaps most
memorable because the Spindlers
do not teach it in a conventional
manner. In an attempt to teach a
style of thinking, as opposed to
specific conclusions, they use
what is called a "case-based"
method of instruction. This
means that they draw primarily
upon specific cultures they have
studied — the Tjurinja from
Australia, the Fore from New
Guinea and the Hutterites from
North America — and use them
to illustrate the fundamentals of
anthropology.
"Our approach is case-based
and inductive," George said. "We
develop ideas from a particular
case [to] demonstrate essential
differences between cultures."
Adrian Chan, a senior in An
thropology 1, said the case-based
method helps students "realize
[that] the culture we exist in is the
result of our own specific histori
cal process and not a teleological
end."
"I think one can probably say
this (method) has been the most
decisive influence in the teaching
of anthropology in America,"
George said.
The American Anthropological
Association at its annual meeting
last year cited this case-study
method as having revolutionized

anthropological instruction.
"What George and Louise
have done has been to . . . reach a
much wider public and make an
thropology relevant in other
areas, such as education," said
Anthropology Prof. Clifford Bar
nett.
"Their dedication to the field
of anthropology is inextricably
tied to their strong belief in the
importance of communicating to
students the diversity of human
culture as a path to understanding
the world and ourselves," he
added.
"If anthropology has a
strength, it's that anthropologists
get on the inside" of cultures dif
ferent from their own, George
said.
"We are seeing [a particular
culture] not really as outsiders
looking in, but as insiders looking
in and out at the same time," he
said.
After many years of study in
the field, the Spindlers speak
from experience. They nave
studied the Blood Indians of Al
berta, the Mistassini Cree of
Quebec and the West German
town of Beutelsbach. The couple
said they always developed a
closeness with the cultures they
studied, breaking down the walls
between themselves and the
people they observed.
For example, on one occasion
the Spindlers, who were traveling
with the Menominee Indians of
Wisconsin, went to a dance per
formance given by the tribe. An
Indian woman blocked their way
and asked them to pay for admis
sion. This, George said, was "like
a slap in the face" because the

two anthropologists felt so close
to the Menominees.
A few minutes later, a
Menominee friend came out to let
them in and explained that the
woman was new to her job and
had been instructed to let any of
"our people" in without charge.
The apology for the transgres-

sion "was a high point," George
said. "It was a feeling that we
weren't strangers or outsiders
prying into their lives. We really
had earned their recognition as a
member of their group."
The Spindlers are both from
the Midwest — George from
Stevens Point, Wis., and Louise
from a suburb of Chicago. Louise,
however, grew up in Southern
California. Because of this,
George explained, the couple ex
periences a continual "tug-of-war
between the West Coast and Wis
consin."

The Spindlers met at a Wiscon
sin high school where they both
taught before World War 11.
After the war, they completed
field research and went on to earn
doctorates. In 1952 George
Spindler obtained advanced
degrees in anthropology, sociol
ogy and psychology from UCLA.
Louise received her doctorate in
anthropology from Stanford in
1956.
Both were the first recipients of
doctorates in anthropology from
their respective universities.
At the urging of then-
Education Prof. Robert Bush,
George came to Stanford in 1950
to do research and lecture in the
School of Education.
"George Spindler was one of
the first persons in this country
who looked at how to apply an
thropology to education," said
Bush, now a professor emeritus.
He added that "bringing Spindler
to Stanford was one of the things
I've really been proud of during
my career."
George is thought of as "the
father of the anthropology of ed
ucation," according to Denis
Phillips, professor of education
and philosophy.
As a result of George's work,
anthropology is "now a relatively
thriving area of research
(throughout the country)," Phil
lips said.
Between the years of 1959 and
1975, the Spindlers were actively
involved in the Stanford-in-
Germany program, then located
in the small town of Beutelsbach.
Over the years, the couple made

nine visits to the town.
"There is something about
living in a small group where
you're all having some of the
same experiences," George said.
This participation in the Uni
versity's Overseas Studies pro
gram, along with his pathbreaking
case-study instruction, were par
tially responsible for the Dinkel
spiel Award for service to under
graduate education that George
won last year.
Although he continues to teach
many courses here, George took
early retirement in the summer of

1978 because he felt "over
worked and too tied down." He
said he also wanted time to teach
at other universities, such as UC-
Santa Barbara.
He stressed, however, that he
never wanted to permanently
move to another university. "I
just wanted to move around," he
said.
"Even the residents of heaven
wonder what the other creatures
live like," he joked. "If you're al
ready at the No. 1 place in the
country, why would you want to
go anywhere else?"
Currently, the Spindlers are
working on a number of publica
tions, including a book about
American culture and education
and an anthropology text

modeled after the introductory
course they teach here.
But teaching and contact with
students remain extremely impor
tant for both of the Spindlers.
Even after spending only a few
days away from Stanford at a
home they own in Calistoga, they
"begin to miss the students and
. . . the stimulation of ideas,"
Louise said.
"The real thrill comes when I
see the light in people's eyes
when they [ask] about the differ
ences in the patterns of warfare
for the Dani and Yanomamo and
then ask some questions about
current U.S. affairs in that light,"
George said. "I just get a boost
out of that that I couldn't get any
other way."
