# Students rally for refuseniks
## 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
Four Stanford students were
among nearly 250,000 people
who marched in Washington,
D.C., Sunday in support of
refuseniks â€” Soviet Jews denied
permission to emigrate.
Part of a group of 130 Bay
Area supporters from the Jewish
community, sophomores Evan
Lurie, Alicia Kent, David Milkes
and Marina Landau represented
Stanford Hillel, a campus Jewish
student organization.
The rally, named "Freedom
Sunday," was prompted by the
arrival Monday of Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
According to Kent, one goal of
the march was to pressure Presi
dent Reagan to include the issue
of Soviet refuseniks in his discus
sions with Gorbachev.
Vice President George Bush
spoke at the rally and said
Reagan would include refuseniks
on his agenda and that he (Bush)
would raise the issue with Gorba
chev.
Kent said the rally made clear
the idea that "it is not just a few
people fighting for refuseniks, but
a world community speaking
out."
The rally "will not pass by
without impact," Landau said. "I
will never forget this day, not for
the rest of my life."
Landau, who is Jewish, was
born in the Soviet Union and

emigrated with her parents to the
United States in 1981. Landau
said most of her farhily is still in
the Soviet Union, including a
grandmother and an uncle who
are trying to emigrate.
At the rally, approximately 20
speakers offered perspectives on
the Soviet refusenik policy, in
cluding Nobel laureate and death
camp survivor Elie Wiesel,
former refusenik Natan Sharan
sky, New York City Mayor Ed

Koch, Speaker of the House Jim
Wright and Sens. Robert Dole
(R-Kan.) and Daniel Inouye (D-
Hawaii).
Wiesel told listeners that the
aim of the movement is not to
oppose hopeful signs coming
from Moscow, but to encourage
further progress.
Other rally marchers included
Sens. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.)
and Albert Gore (D-Tenn.).
