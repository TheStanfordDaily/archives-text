# Law School hiring draws fire
## Faculty committee discusses female and minority profs 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
An audience of students and faculty at a panel
discussion with the Law School's Faculty Ap
pointments Committee Monday expressed
sharply divergent views over how recruitment of
female and ethnic minority faculty at the school
should be conducted.
Disagreement at the discussion focused on
whether it is more important to appoint people to
law professorships who have high potential aca
demic ability on a race- and gender-blind basis,
or to actively seek ethnic minority and female
professors in order to add to the school's cultural
diversity and gain a wide variety of intellectual
viewpoints.
"Social experience is more relevant than aca
demic focus" in selecting professors, said Law
Prof. Gerald Lopez, a committee member. The
Law School's "principal mission is to train people
to practice law. This requires intellectual diver
sity, and the primary need in intellectual diversity
is to have women and people of color," Lopez
said.
But other committee members expressed dif
ferent philosophies. "Diversity is important, but
it is only one of many aspects" that should be
considered in selecting professors, said Law Prof.
William Baxter. He called the ability to help stu
dents understand complex material an important
criterion in appointments.
Law Prof. Barton Thompson agreed with Bax
ter, citing teaching ability, student relations and
potential for scholarship — in addition to cultural
diversity — as factors important in selecting fac
ulty members.
Law Prof. Deborah Rhode, however, ex

pressed concern about "the way the faculty at
taches importance to this issue, or rather their
failure to do so."
Rhode, who is also director of the Institute for
Research on Women and Gender, is one of five
women faculty members currently at the Law
School. She pointed out, however, that she works
only half time due to her commitments to the in
stitute and that one of the other women profes
sors is currently on leave.

'There is no such thing as a
monolithic faculty viewpoint' on
appointments.

"We breathed an enormous sigh of collective
relief when two more women were hired last
year, but it's not enough. The absence of a
woman of color is an enormous disservice to the
students," she said.
According to Lopez, only one professor of
color, Law Prof. Miguel Mendez, currently serves
full time on the school's faculty.
In response to charges that there is a tendency
at the Law School to appoint white males and to
overlook ethnic minorities and women,
Thompson said, "There is no such thing as a
monolithic faculty viewpoint" on appointments.
The faculty appointments committee
researches potential candidates and makes rec
ommendations to the faculty on whether an ap
plicant should be offered an untenured professor
ship.
