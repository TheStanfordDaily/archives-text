# Judge rules to allow restricted drug testing
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
The NCAA will continue to be
allowed to conduct random drug
testing of Stanford football and
men's basketball players, but only
under severe restrictions, a Santa
Clara County Superior Court
judge ruled Friday.
The court said the NCAA may
only test for cocaine, steroids,
amphetamines and heroin, and
may not monitor athletes while
they submit urine samples.
Judge Conrad Rushing's deci
sion eliminates more than 3000
drugs from the NCAA's banned
drug list, which had previously in
cluded such drugs as marijuana,
caffeine and several over-the
counter medicines.
The final version of the judge's
preliminary injunction remains
unwritten, but Rushing told attor
neys that it will reaffirm his Nov.
19 intended decision to grant an
injunction against the NCAA
drug-testing program for 26 of
Stanford's 28 varsity sports.
George Gangwere, general
counsel for the NCAA, said in a
statement issued to reporters
after the decision that the organi
zation will "certainly" appeal the
decision.
"This isn't the final word, even
in California," Gangwere said.
"Monitoring urinalysis is essential
to obtain a correct, truthful
sample."
If upheld in an appellate court,
the decision would be binding

throughout California and would
seriously threaten the NCAA
drug-testing program across the
country.
Senior Jennifer Hill, a women's
soccer player and co-plaintiff in
the case, greeted the decision
with mixed feelings. "It's only
somewhat of a victory," she told
reporters in court Friday.
"Eventually, I'd like to see testing
of all sports abolished."
Robert Van Nest, a San Fran
cisco attorney representing plain
tiffs Hill and junior Barry
McKeever, said yesterday that al
though he was happy with the
"broad" decision, he was
"disappointed that Rushing
didn't treat football and basket
ball players the way he treated
everyone else."
Unlike Hill, McKeever, a line
backer on the football team, did
not receive an injunction against
the progam. Van Nest said he and
McKeever had not yet decided
whether to appeal the ruling.
University attorney Debra
Zumwalt, who represented Stan
ford as a third party supporting
the students in the case, said she
was "pleased" with the decision.
"Rushing answered our major
concerns," she said. "We were
most concerned with athletes
having to urinate in front of
someone and with the overbroad
list of banned drugs."
Zumwalt said that although the
University will no longer be
actively involved in the case it will
continue its policy of defending

students' constitutional rights.
Asked whether the University
objected to the judge's decision,
Zumwalt replied, "We could al
ways come up with a better drug
testing program. But there are
ways Stanford can act through the
NCAA rather than through the
courts."
In his intended ruling last
month. Rushing criticized the
year-old NCAA testing program
for treating student athletes "like
criminals" and violating their
right to privacy under the U.S.
and California constitutions.
The final injunction, however,
drops the reference to the U.S.
Constitution because the stu
dents' attorneys wanted to
"procedurally simplify" the case,
Van Nest said.
