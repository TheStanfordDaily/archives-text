## Summit 'doomed to succeed' 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
This week's arms control summit between
President Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail
Gorbachev is "doomed to succeed" despite a past
trend of summit failures, a senior news analyst for
National Public Radio said at an arms control
conference here Friday.
Correspondent Daniel Schorr participated in a
round table discussion on the summit with Wall
Street Journal Foreign Editor Karen House, So
viet physicist Sergei Kapitza, Assoc. Political Sci
ence Prof. Condoleezza Rice and Time Washing
ton Bureau Chief Strobe Talbott.
The panel was one of four discussions held in
conjunction with last weekend's arms control
conference, "Building a Safer 21st Century,"
sponsored by Stanford's Center for International
Security and Arms Control.
"1 know summitry since 1955," Schorr said.
" This is the 11th (summit) since World War 11,
and like the rest of them it's a bum idea. On the
whole, they turn out to be flops and have even
created dangerous situations." Schorr covered in
ternational relations for CBS News for over 30
years and was expelled from the Soviet Union in
1957 on charges of violating censorship regula
tions.
Schorr said the summit's significance will be
more psychological than strategic because other
missiles are already being targeted to offset the
effects of an intermediate-range nuclear forces
reduction.
"If arms control is a step that the superpowers
acknowledge a mutual responsibility for peace
for the rest of the world, it will have been
worthwhile," he said.
Kapitza also expressed hope, stating that the
summit "may lead to a sequence of treaties."
The physicist serves as vice chairman of the
Committee of Soviet Scientists for Peace Against
the Nuclear Threat.
He encouraged a "broader level of discussion"
bevond the summit itself, saying that environ

mental and energy issues, along with the nuelear
threat, present both eountries with global prob
lems that require "a common understanding of
each other."
"Global stability has utmost priority over all
other national and transnational issues, Kapitza
said, adding that events such as the summit "arc
the consequences of this enlargement of vision.
Kapitza also said that technological improve
ments have had both a positive and a negative ef
fect on superpower relations. Such advances, he
said, initially contributed to the escalation ot the
arms race but now facilitate arms control through
improved verification procedures.
"Scientists can help in a very peculiar way. The
problem of verification is very important, he
said.
Rice, a specialist in Soviet military matters, dis
cussed Gorbachev's domestic motivations for the
summit.
"It is no accident that in 1988 the Soviet Union
will go into another major phase for its next five
year plan. [GorbachevJ must know what the stra
tegic situation will be so he can plan," said Rice,
who left for Washington, D.C., after the discus
sion to serve as a consultant for ABC News
during the summit.
Rice also said the Soviets wish to rely less on
military power and more on "skillful diplomacy"
to secure their place in the world.
"There is a desire for an image as a country on
the move," she said, adding that the press has ex
aggerated the role of public relations as a motiva
tion for Gorbachev.
"It's not really the business of the general sec
retary of the Soviet Union to run for president of
the United States," she said.
Talbott, who co-authored the book "Reagan
and Gorbachev" with Mike Mandelbaum this
year, compared superpower relations to astrol
ogy, saying that "alignment" of Gorbachev's and
Reagan's domestic goals provides a rare opportu
nity for "one of the most sweeping and salutory
agreements in this century."
