## Spikers host regional 
### Chris Grader Senior staff writer 
"Excellent: adj. unusually good of its kind; of ex
ceptional merit, virtue, etc." As in four of the top six
volleyball teams in the country. As in sixteen all
conference selections and two conference players of
the year. As in a berth in the final four.
When the Stanford women open up the' Western
regional volleyball tournament against Colorado
State Friday night at Maples Pavilion, excellent may
be the only word to do the event justice. Following
the 6 p.m. match between the third-ranked Cardinal
and the sixth-ranked Rams, No. 4 BYU will meet
No. 5 UCLA.
The two winners will then face off Saturday night
at 7:30 p.m. in Maples, with the victor advancing to
the final four Dec. 17 and 19 in Indianapolis.
All four teams come in with a legitimate chance to
win the region and go on to Market Square Arena
next weekend, setting up a pair of interesting
matchups Friday. The first contest is a rematch for
the 27-5 Rams who lost 15-7, 11-15, 15-12, 15-8 to
the Cardinal (26-6) Sept. 9 in Fort Collins, Colo.
Many Colorado State players also remember a
match in 1985.
In the same situation — Stanford hosting
Colorado State in a Western regional semifinal —
the Cardinal knocked the Rams out of the 1985
NCAA tournament. Ram setter Cindy Cox isn't ex
pecting another blowout.
"We're going to play with a lot more confidence,"
she said. "(Last time) we were happy and satisfied
we made it. . . . We just have a lot more heart on
this team, a lot more desire."
"I definitely don't want it to be my last match,
and I'm going to do everything I can to keep it from
being my last match," senior middle blocker Diane
Saba said.
Cox has been leading the Ram attack all year.
The junior leads the nation in assists with 14.8 per
game, thanks in part to two seniors. Outside hitter
Angie Knox is currently third in the nation in kills
and was named first-team All-High Country Athle
tic Conference.
Complementing her is Saba, the HCACs Offen
sive Player of the Year and another first-team all
league pick. Additionally, Cox was named Second-
Team All-HCAC and freshman outside hitter Jill
Johnson was an honorable mention pick. Against
USC in the NCAA first round last week, Knox had
34 kills and Johnson 26, while Cox dished out 83 as
sists.
Leading the way for the Cardinal is a trio of
seniors, all of whom were members of the All-
Pacific 10 Conference team. Pac-10 Player of the
Year Wendi Rush, the team's setter, runs the Cardi
nal attack. She, along with Cox, Ann Boyer of
UCLA and BYU's Mariliisa Salmi should demon
strate setting at its best: They may be the four best
at their position in the country.
Rush, who is trying to lead the Cardinal to its
sixth consecutive final four appearance, has had the
benefit of playing with seniors Nancy Reno and
Teresa Smith this season. Both have been enjoying

tremendous years and are strong candidates for All-
America honors.
Smith was the Pac-10 Player of the Year last year
and a first-team All-American as well, while Reno
was a second-team All-Pac-10 performer last year.
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said he expects a bat
tle. "They're really good," he said. "They have two
great [hitters — Knox and Saba]; they play good
defense. They're a real solid team."
Stanford sophomore outside hitter Lara Asper
agrees. "I think we've improved a lot in all areas"
since the September contest. She continued, "I'm
sure they've improved. We're expecting to see one
of the top teams (in the country)."
The second match should have at least as much
tension as the first. The Cougars beat the Bruins at
UCLA in October, but the Bruins extracted revenge
last month, winning in four games in Provo, Utah.
Both teams fit what seems to be the pattern for
the West Regional, being led by a setter, a middle
blocker and an outside hitter. The Bruin's answer to
Rush, Reno and Smith — or Cox, Saba and Knox —
is the trio of Boyer, Daiva Tomkus and Lori Zeno.
The three were all named to the All-Pac-10 team
this year and have proved immensely valuable as the
Bruins have been hit by injuries this year. Boyer
leads the Pac-10 in assists average, while Tomkus
and Zeno are one-two in the league in total kills.
The 28-9 Bruins lost starters Stacy Buck,
Samantha Shaver and Traci Broadway to injury
about six weeks ago, but all are expected to play Fri
day. Buck has played in the last 10 matches, leading
UCLA to eight wins. She had 21 kills in the Bruins'
playoffs-opening win against California last week.
Shaver and Broadway will also be back after sit
ting out 13 straight matches. Shaver actually played
a limited amount in the back row against the Bears,
but will be playing all the way around this weekend.
"My knee (she had bone chips there) is better, and
I'm playing again," she said.
Shaver, a freshman from Los Altos, said she "was
really upset" she didn't get to play when UCLA
came here three weeks ago. "I've always wanted to
play at Stanford in front of my home town," Shaver
said.
Sophomore Tomkus thinks her team is primed for
a big performance. "1 think we're going to have a
couple of good matches," she said, citing the Bruin's
first-round loss to Loyola Marymount last year, one
of the biggest upsets in volleyball history.
"That's one thing that's pushing us on," Tomkus
said, referring to th season-ending loss last year.
"It's really depres ... I think we're looking for
ward to it (domg better this time around)."
Freshman Lynne Rocha, a San Jose native,
agreed that her team is fired up. "I think we have a
great chance," she sa.d."lf we play our game ... we
have a good chance We're coming on strong at the
right time. There are seniors on our team who want
it bad. I mean bad."
The Cougars, who are 33-4 this year, including
wins over all three other teams in the tournament,
are also led by a trio. Salmi, Reebok's 1986 Na
tional Player of the Year and a starter on the Fin
nish national team, leads the show.
