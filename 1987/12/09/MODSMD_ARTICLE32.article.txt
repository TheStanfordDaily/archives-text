# Card pounds Brown, seizes Apple Invitational title
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
A trio of big men and "a 6-
foot-4 Larry Bird" led Stanford
to its second straight Apple Invi
tational championship last
weekend as the Cardinal (4-2)
defeated the Brown Bears (2-1)
in the title game 90-78.
The Texas Longhorns (1-3)
defeated the William & Mary
Tribe (0-4) 78-73 in the consola
tion contest.
Stanford's 6-8 forward Howard
Wright and 6-11 center Greg
Butler had 13 and 15 points,
respectively, in the win over
Brown, and 6-7 freshman An
drew Vlahov assisted Cardinal
guard Todd Lichti on two key
breakaways in Stanford's first
round 87-64 victory over William
& Mary.
Lichti, who was named the
tournament's Most Valuable
Player, scored 19 points against
William & Mary and 19 more
against Brown, despite spending
much of the second halves of each
game cheering from the bench.
"Todd Lichti reminds me a
little of .i 6-4 l .iiry Bird,"
William & M.u\ Coach Chuck
Swenson said. "Mis movement
without the ball is great."
Lichti scored 13 of his 19
against the Tribe in the first half,
and Wright was a perfect 6-for-6
from the field and 3-for-3 from
the foul line for a total of 15
points in that half.
Both Lichti and Wright were
recipients of pinpoint passing
from Vlahov. During a late first
half 19-4 Cardinal spurt that put
the game away, Vlahov, still
recovering somewhat from a
strained knee, had four assists, in
cluding two to Lichti and an alley
oop to Wright.
"Andrew is real strong for a
frosh, and he has a great team
concept," Lichti said. "He's real
strong with the ball and passes
well, but when he gets confidence
in his knee he'll be a lot better."
Butler's strong play in the first
few minutes of the second half of
the championship game turned
out to be the key to Stanford*s
victory. At halftime against
Brown the Cardinal only led by a
39-35 score.

"We played good basketball (in
the first half), so we were asking
ourselves why we were only up by
four," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "They shot
three-pointers, and we didn't get
any, and we missed four front
ends of one-and-ones."
Butler, who himself had missed
three of those front ends, atoned
for his charity stripe inaccuracy
with a vengeance in the second
half.
On four consecutive trips down
the court Butler sank two hook
shots and two turnaround
jumpers — which left the crowd
in a frenzy, the score 55-37 and
the Bears in the dust.
"Greg was so open off of his
first cut that it was almost crimi
nal," Montgomery said.
"At halftime (Bryan) Mc-
Sweeney and a couple guys said
they knew they were missing me,
and they were going to try and get
me the ball," Butler said. "1 had
my man pinned, and it was just a
matter of turning around and put
ting it in."
Brown Coach Mike Cingiser,
whose tallest player is 6-9, said
that the height of the Stanford
front line doomed the Bears.
"You know what they say,
when we get tired, Butler is still
6-11," Cingiser said.
Stanford eventually opened up
a 65-45 lead with nine minutes
remaining in the game, and Cin
giser put his second- and third
stringers in the game. Mont
gomery did the same, but a situa
tion that sometimes turns into a
mess actually became very inter
esting.
Brown freshman Bill Coffey
came off the bench and scored 11
points in a three-minute stretch to
make the score 71-57 with six
minutes left, and Brown had the
momentum.
"Every coach at some point
during his career does what Mike
(Montgomery) did and has it
backfire," Cinciser said. "Not
that it was a bad play — he didn't
null his guvs until I pulled mine.
We got lucky and started draining
three-pointers like we were pros.
"But Mike still had Todd

(Lichti) sitting next to him."
And with 5:56 left, Mont
gomery sent Lichti and Vlahov
back into the game.
Lichti fed Stuart Thomas for a
17-foot jumper and canned a run
ning six-foot hank shot, while
Vlahov made a layup and was
fouled. He sank the free throw
and the Cardinal led by 18 with
three minutes left.
"I've seen games turn very
quickly, especially with three
point goals," Montgomery said of
his decision to put Lichti back in
the game. "I wanted one more

player to give us some stability.
Obviously our job was to win the
game, and really it helps a guy
like Oliver (Cunningham) to play
with Todd."
A last-minute run by the
Bruins narrowed the gap to the
final tally, 90-78.
Joining MVP Lichti on the all
tournament team were Texas
guards Courtney Jeans and Travis
Mays; Wright, who had 14
rebounds in the tourney; Butler
and Brown forward Marcus
Thompson.
After a break this week, the 4-

2 Cardinal will have a busy
schedule over the Holidays. Sat
urday, Dec. 12 Stanford travels to
San Francisco to meet the Uni
versity of San Francisco at 7:30.
Then it's back to Maples Pavilion,
where the Cardinal will host Har
vard Dec IS. USC Monday, Dec.
21 and UCLA Wednesday, Dec.
23.
