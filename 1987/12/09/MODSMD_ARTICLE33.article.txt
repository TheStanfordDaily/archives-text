Those aren't the first names
that spring to mind when one
thinks of the Stanford basketball
program, but the Cardinal bench
contributed heavily to Stanford's
two victories in the Apple Invita
tional, combining for 67 points
and 40 rebounds.
"We've got a lot of guys who
can play," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "1 wanted to
get them some quality time and
see what they could do."
Freshman Andrew Vlahov saw
the most action of all the sub
stitutes, playing for a total of 37
minutes in Stanford's two wins.
The aggressive Australian tied for
the team high with seven
rebounds against William & Mary
and pulled down six against
Brown. He also scored six points
in each contest, including a pair of
three-point plays against the
Bruins.
"Andrew made a big difference
with his physical play,"
Montgomery said. "He contrib
uted real well."
The forward's inspired per
formance earned him loud cheers
from the Stanford student sec
tion. "I'm not over-aggressive."
Vlahov said, "that's just the way I
play. That's an area the team
needed to improve in, and that's
what I try to come in and do â€”
grab a few boards.
"I'm real happy with the time
I'm getting "
Senior guard Scott Meinert
came off the bench to add seven
assists and 12 points to the Cardi
nal cause. "I'm pretty happy with
the way I played," Meinert said.
"Guys were making their shots,
that's the reason you get assists.
