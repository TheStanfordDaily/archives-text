Those aren't the first names
that spring to mind when one
thinks of the Stanford basketball
program, but the Cardinal bench
contributed heavily to Stanford's
two victories in the Apple Invita
tional, combining for 67 points
and 40 rebounds.
"We've got a lot of guys who
can play," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "1 wanted to
get them some quality time and
see what they could do."
Freshman Andrew Vlahov saw
the most action of all the sub
stitutes, playing for a total of 37
minutes in Stanford's two wins.
The aggressive Australian tied for
the team high with seven
rebounds against William & Mary
and pulled down six against
Brown. He also scored six points
in each contest, including a pair of
three-point plays against the
Bruins.
"Andrew made a big difference
with his physical play,"
Montgomery said. "He contrib
uted real well."
The forward's inspired per
formance earned him loud cheers
from the Stanford student sec
tion. "I'm not over-aggressive."
Vlahov said, "that's just the way I
play. That's an area the team
needed to improve in, and that's
what I try to come in and do —
grab a few boards.
"I'm real happy with the time
I'm getting "
Senior guard Scott Meinert
came off the bench to add seven
assists and 12 points to the Cardi
nal cause. "I'm pretty happy with
the way I played," Meinert said.
"Guys were making their shots,
that's the reason you get assists.
They were doing a good job of
getting open."
Sophomore reserves Deshon
Wingate (six points, six re
bounds), Stuart Thomas (nine
points) and Oliver Cunningham
(four assists) also contributed in
the two tournament games, while
four other players — sophomore
Winkes and freshmen Meyer,
Booker and John Patrick — saw
action for the first time in their
Stanford careers.

"That was a lot of fun," said
Booker, a walk-on guard who
scored four points in the 87-64
victory over William & Mary. "I
came out and wasn't expecting to
play much. They tell you that
from the onset, so when you get
in there, it makes it really excit
ing."
Winkes, also a walk-on, power
ed over a William & Mary
defender Friday night for the first
points of his career. "I was just
pumped," the forward said. "It's
a lot different from practice —
there was a lot of adrenaline
going.
"I don't think I killed anyone,"

Winkes said, "but I thought I
played pretty well. We weren't
quite comfortable with the of
fense; we were more excited to be
in the game."
The Stanford starters, who had
an opportunity to get a much
needed rest with the bench
playing, were also happy with the
second string's performance. "I'm
just as thrilled as can be," center
Howard Wright said. "There's a
tendency to overlook the effort
the guys on the bench make, but
the walk-ons and the 10th and
1 Ith players are out there every
practice sweating and working
just as hard as the starters do, if
not harder."
