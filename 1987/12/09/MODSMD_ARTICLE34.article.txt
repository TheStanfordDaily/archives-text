# Cagers win Hawaiian tourney
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Last weekend in Honolulu, the Stan
ford women's basketball team gave
new meaning to "Hawaii 5-0." After
an impressive 83-38 rout of Loyola
Marymount Friday night in the
opening round of Hawaii's "Early
Season Festival," the Cardinal survived
a half-court duel Saturday to beat the
Rainbow Wahines 82-76 in the cham
pionship game and raise its record to 5-
0 for the season.
Stanford is currently ranked 17th na
tionally and has the best preseason
won-loss record in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. In a preseason survey, the
Pac-10 coaches predicted that the Car
dinal, just 14-14 overall last year, will
finish third in the league behind USC
and Washington; but if Stanford's level
of play against top-flight competition
continues, the Cardinal could do even
better.
Though unranked, Hawaii proved to
be a strong squad "Hawaii is a good
team, probably the best team we've
played," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said.
"After watching them play [in the
opening round] we really felt they had
a good perimeter game and good
guards," she said. "When we played
them, it turned out to be the other way
around. Their forwards played really
well, so we had to make some adjust
ments."
Another change occurred when
Charli Turner entered the game.
Turner, a 5-foot-5 senior guard, ex
ploded on the scene with 10 assists and

sparked the Cardinal offense.
"When Charli came in, she settled
things down and got the ball to Jill
(Yanke)," VanDerveer said. With
Yanke, a junior center who last week
was named Pac-1() Player of the Week,
getting the ball, Stanford was able to
exploit the weakness of Hawaii's zone
defense and score some points.
The other effect of the frequent
Turner-Yanke connection was to free
up the perimeter for decreased
pressure three-point shooting, to the
benefit of sophomore guard Jennifer
Azzi and sophomore forward Katy
Steding. "People hit some good three
point shots," VanDerveer said.
"Our whole team played really
well," Turner said. "We got the ball
inside, and we scored.
"The Hawaii team gave us a really
good game. They re probably the best
team we've played this year."
Along with Turner, 6-foot-3 fresh
man forward Trisha Stevens showed
herself to be another rising star for
Stanford. "Trisha Stevens played really
well," Turner said. "Her game is really
starting to pick up."
"We got a big game from Trisha
[against Hawaii]," VanDerveer said.
"She hit seven-for-10 and put up some
solid defense."
Stevens' defensive effort, coupled
with characteristically strong coverage
by Azzi, made up for any trouble that
Turner encountered in this area.
"Charli got hurt a bit defensively, but
Jennifer did well on one of their
guards," the coach added.
Surprisingly, defense was one area in
which both Hawaii and the Cardinal

were lacking. Though Hawaii allowed
over 80 points, it managed to contain
the run-and-gun tendencies of Stan
ford, a team that has greatly profited
from the fast-break this season.
"It was really a half-court game, not
a running game," VanDerveer ob
served.
The first round game against the
Loyola Lions highlighted the talents of
some oft-unseen Cardinal athletes.
"The Marymount game was basically a
blow-out," VanDerveer said. "They
are a small team that doesn't have the
depth that we have."
"I saw some real good improvement
in that game and some people that nor
mally don't play all that much made
some real contributions," she said.
"Tammy (Svoboda) played well, Pam
Simms played good defense, Ann
(Adkins) had five assists, and Jennifer
(Azzi) scored 19 points in less than 20
minutes."
The Cardinal hopes to enjoy the
same success Saturday at 3 p.m. in its
home opener against Santa Clara, but
the 3-1 Lady Broncos will give the host
a run for its money. Like Stanford,
Santa Clara is coming off a two-win
weekend, having downed Pacific 66-52
and Portland State 80-78 and has the
advantage of having beaten the Cardi
nal in each of the teams' last five
meetings.
"We don't know much about them,
because we didn't play them last year,
but Santa Clara always has a good team
and they had a big win against

Charli Turner (white), a senior point guard from Van Nuys, played a pivotal role for the
Cardinal against Hawaii Saturday, dishing out 10 assists.
Memphis State," VanDerveer
said. "They are usually a solid
team and play well together.
That's especially important when
we have a young team that
doesn't play as well together be
cause they don't know each other
as well."
"It's our only game this week,
so we can concentrate on Santa
Clara," VanDerveer said. "I
think we'll see a tremendous ef
fort. It will be an excellent

opening game. We've played five
games on the road, and we're
ready to play at home."
Turner agrees. "Everybody's
really looking forward to it," she
said. "Last year, we played pretty
well at home. Now that we've
started running more, we're going
to be pretty exciting to watch."
Stanford continues its home
stand with a string of games
during winter vacation. The San
Francisco Dons will visit campus
Dec. 18, after most students have
left the Farm, and North Carolina
State will come calling Dec. 19.
As has been the case with most
of the Cardinal's preseason oppo
nents, VanDerveer knows little

about either team. "North
Carolina State looks like the
stronger team on paper," she
said. "They seem to have a real
strong team. USF graduated
some real good players, and they
have a new coach this year."
Cardinal competition will con
tinue 10 days later when Stanford
hosts Minnesota, Oklahoma and
Simon Fraser in the Cardinal
Classic. In the opening round, the
Cardinal will face the Minnesota
Golden Gophers, a Big 10 Con
ference team on the upswing after
a slow 1986-87 season.
Stanford will ring in the new
year when another member of the
Big 10, Purdue, visits Jan. 2.

we have a young team that
doesn't play as well together be
cause they don't know each other
as well."
"It's our only game this week,
so we can concentrate on Santa
Clara," VanDerveer said. "I
think we'll see a tremendous ef
fort. It will be an excellent

opening game. We've played five
games on the road, and we're
ready to play at home."
Turner agrees. "Everybody's
really looking forward to it," she
said. "Last year, we played pretty
well at home. Now that we've
started running more, we're going
to be pretty exciting to watch."
Stanford continues its home
stand with a string of games
during winter vacation. The San
Francisco Dons will visit campus
Dec. 18, after most students have
left the Farm, and North Carolina
State will come calling Dec. 19.
As has been the case with most
of the Cardinal's preseason oppo
nents, VanDerveer knows little

about either team. "North
Carolina State looks like the
stronger team on paper," she
said. "They seem to have a real
strong team. USF graduated
some real good players, and they
have a new coach this year."
Cardinal competition will con
tinue 10 days later when Stanford
hosts Minnesota, Oklahoma and
Simon Fraser in the Cardinal
Classic. In the opening round, the
Cardinal will face the Minnesota
Golden Gophers, a Big 10 Con
ference team on the upswing after
a slow 1986-87 season.
Stanford will ring in the new
year when another member of the
Big 10, Purdue, visits Jan. 2.
Last weekend in Honolulu, the Stan
ford women's basketball team gave
new meaning to "Hawaii 5-0." After
an impressive 83-38 rout of Loyola
Marymount Friday night in the
opening round of Hawaii's "Early
Season Festival," the Cardinal survived
a half-court duel Saturday to beat the
Rainbow Wahines 82-76 in the cham
pionship game and raise its record to 5-
0 for the season.
Stanford is currently ranked 17th na
tionally and has the best preseason
won-loss record in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. In a preseason survey, the
Pac-10 coaches predicted that the Car
dinal, just 14-14 overall last year, will
finish third in the league behind USC
and Washington; but if Stanford's level
of play against top-flight competition
continues, the Cardinal could do even
better.
Though unranked, Hawaii proved to
be a strong squad "Hawaii is a good
team, probably the best team we've
played," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said.
"After watching them play [in the
opening round] we really felt they had
a good perimeter game and good
guards," she said. "When we played
them, it turned out to be the other way
around. Their forwards played really
well, so we had to make some adjust
ments."
Another change occurred when
Charli Turner entered the game.
Turner, a 5-foot-5 senior guard, ex
ploded on the scene with 10 assists and

sparked the Cardinal offense.
"When Charli came in, she settled
things down and got the ball to Jill
(Yanke)," VanDerveer said. With
Yanke, a junior center who last week
was named Pac-1() Player of the Week,
getting the ball, Stanford was able to
exploit the weakness of Hawaii's zone
defense and score some points.
The other effect of the frequent
Turner-Yanke connection was to free
up the perimeter for decreased
pressure three-point shooting, to the
benefit of sophomore guard Jennifer
Azzi and sophomore forward Katy
Steding. "People hit some good three
point shots," VanDerveer said.
"Our whole team played really
well," Turner said. "We got the ball
inside, and we scored.
"The Hawaii team gave us a really
good game. They re probably the best
team we've played this year."
Along with Turner, 6-foot-3 fresh
man forward Trisha Stevens showed
herself to be another rising star for
Stanford. "Trisha Stevens played really
well," Turner said. "Her game is really
starting to pick up."
"We got a big game from Trisha
[against Hawaii]," VanDerveer said.
"She hit seven-for-10 and put up some
solid defense."
Stevens' defensive effort, coupled
with characteristically strong coverage
by Azzi, made up for any trouble that
Turner encountered in this area.
"Charli got hurt a bit defensively, but
Jennifer did well on one of their
guards," the coach added.
Surprisingly, defense was one area in
which both Hawaii and the Cardinal

were lacking. Though Hawaii allowed
over 80 points, it managed to contain
the run-and-gun tendencies of Stan
ford, a team that has greatly profited
from the fast-break this season.
"It was really a half-court game, not
a running game," VanDerveer ob
served.
The first round game against the
Loyola Lions highlighted the talents of
some oft-unseen Cardinal athletes.
"The Marymount game was basically a
blow-out," VanDerveer said. "They
are a small team that doesn't have the
depth that we have."
"I saw some real good improvement
in that game and some people that nor
mally don't play all that much made
some real contributions," she said.
"Tammy (Svoboda) played well, Pam
Simms played good defense, Ann
(Adkins) had five assists, and Jennifer
(Azzi) scored 19 points in less than 20
minutes."
The Cardinal hopes to enjoy the
same success Saturday at 3 p.m. in its
home opener against Santa Clara, but
the 3-1 Lady Broncos will give the host
a run for its money. Like Stanford,
Santa Clara is coming off a two-win
weekend, having downed Pacific 66-52
and Portland State 80-78 and has the
advantage of having beaten the Cardi
nal in each of the teams' last five
meetings.
"We don't know much about them,
because we didn't play them last year,
but Santa Clara always has a good team
and they had a big win against

Cardinal against Hawaii Saturday, dishing out 10 assists.
Memphis State," VanDerveer
said. "They are usually a solid
team and play well together.
That's especially important when
we have a young team that
doesn't play as well together be
cause they don't know each other
as well."
