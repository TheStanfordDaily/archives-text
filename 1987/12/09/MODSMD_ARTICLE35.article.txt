# No. 3 Texas upsets Card
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
It all came down to the freestyle relay.
After easily defeating Pacific in its first dual meet
of the season Friday at deGuerre Pool, the No. 2
Stanford men's swimming team found a worthy op
ponent in archrival Texas the following day. The
Cardinal and the Longhorns battled within three
points of each other the entire meet, until No 3
Texas finally pulled ahead for a 59-54 win.
Although Stanford led the meet 54-52 going into
the 400-yard freestyle relay, the clash of titans came
down to that one race.
The Cardinal group of Doug Lillydahl, John
Hodge, Matt Nance and John Witchel could not
hold on to its slim lead against the Longhorn
sprinters, bowing by a mere seven-tenths of a
second.
The loss was only Stanford's second dual meet
defeat in four years. Texas also beat the Cardinal
last year. Saturday's defeat was Stanford's first loss
at home since it was defeated by Arizona State in
January 1982. Since that time the Cardinal has gone
56-2 in dual meets.
"I definitely thought we could win the meet"
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney said. "This Texas
squad is better than I thought, and we have some
holes a little bigger than I thought."

The Cardinal was led by sophomore Witchel, who
was victorious in both the 200- and 500-yard
freestyle events, senior tri-captain Matt Nance, the
winner of the 200 individual medley and 200 back
stroke, and senior tri-captain Anthony Mosse, who
won the 200 butterfly.
"Stanford's got good swimmers, and the team is
definitely going to do well in NCAAs," Texas
Coach Eddie Reese said.
The individual victories were not the only high
lights of the Cardinal's effort. In only his second col
lege meet, freshman breaststroker Matt Rodgers
took second in the 200-yard event. Sophomores
Doug Lillydahl and Rick Gould also had strong per
formances. Lillydahl placed third in the 100
freestyle, and Gould took third in the 200 back
stroke event.
While the loss to the Longhorns is a setback, it
isn't hugely significant; Stanford trains to swim at its
fastest at the season's end, rather than at the begin
ning of the year. The Cardinal will look to peak at
the NCAA Championships in April.
"When you lose a superstar (11-time NCAA
champion Pablo Morales), others have to step up,"
he said. "We haven't done that yet."
The team as a unit does not compete again until
January. Four swimmers, however, will represent
Stanford in the United States Open Dec. 20-22 in
Orlando, Fla.
