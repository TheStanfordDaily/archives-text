# Rugby finds joy in mudville

Spending a day sliding around on a wet field
and tackling people in the mud and grime may
not strike a lot of people as a great way to spend a
Saturday, but that's exactly what over 1000 rugby
players did last weekend at Maloney Field.
The various college and club players,
representing more than 60 teams from the Bay
Area and across the country, were on the Farm to
compete in the Stanford 10-a-side Rugby Tour
nament, which has become one of the foremost
rugby events in the West.
Stanford's rugby teams, which competed in
four of the five divisions, fared extremely well in
the tourney. The Cardinal first team, playing in
division B, finished with a 2-1 record in the
round-robin portion of play. The team downed
UC-Davis in its first game 13-8 behind two tries
by freshman Simon Fleming-Wood. In its second
game, eventual division B champion UC-Santa
Cruz trounced the Cardinal 28-0. Playing Santa
Cruz's second team in its final match of the day,
Stanford won, 22-0.
In division C, the Cardinal also posted a record
of 2-1, winning one game by forfeit. The team's
freshmen, competing in division D, had the most
successful day for the Stanford men, winning tour
games before losing in the finals. The Stanford
women took top honors among the Cardinal
teams, walking away with the first-place trophy in
the women's division.

"I was a little disappointed with the first team
(after the Santa Cruz loss), but then we came on
strong in the end," Stanford Coach Kahu Pere
said. "I think they (the various Cardinal teams)
did tremendously, especially the freshmen. They
just played fantastic rugby."
Senior Brooks Olbrys also commented on the
strong play of the squad's new members. "I think
overall we did pretty well. We've improved a
lot," he said. "A lot of the players are doing ex
tremely well, especially the freshmen on our
second and third teams."
The tournament was held despite heavy rain
fall on Friday that made the playing condition of
the fields less than desirable. According to tour
nament director Dave Fujimoto, the event went
on as scheduled only after he reached a compro
mise with the Athletic Department.
"The event was canceled Friday afternoon be
cause they (the Athletic Department) were
worried that playing on the fields when they were
in that condition would ruin the football practice
fields," he said. "Then after a few hours, they
gave the go-ahead because the overnight forecast
was for clear skies. However, we played on the
contingency that none of the fields would get
messed up."
Freshman Tony Loffredo, a reserve on Stan
ford's division B team, didn't think the poor con
ditions had much of an effect on the quality of
play. "Actually, they (the fields) weren't too bad
at all," he said. "I didn't think the fields had any
bearing on the outcomes."
