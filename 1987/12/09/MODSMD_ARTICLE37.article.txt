# Grapplers tackled in Vegas
## 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
Stanford's young wrestling
team went into the Las Vegas In
vitational tournament in Las
Vegas last weekend with hopes of
gaining some experience.
What they emerged with was
something slightly better: Stan
ford placed 26th in a field of over
40 of the nation's top wrestling
programs and two grapplers
fought their way to within one
match of placing within the top
eight finishers in their weight
class.
Arizona State was the tourna
ment's overall victor, with Okla
homa State and Oklahoma
second and third, respectively.
Dan Gable's lowa team finished
sixth, while last year's NCAA
champions, lowa State, finished a
surprising seventh.
Stanford's finish was respect
able for a squad that finished at
the bottom of its own conference
last season. "The team as a whole
wrestled pretty well," senior
Terry Mclntyre said.
Mclntyre was one of the Stan
ford grapplers who finished
within a round of placing in the
top eight spots of his weight class.

After wrestling four matches,
which lasted until 11:30 p.m. Fri
day, he was eliminated from the
tournament Saturday by a pin
from Utah State's 190-pound
entry.
Sophomore Steve Yarbrough
was the other Stanford wrestler
who competed Saturday. He
twisted his left knee doing a
"kickout" maneuver during a
match Friday, then lost 6-5 to a
wrestler from Nebraska Saturday.
"He won the match, but
sacrificed his knee making the
move," Stanford Coach Chris
Horpel said. "The injury made
him less effective later in the
tournament, although he didn't
use that as an excuse."
At 134 pounds, Josh Lisle was
beaten in his first match by Okla
homa State's John Smith, who has
the distinction of being the only
collegiate wrestler ever to win a
world championship. Lisle was
eliminated from the tournament
in the next round by San Jose
State's Greg Eisner, 8-5. Lisle
lost to Eisner earlier this season
in a 12-6 decision.
"I think it was neat to have
wrestled one of the best in the
world," Lisle said of Smith. "I
really had nothing to lose going

into that match."
James Dinette, at 142 pounds,
lost his first match. The victor
then lost in the next round of the
tournament, which meant Dinette
wasn't "carried" into eligibility
for the consolation bracket.
Geoff Baum, at 150-pounds,
beat a wrestler from BYU in his
first match, then lost in the
second round of the competition.
Loren Vigil also went 1-1, win
ning his first match then losing his
second. Freshman Steve Buddie,
at 167 pounds, was undefeated
going into the Las Vegas tourna
ment. He emerged with two wins
and two losses.
"It (the competition) was in
timidating. I'm going to concen
trate on my strength and on refin
ing my technique for the rest of
the season," Buddie said.
Also competing in Buddie's
bracket was former Cardinal
wrestler Dave Lee. Lee trans
ferred to Wisconsin after his
sophomore season at Stanford.
At Las Vegas, he worked his way
to the finals against defending
NCAA champion Royce Alger,
only to lose by one point.
