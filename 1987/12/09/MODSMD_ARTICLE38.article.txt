### Chris Myers Editorial staff 
The Stanford baseball team is
on the road back to Omaha, and
the road starts in Taiwan.
The defending NCAA cham
pion Cardinal opened its season
with two victories in three
games over the weekend in the

Taipei International Tourna
ment in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
The Cardinal beat Taiwan 6-5
Friday, lost to Japan 9-3 Sun
day, and beat Venezuela 9-1
Monday.
The Cardinal — invited to
represent the United States in
the tournament on the basis of
its victory in the College World

Series in Omaha, Neb., last June
— faced Puerto Rico yesterday,
but game results were not
available at press time. The
team was scheduled to travel to
raipei, Taiwan, today to begin
play against the top three teams
from the round-robin tourna
ment's other bracket.
In Friday's game, the Cardi

nal started slowly, trailing 4-1
after the first inning. But Stan
ford fought back with three runs
in the second and added two in
the sixth to hold on behind the
relief pitching of freshman Stan
Spencer and junior Steve
Chitren, both of whom, like all
of Stanford's pitchers this
season, are right-handed.
Spencer, a Vancouver, Wash.,
native making his first appear
ance in a Stanford uniform,
came on in relief of junior
starter Brian Keyser in the
fourth. He went one-and-two
thirds innings, gave up one hit
and no runs and struck out one
to pick up the win.
Chitren, Stanford's bullpen
stopper last year, threw four
strong innings to close out the
win. He allowed only two hits
while walking five and striking
out four to get the save.
Junior first baseman Ron
Witmeyer delivered the game
winning hit — a two-run home
run in the sixth inning.
Spencer didn't fare as well in
a starting role Sunday against
Japan. He gave up 13 hits and
six runs in six innnings before
being relieved by sophomore
Robbie Kamerschen and junior
Mike Zuercher.
First baseman Aoki Naka
homa led the Japanese attack.

going five-for-six with two home
runs and two doubles.
Stanford batters struck out 14
times, and 11 Cardinal baserun
ners were left standing. A home
run by senior catcher Doug
Robbins was one of the few
highlights for the Cardinal.
Keyser came back Monday
against Venezuela, yielding one
run on just four hits in seven in
nings. Highly touted freshman
Mike Mussina of Montoursville,
Pa., mopped up, going two in
nings, allowing no hits and strik
ing out three.
Witmeyer, who hit eight
home runs last season, again
paced the Cardinal with a
homer, Robbins was three-for
four with a double, and sopho
more quarterback turned-left
fielder Brian Johnson added two
hits, including a double, as the
Cardinal rolled, 9-1.
In other Stanford baseball
news, Coach Mark Marquess
added to his long list of honors.
Already named the 1987
NCAA Coach of the Year by
The Sporting News, Collegiate
Baseball and Baseball America,
Marquess on Monday was
named the Diamond Coach of
the Year.
