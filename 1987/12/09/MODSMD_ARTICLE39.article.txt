# Irate reader rips column criticism
## 
### 
This week I'd like to field a letter from
someone who disagreed with last week's
column.
To the editor:
As a fan, friend and follower of the Stan
ford basketball team, I would like to take
issue with several aspects of Chris Fialko's
Dec. 2 article titled "Cagers' loss in a nut
shell."

While I do not question Fialko's right to
print his opinions, I do take exception to his
insistence on singling out individuals and
holding them responsible for the loss. As a
piece of collegiate sports journalism, Fialko's
style of presentation is unwarranted, un
desired and juvenile.
1 feel that the Stanford basketball team,
which is comprised of 15 players and four
coaches, wins and loses as a unit, not as a indi
viduals. For attacks to (be) leveled in a sup

posedly partisan student publication is highly
suspect journalism. Fialko's comments appear
to serve no solid purpose unless his intent was
to make the players more upset about a heart
breaking one-point loss.
I would like to take particular offense with
Fialko's treatment of point-guard Scott
Meinert's performance. Had Fialko taken the
time or made the effort to talk with Scott's
teammates, or perhaps viewed the game with
the analytical abilities that one would expect
from a sports reporter, he would have quickly
realized that Meinert's performance was any
thing but "stop-gap."
To evaluate a point guard's performance
strictly in terms of three-point field goals
made, as Fialko would have us do, exhibits in
credible ignorance and lack of insight into a
point guard's role. He obviously overlooks
Meinert's contributions in the areas of leader
ship, defense, execution and ball movement.
Nor will Chris' comments do anything to bol
ster Meinert's future confidence.
I'm equally sure that it is not Fialko's place
to fault Bryan McSweeney's split-second deci
sion to throw the pass to Greg Butler under
the basket. To say Bryan's decision lacked ag
gression is also a fallacy. Nor, did I ever see
Howard Wright watching the ball be
rebounded while standing 20 feet from the
basket after attempting to block an 18-foot
jumpshot. Seriously, Chris, how much time

did you actually spend watching Howard
play?

Senior, economics.
Thanks for your letter, Rod.
1. My "unwarranted, undesired, and
juvenile" intention was not to upset the
players but rather to generate discussion on
why Stanford lost a ball game that it probably
should have won. This Cardinal team has
great potential, but let's hope that in March
we're not saying that this Cardinal team had
great potential.
2. Of course a point guard should not be
evaluated solely on three-point shots. Unfor
tunately, if I had taken the space to fully eval
uate Meinert's performance in that particular
game, he still would not have received a good
grade — he did not perform well. However:
3. Luckily, I obviously did not shake
Meinert's confidence; in the Apple Invita
tional he dished out seven assists, ran the of
fense well and did what he does best — drive
and hit the pull-up jumper. All players take
daily criticism from coaches, and although my
criticism was more public, I didn't think it
would paralyze Scott. Maybe you had inside
information?
4. Yes, I did see Wright watch from 20 feet
out after missing a block on an 8-foot jumper.
A big guy like Howard has a lot of momen
tum.
