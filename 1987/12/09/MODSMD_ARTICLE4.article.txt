# Two win Rhodes awards

### Chris Saigal Staff writer 
Senior geology major Charlie Jones and anthro
pology graduate student Stewart Patrick were
among 32 students nationwide named as Rhodes
scholars Saturday.
The scholarships, which draw students from
around the world, provide two years of study in any
field at Oxford University.
Harvard garnered 10 scholarships this year, the
most ever from any one institution. Three students
from Princeton received the honor, and UC-
Berkeley had one Rhodes winner.
Jones, a senior geology major from Omro, Wis.,
said he plans to study the interaction between evolv
ing life and the chemistry of the ocean and atmos
phere while at Oxford.
Asked how it felt to be a Rhodes scholar. Jones
said, "It's a little weird. . . . There seems to be a dis
parity between the 'ideal' Rhodes scholar and how I
know myself to be."
Jones has been actively involved in community
service while at Stanford. He said he has worked
part time for over a year as a tutor in East Palo Alto
and as a volunteer delivering food for the Stanford
Ecumenical Hunger Project.

He said he hopes to continue doing social work at
Oxford. "If you only study geology, you miss out on
some aspects of life," he said.
Jones credited his two-year living experience in
Synergy House with helping him earn the scholar
ship. "The intellectual conversations I had at Syn
ergy were a major part of what made me a broad
enough person to win the scholarship.'' he said.
Jones explained that his living experience prepared
him for interview questions such as, "Is any war
moral?"
Patrick graduated last year with distinction in
Human Biology and wrote a humanities honors the
sis. He is currently a teaching assistant for the
Human Biology core.
"I'm overwhelmed. I've wanted to do something
like this for a long time," Patrick said.
Patrick's concentration in Human Biology at
Stanford was "genetics and cultural evolution." He
said he plans to continue study in that field at Ox
ford; specifically, he said he hopes to develop a the
ory of cultural evolution. Patrick added that his
work entails "looking at evolutionary theory as
something that can be applied to more than biol
ogy"
