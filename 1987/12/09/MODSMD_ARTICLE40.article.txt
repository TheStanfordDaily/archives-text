# Fencing bows to perennial powers

### Mike Shay Staff writer 
Fencing some of the toughest
teams in the nation last weekend
at Northwestern, Stanford may
not have convinced anyone that it
was the best team around, but it
did show it knows how to fight.
The Cardinal men's fencing
team came away from the North
western meet, in Evanston, 111.,
with four wins and three losses.
Stanford defeated host North

western, Minnesota, Chicago and
Ohio State. It bowed to defending
national champion Notre Dame,
Illinois State and Wisconsin.
The Stanford women's team,
however, didn't fare as well; it
won two matches and lost three
on the weekend.
Several of the men's matches
went down to the last few bouts to
decide the overall winner. For ex
ample, the Cardinal beat North
western 14-13, the Wildcats
defeated Wisconsin 14-13 and

Stanford lost to Wisconsin by a
14-13 count.
"My experience was positive,"
Stanford men's Coach Zoran
Tulum said. "Everyone fenced,
including the reserves, and every
one tried."
The worst loss the Stanford
men suffered was against Notre
Dame. Against the Fighting Irish,
Stanford went down 19-8. Tulum,
however, said he was satisfied
with his team's performance
against such a high-caliber op

ponent.
' There were no 5-0 bouts. The
team knows it is competitive,"
Tulum said. "The men actually
beat Notre Dame in two weapons
(sabre and foil), only to lose by a
large margin in the epee."
The fencers will not see action
again until Jan. 23, when they
take on Air Force and Cal State
Fullerton.
"Air Force is our strongest op
ponent, possibly stronger then
Santa Cruz," Tulum.
