# Women's swimming jumps to fast start
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
After two straight seasons
playing second fiddle to the
defending national champion
Texas Longhorns, the Stanford
women's swimming team is the
team Jo beat this year.
With all of its starters returning
from a second-place NCAA
finish last season, except Michille
Griglione who is taking the year
off to train for the Olympics, the
Stanford women's swimming
team got off on the right track in
opening its 1987-88 season over
the weekend. In a dual meet Fri
day against Pacific at deGuerre
Pool, the Cardinal won by a 68-
27 margin over the outclassed
Tigers.
Several Cardinal swimmers
also competed in a senior long
course meet Saturday and Sun
day, again producing quality
results.
Stanford's first meet of the
season was a chance for many of
the swimmers to compete in
events other than those in which
they normally race; it also pro
vided the Cardinal with an oppor
tunity to swim competitively.
Stanford won 10 events, with
both junior Jenna Johnson and
senior Stacy Shupe winning a
pair. Johnson usually swims the
sprint freestyle events, but com
peted in longer races Friday, win
ning both the 200-yard free
(1:50.77) and the 500 free
(4:58.04).
Shupe, a distance freestyler,
won the 1000 free in 10:11.33
and senior Susan Rapp made it a
Stanford one-two finish by pos
ting a 10:44.42, more than a min
ute ahead of the rest of the field.
Shupe swam a 2:09.14 in the 200
butterfly for her second victory.
Sophomore Jessica Larntz posted
a 2:23.30 to take third in that
event.
Stanford Coach George Haines
said he was pleased with the prog
ress his swimmers have been
making this year. "Jenna
(Johnson) swam particularly well
in both meets," he said, adding
that "everyone swam well. We're
in probably better shape now that
any other team I've had at this
point in the season."
With everyone else pitching in,
the Cardinal won everv event but

the 400 freestyle relay. Freshman
Jody Smith, sophomores Jill
Johnson, Susannah Miller and
Laura Randall and junior Aimee
Berzins were also winners Friday,
as were divers Katie Connors and
Leslie Kleinheksel.
Smith swam a 2:08.30 in the
200 backstroke to edge senior
teammate Jennifer Pokluda
(2:11.52). Jill Johnson also led a
one-two Stanford finish, this one
in the 200 individual medley. She
finished in 2:12.86, with junior
Monica Nielebeck less than two
seconds behind.
Miller won the 50 free in 25.70,
Randall took the 200 breast
stroke in 2:29.30, and Berzins tri
umphed in the 100 free. Her
52.72 put her about five seconds
ahead of Rapp, who took third.
On the one-meter board, Con
nors took first and Kleinheksel
took second, while their order
was flip-flopped for the three
meter contest.
The long course meet also gave
the Cardinal a chance to shine.
Jenna Johnson won the 100 free
in 58.61, but more impressive was
the team's one-two-three-four
five finish in the 200 backstroke,
led by junior Michelle Donahue
(2:24.85). She was followed by
Smith, Miller, junior Jenny Shan
non and Pokluda, in that order.
Other highlights were second
place finishes by sophomore Bet
hanne Lambert (200 breast),
Shupe (200 fly) and Jenna
Johnson (200 free). In other top
four finishes, Metz had a third in
the 800 free and a fourth in the
200 fly, Berzins took fourth in the
100 free, Shupe had fourth in the
800 free, and Jill Johnson had a
pair of fourths in the 200 breast
and the 100 back.
Jill Johnson said she and her
teammates felt the times were all
very slow, but that that is to be
expected of a team that is doing
hard workouts each day.
"We did a 5000-meter workout
(Friday), the weather was (bad),"
she said, "(but) given the train
ing, 1 think we're doing well.
"We just need to get that 'We
can win NCAAs' attitude, and I
think we can win," Johnson said.
Stanford's next meet is at
deGuerre Pool Jan. 8 when the
Cardinal faces Arizona. The fol
lowing Saturday, Stanford hosts
San Jose State.
