## Dating and dining the Indian way

I think I should he honest and
admit that I am completely un
qualified to do a restaurant
review. I'm a picky eater, 1
rarely eat out, and my idea of a
nouveau dining experience is
trying Burger King instead of the
usual McDonald's.
So when 1 was confronted with
the prospect of reviewing Indian
cuisine at Nataraja restaurant in
Palo Alto, visions of dining on
curried curry danced in my head.
Face it, the concept of Indian
food is a little bit lost on most of
us. The scene in "Indiana Jones
and the Temple of Doom," in
which Jones and his swashbuck
ling date are offered a succulent
meal of live eels, monkey brains
and eyeball soup was sort of my
mental picture of what Indian
food might be like.
What is it they say — ignor
ance is next to godliness?
Nataraja, as it turns out,
features a diverse and delicious
menu (actually, the menu is
coated with plastic — not that de
licious). Although meat dishes —
lamb, chicken and beef — are the
staples of the menu, vegetarian
dishes with cheese and many
breads provide ample variety.
The restaurant is reasonably

small, with tasteful decor sug
gesting a classy Indian atmos
phere and colorful red and green
settings on the tables. My lovely
date (more about her later) and I
were shown to a plush and comfy
booth.
The nice thing about Indian
food is that you are allowed to
eat it like a normal person with
normal utensils. I have nothing
against chopsticks, but frankly,
I'd rather eat with a fork.

Before we proceed, I think it
should be duly noted that I was
out on an actual date with an ac
tual female. That's right — an ac
tual real live date. I know they
say nobody at Stanford dates,
but now I have, and let me tell
you, it's great!
While we waited for our food I
stared deeply into her eyes, and
she, in turn, stared over my
shoulder at the chef in the
kitchen who was sticking large

hunks of meat onto a skewer.
That's right, I was upstaged by a
shish-kebab.
For an appetizer, we had
papad, salty, starchy crackers
that look like fried tortillas and
come with a a dish containing dif
ferent sweet and sour sauces to
dip them in. I felt right at home
— even when you order McNug
gets you get a choice of sauces.
