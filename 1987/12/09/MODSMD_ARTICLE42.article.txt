## Dating and dining the Indian way

I think I should he honest and
admit that I am completely un
qualified to do a restaurant
review. I'm a picky eater, 1
rarely eat out, and my idea of a
nouveau dining experience is
trying Burger King instead of the
usual McDonald's.
So when 1 was confronted with
the prospect of reviewing Indian
cuisine at Nataraja restaurant in
Palo Alto, visions of dining on
curried curry danced in my head.
Face it, the concept of Indian
food is a little bit lost on most of
us. The scene in "Indiana Jones
and the Temple of Doom," in
which Jones and his swashbuck
ling date are offered a succulent
meal of live eels, monkey brains
and eyeball soup was sort of my
mental picture of what Indian
food might be like.
What is it they say — ignor
ance is next to godliness?
Nataraja, as it turns out,
features a diverse and delicious
menu (actually, the menu is
coated with plastic — not that de
licious). Although meat dishes —
lamb, chicken and beef — are the
staples of the menu, vegetarian
dishes with cheese and many
breads provide ample variety.
The restaurant is reasonably

small, with tasteful decor sug
gesting a classy Indian atmos
phere and colorful red and green
settings on the tables. My lovely
date (more about her later) and I
were shown to a plush and comfy
booth.
The nice thing about Indian
food is that you are allowed to
eat it like a normal person with
normal utensils. I have nothing
against chopsticks, but frankly,
I'd rather eat with a fork.

Before we proceed, I think it
should be duly noted that I was
out on an actual date with an ac
tual female. That's right — an ac
tual real live date. I know they
say nobody at Stanford dates,
but now I have, and let me tell
you, it's great!
While we waited for our food I
stared deeply into her eyes, and
she, in turn, stared over my
shoulder at the chef in the
kitchen who was sticking large

hunks of meat onto a skewer.
That's right, I was upstaged by a
shish-kebab.
For an appetizer, we had
papad, salty, starchy crackers
that look like fried tortillas and
come with a a dish containing dif
ferent sweet and sour sauces to
dip them in. I felt right at home
— even when you order McNug
gets you get a choice of sauces.

We decided to share what we
had chosen from the menu in or
der to sample a wider array of
foods at the restaurant. My fa
vorite was the burra kebab
($13.75) — tender pieces of lamb
marinated in a peppery sauce and
then broiled in the tandoori, an
Indian charbroiler. The lamb had
that wonderful tangy flavor char
acteristic of the meat, accented
favorably by the marinade.
Cooked perfectly, the lamb was
neither too dry nor underdone.
We also shared a tandoori
chicken dinner ($14.95), which
includes not only chicken
marinated overnight in yogurt
and spices and cooked in the
oven, but also rice pilaf and Daal
Makhni, a vegetable-like thing.
The chicken was delicious, al
though the portion was some
what small because the meat was
stil on the bone. The rice was
covered with a hot sauce — the
kind that you eat and then say
"Oh, this isn't that hot," and
then get hit by the second wave
and proceed to have a small ver
sion of the Iran-Iraq war occur in
your mouth.

The rice was covered
with a hot sauce — the
kind that you eat and
then say, l Oh, this isn't
that hot,' and then get
hit by the second wave.

Accompanying the meal was a
Naan basket. Naan is a thin,
doughy bread, lightly coated with
melted butter and baked so that it
bubbles on top. Being a big bread
fan, I found the Naan quite deli
cious.
One recommendation, though:
Eat the Naan with your meal in

stead of waiting until afterwards.
It should be used either to scoop
up choice parts of your meal, or,
for the less adventurous, as an
accompaniment to cut the spici
ness of the food.
For dessert I tried some of the
Indian ice cream, called Pistac
hio "saffron" Kulfi ($3.25). It is
very sweet; in a way similar to
vanilla ice cream with pistachios.
One difference is that instead of
being scooped into the dish, it is
cut into little disks that are then
stuck together to form what
looks like a conic dessert. After
sampling some of the Kulfi I
reverted to my perverse Ameri
can roots and had some choco
late ice cream.
For meat fans, Nataraja's
menu includes other foods
cooked in the tandoori, including
hamburger, beef and prawns.
These meats, as well as chicken
and lamb, are also available
cooked in a number of different
dishes with a variety of curry and
non-curry flavorings.
There are also many other
choices of breads, including
some stuffed with meat, as well
as cheese, potatoes, rices and
much more. Mattar Paneer, a
dish comprised of light cheese
cubes cooked with peas and
Lassi, a buttermilk mixed with
rose water or other flavoring
agents, come highly recom
mended from previous diners.
The only knock against the res
taurant came from my date, who
claimed that it was too bright
where we were sitting.
We found the cuisine to be ex
cellent and the atmosphere pleas
ant. A real bonus is that Nataraja
is situated conveniently close to
Stanford, on the left side of Uni
versity Avenue right after you
come under the bridge from Palm
Drive.
The prices are in the $10-$ 15
range, and the menu offers a
good selection of North Indian
food. For those looking for a nice
place to take a nice date — and
especially for those who don't
have cars — Nataraja is an excel
lent place to dine.

usual McDonald's.
So when 1 was confronted with
the prospect of reviewing Indian
cuisine at Nataraja restaurant in
Palo Alto, visions of dining on
curried curry danced in my head.
Face it, the concept of Indian
food is a little bit lost on most of
us. The scene in "Indiana Jones
and the Temple of Doom," in
which Jones and his swashbuck
ling date are offered a succulent
meal of live eels, monkey brains
and eyeball soup was sort of my
mental picture of what Indian
food might be like.
What is it they say — ignor
ance is next to godliness?
Nataraja, as it turns out,
features a diverse and delicious
menu (actually, the menu is
coated with plastic — not that de
licious). Although meat dishes —
lamb, chicken and beef — are the
staples of the menu, vegetarian
dishes with cheese and many
breads provide ample variety.
The restaurant is reasonably

small, with tasteful decor sug
gesting a classy Indian atmos
phere and colorful red and green
settings on the tables. My lovely
date (more about her later) and I
were shown to a plush and comfy
booth.
The nice thing about Indian
food is that you are allowed to
eat it like a normal person with
normal utensils. I have nothing
against chopsticks, but frankly,
I'd rather eat with a fork.

Before we proceed, I think it
should be duly noted that I was
out on an actual date with an ac
tual female. That's right — an ac
tual real live date. I know they
say nobody at Stanford dates,
but now I have, and let me tell
you, it's great!
While we waited for our food I
stared deeply into her eyes, and
she, in turn, stared over my
shoulder at the chef in the
kitchen who was sticking large

hunks of meat onto a skewer.
That's right, I was upstaged by a
shish-kebab.
For an appetizer, we had
papad, salty, starchy crackers
that look like fried tortillas and
come with a a dish containing dif
ferent sweet and sour sauces to
dip them in. I felt right at home
— even when you order McNug
gets you get a choice of sauces.

We decided to share what we
had chosen from the menu in or
der to sample a wider array of
foods at the restaurant. My fa
vorite was the burra kebab
($13.75) — tender pieces of lamb
marinated in a peppery sauce and
then broiled in the tandoori, an
Indian charbroiler. The lamb had
that wonderful tangy flavor char
acteristic of the meat, accented
favorably by the marinade.
Cooked perfectly, the lamb was
neither too dry nor underdone.
We also shared a tandoori
chicken dinner ($14.95), which
includes not only chicken
marinated overnight in yogurt
and spices and cooked in the
oven, but also rice pilaf and Daal
Makhni, a vegetable-like thing.
The chicken was delicious, al
though the portion was some
what small because the meat was
stil on the bone. The rice was
covered with a hot sauce — the
kind that you eat and then say
"Oh, this isn't that hot," and
then get hit by the second wave
and proceed to have a small ver
sion of the Iran-Iraq war occur in
your mouth.

The rice was covered
with a hot sauce — the
kind that you eat and
then say, l Oh, this isn't
that hot,' and then get
hit by the second wave.

Accompanying the meal was a
Naan basket. Naan is a thin,
doughy bread, lightly coated with
melted butter and baked so that it
bubbles on top. Being a big bread
fan, I found the Naan quite deli
cious.
One recommendation, though:
Eat the Naan with your meal in

stead of waiting until afterwards.
It should be used either to scoop
up choice parts of your meal, or,
for the less adventurous, as an
accompaniment to cut the spici
ness of the food.
For dessert I tried some of the
Indian ice cream, called Pistac
hio "saffron" Kulfi ($3.25). It is
very sweet; in a way similar to
vanilla ice cream with pistachios.
One difference is that instead of
being scooped into the dish, it is
cut into little disks that are then
stuck together to form what
looks like a conic dessert. After
sampling some of the Kulfi I
reverted to my perverse Ameri
can roots and had some choco
late ice cream.
For meat fans, Nataraja's
menu includes other foods
cooked in the tandoori, including
hamburger, beef and prawns.
These meats, as well as chicken
and lamb, are also available
cooked in a number of different
dishes with a variety of curry and
non-curry flavorings.
There are also many other
choices of breads, including
some stuffed with meat, as well
as cheese, potatoes, rices and
much more. Mattar Paneer, a
dish comprised of light cheese
cubes cooked with peas and
Lassi, a buttermilk mixed with
rose water or other flavoring
agents, come highly recom
mended from previous diners.
The only knock against the res
taurant came from my date, who
claimed that it was too bright
where we were sitting.
We found the cuisine to be ex
cellent and the atmosphere pleas
ant. A real bonus is that Nataraja
is situated conveniently close to
Stanford, on the left side of Uni
versity Avenue right after you
come under the bridge from Palm
Drive.
The prices are in the $10-$ 15
range, and the menu offers a
good selection of North Indian
food. For those looking for a nice
place to take a nice date — and
especially for those who don't
have cars — Nataraja is an excel
lent place to dine.
