Cenzo's
233 University Ave.,
Palo Alto
322-1846
Indistinguishable gruel on
yellow plastic trays. Sound
familiar? Certainly. Appetiz
ing? Hardly.
Cenzo's, an authentic Ital
ian trattoria in downtown Palo
Alto, offers a refreshing
change from the monotony of
Food Service.
Cenzo's casual, charming
ambiance, delicious food and
prompt, friendly service are
characteristic of the finest
eating establishments and are
truly light years ahead of any
thing a dorm can serve up on
its sallow, polypropylene plat
ters.
Cenzo's pays attention to
the nice little touches many
restaurants lack. Inside, pic
toral scenes of Italy and a map
of the country decorate the
walls, and brass-tinted mirrors
add to a modern, inviting at
mosphere.
The menu at Cenzo's is
quite extensive and offers a
wide variety of appetizers as
well as entrees.
The appetizers, which range
in price from about $4 up to

about $8, include steamed
clams and steamed mussels,
each served in a sauce smoth
ered in white wine, garlic,
onions and butter.
We sampled the deep fried
zucchini sticks, which came in
a marinara sauce topped with
melted mozzarella cheese.
While this appetizer was en
joyable, the number of zuc
chini sticks was less than
plentiful.
The salads at Cenzo's are
also quite good and relatively
inexpensive ($3 to $6). Partic
ularly enjoyable was the crisp
lettuce and tangy dressing of
the Caesar salad.
Cenzo's menu offers a wide
selection of entrees, some of
which are likely to excite your
taste buds.
Rhett sampled the tradi
tional fettuccini alfredo with
an immensely rich sauce that
prevented him from finishing
the dish.
Kevin ordered the veal pic
cata, which came in a tasty
white wine sauce topped with
peppercorns that gave an
added flair to the succulent
entree. Other offerings in
cluded an eggplant par
migiana, a favorite of all, as
well as a fresh snapper entree.
Entrees ranged in price from
about $7 to about $15.
