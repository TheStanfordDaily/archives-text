Describing a restaurant as a
"bar and grill" seems to be all
the rage these days — but in most
cases the term is a misnomer.
While "bar and grill' connotes a
casual atmosphere, most bars
and grills are actually fancy res
taurants.
California Cafe is a prime ex
ample. Although it is advertised
as a bar and grill, the restaurant's
atmosphere is decidedly elegant.
Any guy who shows up looking
for some brews and a good grilled
hot dog would be out of luck.
When my friend and 1 visited
California Cafe last week, the
restaurant was definitely in the
holiday spirit. Miniature poin
set-ti-as graced every table. The
place was filled with elegant
couples (read yuppies) drinking
white wine.
The restaurant's interior is
classy without being stuffy.
White wood, mirrors and art mix
with neon signs that label each
part of the restaurant's open
kitchen — the bakery, grill, etc.
The funky and the classy ele
ments blend together well.
Although the restaurant was
crowded, we were seated
quickly. When our waiter came
by to take our order, we wit
nessed the latest in restaurant
technology. Instead of writing
our order down on a small
notepad (as is done in most res
taurants), our waiter whipped out
a black computer, which closely
resembled a high-tech calculator,
and proceeded to punch in our
order.
Obviously, California Cafe
tries to take the fun out of my
dad's favorite pastimes — inter
preting the check at the end of

the meal. These computers
should be mandatory equipment
at all Japaneses and Chinese res
taurants where the waiters take
your order in their respective lan
guages — making it all but impos
sible to examine the check.
While our waiter knew what
buttons to push on his computer
and was helpful in suggesting
what we should order, he was a
little overbearing. "You really
don't want two tapas plates, do
you?" he said when my friend
mistakenly ordered the same ap
petizer 1 had just ordered.
"You gotta hate getting your
hand slapped by a waiter," my
friend mumbled afterwards.
For starters, we ordered the
tapas sampler ($10), which in
cluded Apalchicola oysters on
the half shell with caper cocktail
sauce, chilled mussels with sauce
rouille, pasta salad, turkey em
panadillas, and mixed seafood
ceviche.
Tapas, little dishes that come
from Spain, is the new trendy

thing to serve at even trendier
restaurants. Our favorite was the
ceviche (small bits of salmon and
white fish marinated in a tart
lemon sauce), which my friend (a
ceviche connoisseur) pronoun
ced as "pretty good, almost as
good as my mom's."
I would suggest that one skip
the oysters, if at all possible. The
feeling of a slimy oyster slipping
down my throat put a damper on
my tapas experience.
For our main course, I ordered
the steamed New Zealand king
salmon with pesto vinagrette
($15.95). The dish came with a
huge portion of incredibly tender
(bordering on raw) salmon
topped with a green, mustardy
pesto sauce, making for an inter
esting flavor combination.
My friend ordered the grilled
veal loin chop with mendocino
mustard butter ($14.95). The dish
included a huge serving of veal
topped with a scoop of mustard
butter that liquified to form a
sauce, accentuating the smoky
flavor of the veal.

The two best things about the
California Cafe, besides its am
biance, were the huge portions of
food and the menu. A new menu
is printed up every day, so a wide
variety of dishes are always of
fered.
Although we were full at the
end of the meal, we could hardly
pass up dessert. Succumbing to
temptation, I ordered the white
chocolate decadence ($3.50),
which lived up to its name. I
couldn't finish the rich hunk of
whipped white chocolate sur
rounded by raspberry sauce. My
friend alleviated some of my guilt
by ordering the New York
cheesecake, also topped with
raspberry sauce. He couldn't
finish, either.
California Cafe, located in the
Stanford Barn — on Welsh Road
near the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter — is an expensive place to
eat, but well worth the money.
Its unique cuisine and elegant at
mosphere make it the perfect
place to spend a special evening.
