## Spielberg's latest highlights holiday film list 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
Winter break is a time of being
reunited with loved ones, of
sharing in the warmth and joyous
spirit of the yuletide season, and
of getting your stomach reac
customed to home-cooking. It's
also a time for seeing a lot of
movies.
Even though Stanford only
gets two weeks off for winter va
cation (as opposed to Berkeley,
which gets something like two
months off), one still has quite a
bit of time to fill in between

meeting relatives, fighting the
crowds at shopping malls and
taking ski trips.
The holidays are a great time
to see movies because the
studios, in anticipation of tradi
tionally strong box office busi
ness, release some of their big
gest movies of the year at this
time of year. It's also the time
when the "prestige-quality"
pictures are released before the
year is over in order to be eligible
for Academy Award considera
tion.
This year, the holidays will
witness the arrival of movies of

all sizes and shapes — comedies,
dramas, historical epics and
curiousity pieces. At the top of
the list, the two movies which
promise to be the most talked
about, if not the most successful,
releases of the winter are Steven
Spielberg's "Empire of the Sun''
and Oliver Stone's "Wall
Street."
"Empire of the Sun," Spiel
berg's first work as director since
"The Color Purple," is based on
J.G. Ballard's international be
stseller, which tells the story of a
young boy's experiences as a
prisoner with his parents in a
Japanese internment camp
during World War 11.
Hmm, a view of war as seen
through the eyes of a child, huh?
Sounds a lot like John Boorman's
"Hope and Glory," but no doubt
Spielberg will make the project
distinctly his own by using a lot
of magically sunny scenes,
sweeping camera movements
and a John Williams score which
never fails to swell when some
thing emotional is happening.
Initial critical reaction to
"Empire of the Sun" has been
mixed, though it has leaned
toward the positive side. Never
theless, Spielberg's name means
big bucks, and those who are
suckered in by Spielberg's
"magic" will undoubtedly gener
ate enough word-of-mouth inter
est to make this a big hit.
Another big name director
with a new film is Oliver Stone.

"Wall Street" is Stone's follow
up to his Oscar-winning "Pla
toon." Although I thought "Pla
toon" was a good film, I didn't
think it deserved Best Picture
and I didn't think Stone deserved
Best Director award. As a result,
I have reservations about "Wall
Street;" I'm not sure if Stone can
make a good movie without the
benefit of machine guns and the
Vietcong.
Despite the timeliness of its
subject, Stone almost didn't want
to release the movie because it
was too soon after the stock mar
ket crash and he felt that people
wouldn't want to see a movie
they thought dealt with a similar
subject.
On the contrary, I think the
stock market crash is the best
publicity stunt this movie could
ever have had, and because of
that there will be a lot of strong
initial box office business.
However, whether or not the
movie becomes a blockbuster hit
will of course, depend on the
merits of the film itself.
One other film which will be
generating a lot of interest but
will only be opening in a few
major cities is "Ironweed," the
new Jack Nicholson-Meryl
Streep vehicle based on the Pulit
zer Prize-winning novel by
William Kennedy. I just hope
this movie doesn't turn out to be
as bad as "Heartburn," the last
Nicholson-Streep collaboration.
Not everything will be dra

matic this Christmas. There will
be another Steven Spielberg pro
duction, "Batteries Not In
cluded" and some comedies, in
cluding "Throw Momma From
the Train" with Danny De Vito
and Billy Crystal, and "Over
board" with Goldie Hawn and
Kurt Russell.
In addition to this, there are

the many Thanksgiving releases
you may have missed, like
"Three Men and a Baby,"
"Planes, Trains and Auto
mobiles" and"The Last Em
peror." All in all, there will be
plenty of movies to choose from
when you and your family are
trying to figure out what to do
during the holidays.

they thought dealt with a similar
subject.
On the contrary, I think the
stock market crash is the best
publicity stunt this movie could
ever have had, and because of
that there will be a lot of strong
initial box office business.
However, whether or not the
movie becomes a blockbuster hit
will of course, depend on the
merits of the film itself.
One other film which will be
generating a lot of interest but
will only be opening in a few
major cities is "Ironweed," the
new Jack Nicholson-Meryl
Streep vehicle based on the Pulit
zer Prize-winning novel by
William Kennedy. I just hope
this movie doesn't turn out to be
as bad as "Heartburn," the last
Nicholson-Streep collaboration.
Not everything will be dra

matic this Christmas. There will
be another Steven Spielberg pro
duction, "Batteries Not In
cluded" and some comedies, in
cluding "Throw Momma From
the Train" with Danny De Vito
and Billy Crystal, and "Over
board" with Goldie Hawn and
Kurt Russell.
In addition to this, there are

the many Thanksgiving releases
you may have missed, like
"Three Men and a Baby,"
"Planes, Trains and Auto
mobiles" and"The Last Em
peror." All in all, there will be
plenty of movies to choose from
when you and your family are
trying to figure out what to do
during the holidays.

Thinking of spending a lot of money for the Holidays? Wait until you
see Oliver Stone's new film, "Wall Street," starring Charlie Sheen.
Winter break is a time of being
reunited with loved ones, of
sharing in the warmth and joyous
spirit of the yuletide season, and
of getting your stomach reac
customed to home-cooking. It's
also a time for seeing a lot of
movies.
Even though Stanford only
gets two weeks off for winter va
cation (as opposed to Berkeley,
which gets something like two
months off), one still has quite a
bit of time to fill in between

meeting relatives, fighting the
crowds at shopping malls and
taking ski trips.
The holidays are a great time
to see movies because the
studios, in anticipation of tradi
tionally strong box office busi
ness, release some of their big
gest movies of the year at this
time of year. It's also the time
when the "prestige-quality"
pictures are released before the
year is over in order to be eligible
for Academy Award considera
tion.
This year, the holidays will
witness the arrival of movies of

all sizes and shapes — comedies,
dramas, historical epics and
curiousity pieces. At the top of
the list, the two movies which
promise to be the most talked
about, if not the most successful,
releases of the winter are Steven
Spielberg's "Empire of the Sun''
and Oliver Stone's "Wall
Street."
"Empire of the Sun," Spiel
berg's first work as director since
"The Color Purple," is based on
J.G. Ballard's international be
stseller, which tells the story of a
young boy's experiences as a
prisoner with his parents in a
Japanese internment camp
during World War 11.
Hmm, a view of war as seen
through the eyes of a child, huh?
Sounds a lot like John Boorman's
"Hope and Glory," but no doubt
Spielberg will make the project
distinctly his own by using a lot
of magically sunny scenes,
sweeping camera movements
and a John Williams score which
never fails to swell when some
thing emotional is happening.
Initial critical reaction to
"Empire of the Sun" has been
mixed, though it has leaned
toward the positive side. Never
theless, Spielberg's name means
big bucks, and those who are
suckered in by Spielberg's
"magic" will undoubtedly gener
ate enough word-of-mouth inter
est to make this a big hit.
Another big name director
with a new film is Oliver Stone.

"Wall Street" is Stone's follow
up to his Oscar-winning "Pla
toon." Although I thought "Pla
toon" was a good film, I didn't
think it deserved Best Picture
and I didn't think Stone deserved
Best Director award. As a result,
I have reservations about "Wall
Street;" I'm not sure if Stone can
make a good movie without the
benefit of machine guns and the
Vietcong.
Despite the timeliness of its
subject, Stone almost didn't want
to release the movie because it
was too soon after the stock mar
ket crash and he felt that people
wouldn't want to see a movie
they thought dealt with a similar
subject.
