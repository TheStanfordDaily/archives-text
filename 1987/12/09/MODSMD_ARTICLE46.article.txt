# Mastroianni makes 'Dark Eyes' worth seeing
## 
### Jennifer Reese Staff writer 
Two aging men meet in a ship's dining room and
begin to talk. They smoke cigars, have a drink and
exchange personal stories; one of the stories swells
and comes to dominate the movie. It's the story of
Romano Patroni, a Casanova gone-to-seed, and his
brief, shaking love affair with a Russian woman.
Sitting in the ship's dining room telling the story,
Romano (played by Marcello Mastroianni) is a
greasy, run-down old man. But in the flashbacks to
his love affair, which comprise the movie, "Dark
Eyes," he is a plump, smooth, brown-eyed
charmer living out a comfortable middle age with
his wealthy wife Elisa.
Romano is the quintessential Latin man: He
loves the good life and the ladies. He doesn't have
a malicious bone in his body, nor a responsible one.
He leaves his wife to deal with the financial crisis
they're facing, and he goes to "take the waters" at
a spa, where he can freely chase women and enjoy
himself.

At the spa he meets Anna, a sour-faced, sad Rus
sian woman. He befriends her, seduces her and
falls madly in love with her. She goes back to Rus
sia, and he eventually goes to find her again in one
last great romantic gesture.
This is the story Romano tells, and it is filled with
humor and sadness. It is alternately side-splittingly
funny and haunting. The combination makes for a
nostalgic feeling that pervades the film.
"Dark Eyes" is a visually stunning movie. It
lavishly recreates the turn-of-the-century period it
is set in. It looks like a companion piece to "A
Room With a View," only with even more detail

and beauty. Some of the scenes are so dazzling
they make one's eyes tingle.
However, the physical beauty of the film is not
enough to blind one to its flaws. Much of the plot
here is indifferent and lacks conviction. Romano's
allegedly great love for Anna does not bear the
weight of the movie; it simply isn't convincing or
moving. It's as though the energy and effort here
went into creating the perfect atmosphere, leaving
the plot a little thin.
The best scenes of this movie — and these are
really wonderful — are the incidental scenes, the
ones that don't necessarily have any bearing on the
plot. The movie consists of a lot of brilliant mo
ments poorly strung together by a weak story line.
The acting in this movie is exceptional.
Mastroianni is perfect as Romano: He embodies
the good-humored lechery, the joy and pathos of an
essentially irresponsible but kind man. He is un
questionably the center of the movie; without him
the whole thing would surely crumble.
The actors in smaller roles are colorful and good.
Silvana Mangano is terrific as Romano's aris

tocratic wife Elisa; she brings charisma to a poten
tially thankless role. Marthe Keller is funny and
pretty as Elisa's best friend. These two actresses
are gems; their performances are a large part of
what makes the movie succeed somewhat, despite
its flimsy script.
The character of Anna must have been a difficult
one to cast: the film depends on her being irresisti
ble to Romano. 1 don't think Elena Sofonova has
much irresistible appeal; she has a wistful, pinched
face, and she's markedly different from Mangano
and Keller, who have warmer, stronger styles, and
are more fun to watch. Hut she appears sad and
vulnerable, and if you try real hard it's possible to
see what draws Romano to her.
"Dark Eyes" is a spectacular movie, but it is
slow. A few times the engine dies, and the movie
doesn't seem to go anywhere. The plot is
sometimes sappy and tedious; but there really
aren't many movies this gorgeous. The acting is ex
cellent, and beneath a limp storyline there are some
interesting ideas that are never fully explored.

a spa, where he can freely chase women and enjoy
himself.

At the spa he meets Anna, a sour-faced, sad Rus
sian woman. He befriends her, seduces her and
falls madly in love with her. She goes back to Rus
sia, and he eventually goes to find her again in one
last great romantic gesture.
This is the story Romano tells, and it is filled with
humor and sadness. It is alternately side-splittingly
funny and haunting. The combination makes for a
nostalgic feeling that pervades the film.
"Dark Eyes" is a visually stunning movie. It
lavishly recreates the turn-of-the-century period it
is set in. It looks like a companion piece to "A
Room With a View," only with even more detail

and beauty. Some of the scenes are so dazzling
they make one's eyes tingle.
However, the physical beauty of the film is not
enough to blind one to its flaws. Much of the plot
here is indifferent and lacks conviction. Romano's
allegedly great love for Anna does not bear the
weight of the movie; it simply isn't convincing or
moving. It's as though the energy and effort here
went into creating the perfect atmosphere, leaving
the plot a little thin.
The best scenes of this movie — and these are
really wonderful — are the incidental scenes, the
ones that don't necessarily have any bearing on the
plot. The movie consists of a lot of brilliant mo
ments poorly strung together by a weak story line.
The acting in this movie is exceptional.
Mastroianni is perfect as Romano: He embodies
the good-humored lechery, the joy and pathos of an
essentially irresponsible but kind man. He is un
questionably the center of the movie; without him
the whole thing would surely crumble.
The actors in smaller roles are colorful and good.
Silvana Mangano is terrific as Romano's aris

tocratic wife Elisa; she brings charisma to a poten
tially thankless role. Marthe Keller is funny and
pretty as Elisa's best friend. These two actresses
are gems; their performances are a large part of
what makes the movie succeed somewhat, despite
its flimsy script.
The character of Anna must have been a difficult
one to cast: the film depends on her being irresisti
ble to Romano. 1 don't think Elena Sofonova has
much irresistible appeal; she has a wistful, pinched
face, and she's markedly different from Mangano
and Keller, who have warmer, stronger styles, and
are more fun to watch. Hut she appears sad and
vulnerable, and if you try real hard it's possible to
see what draws Romano to her.
"Dark Eyes" is a spectacular movie, but it is
slow. A few times the engine dies, and the movie
doesn't seem to go anywhere. The plot is
sometimes sappy and tedious; but there really
aren't many movies this gorgeous. The acting is ex
cellent, and beneath a limp storyline there are some
interesting ideas that are never fully explored.
"Dark Eyes" is almost a terrific movie.
