# Stanford alum hits the big time in Hollywood
## 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
With a track record that in
cludes such box office hits as
"The Terminator" and "Aliens,"
Gale Anne Hurd has established
herself as one of Hollywood's
most talented young movie pro
ducers. Not only that, Hurd is
also a Stanford graduate.
There are a lot of people who
say that if you want to go into
film, don't go to Stanford. Al
though Stanford does have a
communication major, it really
doesn't stress film. There is a
graduate film program, it is
mainly geared toward documen
tary film production.
For a student interested in
feature film production, it would
seem that UCLA or USC would
be the best place. Hurd is the ex
ception that proves the rule.
After graduating Phi Beta
Kappa from Stanford in 1977
with a double major in economics
and communication, Hurd started
her career at New World Pictures,
a studio not only known for
producing cheaply-made ex
ploitation flicks but also for fos
tering new talent and being a
launching pad for the likes of
Francis Ford Coppola and Stan
ley Kubrick. While there, she was
involved in advertising and
publicity. She eventually became
involved with the production of
numerous New World films, in
cluding "Battle Beyond the
Stars" and "Smokey Bites the
Dust."
She left New World Pictures in
1982 to form her own indepen
dent production and development
company, Pacific Western Pro
ductions. It was through Pacific
Western that she produced "The
Terminator" and "Aliens." She is
currently in the midst of produc
ing a detective action thriller
!called "Outer Heat," with James
;Caan and Terence Stamp.

Daily: Okay, let me kick this in
terview off by asking the standard
college newspaper question of
how did you decide on your
career? Why did you choose to go
into producing films?
Hurd: Actually, producing
chose me. When I was looking for
employment, Steve Kovacs, who
was a film professor at Stanford
and who had worked for Roger
Corman at the old New World
Pictures, had recommended me
for a job. One day, I received a
letter out of the blue from Roger
Corman, asking if I was interested
in a career in film.
Daily: Wow, not many people
get an invitation like that.
Hurd: No, I was very fortunate.
When I met with Corman, he
asked what I ultimately wanted to
do in film. I really wasn't sure, but
I was so nervous and I knew I'd
blow the interview if I didn't
come up with an answer. Corman
had a long and successful career
producing films, so in about three
seconds I said, "producing."
Daily: What was it like working
for the old New World? I mean,
was it like someone would imag
ine it to be, with monsters and
laser beams all over the place?
Hurd: It was like that. All the
production work emanated from
a facility which was a rehabilita
tive lumber company. Nothing
worked there, and it was always
flooded. Whenever we were
doing special effects shooting, we
were always standing in about a
foot of water. 1 guess we were
lucky we didn't get electrocuted.
Daily: It sounds like quite an
experience. I'll bet you had a
great time working there.
Hurd: Oh, yeah, New World
was the most incredible place to
start. You learned everything.
You learned every facet of film
production. Working there is just
the best time and worst time of
your life.
Daily: Why was it the worst

time?
Hurd: Well, Roger really en
courages you, he instills a belief
that you can accomplish anything.
It was the worst time because
you're-never quite sure if you
merit that kind of confidence
from someone. Also, you're
working constantly for very little
money, and you have no time for
yourself. But still, it was a great
experience.
Daily: Now that you're a suc
cessful film producer, how do you
choose your projects? What is it
that attracts you to a project?

Gale Anne Hurd has
established herself
as one of Holly
wood's most
talented young
movie producers.

Hurd: I don't think there's an
exact formula. It can be anything
— it can be the way a writer puts
a twist on an old plot or the way
it's written; there's something
about it that just hits you. I get a
lot of spec screenplays, and that's
only happened to me three times,
and I've produced two of those
scripts — " The Terminator" and
"Aliens."
Daily: What was the other
script?
Hurd: A drama which I really
love called "The Silent Man,"
about apartheid. It'd be hard to
do it now, and it's been turned
down because "Cry Freedom" is
out, but I'd like to do it. Maybe
it'll be one of those movies like
"Platoon" which is made 10 years
later, after being turned down by
everybody.
Daily: Once you choose a proj

ect, what is your role as pro
ducer?
Hurd: My greatest involvement
is planning a property, choosing
and working with the director,
polishing a script, and I'm very in
volved with casting. I also am in
volved with hiring key crew mem
bers and with a lot of crisis man
agement.
Daily: Speaking of crisis man
agement, how was Arnold
Schwarzenegger? Did he ever
give you any trouble?
Hurd: I' m not sure about his
other films, but on "The Ter
minator" he was a complete pro
fessional. "Aliens" was the
toughest film I've done, because
it was made in another country
and there were more details to be
worked out with filming in
Pinewood Studios in London and
dealing with the attitudes of
people.
Daily: How did the communi
cation major at Stanford help you
in preparing for you career, or did
it? Maybe economics was better.
What best prepared you?
Hurd: Neither major helped
me. What I got out of Stanford
was a great education that taught
me how to think, how to write
precisely and how to express
myself. I also learned how to ma
nipulate. Those are the skills I
needed. Communication was a
good way to approach film
theoretically, but the overall edu
cation helped me the most.
Daily: So, what advice would
you give to Stanford film stu
dents?
Hurd: C ome to Los Angeles
and be willing to work as a slave
as a production assistant. Be per
sistent, offer to do anything.
These entry level jobs have a high
turnover rate. I'm always looking
for someone. The biggest prob
lem people have when they come
here is attitude. They're not will
ing to make sacrifices. They think
that since they have a degree

from Stanford or UCLA or some
thing, they're owed something. If
you're good and put a lot of work
into it, you'll move up.
Daily: What are some of your
future plans? Will there be an
"Aliens III" and a "Terminator
II?."
Hurd: There will be an "Aliens
lll,'' but I won't be doing it. Ne
gotiations for "Terminator II"
have been going on since the first
movie came out. I do have a
detective thriller called "Outer
Heat" coming out soon, and I'll
also be working on a film called
"The Abyss," which James
Cameron will direct.
Daily: Would you like to try

your hand at directing, or do you
think you'll do more writing?
Hurd: In terms of directing, I
don't know. I'm an OK writer.
There is so much talent out there,
I wouldn't presume to write
something when there are better
people. I'm more a technician,
I'm good at editing and oversee
ing various jobs like that.
Daily: Tell me a little some
thing about your days here at
Stanford. What kind of person
were you? Were you a partier?
Were you studious?
Hurd: I was both. I tried not to
miss any parties, and I still
graduated Phi Beta Kappa, so I
guess it worked out.
