# Beer ads: It doesn't get any better than this
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
Advertisements for beer are
among the most stupid things on
television. I say "among," of
course, because I want to leave
room for the presidential debates
and "Alf." Come to think of it. I
want to leave room in the presi
dential debates for Alf.
Selling beer on television isn't
the easiest thing to do, primarily
because advertisers aren't
allowed to show actors actually
drinking the stuff. I guess the
rationale here is that it's more
moralistic to only advocate the
selling of beer and not the drink
ing of it. God forbid that a guy
who buys a six-pack should actu
ally drink it.
Anyway, because of this
holier-than-thou rule, Madision
Avenue has had to come up with
new and sexy ways to show
buddies having a great time
holding beer:
It's been a long, hot day in the
sun. Your wife left you for a Pen
tecostal minister; construction
workers dropped a small crane
onto your BMW. It's time to stop

into a bar, sit down next to a
washed up sports figure and hold
onto an ice cold beer.
Also, people are shown drink
ing — or holding, as the case may
be — beer at all kinds of social
functions where, in real life, pop
ping open a beer would be about
as socially acceptable as picking
your nose. Dinner at the White
House? Pop open a tall one. Just
given a terrific sermon? Hold
onto a cool one. Ready to finally
perform that refreshing 10-hour
brain surgery? It's Miller time.
Of course, because these ac
tors don't have anything to do
while they're holding their beers,
a great deal of discussion goes on
about the contents and appear
ance of the beer. I know that
every time I open a beer I pause
to tell my friends how glad I am
that it is made of the finest
quality malt, barley, hops and
cold Rocky Mountain spring
water.
But if it's pure stupidity you
want, look no further than the
nifty slogans the advertisers
devise for their beers:
After years of being "fire

brewed" — a process which, as
far as 1 can tell, involves bar
becuing a can of beer over hick
ory smoke — Stroh's has come
up with "Stroh's is spoken
here." Send now for your
Stroh's-English/English-Stroh's
dictionary. A guttural, slurred
language, Stroh's is also offered
through Stanford's Department
of Linguistics.
Miller has devised a campaign
to reflect the pride America has
in its products: "Miller's made
the American way." That's good
to know. Just as reliable as an
American car, huh? Frankly, I
think I'd rather stick to one of
those sporty German-engineered
beers.
Or "Hamm's, the beer refresh
ing." As far as I can tell, this sen
tence is not even correct English.
Maybe it's a dialect of Stroh's?
Anyway, Hamm's doesn't even
show people holding beer, but
rather a cartoon bear and a car
toon rabbit holding beer. How
about "Hamm's, the beer unfit
for humans?"
Mark Harmon allows that
"Coors is the one." The one

what?
One of the most repulsive ad
campaigns is for Bud Light, with
Spuds Mackenzie, "the original
party animal." This is the one
where bikini-clad babes are lus
ting after an ugly pit bull wearing
a tuxedo.
What can I say about "Head
for the mountains, head for
Busch beer?" The last time I saw
people head for the mountains
was during "War of the
Worlds," and they were only
heading there to avoid being
eaten by Martians.
So I would like to advocate a
new truth-in-beer-advertising
policy. Let 'em say whatever
they want. Here's my first com
mercial; notice how it gets right
to the heart of a beer drinker's
cares:
Spokesman, on floor "Ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha . . .
I'm so drunk I can't even stand
up ... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha."
Voiceover: "Lowbrau, the beer
that gets you drunk."
Gotta run, I've got a final in
my Stroh's class in 20 minutes

ally drink it.
Anyway, because of this
holier-than-thou rule, Madision
Avenue has had to come up with
new and sexy ways to show
buddies having a great time
holding beer:
It's been a long, hot day in the
sun. Your wife left you for a Pen
tecostal minister; construction
workers dropped a small crane
onto your BMW. It's time to stop

into a bar, sit down next to a
washed up sports figure and hold
onto an ice cold beer.
Also, people are shown drink
ing — or holding, as the case may
be — beer at all kinds of social
functions where, in real life, pop
ping open a beer would be about
as socially acceptable as picking
your nose. Dinner at the White
House? Pop open a tall one. Just
given a terrific sermon? Hold
onto a cool one. Ready to finally
perform that refreshing 10-hour
brain surgery? It's Miller time.
Of course, because these ac
tors don't have anything to do
while they're holding their beers,
a great deal of discussion goes on
about the contents and appear
ance of the beer. I know that
every time I open a beer I pause
to tell my friends how glad I am
that it is made of the finest
quality malt, barley, hops and
cold Rocky Mountain spring
water.
But if it's pure stupidity you
want, look no further than the
nifty slogans the advertisers
devise for their beers:
After years of being "fire

brewed" — a process which, as
far as 1 can tell, involves bar
becuing a can of beer over hick
ory smoke — Stroh's has come
up with "Stroh's is spoken
here." Send now for your
Stroh's-English/English-Stroh's
dictionary. A guttural, slurred
language, Stroh's is also offered
through Stanford's Department
of Linguistics.
Miller has devised a campaign
to reflect the pride America has
in its products: "Miller's made
the American way." That's good
to know. Just as reliable as an
American car, huh? Frankly, I
think I'd rather stick to one of
those sporty German-engineered
beers.
Or "Hamm's, the beer refresh
ing." As far as I can tell, this sen
tence is not even correct English.
Maybe it's a dialect of Stroh's?
Anyway, Hamm's doesn't even
show people holding beer, but
rather a cartoon bear and a car
toon rabbit holding beer. How
about "Hamm's, the beer unfit
for humans?"
Mark Harmon allows that
"Coors is the one." The one

what?
One of the most repulsive ad
campaigns is for Bud Light, with
Spuds Mackenzie, "the original
party animal." This is the one
where bikini-clad babes are lus
ting after an ugly pit bull wearing
a tuxedo.
What can I say about "Head
for the mountains, head for
Busch beer?" The last time I saw
people head for the mountains
was during "War of the
Worlds," and they were only
heading there to avoid being
eaten by Martians.
So I would like to advocate a
new truth-in-beer-advertising
policy. Let 'em say whatever
they want. Here's my first com
mercial; notice how it gets right
to the heart of a beer drinker's
cares:
Spokesman, on floor "Ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha . . .
I'm so drunk I can't even stand
up ... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha."
Voiceover: "Lowbrau, the beer
that gets you drunk."
Gotta run, I've got a final in
my Stroh's class in 20 minutes

Advertisements for beer are
among the most stupid things on
television. I say "among," of
course, because I want to leave
room for the presidential debates
and "Alf." Come to think of it. I
want to leave room in the presi
dential debates for Alf.
Selling beer on television isn't
the easiest thing to do, primarily
because advertisers aren't
allowed to show actors actually
drinking the stuff. I guess the
rationale here is that it's more
moralistic to only advocate the
selling of beer and not the drink
ing of it. God forbid that a guy
who buys a six-pack should actu
ally drink it.
