# Cranston at conference: Arms treaty needs quick OK
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Chances for further reductions
in nuclear arms will be "dashed"
if the Senate does not quickly
ratify the Intermediate-range Nu
clear Forces (INF) Treaty without
amending it. Sen. Alan Cranston
(D-Calif.) said Sunday at a Stan
ford arms control conference.
The treaty was signed yester
day by President Reagan and So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
and now awaits Senate ratifica
tion by a two-thirds majority.
The three-day conference at
tracted over 1000 people to each
of its four addresses and four
panel discussions, organizers said..
Among the conference's speakers
were Cranston, former National
Security Adviser McGeorge
Bundy, Deputy Secretary of State
John Whitehead and former spe
cial envoy to the Middle East
Philip Habib.
The treaty's reduction of inter
mediate nuclear weapons is prob
ably supported by a majority of
the Senate, Cranston said, but

many senators will seek to amend
the treaty because they believe it
leaves NATO forces in a weaker
position relative to those of the
Warsaw Paet.
"The key fight is against devas
tating amendments," said Cran
ston, who is the Senate majority
whip. "We need 67 votes for the
treaty and 51 votes against
amendments."
Conservative senators, led by
Senate Minority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.), have said they
may add restrictive amendments
to Reagan's INF treaty, which
eliminates all ground-launched
nuclear missiles with a range be
tween 300 and 3000 miles
"If Reagan, a conservative,
cannot get a modest treaty
through the Senate, then who
can?" Cranston said.
Cranston spoke to an audience
in Memorial Auditorium on the
final day of the forum, which was
sponsored by Stanford's Center
for International Security and
Arms Control.

Sen. Alan Cranston (IM'alif.), speaking Sunday in Memorial Auditorium at an arms con
trol conference here, discusses the need for an expedient ratification of the Intermediate
range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
A Stanford alumnus, Cranston
was one of four speakers in a
panel discussion on "Building a
Policy Consensus for the Future,"
which was chaired by Coit
Blacker, acting co-director of the
Arms Control Center. Cranston
was joined by Bundy, Sen.
Timothy Wirth (D-Colo.) and
Strobe Talbott, Time Washington
Bureau Chief.
Wirth, a first-term senator on
the Armed Services Committee
with a doctorate in education
from Stanford, echoed Cranston's
plea for quick ratification.
"Critics of the treaty say it will
put NATO's conventional forces
at a numerical disadvantage

compared with the Warsaw
Pact," Wirth said, "but 'bean
counting' misses the qualitative
advantages of NATO."
Talbott said that inordinately
high security standards have kept
the Reagan administration from
obtaining a policy consensus for
arms control. "The quest for the
best is the enemy of the achieve
ment of the good in this country,"
Talbott said. "We have a 'feast or
famine' attitude toward arms con
trol."
Bundy, now a history professor
at New York University, said that
policy consensus depends on pos
itive action by the executive
branch. "The president must re
member his predecessors, use the
members of the National Security
Council and consult with the Joint
Chiefs of Staff in concert with his
cabinet," Bundy said.
