# Cranston at conference: Arms treaty needs quick OK
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Chances for further reductions
in nuclear arms will be "dashed"
if the Senate does not quickly
ratify the Intermediate-range Nu
clear Forces (INF) Treaty without
amending it. Sen. Alan Cranston
(D-Calif.) said Sunday at a Stan
ford arms control conference.
The treaty was signed yester
day by President Reagan and So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
and now awaits Senate ratifica
tion by a two-thirds majority.
The three-day conference at
tracted over 1000 people to each
of its four addresses and four
panel discussions, organizers said..
Among the conference's speakers
were Cranston, former National
Security Adviser McGeorge
Bundy, Deputy Secretary of State
John Whitehead and former spe
cial envoy to the Middle East
Philip Habib.
The treaty's reduction of inter
mediate nuclear weapons is prob
ably supported by a majority of
the Senate, Cranston said, but

many senators will seek to amend
the treaty because they believe it
leaves NATO forces in a weaker
position relative to those of the
Warsaw Paet.
"The key fight is against devas
tating amendments," said Cran
ston, who is the Senate majority
whip. "We need 67 votes for the
treaty and 51 votes against
amendments."
Conservative senators, led by
Senate Minority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.), have said they
may add restrictive amendments
to Reagan's INF treaty, which
eliminates all ground-launched
nuclear missiles with a range be
tween 300 and 3000 miles
"If Reagan, a conservative,
cannot get a modest treaty
through the Senate, then who
can?" Cranston said.
Cranston spoke to an audience
in Memorial Auditorium on the
final day of the forum, which was
sponsored by Stanford's Center
for International Security and
Arms Control.
