# Hard rock to excess with INXS
## 
### Sid Heaton 
So, you've been feeling a little
down lately. You haven't read
anything since midterms, you're
out of beer, and Todd Lichti
missed a free throw. You've tried
peyote; you've tried clam dip;
you even clipped your toenails;
but nothing seems to cheer you
up. Well, take heart, because just
in time for Dead Week, "Kick,"
the new album from INXS, is
here.
I was leery of this album for
two very good reasons. For one
thing, the group looks far too hip
on the cover, especially with the
goofy painted skateboard
looming over their heads like
some sort of psychedelic tuna
fish.
Secondly, there is a song on the
album entitled "Calling All Na
tions," which gave me no small
amount of disquietude. I was im
mediately inundated with images
of INXS as strange bedfellows of
Bono and the boys, jumping on
the "Everybody just say 4 No' "

bandwagon and trumpeting their
collective social conscience to the
world.
All worries were pleasantly dis
pelled, however, when I listened
to the song and was treated to the
line, "Take the chains off your
feet and do the sex dance, 'cuz it's
necessary." We may be the world,
we may be the children, but hey,
that doesn't mean we can't have
any fun.
If INXS is anything, it is a
slickly textured pop-dance band
with some tendencies toward a
more crunching but not-quite
metal sound. "Kick" finds these
six boys from Australia in an ex
perimental mood. Not only have
they found the drum machine
(they always had the synthesizer),
but they've also stumbled upon
funk.
Gone are the ethereal synth
based harmonies of 1984's "The
Swing;" they've been replaced by
the funkier sensibilities of
producer Chris Thomas. Most of
the time the new formula works,
but there are two noticeable in

stances where it fails miserably.
The first is the opening cut,
"Guns in the Sky," which sounds
like it was made for the sole pur
pose of giving young, destitute
rap musicians something to rap
about. It opens with an auditory

If INXS is anything,
they are a slickly
textured pop-dance
band with some ten
dencies toward a more
crunching but not
quite-metal sound.

assault by a bass-drum machine,
and then is accompanied by what
would seem to be the sounds of
Michael Hutchence vomiting
violently and repeatedly.
The other nightmare is "The
Loved One," which sets what
must be some sort of record for

most cliches used in one chorus;
"Oh baby, I love you so ... I
need you now ... I want you back
. . . I can't go on." Interestingly
enough, this is the one song on
the album that was not written by
INXS, but rather by the songwrit
ing trio of Lovett, Humphries and
Clyne. No, I did not make those
names up.
The rest of the album makes up
for these two miscues. There is a
uniform danceability to the music
of INXS, characterized by the
high-register, staccato guitar runs
of Timothy Farriss, the quirkily
sexy saxophone of Kirk Pengilly
and the precision drumming of
Jon Farriss.
Songs such as "Devil Inside"
and the current radio single,
"Need You Tonight," are quick
and easy antidotes for stress
during finals. Also, one nice thing
to know is that in the song,
"Mediate," Michael Hutchence
finds no fewer than 52 rhymes for
the word "hallucinate" without
once having to resort to profanity.
Now that's amazing.

any fun.
If INXS is anything, it is a
slickly textured pop-dance band
with some tendencies toward a
more crunching but not-quite
metal sound. "Kick" finds these
six boys from Australia in an ex
perimental mood. Not only have
they found the drum machine
(they always had the synthesizer),
but they've also stumbled upon
funk.
Gone are the ethereal synth
based harmonies of 1984's "The
Swing;" they've been replaced by
the funkier sensibilities of
producer Chris Thomas. Most of
the time the new formula works,
but there are two noticeable in

stances where it fails miserably.
The first is the opening cut,
"Guns in the Sky," which sounds
like it was made for the sole pur
pose of giving young, destitute
rap musicians something to rap
about. It opens with an auditory

assault by a bass-drum machine,
and then is accompanied by what
would seem to be the sounds of
Michael Hutchence vomiting
violently and repeatedly.
The other nightmare is "The
Loved One," which sets what
must be some sort of record for

most cliches used in one chorus;
"Oh baby, I love you so ... I
need you now ... I want you back
. . . I can't go on." Interestingly
enough, this is the one song on
the album that was not written by
INXS, but rather by the songwrit
ing trio of Lovett, Humphries and
Clyne. No, I did not make those
names up.
The rest of the album makes up
for these two miscues. There is a
uniform danceability to the music
of INXS, characterized by the
high-register, staccato guitar runs
of Timothy Farriss, the quirkily
sexy saxophone of Kirk Pengilly
and the precision drumming of
Jon Farriss.
Songs such as "Devil Inside"
and the current radio single,
"Need You Tonight," are quick
and easy antidotes for stress
during finals. Also, one nice thing
to know is that in the song,
"Mediate," Michael Hutchence
finds no fewer than 52 rhymes for
the word "hallucinate" without
once having to resort to profanity.
Now that's amazing.
