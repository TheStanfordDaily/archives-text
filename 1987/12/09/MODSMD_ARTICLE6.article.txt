# JFK adviser calls summit
## 
### Bobby Schrader Senior staff writer 
Pointing to a new spirit of cooperation between
the two superpowers, former National Security Ad
viser McGeorge Bundy Friday called this week's
Reagan-Gorbachev summit a "critical meeting"
that might achieve lasting agreements in interna
tional security.
In a guardedly optimistic speech opening a three
day arms control conference here, Bundy outlined
the painful history of Soviet-American relations —
a history haunted by the past failures of Yalta in
1945, after which Europe was divided, and the 1961
Vienna summit, after which the Berlin Wall was
erected.
Bundy served as national security adviser under
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.
Despite the disappointments of the past, Bundy
praised the bold new arms control initiatives under
taken by Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, calling
the Soviet leaders understanding of nuclear weap-
ons "profound, correct and
clear."
Bundy called Gorbachev's rise
"the largest single change in su
perpower relations. . . and if his
evident political skill is accompa
nied by only moderate good
fortune, " the Gorbachev years
offer "the most important oppor
tunity in the nuclear age for a new
level of stability, safety and hope
in the necessary coexistence of
the two great nuclear powers."
According to Bundy, the un
precedented simultaneous "exist
ence in both countries of a new
level of understanding" offers the
most substantial hope for a lasting
stable international system.
Bundy said that both sides rec
ognize the necessity of placing
emphasis on the "health and
strength" of their own societies as
well as on the need to stop
playing "the role of the world's
busybody."
Most important, however, is
the recognition that "we do share
not only a common interest but
also a common responsibility for
the avoidance of a nuclear war,"
Bundy said.
Bundy tempered his optimism
over the prospects for successful
long-term security arrangements
by raising the problems of strate
gic doctrine that stand in the way
of stability.
"There is much unfinished
business in the way we think
about what we would ever use
these things (nuclear weapons)
for if someone else used them
first," Bundy said.
"There is a kind of command
and control that is not written in
arms control," he said.
