Shots likely did not cause crash
LOS ANGELES — Aviation experts suggested yesterday that
it was unlikely a gunman could have caused the crash of PSA
flight 1771 unless he shot "two critical components" — the
pilots.
Emphasizing that they could speak only in the most hypotheti
cal terms, these specialists said that simply firing bullets into an
airplane's fuselage will not make it crash. Airliners are generally
built with enough engineering redundancy to continue to fly even
if an engine or another sensitive system is crippled by a bullet
after it tears through the plane's body, they noted.
"If you were going to deliberately come up with something
that would withstand a small explosion, you'd make it look a lot
like an airplane," said Richard Wood, a private aircraft accident
investigator and director of the Aviation Safety Program at USC.
"I've been thinking all day long about it and I can't hypothe
size any point on the plane you could hit and guarantee a cata
strophic result," he said. "Not to say it couldn't happen from
some phenomenal combination of circumstances."
As evidence, Wood cited an April 1986 incident in which a
small bomb ripped out a section of a TWA jet. While the blast
blew a gaping hole in the plane's side — through which four pas
sengers fell to their death — the plane landed safely.
"You can hypothesize all kinds of weird things — perhaps a
bullet went through the fuselage and into a wing fuel tank and
ignited a fire — or you can pick an obvious one, in which the
plane goes down because you shoot two critical components —
the pilots," Wood said. "I would tend to go with the (disabling of
the) pilot."
Roger Stuart, a PSA pilot and pilot trainer who flies the same
type of British Aerospace plane, agreed.
"I can see where a bullet would cause a malfunction that would
create an abnormal situation, but not to the point where it would
completely disable an aircraft unless it was an explosion,'' he
said.
Stocks up 100 points in two days
NEW YORK — An explosion of trading in the session's last
half-hour sent stocks sharply higher yesterday, leaving the Dow
Jones industrial average at a closing 1868.37, up 56.20 points.
The last-minute burst, driven partly by computer-tied program
trading, carried the Dow to a two-day gain of 101.63 points. The
runup brought a measure of relief to traders after last week's
143.44-point slide, which had left many broad market indexes
below where they stood after Black Monday.
"The market seemed quite strong and in the last half-hour
really turned on the afterburners," said Chester Pado, executive
vice president and chief technical analyst with Jefferies & Co. in
Los Angeles. The closing activity followed hours of sluggish
trading, during which the Dow slipped as low as 20 points below
Monday's close, then edged up and hovered for several hours just
above Monday's closing figure.
Despite the encouragement offered by the eleventh-hour rally,
analysts noted that much of the day's volume came in activity in
two stocks, Pacific Gas & Electric and McDermott International,
that have been traded for their large dividends. The stocks were
the most heavily traded on the New York Stock Exchange; 47.1
million shares of Pacific Gas changed hands, along with 15.2 mil
lion shares of McDermott.
Kennedy gets ABA's highest rating
WASHINGTON — Supreme Court nominee Anthony Ken
nedy yesterday received the highest rating of an American Bar
Association judicial review panel, the Department of Justice an
nounced, further bolstering his prospects for Senate confirma
tion.
The unanimous rating of "well qualified" given Kennedy by
the ABA's standing committee on the federal judiciary con
trasted with the 10-4-1 vote by which the committee split in
giving previous nominee Robert Bork the same rating. Bork,
President Reagan's first choice for the Supreme Court vacancy,
was rejected by the Senate by a 58-42 vote.
"Obviously, this is good news," said Terry Eastland, the De
partment of Justice's chief spokesman. "Certainly Judge Ken
nedy deserved it, and it is one more reason he should be swiftly
confirmed." The Senate Judiciary Committee will begin its
hearings on the nomination Monday.
According to ABA standards, the "well-qualified" rating goes
to candidates "who meet the highest standards of professional
competence, judicial temperament and integrity. The persons in
this category must be among the best available for appointment
to the Supreme Court."
In evaluating a nominee, the ABA panel's 15 members inter
view federal and state judges, practicing lawyers, law professors
and deans, law clerks and lawyers representing indigents and
minorities and other groups.
Separate teams of law professors and lawyers study the
nominee's legal opinions. In the case of Kennedy, who has writ
ten more than 400 opinions in his 12 years on the U.S. 9th Cir
cuit Court of Appeals, three law schools rather than one partici
pated in reviewing his writings because of the volume and the
desire for speed, an ABA spokesman said.
In Bork's nomination, four members of the committee found
him "not qualified" and one voted "not opposed."
Reagan's second choice for the post, Judge Douglas Ginsburg,
withdrew before the ABA had completed its review.
When Kennedy was nominated by President Ford for the 9th
Circuit in 1975, he received the next-to-highest ranking on a
four-level scale for the appellate court. A source familiar with the
ABA panel's deliberations noted that Kennedy has gained 12
years of judicial experience since his first rating.
Berlin Wall guards stop shooting
BERLIN — East Germany has ordered its guards at the Berlin
Wall and the West German border to stop shooting civilians
trying to flee to the West, West German officials and western
diplomats say.
Several former East German frontier guards, who have crossed
the heavily fortified border illegally to live in the West, have said
that their superiors told them in recent months to use firearms
only in self-defense, or if a soldier or policeman is trying to flee,
according to the western officials.
In addition. East Germany's chief of state, Erich Honecker, in
directly confirmed the reports at a meeting here with U.S. Dep
uty Secretary of State John Whitehead Nov. 11.
The shift in policy, if it continues, would remove one of the
most bitter irritants in East Germany's relations with the West.
More than 175 people have been shot and killed at the Berlin
Wall and the border between the two Germanys since the wall
was erected in August 1961 to halt a surge of emigrants to the
West.
Honecker, who presided over the wall's construction, is
believed to have changed the policy to "reward" the Bonn gov
ernment for welcoming him in September on the first visit to
West Germany by an East German leader.

Berlin Wall guards stop shooting
BERLIN — East Germany has ordered its guards at the Berlin
Wall and the West German border to stop shooting civilians
trying to flee to the West, West German officials and western
diplomats say.
Several former East German frontier guards, who have crossed
the heavily fortified border illegally to live in the West, have said
that their superiors told them in recent months to use firearms
only in self-defense, or if a soldier or policeman is trying to flee,
according to the western officials.
In addition. East Germany's chief of state, Erich Honecker, in
directly confirmed the reports at a meeting here with U.S. Dep
uty Secretary of State John Whitehead Nov. 11.
The shift in policy, if it continues, would remove one of the
most bitter irritants in East Germany's relations with the West.
More than 175 people have been shot and killed at the Berlin
Wall and the border between the two Germanys since the wall
was erected in August 1961 to halt a surge of emigrants to the
West.
Honecker, who presided over the wall's construction, is
believed to have changed the policy to "reward" the Bonn gov
ernment for welcoming him in September on the first visit to
West Germany by an East German leader.

Shots likely did not cause crash
LOS ANGELES — Aviation experts suggested yesterday that
it was unlikely a gunman could have caused the crash of PSA
flight 1771 unless he shot "two critical components" — the
pilots.
Emphasizing that they could speak only in the most hypotheti
cal terms, these specialists said that simply firing bullets into an
airplane's fuselage will not make it crash. Airliners are generally
built with enough engineering redundancy to continue to fly even
if an engine or another sensitive system is crippled by a bullet
after it tears through the plane's body, they noted.
"If you were going to deliberately come up with something
that would withstand a small explosion, you'd make it look a lot
like an airplane," said Richard Wood, a private aircraft accident
investigator and director of the Aviation Safety Program at USC.
"I've been thinking all day long about it and I can't hypothe
size any point on the plane you could hit and guarantee a cata
strophic result," he said. "Not to say it couldn't happen from
some phenomenal combination of circumstances."
As evidence, Wood cited an April 1986 incident in which a
small bomb ripped out a section of a TWA jet. While the blast
blew a gaping hole in the plane's side — through which four pas
sengers fell to their death — the plane landed safely.
"You can hypothesize all kinds of weird things — perhaps a
bullet went through the fuselage and into a wing fuel tank and
ignited a fire — or you can pick an obvious one, in which the
plane goes down because you shoot two critical components —
the pilots," Wood said. "I would tend to go with the (disabling of
the) pilot."
Roger Stuart, a PSA pilot and pilot trainer who flies the same
type of British Aerospace plane, agreed.
"I can see where a bullet would cause a malfunction that would
create an abnormal situation, but not to the point where it would
completely disable an aircraft unless it was an explosion,'' he
said.
Stocks up 100 points in two days
NEW YORK — An explosion of trading in the session's last
half-hour sent stocks sharply higher yesterday, leaving the Dow
Jones industrial average at a closing 1868.37, up 56.20 points.
The last-minute burst, driven partly by computer-tied program
trading, carried the Dow to a two-day gain of 101.63 points. The
runup brought a measure of relief to traders after last week's
143.44-point slide, which had left many broad market indexes
below where they stood after Black Monday.
"The market seemed quite strong and in the last half-hour
really turned on the afterburners," said Chester Pado, executive
vice president and chief technical analyst with Jefferies & Co. in
Los Angeles. The closing activity followed hours of sluggish
trading, during which the Dow slipped as low as 20 points below
Monday's close, then edged up and hovered for several hours just
above Monday's closing figure.
Despite the encouragement offered by the eleventh-hour rally,
analysts noted that much of the day's volume came in activity in
two stocks, Pacific Gas & Electric and McDermott International,
that have been traded for their large dividends. The stocks were
the most heavily traded on the New York Stock Exchange; 47.1
million shares of Pacific Gas changed hands, along with 15.2 mil
lion shares of McDermott.
Kennedy gets ABA's highest rating
WASHINGTON — Supreme Court nominee Anthony Ken
nedy yesterday received the highest rating of an American Bar
Association judicial review panel, the Department of Justice an
nounced, further bolstering his prospects for Senate confirma
tion.
The unanimous rating of "well qualified" given Kennedy by
the ABA's standing committee on the federal judiciary con
trasted with the 10-4-1 vote by which the committee split in
giving previous nominee Robert Bork the same rating. Bork,
President Reagan's first choice for the Supreme Court vacancy,
was rejected by the Senate by a 58-42 vote.
"Obviously, this is good news," said Terry Eastland, the De
partment of Justice's chief spokesman. "Certainly Judge Ken
nedy deserved it, and it is one more reason he should be swiftly
confirmed." The Senate Judiciary Committee will begin its
hearings on the nomination Monday.
According to ABA standards, the "well-qualified" rating goes
to candidates "who meet the highest standards of professional
competence, judicial temperament and integrity. The persons in
this category must be among the best available for appointment
to the Supreme Court."
In evaluating a nominee, the ABA panel's 15 members inter
view federal and state judges, practicing lawyers, law professors
and deans, law clerks and lawyers representing indigents and
minorities and other groups.
Separate teams of law professors and lawyers study the
nominee's legal opinions. In the case of Kennedy, who has writ
ten more than 400 opinions in his 12 years on the U.S. 9th Cir
cuit Court of Appeals, three law schools rather than one partici
pated in reviewing his writings because of the volume and the
desire for speed, an ABA spokesman said.
In Bork's nomination, four members of the committee found
him "not qualified" and one voted "not opposed."
Reagan's second choice for the post, Judge Douglas Ginsburg,
withdrew before the ABA had completed its review.
When Kennedy was nominated by President Ford for the 9th
Circuit in 1975, he received the next-to-highest ranking on a
four-level scale for the appellate court. A source familiar with the
