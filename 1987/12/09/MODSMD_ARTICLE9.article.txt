# Reagan, Gorbachev meet in Washington
## Leaders sign arms agreement 
### 
WASHINGTON — With a brisk exchange
of pens and handshakes. President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed
an historic treaty at the White House yester
day eliminating an entire class of nuclear
armed missiles and vowed to make progress
toward another treaty that would slash the
strategic nuclear arsenals of the rival super
powers.
In an East Room ceremony that was solemn
and celebratory, the two leaders sat side by
side at a table once used by President Abra
ham Lincoln and put their signatures to the
accord to do away with medium- and shorter
range nuclear-tipped missiles.
"We can only hope that this history-making
agreement will not be an end in itself, but the
beginning of a working relationship that will
enable us to tackle the other . . . urgent issues
before us," Reagan said, before signing the
first major treaty of his presidency.
He said these issues include "strategic of
fensive nuclear weapons, the balance of con
ventional forces in Europe, the destructive
and tragic regional conflicts that beset so
many parts of our globe, and respect tor the
human and natural rights that God has
granted to all men."
Gorbachev, responding, said "we can be
proud of planting this sapling which may one

day grow into a mighty tree of peace."
"May Dec. 8, 1987, become a date that will
be inscribed in the history books — a date that
will mark the watershed separating the era of
a mounting risk of nuclear war from the era of
a demilitarization of human life," Gorbachev
said.
Scores of seated officials, dignitaries and
guests of the two leaders looked on as they
carefully inscribed their names eight times in
two large copies of the treaties, one bound in
slate-blue leather for the United States, the
other in burgundy-red leather for the Soviet
Union. Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev
sat beside each other as their husbands signed.
After signing the Intermediate-Range Nu
clear Forces (INF) Treaty, the two leaders
walked together to the State Dining Room
and made separate televised statements for a
worldwide audience.
Then, they held the second of the summit's
substantive meetings, which focused on strate
gic arms and other arms reduction issues.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said the signing ceremony had given "a boost
to the hope for progress" in these areas but
added that a "sense of political realism" soon
entered the picture.
In all, Reagan and Gorbachev spent almost

three hours in official talks yesterday, begin
ning with a one-on-one morning discussion in
the Oval Office and an afternoon plenary ses
sion in the Cabinet Room attended by senior
advisers. Fitzwater later characterized the
summit talks as "a day of positive, productive
discussions."
Following a familiar summit format, task
forces on arms reduction issues and on other
issues of the broad U.S.-Soviet agenda were
established, and these groups of senior offi
cials met yesterday afternoon and in some
cases last night. No results of these meetings
were made public.
By the end of the day, Fitzwater said, "both
sides felt that a foundation had been laid for
substantive progress on specific issues." He
gave no details.
A White House official who briefed
reporters later on condition he not be identi
fied said Gorbachev offered "no surprises or
new proposals." The official said Reagan had
opened the day's talks by raising questions of
Jewish emigration and divided spouses, and
that Gorbachev countered by saying the
Soviets were seeking to improve in these
areas, and also raised questions about U.S.
human rights practices.
