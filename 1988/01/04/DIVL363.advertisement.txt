HOW
THIS RAKE
CAN SAVE
YOUR LIFE.
This simple garden tool is
a firefighter. It can help you clear
awav brush and leaves that act
like kindling around your home.
And you.
So if you live near the forest,
do a little raking. And that's not
all. Landscape your home with a
tire retardant plant like ivy. Use
spark arrester screens on your
chimnev and vents. And put fire
retardant material on your root
and underneath vour house
where it is exposed.
Because a torest fire hums
more than trees.
