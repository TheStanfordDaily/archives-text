# University closes Roble Hall
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Roble Hall runs an
"unacceptably high risk" of col
lapsing during a major earth
quake and must be evacuated.
University officials decided Dec.
16.
All 294 students in the four
class dormitory are being relo
cated this week to spaces in other
houses on campus, putting an un
precedented burden on the Uni
versity housing system.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons announced the decision to
approximately 100 students who
remained in Roble Dec. 18, the
last day of fall quarter exams. The
rest were notified by mail over
the two-week winter break.
Roble, Stanford's oldest dor
mitory, was found by an outside
engineering firm to be at a far
greater earthquake risk than any
other student dormitory. The
firm's preliminary report,
delivered as a two-page written
summary to University Facilities
officials Dec. 1 1, said Roble's
outer walls arc constructed of
hollow clay tile rather than what
was believed to be reinforced
concrete.
Forwarded to a regular meeting
of the University Administrative
Council five days later, the report
was considered reason enough by
the council to close the building
for at least a year, according to
council member Lyons. Others on
the council include University
President Donald Kennedy.
Provost James Rosse and five vice
presidents.
In a Dec. 17 letter — the first
of two during winter break to
Roble residents — Lyons said the
"brittle" tile would not withstand

"certain kinds of seismic activity"
and therefore could not provide
"the vertical and horizontal
bracing that reinforced concrete
walls would have provided."
According to Lyons, the floors
of the building are heavy concrete
and receive little support from the
walls. Until this fall, Roble's walls
were also assumed to be rein
forced concrete, although no
structural plans existed verifying
that assumption. According to
Lyons' letter, all other student
residences have been proven to to
be made of wood frame, steel
frame or reinforced concrete, and
thus arc resistant to seismic activ
ity.
The ultimate fate of the dor
mitory, built in 1918 and long
coveted by students in the annual
housing draw, remains unknown,
Lyons said last night. "We have
several choices on how to make it
seismically OK," he said. "But
the question is can it be economi
cally feasible?"
"All of us would like to keep
Roble, but I can see building a
new residence with the same re
sources."
Keith Guy, director of Housing
and Food Service, said yesterday
he had heard a "rough guess" of
the cost of renovating Roble to be
"one-fourth to one-third the cost
of a new building." Guy predicted
a decision would be made on
Roble's future by mid-January.
Guy said other decisions about
future housing policy — including
the fate of the returning resident
priority — would be made
available to students sometime in
February or March, before the
Draw.

terior finish might betray a wall
made of something other than
reinforced concrete first emerged
in testing done by the University's
Blume Earthquake Center last
spring as part of a general seismic
study of Stanford buildings, ac
cording to John Hughes, associate
provost in the Office of Planning
and Management.
Jonathan Ryan, facilities proj
ect manager, then commissioned
the San Francisco engineering
firm Rutherford and Chekene,
which has worked on seismic
reinforcement for the University
— including the renovation of
History Corner — to conduct
tests of Roble's walls.
Roble had been determined to
be seismically safe in earlier in
spections done by the University,
but never before had the material
of the walls been physically
tested.
The Rutherford and Chekene
found walls in Roble that con
tained clay tile, but was unable to
confirm that the building was
unsafe without an "as-built" plan,
which is a blueprint that describes
a building after it is constructed
and is updated as the building is
modified.
But Roble's as-built plans have
been lost and there is little other
documentation of its structural
layout, Ryan said. He added that
this is a common trait among pre-
World War II buildings.
Engineers spent last summer
painstakingly working toward
creating as-built plans of the
building, measuring rooms and
testing the building's composi
tion, Ryan said. Rutherford and
Chekene are now finalizing the
plans in preparation for the deci
sion whether to reinforce the
building.
But it took the discovery in late
November of a photograph that
was buried in Old Pavilion ar
chives to force officials to act.
Dew Le, a structural engineering
student from Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo working for Ryan, found
a photo taken while Roble's walls
were being built that clearly
shows the precarious hollow clay
tiles in the walls.
After Ryan was given the
photo, he asked Rutherford and
Chekene to assess the situation
for the University, and their sum
mary was delivered Dec. 11.
"Without the photograph we
would've come to the same deci

sion," said Ryan, "but it would've
taken us longer. We would've
dropped the bomb sometime
after Christmas."
Ryan stressed that the seismic
study of Roble is "not testing in
the strict sense of the word" be
cause "there are no legal stan
dards" to define the risk of the
building. The first California
earthquake structural regulation,
the Reilly Act, was passed in
1933 after a quake devastated
Long Beach in Southern Califor
nia. Since then, regulations have
been modernized several times,
but none of them apply
retroactively to older buildings.
"Risk management techniques
are only on a relative scale,"
Ryan said. " Do we assess risk dif
ferently based on the number of
occupants of the building? The
answer is yes."
According to Ryan, Stanford
has in the last year begun to use a
"somewhat objective standard"
established by a Los Angeles or
dinance, "Division 88," and the
University currently upgrades
buildings to a level of "acceptable
life safety."
There is some concern among
officials about the length of time
it took Rutherford and Chekene
to conduct the study. Asked
whether the survey could have
been completed more quickly
over the summer, thus avoiding
the displacement of students in
the fall, Hughes said, "That's a
very good question. I've asked for
a sequence of events and will get
it tomorrow."
Tom Fenner, associate staff
counsel, downplayed any poten
tial legal problems for the Uni
versity in the wake of the Roble
closure. "It has taken a good
amount of time to evaluate the
(structural) risk. I can't evaluate
whether the University should
have completed it earlier."
Responding to speculation that
the University might be legally
liable for violating the terms of its
housing contract with Roble resi
dents, Fenner said, "My under
standing is that the contract pro
vides a student a space rather
than a particular space with a par
ticular condition. Besides, the
Housing Office is bending over
backwards to be liberal about the
contract right now."
Although University officials
and Roble Resident Fellows Ann
and Evan Porteus tried to keep
the Wednesday decision secret
until after final exams were com
pleted on Friday, news of the
building's closure leaked to resi
dent? Miimgy night."
