# University closes Roble Hall
## 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Roble Hall runs an
"unacceptably high risk" of col
lapsing during a major earth
quake and must be evacuated.
University officials decided Dec.
16.
All 294 students in the four
class dormitory are being relo
cated this week to spaces in other
houses on campus, putting an un
precedented burden on the Uni
versity housing system.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons announced the decision to
approximately 100 students who
remained in Roble Dec. 18, the
last day of fall quarter exams. The
rest were notified by mail over
the two-week winter break.
Roble, Stanford's oldest dor
mitory, was found by an outside
engineering firm to be at a far
greater earthquake risk than any
other student dormitory. The
firm's preliminary report,
delivered as a two-page written
summary to University Facilities
officials Dec. 1 1, said Roble's
outer walls arc constructed of
hollow clay tile rather than what
was believed to be reinforced
concrete.
Forwarded to a regular meeting
of the University Administrative
Council five days later, the report
was considered reason enough by
the council to close the building
for at least a year, according to
council member Lyons. Others on
the council include University
President Donald Kennedy.
Provost James Rosse and five vice
presidents.
In a Dec. 17 letter — the first
of two during winter break to
Roble residents — Lyons said the
"brittle" tile would not withstand

"certain kinds of seismic activity"
and therefore could not provide
"the vertical and horizontal
bracing that reinforced concrete
walls would have provided."
According to Lyons, the floors
of the building are heavy concrete
and receive little support from the
walls. Until this fall, Roble's walls
were also assumed to be rein
forced concrete, although no
structural plans existed verifying
that assumption. According to
Lyons' letter, all other student
residences have been proven to to
be made of wood frame, steel
frame or reinforced concrete, and
thus arc resistant to seismic activ
ity.
The ultimate fate of the dor
mitory, built in 1918 and long
coveted by students in the annual
housing draw, remains unknown,
Lyons said last night. "We have
several choices on how to make it
seismically OK," he said. "But
the question is can it be economi
cally feasible?"
"All of us would like to keep
Roble, but I can see building a
new residence with the same re
sources."
Keith Guy, director of Housing
and Food Service, said yesterday
he had heard a "rough guess" of
the cost of renovating Roble to be
"one-fourth to one-third the cost
of a new building." Guy predicted
a decision would be made on
Roble's future by mid-January.
Guy said other decisions about
future housing policy — including
the fate of the returning resident
priority — would be made
available to students sometime in
February or March, before the
Draw.
