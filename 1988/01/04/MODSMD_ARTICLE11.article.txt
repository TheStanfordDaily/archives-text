## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Housing horror 
### 
The University has displayed admirable skill
and efficiency in relocating the displaced resi
dents of Roble Hall. We hope that it will now be
able to muster the same resolve in addressing the
much larger problem of student housing.
The current crisis only exacerbates an already
woeful shortage of student residence space. Sim
ply put, student housing at Stanford is inade
quate.
Stanford is not an urban campus, and the dis
tance that separates it from the surrounding com
munity makes off-campus housing extremely im
practical, especially for students without cars.
Palo Alto's notoriously high rents further compl
icate the task of finding affordable housing.
The obvious and much-needed solution is to
build more on-campus housing — immediately.
The University claims to share student concern
about housing, but its timetable for new housing
construction is glacial.
The Roble situation highlights the dire need
for immediate action. How long will displaced
Roble residents be living in converted study
rooms and lounges? If the longevity of Manzanita
Park — the "temporary" trailer complex built in
the early 1970s — is any indication, it might turn
out to be quite a while.
Stanford has both the land and the money to
build new residences, and it must not delay in
doing so. The University should take steps to
develop a long-term plan for expanded student
housing.
This plan could use as a model the bold, vision
ary philosophy Stanford has adopted for the new
Near West Campus science complex; Identify the
need, and build the buildings to address it.
Indeed, it seems ironic that the University
proposes to build a state-of-the-art science com
plex without having provided adequate living
facilities for the students who will use it.
Granted, the construction of new residences is
an ambitious undertaking. But it will not be

prohibitively complex or costly. Here are a few
ways the University might facilitate the process:
In order to save time, Stanford could duplicate
Governor's Corner on the land currently occu
pied by the golf driving range. The land is ideal
for a dorm; and by copying the plans for an al
ready existing residence, Stanford could save a
year or more in architectural planning.
Construction of a new dorm would, of course,
be expensive — almost $30,000 per bed. But
capital is not Stanford's problem. The University
could finance such construction through the issue
of tax-exempt bonds. This is the way Stanford
financed Governor's Corner and a large part of
the Near West Campus. Because these bonds are
tax exempt, their yield would be low; student
rents would not have to increase dramatically to
pay for the new buildings.
The University could also borrow outside capi
tal. However, outside financers generally demand
a higher return on non-tax exempt investment,
and so students' housing costs would increase.
A better option would be for Stanford to invest
some of its own endowment in residence con
struction. If the school were willing to view the
investment as long-term and did not expect an
unusually high rate of return, a new dormitory
could be financed without substantially increas
ing student board fees.
Moreover, the lower yield of such an invest
ment would be offset by its security. After all,
Stanford invests money in stocks that may go up,
but may also crash. It makes financial sense for
the University to settle for a lower yield on a
safer investment.
The Roble disaster brings Stanford to a cross
roads in its residential planning. Whether the
University treats Roble as a short-term crisis with
a short-term solution or as an opportunity to
thoughtfully reconsider the issue of student
housing will have profound repercussions for stu
dent life on this campus.
