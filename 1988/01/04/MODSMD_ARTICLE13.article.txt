People are able to
make a difference
Scott Lyon's latest column
(Daily, Dec. 4) was the last one I
could tolerate without respond
ing. 1 found it to be one of his less
offensive columns, but when he
equated pragmatism with apathy,
1 could take it no more.
Lyon's assertion that "people
don't get involved in politics be
cause they know that, contrary to
what some people tell them, they
will not make a difference," is
ridiculous. People do make a dif
ference. If he needs proof, he can
talk to those people who have
taken a stand and are struggling
for change in our Western Cul
ture requirement. These are
people who truly have made a dif
ference.
Lyon has taken his failure to
maintain the status quo of West
ern Culture as a personal defeat

and has used it to justify his own
apathy. It is extremely rude of
him to relate his personal apathy
to the American people in gen
eral because it is precisely this ex
pression of the individual's insig
nificance that is at the root of
American apathy.

The Stanford Symphony Or
chestra would like to thank the
Stanford community for its
response to our opening concert
Friday, Dec. 4. Every seat in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium was
filled, and people were sitting in
the aisles to see our performance
of Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheher
azade." Stravinsky's "Firebird
Suite" and pieces by Barber and
Vauehan Williams.

As hard as it may be to believe,
this enthusiasm from students
toward the symphony has not
been seen in recent Stanford his
tory. We thank you for helping to
make this change possible.
Administrators from the Music
Department and the Centennial
Committee on up to University
President Kennedy have sup
ported this renaissance of the
symphony in preparation for the
Far East tour that will take place
in June, 1988. Combined with the
increasing support of the student
body, the administration's
response has given us the incen
tive to push for performance ex
cellence.
Thank you for helping us to be
an integral part of Stanford's
growing achievement in the fine
arts. We hope you will continue
to support us in upcoming events.
