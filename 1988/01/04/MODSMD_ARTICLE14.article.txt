# A 						melange of mid-winter musings
## 
### 
As I struggle to get myself psyched
about winter quarter, I find my thoughts
are utterly, hopelessly confused. It's too
soon after the holidays to be back at
Stanford. After two weeks of relaxed
mindlessness and contentment, thinking
about school again is rather difficult. I've
been on vacation and so has my mind.

I'd been mulling over topics for this
column, and I had several ideas, but not
enough to say on each of them to fill an
entire column. Therefore, I might as well
start off 1988 by purging my mind of
these random thoughts. Then I'll be
ready to do all sorts of good things this
quarter, like starting problem sets the
day they're assigned and reviewing mate
rial one week before each midterm
(yeah, right).
• Why don't the Stanford cheerleaders
feel right? They look good. They sound
good. But it doesn't feel good to see them
out there. The idea of getting a group of
people together to spark crowds and lead

them in cheers is a good one, and long
overdue, considering the rather blase
character of your average Stanford sports
crowd. But for some reason, watching the
new cheerleaders makes me feel uncom
fortable. Judging from the way people
have booed them at Big Game and at the
basketball games, they make others un
comfortable, too. So what's the problem?
Maybe they don't fit Stanford's image.
Hmmm. . . .
• What exactly is Stanford's image?
Stanford students sometimes seem to
have split personalities. We want to be on
the same academic level as the Ivy
League schools. But at the same time, we
want to be as unlike them as possible —
none of that stereotypical Eastern
preppieness or "stuffiness." Sometimes it
seems as if the essence of being a Stan
ford student is to never let the outside
world know how hard you have to work
once you get here.
• Why is it so hard to carry on a reasona
bly animated conversation at the break
fast table? "Morning people" can do it,
but most of us just sit there with blank
looks on our faces and eat mechanically.
I feel bad that sometimes I seem rather
"brusque" in the morning, but I don't
mean to be. It's just that my mind isn't
fully conscious until at least 10 a.m.
Morning people, on the other hand, can
jump straight out of bed and immediately

act in an alert, cheerful, fully functional
manner. Some of them even stay that
way the entire day. Those kinds of people
scare me. Anyone who has eaten a meal
at Lagunita dining hall will understand
what I mean. These people seem so
genuinely happy all day long it is rather
frightening.
» . (
• Why are midterms called "midterms" ?
If midterms lived up to their names, we'd
only have them once a quarter, not every
other week. Maybe we should stop
fooling ourselves and call them "tests" or
"flails" instead.
• Maybe people don't like the Stanford
cheerleaders because they make us look
like "normal" schools (heaven forbid). If
they took off the matching uniforms and
wore everyday casual wear instead, they
might appear more acceptable, at least to
Stanford students. After all, if the Band
is any indication, then the popularity of a
Stanford organization is inversely
proportional to its normality.
• Why don't people use bike lights? (You
know — "Bike at night? Light. Right!"
Try saying it fast five times.) Obviously,
you'll never find a light bright enough to
actually show you where you're going.
However, bike lights do come in handy in
preventing late-night head-on collisions
with your fellow Stanford students. I
can't count how many times, riding in the
darkness, I've felt a whoosh! and realized

I've just narrowly missed a hiker by a few
inches. I hate to think of how many
hikers have been nearly squashed by cars
because motorists couldn't see them. It
frustrates me because someday I'm going
to get in an accident and break my neck,
and it'll be the other person's fault.
• Why do people at the early Flicks
throw paper airplanes, but people at the
late Flicks just throw paper? Maybe mel
low people don't like to stay up late. Who
cleans up all that paper, anyway? And
why don't they ever turn up the volume?
With this quarter's Flicks schedule, the
volume should definitely be cranked up a
few notches. To get the full effect of such
mind-thrashing movies as "Robocop" or
"Full Metal Jacket," and especially "The
Wall," you really need to be blasted out
of your senses.
• Why is the Dish always pointing to the
left? Why don't they put Christmas lights
on it during the holiday season (or on
Hoover Tower, for that matter)?
And speaking of Christmas, why did
we get out of fall quarter so late? If we
started school only one week earlier we'd
have a bit more time to get psyched
about the holidays, instead of summon
ing up all of our good cheer on our way
home from Stanford.

Stanford. After two weeks of relaxed
mindlessness and contentment, thinking
about school again is rather difficult. I've
been on vacation and so has my mind.

I'd been mulling over topics for this
column, and I had several ideas, but not
enough to say on each of them to fill an
entire column. Therefore, I might as well
start off 1988 by purging my mind of
these random thoughts. Then I'll be
ready to do all sorts of good things this
quarter, like starting problem sets the
day they're assigned and reviewing mate
rial one week before each midterm
(yeah, right).
• Why don't the Stanford cheerleaders
feel right? They look good. They sound
good. But it doesn't feel good to see them
out there. The idea of getting a group of
people together to spark crowds and lead

them in cheers is a good one, and long
overdue, considering the rather blase
character of your average Stanford sports
crowd. But for some reason, watching the
new cheerleaders makes me feel uncom
fortable. Judging from the way people
have booed them at Big Game and at the
basketball games, they make others un
comfortable, too. So what's the problem?
Maybe they don't fit Stanford's image.
Hmmm. . . .
• What exactly is Stanford's image?
Stanford students sometimes seem to
have split personalities. We want to be on
the same academic level as the Ivy
League schools. But at the same time, we
want to be as unlike them as possible —
none of that stereotypical Eastern
preppieness or "stuffiness." Sometimes it
seems as if the essence of being a Stan
ford student is to never let the outside
world know how hard you have to work
once you get here.
• Why is it so hard to carry on a reasona
bly animated conversation at the break
fast table? "Morning people" can do it,
but most of us just sit there with blank
looks on our faces and eat mechanically.
I feel bad that sometimes I seem rather
"brusque" in the morning, but I don't
mean to be. It's just that my mind isn't
fully conscious until at least 10 a.m.
Morning people, on the other hand, can
jump straight out of bed and immediately

act in an alert, cheerful, fully functional
manner. Some of them even stay that
way the entire day. Those kinds of people
scare me. Anyone who has eaten a meal
at Lagunita dining hall will understand
what I mean. These people seem so
genuinely happy all day long it is rather
frightening.

• Why are midterms called "midterms" ?
If midterms lived up to their names, we'd
only have them once a quarter, not every
other week. Maybe we should stop
fooling ourselves and call them "tests" or
"flails" instead.
• Maybe people don't like the Stanford
cheerleaders because they make us look
like "normal" schools (heaven forbid). If
they took off the matching uniforms and
wore everyday casual wear instead, they
might appear more acceptable, at least to
Stanford students. After all, if the Band
is any indication, then the popularity of a
Stanford organization is inversely
proportional to its normality.
• Why don't people use bike lights? (You
know — "Bike at night? Light. Right!"
Try saying it fast five times.) Obviously,
you'll never find a light bright enough to
actually show you where you're going.
However, bike lights do come in handy in
preventing late-night head-on collisions
with your fellow Stanford students. I
can't count how many times, riding in the
darkness, I've felt a whoosh! and realized

I've just narrowly missed a hiker by a few
inches. I hate to think of how many
hikers have been nearly squashed by cars
because motorists couldn't see them. It
frustrates me because someday I'm going
to get in an accident and break my neck,
and it'll be the other person's fault.
• Why do people at the early Flicks
throw paper airplanes, but people at the
late Flicks just throw paper? Maybe mel
low people don't like to stay up late. Who
cleans up all that paper, anyway? And
why don't they ever turn up the volume?
With this quarter's Flicks schedule, the
volume should definitely be cranked up a
few notches. To get the full effect of such
mind-thrashing movies as "Robocop" or
"Full Metal Jacket," and especially "The
Wall," you really need to be blasted out
of your senses.
• Why is the Dish always pointing to the
left? Why don't they put Christmas lights
on it during the holiday season (or on
Hoover Tower, for that matter)?
And speaking of Christmas, why did
we get out of fall quarter so late? If we
started school only one week earlier we'd
have a bit more time to get psyched
about the holidays, instead of summon
ing up all of our good cheer on our way
home from Stanford.
