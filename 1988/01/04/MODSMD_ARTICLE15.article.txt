## Polish resistance alive and well 
### 
Whatever happened to Solidarity? From
here, at least, it seems almost to have
vanished. Did the Polish government succeed
in crushing it? Did it melt into the ground
from apathy or run, diluted by time, into the
Baltic Sea?

Hardly. It may have disappeared from the
headlines, but it has not disappeared from the
world. It has not disappeared from Poland.
Rather, I would say that it has, in the language
of chemistry, sublimed — gone from the solid
form we knew to a kind of powerful vapor —
and done so without losing one speck of its
mass.
The days of head-on impact have passed,
for now, and the tactic of the day is pressure
— omnipresent, unremitting resistance.
Solidarity today has become the very atmos
phere of Poland. It penetrates everywhere,
connects people invisibly, lets them breathe,
lets them speak, carries their voices to one an
other and to the world. And so Solidarity has
proved itself mutable, but not silenceable.
But the low profile that allows activists to
maneuver and survive also makes them vul
nerable. Take for example Zbigniew and
Zofia Romaszewski, heads of Solidarity's
Human Rights Commission. Zbigniew
Romaszewski, a physicist, was driving a car a
few weeks ago that went out of control on a

highway outside Warsaw and plunged over an
embankment. No one was killed, but several
of the passengers were seriously injured, in
cluding American human rights activist
Ginetta Sagan of Atherton, who was flown
home immediately afterward for treatment of
her injuries.

Solidarity today has become
the very atmosphere of
Poland. It penetrates
everywhere, connects
people invisibly.

It was discovered that the car's steering sys
tem had been tampered with, another exam
ple of what might he called the
"Silkwoodization" of the Polish human rights
movement. The Wall Street Journal has re
ported that there have heen 89 such suspici
ous automobile accidents involving activists in
the past six years in Poland.
Both Romaszewskis were at one time in
prison for their human rights work and were
adopted as prisoners of conscience by Am
nesty International. But the Polish govern
ment, bowing to international pressure,
released them and many others in 1983 and
1984. The government can no longer get away
with dragging people from their homes and

locking them up or heating them to death, and
so it has had to disguise its efforts at repres
sion.
Romaszewski was the target of another
saboteur this month; and so, in an effort to fix
the Polish government in the headlights of in
ternational attention, Sagan's Aurora Foun
dation has announced a $100,000 award to
the Romaszewskis, which was awarded in a
ceremony at Stanford's Memorial Church
Dec. 10. The award, part of the worldwide ob
servance of International Human Rights Day,
was accepted on behalf of the Romaszewskis
(who have been denied permission to travel)
by Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz.
Will they actually receive the money and
get to use it? One shouldn't underestimate the
Polish resistance. There may be as many as
50,000 full-time Solidarity workers in Poland.
They publish newspapers, magazines and
more book titles per year than the Stanford,
Harvard and University of California presses
combined. I believe they could smuggle
Hoover Tower into Jaruzelski's dining room if
they wanted to.
But it is the attention, and not the money,
that may well save the Romaszewskis lives. In
honoring the Romaszewskis, the Aurora
Foundation has imitated its celestial
namesake, manifesting the invisible to the
people of the world, exciting the atmosphere
and, for one winter night at least, making it
glow.
