# Effects on Draw likely to be minimal

### Russell Korobkin Editorial staff 
The closing of Roble Hall will prob
ably not affect the number of housing
spaces that can be assigned in the an
nual housing Draw, according to the
director of the Stanford Housing Cen
ter.
But special privileges Roble resi
dents will receive in the Draw, along
with the elimination of that dorm
from the residence pool, are likely to
make it more difficult for other stu
dents to draw into desirable housing
for next fall.
Housing Center Director Rodger
Whitney said it is "reasonable" to
think enough undergraduate spaces
can be found and created throughout
the Stanford housing system to make
up for the lost Roble spaces.
Although he stressed that no deci
sions have been made yet, Whitney

speculated that a "large majority" of
the new spaces created this month to
house Roble students for the
remainder of this year will be assigned
for next year also, through the Draw.
The new spaces were created by
reconfiguring and redesignating dorm
guest rooms, seminar rooms, com
puter rooms, study rooms and libra
ries across campus, and by placing ad
ditional students in some relatively
large student rooms and trailers that
are already occupied.
According to Bill Georges, assistant
director of the Housing Center,
enough housing exists to accomodate
300-500 unguaranteed students in a
normal year, so even if no new spaces
were created for next year, Stanford
would still be able to honor its guar
antee of three years of on-campus
housing for all undergraduates.
Displaced upperclass Roble stu
dents will be compensated for their

inconvenience with preferential treat
ment in The Draw Ruble students
with guaranteed housing status this
year — the overwhelming majority of
students in the popular residence —
will he given an additional year of
guaranteed housing. This is likely to
slightly increase the number of stu
dents in the "guaranteed" pool this
spring.
It is also likely to lessen the pain felt
by many Roble residents, including
sophomore Susan Lopez-Aguado.
"They're giving me another
guaranteed year, so I don't care," she
said.
Roble freshmen will not receive an
additional year of guaranteed
housing.
Roble upperclass residents will also
benefit from a decision to allow them
a limited returning resident priority to
the suites or any coed dorm. Students
normally receive returning resident

priorities for all residences they live in
after their freshman year, allowing
them to return there in any future
guaranteed year if they choose to do
so.
Only 15 percent of the upperclass
spaces in any dorm, however, may be
claimed by Roble residents,
presumably to prevent them from
claiming most or all of the available
spaces in the more popular dorms. A
second special draw will be held
among Roble residents later this
quarter to determine which students
will have priority in claiming claiming
returning residence priority, Georges
said.
Georges pointed out that, under the
plan, a maximum of 20 displaced stu
dents will be able to claim priority at
I oyoil Hall
Still, the "any dorm" priority plus
the extra guaranteed year and the
ability of all Roble students to
claim returning resident priority
to wherever they find themselves
this year, threatens to severely
reduce the number of spaces in
the most preferred dorms
available in The Draw.
Whitney said the Roble situa
tion will disrupt the Draw for
"one year, and probably two."
The situation will probably not
affect the returning resident
priority system as a whole, he
said.
Whitney said that if Roble re
opens, or if another undergradu
ate dorm opens, the rooms
created for the emergency will
probably no longer be used as
private rooms. "All the program
matic spaces (study rooms, etc.)
will eventually go back to their
programmatic uses."
In addition to the spaces
created this month for Roble resi
dents, openings for undergradu
ates may be created next fall in
Manzanita Park, Mirrielees,
and/or co-ops by allotting some
graduate spaces in those residents
to undergraduates, Whitney said.
However, even if spaces in
some residences are taken from
graduates and redesignated for
undergraduates, the total number
of graduate housing spaces on
campus will increase next year,
Whitney said. He noted that the
Liliore Green Rains apartments,
currently under construction, will

be open for 760 graduate stu
dents. The complex is located on
Campus Drive adjacent to the
Cowell Cluster.
Whitney said that the Rains
apartments will remain for
graduates only, as planned. No
undergraduates will be assigned
there in the Draw.
Whitney added that more un
dergraduate spaces might eventu
ally be created by making some
upperclass singles in Lagunita
Court into doubles for freshman
and/or upperclassmen —
"probably a combination," he
concluded. At present, rooms
identical in size to the upperclass
singles are used as doubles for
freshmen.
Although it remains unclear
exactly where all the new spaces
will be, it is clear that the percen
tage of freshmen in four-class
dorms will increase next year.
Roble normally houses 104 fresh
men.
Most new upperclass spaces are
likely to be created in dorms that
do not currently house freshmen,
Whitney said.
Whatever changes will be made
in allocating housing spaces will
have to be made soon. According
to Whitney, the Draw Book,
which details student housing op
tions, must be sent to press in
early February. The deadline for
literature concerning graduate
students housing is even sooner.
Whitney said that all decisions
concerning new housing spaces
will made by Residential Educa
tion officials, with input from res
ident fellows and resident assis
tants.

The situation will probably not
affect the returning resident
priority system as a whole, he
said.
Whitney said that if Roble re
opens, or if another undergradu
ate dorm opens, the rooms
created for the emergency will
probably no longer be used as
private rooms. "All the program
matic spaces (study rooms, etc.)
will eventually go back to their
programmatic uses."
In addition to the spaces
created this month for Roble resi
dents, openings for undergradu
ates may be created next fall in
Manzanita Park, Mirrielees,
and/or co-ops by allotting some
graduate spaces in those residents
to undergraduates, Whitney said.
However, even if spaces in
some residences are taken from
graduates and redesignated for
undergraduates, the total number
of graduate housing spaces on
campus will increase next year,
Whitney said. He noted that the
Liliore Green Rains apartments,
currently under construction, will

be open for 760 graduate stu
dents. The complex is located on
Campus Drive adjacent to the
Cowell Cluster.
Whitney said that the Rains
apartments will remain for
graduates only, as planned. No
undergraduates will be assigned
there in the Draw.
Whitney added that more un
dergraduate spaces might eventu
ally be created by making some
upperclass singles in Lagunita
Court into doubles for freshman
and/or upperclassmen —
"probably a combination," he
concluded. At present, rooms
identical in size to the upperclass
singles are used as doubles for
freshmen.
Although it remains unclear
exactly where all the new spaces
will be, it is clear that the percen
tage of freshmen in four-class
dorms will increase next year.
Roble normally houses 104 fresh
men.
Most new upperclass spaces are
likely to be created in dorms that
do not currently house freshmen,
Whitney said.
Whatever changes will be made
in allocating housing spaces will
have to be made soon. According
to Whitney, the Draw Book,
which details student housing op
tions, must be sent to press in
early February. The deadline for
literature concerning graduate
students housing is even sooner.
Whitney said that all decisions
concerning new housing spaces
will made by Residential Educa
tion officials, with input from res
ident fellows and resident assis
tants.
The closing of Roble Hall will prob
ably not affect the number of housing
spaces that can be assigned in the an
nual housing Draw, according to the
director of the Stanford Housing Cen
ter.
But special privileges Roble resi
dents will receive in the Draw, along
with the elimination of that dorm
from the residence pool, are likely to
make it more difficult for other stu
dents to draw into desirable housing
for next fall.
Housing Center Director Rodger
Whitney said it is "reasonable" to
think enough undergraduate spaces
can be found and created throughout
the Stanford housing system to make
up for the lost Roble spaces.
Although he stressed that no deci
sions have been made yet, Whitney

speculated that a "large majority" of
the new spaces created this month to
house Roble students for the
remainder of this year will be assigned
for next year also, through the Draw.
The new spaces were created by
reconfiguring and redesignating dorm
guest rooms, seminar rooms, com
puter rooms, study rooms and libra
ries across campus, and by placing ad
ditional students in some relatively
large student rooms and trailers that
are already occupied.
According to Bill Georges, assistant
director of the Housing Center,
enough housing exists to accomodate
300-500 unguaranteed students in a
normal year, so even if no new spaces
were created for next year, Stanford
would still be able to honor its guar
antee of three years of on-campus
housing for all undergraduates.
Displaced upperclass Roble stu
dents will be compensated for their

inconvenience with preferential treat
ment in The Draw Ruble students
with guaranteed housing status this
year — the overwhelming majority of
students in the popular residence —
will he given an additional year of
guaranteed housing. This is likely to
slightly increase the number of stu
dents in the "guaranteed" pool this
spring.
It is also likely to lessen the pain felt
by many Roble residents, including
sophomore Susan Lopez-Aguado.
"They're giving me another
guaranteed year, so I don't care," she
said.
Roble freshmen will not receive an
additional year of guaranteed
housing.
Roble upperclass residents will also
benefit from a decision to allow them
a limited returning resident priority to
the suites or any coed dorm. Students
normally receive returning resident

priorities for all residences they live in
after their freshman year, allowing
them to return there in any future
guaranteed year if they choose to do
so.
Only 15 percent of the upperclass
spaces in any dorm, however, may be
claimed by Roble residents,
presumably to prevent them from
claiming most or all of the available
spaces in the more popular dorms. A
second special draw will be held
among Roble residents later this
quarter to determine which students
will have priority in claiming claiming
returning residence priority, Georges
said.
Georges pointed out that, under the
plan, a maximum of 20 displaced stu
dents will be able to claim priority at
I oyoil Hall
Still, the "any dorm" priority plus
the extra guaranteed year and the
ability of all Roble students to
claim returning resident priority
to wherever they find themselves
this year, threatens to severely
reduce the number of spaces in
the most preferred dorms
available in The Draw.
Whitney said the Roble situa
tion will disrupt the Draw for
"one year, and probably two."
The situation will probably not
affect the returning resident
priority system as a whole, he
said.
