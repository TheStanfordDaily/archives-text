## Experts say they're unnecessary, but... Vitamin use is on upswing in U.S. 
### Lydia Selling Staff writer 
A young woman enters a store,
plunks down $50 for six bottles of
vitamins and heads home. Al
though the trip was expensive, the
woman is confident she has spent
her money well. She is sure the
vitamins will keep her healthy for
the next few months.

This scenario is becoming in
creasingly common in super
markets, health food stores, phar
macies and corner markets across
the United States. About 40 per
cent of the U.S. population be
tween the ages of 18 and 74 takes
vitamin and mineral supplements
regularly, according to a recent
survey conducted by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA).
Some experts argue that the
use of vitamin supplements is of
ten a waste of time because most
Americans obtain adequate vita
min levels from the foods they
eat. "It's really rare to have a vi
tamin deficiency unless there is an
underlying chronic problem
causing loss of nutrients, such as a
gastrointestinal disturbance or
blood loss," said JoAnn Hattner,
a dietician at the Stanford Medi
cal Center.
Hattner said iron deficiency is

the most common nutritional
problem for Americans and that
it is often caused by an insuffi
cient intake of calories or protein.
She added that people following
vegetarian diets are more likely to
develop iron deficiencies.
Americans spend over $1.5 bil
lion each year on vitamin and
mineral supplements, making
them the most common non
prescription pharmaceuticals
taken in this country.
According to FDA researchers,
supplements are often taken
without medical or scientific justi
fication. "Our No. 1 recommen
dation is that you get [vitamins]
through food first. There's better
utilization, better absorption —
it's always better to get vitamins
through eating," Hattner said.
The FDA study found that
most often people were taking
single vitamin supplements, such
as vitamin C pills. Multivitamins,
which contain a full range of
vitamins and minerals, were the
third most widely consumed form
of supplement.
Again, this behavior runs con
trary to the views of many experts
who point out that multivitamins
are considered the most valuable
kind of dietary supplement.
"Multivitamins include trace ele
ments for general nutrition. Many
trace elements are related to
quality of diet and total calories,"
Hattner said.
Multivitamins are often recom
mended when obtaining balanced
meals on a consistent basis is dif
ficult. "I recommend the multi
vitamin for students because their

eating habits are not always opti
mal," Hattner said. "Some are
relying on institutional food,
which is fine, but some students
skip meals. If they didn't make it
to lunch, they may skip the meal
entirely."
"Some rely on food choices
which they have in their dorm
room. They may eat a lot of proc
essed, fast food," she said. Hat
tner added that multivitamins
also offer some "overriding
protection" for one's general
health during the winter.
"If a healthy person knows he
isn't eating well, he can take mul
tivitamins, which supply 100 per
cent of the recommended daily
allowances (of several vitamins),"
said Anne Vickrey, a Menlo Park
dietitian. She said that she tells all
her patients on weight-reduction
diets of less than 1200 calories
per day to take multivitamins.
There are 13 vitamins that reg
ulate human body activities, in
cluding vitamins A, C, D, E, K
and the eight B-complex
vitamins.
Recommended daily al
lowances have been set every few
years since 1943 by the Food and
Nutrition Board of the National
Research Council. The recom
mended daily allowances are
measures of daily nutrient intakes
designed to be somewhat higher
than the daily needs of almost all
individuals.
The FDA survey found that 14
percent of respondents were
heavy users of vitamin supple
ments. They took an average of
almost eight times the recom

mended daily allowance for each
nutrient.
"You really have to be quite
knowledgeable (to use individual
vitamins)," Hattner said. "(You
need to know] whether it might
be harmful, whether you might be
interfering with the absorption of
other vitamins and trace elements
by overloading with one vitamin.
All (vitamins and trace elements)
are vying for a little absorptive
site," which can easily be
monopolized by an overdose of a
given vitamin, she said.
"It's a waste if you're taking in
dividual vitamins — there's no
real data" to suggest there are
any benefits, Vickrey said.
Multivitamins vary in price de
pending on whether you buy a
generic or brand-name product.
"I recommend one which is a
generic or store brand as long as it
gives all of the multivitamins,"
Hattner said. "Compare the
generic brand of multivitamins
against the standards of
Theragran or Centrum," Hattner
said.
A study conducted by the
federal Centers for Disease Con
trol found that use of vitamin and
mineral supplements is more
common among older persons,
females, whites, affluent and ed
ucated individuals. The study also
determined that consumption is
highest in the western United
States.
Ironically, the study also deter
mined that Americans with better
diets are more likely to take
supplements than those with poor
diets.
