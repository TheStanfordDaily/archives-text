# LOIS gives Lane hi-tech checkout
## 
### Jeffrey Carpenter 
Medical students should find
library lines a little bit shorter
now that the Lane Medical Li
brary is using the University's
first automated checkout ser
vice.
The Lane On-Line Informa
tion Service (LOIS), which
began Oct. 28, includes an on
line data base similar to
Socrates, but also tells the user
if a book has been checked out
and when it is due; this allows
students to avoid searching
aimlessly for books that are not
in the library.
LOIS uses barcodes that are
read by light pens, or "wands,"
that update the computer's
files within 30 seconds. Each
library user is assigned an indi
vidually coded card that is
renewed annually.
Thirty-five percent of Lane's
holdings, or about 70,000
items, are currently on line.
Each day 100 volumes are
added to LOIS, but systems li
brarian Dick Miller said it is
"impossible" to predict when
LOIS will include all of Lane's
holdings.
Manual checkout at Lane
has been reduced by at least 50
percent, and officials plan to
continue retroactive registra
tion of articles to eventually
eliminate the need for call
cards.

The automated system will
also allow the library to better
serve its users, Lane Deputy
Director Valerie Su said. Lane
will know exactly what its users
need, she said, because LOIS
monitors how frequently each
item is used, and because li
brary card applications include
survey questions for users.
LOIS was also slated for use
in the University's main library
system, which includes Meyer
and Green, but "the University
libraries pulled out" two years
ago because of lack of funding,
according to Lane Library Di
rector Peter Stangl.
Lane continued the project
alone, using only Medical
School funding. "We do not
have a University grant,"
Stangl said.
Stangl said the project re
quired a "long, long planning
process, .. . We're entering
our fifth year."
University library manage
ment last month announced
plans to begin an effort to
create a University-wide
electronic check-out system,
but officials said they plan to
use different software than
LOIS.
Socrates will no longer be
used in Lane, but the library's
holdings will still be included in
Socrates listings so that stu
dents elsewhere can locate
them.
