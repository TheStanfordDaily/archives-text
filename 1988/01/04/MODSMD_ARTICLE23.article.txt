## NCAA title again eludes No. 3 spikers 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
INDIANAPOLIS â€” Once again
Stanford knocked on the door, and
once again there was no one home.
The Cardinal women's volleyball
team reached the NCAA final four for
the sixth consecutive year, hut, as in its
five previous trips, the squad came up
short. After a 15-10, 15-10, 9-15, 15-1
loss to Hawaii in the championship
match, the third-ranked Cardinal (29-
7) ends the season as the national
runner-up for the third time in the last
four years.
The Rainbow Wahines came into the
tournament as the strong favorite to
win the crown behind NCAA Player
of-the-Year Teee Williams and Ail-
Americans Suzanne Eagye and Diana
Jessie. Hawaii disappointed no one.
"When a team with that much talent
plays that well," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said, "they're hard to keep up
with."
The title is the third for Hawaii, with
national titles won in 1982 and 1983;
but this team may be Coach Dave
Shoji's best. Led by seniors Eagye,
Jessie, Tita Ahuna and Mahina
Eleneki, and the sophomore Williams,
the Wahines cruised to the top, drop
ping only one game in five NCAA
playoff matches.
After a fourth-place showing in
1982, a third in 1983, back-to-back
seconds in 1984 and 1985 and a third
place a year ago, Stanford was the only
team in the country to have reached
five consecutive final fours. The Cardi
nal extended the streak to six this year,
but not without a struggle.
Stanford demolished the Oregon
Ducks in a first-round match, winning
the right to host the West regional
tournament in the process. This region
appeared to be the most competitive in
the nation, with Stanford squaring off
against No. 6 Colorado State in one
semifinal, and fourth-ranked Brigham
Young meeting fifth-ranked UCLA in
the other.
In the first match, the Cardinal over
powered the Rams, winning 15-8, 15-
9, 15-12 to advance to the regional
final. Leading the way were seniors
Teresa Smith and Nancy Reno. Smith
totaled a match-high 1 8 kills and a .485
hitting percentage, while Reno notched
16 kills on a .353 percentage.

Junior Amy Hayes added 12 kills
and a match-high 15 digs in the effort.
Both Reno and senior setter Wendi
Rush were named First-Team All-
America at the end of the season while,
Smith was named to the second-team.
Although both Stanford and
Colorado State were somewhat off in
their play Dec. 12, the Cardinal was
the superior squad. The next match,
however, provided more drama and a
higher level of play, as BYU surprised
many by beating UCLA in four games
only four weeks after the Bruins had
beaten the Cougars in Provo.
BYU got a stellar performance from
junior outside hitter iill Plumb, who
tallied 26 kills and a .512 hitting per
centage. Also contributing heavily
were junior Dylann Duncan and senior
setter Mariliisa Salmi, as well as fresh
man Marinda Gorbahn, who played
despite a stress fracture injury to her
left foot
The Cougar win set up a familiar
scenario: Stanford vs. BYU in the West
regional final. The two teams have met
in this situation in each of the last three
years, with the Cardinal prevailing on
all three occasions.
Two years ago, the teams played at
Maples, and the then top-ranked Car
dinal easily handled the Cougars. Last
year, when Stanford went to Utah, the
Cardinal upset the No. 1 Cougars and
ended their 25-match winning streak.
The BYU players were hoping to
return the favor Dec. 13 but were
rudely awakened by a fired-up Stan
ford squad. The Cardinal ended BYU's
season for the third straight year, pos
ting a 15-9, 15-6, 11-15, 15-4 win.
Stanford was able to slow down both
Plumb and Duncan by posting 16 total
blocks, compared to the Cougars'
eight. Junior Laura Olesen and sopho
more Lara Asper led the way on the
blocking front as they put a wall up in
front of Plumb and the injured Gor
bahn.
Gorbahn aggravated her stress
fracture during warmups before the
match, causing her to miss the first
game. She returned for the final three,
however. Despite a team-high .381 hit
ting percentage, however, she was not
enough to stem the Cardinal tide.
Smith and Reno continued to pro
vide the offense for the Cardinal, re
cording 24 and 23 kills, respectively, to
earn spots on the all-tournament team.

They were joined by Rush, as well as
Salmi, Plumb and Duncan from BYU.
That win sent the Cardinal to In
dianapolis for another shot at that
elusive national title. There Stanford
met Texas, the South region's repre
sentative. The match provided few
highlights for Cardinal fans during the
first three games as Stanford could not
get on track.
Texas took both the first and third
games, and except for a 15-12 Stanford
triumph in the second, the match
would have gone to the Longhorns.
The key for Texas during the match
was the play of reserve freshman
Quandalyn Harrell. Harrell came in of
ten during the match to spark the
Longhorn attack with 16 kills.
The match was almost over when the
Longhorns jumped out to a 6-4 lead in
game four, but the Cardinal finally
came alive, thanks to a substitution of
its own.
Sophomore Jenny Chaffee came in
to save the day for Stanford, leading
the Cardinal to 1 1 straight points to
pull out the fourth game. The Cardinal
then cruised through the fifth en route
to an 11-15, 15-12, 8-15, 15-6, 15-5
win. Chaffee tallied eight kills in the
last game alone, finishing with 18 for
the match. Reno led both teams with
21.
"I'm really relieved that this is over
with," Shaw said. "It was just a case of
our having to pull ourselves together
(in the fourth game)."
"They kept us down for a while,"
Reno said, "but we've been down
before."
Two nights later the Cardinal put in
a much better performance, but it was
not enough to disrupt the Hawaiian
juggernaut that has rolled over every
team this season. Williams led the way
with 21 kills, while Eagye had 12
blocks to lead the victors. The high
note for the Cardinal was a career-high
29-dig effort by Smith, but it was not
enough to stop the skywalking Wil
liams and her teammates.
Williams, Eagye, Jessie, Smith, Rush
and Reno made the all-tournament
team.
"Hawaii just played a really nice
match tonight," Shaw said. "It was a
case of their putting some balls away
when they had to.
"I'm very proud of my team; they've
done a great job all year long."
