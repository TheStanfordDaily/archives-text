# Card off to 10-3 start
## 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
Christmas break wasn't much of a break for the
Stanford basketball team as the squad played six
games in 16 days, but the Cardinal isn't complain
ing.
Stanford's only loss during vacation was to
defending national champion Indiana in the cham
pionship game of the Hoosier Classic, while wins
over UCLA, USC and previously undefeated UC-
Santa Barbara established the Cardinal as one of the
premier teams on the West Coast and the favorite to
finish second in the Pacific 10 Conference behind
No. 1 Arizona.
Stanford, which has not received an invitation to
the NCAA tournament since winning the national
championship in 1942, is now 10-3 overall and 2-0
in the Pac-10— the Cardinal's best start in league
play since 1971 -72.
Here, in reverse chronological order, is a con
densed version of the six games over break:
Jan. 2 — Stanford 83, Seattle Pacific 78 (OT)
Junior Terry Taylor hit a school-record eight
three-point shots (in 1 1 attempts) and a career-high
26 points to lead the Cardinal to an overtime win
over the Falcons at Maples Pavilion Saturday night.
It was a sluggish outing for the rest of the Stan
ford squad, however, as the lightly-regarded Divi
sion II school held Stanford's leading scorer, Todd
Lichti, to 10 points and gave the Cardinal a scare.
Down by as many as 10 points in the second half,
Seattle Pacific battled back in the last three minutes
on three straight baskets by guard Mark Sundquist
to tie the score 70-70 with 1:4 I left.
With 21 seconds left on the clock and Seattle
Pacific leading 71-70, Sundquist hit the front end of
a one-and-one to put the Falcons up 72-70, but the
senior missed his second shot, and Stanford center
Greg Butler hit an 11-footer at the other end to
send the game into overtime.
A Taylor three-point shot put the Cardinal on top
77.74 with 2:03 left in overtime, and the Cardinal
did not relinquish the lead again, going on to win by
five.
"Seattle Pacific did a great job, no question,''
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said. "They
were ready to play, and they had a well-devised
game plan. They shot the ball extremely well and
played with a lot of confidence. I'm partly at fault —
I did not prepare the kids to play Seattle Pacific well
enough. . . . We were very fortunate to get into
overtime."
Dec. 29 — Indiana 83, Stanford 73
Bobby Knight's Hoosiers jumped off to a 10-0
and then a 20-4 lead against the Cardinal in the final
game of the Hoosier Classic at Indianapolis. To its
credit, however, Stanford stayed in the game and
came within six points of Indiana in the second half.
"We actually made it a little tougher on ourselves
with our opening nervousness and errors,"
Montgomery said "You can't get like that against a
team like Indiana ( After we adjusted) I was proud
of our play from that point forward
Forward Rick Calloway scored 2 7 points, and
center Dean Garrett pulled down I 2 rebounds for

14th-ranked Indiana. Butler led Stanford with 16
points, while Howard Wright and Bryan
McSweeney each collected nine hoards for the Car
dinal as Stanford outrebounded the Hoosiers 39-26.
"1 really liked the way Stanford played," Knight
said. "You've got a team representing one of our
best academic institutions, and they played us right
to the hilt. They show that the game can be played
by people who are students. They played very well.
They wouldn't let us get away from them."
Dec. 28 — Stanford 75, UC-Santa Barbara 65
The Gauchos entered their first-round game in
the Hoosier Classic with a 7-0 record and heralded
as the best team on the West Coast, but the Cardinal
dispelled that myth with a comeback win sparked by
Wright and Lichti.
Trailing by 12 points in the second half, Wright
hit three straight shots to narrow the score to 5 1 -44,
and minutes later the junior's five-foot bank shot
put the Cardinal ahead 57-56.
"In the last 10 minutes we really self-destructed,"
Santa Barbera Coach Jerry Pimm said. "I have to
give credit to Stanford for their defensive play al
though we forced more turnovers for ourselves than
they did."
Lichti, who was named to the all-tournament
team, scored a game-high 30 points and made 18-
of-1 8 free throws. Wright grabbed 1 1 boards for the
Cardinal.
"I thought Lichti really came to play," Pimm said.
"He really hurt us. From the last 12 minutes to the
four minute mark he was great."
Dec. 23 — Stanford 116, UCLA 110 (2(>T)
It's a shame this game was during vacation, be
cause Stanford's double overtime win against the
defending Pac-10 champions was one of the most
exciting contests at Maples Pavilion in years.
Still, a near-capacity crowd of 7236 and a local
television audience saw UCLA come back from a
16-point second half deficit to tie the game 84-84
with seven seconds left in regulation on an 18-foot
jumper by Bruin guard Pooh Richardson.
Stanford fell behind 98 92 with just 32 seconds
remaining in the first overtime period, but Wright
hit a free throw and freshman forward Andrew
Vlahov sank a three pointer (his first of the year) to
cut the difference to two with 19 seconds left on the
clock.
Bruin forward Trevor Wilson hit the front end of
a one-and-one to make the score 99 96 in favor of
UCLA, but the sophomore missed the second shot,
and Lichti took the ball at half court, dribbled to the
three-point line and launched a shot with four
seconds left.
The jumper was good, and the officials signaled
that it was a three pointer, although television
replays later showed that Lichti's foot was over the
line. Nevertheless, the game went into a second
overtime, and Stanford scored 10 straight points to
go up I 13-103. The Cardinal went on to win by six
as Wright led both teams with 11 rebounds and a
career-high 30 points.
"I got off a pretty good shot," Lichti said. "1 let
to of it, and it was on line and looked good I didn't

have any question at all that it
was a three-pointer; 1 thought I
was far enough outside. That's
what it felt like."
"Lichti made a great shot,"
UCLA Coach Walt Hazzard said.
"The great players do that."

Dec. 21 — Stanford 88, USC 62.
Stanford jumped out to a 13-4
lead and never trailed against the
Trojans, who were preseason
favorites to finish third in the
league. The Cardinal led 48-27 at
halftime and were up by as many
as 31 points in the second half.

Lichti added 19 in Stanford's con
ference opener. Anthony

Pendleton posted 22 points for
USC, including six three
pointers.
"Stanford did the one thing I
think they should have done
playing a team that's struggling —
jumping on them early," USC
Coach George Raveling said.
"They came on early and played
hard from the start. . . . This was
probably the worst coaching job
of my career."

Dec. 18 — Stanford 97, Harvard
60
The Cardinal continued its
domination of the Ivy League
with a 37-point win over the
Crimson at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford blocked six shots and
outrebounded Harvard 57-26, as
Wright collected 13 boards.
Lichti poured in a game-high 20
points in just 25 minutes of play.
