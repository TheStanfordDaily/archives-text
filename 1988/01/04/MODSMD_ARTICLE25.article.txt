# Card women 11-0
## Cagers jump to No. 12 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
There's no place like home, and there's nothing
like perfection. Starting the season ranked in the
top-20 for the first time in University history, the
Stanford women's basketball team has garnered an
1 1-0 record following five wins over Christmas va
cation. The Cardinal has moved up to No. 12 on the
most recent Associated Press poll, and No. 10 in
USA Today's survey.
Stanford is also tops in the Pacific 10 Conference,
although league play does not commence until this
weekend. Even though Stanford was predicted to
finish third in the Pac-10 behind USC and Washing
ton, the Cardinal has outperformed the unranked
Trojans and the No. 14 Huskies.
"The team is handling the ranking real well,"
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We just
have to get used to other teams being up to play us.
Before [this season] playing Stanford wasn't really a
big deal, but now Stanford is a big win."
After five road victories, the Cardinal opened its
home season Dec. 12 against local rival Santa Clara.
Behind the offensive efforts of junior center Jill
Yanke, Stanford defeated the Broncos, 80-67.
Yanke, this season's first Pac-10 Player of the
Week one month ago, led the Cardinal with 18
points and eight rebounds. Freshman guard Sonja
Henning contributed 13 points, while sophomore
forward Katy Steding demonstrated the level of play
that earned her All-Pac-10 freshman honors last
year by garnering 12 points, 13 rebounds and four
assists.
The game also marked the return to action of
junior forward Evon Asforis, who has been plagued
by a recurrent knee injury. Though her playing time
was limited, Asforis proved herself a tough member
of the squad.
"She's working extremely hard," VanDerveer
said. "She's one of the kids who really understands
what she's supposed to do."
Stanford, however, hardly held a monopoly on
good play and talent. Santa Clara forward Cindy
Meckenstock tallied a game-high 20 points, fol
lowed by guard Jennifer Lucas's 16 and guard
Debbie Dyson's 15.
"I thought Santa Clara played well, and Stanford
people may have been concentrating on other things
like exams," VanDerveer said of the finals week
competition. "Their team is more experienced and
played well.
"We're not that good that we can just show up
and win, and that's what some people did in the

Santa Clara game."
Stanford got back in stride the next weekend, gar
nering a decisive 75-43 win over San Francisco and
a 69-59 victory over North Carolina State.
En route to a 32-point margin of victory over the
Dons, the Cardinal jumped out to a 13-4 lead and
finished the half with a 33-19 advantage. Sopho
more guard Jennifer Azzi spearheaded the Stanford
success, accruing 10 points, nine assists, four
rebounds and three steals in just 24 minutes of play.
The squad started out equally as strong the next
evening by jumping out to a 15-0 lead over North
Carolina State, but the Wolfpack rallied to narrow
the Cardinal advantage to 10 points by the final
buzzer.
"We just don't put people away," VanDerveer la
mented. "Some people are watching the scoreboard
instead of just concentrating on the game."
This trend seemed to have changed when Stan
ford hosted the Cardinal Classic Dec. 29-30. First
round action pitted the home team against Minne
sota, yielding a convincing 87-64 win. Oklahoma
beat Simon Fraser 83-66 before becoming the Stan
ford juggernaut's 10th straight victim by suffering a
91-66 loss at the hands of tournament Azzi and her
teammates.
"I was real excited we won our tournament,"
VanDerveer said. "We played spurts and halves
really well. Jennifer (Azzi) and Katy (Steding)
played really well in the Minnesota game, and Sonja
(Henning) had a really good tournament."
Azzi, the tournament's Most Valuable Player,
scored 13 points and dished out 12 assists against
the Golden Gophers and 14 points and 12 assists
against the Sooners. Steding also excelled, ac
cumulating a game-high 20 points.
Yanke and Henning came alive in the final round.
The freshman guard scored 16 points while Yanke,
Stanford's leading scorer who was held to just 10
points in the Golden Gopher game, exploded with
21 points and 13 rebounds.
The 75-69 victory over Purdue extended the Car
dinal win streak to 1 1 games and secured Stanford's
No. 12 spot in the rankings. The hero for this game
was Trisha Stevens, a freshman forward who finally
returned to top form after missing two games in
early December due to injury. Stevens garnered 17
points and six rebounds against the Boilermakers.
The impressive record and ranking could well be
Stanford's ticket to its first appearance in the
NCAA tournament. "Ranking is part of the politi
cal part of selections for NCAAs," VanDerveer
said. "There are only 40 spots, so if we don't win the
conference it's nice to be in the news."
