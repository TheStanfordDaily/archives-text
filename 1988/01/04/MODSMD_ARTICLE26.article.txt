Stanford seniors Teresa Smith
(upper left), Nancy Reno (lower
left) and Wendi Rush (lower
right) have been the core of Car
dinal teams that have reached the
NCAA Final Four in each of their
four years on the Farm.
Reno's acrobatic maneuvers,
Smith's powerful hitting and
Rush's tactical finesse have
earned each a place among col
lege volleyball's elite. Over their
four-year careers, Stanford has
compiled a 101-25 record, three
NCAA second-place finishes and
one third-place finish.
