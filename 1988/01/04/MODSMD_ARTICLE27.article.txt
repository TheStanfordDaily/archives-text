# County completes first phase of University land-use plan
## Planners express desire to work closely with Stanford 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
San Mateo County planners last month com
pleted the first phase of a land-use plan for uni
ncorporated University property in San Mateo
County, a move that University Planning Direc
tor Philip Williams said reaffirm's Stanford's
"need to use land for academic purposes."
County land-use plans specify how certain par
cels of land may be developed. A land-use plan
already exists for Stanford property in Santa
Clara County (such as the campus and the Foot
hills), but no such plans have been developed for
University lands in San Mateo County, which in
clude the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve,
Guernsey Field and the Webb Ranch.
Williams said he hoped the final plan "will
assure people that we aren't going to do anything
that isn't academic," but noted that the plan is
still far from complete.
San Mateo County officials said the new plan
should have little impact on University plans for
its unincorporated land and that the plan is only a
"technicality" to bring current zoning laws into
accordance with current University land use.
San Mateo County Planning Supervisor Mark
Duino said Stanford lands in San Mateo County
are currently designated residential estate zones,
"which doesn't allow for a number of uses that
are in effect right now," such as SLAC.
"This is the first time that there has been a real

studied review of a proposal for Stanford lands,"
Duino said. He explained that the report was
prompted by a county request a few years ago to
develop a specific plan for Stanford's unincor
porated lands in San Mateo County.
"We could write a better set of regulations and
develop new ones more appropriate for a univer
sity," he added.
Duino said the preliminary report was distrib
uted a few weeks ago and is the first step the
county has taken in developing guidelines for de
velopment on unincorporated lands in Menlo
Park, Woodside, Portola Valley and Ladera.
"This is a background report and is the first
step in the overall process. The next report will
be a series of alternatives and should be out in six
to eight months," he said.
Principal County Planner Roman Gankin said
development of such a plan has "always been put
off as something to study in the future. Now that
we have developed this general plan, we're fol
lowing up with developing specific area plans. I
don't see any likelihood that there will be any sig
nificant changes in the current situation, but
there may be some zoning changes."
"We're coming in to bring our zoning into a
compatible relationship with our general plan,"
Gankin said.
Gankin added that he didn't think the plan
would interfere with any University projects.
"We want to work very closely with Stanford
people," he said. "It happens to be their planning
area, and we hope that it coincides with our
zoning considerations."
