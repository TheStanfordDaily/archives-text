# Hart cancels Stanford visit
## 
### Bobby Schrader Senior staff writer 
Democratic presidential hope
ful Gary Hart will not make a
previously scheduled Jan. 13 ap
pearance at Stanford, according
to ASSU Speakers Bureau
spokesperson Terri James.
Hart, who dropped out of the
1988 presidential race last May
and re-entered the contest last
month, accepted an offer in late
November of $7500 from the
ASSU Speakers Bureau to give
an address here titled "America's
Third Century: The Agenda for
Reform," according to James.

Three weeks after scheduling his
Stanford speech, Hart re-entered
the race. According to James, the
Hart campaign then canceled his
planned appearance at Stanford.
Stanford-in-Government Chair
Gary Rosen defended Hart's de
cision to cancel his Stanford
speaking engagement, noting that
critical eastern Democratic pri
maries are coming up in March.
"Now that he's a candidate ... it
would he ridiculous for him to
come to California at this time,"
he said.
"Hart's decision is perfectly in
line with his recent announce
ment (to re-enter the race),"

Rosen said. "Hart is running an
unconventional campaign and . . .
it's a waste of political capital for
him to come out here when he's
got about five or six weeks before
lowa and New Hampshire."
James said she had talked to
members of the Hart campaign
and had suggested to them that
Hart speak here in April in order
to bolster his chances in the June
California Primary.
Although James said Hart's
plans are indefinite, she said she
remains optimistic that Hart will
honor his speaking commitment
to Stanford sometime this year.
