## Secretary is fourth honorary fellow in institution's history 
### 
Secretary of State George Shultz has been named
an honorary fellow of the Hoover Institution, an
honor bestowed only three other times in the think
tank's 59-year history.
Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell, announc
ing the honorary fellowship Dec. 16, called Shultz
"one of America's most distinguished statesmen,
whose association with the Hoover Institution will
be an invaluable asset both to the institution and to
Stanford University."
The other honorary Hoover fellows are President
Reagan and Nobel laureates Alexander Solzhenit
zyn and Friedrich von Hayek.
Campbell said last night that Shultz was selected
as an honorary fellow on the basis of his
"accomplishment" throughout his entire career.

Over the past two decades, Shultz has served as
secretary of labor, director of the Otfice of Manage
ment and Budget, and secretary of the treasury,
Campbell said. Prior to serving as secretary of state,
Shultz was president of the Bechtel Group Inc., an
international conduction and engineering firm.
Honorary fellows are selected by the director of
the Hoover Institution, the Hoover staff, the Uni
versity president and the Board of Trustees.
According to a Hoover Institution press release,
Shultz is expected to return to Stanford when
Reagan leaves office in 1989.
Shultz is currently on leave from the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, where he is the Jack
Steele Parker Professor of International Economics.
He will resume this position upon his return to Stan
ford.
