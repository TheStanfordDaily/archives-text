# Relocation efforts now underway

The University today is continuing its massive,
week-long effort to relocate nearly 300 Roble Hall
residents who have been displaced by the closure of
their dorm due to the discovery of structural weak
nesses.
The students are being moved to reconfigured
study rooms, guest rooms and already-occupied
dorm rooms around campus selected by a staff task
force headed by Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
Roble's 104 freshmen were assigned during win
ter break to living spaces created in all-freshman
and four-class dorms. In making assignments, the
task force and resident assistants attempted to keep
freshmen roommates together, said Roble Resident
Assistant D.J. Dull.
The University created 183 spaces for the 192
Roble upperclassmen after learning that the dorm's
12 RAs plan to move off campus. Most of the Roble
RAs plan to live in a Palo Alto house beginning in
February, according to RA Denise Clark.
Displaced Roble upperclassmen are being placed
in temporary housing until Wednesday, at which
time they will be assigned to a permanent residence
through a mini-housing draw, to be held Tuesday
night, according to Asst. Dean of Residential Edu
cation Diana Conklin.
The 289 new openings created by the Housing
Office consist of 46 upperclass spaces in occupied
rooms, 93 regular spaces vacated by students
leaving University housing and 150 spaces in newly
created rooms.
Undergraduate trailers in Manzanita Park with
three residents will receive a fourth. Additional resi
dents will move to occupied rooms in Durand, 558
Mayfield, Hurlburt, Lathrop, Phi Psi, Phi Sig, Syn
ergy and 353 Campus Drive.
New housing spaces were created by redesignat
ing guest rooms, study rooms, computer rooms,
seminar rooms and small dorm libraries as student
rooms.
No preference will be given to seniors or second
year Roble residents in the mini-draw. That issue
created some dissension during a meeting in Tresid
der Union last night at which resident assistants and
University administrators answered Roble resi
dents' questions.
Students who were assigned to campus housing
on the first round of the winter wait list, Dec. 1, are
not affected by the Roble closing, according to
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of Student Affairs.
However, the housing crunch has forced the
Housing Center to cancel the second round of the
wait list, denying spaces to males with draw num
bers above 3668 and females with numbers above
4210.
To deal with the logistical nightmare of relocating
all the displaced students, a special "Roble Center"
was set up yesterday on the second floor of Tresid
der Union to provide information on new assign-
