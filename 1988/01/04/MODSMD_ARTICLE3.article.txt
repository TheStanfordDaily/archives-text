# Relocation efforts now underway
## 
### Vivian Rogers Staff writer 
The University today is continuing its massive,
week-long effort to relocate nearly 300 Roble Hall
residents who have been displaced by the closure of
their dorm due to the discovery of structural weak
nesses.
The students are being moved to reconfigured
study rooms, guest rooms and already-occupied
dorm rooms around campus selected by a staff task
force headed by Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
Roble's 104 freshmen were assigned during win
ter break to living spaces created in all-freshman
and four-class dorms. In making assignments, the
task force and resident assistants attempted to keep
freshmen roommates together, said Roble Resident
Assistant D.J. Dull.
The University created 183 spaces for the 192
Roble upperclassmen after learning that the dorm's
12 RAs plan to move off campus. Most of the Roble
RAs plan to live in a Palo Alto house beginning in
February, according to RA Denise Clark.
Displaced Roble upperclassmen are being placed
in temporary housing until Wednesday, at which
time they will be assigned to a permanent residence
through a mini-housing draw, to be held Tuesday
night, according to Asst. Dean of Residential Edu
cation Diana Conklin.
The 289 new openings created by the Housing
Office consist of 46 upperclass spaces in occupied
rooms, 93 regular spaces vacated by students
leaving University housing and 150 spaces in newly
created rooms.
Undergraduate trailers in Manzanita Park with
three residents will receive a fourth. Additional resi
dents will move to occupied rooms in Durand, 558
Mayfield, Hurlburt, Lathrop, Phi Psi, Phi Sig, Syn
ergy and 353 Campus Drive.
New housing spaces were created by redesignat
ing guest rooms, study rooms, computer rooms,
seminar rooms and small dorm libraries as student
rooms.
No preference will be given to seniors or second
year Roble residents in the mini-draw. That issue
created some dissension during a meeting in Tresid
der Union last night at which resident assistants and
University administrators answered Roble resi
dents' questions.
Students who were assigned to campus housing
on the first round of the winter wait list, Dec. 1, are
not affected by the Roble closing, according to
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of Student Affairs.
However, the housing crunch has forced the
Housing Center to cancel the second round of the
wait list, denying spaces to males with draw num
bers above 3668 and females with numbers above
4210.
To deal with the logistical nightmare of relocating
all the displaced students, a special "Roble Center"
was set up yesterday on the second floor of Tresid
der Union to provide information on new assign-
ments, moving hours and costs for
room and board.
The center, staffed by Roble
RAs and members of the Housing
Center, will be open 24 hours a
day until Tuesday. Wednesday
and Thursday the center will be
open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Displaced Roble residents will
not be charged more for room
and board in their new housing
than the rate they were paying at
Roble, Whitney said. Students
living in the trailers with four oc
cupants will now be billed the
lower 4-person trailer rate, he
said.
The University has supplied
beds, linens and soap in rooms
where Roble students will be
living because most residents
were unable to move their
belongings yesterday.
Many relocated students do not
have a wardrobe closet or desk in
their new residence, but have
been assured by University offi
cials that regular student room
furniture is on the way.
The University has hired
movers to transfer personal
belongings of the displaced stu
dents from Roble to their new
residences at no cost. Residents
may enter Roble to pack their
belongings from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
today, Wednesday and Thursday,
and from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m. to
morrow.
The University will assume all
costs for new telephone numbers
and installation fees, and the Uni
versity Parking Department will
issue former Roble residents "C"
parking permits at no charge and
will allow them the option of
upgrading their permits to "A"

status at a cost of $72.
Freshmen assignments were
determined by Roble RAs and
members of the task force and are
permanent. Conklin said fresh
men were placed only in all
freshmen and four-class dorms
"to provide for advising and on
campus opportunities."
According to a Residential Ed
ucation breakdown, 10 Roble
freshmen were assigned to Bran
ner Hall, 19 to Florence Moore
Hall, 31 to Stern Hall, 18 to
Toyon Hall, 27 to Wilbur Hall
and one to Lagunita Court.
During Tuesday's draw, Roble
upperclassmen will have a choice
of available spaces campuswide.
They can also take advantage of a
Housing Center offer to release
them from their housing contracts
and move off campus.
Conklin and Asst. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Alice Supton said it
will be possible for former Roble
residents to request a release
from their residence agreement
later in the year if they find that
their new room situation is not
working.
Bill Georges, assistant director
of the Housing Center, said that
"10 to 20" students had already
taken advantage of a general of
fer to release all students from
their housing contracts to make
space for Roble residents. The of
fer will last through this week,
Georges said.
Thursday night at Tresidder,
undergraduates and graduates
not living on campus can attempt
to "walk on" to campus housing.
Despite the desperate situation
now, Whitney said he anticipates
that some walk-ons will be ac
comodated because some Roble
students will prefer to move off
campus. "There are going to be
some spaces," he said.
