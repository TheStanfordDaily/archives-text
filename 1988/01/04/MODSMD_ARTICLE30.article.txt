# Menlo Park residents declare 'war'
## Stanford townhouse plan criticized by local group 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
A University plan to build a
large housing development along
San Francisquito creek has
sparked sharp opposition from a
local citizens' group that says it
will "go to war" to stop the pro
posed project.
Citizens for Sensible Planning,
a growth and development con
trol group based in Menlo Park,
will meet with two University of
ficials today to discuss the new
Stanford West housing project
slated to be built on the north side
of campus next to the Oak Creek
apartments complex.
The citizens' group voiced its
objections after the Board of
Trustees approved the housing
plan Dec. 8. The proposal, which
officials estimate will cost more
than $80 million, calls for 332

townhouse units for staff, faculty
and students and 450 units for
senior citizens.
Bill Watson, a spokesman for
Citizens for Sensible Planning,
said the group objects to the size
of the buildings and to the traffic
congestion he says the 72-acre
new development will create.
"It is a more intense develop
ment than belongs in a residential
area," said Watson, who lives on
Bay Laurel Drive, the Menlo
Park street just across San Fran
cisquito Creek from the proposed
housing.
Although the current plan is 26
acres larger than an earlier Stan
ford West plan proposed in 1982,
it is less than half the density of
the original 1200-unit project.
According to Stanford Director
of Community Relations Andy
Doty, four-story units would be
built on the Sand Hill side of the

property, the farthest from the
Menlo Park side, while two-story
units would he huilt near the
creek across from Menlo Park.
In addition, Doty said there
will be 18 acres of open area,
about one city block, between the
creek and the closest housing
unit.
"We're caught in the middle,"
Doty said. "On the one hand we
want to provide the maximum
amount of housing. There is a se
vere need for housing for staff,
faculty and students. The Univer
sity has the responsibility to pro
vide housing."
Watson said that if University
officials do not respond with
"some common sense" at tomor
row's meeting of area residents.
Doty, and Board of Trustees
member Tom Ford, his group will
take further action. He said

Citizens for Sensible Planning
would form additional coalitions
throughout California to pass
anti-development legislation on
the state level.
"The only permanent solution
is a political one," Watson said.
He said he hoped to see the pas
sage of legislation that would re
quire regional development
agencies to control growth in
areas where more than one dis

trict is affected. The Stanford
West project affects both Palo
Alto and Menlo Park.
In the meantime, Watson said
he would like to see a building
moratorium declared on all of
Stanford's lands. "I think that
maybe Stanford's thinking has
really become distorted in all of
this," Watson said. "They
(Stanford officials) have not been
so sympathetic."

Citizens for Sensible Planning
has been fighting the University
for about 15 years over develop
ment proposals, Watson said.
In 1983 the group helped halt
the original Stanford West
housing proposal. A lawsuit filed
by the group helped lead the City
of Palo Alto to impose building
restrictions that were unaccepta
ble to the University.
