# Animal testing proponents to back University research

A national group that opposes the animal
rights movement recently formed a local chapter
in the Bay Area that has made protection of
Stanford animal research its top priority.
The organization, called Incurably 111 for
Animal Research, hopes to combat the efforts of
animal rights groups through education. "We are
here to advocate that the research that goes on in
institutions of higher learning is humane," group
member Isaac Goldman said.
According to Goldman, the local chapter's top
priority for the next six months is to keep animal
rights activists from causing further delays in the
construction of Stanford's Research Animal Fa
cility II (RAF II).
Charges made this summer by the Palo Alto
Humane Society that potentially hazardous bio

logical research might be performed in RAF II
caused the Santa Clara County Board of Super
visors Aug. 2H to delay the building's construc
tion until Stanford completes an environmental
impact report.
The national president of Incurably 111 for
Animal Research, Rick Simpson, characterized
the group as "people with a variety of incurable
illnesses that feel we must do our best to keep
animal rights from interferring with research.''
He said the activities of animal rights groups
are "directly life-threatening."
"We're delighted," said University Vice Presi
dent for Public Affairs Robert Freelen about the
creation of the local chapter. "We (the University
administration) think that is an important point
of view."
University President Donald Kennedy has long
opposed the activities of some animal rights
groups.
