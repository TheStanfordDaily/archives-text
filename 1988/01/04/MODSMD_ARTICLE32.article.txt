# Fishy odor forces evacuation
## 
### Leslie Hatamiya Staff writer 
A suspicious odor forced the
evacuation of about 300 people
from four campus science build
ings Dec. 10, but University offi
cials have determined that the
fumes were not hazardous.
The Stanford Department of
Health and Safety decided to
evacuate students and professors
from the Center for Integrated
Systems, the Applied Physics -
Gin/.ton laboratories, Hansen
laboratories and Sequoia Hall as
a precautionary measure after re
ceiving campuswide reports of an
unpleasant smell emanating from
that vicinity, according to Univer
sity Director of Health and Safety
Alain Decleve. Officials said yes
terday that they remain unsure
what caused the smell.
Ten early-morning calls report
ing a "fishy, ammonia-like

smell," came from as far away as
the Hoover Institution, said
Douglas Brown, associate direc
tor of Health and Safety.
Professors and students were
allowed back into the buildings at
1 p.m. when fire officials declared
the buildings safe after three
hours of investigation.
The University's Department
of Operations and Maintenance is
investigating the cause of the
fumes. According to Decleve, the
fumes were probably caused by a
chemical used to clean the steam
pipes of the University's new
cogeneration steam plant.
Brown speculated that the
chemical may have been a filming
amine, a chemical used to control
corrosion, in the University's new
central energy plant. The plant
now supplies the air used for
heating and air conditioning sys

tems on campus.
But University officials are not
yet sure that this is the source of
the fumes. "It's going to be diffi
cult to pinpoint the exact source,
because we don't know exactly
where to look," Decleve said.
"We may never know the
source."
Although the suspect chemical
— a derivative of ammonia com
monly used in steam plants —
may be toxic in high concentra
tions, it is "generally not consid
ered hazardous in the low con
centrations used in the steam
pipes," Brown said.
Brown said leaks of this sort
are uncommon, but noted that
problems may arise whenever a
new cogeneration steam plant
starts up.
The new plant began operating
the week before the irritating
fumes forced the evacuation.
