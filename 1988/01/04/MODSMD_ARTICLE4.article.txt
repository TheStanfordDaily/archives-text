# Roble's last moments
## Gallows humor rampant on old dorm's final night 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
On Roble's last night, students
scrawled messages on the dorm's
bulletin boards:
"It's the end of Roble as we
know it (and we feel fine)"
"Roble = Rubble"
And in a pun on the bulletin
board on the second floor of
Roble's B wing. "2B or not 28,"
the first two words were crossed
out.
Black humor was the norm
among the students who stuck
around until Roble Hall's final
night, Friday Dec. 18. One stu
dent came up with a T-shirt idea:
"A card house on the front,
and on the back the cards fallen,
with the epitaph 'Rubble '87' "
Resident Fellow Ann Porteus
said her first reaction to the deci
sion to close Roble was one of
defiance. " 'Why don't you just
let us stay until June?' I wanted to
ask the administrators. 'We'll

take our chances.' "
Porteus joked bravely about
the "Roble Refugees." She was
quick to add, however, that 'it's
important for people to move on.
We're not looking to keep Roble
alive.' It's being disbanded. But
we will have a few reunions, per
haps."
A few residents reacted to the
news by carrying off bits of Roble
memorabilia. Police officers
stopped three students that night
and retrieved a few stolen Roble
signs. None of the students were
cited, officers said.
"We wouldn't cite them. In a
situation like this you expect van
dalism But the students just want
the signs for their sentimental
value," Sgt. Earnie Brooks said
Freshman Miranda Paton said
she was the fourth generation of
her family to live in Roble and
didn't want to live anywhere else
"This place is beautiful," she
said. "But they'll probably tear it

down and build Flo Mo II." Con
tinuing about Florence Moore
Hall, she said, "Think about it:
Some architect designed it, and
someone said, 'OK. let's build
it.' " Nor did Paton speak highly
of Stern, which she called "a jail."
One of Paton's roommates said
she might transfer as a result of
the news. "Because of this dorm,
I decided, 'Stanford's OK.' " said
freshman Erica Webber "If I find
I'm unhappy (in some other
dorm), there is no reason for me
to stay where I'm unhappy ... I
may transfer."
Junior Frank Beadle, who
heads Roblc's academic advising
program, said that when he heard
of the decision to close the dorm
he "felt really sick. It was totally
destablizing."
"No one can really understand.
This was our home," he said, "I
was bubbly and jubilant about
next quarter, and then they
dropped the bomb on me."
