Israeli soldier kills woman
RAM, Israeli-occupied West Bank — An Israeli soldier shot
and killed a 25-year-old Palestinian woman in this village about
five miles north of Jerusalem yesterday, raising fears that an un
precedented wave of violence that swept through the occupied
territories last month might be reignited.
Haniya Ghazawneh became the 23rd confirmed, fatal victim of
army gunfire since the trouble began Dec. 9. Her death followed
several days of relative calm, which officials had hoped signaled
the end of the most widespread unrest since Israel captured the
West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Six-Day War.
Indicative of official concern over the potential aftermath of
yesterday's shooting, the army, in an extraordinary announce
ment issued less than three hours after the incident, said that
both the soldier involved and his commanding officer had been
suspended from duty, pending completion of a military investiga
tion.
After the shooting, youths built makeshift roadblocks from
scrap metal and burning tires and marched in protest as part of
demonstrations that lasted into yesterday evening. Security
forces finally used tear gas to disperse the protesters.
A preliminary investigation of the shooting supervised by Gen.
Amram Mitzna, the Israel Defense Forces' West Bank com
mander, "found that the IDF force did not act according to regu
lations," according to the army announcement.
Earlier, the army had said that the unidentified soldier had
fired in self-defense when he found himself in a life-threatening
situation.
However, both the later army statement and the accounts of
eyewitnesses here cast doubt on that earlier version.
Deaver dealings spotlight lobbying
WASHINGTON — The way his associates told it, Michael
Deaver was embarrassed by the checks that Trans World Airlines
kept sending each month.
It wasn't that the former White House aide didn't try to earn
the money the airline had agreed to pay his newly formed lobby
ing firm. It was just that TW A had nothing for Deaver to do.
As a result, Michael Deaver & Associates received $250,000
for making three telephone calls, sending staff members to
several planning sessions with TWA officials and attempting to
help free the airline's hijacked Boeing 737 jetliner from the
Beirut airport.
That was the sum of the firm's work for TWA, according to
testimony at Deaver's six-week trial on perjury charges. Were
TW A executives shocked or troubled? Not according to their tes
timony. Deaver, they said, had earned his pay.
Deaver's dealings with TWA, perhaps more than any of his
contracts described at the trial, provide a rare view of how high
priced lobbying works in Washington. It also illustrates how
some of the nation's largest corporations willingly — sometimes
desperately — pump millions of dollars into costly lobbying cam
paigns, often with little hope of more than bending the ear of a
key government executive.
"I'll call Elizabeth," Deaver was quoted at the trial as saying.
For TWA executives frantically seeking to thwart a takeover by
investor Carl C. Icahn, that promise — to contact then-Secretary
of Transportation Elizabeth Hanford Dole — appeared to have
been all the assurance they needed that Deaver would give them
their money's worth in Washington.
"We did everything we could here . . . everything," recalled
TWA president and chief executive officer C. Edward Meyer
during the Deaver trial. Deaver, it turned out, was just one
player in a costly "team" that the airline assembled in late May
and early June 1985 in its unsuccessful efforts to derail Icahn.
Poll says economy up despite Dow
W AS HINGTON — One of the first reports on the state of the
economy in December indicates that it expanded briskly, another
piece of evidence that the October stock market collapse has had
little impact on economic growth.
A monthly survey of purchasing managers for manufacturing
companies found faster growth in December, compared with No
vember, in both new orders and production. Robert Bretz, direc
tor of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc., said the rise in
new orders in particular foretold continued expansion.
"New orders themselves are the trigger for increased produc
tion in the future," he said. "What this portends is a relatively
strong production month for January and carrying into future
months."
The survey, done by the National Association of Purchasing
Management, is considered a reliable indicator of economic
trends because purchasing managers — more than 250 are sur
veyed each month — are in a position to watch employment, pro
duction plans, prices and inventories before those statistics are
compiled by government agencies.
Following the sharp decline in the stock market on Oct. 19,
when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points,
economists predicted that consumers would reduce their spend
ing, slowing economic output. But indications since then are that
the collapse has had less economic impact than predicted.
Retail sales in November, for instance, rose 0.2 percent, a
modest but still positive amount. And major retailers reported
that last-minute Christmas shopping exceeded their expectations,
in some cases 10 to 20 percent higher than a year before.
Congressional contra aid in flux
WASHINGTON — Last Oct. 24, when Congress voted $3.5
million in nonlethal aid to sustain Nicaraguan rebels through No
vember, House Speaker Jim Wright, (D-Tex.) said he was
"guardedly optimistic" that it would be the last U.S. aid spent on
President Reagan's controversial policy of supporting the con
tras.
But two weeks ago, Wright and other leaders of the
Democratic-controlled Congress found themselves reluctantly
agreeing to provide another $8.1 million to keep the contras in
business through February.
They acted under pressure of Reagan's threat to veto all fund
ing for the federal government's fiscal 1988 operations if the leg
islation did not contain money for the contras. A veto would have
confronted Congress with an embarrassing shutdown of the gov
ernment.
In agreeing to the short-term extension of contra funding, the
two sides scheduled for early February a "showdown" vote on
whether to continue Reagan's policy of supporting the contras'
armed struggle against Nicaragua's Marxist-led Sandinista gov
ernment.
While such showdown votes on contra aid have been cast
before, they have never resolved this long-running and bitterly
contested foreign policy dispute between the administration and
Capitol Hill Democrats.
Many times, the Democrats, as Wright did Oct. 24, have been
ready to predict the imminent demise of contra aid, only to find
the administration staging a last-minute rescue that has kept the
program intact.
