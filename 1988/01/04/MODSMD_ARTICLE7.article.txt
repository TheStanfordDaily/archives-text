# Israel to expel 9 Palestinians
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — Ignoring strong and
repeated U.S. protests, the Israeli government
yesterday ordered the expulsion of nine Pales
tinians from the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, accusing them of "incitement and
subversive activity on behalf of the terrorist
organizations."
Expulsion orders were served without trials
on the nine by instruction of Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin under provisions of a 1945
"emergency regulation," dating from the pe
riod when Britain ruled the area under a
mandate from the long-defunct League of Na
tions. The expulsions were reportedly en
dorsed at yesterday's regular meeting of the
Israeli Cabinet.
Under Israeli rules, the deportees can ap
peal their expulsion orders to an advisory
committee headed by a military court judge
and then to the Israeli High Court of Justice.
However, in the only known past instance in
which the High Court urged that an expulsion

order he reconsidered, the government
ignored the recommendation.
The expulsions follow a period of the most
widespread unrest in the occupied territories
since the Israeli army captured them in the
Six-Day War of 1967, and critics charged that
they could serve to inflame the situation once
more.
However, Lt. Col. Raanan Gissin, acting as
army spokesman, told reporters at a briefing:
"We have come to the conclusion that (the
deportees') presence outside the territories
will be more congenial to the maintenance of
public order than their presence in the ter
ritories."
The expulsion orders, which in at least three
cases involve individuals admittedly not in
volved in the recent disorders, are expected to
exacerbate U.S.-Israeli relations already
strained by what Washington considers to be
the army's excessive use of lethal force in put
ting down the disturbances.

American officials had been engaged for
several days in what were described as
"intense" contacts with Israeli counterparts
"at all kinds of levels" in hopes of heading oft
the expulsions. Washington considers the ad
ministrative expulsion of Palestinians from the
occupied territories to be a violation of due
process and of the Fourth Geneva Convention
of 1949.
That convention, which Israel has signed,
prohibits the expulsion "for any reason what
soever" of civilians from an area under mili
tary occupation.
Israel argues, however, that the Geneva
Convention was intended to outlaw mass
deportations for such purposes as forced
labor, torture or extermination. The govern
ment here contends that the rule does not bar
the expulsion of individuals or small groups
for the purpose of ensuring public order and
security.
