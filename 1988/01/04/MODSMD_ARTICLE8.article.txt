# Faculty perks face review
## Subsidies for Bohemian Club memberships are included 
### Karen Brown 
I he University will conduct a review of the
perquisites, or privileges, it awards its faculty and
administrators, including subsidies for member
ship in organizations such as the all-male
Bohemian Club, University President Donald
Kennedy said yesterday.
Clara Bush, academic secretary to the Univer
sity, said she assumes the review will begin soon.
Kennedy also said he is in the process of reply
ing to a letter sent to him shortly before winter
break by a group of 63 women faculty members,
rhe letter protested the University's policy of
subsidizing faculty and staff membership dues to
all-male organizations.
The letter, circulated by the director of Stan
lord's Institute for Research on Women and
Gender, Law Prof. Deborah Rhode, said the fac
ulty Women's Caucus believes the University
policy "offends basic values to which this Univer
sity is officially committed."
"The exclusion of women by "private clubs'
carries public consequences," the letter said. "It
perpetuates women's exclusion from social net
works that advance professional interests. And it
constitutes an affront to individuals' sense of dig
nity and self-worth.
"A university that proclaims its commitment to
equal opportunity in virtually every other sphere
of official activity should not lend its financial or
symbolic support to organizations that operate on

contrary principles," the letter continues.
Kennedy said he is writing to thank the
Women's Caucus for its letter and to inform the
organization that its views will be considered
carefully.
Bush said the decision to review the reimburse
ment policy was made at a special meeting of the
Faculty Senate steering committee held after the
end of fall quarter.
The decision to review the policy came in
"response to questions raised on the floor of the
senate at the last meeting," Bush said.
Amid campus debate about the Bohemian
Club and whether Stanford should contribute to
the membership fees of male faculty and staff
members, Kennedy told the senate in November
that the time may have arrived to review Univer
sity policy on the matter.
He said yesterday that "we did commit to a
review, but the review is not by any means
restricted to the matter of the Bohemian Club."
This, he said, is because there is concern about
the policies of other organizations for which
Stanford subsidizes administrative staff and fac
ulty memberships.
"Obviously we're going to have to review the
whole matter of subsidies for such organizations
in light of what is known about or can be known
about their policies," Kennedy said.
Bush said the University will review "the per
quisites of faculty and administrators connected
with their responsibilities to the University."
