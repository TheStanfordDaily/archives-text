## Survey indicates high use of ecstasy among students 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
More than one-third of Stan
ford undergraduates have experi
mented with "ecstasy," an illegal
drug that causes brain damage in
laboratory animals, a survey by a
Stanford neurologist has found.
The findings contrast sharply
with the results of a 1986 survey
conducted by Cowell Health Cen
ter. That survey found that 8 per
cent of undergraduates had tried
the drug and that 2 percent used
the drug more than once or twice
a month.
The more recent poll, con
ducted in May by two undergrad
uates, revealed that 143 of 369
students interviewed, or 39 per
cent, said they had tried the drug
at least once. The survey was su
pervised by Neurology Prof.
Stephen Peroutka, and the results
were published in the Dec. 10
issue of The New England Jour
nal of Medicine.
Peroutka said it is unclear
whether ecstasy, also known as
MDMA, causes permanent
damage to humans. The drug,
which is made in illegal laborato
ries, was banned in 1985 by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administra
tion.
Student Health Services Direc
tor Paul Walters, who helped
design the Cowell survey, said he
has seen no evidence of a dra
matic increase in ecstasy use and

questioned Peroutka's "unscien
tific" methodology.
Peroutka's poll was conducted
by two undergraduate research
assistants. The students stationed
themselves in White Plaza, Meyer
Library and other campus loca
tions and asked randomly selec
ted undergraduates if they had
tried ecstasy. Students who said
they had tried the drug were
asked to comment on frequency
and size of their doses and to
describe their experiences.
The Cowell survey, in which
877 students responded to a
mailed questionnaire, found that
6 percent of all students, includ
ing 2 percent of graduate stu
dents, had experimented with
ecstasy.
Walters said that researchers at
the Social Research Institute at
the University of Michigan, which
monitors drug use among college
students nationally, believe that
the 8 percent figure for under
graduates is on target. Cowell
plans to send out another survey
sometime this year, Walters said.
Ecstasy is a amphetamine-like
drug that induces euphoria and
enhances self-awareness. It is also
believed to reduce anxiety and in
hibition and increase insight,
which has led some psychiatrists
to promote its use in psycho
therapy.
"Roommates that hate each
other take ecstasy together and
become best friends," Peroutka
said in an interview last month.

"If you are skiing, the air is
crisper and the snow is whiter.
You've never skied as well in
your life, and you'll remember
your ski trip as a great time.
"It's very analogous to alcohol
as a verbal and social stimulus,"
he said. "But at the same time we
don't know if it has toxic effects."
Peroutka said ecstasy appears
to be widely used at other Cali
fornia colleges. Colleagues and
students at Marin Community
College, UC-Berkeley, UC-San
Diego and UCLA have said that
it seems plausible that about one
third of students at those schools
have tried the drug, he added.
"Last year, it became a big fad
on West Coast campuses,"
Peroutka said. "It's cheap, in
credibly easy to get, and people
like the fact that it makes them
more verbal and social."
Students who told Peroutka's
assistants that they had taken
ecstasy reported a variety of
negative side-effects, including
tenseness in their jaws, anxiety,
depression and headaches.
Peroutka said these side-effects
may indicate that the drug does
long-term damage to the brain. It
may take many years for the per
manent damage to show, he said.
It is also possible, Peroutka
said, that ecstasy could prove a
therapeutic drug if used properly.
"It's an extremely interesting
drug that may have good effects,"
he said. "But at this point, we
honestly don't know."

don't know if it has toxic effects."
Peroutka said ecstasy appears
to be widely used at other Cali
fornia colleges. Colleagues and
students at Marin Community
College, UC-Berkeley, UC-San
Diego and UCLA have said that
it seems plausible that about one
third of students at those schools
have tried the drug, he added.
"Last year, it became a big fad
on West Coast campuses,"
Peroutka said. "It's cheap, in
credibly easy to get, and people
like the fact that it makes them
more verbal and social."
Students who told Peroutka's
assistants that they had taken
ecstasy reported a variety of
negative side-effects, including
tenseness in their jaws, anxiety,
depression and headaches.
Peroutka said these side-effects
may indicate that the drug does
long-term damage to the brain. It
may take many years for the per
manent damage to show, he said.
It is also possible, Peroutka
said, that ecstasy could prove a
therapeutic drug if used properly.
"It's an extremely interesting
drug that may have good effects,"
he said. "But at this point, we
honestly don't know."
