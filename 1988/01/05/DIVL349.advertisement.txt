ASK ABOUT OUR MOVE-IN INCENTIVES
During Winter Quarter Prof. Robert B. Textor will continue
offering his "Practicum in Ethnographic Futures Research' as
Anthropology 2698 (698 for undergrads) and also as Education
2128. (See Catalog, p.245.)The Practicum provides intensive
training in an interviewing approach adapted from ethnography,
which over the years has resulted in Stanford students' sharing
authorship of a number of publications, e.g .Austria 2005:
Projected Sociocultural Effects of the Microelectronic
Revolution.
This year (and last) our project deals with alternative futures
for Stanford itself — with special reference to high technology
as a driving force. Our primary data sources are our own
professors and students, whom we have been interviewing by
eliciting their scenarios concerning what the Stanford "culture
can, might, should, or should not be like 25 years from now. So
far, the response has been superb: of the fifty persons we have
invited for interview, only one professor and one student have
declined — and most interviewees have given us more time than
we have asked for. In short, it is a friendly research situation,
and should produce a research report on some value to the
Stanford Community. All student team members will be listed
as co-authors.
The course is open to juniors, seniors, and grad students from
any major. Previous interviewing experience is not necessary.
Flexible credit arrangements are possible. If you are interested
in Stanford futures, high technology, interview and write-up
methods, cultural interpretation, education, public policy,
and/or broad-scale planning, you are welcome to find out more
about the course at our initial meeting on Wed., Jan. at 7:00
PM in the Anthropology Department, Building 110, Room 111 A.
