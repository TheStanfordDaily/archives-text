# Roble problems detected in June
## Officials say risk wasn't apparent 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
The University researcher who
was initially responsible for eval
uating Roble Hall's earthquake
safety said yesterday he knew last
spring, immediately after finding
out the date of Roble's construc
tion, that the building probably
wasn't made of reinforced con
crete, as had been believed.
"The reinforced concrete
building first became widespread
only in the 19205," said Fouad
Bendimerad, an acting assistant
professor in civil engineering who
evaluated the dorm as part of a
campuswide seismic survey begun
two years ago.
Built in 1918, Roble was closed
at the end of fall quarter due to
"an unacceptably high risk" of
collapsing in a major earthquake
and is being evacuated this week.
The major cause for the closure
was the discovery that Roble's
walls were not made of reinforced
concrete, but rather of hollow
clay tiles. Seismic experts say that
the clay tiles would not effectively
brace the building's heavy con
crete floors against possible col
lapse in the event of a high
magnitude earthquake.
John Hughes, associate vice
provost for Planning and Man
agement, said that although the
University knew as early as the
beginning of last summer that
there were some hollow clay tiles
within the exterior walls of Roble,
officials concluded at the time
that more extensive testing and
measurement of the building was
necessary because the risk was
"not considered catastrophic."
"Based on the information we
had then, we just didn't know
enough to make an accurate
assessment of the risk," Hughes
said. "At no time has the risk
been the kind of catastrophic
thing where we received one
overriding piece of information

that told us to evacuate immedi
ately."
Hughes confirmed that re
searchers from Stanford's Blume
Earthquake Engineering Center,
working as consultants for his of
fice, found clay tiles in Roble's
walls in preliminary drilling done
at the end of June.
Bendinerad, who is associated
with the Blume Center, said he
"drilled some holes on two
weekends in late June and found
clay tiles." He stressed, however,
that drilling the dormitory's walls
to determine the presence of clay
tiles was only one part of the risk
assessment procedure.
"You cannot assess a building
by checking one thing," said Ben
dimerad. "The walls may be clay
tile, but something else is holding
up the building, and we needed to
find out what that was."
Bendimerad said the lack of
structural "as-built" plans for the
building prevented him from
knowing key details, such as the
length of the clay tile columns.
After Bendimerad had worked
on developing the needed plans
through the summer, the San
Francisco engineering firm Rut
herford and Chekene took over in
September, he said. "A profes
sional firm was needed to do
more drillings, open walls and
measure rooms â€” something that
we didn't have the capacity to do
ourselves."
But before the review was com
pleted, a photograph of Roble
during its construction was found
in late November in Old Pavilion
archives that verified that the
building's exterior walls consisted
primarily of hollow clay tiles, a
conclusion Bendimerad said the
firm was about to make.
The picture was sent to Ruther
ford and Chekene, which then
told the University Dec. 1 1 that
the building was unsafe relative to

other buildings in the area with
similarly high occupancy.
Pete Stromberg, executive dep
uty director of the California
Seismic Commission, said the
University should have acted
years earlier.
Shortly after the dorm was
closed, Stromberg said that al
though there is no law requiring

retroactive seismic upgrading, "a
1918 building is pretty old. . . .
Stanford shouldn't have had a
high occupancy building like that
without closely inspecting it."
Stromberg, a seismic safety
specialist with the independent
state agency that reports to the
legislature, said any building that
regularly holds over 100 people
should be considered high oc
cupancy. Nearly 300 people lived
in Roble.
"It's irresponsible. Certainly
something should have been done
about that building a long time
ago," he said.
