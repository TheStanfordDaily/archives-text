# Rain forest program praised
## Costa Rica may participate in Stanford preservation plan 
### My Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Costa Rican government offi
cials who recently visited Stan
ford praised the University's
participation in an innovative
program to preserve Latin
American rain forests and said
their country is interested in
participating in the program.
Calling the rain forest pre
servation project "aggressive
and progressive," Alvaro
Umana Quesada, the Costa
Rican minister of natural re
sources, energy and mines, em
phasized the importance of
preserving the world's rain
forests.
"Our future lies in the pre
servation of these areas," said
Quesada, who earned a doc
torate in environmental engi
neering at Stanford in 1979.
Quesada spoke at a Dec. 10
press conference here in which
the Stanford Center for Conser
vation Biology and the Wash
ington D C.-based Conserva
tion International formally an
nounced their joint plan to
preserve tropical rain forests in
Latin America and the Carib
bean.
Under the plan. Conservation
International buys portions of
Third World countries' interna
tional debts in exchange for the
preservation and protection of
vast tracts of endangered rain
forests in those countries.
Bolivia is the first country to
take part in the program, and
organizers hope other

countries, like Costa Rica, will
join the program.
Stanford will provide the ex
pertise and "technical back-up"
for Conservation International,
according to Stanford Biology
Prd Paul Ehrlich. Erlich is the
current director of the Center
for Conservation Biology,
which he helped establish in
1985.

'Instead of going and
doing it blindly, we will
try to take a good hard
look at how that region
can be best preserved
and aid in the
developement of that
country.'

Prof. Paul Ehrlich

I he Stanford center will sur
pervise the technical aspects of
the program through educa
tional exchange between the
University and the countries in
volved. Latin American stu
dents and professionals will
receive academic and research
training here, and Stanford stu
dents and professors will pro
vide direct assistance in building
other programs for long-term
resource protection.
Ehrlich said Stanford's role is

important because it enables
technology generated in the ac
ademic world to be transfered
to those working on conserva
tion problems. "Instead of
going ahead and doing it
blindly, we will try to take a
good hard look at how that
region can be best preserved
and aid in the development of
that country," Ehrlich said.
The first area to be targeted is
the Amazonian region of the 4
million-acre Beni Reserve of
Bolivia, where Conservation In
ternational implemented the
first-ever "debt for nature"
conservation agreement.
During this five-year conser
vation plan, the University will
assist local governments and
non-government organizations
in the design and management
of various park, watershed, tim
berland, farming/ranching and
biosphere components of the
reserve.
In addition, Stanford will
help implement information
management systems, conduct
scientific research and help
develop an environmental
studies curriculum for Bolivian
schools.
Several other countries in
Latin America have expressed
interest in the Stanford-
Conservation International col
laboration, including Costa
Rica. Rodrigo Gamez Lobo,
who is vice president of the Or
ganization of Tropical Studies
in Costa Rica and a university
professor in that country,
visited Stanford with Quesada.
