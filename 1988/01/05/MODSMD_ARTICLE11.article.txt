# Old Pavilion will return as campus athletic facility
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
The Stanford Board of Trus
tees has approved a plan that
would convert the Old Pavilion
back to an athletic facility "in
time for school in '91," according
to Curtis Williams, director of
Facilities Project Management.
According to Project Manager
Shirley Chen, plans are being
made to construct two new office
buildings in the Serra Triangle, a
parking area just east of the Old
Pavilion. One of the buildings will
accommodate workers from the
Stanford Personnel and Facilities
Project Management depart
ments, who currently use the Old
Pavilion.
The privately contracted proj
ect will be funded partly by an
anonymous donor who is also in
volved in the planning. The net
cost to the University is estimated

at $7.7 million and will be funded
by long-term debt, in which the
University makes annual pay
ments on the debt as part of its
operating budget.
The Old Pavilion will be refur
bished after the construction of
the new office complex and the
relocation of the workers.
Williams said construction
should begin in late February to
early March. He added that he
expects the buildings to be com
pleted "in about a year."
Chen said the other building
would be used by workers from
the Business Finance Depart
ment, the Comptroller's Office
and the Office of Technical
Licensing. Those offices are pres
ently located in the basement and
first floor of Encina Hall and in
leased offices on Cambridge Ave
nue in Palo Alto.
Williams said the project is now
being designed and that the Uni
versity is "getting the necessary

permits from the county." He
added that the designs for the Old
Pavilion conversion will be done
while the Serra Triangle office
buildings are under construction.
The trustees, meeting Dec. 8,
also approved the construction of
a new Medical School Laboratory
Surge Building. The $15 million
project will provide 30,000
square feet of basic laboratory
facilities.
Ron Goben, associate director
of the Medical School Office of
Communications, said the project
is now in the planning stage and is
part of a University initiative to
improve the Medical School's
clinical academic programs.
He said the school has had to
"juggle (lab) space needs
around" and the new laboratory
will provide "more flexibility."
Goben added that the ex
panded facilities will also help at
tract new faculty to the school.
