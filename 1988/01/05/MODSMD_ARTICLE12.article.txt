## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper A 						New Year's agenda 
### 
To the wide-eyed tourists who stroll around
campus behind those ever-eager student tour
guides, Stanford probably looks a lot like
paradise. As these awestruck visitors lap up the
sun, sandstone and beautiful people, bright-eyed
guides tell them about such things as Stanford's
world-reknowned faculty, its ambitious new Near
West science complex and its $1.1 billion fund
raising campaign — the largest ever undertaken
by any university.
To be sure, Stanford's weather, its palm trees
and its multi-million dollar endowment are im
pressive. And of course the brilliant professors
and interesting students do make this university
one of the best in the country.
Still, as we enter the new year, a host of prickly
problems and embarrassing weaknesses continue
to nag at Stanford's greatness. Particularly in the
area of student services, University leaders have
shown an alarming reluctance to take positive ac
tion.
What follows is a suggested New Year's agenda
for the University administration. These 10 issues
were particularity pressing problems in 1987, and
they cry out for solutions in 1988.
Housing: Even before the sudden closing of
Roble Hall last month, the woeful shortage of on
campus housing facilities was an unacceptable
obstacle to student comfort and well-being. Now,
with displaced Roble residents hurriedly seeking
shelter in makeshift nooks and crannies all over
campus, the immediate construction of at least
one new dorm complex is imperative. Off
campus housing is hard to find and hard to afford
— and of course, getting to and from classes with
out a car can sometimes be all but impossible.
With thousands of acres of empty land and one
of the largest university endowments in the na
tion, Stanford can certainly afford both the space
and the expense of this much-needed innovation.
Western Culture: The Western Culture Task
Force set out last year to accomplish a thorough
overhaul of the University's ethnically narrow
Western Culture program. Controversy and com
promise so weakened the panel's resolve,
however, that it issued a toothless proposal that
will in all likelihood effect very little change.
The Faculty Senate, which will meet later this
month to discuss the task force recommenda
tions, should reject the proposal in its present
form and take steps to redraft the document into
an enforceable policy — a policy able to effect
and sustain greater cultural diversity in Western
Culture courses.
Minority Faculty: Spurred on by strong protest
from members of Stanford's ethnic community,
the University this fall created a special commis
sion to review the problem of institutional racism
at Stanford. This is an encouraging, albeit long
overdue, first step. The University must follow it
up, however, with a sincere and aggressive effort
to draw more than the current token representa
tion of minorities on its faculty.
Academic Balance: A problem that deserves
careful attention in 1988 and in years ahead is the
growing polarization of Stanford students and
faculty into scientific and humanistic camps. The
increasing complexity and specialization of scien
tific disciplines demand that students in the
sciences spend more and more time studying ex
clusively scientific subjects. Likewise, students in
the humanities and social sciences rarely venture
into any but the most fundamental of science
courses.
The University currently does very little to en
courage cross-disciplinary awareness. If Stanford
is ever to bridge the the widening gap of under
standing between scientists and humanists, it
must take action to greatly expand its currently
weak and largely symbolic system of distribution
requirements.

Overseas Studies: Despite a recent blaze of ex
pansion, Stanford's overseas studies program
remains plagued by serious shortcomings. Unfor
tunately, the curricula at many of the University's
overseas campuses remain embarrassingly weak
(Turning a quarter overseas into a European
tour-with-credit is regrettably easy to do.). Also,
Stanford's overseas programs often unintention
ally encourage visiting students and faculty to
remain cocooned amongst themselves — apart
from the culture around them.
A good way to begin addressing these prob
lems would be to phase out Stanford's tradition
ally isolated "villa" approach to foreign study.
Direct exchanges with universities abroad,
facilitated by Stanford, would be a much better
way to provide students with meaningful expo
sure to foreign cultures.
Libraries: A university's library is perhaps its
single greatest asset. Without comprehensive and
easy-to-use library facilities, effective scholarship
can come grinding to a halt. Unfortunately,
despite their extensive holdings, Stanford's libra
ries lack the resources to serve the University
community as well as they should. Budgetary
constraints limit the number of hours the libraries
can remain open and have slowed the pace with
which library holdings are entered into
SOCRATES, the University's computerized
card-catalogue. Electronic checkout, now stan
dard at most large libraries, is not expected to be
installed here at Stanford for at least several
more years.
Given their central importance to the Univer
sity, Stanford's libraries deserve much more sup
port than they have been getting.
Tenure Policy: In its understandable rush to ac
quire top-flight scholars, Stanford runs the risk of
forgetting the importance of good teaching. In
the publish-or-perish climate of modern
academia, young scholars here and elsewhere are
under much more pressure to produce
pathbreaking scholarship than they are to
produce enlightened students. Stature as a
scholar, rather than skill as a teacher, generally
determines who gets hired and who gets
promoted. To counterbalance this trend, the Uni
versity should make a strong effort in the coming
year to identify and attract exceptional teachers.
Fraternity Rush: Last spring's tragic alcohol
related drowning death of Zeta Theta Psi Rush
chairman David Dunshee underscores the need
for a substantial overhaul of the Fraternity Rush
system. The partially dry Rush held last year
demonstrated that fraternity functions are indeed
possible without the help of alcohol; and the
death of David Dunshee demonstrated that
partly dry is sadly not dry enough. If the Interfra
ternity Council does not voluntarily implement a
dry Rush this spring, the University should
mandate it.
Tresidder: Stanford's student union is an em
barrassment. Awkwardly designed, Tresidder
Union is sorely lacking in both student facilities
and atmosphere. Plans to thoroughly overhaul
the union have been languishing in the planning
stages for several years. It's time to stop procras
tinating: Either the University should replace
Tresidder or it should invest the time and money
to make it a student union we can use and be
proud of.
Athletic Facilities: The University last year un
veiled plans for a substantial new student athletic
center. Unfortunately, however, the new facility
will net be completed until the early 19905.
Much needs to be done in the interim. Cur
rently, most of the best athletic facilities are used
almost solely by varsity athletes. Those that are
open to the general student body are often
second-rate. For what Stanford students pay in
tuition each year, it seems fair to expect just a
little bit better.
