## Corporate America kills individuality 
### 
During winter and spring quarters, many of
the top corporations in America come to
Stanford and recruit diligent young men and
women for jobs. I would like to convey some
ideas about the consequences of entering cor
porate America.

Ugo Colella

Those who enter into corporate America
are trained not to do what they like, but to do
what the corporation demands. Executives,
supervisors, managers and officials are the
"trainers" who teach us to despise what we
like in order to make us more obedient ser
vants of the corporation â€” real good slaves.
Only when you learn not to do what you like
will the corporation love you. The conse
quence. therefore, is that no one becomes
willing to take on the gutsy task of questioning
that system, and ultimately people stop think
ing for themselves.
For example, people arrive at a job and per
form a sometimes meaningless task from 8
a.m. to 5 p.m. without question because the
corporate structure demands that it be that
way. There is no "bad guy" who wants them
to live meaningless lives. It is just the
structure, the system, that demands it. In es
sence, many business organizations direct
thought for the perpetuation of their own
functions and for the control of the individuals
who service these functions.

Secondly, a divided reality between the
worker and the corporate system emerges. If
corporate growth is to occur, this separation
must remain rigidly in place: You are the
worker; you obey the system; you do this,
then you do that; these will be the results.
This dualistic character of corporate
America sounds right to us because we are
used to it. But it is not right. It has always
been an unreal interpretation superimposed
on reality. When this duality is accepted, a
certain nondivided relationship between the
worker and his job, a craftsmanlike feeling for
work, is destroyed.
The real ugliness in corporate America
therefore lies in the relationship between the
people who produce technology and the
things they produce. The creator of the prod
uct feels no particular sense of identity with it,
the owner of it feels no particular sense of
identity with it, and the user of it feels no par
ticular sense of identity with it.
Thirdly, we all know that in each job there
is a beautiful way of doing things and an ugly
way of doing things, and in arriving at the
high-quality, beautiful way of doing it, both an
ability to see what "looks good" and an ability
to understand the underlying methods to
arrive at that "good" are needed. However,
corporations often instruct one to follow cer
tain rules with the presumption that once
these rules are followed, "good" will naturally
follow. Clearly, the ability to directly see what
"looks good" is flatly ignored and never
developed.

Ultimately, corporate America produces in
dividuals with an overall dullness of appear
ance and character so depressing that it must
he covered up with dollars and "style" to
make it acceptable. Not only is it depressingly
dull, but it is also phony.
Indeed, if you put the two together you get
an accurate picture of 1988 America that was
described by Robert Pirsig nearly 14 years
ago: "Stylized cars and stylized outboard
motors and stylized computers and stylized
clothes. Stylized refrigerators filled with
stylized food in stylized kitchens in stylized
houses. Plastic stylized toys for stylized
children, who at Christmas and birthdays are
in style with their stylish parents. You have to
be awfully stylish yourself not to get sick of it
once in a while."
Finally, the way to avoid all of this is to ac
cept jobs from companies that attempt to
break down the barriers of dualistic thought
which prevent a real understanding of what
human relations are. Do not be attracted to a
structured, rule-following corporation.
Instead, try to be part of a company that
strives to fuse the employee and employer
into a new kind of relationship that transcends
both. When this transcendence occurs, a kind
of public recognition of the transcendent na
ture of human relations occurs. But this tran
scendence should also occur at the individual,
personal level in one's own life.
