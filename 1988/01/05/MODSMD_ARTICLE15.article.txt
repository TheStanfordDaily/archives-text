Recently, we have heard a lot of debate concern
ing the question of American competitiveness in the
world economy, especially compared with Japan.
Many people blame unfair Japanese trading
practices for the trade deficit. Others blame Ameri
can industry. We don't produce enough, either be
cause our industries are too poorly run or our
workers don't work hard enough, or because Amer
ican salaries are too high in general. There is some
truth to all of these reasons. However, too little con
sideration is given to another cause.

In Japanese business, the first priority is produc
ing and selling goods. In contrast, American busi
nessmen spend much time and effort worrying
about acquiring other companies, or being acquired,
or suing or being sued, or other complex financial
deals. Too often, basic production is neglected.
It is thought that second-rate people go into man
ufacturing, while Stanford's best are pulled into in
vestment banking or law. There they spend their
time reshuffling money instead of creating new
goods. Although Shakespeare's solution — "The
first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers" — is per
haps too harsh, far too many Americans work in
these unproductive fields. Per capita, we have 10
times as many lawyers as Japan, as well as far more
investment bankers and stockbrokers. In Japan,
profits are made by building better, cheaper prod
ucts, rather than by paper shuffling.
Making American society more competitive is a
difficult, complex problem. Part of the problem
stems from the structure of modern America, part
comes from our laws, and the rest comes from a va
riety of causes. Since it is very difficult to change
how people think, the easiest way to start is by
changing some laws. If corporate acquisitions, land
sales and lawsuits were less profitable, there would
be less incentive for them.
One way to attack the problem is by restructuring
the tax system. If a sales tax were levied on sales of
corporations or parts of corporations, then corpo
rate acquisitions would become less profitable and
less frequent. As the volume of transfers dropped,
investment banking would become less lucrative,
and investment bankers would begin to go into
other fields. Corporations could pay more attention
to production and less to maneuvering.
Although I have highlighted corporate acquisi

tions, many other types of high finance are just as
unproductive. Repeated sales of the same land are
one example, as is the futures market. There are
many others. Our tax laws need to be changed to
reduce the profitability of all of these types of trans
actions.
Another common paper shuffle that produces
nothing is a lawsuit. While some lawsuits are good
for society, most are not. And, justified or not, they
are too lucrative. A few years ago Penzoil sued
Texaco for $10 billion, roughly equivalent to
Texaco's total worth. The suit was recently settled
for $3.5 billion. Texaco was forced to settle because
the suit was completely disrupting the company.
Court-imposed financial restraints drove the com
pany into temporary bankruptcy, and the Texaco
management was wasting all of its time dealing with
the lawsuit. The final legal bill will be in the range of
$60-100 million, and none of this produced one
drop more oil.
Both corporate and private America are becom
ing more and more inclined to file lawsuits. When
something bad happens, people react with, "Who
can I sue?" Unfortunately, this is a rational reac
tion. because lawsuits are often very profitable.
And, since the amount of money that lawyers make
is directly proportional to the length of the lawsuits,
lawyers have a financial incentive to let the suits
drag on as long as possible. The way to proceed
seems to be by making lawsuits less profitable.
In some cases, changes in the laws would help.
Elimination of legal "deep pockets" would help, a
corporation that is 5 percent at fault for an accident
should not have to pay 100 percent of the damages.
Something should also be done to limit the length
and complexity of suits, perhaps by making the ap
peals process less attractive.
Finally, people serving as jurors need to realize
that large judgments cost us all money. While large
awards are sometimes merited, they also encourage
people to engage in more lawsuits. These lawsuits
are a drain on all of society. We pay the direct costs
of judge, jury and courtroom, as well as the indirect
costs of supporting lawyers on both sides. If juries
and judges were more careful with the defendants'
money, fewer speculative lawsuits would be filed.
The federal government is responsible for part of
the problem. Many federal regulations and report
ing requirements are still far too complicated. One
good example is our federal income tax forms.
Complicated Internal Revenue Service forms force
people to hire accountants and tax preparers, con
tributing to the paper-pusher overload.
These problems are difficult ones to solve.
However, we must solve them if we are to become
competitive again in the world market.

Recently, we have heard a lot of debate concern
ing the question of American competitiveness in the
world economy, especially compared with Japan.
Many people blame unfair Japanese trading
practices for the trade deficit. Others blame Ameri
can industry. We don't produce enough, either be
cause our industries are too poorly run or our
workers don't work hard enough, or because Amer
ican salaries are too high in general. There is some
truth to all of these reasons. However, too little con
sideration is given to another cause.

In Japanese business, the first priority is produc
ing and selling goods. In contrast, American busi
nessmen spend much time and effort worrying
about acquiring other companies, or being acquired,
or suing or being sued, or other complex financial
deals. Too often, basic production is neglected.
It is thought that second-rate people go into man
ufacturing, while Stanford's best are pulled into in
vestment banking or law. There they spend their
time reshuffling money instead of creating new
goods. Although Shakespeare's solution — "The
first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers" — is per
haps too harsh, far too many Americans work in
these unproductive fields. Per capita, we have 10
times as many lawyers as Japan, as well as far more
investment bankers and stockbrokers. In Japan,
profits are made by building better, cheaper prod
ucts, rather than by paper shuffling.
Making American society more competitive is a
difficult, complex problem. Part of the problem
stems from the structure of modern America, part
comes from our laws, and the rest comes from a va
riety of causes. Since it is very difficult to change
how people think, the easiest way to start is by
changing some laws. If corporate acquisitions, land
sales and lawsuits were less profitable, there would
be less incentive for them.
One way to attack the problem is by restructuring
the tax system. If a sales tax were levied on sales of
corporations or parts of corporations, then corpo
rate acquisitions would become less profitable and
less frequent. As the volume of transfers dropped,
investment banking would become less lucrative,
and investment bankers would begin to go into
other fields. Corporations could pay more attention
to production and less to maneuvering.
Although I have highlighted corporate acquisi

tions, many other types of high finance are just as
unproductive. Repeated sales of the same land are
one example, as is the futures market. There are
many others. Our tax laws need to be changed to
reduce the profitability of all of these types of trans
actions.
Another common paper shuffle that produces
nothing is a lawsuit. While some lawsuits are good
for society, most are not. And, justified or not, they
are too lucrative. A few years ago Penzoil sued
Texaco for $10 billion, roughly equivalent to
Texaco's total worth. The suit was recently settled
for $3.5 billion. Texaco was forced to settle because
the suit was completely disrupting the company.
Court-imposed financial restraints drove the com
pany into temporary bankruptcy, and the Texaco
management was wasting all of its time dealing with
the lawsuit. The final legal bill will be in the range of
$60-100 million, and none of this produced one
drop more oil.
