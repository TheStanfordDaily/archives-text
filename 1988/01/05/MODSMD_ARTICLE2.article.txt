# Roble residents take move in stride

### Russell korobkin Editorial staff 
The mood of former Roble res
idents and other students incon
venienced by the closing of Stan
ford's largest dorm was generally
upbeat and optimistic yesterday
as they scrambled to adapt to new
circumstances.
Roble's 104 freshmen began
moving into new permanent
residences yesterday. They were
assigned by Roble resident assis
tants and a Residential Education
staff team to newly created spaces
made from guest rooms, study
rooms, seminar rooms, computer
rooms and libraries in all
freshmen and four-class dorms.
Upperclassmen received tem
porary housing assignments
pending tonight's mini-draw,
which will place them in newly
created spaces and in already

occupied rooms as extra
roommates for the remainder of
the year.
Most freshmen seemed more
concerned with whom they would
be rooming than where they
would he placed.
"Our main concern was staying
together, so we're happy," said
freshman Joann Wong, who,
along with her three Roble
roommates, was placed in the
Branner Hall guest room. To
Wong, the outlook is much better
than it was during winter break,
when she said she had nightmares
about where she and her
roommates might end up.
Kevin Malloy also said his new
living arrangement is better than
he expected. He and six friends
from his wing of Roble were
placed together in the Otero
House Red Carpet Annex, a
small building physically

separated from the rest of the
dorm with two bedrooms, a large
living area and a bathroom that is
probably larger than some
doubles on campus.
One of his new roommates,
Christopher Mosby, said he was
extremely depressed when he was
informed by a roommate about
the Roble closing during break,
primarily because he feared being
split up from his friends.
Malloy said that his group
received one of the best arrange
ments, which causes him to feel
"a little guilty," since some of his
good friends have found them
selves in much worse circum
stances.
Both Malloy and Wong said
they had requested certain
roommates and were happy that
those requests had been honored.
Malloy, Mosby and Wong were
placed in extremely good ac

comodations in comparison with
many other displaced students
who seemed, however, equally
good-humored.
Jon Fieldman found himself in
a Cedro House study room, now a
quad. "We're coping. It's not the
ideal situation, but it's no one's
fault, so we're just dealing the
best we can," he said.
Fieldman's room looks spa
cious with skeleton furnishings —
two bunk beds — but quarters
will be tight when desks and
closets are delivered, probably
later this week. "It's going to be a
claustrophobic's nightmare," he
said, adding that the Wilbur
facilities supervisor suggested
they might want to keep only two
desks.

Fieldman's back window for
