# Roble residents take move in stride
## 
### Russell korobkin Editorial staff 
The mood of former Roble res
idents and other students incon
venienced by the closing of Stan
ford's largest dorm was generally
upbeat and optimistic yesterday
as they scrambled to adapt to new
circumstances.
Roble's 104 freshmen began
moving into new permanent
residences yesterday. They were
assigned by Roble resident assis
tants and a Residential Education
staff team to newly created spaces
made from guest rooms, study
rooms, seminar rooms, computer
rooms and libraries in all
freshmen and four-class dorms.
Upperclassmen received tem
porary housing assignments
pending tonight's mini-draw,
which will place them in newly
created spaces and in already

occupied rooms as extra
roommates for the remainder of
the year.
Most freshmen seemed more
concerned with whom they would
be rooming than where they
would he placed.
"Our main concern was staying
together, so we're happy," said
freshman Joann Wong, who,
along with her three Roble
roommates, was placed in the
Branner Hall guest room. To
Wong, the outlook is much better
than it was during winter break,
when she said she had nightmares
about where she and her
roommates might end up.
Kevin Malloy also said his new
living arrangement is better than
he expected. He and six friends
from his wing of Roble were
placed together in the Otero
House Red Carpet Annex, a
small building physically

separated from the rest of the
dorm with two bedrooms, a large
living area and a bathroom that is
probably larger than some
doubles on campus.
One of his new roommates,
Christopher Mosby, said he was
extremely depressed when he was
informed by a roommate about
the Roble closing during break,
primarily because he feared being
split up from his friends.
Malloy said that his group
received one of the best arrange
ments, which causes him to feel
"a little guilty," since some of his
good friends have found them
selves in much worse circum
stances.
Both Malloy and Wong said
they had requested certain
roommates and were happy that
those requests had been honored.
Malloy, Mosby and Wong were
placed in extremely good ac

comodations in comparison with
many other displaced students
who seemed, however, equally
good-humored.
Jon Fieldman found himself in
a Cedro House study room, now a
quad. "We're coping. It's not the
ideal situation, but it's no one's
fault, so we're just dealing the
best we can," he said.
Fieldman's room looks spa
cious with skeleton furnishings —
two bunk beds — but quarters
will be tight when desks and
closets are delivered, probably
later this week. "It's going to be a
claustrophobic's nightmare," he
said, adding that the Wilbur
facilities supervisor suggested
they might want to keep only two
desks.
A sheet has been placed over
Fieldman's back window for
privacy.
Fieldman said he was in a state
of "disbelief" when he first heard
Roble would be shut down, but
he didn't show it yesterday. "Like
everything else there are pros and
cons," he said, referring to his op
portunity to meet new people.
Sophomore Joe Corbo is living
in Lathrop House until tonight's
draw determines his permanent
fate. Corbo also seemed unper
turbed by his tenuous situation.
Although he admitted he would
rather be in Roble in his "big,
spacious single," he said he is
"seeing a lot of advantages —
meeting new people is one of
them."
Corbo said he doesn't think
many of the displaced Roble resi
dents are too upset, a sentiment
echoed by Fieldman. "Everyone
is coping the best that they can,"
Fieldman said.
Despite generally high spirits,
not all Roble residents were in
equally good moods. Sophomore
Nina Ronstadt is taking the move
somewhat harder than Corbo.
Ronstadt said she heard
Thursday, Dec. 17, that Roble
would not open for winter quarter
when a neighbor came into her
room crying with the news. She
said she cried also and stayed up
all night even though she had a
final th<M"ollowing morning.
All the displaced Roble resi
dents interviewed yesterday

praised the University's efforts to
accommodate them after the
closing of their dorm.
"Stanford did a hell of a job,"
Fieldman said. He was especially
impressed that University-hired
movers had transported his
belongings to his new residence
within two hours after he had
finished packing.
"They (University officials) are

really kissing up to us," Corbo
said.
Manzanita Park and Row resi
dents who will have to accommo
date new roommates also seemed
upbeat yesterday.
"That's just life," said sopho
more Traunza Adams of Lathrop
House, who will soon have a third
roommate in her double. "When
I first found out I was very upset.

But you have to think of people
besides yourself sometimes."
Colm Callen, a sophomore in
Manzanita, seemed more upset
about living in Manzanita than
about gaining a roommate. He
said he has plenty of space but
will feel bad for whomever moves
in after tonight's draw. "Look
around. Would you want to live in
this place?" he asked.
