;hoping your vacation was as fun

and relaxing as mine and that
you're back bright and fresh and
ready to tackle classes with the

As is my family's tradition, we
went to a small Middle Eastern

two camels and a second-round

you how great my vacation was.
The reason I can't tell you how
great my vacation was is because I

through the magic of technology I
am actually writing this on Dec.

Dear Bug,
I've noticed that the cashiers at
the Stanford Bookstore typically
won't accept Stanford fac
ulty /staff ID cards as identifica
tion when you want to pay by
check, although they will accept
student ID cards. Why is this? Do
they think faculty and staff mem
bers are more likely to pass bad
checks than students?
- University Employee
Let us consider, for a moment,
what a faculty/staff ID card actu
ally proves. . . . Basically, it
proves that the holder of the card
exists. Except when shopping in
existential bookstores, existence
in no way proves that you have a
line of credit worth your under
wear.
Back in the good old days when

Stanford was a small, close-knit
community and the faculty could
be trusted, the Bookstore would
accept faculty/staff IDs because
everyone on campus had a
familiar face. (The post office is
next door .... They've got those
portraits . . . aw, forget it.) Now,
with this huge, conglomerate,
multinational research university
and delicatessen, the bookstore
folks can no longer trust any old
yahoo who walks in off the street
with a faculty/staff ID card and
wants to write a check to pay for
57 "Women of Stanford" calen
dars.
Some faculty — particularly
professors — become known
around the Bookstore after a
while, in which case they are per
fectly welcome to use their fac
ulty/staff IDs. Although, come to
think of it, if they're already
known, why do they need an ID
at all? Faculty/staff can also apply

for a courtesy card, which basi
cally gives them the courtesy of
parting with their money faster.
Which brings us to the stu
dents. Why is it that I can't pay by
check in most department stores
without eight picture IDs and
four major credit cards but can
waltz into the Bookstore and
write an out-of-state check for
300 smackers using my student
ID and a driver's license?
Can you say "Registration
hold"?
Yes, that's right, the power of
the registrar looms over your
credit line even as we speak. If a
student should happen to pass a
bad check at the Bookstore, the
registrar is notified, and immedi
ately a hold is placed on the guilty
student's registration. For those
of you who have never suffered
the consequences of a registration


BUG
ME

hold, let's just say it's not worth
the risk of having a check bounce.
To remove a hold from your reg
istration, you must either:
• clear up the problem (i.e.,
pay the Bookstore),
• beg and plead and stand in
line for several weeks at Old Un
ion, or
• attend traffic school.
However, this is a minor price
to pay for the convenience of
being able to cash out-of-state
checks without having a major
credit card. Come to think of it, if
I had an American Express Gold
Card or something I probably
wouldn't need to be studying here
in the first place.
The answer to the question is:
You can't use a faculty/staff ID
card because there is no guaran
tee that you won't buy $4000
worth of inflatable dinosaurs and
then leave the country before the
check bounces.
Dear Hug,
Why do men wear ties? They
are such strange articles of cloth
ing and just dangle there, conjur
ing up all these strange connota
tions.
- Birthday Suit Box

Of course, any discussion of
men's neckwear brings up the
considerable moral question of
whether it is correct for men to be
able to breathe. Historically, the
answer has been no.
Prior to the 17th century, men
wore stocks around their necks
instead of ties. Nowadays, of
course, men tie ropes around
their necks because of stocks.
Stocks were thick pieces of cloth
wrapped tightly around the collar
of a shirt and fastened in back.
Imagine tying a tie around your
neck, knotting it in back and cut
ting off the end: That's a stock.
Stocks added balance to costumes
of the day and forced men to keep
their heads up or risk choking to
death. You wonder why nobody
smiles in those old paintings?
Suddenly, in the 17th century,
those leaders in fashion, the
French, adopted the foreign
Croatian neckpieces known as
cravats. A cravat was a long piece
of cloth wrapped and knotted
around the neck and allowed to
hang in front.
Throughout the ensuing cen
turies, cravats evolved to include
many colors, lengths and widths.
Also, new knots such as the
Windsor, Hangman and Sheep
shank were invented to ensure
that men would not breathe, re
gardless of style. The cravat fash

ion spread rapidly to the United
States, as did my grandparents.
According to "Collars . . .
Stocks . . . Cravats. A History and
Costume Dating Guide to Civil
ian Men's Neckpieces, 1655-
1900,'' by Doriece Colle (I swear
this is a real book), by 1865 the
tie was no longer a necessary part
of the costume, but simply an ac
cessory.
I would be remiss if I did not
include a few tips on how to pur
chase and use ties.
Choosing your width: Your tie
is too wide if a) You need not
wear a shirt under it to hide your
chest, or b) It is equilateral.
Choosing color: Power colors:
yellow, bright red, pink. Very
powerful colors: flaming (actually
on fire), purple (with little Prince
figures), dark black. Colors that
say, "I am a wimp": clear, flesh
(unless made out of actual tlesh),
glow-in-the-dark.
How to determine proper tie
length: Hang the tie from the tip
of your nose. If the end of the tie
reaches your kneecaps and the
temperature is green, then your
second life is grazing on moon
beams and the tie is completely
jealous.
Alternate method: It doesn't
matter, you'll still get it in your
soup.

Dear Bug,
I've noticed that the cashiers at
the Stanford Bookstore typically
won't accept Stanford fac
ulty /staff ID cards as identifica
tion when you want to pay by
check, although they will accept
student ID cards. Why is this? Do
they think faculty and staff mem
bers are more likely to pass bad
checks than students?
- University Employee
Let us consider, for a moment,
what a faculty/staff ID card actu
ally proves. . . . Basically, it
proves that the holder of the card
exists. Except when shopping in
existential bookstores, existence
in no way proves that you have a
line of credit worth your under
wear.
Back in the good old days when

Stanford was a small, close-knit
community and the faculty could
be trusted, the Bookstore would
accept faculty/staff IDs because
everyone on campus had a
familiar face. (The post office is
next door .... They've got those
portraits . . . aw, forget it.) Now,
with this huge, conglomerate,
multinational research university
and delicatessen, the bookstore
folks can no longer trust any old
yahoo who walks in off the street
with a faculty/staff ID card and
wants to write a check to pay for
57 "Women of Stanford" calen
dars.
Some faculty — particularly
professors — become known
around the Bookstore after a
while, in which case they are per
fectly welcome to use their fac
ulty/staff IDs. Although, come to
think of it, if they're already
known, why do they need an ID
at all? Faculty/staff can also apply

for a courtesy card, which basi
cally gives them the courtesy of
parting with their money faster.
Which brings us to the stu
dents. Why is it that I can't pay by
check in most department stores
without eight picture IDs and
four major credit cards but can
waltz into the Bookstore and
write an out-of-state check for
300 smackers using my student
ID and a driver's license?
Can you say "Registration
hold"?
Yes, that's right, the power of
the registrar looms over your
credit line even as we speak. If a
student should happen to pass a
bad check at the Bookstore, the
registrar is notified, and immedi
ately a hold is placed on the guilty
student's registration. For those
of you who have never suffered
the consequences of a registration


BUG
ME

hold, let's just say it's not worth
the risk of having a check bounce.
To remove a hold from your reg
istration, you must either:
• clear up the problem (i.e.,
pay the Bookstore),
• beg and plead and stand in
line for several weeks at Old Un
ion, or
• attend traffic school.
However, this is a minor price
to pay for the convenience of
being able to cash out-of-state
checks without having a major
credit card. Come to think of it, if
I had an American Express Gold
Card or something I probably
wouldn't need to be studying here
in the first place.
The answer to the question is:
You can't use a faculty/staff ID
card because there is no guaran
tee that you won't buy $4000
worth of inflatable dinosaurs and
then leave the country before the
check bounces.
Dear Hug,
Why do men wear ties? They
are such strange articles of cloth
ing and just dangle there, conjur
ing up all these strange connota
tions.
- Birthday Suit Box

Of course, any discussion of
men's neckwear brings up the
considerable moral question of
whether it is correct for men to be
able to breathe. Historically, the
answer has been no.
Prior to the 17th century, men
wore stocks around their necks
instead of ties. Nowadays, of
course, men tie ropes around
their necks because of stocks.
Stocks were thick pieces of cloth
wrapped tightly around the collar
of a shirt and fastened in back.
Imagine tying a tie around your
neck, knotting it in back and cut
ting off the end: That's a stock.
Stocks added balance to costumes
of the day and forced men to keep
their heads up or risk choking to
death. You wonder why nobody
smiles in those old paintings?
Suddenly, in the 17th century,
those leaders in fashion, the
French, adopted the foreign
Croatian neckpieces known as
cravats. A cravat was a long piece
of cloth wrapped and knotted
around the neck and allowed to
hang in front.
Throughout the ensuing cen
turies, cravats evolved to include
many colors, lengths and widths.
Also, new knots such as the
Windsor, Hangman and Sheep
shank were invented to ensure
that men would not breathe, re
gardless of style. The cravat fash

ion spread rapidly to the United
States, as did my grandparents.
According to "Collars . . .
Stocks . . . Cravats. A History and
Costume Dating Guide to Civil
ian Men's Neckpieces, 1655-
1900,'' by Doriece Colle (I swear
this is a real book), by 1865 the
tie was no longer a necessary part
of the costume, but simply an ac
cessory.
I would be remiss if I did not
include a few tips on how to pur
chase and use ties.
Choosing your width: Your tie
is too wide if a) You need not
wear a shirt under it to hide your
chest, or b) It is equilateral.
Choosing color: Power colors:
yellow, bright red, pink. Very
powerful colors: flaming (actually
on fire), purple (with little Prince
figures), dark black. Colors that
say, "I am a wimp": clear, flesh
(unless made out of actual tlesh),
glow-in-the-dark.
How to determine proper tie
length: Hang the tie from the tip
of your nose. If the end of the tie
reaches your kneecaps and the
temperature is green, then your
second life is grazing on moon
beams and the tie is completely
jealous.
Alternate method: It doesn't
matter, you'll still get it in your
soup.
