; Happy New Year! Here's
;hoping your vacation was as fun

and relaxing as mine and that
you're back bright and fresh and
ready to tackle classes with the
same vigor and verve as always.
As is my family's tradition, we
went to a small Middle Eastern
nation and traded my sister for
two camels and a second-round
draft pick. Actually, I can't tell
you how great my vacation was.
The reason I can't tell you how
great my vacation was is because I
haven't it yet. Although
you are reading this on Jan. 5,
through the magic of technology I
am actually writing this on Dec.
14. Now you can relive the horror
of finals along with me.
I just got done with a three
hour linguistics final ("Justify
your tongue. Give two exam
ples.") and am currently prepar
ing for my physiology final
("Write an essay on your tongue.
Then copy the essay from your
tongue onto the bluebook.").
I need your questions. Send
your really stupid questions to
Bug Me, Stanford Daily, Storke
Publications Building, Stanford,
CA, 94309. Or, for those of you
too cheap to cough up 22 cents,
send 'em to Bug-Me (not B.Bug-
Me) at the tragedies on LOTS.
Do it today. No obligation. Noth

ing to buy. No salesman will call.
Your mileage may vary.
Dear Bug,
I've noticed that the cashiers at
the Stanford Bookstore typically
won't accept Stanford fac
ulty /staff ID cards as identifica
tion when you want to pay by
check, although they will accept
student ID cards. Why is this? Do
they think faculty and staff mem
bers are more likely to pass bad
checks than students?

Let us consider, for a moment,
what a faculty/staff ID card actu
ally proves. . . . Basically, it
proves that the holder of the card
exists. Except when shopping in
existential bookstores, existence
in no way proves that you have a
line of credit worth your under
wear.
Back in the good old days when

Stanford was a small, close-knit
community and the faculty could
be trusted, the Bookstore would
accept faculty/staff IDs because
everyone on campus had a
familiar face. (The post office is
next door .... They've got those
portraits . . . aw, forget it.) Now,
with this huge, conglomerate,
multinational research university
and delicatessen, the bookstore
folks can no longer trust any old
yahoo who walks in off the street
with a faculty/staff ID card and
wants to write a check to pay for
57 "Women of Stanford" calen
dars.
Some faculty — particularly
professors — become known
around the Bookstore after a
while, in which case they are per
fectly welcome to use their fac
ulty/staff IDs. Although, come to
think of it, if they're already
known, why do they need an ID
at all? Faculty/staff can also apply

for a courtesy card, which basi
cally gives them the courtesy of
parting with their money faster.
Which brings us to the stu
dents. Why is it that I can't pay by
check in most department stores
without eight picture IDs and
four major credit cards but can
waltz into the Bookstore and
write an out-of-state check for
300 smackers using my student
ID and a driver's license?
Can you say "Registration
hold"?
Yes, that's right, the power of
the registrar looms over your
credit line even as we speak. If a
student should happen to pass a
bad check at the Bookstore, the
registrar is notified, and immedi
ately a hold is placed on the guilty
student's registration. For those
of you who have never suffered
the consequences of a registration
