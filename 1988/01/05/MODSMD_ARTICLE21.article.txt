# Course Guide now computerized
## 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
Because of prohibitive pub
lishing costs, the ASSU Course
Guide will make its debut this
quarter as an on-line computer
program instead of as a
newsprint release.
Organizers hope that the
new computer Course Guide,
like other programs in Stan
ford's Folio system, will lower
project costs while increasing
the efficiency and scope of the
service.
The ASSU Course Guide
serves as a supplement to
Courses and Degrees and the
Time Schedule by offering
more in-depth course descrip
tions, as well as course evalua
tions written by students.
"(The Guide] became very
expensive to publish and
couldn't be very comprehen
sive because of publishing
costs," said senior Alice Lee,
the ASSU Course Guide proj
ect manager. As a result, the
guide was not offered last year,
Lee said.
The idea for the Folio
originated last year, according
to Lee, who has been working
on the project since last spring,
along with University
programmers, the ASSU and
the Undergraduate Advising
Center. The Course Guide
joins approximately 20 Folio
files, including SOCRATES
and Odyssey, which are now in
use on campus.
A grant from IBM. along
with ASSU contributions,
funded the new guide, which
became operational yesterday.
Lee said that even "comput
er-shy" students will find the
guide easy to use because it ac
cesses information in a variety

of ways not possible before.
"The program is very self
explanatory," she said, adding
that it will provide "very up
to-date material and it is quick
and easy to get to the informa
tion."
For example, students may
select courses according to the
time slots in their schedules, as
well as by departments. The
program will also access infor
mation by professor, units,
area of distribution require
ment, course title, subject or a
combination of these criteria.
In selecting the courses to
include in the program, Lee
and project organizers first
chose classes with an enroll
ment at or above 40 students.
They also included classes with
lecture notes and classes that
fill distribution requirements.
Academic departments
could also request that specific
courses be included in the
Folio.
"Just under 300 courses will
be offered in this file," said
Becky Morton, a programmer
who worked with Lee on the
project.
Students may use the guide
through "any public terminal
that has access to Folio files,"
or with their own equipment,
Morton said. Green and Meyet
libraries, as well as the Career
Planning and Placement Cen
ter and Sweet Hall, each have
one terminal equipped to
access any Folio file on
campus.
In addition, students may
open a Folio account and use
terminals in Sweet Hall, Ter
man Engineering Building or
LOTS II to access the course
guide.
"We're viewing this winter
quarter as an experimental time
so we can see what kind of
response we get from students,"
Morton said.
In its first quarter, the guide

will depend upon course evalua
tions that were written last year.
"To be cautious, I'd say that
about half the classes (included in
the system) will have evalua
tions," Lee said.
"(The guide] will become more
complete and comprehensive" as
organizers add to it, according to
Lee.
Lee said students will be asked

to give their opinion of the
Course Guide. The program will
contain a section where students
can input suggestions or pose
questions.
"We realize that [the projectj is
very experimental, and we want
people to keep that in mind and
not judge us too harshly. We cer
tainly have a lot of room for im
provement."
