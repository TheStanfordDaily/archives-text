# Columnist makes New Year's wishes
## 
### 
Welcome lo 1988, folks.
Here's an entirely unoriginal
topic: a New Year's wish list
for the Stanford athletic com
munity.
I probably can't be as corny
as the editor of my hometown
paper (His name is Fred. His
major wish every year is that
the public and Catholic high
schools play football on
Thanksgiving.), but I'll try.

In no particular order:
Stanford students, faculty,
etc.: Lights on some tennis
courts, and a Field house where
we can play hoops at 3 a.m.
Lady Cardinal basketball
team: It seems like Coach Tara
VanDerveer has everything:
an 1 L-0 record, a No. 12
ranking and bunches of blue
chip players and recruits. It
would be nice to have more
fans in the stands.
Intramural office: Some new
entity to challenge Biz I and
Biz II now that Roble is gone.
Branner? Toyon? How about a
couple of Wilbur or Stern
dorms joining forces?
Field hockey, wrestling, fen
cing, women's soccer and
softball: More funding.
They've been doing well with
out the money and could prob
ably do better with it.
Stanford football team: The
Rose Bowl, it can be done.
Bonnie Warner, Debbi
Thomas, John Coyle, Sheryl
Johnson and any other Stan

ford athletes competing in the
upcoming Olympics: Medals
and fun.
Stanford men's and women's
gymnastics: Berths in the
NCAA championships (the
title?).
Patrick McEnroe: NCAA
title for himself and/or the
team, or at least a healthy pair
of feet.
John McEnroe: U.S. Open
title for Patrick's older brother
and former Stanford student.
San Francisco 49ers: Defeat.
Soon. Sorry folks, but all this
hoopla makes my stomach
churn.
Cardinal men's soccer team:
Continuation of the tourna
ment Stanford hosted last fall.
The Field of teams was strong,
the crowds were hefty, and
there was a lot of quality play.
Stanford baseball team: A
return to Omaha and the con
tinued phenomenal support of
the local community. If you
want an entertaining afternoon
in the spring, sit along the First
base line with all the old fogies
at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford Daily: More fresh
man sportswriters to join Ear
nest, Macky, Pardington,
Spander and Co.
Cardinal men's basketball:
Postseason competition for
Montgomery's men. These
guys are for real. And please,
can we have louder fans. I'd
like to use the word "deaf
ening" in at least one article
this year.
Stanford club sports: More
recognition and ink for these
student-athletes.
Pick-up basketball: How
about having one of those
massive street basketball tour
naments that Notre Dame and
other schools have. We could
use the Roble parking lot.
