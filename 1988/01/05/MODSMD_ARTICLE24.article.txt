## Cardinal places 5th in Taiwan 
### Chris Myers Editorial staff 
So far this season, the Stanford
baseball team has had a taste of
victory, a taste of defeat and a
taste of East-Asian culture.
Playing in the Taipei Interna
tional Tournament in Taiwan in
early December, the defending
national champion Cardinal won
three games, lost four and found
out what it's like to be strangers
in a strange land.
"It wasn't hard to recognize us
(in the streets) because we were
so much larger than the general
population," Stanford Asst.
Coach Dean Stotz said. "The
people were extremely nice ....
They all went out of their way to
make us feel welcome."
But the Cardinal, picked to
represent the United States in the
tournament after winning the
NCAA College World Series in
Omaha, Neb., last June, had to
adjust to some new circum
stances. The Taiwanese, it seems,
think nothing of playing baseball
in rain. "They played in condi
tions that you or I would never
think of playing in," Stotz said.
"A few times they played in
standing water."
Stotz said that both fields on
which the tournament was played
had all-dirt infields and had es
sentially no pitcher's mound. In
fact, on one of the fields, the
pitchers were throwing uphill,
Stotz said.
In addition, the national teams
the Cardinal faced fielded players
much older than Stanford's
players, Stotz said. "And we
faced everybody's best pitcher
and everybody's best team," he
said.
Still, the Cardinal managed to
adjust to the strange conditions
well enough to win two of its first
three games. Playing in Kaoh
siung, Stanford beat one of two
Taiwan national teams, 6-5, lost
to Japan, 9-3, and beat Ven
