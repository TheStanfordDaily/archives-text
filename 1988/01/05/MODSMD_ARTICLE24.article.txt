## Cardinal places 5th in Taiwan 
### Chris Myers Editorial staff 
So far this season, the Stanford
baseball team has had a taste of
victory, a taste of defeat and a
taste of East-Asian culture.
Playing in the Taipei Interna
tional Tournament in Taiwan in
early December, the defending
national champion Cardinal won
three games, lost four and found
out what it's like to be strangers
in a strange land.
"It wasn't hard to recognize us
(in the streets) because we were
so much larger than the general
population," Stanford Asst.
Coach Dean Stotz said. "The
people were extremely nice ....
They all went out of their way to
make us feel welcome."
But the Cardinal, picked to
represent the United States in the
tournament after winning the
NCAA College World Series in
Omaha, Neb., last June, had to
adjust to some new circum
stances. The Taiwanese, it seems,
think nothing of playing baseball
in rain. "They played in condi
tions that you or I would never
think of playing in," Stotz said.
"A few times they played in
standing water."
Stotz said that both fields on
which the tournament was played
had all-dirt infields and had es
sentially no pitcher's mound. In
fact, on one of the fields, the
pitchers were throwing uphill,
Stotz said.
In addition, the national teams
the Cardinal faced fielded players
much older than Stanford's
players, Stotz said. "And we
faced everybody's best pitcher
and everybody's best team," he
said.
Still, the Cardinal managed to
adjust to the strange conditions
well enough to win two of its first
three games. Playing in Kaoh
siung, Stanford beat one of two
Taiwan national teams, 6-5, lost
to Japan, 9-3, and beat Ven

ezuela, 9-3. Junior first baseman
Ron Witmeyer contributed two
home runs in the first three
games, and junior pitcher Brian
Keyser turned in a sterling seven
inning, four-hit performance
against Venezuela.
The Cardinal then faced Puerto
Rico, considered one of the finest
teams in international competi
tion.
Stanford jumped out to a 4-2
lead behind a two-run home run
by sophomore second baseman
Tim Griffin, but Puerto Rico
prevailed 7-6.
In its next game, on Dec. 9 in
Taipei, the Cardinal thumped
Holland 10-0 in a game that was
called after the seventh inning. A
rule of international play stip
ulates that a game be called after
seven innings if one team leads by
10 or more runs.
Highly touted freshman Mike
Mussina and sophomore Robbie
Kamerschen, both right-handers,
combined for a no-hitter, with
Mussina going six innings and
Kamerschen mopping up.
But it was the Cardinal that got
shut out in its next game, with
right-hander Ping-Yang Huang

hurling a complete-game two
hitter and striking out 13 as the
China Blue team rolled to a 3-0
victory.
Stanford came up empty again
in its final game, losing 2-0 to
Korea. Keyser threw seven strong
innings, hut righty Dong-Hee
Park went all the way for Korea,
giving up only three hits and re
cording 15 strikeouts.
"We faced some outstanding
pitching," Stotz said. "Some of
those guys could throw in the
major leagues."
Although Stanford's hitters,
perhaps a bit rusty after a three
week layoff before the tourna
ment, struggled, Stotz said the
Cardinal pitchers — despite the
absence of senior ace Lee Plemel,
who remained at Stanford to
study — threw well. "As a staff,
just about everyone pitched
well," he said.
Because of some of the unusual
conditions under which it was
played, however, the tournament
did not offer a fair evaluation of
where Stanford stands, Stotz said.
"The main focus of the trip was to
just try to enjoy ourselves as a
reward for what we did last year,"
he said.

Cardinal first baseman Ron Witmeyer hit two home runs to lead Stanford to three victories in seven games at
the Taipei International Tournament.
ezuela, 9-3. Junior first baseman
Ron Witmeyer contributed two
home runs in the first three
games, and junior pitcher Brian
Keyser turned in a sterling seven
inning, four-hit performance
against Venezuela.
The Cardinal then faced Puerto
Rico, considered one of the finest
teams in international competi
tion.
Stanford jumped out to a 4-2
lead behind a two-run home run
by sophomore second baseman
Tim Griffin, but Puerto Rico
prevailed 7-6.
In its next game, on Dec. 9 in
Taipei, the Cardinal thumped
Holland 10-0 in a game that was
called after the seventh inning. A
rule of international play stip
ulates that a game be called after
seven innings if one team leads by
10 or more runs.
Highly touted freshman Mike
Mussina and sophomore Robbie
Kamerschen, both right-handers,
combined for a no-hitter, with
Mussina going six innings and
Kamerschen mopping up.
But it was the Cardinal that got
shut out in its next game, with
right-hander Ping-Yang Huang

hurling a complete-game two
hitter and striking out 13 as the
China Blue team rolled to a 3-0
victory.
Stanford came up empty again
in its final game, losing 2-0 to
Korea. Keyser threw seven strong
innings, hut righty Dong-Hee
Park went all the way for Korea,
giving up only three hits and re
cording 15 strikeouts.
"We faced some outstanding
pitching," Stotz said. "Some of
those guys could throw in the
major leagues."
Although Stanford's hitters,
perhaps a bit rusty after a three
week layoff before the tourna
ment, struggled, Stotz said the
Cardinal pitchers — despite the
absence of senior ace Lee Plemel,
who remained at Stanford to
study — threw well. "As a staff,
just about everyone pitched
well," he said.
Because of some of the unusual
conditions under which it was
played, however, the tournament
did not offer a fair evaluation of
where Stanford stands, Stotz said.
"The main focus of the trip was to
just try to enjoy ourselves as a
reward for what we did last year,"
he said.
The Cardinal opens regular
season action Jan. 29 at Sunken
Diamond against Santa Clara.
