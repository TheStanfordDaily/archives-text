# Stanford cyclists set new standards
## Five riders race to personal bests 
### Witold J. Henisz 
Five riders bested their fastest
times of last season, and one rider
broke the Stanford course record
as the Stanford cycling team com
pleted its final intrasquad race of
the fall season Dec. 5.

Graduate student
Art Walker com
pleted the 1800-foot
climb in 16:37.

The team's previous intrasquad
contests each brought a new
course record, and this meet was
no exception.
Graduate student Art Walker
completed the 3.25-mile, 1800-
foot climb in 16:37, shaving one
second off the record. Junior

Steve Miller, alumnus Andy
Fitzhugh and graduate Mike
Fadich sprinted across the line in
that order at 17:07. Graduate Bill
Poland also broke his top mark of
last year (17:28) by one second,
establishing himself as a climbing
standout.
Many other riders posted per
sonal bests on this slightly cool
and windy Saturday. Junior cap
tain Hank Dart finished under
19:00 for the first time, and soph
omore Louis O'Neill was less
than 30 seconds behind.
The women lacked the record
breaking performances of the
men but rode strongly and ap
peared in greater number than
last season. Freshmen Ellen Aus
tin, Hilary Jensen and Libby Feil,
and sophomore Jennifer Johnson
all promise to show strong im
provement over the season and in
years to come.
This year the Cardinal cycling
team has enjoyed a 50 percent in
crease in participation.
