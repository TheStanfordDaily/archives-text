# Costs run high in Roble closing
## 
### David Dirks 
University officials are be
ginning to assess the costs of
the recent closing of Roble
Hall, but Facilites Project
Manager Jonathan Ryan yes
terday called the possible es
timates "wide open."
"We should have a
reasonable estimate by mid-
February," Ryan said.
The University's expenses
include:
• the initial seismic study of
the building,
• the remodeling of existing
residences to accommodate ex
tra students,
• new phone lines for the stu
dents,
• overtime pay for many Roble
staff members,
• moving costs, and
• long-term costs of renovating
Roble itself.
Because the renovation
study being done by the San
Francisco engineering firm
Rutherford and Chekene is
still taking place, an accurate
estimate of the costs of the
study is not available.
"We have set aside $20,000
as an outside number" for the
study, said Keith Guy, director
of Housing and Food Service.
He added that the firm will
have to re-consult with the
University if the study exceeds
that amount.

Ryan said it was not yet pos
sible to arrive at an exact cost
for the survey because the firm
has a two-fold assignment: ex
ploration and research into the
problem, and coming up with a
solution and a design.
The remodeling of existing
rooms in order to accommo
date the influx of Roble stu
dents is another expense that
has not been finalized. "We've
established an account for all
these projects," said Guy, who
added that new furniture will
have to be purchased in many
cases.
Students moving into previ
ously unoccupied space will re
quire new phone lines, a cost
which could reach up to $2500
for the approximately 70 newly
allocated living spaces that do
not yet have phones.
Another major cost of the
closing is the overtime pay for
employees who are working
day and night at Roble.
"We have 100 to 125 people
constantly working in the
building. They've been
working all weekend," Guy
said. "Each shift there are 29
people who are just standing at
the doorways, controlling
access."
An additional $12,000 to
$13,000 has been put aside for
moving costs, a figure Guy said
may fluctuate.
