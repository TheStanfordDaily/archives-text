# Closing will not affect admissions
## Enough housing for new students will be available, officials say 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
The creation of temporary
housing in response to the closure
of Roble Hall will offset any pos
sible adverse effects on the num
ber of students admitted to Stan
ford in the future, according to
University officials and staff
members in charge of the reloca
tion.
According to Dean of Under
graduate Admissions Jean Fetter,
the Office of Student Affairs
would make any decisions regard
ing lowered admissions. If a lack
of housing spaces for new stu
dents were to develop, Student
Affairs would inform the Admis
sions Office of the number of
housing spaces available for new

students, and the Admissions Of
fice would then cut admissions
based on that number.
But Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said a subcommittee
of the Roble Project Task Force
is currently looking at housing
options to replace spaces lost in
the Roble closure and that lower
ing admissions "is not even being
considered."
To offset the closure, the Uni
versity has created temporary
living quarters by using empty
spaces in dorms — such as com
puter rooms, libraries and
lounges — until permanent
housing is developed.
Lyons said that most of the
spaces, such as those in study or
recreation rooms, would be

returned to their normal usage
once alternative housing has been
found, although some of the tem
porary spaces will become perma
nent.
"We expect (Residential Edu
cation) programs affected by stu
dents living in those rooms to
return to normal in the future,"
Lyons said.
"The (admissions) issue hasn't
come up at all for discussion, and
there is no official decision or
even speculation" on the closure
affecting admissions, said Laurie
Silver, Roble Project hotline co
ordinator.
"My guess is admissions will
not be affected or at least not in
any severe way, because the sub
ject hasn't come up for discus
sion," she added.

Concerned that the Roble
closure might have affected ad
missions, officials in the Admis
sions Office "have asked that
question ourselves, and to
best of my knowledge [the
closure] will not affect admis
sions," Fetter said.
Silver said the Project staff ik
currently concentrating on
moving displaced Roble students
and has not had much opportu
nity to dwell on future problems
that might result from the closure,
including the effect on admis
sions.
"Right now we are concentrat
ing on the short range, and we ha
ven't had much chance to look at
the medium- or long-range" im-.
plications of the closure, Lyons
said. '*
