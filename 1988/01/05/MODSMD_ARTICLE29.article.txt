### David Kazanjian Staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy received a "Leader for
Peace" award at the end of last
quarter from the U.S. Peace
Corps honoring him for promot
ing Stanford's involvement in the
volunteer development organiza
tion.
Peace Corps Director Loret
Miller Ruppe presented Kennedy
with the award in a Dec. 1 1 cere
mony at the St. Francis Hotel in
San Francisco. The "Leader for
Peace" award honors Kennedy
for his role in a Stanford confer

ence last March that sought to
foster a new alliance between in
stitutions of higher education and
the Peace Corps. Presidents of 15
universities attended the two-day
session with representatives from
Peace Corps host countries.
Jim Flannigan, press officer for
the Peace Corps Office of Public
Affairs, called Kennedy a "strong
advocate of student participation
in the Peace Corps." Flannigan
stressed the importance of the
March conference in the Peace
Corps' "Leadership for Peace"
campaign, which aims at doubling
the number of volunteers over
seas to 10,000 by 1992.

UC-Berkeley will receive a
similar award for leading the
United States in total Peace
Corps volunteers with 2564 over
the course of the Corps' 26-year
history.
Stanford, which has a much
smaller undergraduate enroll
ment, ranks eighth with 1032
over the same period. Flannigan
noted that California colleges and
universities lead the nation in
total Peace Corps volunteers.
Flannigan said that although
the average age of a Peace Corps
volunteer has increased to 30, a
high percentage of volunteers are
students just out of college. "1
think it gives them a sense of

helping people and a chance to
learn about other cultures and to
learn other languages," he said.
Other universities in the top 10
include Wisconsin-Madison,
Michigan State, Washington,
Minnesota, Michigan, Colorado,
Illinois and UCLA.
Other award winners included
Julia Chang Bloch, assistant ad
ministrator of the Bureau for
Asia and the Near East at the
U.S. Information Agency; Atlan
tic Richfield Internatinal Oil and
Gas Co.; Kaypro Computers; and
the Northern California Council
of Returned Peace Corps Volun
teers.
