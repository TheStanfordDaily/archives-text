Former Black Student Union (BSU)
Chair and Stanford alumnus Steve
Phillips and 17 Stanford students
traveled to Georgia and Alabama this
week in an attempt to increase voter
registration in counties with large per
centages of unregistered black resi
dents.
"We're trying to give people a rea
son to vote," Phillips said yesterday.
"Now is a critical time for black people
[of the South| to try to gain political
power."
The students are acting as part of
Project Democracy, a black voter reg
istration drive sponsored by the BSU
and the Public Service Center and
aided by private donations.
The students are spending most of

their time traveling door-to-door to
identify unregistered blacks. Phillips
said. The names of potential black
voters are then sent to an organization
called the Campaign for a New South,
which sends out registration materials
The Campaign for a New South is
trying to increase black voter registra
tion and to educate black voters about
important political issues, according to
Director Edna Bryant.
"The students are helping people to
see how important it is to vote," Bry ant
said.
Since the Voting Rights Act was im
plemented in the 19605, there has been
an increase in the number of black
elected officials, Phillips noted.
He cited the recent rejection of
Robert Bork as a Supreme Court

justice as an example of black po
litical power. Pressure from black
voters had a significant impact on
the Senate's decision to reject
Bork, Phillips said.
According to Phillips, the na
tional elections this year will give
black voters — especially those
who live in the South — a chance
to exert their political power.
The students' efforts, Phillips
noted, may have a significant ef
fect on the national elections be
cause of 14 upcoming presidential
primaries occurring in Southern
states March 8, or Super Tuesday.
"National leaders have deter
mined that the South will be very
important in the 1988 elections
(because of Super Tuesday),"
Phillips said.
The main focus of the students'

efforts is, however, local elec
tions, according to Phillips. The
students hope to register more
black voters so that the black
majority will be able to get its
candidates into local offices, he
said.
"Black majority rule is the
watchword here," Phillips said.
The students are registering
and educating voters, but they are
also learning at the same time, he
said. "So far, this experience has
been tremendously educational
for everyone," Phillips said.
Several speakers have dis
cussed issues of black power with
the students. These speakers have
included the Rev. C.T. Vivian,
who is a former aide to Dr. Mar
tin Luther King Jr., and Albert
Turner, who heads the Alabama
chapter of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference. The stu
dents are staying at the home of
Alabama State Sen. Hank
Sanders.
