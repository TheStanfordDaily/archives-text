Former Black Student Union (BSU)
Chair and Stanford alumnus Steve
Phillips and 17 Stanford students
traveled to Georgia and Alabama this
week in an attempt to increase voter
registration in counties with large per
centages of unregistered black resi
dents.
"We're trying to give people a rea
son to vote," Phillips said yesterday.
"Now is a critical time for black people
[of the South| to try to gain political
power."
The students are acting as part of
Project Democracy, a black voter reg
istration drive sponsored by the BSU
and the Public Service Center and
aided by private donations.
The students are spending most of

their time traveling door-to-door to
identify unregistered blacks. Phillips
said. The names of potential black
voters are then sent to an organization
called the Campaign for a New South,
which sends out registration materials
The Campaign for a New South is
trying to increase black voter registra
tion and to educate black voters about
important political issues, according to
Director Edna Bryant.
"The students are helping people to
see how important it is to vote," Bry ant
said.
Since the Voting Rights Act was im
plemented in the 19605, there has been
an increase in the number of black
elected officials, Phillips noted.
He cited the recent rejection of
Robert Bork as a Supreme Court
