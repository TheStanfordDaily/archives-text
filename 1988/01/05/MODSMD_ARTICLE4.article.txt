# Flood causes minor damage
## Main water pipe between Tresidder and Old Union breaks 
### Hsuan Sze 
A break in the main water line run
ning underneath Tresidder Union and
Old Union caused a minor flood for
several hours Sunday night but resulted
in little damage to surrounding build
ings, according to Paul Szczesiul, assis
tant director of Tresidder.
The main line that supplies water to
Tresidder and surrounding buildings
runs parallel to a steam tunnel. Ac
cording to Szczesiul, the leaking por
tion of the line will not affect the water
supply to Tresidder and the surround
ing buildings.
Although cracks and breaks are
fairly common in old pipes, the source
of the break is still unknown, Szczesiul
said To locate the cause would require

a close examination of the leaking
water line, which runs underneath the
Tresidder patio area, he said.
Because of the heavy traffic at the
Tresidder patio and White Plaza at the
beginning of a quarter, officials chose
not to tear into these areas. The
leaking water line has been temporarily
capped, and future re-routing of the
water line will be scheduled.
Szczesiul said the new water line will
probably run under the asphalt pave
ment between Tresidder and Old Un
ion to minimize inconvenience for
Stanford students
After building services manager
Jeanette Smith Laws discovered an
excess amount of steam around the
water line Sunday night, she ordered a
crew from Operations and Mainte

nance to locate the cause.
The cost incurred in the water line
break is still to be determined. The
damages to the steam tunnel are under
evaluation Future repairs include
replacing steam pipe insulation lost in
the flooding.
The inside of Tresidder and organi
zations located at the basement of Old
Union — including Hillel, Volunteers
in Asia and the Native American In
dian Association were unaffected by
the flooding.
A dozen workers from the Stanford
Water Department worked on the line
from K p.m. to 4 a m , spending three
hours pumping out hundreds of gallons
of water from the steam tunnel to allow
a crew to go underground to find the
source of the leak.
