### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
The University last month received
three donations totaling nearly $3 mil
lion to help establish Stanford's campus
in Washington, D C., which is scheduled
to open spring quarter.
Robert and Anne Bass of Fort Worth,
Texas, donated $15 million to expedite
the purchase of the Stanford-in-
Washington facility on Connecticut Av
enue. Currently president of a Texas
holding company, Robert Bass obtained
.in M B A from Stanford in 1974.
The Basses were unavailable for com
ment yesterday.
Previously a hotel and restaurant, the
four-story brick building in Washington,
D C, is being renovated to accommo
date up to 3b students, along with fac
ulty members and resident advisers.
By March, the structure will also in
clude two student lounges, a kitchen,
two dining rooms, two seminar rooms, a
large lecture room and a computer
room.
The facility will be named "The
Robert M. and Anne T. Bass Center for
Stanford in Washington."
"It's going to be a fine residence
hall," said Stanford-in-Washington Di
rector David Danelski. "It will match
anything on campus."
A $ 100,000 gift from University Vice
President and Provost James Rosse and
his wife Janice will establish the
Stanford-in Washington library in
memory of their daughter Susan, a Stan
ford alumna who died in a 1983 car acci
dent.
An additional $1.2 million was
pledged by George and Mary Lou

Boone of San Marino to endow the
directorship of the program.
George Boone, retired from or
thodontic practice, emphasized the
"perpetuity" of the endowment. Be
cause the money will be reinvested each
year, the program should he able to con
tinue indefinitely, he said.
Boone added that he and his wife
have been "quite active philanthropi
cally," especially with private colleges
and young people."
"We like to invest money in the fu
ture, and getting (students] involved in
government . . . (is) a wonderful idea,"
Boone said "The idea was floating
around for a while, and (University
President) Donald Kennedy gave us the
actual proposal."
Boone added that the new program
would "open and broaden new horizons
for [students]" by letting them "rub
shoulders with internationally renowned
people."
Danelski praised the "excellent
work" by the University Office of De
velopment in securing the monetary
commitments for Stanford-in-
Washington, adding that "President
Kennedy was very important" in the
fund raising.
He also said the Stanford-in-
Washington program allows undergrad
uates to learn directly about public
policy-making through government in
ternships, weekly seminars and small
group theme tutorials on specific topics
such as arms control or the budgetary
process.
The highly selective program admit
ted 14 "pilot" students — mostly juniors
— who will spend a 13-week spring
quarter this year in the nation's capital
