INS to free Cuban detainees
WASHINGTON — The federal government has released a
dozen Cubans under a newly strengthened screening program
that was initiated in the wake of two prison riots, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS) said yesterday.
The INS had begun a review program last June but suspended
it in November when Cuban detainees took over federal facilities
in Oakdale, La., and Atlanta. In resuming the program last
month, the INS increased its number of screening "teams" from
seven to 16.
"We started the program back up because of the agreement
ending the riots" Dec. 4, said Duke Austin, an INS spokesman.
That agreement called for the program to go into effect again and
assured that no retaliation would be made against prisoners in
volved in the uprising.
Officials said that the screening teams are now fanning out to
17 prisons where 214 Cubans are being held. Many of these pris
ons hold some of the 2400 Cubans who were moved from the
heavily damaged facilities in Atlanta and Oakdale.
The resumption of the program is likely to re-ignite a long
standing battle over the release of the Cuban prisoners into
American society, which has raged since most of the immigrants
came to the United States in the Mariel boatlift of 1980. Many of
these Cubans were known to be criminals or are mentally unsta
ble.
Before the riots began in November, 1149 of the 7600 Cubans
held nationwide had been approved for parole and 100 had been
released. INS officials said that most of those freed are being
placed in halfway houses and that some are going to the homes of
relatives.
Design of shuttle booster faulted
WASHINGTON — Engineers at the Morton Thiokol Inc.
plant in Utah concluded yesterday that a design flaw led to the
failure of a previously untested space shuttle booster part during
a full-scale test firing Dec. 23.
The engineers said the effect of the flaw was probably ag
gravated by a severe test maneuver. More analysis is needed
before a replacement design can be adopted, they added.
The most optimistic scenario would allow the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to launch a
shuttle in late summer, officials said.
The failed design was one favored by NASA engineers, al
though there were reservations at both Thiokol and NASA. It
may be replaced by one favored by contractor Thiokol that was
tested successfully in September, according to NASA and
Thiokol officials.
The next flight of the shuttle, scheduled for June 2, has been
delayed indefinitely until the failure can be more fully studied
and a recovery plan can be established. A decision on what
course to pursue could come at the end of this week.
N AS A officials delayed the flight schedule last week after they
discovered that a large portion of the booster's nozzle assembly,
which guides the vehicle, had broken apart during last month's
test.
The design failed by a much greater margin than even its
Thiokol and NASA critics anticipated, according to most ac
counts of the incident. NASA's director of propulsion, Russell
Bardos, said that even if the part "hadn't broken off, there was
delamination (a coming apart of bonded layers) through it that
would have told us we have a problem. . . . We don't know why
[the design] failed yet. But by the looks of it, no matter what,
we'd not want to use it."
U.S. tries to influence deportation
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration, concerned
that a public squabble would only stiffen Israeli intransigence,
turned to quiet diplomacy and temperate language yesterday in
an uphill effort to persuade the Jerusalem government to cancel
plans to deport nine Palestinian activists.
"There is nothing further to be. gained by making a public
statement, and it might even be counterproductive," a State De
partment official said. "When the Israelis feel they are being
boxed into a corner, they sometimes lock themselves into a posi
tion they can't get out of."
"We are telling them what our position is on deportation — it
doesn't solve the problem," the official said. "The Israelis know
how we feel about it, but they have to come to their own conclu
sions."
He said that the administration had determined that the
chances for any easing of the deportation orders would be greater
if the United States gives Israel enough maneuvering room to
permit Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government to change
its plans without the appearance of knuckling under American
pressure.
The United States attempted last week to dissuade Israel from
deporting Palestinians in the wake of the riots that swept the oc
cupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. At that time, U.S. spokesmen
said publicly that expulsions would violate the 4th Geneva Con
vention of 1949, and Ambassador Thomas Pickering passed the
same message to Israeli leaders in private.
Soviets change rules for psychiatry
MOSCOW — Apparently reacting to international and do
mestic charges of widespread abuses in the field of psychiatry,
Soviet authorities have reportedly moved to protect citizens
against arbitrary commitment to mental institutions.
Tass, the Soviet news agency, said yesterday that the Presidium
of the Supreme Soviet had laid down new conditions and proce
dures for providing psychiatric care. Tass did not indicate when
the action was taken.
It came after publication of charges in the West, and more
recently in the Soviet press, that innocent persons had been
confined to psychiatric clinics for years without adequate cause.
And it appeared to be another step in a campaign by the Soviet
Union to rejoin the World Psychiatric Association, which it left
in 1982 shortly before it was to be expelled on charges that it was
abusing the practice of psychiatry in order to punish political dis
senters.
Western observers in Moscow said they would wait until the
new rules have been in effect for a while before deciding whether
they constitute a liberalizing step.
Soviet visits Afghan capital
MOSCOW — Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
left here yesterday on an unexpected visit to Kabul, raising
speculation about a possible Soviet diplomatic move in the eight
year-old war in Afghanistan.
The Soviet news agency Tass gave no details on the trip, which
it described as a "working visit." Shevardnadze was last in Af
ghanistan a year ago, shortly before the Kabul government an
nounced a policy of national reconciliation.
