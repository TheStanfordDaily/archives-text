# Dow and dollar rise together
## 
### 
NEW YORK — Roused from its late-1987
doldrums by the dollar's abrupt rebound, the
stock market yesterday began the new year
with an explosive rally that propelled the Dow
Jones industrial average to its fourth-largest
daily point gain on record.
The closely watched index of blue-chip
stocks romped to a 76.42-point gain, a 3.9
percent increase, to close the first trading ses
sion of 1988 at 2015.25. The gain erased last
week's 61-point Dow loss.
Yesterday's was a broad-based rally that
analysts said was marred only by the relatively
light trading volume. Only 181.81 million
shares changed hands on the New York Stock
Exchange, considerably less than the 250 mil
lion shares that analysts have come to expect
on such heady days.
The rally started at the opening bell and
gained steam throughout the day as impatient
investors took heart from the dollar's unex

peeled strength in foreign exchanges.
The Dow sped to a 55-point gain in the first
hour of trading and held its ground in that
neighborhood until mid-afternoon — a pat
tern mirrored by other, broader market
measures. Then began a surge that drove the
Dow up as high as 81.75 points just five
minutes before the end of trading.
All broader market measures also regis
tered sharp gains, and advancing stocks
routed declining issues on the New York
Stock Exchange by a margin of nearly 8 to 1.
The firming dollar was the key to yester
day's market performance, analysts said, al
though it was not the only factor.
After more than a week of steady losses in
the U.S. currency's value in foreign exchange,
the downward cascade was abruptly reversed
early yesterday after the Federal Reserve
Board and the central banks of West Ger
many and Japan intervened aggressively.

Elated currency traders began buying dollars,
and as their value surged, stock market inves
tors rushed to buy stocks.
"For the first time in several weeks, there is
a belief that the Fed ... has finally decided to
do something meaningful to support the dol
lar," said Trude Latimer, a market strategist
for the New York investment house of
Josephthal & Co. "That is an incredible psy
chological boost for the stock market."
Not even a midday reversal in the dollar's
surge — triggered by a report quoting an
unnamed Fed official as saying he doubts that
the dollar has hit bottom — succeeded in
squelching the stock market rally.
"As we say at the (horse-racing) track, this
market has Mate foot'; it is proving remarkably
resilient in the stretch," said Michael Metz, a
market strategist with the Oppenheimer &
Co. investment company.
