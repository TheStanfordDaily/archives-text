# W. German attache slain in Paris

### 
PARIS — A 31-year-old West
German Embassy attache was
shot and killed on a footbridge
near the Eiffel Tower in the early
hours of yesterday morning, the
eighth foreign diplomat assas
sinated in Paris in the last 10
years.
The diplomat, Siegfried Wiels
putz, was found dying, with a
handwritten, anti-German tract
in his pocket signed by a Kurdish
independence organization.
He told two young men who
found him, "I've been shot." The
two men, who called the police
for help, said they noticed a car

speeding away as Wielsputz
spoke.
Wielsputz, an officer in the visa
section of the embassy's consu
late, died soon after he arrived at
a hospital.
The tract, signed by the Kur
dish National Liberation Front,
did not claim responsibility for
the shooting, and a statement
denying responsibility for the
"cowardly murder," also signed
by the group, was later delivered
to the news agency Agence
France-Presse here. The state
ment said the leaflet was intended
to discredit the Kurdish move

ment.
Earlier, the West German
Federal Criminal Investigation
Office in Wiesbaden said that
"the first signs can speak for" a
connection "with Kurdish leftist
terrorists."
The front is reportedly an or
ganization set up by the Kurdish
Workers Party, an underground
group accused of using terror in a
European campaign to help
create an autonomous, leftist
Kurdish state out of Turkish terri
tory. West German police said
that the Kurdish Workers Party
was responsible for one murder,

two attempted murders and a se
ries of assaults.
The victims have been mainly
Turks. After raids by police on
Kurdish homes in West Germany
last summer, however, Kurdish
independence groups began pick
eting government and private
German installations in Europe.
But Wolf Liebau, a spokesman
for the West Germany embassy
here, said that he had dealt per
sonally with Kurdish demonstra
tors during recent protests and
found them "always completely
peaceful."
