# Report: animal facility no threat
## 
### Mary Elizabeth McNitt Staff writer 
A recently released environ
mental impact report (EIR) indi
cates that the University's
planned Research Animal Facil
ity II (R AF II) will pose no threat
to the environment. The report
should pave the wave for con
struction to begin this spring, fol
lowing a one-year delay caused
by animal rights actvists.
Animal rights groups encour
aged the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors to require
that Stanford file the EIR for
RAF 11. Barring any major
changes to the report after a
public hearing is conducted, the
supervisors are likely to approve
a land-use permit for the facility
at their March 29 meeting.
The draft report will be open to
public scrutiny until Feb. 5, at
which time public concerns and
comments will be added and the
EI R will be finalized.
Stanford officials and represen
tatives of an independent firm
hired to do the EIR will be on
hand to answer questions at a
public meeting scheduled for Jan.
21.
The proposed building would
house animals and research
facilties for the the Medical
School's Division of Laboratory
Animal Medicine. The building
would be located underneath a
parking lot near the Medical Cen
ter on Campus Drive West.
The County Planning Commis
sion approved the proposal for
RAF II last May, sparking con
siderable reaction from animal
rights activists, including the Palo
Alto Humane Society. In July, su
pervisors decided to delay the
building until the completion of
an EIR because of the controver
sial nature of the proposed con
struction.
Commenting on the draft EIR,
University project manager Step
hen Kyle Glenn said, "It's very
convincing that RAF II will pose
no hazard whatsoever, and I think
that's quite clear when one sees
the report."
Larry Horton, Stanford associ
ate vice president for Public Af
fairs, said, "This is not a danger
ous building. The report shows
that there are no health and
safety hazards at all."
"The Humane Society is bent
on obstruction (of the project),"
he said.
Horton said that despite the
findings of the report he will not

attempt a guess at what the super
visors will decide.
Patricia Elsen, a director of the
Palo Alto Humane Society, said
the results of the EIR did not
surprise her. She said she hoped
the report would give the public a
chance to raise questions about
the issue.
Elsen said that the report
makes assertions about the envi
ronmental impact of RAF II that

the humane society will question
in a written response.
She said that the University is
saying, "We've got everything
under control. Trust us," but that
the Humane Society still ques
tions "whether the techniques
proposed are adequate to deal
with the potential hazards."
Lise Giraud, another of the
Humane Society directors, said,
"The EIR aspect of the issue was

triggered by our concern with the
animals."
Giraud said that the society dis
covered that 50,000 animals were
to be used in "potentially hazar
dous" recombinant DN A re
search.
Horton labeled the most signif
icant consequences of the build
ing delay as the negative impact
on science and costs to the Uni
versity that exceed $500,000.
