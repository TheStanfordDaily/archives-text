# Faculty houses to get cable TV
## 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
Installation of a cable television
system to serve nearly 850 on
campus faculty residences will
begin next week, according to
University Vice Presidents
William Massy and Robert Street.
Massy, who has lived on
campus since 1969, said, "Most
of us who live here are very anx
ious to get [cable television]."
The system is scheduled to be
operational by June or July.
According to Julia Fremon,
cable project coordinator for the
Office of Business and Finance,
the University began exploring
the possibility of cable installation
10 to 15 years ago.
"The process and public delib
eration have made the project
long," she said.
"Amicable negotiations" for
installing cable in student
residences are also progressing
well, according to Massy.
"I'm very optimistic," he said.
"Both parties (Pacific Bell and
the University) are motivated to
do the project."
Fremon agreed, saying, "We're
expecting the negotiations to
work out satisfactorily."

The University is considering
two options for providing cable
television for student residences.
Cable could be extended into the
main part of campus from the fac
ulty residences, but Massy said
that would require "quite a bit of
wiring."
Instead, "the hope is that
(cable) will be linked with
SUNet," he said. All student
residences except those on the
Row are already connected to
SUNet, the University's fiber op
tic communications system.
"I don't think it will be very
long before (residences) can get
cable," said Massy, but he said it
would be too optimistic to expect
cable in student residences this
year.
In 1983, Stanford, Palo Alto,
Menlo Park, Atherton, East Palo
Alto and sections of Santa Clara
and San Mateo Counties agreed
to receive cable installation.
"Past research has shown that a
larger service area would be more
efficient," Fremon said.
Pacific Bell will build the fac
ulty residence system and will
then lease it to the Cable Com
munications Cooperative of Palo
Alto for operation.
The University is expected to

sign an agreement with Pacific
Bell this week so that construc
tion of the cable project can begin
Monday, according to Fremon.
The University decided to build
the system above ground so that it
can be used to connect home
computers with campus
mainframes. Underground sys
tems risk getting wet, which
would not hinder television trans
mission but would interfere with
data transmission.

'Amicable negoti
ations' for installing
cable in student
residences are also
progressing well.

In a meeting with University
officials last month, some faculty
residents opposed the above
ground system because its "little
green boxes," which contain
cable electronics, would be lo
cated where they could be seen.
But the residents "agreed to
have the more reliable boxes . . .
even though they are ugly,"
Fremon said.
