This week a group of Stanford students are
putting into practice what the Fourteenth
Amendment and the Voting Rights Act of 1965
put on paper — namely, enlisting American
citizens to participate in the freedom of their
birthright: the democratic election process.
Under the title of "Project Democracy," the
volunteers are currently canvassing poor, rural
areas in the South looking for black adults eligi
ble but unregistered for the vote. Though suf
frage was legally established well over a century
ago for the previously unfranchised black popula
tion, the existence of poll taxes, specious and
prejudicial state legislation and outright violence
kept most away from the polls until the reforms
of the 19605.
Since then, however, many Southern blacks, in
addition to a significant percentage of the white
citizenship, have still remained home on election
day, never having been educated in the mecha
nisms of government. A lethargy, a lack of faith
in the ability to effect positive political change,
has developed. "Project Democracy" is taking
active measures to ensure all black Americans a
voice in Washington, D.C., as well as in their

respective states and hometowns.
It is refreshing to see Stanford students dedi
cated to this unglamorous task. While many stu
dents attach themselves to high-profile cam
paigns — experience which offers slick resume
advertising — more should be willing to engage
themselves in activity away from the recognized
power centers.
Criticism has been directed at efforts similar to
"Project Democracy" for harboring deliberate
and singular political agendas. While it is true
that bringing new voters to the polls may result in
refiguring legislative bodies, and thus public
policy, the potentiality of change should not be
feared in itself — it defines our inherited consti
tutional system.
Voter turnout is severely on the decline; in
creased electoral participation, in all strata of so
ciety, is precisely what is needed to reinvigorate a
commitment to healthy democracy, to the open
ness of pluralism.
The recent election violence in Haiti should
remind us of the precious, affirming nature of the
right to vote. "Project Democracy" aims to give
more of us that very feeling.
