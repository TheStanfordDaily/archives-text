Hart could give
morality lessons
The question to ask about Gary
Hart's private life is whether he
can show leadership in self
examination and renunciation. If
he cannot condemn the way those
in power so easily make use of
privilege, if he cannot reject his
own deceptions and cover-ups —
private and public — or explore
why such behavior afflicts men in
the upper reaches of any
hierarchy, if his wife shows her
self too weak and too duped to
withstand his privilege, then he
remains untrustworthy, and she
remains the last lady one should
want as the first.
But if Gary and Lee Hart use
the campaign to expose the
destructiveness of deception and
the inequities of infidelity, then
his candidacy could do the
country's morality a real service,
and his former frame of mind
should cease to damage him.

Save Foothills
for community
We would like to applaud Jen
nifer Hansen's column, "Plea for
the Foothills" (Daily, Nov. 24).
We are appalled that the Univer
sity Planning Office would even
think about developing the Foot
hills. They might have gotten the
message last year that the Stan
ford Community wants to keep
the Foothills. They are a unique
resource, and it would be ex
tremely shortsighted to deprive
future generations of Stanfordites
of this special place.
The Planning Office acknowl
edges that such space is going to
become even more rare in the fu
ture, but thinks it will suffice to
preserve a small fraction of it, as
"a vignette of what the Spaniards
saw." Sure. It will be just great to
run, walk, bike, picnic, etc. in a

"vignette" that doesn't have any
of the existing roads/trails going
through it and is nicely situated
between the new buildings and
Junipero Serra Boulevard.
The Planning Office justifies
the proposal on the grounds that
the wording of the founding grant
requires the land to be used for
academic purposes (like expan
sion of the golf course?).
But even if they were sincere in
their intent to follow the wishes of
Jane and Leland, it would be
more appropriate to consider
changing circumstances and the
needs of the Stanford community
than to blindly follow the wording
of the founding grant. Silicon
Valley did not exist when the
grant was written. The "intent"
was to provide the best possible
academic facilities on every piece
of available land.

All or nothing in
equal rights fight
Today's phenomenon of wo
men breaking down male barriers
while keeping their own appears
to have hit Stanford. While
searching for classes to take, I
noticed that there are two types
of weight training courses:
Weight Training and Weight
Training for Women. The former
class is open to both men and
women; the title of the latter
speaks for itself. Surely it is un
derstandable that some women
might feel uncomfortable exercis
ing in front of men. There are
valid social reasons for certain
closed activities. However, when
men desire to exclude women
from a social situation, feminists
demand their "equal rights." Wit
ness the outcry over the all-male
Bohemian Club. Yet no one
protests an all-female club such as
Marin County's Morning Dia

logue. feminists must realize that
their "equal rights" should not be
"one-way rights."

Freshman, undeclared
Cheerleaders
lend needed boost
This letter is in response to
Chris Fialko's clever little column
printed in the Dec. 3 issue of The
Daily.
Chris pointed out that the
Maples Pavilion crowd was
"improved but could be better."
He also stated that the Stanford
cheerleaders are "certainly un
necessary." Forgive me if I'm
wrong, but doesn't it make sense
that the Maples Pavilion crowd
may not have been as vocal in the
past because there were no or
ganized spirit leaders to get the
crowd involved? Personally, I
find it puzzling that the obvious
positive correlation between the
cheerleaders' presence and the
improved Maples Pavilion crowd
completely eluded our astute col
umnist.
Many times during the
Stanford-Santa Clara game the
cheerleaders would try to start
chants only to have the Band
deliberately clap off rhythm or
simply heckle them. Is this school
spirit? I am not advocating
replacing the Dollies with the
cheerleaders. Instead, I see no
reason why both groups cannot
co-exist.
If nothing else, the cheer
leaders offer a new look to the
Stanford sports scene. Personally
— and I do not believe for a mo
ment that I am the only one who
feels this way — I find the
Dollies' routines boringly
familiar. Although the cheer
leaders have yet to field a full
squad and are unpolished at
times, at least they offer the
average Stanford student a
change of pace.

preserve a small fraction of it, as
"a vignette of what the Spaniards
saw." Sure. It will be just great to
run, walk, bike, picnic, etc. in a

"vignette" that doesn't have any
of the existing roads/trails going
through it and is nicely situated
between the new buildings and
Junipero Serra Boulevard.
The Planning Office justifies
the proposal on the grounds that
the wording of the founding grant
requires the land to be used for
academic purposes (like expan
sion of the golf course?).
But even if they were sincere in
their intent to follow the wishes of
Jane and Leland, it would be
more appropriate to consider
changing circumstances and the
needs of the Stanford community
than to blindly follow the wording
of the founding grant. Silicon
Valley did not exist when the
grant was written. The "intent"
was to provide the best possible
academic facilities on every piece
of available land.

All or nothing in
equal rights fight
Today's phenomenon of wo
men breaking down male barriers
while keeping their own appears
to have hit Stanford. While
searching for classes to take, I
noticed that there are two types
of weight training courses:
Weight Training and Weight
Training for Women. The former
class is open to both men and
women; the title of the latter
speaks for itself. Surely it is un
derstandable that some women
might feel uncomfortable exercis
ing in front of men. There are
valid social reasons for certain
closed activities. However, when
men desire to exclude women
from a social situation, feminists
demand their "equal rights." Wit
ness the outcry over the all-male
Bohemian Club. Yet no one
protests an all-female club such as
Marin County's Morning Dia

logue. feminists must realize that
their "equal rights" should not be
"one-way rights."

Cheerleaders
lend needed boost
This letter is in response to
Chris Fialko's clever little column
printed in the Dec. 3 issue of The
Daily.
Chris pointed out that the
Maples Pavilion crowd was
"improved but could be better."
He also stated that the Stanford
cheerleaders are "certainly un
necessary." Forgive me if I'm
wrong, but doesn't it make sense
that the Maples Pavilion crowd
may not have been as vocal in the
past because there were no or
ganized spirit leaders to get the
crowd involved? Personally, I
find it puzzling that the obvious
positive correlation between the
cheerleaders' presence and the
improved Maples Pavilion crowd
completely eluded our astute col
umnist.
Many times during the
Stanford-Santa Clara game the
cheerleaders would try to start
chants only to have the Band
deliberately clap off rhythm or
simply heckle them. Is this school
spirit? I am not advocating
replacing the Dollies with the
cheerleaders. Instead, I see no
reason why both groups cannot
co-exist.
If nothing else, the cheer
leaders offer a new look to the
Stanford sports scene. Personally
— and I do not believe for a mo
ment that I am the only one who
feels this way — I find the
Dollies' routines boringly
familiar. Although the cheer
leaders have yet to field a full
squad and are unpolished at
times, at least they offer the
average Stanford student a
change of pace.

Hart could give
morality lessons
The question to ask about Gary
Hart's private life is whether he
can show leadership in self
examination and renunciation. If
he cannot condemn the way those
in power so easily make use of
privilege, if he cannot reject his
own deceptions and cover-ups —
private and public — or explore
why such behavior afflicts men in
the upper reaches of any
hierarchy, if his wife shows her
self too weak and too duped to
withstand his privilege, then he
remains untrustworthy, and she
remains the last lady one should
want as the first.
But if Gary and Lee Hart use
the campaign to expose the
destructiveness of deception and
the inequities of infidelity, then
his candidacy could do the
country's morality a real service,
and his former frame of mind
should cease to damage him.

Save Foothills
for community
We would like to applaud Jen
nifer Hansen's column, "Plea for
the Foothills" (Daily, Nov. 24).
We are appalled that the Univer
sity Planning Office would even
think about developing the Foot
hills. They might have gotten the
message last year that the Stan
ford Community wants to keep
the Foothills. They are a unique
resource, and it would be ex
tremely shortsighted to deprive
future generations of Stanfordites
of this special place.
The Planning Office acknowl
edges that such space is going to
become even more rare in the fu
ture, but thinks it will suffice to
preserve a small fraction of it, as
"a vignette of what the Spaniards
saw." Sure. It will be just great to
run, walk, bike, picnic, etc. in a

"vignette" that doesn't have any
of the existing roads/trails going
through it and is nicely situated
