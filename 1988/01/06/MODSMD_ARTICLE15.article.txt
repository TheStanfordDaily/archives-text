Stanford students all think that they're pretty
damn good. This is no surprise, because in general,
we are pretty damn good. If we weren't, we
wouldn't be here. We are some of the most intelli
gent, talented and personable individuals our age.
People have been telling us this story for the first 20
or so years of our lives, they're telling it to us while
we're at Stanford, and the future holds more of the
same.

But, I must admit, there is something about us
that annoys the hell out of me. It annoys the hell out
of some other Stanford students, too, so I should ex
plain. Stanford students generally think they are not
only pretty damn good, but too damn good, and
consequently they assume this gives them the
license to behave inappropriately.
I'll begin with nagging details about life at Stan
ford. This quarter, you'll notice the Stanford Cold
will make its second round through the University.
Again, the coughing, sneezing, sniffling. But tell me
how many of these coughs, sneezes and sniffles will
be covered with a Kleenex or the back of a hand?
Less than five. We evidently think we are above
having to prevent our germs from infecting others.
That's why Mem Cold travels around so fast.
I was standing in line at Food Service last quarter,
and the student directly behind me sneezed. All
over my tray. She didn't even attempt to cover it or
excuse herself. I asked her who she thought she was
and whose barn she grew up in; then I got a differ
ent tray. Why should I want my food put on that
plate after she coated it with her germs?
This is merely an illustrative incident. How many
times have you sat in a lecture and been treated to
the spray of some stranger's cough or sneeze all over
the back of your neck? More than once, I'm sure.
And then, to heighten the effect, a Stanford
sneeze or cough is always twice as loud and pathetic
as those out in the general population. It's probably
the same at all other major universities, because stu
dents in competitive academic environments jockey
for recognition when given the opportunity.
Such an inflated sneeze or cough is the signal we
used to give our parents when we wanted their at
tention. We were fortunate, by and large, to have
responsive parents who were concerned for our
health and welfare. A prolonged, unproductive
coughing fit used to turn Mom's head when we
wanted her to ask us if we felt all right. We got in-

stant pity, whenever we needed it. Now that we're in
school away from Mom and Dad, we expect such
concern from anyone nearby. Thus, the amplified
coughs and sneezes. Pathetic, isn't it.
Other inexcusable behaviors: We like to talk
down to people whenever given the chance. Not
everyone out there is as smart as ourselves, so we
put things in condescending terms whenever we
really need an ego boost. We love to repeat our
selves. "No, you don't understand, I said . .
One of the leading ideas no one out there can
ever comprehend is the amount of work we have to
have done by Friday. As if each of us were the only
student at this place taking more than one class!
Things are tough all over, and if you really need
support from your friends and peers, confide in
them honestly and release some steam. This place
can be overwhelming and terribly unfair in the
demands it puts on you. But you choose to go to
school here, so if it gets to be too much, get some
counseling or tutoring — the resources are
available.
If you're smart enough to be here, you are smart
enough to get some help when it's necessary.
Whatever you do, though, if you're coping just fine
and all you need is some instant sympathy, don't
whine about how tough your life is. You have no
right to.
You're not alone, and however harsh you try to
make things sound, they're twice as bad for some
body else within earshot. So what if you have three
papers due this week. Someone at the end of the
dinner table has three papers and two midterms and
two problem sets. And they made him move out of
Roble this quarter. Top that.
Now that you feel sufficiently guilty — I'm sure
there isn't a person at this place who hasn't commit
ted one or more of the above offenses — keep in
mind who we really are and how ridiculous it is to
expect special rights for being "so damned good." It
gives you no right to behave irresponsibly, un
professionally or selfishly when you feel you are
above the people you encounter or the situation at
hand.
When you leave Stanford, you won't be able to
excuse your rude or inappropriate behavior like you
can here, with an "Oh, I forgot" or an "It's my
mistake. I'm sorry." The real world is a much more
unforgiving place. To people on the outside, you'll
be just another a inconsiderate dolt lumped with all
the others — they often won't have any reason to
believe you're as "damn good" as you think you are.
After all, we're just people. Being some of the
smartest, most talented and even most personable
doesn't push us above standards of conduct that ap
ply to everyone.
