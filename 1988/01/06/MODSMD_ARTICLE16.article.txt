## Post Office progress proceeding 
### 
We would like to respond to your editorial
concerning the Stanford Post Office titled
"Zip change is not enough" (Daily, Dec. 1).
You are correct when you indicate progress
is being made.

The new zip code will aid in the sorting and
processing of mail. On an average day, the
Post Office receives 25,000 pieces of mail for
the 9050 post office boxes located at the Stan
ford branch. The reason for the new zip code
is to segment this mail from the main flow of
Stanford business and residence mail. As with
any change of this type, compliance will be a
matter of contacting correspondents â€” it will
be gradual, but the benefits will accrue as the
new zip gains wider use.
The Post Office added 2160 post office
boxes this summer. For the first time in many
years, every Stanford student who needs a
post office box can get one. More than 900

boxes are still available, and interested stu
dents should contact Mail and Delivery
Services. We hope you noticed the improved
method of distributing the boxes this year,
which was handled by Stanford's Mail &
Delivery Services in order to ease the burden
on the Post Office.
The Post Office's "trademark long lines"
are in for a reduction, too, with the installa
tion of 454 parcel lockers, new postage ven
ding machines and another window clerk posi
tion for peak periods in the coming days and
weeks. Many of those waiting in line are com
ing to pick up parcels which are too big to fit
in their post office boxes.
Under the new parcel locker plan, parcels
will be placed in parcel lockers, and a note and
key placed in the recipient's post office box.
Box holders will simply take the key and
retrieve their parcel from the locker at any
time and won't have to wait in line any more.
That should reduce some 300 folks per day in
line and afford more convenience at the same
time. Also scheduled for installation are im
proved vending machines which will take a va
riety of bills (up to $20) and dispense postage

in a wide range of denominations.
The University is aware of the limitations of
the current building. The Postal Service leases
the building from the University and has made
requests for improvements. We are now
working on understanding future needs of
both the Postal Service and its University cus
tomers. This needs assessment is being coor
dinated through the University Planning Of
fice and the Campus Center planning group,
which is working with long-term planning is
sues for the core campus area. Mail has in
creased more than 50 percent since 1980, and
almost 18 million pieces of mail are handled
through a facility designed in the 1960s with
much more limited requirements.
We hope that the improvements already
made, as well as those scheduled in the com
ing weeks and under discussion, will increase
the convenience and efficiency of the Stanford
Branch Post Office.
