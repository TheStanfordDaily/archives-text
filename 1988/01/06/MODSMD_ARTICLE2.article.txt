## Walk-on housing spaces are still availiable 
### Vivian Rogers Staff writer 
"I am so very psyched," exclaimed
Tracey Banks, a senior who earned first
choice of availiahle University housing
when she drew the lowest number in last
night's draw for displaced Ruble upper
classmen. "I'm moving in with friends at
Griffin 101!"
Governor's Corner spaces were the first
of over 200 spots filled last night, as nearly
160 ex-Roble residents picked their new
homes for the year. Casa Italiana and
Lathrop followed in popularity. Mirrielees
apartments and Manzanita Park ranked as
the least favored among students.
"The people at Murray are really nice,"
said Bonnie Gutierrez, a senior, "If we
don't get into Governor's Corner, we have
an apartment off campus."
Roble upperclassmen move into their
new residences after I p.m. today. Unoffi
cially, 24 students chose spaces in Gover
nor's Corner. 55 were placed on the Row.
two in Branner, one in Toyon and 45 stu
dents took spaces in Crothers Hall, Croth

ers Memorial. Mirrielees and Manzanita.
The newly assigned residents will be
moving into spaces such as reconfigured
study rooms and dorm libraries, rooms that
could hold additional residents and rooms
vacated by students who left campus
housing this quarter.
About 30 Rohle upperclas; men decided
to live off campus and did not participate in
the draw.
An official count has not been deter
mined, but about 45 spaces left unclaimed
in the Roble draw are still open for walk
on assignments.
There are unfilled spaces in Cro Mem,
Durand, 553 Mayfield, Hurlburt, Kairos,
Manzanita, Mirrielees, Phi Psi and Syn
ergy. A few spaces on the Row that were
only for the emergency housing will be
taken off the list of availiable housing, said
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of Resi
dential Education and director of the
Housing Center. Manzanita may also be
eliminated as a possible choice for walk
ons, he said. The remaining spaces will be

offered to walk-ons in a special
draw Thursday night.
Housing Center staff members
were pleased with the results of
the three-hour selection process.
"We developed a good, fair
system for these students," Whit
ney said. "I think everyone has
tried to make the best out ot the
situation."
However, several Roble stu
dents said they felt the draw
should have given seniors priority
over juniors and sophomores.
"There is no worse feeling than
watching sophomores take your
place," said senior Jonathan
Baylor. "They are getting so
much compensation already, and
seniors get none," he added, re
ferring to the University's deci
sion that Roble sophomores and
juniors will get an additional
guaranteed year of campus
housing, while most seniors will
be graduating.

The Ruble relocation staff
team, headed by Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons, decided that
all Roble students should be
treated equally for the draw to be
fair.
Students tended to choose
residences where there was a
relatively high likelihood ot living
with or near friends. Yost, Mur
ray and the guest cottages at
Governor's Corner, for example,
offered empty rooms for two or
more students near other upper
classmen. Alpha Sigma and ATO
also had spaces for two or more
students but were not as popular.
"The room I had at ATO was
so loud and freezing cold," said
sophomore Jamie Green, who
was housed there temporarily for
the last three days. "There also
was bathroom nearby," she
added.
The University is allowing
Roble students the option of can
celing their housing contracts up
to Feb. 12 if they decide the living
situation in their new residence is
not working out, according to
Whitney.
