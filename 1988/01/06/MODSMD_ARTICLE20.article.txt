## Students lend a SPOONful to feed the hungry 
### Kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
While students return to Stan
ford still smacking their lips over
Mom's holiday cooking, other
Palo Alto residents are going
hungry.
Over 20 million Americans suf
fer from hunger each month, and
10 percent of Bay Area residents
will rely on hunger relief pro
grams this year, according to Rev.
Jim Burklo of the Palo Alto Ur
ban Ministry.
But several Stanford students
are determined to put a dent in
the hunger problem. They have
launched the Stanford Project on
Nutrition, SPOON, which de
livers leftovers from Stanford stu
dent residences to the hungry and
homeless in Palo Alto.
Led by senior Joy Roe and
juniors Doug Abrams and Amira
Leifer, SPOON got off the
ground by recruiting volunteers
from Lambda Nu, Theta Chi, the
Toyon Eating Clubs and nine
other Stanford houses. SPOON
began distributing the leftover
food from these houses to various
Palo Alto hunger relief programs
last quarter.
"All the food going into the
trash can could go to society â€” it
was just a matter of transporta
tion," Leifer said, stressing that
SPOON does not want to feed the
community at the University's ex
pense but only wants to use
otherwise wasted food.
Leifer, who worked at the Fac

ulty Club over the summer, said
she was astounded at how much
good food was thrown away.
"There had to be some way to
prevent all the waste," she said.
Last year Roe worked at a food
closet in Palo Alto, passing out
government supplies to the
hungry. After meeting Abrams,
who regularly delivered leftovers
to the food closet from his eating
club at the Suites, Roe joined in
his effort.
Roe and Abrams finally
teamed up with Leifer this fall to
organize SPOON. With financial
backing from the Public Service
Center, the ASSU and commu
nity donations, SPOON began
recruiting food donors and estab
lished headquarters in a room
donated by the Bridge.
Now, every week, 40 students
bring leftovers from their houses
to the headquarters, where they
weigh it and store it in the
SPOON freezer.
On Fridays, one of the three
SPOON founders drives the lef
tovers to a food closet at All
Saints Episcopal Church in Palo
Alto, sometimes bringing as much
as 40 pounds of food.
"I schedule my classes to work
here on Fridays," said Roe, who
has worked at the food closet in
Palo Alto for the past two years.
"This place is my family," she
said.
Roe said the needy come to the
food closet for eggs, milk and
basic staples to their diet. The
government can dole out only a

limited amount of food to people,
but when SPOON delivers, the
food selection is greater and so is
the quantity, Roe said.
"Do you think they have
chicken today?" asked an 80-
year-old woman as she waited in
the food closet line for Roe to
help with her request.
The woman, who lives alone in
Palo Alto, finally reached the
front of the line, only to learn the
government had not supplied
chicken that week.
But Roe remembered that one
of the Row houses had brought in
a chicken casserole that week.
"SPOON's food is very appro
priate to the need we have. Our
people do not get much meat, and
Stanford food makes them
happy," said Burklo, who works
at a Palo Alto soup kitchen.
The soup kitchen serves 80
meals a week, and 60 of those
meals come from Stanford, he
said.
While students may grumble on
nights when zuchini delight is
served, Burklo said those who
come to the soup kitchen are es
pecially thankful for such "great
food, especially the casseroles."
Besides helping to meet the
needs of the hungry, SPOON also
hopes to educate the campus
community about the needless
waste of food.
"We want to bring speakers to
campus to educate people on
nutritional issues," Leifer said.
"As people develop an under

standing of waste, board fees
could potentially decrease" be
cause students would appreciate
the value of what they consume,
Abrams said.
Abrams has worked with Di
rector of University Food Service
Jim Keeton to incorporate

SPOON's operations with Food
Service's. Abrams said Food Ser
vice is still considering possible
cooperation between the two or
ganizations.
In the meantime, SPOON will
continue to recruit from row
houses, fraternities and eating

clubs, while educating the Stan
ford community at large.
"We want SPOON to become
part of Residential Education,"
Leifer said. "People should feel
like its their project and they are
part of it. We want SPOON to
outlive us."
