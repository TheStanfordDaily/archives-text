## 'News' doesn't quite live up to rave reviews 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
One of the most critically ac
claimed pictures of the year is
"Broadcast News." The New
York Film Critics Circle voted it
Best Picture of the Year, and the
movie's female lead. Holly
Hunter, has been named best
actress by the New York critics,
the Los Angeles Film Critics As
sociation and the National Board
of Review.
In addition, "Broadcast News"
has made a lot of important "ten
best" lists and has received a lot
ot good press, including a
Newsweek cover story about its
accurate, honest depiction of the
hectic ljfe of broadcast jour
nalists. Without a doubt, "Broad
cast News" is a sure-fire nominee
for the Best Picture Oscar.
The movie has also been get
ting a lot of favorable word-of
mouth build-up. It has become
the movie to see, as the lines
around the theater and box office
gross of $16 million in three
weeks of limited release can at
test.
Needless to say, I was excited
about seeing the movie. When I
finally did see it, it wasn't that I
was let down — it was just that I

wasn't elevated to the movie
going heights that I expected to
be.
Don't get me wrong. "Broad
cast News" isn't bad, it's great.
It's just not that great.
In essence, the movie is really a
light, romantic comedy — hardly
the stuff of which truly great
movies are made. From all the
publicity, I guess I was expecting
"Citizen Kane II" or something,
but it's really not fair to judge a
movie on the basis of the press it
gets.
It would be difficult for any
movie to live up to that kind of
hype, but it's not hard to see why
critics are falling all over them
selves to praise "Broadcast
News."
It is an intelligent, witty, well
written movie with great
performances by Hunter, William
Hurt and Albert Brooks.
The movie centers on the emo
tional triangle between the three
main characters. Hunter is Jane
Craig, a talented young news
producer who is totally absorbed
with her work; Hurt is Tom
Grunick, a handsome but dim
witted anchorman whose good
looks and camera presence have
catapulted him to the top in spite
of his lack of ability; and Brooks

is Aaron Altman, an intelligent,
sharp reporter who lacks the
charisma to be an anchor.
Jane and Aaron are best
friends who share the view that
good news is hard news. When
Jane and Tom meet, Jane is in
stantly attracted to him despite
the fact that he stands for every
thing she is against.
Situations like this are not
foreign to the film's director, sit
com veteran James Brooks, who
swept the Oscars a few years back
with "Terms of Endearment."
The best thing Brooks does here
is the way he resolves the triangle.
I won't reveal it, but it's not the
way you expect triangles in ro
mantic comedies to be resolved.
The part of Jane Craig is truly a
star-making role, and Hunter
makes the most of it with a gutsy,
energetic performance. She un
doubtedly will receive an Oscar
nomination for Best Actress.
However, the performance I
liked the most is Hurt's. Movie
goers are probably accustomed to
seeing Hurt in roles as intelligent,
articulate teachers; it's a nice
change of pace to see him playing
a character who is not-too-bright,
not good at expressing himself
and not the hero.

Not to be overlooked is Albert
Brooks' effective performance as
the smart-ass reporter. Since
Aaron is an underdog character,
you feel obliged to like him, but
he's so abrasive and sometimes so
cruel to Jane and Tom that he
plays against your expectations of
what his role should be.
The interplay of these complex
characters is definitely the film's
highlight. There are some inter
esting scenes about the frenzied
life of a news bureau, but these
scenes take a back seat to the
meat of the movie, the relation
ships.
Overall, I liked the movie; I
definitely think it's one of the bet
ter movies I've seen, since there
have been very few quality main
stream movies this year. I usually
tend to avoid the elite, "prestige"
pictures like "Prick Up Your
Ears" and "Jean de Florette," for
fear that I might actually like
them.
I think most critics, and cer
tainly American audiences, tend
to latch on to mainstream movies
as well, which probably accounts
for why "Broadcast News" has
received so much attention.
Things could have been worse,
though — all this hype could have
been wasted on a bad movie.
