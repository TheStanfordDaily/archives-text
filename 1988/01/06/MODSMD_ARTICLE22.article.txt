# A 						terrible 'Baby' is pampered at box office
## 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
Against my better judgement, I fi
nally saw "Three Men and a Baby." I
wish I hadn't.
The only reason I saw it in the first
place was that I had to see for myself
why this movie has grossed almost
$84 million in six weeks. I had to ftnd
out what sort of appeal this movie has
that would make it the fourth-biggest
moneymaker of the year.
The film got a few favorable
reviews, so at the very least I was ex
pecting a light, mindless, entertaining

piece of fluff. What I got instead was
a thin, boring, contrived plot that
does nothing more than milk the
"grown men trying to diaper the
baby'' scenes for all they're worth.
I'm still at a loss to explain the suc
cess of this movie. Sure, it has a baby
arui it has Tom Selleck, and the
teenage girls in the movie theater
were always saying "Oooh, how cute"
whenever either of them appeared on
the screen; but is that enough to pull
in $84 million?
Apparently so. According to the
people who follow social trends,
we're at a time when the family unit is

becoming important again, when
yuppies are thinking about settling
down and having kids, and when the
"Rambo" man is out of vogue.
More than anything, then, this
movie reflects the mood of contem
porary American society. But again,
that still isn't enough to show why this
movie is doing so much business and
repeat business.
I don't know why I don't like this
movie, I'm just about the only one
who doesn't. Maybe I'm just too cyni
cal, maybe I don't like having my
"Oooh, how cute" responses manip

ulated whenever a baby comes on
screen, or maybe I'm too picky about
what I like in a movie â€” a good plot,
interesting characters, well-written
dialogue.
At any rate, the movie is doing well
and will continue to do well so long as
the American public is content to be
mindlessly entertained by movies that
are neat, pat, comfortable and pres
ent no challenge whatsoever.
Overall, I think the mystifying suc
cess of this movie perfectly supports
Menken's old adage that "no one
ever went broke underestimating the
intelligence of the American public."
