# Sibling rivalry spurs conflict over 'Momma'
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
I took my little brother Jason to
see "Throw Momma From The
Train," starring Danny DeVito
and Billy Crystal, and we decided
that we should each write a
review so readers could be twice
as confused about the movie. To
begin (so you will know whose
review to agree with), we have in
cluded little personality 'sketches
so you can get to know our enter
tainment likes and dislikes:
Andrew likes: Bananarama,
Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, Belinda
Carlisle, Gloria Estefan and
Miami Sound Machine (notice a
trend forming here?), "Air
plane," "Tootsie," "Broadcast
News," "Kentucky Fried Movie,"
"L.A. Law," Monday Night
Baseball and pastrami.
Jason likes: Metallica, Slayer,
Anthrax, Megadeth, Storm
troopers of Death, Method of
Destruction, Nuclear Assault,
Death Angel, "Faces of Death,"
"Nightmare on Elm Street (and
sequels)," "Friday the 13th (parts
I-XVIII)" "Transformers,"
"MTV Headbangers' Ball" and
pastrami.

Best Jason quote of Christmas
break: "Nancy Wilson (of rock
group "Heart") has too much
radness for one chick. If you
divided her into thirds, I'd still go
out with one of them."
Andrew's brief plot summary:
Crystal's ex-wife has stolen his
novel and published it, hence be
coming famous and obnoxious.
DeVito's mother (played ghoul
ishly by Anne Ramsey) is a com
plete witch and makes his life
miserable. DeVito devises a
devious and dastardly plot
wherein each man will murder the
other's nag.
Jason's brief plot summary:
Billy Crystal's ex-wife is a nob,
and Danny DeVito's mother is a
hose-beast. So, while Crystal is
teaching this nobby creative
writing class that is totally death,
this groping student played by
DeVito plans to waste the nobs,
and it's totally kill.
Andrew's opinion of the movie:
When I first saw the movie I
found it to be reasonably enter
taining. I like Billy Crystal and
Danny DeVito. I mean, it's pretty
much an average comedy. DeVito
wrote, directed, and starred in the
film, which means that he is now

just like Warren Beatty, except
Warren Beatty's sister was a kan
garoo spleen in a previous life.
DeVito has created a really pa
thetic character: Here's a 40-
year-old guy still being bossed
around by his mother.
Without a doubt the best thing
about the film is Anne Ramsey's
role as Momma. She is the
scariest, most hideous thing to hit
the big screen since the sand
worms in "Dune." A great role!
My favorite scene in the movie
is the one in which Crystal is
teaching a community college
creative writing course, and the
class gets into an argument over
whether pornography is experi
mental art. Beautiful.
Jason's opinion of the movie:
Unfortunately, in my entire il
lustrious career of watching
movies, I've only seen two I
didn't like: One was in Polish, the
other was "Room With A View."
I mean, let's be serious: I even
liked "Dune." A lot. I saw it
three times. Granted, I never saw
"Ishtar," but I like Dustin Hoff
man. He's short; reminds me of
Andrew.
So there we were, in the dark
ened movie theater. The movie

had just ended; the credits were
dying out. Andrew asked, "So,
Jason, what did you think?" as if I
would say, "Well, Andrew, that
comedy we just saw was even
more boring than a movie in
Polish."
But no. Instead, I turned my
head toward him and muttered,
as only a true Metallica fan could,
"Kill!" (Note: For all you knee
biters out there, that means
"Good!")
Now, I'm a 16-year-old. Any
movie about brutally murdering a
mother is great for me.
Anyone who dislikes comedy,
action, adventure, or a good
laugh, should definitely go see
"Room With A View"; other
wise, this is the movie for you.
Andrew's final rating on the
five-squid scale: I thought the
movie was just an average com
edy, especially when seen after
the awesome "Broadcast News."
"Broadcast News" is a must-see,
but I was disappointed by 'Throw
Momma From The Train." I give
it two-and-a-half squids.
Jason's final rating on the five
squid scale: I thought the movie
was rad and totally kill. I give it
three-and-seven-eighths squids.

this groping student played by
DeVito plans to waste the nobs,
and it's totally kill.
Andrew's opinion of the movie:
When I first saw the movie I
found it to be reasonably enter
taining. I like Billy Crystal and
Danny DeVito. I mean, it's pretty
much an average comedy. DeVito
wrote, directed, and starred in the
film, which means that he is now

just like Warren Beatty, except
Warren Beatty's sister was a kan
garoo spleen in a previous life.
DeVito has created a really pa
thetic character: Here's a 40-
year-old guy still being bossed
around by his mother.
Without a doubt the best thing
about the film is Anne Ramsey's
role as Momma. She is the
scariest, most hideous thing to hit
the big screen since the sand
worms in "Dune." A great role!
My favorite scene in the movie
is the one in which Crystal is
teaching a community college
creative writing course, and the
class gets into an argument over
whether pornography is experi
mental art. Beautiful.
Jason's opinion of the movie:
Unfortunately, in my entire il
lustrious career of watching
movies, I've only seen two I
didn't like: One was in Polish, the
other was "Room With A View."
I mean, let's be serious: I even
liked "Dune." A lot. I saw it
three times. Granted, I never saw
"Ishtar," but I like Dustin Hoff
man. He's short; reminds me of
Andrew.
So there we were, in the dark
ened movie theater. The movie

had just ended; the credits were
dying out. Andrew asked, "So,
Jason, what did you think?" as if I
would say, "Well, Andrew, that
comedy we just saw was even
more boring than a movie in
Polish."
But no. Instead, I turned my
head toward him and muttered,
as only a true Metallica fan could,
"Kill!" (Note: For all you knee
biters out there, that means
"Good!")
Now, I'm a 16-year-old. Any
movie about brutally murdering a
mother is great for me.
Anyone who dislikes comedy,
action, adventure, or a good
laugh, should definitely go see
"Room With A View"; other
wise, this is the movie for you.
Andrew's final rating on the
five-squid scale: I thought the
movie was just an average com
edy, especially when seen after
the awesome "Broadcast News."
"Broadcast News" is a must-see,
but I was disappointed by 'Throw
Momma From The Train." I give
it two-and-a-half squids.
Jason's final rating on the five
squid scale: I thought the movie
was rad and totally kill. I give it
three-and-seven-eighths squids.

The face that launched a thousand murder attempts: Anne Ramsey a
Momma in "Throw Momma From the Train."
I took my little brother Jason to
see "Throw Momma From The
Train," starring Danny DeVito
and Billy Crystal, and we decided
that we should each write a
review so readers could be twice
as confused about the movie. To
begin (so you will know whose
review to agree with), we have in
cluded little personality 'sketches
so you can get to know our enter
tainment likes and dislikes:
Andrew likes: Bananarama,
Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, Belinda
Carlisle, Gloria Estefan and
Miami Sound Machine (notice a
trend forming here?), "Air
plane," "Tootsie," "Broadcast
News," "Kentucky Fried Movie,"
"L.A. Law," Monday Night
Baseball and pastrami.
Jason likes: Metallica, Slayer,
Anthrax, Megadeth, Storm
troopers of Death, Method of
Destruction, Nuclear Assault,
Death Angel, "Faces of Death,"
"Nightmare on Elm Street (and
sequels)," "Friday the 13th (parts
I-XVIII)" "Transformers,"
"MTV Headbangers' Ball" and
pastrami.

Best Jason quote of Christmas
break: "Nancy Wilson (of rock
group "Heart") has too much
radness for one chick. If you
divided her into thirds, I'd still go
out with one of them."
Andrew's brief plot summary:
Crystal's ex-wife has stolen his
novel and published it, hence be
coming famous and obnoxious.
DeVito's mother (played ghoul
ishly by Anne Ramsey) is a com
plete witch and makes his life
miserable. DeVito devises a
devious and dastardly plot
wherein each man will murder the
other's nag.
Jason's brief plot summary:
Billy Crystal's ex-wife is a nob,
and Danny DeVito's mother is a
hose-beast. So, while Crystal is
teaching this nobby creative
writing class that is totally death,
this groping student played by
DeVito plans to waste the nobs,
and it's totally kill.
