## Tahoe vacations in a nutshell 
### 
The topic for today is skiing.
It's pretty good this year,
after a mediocre season last
year, and droves of people are
flocking to Tahoe to take ad
vantage of fresh powder.
I was among the herd that
took Interstate 80 up there
over break, and despite spin
ning out on the way up (no, I
wasn't doing the driving, and
yes, we had chains on), getting
stuck in a tremendous traffic
jam on the way back and wind
ing up with a cold to boot, it
was still worth it.

It's amazing the things
people will go through to get
out on the slopes for a few
hours. My (so-called) friends
dragged me out of bed at 8
a.m. New Year's Day — after
spending New Year's Eve at
the casinos in South Lake
Tahoe — to ski all day in sub
zero temperatures. (This, no
doubt, explains my cold.)
I even missed most of the
New Year's bowl games, al
though I will admit 1 was get
ting a little over-saturated with
football during vacation,
anyway. Still, there I was,
freezing to death on the top of
a mountain instead of sitting in

a warm room watching USC
lose.
Others went to further
lengths. A friend of mine is a
dealer in a casino (a card
dealer) and works from mid
night to 8 a.m. No problem,
she just skis when she gets off
work. Who needs sleep? (This
same insane person also has
two other jobs.)
People are braving 10-hour
drives to Tahoe because of the
fresh powder. There are a
couple feet (at least) of new
snow, and if you make it up
there on a day when it isn't ac
tually snowing, it's often sunny
and absolutely perfect skiing
weather.
Obviously, it's a great time
to go, so here's a quick and ex
tremely unscientific review of
some of the different resorts if
you're planning to make the
long trek to Tahoe.
Heavenly Valley: The biggest
resort and the most centrally
located to South Shore,
Heavenly is convenient but full
of tourists. This means that it is
far more expensive than other
places — in fact, lift tickets
were $29 before the Christmas
snowfall, but when the crowds
started flocking in, the resort
raised the price to $32. How
considerate. If you're a really
good skier, Heavenly might
not be worth the money. It has
expert runs, but the vast
majority of runs are intermedi
ate.
