## Tahoe vacations in a nutshell 
### 
The topic for today is skiing.
It's pretty good this year,
after a mediocre season last
year, and droves of people are
flocking to Tahoe to take ad
vantage of fresh powder.
I was among the herd that
took Interstate 80 up there
over break, and despite spin
ning out on the way up (no, I
wasn't doing the driving, and
yes, we had chains on), getting
stuck in a tremendous traffic
jam on the way back and wind
ing up with a cold to boot, it
was still worth it.

It's amazing the things
people will go through to get
out on the slopes for a few
hours. My (so-called) friends
dragged me out of bed at 8
a.m. New Year's Day — after
spending New Year's Eve at
the casinos in South Lake
Tahoe — to ski all day in sub
zero temperatures. (This, no
doubt, explains my cold.)
I even missed most of the
New Year's bowl games, al
though I will admit 1 was get
ting a little over-saturated with
football during vacation,
anyway. Still, there I was,
freezing to death on the top of
a mountain instead of sitting in

a warm room watching USC
lose.
Others went to further
lengths. A friend of mine is a
dealer in a casino (a card
dealer) and works from mid
night to 8 a.m. No problem,
she just skis when she gets off
work. Who needs sleep? (This
same insane person also has
two other jobs.)
People are braving 10-hour
drives to Tahoe because of the
fresh powder. There are a
couple feet (at least) of new
snow, and if you make it up
there on a day when it isn't ac
tually snowing, it's often sunny
and absolutely perfect skiing
weather.
Obviously, it's a great time
to go, so here's a quick and ex
tremely unscientific review of
some of the different resorts if
you're planning to make the
long trek to Tahoe.
Heavenly Valley: The biggest
resort and the most centrally
located to South Shore,
Heavenly is convenient but full
of tourists. This means that it is
far more expensive than other
places — in fact, lift tickets
were $29 before the Christmas
snowfall, but when the crowds
started flocking in, the resort
raised the price to $32. How
considerate. If you're a really
good skier, Heavenly might
not be worth the money. It has
expert runs, but the vast
majority of runs are intermedi
ate.

Squaw Valley: The Olympic
resort. It's worth the trip to the
other side of the lake at least
once, even though lift tickets are
about $30, just because of the
large number of good runs and, of
course, the tram cars or gondolas
(or whatever they are). It's
crowded, but if you take enough
lifts, you can usually find pretty
isolated runs.
Kirkwood: That's where I spent

last week, and it was great.
Kirkwood is a little out of the way
(about an hour from South Shore
depending on traffic) but it is
reputed to get the first and best
snow of the season. It's not as
crowded as Heavenly or Squaw,
and there's a good mix of expert,
intermediate and beginning runs.
The prices are also lower; lift
tickets are $27.
Alpine Meadows: It had a
deadly avalance a few years ago
and doesn't have the best skiing.
Don't make the trip if you're on
the other side of the lake, but it's
adequate if you're already on

North Shore.
Sugar Bowl: Not the football
game in which Auburn gutlessly
went for a tie. It's much better. In
fact, it's absolutely ideal. Unfor
tunately, it's way out of the way.
It's north of Tahoe, and you actu
ally have to park your car and
take a gondola to get to the
resort. It's expensive, too —
that's why I haven't been there
since I stopped skiing with my
family and started paying for ski
trips on my own. If you can afford
the effort and the money, it's ab
solutely gorgeous and never
packed with crowds.

Others: I've never been to
Sierra Ski Ranch but understand
that it's perfect for less experi
enced skiiers. Mount Rose in
Nevada is rated fairly high and is
not as crowded or as expensive as
the California resorts.
This is just a partial list, but
overall I'd have to recommend
Kirkwood and Squaw. Remem
ber to call ahead for road and ski
conditions if you do go on a ski
trip and don't forget chains!
(They'll make you buy them for
exorbitant prices if they're re
quired and you don't have them.)
Break a leg!
