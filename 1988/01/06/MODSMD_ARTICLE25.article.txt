# Ultimate frisbee kicks into gear
## 
### Robert Pardington Staff writer 
Frisbees criss-cross Roble Field
each weekday as the Stanford ul
timate frisbee team warms up for
the coming season.
The experienced Cardinal
returns everyone from a team
that finished ranked ninth nation
ally last year, after starting the
season No. 3. This spring, Stan
ford looks to regain the national
championship it won in 1984 in
the first year of the official college
nationals. In 1986, the Cardinal
was runner-up.
And Stanford's high rating
from years past isn't likely to
change this season.
"Stanford is now one of the
more experienced teams," co
captain Keith Sarkisian said.
"Most of the guys who start have
been playing two years."
Regarded as the star of the
team, quarterback Scotty Smal
lwood directs the Cardinal with
near-perfect throws.
Stanford plays both college and
club teams at open-division tour
naments during the fall and win
ter.
Five of the top six ranked
teams nationwide are on the West
Coast, including rival UC-Santa
Barbara. In October, Stanford
lost to UCSB in the finals of a
tournament in San Diego.
This weekend, the Cardinal
takes on powers California, UC-
Santa Barbara, Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo and UC-Santa Cruz at a
tournament in San Luis Obispo.
All ultimate contests come un
der the juristiction of the Ultim
ate Players Association, which
now has over 4500 members. Ul
timate frisbee has grown so much
in popularity worldwide that it is

now an Olympic sport, to be
played in Seoul this summmer.
The sport is played on a 40-by
-70-yard patch of grass, with an
end zone on each side of the field.
Teams of seven attempt to pass
the frisbee from player to player
toward the opponent's end zone
for a score. The victor scores 15
goals first.
The catch is that a player can
not move while he has the frisbee.

Four "quarterbacks" control the
action, trying to find an open
"deep" man to advance or score.
Because of the fast pace of the
game, set plays are next to impos
sible to plan. Matches last
anywhere from 40 minutes to two
hours.
"There is one, on-going play,"
Sarkisian said. "We weave back
and forth, looking for a deep."
Although ultimate frisbee is a

fairly new sport, Stanford has
fielded a team for over 10 years.
Forty players practice with the
team, which narrows down to a
traveling squad of 16 for tourna
ments.
During spring break, Stanford
will compete in the National Col
legiate Sports Festival in Florida.
Everything points to the college
nationals at Santa Barbara in
May.
