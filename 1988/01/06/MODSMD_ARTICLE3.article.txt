# Roble closing
## Officials concede inspection was slow 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
The University "could have and should
have acted more quickly" in determining
whether Roble Hall was safe for its 294
student occupants, John Hughes, associate
vice provost for Planning and Manage
ment, said yesterday.
"We could have provided more informa
tion more quickly" to Rutherford and
Chekene, the San Francisco engineering
firm hired to determine Roble's seismic
safety, Hughes said. "And we could have
asked them to move more quickly."
The University closed Roble, its oldest
and largest dormitory, on the final day of
fall quarter exams after it was determined a
week earlier, on Dec. 1 1, that the building
was not earthquake safe. Six months ear
lier, the University discovered that some
the dorm's walls were not constructed of
reinforced concrete but hollow clay tiles,
which are less stable.
Hughes said the University would have
acted sooner had it known that the prob
lem was so serious. The University and the
engineering firm were working at a
"normal pace," and, at the time, it did not
seem necessary to go into "crash mode and
act quickly," he said.
Curtis Williams, director of Facilities
Project Management, also said the Univer
sity would have increased the pace of infor
mation gathering if it had known that
Roble was dangerous. "The only thing is
pace," he said. "We would have taken the
same steps but increased the pace."
Williams speculated that the process of
determining the safety of Roble could have
been shortened by about "a couple of
months." However, it would have been dif
ficult to have recognized the risk in Roble
before the start of fall quarter, when
Roble's 294 students moved in.
Hughes stressed that the responsiblity
for the speed of the project is "internal to
Stanford" and not the fault of Rutherford
and Chekene. In retrospect, Hughes said
he would have asked the engineering firm
to provide a "more concentrated" effort on
the project.
Ryan said the firm was "quite
responsive" in taking action. When a photo
of Roble during construction was discov
ered clearly showing the precarious hollow
clay tiles in the walls, Ryan and the firm
were able to "basically make the assess
ment in six minutes" that Roble was
unsafe.
Rutherford and Chekene refused to
comment but a civil engineer from a com
peting firm said he thought the University
took "reasonable" action. "It would have
been unwise to tell people to get out with
out getting enough information," said
Steve Harris, who works for EQE, Inc.
Until the construction photograph was

discovered, the University did not realize
that Roble ran an "unacceptability high
risk" of collapsing during a major earth
quake and would have to be evacuated.
"Until you get the evidence, you can't
know there will be a problem," Hughes
said.
Hughes identified the problem of deter
mining the "urgency" of the situation as
"the lack of as-built plans." Because the
structural plans of the building could not
be found, the University did not know that
hollow clay tiles were used throughout the
structure and that the building's heavy con
crete floors would put too much stress on
the exterior walls in a major earthquake.

According to Williams, at the time when
the hollow clay tiles were discovered in
some of the walls, it seemed "[the Univer
sity was] being prudent in the steps we
were taking." The partitions between
rooms were then thought to provide a "fair
amount of support," and the concrete
floors were not known to be as heavy as
they were, he said.
University officials involved in a cam
puswide seismic survey that began two
years ago said they were shocked by Rut
herford and Chekene's Dec. 11 recom
mendation to close Roble immediately.
"None of us expected it," Hughes said. "It
was a total surprise."
Within three days Stanford's next two
oldest dormitories, Branner and Toyon
halls, were tested, even though the struc
tural plans show the two residences, con
structed in 1924, were built with reinforced
concrete. Holes drilled in the dorms' walls
by the University showed the plans to be
accurate.
The University verified that Lagunita
Court, built in 1937, is made of a seismi
cally safe light-steel frame.

Stanford" and not the fault of Rutherford
and Chekene. In retrospect, Hughes said
he would have asked the engineering firm
to provide a "more concentrated" effort on
the project.
Ryan said the firm was "quite
responsive" in taking action. When a photo
of Roble during construction was discov
ered clearly showing the precarious hollow
clay tiles in the walls, Ryan and the firm
were able to "basically make the assess
ment in six minutes" that Roble was
unsafe.
Rutherford and Chekene refused to
comment but a civil engineer from a com
peting firm said he thought the University
took "reasonable" action. "It would have
been unwise to tell people to get out with
out getting enough information," said
Steve Harris, who works for EQE, Inc.
Until the construction photograph was

discovered, the University did not realize
that Roble ran an "unacceptability high
risk" of collapsing during a major earth
quake and would have to be evacuated.
"Until you get the evidence, you can't
know there will be a problem," Hughes
said.
Hughes identified the problem of deter
mining the "urgency" of the situation as
"the lack of as-built plans." Because the
structural plans of the building could not
be found, the University did not know that
hollow clay tiles were used throughout the
structure and that the building's heavy con
crete floors would put too much stress on
the exterior walls in a major earthquake.

According to Williams, at the time when
the hollow clay tiles were discovered in
some of the walls, it seemed "[the Univer
sity was] being prudent in the steps we
were taking." The partitions between
rooms were then thought to provide a "fair
amount of support," and the concrete
floors were not known to be as heavy as
they were, he said.
University officials involved in a cam
puswide seismic survey that began two
years ago said they were shocked by Rut
herford and Chekene's Dec. 11 recom
mendation to close Roble immediately.
"None of us expected it," Hughes said. "It
was a total surprise."
Within three days Stanford's next two
oldest dormitories, Branner and Toyon
halls, were tested, even though the struc
tural plans show the two residences, con
structed in 1924, were built with reinforced
concrete. Holes drilled in the dorms' walls
by the University showed the plans to be
accurate.
The University verified that Lagunita
Court, built in 1937, is made of a seismi
cally safe light-steel frame.
