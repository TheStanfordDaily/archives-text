# Group seeks names of victims
## AIDS service scheduled 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
A committee of students, fac
ulty and staff is seeking the names
of members of the Stanford com
munity who have died of AIDS in
an effort to commemorate them
at a Feb. 18 service in Memorial
Auditorium.
The AIDS Commemoration
and Celebration Committee is
trying to reach relatives of fac
ulty, staff and alumni victims of
acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS) throughout the
world by telephoning contacts in
major cities and publishing
nationwide press releases, ac
cording to Michael Ramsey-
Perez, director of Student Organ
ization Services.
"It is important for a commu
nity to express that is cares about
these people," Ramsey-Perez
said. "The service gives an oppor
tunity for the community to ad
dress the needs of those who are
living and to celebrate the names
of those who died."
Ramsey-Perez and senior Dan
Bao, a committee member, said
they are pleased with the

response to the effort, which has
included generous offers of time
and financial support.
The group compiled its first list,
which consisted of eight names,
last June when "Project Names,"
a national organization that
searched for and built a memorial
with the names of AIDS victims
nationwide, asked Ramsey-Perez
to research AIDS deaths in the
Stanford area.
After receiving numerous calls
from relatives of AIDS victims
connected to Stanford but not in
cluded on the Project Names'
lists, Ramsey-Perez realized the
need for a local commemorative
effort.
Since then, according to
Ramsey-Perez, the committee
has increased its list to 15. He did
not know how many more victims
the group will find in the future.
The list includes late Stanford
community members Dr. Tom
Waddell, a post-doctoral fellow at
Stanford Hospital, and English
Prof. Don Howard, an expert on
Chaucer, he said.
In addition to names, the group
is hoping to receive letters, brief
essays and other creative efforts

recalling the AIDS victims.
Ramsey-Perez said he has already
received one "heartbreaking"
anonymous letter about a Stan
ford alumnus who died of AIDS.
The committee will display these
items at the service and will then
place them in the University Ar
chives.
The service will not he of a reli
gious nature, Bao said. "It will be
a commemorative and
celebratory service to allow
people in the Stanford commu
nity to express their emotions,"
Bao said.
Because AIDS is a social
stigma, Bao said, many AIDS vic
tims are reluctant to have the
cause of their death declared
publicly and thus die "silently."
Due to this, "Stanford hasn't
been able to grieve for these
people," he said.
The committee will also host a
benefit concert in Memorial
Church in the evening after the
commemorative service to raise
money for the Aris Project in
Santa Clara County and the El
lipse Center in San Mateo
County, two AIDS human service
organizations.
