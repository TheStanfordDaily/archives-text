Violent protests resume in Israel
JERUSALEM — Israeli soldiers opened fire twice yesterday
on Arabs in the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, killing an 18-
year-old man and wounding eight others as violent protests
erupted again in the occupied territories over Israel's plan to ex
pel nine Palestinian activists.
The West Bank and Gaza, which last week appeared to be
calming down, have now been hit by three straight days of new
violence following the government's announcement Sunday of
the expulsion orders and the shooting death that same day of a
Palestinian woman in an Arab suburb of Jerusalem.
Israeli soldiers have shot dead at least 24 Palestinians and
wounded more than 180 during the riots, which are beginning
their fifth week.
Yesterday's worst violence was in Khan Yunis, scene of
sporadic protests, tire burning and stone throwing since Israel
said it would expel Hasan Ghanim Abu Shakra, a Moslem fun
damentalist leader active in a radical group known as Salifiyyun.
Abu Shakra's supporters hit the streets again yesterday morn
ing, burning tires and stoning vehicles, witnesses said. Israeli sol
diers at first employed the tactics the army has increasingly used
in the past two weeks, watching from the periphery and occasion
ally firing tear gas or using a water cannon against small groups of
rioters.
At around noon dozens of residents marched to Abu Shakra's
house and then on to a local mosque. On the way, they came
upon an army patrol and began pelting soldiers with stones, ac
cording to the army's account.
Bush lashes out at chief rival Dole
WASHINGTON — George Bush, who has suffered unrelent
ing criticism for his passive role as vice president from his fellow
contenders for the Republican presidential nomination, yester
day unloaded on Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, his chief
rival and critic.
"Tell him to get off my back," Bush said in response to a ques
tion after a foreign policy speech in Washington. Bush defended
his achievements as a businessman and government executive
and charged that Dole's 27-year congressional career is not ade
quate preparation for the presidency.
"I'm not sure that being in Congress all your life is part of the
answer. I think it may be part of the problem," Bush said. "We're
running for president. That's an executive branch job."
Bush served two terms in the House in the late 19605,,
representing the wealthy Houston suburbs, then twice ran un
successfully for the Senate. Before becoming vice president, he
held a series of appointed jobs, including Republican Party na
tional chairman, director of central intelligence and U.S. repre
sentative to China and the United Nations.
In public opinion polls, Bush and Dole are far ahead of the
other four GOP contenders, Rep. Jack Kemp, former Delaware
Gov. Pierre "Pete" du Pont IV, former Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig Jr. and former television evangelist Pat Robertson.
The vice president had refrained from criticizing his GOP
rivals in the campaign, but the gloves came off yesterday.
Pittsburgh copes with oil spill
PITTSBURGH — Thousands of suburban residents melted
snow for drinking and braved the cold to collect water from mili
tary tank trucks yesterday as one of the worst river-borne oil
spills on record stretched for 65 miles along two rivers.
However, the oil slick appeared to dissipate somewhat yester
day, reducing threats to community water supplies from here to
Cincinnati.
Shortly after an observation helicopter flight late in the after
noon, U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Todd Nelson said, "The
slick looks 100 percent better than yesterday."
The 1 million-gallon oil spill, created when a storage tank col
lapsed Saturday, was flowing down the Monongahela River to
Pittsburgh and into the Ohio River. At least 83,000 people have
been affected by cut-offs or diminishing supplies of water, and
experts say there is a potential for 500,000 in the Pittsburgh area
to be threatened if the crisis persists into next week.
Residents of the most threatened areas have depleted food
stores' supplies of bottled watter and have turned to soft drinks
and Perrier.
"It's close to panicky, with people not being sure where their
water will come from, said Joseph Faccenda, an executive with
the Giant Eagle supermarket chain.
Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey declared a "disaster emer
gency" in parts of three affected counties and mandated "severe
reductions" in water use for both citizens and private businesses.
Defendants appear at hijack trial
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Five Palestinians on trial for
hijacking a Pan American airliner in Karachi more than a year
ago declared in court yesterday that they had seized the plane
with the intention of blowing it up over Israel after securing the
release of Palestinians from Israeli prisons.
On Sept. 5, 1986, hijackers held about 400 passengers on a
New York-bound Boeing 747 hostage for 17 hours. At that
point, gunfire and grenade explosions attributed by Pakistan and
witnesses to the hijackers killed 21 and wounded 100. Several
other passengers had been wounded at the outset of the
takeover.
The defendants' lengthy statement, laced with sharp attacks on
Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, sought to defend
the action as justifiable because of what it termed the oppression
of Palestinians at the hands of "Americans and Zionists."
The five said they had intended to release the passengers on
the plane and that the incident had ended with heavy casualties
only when Pakistani commandos stormed the aircraft.
The hijackers started firing when lights on the aircraft began to
dim and then went out as a generator supplying power ran out of
fuel. One Pakistani official first claimed that a commando unit
had stormed the plane but others quickly backtracked, saying a
unit had been on alert but that it was not near the aircraft when
the hijackers panicked and opened fire.
Hoop great Maravich is dead at 40
"Pistol Pete" Maravich, 40, the greatest scorer in college bas
ketball history and a dazzling ball-handler, died yesterday of a
heart attack suffered during a pickup basketball game in
Pasadena.
Maravich, who scored a record 3667 points in 1968-70 at
Louisiana State University, for a 44.2 career points-per-game
average, collapsed between informal half-court games at the First
Church of the Nazarene in Pasadena. He was taken to St Luke
Medical Center in Pasadena where doctors tried unsuccessfully
to revive him for 50 minutes.

Yesterday's worst violence was in Khan Yunis, scene of
sporadic protests, tire burning and stone throwing since Israel
said it would expel Hasan Ghanim Abu Shakra, a Moslem fun
damentalist leader active in a radical group known as Salifiyyun.
Abu Shakra's supporters hit the streets again yesterday morn
ing, burning tires and stoning vehicles, witnesses said. Israeli sol
diers at first employed the tactics the army has increasingly used
in the past two weeks, watching from the periphery and occasion
ally firing tear gas or using a water cannon against small groups of
rioters.
At around noon dozens of residents marched to Abu Shakra's
house and then on to a local mosque. On the way, they came
upon an army patrol and began pelting soldiers with stones, ac
cording to the army's account.
Bush lashes out at chief rival Dole
WASHINGTON — George Bush, who has suffered unrelent
ing criticism for his passive role as vice president from his fellow
contenders for the Republican presidential nomination, yester
day unloaded on Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, his chief
rival and critic.
"Tell him to get off my back," Bush said in response to a ques
tion after a foreign policy speech in Washington. Bush defended
his achievements as a businessman and government executive
and charged that Dole's 27-year congressional career is not ade
quate preparation for the presidency.
"I'm not sure that being in Congress all your life is part of the
answer. I think it may be part of the problem," Bush said. "We're
running for president. That's an executive branch job."
Bush served two terms in the House in the late 19605,,
representing the wealthy Houston suburbs, then twice ran un
successfully for the Senate. Before becoming vice president, he
held a series of appointed jobs, including Republican Party na
tional chairman, director of central intelligence and U.S. repre
sentative to China and the United Nations.
In public opinion polls, Bush and Dole are far ahead of the
other four GOP contenders, Rep. Jack Kemp, former Delaware
Gov. Pierre "Pete" du Pont IV, former Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig Jr. and former television evangelist Pat Robertson.
The vice president had refrained from criticizing his GOP
rivals in the campaign, but the gloves came off yesterday.
Pittsburgh copes with oil spill
PITTSBURGH — Thousands of suburban residents melted
snow for drinking and braved the cold to collect water from mili
tary tank trucks yesterday as one of the worst river-borne oil
spills on record stretched for 65 miles along two rivers.
However, the oil slick appeared to dissipate somewhat yester
day, reducing threats to community water supplies from here to
Cincinnati.
Shortly after an observation helicopter flight late in the after
noon, U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Todd Nelson said, "The
slick looks 100 percent better than yesterday."
The 1 million-gallon oil spill, created when a storage tank col
lapsed Saturday, was flowing down the Monongahela River to
Pittsburgh and into the Ohio River. At least 83,000 people have
been affected by cut-offs or diminishing supplies of water, and
experts say there is a potential for 500,000 in the Pittsburgh area
to be threatened if the crisis persists into next week.
Residents of the most threatened areas have depleted food
stores' supplies of bottled watter and have turned to soft drinks
and Perrier.
"It's close to panicky, with people not being sure where their
water will come from, said Joseph Faccenda, an executive with
the Giant Eagle supermarket chain.
Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey declared a "disaster emer
gency" in parts of three affected counties and mandated "severe
reductions" in water use for both citizens and private businesses.
Defendants appear at hijack trial
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Five Palestinians on trial for
hijacking a Pan American airliner in Karachi more than a year
ago declared in court yesterday that they had seized the plane
with the intention of blowing it up over Israel after securing the
release of Palestinians from Israeli prisons.
On Sept. 5, 1986, hijackers held about 400 passengers on a
New York-bound Boeing 747 hostage for 17 hours. At that
point, gunfire and grenade explosions attributed by Pakistan and
witnesses to the hijackers killed 21 and wounded 100. Several
other passengers had been wounded at the outset of the
takeover.
The defendants' lengthy statement, laced with sharp attacks on
Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, sought to defend
the action as justifiable because of what it termed the oppression
of Palestinians at the hands of "Americans and Zionists."
The five said they had intended to release the passengers on
the plane and that the incident had ended with heavy casualties
only when Pakistani commandos stormed the aircraft.
The hijackers started firing when lights on the aircraft began to
dim and then went out as a generator supplying power ran out of
fuel. One Pakistani official first claimed that a commando unit
had stormed the plane but others quickly backtracked, saying a
unit had been on alert but that it was not near the aircraft when
the hijackers panicked and opened fire.
Hoop great Maravich is dead at 40
"Pistol Pete" Maravich, 40, the greatest scorer in college bas
ketball history and a dazzling ball-handler, died yesterday of a
heart attack suffered during a pickup basketball game in
Pasadena.
Maravich, who scored a record 3667 points in 1968-70 at
Louisiana State University, for a 44.2 career points-per-game
average, collapsed between informal half-court games at the First
Church of the Nazarene in Pasadena. He was taken to St Luke
Medical Center in Pasadena where doctors tried unsuccessfully
to revive him for 50 minutes.

Violent protests resume in Israel
JERUSALEM — Israeli soldiers opened fire twice yesterday
on Arabs in the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, killing an 18-
year-old man and wounding eight others as violent protests
erupted again in the occupied territories over Israel's plan to ex
pel nine Palestinian activists.
The West Bank and Gaza, which last week appeared to be
calming down, have now been hit by three straight days of new
violence following the government's announcement Sunday of
the expulsion orders and the shooting death that same day of a
Palestinian woman in an Arab suburb of Jerusalem.
Israeli soldiers have shot dead at least 24 Palestinians and
wounded more than 180 during the riots, which are beginning
