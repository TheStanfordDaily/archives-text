# U.S. dollar continues upsurge
## 
### 
The dollar continued a spirited recovery
yesterday from its historic lows of last week,
as the national banks of several countries
bought hundreds of millions of dollars, con
vincing traders that the leading industrial na
tions were determined to support the sagging
U.S. currency.
The dramatic climb halted briefly when
word spread of an ambiguous White House
statement that the surging dollar appeared to
be "stable," interpreted by traders as less than
a clear endorsement. But the greenback
resumed its comeback to close sharply higher
in the United States and the upward move
continued in early trading Wednesday morn
ing in the Far East.
The dollar's performance spread optimism
to the stock and bond markets, with the Dow
Jones industrial average finishing up 16.25
points. The rise followed the Dow's 76-point
gain on Monday, which also was aided by a
strengthening dollar. A stable dollar reduces

the likelihood of inflation and makes U.S.
stocks and other financial instruments appear
safer to invest in.
Central banks in Japan, West Germany, the
United States, Canada, Italy, Switzerland and
Austria added fuel to the dollar rally with
coordinated purchases of the currency, esti
mated to total $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Their
actions had special impact because of growing
sentiment in the much larger marketplace of
private speculators that the dollar might have
reached at least a temporary floor.
"What they (the central banks) were trying
to do was signal the market that this was a
strong, concerted move â€” and that they
planned to be successful at it," said Robert
White, a vice president at First Interstate
Bank Ltd. in Los Angeles. "It was a success
ful, well-timed move."
The dollar closed in New York at 127.80
Japanese yen, up nearly five yen from Mon
day. It finished at 1.6310 West German

marks, up from 1.5885 marks on Monday.
Earlier, in Tokyo, where large corporations
and financial institutions have been a source
of much of the recent pessimism on the dollar,
the currency rose more than three yen to close
at 124.80 yen. It began trading in Tokyo early
today even higher, at 128.20 yen.
But despite the dollar's robust performance
Tuesday, its outlook remained highly uncer
tain in light of the financial community's
deeply ingrained worries about the U.S.
deficits in trade and the federal budget. There
also is a perception that the Reagan adminis
tration is not entirely committed to stopping
its fall, because the lower dollar provides cost
advantages to U.S. manufacturers.
A key factor propelling the dollar rally has
been growing signs that the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations were determined to
protect the dollar from sinking much lower.
