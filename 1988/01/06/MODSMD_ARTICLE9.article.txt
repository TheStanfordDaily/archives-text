# New signs to go up
## Campus to be re-marked 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Harried motorists may find
campus driving less confusing
next fall when the University
completes the installation of
new directional signs.
The $400,000 project calls
for the placement of 200 new
signs designed to aid the loca
tion of more than 600 possible
destinations.
The new signs will be brighter
and colored cardinal or terra
cotta with reflective white let
tering.
In addition to improved
graphics, the signs will be
placed according to a
"hierarchical" structure divid
ing the University into 10 geo
graphic areas. Drivers entering
the campus are expected to fol
low a hierarchy of signs to one
of these "target" areas and then
follow smaller signs to their par
ticular destination. Two of these
signs have already been placed
at the intersection of Campus

Drive and Serra Street.
In addition to the placement
of new signs, the plan calls for
special signposts to mark the
curve of the Campus Drive
loop. Improved maps at campus
entrances and new podium
maps in visitor parking lots will
also he installed.
Campus Planner Robert
Segar said the project will be
funded through the General
Plant Improvement Program,
which is set aside for basic im
provements to the campus envi
ronment. Although the actual
design and layout of the signs
will be done by private contrac
tors, Segar said the organization
and development was done en
tirely by Stanford staff.
Segar said the new sign plan
came from a "long recognized
need" to improve the way
people get around campus.
"I've been in the Planning Of
fice for two years . . . and it was
one of the primary needs when I
started," he said.
According to Planning Office

officials, the brown signs now in
place are difficult to read and
are placed in no logical order.
Initially placed in the 19505,
these signs were designed to in
trude minimally on the campus
landscape. However, officials
said, these signs became in
creasingly ineffective with the
growth of the campus.
Freshman Daryl Lum said
that despite the flaws in the
present sign system, "It's not
that hard to find your way
around ... as long as you have
that little map with you." He
added, "I can see how tourists
can get lost, though. They're
not equipped with those maps."
At least one student pointed
out another flaw in the present
system: Some signs are missing.
Describing a venerable brown
directional sign in his room, he
said, "We found that sign in
Naranja's basement." The
sophomore, who preferred to
remain nameless, said,
"Someone else took it then we
took it."
