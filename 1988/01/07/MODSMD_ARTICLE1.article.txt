most popular school, with Asian students constitut
ing the largest increase in enrollment.
According to Makino, this is indicative of a cur
rent trend in which increasing numbers of Asian stu
dents decide to continue their studies in America,
especially in the fields of engineering and computer
science.
A slight decrease in students from the Middle
East, Africa and Latin America has accompanied
the increase in students from other parts of the
world.
These continuing trends are due mostly to the po

countries, according to Makino. "Certainly, the ebb
