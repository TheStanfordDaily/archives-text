# Fall enrollment of foreigners sets new record
## 
### Angie Kim Staff writer 
Foreign student enrollment at Stanford was at an
all-time high this fall, according to the Bechtel Inter
national Center, which recently reported that there
are currently 2187 foreign students at Stanford.
These students come from 98 countries and are
approximately 19 percent of the University popula
tion.
The number of foreign students has increased con
sistently over the past several years, according to
Marsha Makino, assistant director for foreign stu
dent advising at the I-Center. She said the greatest
increase in the number of foreign students has come
in recent years from Asian countries such as India,
Korea, Japan, Taiwan and the People's Republic of
China, which, next to Canada, contribute the most
foreign students to Stanford.
Most foreigners are enrolled as graduate students.
They represent more than 24 percent of the gradu
ate enrollment and 38 percent of the postdoctoral
enrollment at Stanford. Engineering is by far the
most popular school, with Asian students constitut
ing the largest increase in enrollment.
According to Makino, this is indicative of a cur
rent trend in which increasing numbers of Asian stu
dents decide to continue their studies in America,
especially in the fields of engineering and computer
science.
A slight decrease in students from the Middle
East, Africa and Latin America has accompanied
the increase in students from other parts of the
world.
These continuing trends are due mostly to the po
litical and economic developments in the various
countries, according to Makino. "Certainly, the ebb
and flow of students from the Asian countries like
Korea are due to their developing economy,"
Makino said. "Likewise, the decrease in the number
of enrolled students from petroleum dependent
countries in the Mid-East and those in Africa and
Latin America tend to reflect the
political and economic problems
there. And the number of
European students has remained
relatively stable."
According to Karlene Dickey,
the assistant dean of Graduate
Studies, the increase in foreign
applicants corresponds to the in
crease in foreign student enroll
ment.
"The University is not seeking
for anything but the best students
that we can get," Dickey said.
"The applications from foreign
countries continue to increase,
and we find good students there."
Makino noted that the increase
in the number of foreign students
here reflects the University's
growing interest in international
affairs.
"Stanford's expansion of over
seas centers, the growing fre
quency of forums on issues such
as arms control and other indica

tions of our extension of interna
tional interests are complimen
tary to the trend," she said.
The I-Center expects the in
crease in foreign students to con

tinue as political and economic
shifts occur in areas such as Asia,
Africa and Latin America and as
the University becomes more in
volved in international affairs.
