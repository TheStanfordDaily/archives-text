# USSR to leave Afghanistan in '88
## 
### 
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union expects to
withdraw its troops from Afghanistan this
year and necessary "conditions can be insured
shortly" for the pullout to begin, Foreign Min
ister Eduard Shevardnadze was quoted as
saying yesterday.
"We would like 1988 to be the last year of
the presence of Soviet troops in your
country," Shevardnadze told the Afghan news
agency Bakhtar. An account of the interview
was carried by the official Soviet news agency
Tass.
Shevardnadze also said that the United
States has agreed to stop sending military aid
to rebel groups in return for a withdrawal of
Soviet forces from the war-torn country, Tass
said.
The report, which seemed to confirm
speculation that the United States and the So
viet Union reached an agreement to end the
eight-year Afghanistan war at last month's su
perpower summit in Washington, came as
Shevardnadze concluded a three-day visit to

Kabul for talks with Afghan President
Najibullah and returned to Moscow.
Shevardnadze said that the key element in
the withdrawal is the long-running, indirect
peace negotiations conducted in Geneva by
Diego Cordovez, an aide to United Nations
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
Shevarnadze said that the talks, between Af
ghanistan and Pakistan, are nearing agree
ment on virtually all points and may be con
cluded next month.
Under the scenario outlined by
Shevardnadze, a member of the Soviet Polit
buro, the withdrawal of an estimated 120,000
Soviet troops would begin 60 days after Af
ghanistan and Pakistan sign an agreement to
end the fighting and to resettle an estimated 4
million Afghan refugees now living in Pakis
tan.
"We shall leave Afghanistan with a clear
conscience and an awareness of duty fulfilled
when outside interference is stopped,"
Shevardnadze said. "We have complete un

derstanding with the Afghan leadership to this
effect."
If conditions are favorable, Shevardnadze
said, the Soviet troop withdrawal can he con
cluded before the end of the year. He said that
troops would be pulled out early from Afghan
provinces where a cease-fire has been
achieved and conditions are stable.
Once an agreement has been signed at
Geneva, the foreign minister added, all sides
will have an obligation to stop outside inter
ference in Afghanistan's affairs.
"Under the documents prepared, the Soviet
Union and the United States will be guaran
tors of that obligation," he said.
"It must be emphasized that the U.S. side
agrees to be a guarantor and, consequently, to
stop aid to armed groups conducting military
operations against the people's power in Af
gahnistan," Tass quoted Shevardnadze as
saying.
