# Bush knew about Iran arms deals
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Vice Pres
ident George Bush watched the
secret arms sales to Iran unfold
step by step and was more in
formed of details than he has ac
knowledged because of his regu
lar attendance at President
Reagan's morning national secu
rity briefings and other meetings,
according to his statements to the
Tower commission, other Iran
contra documents and interviews
with former administration offi
cials.
One participant in the daily
1986 Oval Office national secu
rity briefings estimated that Bush
attended several dozen such
briefings that touched on the Iran
initiative. Records of the briefings
show specifically that on at least
six occasions Bush attended the
meetings from May to October

1986 when the National Security
Council's executive secretary
made notes of a discussion of Iran
and the Americans held hostage
in Lebanon.
Bush, who has said he might
have had a different view of the
secret arms-for-hostages deal if
he had known about the opposi
tion of Secretary of State George
Shultz and then-Secretary of
State Caspar Weinberger, "knew
basically as much as the presi
dent" on national security mat
ters, including the Iran initiative,
said this regular participant in the
morning national security brief
ings who declined to be identified
by name but described himself as
a Bush admirer.
The participant, who attended
most of the meetings in 1986,
said, "Iran came up about a third

of the time in these meetings . . .
next to U.S.-Soviet relations it
was the most frequent topic."
Records from Bush's office show
that the vice president was out of
town on 113 working days in
1986 and therefore could only
have attended about half of the
morning Oval Office meetings,
though a Bush aide said yesterday
it is possible that Bush was pres
ent for as many as three dozen
briefings when Iran and the
hostages were discussed.
According to one participant in
the morning meetings, the vice
president "never voiced reserva
tions. He was not pro. He was not
con." When the vice president
spoke, the participant said, "Bush
kind of echoed the president."
Bush's Dec. 18, 1986, inter
view with the Tower commission

tends to support the view that he
knew more about the secret arms
deal than he has stated. Accord
ing to the commission's 1 1 pages
of typed notes from the vice pres
ident's interview that are still
classified top secret, Bush "did
have a general knowledge of the
arms sales to Iran as a result of at
tendance at various briefings on
the hostages."
The notes, which provide the
earliest and perhaps fullest ac
count so far of Bush's under
standing of the Iran-contra scan
dal, show that the vice president
also told the Tower commission
that Marine Lt. Col. Oliver
North's "judgments were never
checked. Mr. Bush stated that the
president and he must accept re
sponsibility for this failure."
