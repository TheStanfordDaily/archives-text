into jobs in other residences. There are
always holes to till."

"I'm very sad about leaving," she
said. "Roble was always my home."

duties, but said she will be doing some
relief work for Food Service in its main
office on Serra Street and Pampas
Lane. "They aren't sure exactly what
I'll be doing, but it will be with Food
Service."

Stanford Food Service Manager
