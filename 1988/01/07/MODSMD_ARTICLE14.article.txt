# Viennese Ball and Club Ujamaa
## Top social events will not conflict 
### Kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
Two of Stanford's best-attended so
cial events — the Viennese Ball and
Club Ujamaa — will be held on differ
ent nights this year, according to or
ganizers.
In the past, the two parties have
been held on the same night. "Before,
people always had to make a choice,"
said Club Ujamaa Financial Manager
Nicole Ray, a junior. This year, the two
committees decided to coordinate their
schedules to avoid a conflict.
"We purposefully switched our date
and moved it up a week," said junior
Jane Swiatek, Viennese Ball chairper
son. "The events should not be
mutually exclusive."
Club Ujamaa will be held Jan. 30.

'The events should not
be mutually exclusive.'

Tickets for the 11th annual Viennese
Ball, to be held Jan. 23, go on sale
today and Friday in White Plaza.
Swiatek predicted yesterday that
"hard core" couples would sleep out
last night. The 500 tickets, which are
$48 per couple, traditionally sell out.
Swiatek explained that the compli
cated procedure for ticket sales begins
at 8:30 this morning when ball commit
tee members start handing out reserve
numbers for couples.
From 9 a.m. until noon, every hour
on the hour, committee members call

out names to assure that no one has
given up his spot, according to Swiatek.
Ball committee members will sell only
250 tickets today and will sell the other
half tomorrow, making sales as fair as
possible for students with Thursday
commitments, Swiatek said.
The Stanford Orchestra and the Bill
Hammett Swing Band will play in two
different ballrooms at the gala affair,
according to junior Laura Yansouni,
party committee head.
Unlike the Viennese Ball, the Club
Ujamaa casino night is open to all stu
dents and is free. In keeping with tradi
tion, Club Ujamaa will be held Jan. 30
from 9 p.m. until 2 a.m.
According to Ray, 2500 people at
tended Club Ujamaa last year and
3000 are expected this year. "We are
really working to handle crowd flow
better this vear," Rav snid.
