After the Indiana University basketball team
defeated Stanford in a holiday tournament in De
cember, Hoosier Coach Bobby Knight said, "I
really liked the way Stanford played. You've got
a team representing one of our best academic in
stitutions, and they played us right to the hilt.
They show that the game can be played by people
who are students."
Quite a peculiar comment. One would like to
assume that all collegiate athletic contests are
played by "people who are students."
Unfortunately, as Knight's comment and
recent events in collegiate sports indicate, this is
not a safe assumption anymore. Student athletes
increasingly are becoming an endangered species.
Stanford undoubtedly stands out as an excep
tion to that trend, but the fact that it is an excep
tion rather than part of the norm is cause for
alarm.
At more and more colleges and universities,
athletics is the tail that wags the academic dog,
and so-called student athletes are athletes first
and students second — or never.
A recent Sports Illustrated article described
the efforts of the University of Miami's president
to improve his school's academic image by curb
ing excesses in its high-visibility athletic pro
grams, particularly football. The president was
quoted as saying, "Our obligation is to funda
mental values that are basically academic. . . . 1
don't think we should be too hung up on being
Number 1 (in football)."
One of the university's trustees, however,
disagreed. "We must field competitive athletic
teams in Division I-A," he said in the same arti
cle. "It isn't a negotiable subject at all. I don't
think the board (of trustees) will settle for a Stan
ford or a Duke athletic program in football."
Stanford should relish being singled-out in that
way. The University has maintained rigid re
quirements for athletes, both when they are ap
plying and after they have matriculated, while
still remaining competitive in all sports. The com

mon argument that Stanford does well only in the
"country club" sports falls flat in the face of the
success of the football team, which went to a bowl
game in 1987, the nationally ranked women's
basketball team and the defending national
champion baseball team.
American colleges and universities would do
well to take a page from Stanford's book. Be
cause NCAA regulations and punitive measures
have done little to improve the situation, it is ne
cessary that institutions begin to monitor them'
selves and take responsibility for the integrity of
their own programs.
Obviously, there are multiple forces working
against reform of collegiate athletics — not the
least of which is the fact that there is big money to
be made in Division I sports — but a school that
does not assert the pre-eminence of its academic
programs over its athletic department isn't
worthy of being called a school.
Two years ago, then-Stanford basketball coach
Tom Davis quit his post after a prize recruit was
denied admission on academic grounds. Stanford
doesn't need coaches who, like Davis, want the
University to bend its admissions standards to let
in stellar athletes. The University would have
been well-advised to show Davis the door if he
hadn't found it on his own first.
Recently, the Stanford basketball team was
narrowly defeated by Davis' new team, then-top
ranked lowa. Meanwhile, the recruit whose
denial of admission led Davis to leave Stanford
was declared temporarily ineligible at USC be
cause of academic deficiency.
The lesson here is simple: Stanford need not,
and should not, compromise its academic stan
dards in order to remain competitive. The Uni
versity should not stoop to the level of other
schools, but should stand tall as an example of
how academics and athletics can be combined
with integrity and success.
Hopefully, more and more institutions will
begin to follow that example.
