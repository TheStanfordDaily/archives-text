## Establishing solidarity

What does it mean to be a
member of a group?
Does it mean to attend regu
larly one kind of event, or to con
tribute ideas, time or labor to a
particular organization's proj
ects? Or does it mean to share
with certain others some quality
that is a part of our identity?

What our membership means
depends in large part on the type
of groups to which we belong.
There are, I think, two general
kinds: "organizational" alliances
and, for lack of a better term,
naturally determined ones.
Some groups we join — in the
best cases — after careful consid
eration. We decide to become
Democrats or Catholics, frater
nity members or skydivers (a
pretty exclusive group). Other
groups we belong to innately, and
only gradually and experientially
do we learn what it means to be
(not become) black or female,
Irish, deaf or gifted.
Especially in a university com
munity, the groups one can join
should be open to all sincere ap
plicants. But even in a university
community, where people ought
to stretch their intellectual and
social boundaries, some charac
teristics cannot be acquired and
appropriated. In other words,
supporting the Stanford Hillel

will not make a gentile Hebrew,
fighting for sexual equality will
not make the most enlightened
man a feminist and working
closely with the Black Student
Union (BSU) will not make white
students black.
I know a great many people are
upset about it, but 1 think the cur
rent flap about the BSU's mem
bership "rules" is ultimately
pointless. 1 didn't say insignifi
cant. I think it is sadly illustrative
of a continuing misapprehension
of black students' desire to have a
black community at Stanford.
The BSU exists as a positive ac
knowledgement of the difference
that being black makes. But
asserting difference is problem
atic. Too often difference is
misinterpreted as division. People
who want to be different are
accused of being separatists. And
some people will always ask,
what's to prevent other groups,
including objectionable ones,
from using race or other bigoted
standards as criteria for member
ship. Shouldn't the KKK be able
to start a Stanford chapter?
The answer to them is that
there is a significant Afro-
American tradition in American
history and society. Our defining
experiences as Americans are
close enough to being universal
that they are the wellspring of a
distinct culture. But although the
Afro-American tradition is
unique, its tenets are consistent
with the highest goals and aspira

tions of America itself.
People here should be able to
distinguish groups that assert dif
ference from those that truly adv
ocate division. By letting the BSU
be black in peace, we say that
black students can further their
growth within the tradition they
have been part of since birth. By
meddling with its membership,
we assume with monstrous ignor
ance that the experience of being
black can be learned or transfered
— or, worse, that the existence of
minority subgroups is somehow
antithetical to the idea of the uni
versity.
The case would be different if
BSU members ever really decide
to secede from Stanford. I've
never known, however, any black
students whose Stanford careers
have depended entirely on their
BSU memberships. BSU mem
bers are active in SLE, the ASSU,
Volunteers in Asia. They go to
the Viennese Ball and Big Game
Gaieties.
In my time here, I've seen
several BSU administrations in
action. All have happily and
readily worked with other groups
that have similar objectives. If we
could spread that spirit of
cooperation among differing
groups without seeking to dis
solve their individual identities,
we would have something much
better than "diversity." We
would have solidarity.
