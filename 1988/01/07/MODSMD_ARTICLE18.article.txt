# Election-year resolutions

### 
I'm told it's now 1988. "1988," the saleswoman
remarked, handing back my personal check dated
1987. "1988," she insisted, handing back my credit
card which expired in 1987. "1988, sir," she im
plored, handing back the 20-dollar bill dated 1989.
"Honest, I don't know where that came from." I'm
going back to bed. Wake me when 1 can use the
twenty.

I imagine I am in good company when I say that a
new year often leaves me ambivalent. We lament
the passing of another year of success beyond our
wildest imagination and anticipate a new year of still
greater triumphs. Or we celebrate the long-overdue
end of a grueling and frustrating 365 days and dread
the cry of "Happy New Year!" as the starting gun
for another long and tiring stint on the treadmill
which stretches from January to December, and al
ways runs just a little faster than we do. A new year
means tax forms have already arrived (unless you
didn't make any money in 1987). It means all the
bills for the expensive consumer items you bought,
secure in the promise of "No payment until 1988!"
are on their way. But it also means you won't hear
Christmas carols for at least another seven or eight
months, and you can buy lots of expensive consumer
items which promise "No payment until 1989!" se
cure in the knowledge that you have a whole year to
come up with the money.
Another reason to feel ambivalent about 1988:
It's an election year. Reliable political indicators do
not suggest that Ronald Reagan will manage to
become the only president since Franklin Delano
Roosevelt to serve a third term in the White House
so, as is nature's way in the passing of time, it's out
with the old and in with the middle-aged. (Perhaps
our president bears only a slight resemblance to
Father Time. However, if Baby New Year were on
the Democratic ticket he'd have a good shot at the
nomination, and if he got it, 1 bet he would wipe the
floor with George Bush.) The Reagan era is stagger
ing to a close, and despite our ambivalence about
the past eight years and the prospects for the future,
it's time for America to make some election-lear
resolutions for November 1988 and beyond.
When most people make New Year's resolutions,
they look back and assess the past year and size up
their successes and failures. A reasonable person

resolves to continue the successes and correct
and/or avoid the failures. Not so with election-year
resolutions. Voters generally get an either/or choice
in election years: either continue along the garden
path of success, prosperity and high moral standards
by electing the incumbent or his protegp, or turn
180 degrees and correct all the damage that has
been done during the past four years of inept lead
ership by voting for the opposition party.
This is the choice Americans were given in 1980.
We chose "or." In 1984 we chose "either." We've
begun to pay for those choices, and most social sci
entists, environmentalists and, of course,
economists tell us we'll continue to pay for quite
some time. A traditional analysis would suggest that
we should have made the other choice in 1980 or
1984. I would suggest we need more choices.
Few would argue with the assertion that the
Carter administration had its share of failures â€” in
fact so few that Carter suffered one of the worst
electoral defeats in American history. With the ben
efit of hindsight we can see, however, that Carter
would have avoided many of the pits into which
Reagan allowed the country to fall. Carter would
not have ignored the expanding plight of the home
less, malnourished and poverty-stricken as these so
cial problems reached levels higher than America
has suffered since the Great Depression. And if des
criptions of the Great Depression now seem dis
turbing portents rather than events of the remote
past, consider that while Carter was hardly known
for his economic genius, he was not a supply-sider.
Reagan ran in 1980 against free-spending liberals
who "threw money at every problem," but the
federal debt more than tripled under his tenure, not
Carter's.
So why not try to forget the past eight years like a
strange dream, click our heels three times and try to
go home to the America we knew in 1980? Some
good reasons to eschew this approach are the same
reasons which prompted change in 1980. We must
strive to make use of the 20/20 vision of hindsight
but avoid those rose-colored lenses of nostalgia.
And perhaps we have begun to do just that. For
those with a keen memory, the "good oF days" were
never all that good, be they Ronald Reagan's 1950s
or Gary Hart's 19605. The lackluster performance
ot the 1988 presidential hopefuls should perhaps
tell them something. While announcing a belief in
supply-side economics is not a politically astute
move, simply coming out against failed policies of
the present administration is not enough.
Americans are tired of a choice between the lesser
ol two evils. The challenges of 1988 and beyond
demand the greater of numerous goods.
