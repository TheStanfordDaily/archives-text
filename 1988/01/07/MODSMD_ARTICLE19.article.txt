Viewpoint lacks a
sense of justice
The recent viewpoint "Wasting
time with torts" (Daily, Jan. 4)
offers many solid suggestions to
trim the legal system and help the
economy, but it ultimately lacks
any sense of "justice." Appar
ently, we should compete (never
cooperate) with the Japanese in
order to regain some sort of
mythical American mastery, not
to provide more people in our
own country with a better life. To
regain our place in the interna
tional king-of-the-hill game,
within our borders "a corporation
that is 5 percent at fault for an ac
cident should not have to pay 100
percent of the damages."
I believe this approach elevates
products over people. It is not
enough to merely determine who
is at fault through some sort of
mathematically soulless formula.

What is to he done for the victims
of corporation land? Ostensibly
the legal system provides justice;
realisticaly it provides stability,
and that stability should buttress
those subject to wrenching
changes. The "deep pockets" sys
tem came about not so much be
cause corporations should pay but
because the injured should
receive compensation.
While agreeing with the view
point in that "mega cases" need
curbing, I must strongly disagree
with a blanket condemnation of
the tort system. Fiscal responsi
bility and competitiveness remain
essential parts of modern life's
formula, but with a bit of compas
sion added we might have a soci
ety where both man and machine
can flourish. When we stop
"wasting time with torts," we've
cut the heart out of that formula.

Jim Lyons' remarks at last
quarter's "Indians, Promises and
Us" press conference warrant
repeating: Institutions are both
slow and swift to change. Though
the Stanford community failed for
years to understand as racist the
use of an American Indian for a
mascot, we responded with speed
to end that use when our error
was made plain. Our gratitude
goes to those who pressed for
change.
When (Interfraternity Council
President) Vinny Frost spoke for
sororities and fraternities with
words that excluded gay men and
lesbians, those words were
retracted. But attitudes are not
mascots, and public retractions
are not changes of heart. While
we must allow any idea the op
portunity for scrutiny (higher ed

ucation without such freedom is
hamstrung), that liberty is no
license to act on ideas that
demean or do harm. The self
interest that supports members of
the Stanford community in organ
izations that are closed by arbi
trary criteria of gender, race and
wealth is inconsistent with educa
tion's need to hear all voices. For
that reason we can be grateful for
(University President) Don Ken
nedy's openness to reconsider
Stanford funding of memberships
in the Bohemian Club.
