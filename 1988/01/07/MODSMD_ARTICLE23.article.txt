## Future teachers get boost from Mellon award 
### Rozanna Fiore 
Most people would agree that the
decrease in the number of people enter
ing the teaching profession has been at or
near the heart of the problems facing the
nation's secondary schools.
As fewer people choose to become
teachers, both public and private high
schools are faced with problems of over
crowding and unqualified instructors.
Many complain that there is little in
centive for anyone to pursue teaching as
a career, but the Mellon Foundation has
decided to provide an incentive — to en
courage and reward those who do want
to go into the teaching profession today.
In its first of two years at Stanford, the
Mellon Foundation for Teacher Prepara
tion has selected eight students interested
in the field of secondary education and
provided them with the funds to continue
their studies with the Stanford Teacher
Education Program (STEP).
While completing their respective
majors — primarily math, science, Eng
lish or history — Mellon Education Fel
lows, who were selected from a group of
15 applicants, will participate in course
work, field experience and special semi
nars in the School of Education during
their junior and senior years. Applicants
to the program are usually juniors, but
seniors may also apply.
After receiving their bachelor's
degrees, the fellows spend a fifth year at
Stanford, paid for by the Mellon Founda
tion, and earn both a master's degree and
a California secondary school teacher's
credential. Aid from the Mellon Founda
tion applies only to the fifth year and
does not count toward any undergradu
ate work.
For most of the Mellon Fellows, the
program offers the perfect entry into a
field they believe in.
"I think that despite all the drawbacks
to being a secondary teacher today, the
benefits of teaching really make it
worthwhile. I find it very rewarding,"
said Sean Fottrell, a junior majoring in
physics.
Fottrell admits, however, that teaching
is not a profession for everybody.
"Teaching is a job where you have to
know already that it's something you
want to do. Unless you really enjoy the
experience of teaching, you probably
won't be happy," he said.
Fottrell has already had experience tu
toring students in physics, algebra,
geometry and English in high school
summer programs.
In order to help students who know
they want to teach, Page Kalkowski, a
graduate student in the School of Educa
tion, worked with Nel Noddings, a pro
fessor in the School of Education, to
coordinate the scholarship program. The
fellows were selected by Kalkowski, the
STEP Governing Board and the STEP
directors.
While the Mellon Foundation is
prepared to provide funds for 10 students
for the next two years, it only considers
those candidates whose majors easily ap
ply to a high school curriculum. Any
recipient majoring in a subject slightly
different from the solids "gets quite a bit

of advice from us" in establishing course
work, according to Noddings.
Human biology and international rela
tions majors, in other words, are not
likely to become Mellon Fellows.
Yet, people like math/science major
Shelly Lawrence, a junior, are greatly
needed.
Lawrence explained that she wants to
become a teacher because she has "seen
the difference a good teacher can make."
Lawrence said she does not worry
much about the low income that teachers
generally receive and is not concerned
about "living like a student" for a few
years after she graduates. Besides, she
said, "when you're young you don't
really have to worry about how much
you're making."
"Giving kids the chance to recognize
that they have aptitudes" and tunneling
the raw energy young people have into
constructive outlets are a few of
Lawrence's main goals.
After working with emotionally dis
turbed children at the Peninsula
Children's Center, Lawrence decided to
consider a career teaching handicapped
children, and she hopes her experience
teaching will provide a good background
with which to start.
Upon receiving the scholarship, the
Mellon Fellows agree to teach for at least
two years immediately after graduation.
While the Foundation assists students in
finding jobs, recipients may decide at
what type of institution they would like
to instruct.
The Foundation also pays students for
tutoring at local high schools as part of
their "fieldwork" experience.
Political science major and senior
Randy Thomas has already had experi
ence teaching. Thomas tutored English
to French students in junior high school
while in France and has written instruc
tional software for special education stu
dents while co-instructing a computer
class.
Thomas said he sees teaching as a ful
filling occupation and enjoys being in the
classroom "helping people grow and pro
viding personal support."
After one high school teacher "showed
(him) how it is possible to be happy as a
teacher," Thomas decided that education
could fit into his life style.
Steven Hawkins, a senior majoring in
English, said that people today do not go
in to teaching for the money or the pres
tige.
Hawkins said he does not plan to go
into education with any grandiose ideas
of changing the whole educational sys
tem, but instead wants to help individuals
improve themselves and realize their own
potential.
"Teaching, for me, is very stimulating.
1 find a lot of satisfaction in helping
others advance themselves intellectually.
If I could help even one person make the
decision to go on to college, I'd feel
great," he said.
English major and junior Janine
Duyvestein, who attended public school
all her life, said she doesn't know if she'll
be able to "make it financially as a
teacher," but sees nothing wrong with
"giving for nothing what she took for

nothing."
"I think education is one of the most
important things in life, and unfortun
ately it isn't as good now as it can be,"
she said. Duyvestein, who came to the
United States from Holland after six
years of elementary education, said she
believes that specializing students' curric
ulum, after the European model, may
improve secondary education.
Although Duyvestein's parents left
Europe, in part, to provide their
daughter with an education not available
in Holland, Duyvestein said she sees
some aspects of Holland's school system
as superior to the American one.
Senior James Canales, an English
major, said he realizes, from experience,
that teachers' salaries rarely compensate
for the amount of time and effort that the
profession demands.
Yet, Canales explained that he has had
enough positive experiences with teach
ers in high school and college to know
that education is a field that interests

him.
Canales, who has worked extensively
with University High School's Sum
merbridge program, has already
developed his own literature classes and
taught them to gifted students.
"Teaching is exhausting, but is also
very challenging and allows me to learn,
too. There's always a new way to read the
literature (in the classes), and a lot of that
comes out in the discussions," he said.
Ultimately, Canales hopes to establish
his own school or become the principal of
an already existing one.
Two students — junior Louis Alonso
and senior Joey Thomas — said they
were especially interested in working
with minority students.
"I hope I can change some of the
negative attitudes minority kids have
about their own abilities. Too many times
they've been told that they're not good
enough (to go on with what they want to
do), and I want to be the one to help
them realize that they are," said Alonso,

who is a history major.
"I'm really in it for the kids," he ex
plained. "My idea of success isn't like a
lot of the businessmen out there. I find a
lot of happiness and satisfaction in help
ing high school kids."
The opportunities being offered him
by the Mellon Scholarship "just can't be
beat," Alonso said. After observing the
strong impact a teacher can have on a
student's high school years, Alonso said
he hopes he can "influence a life" by be
coming a teacher himself.
While many scholarship recipients
don't know exactly where they will work
after graduation, Joey Thomas, a senior
and English major, knows exactly where
he'll be.
Thomas wants to teach the children of
his Hualapai Tribe on the Indian reserva
tion where he grew up in Arizona. While
Indian culture and tradition have been an
integral part of Thomas' life, he claims to
feel some loss of his heritage over the
vears.
