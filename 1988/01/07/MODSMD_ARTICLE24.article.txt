## Spice up dreary winter nights at La Pizzeria 
### Kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
La Pizzeria
La Casa Italiana
562 Mavfleld Ave.
Rain-drenched, brain-dead and
downcast, Joe Stanford student
leaves Meyer Library Saturday
evening with a severe case of win
ter quarter blahs. Before return
ing to his dorm room, Joe swings
by the dining hall, only to see
cubed steak and stuffed zucchini
piled on plates. Ugh.
Determined to spice up his
winter quarter, Joe heads to La
Pizzeria, located at Casa Italiana
(the Italian House) on Mayfield
Avenue. Specializing in Italian
style pizza and calzone, La Piz
zeria is an excellent escape from
Stanford — and Joe does not
even have to leave campus to en
joy it.
On Jan. 23, Italian House resi
dents will gear up for another
quarter of running their own res
taurant. The lights in the dining
hall will dim, soft, romantic tunes
will play in the background and
the sweet smell of homemade
tomato sauce will fill the house.
Open almost every Saturday
night of the quarter from 6 to
9:30 p.m.. La Pizzeria runs true
to form as an Italian restaurant.
The menu is in Italian with a
pronunciation guide next to the
words and English translations
below. Prices are in lire. With the
estimation that 1000 Italian lire
equal a dollar, even the non
mathematician can figure out the
American equivalent in price.
Unlike the various American
pizza sizes needed to accommo
date different numbers of eaters,

More than the cuisine, what really makes
La Pizzeria is the company. Food service
refugees huddled around tables, couples
(Yes, people do date here) nestled in
corners and the buzz of Italian House
student cooks, waiters and waitresses
create a cozy atmosphere.

Italian pizzas come in only one
size and are served as a dish for
one. But the nine-inch Pizzeria
pizzas will fill even the heartiest
of diners.
Toppings include delectables
like black olives, salami and ar
tichoke hearts. "Margherita,' an
Italian word for a type of pizza,
costs $3.50 at La Pizzeria, and the
additional toppings are 50 cents
each.
If you are like most American
pizza-lovers who want cheese
gushing over the sides when they
bite into a piece, then you should
definitely order extra cheese be
cause the topping is sparse. The
sweet tomato sauce, however, is
very good.
If you are daring, try the "alia
capriccisoa" pizza. Topped with
an egg, this pizza is an Italian
delicacy.
Another Pizzeria dish is
calzone, a type of folded-over
pizza. La Pizzeria stuffs its
calzone with ricotta cheese,
tomato sauce and any of the
goodies that are also offered as
pizza toppings. The dough is drier
than what you would expect from
American pizza, so you might
want to order extra tomato sauce

to give the calzone more flavor.
Although the salad bar is hid
den in the corner, he sure to seek
it out. For only $1.50 you can
treat yourself to lettuce, carrots,
sprouts, broccoli and other veggie
delights.
Top off the meal with a cup of
cappuccino from La Pizzeria's
new cappuccino bar, recently pur
chased with restaurant profits
from last quarter. Or if the Italian
meal has overwhelmed you, go
for an American dessert with a
piece of apple pie brought in from
a Palo Alto bakery.
More than the cuisine, what
really makes La Pizzeria is the
company. Food service refugees
huddled around tables, couples
(Yes, people do date here)
nestled in corners and the buzz of
Italian House student cooks,
waiters and waitresses create a
cozy atmosphere that is a
welcome relief from dorm dining.
"In a way I came just to get
away," sophomore Neal Mahutte
said about La Pizzeria as he
feasted on both pizza and calzone
with a friend last quarter.
Although Italian house resi
dents are not required to work at
the restaurant, 90 percent of

them have waited tables and
helped with the cooking, accord
ing to junior Kerem Kusi, one of
two Pizzeria student managers.
Kusi said that residents are
very enthusiastic about the
campus success of La Pizzeria.
According to Kusi, last quarter
the house made a $400 profit.
Past profits have been used to buy

a VCR, stereo system and the
cappuchino bar for the house,
Kusi said, adding that residents
hope to organize a winter quarter
ski trip with the rest of the fall
quarter profits.
As a manager, Kusi dedicates
most of his Saturdays to cleaning
the oven and making dough and
sauce for the more than 70 pizzas

served in an evening.
"Just cleaning the oven took
four hours," Kusi said about one
of his preparation days.
With waiting lists sometimes 30
minutes long, it is obvious that
Kusi and his housemates' efforts
have paid off. Try to get to La
Pizzeria early to avoid the wait.
Buen apetito!
