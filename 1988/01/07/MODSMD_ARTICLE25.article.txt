## Hoops to Arizona 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Quite possibly this weekend's Stanford
safari into the Grand Canyon state of
Arizona could be the most momentous
road trip the Cardinal has taken in many a
sunset.
First, Stanford (10-3 overall, 2-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) visits the Sun
Devils of Arizona State tonight at 6:35
p.m. PST. The Sun Devils have blazed to
an 8-3 start, including road victories
against Washington and Washington State.
Next, on Saturday afternoon at 4:05, the
Cardinal will step onto the floor of McKale
Center in Tucson to face the mighty
Arizona Wildcats. The Wildcats are 12-1
on the season and held the No. 1 ranking
nationally until New Mexico upset them in
Albequerque last Saturday night.
The contest against Arizona will be
televised live on KPIX, channel 5.
A Stanford sweep would put the Cardi
nal alone atop the Pac-10 and could mean
a top-20 spot come Monday morning.
"This is one of the biggest road trips we
will have taken in a long time as far as
Stanford basketball is concerned," Cardi
nal point guard Terry Taylor said. "Both
games are really important, especially the
Arizona State game, since they're not
picked ahead of us."

Taylor and his teammates say there is no
chance that they will be looking past
Arizona State toward Saturday's contest
against the No. 3 Wildcats.
"1 really don't think we'll be looking past
ASU," guard Scott Meinert said. "The
game we have the best chance to win is
Arizona State. We've got to win that one
first to get some momentum if we're going
to have any chance to beat Arizona."
Cardinal junior Todd Liehti agreed.
"We know ASU is a good team — they
went up and beat Washington and Wash
ington State on the road," Liehti said. "We
can't take them lightly."
Lichti and fellow junior Howard Wright
have led the Cardinal through its auspi
cious beginning. Wright is averaging 14.8
points per game and 8.9 rebounds. In the
Pac-10 victories over UCLA and USC, the
6-foot-8 forward had 57 points, 16
rebounds, seven steals and three blocked
shots.
Lichti, meanwhile, is on pace to become
Stanford's all-time leading scorer in his
junior year. He is averaging 21.2 points
and 5.5 rebounds per game.
Arizona State also has two big guns of its
own. Guard Arthur Thomas and forward
Eric Holloway have furnished the bulk of
the scoring for the Sun Devils.

If Stanford guard Todd Lichti maintains his scoring
average of over 21 points per game, he will become
the school's all-time leading scorer as a junior.
"Those are the two main offen
sive weapons, and we're going to
try and shut them down," Lichti
said. "But we've got to remember
they'll have three other guys on
the court."
Splendid shorty Thomas is the
key to the ASU offense. The 5-9

senior whirls his way to 17.4
points and 4.2 rebounds per
game. And he can dunk.
"They try to get Thomas the
ball and let him shake and bake
and create things," Taylor said of
the man he may be guarding.
"We'll probably try to deny him
the ball."
Both games in Arizona will be
broadcast on KZSU, 90.1 FM
and KCBS, 740 AM.
