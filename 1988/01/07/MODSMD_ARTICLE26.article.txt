# Sailing places third at Rose Bowl
## 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
It doesn't have thousands of cheering fans,
a parade of flower-covered floats or national
television coverage, and this year it didn't
even have enough wind.
Yet the event that drew Stanford and 19
other sailing teams to Southern California last
weekend is known as the Rose Bowl Regatta,
and like its more famous namesake, the event
hosts some of the nation's best collegiate ath
letes.
Traditionally, Stanford proves itself each
year at the Rose Bowl Regatta with strong
finishes against competitors from around the
country, and this year was no exception, as the
Cardinal finished an impressive third at the
event, ahead of top-ranked Navy.
Sailing for Stanford were senior Tom
Kuhnle and sophomore Kim Grose, who
finished fifth in A division, and seniors Dan
Buckstaff and Kathleen Mallery, who finished
second in B division.
While the four were generally pleased with

their finishes, nearly all those who competed
in the regatta left with a sense of disappoint
ment as a lack of wind prevented event offi
cials from holding more than five races in each
division over the two days of racing. When
there is enough wind, similar events usually
include 10 or more races a day.
During the abbreviated regatta, using one's
body to (illegally) propel the boats through
the water was often more useful than concen
trating on sailing finesse. After the regatta,
many coaches said they were disappointed
that some teams seemed to emphasize win
ning instead of sportsmanship.
By regatta's end. however, the best teams
generally rose to the top of the fleet. UC-
Irvine won the regatta, and Texas took
second. Stanford, Navy, Orange Coast. Wash
ington, California. San Diego State, USC and
Western Washington rounded out the top 10.
Overall, the regatta attracted an impressive
depth of talent from all over the country.
Seven of the top nine finishers are currently
ranked in the national top 20, and each of the
seven collegiate sailing districts was

represented.
For Stanford, the regatta's conditions were
as challenging as the opposition. The absence
of a breeze that left competitors drifting for
much of the weekend especially frustrated the
Cardinal sailors, who too often found them
selves over the starting line early. The rules of
sailing dictate that an early start must be
remedied by returning to the line and restart
ing, and in a windless race that can be an ex
ceptionally difficult task.
"I really hate light wind. I guess I'm just a
heavy-weather sailor who likes to use her
weight to keep the boat going, and there
wasn't a chance to do that all weekend."
Grose said.
Even though they were sailing in adverse
conditions, the sailors turned in finishes that
pleased their coach.
"They sailed well, even when they hurt
themselves with mistakes at the starting line. 1
think that if there had been a few more races,
we really would have had a shot at winning the
regatta," Stanford Coach Blake Middleton
said.
