# Lichti, prep star hold Card future
## 
### 
With a 10-3 record and 2-0
Pacific 10 Conference geta
way, the Stanford basketball
team has a bright present and
an even better future.
Two keys to the future of
Stanford basketball are Todd
Lichti and Adam Keefe, Stan
ford's top two men's basketball
recruits of the 1980s, both of
whom are in the midst of stel
lar seasons.

Lichti, a junior, has been
nothing short of spectactular in
averaging a shade over 21
points per game and pulling
down nearly six rebounds an
outing from his off-guard posi
tion.
Lichti's excellence has long
been recognized on the West
Coast, but now he's starting to
gain a national reputation.
NBA scouts are taking notice.
"I think Todd Lichti will be
a first-rounder," said Jack
McMahon, Golden State War
riors' Director of Player Per
sonnel. of Lichti's senior-year
draft potential. "I'm going to
the Stanford-Arizona game
this Saturday. There's no ques
tion he's got NBA talent."
McMahon stressed that
Lichti's draft position will
depend on his senior-year per
formance and play at pre-draft
camps and tournaments, but
the Warriors' scout likes the
looks of Lichti.
"I'd see him as an off
guard," McMahon said. "He
probably plays something like
(Portland star) Jim Paxson â€”
good shooter, moves well with
out the ball. He's an intelligent
fellow. Hopefully he'll peak his
senior year."
If he makes it in the NBA,

Lichti will be Stanford's only
representative there, now that
former Stanford players Rich
Kelley and Mike Bratz have
retired. First, though, Lichti
will concentrate on leading the
Cardinal to its first NCAA
tournament berth since 1942
and then on this spring's Olym
pic try outs.
Lichti joined teammate
Howard Wright at the Fan
American Games tryouts last
year and will almost surely be
invited to the Olympic camp.
Wright, who's putting together
the finest season of his career,
may also receive an invitation
from Olympic Coach John
Thompson.
Once he reaches the tryouts,
Lichti will face an uphill battle
for a spot on the team. Compe
tition at the off-guard/swing
man position will be ferocious.
Kentucky's Rex Chapman, In
diana's Rick Calloway, Wyo
ming's Fennis Dembo, lowa's
Roy Marble, lowa State's Jeff
Grayer, Xavier's Byron Larkin
and a host of others all play
what may be America's
strongest position.
Still, no one is guaranteed a
spot on the team, and there
will be 10 positions open
alongside near sure-things
David Robinson and Danny
Manning. Even il he doesn t
make the squad, Lichti is
assured of some high-quality
exposure.
NBA scouts will be swarm
ing at the Olympic camp, and
they will certainly notice
Lichti. He has the requisite
physical attributes and basket
ball talent for the NBA.
Keefe, meanwhile, commit
ted to Stanford in November
and is now putting together
some big numbers for
Woodbridge High School in
Irvine. At 6-foot-9 Keete can
play either forward or center,
and the big red-head brings to
mind a comparison to Bill Wal
