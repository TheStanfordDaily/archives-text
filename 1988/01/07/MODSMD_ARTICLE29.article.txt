# Stanford hits mat with Utah State
## 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
Winter break came to an
abrupt halt for members of the
Stanford wrestling team as the
impending season called them out
of hibernation and back to
campus to continue their work
outs last week â€” on New Year's
Eve.
The overweight grapplers
struggled to regain their former
physiques in time to make weight
for today's match against Utah
State. The dual meet will be the
first half of a double-header at
San Jose State. Stanford will
wrestle against Utah State at 6
p.m., followed by San Jose State
against Utah State.
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel
brought in the new year with two
a-day workouts in order to
prepare his squad for what will be
a difficult competition against
Utah State, a team that placed
second in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence last year.
"At least four of their wrestlers
are ranked in the top 10 nation
ally, and two or three of them are
returning All-Americans," said
Horpel.
The Pac-10 in wrestling is a
conglomeration of various teams,
only four of which are in the
familiar Pac-10 of other sports.
Oregon, Oregon State and Wash
ington State are the only univer
sities other than Stanford which
maintain active programs. The
rest of the conference's schools
are smaller colleges, such as Utah
State, Chico State and UC-Davis.
Stanford will go against the
Aggies with an immediate disad
vantage, forfeiting the 1 18-pound
bracket. All of the other positions

are filled, with freshman Steve
Buddie leading all wrestlers with
a 6-2 record and a total of 25
team points earned so far this
season. Senior Terry Mclntyre
has accrued 22.5 points and is fol
lowed by 158-pound Steve
Yarbrough, who has 20 team
points.
Wrestlers are awarded points
for their respective teams de
pending on their margin of vic
tory. A pin garners six points,
while a tie brings home only one
point for a grappler's team.
Mclntyre is the only senior on
the varsity squad. He has
compiled a 6-4 record during the
early part of this season, with half
of his losses coming at the highly
competitive Las Vegas tourna
ment last month.
Buddie was undefeated going
into the Vegas tournament,
having won all of his matches by
fall or technical fall. He still main
tains an unblemished dual meet
record and looks to maintain that
perfection tonight. His perform
ance at 167 pounds has bolstered
the Cardinal's upper weights.
Starting with Yarbrough at 158
pounds and running through
Buddie, Ron Perry, Mclntyre and
freshman Dave Nahama, the final
five brackets have a combined
dual meet record of 16-5-0, for a
.761 winning percentage.
Even with this success, Stan
ford looks toward the Utah State
meet with some trepidation.
"This is going to be a tough
one. They (Utah State) were one
of the dominant teams at Pac-lOs
last year," said 177-pound Perry.
The Aggies are in the midst of a
road trip that has brought them
from Cal State-Fullerton to San
Jose for this "double dual" meet.

Long after yesterday's practice
was over, Horpel, clothes soaked
with sweat, came off the mat with
134-pound Josh Lisle. A former
Stanford All-American himself,
Horpel still reigns over the gym
during his daily workouts with the
team.
Horpel echoed Perry's senti
ments about the Aggies: "This is
a competition to see how well we

can fare against a team of this
caliber. What really matters is
how we use the experience to
prepare for the tournaments at
the end of the season."
Stanford's next home meet will
take place on Tuesday, Jan. 19,
against Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo. The competition will
begin at 7:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
