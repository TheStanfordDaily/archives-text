# Hoover fellow to assist KCBS
## Bunzel will be station's presidential campaign commentator 
### Rick Rosen 
Senior Hoover Research Fellow
John Bunzel will be a political com
mentator on a weekly KCBS Radio
news program about the events and is
sues of the 1988 presidential campaign.
Beginning today, Bunzel will field
questions from anchorman A 1 Hart on
"Reporter's Notebook," part of an
hour-long news program.
This is the second year Bunzel has
worked for KCBS. He served in the
same capacity in 1984, when he pro
vided political analysis of the Demo
cratic National Convention in San
Francisco.
In addition to discussing recent poll

results and closely following each cam
paign, Bunzel will report on the major
trends and factors affecting the race â€”
starting with both parties' primaries
and moving on to the general election
in November.
"Any new story or event that might
affect the campaigns, 1 am on call for
analysis of the event,"he said.
Because there is no clear front
runner in either party, Bunzel said,
predictions for the primaries will be
difficult. Nevertheless, he said he will
try to explain the influence of each can
didate and the impact of the positions
they take.
The race for the Democratic nomi
nation was reshaped by the re-entry of

Gary Hart, who immediately replaced
the Rev. Jessie Jackson as the front
runner in Democratic polls. Bun/el
noted.
However, Bunzel claims early polls
can be misleading, as they measure
mostly name recognition and not nec
essarily voter support. "All candidates
have issues they push, hut voters really
don't notice yet," he said.
The results of the lowa primary Feb.
8 will play an important role in decid
ing whether Hart can make a come
back, Bunzel said. "Should Hart lose in
lowa and New Hampshire, it would be
extremely difficult for him to win
the nomination."
Bunzel said a major factor in
both races is the effect of "the
men of the cloth." Should either
Jessie Jackson or Pat Robertson
claim a significant portion of the
votes, it could prevent anyone
from establishing a significant
lead.
According to Bunzel, neither
Jackson nor Robertson has much
of a chance of winning, but both
certainly will affect the outcome
of the election. Should either win
his respective party's nomination.

the opposing party would almost
certainly win the general election,
for neither could actually be
elected president, Bunzel added.
Bunzel said he thinks Sen.
Robert Dole of Kansas and Vice
President George Bush probably
have the best chance of winning
the Republican nomination.
While the Democrats have not
really been debating each other, it
is expected that Dole and Bush
will tight it out. Dole will need to
do well in lowa to secure equal
political footing with Bush, Bun
zel said.
Regardless of the candidates'
positions, if nothing changes, it
will be "an uphill battle for the
Democrats," Bunzel predicted.
The stability in the economy and

continuing progress in arms con
trol will benefit the Republicans,
especially Bush.
If they are to win the election,
the Democrats will have to con
vince voters that it is time for a
change and also build support for
their nominee.
But Bunzel emphasized that it
is still too early to make solid pre
dictions."lt's an interesting year,"
he said. "There is no clear victor
in either party, no incumbent.
Nothing is really clear; it's hard to
make a prediction in this climate
so early."
A member of the Hoover Insti
tution since 1978, Bunzel spe
cializes in American public
policy, with an emphasis on civil
rights and higher education.
