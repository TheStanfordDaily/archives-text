# Law School proposal draws mixed reviews
## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
A proposal aimed at strengthening the
Law School's non-discrimination policy,
scheduled to be discussed by Law School
faculty next month, has sparked contro
versy among law students and officials.
The proposal, released last month,
would create a committee to oversee en
forcement of the Law School's policy re
garding which employers are allowed to in
terview on campus. The four-member
committee would consist of one student
and three Law School officials.
The move by the Law School comes
after the Multicultural Council — a Law
School coalition of ethnic minority,
women, lesbian and gay groups — and
other students protested the allegedly dis
criminatory practices of two firms that Law
School officials allowed to interview on
campus.
Paul Haviland, president of the Multi
cultural Council, said the plan is "grossly
inadequate" in comparison to the previous
proposal by the council.

"The proposal falls way short," Haviland
said. "They (Law School officials) want to
allow white males to determine what is dis
criminatory."
Emphasizing that he spoke only for him
self, Haviland said "they (the Law School)
would allow [certain discriminatory firms]
to interview on campus, which is what we
were protesting in the first place."
However, Law School Dean Paul Brest
called the proposal "a strong policy" and
said he had received "a number of positive
comments" about it.
According to David Cavicke, president
of the Stanford Federalist Society — an or
ganization of law students, professors and
judges — the proposal is "going to be fairly
controversial."
Cavicke said that his group is concerned
"that due process should govern all
things," but withheld judgement on the
proposal until he could give it full consider
ation.
The current controversy began when the
Law School permitted on-campus recruit-
ing by the law firm of Baker and
McKenzie, which is currently
being sued by a former employee
who claims he was fired because
he has AIDS.
The Multicultural Council is
also protesting the on-campus
recruiting of Allen, Matkins,
Leek, Gamble and Mallory for al
legedly discriminating against a
Hispanic Stanford law student,
Victor Minjares.
The voting members of the
proposed four-person committee
would consist of the chair of the

Faculty Placement Committee,
the associate dean of administra
tion and a student appointed by
the dean for a one-year term.
The fourth, a non-voting mem
ber, would be the director of
career services. The director
would assume the responsibility
for gathering information for the
committee regarding alleged dis
crimination relating to Stanford
students. In addition, the director
would maintain files on firms
accused of discrimination unr
elated to Stanford students.
The proposal includes a provi
sion for sanctions or other actions
against firms determined to have
discriminated against Stanford
students.

However, in the case of firms
accused by people outside of the
Stanford community, such as
McKenzie, the committee would
not pass judgment "without a fac
tual determination by an agency
or court."
The committee that drafted the
report is soliciting comments
from the campus community
prior to submitting the plan to the
faculty for approval on Feb. 1.
Due to the fact that Law School
finals are presently taking place,
many students involved in the
controversy said real reaction to
the proposal will not occur until
closer to the February deadline
for comment.
