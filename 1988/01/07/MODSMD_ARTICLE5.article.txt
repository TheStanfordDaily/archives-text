# Poison grain used in war on Tresidder birds
## 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
In an attempt to reduce large popula
tions of birds in and around Tresidder Un
ion, a pest control company last week used
a "tainted grain" bait to kill more than 30
birds.
Tresidder officials said they were not yet
certain of the effectiveness of the measure.
The action was authorized by Tresidder
in response to Santa Clara Health Depart
ment citations and numerous customer
complaints about the birds and their drop
pings in dining areas.
Asst. Director of Tresidder Paul
Szczesiul said the birds — starlings — have
plagued the eateries for many years, and
that the large numbers of birds had become
a very serious health problem.
"The whole intent is not to destroy the
population but to scare them away," he
said.
The process of eliminating the birds is
accomplished with a "flock alarming
agent," according to Crane Pest Control,
the company hired to solve the problem.
Crane representative Peter Davidson
said the tainted grain disorients the birds
and induces them to send a distress signal
to other birds. The signal scares other birds
from that particular habitat.
According to Davidson, only birds that
eat excessive amounts of the feed die and
typically 3 to 5 percent of a bird population
perishes as a result of the laced feeding.

He also said the chemical used by Crane,
Avitrol, is potentially lethal to other
animals. Because of this, the grain was dis
pensed on the roof of Tresidder in order to
limit its availability to other animals.
According to Lt. Carl Lee of the Califor
nia Fish and Game Department, state law
bans the use of poisons in removing birds
of any kind and the procedure used by
Crane could be a violation of the code.
But Building Services Manager Jeanette
Smith-Laws told The Daily yesterday that
thorough research was done to ensure that
the methods used by the pest control com
pany were legal.
"All of that (legal aspects of the action)
was looked into to be sure Crane was
within the law," she said. "This was not
something that was decided overnight."
She also emphasized the fact that pest
control companies are regulated by a state
agency that may not classify Avitrol as a
poison.
In the past, other bird deterrents such as
window decals and sonar devices have
been employed, but all were ineffective,
Szczesiul said.
Smith-Laws described the measure as a
last resort. "We did everything but use
scarecrows."
Tresidder officials said they are not sure
if the tainted grain baiting will be used in
the future.
Davidson said the procedure should be
repeated on a bimonthly basis to maintain
a low bird population.
