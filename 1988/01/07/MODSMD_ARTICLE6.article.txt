## Stanford makes exercise video

Jane Fonda, move over. Stan
ford has entered the exercise
video market.
"We don't have Jane Fonda,
but we do have considerable ex
pertise here at Stanford," said
John Green, creative director for
the Stanford Alumni Association,
which released a video last fall.
Excercise physiologists at the
Center for Research in Disease
Prevention and selected Stanford
athletes appear in the two-hour
program.
The health and exercise video,
produced with the help of the
Disease Prevention center, sig
nals a new venture for the Alumni
Association.
Depending on the success of
the "Stanford Health and Ex
cercise Program" — which in
cludes a written handbook as well
as a video— the Alumni Associa
tion may add other videos to its
line of products and services for
alumni, according to Green.
So far 2000 alumni have
bought either the tape, the book
or both, which sell for $39.95,
$14.95 and $49.95, respectively.

"We have to at least break even
before we go on with any more
video plans. We need to sell 5000
for us to feel good about it,"
Green said.
The Alumni Association had
been talking about producing a
video for the past year and a half,
said Green, who produced the
program. "We looked at what
was successful, and health and ex
ercise were the strongest sellers in
the video market," he said.
Originally, plans for the video
involved music and aerobics per
formed by the Stanford Band and
Dollies, "which would have been
interesting," Green said. "But we
thought we could do a better ser
vice to alumni if we did our
homework and put out a more
serious tape."
The video consists of four
parts: a 15-minute guide to self
assessment of strength, flexibility
and cardiovascular fitness; 40
minutes of advice from several of
Stanford's athletic stars; a 45-
minute aerobic workout with
three leaders exercising at three
different levels; and a 12-minute,
densely packed segment of short
clips featuring physiologists and
biochemists discussing the

benefits of exercise.
"The 'dense pack' comes at the
beginning to motivate you to ex
ercise," Green said. "And you
can go back to it if you need en
couragement along the way.
"We wanted to put out more
than just an aerobics tape,"
Green added. "Since two-thirds
of the alumni are men. we wanted
something that appealed to men
too." Women buy most of the ex
ercise videos on the market.
Green noted.
The video makes use of Stan
ford's world-class and Olympic
athletes in its "Sports Connec
tion" segment. Roscoe Tanner,
who made the finals of the 1979
Wimbledon tennis champion
ships, speaks on tennis. Marathon
runner Nancy Ditz shares some of
her warm-up exercises. Former
Olympic speed skater and current
bicyclist Eric Heiden offers ad
vice on equipment. Ex-49er quar
terback John Brodie talks about
his present sport, golf. And 1980
Olympian Kim Carlisle demon
strates warm-ups for swimming.
The 14 chapter handbook that
comes in a package with the video
discusses self-assessment, diet, in
juries and other topics in more
depth. "It contains quite a bit
that's not in the video," Green
said. "The two complement each
other."

The video cost $170,000 to
produce — not extravagant for
videos of its kind, according to
Green, who noted that some cost
up to $400,000. A production
company in Minnesota put up
some of the production costs and
as a result has the right to market
the tape nationally.
Green foresees future follow
up exercise videos that focus on

particular sports or age groups.
He also hopes to produce a teach
ing video featuring Stanford pro
fessors.
The new line of videos comple
ments a long list of existing prod
ucts and programs offered by the
Alumni Association, including
educational travel, the Portable
Stanford book series and Stan
ford's Sierra summer camp.

clips featuring physiologists and
biochemists discussing the

benefits of exercise.
"The 'dense pack' comes at the
beginning to motivate you to ex
ercise," Green said. "And you
can go back to it if you need en
couragement along the way.
"We wanted to put out more
than just an aerobics tape,"
Green added. "Since two-thirds
of the alumni are men. we wanted
something that appealed to men
too." Women buy most of the ex
ercise videos on the market.
Green noted.
The video makes use of Stan
ford's world-class and Olympic
athletes in its "Sports Connec
tion" segment. Roscoe Tanner,
who made the finals of the 1979
Wimbledon tennis champion
ships, speaks on tennis. Marathon
runner Nancy Ditz shares some of
her warm-up exercises. Former
Olympic speed skater and current
bicyclist Eric Heiden offers ad
vice on equipment. Ex-49er quar
terback John Brodie talks about
his present sport, golf. And 1980
Olympian Kim Carlisle demon
strates warm-ups for swimming.
The 14 chapter handbook that
comes in a package with the video
discusses self-assessment, diet, in
juries and other topics in more
depth. "It contains quite a bit
that's not in the video," Green
said. "The two complement each
other."

The video cost $170,000 to
produce — not extravagant for
videos of its kind, according to
Green, who noted that some cost
up to $400,000. A production
company in Minnesota put up
some of the production costs and
as a result has the right to market
the tape nationally.
Green foresees future follow
up exercise videos that focus on

particular sports or age groups.
He also hopes to produce a teach
ing video featuring Stanford pro
fessors.
The new line of videos comple
ments a long list of existing prod
ucts and programs offered by the
Alumni Association, including
educational travel, the Portable
Stanford book series and Stan
ford's Sierra summer camp.
