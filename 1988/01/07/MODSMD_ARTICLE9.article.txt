Dollar continues gain against yen
The dollar edged its way up further against other currencies
yesterday, boosted by a Japanese news report that the United
States, Japan and West Germany have agreed secretly to fix its
value within a range, although the three-day rally showed signs of
petering out late in the day.
The unconfirmed television report by the Japanese Broadcast
ing Corp., NHK, which said that the countries are seeking to
maintain a range for the dollar at somewhere between 120 and
140 yen, gave the market a sharp jolt upward. It was the latest in
a series of indications that the world's major industrial powers
have mounted an extraordinary, united effort to keep the U.S.
currency from returning to the unnerving, record lows it hit just a
few days ago.
"What the central banks have done is broken the perverse,
negative psychology that was affecting the dollar in recent
weeks," said Michael Moran, chief economist with Daiwa Securi
ties America in New York.
The dollar closed at 129 yen in New York trading, up from
127.55 yen at Tuesday's close. Late in the day, the dollar was
worth 1.6440 West German marks, up from 1.6290 marks late
Tuesday. The dollar's continued vitality spread at least some en
thusiasm to the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial
average closed up 6.30 points, following gains that totaled 92.67
points earlier in the week. A rising dollar encourages investors
because it reduces the likelihood of inflation and higher interest
rates.
White House drafting new budget
WASHINGTON — In an effort to minimize squabbles with
Congress over the federal deficit this year, the Reagan adminis
tration is drafting a fiscal 1989 budget that proposes, among
other things, a $370 million, or 39 percent, increase in funding
for AIDS programs and the elimination of a handful of federal
activities.
Earlier budgets had proposed the elimination of many govern
ment agencies and programs, proposals Congress generally
ignored.
Among the perennial targets that are again being proposed for
elimination by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are
the Interstate Commerce Commission, urban development ac
tion grants and the Economic Development Administration, ac
cording to administration officials. OMB also is seeking to end
the Small Business Administration direct loan program and
replace it with loan guarantees.
Partly in recognition of the political realities of an election
year, OMB is not even trying this time to eliminate some heavily
defended agencies, such as the Legal Services Corp., officials
said.
U.S. reviewing Gulf commitment
WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said
yesterday he will meet with President Reagan to review the size
of U.S. military forces in the Persian Gulf region after he returns
from a tour of the area next week.
"No decision has been made on any reductions," Carlucci said
of the 32-ship U.S. fleet, in a television interview from Bahrain.
"From time to time, one always looks at the mix of ships, de
pending on the nature of the threat, depending on how much of
the burden can be picked up by our allies."
Carlucci said the administration is not considering changing its
policy of protecting shipping interests in the Persian Gulf region,
particularly escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers.
Carlucci said he will discuss the naval operations with top mili
tary leaders and will review the "overall situation" with President
Reagan.
"Then it's possible decisions will be made," Carlucci said in an
interview on ABC-TV's "Good Morning America."
Asked yesterday at a White House ceremony if the United
States plans to withdraw ships from the Persian Gulf, President
Reagan said, "I don't answer questions, but that one's easy —
no."
Carlucci said, "We will always have in the gulf sufficient forces
to enable our men to protect themselves, but they will also be the
minimum number of forces needed to do the job."
Penn. oil spill moves downstream
PITTSBURGH — A drinking water crisis spawned by a
massive oil spill into the Monongahela and Ohio rivers eased
somewhat yesterday as a major utility resumed pumping heavily
filtered water into the depleted storage tanks in suburbs south of
here.
Water service was resumed for about 23,000 residents who
had been forced for two days to line up for emergency supplies
from military water trucks, and pressure went back up for an ad
ditional 300,000 residents who had been threatened with cutoffs.
Neverthelessj mandatory conservation measures were ex
pected to remain in effect through the weekend as cleanup efforts
continued in near-zero temperatures.
Meanwhile, several communities downstream in Ohio and
West Virginia had close calls with the slick, while others ner
vously awaited its arrival.
The contamination began last Saturday when an Ashland Oil
Co. holding tank ruptured at Floreffe, Pa., 25 miles south and
upstream from Pittsburgh, spilling one million gallons of diesel
fuel into the Monongahela, which flows into the Ohio at Pitts
burgh.
Ashland officials conceded that the company had never ob
tained a permit to erect the 40-year-old storage tank, which was
reassembled at Floreffe after being dismantled at another Ash
land facility near Cleveland. Moreover, the company conceded
that the reassembled tank had not been first filled completely
with water to test for leaks, as would normally be done.
Brezhnev nudged into obscurity
MOSCOW — The late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, who
ruled the Soviet Union for 18 years, was pushed closer to politi
cal obscurity yesterday by the Communist Party Central Com
mittee and the Soviet government.
Brezhnev's name was removed from a city, a district in Mos
cow and squares in Leningrad and Moscow, symbolizing his
public disgrace.
Since Mikhail Gorbachev assumed power in the spring of
1985, Brezhnev's star has been waning. He was accused of fos
tering social and economic "stagnation" during the late 1970s
and early 1980s.
After he died of a heart attack in November 1982, the city of
Naberezhnye Chelny in the Tatar Autonomous Republic was
renamed Brezhnev in his honor. The historic district of
Cheryomushki in Moscow was also renamed for Brezhnev and so
was the Red Guard Square in Leningrad and a new square in
Moscow.

127.55 yen at Tuesday's close. Late in the day, the dollar was
worth 1.6440 West German marks, up from 1.6290 marks late
Tuesday. The dollar's continued vitality spread at least some en
thusiasm to the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial
average closed up 6.30 points, following gains that totaled 92.67
points earlier in the week. A rising dollar encourages investors
because it reduces the likelihood of inflation and higher interest

White House drafting new budget
WASHINGTON — In an effort to minimize squabbles with
Congress over the federal deficit this year, the Reagan adminis
tration is drafting a fiscal 1989 budget that proposes, among
other things, a $370 million, or 39 percent, increase in funding
for AIDS programs and the elimination of a handful of federal
activities.
Earlier budgets had proposed the elimination of many govern
ment agencies and programs, proposals Congress generally
ignored.
Among the perennial targets that are again being proposed for
elimination by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are
the Interstate Commerce Commission, urban development ac
tion grants and the Economic Development Administration, ac
cording to administration officials. OMB also is seeking to end
the Small Business Administration direct loan program and
replace it with loan guarantees.
Partly in recognition of the political realities of an election
year, OMB is not even trying this time to eliminate some heavily
defended agencies, such as the Legal Services Corp., officials
said.
U.S. reviewing Gulf commitment
WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said
yesterday he will meet with President Reagan to review the size
of U.S. military forces in the Persian Gulf region after he returns
from a tour of the area next week.
"No decision has been made on any reductions," Carlucci said
of the 32-ship U.S. fleet, in a television interview from Bahrain.
"From time to time, one always looks at the mix of ships, de
pending on the nature of the threat, depending on how much of
the burden can be picked up by our allies."
Carlucci said the administration is not considering changing its
policy of protecting shipping interests in the Persian Gulf region,
particularly escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers.
Carlucci said he will discuss the naval operations with top mili
tary leaders and will review the "overall situation" with President
Reagan.
"Then it's possible decisions will be made," Carlucci said in an
interview on ABC-TV's "Good Morning America."
Asked yesterday at a White House ceremony if the United
States plans to withdraw ships from the Persian Gulf, President
Reagan said, "I don't answer questions, but that one's easy —
no."
Carlucci said, "We will always have in the gulf sufficient forces
to enable our men to protect themselves, but they will also be the
minimum number of forces needed to do the job."
Penn. oil spill moves downstream
PITTSBURGH — A drinking water crisis spawned by a
massive oil spill into the Monongahela and Ohio rivers eased
somewhat yesterday as a major utility resumed pumping heavily
filtered water into the depleted storage tanks in suburbs south of
here.
Water service was resumed for about 23,000 residents who
had been forced for two days to line up for emergency supplies
from military water trucks, and pressure went back up for an ad
ditional 300,000 residents who had been threatened with cutoffs.
Neverthelessj mandatory conservation measures were ex
pected to remain in effect through the weekend as cleanup efforts
continued in near-zero temperatures.
Meanwhile, several communities downstream in Ohio and
West Virginia had close calls with the slick, while others ner
vously awaited its arrival.
The contamination began last Saturday when an Ashland Oil
Co. holding tank ruptured at Floreffe, Pa., 25 miles south and
upstream from Pittsburgh, spilling one million gallons of diesel
fuel into the Monongahela, which flows into the Ohio at Pitts
burgh.
Ashland officials conceded that the company had never ob
tained a permit to erect the 40-year-old storage tank, which was
reassembled at Floreffe after being dismantled at another Ash
land facility near Cleveland. Moreover, the company conceded
that the reassembled tank had not been first filled completely
with water to test for leaks, as would normally be done.
Brezhnev nudged into obscurity
MOSCOW — The late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, who
ruled the Soviet Union for 18 years, was pushed closer to politi
cal obscurity yesterday by the Communist Party Central Com
mittee and the Soviet government.
Brezhnev's name was removed from a city, a district in Mos
cow and squares in Leningrad and Moscow, symbolizing his
public disgrace.
Since Mikhail Gorbachev assumed power in the spring of
1985, Brezhnev's star has been waning. He was accused of fos
tering social and economic "stagnation" during the late 1970s
and early 1980s.
After he died of a heart attack in November 1982, the city of
Naberezhnye Chelny in the Tatar Autonomous Republic was
renamed Brezhnev in his honor. The historic district of
Cheryomushki in Moscow was also renamed for Brezhnev and so
was the Red Guard Square in Leningrad and a new square in
Moscow.

Dollar continues gain against yen
The dollar edged its way up further against other currencies
yesterday, boosted by a Japanese news report that the United
States, Japan and West Germany have agreed secretly to fix its
value within a range, although the three-day rally showed signs of
petering out late in the day.
The unconfirmed television report by the Japanese Broadcast
ing Corp., NHK, which said that the countries are seeking to
maintain a range for the dollar at somewhere between 120 and
140 yen, gave the market a sharp jolt upward. It was the latest in
a series of indications that the world's major industrial powers
have mounted an extraordinary, united effort to keep the U.S.
currency from returning to the unnerving, record lows it hit just a
few days ago.
"What the central banks have done is broken the perverse,
negative psychology that was affecting the dollar in recent
weeks," said Michael Moran, chief economist with Daiwa Securi
ties America in New York.
The dollar closed at 129 yen in New York trading, up from
127.55 yen at Tuesday's close. Late in the day, the dollar was
worth 1.6440 West German marks, up from 1.6290 marks late
