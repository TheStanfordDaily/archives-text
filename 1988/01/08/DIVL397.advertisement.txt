Stop fooling around. Its time to get hardeore about software. With
Microsoft.
We'll give you all the resources you want. Tens of millions
in R&D funding. Along with one of the most elementary tools
for thinking — a door, which leads to your own private office. All
backed by management that truly c/ww speak your language,
because they probably helped write it.
We're serious about software design. If you are too, then
sign up for an on-campus interview.
Software Design Engineers
We're working on everything from compilers, operating systems,
and networking to sophisticated graphics, powerful productivity
software, and more. In fact we're working on some truly visionary
ideas we can't even reveal yet. You could be too, if you have pro
gramming experience and a background that includes micro's,
"C", 8086, UNIX*/XENIX ™, or MS-DOS®.
Program Managers
Instant responsibility. You select the features, you shape the prod
uct, you design the user interface for new generations of software.
Guide product development from programming through documen
tation and testing. Keep your product at the forefront of technology
by knowing your competition and product trends.
There are opportunities to work with our teams in applica
tions, systems, languages, or CD-ROM. If you're about to grad
uate with a B.S. in computer science, math or a related major,
we want to talk to you.
Microsoft offers you an opportunity to live and work where
the quality of life is high and the cost of living is low — the beau
tiful Pacific Northwest. Along with amenities such as a health
club membership, workout facilities and parcourse, plus an array
of benefits.
Begin by attending our on-campus interviews
on Tuesday, January 19. Contact your \
