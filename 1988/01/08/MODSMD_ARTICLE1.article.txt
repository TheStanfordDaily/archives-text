# BSU group learns from trip south

Seeking to increase the political
power of poor Southern farmers,
a group of 18 Stanford students
continues to travel today through
rural Alabama identifying poten
tial, but unregistered, voters.
Working with members of the
Federation of Southern Coopera
tives (FSC) — a 20 year-old or
ganization working to improve
economic conditions for poor
Southern farmers — the students
say they have seen firsthand the
harsh economic conditions in the
Deep South.
"We have learned an incredible
amount about the conditions of
abject poverty that exist in the
South," said sophomore Cheryl
Taylor, a member of the Stanford
group. The students are acting as
part of Project Democracy, a
black voter registration drive
sponsored by the Black Student
Union and the Public Service
Center and aided by private
donations.
The students traveled door-to
door in largely Perry
County earlier this week identify
ing unregistered voters and pro
moting political participation.
The students, traveling in groups
of two or three, encountered a
wide range of people, said sopho
more Dave Brown, one of six
white students in the group.
"We've seen some young
people who really understand lo
cal politics and don't take their
right to vote for granted because
they have seen what it can do," he
said.
Speaking last night from Ala
bama, Brown added that "we've
also seen others who are afraid to
vote because they think that they
will be put in jail. Some people
down here are still very afraid to
vote because of what happened
with the FBI voter fraud trials."
In the 19605, the FBI tried
several black grass roots organi
zations for voter fraud, accusing
them of forging absentee ballots,
Brown said.
According to Taylor, one of the
small black communities the
group visited while going door
to-door earlier this week mistook
the well-dressed, clipboard
carrying students for FBI agents.
Although increased black polit
ical power is Project Democracy's
main goal, Taylor said the stu
dents all recognize the impor
tance of the work the FSC is
doing to promote a strong eco-
nomic base for farmers in the
South.
According to Robert Singleton,
a member of the FSC board of
directors, the FSC works to pro
vide aid to both black and white
farmers in the South.

"Annually 500,000 acres of
farming land is given up or lost by
farmers, mainly black farmers,
every year," Singleton said.
The FSC trains farmers and
helps provide housing for the
homeless in 1 7 states, but its main
focus is western Alabama, where
many impoverished blacks live,
Singleton said.
Singleton praised the Stanford
group's efforts."lt is very uplift

ing to see these young and ener
getic (Stanford) students get in
volved," Singleton said. "This is
the first group of people from the
West that have come to help."
"People in the South have in
spired me with their struggle for
democracy," Brown said. "Basic
rights are being denied to people,
and it's good to see that people
are working hard to fight for
those riuhts."
