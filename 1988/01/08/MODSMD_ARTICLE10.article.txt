Condom vending machines will soon be installed
in restrooms in Tresidder Union, according to Tres
idder Union Board members who voted yesterday
to include informational literature with the
machines.
Council of Presidents member and board member
Leonard Adler said the machines should be in
stalled by the end of the month. Adler, a junior, co
authored the condom-machine proposal with junior
Preston Hammer.
The proposal was unanimously approved last
month by the board s Space and Operations Com
mittee. Hammer, chair of that committee, said the
decision "shows an awareness on the part of Tresid
der of the growing problems of AIDS and unwanted
pregnancies."
The board did not decide which brand of con
doms would be sold or if Tresidder would own the

machines or rent them from an outside company.
Adler said that once those decisions are made, in
stallation will proceed relatively quickly. Adler
noted that machines were installed in Encina Gym
in November within an hour after the decision was
made to acquire them.
At this point it is unclear where revenues from the
machines will go, Adler said. He predicted that
some of the money will probably be used to pay for
production of the informational brochures that will
be available near the machines. The brochures will
contain information on AIDS and other sexually
transmitted diseases and on the correct use of con
doms, Adler said.
Condom machines were installed in Roble and
Fncina Gyms in November. The Housing Opera
tions Advisory Committee is considering a similar
proposal to allow dormitories to decide whether to
have condom machines in their bathrooms, but has
not yet made a final decision.
