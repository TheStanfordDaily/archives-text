# Hewlett, Scully endorse prof. for Congress
## Campbell bid gets boost 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Stanford Law Prof. Tom
Campbell's bid for Congress
received a major boost Wed
nesday when Apple Computer
Chairman John Scully and Bill
Hewlett, co-founder of Hew
lett-Packard, publicly endorsed
his candidacy.
The blessings of the two com
puter magnates followed bil
lionaire industrialist David
Packard's October commitment
to be honorary co-chair of
Campbell's campaign. The 35-
year-old professor is attempting
to unseat first-term Republican
incumbent Ernie Konnyu of
Saratoga in the June primary
for the 12th Congressional Dis
trict, which includes Stanford.
In a prepared statement,
Scully said, "At this critical
time, we need the best. . . . Tom
Campbell can bring the U.S.
back to international competi
tiveness."
"The news is good,"

Campbell said in a Wednesday
telephone interview. "As of
Dec. 31, we have raised almost
$ 125,000. That is against a goal
of $100,000."
Campbell said it would
"probably take around
$500,000 in contributions by
June to win. If we keep up this

pace, we'll make it. I'm
gratified." Campbell said a
detailed breakdown of mone
tary contributions to his cam
paign would be available after
the first filing deadline at the
end of January.
John Crane, Konnyu's press
secretary in Washington, D C.,
said fund-raising figures for the
congressman were unavailable.
Crane said Konnyu has not yet
formally declared his candidacy
for re-election and has no plans
to do so in the near future. Lo
cal political observers agree,
though, that Konnyu is
definitely taking steps to raise
his political profile, as the con
gressman's use of his free
mailing privilege, or "frank
ing/' has increased dramatically
over the past two months.
According to Karen Miranda,
Campbell's campaign manager,
Packard's association with the
campaign has helped fund
raising efforts. "Packard has
taken a very active role,"
Miranda said.
