## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Crisis will continue 
### 
As the University's week-long effort to re
locate the 294 Roble Hall residents draws to a
close, students should be commended for their
admirable calm in the face of this crisis. Likewise,
the University deserves praise for its smooth
handling of the evacuation and relocation.
The displaced Roble residents have shown
considerable adaptability and good humor in
light of the fact they have been completely
uprooted from their homes. Similarly, those stu
dents who have taken in new roommates under
rather crowded situations have for the most part
been sympathetic and welcoming.
The University responded well to the
monumental logistical challenge of evacuating its
largest dormitory on short notice. The relocation
process has proceeded with remarkable effi
ciency.
Today, at week's end, all 294 former Roble

residents have been moved with a minimum of
extra hassle or frustration. The University is
doing what it can for the "Roble refugees." A
special Roble center was set up in Tresidder Un
ion to provide information on new assignments,
moving hours and costs for room and board. Dis
placed upperclassmen will receive another year
of guaranteed housing. Also, the University has
given Roble students the option of canceling their
housing contracts up to Feb. 12 in the event their
new residences are not satisfactory.
An encouraging sense of community and con
cern was displayed at Stanford this week. But this
understanding and goodwill will have to last in
the weeks and months to come. Human nature
being what is, tempers will flare and nerves will
become strained because of crowded conditions.
Students and administrators alike will have to
work to keep an open mind, as this crisis will be
felt well into next year.
