## Single-sex clubs justified 
### 
We must take exception to several statements in
your editorial of Nov. 17, "No Bohemians, Please."
; "The Bohemian Club," states the editorial, "is an
organization dedicated to elitism and sexism of the
most reactionary kind."
The Bohemian Club, in truth, is dedicated to art,
literature, music, drama, and its members devote

their club activities primarily to those objects and
the support of them. In order to foster the diversity
and talent of the membership, some 36 percent of
the members pay either no dues or modest dues and
&o or little admission fee. We have members from
$11 walks of life, and we have members of virtually
every "class" of minorities that has been
categorized in law — minorities of race, religion, na
tional origin, sexual orientation and physical dis
ability. In a sense, a sizeable proportion of our
membership is supported by other club resources on
a "scholarship" or "fellowship" basis not unlike
what universities provide.
The club stages some 90 entertainments a year,
,janging from readings and recitals to dramatic and
ifliusical plays and concerts, virtually all produced,
"written and performed by club members on a volun
teer basis.
* At many of these entertainments, women are
guests, both at the city club and at the
Bohemian Grove. Women are also welcome guests
members at private functions at the city club and
* Grove and are always extended every courtesy and
* every bit of hospitality the club can muster.
We prefer, however, to be an all-male club in our
* membership. I think that choice is ours to make as a
private social club in a presumably free society. San
/ Francisco has several all-male, all-female and
mixed-gender clubs; men and women can choose
* the one they want to seek membership in.
* The idea that men and women must be mandated
into social association during their private lives in
\ their leisure hours, and in their avocational pursuits,
j is a notion absurd as well as tyrannical. A govern
* Ynent that legislates unisex in private social clubs will
* next be telling us whom we can associate with in our
« private homes.
{ It has become facilely fashionable to term the
« Bohemian Club "elitist" and "reactionary" merely
J because some of its known members are prominent
( and because some are considered politically conser

vative. Thai is a very superficial view of a club
whose membership includes men talented in the arts
and letters and men active in the leadership and
support of a broad spectrum of civic, welfare, cul
tural, political and civil rights causes. And it is ironic
that a club labeled "elitist" counts among its late
members two of the era's judicial champions of
human rights— U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert
Jackson, who served as chief prosecutor of the
Nuremberg Tribunal, and Chief Justice Earl War
ren, who led the U.S. Supreme Court to its historic
civil rights decisions.
I'd like to note that a very participatory member
of the Bohemian Club was the late Stanford presi
dent, J. E. Wallace Sterling, whose leadership en
riched the University's heritage and greatly diver
sified its character. Countless Stanford alumni are
members of the club and have made some of its
most distinguished artistic contributions while at the
same time more than carrying their weight in worthy
civic and community causes (including the Stanford
fund-raising campaigns whose proceeds provide
scholarships and other enhancements for the Uni
versity.)
If things like this are "reactionary elitism," what,
then, is enlightened liberalism?
Now, as for the assertion in the editorial that the
Bohemian Club "actively cultivates an informal as
sociation with Stanford by allowing Stanford faculty
to join at reduced rates, etc." It is not, in fact, an
"active cultivation" with Stanford faculty; it is,
rather, a receptivity to interested faculty members
of universities across the United States. We think
such faculty members add to the club's diversity and
intellectual fabric. Some of our finest theatrical
directors, musicians and composers, authors,
performers and stage technicians are from the
faculties of Bay Area and other American univer
sities (as well as from the faculties of Bay Area high
schools.) What in the world is wrong with that? I
should think sensible people would applaud the
Bohemian Club's valuing the participation of the ac
ademic community.
A final word about elitism: An eminent university
like Stanford, where the annual tuition is in five fig
ures and where graduates are recruited by business,
industry and the professions at starting salaries not
far removed from the annual earnings of a 45-year
old Bohemian club member, is not exactly a
proletarian institution, though it indeed may be, like
the Bohemian Club, egalitarian in its camaraderie,
activities and spirit.
George Elliott is president of the Bohemian Club.
