Students should
do own cooking
Bruce Klein's recent article on
Food Service (Daily, Nov. 30)
was clearly intended to he a
refreshing denunciation of that
revered Stanford institution, put
ting to words what each of us feels
instinctively every time we are
presented with another eggplant
stackup or some such culinary
work of art.
Indeed, I would he among the
first to agree heartily with his
terse conclusion, "Eliminate Uni
versity Food Service and establish
a kitchen in each residence."
However, the distressingly soph
omoric tone of his article
trivializes the issues at hand and
ignores concerns which ought to
he central to the discussion.
The essential question, asserts
Klein, is how many good meals I
can have provided for me each
week and still effectively ensure
sufficient cash flow for the even
tual purchase of handy items like
stereos and cars. (Need I mention
that many students already can't
afford tuition and avoid Food
Service just to make ends meet?)
On a hasic level he's right, of
course: Who wants to waste
money?
To that end Glenn Smith's
short letter (Daily, Dec. 4)
linking the most appealing finan
cial situation to that of co-ops is a
perfectly reasonable response.
Not surprisingly, it tacitly admits
that the way to Stanford students'
hearts is through their pocket
books. He rightly perceives that
one must virtually apologize for,
and certainly play down, the aw
ful specter of the several hours of
manual labor tied to these
savings.
Klein maligns the institution
and its workers, a tactic
guaranteed to elicit a "we take
pride in our product and are of
fended by your attack" letter
from someone in the Food Ser
vice bureaucracy. Klein looses a
bit of invective on our behalf, and
we wait for another round of this
sort of thing next quarter or next
year. The tentacles of boredom
begin to strangulate.
Let's be more radical than that.
We should be questioning the
premise behind an institution like

Food Service. In case you had not
noticed, Stanford has a thriving
service industry. Few of us toss
and turn at night about the
"plight" of its members. I cer
tainly won't claim to have done
so. But see if you can keep a
straight face and summon a few
really compelling reasons why we
should have a specific segment of
the Stanford population set aside
for the sole purpose of tending to
our dietary needs, while they earn
both our scorn and dead-end
wages. Try to avoid responses
that smack of the "student's
higher mission" and the need to
be unencumbered by such a
plebeian task as making one's
own meal.
Klein's appeal appears to be,
"Have your cake and eat it, too,"
with your meal plan. I just wish
that didn't leave me with the un
comfortable feeling that he is
merely reinforcing an attitude
that regards such privilege as a
given, a natural outgrowth of our
superior status as students at
Stanford. The classism is subtle
and doubtless unintended, but it
lends a bad aftertaste to his
denunciations. He's right: Food
service (the generic concept)
should be abolished. We can take
care of ourselves.

Bird poisoning is
barbaric, arrogant
As an ornithologist, theoretical
ecologist and frequent user of
Tresidder I was appalled by a
front page article (Daily, Jan. 7)
"Poison grain used in war on
Tresidder birds." The article
details the laying of "tainted
grain" for the purpose of killing
birds in and around Tresidder
Union. Before discussing both the
stupidity and cruelty of this ac
tion, one fact needs to be cleared
up. First, the species of bird con
cerned is Brewer's blackbird
(indigenous), not the starling
(introduced pest), as stated by the
assistant director of Tresidder.
Many other species of bird reg
ularly feed in and around Tresid
der, including the house finch,
house sparrow, red-winged black
bird and scrub jays. Starlings are
occasionally present. Dispensing
the grain on the roof "in order to

limit its availability to other
animals" is just one example of
the stupidity of this action — be
cause, surprisingly, most birds can
fly, and many mammals climb.
The actions of Tresidder show
remarkable cruelty and lack of
forethought for a variety of
reasons. First, the method of
removing the birds is both
distressing and cruel. It is bad
enough that some birds should
die because arrogant homo
sapiens do not like them around
while eating lunch. It is worse that
the method of death is so distress
ing.
A friend and I noticed the
strange behavior of some
Brewer's blackbirds Dec. 30.
Very few birds were about, but
those that were present were flap
ping haplessly. One bird, after
spiraling several times, flew to the
ground. A student walking past
the bird placed both his feet
around the bird (without touching
it) before the bird flew straight
into the side of the building. A
more distressing form of death, or
sickness, is difficult to imagine.
The article states that this bar
baric act is to be repeated every
two months (which will undoubt
edly provide a good source of
income to Crane Pest Control).
Clearly the solution is not ade
quate.
Indeed, were Tresidder or
Crane to find out something
about the population biology of
these birds (perhaps they could
start by working out which
species is concerned) they would
know that removing or scaring
the birds is only a temporary solu
tion. Food is the reason why the
birds are present, and reducing its
supply is the obvious humane so
lution. By reducing food spillage
and cleaning the area more effi
ciently the problem may be
solved.
Personally I find the blackbirds
both charming and amusing lunch
companions. Indeed the feeding
activities of the blackbirds may be
doing us a favor by reducing
populations of less desirable
scavengers such as rats, flies and
ants. I hope that those people
who have complained about the
birds feel happy that innocent
animals are dying horrible deaths
for their convenience.

Students should
do own cooking
Bruce Klein's recent article on
Food Service (Daily, Nov. 30)
was clearly intended to he a
refreshing denunciation of that
revered Stanford institution, put
ting to words what each of us feels
instinctively every time we are
presented with another eggplant
stackup or some such culinary
work of art.
Indeed, I would he among the
first to agree heartily with his
terse conclusion, "Eliminate Uni
versity Food Service and establish
a kitchen in each residence."
However, the distressingly soph
omoric tone of his article
trivializes the issues at hand and
ignores concerns which ought to
he central to the discussion.
The essential question, asserts
Klein, is how many good meals I
can have provided for me each
week and still effectively ensure
sufficient cash flow for the even
tual purchase of handy items like
stereos and cars. (Need I mention
that many students already can't
afford tuition and avoid Food
Service just to make ends meet?)
On a hasic level he's right, of
course: Who wants to waste
money?
To that end Glenn Smith's
short letter (Daily, Dec. 4)
linking the most appealing finan
cial situation to that of co-ops is a
perfectly reasonable response.
Not surprisingly, it tacitly admits
that the way to Stanford students'
hearts is through their pocket
books. He rightly perceives that
one must virtually apologize for,
and certainly play down, the aw
ful specter of the several hours of
manual labor tied to these
savings.
Klein maligns the institution
and its workers, a tactic
guaranteed to elicit a "we take
pride in our product and are of
fended by your attack" letter
from someone in the Food Ser
vice bureaucracy. Klein looses a
bit of invective on our behalf, and
we wait for another round of this
sort of thing next quarter or next
year. The tentacles of boredom
begin to strangulate.
Let's be more radical than that.
We should be questioning the
premise behind an institution like

Food Service. In case you had not
noticed, Stanford has a thriving
service industry. Few of us toss
and turn at night about the
"plight" of its members. I cer
tainly won't claim to have done
so. But see if you can keep a
straight face and summon a few
really compelling reasons why we
should have a specific segment of
the Stanford population set aside
for the sole purpose of tending to
our dietary needs, while they earn
both our scorn and dead-end
wages. Try to avoid responses
that smack of the "student's
higher mission" and the need to
be unencumbered by such a
plebeian task as making one's
own meal.
Klein's appeal appears to be,
"Have your cake and eat it, too,"
with your meal plan. I just wish
that didn't leave me with the un
comfortable feeling that he is
merely reinforcing an attitude
that regards such privilege as a
given, a natural outgrowth of our
superior status as students at
Stanford. The classism is subtle
and doubtless unintended, but it
lends a bad aftertaste to his
denunciations. He's right: Food
service (the generic concept)
should be abolished. We can take
care of ourselves.

Bird poisoning is
barbaric, arrogant
As an ornithologist, theoretical
ecologist and frequent user of
Tresidder I was appalled by a
front page article (Daily, Jan. 7)
"Poison grain used in war on
Tresidder birds." The article
details the laying of "tainted
grain" for the purpose of killing
birds in and around Tresidder
Union. Before discussing both the
stupidity and cruelty of this ac
tion, one fact needs to be cleared
up. First, the species of bird con
cerned is Brewer's blackbird
(indigenous), not the starling
(introduced pest), as stated by the
assistant director of Tresidder.
Many other species of bird reg
ularly feed in and around Tresid
der, including the house finch,
house sparrow, red-winged black
bird and scrub jays. Starlings are
occasionally present. Dispensing
the grain on the roof "in order to

limit its availability to other
animals" is just one example of
the stupidity of this action — be
cause, surprisingly, most birds can
fly, and many mammals climb.
The actions of Tresidder show
remarkable cruelty and lack of
forethought for a variety of
reasons. First, the method of
removing the birds is both
distressing and cruel. It is bad
enough that some birds should
die because arrogant homo
sapiens do not like them around
while eating lunch. It is worse that
the method of death is so distress
ing.
A friend and I noticed the
strange behavior of some
Brewer's blackbirds Dec. 30.
Very few birds were about, but
those that were present were flap
ping haplessly. One bird, after
spiraling several times, flew to the
ground. A student walking past
the bird placed both his feet
around the bird (without touching
it) before the bird flew straight
into the side of the building. A
more distressing form of death, or
sickness, is difficult to imagine.
The article states that this bar
baric act is to be repeated every
two months (which will undoubt
edly provide a good source of
income to Crane Pest Control).
Clearly the solution is not ade
quate.
Indeed, were Tresidder or
Crane to find out something
about the population biology of
these birds (perhaps they could
start by working out which
species is concerned) they would
know that removing or scaring
the birds is only a temporary solu
tion. Food is the reason why the
birds are present, and reducing its
supply is the obvious humane so
lution. By reducing food spillage
and cleaning the area more effi
ciently the problem may be
solved.
Personally I find the blackbirds
both charming and amusing lunch
companions. Indeed the feeding
activities of the blackbirds may be
doing us a favor by reducing
populations of less desirable
scavengers such as rats, flies and
ants. I hope that those people
who have complained about the
birds feel happy that innocent
animals are dying horrible deaths
for their convenience.
