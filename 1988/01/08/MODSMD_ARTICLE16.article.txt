# The 						Fall of the House of Reagan
## 
### 
The Democratic Party has taken quite a
thrashing over the past year or so for failing to
produce a messiah for this great but oh-so
froubled land of ours.
r

j The party that gave us FDR and JFK has
:given us Gary Hart, "undecided" and some
?mighty appealing non-candidates. But mark
fc my words, the attention will soon focus on the
-Republicans, and all that conservative
(laughter you've been hearing will cease and
idesist as soon as the American people realize
Jone of the central realities of the '88 race: The
; Republicans aren't in much better shape than
,the Democrats.
1 The predominant feeling among most Dem
iocrats (and just about everyone else) is that
! the best people are not running. Despite the
(inability of any of the announced candidates
|to catch fire (as of yet), Mario Cuomo, Sam
'Nunn, Bill Bradley and other prominent
;• Democrats sit and watch on the sidelines.
In addition, there is the feeling that the
Democratic Party has become the party of
Jleft-wing special interest groups and has lost
ttouch with its traditional base, thereby assur
ing itself of defeat in the electorally crucial
(South.
Compounding these problems is the Re
publican Party itself. After the fall of the
I

House of Reagan, the pressure for the Demo
crats to regain power increased substantially.
Last year should have been the year when the
Democrats clobbered the Republicans. But as
any good baseball hitter can tell you,
sometimes the hardest pitch to hit a home run
off of is the nice, easy, slow pitch. It seems to
me that the Democrats failed to hit the
Republicans change-up out of the political
park, and for that they are being cursed with
Gary Hart.
There is no question that the Democrats
have some real problems. But let's assume for
the sake of argument (and for the sake of
good, clean fun) that the American people
look over the Democratic candidates and
completely reject everything they see. They
will naturally turn to the Republicans. But
alas, they will see most of the same problems:
division, confusion and the failure to produce
a unifying candidate.
The Republican Party is the party of Pat
Robertson, Jack Kemp and Robert Dole.
There are the social conservatives, the eco
nomic supply-siders, the anti-communists, the
old right and the new right and various other
fiolitical hybrids. Ever since Iran-contra, the
ar right has been lambasting its old friend
Ronald Reagan and his "moderate" (what a
dirty word!) friends George Shultz and
Howard Baker for giving in on everything
from Robert Bork to the recently signed
missile treaty.
This division results from two things: ideo
logical disputes and tactical differences. The
first has been a historic problem for
Republicans, and the second has become es
pecially more noticeable in the later Reagan
years.

Just as William Buckley had a tough time
trying to put together the staff of the National
Review back in the 19505, so too does today's
Republican Party have a difficult time pulling
together all of its disparate elements.
That is why Ronald Reagan was so success
ful. He convinced all of these groups to put
aside their differences and unite behind him to
fight communists and high taxes. But there is
much debate over how to sustain the conser
vative "revolution" once the Gipper leaves
office.
There is the Pat Buchanan wing of the party
that says, fund the contras, develop SDI, cut
spending and to hell with everyone else. Go
ahead and impeach us if you want to, but
we're going to go down fighting.
Then there is the Bob Dole wing of the
party that preaches the virtue of compromise.
Bob Dole's main appeal is that he is
"electable" and knows how to get things
done. In this view, it is better to consult with
Joe Biden and agree to confirm Judge An
thony Kennedy than to send in the highly con
troversial Judge Bork.
Whatever can be said about the Republican
candidates, there is certainly not a Reagan
amongst them. Each candidate seems to rep
resent a distinct constituency. It is true that
Dole and Bush have high name recognition,
experience and strong campaigns. But I
predict that when Americans get close to the
voting booth and look straight in the face of a
Bush or a Dole victory they will scream from
the highest mountains, "Isn't there anybody
else?"
My money's on the non-candidate from
New York.

?mighty appealing non-candidates. But mark
fc my words, the attention will soon focus on the
-Republicans, and all that conservative
(laughter you've been hearing will cease and
idesist as soon as the American people realize
Jone of the central realities of the '88 race: The
; Republicans aren't in much better shape than
,the Democrats.
1 The predominant feeling among most Dem
iocrats (and just about everyone else) is that
! the best people are not running. Despite the
(inability of any of the announced candidates
|to catch fire (as of yet), Mario Cuomo, Sam
'Nunn, Bill Bradley and other prominent
;• Democrats sit and watch on the sidelines.
In addition, there is the feeling that the
Democratic Party has become the party of
Jleft-wing special interest groups and has lost
ttouch with its traditional base, thereby assur
ing itself of defeat in the electorally crucial
(South.
Compounding these problems is the Re
publican Party itself. After the fall of the
I

House of Reagan, the pressure for the Demo
crats to regain power increased substantially.
Last year should have been the year when the
Democrats clobbered the Republicans. But as
any good baseball hitter can tell you,
sometimes the hardest pitch to hit a home run
off of is the nice, easy, slow pitch. It seems to
me that the Democrats failed to hit the
Republicans change-up out of the political
park, and for that they are being cursed with
Gary Hart.
There is no question that the Democrats
have some real problems. But let's assume for
the sake of argument (and for the sake of
good, clean fun) that the American people
look over the Democratic candidates and
completely reject everything they see. They
will naturally turn to the Republicans. But
alas, they will see most of the same problems:
division, confusion and the failure to produce
a unifying candidate.
The Republican Party is the party of Pat
Robertson, Jack Kemp and Robert Dole.
There are the social conservatives, the eco
nomic supply-siders, the anti-communists, the
old right and the new right and various other
fiolitical hybrids. Ever since Iran-contra, the
ar right has been lambasting its old friend
Ronald Reagan and his "moderate" (what a
dirty word!) friends George Shultz and
Howard Baker for giving in on everything
from Robert Bork to the recently signed
missile treaty.
This division results from two things: ideo
logical disputes and tactical differences. The
first has been a historic problem for
Republicans, and the second has become es
pecially more noticeable in the later Reagan
years.

Just as William Buckley had a tough time
trying to put together the staff of the National
Review back in the 19505, so too does today's
Republican Party have a difficult time pulling
together all of its disparate elements.
That is why Ronald Reagan was so success
ful. He convinced all of these groups to put
aside their differences and unite behind him to
fight communists and high taxes. But there is
much debate over how to sustain the conser
vative "revolution" once the Gipper leaves
office.
There is the Pat Buchanan wing of the party
that says, fund the contras, develop SDI, cut
spending and to hell with everyone else. Go
ahead and impeach us if you want to, but
we're going to go down fighting.
Then there is the Bob Dole wing of the
party that preaches the virtue of compromise.
Bob Dole's main appeal is that he is
"electable" and knows how to get things
done. In this view, it is better to consult with
Joe Biden and agree to confirm Judge An
thony Kennedy than to send in the highly con
troversial Judge Bork.
Whatever can be said about the Republican
candidates, there is certainly not a Reagan
amongst them. Each candidate seems to rep
resent a distinct constituency. It is true that
Dole and Bush have high name recognition,
experience and strong campaigns. But I
predict that when Americans get close to the
voting booth and look straight in the face of a
Bush or a Dole victory they will scream from
the highest mountains, "Isn't there anybody
else?"
My money's on the non-candidate from
New York.
