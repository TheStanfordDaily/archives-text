## Viennese Ball Shall We Dance? 
### Jennifer Collins Staff writer 
This year, even students
who've never waltzed before
may still take to the floor with
confidence at the 11th annual
Viennese Ball Feb. 3.
Beginning this Sunday, the
Stanford Ballroom and Social
Dance Club will offer a special
series of dance classes designed
to teach the Viennese Waltz
and other ballroom dances to
students who plan to attend the
ball.
The club's Winter Quarter
Dance Series will continue for
six weeks. The first two ses
sions will concentrate on Vien
nese Waltz and Polka in prepa
ration for the Ball, while later
classes will teach the Rumba
and the Samba.
According to sophomore
Elaine Lissner, director of
publicity for the club, the Stan
ford Ballroom and Social
Dance Club is a small but
growing organization that was
founded last year to encourage
students to become involved in
ballroom dancing.
"If you like music and you
like athletics, or like to move in
any way, then [ballroom danc
ing] is something you should
really enjoy," said senior Mike
McCulloch, director of opera
tions for the club. He added
that learning to dance can be a
rewarding experience in itself.
"Ballroom dancing is experi
encing a nationwide revival,"
Lissner said. She added that
learning to dance today, even

for the immediate goal of par
ticipating in the Viennese Ball,
will provide students with an
important social skill in years
to come.
Even for students who aren't
interested in social dancing,
learning to dance before the
Viennese Ball is still "a won
derful idea" that will make the
event all the more enjoyable,
said senior Laura Yansouni, a
ball organizer.
Yansouni said that the for
mal will feature two rooms of
dancing, one with an orchestra
playing waltzes and polkas and
one with a band playing swing
music.
To enjoy each style of dance,
Yansouni recommended that
students take both the Stan
ford Ballroom Dance Club
classes as well as the basic
waltz and swing dance instruc
tion that the Viennese Ball
Committee traditionally offers
to large groups of ticketholders
during the week before the
dance.
Lissner emphasized that stu
dents need not attend classes
with a partner because instruc
tors focus on teaching students
to dance with many different
partners.
Ballroom dance classes will
meet Sundays from 4 to 5 p.m.
in the Old Union Clubhouse
An additional class, offered
from 3 to 4 p.m on the same
days, will specialize in different
dances. Students may attend
one class per week for $18 or
both classes for $30.
