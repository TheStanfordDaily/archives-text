## Not enough good '87 films for a top 10 list 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
1987 was not a good year for
movies.
Despite the fact that a record
$4.2 billion was earned at the box
office last year, I can't think of
one 1987 movie that stands out as
an obvious choice for "best film
of the year."
It seems the critics can't make
up their minds either. In the past
few weeks, the major critical
prizes haven't been too consistent
in their top choices. Usually, at
least two organizations are able to
agree on a movie, but not this
year; all the choices are different.
The National Board of Review
voted Steven Spielberg's "Empire
of the Sun" as the best picture of
the year; the Los Angeles Film
Critics Association opted for
"Hope and Glory;" the New
York Film Critics Circle awarded
its top prize to "Broadcast
News;" and the National Society
of Film Critics named John Hus
ton's "The Dead" as 1987's best
film.
More erratic still are the
Golden Globe nominations,
which include such offbeat entries
as "Baby Boom," "Dirty Danc
ing" and "La Bamba." Mention
ing all these film titles makes it
sound like 1987 was a big year for
good films, but it wasn't.
In compiling a top 10 list
(which all film critics do, so 1
might as well), I could only come
up with seven movies. Although I
didn't like most of the movies 1
saw in 1987, there are some that 1
missed.
I admit I have yet to see "Hope
and Glory," "The Dead" and
"Moonstruck," but I consciously

avoided "Jean de Florette,"
"Matewan" and "Nuts." A few
critically praised films that I did
see but didn't necessarily like all
that much were "Empire of the
Sun," "Cry Freedom" and "Rox
anne."
So, here they are, the seven
movies that stand out in my mind
as the most original, entertaining,
well-written and well-acted films
of the year. I'll list them from
"worst" to "best" to build up the
suspense.
"Fatal Attraction." I'm not
really sure why I liked this movie.
All I know is that it's a really
scary movie for men and a real
downer for feminists, since it
portrays independent women as
unstable, possessive and psy
chopathic— actually, that's prob
ably why I liked it (just kidding).
My one big problem with
"Fatal Attraction" was the end
ing. Contrived and overdone, it
cashed in on cheap thrills at the
expense of an otherwise good
story.
"Lethal Weapon." This was, by
far, the year's best action picture.
Although the plot was unneces
sarily convoluted, there was a lot
of good violence, and Mel Gibson
and Danny Glover made a nice
team as the two-fisted cops.
"Wall Street." I walked into
this movie with low expectations,
since I hadn't liked director
Oliver Stone's last movie, "Pla
toon," all that much. However, I
did find myself getting caught up
in the movie's realistic atmos
phere of greed and moral corrup
tion.
So, it was a real letdown for me
when the movie started getting all
mushy and moralistic at the end.
However, this film does have the

year's best and most outrageous
performance: Michael Douglas as
the greedy, scheming and hilar
ious Gordon Gekko.
"Broadcast News." 1 walked
into this movie with extremely
high expectations, generated by a
blitz of media praise. I walked out
of the movie thinking I had seen a
good movie, but I wasn't
altogether satisfied.
At any rate, director-writer
producer James Brooks has made

an intelligent, witty and well
acted movie. Who could ask for
much more than that?
"Barfly." This is definitely the
most unusual and daring movie of
the year. I really didn't think I'd
like this movie because I hate
Mickey Roarke as an actor; but I
was pleasantly surprised to find
that this was an original, funny
and very literate movie.
I even liked Mickey Roarke.
Although he still plays his charac

ters with an annoying smugness,
he had me convinced that he
really was a grungy, down-and
out poet who truly suffers for his
art.
"The Last Emperor." The
movie is too long and should have
concentrated more on the elabo
rate, colorful, fascinating child
hood days of the emperor. But
other than that, this is a very good
movie. This is truly an epic film,
the kind they don't make any
more.

"Full Metal Jacket." Now, this
is my kind of film . . . bold, cyni
cal, uncompromising. It literally
blows everything else off the
screen with its totally dispas
sionate study of man as a cold
blooded killing machine.
I tend to agree with most critics
that the film loses much of its
steam toward the end, but who
can forget the scenes when the
soldiers are shot down one by one
by a single sniper? In my opinion,
this is the year's best film.

this is the year's best film.

1987 was not a good year for
movies.
Despite the fact that a record
$4.2 billion was earned at the box
office last year, I can't think of
one 1987 movie that stands out as
an obvious choice for "best film
of the year."
It seems the critics can't make
up their minds either. In the past
few weeks, the major critical
prizes haven't been too consistent
in their top choices. Usually, at
least two organizations are able to
agree on a movie, but not this
year; all the choices are different.
The National Board of Review
voted Steven Spielberg's "Empire
of the Sun" as the best picture of
the year; the Los Angeles Film
Critics Association opted for
"Hope and Glory;" the New
York Film Critics Circle awarded
its top prize to "Broadcast
News;" and the National Society
of Film Critics named John Hus
ton's "The Dead" as 1987's best
film.
More erratic still are the
Golden Globe nominations,
which include such offbeat entries
as "Baby Boom," "Dirty Danc
ing" and "La Bamba." Mention
ing all these film titles makes it
sound like 1987 was a big year for
good films, but it wasn't.
In compiling a top 10 list
(which all film critics do, so 1
might as well), I could only come
up with seven movies. Although I
didn't like most of the movies 1
saw in 1987, there are some that 1
missed.
I admit I have yet to see "Hope
and Glory," "The Dead" and
"Moonstruck," but I consciously

avoided "Jean de Florette,"
"Matewan" and "Nuts." A few
critically praised films that I did
see but didn't necessarily like all
that much were "Empire of the
Sun," "Cry Freedom" and "Rox
anne."
So, here they are, the seven
movies that stand out in my mind
as the most original, entertaining,
well-written and well-acted films
of the year. I'll list them from
"worst" to "best" to build up the
suspense.
"Fatal Attraction." I'm not
really sure why I liked this movie.
All I know is that it's a really
scary movie for men and a real
downer for feminists, since it
portrays independent women as
unstable, possessive and psy
chopathic— actually, that's prob
ably why I liked it (just kidding).
My one big problem with
"Fatal Attraction" was the end
ing. Contrived and overdone, it
cashed in on cheap thrills at the
expense of an otherwise good
story.
"Lethal Weapon." This was, by
far, the year's best action picture.
Although the plot was unneces
sarily convoluted, there was a lot
of good violence, and Mel Gibson
and Danny Glover made a nice
team as the two-fisted cops.
"Wall Street." I walked into
this movie with low expectations,
since I hadn't liked director
Oliver Stone's last movie, "Pla
toon," all that much. However, I
did find myself getting caught up
in the movie's realistic atmos
phere of greed and moral corrup
tion.
So, it was a real letdown for me
when the movie started getting all
mushy and moralistic at the end.
However, this film does have the

year's best and most outrageous
performance: Michael Douglas as
the greedy, scheming and hilar
ious Gordon Gekko.
"Broadcast News." 1 walked
into this movie with extremely
high expectations, generated by a
blitz of media praise. I walked out
of the movie thinking I had seen a
good movie, but I wasn't
altogether satisfied.
At any rate, director-writer
producer James Brooks has made

an intelligent, witty and well
acted movie. Who could ask for
much more than that?
"Barfly." This is definitely the
most unusual and daring movie of
the year. I really didn't think I'd
like this movie because I hate
Mickey Roarke as an actor; but I
was pleasantly surprised to find
that this was an original, funny
and very literate movie.
I even liked Mickey Roarke.
Although he still plays his charac

ters with an annoying smugness,
he had me convinced that he
really was a grungy, down-and
out poet who truly suffers for his
art.
"The Last Emperor." The
movie is too long and should have
concentrated more on the elabo
rate, colorful, fascinating child
hood days of the emperor. But
other than that, this is a very good
movie. This is truly an epic film,
the kind they don't make any
more.

"Full Metal Jacket." Now, this
is my kind of film . . . bold, cyni
cal, uncompromising. It literally
blows everything else off the
screen with its totally dispas
sionate study of man as a cold
blooded killing machine.
I tend to agree with most critics
that the film loses much of its
steam toward the end, but who
can forget the scenes when the
soldiers are shot down one by one
by a single sniper? In my opinion,
this is the year's best film.
