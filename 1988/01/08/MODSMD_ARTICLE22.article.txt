# Spielberg drops bomb with overdone 'Empire'
## 
### Jennifer Reese Staff writer 
Steven Spielberg doesn't make
small movies.
He's obviously a director with a
taste for the expensive and the
grandiose, which is forgivable so
long as he's making good — or at
least fun — movies.
But when he starts putting out
truly bad movies, like his latest,
"Empire of the Sun," it's time for
someone to clip his wings. Small
bad movies are not nearly as
painful to watch as enormously
bloated bad movies.
"Empire of the Sun," based on
a novel by J.G. Ballard, is the im
plausible story of a British boy in
Shanghai in 1941 who is
separated from his parents and
ends up in a Japanese internment
camp. The film spans the war
years and shows what happens to
Jim during that time.
It's supposed to show how he
learns to "tough it," how he
grows from a pampered,
presumptuous child into a strong,
self-sufficient adolescent. Spiel
berg makes this into what seems
to be a fantasy: a boy learning
from life's hard knocks, learning
to survive, seeing history, seeing
death.
It's a suburban boy's dream of
what a gritty, adventuresome
childhood would be like. This
comes through so clearly that it is
almost insulting when Spielberg
tries to make it look truly un
pleasant.
The action begins with Jim as
the annoying, spoiled son of a
wealthy British family. He sings
in a church choir, plays with
model airplanes and insults the
servants. Simply put, this child is
extremely unlikeable, and I was
eagerly anticipating seeing him
taken down a peg or two.
The Japanese attack Pearl Har
bor, and as Jim's family rushes to
the harbor to catch a boat out of
Shanghai, Jim is lost in the crowd.
The music soars, and on the large
screen there's the frantic crowd,
with Jim terrified and screaming
as he is left behind.
It's an absurd, overblown scene
that manipulatively sweeps you

up with its abundant melodrama.
It's hard to resist emotional music
and a screen full of panicking
people. 1, for one, was horrified
and ashamed to find myself on
the brink of tears.
Jim wanders around for a few
days doing various symbolic
things. He goes back to the estate
where he lived with his family. He
meets one of his old servants, who
slaps him in the face and walks
away (which was gratifying, but a
little brutal).
Eventually he meets up with a
couple of renegade American
sailors living in an abandoned
ship. One of them, a charismatic
drop-out named Basie, becomes
his role model and friend. When
they are eventually captured and
taken to the internment camp,
Jim stays close to Basie.
The camp becomes Jim's
school. He learns to survive, to be
tough, unscrupulous and daring.
This is where the incredible moral
incoherence of the movie be
comes most obvious. Spielberg is
trying to say something, but it's
all garbled.
First of all, Jim has a weird fas
cination with the Japanese pilots
flying out of an adjacent air base.
The movie goes out of its way to
stress the honor and beauty of
Japanese rituals such as the
drinking of sake before a plane
takes off. Ok, so we're supposed
to recognize the integrity of the
enemy. Fair enough.
But when Jim salutes some
Japanese pilots and they salute
him back, things start getting a
little too corny. Ok, so the
Japanese pilots are noble men.
This, however, makes for a very
mixed message: It's never clear
why Jim admires the Japanese;
the Japanese guards at the camp
are always using their martial arts
to punish someone.
For instance, the camp's British
doctor is cruelly beaten for trying
to protect his patients. It doesn't
seem quite natural that Jim
should like the Japanese. Is it
only because they're stronger
than he is? Because they have
power?
Jim prefers the manly warlike
Japanese to the softer British men

at the camp who talk about ideas
and education. What is Spielberg
getting at? For the most part, this
is a pretty simple-minded movie,
so the message is probably
benign. It's hard to understand,
though, what that message is.
There are a lot of "meaningful"
scenes here that don't come to
anything. Jim is standing on a hill
singing choir music; the Japanese
commanding officer has tears in
his eyes listening to it, and the
whole camp is silent with awe.
Then suddenly the Americans
are bombing, and Jim races up to
a rooftop and goes bananas, runs
around laughing and shrieking
hysterically because he has waved
to an American pilot. The doctor
tries to bring him down from the

rooftop, and Jim's exhilaration
gives way to a sentimental iden
tity crisis. It is all jumbled up and
pointless. The emotions seem
fake.
The movie is an epic set against
the backdrop of pre-revo
lutionary China, and it uses Asia,
and Asian crowds, to imply mys
tery. This always seems like a
cheap way to evoke emotions.
Show another culture, play
soaring music and you can imply
mystery and exoticism. Some
movies make this ploy work ef
fectively; here it just seems empty
and transparent.
Indeed, most of Spielberg's
ploys are transparent. The me
chanics of this movie are too
visible. Spielberg turns on lofty

choral music at every "sig
nificant" moment. A "signifi
cant" moment is never allowed to
speak for itself. You can feel it
coming when the music starts to
swell, and it's usually dramatized
by a corny symbol or two.
Spielberg never lets a potential
symbol slip quietly away. When
Jim hurls his suitcase into a river,
against a sunset sky, I knew I'd be
seeing that suitcase again, and I
did, downstream, floating sym
bolically in the harbor accompa
nied by Spielberg's favorite
choral music.
What makes this bad movie
truly awful is that the actor
playing Jim, a child named Chris
tian Bale, is a difficult kid to like.
From beginning to end he seems

greedy and a little brutal. It's hard
to empathize with him, even
when the script clearly demands
that we do so. Bale has a cold, un
pleasant look, and his character
isn't one you want to care about.
In a lot of scenes I wanted to see
someone hit him.
The other big role in the movie,
Basie. is played by John
Malkovich, who isn't bad at all.
He's swaggering, cool and
likeable as the morally vague
tough guy whom Jim idolizes.
This movie is grandly bad. The
scenes run for minutes longer
than they ought to. The movie it
self should have been put on a se
vere diet. It's an overweight,
simple-minded failure.

Jim stays close to Basie.
The camp becomes Jim's
school. He learns to survive, to be
tough, unscrupulous and daring.
This is where the incredible moral
incoherence of the movie be
comes most obvious. Spielberg is
trying to say something, but it's
all garbled.
First of all, Jim has a weird fas
cination with the Japanese pilots
flying out of an adjacent air base.
The movie goes out of its way to
stress the honor and beauty of
Japanese rituals such as the
drinking of sake before a plane
takes off. Ok, so we're supposed
to recognize the integrity of the
enemy. Fair enough.
But when Jim salutes some
Japanese pilots and they salute
him back, things start getting a
little too corny. Ok, so the
Japanese pilots are noble men.
This, however, makes for a very
mixed message: It's never clear
why Jim admires the Japanese;
the Japanese guards at the camp
are always using their martial arts
to punish someone.
For instance, the camp's British
doctor is cruelly beaten for trying
to protect his patients. It doesn't
seem quite natural that Jim
should like the Japanese. Is it
only because they're stronger
than he is? Because they have
power?
Jim prefers the manly warlike
Japanese to the softer British men

at the camp who talk about ideas
and education. What is Spielberg
getting at? For the most part, this
is a pretty simple-minded movie,
so the message is probably
benign. It's hard to understand,
though, what that message is.
There are a lot of "meaningful"
scenes here that don't come to
anything. Jim is standing on a hill
singing choir music; the Japanese
commanding officer has tears in
his eyes listening to it, and the
whole camp is silent with awe.
Then suddenly the Americans
are bombing, and Jim races up to
a rooftop and goes bananas, runs
around laughing and shrieking
hysterically because he has waved
to an American pilot. The doctor
tries to bring him down from the

rooftop, and Jim's exhilaration
gives way to a sentimental iden
tity crisis. It is all jumbled up and
pointless. The emotions seem
fake.
The movie is an epic set against
the backdrop of pre-revo
lutionary China, and it uses Asia,
and Asian crowds, to imply mys
tery. This always seems like a
cheap way to evoke emotions.
Show another culture, play
soaring music and you can imply
mystery and exoticism. Some
movies make this ploy work ef
fectively; here it just seems empty
and transparent.
Indeed, most of Spielberg's
ploys are transparent. The me
chanics of this movie are too
visible. Spielberg turns on lofty

choral music at every "sig
nificant" moment. A "signifi
cant" moment is never allowed to
speak for itself. You can feel it
coming when the music starts to
swell, and it's usually dramatized
by a corny symbol or two.
Spielberg never lets a potential
symbol slip quietly away. When
Jim hurls his suitcase into a river,
against a sunset sky, I knew I'd be
seeing that suitcase again, and I
did, downstream, floating sym
bolically in the harbor accompa
nied by Spielberg's favorite
choral music.
What makes this bad movie
truly awful is that the actor
playing Jim, a child named Chris
tian Bale, is a difficult kid to like.
From beginning to end he seems

greedy and a little brutal. It's hard
to empathize with him, even
when the script clearly demands
that we do so. Bale has a cold, un
pleasant look, and his character
isn't one you want to care about.
In a lot of scenes I wanted to see
someone hit him.
The other big role in the movie,
Basie. is played by John
Malkovich, who isn't bad at all.
He's swaggering, cool and
likeable as the morally vague
tough guy whom Jim idolizes.
This movie is grandly bad. The
scenes run for minutes longer
than they ought to. The movie it
self should have been put on a se
vere diet. It's an overweight,
simple-minded failure.


Jim Graham (Christian Bale) goes nuts during an attack of American
P-sls in "Empire of the Sun," Steven Spielberg's epic view of war

through a young boy's eyes. The movie is based on a novel by J.G. Bal
lard.
Steven Spielberg doesn't make
small movies.
He's obviously a director with a
taste for the expensive and the
grandiose, which is forgivable so
long as he's making good — or at
least fun — movies.
But when he starts putting out
truly bad movies, like his latest,
"Empire of the Sun," it's time for
someone to clip his wings. Small
bad movies are not nearly as
painful to watch as enormously
bloated bad movies.
"Empire of the Sun," based on
a novel by J.G. Ballard, is the im
plausible story of a British boy in
Shanghai in 1941 who is
separated from his parents and
ends up in a Japanese internment
camp. The film spans the war
years and shows what happens to
Jim during that time.
It's supposed to show how he
learns to "tough it," how he
grows from a pampered,
presumptuous child into a strong,
self-sufficient adolescent. Spiel
berg makes this into what seems
to be a fantasy: a boy learning
from life's hard knocks, learning
to survive, seeing history, seeing
death.
It's a suburban boy's dream of
what a gritty, adventuresome
childhood would be like. This
comes through so clearly that it is
almost insulting when Spielberg
tries to make it look truly un
pleasant.
The action begins with Jim as
the annoying, spoiled son of a
wealthy British family. He sings
in a church choir, plays with
model airplanes and insults the
servants. Simply put, this child is
extremely unlikeable, and I was
eagerly anticipating seeing him
taken down a peg or two.
The Japanese attack Pearl Har
bor, and as Jim's family rushes to
the harbor to catch a boat out of
Shanghai, Jim is lost in the crowd.
The music soars, and on the large
screen there's the frantic crowd,
with Jim terrified and screaming
as he is left behind.
It's an absurd, overblown scene
that manipulatively sweeps you

up with its abundant melodrama.
It's hard to resist emotional music
and a screen full of panicking
people. 1, for one, was horrified
and ashamed to find myself on
the brink of tears.
Jim wanders around for a few
days doing various symbolic
things. He goes back to the estate
where he lived with his family. He
meets one of his old servants, who
slaps him in the face and walks
away (which was gratifying, but a
little brutal).
Eventually he meets up with a
couple of renegade American
sailors living in an abandoned
ship. One of them, a charismatic
drop-out named Basie, becomes
his role model and friend. When
they are eventually captured and
taken to the internment camp,
Jim stays close to Basie.
The camp becomes Jim's
school. He learns to survive, to be
