## ASU upsets streaking Cardinal cagers Joey Johnson leaps his way into limelight 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. — Please add to
your list of skywalkers a new
name: Joey Johnson.
The 6-foot-4 swing-man from
Wilmington scored 12 points and
grabbed five rebounds last night
to help his Arizona State Sun
Devils to a 104-80 victory over
the visiting Stanford Cardinal;
but nowhere in the statistics can
you find the excitement he
creates. . . .
By jumping. . . .
And then perusing various
layers of the atmosphere before
returning to Earth.
Johnson, who is the younger
brother of Boston Celtics guard
Dennis Johnson, is listed as
having a 50-inch vertical leap.
What isn't listed is that he seems
to have a 50-second hang time.
For example, in the first half of
last night's contest, Johnson
picked up a loose ball about 10
feet from the basket. And then he
jumped.
At first it looked like he was
just going to lay it in. But at some
point on his journey upward
Johnson decided to dunk the ball.
Soon, somehow he gazed down
through the hoop at the mere
mortals below him.
Finally he tomahawked the ball
through the hoop, and with his
mission complete he began his
descent.
Various bewildered and aston
ished vulgarities were uttered by

TEMPE, Ariz. — At first it looked like
the Butler was going to do it, but in the end
a swarming group of frantic and talented
Sun Devils stole the victory.
The homestanding Arizona State Sun
Devils murdered the Stanford Cardinal last
night 104-80, despite a career-high 28
points for Stanford center Greg Butler.
The loss dropped the Cardinal's record
to 10-4 overall, 2-1 in the Pacific 10 con
ference. Arizona State boosted its record
to 9-3, 3-0 in the Pac-10. Stanford plays
Arizona (13-1, 3-0 and 81-50 victors over
California last night) tomorrow at 4:05 p.m
PST.
The Sun Devils more than made up for
Butler's offensive show, however, as seven
Arizona State players scored in double fig
ures.
With the score tied 46-46 at halftime,
the Cardinal was definitely still in the
game, largely due to Butler's 22 points.
But with the Sun Devils leading 65-62 with
14:00 left in the game, Stanford ran out of
gas, and Arizona State began running.
The Sun Devils strung together nine
straight points, and with 9:50 remaining,
the Cardinal looked defeated. "We just
kind of quit competing," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "Arizona State
got jacked, and we got down by a couple
hoops and just tossed it in."
The Sun Devils' frenetic pace resulted in
grand larceny — they gathered 16 steals,
while Stanford committed 27 turnovers.
And Arizona State certainly has the talent
to put the ball in the hole.
Forward Eric Holloway led Arizona
State with 20 points, mostly on baseline
jumpers. Joey Johnson, Arthur Thomas,
Mark Becker, Tarence Wheeler and John
Jerome all had 12 points, while Mark Car
lino had 1 1.
"They've got some hungry kids who
want to play," Montgomery said. "Carlino
ripped us on the board." Indeed, Carlino
came off the bench to snare 10 rebounds,
and the Sun Devils pounded the boards all
night.
"They're really good leapers, and they
had four or five guys really going after the
boards," Butler said. "They were more ag

gressive than us, and we definitely didn't
block out well."
Stanford guard Todd Lichti was laboring
with the flu, and forward Howard Wright
was in foul trouble for most of the game.
He played only 18 minutes. "Lichti was in
bed all day, but he was able to play minutes
(34 in all)," Montgomery said.
In the end the Stanford turnovers and
the ability of Arizona State to convert on
Cardinal miscues decided the game.
"We had the wrong guys taking it in
against the press; we threw the ball away
on breaks, and we kept turning it over time
after time after time," Montgomery said.
"We can't get down and dirty and keep the
game close."
The game was mighty close in the first
half. The two teams exchanged leads fre
quently until the 5-foot-9 Thomas hit a 3-
pointer and a 15-foot jump shot to give the
Sun Devils a 40-33 lead with 4:30 left in
the half.
Butler responded with an eight-point
spurt to tie the game at 46-46 at intermis
sion. "A lot of times I think they key on
Todd (Lichti) and Howard (Wright), and a
lot of the time 1 think they don't think I can
play," Butler said. "They were double
teaming Howard and Todd, and I was get
ting good shots and sinking them."
Butler sank them to the tune of 22 first
half points, eclipsing in 16 minutes of
playing time his previous career-high of 19
points. "After that they started double
teaming me," Butler said.
Arizona State did pretty much every
thing right in the second half. The Sun
Devils pulled down 24 rebounds in the
second stanza and several slam dunks got
the crowd of 6406 going.
In the second half the Sun Devil players
seemed to take turns going on hot streaks,
while the Cardinal spread self-destruction
all around.
Holloway started the second stanza hot
with seven points in three minutes to put
Arizona State ahead 56-51. Then Jerome
took over, hitting a baseline jumper, a lay
in off an offensive rebound and a 3-point
shot to keep Arizona State ahead 65-60.
Guard Mike Redhair and Carlino then
led the 9-0 streak that broke Stanford's
back.

the stunned tans before they went
wild.
While the fans look at this
physical display as a phenome
non, Johnson takes it for granted.
"The jump is just there,"
Johnson said. "The dunk is just
there. I don't usually think about
it."

'I've won many a
crowd.'
— Joey Johnson

Of course it should be men
tioned that Johnson made only
one of his three dunk attempts
last night.
It seems that Johnson has a bit
of trouble piloting his jets. This is
his first year in the Pacific 10
Conference, and he is still getting
adjusted.
Johnson is a transfer from
Southern Idaho Junior College,
where last year he led his team to
the National Junior College
Championship and a 37-1 record.
But at Arizona State he and his
new teammates have been erratic.
"We've been having a little
trouble going with the floor

plan," Johnson said.
On Johnson's two missed
dunks last night, he had a little
trouble controlling the ball. On
one he hit the back of the rim,
and on the other he couldn't con
trol an alley-oop pass, although
he certainly stayed up and
grappled with the ball for quite a
while.
Several other times during the
evening Johnson's waist and head
and shoulders suddenly appeared
above the rest of the players on
the floor. He looked like some
one playing peek-a-boo with the
rest of the world.
Johnson, who is among the na
tion's best in the high jump with a
career best of 7-5 3/4, is quickly
winning over the hearts of the
Tempe crowd.
"The dunk is definitely the best
shot to get the crowd going,"
Johnson said. "I've won many a
crowd."
The old cliche says that speed is
something that can't be taught.
The same could be said for jump
ing ability. But if Johnson can
learn to control his skywalking
endeavors, both Johnson and the
Sun Devils could win more
games, as well as crowds.
One thing, however, is certain.
Johnson will be playing closer to
the altitude of the sun rather than
the depths of the devil.
