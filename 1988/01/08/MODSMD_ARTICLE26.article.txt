The best just keeps getting bet
ter.
The Stanford women's basket
ball team made school history this
fall by earning a spot on both the
Associated Press and Street and
Smith's preseason top 20 polls.
After six weeks of play and on the
eve of Pacific 10 Conference
competition, the Cardinal has
once again reached a milestone
with an impressive 11-0 record,
the best non-conference record in
the league and a No. I 1 ranking
by A P.
Stanford has become the West
Coast team to beat, and Arizona
and Arizona State look to do just
that this weekend when the Car
dinal opens its Pac-10 home
season. The Wildcats invade
Maples Pavilion tonight at 7:30,
with the Sun Devils coming to the
Farm tomorrow night.
Arizona enters Pac-10 play
with a comparitively poor record
of 2-7, outscored by their oppo
nents 580-634 and fresh off a loss
to Old Dominion. The numbers
may be deceiving, however, and
the Cardinal Goliath will not take
this talented David lightly.

"I think cautious is a good
word," sophomore guard Jennifer
Azzi said of her team's approach
to the weekend. "I don't really
know what to expect. Arizona
was really good last year."
The Wildcats have the talent to
he good this year as well. The
squad is anchored by a strong vet
eran, senior center Dana Patter
son. who is averaging 17.4 points
and K. I rebounds per game.
"She's very quick and she
jumps very well," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "They
really look to get the ball to her.
They're often centered around
her, but they have good balance."
"They have sophomore Timi
Brown who is a very good outside
shooter," VanDerveer added.
The Wildcat guard averages 10.9
points per game.
Arizona is also exceptional on
the inside. "They have a good
post person with Patterson, and
Adrienne Stowers is another
good inside person." the Cardinal
coach said. "They rebound well
and they're physical."
"I think it'll be a good game for
us. They mix up their defenses,
and they really go inside well.
They have a nucleus of old
players mixed with some very

good new players."
The Arizona game will have a
diagnostic purpose along with ex
tending Stanford's win streak to a
dozen contests. The Wildcats
were the second team that the
Cardinal played when VanDer
veer assumed the reins two years
ago, and this enables Stanford to
measure its improvements against
a team it has repeatedly faced.
"We will he able to see where
our program has gone in relation
to theirs, so I think it shows us if
we've improved or not," Van-
Derveer said. "It's a really good
barometer team for us."
Arizona State's rookie coach
Maura McHugh is in the same po
sition that VanDerveer was in
when Stanford faced Arizona two
years ago. The Sun Devils have
posted a 4-4 record so far, but
they will be hard-pressed to make
up for the experience that
graduated last June.
"Arizona is a very young, inex
perienced team," VanDerveer
said. "They lost six seniors from
last year's team, which was a good
team."
"Now, Arizona State is just
young with a new coach and a lot
of new players. She really needs
time to get her kind of recruits

in."
Despite the Sun Devils' hand
icap of inexperience the Stanford
squad is hardly looking past ASU.
"We beat them last year, but
everybody is going to be tough,"
Azzi said. "The Pac-10 is tough.
We have to take every game one
game at a time, because every
team we play is a good team."
"I still consider us the under
dogs in the Pac-10," the Decem
ber 14 Pac-10 Player of the Week
continued. "We've never finished
above fourth or fifth, and it's like
all of a sudden here we are. It's
still going to be tough."
"I think we'll do pretty well.
We're playing really well â€” I
hope it continues."
"People have been playing well
and pushing each other well,"
VanDerveer agreed. "Our prac
tices have been really competitive
this week. We've worked hard on
offense and we're definitely
looking better."
Two individuals in particular
have picked up this week and
should be impressive in the Pac
10 openers. Last year's weapon,
senior forward Kami Anderson, is
pulling her game together while
