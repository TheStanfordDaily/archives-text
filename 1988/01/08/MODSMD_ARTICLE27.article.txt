## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
While the majority of Stanford stu
dents were home relaxing during win
ter break, the men's swim team was at
school training like usual.
The squad will find out if the hard
working vacation was worth it today
when it opens Pacific 10 Conference
competition.
Currently 1-1, the second-ranked
Cardinal hosts lOth-ranked Arizona at
noon at deGuerre Pool. After losing its
first home meet in over five years, to
Texas Dec. 5. Stanford is looking not
only to go over .500 for the season but
to return to its championship form.
"It is important for us to bounce
back and start winning again in this
meet," senior tri-captain Matt Nance
said.
Team members said they believe the
team is both mentally and physically
stronger now than dunng its last con
test; some added that an especially
good holiday training period has
turned the Cardinal's spirit around and
gotten the squad ready to defend its
NCAA crown.
"We are definitely in a lot better
shape than against Texas," Nance said.
"We have much more speed now than
in December."
Coaches Skip Kenney and Ted

Knapp also said they believe the exten
sive workouts went really well and that
they will prove to he a major factor in
the squad's upcoming performances.
"I'm really pleased with the team's
attitude," Kenney said. "I hope it
carries over into the meet."
The Wildcats will not he easy prey
for the Cardinal. The squad has a num
ber of returning NCAA scorers, and in
the Dual Meet National Champion
ships in early December, three Arizona
swimmers recorded nation-leading
times in at least one event apiece. Matt
Rankin currently has the fastest times
in the 400-yard individual medley, 200
individual medley and 200 breast
stroke. Scott Johnson is leading the
country in the 100 and 200 backstroke,
and Jeff Utsch is No. I in the 500
freestyle.
Although Arizona does have some
top-ranked competitors, Kenney and
Knapp said they believe the Wildcat
squad does not have much depth and is
weak in the sprint races.
"The Wildcats are a strong team, but
we match up pretty well with them."
Knapp said.
"Our goal is to hope we can match
up with the top swimmers in the
country," Kenney added.
Top Cardinal freestyler John
Witchel is questionable due to illness,
so it will be up to sophomore Lunn

Lestina to challange Utsch. Senior tri
captain Sean Murphy will take on
Johnson in the back events, while
Nance will he the leading challenger to
Rankin in the IM events. Stanford will
also he without leading hutterflier An
thony Mosse, who is in his homeland
New Zealand qualifying for its Olym
pic team.
"The loss of John and Anthony is
going to hurt the team, but we can win
without them." Kcnney said
Knapp said he feels the Cardinal
should prevail in diving events and
both relay races, but we would like the
squad to be able to win solely on the
basis of the individual swimming
events.
Stanford coaches and swimmers
agree that Arizona has traditionally not
been tough in dual-meet competition
as the squad tends to focus solely on
the NC A A finals.
"The Wildcats have good racers, but
we shouldn't have problems beating
them." junior David Schraven said.
In addition to its dual meet against
Arizona, the Cardinal will compete in
the University of California Invita
tional this weekend. All Cardinal
swimmers will race both tomorrow and
Sunday in the annual event against
competitors from such Northern Cali
fornia schools as Cal, UC Davis, Chico
State and Cal State- Hay ward.
