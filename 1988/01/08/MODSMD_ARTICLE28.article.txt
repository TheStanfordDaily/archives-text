# Grapplers fall to Utah St.
## 
### Cordon Stephenson Staff writer 
Heavily favored Utah State lived up to its billing
last night at San Jose State. The Cardinal wrestlers
took the mat there against the powerful Aggies and
were soundly defeated, 35-12.
Utah St. won seven matches, including a forfeit in
the 118-pound class, while Stanford claimed just
three victories.
The match was not without bright spots for the
Cardinal, however. According to Stanford Coach
Chris Horpel, the three wrestlers who did pick up
wins "looked very good."
In the 158-pound class, sophomore Steve
Yarbrough scored a technical fall against Aggie Jim
Peacock, posting a 19-4 victory. "Yarbrough looked
the most impressive," Horpel said. "He's starting to
fill all the gaps in his technique so he can just react
into the correct situations, and the guy he wrestled
couldn't come up for air. He pummeled him."
In the 167-pound class, freshman Steve Buddie
-won a major decision over Craig Lamont, 16-8, and
sophomore 167-pounder Ron Perry defeated Wade
Brown 5-1 for a regular decision. "It was a little bit
v of a question mark because the last time we com
peted was before Dead Week. That's a long time to
be without competition," Horpel said.
"But the team leaders were really self-motivated
to stay in shape and come back prepared to
wrestle," he added. "They (Utah St.) were strong in
the lower weight classes, and we got spanked a bit
there."
The Cardinal will have little time to recover from

last night's thumping. The team leaves this after
noon to make the five-hour trek to Chico, where it
will wrestle in the Doc Petersen Open at Chico State
tomorrow.
Like last year's tournament, the competition will
be open to anyone who wants to wrestle. Stanford
will take most of its 24-member squad on the trip,
and each athlete will be entered in his respective
weight bracket. This gives the grapplers who are not
at the top of their weight categories a chance to ex
perience collegiate competition.
While the majority of the competitors are from
university teams, there are many graduates who also
travel to Chico to relive their mat memories. Doug
Perkins, a former Stanford wrestler who was an as
sistant coach last season, placed second in the 190-
pound division last year.
Dave Schultz, another former Cardinal assistant
coach, who also happens to be a former Olympic
and world champion, entered the tournament two
years ago. Doc Petersen officials waived the entry
fees for the entire Stanford squad because of
Schultz's participation at the meet. He ended up in
the championship in his weight bracket, but had
promised to forfeit that distinction if he had met
Stanford's entry, Dave Lee, in the finals. Lee lost in
a semifinal match.
The tournament will continue all day tomorrow,
with the wrestlers competing in as many as five
matches each. It is a single-elimination tournament,
with the possibility of a wrestler being "carried"
into the consolation bracket if a victorious opponent

continues into the semifinals.
While no returning placewin
ners from last year's team return
for the Cardinal, several wrestlers
stand an excellent chance of
bringing home medals this time
around.
Yarbrough, who is now 7-2-0
after last night's meet, and
Buddie will both be competitive
against Doc Petersen opponents.
Senior Terry Mclntyre, the most
experienced member of the
squad, and senior Eric Harber,
who won two varsity letters
before losing his position to
Buddie earlier this season, may
also perform respectably in the
meet.
The Cardinal will have a few
days of rest before returning to
Chico to compete in a dual meet
Jan. 15. The next home meet will
be Jan. 19 against Cal Poly-San
Louis Obispo.
