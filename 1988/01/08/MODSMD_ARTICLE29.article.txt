# Men's gymnastics opens 1988 season
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
With the exception of the 1985 and 1986
teams, the recent history of the Stanford
men's gymnastics program has been char
acterized by excellent individuals on teams
that for one reason or another just couldn't
get it all together. For example, Stanford's
Steve Hug won three straight NCAA all
around championships in the early 19705,
but none of those Cardinal teams even
qualified for the team competition.
Last year was typical. A team returning
all but one gymnast from a 1986 team that
took third place at the NCAAs was ex
pected to give another good showing at the
1987 championships. As it ended up, three
individuals competed at the national meet,
but the Cardinal as a whole, stricken by a
severe rash of injuries, did not qualify.
Still, the 1987 squad was a good one, main
taining a top-20 ranking for most of the
season.
This season's team includes every mem
ber of last year's squad, plus three new
members, senior Randy Besosa and sopho
more Adam Forman, both of whom red
shirted last year, and freshman Tim Wang.
Thus, the relative bad news of last season is
long gone, and this season's news is ex
pected to be quite good. Stanford is one of
three teams with a very good shot at the
national title.
Men's gymnastics opens its schedule
tonight and tomorrow at the annual Spar
tan Open at San Jose State. Along with the
Cardinal and host San Jose, the meet will
include California and some gymnasts from
Cal State-Fullerton. While the Stanford
gymnasts expect to win and will not turn
down the first-place trophy, they will be
using the meet more as a chance to experi
ment under meet conditions than anything
else.
"This weekend the meet's going to be a
lot of fun, and it's very experimental,"
sophomore Conrad Voorsanger said. "We
can throw a lot of tricks which we wouldn't
throw in very important meets."
Voorsanger said he is confident of the
meet's result, but downplayed its impor
tance. "We will win no matter what." he

said. "If we don't I'll be very surprised."
Voorsanger and Cardinal Head Coach
Sadao Hamada both reported that there
were no significant injuries at all, some
thing they could never have said at any
point during the 1986 season, when the
team was often only able to enter five gym
nasts in an event. A team's score for an
event is determined by averaging the top
five individual scores. If they are able to,
teams enter at least six team members in
each event so that any bad score can be
dropped from the average. This was a
luxury last year's Cardinal was often
unable to employ.
This season is different. "Right now
there are no major injuries at all," Hamada
said. "This year I have a lot more depth; I
have nine guys who can compete.
"I don't think there will be any problem
getting the team qualified for the
NCAAs," Hamada said, "but my focus is
how to win the NCAA. I don't even care if
we get to the championships as the 10th
team. We can definitely make the top three
and go for the title. We have the best team
Stanford's ever had. This is the year."
"But it's not going to be easy," Hamada
added. "UCLA's going to be tough, and
Nebraska's going to be tough â€” and they
(the Cornhuskers) also have homecourt
advantage (at the championships). So it's
not going to be easy, but this is the best
team I've ever had."
The return of Besosa, the nation's No. 1
collegian for much of the 1986 season and
a former member of the U.S. national
team, and Forman, who came to Stanford
last year as the nation's No. 1 freshman
before shoulder injuries forced him to red
shirt, gives the Cardinal two elite gymnasts
it did not have last year.
Last year's leaders, seniors Mike Matzek
and Chuck Gerardo, will comprise, with
Besosa, as impressive a trio as can be found
in the NCAA. Juniors Andy Ropp and
Scott Schaffer are now seasoned veterans,
and with a year under their belts,
Voorsanger and sophomore Charles Loop
will also be significant performers. Wang
received rave reviews from both Hamada
and Voorsanger and is likely to be a full -
fledged competitor immediately.
