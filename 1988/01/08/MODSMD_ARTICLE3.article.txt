# Asbestos forces second move for four Roble frosh
## 
### Scott Renshaw Staff writer 
While the majority of former
Roble residents settled into new
housing yesterday, four unfortun
ate Roble students faced yet an
other move.
Four days after moving out of
Roble Hall — shut down due to
earthquake risk — four freshmen
who had been housed in a study
room beneath Casa Zapata are
being forced to relocate again be
cause of potentially dangerous
asbestos-wrapped pipes in their
room.
According to Manager of Stu
dent Housing Suzanne Tamiesie,
the level of asbestos fibers in the
air of the room is not dangerous,
but the insulation covering pipes
in the room does contain as
bestos.
"The air in the room is, accord
ing to all of our information,
fine," Tamiesie said, "(but) there
is the possibility that some of the
material could be released into
the air if the cover is accidentally
punctured."
Tamiesie said that while the
likelihood of such an accident is
small, "the University would be
unable to check (the pipes) on a
regular basis" to ensure that no
damage had occurred.
She said even this minimal risk
was too much. "We have a strong
commitment to protecting stu

dent safety," she said.
Tamiesie admitted that it was
an unfortunate mistake to have
placed the students where they
would have to move again.
"It was an error when we selec
ted that room for a move in our
haste to place all the students. We
feel terrible."
The four women, who will now
move to Guest Cottage E in
Governor's Corner, expressed
anger and disappointment with
the University's handling of the
Roble situation.
"What I think is significant is
that it says this University has a
lack of responsibility," said
Debbie Wicks, one of the dis
placed freshmen.
"I think of the University as
more of a business now," said her
roommate Karin Gunther.
The women also said it would
be difficult to adjust to an envi
ronment very different from that
in a dormitory.
"The (new) room is beautiful,
aesthetically," Wicks said, "but
especially for your freshman year
you have different priorities."
"You can't walk out in the hall
and talk to a friend at night,"
Wicks added.
Said Gunther, "It's like having
an apartment your freshman
year."
