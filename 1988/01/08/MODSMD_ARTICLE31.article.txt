# Arizona visits women's swimming team
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
The dawn of a new year. Time
for students to return to classes.
Time for people to give up on
their New Year's resolutions.
Time for the Cardinal women's
swimming team to gear up for an
other run at a national title.
Stanford officially begins its
season at deGuerre Pool today as
the Arizona Wildcats visit to open
the Pacific 10 Conference's dual
meet schedule. Technically,
today's meet, scheduled for noon
in conjunction with a men's swim
meet, is not Stanford's first this
year — the Cardinal handily
defeated Pacific in early Decem
ber. This is, however, the first

meet of the traditional January to
April season and is the first meet
against strong competition.
"I'm really excited that the
season's finally here," said junior
Jenna Johnson. "I think it's going
to be a really good one."
The Cardinal will need a good
season to improve upon its
NCAA runner-up status last year,
but it has the talent to do it. In ad
dition to Johnson, a five-time
NCAA titlist and an Olympic
gold-medalist, the Cardinal has
1 3 other All-Americans returning
from 1987.
Senior tri-captain Susan Rapp,
a two-time Olympian and the
holder of three NCAA titles,
agrees with Johnson's optimism.
"I think overall, we'll go faster

than last year. The team looked
great (during workouts over
Christmas break); we're all
psyched for this season," she said.
Rapp, a fifth-year senior, said
she is just glad to swim again.
After a knee injury forced her to
redshirt in 1985, she missed much
of last season with an ankle prob
lem. The ankle hasn't healed
completely, but she has the green
light to swim this year.
"I'm looking forward to com
peting again," Rapp said."lt'll
definitely be a break in the
monotony."
Junior Aimee Berzins was
runner-up in the 100 freestyle last
year at the NCAAs (second to
Johnson) and should be a favorite
in the sprint freestyle events all

year. J
Rapp will lead the squad in the»
breaststroke and individual med-«
ley events, while Senior Stacyi
Shupe, a seven-time All-!
American, heads a strong Cardi-}
nal contingent in the distance}
freestyle races.
In the butterfly, Rapp and
Johnson should be near the top
nationally. In the two backstroke j
events at last year's NC A A cham- ,
pionships, Stanford swimmers J
produced nine top-10 finishes J
(four in the 100, five in the 200).
And all of these swimmers are
back this season.
The Cardinal also has All-
America sophomore Katie Con
nors to lead the divers.
