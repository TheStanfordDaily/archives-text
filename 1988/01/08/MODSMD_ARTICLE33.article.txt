# Despite Roble closing
## All walk-ons get housing 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
Despite the housing crunch
caused by the closing of Roble
Hall, all students who attempted
to walk-on to campus residences
last night received housing assign
ments.
"Walking on" refers to the
process of getting last-minute,
on-campus housing after those
students with guaranteed housing
assignments have moved in.
According to Roger Whitney,
assistant dean of Students and di
rector of Student Housing, about
50 students showed up to select
housing from 67 spots at the win
ter walk-on housing center at
Tresidder Union. He added that
he was "really delighted with the
outcome."
Housing officials had been un
certain whether all walk-ons
would get assignments because
displaced Roble residents had
been given first choice of any
available housing.
Whitney said that the Roble
students were given choice of
housing over other students be
cause of the "special situation"
they were placed in when their
dorm was suddenly closed after
fall quarter.
"Obviously, Roble students
were given first priority for
housing because they were al

ready living in University housing
fall quarter," Whitney said.
Returning overseas students
and other unguaranteed students
did not have a housing contract
and therefore were not consid
ered for housing until the Roble
students had been placed on
campus or chose to move off
campus.
Whitney noted that many over
seas students have come to expect
housing when they return to
campus because in the past there
have usually been enough spaces
to accommodate them. He cau
tioned, however, that students
should never depend on housing
in their unguaranteed year.

Comparing this year to past
years, Whitney said there are
usually about 100 students who
try to walk-on to a similar num
ber of spaces.
He speculated that the large
decrease in walk-on students this
winter arose from the widespread
perception that Roble students
would probably take most
available housing spots. He added
that many returning students may
have decided to find apartments,
rather than bothering to try to
walk-on to campus housing.
Several students returning from
overseas criticized the Housing
Center's decision to give Roble
students priority for housing.
They said they felt sorry for the
Roble students, but disagreed
with Whitney's assessment that
the Roble students were in a
"special situation."
One student, who declined to
be named, said, "We (returning
overseas students) are in the same
position the Roble students are
in; we all expected housing."
Another, who also requested
anonymity, said that "the only
real difference between the Roble
people and us is that they have
someone moving their luggage for
them."
Spaces available to walk-ons
last night included rooms in
Hurlburt, Kairos, Synergy and
Mirrielees.

Zapata this week as part of the relocation of former Roble residents.
