# Ferruolo undaunted by career change
## 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
For Stephen Ferruolo, the big
gest difference between being a
professor and being a law student
is that the latter must lug huge
books around campus and sit still
for 20 hours of classes every
week.
"It's difficult to start doing all
that again," says Ferruolo, who
two years ago was a Stanford as
sistant professor and one of the
top young medieval historians in
the world. Now, a year after being
denied tenure by the History De
partment. he is a First-year stu
dent at Stanford Law School.
What may seem a crushing in
terruption of a promising aca
demic career, or at least a radical
demotion, is, for Ferruolo, simply
no big deal. He is still surrounded
by accomplished colleagues. He is

still contributing to undergradu
ate education as a resident felMw
And, most importantly, he is still
excited by intellectual challenge.
"I wouldn't change a thing if I
could do it all over again, except
perhaps to make this move about
three years earlier," says Fer
ruolo, who is 38. "The amount
I'm learning is incredible. 1 can
not think of a time in my life
when I've learned so much."
Law school, for Ferruolo, is the
answer to a desire to expand
beyond what he says is the limited
world of a professor. As an aca
demic, he says, he was subjected
to intense pressure to publish, to
sacrifice teaching for research and
to give up any semblance of
public life or community involve
ment in favor of undistracted
scholarship.
"There are things every re
sponsible adult ought to do.

Every person should want to have
a public life, to be involves in his
or her community," Ferruolo
says."I don't think that is possi
ble for a scholar anymore. It's a
pretty narrow career path."
Tenure denial did not devastate
Ferruolo, but rather opened his
eyes to a different — and more
fulfilling — life.
"When I ask myself. 'What do 1
want to do with the rest of my
life?' 'Do 1 want to stay in
academics?' the answer 1 come up
with is no," he says.
The transition from professor
to law student, even if ultimately
satisfying, was anything but
smooth, however. Ferruolo, at
the height of his scholarship and
earning high praise from his stu
dents, was first denied tenure in
January 1986 by a vote of the
History Department faculty. Fol
lowing an appeal in which he

claimed to have been unfairly
evaluated according to ambigu
ous guidelines, he was granted a
rehearing.
But last February he was
turned down again by a depart
mental vote. Bitter at his col
leagues' refusal to give him an ad
equate explanation, he appealed
again but ended the grievance
process last spring when he
decided to attend law school.
He is technically on sabbatical
this year by special permission of
the provost, but his appointment
will expire in June.
Failure did not come easily to a
man touted as one of the top
scholars in the world in his field.
Until two years ago, his career
was dotted with success after suc
cess: a magna cum laude degree
from Wesleyan, a Rhodes schol
arship for study at Oxford, a Dan
forth Graduate Fellowship, a

Princeton doctoral thesis that
would be revised into a major
book, an appointment to the
Stanford history faculty in 1979
and Stanford's 1984 Dinkelspiel
Award for Outstanding Service to
Undergraduate Education.
At last content again, Ferruolo
is only occasionally reminded of
the controversy of the past two
years. The most agonizing mo
ments come, he says, when un
dergraduates assume he is still a
history professor.
"The hardest thing — and I'd
say this has happened a half a
dozen times — is when a student
will come over and say. Your
class was the best I ever took,'
and then ask what other classes
I'm teaching or whether I could
be his adviser," he says. "That
really upsets me."
Aside from those moments,
however, turning down Yale,
UCLA and UC-Berkeley law
schools in favor of Stanford was a
good decision, Ferruolo says. He
has remained in a'community
where he has many supporters
and friends, and he has continued
as resident fellow in Potter. All of
that outweighs occasional re
minders of the last two years'
controversy, which he says he has
put behind him.
"It would have been impossible
for me to be around here if I felt
anger or bitterness," he says. "1
thought that what I could build
upon here was much greater than
what the other school could offer.
Here I have a whole network of
friends and supporters."
Maintaining some ties to un
dergraduate education has put a
strain on the amount of time Fer
ruolo has been able to devote to a
grueling first semester in law
school, but he says the benefits
overcome the drawbacks. Being a
student makes him a better
teacher, and being a teacher
makes him a better student, he
says.
Ferruolo says that in the dorm,
he has never been so close to stu
dents. "It's been wonderful
sharing the whole thing of being a
student again," he says. "We
share horror stories about how
late we're going to be up finishing

some paper. A lot of students feel
they can talk more freely and
share now that they think of me
as a fellow student."
This quarter, Ferruolo is offer
ing a class to Potter students in
which students read accounts of
growing up in different cultures
and discuss their own back
grounds.
In law classes, his experience as
a professor has paid off. Says Law
Prof. Janet Cooper, Ferruolo's
professor of civil procedure,
"There's no question that he
brings a great many valuable
things to the study of law because

'There are things every
responsible adult ought
to do. Every person
should want to have a
public life, to be in
volved in his or her
community. I don't
think that is possible
for a scholar any more. 1
— Stephen Ferruolo

of the intellectual experience he
has had as a scholar."
Both Ferruolo and Cooper say
that his background does not
make for an awkward relation
ship between them. "I was
worried about that," says Fer
ruolo, "but not anymore. The sit
uation is very informal, not as
hierarchical and rigid as outside
the law school."
Nor, Ferruolo says, does his
background appear to intimidate
his classmates, many of whom
have advanced degrees them
selves. "I don't feel as if there is
any barrier between us," he says.

"Most of the time, I feel as
though we're in it together. I say
dumb things; 1 may be called on
and not know the answer just like
everybody else."
Ferruolo says he will probably
seek a job in international law or
labor law when he graduates in
1990. But he does not dismiss the
possibility of returning to aca
demics if the perfect offer comes
along.
Such an offer would have to
come from a school with top re
search facilities, the opportunity
to teach both graduates and un
dergraduates and a flexible leave
policy. "Most importantly," he
says,"I would not accept a job
that was not tenured from day
one."
Whatever his future holds, Fer
ruolo says that over the next three
years he would like to write an
occasional article or give an occa
sional lecture on medieval his
tory. He also hopes to complete
two books that he has been
writing since before he lost the
tenure votes.
But if law holds his interest as it
has so far, Ferruolo says he will
embark on a new career — new in
every way except the degree to
which it requires thought.
"When you start thinking
about what lawyers are doing, it's
a wonderful intellectual exer
cise," he says. "After the frustra
tions of academics, I think it will
be very satisfying."

demics if the perfect offer comes
along.
Such an offer would have to
come from a school with top re
search facilities, the opportunity
to teach both graduates and un
dergraduates and a flexible leave
policy. "Most importantly," he
says,"I would not accept a job
that was not tenured from day
one."
Whatever his future holds, Fer
ruolo says that over the next three
years he would like to write an
occasional article or give an occa
sional lecture on medieval his
tory. He also hopes to complete
two books that he has been
writing since before he lost the
tenure votes.
But if law holds his interest as it
has so far, Ferruolo says he will
embark on a new career — new in
every way except the degree to
which it requires thought.
"When you start thinking
about what lawyers are doing, it's
a wonderful intellectual exer
cise," he says. "After the frustra
tions of academics, I think it will
be very satisfying."

For Stephen Ferruolo, the big
gest difference between being a
professor and being a law student
is that the latter must lug huge
books around campus and sit still
for 20 hours of classes every
week.
"It's difficult to start doing all
that again," says Ferruolo, who
two years ago was a Stanford as
sistant professor and one of the
top young medieval historians in
the world. Now, a year after being
denied tenure by the History De
partment. he is a First-year stu
dent at Stanford Law School.
What may seem a crushing in
terruption of a promising aca
demic career, or at least a radical
demotion, is, for Ferruolo, simply
no big deal. He is still surrounded
by accomplished colleagues. He is

still contributing to undergradu
ate education as a resident felMw
And, most importantly, he is still
excited by intellectual challenge.
"I wouldn't change a thing if I
could do it all over again, except
perhaps to make this move about
three years earlier," says Fer
ruolo, who is 38. "The amount
I'm learning is incredible. 1 can
not think of a time in my life
when I've learned so much."
Law school, for Ferruolo, is the
answer to a desire to expand
beyond what he says is the limited
world of a professor. As an aca
demic, he says, he was subjected
to intense pressure to publish, to
sacrifice teaching for research and
to give up any semblance of
public life or community involve
ment in favor of undistracted
scholarship.
"There are things every re
sponsible adult ought to do.

Every person should want to have
a public life, to be involves in his
or her community," Ferruolo
says."I don't think that is possi
ble for a scholar anymore. It's a
pretty narrow career path."
Tenure denial did not devastate
Ferruolo, but rather opened his
eyes to a different — and more
fulfilling — life.
"When I ask myself. 'What do 1
want to do with the rest of my
life?' 'Do 1 want to stay in
academics?' the answer 1 come up
with is no," he says.
The transition from professor
to law student, even if ultimately
satisfying, was anything but
smooth, however. Ferruolo, at
the height of his scholarship and
earning high praise from his stu
dents, was first denied tenure in
January 1986 by a vote of the
History Department faculty. Fol
lowing an appeal in which he

claimed to have been unfairly
evaluated according to ambigu
ous guidelines, he was granted a
rehearing.
But last February he was
turned down again by a depart
mental vote. Bitter at his col
leagues' refusal to give him an ad
equate explanation, he appealed
again but ended the grievance
process last spring when he
decided to attend law school.
He is technically on sabbatical
this year by special permission of
the provost, but his appointment
will expire in June.
Failure did not come easily to a
man touted as one of the top
scholars in the world in his field.
Until two years ago, his career
was dotted with success after suc
cess: a magna cum laude degree
from Wesleyan, a Rhodes schol
arship for study at Oxford, a Dan
forth Graduate Fellowship, a

Princeton doctoral thesis that
would be revised into a major
book, an appointment to the
Stanford history faculty in 1979
and Stanford's 1984 Dinkelspiel
Award for Outstanding Service to
Undergraduate Education.
At last content again, Ferruolo
is only occasionally reminded of
the controversy of the past two
years. The most agonizing mo
ments come, he says, when un
dergraduates assume he is still a
history professor.
"The hardest thing — and I'd
say this has happened a half a
dozen times — is when a student
will come over and say. Your
class was the best I ever took,'
and then ask what other classes
I'm teaching or whether I could
be his adviser," he says. "That
really upsets me."
Aside from those moments,
however, turning down Yale,
UCLA and UC-Berkeley law
schools in favor of Stanford was a
good decision, Ferruolo says. He
has remained in a'community
where he has many supporters
and friends, and he has continued
as resident fellow in Potter. All of
that outweighs occasional re
minders of the last two years'
controversy, which he says he has
put behind him.
"It would have been impossible
for me to be around here if I felt
anger or bitterness," he says. "1
thought that what I could build
upon here was much greater than
what the other school could offer.
Here I have a whole network of
friends and supporters."
Maintaining some ties to un
dergraduate education has put a
strain on the amount of time Fer
ruolo has been able to devote to a
grueling first semester in law
school, but he says the benefits
overcome the drawbacks. Being a
student makes him a better
teacher, and being a teacher
makes him a better student, he
says.
Ferruolo says that in the dorm,
he has never been so close to stu
dents. "It's been wonderful
sharing the whole thing of being a
student again," he says. "We
share horror stories about how
late we're going to be up finishing

some paper. A lot of students feel
they can talk more freely and
share now that they think of me
as a fellow student."
This quarter, Ferruolo is offer
ing a class to Potter students in
which students read accounts of
growing up in different cultures
and discuss their own back
grounds.
In law classes, his experience as
a professor has paid off. Says Law
Prof. Janet Cooper, Ferruolo's
professor of civil procedure,
"There's no question that he
brings a great many valuable
things to the study of law because

'There are things every
responsible adult ought
to do. Every person
should want to have a
public life, to be in
volved in his or her
community. I don't
think that is possible
for a scholar any more. 1
— Stephen Ferruolo

of the intellectual experience he
has had as a scholar."
Both Ferruolo and Cooper say
that his background does not
make for an awkward relation
ship between them. "I was
worried about that," says Fer
ruolo, "but not anymore. The sit
uation is very informal, not as
hierarchical and rigid as outside
the law school."
Nor, Ferruolo says, does his
background appear to intimidate
his classmates, many of whom
have advanced degrees them
selves. "I don't feel as if there is
any barrier between us," he says.

"Most of the time, I feel as
though we're in it together. I say
dumb things; 1 may be called on
and not know the answer just like
everybody else."
Ferruolo says he will probably
seek a job in international law or
labor law when he graduates in
1990. But he does not dismiss the
possibility of returning to aca
demics if the perfect offer comes
along.
Such an offer would have to
come from a school with top re

for a scholar any more. 1

of the intellectual experience he
has had as a scholar."
Both Ferruolo and Cooper say
that his background does not
make for an awkward relation
ship between them. "I was
worried about that," says Fer
ruolo, "but not anymore. The sit
uation is very informal, not as
hierarchical and rigid as outside
the law school."
Nor, Ferruolo says, does his
background appear to intimidate
his classmates, many of whom
have advanced degrees them
selves. "I don't feel as if there is
any barrier between us," he says.

"Most of the time, I feel as
though we're in it together. I say
dumb things; 1 may be called on
and not know the answer just like
everybody else."
Ferruolo says he will probably
seek a job in international law or
labor law when he graduates in
1990. But he does not dismiss the
possibility of returning to aca
demics if the perfect offer comes
along.
Such an offer would have to
come from a school with top re
search facilities, the opportunity
to teach both graduates and un
dergraduates and a flexible leave
policy. "Most importantly," he
says,"I would not accept a job
that was not tenured from day
one."
Whatever his future holds, Fer
ruolo says that over the next three
years he would like to write an
occasional article or give an occa
sional lecture on medieval his
tory. He also hopes to complete
two books that he has been
writing since before he lost the
tenure votes.
But if law holds his interest as it
has so far, Ferruolo says he will
embark on a new career — new in
every way except the degree to
which it requires thought.
"When you start thinking
about what lawyers are doing, it's
a wonderful intellectual exer
cise," he says. "After the frustra
tions of academics, I think it will
be very satisfying."
