# Ferruolo undaunted by career change
## 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
For Stephen Ferruolo, the big
gest difference between being a
professor and being a law student
is that the latter must lug huge
books around campus and sit still
for 20 hours of classes every
week.
"It's difficult to start doing all
that again," says Ferruolo, who
two years ago was a Stanford as
sistant professor and one of the
top young medieval historians in
the world. Now, a year after being
denied tenure by the History De
partment. he is a First-year stu
dent at Stanford Law School.
What may seem a crushing in
terruption of a promising aca
demic career, or at least a radical
demotion, is, for Ferruolo, simply
no big deal. He is still surrounded
by accomplished colleagues. He is

still contributing to undergradu
ate education as a resident felMw
And, most importantly, he is still
excited by intellectual challenge.
"I wouldn't change a thing if I
could do it all over again, except
perhaps to make this move about
three years earlier," says Fer
ruolo, who is 38. "The amount
I'm learning is incredible. 1 can
not think of a time in my life
when I've learned so much."
Law school, for Ferruolo, is the
answer to a desire to expand
beyond what he says is the limited
world of a professor. As an aca
demic, he says, he was subjected
to intense pressure to publish, to
sacrifice teaching for research and
to give up any semblance of
public life or community involve
ment in favor of undistracted
scholarship.
"There are things every re
sponsible adult ought to do.

Every person should want to have
a public life, to be involves in his
or her community," Ferruolo
says."I don't think that is possi
ble for a scholar anymore. It's a
pretty narrow career path."
Tenure denial did not devastate
Ferruolo, but rather opened his
eyes to a different — and more
fulfilling — life.
"When I ask myself. 'What do 1
want to do with the rest of my
life?' 'Do 1 want to stay in
academics?' the answer 1 come up
with is no," he says.
The transition from professor
to law student, even if ultimately
satisfying, was anything but
smooth, however. Ferruolo, at
the height of his scholarship and
earning high praise from his stu
dents, was first denied tenure in
January 1986 by a vote of the
History Department faculty. Fol
lowing an appeal in which he

claimed to have been unfairly
evaluated according to ambigu
ous guidelines, he was granted a
rehearing.
But last February he was
turned down again by a depart
mental vote. Bitter at his col
leagues' refusal to give him an ad
equate explanation, he appealed
again but ended the grievance
process last spring when he
decided to attend law school.
He is technically on sabbatical
this year by special permission of
the provost, but his appointment
will expire in June.
Failure did not come easily to a
man touted as one of the top
scholars in the world in his field.
Until two years ago, his career
was dotted with success after suc
cess: a magna cum laude degree
from Wesleyan, a Rhodes schol
arship for study at Oxford, a Dan
forth Graduate Fellowship, a

Princeton doctoral thesis that
would be revised into a major
book, an appointment to the
Stanford history faculty in 1979
and Stanford's 1984 Dinkelspiel
Award for Outstanding Service to
Undergraduate Education.
At last content again, Ferruolo
is only occasionally reminded of
the controversy of the past two
years. The most agonizing mo
ments come, he says, when un
dergraduates assume he is still a
history professor.
"The hardest thing — and I'd
say this has happened a half a
dozen times — is when a student
will come over and say. Your
class was the best I ever took,'
and then ask what other classes
I'm teaching or whether I could
be his adviser," he says. "That
really upsets me."
