# Faculty Senate meeting
## Near West planning underway 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
Plans for the Near West Campus De
velopment Project are now entering a
critical stage, according to Ray Bac
chetti, vice provost and director of
Planning and Management.
The project, estimated to cost $250
million, will cover 46 acres just west of
the Quad and will house the Univer
sity's engineering and science depart
ments. It is expected to take 10 to 15
years to complete.
"Top decisions need to be made
early so other sets of decisions can be
made," Bacchetti said at a Faculty Sen
ate meeting yesterday.
"A number of decisions concerning
textures, shapes and aesthetic quality
need to be made," he said, calling this
initial stage of development the Con
nective Elements Project. CEP in
cludes "everything in the 46 acres that
is not a building," he explained.
Architects working on the Near
West project arc currently laying out
plans for streets, parking structures and
other exterior structures. Plans call for
the demolition of the Physics Tank,

which stands at a "critical connection"
between the east and west halves of
campus.
"We want to make |Near West) feel
integrated with the rest of the Univer
sity and not a separate part," he said.
University President Donald Ken
nedy added that although "physical
segregation" already exists between
the sciences and humanities, the "gulf
is much larger now than it will be" after
the project is completed.
Kennedy also commended those
who helped move students out of
Roble Hall this week, saying the move
was "a remarkable tribute to a large
number of people who spent part of
their Christmas break in part of a very
challenging enterprise."
Kennedy defended the University's
seismic investigation that led to the
dorm's shutdown, saying the situation
"would have been hard to recognize
much earlier" than last quarter.
"I do not think one or one-and-a
half month's acceleration would have
made much difference. It looks like the
situation is at hand at this time," he
said. Kennedy noted that the Univer
sity is waiting for completion of further

studies of Ruble before deciding
whether to reinforce or entirely rebuild
the 70-year-old dorm.
In other business, Provost James
Rosse announced the initiation of a
program designed to bring black South
Africans to Stanford for two to three
quarters of study "in disciplinary areas
pertinent to their careers "
The program was developed by both
the Committee on Educational In
itiatives for Black Southern Africans
and Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody and is similar to programs at
USC, Cornell and Columbia. South
African participants will be selected
through the Educational Opportunity
Council in South Africa, which is
headed by South African Bishop Des
mond Tutu.
"This mid-career program is part of
a comprehensive program of South
African educational intiatives the Uni
versity has developed over the summer
and fall," Rosse said.
The Senate also unanimously ap
proved a recommendation by the Com
nnttee on Graduate Studies to author
ize the masters program in Russian and
East European Studies.
