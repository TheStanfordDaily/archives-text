U.S. urges Panama head to resign
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration sent a high
ranking Pentagon official on a secret mission to Panama last
week to press its strongman. Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, to
step down and allow free elections in the country, State Depart
ment and congressional sources said yesterday.
The official, Richard Armitage, assistant secretary of defense
for international security affairs, held what one U.S. official
called "a lengthy session" with Noriega early last week to urge
him to withdraw from politics.
Armitage was picked to deliver the administration's strongest
direct message to date to Noriega because the Panamanian
strongman is a "military man" and Washington wanted "the
most effective interlocutor possible," the official said.
Access by U.S. officials to Noriega, who has resisted mounting
U.S. pressure to resign, "has not been extensive" recently and
the administration wanted to hold a "face-to-face meeting" to
make sure he "knows this is our policy," the source said. No
details were available yesterday on what Armitage reported
Noriega's response to have been.
One source compared the Armitage mission to that of then-
Sen. Paul Laxalt, whom President Reagan sent as his personal
envoy to the Philippines in October 1985 to urge President Fer
dinand Marcos to hold a free and fair election. The voting, held
in February 1986, resulted in Marcos' defeat by Corazon
Aquino.
Budget deficit may exceed old limit
WASHINGTON — The budget deficit in fiscal 1989 will rise
to $ 167 billion — $31 billion over the legal target — if the eco
nomy performs as private forecasters are predicting, according to
White House budget documents.
That would mean that in order to shrink the deficit to $ 136 bil
lion in accordance with the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget
law, there would have to be more stringent measures than
enacted in the budget compromise the president and Congress
reached in December.
The documents obtained yesterday contain the highlights of
President Reagan's budget being prepared for submission to
Congress in mid-February. The draft budget envisions federal
spending in fiscal 1989 of $ 1.104 trillion and a deficit of $ 1 36 bil
lion, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings target for that year.
The draft's official projections, based on the administration's
economic forecast, show a deficit narrowing from the $148 bil
lion level recorded in fiscal 1987, which ended Sept. 30. The def
icit will be $ 146 billion in the current fiscal year, according to the
White House projections.
Bush counters new allegations
JOHNSTON, Iowa — Vice President George Bush mounted
an aggressive effort yesterday to counter allegations of broad in
volvement in the Iran-contra affair, forcefully contending that he
never realized the plan involved selling arms in return for
hostages until it was too late.
In an impromptu, 20-minute outdoor press conference con
ducted in biting 12-degree cold, Bush sought to refute a Wash
ington Post story detailing his attendance at dozens of meetings
at which the shadowy plan was discussed. But he offered few new
details, said that he could not recall events testified to by other
participants and refused to discuss what he told President Reagan
in their private talks.
Bush knew of efforts to gain the release of American hostages
in Lebanon, he said, and also of administration efforts to reach
out to groups inside Iran. What he he did not know, he said, was
that they were one and the same.
"It's only when it became clear that it was arms for hostages —
the benefit of the hindsight and all that — that I (did) say, 'Yeah,
that was wrong,' " he said.
Bush also placed greater emphasis on a humanitarian rationale
for the existence of the plan, saying that his and Reagan's in
volvement stemmed from their concern for the hostages.
Shultz reaffirms support of Israel
W AS HINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz said yes
terday that U.S. support for Israel is "unshakable" despite a
month of sometimes acrimonious Washington-Jerusalem friction
over the use of live ammunition against Palestinian demonstra
tors and Israel's plan to deport Arab activists.
"I think it's important for everyone to understand that the
United States regards its friendship . . . with Israel as a key and
unshakable relationship," Shultz said.
"No one should misinterpret a vote as meaning anything else,"
he added, in reference to the U.S. support for a U.N. Security
Council resolution condemning Israeli plans to expel nine Pales
tinians accused of leading the riots, which have swept through the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip since Dec. 9. The
vote earlier this week was decried by Israel and hailed by the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
Nevertheless, Shultz repeated the U.S. assertion that Israeli
forces can maintain law and order in the predominately Arab oc
cupied territories "without the use of lethal means." At least 23
Palestinian demonstrators and bystanders have been killed by Is
raeli gunfire in the last month.
When a reporter asked at a press conference if the United
States would give unqualified backing to the Israelis, "whatever
they might do," Shultz replied: "Israel is a democratic country
seeking stability and peace and the ability to pursue its destiny.
And we support that country. And we support those objectives."
Philippine cardinal calls for calm
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine Cardinal Jaime Sin, the
most powerful religious leader in this Roman Catholic nation,
appealed yesterday for an end to political violence, as a spate of
bombings, assassinations, kidnappings and sniper killings
brought to 62 the number of dead since campaigning began for
crucial local elections this month.
"Politics should not be divorced from Christian moral prin
ciples," Sin declared in a pastoral letter, which was released at
the same time police were reporting that a candidate's home in
Manila had been bombed and a mayoral candidate in a town
north of the capital had been slain by a sniper in broad daylight
while making a campaign speech.
In all, police nationwide reported seven new election-related
deaths yesterday, and officials of President Corazon Aquino's
government said they expect many more killings before Jan. 18,
when voters will cast ballots for more than 16,000 mayors, city
councilmen and governors.
Mrs. Aquino has called the elections the last major step toward
restoring democracy in the Philippines following the ouster of
former President Ferdinand Marcos in February 1986. Yet the
violence already has forced officials to postpone balloting in at
least six of the country's 73 provinces.
