# Gaza violence claims fatality

### 
JERUSALEM — One Pales
tinian was reported killed and at
least seven wounded in new
clashes with Israeli troops in the
Gaza Strip late yesterday as the
unprecedented unrest that has
rocked the occupied territories
continued with no sign of a let-up.
On the West Bank, visiting
Sen. John Chafee (R-R.1.) was
forced to abandon a scheduled
tour of the Kalandia refugee
camp near Jerusalem when his
party was stoned by Palestinian
protesters and Israeli troops dis
persed the young attackers with
tear gas. There were scattered
clashes in several other areas, in
cluding the main shopping street
in Arab East Jerusalem.
The army, still trying un
successfully to bring the situation
under control, said that at least 10
Palestinian activists from among
the more than 2000 arrested since
the trouble began on Dec. 9 have
been ordered detained for up to
six months without trial. The gov
ernment earlier announced plans

to deport nine other activists.
And Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, who has dismissed inter
national criticism of Israel's use of
lethal force and other methods of
containing the violence, said that
he would refuse to meet United
Nations Undersecretary-General
Marrak Goulding, who left New
York on his way to Israel to in
vestigate the unrest.
Israel Radio reported that the
country's ambassador to the
United Nations, Binyamin
Natanyahu, cabled Foreign Min
ister Shimon Peres urging him to
boycott Goulding's visit as well.
The Israeli army command re
ported that "over 1000 people"
attacked an army patrol at the
Nusseirat refugee camp in the
Gaza Strip last night. A military
spokesman said that the unit
commander first ordered the
demonstrators to disperse, then
ordered his men to fire tear gas
and rubber bullets. When that
failed to work, the spokesman
said, troops opened fire with

small-caliber weapons, wounding
seven.
The army spokesman said he
knew of no fatalities in the inci
dent, but U.N. and hospital
sources in Gaza confirmed Pales
tinian reports late yesterday that
a youth from the Moghazi refugee
camp near Nusseirat was dead on
arrival at a Moghazi clinic
operated by the United Nations.
It was not immediately clear if he
was shot during the incident at
Nusseirat or in a separate clash at
Moghazi.
U.N. and Palestinian sources
identified the dead youth as Zaki
Mosalem, 15.
Sources at Gaza City's Ahli
Hospital said eight injured Pales
tinians were brought there after
clashes at both Nusseirat and
Moghazi, and that two seriously
wounded patients were trans
ferred to an Israeli hospital in
Ashkelon.
Mosalem is the 25th Palestin
ian to die from army gunfire in
the last month, and the 16th from

the Gaza Strip. About 200 more
West Bank and Gaza Strip resi
dents have suffered gunshot
wounds during what is generally
accepted as the most widespread
violence in the territories since Is
raeli troops captured them in the
1967 Six-Day War.
Another Gaza Strip youth was
shot to death during a demonstra
tion in Khan Younis Tuesday,
and Israeli sources expressed con
cern that the latest deaths could
trigger more violence after Mos
lem prayers today.
The Gaza Strip is known here
as a hotbed of Moslem fun
damentalism, and the Israeli
sources described the mood in the
territory as extraordinarily tense.
During the Nusseirat clashes, the
sources said, voices could be
heard yelling over loudspeakers
for a "holy war against the Jews."
A U.S. consulate official who
accompanied Chafee yesterday
said the senator was never in dan
ger.
