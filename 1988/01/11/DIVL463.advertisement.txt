* Not for everyone of course. Philosophy is practical for those whose criteria of '
success goes beyond maximization of earnings the first year out of college, and who
consider life-long earnings in the context of satisfaction of desires and plans that
survive reflective analysis, and who satisfy ONE or more of the following criteria: 1)
ever spending more than a minute wondering whether their teacher and all of their
classmates were merely automations; 2) liking puns; 3) enjoying one or more of the
following in Western Culture: Plato, Descartes, Hume, Nietzsche, Marx, Raw Is; 4)
reading all of the Aristotle assignment in Western Culture, and thinking it was neat.
