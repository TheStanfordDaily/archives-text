# Relocation causes classroom crunch

### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
The relocation of former Roble
residents into various dorm-based
seminar rooms around campus
will exacerbate Stanford's present
classroom shortage, according to
several social science professors.
Stanford's acute shortage of
both seminar classrooms and
lecture halls was severely wor
sened when numerous seminar
rooms in campus residences were
converted into bedrooms to ac
comodate students displaced by
the sudden closure of the Univer
sity's largest dorm. Roble was
closed at the end of fall quarter
because officials determined that
it could not safely withstand a
major earthquake.
"In the past I was able to rely
on R As in certain dorms that had
taken Political Science 1 to get
section rooms for me," Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
said. "It was often that two or
three dorms really saved the day
for me."
Marshall attributes the present
seminar room shortage to bad
prioritizing by the University.
"This University has its
priorities all screwed up," he said.
"The trustees will allocate
hundreds of millions of dollars for
research but won't provide the
simple necessities for teaching. If
you ask for $ 100 million for DN A
research you'll probably get it,
but if you want two seminar
rooms — some chalk, a table, and
some chairs — they won't give it
to you."
A frustrated Marshall went so
far as to say Stanford has fewer
"facilities than Socrates in ancient
Greece. There has been no prog
ress."
Patricia Bylund, the classroom
coordinator for the Registrar's
Office, was unavailable for com
ment last night.
Political Science Prof. David
Holloway said a number of his
Political Science 35 students were
forced to hold section outdoors
because of problems finding
rooms for all of the class' 29 sec
tions.
Marshall said the University
really isn't doing everything pos
sible to alleviate the room
shortage.
He said that a number of de
partment heads "pleaded with
[the trustees] to put up temporary
buildings that could hold three or

four section rooms apiece, but the
trustees were opposed to clutter
ing up the campus."
"Researchers, including certain
peace studies experts, have them
and can get them, though," Mar
shall said.
Marshall also pointed out that
when the building shared by the
sociology and communication de
partments was rebuilt a couple of
years ago "they built the whole
damn place with no lecture hall or
seminar rooms."
Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo said that a percentage of
the money raised by Centennial
fundraising efforts is "supposed
to go to the construction of new
