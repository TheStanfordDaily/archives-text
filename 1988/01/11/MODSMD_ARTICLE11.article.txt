# California Agricultural Board:
## Bird control efforts are legal 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
Tresidder Union's use of the chemical Avitrol in
its battle against resident bird populations does not
violate state law, a spokesman for the California
Agriculture Board said Friday.
The chemical, used to taint grain set out for the
birds by a pest-control company last month,
resulted in the death of more than 30 birds.
The legality of Avitrol use was questioned by an
employee from the California Fish and Game De
partment who indicated its fatal effects on the birds
might be a violation of the California Administra
tive Code.
A section of that code pertaining to fish and game
prohibits the use of poisons on any bird species.
The agriculture official, who asked not to be iden
tified, said Avitrol is officially registered with the

state as a "flock alarming agent." He said it is so
classified as an alarming agent and not a poison be
cause it is not fatal in most cases.
When eaten, the tainted grain dazes birds, which
then emit a signal to frighten other birds from the
area surrounding the contaminated food.
I he official said that birds that died from Avitrol
consumption may have been in poor health.
"The extent of the harm to the birds really
depends on the flock," he said. "Healthy birds are
OK."
Tresidder's eateries, plagued by health depart
ment citations and numerous patron complaints
about birds, hired the pest-control company in a
last-ditch effort to reduce the number of birds in in
door and outdoor dining areas. Previous efforts to
scare off the birds included window decals and sonar
devices, according to Paul Szczesiul, assistant direc
tor of Tresidder.
