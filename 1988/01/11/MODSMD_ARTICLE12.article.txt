# Med Center issues guidelines on dealing with terminally ill
##

The Stanford Medical Center's Committee on
Ethics has published a unique article in the Jan. 8
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine
that provides guidelines for health care profes
sionals in dealing with terminally ill patients.
Dr. Thomas Raffin, chairman of the commit
tee, said the report stresses the patient's right to
decide his or her own fate. The report "delineates
practical principles" for effective communication
between doctors and patients, and recommends
that all adults state their desires for treatment in
case they become terminally ill.
Mike Goodkind, a Medical Center spokesman,
said the paper was prompted by a dilemma doc
tors often face — should they agressively treat
patients who have no hope for a reasonable
quality of life, or should they avoid using ex
traordinary means to keep such patients alive? In
most such cases, administration of extraordinary
care only extends the suffering of the patient, he
said.
The report notes that treatment of terminal
patients may not be a fair use of valuable medical
resources. For example, Raffin asks whether it is
"appropriate to spend $4000 a day to keep an
84-year-old unconscious terminal cancer patient
alive through aggressive support ... (when)
money is coming from limited insurance or gov
ernment funding that might be needed urgently
elsewhere."
Improved technology, such as respirators, al
lows doctors to keep people breathing for ex
tended periods even when there is no hope for
recovery, Goodkind said. According to Raffin,
before this report was released there was no
concise, accessible set of standards for physicians
to follow that addressed the ethical problems
created by such life-extending technology.
Legally, all patients have a right to decide what
kind of treatment they want to undergo, Raffin
said. The doctor's role is to suggest realistic op
tions he or she might follow. According to Good
kind. the report recommends looking to other

"sources of advice," including social workers,
nurses, health professionals, family and — when
necessary — attorneys.
Another issue the report addresses is what to
do when the terminally ill patient is physically
unable to express his or her wishes. There is no
clear precedent from past court cases pertaining
to this matter, Raffin said. In this case,
"identified surrogates," such as the patient's fam
ily, should be consulted to find out "what the pa
tient would have wanted," he said.

. . . should [doctors] agressively
treat patients who have no hope
for a reasonable quality of life, or
should they avoid using extraordi
nary means to keep such patients
alive?

Raffin recommended that "all adults (should)
fill out a living will that identifies what sould be
done if they are terminally ill and legally incom
petent." Such a will should state whether the in
dividual wishes to be kept alive by technology in
that situation, and should appoint "someone as a
decision maker for that person." Such wills are
available in 39 states, including California, he
said.
Raffin emphasized that doctors still have a
responsiblity to prevent patients from committing
suicide. The report, however, addresses instances
when patients have little hope for a "reasonable
quality of life." Therefore, such cases are not
considered in the suicide category, he said.
Raffin stated, however, that even in the case of
the 84-year-old terminal cancer patient, the pa
tient's desires should be given first priority.
Both Goodkind and Raffin predicted that the
recommendations outlined in the report would be
put to use throughout the country.
