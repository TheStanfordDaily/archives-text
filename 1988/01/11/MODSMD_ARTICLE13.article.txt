We will never know how much human suffer
ing resulted from the six-month delay in con
struction of Stanford's new animal research facil
ity. But we do know the cause of that delay: A
disgusting and admittedly political manipulation
of California's environmental laws by so-called
"animal rights" groups. These groups should be
ashamed of employing antics that cost so many
dollars, so much time and, possibly, so many
lives.
The construction of a new and much-needed
animal facility — approved by the county plan
ning commission in May — bogged down in July
after animal-rights organizations convinced the
Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors to re
quest an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for
the project. It cost Stanford over $500,000 and
took six months to produce the report, which
concluded that the proposed facility poses no
threat to the environment.
The outcome of this report surprised no one.
Not Stanford, not the county, not even the
animal-rights groups that had lobbied for it. But
if the environmental impact of the facilty was
never in question, why was it requested? The an
swer is politics.
"The EIR ... was triggered by our concern
with the animals," said animal rights activist Lise
Giraud. In other words, the expensive EIR had
only the most tenuous connection with concern
for the environment. In actuality, it sprang from
the political goal of the animal rights groups:
namely blocking construction of the new facility.
To any reasonable person, this construction is
imperative. To delay or block it poses a danger
ous threat to research and, by blocking research,
to human life.
Such stalling also, ironically, contributes to the

suffering of animals. Stanford officials, like most
reasonable people, believe that animals must be
treated humanely; the University wants to build
the new facility in part to modernize its animal
care and to alleviate the crowded conditions in
the existing animal labs.
The new building would allow necessary re
search to continue while minimizing the suffering
of research animals. To oppose the facility on
"animal rights" grounds, therefore, is not only
small-minded but also hypocritical.
But the use of an EIR to stall the project adds
another, deeply concerning dimension to the
problem. To exploit California's excellent envi
ronmental laws in order to gain the political up
per hand on a completely unrelated issue is bad
citizenship at best. It is criminal at worst. It
fleeces the University, the taxpayers and the state
of valuable resources.
And, by "crying wolf in this manner, these ac
tions endanger the legitimate access of other
grassroots organizations to the legal system.
The theme running through the actions of
these radical animal rights groups is an over
whelming selfishness thinly cloaked in the attrac
tive garb of concern for animals. To bully local
government into wasteful action — as the animal
rights people did with the EIR — demonstrates a
false and selfish elevation of their personal
agenda to the level of universal importance.
The Palo Alto Humane Society and other
animal rights groups should talk to the newly
founded, admirable organization which calls itself
Incurably 111 for Animal Research. Perhaps then
the animal rights activists would realize the
human cost of their political terrorism and see
their movement as the inappropriate, misguided
and dangerous effort that it is.
