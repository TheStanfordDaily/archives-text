# 'Good' isn't great enough
## 
### 
Although almost everybody
has caught on to the fact that their
$10 bought more last year than it
will this year, few have noticed
the similar trend that applies to
the word.

I first caught on to this trend
when I returned home and asked
people how their year was going
at school. "It's great!" declared
Sam, the first guy I asked. "I'm
having so much fun it's unbeliev
able. Bruce, you just couldn't
conceive of how awesome it is!"
I was overjoyed that Sam was
having such an incredible time at
school, but when I got similar
replies from the next two people I
talked to, I began to wonder if all
of those words — great, unbeliev
able, awesome — meant what
they were supposed to mean.
I had my answer when I told
someone that my term at school
was good. "Not too much work,
plenty of play time and some
good friends," I had said. Before
I knew it, word was out that
Bruce had a lousy term at school.

that he didn't like it too much and
that California wasn't all that it
was cut out to be.
It seems that if you don't re
member to inflate your words,
you won't get the correct idea
across. From then on, I told
everyone that my term at school
was "stupendous — probably the
term of the century. I went to
three parties a day, never saw a
classroom and had girls literally
begging to get in my room."
The word around my home
town now is that Bruce thinks
Stanford is OK.
(Please note that the preceding
story was exaggerated to the cor
rect degree. For those of you still
in pre-word-inflation mode, take
it with a few large grains of salt.)
Unfortunately, not everything
is inflating with age. Take, for ex
ample, television. I hate to be
nostalgic at my young age, but the
stuff they have on TV now just
does not compare to what they
used to have. It used to be that at
night you could watch M* A*S* H,
Star Trek, Candid Camera and
Get Smart, for a solid 24 hours of
entertainment.
Now, even with the 50 cable
channels you have to flip through
in order to find anything, you can
barely get 24 hours of entertain
ment in a week. And the Saturday
cartoon situation is even worse
than the prime time situation. I

remember when I was younger al
ways being so psyched to wake up
early and watch those great car
toons.
A lot of my friends at home rag
on Stanford for having only a
two-week vacation. "Two
weeks?!?" they say, "At Cornell I
get a six-week vacation. Boy, you
suckers at Stanford sure get
ripped off."
I have two comments to make
about that. First, this particular
friend was one of the same people
who told me that school was
"great — the time of the eon." I
know from first-hand experience
that his life at home isn't quite up
to that standard. Hmmm , . .
Second, with the possible ex
ception of those who must spend
time with family members who
live hundreds of miles apart, two
weeks is plenty of time.
If it's not enough time for you,
you're doing something wrong.
Take fewer units. Work a fewer
hours. Realize that the key to un
derstanding is not religious atten
dance at every scheduled lecture.
Remove as much unnecessary ef
fort from your schedule as possi
ble. Stanford has to be the easiest
school of its caliber in the world.
Make use of that fact.
Happy New Year.
