## Waiting game must end 
### 
The United States has not made a strong stand
concerning the invasion of Afghanistan since
boycotting the Moscow Olympics under Jimmy
Carter in 1980. The reason is very obvious: The
United States has only two choices and neither of
them seems to be better than the other. So taking a
stand is being postponed until the balance changes
in Afghanistan and until a third, better choice pops
up.

Hussein Al-Hussein

The first choice is to let the Soviets take Afghani
stan, just like they took neighboring Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan, Azrabijan and many other places late in
the last century and early in this century. This is a
very hard choice for a country that tries its best not
to let its main competitor on earth gain more power
and get closer to achieving its dream of reaching the
warm-water ports. The United States would also
lose dearly by letting the Russians gain more control
in the oil-producing areas.
The second choice is to vehemently help the Af
ghan resisters, the Mujahideen, with sophisticated
weapons the way the United States helps its close
allies such as IsraeL The .Mujahideen have over
500,000 fighters, and the shipment of such weapons
would be a great help for them. This is also a hard
choice for the United States, since defeating the
Russians may not serve the American interest much
in the area if the Mujahideen take control of Af
ghanistan and have a government. Such a govern
ment will not be obedient to the U.S. government
the way regimes in the surrounding countries are.
This is at least the way people who plan U.S. foreign
policy think.
Facing these two hard choices, the United States
found itself with no real conflict with the Russians
concerning Afghanistan at the recent summit, not
knowing that being idle for a while is like choosing
the first choice. The U.S. government thinks helping
the Mujahideen is not the right move at this mo
ment.
So the United States is waiting until it can influ
ence some of the leaders of the coalition of the
Mujahideen to be more receptive to Western
foreign policies. The real and influential leaders
among the Mujahideen are not the ones the United
States can rely on. So the United States is waiting
until one of the unknown leaders becomes famous
enough, with the intensive help of the U.S. media
and the CIA, and then will put all the U.S. eggs in
his basket.

The U.S. help to the Mujahideen is very symbolic
at the moment, and it merely goes to the ones the
United States is gambling on. The amount of help
has been a few hundred million dollars in all these
years — less than the cost of a single B-1 bomber.
Such symbolic help, however, allows the United
States to claim credit in the media for some of the
success of all the Mujahideen and to politically use
that help in its internal affairs by claiming that the
United States is standing against the Soviets and
against the spread of communism.
The Mujahideen have downed over 1300 Soviet
planes over the past few years with primitive weap
ons. Fewer than 100 were downed with the Stinger
missiles. However, only the downing of these latter
planes made it to the media and the major television
networks as a part of the game.
The United States may not realize it is playing a
dangerous game and that all the eggs in its single
basket could be lost easily. The time is running and
the Soviets are exterminating all forms of life in Af
ghanistan by demolishing all villages and by poison
ing the farms so that they won't be suitable for farm
ing for years to come.
Proper actions should be taken as soon as possible
before the identity of Afghanistan is washed away
and before it becomes the 17th republic of the So
viet Union. The next step will be Iran or Pakistan,
most probably Pakistan, in order to reach the warm
waters.
The Soviets say in every summit that they would
need a few months of cease-fire to pull out. This is a
lame claim since it took them one day to capture Af
ghanistan when they did not know the country, and
when fighting was needed to get in. It should take
them less time to leave the country they know well
by now and where fighting is not needed for a pul
lout.
The leaders the United States is counting on in
Afghanistan have slim chances of reaching power
there after the Soviets are defeated, since the
majority of the Majahideen are with the other
leaders. So the United States must send help to the
real potential leaders instead — before it is too late
to communicate with them.
If you turn away from someone when he needs
help, do not expect him to be that cooperative when
he wins and doesn't need help at all. The
Mujahideen have proven that they will win no mat
ter how primitive their weapons are, and they have
proven that Afghanistan will never be another
Czechoslovakia whether the United States helps
them or not.
After all, the Mujahideen have a more legitimate
cause than the contras, and they deserve better help.

ence some of the leaders of the coalition of the
Mujahideen to be more receptive to Western
foreign policies. The real and influential leaders
among the Mujahideen are not the ones the United
States can rely on. So the United States is waiting
until one of the unknown leaders becomes famous
enough, with the intensive help of the U.S. media
and the CIA, and then will put all the U.S. eggs in
his basket.

The U.S. help to the Mujahideen is very symbolic
at the moment, and it merely goes to the ones the
United States is gambling on. The amount of help
has been a few hundred million dollars in all these
years — less than the cost of a single B-1 bomber.
Such symbolic help, however, allows the United
States to claim credit in the media for some of the
success of all the Mujahideen and to politically use
that help in its internal affairs by claiming that the
United States is standing against the Soviets and
against the spread of communism.
The Mujahideen have downed over 1300 Soviet
planes over the past few years with primitive weap
ons. Fewer than 100 were downed with the Stinger
missiles. However, only the downing of these latter
planes made it to the media and the major television
networks as a part of the game.
The United States may not realize it is playing a
dangerous game and that all the eggs in its single
basket could be lost easily. The time is running and
the Soviets are exterminating all forms of life in Af
ghanistan by demolishing all villages and by poison
ing the farms so that they won't be suitable for farm
ing for years to come.
Proper actions should be taken as soon as possible
before the identity of Afghanistan is washed away
and before it becomes the 17th republic of the So
viet Union. The next step will be Iran or Pakistan,
most probably Pakistan, in order to reach the warm
waters.
The Soviets say in every summit that they would
need a few months of cease-fire to pull out. This is a
lame claim since it took them one day to capture Af
ghanistan when they did not know the country, and
when fighting was needed to get in. It should take
them less time to leave the country they know well
by now and where fighting is not needed for a pul
lout.
The leaders the United States is counting on in
Afghanistan have slim chances of reaching power
there after the Soviets are defeated, since the
majority of the Majahideen are with the other
leaders. So the United States must send help to the
real potential leaders instead — before it is too late
to communicate with them.
If you turn away from someone when he needs
help, do not expect him to be that cooperative when
he wins and doesn't need help at all. The
Mujahideen have proven that they will win no mat
ter how primitive their weapons are, and they have
proven that Afghanistan will never be another
Czechoslovakia whether the United States helps
them or not.
After all, the Mujahideen have a more legitimate
cause than the contras, and they deserve better help.

The United States has not made a strong stand
concerning the invasion of Afghanistan since
boycotting the Moscow Olympics under Jimmy
Carter in 1980. The reason is very obvious: The
United States has only two choices and neither of
them seems to be better than the other. So taking a
stand is being postponed until the balance changes
in Afghanistan and until a third, better choice pops
up.

Hussein Al-Hussein

The first choice is to let the Soviets take Afghani
stan, just like they took neighboring Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan, Azrabijan and many other places late in
the last century and early in this century. This is a
very hard choice for a country that tries its best not
to let its main competitor on earth gain more power
and get closer to achieving its dream of reaching the
warm-water ports. The United States would also
lose dearly by letting the Russians gain more control
in the oil-producing areas.
The second choice is to vehemently help the Af
ghan resisters, the Mujahideen, with sophisticated
weapons the way the United States helps its close
allies such as IsraeL The .Mujahideen have over
500,000 fighters, and the shipment of such weapons
would be a great help for them. This is also a hard
choice for the United States, since defeating the
Russians may not serve the American interest much
in the area if the Mujahideen take control of Af
ghanistan and have a government. Such a govern
ment will not be obedient to the U.S. government
the way regimes in the surrounding countries are.
This is at least the way people who plan U.S. foreign
policy think.
Facing these two hard choices, the United States
found itself with no real conflict with the Russians
concerning Afghanistan at the recent summit, not
knowing that being idle for a while is like choosing
the first choice. The U.S. government thinks helping
the Mujahideen is not the right move at this mo
ment.
So the United States is waiting until it can influ
ence some of the leaders of the coalition of the
Mujahideen to be more receptive to Western
foreign policies. The real and influential leaders
