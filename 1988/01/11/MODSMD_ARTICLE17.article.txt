# 1988: a surfeit of surprises lies ahead
## 
### 
I was so happy about the final demise of the
unfortunate and ill-starred year 1987 that I
invited a few close friends to join me in
celebrating over an elegant Chinese dinner at
the House of Nine Unusual Surprises. Some
where between the Moo Goo Yak and the
Simpering Rice in Pale Yellow Sauce, we
began to talk about what lay ahead in the new
year.

I'm not sure if we were suffused with cosmic
energy and simultaneously became one with
all possible temporal dimensions, or if it was
the effects of the MSG, but the future was
revealed to us in crystal clarity.
So don't bother spending the 75 cents to get
the predictions of some tabloid seer. You can
get yours here in The Daily absolutely free.
• Michael Jackson: In May, Michael will again
undergo massive facial reconstruction, emerg
ing as a dead ringer for Diana Ross. In August
he will offer Julian Lennon $3 million for the
remains of his father, superstar John Lennon.
Julian will at first refuse, but eventually a
compromise will be reached in which Michael
will pay $ 19.99 for Yoko Ono, with a new set
of Ginsu knives thrown in as a bonus.
• The Salt Oracle: New-Age crystal scholars
will discover that the crystals in common table
salt have the most powerful channeling
energies yet known to Aquarian crystal craft.

Pia Zadora will upset a salt cellar in a posh
L. A. watering hole and inadvertantly channel
a powerful entity known only as the Salt
Oracle.
The Oracle will stun the world when it
reveals, through Pia, that the Ayatollah
Khomeini is actually Ed McMahon in dis
guise, working off hostilities that have built up
after countless years of playing human laugh
track for Johnny Carson.
• The Supreme Court: Nominee Anthony
Kennedy will be rejected following the dis
covery that he enjoys inhaling gas fumes while
filling up his car. Noting a possible connection
between this and airplane glue sniffing, the
Senate will refuse to confirm. A further inves
tigation into the conduct of the present
justices will horrify the nation by revealing
that the members of the high court get to
gether at Sandra Day O'Connor's house on
Sunday afternoons for canasta and nude jello
wrestling.
• Royal High Jinx: Unhappy with Prince
Charles and yearning for a taste of the good
life, Di will file for divorce early in April. In
June, she will stun the world by announcing
her engagement to U2's Bono. Following the
marriage, she will join the band herself,
playing the hammer dulcimer. Charles will
reportedly begin shopping for a mail-order
bride.
• Michael Landon will be killed in a freak
auto accident on Interstate 5. Shortly there
after, it will come to light that he was actually
a member of the Colombian drug trade and a
child pornographer. NBC will air a memorial
docu-drama called "Highway Straight to
Heil," and Melissa Gilbert will write a best
seller about her years on television with Lan
don titled "Pa Dearest."

• Space Aliens From Beyond: Aliens from the
Orion star cluster will put in a surprise ap
pearance at the Academy Awards, accusing
Steven Spielberg of plagiarizing material from
one of their most popular soap operas to get
footage for his latest movie, "batteries not in
cluded." The Academy, stunned by the fact
that the aliens also bear a strange resemblance
to ET, will discredit Spielberg and vote for the
Orionians. Spielberg, again cheated of an Os
car, will retire to Australia and write jingles
for cat-food commercials.
• The Presidential Flection: The Republicans
will nominate George Bush but, aware of his
bland and colorless image, will select Prince as
a running mate, thus adding a bit of spice to
the ticket. The Democrats, fearful of a
landslide defeat, will retaliate by casting aside
all of their present candidates and substituting
Madonna, with Ed Bartles as a running mate.
The race will be a close one, with the office
eventually going to Bon Jovi, running on an
independent ticket.
• Stanford Residences: In early February,
both Branner and Toyon halls will be closed
for violating safety standards when it is shown
that they could not survive a monsoon of more
than two weeks duration. The already over
burdened residences will be unable to absorb
the new waves of refugees, and tent camps —
dubbed modern-day Hoovervilles — will have
to be erected on the bed of Lake Lagunita.
This will cause massive student unrest when it
forces the canceling of windsurfing classes in
the spring, and the ASSU Senate will spend
most of May debating about whether or not to
have condom dispensers installed in the tents.

more. His column appears every other Mon

I was so happy about the final demise of the
unfortunate and ill-starred year 1987 that I
invited a few close friends to join me in
celebrating over an elegant Chinese dinner at
the House of Nine Unusual Surprises. Some
where between the Moo Goo Yak and the
Simpering Rice in Pale Yellow Sauce, we
began to talk about what lay ahead in the new
year.

I'm not sure if we were suffused with cosmic
energy and simultaneously became one with
all possible temporal dimensions, or if it was
the effects of the MSG, but the future was
revealed to us in crystal clarity.
So don't bother spending the 75 cents to get
the predictions of some tabloid seer. You can
get yours here in The Daily absolutely free.
• Michael Jackson: In May, Michael will again
undergo massive facial reconstruction, emerg
ing as a dead ringer for Diana Ross. In August
he will offer Julian Lennon $3 million for the
remains of his father, superstar John Lennon.
Julian will at first refuse, but eventually a
compromise will be reached in which Michael
will pay $ 19.99 for Yoko Ono, with a new set
of Ginsu knives thrown in as a bonus.
• The Salt Oracle: New-Age crystal scholars
will discover that the crystals in common table
salt have the most powerful channeling
energies yet known to Aquarian crystal craft.

Pia Zadora will upset a salt cellar in a posh
L. A. watering hole and inadvertantly channel
a powerful entity known only as the Salt
Oracle.
The Oracle will stun the world when it
reveals, through Pia, that the Ayatollah
Khomeini is actually Ed McMahon in dis
guise, working off hostilities that have built up
after countless years of playing human laugh
track for Johnny Carson.
• The Supreme Court: Nominee Anthony
Kennedy will be rejected following the dis
covery that he enjoys inhaling gas fumes while
filling up his car. Noting a possible connection
between this and airplane glue sniffing, the
Senate will refuse to confirm. A further inves
tigation into the conduct of the present
justices will horrify the nation by revealing
that the members of the high court get to
gether at Sandra Day O'Connor's house on
Sunday afternoons for canasta and nude jello
wrestling.
• Royal High Jinx: Unhappy with Prince
Charles and yearning for a taste of the good
life, Di will file for divorce early in April. In
June, she will stun the world by announcing
her engagement to U2's Bono. Following the
marriage, she will join the band herself,
playing the hammer dulcimer. Charles will
reportedly begin shopping for a mail-order
bride.
• Michael Landon will be killed in a freak
auto accident on Interstate 5. Shortly there
after, it will come to light that he was actually
a member of the Colombian drug trade and a
child pornographer. NBC will air a memorial
docu-drama called "Highway Straight to
Heil," and Melissa Gilbert will write a best
seller about her years on television with Lan
don titled "Pa Dearest."

• Space Aliens From Beyond: Aliens from the
Orion star cluster will put in a surprise ap
pearance at the Academy Awards, accusing
Steven Spielberg of plagiarizing material from
one of their most popular soap operas to get
footage for his latest movie, "batteries not in
cluded." The Academy, stunned by the fact
that the aliens also bear a strange resemblance
to ET, will discredit Spielberg and vote for the
Orionians. Spielberg, again cheated of an Os
car, will retire to Australia and write jingles
for cat-food commercials.
• The Presidential Flection: The Republicans
will nominate George Bush but, aware of his
bland and colorless image, will select Prince as
a running mate, thus adding a bit of spice to
the ticket. The Democrats, fearful of a
landslide defeat, will retaliate by casting aside
all of their present candidates and substituting
Madonna, with Ed Bartles as a running mate.
The race will be a close one, with the office
eventually going to Bon Jovi, running on an
independent ticket.
• Stanford Residences: In early February,
both Branner and Toyon halls will be closed
for violating safety standards when it is shown
that they could not survive a monsoon of more
than two weeks duration. The already over
burdened residences will be unable to absorb
the new waves of refugees, and tent camps —
dubbed modern-day Hoovervilles — will have
to be erected on the bed of Lake Lagunita.
This will cause massive student unrest when it
forces the canceling of windsurfing classes in
the spring, and the ASSU Senate will spend
most of May debating about whether or not to
have condom dispensers installed in the tents.
