# Too few TAs, prof. contends

### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
History Prof. Barton Bernstein
will file a complaint with the Uni
versity in response to his prob
lems in obtaining enough
"reasonably qualified" teaching
assistants for his popular Ameri
can history class, America Since
1945.
Bernstein was apologetic when
he explained to students in His
tory 172 A Thursday that he was
unable to accomodate more than
60 of the approximately 200 stu
dents who wanted to take a dis
cussion section for his class.
Discussion sections in 172 A
are optional but, if taken, entitle a
student to a fifth unit of credit.
Bernstein alleged there is a dis
crepancy between what Stanford
says and what it actually does
concerning the resources it
devotes to undergraduate educa
tion.
"This University is great on
rhetoric but merely good on
doing everything possible for its
students," he said.
Bernstein explained that his in
ability to arrange for more sec
tions was due to a combination of
factors. He said restrictive rules in
Stanford's graduate schools of
fered disincentives to becoming a
teaching assistant, that there is a
shortage of possible section
leaders whom he has personally
taught and feels comfortable
with, and that there is an overall
lack of funds with which to pay
teaching assistants.
Bernstein said he is still not
sure what tack he will take with
the University on this matter.
"It's not clear who's responsible
and I can't offer a real solution
until I understand what the prob
lem is. It's partially a need for
more money, and there's also a

need for a willingness on the part
of the graduate school to be
flexible with allowing people to
teach," he said.
"An overall shortage of gradu
ate students has arisen in the past
four years and is part of the
source of the problem. There is
also the problem that the gradu
ate schools' fellowship rules make
it very unprofitable to teach for
any reason other than a desire to
do so," Bernstein said.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
agreed with Bernstein. "This
University ought to be willing to
spend money to insure that he has
a proper number of sections,"
Rebholz said. "The University
should go outside itself and to the
community. Stanford should do
whatever it takes."

Bernstein contrasted Univer
sity behavior as a whole with that
of the History Department. The
History Department, Bernstein
said, has worked to solve the
problem. He noted that the chair
man of the department, Prof.
James Sheehan had been "more
than helpful and very responsi
ble."
Both Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall and Psychology
Prof. Phil Zimbardo lamented the
lack of graduate students in the
social sciences, as well as the im
pact this shortage has had on the
availability of qualified section
leaders.
Marshall said there has been a
15-year decline in the number of
graduate students in the social
sciences. "The bottom dropped

out of the market for Ph.D's. En
rollment did not grow in the
1970s as the number of jobs for
academics declined," he said.
Zimbardo said that the number
of psychology graduate students
has been halved to between 12
and 15 since he came to Stanford
20 years ago. He attributed this to
financial cutbacks in the psychol
ogy department, cutbacks which
he said necessitate using under
graduates, as well as graduate stu
dents as TAs for Psychology 1.
Bernstein, also having trouble
finding a large enough room to
hold class in, concluded, "It is
troubling that all these problems
exist. The University should be
devoting serious time and re
sources to improving them."
