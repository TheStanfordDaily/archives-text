# Frats coach YMCA basketball
## 
### K. Kay Devgan Staff writer 
When 8-year-old Scott Aston came home
from YMCA basketball practice the other
day, his mother was suprised to hear that his
new coach "had legs like a 30-year-old man,
but a face like a teenager."
Aston's new coach is a Stanford student,
working as part of the Inter-Fraternity Coun
cil's newly sponsored community service proj
ect in conjunction with the Stanford Area
Youth Basketball Program.
The project consists of fraternity members
who volunteer to coach third-, fourth-, fifth -
and sixth-grade basketball teams in the Palo
Alto YMCA Basketball League. This quarter,
seven fraternities will coach eight of the
league teams.
Junior Hubert Ho, the IFC community
service chairperson and a member of Theta
Xi, developed the idea of volunteer coaching
from his own experience coaching a youth
soccer team and felt that it would be a
worthwhile project for fraternities to un
dertake.
"Coaching soccer gave me a good chance to
meet the community — both the parents and
the kids. I got a lot out of meeting people in
the Palo Alto area, and coaching is always fun.
I thought (the project) would be a great idea
to get other people on campus involved, too,"
Ho said.
The basketball program, organized by the
YMCA in cooperation with the city of Palo

Alto's Department of Recreation, is designed
to be an instructional league.
Over 100 teams and roughly 1 100 elemen
tary school children from the Palo Alto,
Mountain View and Los Altos areas are in
volved in the basketball leagues. Stanford fra
ternity members volunteer in the program
where additional coaches are needed.
According to Todd Flesner, director of the
YMCA program, the enthusiastic response of
the fraternities will help make the three
month season, which lasts from January
through March, more productive and a better
experience for the kids.
"The Stanford fraternity participation will
be a big help to us this year. With 102 teams
and our reliance on community volunteer
services, the extra help will be a big boon for
our program," he said.
"This is the fifth year of the basketball
league, and with a 10-percent margin of
growth from last year, it's getting even harder
to recruit volunteers to donate their help,"
Flesner said. Currently, the YMCA is looking
for additional referees who will be paid for
their help in the games.
Aside from straight coaching, organizers
expect that team players will also benefit from
their close contact with the Stanford students.
Fraternity volunteers will stress the instruc
tional aspect of the game, as opposed to the
competitive elements of the sport.
The program emphasizes that every player
is a valuable member of the team. As such, the

league policy is that everyone plays at least
half of a game.
Joining the YMCA league is for many kids
the first experience with a team sport. For this
reason, it is important for the coaches to make
an impact on the kids right from the begin
ning, Flesner said.
Having coaches closer to the age level of the
kids will help to provide a balance between
learning a sport and having an effective leader
and role model to look up to, he added.
Junior Luke Padwick, a member of the Beta
Theta Pi fraternity, is an assistant coach for a
third- and fourth-grade team this quarter.
Padwick said he joined the IFC program be
cause he "liked working with kids and thought
that coaching basketball was a good way to get
off campus and have a lot of fun while doing
something constructive."
"I think it's good that we get to work to
gether," Padwick said of his time with the
players.
"We're closer to the kids and don't feel as
separated from them as the parents do, but
we're still old enough that they can look up to
us and learn something. I think both the kids
and coaches benefit," he added. " They got a
kick out of our being there at our first practice
— they thought that we were on the Stanford
basketball team, and we got a kick out of
that."
Most parents and team members also said
they feel that the student participation will be

worthwhile.
Paul Grimsrud, assistant coach
for his son's team said he feels
"really appreciative of the enthu
siasm that the (student) coaches
had. They seem to relate to the
kids really well, and I'm im
pressed with the good role
modeling that's going on. The
kids have some good guys to look
up to."

kids and don't feel as
separated from them as
the parents do, but
we're still old enough
that they can look up to
us and learn something.

and coaches bene
fit '

Eight-year-old Mark Grimsrud
said he enjoys the team and is
happy with his new coaches,
junior Bob Keith and sophomore
Ryan Lordos, both members of
Theta Xi. "It's fun playing bas
ketball because I was always
pretty good at it,"he said. "Our
coach is nice too because he plays
with us sometimes."
Ronald Stamper, a fourth
grader, said he joined the team
because he didn't get to play foot
ball last year.
"I think we're going to win
games this year," Stamper said,
adding that he "likes having the
new coaches because most

coaches that are dads always try
to take over."
Aston, who attends Los Altos
Christian School, said that he
likes to play basketball so he
joined the team with one of his
friends. He said he enjoys
scrimmages, and describes his
new coaches as "sort of nicer
since they let you get by with a lot
of stuff — they don't give you
long lectures."
Scott's mother, Andi Aston,
agreed that the student coaches
are "fabulous. They really get the
kids excited and motivated. I
think [the teani| learns more this
way than if their parents were
coaching. It's refreshing to see the
University's interest."
Head coaches for this quarter
include Keith, Padwick, senior
Scott Bedgood of Theta Xi, soph
omore David Hill of Theta Delta
Chi, senior Tony Burgos of Delta
Kappa Epsilon, sophomore
David Thurman of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, senior Stephen Zanolli
of Kappa Sigma and junior John
Romero of Phi Delta Theta.
Ho said that he would like to
see the coaches develop close re
lationships with the kids so the
kids feel they can confide in their
coaches.
He would also like to start a
team circle after every practice in
which kids can talk informally
and coaches can bring up impor
tant issues such as drugs, alcohol
and school problems.
Eventually, the IFC hopes that
the YMCA project will expand to
other sports — such as baseball —
next quarter. Involving the Inter-
Sorority Council with the YMCA
girls sports teams may also
become a future community ser
vice goal.
For the moment, however,
Flesner said most team members
are just hoping this will be a good
season.
