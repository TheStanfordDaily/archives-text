## Academy's 'Remembrance Days' a Dream 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
The Dream Academy —
M Remembrance Days"
Remember The Dream Acad
emy?
Oh, come on, it hasn't been
that long. Remember "Life in a
Northern Town"? "The Love
Parade"? Now you remember.
Yes, those guys have a new album
out.
Well, yes, it has been a long
time, Virginia, but it was well
worth the wait: "Remembrance
Days" is one of the finest and
most underrated records released
in the past six months.
Now I know what you're think
ing: This writer is on the payroll
of Reprise Records. The rookie

reviewer sold out, compromising
his integrity for a little extra cash.
Oh, the shame of it all!
Relax — 1 haven't even heard
of Reprise Records, nor do 1
canvas them for bribes. The truth
is that the album is a fine piece of
work that is being routinely
ignored by the masses that have
made Belinda Carlisle the next
great diva. From the first note of
"Indian Summer" to the last of
"In Exile (For Rodrigo Rojas),"
"Remembrance Days" is like
heaven on earth (the pun well
intended, Belinda fans).
Those two songs, in fact, are
the strongest points of the album,
and their place on the album is
certainly no accident. "Indian
Summer" picks up right where
"One Dream," the melifluous

conclusion of The Dream Acad
emy's debut album, left off.
Weaving a tale of a summer
romance that was never realized,
singer/songwriter/producer Nick
Laird-Clowes creates one of the
most beautiful songs of 1987 in
the tradition of the band's top-10
hit "Life in a Northern Town."
But the masterpiece of
"Remembrance Days" is "In
Exile," an elegant commentary
on the horrors of Central
America from the view of an ex
patriate. Laird-Clowes and col
laborators Gilbert Gabriel and
Kate St. John artfully juxtapose
lyrics like "Remember: Soldiers
shooting into the crowd at the
university/ Growing up under
government/ Where to be young
is to be the enemy" with in

nocuously harmonic instrumenta
tion to make an articulate plea
against the violence.
Consistency is the hallmark of a
great recording artist, and The
Dream Academy is clearly consis
tent. Every song on the album is
pleasant and well-crafted, and
each has something intelligent to
say. In this era in which nicely
packaged nonsense is produced in
abundance, intelligence in
modern music is a welcome
change of pace.
If you were a fan of The Dream
Academy's first album, you will
like "Remembrance Days" even
more. If for some reason you
missed "The Dream Academy,"
go pick up a copy of this follow
up record and enjoy — it doesn't
get much better than this.
