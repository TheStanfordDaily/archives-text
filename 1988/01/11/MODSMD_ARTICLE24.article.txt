Gene Loves Jezebel —"The House of Dolls"
Oh boy, another cult band tries to make it big!
After a surprise success with its last album and
first domestic release "Discover," fueled by the
strong singles "Heartache" and "Desire," Gene
Loves Jezebel is back and sounding more over
produced and commercial than even Casey Kasem
could imagine.
For those uninitiated into the sphere of post-Punk
British music, Gene Loves Jezebel is not a piece of
graffiti scribbled on a Rodin sculpture by an
amorous Weenie too cheap to send a Valentine
card. No, Gene Loves Jezebel is an English quartet,
headed by twins Jay and Michael Aston, which now
has four albums to its credit.
Or discredit, as is the case with this album. While
it is not the worst record to ever reach vinyl, the As
tons are hardly going to be jumping up out of their

seats come Grammy time, and probably won't even
waste the time attending.
"The House of Dolls" is basically a big hunk of
ear candy, nice to listen to but without much sub
stance. Like a can of Wizard air freshener in a fish
market, the high-quality production can only dis
guise the vacuous material it attempts to embellish.
Now, mindless music can be nice sometimes. I
know that there are a lot of times when listening to
drivel like Starship's "It's Not Over 'Til It's Over" is
a nice break from academic rigors, just as
"Gilligan's Island" is fun Saturday morning fare;
but you'll hardly notice me running out to drop
eight bucks on Starship, either.
Fortunately — since I did spend the cash — the
Gene Loves Jezebel record wasn't all that bad, nar
rowly escaping the Rubbish Bin Hall of Fame. "The
Motion of Love" is a nicely-crafted piece of pseudo
techno-pop that actually merits a second listen.
"Twenty Killer Hurts," the other single released
to date, is another decent song with a hard-driving

guitar line and lyrics that even border on making a
statement. True to the style of "The House of
Dolls," it pulls back just in time, lest the tune have
any discernable message.
The only other one-eyed men in this 10-song
kingdom of the blind are "Gorgeous" and
"Suspicion," but a second listening to each of those
songs soon dispels the novelty. "Every Door,
which ended side one, is another nice-sounding
piece that even stood up to a second scrutiny.
Apart from "Twenty Killer Hurts," the second
side is a wasteland vast enough to make T. S. Eliot
twinge with envy. None of the tunes really merited
the first listening, let alone a second or third, though
"Message" comes about the closest to providing
some substantial entertainment.
"The House of Dolls" is a good album for a single
listening, but just borrow it from a friend who, like
me, had mistakenly high hopes for Gene Loves
Jezebel after the quality of "Discover." Or borrow
it from me — I shan't be playing it much!
