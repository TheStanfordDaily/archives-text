# Androgynous wear is the latest fashion crime
## FASHION CONSCIENCE 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
After spending a good deal of
the holiday season in shopping
malls, there is one ongoing trend
in a few stores which continues to
disturb and frighten me. This
trend is the prevalence of
androgynous clothing.
Let me give you an example of
why this is so scary. One day, I
walked into my local, colorful
Gap outlet and I found this
button-down shirt that I thought
really looked cool.
So, when I went to try it on, I
noticed that all the buttons were
on the wrong side. It was then
that a female Gap employee in
formed me that it was a woman's
shirt.
Now, I had never known that
women's shirts were buttoned on
the opposite side. Why is this so?
How do right handed women get
used to having buttons on the left
hand side of their shirts?
Anyway, the Gap employee
assured me it was OK, and that I
should go ahead and try the shirt
on regardless of the fact that it
was designed for women. She told
me that a lot of men wear
women's shirts and sweaters and
vice versa. But by this time, 1 was
feeling very self-conscious, and
my male friends were laughing at
me, so I decided to forget it.
But hey, the shirt looked like a

men's shirt, so how was I
supposed to know? Now,
everytime 1 go in the Gap, I have
to ask which side of the store is
for women and which side is for
men. Whatever happened to the
good old days when men's clothes
were made for men and women's
clothes were made for women?
The big question here is why is
androgynous clothing so popular?
The way the Gap girl explained
it to me was that androgynous
clothing is more popular among
women than it is among men. As
a result, whenever you walk into
an androgynous clothing store
you will almost always see cloth
ing that looks like it was designed
for men.
The rationale is this: Men will
only wear clothing that is made
for men; however, women will
wear clothing that is made for
men and women. Women like
men's clothes because of comfort.
Men will never wear anything
made for a woman even if it's the
most comfortable thing in the

world.
After all, it's easier to picture a
woman in a shirt and a pair of
pants than it is to picture a man in
a blouse and a skirt. At least, it
should be easier to picture it that
way.
Unfortunately, the Gap is only
one of many stores that perpetu
ate the popularity of androgynous
clothing. Other stores that add to
the confusion are Miller's Out
post, Benetton, Banana Republic
and AC A Joe.
Miller's Outpost tends to be a
little more distinct in its gender
boundaries, since, as you walk in,
one side clearly has blouses for
women and shirts for men.
However, as you walk further
into the store, with its assortment
of Levi accessories, the bound
aries aren't as clear.
Benetton is one of the stores in
which I had the hardest time dis
tinguishing men's from women's
clothing, because the only thing it
seems like the store sells is
sweaters, and all the sweaters

look exactly alike. On the other
hand, this is the one store where
the employees make sure you
know which clothes are for
women and which are for men.
But what difference could it
make? A sweater is a sweater.
However, when 1 saw something I
liked, a salesperson would slap
my hand and tell me I was in the
wrong section — men's sweaters
were on the other side of the
store.
Banana Republic, with all its
safari gear, is another difficult
place to figure, especially since
everything they sell is khaki. It's
also difficult to figure why this
place is so popular. Why would
anyone want to dress up like Fidel
Castro?
AC A Joe is one of the more
trendy and expensive androgyn
ous shops. Here, there seems to
he no distinction between men's
and women's clothing. In fact, the
only way to determine the gender
for which a particular piece of
clothing is intended is to ask —
otherwise they won't tell you.
What does androgynous cloth
ing mean for society as a whole?
For women, it means that the
status boundaries which have
caused discrepancies in equality
throughout history are becoming
less defined. For men, it means
another reason not to go shop
ping.

After spending a good deal of
the holiday season in shopping
malls, there is one ongoing trend
in a few stores which continues to
disturb and frighten me. This
trend is the prevalence of
androgynous clothing.
Let me give you an example of
why this is so scary. One day, I
walked into my local, colorful
Gap outlet and I found this
button-down shirt that I thought
really looked cool.
So, when I went to try it on, I
noticed that all the buttons were
on the wrong side. It was then
that a female Gap employee in
formed me that it was a woman's
shirt.
Now, I had never known that
women's shirts were buttoned on
the opposite side. Why is this so?
How do right handed women get
used to having buttons on the left
hand side of their shirts?
Anyway, the Gap employee
assured me it was OK, and that I
should go ahead and try the shirt
on regardless of the fact that it
was designed for women. She told
me that a lot of men wear
women's shirts and sweaters and
vice versa. But by this time, 1 was
feeling very self-conscious, and
my male friends were laughing at
me, so I decided to forget it.
But hey, the shirt looked like a

men's shirt, so how was I
supposed to know? Now,
everytime 1 go in the Gap, I have
to ask which side of the store is
for women and which side is for
men. Whatever happened to the
good old days when men's clothes
were made for men and women's
clothes were made for women?
The big question here is why is
androgynous clothing so popular?
The way the Gap girl explained
it to me was that androgynous
clothing is more popular among
women than it is among men. As
a result, whenever you walk into
an androgynous clothing store
you will almost always see cloth
ing that looks like it was designed
for men.
The rationale is this: Men will
only wear clothing that is made
for men; however, women will
wear clothing that is made for
men and women. Women like
men's clothes because of comfort.
Men will never wear anything
made for a woman even if it's the
most comfortable thing in the

world.
After all, it's easier to picture a
woman in a shirt and a pair of
pants than it is to picture a man in
a blouse and a skirt. At least, it
should be easier to picture it that
way.
Unfortunately, the Gap is only
one of many stores that perpetu
ate the popularity of androgynous
clothing. Other stores that add to
the confusion are Miller's Out
post, Benetton, Banana Republic
and AC A Joe.
Miller's Outpost tends to be a
little more distinct in its gender
boundaries, since, as you walk in,
one side clearly has blouses for
women and shirts for men.
However, as you walk further
into the store, with its assortment
of Levi accessories, the bound
aries aren't as clear.
Benetton is one of the stores in
which I had the hardest time dis
tinguishing men's from women's
clothing, because the only thing it
seems like the store sells is
sweaters, and all the sweaters

look exactly alike. On the other
hand, this is the one store where
the employees make sure you
know which clothes are for
women and which are for men.
But what difference could it
make? A sweater is a sweater.
However, when 1 saw something I
liked, a salesperson would slap
my hand and tell me I was in the
wrong section — men's sweaters
were on the other side of the
store.
Banana Republic, with all its
safari gear, is another difficult
place to figure, especially since
everything they sell is khaki. It's
also difficult to figure why this
place is so popular. Why would
anyone want to dress up like Fidel
Castro?
AC A Joe is one of the more
trendy and expensive androgyn
ous shops. Here, there seems to
he no distinction between men's
and women's clothing. In fact, the
only way to determine the gender
for which a particular piece of
clothing is intended is to ask —
otherwise they won't tell you.
