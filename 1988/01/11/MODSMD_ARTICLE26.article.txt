"Blues," the latest work by
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist
John Hersey, includes a small an
thology of poems that are a testa
ment to the enduring intrigue of
the sea. The poems are also one
of the minor achievements of the
book, a strange compound of
fishing tips, verse, ecological
biological informa
tion, recipes, and meditations on
the nature of oceanic life.
Though the book's more prac
tical aspects will be of little value
to Californians, as bluefish are
not found in the American
Pacific, it is intended less as a
■ guide to this particular amuse
.ment than as an example for an
informed communion with the
natural world.
; Hersey takes not only the
book's unfortunate dialogue
form, but his philosophical model
as well, from Izaak Walton's
•"The Complete Angler." As
Walton writes, "He that hopes to
be a good angler must not only
bring an inquiring, searching, ob
serving wit, but he must bring a
large measure of hope and pa
tience and a love and propensity
to the art itself."
Hersey's goal in this work is to
restore these human qualities,
along with a more somber
recognition of current threats to
the persistence of the natural
world, to the pastime of rodfish
ing.
All victims of Sunday after
noon television know that there
are few things more boring than
watching a couple of guys fishing.
One of those few, unhappy things
must be to read a transcript of the
fishermen's dialogue, and in its
too frequent weaker moments,
"Blues" reaches this level of in
tolerability.
The book is structured around
12 fishing trips that "the Fisher

man" (Hersey) and"the
Stranger" take together during a
summer at Martha's Vineyard, an
island off the shore of Massachu
setts. Much of their talk is trite,
awkward and improbable:
Stranger: My God!
Fisherman: Yes, indeed. You
have a life force out there on the
end of the line. Keep it coming.
Stranger: Damn. It's off.
Fisherman: No, it's swimming
toward you. Keep reeling . . .
Stranger: Oh, yes, it's on. How
strong it is! Look at that leap!
One can stand only so much of
this business, and, thankfully,
Hersey periodically frees the
Fisherman from the confines of
the conversational form and al
lows him to expound on what he
knows of bluefish, fishing,
seagulls and the sea.
Blues are a particularly vicious
fish. Their feeding habits, as Her
sey shows in a description of a
marine laboratory film, are
frenzied, cannibalistic, and can
not be accounted for by the
demands of appetite. The relent
lessness with which the blue,
while feeding, attacks anything,
even a bare hook, has made it
relatively unpopular with those
fishermen who desire a more
sporting challenge. Yet Hersey
both admires the murderous
vitality of this fish and finds it an
emblem of the higher complexity
of the natural world.
The blue is also an apt focus for
this study in that the carnage in
which it thrives is more forcefully
reminiscent of the current state of
the environment than the
lifestyles of more placid and dis
cerning fish.
Hersey emphasizes the local ef
fects of the prevailing, short
sighted disregard for the fragile
realities of nature: the decline of
the striped bass, the choking
predominance of foreign sea
weeds in Vineyard waters, the ne
cessity for active interference in

the squabbles between herring
gulls and black-backed gulls. The
result of these crankish, eloquent,
well-considered complaints is to
include the reader — even the
reader unfamiliar with the outer
islands of the North Atlantic — in
the everyday beauties and disap
pointments of a unique environ
ment and to provide a similar
consideration of his own sur
roundings.
Despite the flatness of the
dialogue, the cumulative effect of
"Blues" is to convincingly
reproduce a series of fishing trips
with an informed and thoughtful
guide who has spent the time ne
cessary to grow familiar with a
particular seascape. It is really a
personal narrative, a record of the
author's conversation with a por
tion of nature. This infusion of

the personal, the local, into scien
tific inquiries is what gives the
book its finer passages, as in this
extraordinary lecture on the
noises of the sea, their lasting
power:
Poets may sing of the silent sea.
It isn't. Far from it. Water con
ducts sound much more efficiently
than air does, and the oceans are
alive not only with plankton but
also with racket. To begin with,
there are the sounds of the transac
tions of the water itself, the electic
fizzle of combing waves, the
fracture of breakers, the brabble
of wash on the shore. At anchor in
deep darkness at night /' ve heard
up where I live, here in the air, but
the sound is under the water too -
the rip along the Middle Ground
chattering as loud as a flock of
starlings.
