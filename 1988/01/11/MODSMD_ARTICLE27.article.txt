"From Rockaway"

Introducing the Molly
Ringwald Syndrome. For some
bizarre reason, many people
have been gulled into believing
that this rich bitch with the oh
so-pouty lips is the definitive
word on the human condition
at the end of adolescence.
She's not — not by a long shot.
Unfortunately, the "Pretty
in Pink" girl now seems to
have crossed over from the
movies into print. "From
Rockaway," Jill Eisenstadt's
debut novel, features Alex, a
Ringwald-esque freshman at
mythical Camden College who
is trying to break away from a
deadbeat crowd of hometown
lifeguards, most of whom are
high-school dropouts from
Rockaway, Long Island.
This town-gown scheme, a
reasonable formula for por
traying the cathartic "passage
into adulthood," worked best
in the movie "Breaking
Away." The idea is to match
the fatalistic philosophy of the
burn-outs against the naive
worldliness of the college
neophytes. Usually, the col
legians get their comeuppance
(something Stanford students
should identify with).
Eisenstadt herself came
from Rockaway — an upscale
middle class town in New York
— and went to school at priey
Bennington College in Ver
mont and later Columbia Uni
versity, so she should be
familiar with the conflict she
portrays in her book. But she
doesn't quite pull it off.

The problem is twofold:
characterization and style. The
author's ensemble of teenage
characters, a la the movie "St.
Elmo's Fire" (which, surpris
ingly didn't star Molly
Ringwald) is flat and insipid.
Eisenstadt's main literary
device is letting the characters
think out loud. But stupid
characters thinking out loud
are going to say stupid things;
let's not assign any profundity
to a passage simply because it
happens to be a stream of con
sciousness.

One good example is the
workings of the mind of Chow
derhead (!), a Rockaway
lifeguard on the road to
nowhere. Commenting to him
self on another lifeguard, he
opines, "Who knows what
could happen next? It was
suspense. She might do just
about anything, soon. It was a
feeling like . . . danger." Gag,
says the reader.
It's too bad. A large theme
