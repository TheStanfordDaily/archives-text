Introducing the Molly
Ringwald Syndrome. For some
bizarre reason, many people
have been gulled into believing
that this rich bitch with the oh
so-pouty lips is the definitive
word on the human condition
at the end of adolescence.
She's not — not by a long shot.
Unfortunately, the "Pretty
in Pink" girl now seems to
have crossed over from the
movies into print. "From
Rockaway," Jill Eisenstadt's
debut novel, features Alex, a
Ringwald-esque freshman at
mythical Camden College who
is trying to break away from a
deadbeat crowd of hometown
lifeguards, most of whom are
high-school dropouts from
Rockaway, Long Island.
This town-gown scheme, a
reasonable formula for por
traying the cathartic "passage
into adulthood," worked best
in the movie "Breaking
Away." The idea is to match
the fatalistic philosophy of the
burn-outs against the naive
worldliness of the college
neophytes. Usually, the col
legians get their comeuppance
(something Stanford students
should identify with).
Eisenstadt herself came
from Rockaway — an upscale
middle class town in New York
— and went to school at priey
Bennington College in Ver
mont and later Columbia Uni
versity, so she should be
familiar with the conflict she
portrays in her book. But she
doesn't quite pull it off.

The problem is twofold:
characterization and style. The
author's ensemble of teenage
characters, a la the movie "St.
Elmo's Fire" (which, surpris
ingly didn't star Molly
Ringwald) is flat and insipid.
Eisenstadt's main literary
device is letting the characters
think out loud. But stupid
characters thinking out loud
are going to say stupid things;
let's not assign any profundity
to a passage simply because it
happens to be a stream of con
sciousness.

One good example is the
workings of the mind of Chow
derhead (!), a Rockaway
lifeguard on the road to
nowhere. Commenting to him
self on another lifeguard, he
opines, "Who knows what
could happen next? It was
suspense. She might do just
about anything, soon. It was a
feeling like . . . danger." Gag,
says the reader.
It's too bad. A large theme

of the book is the confrontation
between the perspective of living
in Nowheresville and the perspec
tive of living Somewhere, Doing
Something. Rockaway is
derisively referred to as
Rotaway" or "Rockapulco."
I he Nowhere Man stuck in this
place should be able to point out
some of the hypocrisy behind the
facade of the mobile people.
And there's plenty of crap to
observe. As Alex goes off to
Camden, we meet a juvenile col
lege dorm scene that, although
stereotyped, hits home a bit too
often for our comfort. There are
"Dressed-to-Get-Laid" parties.
There is a chapter called "Three's
a Crowd," depicting the travails
of a couple in a one-room double
trying quietly to . . . well, you get
the idea. We've all been there.

As Alex goes off to
Camden, we meet a
juvenile college
dorm scene that, al
though stereotyped,
hits home a bit too
often for our com
fort. . . . You get the
idea. We've all been
there.

Oh yes. The hook contains the
requisite amount of sex. Alex's
roommate (we never learn her
name) is mildly amusing as a
mindless sexpot who, along with
having the annoying habit of sep
arating her eyelashes with a
needle, also "wears her
diaphragm everywhere, to class
even, just in case."
Alex can't rescue us from this
scene. She's too infatuated with
some guy named Joe who won't

sleep with her, and she worries
too much about not fitting in on
campus because she has been told
that she's "too normal." And she
has a hometown boy named
Timmy who still pines for her,
and she doesn't know how to let
him down gently. And she sleeps
with a biology professor whom
she didn't like anyway, and later
regrets it.
Molly Kingwald, hello.
This crisis of conscience, if we
can call it that, is the crux of the
book. When the author finally
gets around to screwing Alex's
head on straight, we don't care
anymore: "There's nothing left to
feel except a little young and a
little sad," writes Eisenstadt.
"A little trite," we might add.
The book isn't all bad.
Eisenstadt has a cinematic vision,
an eye for detail in setting a
scene, that will stand her in good
stead in future works. In short,
clipped sentences, she pans the
Rockaway beach:
"Beach packed with greasy
flesh, damp hair, garbage. Kids
splash or ruin each other's castles
or beat each other with towels.
Old ladies read paperback mys
teries under umbrellas, their suits
with skirts attached. Cigarettes
and ankle chains."
The author also has a taste for
the macabre. Just for kicks,
having nothing better to do to
while away the hours, the Rock
away lifeguards feed Alka-Seltzer
to the seagulls in order to "watch
the birds' insides explode and
make a noise life a faucet being
turned on."
But to repeat, these foolish
lifeguards don't have much to
teach Alex, or us, about our prob
lems. They're not nihilists;
they're just looking out for num
ber one.
At first glance, it may seem un
fair to apply so many film refer
ences to this book. But it was
done intentionally, because the
book was written with the film in
dustry in mind. A fellow named
Bret Easton Ellis is currently
writing the same kind of stuff and
having it converted for the
movies. You may have heard of
his book/film "Less than Zero."
So get ready. Eisenstadt's
ready to be a big-time Hollywood
screenplay writer. Or — who
knows? — this drivel may even
appear on the big screen.
