In 1960, while a graduate stu
dent in anthropology at UCLA,
Carlos Castaneda met Juan
Matus, a Yaqui Indian who would
change his life. A year later, Cas
taneda altered his university re
search of medicinal and psyc
hotropic plants to began his ten
ure as an apprentice sorcerer un
der the tutelage of Matus, or don
Juan. With don Juan, Castaneda

embarked on the Path of Knowl
edge, learning the life of the War
rior. Since then, he has written
eight books recounting his experi
ence.
Many classify Castaneda's
works as mere "drug stories."
While it is true that his first two
books focus on his experimenta
tion with hallucinogenic plants
such as peyote and jimson weed,
these experiences occur in the
context of a rigorous system of
knowledge, belief and ritual.
Reading beyond the first two
books, one discovers that these
drug incidents were simply
heuristic devices designed to
shock Castaneda out of his com

placency; They were not meant to
be permanent modes of conduct.
The foundation of don Juan's
paradigm rests on the manipula
tion of awareness, one of the
three areas in which the sorcerer
must be an expert. Castaneda's
previous books have dealt almost
exclusively with this topic, but in
"The Power of Silence," he takes
us through the other two areas —
the art of stalking and the mastery
of intent.
Castaneda structures this book
quite simply; he recounts his ex
periences with don Juan much as
someone tells you about a day's
routine. To detail, however, he
adds much flair, and his stories
tend to shock us. If there is detail
in the smaller world, though, it is
missing from the larger picture;
Castaneda gives us no exact
chronology of months or years.
This lack of chronology, of
photographs or audio recordings
of don Juan as well, has drawn
significant criticism. So has Cas
taneda's refusal to disclose his
mentor's whereabouts. The fun
damental question, then, arises
whether our author is telling the
truth or fabricating an elaborate
myth.
The events in"The Power of
Silence" are extraordinary, and as
read in the light of his other
books they seriously tax one's
willingness to believe. For exam
ple, the basic premise of the
knowledge system into which
Castaneda is initiated states that
all human beings consist of a
bundle of luminous fibers tied to
the physical world by an intricate
series of links.
Heightened awareness is only
achieved by activating these links,
for they serve as the conduits of
energy that enable us to act
beyond the limits of the ordinary.
The sorcerer seeks to master the
manipulation of these links and
the subsequent shifts of aware
ness.
Does this seems a bit confusing
and far-fetched? Well, it is, and
Castaneda would be the first to
admit that. However, his works
take this system as completely
viable. The key to reading "The
Power of Silence," then, lies in
finding the generosity to ac

knowledge the possible validity of
an alien and challenging collec
tion of ideas.
In the forward to "The Power
of Silence," Castaneda writes,
"Our schooling — whether in
plain reasoning or in formal top
ics — is rigorous because the
knowledge we are trying to im
part is very complex. The same
criteria apply to the sorcerer's
world: Their schooling, which
relies on oral instruction and the
manipulation of awareness, al
though different from ours, is just
as rigorous, because their knowl
edge is as, or perhaps more, com
plex.
This rigorous knowledge sys
tem directly challenges our most

fundamental assumptions of the
world and the possibility of higher
meaning within it; Castaneda
does nothing less than force us to
confront ourselves. His work is
true exploration, and it goes
against every grain that "Western
Culture" has entrenched in us.
"The Power of Silence" will nei
ther coddle nor reaffirm.
In reviewing this book, one
cannot but speak around it; sum
mary is pointless, and a critique is
nearly impossible. If you do not
believe in Castaneda, you will put
the book down and walk away,
perhaps amused or disinterested.
The alternative is that you ex
press faith in him and accept the
possibility of different levels of
reality.
