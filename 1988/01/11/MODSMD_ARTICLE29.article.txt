## No. 3 Wildcats claw Cardinal 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
TUSCON — Blitzkrieged from
the beginning, the Stanford Car
dinal men's basketball team did
not have the firepower Saturday
to come back against the No. 3
Arizona Wildcats.
The Wildcats jumped out to an
8-0 lead and methodically put
away the visiting Cardinal 90-65
in front of 12,241 fans at McKale
Center. The victory raised
Arizona's record to 14-1 overall,
4-0 in the Pacific 10 conference.
Coach Lute Olson's team will
probably move back to the No. 1
position in the Associated Press
poll after loses by both No. 1
Kentucky and No. 2 Pittsburgh
last week.
Stanford, plagued by turnovers
for the second straight game,
drops its record to 10-5, 2-2.
With the Wildcats playing a
pressure defense, the Cardinal
managed only one shot in its first
four possessions. The Stanford
players were so rattled by the
pressure and the roaring crowd
that point guard Terry Taylor
threw the ball away twice, and 6-
foot-8 center Howard Wright at
tempted a 3-point shot.
On the other end of the court,
Arizona put on an offensive
show. The Wildcats shot 62 per
cent from the field in the first half
on their way to a 44-24 halftime
lead.
Stanford's ballhandling trou
bles continued throughout the
first half — the Cardinal turned
the ball over 15 times. The
Wildcats scored 15 points directly
from turnovers and had eight
more fast-break points, while
Stanford tallied zero in each cate
gory.
"Our problem was that we had
too many turnovers that led to
open court baskets," Cardinal
Coach Mike Montgomery said
after the game. "Arizona was ex
tremely aggressive, and that led
to a lot of buckets we couldn't
(afford to) give up."
In the first half alone Arizona
had five slam dunks, all of which
were parked with authority. For
ward Anthony Cook benefited
most from the transition game,
scoring 16 points on the evening.
Sean Elliott and Tom Tolbert
were the mainstays of the half

court offense, scoring 19 and 14
points, respectively.
All in all, Stanford had the mis
fortune of running into a loaded
tank that was running on all
cylinders.
"It certainly was our best de
fensive effort from wire to wire,"
Olson said."We wanted to make
it a full court game because they
execute well in the half-court of
fense. We got good solid play
from everyone."
After Arizona jumped out to
the 8-0 lead, the Cardinal
swallowed hard and almost made
it a ballgame. With the Wildcats
ahead 14-6, Taylor hit two free
throws after being fouled by
Arizona's Steve Kerr. Stanford
center Greg Butler followed that
with a three-point play, and the
lead was cut to 14-11.
The Wildcats practically
begged Stanford to get back in
the game by missing their next
shot and leaving Butler open for a
short jump shot. But Butler's at
tempt wouldn't fall, and Arizona
dashed off on a fast break.
The break didn't end at the
hoop, but rather 20 feet away
where Kerr launched a 3-point
shot that made the twine sing.
The Cardinal momentum had
stopped, and Stanford had only
one other good chance to get any
closer.
"A lot of their offense is pred
icated on 3-point shots," Stanford
forward Bryan McSweeney said.
"When someone drives the
middle they know they can find
someone out there on the
perimeter."
Much of Arizona's offense is
also predicated around the gifted
Elliott. The 6-foot-8 junior can
score from long range and short
range. He can beat you with no
dribble, one dribble or several.
One Tuscon local called Elliott a
cobra — "you know he's going to
strike, but you don't know
when."
"He's quick, and he's such a
fluid player," said McSweeney,
who guarded Elliott for most of
the contest. "He's a good guy.
He's not someone who comes out
and talks 8.5."
A few minutes into the second
half Elliott put the Cardinal to
rest for good. Arizona led 46-26,
