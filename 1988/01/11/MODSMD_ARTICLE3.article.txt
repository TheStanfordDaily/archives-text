# Thomas regains U.S. skating title
## Junior seeks gold medal in Calgary 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff With wire reports 
Stanford junior Debi Thomas
capped a spectacular comeback
Saturday night by winning the
U.S. Figure Skating Champion
ship in Denver, Colo.
The 20-year-old Thomas, a San
Jose resident who is temporarily
stopped out of Stanford, was the
1986 U.S. and world champion.
But last year she was hindered by
foot injuries and inconsistent per
formances and lost both crowns.
In addition, the pressure of
trying to keep up academically
and remain in top form became
too much for Thomas. So, when
the rink she trained at in Red
wood City closed down, Thomas
decided to transfer to the Univer
sity of Colorado at Boulder until
after the Olympics and the 1988
world championships.
Saturday night, though,
Thomas put all her troubles be
hind her. With victories in both
the compulsories and the short
program Thomas didn't need to
win the long program to win the
competition.
Nevertheless, she did win, and
in grand fashion. Thomas finished
first with all nine judges in the
long program to win the title.
The brighest moment in her
program came in the opening 22
seconds. It was at that point
Thomas headed for the end of the
rink and launched into a triple toe
loop-triple toe loop combination.

When she landed perfectly
after the second jump Thomas'
face broke into a big smile. It was
the smile of a woman who was
well aware she was about to win a
national title.
"My main goal was to give
them an amazing performance
and get the judges thinking, 'She
has a chance for the gold medal in
the Olympics,' " Thomas said.
Thomas landed nearly every
jump perfectly and seemed about
ready to peak just in time for next
month's Olympics in Calgary,
Canada.
"I think I can be a lot better. I
wouldn't want my best one to be
here. I want to build up for the
Olympics," she said.
"I told her these were our last
nationals together," Alex
McGowan, Thomas' coach, said
after his student won the
freestyle. "I said, 'I know you can
do this. Go out and be a tigress
and make it the best you've ever
done.' "
It wasn't quite that, but
Thomas was satisfied.
"I worked hard for this year,"
she said. "I think it's going well."
Defending champion Jill Tren
ary, 19, of Colorado Springs,
Colo., moved from third to
second place with a strong free
skating performance. Caryn
Kadavy, also of Colorado Springs
and, along with Trenary, coached
by Carlo Fassi — who developed
Olympic champions Peggy
Fleming and Dorothy Hamill —
slipped to third.
