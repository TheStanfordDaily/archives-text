# Stingy defense, fans spur 'Cats

TUSCON — Imagine a man with heart trouble
being forced to take a roller coaster ride. I his is cer
tainly not advisable.
And yet Saturday evening the Stanford Cardinal
faced a similar situation.
The Stanford team had been plagued by foul
trouble and multiple turnovers in Thursday's 104-
80 loss to Arizona State, and now Saturday the Car
dinal was doomed to face two things that produce
both of those problems: a pressure defense and an
ear-shattering sell-out crowd at Arizona's McKale
Center.
Sure enough, Howard Wright picked up three
early fouls, and Stanford threw the ball away on
three of its first four possessions. Arizona parlayed
the Cardinal miscues into an 8-0 lead, a 44-24
halftiine margin and finally a 90-65 victory.
The aggressive Wildcat defense and the dealening
roar of the 13,241 Arizona fans made McKale Cen
ter an unenjoyable place for the visitors, although
Stanford did seem to wake up from its nightmare
and play a respectable second half.
"The defense they play is a deny defense," Cardi
nal forward Bryan McSweeney said. "I think we
tightened up a little at the start."
The Arizona players came out like gangbusters
and overplayed every Cardinal passing lane. This
type of defense is susceptible to being burned, but
the smothering crowd noise had the Stanford
players thinking of survival rather than burning.
"We weren't as aggressive as we needed to be in
the opening stage of the game," Stanford guard
Todd Lichti said. "Indiana did the same thing to us
(overplaying), and we had problems with them early
too."
In those opening stages the Stanford offense
passed the ball around the perimeter and used up
much of the 45-second clock. But then when the
clock was running out. the Cardinal players got ner
vous.
"We didn't make good selections on passes,"
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said. "We were
panicky for a while and then got a little errant."
Meanwhile, the referees' calls seemed to be
favoring the Wildcats. Both Lichti and Wright were
called for charging in the first six minutes on plays
that could have gone either way. But the approving
roars of over 13,000 fans drowned out the com
plaints of the dozen Cardinal players.
"1 think the crowds are one of the biggest factors
on how referees will favor a home team," Cardinal
guard Terry Taylor said. "Any team with great
crowds gets all the calls. I think it has a lot to do with
how officials think. They don't like being booed —
they'd rather have everyone loving them."
With Arizona ahead by 20 points for most of the
second half, the crowd quieted, and Stanford
calmed down. The Cardinal played the No. 3 team
in the land basket for basket until the last few
minutes of garbage time.
"I think we just pushed the ball upcourt more (in
the second half)," Lichti said. "I think it took the
half court pressure off."
