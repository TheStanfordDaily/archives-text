# No. 11 Cardinal overwhelms Arizona, ASU
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
"Like I've said before, I consider us
the underdogs in the Pac-10." If Stan
ford sophomore guard Jennifer Azzi is
right, a lot of Pacific 10 Conference
teams are in for a big surprise.
Picked to finish third in the league by
a preseason coaches poll, the No. 11
Cardinal women's basketball team has
rolled out to a 13-0 record overall and
a 2-0 mark in the first week of Pac-10
play with easy wins over Arizona and
Arizona State. Stanford downed the
Wildcats 101-71 Friday night and
defeated the Sun Devils 84-66 Satur
day.
Contrary to what the scores reflect,
Arizona was the tougher of the Cardi
nal's opponents. Behind the efforts of
senior center Dana Patterson, who
earned a double-double with a game
high 28 points and 13 rebounds, the
Wildcats kept the Cardinal alert and
playing well in what could have been
an all-out rout.
"They went into Patterson all night,
and we needed to do a better job on
her," Stanford Coach Tara VanDer
veer said. "She's a really good player,
really quick. If they had some
perimeter people to really support her,
we would have been in trouble."
The outside shot was one of the Car
dinal's biggest allies, thanks to the out
standing play of Azzi. The sophomore
shot 3-for-6 from three-point range en
route to a 19-point and 11-assist
double-double.
"She hit good three-point shots; I
thought she played under control, and
defensively she played pretty well,"
VanDerveer said. "That's what we ex
pect her to do, so I'm not surprised. I
think she can do that day in and day
out."
The freshmen starters excelled as
well. Point guard Sonja Henning
amassed an impressive 16 points, seven
assists and four rebounds, while for
ward Trisha Stevens, making her first
collegiate start, scored 10 from inside.
Coupled with a 13-point, seven
rebound outing by sophomore forward
Katy Steding, one of the tallest three
point shooters in women's basketball,
and the strong off-the-bench perform
ance of sophomore guard Stacy Parson,
the Cardinal reached the 100-point
mark well before the final buzzer.
"I liked the flurry at the end," Van-

Derveer said. "I liked (guard) Charli
(Turner), (forward) Evon (Asforis)
and Stacy (Parson). I thought people
stayed with it and didn't make it
boring."
"I think everybody played pretty
well," Azzi said. "It wasn't like a one
person game. It was split between all of
us, and when the subs came in they
played really well, too."
"I think it was a really fun game,"
Stevens said. "When we're having fun
we do a lot better."
Contributing to the players' enjoy
ment was the enthusiasm of the record
crowd of 1025 spectators at Maples
Pavilion. "That (the crowd support)
was the best part and the Band was
great," Stevens added.
The crowd was smaller the next
night, but that didn't stop the Cardinal
from putting on a great show against
the scrappy Sun Devils. On several oc
casions the Stanford squad outraced
Arizona State from coast to coast,
thanks in part to the five steals of Azzi
and three Steding steals that often
seemed more like football intercep
tions.
But the night belonged to Henning.
The 5-foot-8 freshman dished out
seven assists and a game-high 20
points, almost all from within seven
feet.
"I have to give a lot of credit to my
teammates for that, especially Jennifer
Azzi," Henning said of her career-high
scoring performance. "She gave me
good passes, and the whole team
played really well."
"The posters Katy Steding and
(center) Jill Yanke got the rebounds
fast enough for us to run our break. We
played good defense, and that made
the difference."
Yanke, who was held to just seven
points and one rebound by the
Wildcats' wily center Patterson the
night before, tallied an improved 10
points and three rebounds, while
Steding had another fine game with 12
points and a game-high-tying eight
rebounds.
, Freshman forward Celeste Lavoie,
however, proved to be the Cardinal's
chairman of the boards, grabbing eight
rebounds in just 12 minutes before a
sprained ankle forced her out of the
game. "She'll probably be out for two
weeks, and that will hurt us a lot be
cause we really needed her against
Washington," VanDerveer said.

"That means that someone else will
have to pick up the slack, probably
Evon (Asforis)," VanDerveer contin
ued. "She's been playing really well
and working really hard. She'll do a
good job. I have a lot of confidence in
how well she'll play."
The bench has generally been very
good for the Cardinal, as Asforis' per
formance clearly attests. Senior for
ward Kami Anderson also came off the
bench to make a strong impact with
eight points, while junior guard Emily
Wagner exploded on the scene with
two quick buckets within 90 seconds.
"I was really excited to go into the
game," Wagner said, "but you also
have to concentrate on taking good
shots and making good passes."
The junior, who redshirted last year
due to a knee injury, may very well be
the next player to join the Stanford
three-point bomb squad. Sinking both
of her shots from 19 feet out, Wagner
is practicing field goals but doesn't
make them the sole object of her of
fense.
"I'm definitely working on it, but
you don't want to become so con
cerned with the line that you don't
shoot," she said. "Sometimes you get
so worried about a three-point shot
that you miss the basket."
That problem plagued the Cardinal's
shooting Saturday, as a squad that
overall went 34-for-72 from the floor
only made three of 15 shots from be
hind the line. Arizona State avoided
this dilemma by not attempting a single
three-pointer.
The Sun Devils' made up for the
perimeter weakness by exploiting Stan
ford inside. "Arizona State has some
really good drivers and penetrated to
the basket well," Wagner said. "No
one is over six feet tall, really, so we
should have gotten the ball inside a
little more.
"I thought we played really well in
the first half, but they really took away
our running game in the second half."
VanDerveer echoed her player's
sentiments. "Defensively, we just got
driven on over and over, and it was real
disappointing. Arizona State is not a
real strong team right now, and we
needed to play better defense and we
didn't."
This perceived lack hardly kept the
Cardinal from overshadowing the out-

recruits.
classed Sun Devils. Stanford
enjoyed a comfortable 49-30 lead
at the half, and each starter spent
a good portion of the second half
resting on the bench. In addition,
the Cardinal held Arizona State's
star forwards Carolyn DeHoff

and Shamona Mosley to just 12
points each, while center Stepha
nie Osburn was only allowed
seven points.
Though clearly off to a fast
start in Pac-10 play, this
weekend's contests may not be a
valid indicator of future league
performance. "I don't think that
was the competition that the rest
of the Pac-10 is going to be like,"
Azzi admitted.

"Like I've said before, I consider us
the underdogs in the Pac-10." If Stan
ford sophomore guard Jennifer Azzi is
right, a lot of Pacific 10 Conference
teams are in for a big surprise.
Picked to finish third in the league by
a preseason coaches poll, the No. 11
Cardinal women's basketball team has
rolled out to a 13-0 record overall and
a 2-0 mark in the first week of Pac-10
play with easy wins over Arizona and
Arizona State. Stanford downed the
Wildcats 101-71 Friday night and
defeated the Sun Devils 84-66 Satur
day.
Contrary to what the scores reflect,
Arizona was the tougher of the Cardi
nal's opponents. Behind the efforts of
senior center Dana Patterson, who
earned a double-double with a game
high 28 points and 13 rebounds, the
Wildcats kept the Cardinal alert and
playing well in what could have been
an all-out rout.
"They went into Patterson all night,
and we needed to do a better job on
her," Stanford Coach Tara VanDer
veer said. "She's a really good player,
really quick. If they had some
perimeter people to really support her,
we would have been in trouble."
The outside shot was one of the Car
dinal's biggest allies, thanks to the out
standing play of Azzi. The sophomore
shot 3-for-6 from three-point range en
route to a 19-point and 11-assist
double-double.
"She hit good three-point shots; I
thought she played under control, and
defensively she played pretty well,"
VanDerveer said. "That's what we ex
pect her to do, so I'm not surprised. I
think she can do that day in and day
out."
The freshmen starters excelled as
well. Point guard Sonja Henning
amassed an impressive 16 points, seven
assists and four rebounds, while for
ward Trisha Stevens, making her first
collegiate start, scored 10 from inside.
Coupled with a 13-point, seven
rebound outing by sophomore forward
Katy Steding, one of the tallest three
point shooters in women's basketball,
and the strong off-the-bench perform
ance of sophomore guard Stacy Parson,
the Cardinal reached the 100-point
mark well before the final buzzer.
"I liked the flurry at the end," Van-

Derveer said. "I liked (guard) Charli
(Turner), (forward) Evon (Asforis)
and Stacy (Parson). I thought people
stayed with it and didn't make it
boring."
"I think everybody played pretty
well," Azzi said. "It wasn't like a one
person game. It was split between all of
us, and when the subs came in they
played really well, too."
"I think it was a really fun game,"
Stevens said. "When we're having fun
we do a lot better."
Contributing to the players' enjoy
ment was the enthusiasm of the record
crowd of 1025 spectators at Maples
Pavilion. "That (the crowd support)
was the best part and the Band was
great," Stevens added.
The crowd was smaller the next
night, but that didn't stop the Cardinal
from putting on a great show against
the scrappy Sun Devils. On several oc
casions the Stanford squad outraced
Arizona State from coast to coast,
thanks in part to the five steals of Azzi
and three Steding steals that often
seemed more like football intercep
tions.
But the night belonged to Henning.
The 5-foot-8 freshman dished out
seven assists and a game-high 20
points, almost all from within seven
feet.
"I have to give a lot of credit to my
teammates for that, especially Jennifer
Azzi," Henning said of her career-high
scoring performance. "She gave me
good passes, and the whole team
played really well."
"The posters Katy Steding and
(center) Jill Yanke got the rebounds
fast enough for us to run our break. We
played good defense, and that made
the difference."
Yanke, who was held to just seven
points and one rebound by the
Wildcats' wily center Patterson the
night before, tallied an improved 10
points and three rebounds, while
Steding had another fine game with 12
points and a game-high-tying eight
rebounds.
, Freshman forward Celeste Lavoie,
however, proved to be the Cardinal's
chairman of the boards, grabbing eight
rebounds in just 12 minutes before a
sprained ankle forced her out of the
game. "She'll probably be out for two
weeks, and that will hurt us a lot be
cause we really needed her against
Washington," VanDerveer said.

"That means that someone else will
have to pick up the slack, probably
Evon (Asforis)," VanDerveer contin
ued. "She's been playing really well
and working really hard. She'll do a
good job. I have a lot of confidence in
how well she'll play."
The bench has generally been very
good for the Cardinal, as Asforis' per
formance clearly attests. Senior for
ward Kami Anderson also came off the
bench to make a strong impact with
eight points, while junior guard Emily
Wagner exploded on the scene with
two quick buckets within 90 seconds.
"I was really excited to go into the
game," Wagner said, "but you also
have to concentrate on taking good
shots and making good passes."
The junior, who redshirted last year
due to a knee injury, may very well be
the next player to join the Stanford
three-point bomb squad. Sinking both
of her shots from 19 feet out, Wagner
is practicing field goals but doesn't
make them the sole object of her of
fense.
"I'm definitely working on it, but
you don't want to become so con
cerned with the line that you don't
shoot," she said. "Sometimes you get
so worried about a three-point shot
that you miss the basket."
That problem plagued the Cardinal's
shooting Saturday, as a squad that
overall went 34-for-72 from the floor
only made three of 15 shots from be
hind the line. Arizona State avoided
this dilemma by not attempting a single
three-pointer.
The Sun Devils' made up for the
perimeter weakness by exploiting Stan
ford inside. "Arizona State has some
really good drivers and penetrated to
the basket well," Wagner said. "No
one is over six feet tall, really, so we
should have gotten the ball inside a
little more.
"I thought we played really well in
the first half, but they really took away
our running game in the second half."
VanDerveer echoed her player's
sentiments. "Defensively, we just got
driven on over and over, and it was real
disappointing. Arizona State is not a
real strong team right now, and we
needed to play better defense and we
didn't."
This perceived lack hardly kept the
Cardinal from overshadowing the out-

enjoyed a comfortable 49-30 lead
at the half, and each starter spent
a good portion of the second half
resting on the bench. In addition,
the Cardinal held Arizona State's
star forwards Carolyn DeHoff

and Shamona Mosley to just 12
points each, while center Stepha
