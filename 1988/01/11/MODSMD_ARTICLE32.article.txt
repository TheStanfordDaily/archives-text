# Stanford swims past outmatched Wildcats
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Taking the first step down the road
toward its fourth consecutive NCAA
crown, the Stanford men's swimming team
won its first post-Christmas meet Friday.
Defeating Arizona 73-60 in its premier
Pacific 10 Conference contest of the year,
the Cardinal, ranked second nationally,
raised its overall record to 2-1 on the
season. Stanford suffered a narrow 59-54
defeat to Texas Dec. 5.
Behind solid swims by senior back
stroker Sean Murphy, junior back
stroker/freestyler/hreaststroker Jay Mor
tenson, senior Matt Nance (individual
medley), and freshman breaststroker Matt
Rodgers, the squad was able to overpower
a talented but not deep Wildcat team.
"We raced pretty well and had some
good swims," Stanford Coach Skip Kenney
said.
No swimmer's times were fast enough to
qualify for the NCAAs, but since it is still
early in the season, the squad is confident
times will improve as the Cardinal gets
more racing experience.
"Times were about what we expected,"
Mortenson said. "We were fairly rusty on
starts and turns, but hopefully it won't take
too long until we sharpen up."
Although this was Stanford's first com
petition since the Texas meet, Asst. Coach
Ted Knapp said he expected faster times
from his swimmers and was disappointed in
the Cardinal's performance.
"I look at this meet as a loss because we
didn't really swim any better than we did
against Texas," Knapp said. "We didn't
make the type of progress we need to jus
tify our No. 2 standing."
While times might not have been of
championship caliber, the Cardinal swam

fast enough to win a number of races and
defeat some of the nation's fastest swim
mers. Murphy was victorious in both the
100-yard back and the 200 back events,
while Rodgers was also a double winner, in
the the 100 and 200 breaststroke races.
Murphy outdistanced Scott Johnson, who
was ranked first nationally in both back
events, and Rodgers defeated Matt
Rankin, holder of the season's quickest
200 breast time.
Sophomore Byron Burson was the win
ner of the 100 freestyle event, and Doug
Lillydahl took ;r,.z sprint race, the 50 free.
Stanford divers were also successful, with
freshman Mike Burton winning the one
meter event and taking third in the three
meter competition, and Matt Frawley
placing second in both events.
Stanford also swept two races, the 100
back and the 50 free. Mortenson took
second and Rick Gould third behind
Murphy in the back event, while Jeff Garr
and J.B. Barr followed Lillydahl in the
sprint competition.
While Murphy and Rodgers were able to
keep pace with two of the national-caliber
Wildcat swimmers, other Cardinal swim
mers were not so successful. In a close race
Rankin outdistanced Nance in the 400 1M
in the final lap, and Lunn Lestina could not
keep up with the year's fastest distance
freestyler, Jeff Utsch, in the 500 and 1000
events.
"Matt Rankin was very impressive,"
Mortenson said. "Especially considereing
he came back and swam so many races so
well."
"1 feel real good about where we are
concerning our training and attitude,"
Kenney said. "We have taken a positive
step forward, and now it is just a matter of
keeping on track."
