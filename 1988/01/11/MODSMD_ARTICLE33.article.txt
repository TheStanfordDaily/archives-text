# Card gymnasts grab Spartan Open crown
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Performing this weekend at the San Jose
State Spartan Open, the Stanford men's
gymnastics team took its first steps in the
direction of its lofty hut attainable goal of
an NCAA Championship.
Called "the best team Stanford's ever
had" by Coach Sadao Hamada, the squad
entered the weekend's competition looking
not only to defeat its opponents, California
and SJSU, but also to experiment and
begin the process of becoming "meet
tough."
Stanford did take home the team title,
handily outscoring Cal 269.35 to 261.35.
The host Spartans took third at 259.10. In
addition, the Cardinal's experimentation
with more difficult routines than it would
attempt in more competitive meets
brought positive results.
"This was exactly what I wanted to see,"
Hamada said. "I'm happy to say that 1 had
a lot of good surprises and that I had no
bad surprises."
Stanford's top all-around gymnast at Fri
day night's team competiton was sopho
more Conrad Voorsanger, who scored
53.70. Classmate Charles Loop and senior

Randy Besosa were close behind with
scores of 53.50 and 53.40, respectively.
These statistics are deceiving because of
the approach the Cardinal gymnasts took
to the meet. Besosa, for example, per
formed some of the competition's most dif
ficult routines, looking not so much for
high scores as to practice the more complex
tricks under meet conditions. Besosa red
shirted last year and the Open was his first
collegiate meet since 1986.
Seniors Mike Matzek and Chuck
Gerardo, last season's Stanford standouts,
did not compete in all six events Friday
night. In Saturday night's individual event
finals, Gerardo took first in the pommel
horse and second in the rings, with scores
of 9.7 and 9.5. Gerardo recorded a 9.8 on
the horse Friday night in an event which he
led the nation in for much of the 1987
season.
Before the competition, Hamada said
that each Cardinal gymnast had clearly im
proved over the off-season. That conten
tion was borne out by the weekend's per
formances. Hamada pointed to the changes
he saw in the work of both Voorsanger and
Loop as typical of the squad's overall prog-

ress.
Loop gave indication of good
things to come when he opened

up the high bar competition Fri
day with a personal best 9.65.
Voorsanger, according to
Hamada, has shown marked im
provement in his strength.
Voorsanger entered the college
scene last winter as a graceful
performer who ranked among the
nation's finest freshmen.
