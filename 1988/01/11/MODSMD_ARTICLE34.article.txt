# Card women crush Arizona
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Under a forboding gray sky Friday, the Stanford
women's swimming team opened its season in ear
nest, painting a gloomy picture for visiting Arizona.
While no rain fell from the sky over deGuerre Pool,
Stanford stormed all over the Wildcats, winning the
dual meet by a 91-40 score.
The Cardinal, which has finished in the top three
at the NCAA Championships in each of the last 11
years, looked well-prepared to reach that plateau
again this year in running its dual meet record to 2-0
(the Cardinal destroyed Pacific 68-27 the first week
of December).
"It was good to get the season started with a good
win," junior Michelle Donahue said. Donahue
could have been speaking individually as well, as she
won the 100-yard backstroke to open the meet.
Donahue qualified for the NCAAs with a time of
57.66, leading a Stanford sweep in the process. The
Cardinal also swept the second event, the 100
breaststroke, with junior Susan Lenth taking top
honors.
The Stanford women were very fast all day; they
won 12 of 13 races. Jenna Johnson and Stacy Shupe
also qualified for the NCAAs.
"It was a lot of fun to finally swim a meet after
Christmas training," Donahue said, adding that
many of the swimmers were trying to use the meet
to hit the NCAA qualifying cutoffs. According to a
new rule implemented this year, a swimmer needs
only to qualify in one event, after which she is eligi
ble for three events at the NCAAs.
Now that Donahue has qualified in one event, she
need not qualify in the other events she swims. So a
swimmer like junior Johnson can go all out in the
100 butterfly, the third event in a dual-meet
schedule, without worrying about saving enough
speed later in the day to hit a qualifying standard in
the 50 or 100 freestyle.
Johnson recorded her qualifying time in the 100
fly, an event she won at NCAAs two years ago,
while senior Shupe posted her qualifying mark in
the 1650 freestyle.
In other events, Donahue added the 400 individ
ual medley title to her credit, while Lenth also
doubled by winning the 200 breast. Junior Aimee
Berzins was the third double winner for Stanford,
triumphing in both the 50 and 100 free.
Sophomores Lisa Gillespie and Susannah Miller
joined their teammates in the winner's circle by
taking the 500 free and the 200 back, respectively,
while junior Monica Nielebeck also won, in the 200
fly-
Adding insult to injury, Stanford took the 400
free relay as well, with Johnson, Gillespie, Berzins
and sophomore Laura McLean swimming away

from the Wildcats.
The diving competition smiled
on the Cardinal too, as junior
Amy Biehl and senior Leslie
Kleinheksel each took a second
and a third. Off the one-meter
board, Biehl took second and
Kleinheksel third, and their posi
tions were switched in the three
meter competition.
Donahue was impressed with
the competition. "I thought they
swam pretty well," she said.
"They're just not as deep as we

are."
Stanford again takes to
deGuerre Saturday at noon when
the San Jose State Spartans come
calling. The Cardinal then
ventures south the following
weekend, visiting Pacific-10 Con
ference powers UCLA and USC.
The Spartans look to be little
match for Stanford, but the Los
Angeles trip is a whole different
story. "They're pretty strong,"
Donahue said. "We can't take
them lightly."
Stanford then returns to the
Farm to host Arizona State Jan.
29, followed by a meet against
four-time defending national
champion Texas Feb. 6.
