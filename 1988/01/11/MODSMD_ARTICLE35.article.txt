# Redskins, Broncos advance in playoffs
## 
### 
One year and one strike later,
the NFL's Final Four looks aw
fully familiar.
The Denver Broncos against
the Cleveland Browns in the AFC
championship game for the
second straight season. The
Washington Redskins again
playing for the NFC title.
Only the wild-card Minnesota
Vikings are new to the playoffs,
filling in for the dethroned Super
Bowl champion New York
Giants.
Denver trounced Houston 34-
10 yesterday in the AFC semi
finals. Last year, the Broncos won
the AFC title by marching 97
yards to tie it, then won in
overtime at Cleveland. Next Sun
day, the teams meet at Denver.
Cleveland advanced to this
year's final by beating In
dianapolis 38-21 Saturday.
The Vikings continued their
upset surge by winning 36-24 at
San Francisco Saturday. Minne
sota won the NFC wild-card
playoff 44-10 at New Orleans last
week.
On Sunday, the Vikings will
play at Washington. The
Redskins stopped the Chicago
Bears 21-17 Sunday, bringing a
disappointing end to Walter
Payton's career.
Darrell Green's 52-yard punt
return for a touchdown broke a
third-quarter tie as Washington
won a playoff game at Chicago
for the second straight year.
The Broncos set up an AFC
title rematch behind John Elway's
two touchdown passes to
Clarence Kay and Houston's
mistakes.
The Oilers' problems began
early in the first quarter when
Mike Rozier fumbled away a
lateral at the Houston 1, setting
up a touchdown run by Denver's
Gene Lang.
Later, Houston's Warren
Moon was intercepted by Mark
Haynes in the end zone and by
Karl Mecklenburg at the Denver
10.
Washington quarterback Doug
Williams made the big plays as
the NFC East champions

overcame an early 14-0 deficit.
Williams passed for 207 yards
and converted seven of 14 third
down opportunities in 4-degree
temperatures. His 18-yard touch
down pass to Clint Didier in the
final minute of the first half made
it 14-14.
Green's punt return put the
Redskins ahead 21-14 3:40 into
the third quarter. The Pro Bowl
cornerback caught Tommy
Barnhardt's punt at his 48, raced
down the right sideline and
hurdled Cap Boso.
Payton and quarterback Jim
McMahon, making his first start
in a month because of a pulled
hamstring, did not move the
Bears in the second half.
McMahon completed 15 of 29
passes for 197 yards. He was
sacked five times, three by
Charles Mann, and was inter
cepted in the end zone by Barry
Wilburn.
Payton, the NFL's all-time
rushing leader with 16,726
lifetime yards, ran for 85. His
career ended on Chicago's final
play, when he caught a pass from
McMahon but was tackled one
yard short of a first down on
fourth-and-long.
Minnesota beat San Francisco
as Anthony Carter broke an NFL
playoff record by catching passes
for 227 yards. He also won the
duel against Jerry Rice, the 49ers'
heralded receiver. Carter broke
the postseason record of 198 re
ceiving yards set by Tom Fears of
the Los Angeles Rams in 1950.
Carter caught 10 passes against
San Francisco,
Carter caught only 38 passes all
season, but in his first two NFL
playoff games, he has 306 yards
on 16 receptions. He also
returned a punt 84 yards for a
touchdown in the Vikings' victory
over New Orleans.
Bernie Kosar threw three
touchdown passes and Earnest
Byner ran for 122 yards and
scored twice as Cleveland beat
the Colts. The host Browns had
lost to Indianapolis during the
season.
