# Grapplers shine at Chico
## 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
As any athlete knows, to compete with absolute
intensity in an event requires maximum energy out
put. It follows that to produce such effort more than
once in a short period of time would demand ex
ponentially more energy from the individual.
The members of the Stanford wrestling team
would have offered little argument to the above for
mula as they returned to campus Saturday night
after six matches that day at the Doc Petersen Open
Tounament, hosted by Chico State.
Senior 190-pounder Terry Mclntyre, who
finished fourth in his 34-man bracket after compil
ing a 4-2 record for the day, accurately summed up
the meet by saying, "It was a very long day."
Mclntyre was one of four Stanford grapplers to
finish in the tournament's top eight places. He
cruised through his opening matches with pins over
Oregon Tech and Cal State-Fullerton, and a 16-2
victory over Humboldt State. Mclntyre was finally
defeated in a difficult semifinal match over the
eventual 190-pound champion, Darryl Pope.
Pope graduated from Cal State-Bakersfield last
year after finishing second at the NCAA tourna
ment. He was named the outstanding wrestler of the

Doc Petersen tournament after winning the champi
onship.
Following the match with Pope, Mclntyre battled
his way through the consolation bracket, narrowly
defeating Southern Oregon's wrestler 4-3, and lost
in the consolation finals to the entry from Cal State-
Fullerton to take fourth place in the competition.
The other Cardinal wrestler who placed as well as
Mclntyre in the tournament was freshman Steve
Buddie, who competed in the 167-pound bracket.
Buddie's success in the early rounds was nearly as
complete as Mclntyre's as he beat wrestlers from
San Jose State 13-4, San Francisco State 9-1 and
Cal State-Bakersfield 14-1. Like Mclntyre, Buddie
ran into trouble in the semifinal round, losing a
close match to an entry from "Athletes in Action,"
by a score of 8-6.
Because the Doc Petersen is an open tournament,
wrestlers without a collegiate affiliation, such as
those in Athletes in Action, are allowed to compete.
Many club grapplers and independent athletes used
the meet as a forum to relive their college achieve
ments.
Buddie finished off the long day with a narrow
victory over a Pacific wrestler "by the hair of my
chinny-chin-chin," he said. He lost in the consola-
