## 
### Johnny Cuerva 
Stanford University Libraries recently ac
quired a large collection of books by Dante
Alighiere, the pre-Renaissance literary figure
most famous for writing "The Divine Com
edy."
The collection, the latest in a series of ac
quisitions by Stanford University Libraries,
consists of roughly 3000 volumes obtained
from a private collector in Italy.
The collection contains a large selection of
Dante's works. Many of the volumes include
commentaries on his work in addition to the
works themselves. Included in the collection
are nine rare editions of The Divine Comedy,
printed between 1477 and 1499.
According to Michael Ryan, curator of spe
cial collections, the library system had been
aware of the availability of the collection for
over two years. With the encouragement of
Italian Prof. John Freccero, a Dante scholar
and vice chairman of the French and Italian
Department, the University was convinced to
fund the purchase.
"The price was a bargain," Ryan said,
declining to reveal the actual price paid by the

University. He said the purchase was funded
with library endowments and general funds
from the Provost and the Dean of Humanities
and Science.
According to Ryan, the collection will be
useful for several purposes. It will help sup
port the recently established doctoral program
in Italian literature, provide material for the
Dante Institute — located at the Stanford
Humanities Center — and support more gen
eral work in the humanities.
Ryan noted that Stanford — led by an out
standing group of Dante scholars from the
French and Italian Department, including
Freccero, Assoc. Prof. Jeffrey Schnapp and
Asst. Prof Robert Harrison — is experiencing
a flowering of graduate studies in Italian
literature.
Freccero called the newly acquired collec
tion "a very considerable resource for the
western United States." He said it is valuable
not only for the rare editions of the Divine
Comedy but also for the commentaries that
accompany it.
The commentaries in the collection provide
a 700-year record of scholarship concerning

the important work.
Freccero said Dante's work is of immense
signicance to Western culture, noting that
Dante's writing provides better insight into
the Middle Ages than the work of any other
writer in the period.
"There is no Western Culture course con
ceivable without Dante. Skipping Dante is
like skipping the Middle Ages,"' he said.
Mary Jane Parrine, curator of Romance
languages for the University Libraries, said
the acquisition of the collection was a major
step in building the library's resources.
With the addition of the Dante collection,
Parrine said, the library is close to achieving
greatness as a research center in the
humanities.
In the past few years the library has ob
tained the Scofield collection of children's
literature, the Barchas collection of the his
tory of science, and the Baron collection of
Jewish studies.
The rarer books of the Dante collection will
be kept in the special collections room of
Green Library, and the remaining books will
be placed on the shelves.
