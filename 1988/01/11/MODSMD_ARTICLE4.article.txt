# BSU returns from Alabama trip

"Representatives of the South
are not representing the
majority," Black Student Union
Chair Bill King said last night
after 18 Stanford students
returned from rural Alabama
after spending a week there iden
tifying potential hut unregistered
voters.
In Alabama's Perry County,
the 65-percent black population
only receives 40 percent repre
sentation on the county commis
sion, according to King. Stanford
students, who returned to campus
last night, spent part of their 10-

day trip traveling door-to-door
trying to offset this discrepancy
by encouraging blacks to vote in
the upcoming local election for
the county.
"High-level officials are com
ing in for these local elections"
and are mobilizing the vote to
maintain the white power
structure that has traditionally
controlled these southern areas.
King said.
But the presence of California
college students was "very inspi
rational" to some southern blacks
who had been afraid to vote be
cause of FBI harassment and in
timidation in previous local elec
tions, King said.

Well above the national
average, voter turnout in Ala
bama usually ranges between 70
and 90 percent; voter apathy was
not the problem confronting the
Stanford students, King said. In
stead, the group's efforts were
spent "struggling to overcome
political forces" that keep many
blacks from voting.
King predicted that an increase
in black voter turnout in the
South could have a "huge im
pact" on "Super Tuesday"
(March 8), when southern state
primaries might make or break
presidential candidates' cam
paigns.
Sophomore Cheryl Taylor, one

trip participant, said that while
her group tried to educate the
southerners on civil-rights issues,
the students "were being ed
ucated more so than they (the Al
abama residents) were."
Taylor said she learned more
on the 10-day trip than she ever
could have in a political science
class."l had an incomplete educa
tion about civil rights . . . and
could not really learn without
speaking to people and seeing
conditions," she said.
King said the BSU-sponsored
trip received about $5000 in
funding from University trustees,
dorm funds and various Univer
sity departments.
