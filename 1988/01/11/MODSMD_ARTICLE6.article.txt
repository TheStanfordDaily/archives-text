# Era comes to close in Florence
## Stanford will not renew its lease on villa for overseas program 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
For a quarter of a century, students at
Stanford's overseas campus in Florence
have lived in"the villa," a 14th-century
hunting lodge located on the outskirts
of the city.
This spring quarter, though, will
mark the end of an era, as the program
prepares to relocate its offices and
classrooms to downtown Florence by
the fall of 1988.
Students will no longer live together,
but will be scattered throughout the city
and housed with Italian families, said
Thomas Heller, director of Overseas
Studies. Heller said the move was
precipitated by numerous factors.
Members of the Faculty Panel for
Mediterranean Studies, which oversees
the Florence program through Overseas
Studies, gradually came to the conclu
sion that the program's center should be
moved from its current site because of
its distance from the city of Florence,
according to Nancy Padgett, deputy di
rector of Overseas Studies.
The new center, and its central loca
tion, will alleviate students' "sense of
isolation from living in the suburbs"
and give them "greater opportunities to
improve their Italian and become in
volved in contemporary Italian life."
Heller said.

Although members of the faculty
panel had wanted to relocate the center
for quite some time, the move is only
taking place now because Stanford's
lease on the villa is almost up. "We
would have been forced to renegotiate
anyway," Heller said.
"We were having problems with the
landowner," Padgett added, explaining
that it would have cost substantially
more money to remain in the villa with
a new lease.
"For the amount (necessary to stay in
the villa) we can have a center that's
downtown," Padgett said.
The new center will be located on the
entire third floor of a historic building
that sits on the bank of the Arno and af
fords a "fabulous" view of both that
river and of the Uffizi, the main art
museum in Italy, on the opposite shore.
Heller said.
"I've seen the new center,and it's
beautiful with an extraordinary view,"
said Cnna Miccio, a senior who partici
pated in the Stanford-in-Florence pro
gram last year.
David Harden, the student represen
tative to the faculty panel and a senior
who studied at the villa last quarter,
said that the new center has "frescoed
ceilings and a hardwood floor. It cer
tainly won't detract from the appeal of
the program," he said, adding that
"they moved from a villa to a palazzo."

However, while most people agree
that the new center is both beautiful
and historically interesting, many stu
dents said they were sad to see Stan
ford's relationship severed with the villa
and its unique position in Florence.
"The villa was just this amazingly
beautiful place that I hate to see let go,"
said Joan Takenaka, a senior who lived
there last winter quarter. "The feel of
living there is unlike anywhere else,"
she said.
Juliana Prather, a senior who was
president of the students in the villa last
winter quarter, agreed. "The villa is
beautiful. It was a 14th-century hunting
building that was rebuilt every century
except this one," she said.
Prather explained that the vineyard
surrounded villa is still owned by the
Salviatinos, historically one of the most
powerful families in Italy. "You could
get mail there from anywhere in Italy by
just writing 'Villa Salviatino' " on the
envelope, she said.
However, both Prather and
Takenaka said that there were "good
and bad points" to moving the center.
"The bad point about the villa is that
it was pretty far out of tow n â€” almost a
half an hour by bus," Takenaka said. As
a result, "some people had a tendency
to miss out on living the Italian life."
