# Era comes to close in Florence
## Stanford will not renew its lease on villa for overseas program 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
For a quarter of a century, students at
Stanford's overseas campus in Florence
have lived in"the villa," a 14th-century
hunting lodge located on the outskirts
of the city.
This spring quarter, though, will
mark the end of an era, as the program
prepares to relocate its offices and
classrooms to downtown Florence by
the fall of 1988.
Students will no longer live together,
but will be scattered throughout the city
and housed with Italian families, said
Thomas Heller, director of Overseas
Studies. Heller said the move was
precipitated by numerous factors.
Members of the Faculty Panel for
Mediterranean Studies, which oversees
the Florence program through Overseas
Studies, gradually came to the conclu
sion that the program's center should be
moved from its current site because of
its distance from the city of Florence,
according to Nancy Padgett, deputy di
rector of Overseas Studies.
The new center, and its central loca
tion, will alleviate students' "sense of
isolation from living in the suburbs"
and give them "greater opportunities to
improve their Italian and become in
volved in contemporary Italian life."
Heller said.

Although members of the faculty
panel had wanted to relocate the center
for quite some time, the move is only
taking place now because Stanford's
lease on the villa is almost up. "We
would have been forced to renegotiate
anyway," Heller said.
"We were having problems with the
landowner," Padgett added, explaining
that it would have cost substantially
more money to remain in the villa with
a new lease.
"For the amount (necessary to stay in
the villa) we can have a center that's
downtown," Padgett said.
The new center will be located on the
entire third floor of a historic building
that sits on the bank of the Arno and af
fords a "fabulous" view of both that
river and of the Uffizi, the main art
museum in Italy, on the opposite shore.
Heller said.
"I've seen the new center,and it's
beautiful with an extraordinary view,"
said Cnna Miccio, a senior who partici
pated in the Stanford-in-Florence pro
gram last year.
David Harden, the student represen
tative to the faculty panel and a senior
who studied at the villa last quarter,
said that the new center has "frescoed
ceilings and a hardwood floor. It cer
tainly won't detract from the appeal of
the program," he said, adding that
"they moved from a villa to a palazzo."

However, while most people agree
that the new center is both beautiful
and historically interesting, many stu
dents said they were sad to see Stan
ford's relationship severed with the villa
and its unique position in Florence.
"The villa was just this amazingly
beautiful place that I hate to see let go,"
said Joan Takenaka, a senior who lived
there last winter quarter. "The feel of
living there is unlike anywhere else,"
she said.
Juliana Prather, a senior who was
president of the students in the villa last
winter quarter, agreed. "The villa is
beautiful. It was a 14th-century hunting
building that was rebuilt every century
except this one," she said.
Prather explained that the vineyard
surrounded villa is still owned by the
Salviatinos, historically one of the most
powerful families in Italy. "You could
get mail there from anywhere in Italy by
just writing 'Villa Salviatino' " on the
envelope, she said.
However, both Prather and
Takenaka said that there were "good
and bad points" to moving the center.
"The bad point about the villa is that
it was pretty far out of tow n â€” almost a
half an hour by bus," Takenaka said. As
a result, "some people had a tendency
to miss out on living the Italian life."
"Most Stanford students don't
appreciate the villa because it's
outside of the city," Prather said,
adding that there was "so much
damage" done to the building be
cause of "water balloon fights"
and other raucous behavior.
The villa, which was meant to
ease the transition to a new cul
ture by providing students with a
familiar living environment, could
sometimes seem like "an Ameri
can social club abroad" because
of its isolation, Prather said. In
the new center, the cliqueishness
of the villa would no longer be
possible, she said.
"1 think that (overseas) pro
grams ought to be more than par
ties, although some students may
have treated them that way,"
Heller said, adding that the isola
tion of the villa encouraged the
free-wheeling atmosphere for
which the program in Florence is
known.
Overseas programs "ought to
be a lot of fun and provide learn
ing experiences at the same
time," Heller said. "The decision
to go to the new center was that
we could provide a more interest
ing academic experience as well
as an enjoyable one."
Still, some students said they
feel that forcing students to live
with Italian families will dis
courage applicants to the pro
gram whose language skills aren't
so strong.
"A lot of people aren't up to
the ability where they could un

derstand a family," Prather said.
"I don't know if 1 would have
jumped (to apply to the program)
if I had to live in a family right
away," said Takenaka, who made
the transition to living in an
apartment after spending her first
quarter in the villa. "Besides
coming overseas and speaking
Italian all the time, living in a
family right away" might be over
whelming, she said.
"In a lot of ways the villa en
couraged people to go (to
Florence) who normally wouldn't
have," Takenaka said.
Prather agreed that leaving the
villa might discourage students
such as engineers who, because of
their course loads, did not have
the time to develop strong lan
guage skills.
Senior Rod Royse, who went to
Florence last winter quarter, said
he loved the villa but would still
apply to the program without it,
even though his language skills
are not that good.
"1 didn't apply on the basis of
the villa. Florence sold me on the
program," Royse said.
Despite the more demanding
environment that will be created
by the restructuring of the
Florence program, Heller said he
does not plan to change the lan
guage requirements for the pro
gram, which consist of a minimum
of two quarters of Italian.
"Although we're not increasing
the requirements of the program,
we're hoping that people's Italian
will be much better" because of
the change, Heller said, adding

that "you can't get through (the
program) with English anymore."
According to Prather, that at
least, is a welcome change.
Specifically, to improve stu
dents' language abilities, "more
classes should be offered in Ital
ian," she said, adding that overall
the program does not encourage
students to speak Italian enough.
Prather said the problem of
classes taught in Italian was, in
the minds of some, more impor
tant than the inconvenient loca
tion of the villa.
Claudia D'Andrea, a senior
who attended the program last
year, said she was "really furious"
that there weren't more classes
offered in Italian.
According to D'Andrea, offer
ing more classes in Italian would
not only discourage those stu
dents who were not very enthused
to learn the language from apply
ing for the program, but would
also help the more enthusiastic
students get more out of their
overseas experience.
Padgett, however, said that
Overseas Studies has no immedi
ate plans to offer classes in Italian
because students are usually not
ready for total immersion in the
language when they first arrive in
Florence.
"The number of classes we can
offer (in Italian) will depend upon
how much Italian students are
willing to take" before they
arrive, Padgett said. If Overseas
Studies finds that students begin
to speak better Italian as a result
of living in families, they "will

modify the program to fit the
ability of the students," she said.
Heller said that he did not ex
pect the number of applicants to
drop as a result of the move from
the villa or the inciease in empha
sis on language ability. "We want
to continue the tradition of
having a large number of Stan
ford students attending the pro
gram," he said.
Yet while the villa had the
capacity to house approximately
60 students, the program hopes to
find "places for 40-50 students"
in Italian households, he said.
However, Miccio said that
families in Florence often take on
students for purely "monetary
reasons."
"The Florentine people take
people in more as boarders than
family members," Miccio said. "I
think the students (in coming
years) will feel very displaced."
According to Prather, placing
so many students in families is an
ambitious goal. "When they still
had the villa, [the directors] al
ways had the problem of finding
good families," and not just boar
ders, for the few students who
decided to move out of the villa,
she said.
While most students said they
believe that moving the center
would eventually mean a positive
change for the program, many
also expressed disappointment
with the way Overseas Studies
decided to move out of the villa.
"[Overseas Studies] wasn't
very flexible about what the stu

dents had to say about the move,"
according to Royse. "The deci
sion was made on a very adminis
trative level."
"In one sense [the decision]
was bungled in that the whole
plan was not really articulated to
the students," Miccio said. Ad
ministration in Florence, many of
whom have been with Stanford
since the founding of the pro
gram, also seemed to be against
the move, she added.
"There's been some resent
ment from the staff (at the villa)
and confusion from the students"
about the new center, Prather
said. Overseas Studies didn't ask
for much input from students or
faculty in Florence on the deci
sion, she said.
"I think the greatest problem is

that Stanford decided from Palo
Alto and not Italy (which) did not
make for a smooth transition in
retaining what had been estab
lished in Florence over the past
20 years," Prather said, adding
that the Italian staff felt pressured
by time to make the necessary
changes.
According to Heller, who
taught at the villa four years ago,
the decision was carefully made
through a democratic process that
allowed for adequate student in
put over the past couple of years.
"We had a number of open
houses before the decision was
made and also met with students
at the villa," Heller said, adding
that there "certainly were stu
dents who felt [the move] was not
a good idea."

"In one sense [the decision]
was bungled in that the whole
plan was not really articulated to
the students," Miccio said. Ad
ministration in Florence, many of
whom have been with Stanford
since the founding of the pro
gram, also seemed to be against
the move, she added.
"There's been some resent
ment from the staff (at the villa)
and confusion from the students"
about the new center, Prather
said. Overseas Studies didn't ask
for much input from students or
faculty in Florence on the deci
sion, she said.
"I think the greatest problem is

that Stanford decided from Palo
Alto and not Italy (which) did not
make for a smooth transition in
retaining what had been estab
lished in Florence over the past
20 years," Prather said, adding
that the Italian staff felt pressured
by time to make the necessary
changes.
According to Heller, who
taught at the villa four years ago,
the decision was carefully made
through a democratic process that
allowed for adequate student in
put over the past couple of years.
"We had a number of open
houses before the decision was
made and also met with students
at the villa," Heller said, adding
that there "certainly were stu
dents who felt [the move] was not
a good idea."

The new center for the Stanford program in Florence (building at cen
ter) is a palazzo that sits on the bank of the Arno and faces the Uffizi
Gallery on the other side of the river.
For a quarter of a century, students at
Stanford's overseas campus in Florence
have lived in"the villa," a 14th-century
hunting lodge located on the outskirts
of the city.
This spring quarter, though, will
mark the end of an era, as the program
prepares to relocate its offices and
classrooms to downtown Florence by
the fall of 1988.
Students will no longer live together,
but will be scattered throughout the city
and housed with Italian families, said
Thomas Heller, director of Overseas
Studies. Heller said the move was
precipitated by numerous factors.
Members of the Faculty Panel for
Mediterranean Studies, which oversees
the Florence program through Overseas
Studies, gradually came to the conclu
sion that the program's center should be
moved from its current site because of
its distance from the city of Florence,
according to Nancy Padgett, deputy di
rector of Overseas Studies.
The new center, and its central loca
tion, will alleviate students' "sense of
isolation from living in the suburbs"
and give them "greater opportunities to
improve their Italian and become in
volved in contemporary Italian life."
Heller said.

Although members of the faculty
panel had wanted to relocate the center
for quite some time, the move is only
taking place now because Stanford's
lease on the villa is almost up. "We
would have been forced to renegotiate
anyway," Heller said.
"We were having problems with the
landowner," Padgett added, explaining
that it would have cost substantially
more money to remain in the villa with
a new lease.
"For the amount (necessary to stay in
the villa) we can have a center that's
downtown," Padgett said.
The new center will be located on the
entire third floor of a historic building
that sits on the bank of the Arno and af
fords a "fabulous" view of both that
river and of the Uffizi, the main art
museum in Italy, on the opposite shore.
Heller said.
"I've seen the new center,and it's
beautiful with an extraordinary view,"
said Cnna Miccio, a senior who partici
pated in the Stanford-in-Florence pro
gram last year.
David Harden, the student represen
tative to the faculty panel and a senior
who studied at the villa last quarter,
said that the new center has "frescoed
ceilings and a hardwood floor. It cer
tainly won't detract from the appeal of
the program," he said, adding that
"they moved from a villa to a palazzo."

However, while most people agree
that the new center is both beautiful
and historically interesting, many stu
dents said they were sad to see Stan
ford's relationship severed with the villa
and its unique position in Florence.
"The villa was just this amazingly
beautiful place that I hate to see let go,"
said Joan Takenaka, a senior who lived
there last winter quarter. "The feel of
living there is unlike anywhere else,"
she said.
Juliana Prather, a senior who was
president of the students in the villa last
winter quarter, agreed. "The villa is
beautiful. It was a 14th-century hunting
building that was rebuilt every century
except this one," she said.
Prather explained that the vineyard
surrounded villa is still owned by the
Salviatinos, historically one of the most
powerful families in Italy. "You could
get mail there from anywhere in Italy by
just writing 'Villa Salviatino' " on the
envelope, she said.
However, both Prather and
Takenaka said that there were "good
and bad points" to moving the center.
"The bad point about the villa is that
it was pretty far out of tow n â€” almost a
half an hour by bus," Takenaka said. As
a result, "some people had a tendency
to miss out on living the Italian life."
"Most Stanford students don't
appreciate the villa because it's
outside of the city," Prather said,
adding that there was "so much
damage" done to the building be
cause of "water balloon fights"
and other raucous behavior.
The villa, which was meant to
ease the transition to a new cul
ture by providing students with a
familiar living environment, could
sometimes seem like "an Ameri
can social club abroad" because
of its isolation, Prather said. In
the new center, the cliqueishness
of the villa would no longer be
possible, she said.
"1 think that (overseas) pro
grams ought to be more than par
ties, although some students may
have treated them that way,"
Heller said, adding that the isola
tion of the villa encouraged the
free-wheeling atmosphere for
which the program in Florence is
known.
Overseas programs "ought to
be a lot of fun and provide learn
ing experiences at the same
time," Heller said. "The decision
to go to the new center was that
we could provide a more interest
ing academic experience as well
as an enjoyable one."
Still, some students said they
feel that forcing students to live
with Italian families will dis
courage applicants to the pro
gram whose language skills aren't
so strong.
"A lot of people aren't up to
the ability where they could un

derstand a family," Prather said.
"I don't know if 1 would have
jumped (to apply to the program)
if I had to live in a family right
away," said Takenaka, who made
the transition to living in an
apartment after spending her first
quarter in the villa. "Besides
coming overseas and speaking
Italian all the time, living in a
family right away" might be over
whelming, she said.
"In a lot of ways the villa en
couraged people to go (to
Florence) who normally wouldn't
have," Takenaka said.
Prather agreed that leaving the
villa might discourage students
such as engineers who, because of
their course loads, did not have
the time to develop strong lan
guage skills.
Senior Rod Royse, who went to
Florence last winter quarter, said
he loved the villa but would still
apply to the program without it,
even though his language skills
are not that good.
"1 didn't apply on the basis of
the villa. Florence sold me on the
program," Royse said.
Despite the more demanding
environment that will be created
by the restructuring of the
Florence program, Heller said he
does not plan to change the lan
guage requirements for the pro
gram, which consist of a minimum
of two quarters of Italian.
"Although we're not increasing
the requirements of the program,
we're hoping that people's Italian
will be much better" because of
the change, Heller said, adding

that "you can't get through (the
program) with English anymore."
According to Prather, that at
least, is a welcome change.
Specifically, to improve stu
dents' language abilities, "more
classes should be offered in Ital
ian," she said, adding that overall
the program does not encourage
students to speak Italian enough.
Prather said the problem of
classes taught in Italian was, in
the minds of some, more impor
tant than the inconvenient loca
tion of the villa.
Claudia D'Andrea, a senior
who attended the program last
year, said she was "really furious"
that there weren't more classes
offered in Italian.
According to D'Andrea, offer
ing more classes in Italian would
not only discourage those stu
dents who were not very enthused
to learn the language from apply
ing for the program, but would
also help the more enthusiastic
students get more out of their
overseas experience.
Padgett, however, said that
Overseas Studies has no immedi
ate plans to offer classes in Italian
because students are usually not
ready for total immersion in the
language when they first arrive in
Florence.
"The number of classes we can
offer (in Italian) will depend upon
how much Italian students are
willing to take" before they
arrive, Padgett said. If Overseas
Studies finds that students begin
to speak better Italian as a result
of living in families, they "will

modify the program to fit the
ability of the students," she said.
Heller said that he did not ex
pect the number of applicants to
drop as a result of the move from
the villa or the inciease in empha
sis on language ability. "We want
to continue the tradition of
having a large number of Stan
ford students attending the pro
gram," he said.
Yet while the villa had the
capacity to house approximately
60 students, the program hopes to
find "places for 40-50 students"
in Italian households, he said.
However, Miccio said that
families in Florence often take on
students for purely "monetary
reasons."
"The Florentine people take
people in more as boarders than
family members," Miccio said. "I
think the students (in coming
years) will feel very displaced."
According to Prather, placing
so many students in families is an
ambitious goal. "When they still
had the villa, [the directors] al
ways had the problem of finding
good families," and not just boar
ders, for the few students who
decided to move out of the villa,
she said.
While most students said they
believe that moving the center
would eventually mean a positive
change for the program, many
also expressed disappointment
with the way Overseas Studies
decided to move out of the villa.
"[Overseas Studies] wasn't
very flexible about what the stu

dents had to say about the move,"
according to Royse. "The deci
sion was made on a very adminis
trative level."
"In one sense [the decision]
was bungled in that the whole
plan was not really articulated to

pect the number of applicants to
drop as a result of the move from
the villa or the inciease in empha
sis on language ability. "We want
to continue the tradition of
having a large number of Stan
ford students attending the pro
gram," he said.
Yet while the villa had the
capacity to house approximately
60 students, the program hopes to
find "places for 40-50 students"
in Italian households, he said.
However, Miccio said that
families in Florence often take on
students for purely "monetary
reasons."
"The Florentine people take
people in more as boarders than
family members," Miccio said. "I
think the students (in coming
years) will feel very displaced."
According to Prather, placing
so many students in families is an
ambitious goal. "When they still
had the villa, [the directors] al
ways had the problem of finding
good families," and not just boar
ders, for the few students who
decided to move out of the villa,
she said.
While most students said they
believe that moving the center
would eventually mean a positive
change for the program, many
also expressed disappointment
with the way Overseas Studies
decided to move out of the villa.
"[Overseas Studies] wasn't
very flexible about what the stu

dents had to say about the move,"
according to Royse. "The deci
sion was made on a very adminis
trative level."
"In one sense [the decision]
was bungled in that the whole
plan was not really articulated to
the students," Miccio said. Ad
ministration in Florence, many of
whom have been with Stanford
since the founding of the pro
gram, also seemed to be against
the move, she added.
"There's been some resent
ment from the staff (at the villa)
and confusion from the students"
about the new center, Prather
said. Overseas Studies didn't ask
for much input from students or
faculty in Florence on the deci
sion, she said.
"I think the greatest problem is

that Stanford decided from Palo
Alto and not Italy (which) did not
make for a smooth transition in
retaining what had been estab
lished in Florence over the past
20 years," Prather said, adding
that the Italian staff felt pressured
by time to make the necessary
changes.
According to Heller, who
taught at the villa four years ago,
the decision was carefully made
through a democratic process that
allowed for adequate student in
put over the past couple of years.
"We had a number of open
houses before the decision was
made and also met with students
at the villa," Heller said, adding
that there "certainly were stu
dents who felt [the move] was not
a good idea."

The new center for the Stanford program in Florence (building at cen
ter) is a palazzo that sits on the bank of the Arno and faces the Uffizi
Gallery on the other side of the river.
For a quarter of a century, students at
Stanford's overseas campus in Florence
have lived in"the villa," a 14th-century
hunting lodge located on the outskirts
of the city.
This spring quarter, though, will
mark the end of an era, as the program
prepares to relocate its offices and
classrooms to downtown Florence by
the fall of 1988.
Students will no longer live together,
but will be scattered throughout the city
and housed with Italian families, said
Thomas Heller, director of Overseas
Studies. Heller said the move was
precipitated by numerous factors.
Members of the Faculty Panel for
Mediterranean Studies, which oversees
the Florence program through Overseas
Studies, gradually came to the conclu
sion that the program's center should be
moved from its current site because of
its distance from the city of Florence,
according to Nancy Padgett, deputy di
rector of Overseas Studies.
The new center, and its central loca
tion, will alleviate students' "sense of
isolation from living in the suburbs"
and give them "greater opportunities to
improve their Italian and become in
volved in contemporary Italian life."
Heller said.

Although members of the faculty
panel had wanted to relocate the center
for quite some time, the move is only
taking place now because Stanford's
lease on the villa is almost up. "We
would have been forced to renegotiate
anyway," Heller said.
"We were having problems with the
landowner," Padgett added, explaining
that it would have cost substantially
more money to remain in the villa with
a new lease.
"For the amount (necessary to stay in
the villa) we can have a center that's
downtown," Padgett said.
The new center will be located on the
entire third floor of a historic building
that sits on the bank of the Arno and af
fords a "fabulous" view of both that
river and of the Uffizi, the main art
museum in Italy, on the opposite shore.
Heller said.
"I've seen the new center,and it's
beautiful with an extraordinary view,"
said Cnna Miccio, a senior who partici
pated in the Stanford-in-Florence pro
gram last year.
David Harden, the student represen
tative to the faculty panel and a senior
who studied at the villa last quarter,
said that the new center has "frescoed
ceilings and a hardwood floor. It cer
tainly won't detract from the appeal of
the program," he said, adding that
"they moved from a villa to a palazzo."

However, while most people agree
that the new center is both beautiful
and historically interesting, many stu
dents said they were sad to see Stan
ford's relationship severed with the villa
and its unique position in Florence.
"The villa was just this amazingly
beautiful place that I hate to see let go,"
said Joan Takenaka, a senior who lived
there last winter quarter. "The feel of
living there is unlike anywhere else,"
she said.
Juliana Prather, a senior who was
president of the students in the villa last
winter quarter, agreed. "The villa is
beautiful. It was a 14th-century hunting
building that was rebuilt every century
except this one," she said.
Prather explained that the vineyard
surrounded villa is still owned by the
Salviatinos, historically one of the most
powerful families in Italy. "You could
get mail there from anywhere in Italy by
just writing 'Villa Salviatino' " on the
envelope, she said.
However, both Prather and
Takenaka said that there were "good
and bad points" to moving the center.
"The bad point about the villa is that
it was pretty far out of tow n â€” almost a
half an hour by bus," Takenaka said. As
a result, "some people had a tendency
to miss out on living the Italian life."
"Most Stanford students don't
appreciate the villa because it's
outside of the city," Prather said,
adding that there was "so much
damage" done to the building be
cause of "water balloon fights"
and other raucous behavior.
The villa, which was meant to
ease the transition to a new cul
ture by providing students with a
familiar living environment, could
sometimes seem like "an Ameri
can social club abroad" because
of its isolation, Prather said. In
the new center, the cliqueishness
of the villa would no longer be
possible, she said.
"1 think that (overseas) pro
grams ought to be more than par
ties, although some students may
have treated them that way,"
Heller said, adding that the isola
tion of the villa encouraged the
free-wheeling atmosphere for
which the program in Florence is
known.
Overseas programs "ought to
be a lot of fun and provide learn
ing experiences at the same
time," Heller said. "The decision
to go to the new center was that
we could provide a more interest
ing academic experience as well
as an enjoyable one."
Still, some students said they
feel that forcing students to live
with Italian families will dis
courage applicants to the pro
gram whose language skills aren't
so strong.
"A lot of people aren't up to
the ability where they could un

derstand a family," Prather said.
"I don't know if 1 would have
jumped (to apply to the program)
if I had to live in a family right
away," said Takenaka, who made
the transition to living in an
apartment after spending her first
quarter in the villa. "Besides
coming overseas and speaking
Italian all the time, living in a
family right away" might be over
whelming, she said.
"In a lot of ways the villa en
couraged people to go (to
Florence) who normally wouldn't
have," Takenaka said.
Prather agreed that leaving the
villa might discourage students
such as engineers who, because of
their course loads, did not have
the time to develop strong lan
guage skills.
Senior Rod Royse, who went to
Florence last winter quarter, said
he loved the villa but would still
apply to the program without it,
even though his language skills
are not that good.
"1 didn't apply on the basis of
the villa. Florence sold me on the
program," Royse said.
Despite the more demanding
environment that will be created
by the restructuring of the
Florence program, Heller said he
does not plan to change the lan
guage requirements for the pro
gram, which consist of a minimum
of two quarters of Italian.
"Although we're not increasing
the requirements of the program,
we're hoping that people's Italian
will be much better" because of
the change, Heller said, adding

that "you can't get through (the
program) with English anymore."
According to Prather, that at
least, is a welcome change.
Specifically, to improve stu
dents' language abilities, "more
classes should be offered in Ital
ian," she said, adding that overall
the program does not encourage
students to speak Italian enough.
Prather said the problem of
classes taught in Italian was, in
the minds of some, more impor
tant than the inconvenient loca
tion of the villa.
Claudia D'Andrea, a senior
who attended the program last
year, said she was "really furious"
that there weren't more classes
offered in Italian.
According to D'Andrea, offer
ing more classes in Italian would
not only discourage those stu
dents who were not very enthused
to learn the language from apply
ing for the program, but would
also help the more enthusiastic
students get more out of their
overseas experience.
Padgett, however, said that
Overseas Studies has no immedi
ate plans to offer classes in Italian
because students are usually not
ready for total immersion in the
language when they first arrive in
Florence.
"The number of classes we can
offer (in Italian) will depend upon
how much Italian students are
willing to take" before they
arrive, Padgett said. If Overseas
Studies finds that students begin
to speak better Italian as a result
of living in families, they "will

modify the program to fit the
ability of the students," she said.
Heller said that he did not ex
pect the number of applicants to
drop as a result of the move from
the villa or the inciease in empha
sis on language ability. "We want
to continue the tradition of

ford students attending the pro
