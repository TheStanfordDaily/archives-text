Rabin thinks protests will continue
JERUSALEM — Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told
his fellow ministers at their weekly Cabinet meeting yesterday
evening that security officials had underestimated the severity of
disturbances in the occupied territories and that they should not
expect calm to return overnight.
"It requires patience, determination, and the use of force
within the limits of the law," Rabin declared in an Israel radio in
terview during a visit later yesterday to the Gaza Strip, which has
been the scene of the worst rioting.
He added, however, that restoration of order "is not going to
be achieved in one or two days."
Another Gazan was shot to death during a clash with security
forces yesterday evening, and a second died of wounds he
received in disturbances last month, a military spokesman con
firmed. The two brought to at least 29 the number of fatal Pales
tinian victims of army gunfire since the unrest began Dec. 9.
Seven of the deaths have occurred during an upsurge of the vi
olence in the last eight days, six of them in the Gaza Strip.
An army spokesman also reported "some people wounded" by
gunfire yesterday, but said he could not provide details. United
Nations officials in Gaza said that more than 30 people were
injured in at least four locations where the army opened fire.
Substantially more than 200 Palestinians have been wounded by
gunfire since the disturbances began last month.
Gorbachev calls for China summit
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has again pro
posed a summit meeting with China, calling it a "logical develop
ment" in the improving relations between the two commmunist
giants after three decades of strain.
In an interview with a Chinese weekly, Liaowang, carried yes
terday by the Soviet news agency Tass, Gorbachev repeated his
proposal for a meeting with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping,
which he first put forward Nov. 27. China rebuffed the offer,
saying obstacles in the Sino-Soviet relationship must first be
removed.
Gorbachev's new appeal to China comes after the Soviets indi
cated last week that they are ready to push for a withdrawal this
year of their troops from Afghanistan, one of the three obstacles
cited by China. The Soviets also have been diplomatically active
in Cambodia, where China has said domination by Soviet-backed
Vietnam has been the greatest block to improving Sino-Soviet
relations.
The interview in Liaowang, also released yesterday in China,
underlined Soviet eagerness to improve relations with the south
ern neighbor, which first soured in the 1950s in an ideological
dispute.
Gorbachev stressed that Moscow's relations with China should
not be affected by the improving Soviet-U.S. relationship. "One
cannot build today one's long-term policy at another's expense,"
he said. "It is necessary to look for balance of interests, not
against someone, but together with all."
Gulf diplomacy enters new round
TEHRAN, Iran — Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati yesterday told a special United Arab Emirates envoy
that "contrary to what some may think" Iran wants peace and co
operation with its Arab neighbors in the Gulf.
"We believe this is the only way for real stability, security and
quietude in the region," Tehran Radio quoted Velayati as telling
the Arab envoy, ambassador Saif Saeed.
The radio quoted Velayati as pledging Iran's "readiness to ex
ert all kinds of co-operation" toward this end and as expressing
optimism over the future of relations with the non-combatant
Persian Gulf states.
It said he was responding to a message from UAE minister of
State for Foreign Affairs Rashid Abdullah, emphasizing the need
to expand relations with Iran and "confront the increasing influ
ence of foreign powers" in the region.
The UAE envoy's mission is believed to be connected with a
Syrian drive to launch a direct peace dialogue between Iran and
the gulf's non-combatant Arab countries.
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Charaa, meanwhile, paid a
quick trip to Amman in what was seen as an attempt to enlist Jor
dan's assistance in convincing its Iraqi allies to join in a tacit de
escalation of gulf hostilities.
1987: a banner year for farmers
NEW ORLEANS, La. — U.S. farmers had record earnings
last year — nearly $58 billion — even though government spend
ing declined, the head of the nation's largest family farm organi
zation said yesterday.
"The trend (in government spending) is down, the projections
are down," said Dean Kleckner, president of the 3.6 million
member American Farm Bureau Federation, which opens its
69th annual meeting in New Orleans today.
Kleckner told reporters that 85 percent to 90 percent of the
nation's farmers have returned to profitability, a major improve
ment from the depths of the farm crisis two years ago when more
than half the nation's farms were in financial trouble. On the
other hand, he added, farm foreclosures and the exodus of farm
ers from agriculture will continue at high rates.
The $58 billion in earnings included about $22 billion in gov
ernment payments to farmers under the five-year 1985 Food
Protection Act, Kleckner said. That was down from about $26
billion in 1986, and subsidies are expected to drop to $19 billion
this year.
Most U.S. crops are not subsidized, however.
The 1985 act, Kleckner said, was designed to be "a transition
bill" to wean farmers of government-supported commodities
from subsidies, while giving them time to adjust.
Panama leader returns home
PANAMA CITY, Panama — Gen. Manuel Noriega returned
here yesterday after a one-day trip to the Dominican Republic
that had sparked joyful demonstrations at home by opponents
who thought the military strongman was not coming back.
Hours later, Noriega's Panama Defense Forces detained
Washington Post correspondent Julia Preston as she arrived at
the Pa ama City airport from Nicaragua and put her on a flight
bound for Miami.
The U.S. government has been pressuring Noriega to ease his
grip on power and hold free elections. Richard Armitage, assis
tant secretary of defense for international security, met with the
general here Dec. 30 to impress Washington's views upon him.
In the Dominican Republic, Noriega told the Listin Diario
newspaper that his unannounced trip was a ploy to see how the
Panamanian opposition and the United States would react.
"It was a trap I set to test their honesty," he was quoted as
saying.
"A rumor started that he wasn't coming back and it spread like
wildfire," said Mayin Correa, an opposition legislator.
