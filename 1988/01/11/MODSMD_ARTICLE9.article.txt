# Market chief backs findings

### 
WASHINGTON — As Wall
Street braced for what may he an
other difficult week, the chairman
of the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday endorsed a presidential
study group's conclusion that in
effect blames the exchange's best
customers for the October stock
market crash.
The exchange's John Phelan Jr.
said he agreed with the report's
view that 12 to 15 large institu
tional investors, by unloading bil
lions of dollars worth of securities
and futures within hours, were
"basically responsible" for the
collapse that wiped out $1 trillion
in stock value.
"I hope those investors . . .
have learned something about
their responsibilities to the 180
million Americans who are in
vested, directly or indirectly, in
the stock market," said Phelan in
his first such comments on the
role of large investors in the
crash.
The five-member Brady Com
mission concluded after 10 weeks
of study that a few of the largest

investors, such as pension funds
and mutual-fund managers, used
new computerized trading tech
niques that turned Oct. 19's sell
off into a rout that dropped the
Dow Jones industrial average 508
points.
Phelan also said he agreed with
the commission's view that there
is a need for a single regulatory
agency to oversee issues that span
the U.S. financial markets. He
said that he saw the need for a
review of rules concerning buying
on credit, or margin, improved
clearing procedures and a better
market information system.
But Phelan did not endorse the
panel's recommendation that the
exchanges or regulators put in
place additional "circuit
breakers" — such as temporary
trading halts or daily limits on
price swings — that would halt
activity when the markets over
heat.
Phelan said that the markets al
ready have provisions for tempo
rary halts, including the Chicago
commodity markets' price-swing

limits and the Big Board's system
that interrupts trading when there
is a huge imbalance of orders to
buy or sell stock. "1 think all of us
today, in some way or other, are
trying to put in some safety net,"
said Phelan, who was interviewed
on NBC's "Meet The Press."
Phelan's general endorsement
of the Brady Commission's rec
ommendations contrasted with
the view of a key congressional
committee chairman that the
proposals do not go far enough.
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, said
that the commission's report may
be criticized as "too mild," since
the market system already has
"circuit breakers," margin re
quirements and oversight
agencies.
The report "doesn't suggest
anything that should scare
anybody," said Dingell.
Dingell said in an interview
that while his committee has yet
to complete its investigation of
the crash, he believes there is

need for u closer look at raising
margin rules, the need for further
regulation and increasing capital
requirements for market makers,
brokers who specialize in trading
specific stocks. Legislators, he
said, also should consider
whether mandatory price-swing
limits or other "circuit-breakers"
should be imposed.
"We're operating under the
same rules we had 50 years ago,
and the financial world is a differ
ent place," he said.
Meanwhile, as discussion of the
report continued, officials of the
largest two stock exchanges said
they have taken no major precau
tions to ease the effects of an
other sharp fall in stock prices,
should another major sell-off
begin Monday. Friday's trading
dropped the Dow Jones Indus
trial Average 140.58 points, and
raised concerns that investors
plan to pump more sell orders
into the system when exchanges
open Monday.
