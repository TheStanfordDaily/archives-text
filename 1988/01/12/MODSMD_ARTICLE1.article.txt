# Residences to get condoms in bathrooms

The University Housing Operations Advisory
Committee yesterday gave approval for the installa
tion of condom dispenser machines in dormitories
and other residences.
Council of Presidents member Leonard Adler
said the machines will he installed in public
bathrooms and common areas in student residences
within "a couple of weeks."
Committee Chairperson Marni Lum said the
machines will be installed in all student residences
with public bathrooms. Those buildings without
public bathrooms may vote to place the machines in
hallway bathrooms. Lum added that should a
residence decide not to install the machines, that
residence would be "dealt with individually."
"We decided that condom dispensers are a good
idea . . . and therefore should be made readily
available to students in the residences, and equally
available to both men and women," Lum said.
The decision to place the dispensers in public
areas only was made "in order to appease people
who are against them," Lum said, adding that the
committee wanted to show "proper respect to
people who are offended by them."
She added that the decision to install the dis
pensers took a long time because they will be placed
"in people's homes."
"It's not like putting them in a gym," she said,
noting that there might eventually be 100 machines
across campus.
In coed hallway bathrooms, only one machine will
be installed. Otherwise, a maximum of two
machines will be installed in any one house.
Condom machines were installed in Roble and
Encina Gyms in November. The Tresidder Union
Board also decided last Thursday to install dis
pensers in Tresidder.
Adler said similar proposals are being made to
place condom vending machines in University libra
ries.
Lum stressed that "education is a big part" of the
project, and said whatever profits come from the
machines may be used toward on-campus sex edu-
