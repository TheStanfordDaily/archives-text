# Bigger collider in the works

Plans to build a high-energy
collider in the Foothills are
being developed by scientists
at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC).
I he project is in"the very
preliminary research and de
velopment stages," according
to SLAC Director Burton
Richter. who said the plans call
for constructing a building that
will extend for five miles, in
contrast to the existing two
mile SLAC facility.
Richter noted, however, that
the new collider will not
replace the old one. He added
that the new facility should
enable scientists to produce
atomic collisions with five to
10 times more energy than is
now possible.
He said information from
the Stanford Linear Collider, a
$1 15-million addition to

SLAC that opened last spring,
is already leading to innova
tions that will be incorporated
in the design for the expanded
project.
The earliest any proposal
could be ready for construc
tion, according to Richter,
would be "early in the 19905."
"In high-energy physics, big
ger is better," he said, adding
that "it takes a very long time
for new facilities to be put in
place."
Because SLAC is largely
subsidized by federal grants,
Richter must travel to Wash
ington, D C., to acquire re
sources for the facility. "I am
in Washington, D C., about
once a month," he said.
But in his last trip, Richter
said he did not raise the ques
tion of funding for the new fa
cility because the trip was
dominated by budget concerns
linked to the late approval by
Congress of this year's budget.
