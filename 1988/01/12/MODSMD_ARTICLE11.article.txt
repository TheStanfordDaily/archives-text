# Profs, deem INF treaty a success

The Intermediate-Range Nu
clear Forces (INF) treaty signed
during last month's U.S.-Soviet
summit is a positive step toward a
more stable global environment,
Political Science Assoc. Prof.
Condoleezza Rice and Deputy
Director of SLAC Sidney Drell
told a group of students at Bran
ner Hall last night.
Rice, who served as a consul
tant to ABC News and appeared
on "ABC Nightline" during the
summit, spoke of the effects that
the political agendas of the
United States and the Soviet Un
ion had on the summit. She
stressed that President Ronald
Reagan "wants to think about his
place in history and what he can
leave as a legacy for the future
generations" because of the short
time remaining in his term — less
than a year — and because of the
"questionable Reagan legacy at
this time."

"One thing that Reagan would
like to leave to the world is the
impression that he knew how to
deal with the Soviet Union and
that he, in fact, got some of the
best arms control treaties that
have ever been achieved," she
said.
Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorba
chev's political agenda is slightly
more complex than Reagan's,
Rice said.
First, he wants to restructure
and rejuvenate the Soviet eco
nomy and introduce entrepre
neurial incentives that are against
Soviet tradition and bureaucracy,
according to Rice.
"There's a Soviet saying, 'We
pretend to work, and they
pretend to pay us,' and Gorba
chev wants to get rid of it," Rice
said.
Second, Gorbachev wants
cooperation and support from the
society and the people, which
Rice says are essential to good
governing, even in a dictatorship.
Finally, Gorbachev needs an

international environment that is
"benign" in order for the eco
nomy to prosper and his pro
grams to succeed.
"In this way, he can 'stretch
out' and work toward the success
of military modernization, which
is projected to be completed in
1996," Rice said. "An equal em
phasis and equal spin-offs into
both civilian and military eco
nomy and development is highly
desirable and obtainable through
measures such as the INF treaty."
She said Gorbachev was eager
to appease the United States,
knowing that nuclear threats sel
dom produce desirable effects,
and that "you get more with
honey than with vinegar."
Drell, who has served as the co
chairman of Stanford's Center for
International Studies and Arms
Control, was invited to the Soviet
Embassy along with about 50
other important U.S. figures in
order to meet Gorbachev on the
first night of the summit.

"[Gorbachev] was impressive
— he exuded warmth and confi
dence, wanting to add democratic
and ethical elements to
socialism," Drell said.
Drell, who evaluated U.S.-
Soviet relations of the past year,
said the Reykjavik summit was a
precursor to the INF treaty. This
treaty set the precedent for a
summit on strategic offensive
missiles that is expected to take
place in May or June of this year,
Drell said.
"For the first time, actual
reductions of arms became a part
of the world's agenda," he said.
According to Drell, the most
significant progress achieved by
the INF treaty is not only reduc
tion of medium- and short-range
nuclear-tipped missiles, but also
the on-sight verifications of the
reductions.
Both Rice and Drell expect the
spring Moscow summit to result
in a 50 percent reduction of stra
tegic offensive missiles.
