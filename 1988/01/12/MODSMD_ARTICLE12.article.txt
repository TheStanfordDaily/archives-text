The demise of Roble Hall again brings into
focus the shortcomings of one of the most mis
guided facets of Stanford's undergraduate resi
dential system: the returning resident priority in
the Draw.
That priority — which virtually assures an up
perclass student in a particular dorm of another
year of residency in that dorm in his next
guaranteed year— has been debated repeatedly,
and its flaws have been discussed on numerous
occasions in this forum. Still, those flaws merit
review.
The most fundamental problem with the re
turning resident priority is that it defeats the pur
pose of the Draw. The point of the Draw should
be to allow all students an equal opportunity for
desirable housing in a system in which all dorms
clearly are not created equal, and all students
cannot be housed in their first choice of
residence. All guaranteed students should ap
proach the tub of numbers with equal chance of
getting into the housing they desire.
But the returning resident priority builds ine
quality into the Draw by automatically giving
some students a better chance of getting into
highly desirable housing than others. And in so
doing, it perpetuates an individual's first Draw
number, so that a person who draws well as a
freshman is assured of living in preferred housing
for the rest of his guaranteed years, while a stu
dent who draws poorly as a freshman may be

doomed to live in less favorable housing for the
rest of his time at Stanford.
Furthermore, Residential Education's argu
ment in favor of the returning resident priority —
essentially, that it provides continuity in the pop
ulation, and therefore in the life and program
ming, of residences — simply does not hold
water.
In the case of only a few select dorms is the re
turning resident priority exercised with any en
thusiasm, and the kind of demographic continuity
desired would be just as easily achieved in the
normal Draw through the natural process of
people drawing back into their old dorms. The
returning resident priority is not needed to
achieve Res Ed's goal.
There is no time like the present to dismantle
the returning resident priority. The closure of
Roble in effect creates a huge population of re
turning residents without a residence to which
they can return. The sensible solution — rather
than giving displaced Roble-ites practically carte
blanche rights to determine the houses to which
they will exercise their returning residence — is
to throw the returning resident priority out the
window completely.
That would right a wrong that has persisted in
the Draw system for far too long, and would put
all guaranteed students where they belong: on
equal footing, regardless of where they have lived
in the past.
