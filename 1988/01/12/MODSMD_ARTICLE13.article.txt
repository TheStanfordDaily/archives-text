## Parking ticket outrage 
### 
It has taken me far too long to
finally write this opinion letter to
The Daily. I suppose it will go
down as Jodie's Last Testament
because tomorrow, or sometime
very soon, the Stanford Police
Department will send an officer
over to arrest me for unpaid
parking tickets. Allow me to note
that I am a Georgia girl who spent
eight hours at California traffic
school for running a stop sign at 5
mph on my turbo-model Honda
Spree scooter. That was three
years ago, and as a senior and
good citizen thus far, I hereby ex
ercise my right to express rage
about the ridiculous and frivolous
distribution of parking tickets on
this campus.

Jodie Martinson

I can swallow the first one I got
this year — I slipped up and
parked five feet within the No
Motorized Vehicles zone by Old
Union — but I am incredulous
about the six or so other tickets I
have received in less than one
and-a-half months. These I got
for "parking within 100 feet of an
academic building." Is it me, or
are we all paying for Penny
Parking Meter Maid to go to
Australia for the holidays? Fire
laws or no fire laws, I can find and
photograph at least 10 parking

lots or slots on campus that are
well within 100 feet of any aca
demic building. By the way, what
is a non-academic building on a
university campus— the Bridge?

What exactly is
going on here? I
don't even know
where to go for
help. ... If this is
justice, let me rebel

I feel compelled to express that
I am tired of this fiasco now. I am
sick of how we are penalized for
trying to get an education. 1 know
that I am among the millions of us
who have gotten a ticket for
parking within four miles of the
library. What exactly is going on
here? I don't even know where to
go for help. 1 called for a court
date to protest my feeble case to
the law, but in order to do that, I
must drive to San Jose and wait in
a very long line to make an ap
pointment with a judge that I am
sure will be during class, or better
yet, a scheduled exam.
If this is justice, let me rebel. I
feel as if I'm working hard
enough to keep my nose clean at
this school — 1 do not raise hell, I

do not wreak havoc, occasionally
I raise a glass, but, hey, I'm legal.
Why am I penalized for driving
my scooter to class and parking
outside the limits but within 100
feet of a building? (Would the
middle of El Camino suffice, offi
cer?) Why do cars get to park
within this limit, and I do not? If
fire laws are so stringent that an
army of meter maids is sent to
keep us in check, then why don't
they apply these laws to parking
lot placement as well.
I'm confused. I love our new
parking structure, but 1 refuse to
park there so I can walk to class at
the physics tank. The point is, I
simply cannot take any more.
I am not alone, and no, I don't
have the money for the tickets,
and no, I don't really have the
time to hang out in San Jose so I
can go back again to waste a day
in court. I am a student, not a
criminal. I feel ashamed that the
police force has nothing better to
do than fill out parking-ticket
pads to raise revenue when they
should be apprehending the
escaped convict out of the bushes
within 100 feet of where I live.
Will someone help me speak
out, or is the situation helpless? If
nothing else, a few fire-law signs
would be nice.
Maybe President Kennedy has
some ideas. . . .
