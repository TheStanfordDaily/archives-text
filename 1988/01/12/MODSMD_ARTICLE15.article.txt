# Immunity to violence
## 
### 
The third time I saw the movie "Robocop" 1 was
at a matinee showing, and about half of the people
in the audience were little kids. By "little" I mean
kids under about 13 years old. Some were with their
parents, but most stayed in rowdy groups in the
front rows, throwing popcorn and rocking the seats
back and forth. "Robocop" is not exactly Disney
fare; it contains so much violence that at one point it
barely escaped an X rating. Yet the kids in the
theater ate it up like a Saturday morning cartoon. In
fact, during the most violent parts, many of them
were laughing.

Violence in movies is a touchy subject. Some
people view excessively violent movies as embar
rassing symbols of the moral decadence of modern
society. Others see violent movies simply as harm
less entertainment. No matter how you may feel
about movie violence, the fact is, it's everywhere, in
some form or another. Sooner or later, we must
decide for ourselves whether we find movie violence
acceptable and, if so, how we will reconcile it in our
own lives— and later, in the lives of our children.
Take "Robocop," for example. Personally, I have
to admit that I enjoy violent movies. Usually I can
handle them without any problem. The first time I
saw "Robocop," however, 1 nearly felt sick. It was
not the violence itself that affected me so much as
the vicarious experience of watching it. When Peter
Weller's character was literally shot to pieces, it
seemed so real that I felt upset. Each time he was
shot, I could not help thinking how it would feel if
the same thing were happening to me at that instant.
Yet when I saw the violence in that theater with all
the little kids, it did not seem to bother them in the
least. The ease with which they accepted seeing
bodies melted, mangled and otherwise put out of
commission was rather disturbing.
As adults, we believe that we have the ability to
distinguish between "real" violence and
"imaginary" violence, and to adjust our reactions
accordingly. We might laugh during such movies as
"Aliens" or "The Road Warrior" even though
people are getting brutally killed left and right, be
cause we know it's OK to laugh. When we watch the
news and we see people killed, however, our reac
tion is a sober one. The types of violence are practi
cally indistinguishable. Yet, whether we view them

as real or imaginary can result in completely oppo
site reactions. But how can we be sure that children
are able to make this distinction?
In the movie "Toxic Avenger," for example,
there is a fight scene in which the hero first rips off a
thug's arm and then proceeds to beat him with it.
This scene, as well as the rest of the violence that
runs rampant throughout the movie, is so ridiculous
that one can't help laughing. The movie is hilarious.
Yet if young children were to see "Toxic Avenger,"
would they understand the difference between that
and, say, "Full Metal Jacket"? Would they realize
why laughter is acceptable in one, but not in the
other? It's hard to know for certain.
Even if one keeps one's kids away from the
theaters, it's still not completely safe. With the ad
vent of the VCR, obtaining a good dose of movie vi
olence is easier than ever. Not only do you have a
vast selection of violence to choose from, but you
can also watch all the good parts over and over
again for free (sometimes even in slow motion). For
people like me who enjoy laughing at silly violent
movies like "Escape From New York" or "Assault
On Precinct 13," the VCR is a good thing. But for
parents trying to protect young children from seeing
movie violence, the VCR could be a nightmare.
Even one of the most beloved facets of childhood,
the cartoon, can be fraught with violence. Have you
ever watched the old (pre-1955 or so) "Tom &
Jerry" cartoons? Throughout elementary school, I
watched them faithfully until I knew nearly every
one by heart and never gave them a second thought.
Recently, 1 saw some again for the first time in years
and was amazed at the incredible violence in the
stories. Tom, the cat, has had his tail chopped off
with an axe; he's been caught in a lawn mower,
baked in a waffle iron and generally mutilated in
every way imaginable. Each time, of course, he
survives, only to be abused in the next cartoon.
Maybe I'm becoming paranoid in my old age, but I
can't help wondering what would happen if a child
decided to try the same thing on the family cat to see
if it, too, would "bounce back." It's a scary thought.
I'm not making a statement against violence.
After all, my favorite movie is still "The Ter
minator." I do feel, however, that we seriously need
to assess our tolerance for movie violence and to
consider how we will handle it with our own
children. Parents of young children should take
great care to prevent them from seeing excessive vi
olence until the kids are mature enough to handle it.
We don't know for certain how early exposure to
movie violence affects our attitudes toward real vio
lence later in life. Until we do, we should play it
safe.

society. Others see violent movies simply as harm
less entertainment. No matter how you may feel
about movie violence, the fact is, it's everywhere, in
some form or another. Sooner or later, we must
decide for ourselves whether we find movie violence
acceptable and, if so, how we will reconcile it in our
own lives— and later, in the lives of our children.
Take "Robocop," for example. Personally, I have
to admit that I enjoy violent movies. Usually I can
handle them without any problem. The first time I
saw "Robocop," however, 1 nearly felt sick. It was
not the violence itself that affected me so much as
the vicarious experience of watching it. When Peter
Weller's character was literally shot to pieces, it
seemed so real that I felt upset. Each time he was
shot, I could not help thinking how it would feel if
the same thing were happening to me at that instant.
Yet when I saw the violence in that theater with all
the little kids, it did not seem to bother them in the
least. The ease with which they accepted seeing
bodies melted, mangled and otherwise put out of
commission was rather disturbing.
As adults, we believe that we have the ability to
distinguish between "real" violence and
"imaginary" violence, and to adjust our reactions
accordingly. We might laugh during such movies as
"Aliens" or "The Road Warrior" even though
people are getting brutally killed left and right, be
cause we know it's OK to laugh. When we watch the
news and we see people killed, however, our reac
tion is a sober one. The types of violence are practi
cally indistinguishable. Yet, whether we view them

as real or imaginary can result in completely oppo
site reactions. But how can we be sure that children
are able to make this distinction?
In the movie "Toxic Avenger," for example,
there is a fight scene in which the hero first rips off a
thug's arm and then proceeds to beat him with it.
This scene, as well as the rest of the violence that
runs rampant throughout the movie, is so ridiculous
that one can't help laughing. The movie is hilarious.
Yet if young children were to see "Toxic Avenger,"
would they understand the difference between that
and, say, "Full Metal Jacket"? Would they realize
why laughter is acceptable in one, but not in the
other? It's hard to know for certain.
Even if one keeps one's kids away from the
theaters, it's still not completely safe. With the ad
vent of the VCR, obtaining a good dose of movie vi
olence is easier than ever. Not only do you have a
vast selection of violence to choose from, but you
can also watch all the good parts over and over
again for free (sometimes even in slow motion). For
people like me who enjoy laughing at silly violent
movies like "Escape From New York" or "Assault
On Precinct 13," the VCR is a good thing. But for
parents trying to protect young children from seeing
movie violence, the VCR could be a nightmare.
Even one of the most beloved facets of childhood,
the cartoon, can be fraught with violence. Have you
ever watched the old (pre-1955 or so) "Tom &
Jerry" cartoons? Throughout elementary school, I
watched them faithfully until I knew nearly every
one by heart and never gave them a second thought.
Recently, 1 saw some again for the first time in years
and was amazed at the incredible violence in the
stories. Tom, the cat, has had his tail chopped off
with an axe; he's been caught in a lawn mower,
baked in a waffle iron and generally mutilated in
every way imaginable. Each time, of course, he
survives, only to be abused in the next cartoon.
Maybe I'm becoming paranoid in my old age, but I
can't help wondering what would happen if a child
decided to try the same thing on the family cat to see
if it, too, would "bounce back." It's a scary thought.
I'm not making a statement against violence.
After all, my favorite movie is still "The Ter
minator." I do feel, however, that we seriously need
to assess our tolerance for movie violence and to
consider how we will handle it with our own
children. Parents of young children should take
great care to prevent them from seeing excessive vi
olence until the kids are mature enough to handle it.
We don't know for certain how early exposure to
movie violence affects our attitudes toward real vio
lence later in life. Until we do, we should play it
safe.

The third time I saw the movie "Robocop" 1 was
at a matinee showing, and about half of the people
in the audience were little kids. By "little" I mean
kids under about 13 years old. Some were with their
parents, but most stayed in rowdy groups in the
front rows, throwing popcorn and rocking the seats
back and forth. "Robocop" is not exactly Disney
fare; it contains so much violence that at one point it
barely escaped an X rating. Yet the kids in the
theater ate it up like a Saturday morning cartoon. In
fact, during the most violent parts, many of them
were laughing.

Violence in movies is a touchy subject. Some
people view excessively violent movies as embar
rassing symbols of the moral decadence of modern
society. Others see violent movies simply as harm
less entertainment. No matter how you may feel
about movie violence, the fact is, it's everywhere, in
some form or another. Sooner or later, we must
