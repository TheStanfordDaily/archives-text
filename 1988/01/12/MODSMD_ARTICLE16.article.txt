## The 						politicking in all-male clubs 
### 
In response to Michael Dickstein's letter
(Daily, Jan. 6), I have a few points to make.
First of all, I am not an athlete, nor do I claim
to represent the Athletic Department when I
defend a weight training class for women.
Clearly, a bit of logic must be applied when
considering that this special class probably
exists for reasons other than that "some
women might feel uncomfortable exercising in
front of men." Not all women wish to undergo
such rigorous exercise regiments. Perhaps this
class offers a moderate alternative for the
woman who wishes to mildly tone her body.

But enough of the specific and onto the
larger issue: all-male clubs. Again, I must
state that I do not consider myself a
"feminist," but I am a woman. I am not of
fended by Dickstein's opinion, as some
diehard feminists might be.
A few months ago, I too shared the opinion
that all the shouting about all-male clubs
seemed silly. It didn't make sense that
feminists and other women's coalitions had
their exclusively female groups but could
complain about the exclusively male groups.
But no sooner had I made this firm decision
in favor of the rights of the all-male clubs than
I took a job producing a weekly public affairs
show with a Sacramento television station. At

that time, another attempt to pass a bill ban
ning tax-exemptions and renewal of liquor
licenses to all-male clubs was being pushed
through the California Assembly by As
semblywoman Gwen Moore. I chose this issue
for my first show.
You see, women do not object to the exis
tence of all-male clubs solely on the basis that
the clubs exclude women from fun social ac
tivities. Women have social clubs for that. The
one thing that sets the two types of clubs apart
is money. And by money, I mean politics,
business, etc.
Despite what the members of all-male clubs
may argue, they are not merely "a bunch of
guys getting together over lunch and a few
drinks down at the club." In reality, they are
"a bunch of guys getting together over lunch
and a few drinks down at the club in order to
close the deal of the century on a new adver
tising account, or to influence a friend to give
you the rights to develop some prime land, or
to talk to the pals and have them pass the
word about your political campaign, or to get
a new insurance policy for your business from
an insurance broker buddy at the club who
will knock off his commission fee."
And what it all boils down to is that women
are quietly being pushed out of the business
and political world that they've so recently
begun to enter. They aren't being pushed out
because they lack knowledge or skills, but be
cause they lack contacts. To get money (or
succeed politically), you need contacts. To get

contacts you join an all-male cluh. It's that
simple ... for men.
In all of my phone calls and research for the
show on all-male clubs, I only encountered
roadblocks from the Sutter, Bohemian and
Olympic clubs, as well as numerous other all
male clubs in California. I cannot even begin
to express how frustrating it was to try to sip
hon some information or comments out of
clubs' representatives or members, a few of
whom were even former bosses or family
friends. And it wasn't like I was expressing a '
bias against these men. If I was unable to hide
my position on the issue during my conversa
tion with them, then it shouldn't have hin- |
dered me. After all, I was on their side.
Essentially, I became really disgusted with
these men's arrogant attitudes and refusals to 1
discuss this issue. I sat down and reassessed
the problem. So now I feel that all-male clubs
(specifically the Sutter, Bohemian and Olym- ,
pic clubs) unfairly exclude women and even
minority men in some cases.
If we could abolish the unfairness present in
some all-male clubs by making them admit '
women, people of both sexes would benefit. I
am not familiar with the Marin County Morn
ing Dialogue, but I doubt that this club is
analogous to the Bohemian Club as far as
business and political contacts are concerned,
If it were, then maybe Dean Jean would be a
member, and Stanford University would pay
her membership dues.
