## The 						intrepid Bug goes out on a (lost) limb 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
A few thoughts for the new quarter:
• I don't know why everybody's complaining
about the poisoning of birds at Tresidder. It's about
time the birds received the same treatment as every
one else who dines there.
• How to save money on books: Borrow a video
camera and take it to the Bookstore. Then, for each
textbook you will need, simply leaf rapidly through
the pages, filming as you go. When you get home,
play the tape back in slow motion to read the books.
Voila!
• Finally, I feel compelled to recommend a terif
fic class that is being specially offered this quarter. It
is a three-unit class called "The Plight of the Home
less." It meets at Roble.
Dear Bug,
Wfo.it happens to human limbs after they are am
putated? Do they go in the trash? Do they get sent on
a spaceship into the atmosphere? Do they get ground
into powder and spread over the ocean? Also, can I
keep my leg after it's amputated?

First of all, babe, you should know that this is
without question the most disgusting question I have
received in my three months of writing this column.
Which is, of course, why I have chosen to answer it.
I gave a call to the Surgery Department of the
Stanford Medical Center and got in touch with a
nice doctor who gave me a revolting and graphic
description of how amputations take place.
For those of you too squeamish to deal with this,
please skip to the next section titled "Where do
them limbs go?" See you there.
Gross-out section on amputation: Still reading? I
thought so. Anything short of tag-team cannibalism
and you'd keep reading.
One of the biggest problems I have with this
whole discussion of amputations is the way the med
ical community discusses them. The doctor I talked

to used terms like "The limb is removed by a sur
geon," or "The limb comes off in the operating
room." Frankly, the terms "removed" and "comes
off" are more appropriate for Legos than for legs.
The last time I checked, my leg didn't snap on to
my hip with plastic connectors, but rather was at
tached rather solidly by a large bone. According to
my dorm pre-med, Julia (pronounced, for some
bizarre Argentinean reason, as 'Hoo-lee-uh'), the
arms and legs contain lots of bones such as the
fibula, the tibia, the narnia, the humongous, the
radio, the ulcer and the tiburon.
To "remove" (chop off) a limb, they first make an
incision in the skin around the limb so that they can
create a flap over the stump after the limb is
removed. Then they cut through the muscles around
the bone, tying off the major blood vessels as they
go so as to prevent such side-effects as bleeding or
death. Finally, and this is my favorite part, they cut
through the bone.
With what, you ask? With a gas-driven power saw,
that's what! I don't know about you, but frankly the
thought of having a doctor cut through my femur
with a power saw does not make my list of Top 10
Fun Activities. Apparently, some doctors prefer
using hand-saws, which is even less thrilling a con
cept than power-saws. I want my doctor to act like a
surgeon, not a lumberjack.
Where do them limbs go?: This may or may not
have occurred to you before, but when a limb is am
putated it is generally done so because the limb is
damaged and not for cosmetic purposes.
After the limb is sawed off, it is put in a bag and
taken to the Surgical Pathology Department, where
it is examined by pathologists. Often there are
tumors or other strange diseases in the limb, and the
doctors need to examine it so they can tell the pa
tient, "Your leg is very sick. I think it should see a
lawyer about drawing up a will."
After the limb has been examined, it is individu
ally wrapped and labeled (like American cheese
slices) and put into a giant freezer. They keep the
limb in this freezer (along with other assorted body
parts) for two months, in case they need to examine

it later.
After two months, they take the limb out of deep
freeze and sell it to Food Service for use in hash. No,
sorry, I made that up. What really happens is the
limb is vaporized in an incinerator. Body parts used
to be incinerated at the Stanford Hospital, but now
the hospital contracts with Stanford University to
have the limbs picked up and incinerated on
campus. (Ever wonder what that smell was coming
from the steam vents?)
As for whether you can keep a limb that has been
amputated, hospital officials are reluctant to release
tissue to patients, but concede that they will if the
patient insists, because "after all, it is their tissue."
Why you would want to keep it is absolutely

beyond me. I can only imagine going to a dinner
party and seeing Uncle Mike's trophy collection:
"This is the Bengal tiger he bagged in '42. That's the
gazelle Mike got in '75. Over the fireplace is Mike's
leg, which we just got back from the taxidermist."
Gag me with a power-saw.
Dear Hug,
Why are Berkeley students called Weenies? / have
some friends at Berkeley and they're nice. Also, do
they have a name for us?
- Cardinally Confused
If you would take one second to look in a diction
ary you would see that "weenie" is a variation on
the spelling "wienie," which says "see frankfurter,"
which is defined as "A cured cooked sausage that
may be skinless or stuffed in a casing." In essence,
then, we call our archrivals "sausages," which, I
might add, is probably the stupidest put-down on
the face of the Earth.
However, if you look at the word "weeny," which
is defined as "tiny or exceptionally small," you
could learn from a linguistics major (such as I) that
we have extended the meaning of "weeny" from
"small or insignificant physically" to "insignificant
mentally, socially and sartorially."
As you can plainly see, then, we call Berkeley stu
dents "weenies" because they tell us to during Ori
entation week and we're all a bunch of obedient
sheep.
As for what they call us: This is going to blow you
away, but they call us "weenies" too. Strange, but
true. According to my Cal correspondents, not only
do they call us "weenies," but they also hiss in class
when schools such as Stanford, Harvard or Yale are
mentioned. And we always thought we were so
original.
Although we affectionately refer to our campus as
"The Farm," Berkeley students refer to us as
"Farmers." Their sentiments, however, are not
nearly as affectionate as ours, and I believe for them
the term "Farmer" carries negative connotations
which include sleeping with barnyard animals.
