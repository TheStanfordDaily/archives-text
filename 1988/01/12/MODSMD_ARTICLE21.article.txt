## New technology looks to build with atoms 
### Martin Kevorkian 
Imagine a fleet of tiny
machines patrolling a human's
bloodstream for fat and harmful
organisms. With moving parts
built from only a few atoms, the
machines travel to damaged
tissue, repairing cells by rebuild
ing them, altering proteins and
rearranging DN A.
These are among the possible
applications of nanotechnology, a
vision of future engineering
rooted in well-established scien
tific knowledge. Nanotechnology
is a new area of study concerned
with the ability to arrange objects
on the order of a billionth of a
meter. "Nano" means "billionth"
in English and "dwarf" in old
Greek.
A leading thinker in the field is
K. Eric Drexler, founder of the
M.I.T. Nanotechnology Study
Group and visiting scholar at
Stanford University. Over the
past few years, Drexler has in
vested considerable thought in
refining the vision of nanotech
nology. He has written "Engines
of Creation," a book describing in
detail the prospects for nanotech
nology.
The key to nanotechnology will
be what Drexler calls "assem
blers." An assembler is a device
that can build other devices or
materials — from a hamburger to
a house — from atoms. Drexler

describes these hypothetical as
semblers. in an article published
in Whole Earth Review, "as
molecular machines that grab
reactive molecules and bring
them together in a controlled
way, building up a complex
structure a few atoms at a time."
Assemblers would also be ca
pable of reproducing themselves,
Drexler says. Supplied with suffi
cient raw materials, the number
of assemblers could grow ex
ponentially.
In addition to building tiny
computers molecular machines
capable of fighting disease and
aging, assemblers could be used
to construct very strong and light
new materials or fabricate con
ventional materials flawlessly
with virtually all the atoms in the
right place.
With nanotechnology, the ma
terials we could make would not
be limited by our engineering
skills, but by the actual physical
laws that govern the strength of
atomic bonds, according to Drex
ler. This assumes that scientists
will not be able to alter internal
atomic structure, which is not
within the realm of nanotechnol
ogy
Drexler has worked out the
details of how to supply the as
semblers with bearings — parts
fundamental to machine design
on any scale.

Drexler has devised a method
by which the nanomachines might
be made programmable. He has
proposed the use of "rod logic,"
in which logical operations could
be carried out by sliding
molecular rods in a matrix.
Nanotechnology offers possi
bilities for computer miniaturiza
tion. Drexler estimates these rod
logic computers would be about
as fast as today's computers, but
would be much smaller The
equivalent of a mainframe could
be contained in one cubic micron,
one billion times smaller than a
cubic centimeter. A cubic centi

meter could house up to half a
trillion processors, more comput
ing power than contained in the
world today.
Drexler is quick to point out,
however, that "very clever paral
lel software" would be required
to take advantage of that poten
tial, and that nanotechnology
only addresses the hardware
aspect of engineering.
Drexler is very careful to guard
against fabulous statements being
made that might discredit his
field, which tends to attract im
precise thinkers. He has written
an article titled "The Problem of

Nonsense in Nanotechnology,"
which confronts the issues of
"bogosity" and "fl a kin ess."
Drexler is sensitive to these is
sues because of misunderstand
ings that have weakened the
credibility of nanotechnology.
For instance, in a discussion of
the potential for nanotechnology
to revolutionize computers,
Drexler was dismayed when the
Washington Post misquoted him
claiming that molecular machines
will provide us with "computers a
trillion times faster." Drexler's
actual claim is that nanocom
puters based upon his idea of

molecular machines will be a tril
lion times more compact.
Drexler said he started
"firming up" his ideas about
nanotechnology around 1977 at
M.1.T., where he was inspired by
biochemistry and molecular biol
ogy research which he thought
might apply engineering to these
prospects. Molecular machines
might be engineered, with me
chanical designs analogous to bio
logical materials such as enzymes,
viruses, white blood cells, bac
teria and bacteriophages.
Drexler points to three possible
paths that may lead to develop
ments in nanotechnology. Ad
vances in biotechnology, specifi
cally in the design of protein, "the
molecular machinery of life,"
would allow engineers to build
"protein machines," which could
themselves build other non
protein machines.
Advances in chemistry, such as
improved techniques for design
ing protein-like molecules, may
also contribute to nanotechnol
ogy. Finally, micromanipulators
that can control scanning tunnel
ing microscopes to move very
precise fractions of an angstrom
may spur nanotechnological
developments.
There have been recent impor
tant developments in both
chemistry and in micromanip-

ulators that seem relevant to
nanotechnology. Drexler cited a
recent Nobel Prize awarded in
chemistry to Pedersen, Cram and
Lehn for synthesizing simple
molecules that perform protein
like functions, and in 1986 a
Nobel Prize awarded for
micromanipulator research initi
ated at International Business
Machines Corp.
Each of these approaches, or
some combination of them, could
lead to the all-important assem
blers, "which, in turn, will be able
to build almost anything." But,
Drexler said, "the way we get
there doesn't much matter." He
likes to use the following analogy:
"The 747 bears very little
resemblance to the original
Wright Flyer."
Nanotechnology is neither pure
science (the search to understand
the world) nor conventional engi
neering (the immediate applica
tion of designs to actual physical
structures), according to Drexler.
Rather, Drexler describes his
field as "exploratory engineer

ing," the mathematical modeling
of miniature structures based on
ideas from current scientific re
search, but which cannot yet be
built with current technology.
"There is no new science in
nanotechnology," Drexler said,
"only new engineering."
Drexler has a strong sense of
the purpose of his field. "In our
diverse and competitive world,"
he said, "our technological inven
tions evolve toward the limits of
the possible. So to outline our fu
ture, we must outline the possi

ble."
Drexler compares the foresight
embodied by nanotechnology to
the foresight of Leonardo Da
Vinci: "Some of his (Da Vinci's)
predictions were long-range, but
only because many years passed
before people learned to make
parts precise enough, hard
enough and strong enough to
build, for instance, good ball
bearings." Drexler said the only
truly speculative thing about
nanotechnology is guessing when
it will arrive.

The area Drexler is focusing
on, molecular machines, is actu
ally a subset of nanotechnology as
he sees it. He is looking at this
subset partly because of his own
limits and partly because of gen
eral limits of knowledge. Drexler

'There is no new sci
ence in nanotechnology
— only new engineer
ing.'

is looking where he can find
answers and "trying to under
stand something about what we
know can be built."
Drexler's designs for molecular
machines, for instance, are based
on classical mechanics. Even
though the forces involved arise
from quantum mechanical phe
nomenon, Drexler can calculate
models based on classical me
chanics without completely un
derstanding the underlying quan
tum mechanics.
One area of nanotechnology
Drexler has not explored is
molecular electronics, which in
cludes logical devices whose only
moving parts are electrons.

Molecular electronics is different
from molecular machinery, whose
logical operations, based on the
movement of rods, are purely me
chanical.
Drexler said it is possible that
molecular electronic computers
will someday also be built by as
semblers, with a dramatic in
crease in speed over rod logic.
However, at present it is diffi
cult to come up with a solid
design for molecular electronic
devices because any rigorous
mathematical analysis becomes
"messy," according to Drexler.
Some of the messiness might be
eliminated, but that would re
quire simplifying assumptions
that are hard to justify at this
point.
Drexler received an S.B. fol
lowed by an S.M. from M.I.T. He
has been a visiting scholar at
Stanford for about two years and
plans to stay indefinitely, as he
enjoys the proximity of Silicon
Valley and the "very congenial
intellectual environment."
Drexler lectured at a computer
forum here in 1986 and has been
invited by Computer Science De
partment Chairman Nils Nilsson
to teach a seminar on nanotech
nology next year.
