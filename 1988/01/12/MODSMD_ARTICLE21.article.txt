## New technology looks to build with atoms 
### Martin Kevorkian 
Imagine a fleet of tiny
machines patrolling a human's
bloodstream for fat and harmful
organisms. With moving parts
built from only a few atoms, the
machines travel to damaged
tissue, repairing cells by rebuild
ing them, altering proteins and
rearranging DN A.
These are among the possible
applications of nanotechnology, a
vision of future engineering
rooted in well-established scien
tific knowledge. Nanotechnology
is a new area of study concerned
with the ability to arrange objects
on the order of a billionth of a
meter. "Nano" means "billionth"
in English and "dwarf" in old
Greek.
A leading thinker in the field is
K. Eric Drexler, founder of the
M.I.T. Nanotechnology Study
Group and visiting scholar at
Stanford University. Over the
past few years, Drexler has in
vested considerable thought in
refining the vision of nanotech
nology. He has written "Engines
of Creation," a book describing in
detail the prospects for nanotech
nology.
The key to nanotechnology will
be what Drexler calls "assem
blers." An assembler is a device
that can build other devices or
materials — from a hamburger to
a house — from atoms. Drexler

describes these hypothetical as
semblers. in an article published
in Whole Earth Review, "as
molecular machines that grab
reactive molecules and bring
them together in a controlled
way, building up a complex
structure a few atoms at a time."
Assemblers would also be ca
pable of reproducing themselves,
Drexler says. Supplied with suffi
cient raw materials, the number
of assemblers could grow ex
ponentially.
In addition to building tiny
computers molecular machines
capable of fighting disease and
aging, assemblers could be used
to construct very strong and light
new materials or fabricate con
ventional materials flawlessly
with virtually all the atoms in the
right place.
With nanotechnology, the ma
terials we could make would not
be limited by our engineering
skills, but by the actual physical
laws that govern the strength of
atomic bonds, according to Drex
ler. This assumes that scientists
will not be able to alter internal
atomic structure, which is not
within the realm of nanotechnol
ogy
Drexler has worked out the
details of how to supply the as
semblers with bearings — parts
fundamental to machine design
on any scale.

Drexler has devised a method
by which the nanomachines might
be made programmable. He has
proposed the use of "rod logic,"
in which logical operations could
be carried out by sliding
molecular rods in a matrix.
Nanotechnology offers possi
bilities for computer miniaturiza
tion. Drexler estimates these rod
logic computers would be about
as fast as today's computers, but
would be much smaller The
equivalent of a mainframe could
be contained in one cubic micron,
one billion times smaller than a
cubic centimeter. A cubic centi

meter could house up to half a
trillion processors, more comput
ing power than contained in the
world today.
Drexler is quick to point out,
however, that "very clever paral
lel software" would be required
to take advantage of that poten
tial, and that nanotechnology
only addresses the hardware
aspect of engineering.
Drexler is very careful to guard
against fabulous statements being
made that might discredit his
field, which tends to attract im
precise thinkers. He has written
an article titled "The Problem of

Nonsense in Nanotechnology,"
which confronts the issues of
"bogosity" and "fl a kin ess."
Drexler is sensitive to these is
sues because of misunderstand
ings that have weakened the
credibility of nanotechnology.
For instance, in a discussion of
the potential for nanotechnology
to revolutionize computers,
Drexler was dismayed when the
Washington Post misquoted him
claiming that molecular machines
will provide us with "computers a
trillion times faster." Drexler's
actual claim is that nanocom
puters based upon his idea of

molecular machines will be a tril
lion times more compact.
Drexler said he started
"firming up" his ideas about
nanotechnology around 1977 at
M.1.T., where he was inspired by
biochemistry and molecular biol
ogy research which he thought
might apply engineering to these
prospects. Molecular machines
might be engineered, with me
chanical designs analogous to bio
logical materials such as enzymes,
viruses, white blood cells, bac
teria and bacteriophages.
Drexler points to three possible
paths that may lead to develop
ments in nanotechnology. Ad
vances in biotechnology, specifi
cally in the design of protein, "the
molecular machinery of life,"
would allow engineers to build
"protein machines," which could
themselves build other non
protein machines.
Advances in chemistry, such as
improved techniques for design
ing protein-like molecules, may
also contribute to nanotechnol
ogy. Finally, micromanipulators
that can control scanning tunnel
ing microscopes to move very
precise fractions of an angstrom
may spur nanotechnological
developments.
There have been recent impor
tant developments in both
chemistry and in micromanip-
