## Tara's theme: recruit

Move over Moses, another miracle-worker is in
town.
Three years ago, the Stanford women's basketball
team was one of the perennial pushovers of the Pac
West Conference, working hard but rarely breaking
a .500 won-lost record.
Enter Tara VanDerveer. Coming off of an ex
tremely successful five-year stint as coach of Big
Ten powerhouse Ohio State — where she amassed
an impressive 1 10-37 record, four Big Ten cham
pionships and three NCAA tournament appear
ances — VanDerveer took the reins of the strug
gling Stanford program, and after two seasons and
two spectacular recruiting classes, has brought the
Cardinal into the top 20 for the first time in school
history.
With a record of 13-0, the team has a good
chance at garnering the Cardinal's first Pacific 10
Conference title and gaining an invitation to appear
in the NCAA tournament for the first time in six
years. Moreover, with just eight more wins, Van-
Derveer will accrue 200 career victories.
Clearly, VanDerveer has worked some wonders
at Stanford, but none is more impressive than three
consecutive recruiting stellar recruiting classes. Her
first season's efforts netted Stanford stars Jennifer
Azzi and Katy Steding, both named to the Pac-10
All-Freshman Team last year. Last year's recruiting
brought in a class of five athletes considered to be
the finest in the nation, and the three athletes that
have already signed on to Stanford for next year
may be even better.
What's the secret to her miracle recruiting?
"It's not a miracle; there are no miracles, just
hard work," Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger said. "She accomplishes it through being ex
tremely well organized, by paying a great deal of at
tention to the people that she is recruiting, by

having her athletes and staff pay attention to the
people she's recruiting and presenting Stanford very
well.
"There's no mystery, there's no magic. It's just
hard work."
VanDerveer agreed. "It's no luck," she said.
"First of all, any coach knows that you have to have
good people for a good program. (Stanford) volley
ball has (Nancy) Reno, (Wendi) Rush and Teresa
Smith, and we have to have good players (of that
caliber)."
To accomplish recruiting goals, VanDerveer and
her staff engage in a long, time-consuming process
that often begins in a player's sophomore year in
high school. Assistant coaches June Daugherty and
Amy Tucker, who both played under VanDerveer
at Ohio State, look for talented players at this early
stage, giving Stanford an early start on bringing
them to the Farm.
"June and Amy are the only ones who can go out
and watch," Van Derveer said, "and they are better
than other people at identifying talent. Then we can
get on them (the recruits) by writing to them and
calling them."
"We also have a superior product to offer them,"
VanDerveer added. "Stanford's education, for kids
interested in medical school or law school, is great
since the women don't have the NBA. And we have
great weather."
Both in the realm of basketball and outside it, the
Cardinal coach displays warmth and wisdom that
has earned her the respect of her players and is the
secret to Stanford's recruiting success.
"The bottom line is that Tara really cares about
the kids as people, and she wants them to do well as
students as well as athletes," Daugherty said. "She
insists that the kids work hard in both areas and
budget their time."
At an institution like Stanford, this attitude is ex-
