## Tara's theme: recruit 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Move over Moses, another miracle-worker is in
town.
Three years ago, the Stanford women's basketball
team was one of the perennial pushovers of the Pac
West Conference, working hard but rarely breaking
a .500 won-lost record.
Enter Tara VanDerveer. Coming off of an ex
tremely successful five-year stint as coach of Big
Ten powerhouse Ohio State — where she amassed
an impressive 1 10-37 record, four Big Ten cham
pionships and three NCAA tournament appear
ances — VanDerveer took the reins of the strug
gling Stanford program, and after two seasons and
two spectacular recruiting classes, has brought the
Cardinal into the top 20 for the first time in school
history.
With a record of 13-0, the team has a good
chance at garnering the Cardinal's first Pacific 10
Conference title and gaining an invitation to appear
in the NCAA tournament for the first time in six
years. Moreover, with just eight more wins, Van-
Derveer will accrue 200 career victories.
Clearly, VanDerveer has worked some wonders
at Stanford, but none is more impressive than three
consecutive recruiting stellar recruiting classes. Her
first season's efforts netted Stanford stars Jennifer
Azzi and Katy Steding, both named to the Pac-10
All-Freshman Team last year. Last year's recruiting
brought in a class of five athletes considered to be
the finest in the nation, and the three athletes that
have already signed on to Stanford for next year
may be even better.
What's the secret to her miracle recruiting?
"It's not a miracle; there are no miracles, just
hard work," Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger said. "She accomplishes it through being ex
tremely well organized, by paying a great deal of at
tention to the people that she is recruiting, by

having her athletes and staff pay attention to the
people she's recruiting and presenting Stanford very
well.
"There's no mystery, there's no magic. It's just
hard work."
VanDerveer agreed. "It's no luck," she said.
"First of all, any coach knows that you have to have
good people for a good program. (Stanford) volley
ball has (Nancy) Reno, (Wendi) Rush and Teresa
Smith, and we have to have good players (of that
caliber)."
To accomplish recruiting goals, VanDerveer and
her staff engage in a long, time-consuming process
that often begins in a player's sophomore year in
high school. Assistant coaches June Daugherty and
Amy Tucker, who both played under VanDerveer
at Ohio State, look for talented players at this early
stage, giving Stanford an early start on bringing
them to the Farm.
"June and Amy are the only ones who can go out
and watch," Van Derveer said, "and they are better
than other people at identifying talent. Then we can
get on them (the recruits) by writing to them and
calling them."
"We also have a superior product to offer them,"
VanDerveer added. "Stanford's education, for kids
interested in medical school or law school, is great
since the women don't have the NBA. And we have
great weather."
Both in the realm of basketball and outside it, the
Cardinal coach displays warmth and wisdom that
has earned her the respect of her players and is the
secret to Stanford's recruiting success.
"The bottom line is that Tara really cares about
the kids as people, and she wants them to do well as
students as well as athletes," Daugherty said. "She
insists that the kids work hard in both areas and
budget their time."
At an institution like Stanford, this attitude is ex-

tremely important, and VanDerveer's ded
ication to her athletes' educations was
among Geiger's reasons for offering her
the position two years ago.
"When we were looking for a women's
basketball coach," Geiger said, "Tara was
recommended by almost eveybody I talked
with as somebody who has had an excellent
record where she's been and a terrific
recruiter, besides being a solid coach.
"I liked the work ethic, and I liked the
intelligence. It's a pretty good combina
tion. My biggest worry was whether we
could recruit Tara and convince her that
Stanford was the place for her," he added.
Junior Emily Wagner may have given
Stanford that extra edge in attracting Van-
Derveer. An entering freshman in 1985
after former Stanford Coach Dotty
McCrea had been released, Wagner earned
her nickname, "The Ambassador," by
recruiting the future coach herself.
Wagner first met VanDerveer at the
1985 National Sports Festival tryouts when
VanDerveer was coaching at Ohio State.
"After that I found out that the head
coach here had been let go," Wagner said.
"The one coach that I enjoyed meeting and
getting to know and watching her teams
play was Tara VanDerveer, and if I had my
pick of who to be coached by in college it
would be her."
"So I took a chance and called her up
after 1 had already decided to come to

Stanford along with Evon ( Asforis) and Jill
(Yanke), and 1 told her that I heard a
rumor that she was being interviewed for a
job out here."
Needless to say, the Buckeye coach was
more than a little surprised. "No one was
supposed to know that," Wagner
confessed. "She was shocked that anyone
had any inkling that she was going out for
the job, and I said, *1 don't know if it's true
or not, but if it is I just want you to know
that I think it would be fantastic if you'd
take the job, and I'd really like to play for
you.'
"I think she was impressed that people
cared enough at the University and
players, especially, would go out of the way
and cared enough about the school to bring
in people like herself," Wagner said.
The Buckeyes' loss is clearly the Cardi
nal's gain. VanDerveer has brought her
run-and-gun style of basketball, enabling
California fans to enjoy the level of play
exhibited by Midwestern teams and allow
ing her players to benefit from one of the
finest coaching styles in collegiate basket
ball.
"She's really analytical and coaches the
game on a very organized, prepared basis,"
Wagner said. "She always know where she
wants to go and what she wants to do. She
also has a great staff and works well with
them, and she has well-defined player roles
for people on the team so people know
what is expected of them."
"She's a really good person," Wagner
added. "If you want to play in a respect
able program she is a very respectable per
son."
