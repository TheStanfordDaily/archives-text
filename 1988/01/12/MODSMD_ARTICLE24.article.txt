# Warner gunning for the gold
## 
### 
If Stanford graduate Bonny
Warner's Olympic chances seem to be
slip sliding away, that's fine with her.
As a luger, Warner has made an art
of slipping and sliding down icy chutes,
and today and tomorrow she will com
pete in the second of three rounds of
races at the Olympic trials in Lake
Placid. N Y.

Each round consists of three runs,
and Warner trails early leader Cammy
Myler by a mere six-hundredths of a
second. Warner is confident of her
chances of not only being one of the
three competitors to make the Olympic
squad, but also of winning the trials.
"I tend to do well in big races," said
Warner, who finished fifth in last year's
World Championships. "I'm not too
worried about the trials. The top three
people are always close, but I still don't
like coming in second. I had three OK
runs, but I'm looking for three good
runs."
Luge ranks right down there with

biathlon and team handball among the
least publicized Olympic sports, but
Warner reported from Lake Placid that
the media have undergone their quad
rennial Olympic-year rediscovery of
the sport.
"It's pretty amazing," she said. "I
think it's going to be a real zoo for the
last day. The press is going nutso."
Thanks to athletes like Warner and
Myler, who ironically took up the sport
on the same day eight years ago, the
American luge corps has never been
better, and when the trials end Sunday,
the United States will likely have its
strongest team ever.
The squad will immediately head to
St. Moritz, Switzerland, for a World
Cup competition, then spend a week
training in East Germany before arriv
ing in Calgary in early February.
Once in Calgary, each woman will
take five training runs before the four
competitive runs on Feb. 16 and 17.
Warner is approaching the Olympics
with a mixture of optimism and realism
as she looks to improve on her 15th
place finish four years ago in Sarejevo,
Yugoslavia.
"If they have four perfect runs and I
have four perfect runs, they'll beat
me," Warner said of her Eastern-Bloc
rivals. "I'm not a favorite for a medal,
and the pressure is on those who are.
They certainly have more pressure. My

goal going into the race is to be among
the top six. We'll just see what happens
on race day."
One factor that could be to Warner's
advantage is the weather. Calgary's
weather is notoriously balky, and a
Chinook wind could wreak havoc on
the lugers. If the wind kicks up, it could
be anybody's ballgame. Warm weather
could also skew the results, as Warner
noted that the track, though
refrigerated, could slow markedly if its
surface becomes too warm.
After she completes her athletic
commitments in Calgary, Warner will
apply the skills she learned as a com
munications major at Stanford by
working for ABC and doing some on
camera reports for San Francisco's
KGO-TV.
Her KGO reports will likely concen
trate on Bay Area athletes, but unfor
tunately the chances of Stanford's
other top luger joining the local contin
gent in Calgary look bleak.
Stanford medical student Scott
Parazynski is currently in the top eight
in the trials but needs a miracle to
qualify.
Parazynski is a former student in the
luge clinics Warner holds every sum
mer on the Farm, and several other of
her more promising pupils have gone
on to do the real thing on the track at
Lake Placid.
