# Evidence suggests that mammals make morphine

Mammals may produce their
own internal morphine, a team of
Stanford scientists has discov
ered.
A key step in converting simple
chemicals into morphine — a
complex chemical derived from
opium-producing poppies — can
occur in the liver tissue of rats,
the researchers said in the Dec.
17 issue of Nature magazine.
The discovery "strongly sug
gests, but does not prove, that
animal tissue makes morphine,"
said Dr. Charles Weitz, a
postdoctoral fellow cooperating
with two Stanford Medical School
professors in the study. "It does
not show that this step is utilized
under normal conditions," he
said.
"This is only one piece in a big
puzzle of whether morphine is
made in mammalian organisms,"
said Pharmacology Prof. Avram
Goldstein, director of the Palo
Alto-based Addiction Research

Foundation, where the research
was conducted.
Although the significance of
the findings is unclear at this
point in the research, Weitz spec
ulated that proof of mammals ac
tually producing morphine could
lead to the discovery of a new
neurochemical system.
Considering the potent effects
that morphine and related drugs
have on tissue, Weitz said "if it's
true that mammals can and do
make morphine, the morphine
must be made for a specific pur
pose." This purpose may be to act
on a neurochemical system, he
added.
Speculation that mammals
could produce morphine ap
peared around 1970, and before
the end of that decade scientists
discovered indirect evidence that
morphine or related drugs could
be made in animal tissue, Weitz
said.
In 1986, the Stanford research
team reported that morphine and
codeine could be found in mam
malian brain tissue.

According to Weitz, the find
ings did not prove the origin of
the morphine, but only verified its
presence in animal tissue.
Weitz said the researchers
assumed that if mammals
produced their own morphine,
their tissues would use the same
series of well-understood chemi
cal reactions that poppies use to
produce the drug. This is because
there are not many other possible
ways to create the morphine
molecule's unusual structure,
Weitz said.
The scientists looked for the
morphine-producing capability in
different kinds of mammalian
tissue, including cow and rat brain
and cow adrenal gland, but found
that the morphine biosynthetic
conversion step occurred only in
rat liver.
However, Weitz said that be
cause "all mammalian species are
similar" at a chemical level, the
ability to make morphine proba
bly is not unique to rat liver and
may occur in other animal tissue
— possibly human tissue.
