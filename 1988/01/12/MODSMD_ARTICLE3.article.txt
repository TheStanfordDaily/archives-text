# Roble closure had little impact
## Officials dispute classroom shortage 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
The current shortage of classroom space is
nothing new at Stanford and has been affected
little by the recent move of ex-Roble residents
into dorm-based seminar rooms, according to
an official in the Registrar's Office.
Assistant Registrar Jack Farrell said yester
day that such shortages — highlighted
recently by complaints from professors — are
"common."
He said a classroom crunch occurs every
quarter— especially for popular mid-morning
classes — and he has noticed "no discernable
increase in problems" this quarter.

Many dorm-based classes are too large for
seminar rooms and are instead held in
residence lounges and living rooms, said Far
rell, who noted that a University study done
last spring concluded professors rarely use
dorm seminar rooms.
Farrell concluded from the study that the
conversion of many of the classrooms to living
spaces as a result of the Roble shutdown has
had little effect on the availability of dorm
based teaching space.
Though some professors have openly com
plained of a shortage in available teaching
areas, Farrell said this problem is a result of
the University's failure to construct additional
classrooms.

He said the problem may be alleviated
somewhat by the construction of new class
rooms in the Near West project, which will
replace existing science buildings behind the
Physics Tank
Dennis Matthies, resident fellow in Otero
House and classroom coordinator for Wilbur
Hall, said the relocation of Roble students in
Wilbur has taken three available classrooms
away from that dorm.
But Matthies — who teaches English in
Otero — said that although some Freshman
English and Western Culture courses are
taught in Wilbur and the dorm is offering
several tutorials this quarter, there will
"probably be enough classrooms to get by"
for his teaching purposes.
