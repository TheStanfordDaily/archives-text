# Campaign office opens
## Campbell sets up headquarters for congressional race 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
Stanford Law Prof. Tom
Campbell hosted about 100 sup
porters and members of the press
at the opening of his congres
sional campaign headquarters in
Mountain View late yesterday af
ternoon. Campbell is seeking to
unseat first-term Republican
Representative Ernie Konnyu for
the Republican nomination for
the 12th Congressional District,
which includes Stanford.
The number of local residents
attending the office opening on
West El Camino Real surprised
campaign organizers. There were
"about twice as many as what we
had expected," said Karin
Miranda, Campbell's campaign
manager.
Alluding to Abraham Lincoln's
early political career, Campbell
humbly compared the small office
to a "log cabin."
In the first of two brief

speeches he gave at the event,
Campbell emphasized that chief
contributors — such as Hewlett-
Packard and former 12th District
Rep. Ed Zschau — do not view
him as the traditional "politi
cian."
"The professional politician
does what the party wants, like a
machine," Campbell said.
"Whatever view I take . . . results
from the best judgment from my
knowledge."
He added that the "profes
sional politician" votes according
to "who might have talked to
(him)," whereas he would vote on
"what I've studied."
Campbell has a doctorate in
economics from the University of
Chicago and is an expert in inter
national law. When he joined the
Law School faculty in 1984,
Campbell, now 35, became the
youngest tenured professor at the
University.
Campbell also stressed that his
bid to win the Republican nomi

nation over Konnyu this June
would not be a "tear-down-the
opposition campaign."
However, he has recently at
tacked Konnyu on specific issues,
such as the flagging of Kuwaiti
ships in the Persian Gulf.
In a Jan. 8 press release,
Campbell denounced Konnyu,
who has claimed to be an ardent
supporter of President Reagan,
for voting against the reflagging
of Kuwaiti tankers last July.
Eighty-six percent of House
Republicans voted in favor of
Reagan's decision to reflag the
Kuwaiti ships.
Campbell last night added that
fund raising for the campaign
"looks promising."
During the autumn semester,
Campbell taught two courses at
the Law School in addition to
campaigning. In the spring he will
teach only one.
"I just gave final exams,"
Campbell said, "so I probably lost
about 120 votes."
