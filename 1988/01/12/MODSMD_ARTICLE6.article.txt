Responding to what they allege
is a lack of structure and account
ability within the Latino commu
nity, a group of Latino students
unveiled plans last night to unify
Stanford's Latino community un
der a single umbrella organiza
tion, the Stanford Latino Stu
dents Alliance (SaLSA).
"Now there is a lack of ac
countability; no one is in a posi

(Latino) community," junior
Rudy Fuentes said at a meeting
last night to discuss the plans for
SaLSA. "The basic function of
|SaLSA| is to provide responsible

The three levels will also be in
fluenced and checked by existing
Latino organizations that are ex

according to Fuentes.
"We need some form of elected
hierarchy that can give us effec

ments of movements," Fuentes
said. "No longer by de facto can a
single group speak for the entire
commumiy."
Some students expressed con
cern, however, that the elected
officers would seize power,
thereby diminishing the impor
tance of the council of presidents.
"1 get squeamish when power
gets so centralized that elected of
ficials can go unchecked," sopho
more Valentin Aguirre said.
"Impeachments are not frequent.
It is harder to correct problems in
this situation than when power is
diffused."
A number of Latino students
shared Aguirre's reluctance to
support Fuentes' plan for the
eight elected officers, prefering a
"concilio" approach in which
open forums would be conducted
to make decisions.
Under this approach, students
holding the positions analagous to
