# Latino students plan new group
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
Responding to what they allege
is a lack of structure and account
ability within the Latino commu
nity, a group of Latino students
unveiled plans last night to unify
Stanford's Latino community un
der a single umbrella organiza
tion, the Stanford Latino Stu
dents Alliance (SaLSA).
"Now there is a lack of ac
countability; no one is in a posi
tion to speak for the entire
(Latino) community," junior
Rudy Fuentes said at a meeting
last night to discuss the plans for
SaLSA. "The basic function of
|SaLSA| is to provide responsible
statements on behalf of the
Latino community."
Fuentes proposed a three-part
plan for community government
that would balance itself through
a system of checks and balances.
This system would ensure that of
ficials elected under the new plan
would be held accountable to the
community. The three parts are a
group of eight elected officers, a
council of presidents made up of
representatives of the individual
Latino groups and monthly com
munity meetings for popular in
put.

The three levels will also be in
fluenced and checked by existing
Latino organizations that are ex
pected to remain autonomous,
according to Fuentes.
"We need some form of elected
hierarchy that can give us effec
tive and responsible endorse
ments of movements," Fuentes
said. "No longer by de facto can a
single group speak for the entire
commumiy."
Some students expressed con
cern, however, that the elected
officers would seize power,
thereby diminishing the impor
tance of the council of presidents.
"1 get squeamish when power
gets so centralized that elected of
ficials can go unchecked," sopho
more Valentin Aguirre said.
"Impeachments are not frequent.
It is harder to correct problems in
this situation than when power is
diffused."
A number of Latino students
shared Aguirre's reluctance to
support Fuentes' plan for the
eight elected officers, prefering a
"concilio" approach in which
open forums would be conducted
to make decisions.
Under this approach, students
holding the positions analagous to
Fuentes' council of presidents
would serve as administrators.
They would serve as links of com
munication and would not have
the power to speak for the Latino
community, Aguirre said.
But junior Patty Davis coun
tered Aguirre's argument. "It is
possible to have retractments of
the statements of the elected offi
cials when they are contrary to
what the community believes, and
there's always the possibility of
impeachment," she said.
There is some concern that stu
dents in MEChA, a powerful
Stanford Latino organization, will
block the formation of the
umbrella group.
"There may be one or two
MEChA people who will try to
block the umbrella group,"
Aguirre said. "There may be
heavy debate, but there will be a

positive result."
Representatives of MEChA
could not be reached for com
ment last night.
Although the students favoring
some form of umbrella organiza
tion are still somewhat divided on
the issue of which structure would
be best, leaders are optimistic
that the two sides will be able to
compromise and submit a unified
proposal to the Latino commu
nity early this quarter.
"I think there will be compro
mise," Aguirre said. "A final
umbrella group will result
sometime in the future, but it is
not something that should be
rushed."
Fuentes stressed the impor
tance of having a unified plan. "If
we come to the community
meeting with one plan, we will
look much stronger and have a
much better chance of getting the
structure implemented."
The name Stanford Latino Stu
dent Alliance (SaLSA) was cho
sen for two reasons. First, it is a
good acronym. Second, there is

already an existing umbrella or
ganization called SaLSA that was
created last year to pool the
budgets of the numerous Latino
groups, Fuentes said.
"The already existing SaLSA
has no real structure," Fuentes
said. "There are two treasurers,
but that's all. What we're plan
ning to do is add structure to this
already existing organization."
Based on his consultations with
University officials, Fuentes has
estimated that almost 600 Stan
ford students consider themselves
Latinos.
Other autonomous Latino
groups besides MEChA include
the Barrio Assistance program;
Chicanos in Health Education
(CHE); Stanford Society of
Chicano Engineers and Scientists;
Project Motivation, a program to
get high school students inter
ested in higher education; and the
Chicano Student Activities Com
mittee.
The students have not yet
decided when they will hold a
vote on the plan.

sen for two reasons. First, it is a
good acronym. Second, there is

already an existing umbrella or
ganization called SaLSA that was
created last year to pool the
budgets of the numerous Latino
groups, Fuentes said.
"The already existing SaLSA
has no real structure," Fuentes
said. "There are two treasurers,
but that's all. What we're plan
ning to do is add structure to this
already existing organization."
Based on his consultations with
University officials, Fuentes has
estimated that almost 600 Stan
ford students consider themselves
Latinos.
Other autonomous Latino
groups besides MEChA include
the Barrio Assistance program;
Chicanos in Health Education
(CHE); Stanford Society of
Chicano Engineers and Scientists;
Project Motivation, a program to
get high school students inter
ested in higher education; and the
Chicano Student Activities Com
mittee.
The students have not yet
decided when they will hold a
vote on the plan.
Responding to what they allege
is a lack of structure and account
ability within the Latino commu
nity, a group of Latino students
unveiled plans last night to unify
Stanford's Latino community un
der a single umbrella organiza
tion, the Stanford Latino Stu
dents Alliance (SaLSA).
"Now there is a lack of ac
countability; no one is in a posi
tion to speak for the entire
(Latino) community," junior
Rudy Fuentes said at a meeting
last night to discuss the plans for
SaLSA. "The basic function of
|SaLSA| is to provide responsible
statements on behalf of the
Latino community."
Fuentes proposed a three-part
plan for community government
that would balance itself through
a system of checks and balances.
This system would ensure that of
ficials elected under the new plan
would be held accountable to the
community. The three parts are a
group of eight elected officers, a
council of presidents made up of
representatives of the individual
Latino groups and monthly com
munity meetings for popular in
put.

The three levels will also be in
fluenced and checked by existing
Latino organizations that are ex
pected to remain autonomous,
according to Fuentes.
"We need some form of elected
hierarchy that can give us effec
tive and responsible endorse
ments of movements," Fuentes
said. "No longer by de facto can a
single group speak for the entire
commumiy."
Some students expressed con
cern, however, that the elected
officers would seize power,
thereby diminishing the impor
tance of the council of presidents.
"1 get squeamish when power
gets so centralized that elected of
ficials can go unchecked," sopho
more Valentin Aguirre said.
"Impeachments are not frequent.
It is harder to correct problems in
this situation than when power is
diffused."
A number of Latino students
shared Aguirre's reluctance to
support Fuentes' plan for the
eight elected officers, prefering a
"concilio" approach in which
open forums would be conducted
to make decisions.
Under this approach, students
holding the positions analagous to
Fuentes' council of presidents
would serve as administrators.
They would serve as links of com
munication and would not have
the power to speak for the Latino
community, Aguirre said.
But junior Patty Davis coun
tered Aguirre's argument. "It is
possible to have retractments of
the statements of the elected offi
cials when they are contrary to
what the community believes, and
there's always the possibility of
impeachment," she said.
There is some concern that stu
dents in MEChA, a powerful
Stanford Latino organization, will
block the formation of the
umbrella group.
"There may be one or two
MEChA people who will try to
block the umbrella group,"
Aguirre said. "There may be
heavy debate, but there will be a

positive result."
Representatives of MEChA
could not be reached for com
ment last night.
Although the students favoring
some form of umbrella organiza
tion are still somewhat divided on
the issue of which structure would
be best, leaders are optimistic
that the two sides will be able to
compromise and submit a unified
proposal to the Latino commu
nity early this quarter.
"I think there will be compro
mise," Aguirre said. "A final
umbrella group will result
sometime in the future, but it is
not something that should be
rushed."
Fuentes stressed the impor
tance of having a unified plan. "If
we come to the community
meeting with one plan, we will
look much stronger and have a
much better chance of getting the
structure implemented."
