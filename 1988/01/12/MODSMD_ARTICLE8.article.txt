Suspect nabbed in disco bombing
BONN, West Germany — West German police, acting on a
tip, arrested a 27-year-old woman yesterday on suspicion of
planting a bomb in a West Berlin discotheque in 1986 that killed
two U.S. servicemen and a Turkish woman and injured more
than 200 other people.
Authorities suggested that Christine Gabriele Endrigkeit was
apprehended because of her connection with a Jordanian con
victed of a previous bombing in West Berlin — which allegedly
was masterminded by Syrian intelligence.
The United States blamed the disco attack on Libya, and
launched an air strike 10 days later on the Libyan capital of
Tripoli and the city of Benghazi in retaliation. But Endrigkeit's
purported Syrian connection raised questions as to which nation
might have been behind the disco bombing.
In Ottawa, Canada, visiting Secretary of State George Shultz
said that the evidence is clear and convincing that Libya was im
plicated in the disco attack. Shultz said that if some other nation
were also involved, that "doesn't lessen the Libyan complicity."
Shortly after the attack at the La Belle disco on April 5, 1986,
the American government announced that it had irrefutable
evidence that the Libyan government of Col. Moammar Khadafi
was responsible for the bombing. Based on that evidence, the
United States carried out the attacks.
The American government said that it showed to its allies hard
evidence of the Libyan involvement — presumably intercepts of
communications between Tripoli and the Libyan embassy in East
Berlin. This data, however, has never been made public.
Libya has denied any involvement.
Key officials called to lobby trial
WASHINGTON — The secretary of the Army, former secre
tary of the Navy and the ex-chief of the Small Business Adminis
tration are among 24 witnesses who may be called by prosecutors
to testify about alleged lobbying violations involving Lyn Nof
ziger. President Reagan's former political director, it was dis
closed yesterday at the opening of Nofziger's federal court trial.
The former Reagan administration officials will round out a list
of witnesses headed by Attorney General Edwin Meese 111,
whom prosecutors previously announced will be summoned.
Nofziger is charged with four ethics violations in connection with
his post-government lobbying for Wedtech Corp., a scandal
rocked defense contractor, and two other clients.
Nofziger, 63, sporting his traditional rumpled look and
wearing a trademark Mickey Mouse necktie around an un
buttoned collar, shook hands with spectators and declared, "I
think we're going to win this thing."
U.S. District Judge Thomas Flannery began the laborious
process of selecting a jury, which is expected to take three to four
days. Potential jurors were asked to answer a 10-page question
naire on their occupations, backgrounds and political attitudes, a
form that included the question, "Have you or any relative or
close friend ever had a stroke? If so, please explain."
Dow rally assuages market fears
NEW YORK — Investors heaved a collective sigh of relief
ji yesterday as the feared replay of October's stock market
failed to materialize.
After a tentative start, the Dow Jones industrial average hov
ered near Friday's closing level most of the day before sprinting
in the final hour of trading to finish at 1945.13. With the late
afternoon rally in Blue Chip stocks, the closely watched index
recovered 33.82 of the 140 points it lost in Friday's rout — the
third-largest ever.
Wall Streeters had feared the worst after market pundits began
drawing parallels between Friday's stock-price free fall and the
108-point Dow plunge on Friday, Oct. 16, which precipitated
Black Monday. So having braced themselves for another volatile
day, they were greatly cheered by the market's surprising
resiliency yesterday.
"This was supposed to be the end of the world as Wall Street
knows it; instead, it was a non-event," said Thomas Ryan, who
heads equity trading at Kidder, Peabody & Co.
Nevertheless, many traders and analysts remained on tenter
hooks. Their fears: The broader market didn't mirror the Blue
Chips' strength, the trading volume was suspiciously light and the
controversial computerized trading schemes known collectively
as program trading were controlling the day's action.
Court supports federal immunity
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday gave the
U.S. government broad immunity from legal attack, dismissing
suits challenging the open-air testing of the atomic bomb in the
1950s and the mining of Nicaragua's harbors in the 1980s.
The court action strengthens a key exception to the 1946
Federal Tort Claims Act, the law that provides the right to sue
the government for damages "caused by the negligent or wrong
ful act" of a government employee. The exception says the gov
ernment is immune where its employees "perform a discretion
ary function or duty."
According to lawyers for the plaintiffs, the two cases illustrate
the growing tendency of the federal courts to throw out suits
against the government, even where strong U.S. liability is al
leged.
The dismissal of the atomic-testing case ends a suit by 1200
people who were exposed to nuclear fall-out in Utah, Nevada
and Arizona between 1951 and 1962 and who later developed
cancer or leukemia. They charged that federal officials knew of
the health danger of the atomic tests and were negligent in failing
to warn them. The plaintiffs won damages of $2.6 million in an
initial trial, but a federal appeals panel threw out the judgment.
Amoco fined $85 million for spill
CHICAGO — A federal judge yesterday ordered the Amoco
Corp. to pay $85.2 million for decade-old damages caused when
the crippled supertanker Amoco Cadiz drifted into French Brit
tany's rocky coast, spilling 68 million gallons of crude oil along
120 miles of picturesque shoreline in history's most expensive
tanker accident.
The award, believed to be the largest ever in an environmental
case, was far short of the more than $2 billion asked by the
various parties — ranging from the Republic of France to resorts
and fishing villages along the northern French coast — in the
complex litigation
But the decision, coming after years of legal maneuvering and
testimony in U.S. District Court in Chicago where Amoco is
headquartered, pleased neither the nation's fifth-largest oil com
pany nor the scores of French plaintiffs.
All those involved, except the French government which
would receive the bulk of the damage award, said that they would
appeal Judge Frank McGarr's ruling to the U.S. Court of Ap
peals, delaying a final determination for at least another 18
months.
