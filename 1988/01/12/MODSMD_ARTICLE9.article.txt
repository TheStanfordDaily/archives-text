# Three Palestinians killed in unrest

### 
JERUSALEM — Jewish set
tlers yesterday shot dead an Arab
teenager in the first fatality in
volving Israeli civilians since the
demonstrations against the occu
pation began Dec. 9.
Two other Palestinians died
yesterday as a result of clashes
between the Israeli army and
rock-throwing demonstrators,
bringing the death toll to date to
at least 33.
But the fatal shooting of Rabah
Hussein Ghanam, 16, at the vil
lage of Beitin, 10 miles north of
here, added a dangerous ingredi
ent to the current wave of vio
lence.
The incident — on which Is
raeli and Palestinian versions dif

fer — underlined the strain that
has long resulted from the set
tlers' insistence that Jews have
the right to live anywhere in the
territories Israel captured in the
1967 war and the Arabs' resent
ment at the loss of what they con
sider their traditional lands.
About 62,000 Jews live among
1.4 million Palestinians in the oc
cupied territories, perhaps a third
of them in attractively priced sub
urban housing clusters around
Jerusalem.
Many others, like the two men
involved in the Beitin incident
yesterday, belong to the strongly
nationalist Gush Emunim move
ment, which often has established
settlements on previously com

munally held land near Palestin
ian villages, provoking anger
among Arabs there.
Gush Emunim, after the inci
dent, asked for a meeting with
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to
press for the release of the men
involved at Beitin as well as of
Jews convicted of terrorism
against Arabs. It urged a
"massive Jewish settlement"
drive to "prove to the whole
world" that Jews "would not be
broken" in their drive to establish
more settlements in the occupied
territories.
In the Beitin shooting, Pincas
Wallerstein, a prominent leader
of a controversial West Bank
settlement at nearby Ofra, told

police and army investigators that
he opened tire yesterday morning
when the car in which he was
driving with bodyguard Shay Ben
Yosef was mobbed and stoned by
more than a dozen Palestinian
youths at a roadblock.
He was quoted as saying that
he first had fired into the air to
disperse the stone throwers, but
that they had resumed attacking
him when he and his companion
sought to drive off.
Maj. Gen. Avram Mitzna,
commander of Israel's Central
Command, which covers the West
Bank, said initial investigation
showed that the two settlers were
acting in self-defense.
