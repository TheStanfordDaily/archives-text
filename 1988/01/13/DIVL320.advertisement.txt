SPECIAL PROJECTS
Special Projects is an electric project. In different quarters it provides different services. This Winter
Quarterr is busy. A new service, the ASSU Bagel Service, has been created to bring weekend bagels to
foodless dorms and row houses. If interested, contact your RA.
This quarter, two special classes are being offered as well, a Bartending Class and a Wine Tasting Sem
inar. The Bartending Class, first offered last spring, was a very popular offering, so sign up now while
spots are open. You will learn the skills and recipes to mix drinks well enough to be hired as a bartender
this summer. The Wine Tasting Seminar, on the other hand, is brand new. With lots of wine to drink,
there is a minimum age of 21 for the 30 spots in the seminar. You will learn how to taste wines, buy
good wines and labels, and how to read winelists (impressing your friends) at restaurants, while sam
pling some dozen wines per session. We at the ASSU are very excited about these classes. We hope you
will be too. Sign-ups begin Tuesday, January 12 from 12:30-1:00 pm everyday until Friday at the ASSU
in Tresidder.
