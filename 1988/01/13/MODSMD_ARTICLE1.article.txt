# Kennedy seeks smoking limits

The University should ban smoking in all outdoor
facilities with fixed seating. University President
Donald Kennedy said yesterday.
A ban to this effect, recently proposed by a Uni
versity ad hoc committee on smoking guidelines,
would constitute some of the toughest smoking reg
ulations for any stadium in the country, according to
University officials.
"Personally, I believe that people in confined
spaces outdoors, particularly (people) with certain
kinds of health problems, have the right to be free of
the annoyance and health hazard posed by second
hand smoke," Kennedy told The Daily.
The proposed ban would cover football and
baseball games held at Stanford Stadium as well as
events in Frost Amphitheater, such as the spring
Grateful Dead concert.
While most Stanford students do not smoke, a
ban could anger many alumni who do, according to
Sandy Kee, nursing director at Cowell Student
Health Center.
"It's my sense that there are not too many Stan
ford students smoking anymore," Kee said, who has
done clinical work with students trying to quit
smoking. "It would have little effect on the students,
but probably a lot of effect on the alumni."
Approximately six percent of Stanford students
currently smoke, according to Ana Kozlowski, a
Cowell aerobics coordinator.
In 1985 the University banned smoking in all
University buildings with the exception of certain
eating areas and completely enclosed offices.
The proposal to restrict outdoor smoking follows
a University decision last year to limit the amount of
alcohol allowed into the stadium.
Alumni Association Executive Director William
Stone downplayed any possible alumni opposition
to potential smoking restrictions, however, saying
"you can never guess what 125,000 alumni will
think."
Stone added he thought the proportion of alumni
smokers is probably less than the
national average. "It's a group of
better-informed people," he said.
Currently, San Diego's Jack
Murphy Stadium is one of the few

stadiums in the country even to
have designated non-smoking
sections. San Diego Stadium
Business Manager Steve Shushan
said implementing a total ban like
the one Stanford is now consider
ing "would be a problem. You
would probably lose about half of
your regular season ticket
holders."
