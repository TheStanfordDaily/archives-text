# Gorbachev assails Soviet critics

MOSCOW — Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, defending
himself from internal critics on
the left and right, was quoted yes
terday as saying that overcoming
resistance to reform was still the
main task facing the Soviet Union
in the years ahead.
But he warned that disaster
would follow if the Soviet Union
were to abandon his drive for
economic and social restructuring
because opponents are frightened
of sweeping economic and social
changes.
The Soviet leader also said
that, at a Communist Party con
ference called for June, delegates
would consider electoral and jud
icial reforms.
Gorbachev's remarks, in which
he depicted himself as an em
battled leader reaching out for
allies, were delivered last Friday
to editors, publishers and cultural
leaders. A text was distributed
yesterday by the official Tass
news agency.
In the Kremlin equivalent of a
U.S. president's State of the Un

ion address, Gorbachev charged
that some leftist critics were too
impatient and lack the staying
power needed to push through a
program of reforms, and he
upbraided conservatives for op
posing greater democracy in So
viet life.
At times, the Soviet leader ap
peared to be carrying on a public
debate with his second-in
command, Yegor Ligachev, who
has criticized the public airing of
past mistakes in Soviet history,
particularly in the Stalinist era.
Yet Gorbachev also chided
editors for following their per
sonal convictions rather than the
Communist Party line, declaring:
"The Soviet press is not a private
shop. . . . Our people are for
perestroika (restructuring) ... so
let us follow our line for
perestroika."
In his hours-long address, the
Kremlin chief made a biting cri
tique of shortcoming among party
officials, ordinary workers and
bureaucrats. While applauding a
breakthrough in international re

lations and achievements in
agriculture and machine-building,
he said that the reform drive was
just reaching its most difficult
stage.
"The task is indeed a daunting
one," Gorbachev said. "We are
just leaving the period of stagna
tion. . . . We perhaps have not
realized completely how wide
spread various negative
phenomena — parasitic attitudes,
leveling of pay, report padding,
parochialism, illegal actions —
became in the years of stagna
tion."
"Deplorably, a widely current
attitude is that one can work ten
times less, a hundred times less
than others, can do nothing at all,
and at the same time enjoy all the
benefits in the same degree as
people do whose work makes a
large contribution to the
country's development," he
added.
Some milkmaids, he said, earn
600 rubles a month (about three
times the average Soviet monthly
wage of 200 rubles) despite low

milk production on their farms,
he said, yet they resisted efforts to
tie their pay to output of milk.
In contrast, he said, other
workers who produce eight or 10
times the average output are
criticized for getting more pay
than those who don't work so
hard, Gorbachev complained.
While he praised the Commu
nist Party for serious changes for
the better, Gorbachev said that
too often its officials have lagged
behind the times and "there is a
lot of inertia and passive atti
tudes."
During one portion of his
speech, Gorbachev seemed to
challenge a view advanced by
Ligachev, who has complained of
too much reporting in the official
press on negative events and set
backs in Soviet history, such as
the crimes committed during
Joseph Stalin's purges.
"One cannot agree with those
who suggest that we forget history
or use only a certain part of it,"
Gorbachev said.
