## Three top students get Marshall awards 
### Chris Shuttles worth Staff writer 
Ihree Stanford students have
been awarded Marshall scholar
ships tor two years of graduate
study in Great Britain.
Seniors Mare Jacobs, Susan
Reinhold and Jennifer Tucker
will each receive two years tuition
at a British university of his or her
choice, money for books, room
and board, fees, two round-trip
air fares and a personal living
stipend.
According to John Pearson,
acting director of the Bechtel In
ternational Center, all three Stan
ford students who applied were
awarded scholarships this year,
which Pearson believes may be a
first in University history.
Pearson said the scholarships
were established and funded by
the British government as "a
thanks for Marshall Plan aid after
the Second World War."
Jacobs, a biology major, plans
to earn a certificate of
postgraduate study in biochemi
cal evolution at Cambridge Uni
versity.
He said he was "elated and in a
state of shock and disbelief"

when told he was a Marshall win
ner.
Reinhold was staying with a
friend when her family was in
formed of her award last week.
When they finally reached her at
6:45 a.m. Friday, she was
"excited, and of course I couldn't
go back to sleep."
Reinhold, a feminist studies
major, plans to earn a master's
degree in social anthropology at
the University of Sussex.
"Sussex is the perfect place for
me to be for what 1 want to do,"
she said.
Reinhold credited her overseas
study and research with helping
her win the Marshall scholarship.
She has visited Lisbon, Portugal,
for part of her research on politi
cal representation and socioeco
nomic status of women.
"Having been abroad showed I
could survive at a British univer
sity, and doing independent re
search demonstrates initiative,"
she said.
Tucker intends to pursue
master's work at Cambridge Uni
versity leading to a Ph.D. in the
history and philosophy of science.
"I'm excited and surprised
about the award, and I'm really
looking forward to [studying at
Cambridge]," said Tucker, a
human biology major focusing on
the neuropsychology of vision.
Tucker, who hopes eventually
to become a university professor,
spent last summer in British ar
chives researching two 17th cen
tury scientists.
All three winners were also un
successful Rhodes scholar candi
dates, but Pearson emphasized
the vast difference between the
Rhodes program and the Mar
shall program. He said that the
Marshall emphasizes academics
to a higher degree than the
Rhodes. He described all three

Marshall recipients as "first-class
students."
The Rhodes program also
limits candidates to study at Ox
ford. Cambridge or London,
while the Marshall program al
lows students to choose any
British university.
"I'm much happier with win
ning the Marshall's scholarship by
far because Sussex is perfect for
me," Reinhold said.
The three Stanford winners ac
counted for half of the six Mar
shall scholarships awarded in the
Pacific region. A total of 30 Stan
ford students have won Marshall
scholarships since the awards
began in 1953.
The nationwide program
selects winners from the five
regions in the United States
represented by the locations of
the four British consulates and
the embassy in Washington, D.C.
