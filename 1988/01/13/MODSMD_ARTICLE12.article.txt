Addressing dilemmas in inter
national economic development.
Political Science Profs. Richard
Fagen and Robert Packenham
advocated fundamentally differ
ent policies last night at the Law
School.
Packenham defended the
capitalist market system as a
viable way to achieve develop
ment, while Fagen argued that is
sues of development should not
be cast in terms of capitalism vs.
socialism, but rather in terms of
growth vs. social justice.
"Capitalism has been quite suc
cessful," Packenham said. But
Fagen said the current world mar
ket system is an "extraordinarily
sad and sobering story." He said
the "particularly difficult" nature
of this system leaves little room
for "inspiration."
Packenham cited Southeast
Asia's "gang of four" — Hong
Kong, Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan — as positive proof of the
benefits of the capitalist system.
He said the economic progress
these countries have made is due
to the "interaction between de

velopment models . . . and the
flow of ideas from the Third
World into the First World."
Because of this interaction,
Packenham contended, the cur
rent dilemma of development will
be choosing between a system of
pure capitalism or a more mixed
economic system.
In contrast, Fagen argued that
these categories — when set up as
dichotomies, as in Packenham's
analysis — are "wrong" to
describe the problems of develop
ment. Defining the world system
in terms of free enterprise vs.
state control, the market vs.
politics and freedom vs. tyranny is
"extraordinarily misleading,"
Fagen said.
Fagen proposed instead that
the "two dominant clusters of
thought" in development theory
should be "growth and social
justice." Fagen said both Marxists
and liberalists subscribe to these
two ideas.
If growth is the primary goal of
development, Fagen argued, then
"when tough decisions have to be
made, the central investment
ought to go to growth processes."

Political Science Profs. Richard Fagen (standing) and Robert
Packenham debate issues of international development last night
at the Law School.
The social justice school of
thought places "primary empha
sis on questions of distribution
and equity in the system," he
added.
"Those who focus on growth
tend to gravitate to the market
mechanism as the central mecha
nism," Fagen said. "On the other
hand, those who concentrate on
social justice focus on the politics
— the state system — because
they know inevitably that politics
create justice. Politics gives it
back to the workers."
"Either (growth and social
justice) without the other is insuf
ficient in the long term to satisfy
human needs. And that is what it
is all about," Fagen said.
Packenham disagreed, main

taining that the benefits of the
market mechanism outweigh its
problems. "With capitalism we do
have the possibility of economic
dynamism, the possibility of
evolution toward economic
democracy and pluralism, which
we would not have in a socialist
system," he said. "There are
some problems in the longer run
in a socialist system because a
socialist system develops forms of
social inequities."
According to Packenham,
"The state central processes re
quire massive amounts of infor
mation and a heroic process of in
terpreting that information" that
the market can and does do.
The well-attended debate was
the first in a weekly lunchtime se
ries at Bechtel International Cen
ter. The series, sponsored by the
Stanford International Develop
ment Organization, will address
issues of development.
