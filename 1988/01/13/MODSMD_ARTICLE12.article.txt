Addressing dilemmas in inter
national economic development.
Political Science Profs. Richard
Fagen and Robert Packenham
advocated fundamentally differ
ent policies last night at the Law
School.
Packenham defended the
capitalist market system as a
viable way to achieve develop
ment, while Fagen argued that is
sues of development should not
be cast in terms of capitalism vs.
socialism, but rather in terms of
growth vs. social justice.
"Capitalism has been quite suc
cessful," Packenham said. But
Fagen said the current world mar
ket system is an "extraordinarily
sad and sobering story." He said
the "particularly difficult" nature
of this system leaves little room
for "inspiration."
Packenham cited Southeast
Asia's "gang of four" — Hong
Kong, Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan — as positive proof of the
benefits of the capitalist system.
He said the economic progress
these countries have made is due
to the "interaction between de

velopment models . . . and the
flow of ideas from the Third
World into the First World."
Because of this interaction,
Packenham contended, the cur
rent dilemma of development will
be choosing between a system of
pure capitalism or a more mixed
economic system.
In contrast, Fagen argued that
these categories — when set up as
dichotomies, as in Packenham's
analysis — are "wrong" to
describe the problems of develop
ment. Defining the world system
in terms of free enterprise vs.
state control, the market vs.
politics and freedom vs. tyranny is
"extraordinarily misleading,"
Fagen said.
Fagen proposed instead that
the "two dominant clusters of
thought" in development theory
should be "growth and social
justice." Fagen said both Marxists
and liberalists subscribe to these
two ideas.
If growth is the primary goal of
development, Fagen argued, then
"when tough decisions have to be
made, the central investment
ought to go to growth processes."
