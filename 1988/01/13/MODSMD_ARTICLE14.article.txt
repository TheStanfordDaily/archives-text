## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Enforce a strict policy 
### 
The Law School Placement Committee is
soliciting comments until Feb. 1 on a recently
proposed set of procedures for more strictly en
forcing its non-discrimination policy.
The proposal was prompted by a series of con
troversies last fall involving law firms recruiting
on campus that allegedly discriminated in their
treatment of law students or firm employees.
This current proposal, however, does not go far
enough in addressing the sorts of problems that
have plagued enforcement of the non
discrimination policy in the past.
Under the proposal, incidents of alleged dis
criminatory harassment in on-campus interviews
would be dealt with informally through com
plaints to the Law School's career services direc
tor. The director would in turn have authority to
convene a proposed oversight committee, which
would consist of an associate dean, a faculty
member and a student; this committee would de
termine if a policy violation had occurred. If so, a
response by the offending recruiter would be re
quested, and thereafter, "depending on the cir
cumstances," a sanction ranging from a
"admonitory letter" to a ban on interviews by the
offending firm might follow, provided the dean of
the school approves.
This procedure is not dramatically different
from the current unstated process, which has
proven inadequate in remedying the repetition of
subtle discriminatory harassment in on-campus
recruiting.
Under the new proposal, discriminatory con
duct remains undefined. The proposal does not
identify a method for assessing the credibility of a
complaint, and the penalty for a violation is
vaguely contingent upon "the circumstances."
The proposal therefore vests tremendous discre
tion in the oversight committee and in the dean,
who exercises a veto over the process.
The Law School should define what constitutes
a violation of the non-discrimination policy and
should establish a method of assessing the
credibility of complaints. One way of achieving

this might be to consider the precautionary
audiotaping of interviews. Further, sanctions for
violations should be automatic.
Also, under the new proposal the oversight
committee will "consider" sanctions for off
campus violations, irregardless if they involve
Stanford law students.
Two such incidents arose last fall. One in
volved a Stanford student working in Los An
geles over the summer who claimed he received
bad performance evaluations in retaliation for
reporting an offensive racial remark. Another in
volved a large multinational law firm that fired an
attorney who had AIDS. The Law School took
no action in either case. Under the new proposal,
a state agency or court must first determine that
applicable discrimination laws have been broken
before the Law School will respond. But con
ceivably no action might be taken even if a court
found the law violated.
This aspect of the proposal is also inadequate.
It is unwieldy and expensive to demand a legal
ruling of discrimination before the Law School
will censure or ostracize a firm that seems plainly
to have discriminated. Preferably, the Law
School would respond as soon as a court or state
agency initially found a complaint worthy of in
vestigating. The Law School's moral commitment
is more exacting than state legislation, and its en
forcement procedures should reflect this higher
commitment.
While the Law School Placement Committee's
proposed procedures are flawed, they do repre
sent a step in the right direction. The Law School
is attempting to make its commitment to prin
ciples of fairness work in practice.
Finally, the Law School is only one part of the
University. The University's Career Planning and
Placement Center and the Graduate School of
Business should follow the lead of the Law
School and strive to put teeth into their own non
discrimination policies so that they become more
than just empty promises.
