In defense of the
birds at Tresidder
Although I am no orni
thologist, I have, nevertheless, in
the opinion of some, always been
for the birds. I was surprised to
learn that the black birds that eat

the patrons' food outside Tresid
der were being punished further
with poison. I recall an article
published in The Daily on the
Tresidder birds when I was taking
classes at Stanford in the 19605.
The writer observed them as
they waited for their turn at the
leftover food, or perhaps, listened
in on the profound student con

Stanford.
