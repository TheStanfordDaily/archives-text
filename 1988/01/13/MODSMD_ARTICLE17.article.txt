# Sexual harassment begins with rude behavior
## 
### 
Sometimes I wish 1 were an outraged
lesbian feminist.
Oh, not often, mind you, but I really
want to write a column about sexual har
assment, and that's not really a subject
that can be adequately approached from
a male perspective. I just haven't been
there, and so how can 1 talk about what
it's like and what it means to the people it
really affects? Well, perhaps in some fun
damental sense I can't, but the thing is
that it's a really important issue.

I used to think sexual harassment was
something that only happened in the of
fice: you know, the sitcom image of a
boss chasing his secretary around the
desk while she gigglingly fends off his ad
vances. Then when I got to college there
were the titillating rumors of sexual
favors for grades, which always involved
remote, nameless professors and coeds.
Much to my surprise it appears that
sexual harassment is the norm rather

than the exception in our society. In a
recent survey of Los Angeles County
employees, over 30 percent of women re
ported having experienced some form of
sexual harassment at their current job.
Despite that information, the problem
still seemed quite remote to me — until,
that is, 1 started talking to some of my
close female friends about the subject.
Alarmingly, the statistics reported in the
paper seem to underestimate the per
vasiveness of such occurrences. 1 was ap
palled to hear what my friends have had
to put up with throughout their lives, and
even more bothered by both how easily
they accept such behavior toward them
selves and how "normal" such behavior
is regarded to be by our society.
That's why I wish I could give you the
perspective of an outraged lesbian
feminist in this column, for, no matter
what you think of their morality or their
lifestyle, here is a group of people who in
a fundamental sense do not need men,
and that fact is important since it places
them in position to question the basic as
sumptions that underlie male and female
interaction.
Well, certainly things are not that
black and white. However, it is certain
that our society permits some extremely
uncomfortable and rude behavior by men
toward women; it is also true that such

behavior, if analyzed or noticed at all. is
generally regarded as harmless. I mean,
what's the harm in a little dirty joke? So I
pinched her fanny; most women like that
kind of attention. Yeah. I pulled down
her shirt on the steps, but I'd had a
couple of beers — it was a party, you
know. We all sense that a line gets
crossed somewhere, but mostly such in
stances fall on some nebulous grey scale
of morality, and it's quite hard to tell just
exactly where unacceptable behavior
begins.
I'll tell you exactly where I think rude
behavior begins, and I think Miss Man
ners might well support me on this. Rude
behavior, guys, begins precisely when the
woman gets uncomfortable. Whoah,
what a novel idea! You mean we should
treat women colleagues and acquain
tances with respect and dignity — sort of
like guys — even if, you know, we find
them attractive?
Of course, it is not as cut and dried as
that. The fact is men and women interact
on a sexual level even in the most casual
of circumstances. Attractiveness and
desire are often in the background of
even the most platonic of exchanges. The
problem is that the burden of initiating
any kind of social relationship still rests
firmly on the male, and that fact can of
ten result in the kind of misinterpretation

of cues and risk-taking that can, in turn,
result in a woman being made uncom
fortable.
Unfortunately, a lot. indeed most, of
the harassment that occurs has absolutely
nothing to do with a striving toward a so
cial relationship. The old premise that
women can only find true fulfillment in
roles subsidiary and subservient to a man
is still thoroughly ingrained into our soci
ety. In order to be completely fulfilled,
we are taught, a woman must be a lover,
a wife and a mother; and while intellec
tual strides have been taken to determine
what precisely it might mean to be an
equal partner in lovemaking, an equal
partner in homemaking and an equal
partner in child-rearing, the idea that a
woman can exist and be happy without a
man is still quite alien to us. And so, a
man is, in some sense, doing a woman a
favor when he acknowledges her femi
ninity.
Sexual harassment is an ill of a society
that has not entirely reconciled itself to
the idea that women are, in fact, full-
Hedged human beings; and it is not a
problem that will be solved entirely
through legislation, investigation and dis
ciplinary action. The fact is that women
are often as uncomfortable with the
prospect of comforting and resolving
such incidents through official channels

as they arc with the behavior themselves.
When they are in a position where they
are likely going to have to continue to in
teract and work with the individual in
question once the issue has been re
solved, it often seems easier to let things
slide, particularly if they really don't
dislike the guy on other terms.
No, the problem of sexual harassment
must be approached at a much more per
sonal and sensitive level. First, guys must
be made more aware of the types of be
havior that bother women. This means
specific policies must be made by institu
tions on the more glaringly rude types of
behavior, and such policies need to be
actively disseminated and inculcated.
Second, at smaller social levels discrete
channels must be established and main
tained through which incidents and prob
lems can be resolved non-confron
tationally. This means that we as men
must be open to acting as go-betweens if
our women colleagues wish to see a cer
tain behavior cease. The point is that
sexual harassment is really a problem for
all of us, whether or not it happens to us
or by us, because it is, ultimately, about
using people in a genuinely negative
sense.

that is, 1 started talking to some of my
close female friends about the subject.
Alarmingly, the statistics reported in the
paper seem to underestimate the per
vasiveness of such occurrences. 1 was ap
palled to hear what my friends have had
to put up with throughout their lives, and
even more bothered by both how easily
they accept such behavior toward them
selves and how "normal" such behavior
is regarded to be by our society.
That's why I wish I could give you the
perspective of an outraged lesbian
feminist in this column, for, no matter
what you think of their morality or their
lifestyle, here is a group of people who in
a fundamental sense do not need men,
and that fact is important since it places
them in position to question the basic as
sumptions that underlie male and female
interaction.
Well, certainly things are not that
black and white. However, it is certain
that our society permits some extremely
uncomfortable and rude behavior by men
toward women; it is also true that such

behavior, if analyzed or noticed at all. is
generally regarded as harmless. I mean,
what's the harm in a little dirty joke? So I
pinched her fanny; most women like that
kind of attention. Yeah. I pulled down
her shirt on the steps, but I'd had a
couple of beers — it was a party, you
know. We all sense that a line gets
crossed somewhere, but mostly such in
stances fall on some nebulous grey scale
of morality, and it's quite hard to tell just
exactly where unacceptable behavior
begins.
I'll tell you exactly where I think rude
behavior begins, and I think Miss Man
ners might well support me on this. Rude
behavior, guys, begins precisely when the
woman gets uncomfortable. Whoah,
what a novel idea! You mean we should
treat women colleagues and acquain
tances with respect and dignity — sort of
like guys — even if, you know, we find
them attractive?
Of course, it is not as cut and dried as
that. The fact is men and women interact
on a sexual level even in the most casual
of circumstances. Attractiveness and
desire are often in the background of
even the most platonic of exchanges. The
problem is that the burden of initiating
any kind of social relationship still rests
firmly on the male, and that fact can of
ten result in the kind of misinterpretation

of cues and risk-taking that can, in turn,
result in a woman being made uncom
fortable.
Unfortunately, a lot. indeed most, of
the harassment that occurs has absolutely
nothing to do with a striving toward a so
cial relationship. The old premise that
women can only find true fulfillment in
roles subsidiary and subservient to a man
is still thoroughly ingrained into our soci
ety. In order to be completely fulfilled,
we are taught, a woman must be a lover,
a wife and a mother; and while intellec
tual strides have been taken to determine
what precisely it might mean to be an
equal partner in lovemaking, an equal
partner in homemaking and an equal
partner in child-rearing, the idea that a
woman can exist and be happy without a
man is still quite alien to us. And so, a
man is, in some sense, doing a woman a
favor when he acknowledges her femi
ninity.
Sexual harassment is an ill of a society
that has not entirely reconciled itself to
the idea that women are, in fact, full-
Hedged human beings; and it is not a
problem that will be solved entirely
through legislation, investigation and dis
ciplinary action. The fact is that women
are often as uncomfortable with the
prospect of comforting and resolving
such incidents through official channels

as they arc with the behavior themselves.
When they are in a position where they
are likely going to have to continue to in
teract and work with the individual in
question once the issue has been re
solved, it often seems easier to let things
slide, particularly if they really don't
dislike the guy on other terms.
No, the problem of sexual harassment
must be approached at a much more per
sonal and sensitive level. First, guys must
be made more aware of the types of be
havior that bother women. This means
specific policies must be made by institu
tions on the more glaringly rude types of
behavior, and such policies need to be
actively disseminated and inculcated.
Second, at smaller social levels discrete
channels must be established and main
tained through which incidents and prob
lems can be resolved non-confron
tationally. This means that we as men
must be open to acting as go-betweens if
our women colleagues wish to see a cer
tain behavior cease. The point is that
sexual harassment is really a problem for
all of us, whether or not it happens to us
or by us, because it is, ultimately, about
using people in a genuinely negative
sense.

Sometimes I wish 1 were an outraged
lesbian feminist.
Oh, not often, mind you, but I really
want to write a column about sexual har
assment, and that's not really a subject
that can be adequately approached from
a male perspective. I just haven't been
there, and so how can 1 talk about what
it's like and what it means to the people it
really affects? Well, perhaps in some fun
damental sense I can't, but the thing is
that it's a really important issue.

I used to think sexual harassment was
something that only happened in the of
fice: you know, the sitcom image of a
boss chasing his secretary around the
desk while she gigglingly fends off his ad
vances. Then when I got to college there
were the titillating rumors of sexual
favors for grades, which always involved
remote, nameless professors and coeds.
Much to my surprise it appears that
sexual harassment is the norm rather

than the exception in our society. In a
recent survey of Los Angeles County
employees, over 30 percent of women re
ported having experienced some form of
sexual harassment at their current job.
Despite that information, the problem
still seemed quite remote to me — until,
that is, 1 started talking to some of my
close female friends about the subject.
Alarmingly, the statistics reported in the
paper seem to underestimate the per
vasiveness of such occurrences. 1 was ap
