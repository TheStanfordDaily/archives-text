## Obligation of living in society 
### 
I recently read in this space
(Daily, Jan. 5, "Corporate
America kills individuality") that
"those who enter into corporate
America are trained not to do
what they like, but to do what the
corporation demands." This
should not he a surprise to
anyone who has worked for a
living.

I can think of a few things I
"like" less than routinely spend
ing 40 hours a week of my time in
a 100-degree room, wearing
earplugs and goggles, and watch
ing a machine make 1350 aerosol
cans a minute. I certainly would
never have done it were I not
being paid a lot of money, money
that allowed me to spend the
other three quarters of my time in
a much more pleasant fashion.
Some of the people I worked
with had been there 30 years and
would probably stay a total of 45
or 50, but they did not feel they
performed a "meaningless task
from ft a.m. to 5 p.m. without
question because the corporate

structure demands that it be that
way." At the end of a day, they
had truckloads full of future con
sumer products as evidence of
what they were contributing to
society.
Is this inherently wrong? Are
these people being grossly
deceived by the faceless evil
bosses of rapacious capitalism? I
think not. They have a special un
derstanding of the way the world
really works and their place in it.
Classes in philosophy, political
science or sociology don't fully
impress a student with the fact
that "somebody's sweat went into
everything I consume."
The comedians Bob and Ray
do a wonderful routine about a
paper clip factory that makes its
product the old-fashioned way,
with craftsmanship and hand
labor. Unfortunately, this means
that its most productive laborers
make four paper clips a week.
The factory can't pay very much
(after all, these people really can't
buy from the rest of society more
than they produce for it); but that
isn't a problem — they live in the
caves outside of town.
At a different point in my
career, I was an apprentice
carpenter. Outdoor work, the

chance to learn a skill, to work
with people who care about the
"quality" of what they build?
Yes, it had the potential to be all
that, and there was no "corporate
system" imposed to corrupt. The
picture TV commercials show is
closer to the truth — guys in a
hurry to slap it together so they
can head off for a beer. Why? Be
cause work is not fun.
Now I'm learning to be a
physicist. One of the lessons is
that "work equals force against
resistance times distance prog
ressed." True, it's a different use
of the word, but it's still apt. If it's
not hard, it's not work — it's
something that would probably

get done anyway.

An even smaller number actually
create things of value for the rest
of us at the same time. A Stanford
education does not entitle us to
this position — we have to work
for a living. In fact, we owe it to
society — the people around us
— to work, to add something to
compensate for what we take out
of the world. We can choose
whether we produce cans, knowl
edge, houses, tax forms or happy
kids, but the basic obligation
remains.
