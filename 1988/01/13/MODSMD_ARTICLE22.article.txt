## From Tahoe to Jackson Hole Experts name their top ski spots 
### Tim Marklein 
Now is the time for all good
men, and women, to sharpen the
edges on their skis, throw on a
pair of long johns and a ski jacket
and embark on a journey to ex
perience the thrill of downhill
skiing.
The slopes are more than
ready, with some of the best snow
in years. A source at Squaw Val
ley said conditions there are
definitely far ahead of where they
were at this time last year. So the
only thing holding you back is de
ciding where to go.
When looking for the best
place to ski, it makes sense to ask
those who have skied the best. At
Stanford, that means talking to
the University's very own ski
team. Even though some of their
recommendations are the old
standbys, some of their top
choices may come as a surprise.
Although the team practiced at
Soda Springs over winter break,
the resort did not appear to top
their list of favorites. Soda
Springs runs only three chair lifts
for its limited number of slopes,
leading junior team captain Chip
Hazard to decide that the resort
was too small to recommend.
Another team member, sopho
more Tricia Turner, warned
against being persuaded by Soda
Springs' cheap $15 lift ticket.
"It's worth the extra $10 to ski
more than one or two runs. With
Sugar Bowl right down the street,
1 don't see why anyone besides us
was there."
Tahoe provides better slopes at
a number of good resorts. These
include Alpine Meadows, Heav
enly Valley, Kirkwood, North
star, Sierra and Squaw Valley.
Junior captain Brad Swett,
senior Dale Wang and junior

Brian Karr were unanimous in
naming Alpine Meadows as their
favorite place to ski — specifically
recommending the runs off
Scott's Chair. "If it's dumping
hard, and there is deep snow,"
Swett said, "that's the best."
Hazard agreed that the runs

reached by Scott's Chair, espe
cially Sherwood Bowl, deserve a
little extra recognition. "It takes a
while to get to, but it's well worth
it."
Though Alpine Meadows is of
ten not atop the list of Stanford
students' favorite places to ski.

Hazard said "more distinct runs"
make it his favorite. "Going from
slope to slope is easier. There is a
lot more room to do some really
good skiing. You can explore
forever," he said.

Avoiding the crowds is another
positive for Alpine. Hazard ex
plained that Alpine is "a local
type hill" that does not get as
crowded as certain heavy tourist
areas like Squaw and Heavenly.
On the south side of Lake
Tahoe, Hazard's pick is
Kirkwood, which he described as
"really good all around. It has a
lot of good steeps, and it's
cheaper " Lift tickets cost $22 at
Kirkwood, making believers out
of those who balk at the $26-$3O
tickets at most other resorts.
Squaw Valley is another terrific
resort that received high recom
mendations from the ski team.
Freshman Brooke Hart said
Squaw is her Tahoe favorite.
"Squaw has the best facility for
sure. The buildings are nicer, and
the slopes are nicer," she said.
The resort's expansiveness made
sophomore Jeff Pickett call it an
ideal place for a wide range of
skiing.
Team members cited the $30
price tag for lift tickets and the
generally crowded conditions at
Squaw as drawbacks. Squaw's
short lift lines can be misleading.
Hazard warned. "Lift lines move
really fast, but the slopes get
overly crowded."
Heavenly Valley is another
highly frequented resort, but Hart
said, "Heavenly needs a lot of
snow to be good."

The slopes are geared more for
beginners and intermediates; hut
tremendous scenery has made the
area very popular. "It definitely
has the best view," Hart said.
"Many people go there to not ski.
If you're looking for a popular
spot with some nightlife, that's
the place to go."
Hazard mentioned a few other
spots he considers worth a visit.
"Bear Valley is the closest moun
tain to Stanford, just southwest of
Kirkwood. It has a wide variety of
trails and may he a good place for
dorm trips, especially because of
cabins in the area."
"If you're thinking about day
tripping, Sugar Bowl's good.
Also, Boreal is a really nice hill
for beginners," Hazard added.
Although Tahoe is the most
frequented ski area for Stanford
students, Hart mentioned a non-
Tahoe favorite that she feels tops
them all. Mammoth Mountain, in
the southwest Sierras, is, she said,
her secret equivalent to a skier's
paradise.
Since Mammoth lies six hours
away, taking a two-day trip would
not be worth the long drive. Hart
said. "But if you have three full
skiing days and are willing to
drive two extra hours, it is
definitely worth it. When Mam
moth gets good snow, it's proba
bly the best ski resort in the
country."
Besides the terrific skiing, Hart
said she likes the Mammoth at
mosphere better than Tahoe's.
"The city revolves around the
mountain, so there is a lot more
to do at night." While Tahoe's ac
tivity is spread all around the

lake, Mammoth is "more of a
resort place that's concentrated,"
she said.
Another advantage to that con
centration is the ability to stay
right on the mountain, Hart said.
Aspen Creek and Summit, two
large condominium complexes,
are situated right off one of the
chair lifts. This makes it possible,
she said, to wake up in the morn
ing, slap on a pair of skis and start
the day going downhill.
If you have more time on your
hands you should take advantage
of offerings in Utah and
Colorado, Swett suggested.
Colorado's Steamboat Springs
and Utah's Alta are especially
good resorts, he said. "Steamboat
has great tree skiing, and Alta has
the best powder-bowl skiing for
your money."
While these two states have
some enticing opportunities,
Swett, Wang and Karr agreed
that a renowned Wyoming resort
tops them all. "We're all lusting
to go to Jackson Hole," Swett
said.
Although longer trips can pro
vide a more challenging variety
for the avid skier, the proximity
of Tahoe and Mammoth create a
terrific opportunity for students
with only two or three days to ski.
As Sophomore Tricia Turner
said, "Anyone can go on any
weekend."
With a promising season ex
pected thanks to large amounts of
early snowfall. Hazard recom
mends taking advantage of the
opportunity. "Right now it's
looking like a really good season
that should last."

her secret equivalent to a skier's
paradise.
Since Mammoth lies six hours
away, taking a two-day trip would
not be worth the long drive. Hart
said. "But if you have three full
skiing days and are willing to
drive two extra hours, it is
definitely worth it. When Mam
moth gets good snow, it's proba
bly the best ski resort in the
country."
Besides the terrific skiing, Hart
said she likes the Mammoth at
mosphere better than Tahoe's.
"The city revolves around the
mountain, so there is a lot more
to do at night." While Tahoe's ac
tivity is spread all around the

lake, Mammoth is "more of a
resort place that's concentrated,"
she said.
Another advantage to that con
centration is the ability to stay
right on the mountain, Hart said.
Aspen Creek and Summit, two
large condominium complexes,
are situated right off one of the
chair lifts. This makes it possible,
she said, to wake up in the morn
ing, slap on a pair of skis and start
the day going downhill.
If you have more time on your
hands you should take advantage
of offerings in Utah and
Colorado, Swett suggested.
Colorado's Steamboat Springs
and Utah's Alta are especially
good resorts, he said. "Steamboat
has great tree skiing, and Alta has
the best powder-bowl skiing for
your money."
While these two states have
some enticing opportunities,
Swett, Wang and Karr agreed
that a renowned Wyoming resort
tops them all. "We're all lusting
to go to Jackson Hole," Swett
said.
Although longer trips can pro
vide a more challenging variety
for the avid skier, the proximity
of Tahoe and Mammoth create a
terrific opportunity for students
with only two or three days to ski.
As Sophomore Tricia Turner
said, "Anyone can go on any
weekend."
With a promising season ex
pected thanks to large amounts of
early snowfall. Hazard recom
mends taking advantage of the
opportunity. "Right now it's
looking like a really good season
that should last."
Now is the time for all good
men, and women, to sharpen the
edges on their skis, throw on a
pair of long johns and a ski jacket
and embark on a journey to ex
perience the thrill of downhill
skiing.
The slopes are more than
ready, with some of the best snow
in years. A source at Squaw Val
ley said conditions there are
definitely far ahead of where they
were at this time last year. So the
only thing holding you back is de
ciding where to go.
When looking for the best
place to ski, it makes sense to ask
those who have skied the best. At
Stanford, that means talking to
the University's very own ski
team. Even though some of their
recommendations are the old
standbys, some of their top
choices may come as a surprise.
Although the team practiced at
Soda Springs over winter break,
the resort did not appear to top
their list of favorites. Soda
Springs runs only three chair lifts
for its limited number of slopes,
leading junior team captain Chip
Hazard to decide that the resort
was too small to recommend.
Another team member, sopho
more Tricia Turner, warned
against being persuaded by Soda
Springs' cheap $15 lift ticket.
"It's worth the extra $10 to ski
more than one or two runs. With
Sugar Bowl right down the street,
1 don't see why anyone besides us
was there."
Tahoe provides better slopes at
a number of good resorts. These
include Alpine Meadows, Heav
enly Valley, Kirkwood, North
star, Sierra and Squaw Valley.
Junior captain Brad Swett,
senior Dale Wang and junior

Brian Karr were unanimous in
naming Alpine Meadows as their
favorite place to ski — specifically
recommending the runs off
Scott's Chair. "If it's dumping
hard, and there is deep snow,"
Swett said, "that's the best."
Hazard agreed that the runs

reached by Scott's Chair, espe
cially Sherwood Bowl, deserve a
little extra recognition. "It takes a
while to get to, but it's well worth
it."
Though Alpine Meadows is of
ten not atop the list of Stanford
students' favorite places to ski.

Hazard said "more distinct runs"
make it his favorite. "Going from
slope to slope is easier. There is a
lot more room to do some really
good skiing. You can explore
forever," he said.

Avoiding the crowds is another
positive for Alpine. Hazard ex
plained that Alpine is "a local
type hill" that does not get as
crowded as certain heavy tourist
areas like Squaw and Heavenly.
On the south side of Lake
Tahoe, Hazard's pick is
Kirkwood, which he described as
"really good all around. It has a
lot of good steeps, and it's
cheaper " Lift tickets cost $22 at
Kirkwood, making believers out
of those who balk at the $26-$3O
tickets at most other resorts.
Squaw Valley is another terrific
resort that received high recom
mendations from the ski team.
Freshman Brooke Hart said
Squaw is her Tahoe favorite.
"Squaw has the best facility for
sure. The buildings are nicer, and
the slopes are nicer," she said.
The resort's expansiveness made
sophomore Jeff Pickett call it an
ideal place for a wide range of
skiing.
Team members cited the $30
price tag for lift tickets and the
generally crowded conditions at
Squaw as drawbacks. Squaw's
short lift lines can be misleading.
Hazard warned. "Lift lines move
really fast, but the slopes get
overly crowded."
Heavenly Valley is another
highly frequented resort, but Hart
said, "Heavenly needs a lot of
snow to be good."

The slopes are geared more for
beginners and intermediates; hut
tremendous scenery has made the
area very popular. "It definitely
has the best view," Hart said.
"Many people go there to not ski.
If you're looking for a popular
spot with some nightlife, that's
the place to go."
Hazard mentioned a few other
spots he considers worth a visit.
"Bear Valley is the closest moun
tain to Stanford, just southwest of
Kirkwood. It has a wide variety of
trails and may he a good place for
dorm trips, especially because of
cabins in the area."
"If you're thinking about day
tripping, Sugar Bowl's good.
Also, Boreal is a really nice hill
for beginners," Hazard added.
Although Tahoe is the most
frequented ski area for Stanford
students, Hart mentioned a non-
Tahoe favorite that she feels tops
them all. Mammoth Mountain, in
the southwest Sierras, is, she said,
her secret equivalent to a skier's
paradise.
