## From Tahoe to Jackson Hole Experts name their top ski spots 
### Tim Marklein 
Now is the time for all good
men, and women, to sharpen the
edges on their skis, throw on a
pair of long johns and a ski jacket
and embark on a journey to ex
perience the thrill of downhill
skiing.
The slopes are more than
ready, with some of the best snow
in years. A source at Squaw Val
ley said conditions there are
definitely far ahead of where they
were at this time last year. So the
only thing holding you back is de
ciding where to go.
When looking for the best
place to ski, it makes sense to ask
those who have skied the best. At
Stanford, that means talking to
the University's very own ski
team. Even though some of their
recommendations are the old
standbys, some of their top
choices may come as a surprise.
Although the team practiced at
Soda Springs over winter break,
the resort did not appear to top
their list of favorites. Soda
Springs runs only three chair lifts
for its limited number of slopes,
leading junior team captain Chip
Hazard to decide that the resort
was too small to recommend.
Another team member, sopho
more Tricia Turner, warned
against being persuaded by Soda
Springs' cheap $15 lift ticket.
"It's worth the extra $10 to ski
more than one or two runs. With
Sugar Bowl right down the street,
1 don't see why anyone besides us
was there."
Tahoe provides better slopes at
a number of good resorts. These
include Alpine Meadows, Heav
enly Valley, Kirkwood, North
star, Sierra and Squaw Valley.
Junior captain Brad Swett,
senior Dale Wang and junior

Brian Karr were unanimous in
naming Alpine Meadows as their
favorite place to ski â€” specifically
recommending the runs off
Scott's Chair. "If it's dumping
hard, and there is deep snow,"
Swett said, "that's the best."
Hazard agreed that the runs

reached by Scott's Chair, espe
cially Sherwood Bowl, deserve a
little extra recognition. "It takes a
while to get to, but it's well worth
it."
Though Alpine Meadows is of
ten not atop the list of Stanford
students' favorite places to ski.

Hazard said "more distinct runs"
make it his favorite. "Going from
slope to slope is easier. There is a
lot more room to do some really
good skiing. You can explore
forever," he said.
