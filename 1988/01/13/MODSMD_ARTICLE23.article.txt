### Thomas Vajda Staff writer 
For Gregorz Babinski it's
been a long journey from his
native Babino — a small, rural
village of 150 in the northeast
of Poland — to a a career in
academia.
Currently a visiting scholar
in sociology, Babinski years
ago was forced to stop out of
school for six years after finish
ing grammar school.
Nevertheless, he managed to
educate himself by reading
college-level texts during the
long winter months of inac
tivity on his family's farm.
As a result, by the time he
was 19 years old, Babinski was
able to pass two exams which
exempted him from his first
two years of high school. After
completing two years of eve
ning classes, he graduated only
two or three years behind most
of his peers.
Since receiving both his
master's degree and his doc
torate from the Jageillonian
University, Babinski has
remained with the university as
an assistant professor at the
Polonia Research Institute in
Krakow.
Through his position as the
director of all summer pro
grams for foreign students at
the Jageillonian Univeristy,
Babinski initially came in con
tact with Stanford as the first
director of the university's
summer program in Krakow in
1986.
In 1987 he was invited to
come to Stanford as a visiting
scholar.
Babinski described his ex
perience at Stanford so far as
quite positive. "I like [Stan
ford] because it has given me

what I needed . . . comfort,
weather, great libraries and in
dependence."
In addition to Stanford's
creature comforts, Babinski
also said he enjoys the open in
tellectual atmosphere here, as
well as the variety of attitudes
and ethnicities that coexist
here.
"I like it because so much is
going on," he said.

Babinski spends much of his
time doing research on eth
nicity in industrialized societies
and said he hopes to publish a
textbook containing some of
his findings.
He is also teaching a class.
Sociology 148W, Polish Iden
tity and Change in National
Ideology, which he describes as
"an analysis of the state of
mind, the social consciousness
(of contemporary Polish soci
ety) from an ethnic point of
view."
So far, student interest in the


Gregorz Babinski
class has not been great, he said,
adding that although he doesn't
have a crowd, he "didn't expect
one." The narrowness and
specificity of the topic probably
discouraged many students, he
said.
As a student during the period
of social unrest in Poland in 1968,
Babinski took part in anti
government protests and
demonstrations.
Yet only a few years later, in
the early 19705, he and many of
his colleagues joined the Polish
Communist Party. According to
Babinski, their hope was to ob
tain gradual reform and change
from within the party and to serve
as internal opposition to the dom
inant political structure.
"1 believed, at that time, that
the party could and should be
transformed, should be improved,
and that the leading role of the
party is something that is a part of
a reality which could not be
changed," he said.
According to Babinski, this
policy achieved modest success,
but the declaration of martial law
in Poland in December 1981
changed Babinski's belief that
real reforms could be made from
within the party.
Soon after martial law was
declared, Babinski resigned from
the party. At that time, he said, "I
believed the only way to have an
influence on Polish political

reality was being within the party.
"Now I know that Polish reality
could be different, and I can do
more and better being outside the
party," he said.
Although he said he believes he
was correct in leaving the party,
Babinski defended his initial deci
sion to join as one based on a
time and context that has since
changed dramatically.
Babinski said that, in a sense,
he feels that his personal experi
ences reflect the complexity of
the political and social situation in
Poland.
According to Babinski, many
Poles today have a "con

sciousness (that) is mixed with
different orientations. Many
people in Poland . . . don't accept
fully their system of government,
but on the other side they know
that solutions could be achieved
by slow and complicated evolu
tion, (rather) than by radical
revolution."
Babinski will speak tomorrow
night at Bechtel International
Center as part of a panel discus
sion titled "Contemporary
Developments in Poland." Politi
cal Science Prof. Jan Triska and
Maciej Kozlowski, a Fulbright
fellow and journalist from
Krakow, will also participate.

Babinski, their hope was to ob
tain gradual reform and change
from within the party and to serve
as internal opposition to the dom
inant political structure.
"1 believed, at that time, that
the party could and should be
transformed, should be improved,
and that the leading role of the
party is something that is a part of
a reality which could not be
changed," he said.
According to Babinski, this
policy achieved modest success,
but the declaration of martial law
in Poland in December 1981
changed Babinski's belief that
real reforms could be made from
within the party.
Soon after martial law was
declared, Babinski resigned from
the party. At that time, he said, "I
believed the only way to have an
influence on Polish political

reality was being within the party.
"Now I know that Polish reality
could be different, and I can do
more and better being outside the
party," he said.
Although he said he believes he
was correct in leaving the party,
Babinski defended his initial deci
sion to join as one based on a
time and context that has since
changed dramatically.
Babinski said that, in a sense,
he feels that his personal experi
ences reflect the complexity of
the political and social situation in
Poland.
According to Babinski, many
Poles today have a "con

sciousness (that) is mixed with
different orientations. Many
people in Poland . . . don't accept
fully their system of government,
but on the other side they know
that solutions could be achieved
by slow and complicated evolu
tion, (rather) than by radical
revolution."
Babinski will speak tomorrow
night at Bechtel International
Center as part of a panel discus
sion titled "Contemporary
Developments in Poland." Politi
cal Science Prof. Jan Triska and
Maciej Kozlowski, a Fulbright
fellow and journalist from
Krakow, will also participate.

For Gregorz Babinski it's
been a long journey from his
native Babino — a small, rural
village of 150 in the northeast
of Poland — to a a career in
academia.
Currently a visiting scholar
in sociology, Babinski years
ago was forced to stop out of
school for six years after finish
ing grammar school.
Nevertheless, he managed to
educate himself by reading
college-level texts during the
long winter months of inac
tivity on his family's farm.
As a result, by the time he
was 19 years old, Babinski was
able to pass two exams which
exempted him from his first
two years of high school. After
completing two years of eve
ning classes, he graduated only
two or three years behind most
of his peers.
Since receiving both his
master's degree and his doc
torate from the Jageillonian
University, Babinski has
remained with the university as
an assistant professor at the
Polonia Research Institute in
Krakow.
Through his position as the
director of all summer pro
grams for foreign students at
the Jageillonian Univeristy,
Babinski initially came in con
tact with Stanford as the first
director of the university's
summer program in Krakow in
1986.
In 1987 he was invited to
come to Stanford as a visiting
scholar.
Babinski described his ex
perience at Stanford so far as
quite positive. "I like [Stan
ford] because it has given me

what I needed . . . comfort,
weather, great libraries and in
dependence."
In addition to Stanford's
creature comforts, Babinski
also said he enjoys the open in
tellectual atmosphere here, as
well as the variety of attitudes
and ethnicities that coexist
here.
"I like it because so much is
going on," he said.

Babinski spends much of his
time doing research on eth
nicity in industrialized societies
and said he hopes to publish a
textbook containing some of
his findings.
He is also teaching a class.
Sociology 148W, Polish Iden
tity and Change in National
Ideology, which he describes as
"an analysis of the state of
mind, the social consciousness
(of contemporary Polish soci
ety) from an ethnic point of
view."
So far, student interest in the


Gregorz Babinski
class has not been great, he said,
adding that although he doesn't
have a crowd, he "didn't expect
one." The narrowness and
specificity of the topic probably
discouraged many students, he
said.
As a student during the period
of social unrest in Poland in 1968,
Babinski took part in anti
government protests and
demonstrations.
Yet only a few years later, in
the early 19705, he and many of
his colleagues joined the Polish
Communist Party. According to
Babinski, their hope was to ob
tain gradual reform and change
from within the party and to serve
as internal opposition to the dom
inant political structure.
"1 believed, at that time, that
the party could and should be
transformed, should be improved,
and that the leading role of the
party is something that is a part of
a reality which could not be
changed," he said.
