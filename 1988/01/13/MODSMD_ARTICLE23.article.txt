### Thomas Vajda Staff writer 
For Gregorz Babinski it's
been a long journey from his
native Babino — a small, rural
village of 150 in the northeast
of Poland — to a a career in
academia.
Currently a visiting scholar
in sociology, Babinski years
ago was forced to stop out of
school for six years after finish
ing grammar school.
Nevertheless, he managed to
educate himself by reading
college-level texts during the
long winter months of inac
tivity on his family's farm.
As a result, by the time he
was 19 years old, Babinski was
able to pass two exams which
exempted him from his first
two years of high school. After
completing two years of eve
ning classes, he graduated only
two or three years behind most
of his peers.
Since receiving both his
master's degree and his doc
torate from the Jageillonian
University, Babinski has
remained with the university as
an assistant professor at the
Polonia Research Institute in
Krakow.
Through his position as the
director of all summer pro
grams for foreign students at
the Jageillonian Univeristy,
Babinski initially came in con
tact with Stanford as the first
director of the university's
summer program in Krakow in
1986.
In 1987 he was invited to
come to Stanford as a visiting
scholar.
Babinski described his ex
perience at Stanford so far as
quite positive. "I like [Stan
ford] because it has given me

what I needed . . . comfort,
weather, great libraries and in
dependence."
In addition to Stanford's
creature comforts, Babinski
also said he enjoys the open in
tellectual atmosphere here, as
well as the variety of attitudes
and ethnicities that coexist
here.
"I like it because so much is
going on," he said.

Babinski spends much of his
time doing research on eth
nicity in industrialized societies
and said he hopes to publish a
textbook containing some of
his findings.
He is also teaching a class.

"an analysis of the state of
mind, the social consciousness
(of contemporary Polish soci
ety) from an ethnic point of
view."
