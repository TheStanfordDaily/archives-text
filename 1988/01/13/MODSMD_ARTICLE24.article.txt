## 'Housekeeping:' loony but fun 
### Jennifer Reese Staff writer 
"Housekeeping" is an enjoy
able movie with one major point:
to celebrate free-spiritedness.
The plot meanders, always
prettily, and there are some ugly
snags and some painful emotional
moments; but everything points
back to that central happy
message: Be yourself, do what
you want and don't worry what
other people think. This is the
movie's theme, and if you are sus
ceptible to the charms of free
spiritedness, it's a fun show.
The story is based on
Marilynne Robinson's novel
about two orphaned sisters whose
spacey Aunt Sylvie comes to take
care of them. Sylvie has lived her
life hopping trains and sleeping in
boxcars; nothing ties her down.
She has fly-away brown hair and
likes doing strange things: She
wanders around in the woods,
collects newspapers and talks to
strangers. She does not keep a
clean house, and she's an ex
tremely happy person.
A character like this has a lot of
comic potential. Sylvie's habits
are funny, but director Bill For
syth thankfully doesn't make this
into a cute comedy about ec
centricity. There are laughs to be
had, but not so many that it
becomes adorable and unbeliev
able. The movie carefully skirts
the boundaries of comedy.
The focus of the story is on re
actions to Sylvie, primarily the

different ways the two sisters
respond. The older sister, Ruthie,
is homely, tall and stooped; she's
the quintessential clumsy and shy
adolescent girl, and she is timidly
drawn to Sylvie's way of life. She
hasn't got much to lose, anyway;
she hasn't a friend in the whole
town.
The younger sister is prettier
than Ruthie and knows her way
around people. She coldly rejects
both Ruthie and Sylvie and even
tually moves out of the house to
live in a more "normal" home â€”
where there are not 10-foot high
stacks of newspapers, and where
the dishes are washed. The divi
sion is drawn between those who
conform and those who live as
they please. The movie clearly
comes down on the side of the
non-conformists.
Movies and books about truly
free-spirited people are usually
fun. A character as earthy and
free as Sylvie is magical.
Sometimes "Housekeeping" gets
a little too wonderful, but it gen
erally stays within bounds.
It really isn't much more than a
fairy tale in very good disguise,
though; don't try to take the
message home with you. The film
blithely suggests that if you shrug
off peoples' opinions, get in touch
with nature and pull up your
roots, life will be good and easy.
Non-conformism is the way to go.
This is an incredibly seductive
message, and the movie makes it
look miraculously easy and sweet.
There isn't much pain here. The

movie has lots of charm, but not
much muscle. The message is
lovely and dreamy, but don't take
it for more than it's worth.
Christine Lahti as Sylvie is the
crucial performer here. The
movie depends on her making
Sylvie into a believable, appealing
vagabond. However, she isn't
quite right in the role. Another
actress could probably have done
Sylvie better.
Nevertheless, Lahti is an in

credibly attractive actress. Al
though she doesn't perfectly fit
the role, she's always fun to watch
and commands attention. She's
someone you feel you want to
know.
"Housekeeping" is a happy
movie. It's set in a cold, beautiful
mountain town. The central char
acter is earthy and appealing, the
message is simple and attractive.
Taken as a whole, this is a light
but extremely well-made and
uplifting movie.
