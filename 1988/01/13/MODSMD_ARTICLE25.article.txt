# TV is now worse than ever before

Television is worse than ever
before. I realize that that's an
obvious statement, but it's
more true now than it ever has
been.
I have never liked some of
the popular shows that many
people tend to watch, such as
"The Cosby Show" and
"M oonlighting." Actually,
even the people who watch
these shows are now saying
that the two programs are be
coming progressively worse.
NBC's rise to the top can be
attributed to such innovative,
breakthrough shows as "Hill
Street Blues" and"The Cosby
Show," but the first-place net
work has recently been playing
it safe a lot. As a result, NBC
has safeguarded such old, stale
ratings hits as "Family Ties"
and "Night Court"and has
shown less willingness to take
chances on the types of differ
ent, fresh and experimental
programs that catapulted the
network to No. 1 in the first
place.
Second- and third-place
CBS and ABC don't have any
thing to lose, so they've been
more willing to take some cre
ative risks. One of the trendier

experimental concepts is the
rise of the "dramedy," the sit
com without a laugh track.
This nothing-to-lose attitude
has pervaded other aspects of
programming for the two
runner-up networks, opening
the door for more adven
turesome projects. For in
stance, ABC's heavily
promoted "thirtysomething"
has been both praised and
damned for its realistic depic
tion of the problems of
yuppies. CBS's "Wiseguy" has
been receiving notice for its
distinctive mix of well-drawn
characters and explosive vio
lence. CBS's romantic "Beauty
and the Beast" has also been
getting a lot of press for its ap
parent demographic appeal for
women.
Even though I haven't seen
any of these new shows, 1 think
they are steps in the right di
rection. With cable, indepen
dent channels and VCRs
taking up a large share of
prime network television
hours, the big three are going
to have to come up with more
innovative, exciting program
ming if they are going to effec
tively compete for their rapidly
diminishing audience.
One thing's for sure, they
certainly can't do it with the
drivel they're serving up now.
