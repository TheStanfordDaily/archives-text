## Maravich inspired young ball players 
### 
I've never written any kind
of eulogy before, hut then, I'm
young enough so most people
who have influenced me are
still alive.
That's why it came as such a
shock last week when Pete
Maravich died of a heart attack
at the age of 40.

"Pistol" Pete was my all
time favorite basketball player
and the first basketball player I
ever remember watching. He
was, in fact, the main reason I
started playing basketball in
seventh grade, and I even
made sure 1 got the same num
ber (7) and the same position
(point guard) as Pistol Pete. I
recall being ticked off in high
school when I found out that
uniforms were allowed only
combinations of the numbers 1
through 5 because I wanted to
keep Maravich's number.
Pistol Pete had so much style
and flair, dribbling between his
legs and passing behind his
back — he always made it
seem like he could do things
with a basketball that no one
else could do. Labelled as a
"hot dog" in his first few years
with the Atlanta Hawks,
Maravich refused to change his
style of play, consistently was
among the top scorers in the
league and went on to be in
ducted into the NBA Hall of
Fame earlier this year.
Although I was too young to
appreciate it, Maravich was
perhaps the greatest college
player ever and is still the all
time leading scorer in college
ball. There is a story that when
Maravich was a freshman
(freshmen were not allowed to

play on varsity teams back
then), huge crowds flocked
into Louisiana State Univer
sity's gym to see Maravich in
the freshman games and then
filed out before the varsity
played.
Stories like that abound
about Pistol Pete — that's why
he was such an inspiration for
younger players. He was so
dedicated, the legend goes,
that he did finger-tip drills with
a basketball in bed.
My favorite anecdote is how
Pete would get aisle seats at
movies so he could dribble a
basketball in the aisle during
the feature to work on his ball
handling. I always wondered if
he got up and changed aisle
seats when he wanted to
dribble with his other hand.
Still, that's the kind of thing
that gets kids interested in
playing. Pistol Pete may have
been a hot dog, but he was
great for basketball. Maravich
made the game exciting, and
he was the perfect example of
the value of hard work and
dedication for the many
younger players who emulated
him. He wasn't much to look at
tearing down the court with his
floppy hair and floppy socks,
but the amazing things he did!
LSU Coach Dale Brown said
something last week that really
hit me. Essentially Brown said,
"Whenever we see a tousle
haired kid with drooping socks
shooting baskets on a dimly-lit
court long after everyone else
has gone home, we will think
of Pete."
That's so true — that's the
image Pete Maravich has left
us with. He was the dedicated
kid who persevered, perfected
his skills and thrilled everyone
who saw him.
It's nice to know that some
where out there, there are a
million kids just like him,
working on their jump shots in
the dark and doing finger-tip
exercises in bed.
