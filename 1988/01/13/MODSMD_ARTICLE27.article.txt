# Speedy Henning sparks Card
## 
### David Hirning 
As a rule, freshmen should
avoid telling upperclassmen what
to do. There are, however, some
exceptions. You can chalk up
Stanford women's basketball
player Sonja Henning as one of
those exceptions.
The Cardinal, 13-0 and ranked
No. 1 1 in the nation, has discov
ered the "Fountain of Youth" in
a multitude of young players.
Sophomores Jennifer Azzi and
Katy Steding start for Stanford,
while freshmen Celeste Lavoie,
Tammy Svaboda and Trisha
Stevens lead another bumper
crop recruiting class under Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer.
Bursting onto the Cardinal this
year as a starter for an already
loaded Stanford team, Henning, a
5-foot-8 freshman guard who
averages 10 points per game, is
the undisputed catch of this year's
Cardinal freshman corps.
A consensus high school All-
American, she averaged 28.3
points, 10.1 rebounds and 6.5 as
sists per game last year, leading
William Horlick High School to
the Wisconsin state championship
game. She was named "Miss Bas
ketball" in Wisconsin last season
and, undaunted by Pacific 10 bas
ketball. has landed on the Farm
this year with a bang.
"She's the on-the-court lead
er," junior center Jill Yanke said.
"Sonja calls the offense we need
to run, and she's real good at
noticing what the other team's
defense is."
The vital point-guard role only
adds to the Henning's already de
manding task of becoming ad
justed to college ball. She has
made the switch from her off
guard slot in high school to the
point while learning a complex
Stanford system.
"I'm not where 1 want to be,
personally," Henning said. "I'm
improving, but I've got a long way
to go."
Stanford, however, has pro
gressed well enough to post an
unblemished record, thanks to
the work of quality players like
Henning, Azzi and Steding. Hen
ning and Azzi, who averages 14
points and seven assists a game

this season, have Fit together like
a "T," and the duo's scoring and
assist marks have entrenched the
pair as one of the most potent
backcourts in the Pac-10.
Although Henning got a team
high 20 points in the Cardinal's
last game, scoring is of secondary
importance in her game. Yanke,
Steding and Azzi all average
more points than Henning.
But although Henning is a set
up player in the half-court game,
she plays a key role in a major
team weapon — the fast break.
Henning's up-tempo, aggressive
style has led many a Cardinal fast
break this season and makes
Stanford's ability to score in
spurts a devastating offensive
weapon.
"She really helps to pick up the
pace of the game," Azzi said.
"She helps me run more than I
would."
Azzi often finds herself on the
receiving end of a Henning outlet
pass. Everyone who watches her
play speaks of her quickness, an
important ingredient for a fast
break attack. "The coaches want
us to break," Henning said, "and
so Fm always looking for that."
VanDerveer praised Henning's
mental toughness, giving it more
importance than her physical
prowess. "She's very bright, and
she sees things very well," Van-
Derveer said. "Sonja's a definite
reason why we're improved."
But this year's Cardinal is more
than improved; it's exciting. Hen
ning's smart, alert game comple
ments the other players well, and
she's most happy "when we exe
cute our offense and play good
defense."
With no senior in the starting
lineup and 12 players returning
from last season, Stanford is
building a powerhouse program
on the Farm. Henning saw the
seeds of a national power when
she chose Stanford over nation
ally-ranked teams Texas and
Penn State.
"We can play much better than
we are currently playing," Hen
ning said. If Henning is right, the
Pac-10, as well as the rest of the
nation, could be in trouble for
many years to come.

No. 1 1 in the nation, has discov
ered the "Fountain of Youth" in
a multitude of young players.
Sophomores Jennifer Azzi and
Katy Steding start for Stanford,
while freshmen Celeste Lavoie,
Tammy Svaboda and Trisha
Stevens lead another bumper
crop recruiting class under Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer.
Bursting onto the Cardinal this
year as a starter for an already
loaded Stanford team, Henning, a
5-foot-8 freshman guard who
averages 10 points per game, is
the undisputed catch of this year's
Cardinal freshman corps.
A consensus high school All-
American, she averaged 28.3
points, 10.1 rebounds and 6.5 as
sists per game last year, leading
William Horlick High School to
the Wisconsin state championship
game. She was named "Miss Bas
ketball" in Wisconsin last season
and, undaunted by Pacific 10 bas
ketball. has landed on the Farm
this year with a bang.
"She's the on-the-court lead
er," junior center Jill Yanke said.
"Sonja calls the offense we need
to run, and she's real good at
noticing what the other team's
defense is."
The vital point-guard role only
adds to the Henning's already de
manding task of becoming ad
justed to college ball. She has
made the switch from her off
guard slot in high school to the
point while learning a complex
Stanford system.
"I'm not where 1 want to be,
personally," Henning said. "I'm
improving, but I've got a long way
to go."
Stanford, however, has pro
gressed well enough to post an
unblemished record, thanks to
the work of quality players like
Henning, Azzi and Steding. Hen
ning and Azzi, who averages 14
points and seven assists a game

this season, have Fit together like
a "T," and the duo's scoring and
assist marks have entrenched the
pair as one of the most potent
backcourts in the Pac-10.
Although Henning got a team
high 20 points in the Cardinal's
last game, scoring is of secondary
importance in her game. Yanke,
Steding and Azzi all average
more points than Henning.
But although Henning is a set
up player in the half-court game,
she plays a key role in a major
team weapon — the fast break.
Henning's up-tempo, aggressive
style has led many a Cardinal fast
break this season and makes
Stanford's ability to score in
spurts a devastating offensive
weapon.
"She really helps to pick up the
pace of the game," Azzi said.
"She helps me run more than I
would."
Azzi often finds herself on the
receiving end of a Henning outlet
pass. Everyone who watches her
play speaks of her quickness, an
important ingredient for a fast
break attack. "The coaches want
us to break," Henning said, "and
so Fm always looking for that."
VanDerveer praised Henning's
mental toughness, giving it more
importance than her physical
prowess. "She's very bright, and
she sees things very well," Van-
Derveer said. "Sonja's a definite
reason why we're improved."
But this year's Cardinal is more
than improved; it's exciting. Hen
ning's smart, alert game comple
ments the other players well, and
she's most happy "when we exe
cute our offense and play good
defense."
With no senior in the starting
lineup and 12 players returning
from last season, Stanford is
building a powerhouse program
on the Farm. Henning saw the
seeds of a national power when
she chose Stanford over nation
ally-ranked teams Texas and
Penn State.
"We can play much better than
we are currently playing," Hen
ning said. If Henning is right, the
Pac-10, as well as the rest of the
nation, could be in trouble for
many years to come.
