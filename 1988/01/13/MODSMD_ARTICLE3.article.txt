# President at ASSU Senate meeting:
## W. Culture plan faces tough battle 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy last
night told the ASSU Senate that he expects to
see "substantial" Faculty Senate opposition
this month to proposed changes in the Univer
sity's Western Culture requirement.
In the senate meeting last night, Kennedy
said he doesn't plan to go into the Jan. 2 1 Fac
ulty Senate meeting with any arguments on
the matter, hut rather will wait until he hears
some different opinions from faculty mem
bers.
"I generally avoid taking a position on the
senate's discussions before hearing (the fac
ulty's) arguments," Kennedy said.
When ASSU Senator Stacey Leyton asked
him about "the mood of the faculty right
now," Kennedy said that although he has
heard "no soundings of a clear division of the
house,' " he expects "substantial opposition"
to the changes in the Area One (Western Cul
ture) requirement.

The proposed changes, submitted to the
Faculty Senate by the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (CUS), adhere closely to
recommendations made earlier this tall by the
Western Culture Task Force, which has ex
amined the issue of Western Culture reform
over the past year.
In addition to recommending that the name
of the Area One requirement be changed
from "Western Culture" to "Cultures, Ideas,
and Values (CIV)," the CUS proposal also
advocates abolishing the core list of readings
currently required for all Western Culture
tracks. Committees to be established by the
CUS would review reading lists for all tracks
before they are effected in the classroom.
"I feel the administration favors the
changes, and it would help if they came out
and said that," Leyton said.
Despite Kennedy's reluctance to take a po
sition on the issue, Leyton said she was opti
mistic about the proposal's chances for ap
proval.

"I think (the proposal] will pass," she said.
Answering questions from senators, Ken
nedy also said last night that the closure of
Roble Hall would not affect University plans
to be able to provide four years of guaranteed
undergraduate housing by 1991.
"I'm still completely optimistic," he said.
Counting on the construction of new houses
near Governor's corner to accommodate at
least 400 residents, Kennedy said the Univer
sity would meet its four-year guaranteed
housing objective regardless of its decisions
about Roble's future.
Although Kennedy did not provide specifics
on the fate of Roble, he said, "I think we'd all
like to see it re-opened.
"It's definitely one of the older buildings on
campus . . . and has an historic value," he said.
"Restoring Roble ... is economically
feasible."
