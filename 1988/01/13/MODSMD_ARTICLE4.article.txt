# University loses SLAC labor fight
## Fired employee awarded back pay 
### Kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
The University has com
pensated a fired SLAC employee
with $50,000 in back and
severance pay following a compli
cated legal dispute between man
agement and labor at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center,
University attorney Michael Var
tain said yesterday.
Former SLAC worker Larry
Reid claimed he was unjustly
fired after being accused of theft
by an undercover police officer
who himself was later convicted
of stealing SLAC equipment.
Reid and the University agreed
to the monetary settlement
during arbitration proceedings
that concluded in December, six
months after they began. Vartain
said the University still believes
Reid is guilty but that there is not
enough evidence to prove this.
Although he will not return to
SLAC, Reid will be compensated
for lost wages and $7000 in
severance pay. "We treated him
as if he had never been ter
minated," Vartain said.
During an undercover drug in
vestigation of the center two
years ago, San Mateo Sheriffs
Department agent James Walker

accused Reid of stealing and
trying to resell a recording ma
chine from the SLAC warehouse.
Reid lost his job after the accusa
tion was made.
Walker, who had posed as a
SLAC janitor, subsequently
pleaded guilty to charges that he
stole computer and copper ma
chine parts from SLAC while he
was investigating alleged drug use
and thefts by SLAC employees.
Walker was sentenced to one year
in jail.
According to Vartain, the Uni
versity was unable to prove that
Reid tried to sell the recording
machine and was obliged to com
pensate him with $43,000 in back
pay. Vartain represented the Uni
versity in the arbitration proceed
ings.
Vartain said that the nine
month gap between Reid's ter
mination and the beginning of ar
bitration six months ago was
"longer than normal," but attrib
uted the delay to scheduling diffi
culties with the arbitrating judge.
Regarding the Sheriff Depart
ment's handling of the investiga
tion at SLAC, Vartain said, "The
sheriff did not tell SLAC that the
undercover informant was him
self a criminal."
The United Stanford Workers
union (USW), which represented
Reid in the arbitration, has
accused SLAC of bringing in offi
cers to investigate only low-paid
minority workers.
"It (the investigation) was an

entrapment of workers," USW
Field Representative Bill Di Vita
charged.
Vartain disputed this allega
tion, saying that SLAC manage
ment simply requested that the
Sheriff's Department investigate
the "evident" drug problem
among SLAC employees. He
added that the problem was evi
dent because many workers were
in drug rehabilitation programs at
the time.
