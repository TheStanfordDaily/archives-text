## Garrison aims for House 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
Silicon Valley needs to elect a
congressional representative with
an international outlook. Demo
cratic congressional candidate
Jim Garrison said last night at a
meeting of the Stanford Demo
crats.
Speaking at Tresidder Union,
Garrison said his experience as an
international business consultant
makes him "highly qualified" to
seek the Democratic nomination
in the 12th Congressional Dis
trict, which includes Stanford.
Garrison — who lives in Moun
tain View — said he plans to
declare his candidacy Jan. 26.
Garrison said he chose to run in
the 12th District because Silicon
Valley is unique for its many in
ternational ties and its well
educated, affluent constituency.
According to Garrison, Silicon
Valley "is increasingly under
foreign threat" due to its decreas
ing economic edge over foreign

competition. If elected, he said he
plans to support the interests of
Silicon Valley and "intercede on
its behalf" in Congress.
Garrison said he considers him
self a "challenger" for the Demo
cratic nomination, characterizing
his opposition — Democrat Anna
Eshoo — as "the establishment
candidate."
Eshoo, currently a San Mateo
County supervisor, said in a tele
phone interview last night that
she is planning to declare her can
didacy "shortly" and will outline
her position on relevant issues at
that time.
Garrison said his international
experience included time spent
living and traveling abroad, as
well as many projects he worked
on as executive director of inter
national and U.S.-Soviet ex
change programs.
In this position. Garrison
worked often with the Soviet gov
ernment, a background he said
would place him in a unique posi
tion: being the first congressman

to negotiate with the Soviet Un
ion before taking office.
Garrison also said he believes
America "must scale down its
military obsession" and rework
its relationship with the Soviet
Union.
According to senior Mark
Lemley, a political analyst for the
Stanford Democrats and Gar
rison's interim campaign man
ager, Garrison strongly favors
arms control and wants to
promote better U.S.-Soviet rela
tions.
Other issues that concern Gar
rison include education, which he
characterized as "really bad" on a
national level, and environmental
protection, which he strongly
advocates.
Garrison said he and Eshoo
have "different levels of empha
sis" because Eshoo is "a good lo
cal politician with a traditional
Democratic background." but he
is entering the race with more
