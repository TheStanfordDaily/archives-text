U.S. knew of Soviet KAL mistake
WASHINGTON — Contrary to President Reagan's public
statements at the time, U.S. intelligence officials quickly deter
mined in 1983 that the Soviet Union had shot down a Korean Air
Lines 747 without realizing it was a civilian airliner, according to
documents made public yesterday.
On Sept. 4, 1983, four days after 269 people were killed when
the KAL flight strayed into Soviet airspace, the president told
congressional leaders that the United States had "definite proof
that they intentionally shot down that unarmed civilian
airplane."
"There is no way a pilot could mistake this for anything other
than acivilain airliner," Reagan declared a day later, referring to
what he described as "incontrovertible evidence."
These statements appear to be contradicted by recently declas
sified intelligence estimates released by Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-
Ind., which indicate that U.S. officials had concluded as early as
Sept. 2 that the Soviets were unaware that it was a civilian air
liner. The estimates were contained in two letters written about a
year ago to Hamilton by J. Edward Fox, assistant secretary of
state for legislative affairs.
"We had concluded by the second day that the Soviets thought
they were pursuing a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft throughout
most, if not all, of the overflight," Fox wrote. He later added that
"the bottom line is that the Soviets, through their own ineptitude,
probably were not certain what type of aircraft they were shoot
ing down."
Shultz receives Japanese proposals
WASHINGTON — Japanese Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno,
preparing for the first meeting between new Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita and President Reagan, yesterday presented
Secretary of State George Shultz with a package of proposals to
improve U.S.-Japanese relations, including one that could open
the door to American participation in large-scale public works
projects in Japan.
Uno also pledged that Japan would bear the cost of all fringe
benefits paid to some 22,000 Japanese workers at U.S. bases in
Japan by fiscal 1990, paying an extra $200 million. And he in
directly signaled Japan's willingness to lift import quotas on at
least 10 farm products, an issue on which the Reagan administra
tion has placed a high priority.
The initiative drew a favorable reaction from U.S. officials. A
senior administration official, who asked to remain anonymous,
said the improved access to public works projects "will meet
what we want perhaps in the opening of the Japanese market to
American bids and American firms," but added, "That's what we
have to clarify."
With Japan's likely concession on the agricultural import
quotas, "We feel that that matter is pretty well taken care of," he
said.
Reagan team downbeat after trip
WASHINGTON — A top-level Reagan administration group
that visited Central America last week returned less than opti
mistic that the leaders of Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica and
El Salvador would call for renewed aid to the Nicaraguan contras
even if there is little progress on the Central American peace
plan, a senior official said yesterday.
The presidential mission to Central America, led by Lt. Gen.
Colin Powell, Reagan's assistant for national security affairs, was
intended to ensure that the leaders of the four Central American
democracies, who will meet late this week in Costa Rica,
"understand the seriousness of the situation we have in Washing
ton and the difficulty in getting additional funding" from
Congress for the contras, the senior official said.
The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
Powell emphasized to the four that their cooperation was needed
to make U.S. aid for the contras politically feasible, and that the
Sandinista government was unlikely to enact peaceful reforms if
the Contra opposition is allowed to dissipate.
Summarizing Powell's report to President Reagan after the
trip, the official said: "All four of these countries are disturbed
over Sandinista intransigence, but for political reasons," none
can "jump up and say, 'We love the (contra) freedom fighters
and keep the aid coming.' "
Meese calls for more prison funds
WASHINGTON — An additional several billion dollars will
be needed to build and operate new federal prisons over the next
five years, even though the government already has been putting
up penitentiaries at a record pace since 1982, Attorney General
Edwin Meese 111 said yeterday.
In a speech that an administration source said was aimed partly
at reducing resistance from the Office of Management and
Budget to more prison money, Meese attributed the inmate pop
ulation boom to tough crime and anti-drug laws enacted in recent
years.
The attorney general, speaking in Phoenix to a meeting of the
American Correctional Association, also called for more private
employment of prisoners, which he said would benefit compan
ies, the public, correctional institutions and the inmates.
Meese, who in the past has been a staunch advocate of the ad
ministration's emphasis on budgetary restraint, said: "The issue
here is public safety. And the only real option is to build more
prisons."
Airlines had 31 crashes last year
WASHINGTON — U.S. airlines, flying scheduled flights in
large aircraft, had 31 accidents last year — the most in 13 years
— including four crashes that killed 231 people, the government
reported yesterday.
Aviation accident statistics released by the National Transpor
tation Safety Board (NTSB) show that the accident rate for
major airlines and commuter carriers rose slightly last year over
1986, while the rate for air taxis and general aviation declined.
Airlines experienced the most accidents since 1974 when there
were 42, the NTSB said. The board noted that the number of
departures, used to measure the growth in flights, has increased
by almost 50 percent since then.
Among commuter carriers, 35 accidents last year claimed 58
lives. It was the commuters' most accidents since 1980.
Meanwhile, accidents involving small private aircraft dropped
for the fifth consecutive year, from 2581 in 1986 to 2420 last
year, the NTSB said. The number of fatalities also declined, from
955 deaths in 1986 to 788 in 1987.
Ted Lopatkiewicz, an NTSB spokesman, cautioned that the
board has not analyzed the data or detected trends in the acci
dent rate. Board Chairman Jim Burnett long has argued that
aircraft accidents do not necessarily provide a good means for
measuring aviation safety because accidents, compared with the
number of flights, occur infrequently,

On Sept. 4, 1983, four days after 269 people were killed when
the KAL flight strayed into Soviet airspace, the president told
congressional leaders that the United States had "definite proof
that they intentionally shot down that unarmed civilian
airplane."
"There is no way a pilot could mistake this for anything other
than acivilain airliner," Reagan declared a day later, referring to
what he described as "incontrovertible evidence."
These statements appear to be contradicted by recently declas
sified intelligence estimates released by Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-
Ind., which indicate that U.S. officials had concluded as early as
Sept. 2 that the Soviets were unaware that it was a civilian air
liner. The estimates were contained in two letters written about a
year ago to Hamilton by J. Edward Fox, assistant secretary of
state for legislative affairs.
"We had concluded by the second day that the Soviets thought
they were pursuing a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft throughout
most, if not all, of the overflight," Fox wrote. He later added that
"the bottom line is that the Soviets, through their own ineptitude,
probably were not certain what type of aircraft they were shoot
ing down."
Shultz receives Japanese proposals
WASHINGTON — Japanese Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno,
preparing for the first meeting between new Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita and President Reagan, yesterday presented
Secretary of State George Shultz with a package of proposals to
improve U.S.-Japanese relations, including one that could open
the door to American participation in large-scale public works
projects in Japan.
Uno also pledged that Japan would bear the cost of all fringe
benefits paid to some 22,000 Japanese workers at U.S. bases in
Japan by fiscal 1990, paying an extra $200 million. And he in
directly signaled Japan's willingness to lift import quotas on at
least 10 farm products, an issue on which the Reagan administra
tion has placed a high priority.
The initiative drew a favorable reaction from U.S. officials. A
senior administration official, who asked to remain anonymous,
said the improved access to public works projects "will meet
what we want perhaps in the opening of the Japanese market to
American bids and American firms," but added, "That's what we
have to clarify."
With Japan's likely concession on the agricultural import
quotas, "We feel that that matter is pretty well taken care of," he
said.
Reagan team downbeat after trip
WASHINGTON — A top-level Reagan administration group
that visited Central America last week returned less than opti
mistic that the leaders of Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica and
El Salvador would call for renewed aid to the Nicaraguan contras
even if there is little progress on the Central American peace
plan, a senior official said yesterday.
The presidential mission to Central America, led by Lt. Gen.
Colin Powell, Reagan's assistant for national security affairs, was
intended to ensure that the leaders of the four Central American
democracies, who will meet late this week in Costa Rica,
"understand the seriousness of the situation we have in Washing
ton and the difficulty in getting additional funding" from
Congress for the contras, the senior official said.
The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
Powell emphasized to the four that their cooperation was needed
to make U.S. aid for the contras politically feasible, and that the
Sandinista government was unlikely to enact peaceful reforms if
the Contra opposition is allowed to dissipate.
Summarizing Powell's report to President Reagan after the
trip, the official said: "All four of these countries are disturbed
over Sandinista intransigence, but for political reasons," none
can "jump up and say, 'We love the (contra) freedom fighters
and keep the aid coming.' "
Meese calls for more prison funds
WASHINGTON — An additional several billion dollars will
be needed to build and operate new federal prisons over the next
five years, even though the government already has been putting
up penitentiaries at a record pace since 1982, Attorney General
Edwin Meese 111 said yeterday.
In a speech that an administration source said was aimed partly
at reducing resistance from the Office of Management and
Budget to more prison money, Meese attributed the inmate pop
ulation boom to tough crime and anti-drug laws enacted in recent
years.
The attorney general, speaking in Phoenix to a meeting of the
American Correctional Association, also called for more private
employment of prisoners, which he said would benefit compan
ies, the public, correctional institutions and the inmates.
Meese, who in the past has been a staunch advocate of the ad
ministration's emphasis on budgetary restraint, said: "The issue
here is public safety. And the only real option is to build more
prisons."
Airlines had 31 crashes last year
WASHINGTON — U.S. airlines, flying scheduled flights in
large aircraft, had 31 accidents last year — the most in 13 years
— including four crashes that killed 231 people, the government
reported yesterday.
Aviation accident statistics released by the National Transpor
tation Safety Board (NTSB) show that the accident rate for
major airlines and commuter carriers rose slightly last year over
1986, while the rate for air taxis and general aviation declined.
Airlines experienced the most accidents since 1974 when there
were 42, the NTSB said. The board noted that the number of
departures, used to measure the growth in flights, has increased
by almost 50 percent since then.
Among commuter carriers, 35 accidents last year claimed 58
lives. It was the commuters' most accidents since 1980.
Meanwhile, accidents involving small private aircraft dropped
for the fifth consecutive year, from 2581 in 1986 to 2420 last
year, the NTSB said. The number of fatalities also declined, from
955 deaths in 1986 to 788 in 1987.
Ted Lopatkiewicz, an NTSB spokesman, cautioned that the
board has not analyzed the data or detected trends in the acci
dent rate. Board Chairman Jim Burnett long has argued that
aircraft accidents do not necessarily provide a good means for
measuring aviation safety because accidents, compared with the
number of flights, occur infrequently,

U.S. knew of Soviet KAL mistake
WASHINGTON — Contrary to President Reagan's public
statements at the time, U.S. intelligence officials quickly deter
