JERUSALEM — Israeli troops barred a
United Nations official from two Gaza Strip
refugee camps yesterday, and the official left a
third camp voluntarily to avoid provoking a
demonstration as Israeli gunfire claimed its
33rd Palestinian victim in the continuing vio
lence in the occupied territories.
An army tally of casualties in the occupied
territories since Dec. 9, when the wave of vio
lence began, also listed 257 Palestinians
wounded by gunshot — 184 in the Gaza Strip
and 73 in the West Bank.
According to the army count, 61 soldiers
and 40 Israeli civilians have been injured in
the unrest. The great majority of the injuries
are believed to have been connected with
stoning incidents, and the only Israeli
seriously injured so far has been a soldier
stabbed in the back.
The most serious of yesterday's clashes
again took place in the Gaza Strip, and they
coincided with separate visits to the area by
Marrack Goulding, the U.N. undersecretary
general, and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
The army said that Palestinians armed with
knives attacked an army patrol in Rafah, at
the southern end of the Gaza Strip near the
Egyptian border. The troops tried to fend off
the attackers with smoke bombs, according to
the army radio, but failed and opened fire
when their lives were considered to be in dan
ger.
An army spokesman said three Palestinians
and a soldier were wounded in the incident

and one Palestinian killed. He identified the
dead man as Muhammad Yusef Yazouri, and
said he was believed to be related to Basel el
Yazouri, who died Monday from wounds
received in a clash with Israeli soldiers last
weekend. The nature of the relationship was
not determined.
The army imposed a curfew throughout the
Gaza Strip, sealing seven of eight refugee
camps in the area. That made it difficult for
the United Nations and Palestinian organiza
tions to maintain contact with sources of in
formation in the area. As a result, it has
become more difficult in the last few days to
check reports of clashes and to confirm
fatalities.
That situation was reflected in a report by
the army radio yesterday that a second Pales
tinian had been shot to death by soldiers in the
Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza City. Later, an
army spokesman said that the report had been
erroneous and that two camp residents had
been slightly wounded when a patrol opened
fire against attackers armed with stones and
nail-studded clubs.
The Palestine Press Service, which supports
the Palestine Liberation Organization, also
reported a fatality in Jabaliya, but said it could
provide no details. U.N. officials said that
they, too, had heard reports of a fatality, but
were unable to confirm it.
Goulding, the U.N. undersecretary general,
tried to visit Jabaliya yesterday morning but
was turned away by soldiers who informed
him that it was a closed military area. Later he

was denied access to the neighboring Beach
refugee camp.
Goulding arrived here late last week after
the U.N Security Council unanimously
criticized the way Israel is dealing with the un
rest. The council called on Israel to rescind ex
pulsion orders issued last week against nine
West Bank and Gaza Strip Palestinians
accused of inciting disorder.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has refused
to meet with Goulding, and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres told Goulding on Monday that
Israel regards any intervention by the United
Nations as "damaging to our goal of bringing
calm to the territories."
Later yesterday, Goulding stopped at the
Mughazi refugee camp, midway down the
Gaza Strip, the only camp in the area not un
der army curfew. Goulding said later that he
decided against entering the camp.
"There was a row of burning barrels," he
said. "Beyond that there was quite a large
crowd, I'd say several hundred people. We
sent one car forward, and they said we were
welcome to go in. But he reported back that
they were in a very excited state . . . and we
took the decision that if we went on there was
a risk of a confrontation developing."
The incident was the subject of a tense ex
change between Goulding and Rabin in front
of reporters at the Defense Ministry in Tel

been slightly wounded when a patrol opened
fire against attackers armed with stones and
nail-studded clubs.
The Palestine Press Service, which supports
the Palestine Liberation Organization, also
reported a fatality in Jabaliya, but said it could
provide no details. U.N. officials said that
they, too, had heard reports of a fatality, but
were unable to confirm it.
Goulding, the U.N. undersecretary general,
tried to visit Jabaliya yesterday morning but
was turned away by soldiers who informed
him that it was a closed military area. Later he

was denied access to the neighboring Beach
refugee camp.
Goulding arrived here late last week after
the U.N Security Council unanimously
criticized the way Israel is dealing with the un
rest. The council called on Israel to rescind ex
pulsion orders issued last week against nine
West Bank and Gaza Strip Palestinians
accused of inciting disorder.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has refused
to meet with Goulding, and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres told Goulding on Monday that
Israel regards any intervention by the United
Nations as "damaging to our goal of bringing
calm to the territories."
Later yesterday, Goulding stopped at the
Mughazi refugee camp, midway down the
Gaza Strip, the only camp in the area not un
der army curfew. Goulding said later that he
decided against entering the camp.
"There was a row of burning barrels," he
said. "Beyond that there was quite a large
crowd, I'd say several hundred people. We
sent one car forward, and they said we were
welcome to go in. But he reported back that
they were in a very excited state . . . and we
took the decision that if we went on there was
a risk of a confrontation developing."
The incident was the subject of a tense ex
change between Goulding and Rabin in front
of reporters at the Defense Ministry in Tel
Aviv.
"I have made clear throughout that the last
thing we want to do is to provoke any con
frontations," Goulding said.
