# University launches safety investigation
## Letter alleges waste, mismanagement, cover-up 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
Responding to charges of waste,
mismanagement, unethical behav
ior and cover-up, Stanford has
begun an extensive investigation of
its health and safety policies, Uni
versity officials announced at a
press conference yesterday.
The health and safety review has
been discreetly underway since
Dec. 10, when University President
Donald Kennedy received a letter
from a University employee alleging
numerous instances of University
misconduct, including general
safety management problems and
specific instances of employee in
timidation, Director of Internal
Audit Peter Millington told
reporters.
The University is respecting the
employee's request for anonymity,
said Millington, who, along with
Vice President of Business and
Finance William Massy, inter
viewed the employee shortly after
Kennedy received the letter.
The specific contents of the letter

remained unclear after the hastily
convened press conference because
Millington refused to divulge the
employee's complete allegations to
reporters "until all information is
gathered."
Millington defended the Univer
sity's decision to conduct a full-scale
investigation, however, saying the
employee was of "sufficient stature"
to warrant immediate and extensive
action.
In a Dec. 15 letter to the em
ployee, Kennedy wrote, "I am per
sonally very disturbed by the serious
charges you raise. ... I have in
structed that Peter (Millington)
conduct the investigation with full
independence, using resources out
side the University as appropriate."
Millington issued an outline of
the special review yesterday that
named 10 buildings to be further
investigated. The review will be
conducted by the consulting firm
SRI International, which this week
accepted a contract from the Uni
versity to investigate the charges
and develop recommendations for
corrective action.

A team of six experts from SRl's
Environmental Health Program set
up a special office on campus this
week, said Robert Shelton, a prin
cipal management consultant from
SRI who will head the group.
The buildings to be investigated
are the Environmental Safety Fa
cility, the Center for Integrated Sys
tems, Keck, the Center for
Molecular and Genetic Medicine,
the Stone Building, deGuerre Pool
Stadium, McCullough, Stauffer,
Herrin and Mitchell. Except for
deGuerre, the facilities are used for
chemical, engineering and medical
research.
The pool stadium will be inves
tigated because of the chlorine gas
stored there. Chlorine is used to
disinfect the swimming pool.
Aspects of the buildings to be
considered in the first report —
due by mid-February — include the
handling of toxic gases, chemical
storage, ventilation and incinerator
operations. Several reports on long
range questions of "management,
process and personnel" will follow,
Millington said.

Kennedy said the University is
"not aware of any conditions that
would preclude the current use of
a facility," but that "appropriate ac
tion" will be taken if new informa
tion emerges from the investigation.
Kennedy yesterday named a spe
cial panel to advise him after the
reports are completed. The mem
bers are:
• Shirley Hufstcdler, former U.S.
secretary of education;
• Jere Goyan, former commissioner
of the Food and Drug Administra
tion;
• Victor Calvo, former state as
semblyman for the district including
Stanford;
• Physics Prof. Wolfgang Panofsky,
emeritus director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center; and
• Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow,
chair of the Faculty Senate.
Millington said he has met with
"all University departments con
cerned with health and safety" and
will interview, together with SRI,
"upwards of 40 individuals."
Nobody has declined to be inter
viewed so far, he said.

SRI was chosen as the indepen
dent consultant during winter
break, according to Millington.
"They were always high on the list
for risk management and technical
expertise," he said.
Formerly the Stanford Research
Institute and now a nonprofit re
search firm, SRI broke with the
University in 1970 and remains in

dependent, except for a small
amount of money paid to Stanford
perpetually as a separation agree
ment. Dennis Maxwell, SRI vice
president for corporate marketing,
said the yearly payment is "less than
one half of one percent of annual
gross revenue."

Maxwell said SRI has done no
large projects recently for Stanford
and now maintains "a simple client
relationship."
University officials were reluctant
to comment on the state of Uni
versity safety policy yesterday in the
absence of any hard data. Ralph
Buchanan, acting deputy associate
vice president for administrative
services and facilities and the per
son ultimately responsible for the
Department of Health and Safety,

said he was "surprised" at the al
legations, but noted that as a matter
of policy, "every complaint is inves
tigated."
One University expert in matters
of health and safety currently at
Stanford who wished to remain
anonymous said yesterday, "there
is a problem of safety inherent in
a university environment."
According to the source, "profes
sors, in the pressure of research,
grant writing, paper writing and
teaching, don't want some safety
person looking over their shoulder
in their labs who has the potential
to shut them down."
Buchanan denied that a conflict

of interest exists, but admitted, "In
part, safety is a sales job. It's up
to us to get them (researchers) to
operate within constraints." He
added that, to his knowledge, pro
fessors here operate within the reg
ulations.
Ken Williams, a research en
gineer and chair of the Compliance
Subcommittee of the Safety Com
mittee at the targeted McCullough
Building, said the safety record
there is "very good."
"The response to these cases
tends to be overkill," said Williams,
who added that the anonymous
employee's allegations "are not
nearly as severe as has been stated."

considered in the first report —
due by mid-February — include the
handling of toxic gases, chemical
storage, ventilation and incinerator
operations. Several reports on long
range questions of "management,
process and personnel" will follow,
Millington said.

Kennedy said the University is
"not aware of any conditions that
would preclude the current use of
a facility," but that "appropriate ac
tion" will be taken if new informa
tion emerges from the investigation.
Kennedy yesterday named a spe
cial panel to advise him after the
reports are completed. The mem
bers are:
• Shirley Hufstcdler, former U.S.
secretary of education;
• Jere Goyan, former commissioner
of the Food and Drug Administra
tion;
• Victor Calvo, former state as
semblyman for the district including
Stanford;
• Physics Prof. Wolfgang Panofsky,
emeritus director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center; and
• Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow,
chair of the Faculty Senate.
Millington said he has met with
"all University departments con
cerned with health and safety" and
will interview, together with SRI,
"upwards of 40 individuals."
Nobody has declined to be inter
viewed so far, he said.

SRI was chosen as the indepen
dent consultant during winter
break, according to Millington.
"They were always high on the list
for risk management and technical
expertise," he said.
Formerly the Stanford Research
Institute and now a nonprofit re
search firm, SRI broke with the
University in 1970 and remains in

dependent, except for a small
amount of money paid to Stanford
perpetually as a separation agree
ment. Dennis Maxwell, SRI vice
president for corporate marketing,
said the yearly payment is "less than
one half of one percent of annual
gross revenue."

Maxwell said SRI has done no
large projects recently for Stanford
and now maintains "a simple client
relationship."
University officials were reluctant
to comment on the state of Uni
versity safety policy yesterday in the
absence of any hard data. Ralph
Buchanan, acting deputy associate
vice president for administrative
services and facilities and the per
son ultimately responsible for the
Department of Health and Safety,

said he was "surprised" at the al
legations, but noted that as a matter
of policy, "every complaint is inves
tigated."
One University expert in matters
of health and safety currently at
Stanford who wished to remain
anonymous said yesterday, "there
is a problem of safety inherent in
a university environment."
According to the source, "profes
sors, in the pressure of research,
grant writing, paper writing and
teaching, don't want some safety
person looking over their shoulder
in their labs who has the potential
to shut them down."
Buchanan denied that a conflict

of interest exists, but admitted, "In
part, safety is a sales job. It's up
to us to get them (researchers) to
operate within constraints." He
added that, to his knowledge, pro
fessors here operate within the reg
ulations.
Ken Williams, a research en
gineer and chair of the Compliance
Subcommittee of the Safety Com
mittee at the targeted McCullough
Building, said the safety record
there is "very good."
"The response to these cases
tends to be overkill," said Williams,
who added that the anonymous
employee's allegations "are not
nearly as severe as has been stated."
Responding to charges of waste,
mismanagement, unethical behav
ior and cover-up, Stanford has
begun an extensive investigation of
its health and safety policies, Uni
versity officials announced at a
press conference yesterday.
The health and safety review has
been discreetly underway since
Dec. 10, when University President
Donald Kennedy received a letter
from a University employee alleging
numerous instances of University
misconduct, including general
safety management problems and
specific instances of employee in
timidation, Director of Internal
Audit Peter Millington told
reporters.
The University is respecting the
employee's request for anonymity,
said Millington, who, along with
Vice President of Business and
Finance William Massy, inter
viewed the employee shortly after
Kennedy received the letter.
The specific contents of the letter

remained unclear after the hastily
convened press conference because
Millington refused to divulge the
employee's complete allegations to
reporters "until all information is
gathered."
Millington defended the Univer
sity's decision to conduct a full-scale
investigation, however, saying the
employee was of "sufficient stature"
to warrant immediate and extensive
action.
In a Dec. 15 letter to the em
ployee, Kennedy wrote, "I am per
sonally very disturbed by the serious
charges you raise. ... I have in
structed that Peter (Millington)
conduct the investigation with full
independence, using resources out
side the University as appropriate."
Millington issued an outline of
the special review yesterday that
named 10 buildings to be further
investigated. The review will be
conducted by the consulting firm
SRI International, which this week
accepted a contract from the Uni
versity to investigate the charges
and develop recommendations for
corrective action.

A team of six experts from SRl's
Environmental Health Program set
up a special office on campus this
week, said Robert Shelton, a prin
cipal management consultant from
SRI who will head the group.
The buildings to be investigated
are the Environmental Safety Fa
cility, the Center for Integrated Sys
tems, Keck, the Center for
Molecular and Genetic Medicine,
the Stone Building, deGuerre Pool
Stadium, McCullough, Stauffer,
Herrin and Mitchell. Except for
deGuerre, the facilities are used for
chemical, engineering and medical
research.
The pool stadium will be inves
tigated because of the chlorine gas
stored there. Chlorine is used to
disinfect the swimming pool.
Aspects of the buildings to be
considered in the first report —
due by mid-February — include the
handling of toxic gases, chemical
storage, ventilation and incinerator
operations. Several reports on long
range questions of "management,
