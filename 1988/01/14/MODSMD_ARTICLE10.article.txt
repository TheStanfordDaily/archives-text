The Black Student Union will
seek passage of the controversial
Western Culture Task Force pro
posal ihat will come before the Fac
ulty Senate Wednesday and will
seek to increase the number of eth
nic studies courses at Stanford,
BSU Chair Bill King said yesterday.
"Inspired" by their experiences
on a trip to the South to register
potential voters last week, a group
of 16 Stanford students are now
"more committed" than ever to end
racial discrimination at Stanford,
King said.
At a BSU press conference yes
terday intended to detail Project
Democracy, a BSU-sponsored trip
to Alabama and Georgia designed
to increase voter registration of
poor black farmers, King said a high
priority for the BSU is to push for
change the University's Western
Culture requirement.
"We feel that it is really the first
time that the University will give
the most broad insight (to ethnic
issues)," King said about the up
coming faculty debate, which will

finally reach the senate floor after
a year of heated, University-wide
dialogue.
Although the University needs to
broaden students' ethnic awareness,
King said students here neverthe
less want to fight for civil rights.
King said he would like to see
students recognize the problems

confronting minorities in nearby
East Palo Alto and participate in
outreach programs to aid the poor
and hungry of the community.
Licia Dorosin, one trip member,
pointed out that the poor living
conditions of East Palo Alto resi
dents is similar to the impoverish
ment of the southern blacks the
group met on the trip.
