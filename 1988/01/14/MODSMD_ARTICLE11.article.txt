While most Stanford students generally appreci
ate the sunshine and beauty of our campus, many
are disturbingly insensitive to the people who main
tain it — the groundskeepers, the custodians and
the other service workers.
Try to remember the last time you had a sub
stantive conversation with the people whose daily
work frees up your time and energy to study and
learn.
Then try to remember the last time you or a
friend trashed the hall or lounge of your residence
or threw up in the bathroom — only to leave the
mess for a custodian to clean up later.
Unfortunately, few Stanford students treat
campus service workers with respect. Occasionally,
friendly and relaxed relationships develop between
students and workers. Sadly, this is the exception
and not the rule.
More often than not, students ignore the nearby
worker who cleans their lounge, mops their bath
room or rakes the leaves from around their bikes.
This uncomfortable silence reflects a gulf that
exists between Stanford students and Stanford
workers. For a University that supposedly prepares
its students for the real world, this uneasy rela

tionship is alarming. The real world is filled with
people who do a hard day's work in largely thankless
jobs every day. If friendly and gregarious and, we
should add, relatively privileged young people —
as most Stanford students are — cannot relate
comfortably with them now, they probably won't
after graduation either.
We often hear references to the "Stanford com
munity." Stanford is indeed more than just a school,
yet how often do we reflect on all the diverse
contributions that are required to keep the Uni
versity operating successfully? There are over 500
service workers at Stanford. Without them, the
University would cease to function. Students should
pause in their harried academic and personal lives
to appreciate all that these people do.
More than that, however, they should treat ser
vice workers with respect. This means students
cleaning up their own messes rather than thinking
it their God-given right to have somone clean up
after them; it means initiating contact beyond the
cursory "hello" or nod of the head. In short, it
means acting responsibly and considerately.
The real world is right. It's time we woke up
and recognized it.
