# College softens sting of high school caste system
## 
### 
It was a hot, stuffy night in the dirty
basement of a ratty old beach house. My
senior high school class had gathered to
do some drinking, to start off our spring
break in good style. Everyone was there
— the popular, shy, athletic, nerd-like —
all the stereotypes you could name. I stood
uncomfortably alongside a wall I tried not
to touch, while I tried to talk with some
of my friends.

pressed up against the wall, smiling wanly,
staring blurrily at the mob. I closed my
eyes for a second, thinking, "This has to
be a dream. This is movie material, not
the life of Lyn Fairchild." You must un
derstand at this point that my alcohol ex
perience had never exceeded a wine cooler.
I opened my eyes and David was putting
the plastic tubing in my hand, and Erik
was filling the funnel, reassuring me, "Just
half a beer, just half a beer." And from
the depths of my soul, the pit of my
stomach, the inner recesses of my brain —
wherever wimpiness resides — flowed ac
quiescence. "Oh, okay," I said.
So I did it. I didn't waver, spit it out or
puke, and the beer slipped down my throat
with incredible ease. I succumbed, and I
succumbed well. I like the irony of the
epilogue perhaps the best: Wes, a boy who
in his lifetime had consumed more than
my weight in alcohol, approached me af
terwards and shook my hand.
"Lyn, I no longer respect you," he said,
as I tried to figure out whether or not he
was serious, "because you gave in to peer
pressure." If time could warp I'd transport
myself back and laugh in his face about
the pot calling the kettle black and all that
stuff; but still, I have to admit he had a
point.
People were intimidating back in high
school. We let others' opinions mold us
and worried the rest of the time just what
those opinions were. Because I was a
teetotaler until my senior year, the people
who drank assumed I was passing judgment
on them, and I assumed that whenever I
didn't drink they were passing judgment

I don't know how it happened, but sud
denly I found myself descended upon by
Erik and David, two nice, partying guys,
grown increasingly bolder with a little al
cohol in their systems. Erik bounced up
and down, cradling a prodigious beer bong
in his arms, and David was breathing Mich
elob fumes in my face. "Lyn," they said,
"you gotta do one."
I laughed with them merrily, uncomfor
tably. "Ha, ha, ha — no, Erik and David,
that's not up my alley; I'll probably puke,"
I said. Undaunted, they put their arms
around me and urged the idea. Somehow
the mass of 80-plus people in the room
caught what was going on and moved in,
Colosseum-like, to egg me on.
All of a sudden the room was thundering
with shouts of "Lyn, Lyn, Lyn." I was

on me.
A friend shoved a six-pack into my hands
at one party. I held the beer unobtrusively,
I thought, until someone noticed and
shouted, "Look at Lyn!" Cheers rose up
as if I had suddenly rung the Drinking Bell
and given the go-ahead to all — "Let the
imbibing commence!" And when I downed
my first cooler and leaned, giggling, against
some of my friends who were also ex
perimenting, I felt incredibly "in"and "with
it."

People were intimidating back in high school. We let

just what those opinions were. Because I was a teetotaler
until my senior year, the people who drank assumed I
was passing judgment on them, and I assumed that
whenever I didn't drink they were passing judgment on
me.

We all cared so much about what other
people thought, and we altered our words
and actions on occasion to prevent any
offense to those we "respected." In ninth
grade a lot of us were offered stereotypical
straitjackets that seemed to fit so well we
started believing they were our size.
How many of us were "brains" in high
school? "Nice," but we worked too much?
"Oh God," came the refrain, "your grades
make me sick." In turn we pointed out the
sluts, the geeks, the jocks and the nobodies
to ourselves and created a little world of

labels around us. "The Breakfast Club"
was right on target. Its obvious point about
stereotypes is the universal truth of high
school.
High school is the sort of memory I
should simply let pass if it contains some
embarrassing and undesirable experiences,
right? I figure I shouldn't dwell on it and
wax nostalgic or anti-nostalgic. But I often
recall some of my high school mistakes and
compare them with how I act at Stanford.
Between the benefits of college life and a

few years of growth, my real self musters
a little more bravery around here and tries
to exert itself.
I realize, intellectually, that I can't let
people intimidate me, but that doesn't
mean I've overcome that fear. Days go by
where I writhe for uttering a single inane
sentence or attempting an unsuccessful con
versation with someone. Then thankfully
come the other days when I couldn't care
less what so-and-so thought. I have a life
to live!
I'll explain how I came to ruminate on

all of this. This past vacation I saw a guy
who used to intimidate the hell out of me
in high school. He was popular, funny,
intelligent, musical, theatrical — but no
more so than a lot of people. Someone
somewhere decided he was cool, and
gradually most people came to think so.
We had maybe 10 words to say to each
other our entire high school career — and
this even when we acted alongside one
another in a play.
But with two years to soften the sting
of the caste system, I found myself con
versing with him at this party, and it was
a decent, sustained exchange of words.
Whatever roles we'd played back then no
longer mattered, and I felt good. I think
a friend of mine phrased it well when she
chose her senior quotation for the yearbook
from a Phil Collins song, "I don't care
anymore," goes the song, "I don't care no
more, no more ..
She only got to that quotation, however,
after a series of high school experiences in
which she cared a lot and encountered a
lot of stress and heartache. As detached
as that quotation seems, I still don't think
you can ever quite wipe away the hurt of
other people's judgments.
I like another quotation even better, 1
guess because it lends us a little power
when we deal with others who might be
in the mood for stereotyping. It's courtesy
of Eleanor Roosevelt: "No one," she
asserts, "can make you feel inferior without
your consent." It ought to be a motto for
the rest of my life.

People were intimidating back in high school. We let
others' opinions mold us and worried the rest of the time
just what those opinions were. Because I was a teetotaler
until my senior year, the people who drank assumed I
was passing judgment on them, and I assumed that
whenever I didn't drink they were passing judgment on
me.

We all cared so much about what other
people thought, and we altered our words
and actions on occasion to prevent any
offense to those we "respected." In ninth
grade a lot of us were offered stereotypical
straitjackets that seemed to fit so well we
started believing they were our size.
How many of us were "brains" in high
school? "Nice," but we worked too much?
"Oh God," came the refrain, "your grades
make me sick." In turn we pointed out the
sluts, the geeks, the jocks and the nobodies
to ourselves and created a little world of

labels around us. "The Breakfast Club"
was right on target. Its obvious point about
stereotypes is the universal truth of high
school.
High school is the sort of memory I
should simply let pass if it contains some
embarrassing and undesirable experiences,
right? I figure I shouldn't dwell on it and
wax nostalgic or anti-nostalgic. But I often
recall some of my high school mistakes and
compare them with how I act at Stanford.
Between the benefits of college life and a

few years of growth, my real self musters
a little more bravery around here and tries
to exert itself.
I realize, intellectually, that I can't let
people intimidate me, but that doesn't
mean I've overcome that fear. Days go by
where I writhe for uttering a single inane
sentence or attempting an unsuccessful con
versation with someone. Then thankfully
come the other days when I couldn't care
less what so-and-so thought. I have a life
to live!
I'll explain how I came to ruminate on

all of this. This past vacation I saw a guy
who used to intimidate the hell out of me
in high school. He was popular, funny,
intelligent, musical, theatrical — but no
more so than a lot of people. Someone
somewhere decided he was cool, and
gradually most people came to think so.
We had maybe 10 words to say to each
other our entire high school career — and
this even when we acted alongside one
another in a play.
But with two years to soften the sting
of the caste system, I found myself con
versing with him at this party, and it was
a decent, sustained exchange of words.
Whatever roles we'd played back then no
longer mattered, and I felt good. I think
a friend of mine phrased it well when she
chose her senior quotation for the yearbook
from a Phil Collins song, "I don't care
anymore," goes the song, "I don't care no
more, no more ..
She only got to that quotation, however,
after a series of high school experiences in
which she cared a lot and encountered a
lot of stress and heartache. As detached
as that quotation seems, I still don't think
you can ever quite wipe away the hurt of
other people's judgments.
I like another quotation even better, 1
guess because it lends us a little power
when we deal with others who might be
in the mood for stereotyping. It's courtesy
of Eleanor Roosevelt: "No one," she
asserts, "can make you feel inferior without
your consent." It ought to be a motto for
the rest of my life.

It was a hot, stuffy night in the dirty
basement of a ratty old beach house. My
senior high school class had gathered to
do some drinking, to start off our spring
break in good style. Everyone was there
— the popular, shy, athletic, nerd-like —
all the stereotypes you could name. I stood
uncomfortably alongside a wall I tried not
to touch, while I tried to talk with some
of my friends.

pressed up against the wall, smiling wanly,
staring blurrily at the mob. I closed my
eyes for a second, thinking, "This has to
be a dream. This is movie material, not
the life of Lyn Fairchild." You must un
derstand at this point that my alcohol ex
perience had never exceeded a wine cooler.
I opened my eyes and David was putting
the plastic tubing in my hand, and Erik
was filling the funnel, reassuring me, "Just
half a beer, just half a beer." And from
the depths of my soul, the pit of my
stomach, the inner recesses of my brain —
wherever wimpiness resides — flowed ac
quiescence. "Oh, okay," I said.
So I did it. I didn't waver, spit it out or
puke, and the beer slipped down my throat
with incredible ease. I succumbed, and I
succumbed well. I like the irony of the
epilogue perhaps the best: Wes, a boy who
in his lifetime had consumed more than
my weight in alcohol, approached me af
terwards and shook my hand.
"Lyn, I no longer respect you," he said,
as I tried to figure out whether or not he
was serious, "because you gave in to peer
pressure." If time could warp I'd transport
myself back and laugh in his face about
the pot calling the kettle black and all that
stuff; but still, I have to admit he had a
point.

I don't know how it happened, but sud
denly I found myself descended upon by
Erik and David, two nice, partying guys,
grown increasingly bolder with a little al
cohol in their systems. Erik bounced up
and down, cradling a prodigious beer bong
in his arms, and David was breathing Mich
elob fumes in my face. "Lyn," they said,
"you gotta do one."
I laughed with them merrily, uncomfor
tably. "Ha, ha, ha — no, Erik and David,
that's not up my alley; I'll probably puke,"
I said. Undaunted, they put their arms
around me and urged the idea. Somehow
the mass of 80-plus people in the room
caught what was going on and moved in,
Colosseum-like, to egg me on.
All of a sudden the room was thundering
with shouts of "Lyn, Lyn, Lyn." I was

on me.
A friend shoved a six-pack into my hands
at one party. I held the beer unobtrusively,
I thought, until someone noticed and
shouted, "Look at Lyn!" Cheers rose up
as if I had suddenly rung the Drinking Bell
and given the go-ahead to all — "Let the
imbibing commence!" And when I downed
my first cooler and leaned, giggling, against
some of my friends who were also ex
perimenting, I felt incredibly "in"and "with
it."
