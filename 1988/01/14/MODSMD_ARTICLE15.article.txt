## Israel shuns peace opportunities 
### 
The violent protests in Israeli-occupied ter
ritories show what can happen when frustration
reaches the point of utter hopelessness. The
Palestinians who are defying the Israeli army
with stones and burning tires are clearly willing
to risk death rather than continue life under
present conditions. More than 32 have been
killed in the past month.

The demonstrations should have surprised no
one, least of all the Israeli government. Last
July, a report prepared by a Harvard researcher
referred to Gaza as the "Soweto of the Middle
East," where 650,000 Palestinians are crammed
into some of the world's most congested slums,
while a third of the 28-mile long strip is reserved
for 2500 Jewish settlers.
The report described conditions at Gaza's
main hospital as "at best abhorrent," with
patients lying two to a bed on torn, blood-stained
sheets. The hospital lacks even an X-ray ma
chine. Early this month a British minister of
state, David Mellor, called the Arab sector of
Gaza "an affront to civilized values."
There is a reason for Gaza's extreme poverty.
According to a 1985 survey by the Economist
of London, Israeli restrictions have crippled
Gaza's main sources of income — its citrus
market and fishing industry. Consequently,
thousands of Gazans must leave home at dawn
every day to work as casual laborers in Israel,
where they are not allowed to spend the night.
Their average annual wage is $1000, compared
to $6000 for Israelis. Like Palestinians on the
West Bank, they pay more in taxes than Israel
spends on services to the occupied territories,
so the occupation not only provides Israel with
cheap labor but yields a net profit as well.
Even the U.S. government quietly has warned
Israel to change its policies. On Dec. 21, Asst.
Secretary of State Richard Murphy told a House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee that the State De
partment had expressed concern over Israel's

punitive demolition of 70 Palestinian homes, the
killing of nine unarmed Palestinians earlier in
the year, the detention of 120 Palestinians with
out trial and the physical and psychological abuse
of Palestinian prisoners. Murphy said the
economies of the occupied territories were "st
agnant," with virtually no job opportunities for
Palestinian college graduates.
The situation was bound to explode. The
tragedy is that it could have been avoided. While
Israel's ruling Likud Party has continued to
insist that the occupied territories with their
one-and-a-half million Palestinian inhabitants
must forever belong to Israel, chances to end
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have repeatedly
slipped away. For at least 10 years Yasser Arafat
has signaled the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization's willingness to make peace with Is
rael in return for an independent Palestinian
state in the territory Israel captured in 1967.
In 1977 Arafat endorsed a U.S.-Soviet call
for a Middle East peace conference, which Israel
rejected. He has even suggested that a U.N.
force be stationed inside the borders of a Pal
estinian state in order to ease Israel's fears, yet
every overture has been rejected or ignored.
In June 1982, after the PLO had scrupulously
observed an 11-month cease-fire along the
Lebanese border and at a time when Arafat
was seeking international support for a peace
conference, Israeli troops marched into Lebanon
to smash the PLO. Israel's invasion resulted in
30,000 civilian deaths, created a new set of
enemies for Israel among Lebanese Moslems
and further inflamed the resentment of Pales
tinians.
Nevertheless, last April at a meeting of the
Palestine National Council, Arafat succeeded in
uniting even radical PLO factions behind a call
for a U.N.-sponsored peace conference. Israel
again rejected the idea, and the U.S. response
was to close the PLO information office in Wash
ington, D.C. On Sept. 7, at a U.N. meeting in
Geneva, Arafat said he accepted all U.N. resolu
tions pertaining to the Palestinians, including
resolutions 242 and 338 — which call for the
guarantee of secure borders for Israel.

Arafat said, "We cannot be out of touch with
reality. I want to negotiate with my enemies in
order to reach a just and comprehensive peace.
The idea of peace negotiations, in the framework
of an international conference, now enjoys
worldwide support. Such an opportunity may
not come again."

While Israel's ruling Likud
Party has continued to in
sist that the occupied ter
ritories must forever belong
to Israel, chances to end
the Israeli-Palestinian con
flict have repeatedly
slipped away.

Once again Arafat's overture was ignored,
and the mythical claim that "the Arabs refuse
to negotiate" continues to circulate. But Arafat's
warning was a serious one. If his efforts at
conciliation continue to be rebuffed, more
militant leaders are certain to take his place.
There is already evidence that young Palestinians
are turning to leaders who reject all thought of
compromise with Israel.
Israel's insistence on keeping all of the land
that both peoples claim has been a chicf obstacle
to peace. It will be a further tragedy if the day
comcs when the negotiations Israel has rejected
for so long are no longer an option. For, as
Flora Lewis said recently in the New York
Times, "When history denies hope, it begets
monstrosity."
