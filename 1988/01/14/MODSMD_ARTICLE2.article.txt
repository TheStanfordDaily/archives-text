# IFC resists dry rush

### Sean Kinch Staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council last night received fur
ther encouragement to institute a dry Rush, but IFC
officials and fraternity officials again discounted the
possibility that the three-week event would be made
completely dry.
At a regularly scheduled Interfraternity Council
meeting last night, Alumni IFC Secretary George
Reppas urged the IFC to adopt a completely dry
Rush policy.
Reppas said a dry Rush would remove a "dangerous"
legal liability from rush parties. He argued that fra
ternities are effectively "attracting minors by illegal
inducements" by having wet Rush parties.
Fraternities are especially vulnerable to legal
hazards during Rush, Reppas said, because the parties
are designed specifically for freshmen and sophomores,
who are mostly minors.
Several IFC members commented that a dry Rush
would be hypocritical since fraternities serve alcohol
at their parties during the rest of the year.
The majority sentiment at the meeting appeared to
be to keep the Rush policy that was implemented
last year, which allowed alcohol in the first and third
weeks of Rush, but kept the second week dry.
After the meeting, IFC President Vinny Frost said
the IFC is "closer to adopting a dry Rush policy than
ever before," but "a three-week dry period isn't in
the cards."
Frost added that the IFC would "most likely" agree
to a policy forbidding alcohol from being served at
open parties and allowing it at invitation-only parties.
Kappa Alpha President Charles Moody emphasized
during the meeting that the legal problems facing
fraternities would not be solved by implementing a
dry Rush.
"I think we're kidding ourselves a little bit if we
think we're removing all our liability by having a dry
Rush," Moody said. "We'll still be having parties on
the weekends with the same people, still under age,
and many times the parties aren't in the house, which
adds another dangerous factor."
Moody added that "dry Rush has its merits . . . but
it's not going to take care of our problems."
