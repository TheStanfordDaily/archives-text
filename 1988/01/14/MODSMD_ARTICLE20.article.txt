## Brain burritos: food for thought 
### Alan Burdick 
With classes underway, does your
brain still suffer from the vacation
vegetable syndrome? Does it need
some stimulation?
The best forms of brain food to
be found are sesos and cabeza bur
ritos from Farolita Taquicria on
Mission Street at 24th Avenue in
San Fransico.
Well, to be honest, the brain and
the head burritos don't taste that
great. But alternatives abound:
beef, chicken, pork and a surpris
ingly tasty tongue. And if the decor
at Farolita doesn't jibe with you,
the even snazzier Taquicria San
Jose sits on the opposite corner.
These tacquierias arc authentic
and look it: glaring white interiors,
cafeteria-style tables and jukeboxes
with Spanish-only hits.
Taquaieria San Jose is always
alive with particrs coming from or
on their way to Cesar's Latin
Palace, that hopping Mission club
run by the perennial Hispanic can
didate for mayor, Cesar Ascarunz.
San Jose is open until 3 a.m., and
there's a line at the register even
then.
The burritos arc simple: your
choicc of filling, wrapped in a fresh
flour tortilla with plenty of beans,
rice, green onions and coriander,
and hot salsa. And they're simply
huge — like, about the size of your
head. Okay, maybe as big as your
forearm. Still, for $2 apiece — that's
less than it costs to take Caltrain
— this is by far the best burrito in
the entire Bay Area.
For you connoisseurs, the best
pork and beef burritos are at San
Jose. Farolita, meanwhile, has the
better tongue and chickcn; you'll
know you're in the right place when
you notice the faded mural of a
meat grinder on the back wall.

Great vegetarian burritos can be
found at El Patio on Mission Street
at 28th Avenue, and La Cumbre
on Valencia Street at 17th Avenue
serves what is, by all accounts, a
most incredible steak burrito.
Debra Iyall, former lead singer of
Romeo Void, was recently spotted
at La Cumbre eating two steak bur
ritos — so keep your eyes peeled.
But moving ahead to the cabeza.
I had been intrigued by the thought
of a cabeza burrito for some time,
and finally decided to see what the
head entails (no, not entrails).
Imagine: If the tongue and the
brain are already accounted for,
what's left to be called "head"?
And whose head is it? As a wise
monk/insurance salesman in

Panang once said to an overly in
quisitive Western visitor, "Don't
question."
But I must admit, it was very
difficult to keep my mind off the
origin of these sweet meats as I
devoured them. Especially the
brain, which had the texture of
dense tofu — not something you
regularly experience in a burrito.
All votes tallied, the cabeza
emerged the heads-up winner, en
dowed as it was with a slightly tangy
flavor. Whether this flavor was ac
tually pleasant is another matter.
Let me just say, in light of my
pre-transfcr days at the University
of Chicago and now this brief ex
posure to head and brain burritos,

that the life of the mind is educa
tional once, but not worth repeat
ing. But don't forget the burrito
alternatives at Farolita and Ta
quieria San Jose. The chicken, beef,
pork and especially the tongue
(really!) are indisputably fine selec
tions.
There are rumors about great
burritos in the Haight. Disregard
this unenlightened talk. Do you buy
Polish sausage in Chinatown? Do
you go to Manhattan for California
cuisine? Burritos (and Latin
Freezes, San Francisco's Best
Treat-On-A-Stick) are synonymous
with the Mission. A burrito from
anywhere else is unauthentic,
flavorless and a waste of your two
bucks.
