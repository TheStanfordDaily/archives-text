With two long weekends and
spring break on the way, students
searching for inexpensive, in
vigorating, and adventurous out
door activities should look at of
ferings by Stanford Outdoor Ad
ventures and Recreation
(SOAR) this quarter.
For students who are natural
couch potatoes, this is a chance
to find out exactly how much
fun skiing, hiking, camping, rock
climbing and rafting can be. This
quarter SOAR is planning a full
range of one- to two-day trips
and clinics in nearby California
wilderness area.
According to SOAR Director
Mary Duffy, this year, the fifth
year SOAR activities have been
offered, is expected to be par
ticularly successful because of
the wide selection of events that
students have to choose from.
A one-day skiing trip to the
Kirkwood area at Lake Tahoe
is planned for this Saturday. For
beginning skiers, the trip in
cludes round-trip transportation,
a skiing lesson, an all-day lift
ticket, and equipment. For more
advanced skiers, transportation
and an all-day lift ticket are in
cluded in the trip package, which
costs $42 for students and $50
for non-students.
Also on Saturday, SOAR is
offering a trip to see the Ano
Nuevo elephant seals. A guided
two-hour tour of the famous
seals and their pups costs only
$5. The trip leaves at 9 a.m. and

returns at 5 p.m.
One of the most popular trips
of the quarter is the annual
Whale Watching and Monterey
Bay Aquarium excursion. This
outing, planned for Jan. 30, is a
day trip that includes a boat trip
to see the spectacular annual mi
gration of the gray whale.
The boating trip leaves from
Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey
and is conducted by a trained
naturalist who will help students
spot not only whales but also
otters, marine birds and sea
lions.
The excursion also inludes a
trip to the internationally ac
claimed Monterey Bay
Aquarium, which plays host to
more than 5000 live marine crea
tures, including sharks, oc
topuses and bat rays. Also
notable in the aquarium are the
kelp forest and touch pools, a
participatory exhibit. Transpor
tation, the cost of museum ad
mission and boat, and the group
leader are all part of this $32
trip.
SOAR programs are struc
tured for all members of the
Stanford community. Under
graduates, graduates, interna
tional students, faculty and com
munity members are encouraged
to sign up for the clinics and
trips.
According to Duffy, "people
often feel threatened by the fact
that they don't know much about
the sports or that they don't
know any of the people who are
