With two long weekends and

For students who are natural

fun skiing, hiking, camping, rock
climbing and rafting can be. This
quarter SOAR is planning a full
range of one- to two-day trips

wilderness area.
According to SOAR Director
Mary Duffy, this year, the fifth

ticularly successful because of
the wide selection of events that
students have to choose from.
A one-day skiing trip to the
Kirkwood area at Lake Tahoe

One of the most popular trips

The boating trip leaves from

more than 5000 live marine crea

tured for all members of the
Stanford community. Under

trips.
According to Duffy, "people
often feel threatened by the fact
that they don't know much about
the sports or that they don't
know any of the people who are
going on the trips. But those sorts
of fears and worries always break
down really fast when you get
started and go outdoors."
"If people are interested in doing
outdoor stuff and haven't spent a
lot of time doing things, that doesn't
mean that the program isn't open
to them," Duffy said. "We cater to
beginners."
