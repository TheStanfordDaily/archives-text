## Stop the 3-pointer 
### 
Have you noticed that college
basketball is beginning to
resemble skeet shooting?
All sorts of shots are being
launched from 19 feet, 9 inches,
and beyond, and many of those
shots rattle around the rim with
all the grace of a clay pigeon.

It's the 3-point rule's fault, and
it's a shame.
In its first full-fledged season
last year, the 3-point shot reared
its head in the form of two Final
Four teams, Providence and UN
LV. And now everyone's doing
it.
Witness the Arizona, Ken
tucky or Seton Hall fast breaks,
where the players no longer fill
the lanes. Instead, at least one
guy stops at the 3-point line and
waits for the kick-out pass. The
flow of the game is deserted for
the fly of a "trey," as 3-point
shots are referred to.
Something about the chal

lenge of a dunk or the blocking
or charging fouls on layups made
basketball exciting. Probably it
was the controlled violence of
momentarily dislodging the rim
or colliding with an opponent on
the way to the goal.
Somehow a skinny kid air
mailing a special challenge from
20 feet out that has less than a
50 percent chance of arriving just
doesn't measure up.
Sure, one of the reasons for
the rule was to give the shorter
folk a new weapon. Save the
game from the big men, who get
bigger every year. But although
most 6-footers can't dunk, all 7-
footers can shoot the 3-point
shot. And they're doing it too
often.
Maybe it's the novelty of the
3-point stripe â€” the 6-foot-8 guy
says, "I've got to try this, man.
I know I can make it." But they
rarely do. Nine of the top 10
3-point shooters in the Pacific
10 conference are guards. Who's
rebounding when Danny Man
ning shoots from way out there?
Supporters of the 3-point shot
say it makes the game more ex
citing. Trailing teams now have
