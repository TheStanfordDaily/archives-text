# Cardinal hoops hosts Huskies
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
The Washington Huskies enter
Maples Pavilion tonight with a new
perspective on life: a view from the
cellar.
After appearances in the NIT and
the NCAA tournament the last two
seasons, Head Coach Andy Russo
brings a young team still looking for
its first Pacific 10 Conference victory
into this evening's 7:35 contest with
the Stanford Cardinal. The Huskies
sport a 4-8 record overall, 0-3 in the
conference.
Stanford, meanwhile, is equally
smarting after losing to Arizona State
and Arizona last weekend. The Car
dinal is currently in fourth place in
the Pac-10 with a 2-2 record and has
a 10-5 mark overall.
With three consecutive home
games on the slate, the Stanford team
is looking to reverse its momentum.
"This is a really important game
for us, coming off two losses in
Arizona," Stanford senior Greg But
ler said. "Whenever you lose two in
a row, the team can get down, and
the crowd can get down on you. If
we lose, it'll really hurt our confidence
and the crowd's confidence."
The Huskies arc currently in far
worse shape. All three of their Pac-10
losses came at home. Washington lost
only two conference games at home

all last year.
One bright spot for the Huskies
has been sophomore guard Eldridge
Recasner. Recasner leads the Pac-10
in scoring with 21.7 points per con
ference game and is shooting 94 per
cent from the foul line in conference
play.
"Recasner is a very good guard
who handles the ball well, is capable
of scoring and provides leadership for
the team," Cardinal Coach Mike
Montgomery said.
Yes, a sophomore leads the
Huskies, who are obviously extremely
young. The rest of the starting lineup
features freshman guard Anthony
Jenkins, sophomore forward Jeff
Sanor, freshman forward Mike
Hayward and sophomore center Mark
West. Hayward went to Sir Francis
Drake High School in San Rafael.
Home has been a good thing for
the Cardinal squad, which defeated
both USC and UCLA last month at
Maples. "It's a lot easier to win at
home," Butler said. "But if you don't,
you start to question yourself."
Stanford guard Todd Lichti will
most probably move into ninth place
on the Cardinal all-time scoring list
tonight. Lichti, who has 1322 points,
needs 6 points to pass Art Harris
(1966-68).

Point guard Terry Taylor is the Cardinal's leading long-range bomber,
burying 3-pointers at a clip of nearly 51 percent.
