The Stanford women's basketball team
will try to turn Pullman into an oversized
petting zoo tonight, when the Cardinal
tries to tame the Washington State
Cougars and extend Stanford's winning
streak to 14 games. The Cardinal will
face Washington Saturday night.
Washington State is currently 5-5 over
all and 0-1 in Pacific 10 Conference play,
losing its Pac-10 opener last weekend to
No. 17 Washington 81-72.
Stanford, by contrast, has a perfect
13-0 record and is a perfect 2-0 in league
competition after dropping Arizona 101 -
71 and Arizona State 84-66. The pair of
wins was good enough to move the team
up from No. 11 to an unprecedented No.
10 on the Associated Press poll, the first
top-10 appearance in Stanford women's
basketball history.
"We're really excited to play both

Washington and Washington State,"
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"Washington State has gotten more
publicity, but they are both really good
teams in different ways.
"Washington State is a really good
three-point shooting team, kind of a more
physical team. It's going to be a great
game, really exciting."
The Cougars' balanced offense will cer
tainly try the Cardinal's defense. Five
members of the squad, including four of
the starters, are averaging more than 10
points per game, led by junior forward
Jonni Gray with 14 ppg.
If Stanford's impressive offense kicks
into gear as it did last weekend, the
Cardinal will not only overshadow the
Cougars but will simply overpower them.
Led by the dynamic duo of point guards
Jennifer Azzi and Pac-10 Player of the
Week Sonya Henning, Stanford scored
an amazing 185 points against the
Arizona schools.

Once again, center Jill Yanke and for
wards Katy Steding and Trisha Stevens
will join Azzi and Henning in the starting
lineup. Yanke, a junior, is the team's
second highest scorer behind the soph
omore Azzi with 13.9 ppg, while
sohomore Steding leads the team in
rebounds with a hefty 7.6 boards per
game.
Stevens is no slouch either, often com
ing up with important plays like the game
winning free throws at Brigham Young
last month.
"She's up and down, but a little more
up than down," VanDerveer said. "We
really need her defense."
Another freshman forward, Celeste
Lavoie, has bolstered the Cardinal effort
and has the scars to prove it. Last
weekend against Arizona State, she suf
fered a severe ankle sprain after amassing
an impressive eight rebounds in 12
minutes, but she has recovered enough
to resume play this weekend.
