# Trotters a Maples delight

Surprise, surprise, the Globetrot
ters won again.
But what a show it was. In front
of yet another sellout crowd, the
Harlequin Houdinis of the
Hardwood bedazzled the hapless
Washington Generals, winning 93-
79 for their 5830 th consecutive vic
tory.
The high-pitched cheers of the
many children in the crowd inspired
the Trotters from the beginning.
"The crowd motivates us to do what
we do," said James "Twiggy"
Sanders, who replaced Gueese
Ausbie as the "Clown Prince of
Basketball."
"Without them (the children),
there would be no Harlem
Globetrotters," he said.
As always, the winningest team
in sports history began its show with
the one and only Magic Circle to
the tune of "Sweet Georgia Brown."
Nowhere else does the ball move
the way it does in there.
The crowd was treated through
out the night to every imaginable
version of the famous Three-Man
Weave. With "Twiggy" at the helm
and players like Clyde "The Glide"
Austin and Osborne "The Wizard"

Lockhart running circles around the
seemingly paralyzed Generals, the
Trotters gave the crowd plenty of
slam dunks and double-pump
layups to cheer about.
Then there were, of course, the
antics in the crowd. The Purse Trick
was especially effective as the poor
victim's only goal was to retrieve
her purse and hide her apple-red
face.
The Water Bucket Routine was
hilarious as usual. A group of stu
dents tried to outsmart the Trotters
as they produced raincoats when
Lockhart prepared to douse Robert
"Skywalker" Wallace with the
bucket of water. But as usual the
Trotters had the last laugh as the
bucket was filled with confetti.
The 1988 World Tour showcased
two new female faces, Sandra
"Sweetness" Hodge and Joyce "The
Juice" Walker. Both displayed
amazing ball control, scoring off the
Weave on behind-the-back and
through-the-legs layups.
The Trotters also debuted their
new Court Jester, Matthew "Sho
wbiz" Jackson. He added a new
and exciting dimension to the show.
His comic talents were obvious from
the beginning as he stole the
microphone from the announcer
and proceeded to construct his

"Globetrotter Rap." He also did
his best to serenade an angered
referee, but the only teary-eyed
people on the court were his team
mates.
But without question, "Twiggy"
was the center of attention. No mat
ter what he did, it was funny. His
spaghetti-like body enabled him to
hold the ball around the man guard
ing him and still score. His laugh
made the crowd laugh, and when
he teamed up with Dedrick "Hea
dley" Reffigee, whom "Twiggy"
calls "a huge 7-foot teddy bear,"
and Harold "Bobo" Hubbard, the
slapstick becomes nearly un
bearable.
Even on his own, "Twiggy" is
outrageous. At one point he tried
to shoot the ball into one of the
side baskets that was hoisted 40
feet above him. And one cannot
describe his antics with young
children. He attempted to trade a
five-year old from San Lorenzo
Elementary School with Gerald
Hooks, the Generals' captain. It al
most worked, except for the protest
of the child's mother.
If you've never seen the
Globetrotters, see them. Their show
is unique, the antics are out of this
world, and there is no other group
that can so captivate an audience.
