# High schools lose free press

The Supreme Court yesterday
upheld a high school principal's de
cision to censor part of his school's
student publication, but law profes
sors here say the ruling affects only
high-school newspapers.
"[The decision] is about high
schools," said Law Prof. Robert
Weisberg, "not about newspapers."
In the 5-3 decision, the court
ruled that Robert Reynolds, prin
cipal of Hazelwood East High
School in Hazelwood, Mo., did not
violate students' right of free speech
when he deleted two pages from

the school-sponsored, student
produced newspaper, the Spectrum.
Reynolds refused to publish two
articles in 1983 concerning personal
accounts of teen-age pregnancy by
three Hazelwood East students and
the effect of divorce on children.
School policy required the principal
to review all articles before they
appeared the the publication, which
is the project of a journalism class
there.
Justice Byron White, writing the
decision for the court, stated, "A
school need not tolerate student
speech that is inconsistent with its
basic educational mission, even
though the government could not

censor similar speech outside the
school."
According to Weisberg, the ruling
only applies to issues within high
schools.
"The question is whether the de
cision will extend to different
newspapers or different issues in
public schools," Weisberg said. "It
will have nothing to do with non
university papers and nothing to do
with university papers either."
Law Prof. John Kaplan said the
owner of a newspaper is the only
person with freedom of the press.
"The decision didn't surprise
me," he said. "The school publishes
the (Missouri) paper and thus
decides what should be in it."
