# Stanford adopts school
## University to assist students in East Palo Alto 
### Otto Lin Staff writer 
Last night, 40 children from East Palo Alto were
treated to the spectacular antics of the Harlem
Globetrotters at Maples Pavilion. They were among
the first beneficiaries of a new partnership between
Stanford University and Costano School that will
allow Costano students to take advantage of the
University's academic, financial and human re
sources.
Under the new program, Stanford will "adopt"
Costano, an East Palo Alto elementary school, and
Stanford faculty and students will work directly with
Costano staff to help the children both inside and
outside the classroom.
"The kids (at Costano) are all very excited about
this," says Magdalena Fittoria, coordinator of tutor
programs for the Public Service Center.
Costano Principal Joseph Davis agreed. "The
children are very enthused," he said. "As a result
of the tutoring, the kids have a very positive image
of Stanford students. . . . Several warm relationships
have developed over the past few years between
Stanford tutors and the students here."
According to Fittoria, one goal of the new part
nership will be to increase the involvement of faculty
and staff. She said many faculty members — in

eluding Dean of the School of Education Michael
Smith — have already expressed interest in the
program, which will be discussed by a University
wide committee Jan. 29.
Fittoria described the staff at Costano as "highly
supportive," and said there have already been
several requests by Costano teachers for help in
the classroom.
She stressed that the purpose of this program is
not primarily to create opportunities for sociological
research, but to help Costano students in all aspects
of their lives.
Davis expressed hope that Stanford students can
continue tutoring over the summer so that the
Costano students "will be better able to retain what
they learned the year before."
Scheduled and ongoing activities include an over
night trip to Sacramento to learn about state gov
ernment and California history, a newspaper club,
a pen-pal program between Costano students and
a Central American refugee community, and a
Baylands bird-watching tour led by University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy.
This partnership is part of the San Mateo County
Office of Education Adopt-a-School program, which
pairs public high schools with selected institutions.
There are presently 35 partnerships in San Mateo
County.
