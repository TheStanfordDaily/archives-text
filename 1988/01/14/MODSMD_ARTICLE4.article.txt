# University bans stadium smoking

No smoking will be allowed in
Stanford's outdoor athletics
facilities, Athletic Department offi
cials announced yesterday.
According to Assoc. Athletic Di
rector Alan Cummings, smoking
will not be permitted in the seating
and aisle areas of Stanford's out
door athletics facilities, beginning
with the baseball team's Jan. 29
opener at Sunken Diamond.
The rule also applies to Stanford
Stadium, Sunken Diamond, the
Tennis Stadium, Maloney Field,
deGuerrc Pool and the field hockey
field.
The decision comes after the
Committee on Athletics, Physical
Education, and Recreation
(CAPER) recommended that
smokers attending outdoor athletic
events be segregated. Rather than
disrupting the seating of longtime
ticket-holders by developing
smoking sections, said Cummings,
the Athletic Department decided
not to permit smoking.
Additionally, the University's Ad
Hoc Committee on Smoking
Guidelines has recommended that
a similar ban be created at all out
door facilities, including Frost Am
phitheater. The committee's recom
mendation will be presented to the
Administrative Council next month.
The extent of the decision came
as a surprise to some — including
Frances Conley, associate professor
of surgery and chairperson of
CAPER. "As a health care profes
sional, I'm extremely pleased with
the way this committee and the Ath
letic Department has acted," she
said. "They (the Athletic Depart
ment) went much farther than we

had hoped they would."
Cummings downplayed any nega
tive effect the ban may have on
support from fans who smoke.
"There will be a minimum of in
convenience because spectators can
move to concourses or other out
door spaces if they want to smoke,"
he said.
The effect of the ban on alumni
ticket sales will also be slight, Cum
mings predicted, noting that it may
attract more nonsmoking alumni to
athletic events. Gary Bruner, assis
tant athletic director of Marketing,
Promotions and Events, agreed.
"Certainly it will have some effect
(on the number of smokers attend
ing games), but in my opinion that
effect will be minimal," he said.
The ban is expected to have little
effect on student attendance. Ac
cording to Ana Kozlowski, a Cowell
aerobics coordinator, only about six
percent of Stanford students smoke.
Bruner said the new ruling would
be printed in all season-ticket ap
plications, starting with applications
for football tickets scheduled to be
mailed out next month.
Cummings added that no signs
within the stadiums will remind fans
of the ban. "We don't expect a
problem with enforcement," said
Cummings. "If someone ignores the
signs, the people around them will
let them know it. It won't be much
different than enforcement of no
smoking rules that already exist in
our inside athletic facilities."
Tuesday, Alumni Association Ex
ecutive Director William Stone
downplayed any possible alumni op
position to smoking restrictions,
saying, "You can never guess what
125.CKX) alumni will think."
