# Alabama voter drive opens students' minds, hearts
## Inside 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
The following is a personal account of the
recent voter registration effort undertaken
in the South by a delegation of Stanford
students sponsored in part by the Black
Student union.

Last quarter 1 heard that the Black Stu
dent Union was sponsoring a trip to Ala
bama to take part in "Project Democracy,"
an effort to register black voters in the
Deep South. I was intrigued by the idea,
and as I continued to think about it, 1
became more and more impressed.
For a long time, I had developed ideals
and theories about how society needs to
be changed for the better, about the work
that needs to be done. Only I hadn't found

a way to transform some of my idealism
and commitment into acefn. Project
Democracy seemed to be just such a ve
hicle. So I applied to go, and was accepted.
For what it's worth — primarily because
those of us who went feel a need to share
our experiences — the following are my
thoughts and recollections from a signifi
cant trip, not as a Daily reporter but as
an individual.
Saturday, Jan. 2: Wc arrived in Atlanta
from all parts of the country. At an ori
entation we heard from the Reverend C.T.
Vivian and local activist Ellen Spears.
Vivian's formidable task was to try to ex
plain the South's situation to a group of
uninformed Californians.
"Democracy," he told us, "doesn't come
from laws." Fie said it comes, as wc would

see for ourselves later, from people making
sure that the laws are being enforced. He
pointed out that the Voting Rights Act,
which took away the barriers to voter reg
istration in 1965, is still only a temporary
measure. In the 1970s and again in 1982,
the U. S. Congress had to vote on whether
or not to extend the law that gives blacks
the franchise. Democracy, we would find
out, takes more than words.
Sunday, Jan. 3: Before leaving Atlanta
for Alabama we stopped at Ebenezer Bap
tist Church to attend the mid-morning ser
vice. Ebenezer was Martin Luther King
vSr.'s church and is still an important fixture
in southern black culture. We were intro
duced to the congregation, and after songs
and announcements. Senior Pastor Joseph
Roberts lit into his sermon.

For nearly an hour, Roberts roared.
Dynamic and purposeful, he mixed biblical
stories and quotations with current events
and concerns, including child abuse and
nuclear war. I'm not a church goer in
general, but I found myself feeling wel
comed by the congregation and moved by
the sentiment behind the sermon — that
of caring and concern. It was the beginning
of a week-long confirmation of the cliche
about "southern hospitality."
That afternoon we left for Selma, Ala.
After arriving in the early evening, we
heard from long-time activists who had
worked with Martin Lirther King Jr. in the
early 19605. Twenty-five years later, they're
still busy. Alabama State Senator Hank
Sancf?rs, a Harvard Law School graduate,
told us he "hadn't had a boring day since
coming to Selma 16 years ago."

That night I stayed up late, furiously
writing letters. I felt like I had to convey
all of my many feelings and impressions
to people at home. I fell asleep about 3
a.m., excited about what was to come, al
most in awe of the committed people we
had met.
Monday and Tuesday, Jan. 4-5: Senator
Sanders had put us up in his house. We
got up early, rotated through the bathtub,
and set out early for nearby Perry County,
a rural small town area in which we would
spend the next two days going door-to
door.
Perry County is part of the Alabama
"Black Belt," an 11-county area that is 65
percent black. Currently only five of those
