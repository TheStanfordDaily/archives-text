# Alabama voter drive opens students' minds, hearts
## Inside 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
The following is a personal account of the
recent voter registration effort undertaken
in the South by a delegation of Stanford
students sponsored in part by the Black
Student union.

Last quarter 1 heard that the Black Stu
dent Union was sponsoring a trip to Ala
bama to take part in "Project Democracy,"
an effort to register black voters in the
Deep South. I was intrigued by the idea,
and as I continued to think about it, 1
became more and more impressed.
For a long time, I had developed ideals
and theories about how society needs to
be changed for the better, about the work
that needs to be done. Only I hadn't found

a way to transform some of my idealism
and commitment into acefn. Project
Democracy seemed to be just such a ve
hicle. So I applied to go, and was accepted.
For what it's worth — primarily because
those of us who went feel a need to share
our experiences — the following are my
thoughts and recollections from a signifi
cant trip, not as a Daily reporter but as
an individual.
Saturday, Jan. 2: Wc arrived in Atlanta
from all parts of the country. At an ori
entation we heard from the Reverend C.T.
Vivian and local activist Ellen Spears.
Vivian's formidable task was to try to ex
plain the South's situation to a group of
uninformed Californians.
"Democracy," he told us, "doesn't come
from laws." Fie said it comes, as wc would

see for ourselves later, from people making
sure that the laws are being enforced. He
pointed out that the Voting Rights Act,
which took away the barriers to voter reg
istration in 1965, is still only a temporary
measure. In the 1970s and again in 1982,
the U. S. Congress had to vote on whether
or not to extend the law that gives blacks
the franchise. Democracy, we would find
out, takes more than words.
Sunday, Jan. 3: Before leaving Atlanta
for Alabama we stopped at Ebenezer Bap
tist Church to attend the mid-morning ser
vice. Ebenezer was Martin Luther King
vSr.'s church and is still an important fixture
in southern black culture. We were intro
duced to the congregation, and after songs
and announcements. Senior Pastor Joseph
Roberts lit into his sermon.

For nearly an hour, Roberts roared.
Dynamic and purposeful, he mixed biblical
stories and quotations with current events
and concerns, including child abuse and
nuclear war. I'm not a church goer in
general, but I found myself feeling wel
comed by the congregation and moved by
the sentiment behind the sermon — that
of caring and concern. It was the beginning
of a week-long confirmation of the cliche
about "southern hospitality."
That afternoon we left for Selma, Ala.
After arriving in the early evening, we
heard from long-time activists who had
worked with Martin Lirther King Jr. in the
early 19605. Twenty-five years later, they're
still busy. Alabama State Senator Hank
Sancf?rs, a Harvard Law School graduate,
told us he "hadn't had a boring day since
coming to Selma 16 years ago."

That night I stayed up late, furiously
writing letters. I felt like I had to convey
all of my many feelings and impressions
to people at home. I fell asleep about 3
a.m., excited about what was to come, al
most in awe of the committed people we
had met.
Monday and Tuesday, Jan. 4-5: Senator
Sanders had put us up in his house. We
got up early, rotated through the bathtub,
and set out early for nearby Perry County,
a rural small town area in which we would
spend the next two days going door-to
door.
Perry County is part of the Alabama
"Black Belt," an 11-county area that is 65
percent black. Currently only five of those
11 counties have a representative
number of black leaders in office.
Our guide for the two days was
Albert Turner, a local politician
and longtime civil-rights activist
who led nis first voter registration
drive in 1962, well before any of
us were born.
To our surprise, Turner told us
that most of the blacks in Perry
County were already registered to
vote. After 30 years of work, most
of them have been identified and
registered. The problem he faces
now is getting people out to vote
for every election.
Often they don't vote because
they don't think that new leaders
will change anything. Our challenge
was to convince them that this time
it could be different. With local and
national elections coming up, par
ticularly Super Tuesday, March 8,
when 14 Southern states will hold
presidential primaries, 1988 is a his
toric time.
We told the people that what
happens this year will shape the
country for a long time to come.
Our contribution, Turner said,
would be one of motivation. Seeing
a large group like ours, made up
of people who cared enough to
come out and learn for themselves
what was going on, would move
people to vote.
We went to Uniontown, popula
tion approximately 2000, just about
all black. Critics of the trip had
questions why it was aimed at black
voters; actually being there made
it clear: Of all the ethnic groups in
the United States, blacks in the

South are clearly the most ex
ploited, the most economically de
pressed and the least fairly
represented in state and local gov
ernment.
In Uniontown we knocked on the
doors of houses propped up by ce
ment blocks, with cracks in the walls
that showed into the living rooms.
Almost a fifth of Uniontown's res
idents have outhouses instead of
indoor plumbing.
We also found that after entering
a black town, one didn't have the
opportunity to register too many
whites. The rural South is still ex
tremely segregated. Blacks live in
black areas, whites in white. Simple
as that.
The first day we were there, the
population seemed uneasy with our
presence. Two members of the del
egation were even asked if they
were FBI agents. That gave us all
a laugh, until we were told why
they had asked.
In 1985, spurred by then-U.S.
Sen. Jeremiah Denton (R-Ala.), the
Department of Justice had investi
gated the five black-governed
counties on charges of voter fraud.
(The black counties with white gov
ernments, as well as the white
counties, were left alone). The
charges were nothing but
propaganda: Of 210 indictments,
only four minor charges stuck, and
they were subsequently overturned.
But in the process of the investi
gation, many voters were in
timidated.
The next day, after word had
passed through the small town that
we were there to help, the people
became noticeably more friendly.

Many would invite us in to their
homes and keep us there to talk
as long as we could stay.
We, coming from more or less
middle-class homes and comforta
ble berths at Stanford, were as
tounded that people could live in
such a poverty-stricken area and
still be so warm and optimistic
towards outsiders.
I wrote in my notebook that
night, 'Poverty was everywhere, yet
the people as a community were
more friendly than any I've ever
encountered.'
Wednesday, Jan. 6: We left Selma
in the morning for Montgomery,

the capital of Alabama, where local
activists held a press conference at
Martin Luther King Jr.'s church.
Across the street, on top of the
state capital building, the Con
federate flag was flying. We toured
Montgomery for a couple of hours
and then headed for Epes, a rural
farming town of 300 people in west
ern Alabama.
Thursday and Friday, Jan. 7-8:
In Epes we stayed at a dormitory
owned by the Federation of South
ern Cooperatives, an umbrella or
ganization for black farmers across
the South. Members of the coop
eratives work together to buy raw

materials and supplies at a bulk
rate and then sign large, higher
paying contracts for their group's
finished products.
Our plan had been to register
voters in Epes and the surrounding
towns, but freezing rain (a rare oc
currence in Alabama) made that
impossible. Instead, we spent the
two days seeing different towns and
speaking with a variety of elected
officials involved in the struggle to
raise the population's standard of
living.
In Sumter County (where we
were staying) we saw a hazardous
waste dump run by a company
called Chemical Waste Manage
ment. That one site, we found, is
the largest toxic waste dump in the
country. Another large corporation,
American Can, owns approximately
40 percent of the land in Sumter
County and logs the land without
paying proper taxes.
Because of the lack of tax dollars,
as well a lack of any interest on
the part of the local government in
using the county's resources effec
tively, Sumter County has only one
public park and no public swimming
pools. There were, however, houses
and livestock located less than a
half-mile from the toxic waste
dump.
Talking to the leaders, we found
that progress is being made. The
fact that there were some elected
black officials (in majority black
counties) was in itself a positive
sign. Yet, as all of them stressed,
things won't get any better until
both the poor blacks and poor
whites have more economic influ
ence in the region and are able to

keep plants like Chem-Waste away.
We found that although the poor
whites lived in separate areas and
didn't support the black govern
ments, the problem in Alabama
was, to a large extent, economic.
Both poor whites and poor blacks
suffer, but racism has taught the
poor whites to blame their troubles
on the blacks.
While neither group owns much
land or has much money, outside
groups such as American Can reap
great profits. Looking at election
figures, we also found that after
black leaders had held office and
had begun to help their economi
cally depressed regions, more and
more poor whites became suppor
tive of their efforts.
Saturday, Jan. 9: On our way
back to Atlanta we talked about
what we had learned. We began to
see that our education has been
deficient; for all we have learned
in classes, we've never heard about
what goes on in areas like rural
Alabama. For all of our classes in
U.S. history, none of us had learned
much about Reconstruction, or
really encountered the notion that
all of the United State's problems
with civil rights weren't fixed by the
Voting Rights Act.
We also didn't realize just how
many things work to keep the poor,
especially the rural poor of this
country, anchored at the bottom of
the ladder. From the FBI to corrupt
local, state and national politicians
to big corporations, the forces
stacked against the poor and most
particularly the black poor of the
South, are tremendous.
