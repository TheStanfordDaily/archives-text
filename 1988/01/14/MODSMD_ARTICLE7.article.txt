Israel ignores U.S., expels 4 Arabs
JERUSALEM — Israel, defying repeated appeals from the United
States and a resolution of the U.N. Security Council, yesterday
expelled four Palestinians accused of masterminding demonstrations
against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The four Palestinians were flown in an army helicopter from a
prison at Nablus to Israel's self-proclaimed "security zone" inside
Lebanon. From there, they were taken by truck to a village north
of Hasbaya, where, Israel Radio said, they were released to an
unidentified "group of waiting men." It said the four men offered
no resistance.
Meanwhile, Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinian demonstra
tors in at least four places in the occupied territories, killing two
persons, including a 10-year-old boy, and wounding three others
as army reinforcements and tightened security measures failed to
curb the unrest.
Wire service reports from Beirut indicated that the four Pales
tinians may later have been moved to a Syrian military base in
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. It is not known what Syria will do with
the deportees. The Syrian government, like Egypt, Lebanon and
Jordan, had announced that it would not accept any Palestinians
deported by Israel.
The Israeli action drew immediate protests from abroad. The
International Committee of the Red Cross, in a statement issued
in Geneva, called Israel's action "a grave violation" of the 1949
Geneva Convention on treatment of civilians in a war zone and
said that "the forcible transfer of groups or individuals from the
occupied territories is forbidden by international humanitarian law."
Panel demands end io contra aid
PANAMA CITY, Panama — An international commission, rebuff
ing the Reagan administration, said yesterday that a "definitive
halt" of U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan resistance is "an indispensable
requirement for the success of. . . peace efforts" in Central America.
The commission, which included the foreign ministers of the five
Central American nations, also said that the regional peace agree
ment is deadlocked by the continuing U.S. support for the
Nicaraguan guerrillas and by non-compliance on the part of four
signatory nations.
In a detailed judgment of the peace accord signed Aug. 7 by
Central America's five presidents, the 13-nation verification com
mission set up to monitor the agreement urged the leaders to
negotiate "a plan of execution and a calendar of compliance" to
advance the peace process beyond this week's deadline.
The commission's generally upbeat report, more than 150 pages
long, is to be delivered to the presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua as they meet Friday in San
Jose, Costa Rica to evaluate the accord.
The Reagan administration has been pressing Nicaragua's four
neighbors to declare the peace plan a failure and to focus blame
on the Sandinista government in order to bolster a White House
bid for new aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels known as Contras. A
delegation led by Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, President Reagan's assistant
for national security affairs, last week visited the capitals of all four
countries to press administration views.
Taiwan leader dies, ending dynasty
TAIPEI, Taiwan — President Chiang Ching-kuo, son of
Nationalist Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek, died of a heart attack
yesterday, ending the family rule that led the Kuomintang, or
Nationalist Party, to prosperity on this island after fleeing the
mainland nearly four decades ago.
Vice President Lee Teng-hui was sworn in as president, making
him the first Taiwanese to become president since the arrival of
the Nationalists and possibly inaugurating an era of greater influence
for native-born Taiwanese, who make up 85 percent of the island's
19.5 million population. Taiwan's politics have been dominated by
an aging core of Chinese who fled to the island from the mainland
after their defeat by the Communists in 1949.
A 30-day period of mourning was declared and leaves were
canceled for the island's military forces.
In Beijing, the Communist government acknowledged the death
of Chiang, 77, with a short news item on the official New China
News Agency from Hong Kong, but made no comment.
Bush says lie had doubts over sale
FORT DODGE, lowa — Vice President Bush said for the first
time yesterday that in the presence of others he voiced reservations
about the secret Iran arms sales that went beyond his previously
stated concerns about the role of Israel in the covert operation.
Bush said, "I also had the concerns that I have when any covert
action is undertaken — how will it be interpreted if the cover is
blown? Will lives be lost? Will our credibility be damaged? Un
fortunately, my reservations turned out to be well-founded."
The vice president's comments came in written responses delivered
Wednesday to 17 questions posed by Washington Post columnist
Mary McGrory in her column Tuesday. Pressed by his rivals for a
fuller explanation of his role in the gravest foreign policy crisis of
the Reagan presidency, Bush has been taking a more aggressive
tack in responding to questions about it.
Bush's new reservations were not mentioned in the reports of
the Tower commission or of the congressional Iran-contra commit
tees' report. Under questioning by reporters for months, he has
not before mentioned these reservations. Up to now, the only
mention of how to deal with the problems of public exposure of
the arms sale, for example, came in testimony of then-White House
chief of staff Donald Regan. He told the Tower commission that
none of President Reagan's advisers "teed up for him of what the
downside risk would be here.... No one attempted to do this. I
don't believe the State Department in its presentation arguing
against this really brought out the sensitivity of this."
Ethics office probes Dole trust
WASHINGTON — The Office of Government Ethics is studying
a 1986 real estate transaction between the blind trust of former
transportation secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole and the company
of a former aide to her husband, Senate Minority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.), informed sources said yesterday.
The investigation is focusing on whether the managers of Elizabeth
Dole's blind trust may have breached their "fiduciary respon
sibilities" to insulate the trust from people associated with the
Doles, sources said.
The transaction occurred when David Owen, a former lieutenant
governor of Kansas and a longtime associate of Robert Dole, was
the trust's investment adviser. The trustee was Mark McConaghy,
who was chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation in
1981-83, when Dole was its chairman.
The former Dole aide whose company served as intermediary in
the December 1986 deal, John Palmer, was awarded a $26-million
contract with the Army 11 months earlier. Dole has publicly ac
knowledged urging the Small Business Administration to award the
contract to Palmer under its program for helping minority businesses.
Palmer, a prominent black Republican from Kansas, previously
had worked in Dole's Kansas City office.

a 1986 real estate transaction between the blind trust of former
transportation secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole and the company
of a former aide to her husband, Senate Minority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.), informed sources said yesterday.
The investigation is focusing on whether the managers of Elizabeth
Dole's blind trust may have breached their "fiduciary respon
sibilities" to insulate the trust from people associated with the
Doles, sources said.
The transaction occurred when David Owen, a former lieutenant
governor of Kansas and a longtime associate of Robert Dole, was
the trust's investment adviser. The trustee was Mark McConaghy,
who was chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation in
1981-83, when Dole was its chairman.
The former Dole aide whose company served as intermediary in
the December 1986 deal, John Palmer, was awarded a $26-million
contract with the Army 11 months earlier. Dole has publicly ac
knowledged urging the Small Business Administration to award the
contract to Palmer under its program for helping minority businesses.
Palmer, a prominent black Republican from Kansas, previously
had worked in Dole's Kansas City office.

Israel ignores U.S., expels 4 Arabs
JERUSALEM — Israel, defying repeated appeals from the United
States and a resolution of the U.N. Security Council, yesterday
expelled four Palestinians accused of masterminding demonstrations
against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The four Palestinians were flown in an army helicopter from a
prison at Nablus to Israel's self-proclaimed "security zone" inside
Lebanon. From there, they were taken by truck to a village north
of Hasbaya, where, Israel Radio said, they were released to an
unidentified "group of waiting men." It said the four men offered
no resistance.
Meanwhile, Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinian demonstra
tors in at least four places in the occupied territories, killing two
persons, including a 10-year-old boy, and wounding three others
as army reinforcements and tightened security measures failed to
curb the unrest.
Wire service reports from Beirut indicated that the four Pales
tinians may later have been moved to a Syrian military base in
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. It is not known what Syria will do with
the deportees. The Syrian government, like Egypt, Lebanon and
Jordan, had announced that it would not accept any Palestinians
deported by Israel.
The Israeli action drew immediate protests from abroad. The
International Committee of the Red Cross, in a statement issued
in Geneva, called Israel's action "a grave violation" of the 1949
Geneva Convention on treatment of civilians in a war zone and
said that "the forcible transfer of groups or individuals from the
occupied territories is forbidden by international humanitarian law."
Panel demands end io contra aid
PANAMA CITY, Panama — An international commission, rebuff
ing the Reagan administration, said yesterday that a "definitive
halt" of U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan resistance is "an indispensable
requirement for the success of. . . peace efforts" in Central America.
The commission, which included the foreign ministers of the five
Central American nations, also said that the regional peace agree
ment is deadlocked by the continuing U.S. support for the
Nicaraguan guerrillas and by non-compliance on the part of four
signatory nations.
In a detailed judgment of the peace accord signed Aug. 7 by
Central America's five presidents, the 13-nation verification com
mission set up to monitor the agreement urged the leaders to
negotiate "a plan of execution and a calendar of compliance" to
advance the peace process beyond this week's deadline.
The commission's generally upbeat report, more than 150 pages
long, is to be delivered to the presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua as they meet Friday in San
Jose, Costa Rica to evaluate the accord.
The Reagan administration has been pressing Nicaragua's four
neighbors to declare the peace plan a failure and to focus blame
on the Sandinista government in order to bolster a White House
bid for new aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels known as Contras. A
delegation led by Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, President Reagan's assistant
for national security affairs, last week visited the capitals of all four
countries to press administration views.
Taiwan leader dies, ending dynasty
TAIPEI, Taiwan — President Chiang Ching-kuo, son of
Nationalist Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek, died of a heart attack
yesterday, ending the family rule that led the Kuomintang, or
Nationalist Party, to prosperity on this island after fleeing the
mainland nearly four decades ago.
Vice President Lee Teng-hui was sworn in as president, making
him the first Taiwanese to become president since the arrival of
the Nationalists and possibly inaugurating an era of greater influence
for native-born Taiwanese, who make up 85 percent of the island's
19.5 million population. Taiwan's politics have been dominated by
an aging core of Chinese who fled to the island from the mainland
after their defeat by the Communists in 1949.
A 30-day period of mourning was declared and leaves were
canceled for the island's military forces.
In Beijing, the Communist government acknowledged the death
of Chiang, 77, with a short news item on the official New China
News Agency from Hong Kong, but made no comment.
Bush says lie had doubts over sale
FORT DODGE, lowa — Vice President Bush said for the first
time yesterday that in the presence of others he voiced reservations
about the secret Iran arms sales that went beyond his previously
stated concerns about the role of Israel in the covert operation.
Bush said, "I also had the concerns that I have when any covert
action is undertaken — how will it be interpreted if the cover is
blown? Will lives be lost? Will our credibility be damaged? Un
fortunately, my reservations turned out to be well-founded."
The vice president's comments came in written responses delivered
Wednesday to 17 questions posed by Washington Post columnist
Mary McGrory in her column Tuesday. Pressed by his rivals for a
fuller explanation of his role in the gravest foreign policy crisis of
the Reagan presidency, Bush has been taking a more aggressive
tack in responding to questions about it.
Bush's new reservations were not mentioned in the reports of
the Tower commission or of the congressional Iran-contra commit
tees' report. Under questioning by reporters for months, he has
not before mentioned these reservations. Up to now, the only
mention of how to deal with the problems of public exposure of
the arms sale, for example, came in testimony of then-White House
chief of staff Donald Regan. He told the Tower commission that
none of President Reagan's advisers "teed up for him of what the
downside risk would be here.... No one attempted to do this. I
don't believe the State Department in its presentation arguing
against this really brought out the sensitivity of this."
