# Reagan, Japanese leader talk
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - President
Reagan gave Japanese Prime Min
ister Noboru Takeshita the
strongest pledge to date that the
United States will resist any further
decline in the value of the dollar
and praised Takeshita's defense
and economic policies in a meeting
at the White House yesterday.
Reagan, however, prodded the
new Japanese leader to open up
his nation's markets to more United
States farm imports and to allow
American construction companies
to participate in public works proj
ects in Japan.
In a joint statement, the two
leaders announced that new ar
rangements have been made to in
sure adequate funds to support the
dollar, which lost 21 percent of its
value against the yen last year.
Gains in the yen's value make
Japanese goods more expensive on
the world market, undercutting the
competitiveness of their exports.
Both Takeshita and other
Japanese officials made it clear that
the agreement to stabilize exchange
rates was the plum of the trip for
the new prime minister, his first to
the U.S. since taking office Nov. 6.

"The stability of exchange rates
is indispensable" to achievement of
economic goals shared by both
nations," Takeshita said in a state
ment to reporters.
For the United States, gains were
more amorphous.
Reagan — who spent two hours
with Takeshita, despite suffering an
episode of nausea and vomiting that
had kept him up much of the pre
vious night — said that he was
"pleased" with Takeshita's as
surance that negotiations would be
reopened on providing "in a satis
factory manner" more U.S. con
struction industry access to
Japanese public works. Japanese
barriers to U.S. companies' partic
ipation have aggravated relations
already strained by Japan's trade
surplus with the United States.
However, a senior administration
official said that the Japanese offer
amounted to only a "framework. It
doesn't itself resolve all the prob
lems involved."
On the question of Japan's im
port quotas on 12 agricultural prod
ucts, the official, who declined to
be identified, cited Takeshita's "for
ward attitude" in moving toward

removing them.
In remarks to reporters in the
East Room of the White House,
Reagan said that the session helped
the two leaders establish "an excel
lent personal rapport" although he
mangled the pronunciation of
Takeshita's name (pronounced Ta-
KAY-shta) in his comments.
Ichiro Ozawa, deputy chief
cabinet secretary, told newsmen
that in their talks, the two leaders
generally called each other by their
first names — Ron and Noboru —
in the fashion of the "Ron-Yasu"
relationship between Reagan and
Takeshita's predecessor, Yasuhiro
Nakasone.
A joint statement issued by
Reagan and Takeshita on exchange
rates declared that "a further
decline of the dollar could be coun
terproductive"— wording that
Makoto Utsumi, director of the
Finance Ministry's international
finance bureau, described as un
precedentedly strong for the pres
ident himself.
In the past, the administration
has issued vague signals on its po
sition on the dollar, sensitive to the
consideration that while the decline

unsettles the financial markets, it
makes U.S. goods more affordable
overseas.
Utsumi said financial officials of
the two countries set no specific
exchange rate as a goal but added,
"this (statement) makes it very clear
that anything below the present rate
(for the dollar) is unacceptable."
The dollar closed at a rate of SI
to 127.23 yen on the New York
Foreign Exchange Market yester
day.
The Finance Ministry official said
the two countries had made new
arrangements to guarantee that
both the Bank of Japan and the
Federal Reserve Bank of the
United States would have sufficient
funds to intervene in exchange
markets to support the dollar.

In exchange for the strongly im
plied American commitment to in
tervene forcefully to support the
dollar, Japan offered its own im
plied promise "not to resist any
decline" in (its) short-term interest
rates and to refrain from raising
other interest rates, a senior
Reagan administration official said.
