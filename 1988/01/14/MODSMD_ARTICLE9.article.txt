# Michitarian elected editor
## 
### 
I ension in the crowded
newsroom was almost palpable
last night when, at exactly 10:17
p.m., The Daily's election com
mittee emerged from the paper's
advertising offices and announced
that Bob Michitarian — the burly
Armenian from Zephyr Cove,
Ncv.— would be editor in chief
of The Stanford Daily, Vol. 193.
Turnout for the election was
high. Higher, in fact, than for
Tuesday night's first ballot. Polit
ical analyst Nick Anderson attrib
uted this to the Supreme Court
decision yesterday limiting high
school newspapers' freedom of
speech.
Anderson said this piqued
voters' interest in student
newspapers in general, causing
Daily groupies to come out in
droves to demonstrate their con
stitutionally guaranteed freedom.
One voter, who wished his bal
lot to remain anonymous, called
in his vote from Germany, where
he was drinking beer and eating
spatzen.

Michitarian, coming off a tiring
yet successful stint as news editor,
ran on a platform — four days
late — of no deadlines, libelous
copy and free silver. But he said
before the election that he was
amenable to suggestions about
running The Daily.
"Hey, if I win this election, my

office door will be off its hinges,"
he gushed.
The editor-elect will replace
outgoing chief Andrew "There's
no place like home" Patzman,
who said he looks forward to
spending more time on his Kansas
farm when his duties at The Daily
are finished.
