# Kennedy home is unsafe
## Clay tiles make Hoover House an earthquake risk 
### Jim Mokhiber Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy will soon
join 294 displaced Roble Hall residents in the search
for a new home.
The historic Lou Henry Hoover House, tradi
tionally the residence of the University president,
will be closed temporarily while it undergoes renova
tions to improve its structural stability.
"I'm a refugee now, too," Kennedy told a group
of Casa Zapata students last night.
Because the walls of the house have been found
to contain hollow clay tile — the same weak building
material discovered in Roble's walls — University
officials last week asked Kennedy to evacuate the
building.

According to Associate Provost John Hughes, the
University has known about the presence of the
tiles but did not appreciate their significance until
Roblc was closed Dec. 18. "We had the evidence
but didn't know how to interpret it," Hughes said.
This is not the first time concern has been voiced
about construction materials used in the 68-year-old
house. In a memoir kept by original architect Birge
Clark and discovered by officials in the University
Archives, Clark wrote that the tiles "still make me
unhappy, as in a major earthquake they would
surely pop out."
According to Clark, the Hoovers nevertheless
preferred this design because it would make later
alterations easier and would be fireproof.
