# Kennedy home is unsafe
## Clay tiles make Hoover House an earthquake risk 
### Jim Mokhiber Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy will soon
join 294 displaced Roble Hall residents in the search
for a new home.
The historic Lou Henry Hoover House, tradi
tionally the residence of the University president,
will be closed temporarily while it undergoes renova
tions to improve its structural stability.
"I'm a refugee now, too," Kennedy told a group
of Casa Zapata students last night.
Because the walls of the house have been found
to contain hollow clay tile — the same weak building
material discovered in Roble's walls — University
officials last week asked Kennedy to evacuate the
building.

According to Associate Provost John Hughes, the
University has known about the presence of the
tiles but did not appreciate their significance until
Roblc was closed Dec. 18. "We had the evidence
but didn't know how to interpret it," Hughes said.
This is not the first time concern has been voiced
about construction materials used in the 68-year-old
house. In a memoir kept by original architect Birge
Clark and discovered by officials in the University
Archives, Clark wrote that the tiles "still make me
unhappy, as in a major earthquake they would
surely pop out."
According to Clark, the Hoovers nevertheless
preferred this design because it would make later
alterations easier and would be fireproof.

Lou Henry Hoover House will undergo repairs to bring the 68-year-old structure up to current earthquake
safety standards, temporarily displacing its resident, University President Donald Kennedy.
The 94-year-old Clark said last
night that he informed each new
University president that the struc
ture might be dangerous in the
event of an earthquake. "They are
living with a certain degree of risk,
and I felt they were entitled to
know that," the Palo Alto architect
said.
Kennedy told The Daily that
while he was aware that the tiles
were a problem, neither he nor
other University officials were
aware of the extent of the danger.

He indicated that he and his family
would seek residence elsewhere
within the month.
Attempting to put the danger into
perspective, Office of Facilities
Management Project Manager
Jonathan Ryan said the risk to the
president and his family was "equiv
alent to a drive on the Bayshore
Freeway and getting into a fatal
accident."
Hughes said that of 18 structures
slated to undergo similar inspec
tions, 13 have already been
evaluated; inspection of the remain
ing buildings will be completed by
late Tuesday, he said.
Hughes noted that specific
rebuilding measures and costs of

the Hoover House reconstruction
would not be known until a meeting
Tuesday and that specific plans
would probably not be available un
til the end of January.
Hughes also said that while funds
for renovation of Roble Hall would
come out of room and board fees
and spaced out over time, Hoover
House would be reconstructed with
money from a facilities reserve
fund.
Ryan said the reconstruction of
the president's residence, which is
also a State Historic Landmark, will
be further complicated by regula
tions that require specific permis
sion before the exterior of such
buildings can be altered.
