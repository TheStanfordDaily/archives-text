# Bork resigns from appeals court
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Robert
Bork, still bitter over the failure
last fall of his nomination to the
Supreme Court, resigned yesterday
from the federal appeals court in
Washington, D.C., saying he wants
to be free to "speak out" against
the "campaign of misinformation
and political slogans" that defeated
him.
In a long resignation letter re
flecting the anger that he, his family
and many conservative supporters
still feel over his rejection by the
Senate, Bork, 60, attacked the
"highly vocal groups and individuals
(who) systematically misrepre
sented not only my record and phi
losophy of judging but, more im
portantly, the proper function of
judges in our constitutional
democracy."
President Reagan, in accepting

Bork's resignation, effective Feb. 5,
called the successful opposition
campaign against Bork "a tragedy
for our country."
"All Americans are the poorer
today for not having your extraordi
nary talents and legal skills on the
high court,"he said in a statement.
Even in departure Bork was ex
pected to trigger controversy. Ad
ministration officials and members
of organizations that opposed
Bork's nomination predicted a
major fight over his successor on
the District of Columbia Circuit
Court of Appeals, which is often
called the most powerful of the 13
federal appellate courts. With
Bork's departure, six Reagan ap
pointees will remain on the court,
controlling by a bare 6-5 majority.
Reagan's choice for a successor also
will go before the Senate for con

firmation.
Bork's resignation has been
widely anticipated since the Senate
defeated his Supreme Court bid last
Oct. 23 by a 58-42 vote.
Even before he was nominated
to the high court, Bork had com
plained of boredom with the ap
peals court's routine of often tech
nical cases. When he returned to
duty on the court this fall, he told
friends, the first case he picked up
involved telephone rate regulation.
"He could have died," a friend said.
Nonetheless, the timing of the
move surprised fellow judges, who
thought they had a commitment
from Bork to continue hearing cases
until this summer. Bork told
Reagan about his decision a week
ago, but did not tell his colleagues
until a few hours before the White
House announced the resignation

yesterday afternoon.
Administration officials said they
hope to move quickly on filling his
vacancy. "You and I know how dif
ficult it becomes in the last year
(of a presidency) to push a lot of
court nominees through the
Senate," said a senior administra
tion official.
With Democrats in control of the
Senate, getting a successor con
firmed "is quite an open question
as is," another White House official
said.
A Justice Department official
said that several candidates for the
job are under consideration, includ
ing Charles Fried, the Department
of Justice's solicitor general — the
government's chief advocate before
the Supreme Court.
