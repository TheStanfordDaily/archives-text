## 
### Kimberly Loffer Staff writer 
For those students and faculty
members who are staying on
campus this long weekend, Stanford
is offering a number of activities to
celebrate the Martin Luther King
Jr. holiday.
Highlights of the weekend in
clude a service at Memorial Church
and a one-man show performed by
John O'Ncil that depicts the devel
opment of civil rights in the South
through the eyes of a man living
there.
Jim Cadena, assistent dean of
Residential Education, describes
O'Niel's show as a "skillful and
wonderful way of depicting the
progress of civil rights."
A 4 p.m. tribute to King at
Memorial Church today will be

"less of a service and more of a
program," Cadena said. Readings
from King's essays, the Stanford
Gospel Choir, dancers, singers and
a talk by Assoc. History Prof. Clay
Carson, director of the Martin Lut
her King Jr. Papers Project, will
round out the evening.
A march in honor of King from
Escondido Village Monday will he
led by children, whom King once
called, "those who will lead the
nation."
SUNct, the Stanford television
network, will be featuring programs
related to King and the civil rights
movement all week, such as the
documentary "Eyes on the Prize"
and"The March on Washington
Remembered."
Yolanda King, King's daughter,
will speak tonight at 7 p.m. in
Kresec Auditorium.

Karen Kinney, assistant director
of Residential Education, said the
weekend will be more than a
celebration of King. "It is a celebra
tion for what he stood for and
believed in," she said.
Cadena said he hopes that many
people will turn out for the activities
and support them so that the issue
of racism and what King hoped to
achieve will always be remembered.
King, a Baptist minister, became
famous for leading mass civil rights
movements in the 19605. He en
couraged blacks to fight for their
rights through non-violent methods.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize
for Peace in 1964 and was assas
sinated in 1968. Congress enacted
a bill three years ago establishing
a commemorative holiday honoring
King on the third Monday in Jan
uary.
