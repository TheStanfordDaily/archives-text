# Fieldwork in New Mexico
## Students to study Zuni ways 
### Mary Elizabeth McNitt Staff writer 
Five Stanford students will experience "a non-
Western culture right in the heart of America"
spring quarter as they study in the 600-year-old
American Indian village of the Zuni tribe in New
Mexico.
The five undergraduates, to be named later this
quarter, will study cultural anthropology under An
thropology Prof. Clifford Barnett; selected Zuni
high school students will also participate in the
program. The course will include field trips to other
Indian pueblos, or towns, in the Southwest to make
students aware of cultural differences among various
tribes.
Students will also study independently, pursue
small research projects and do volunteer work.
Volunteer opportunities may include working with
Zuni senior citizens, assisting at the community
radio station and helping staffers at the Zuni med
ical clinic identify and address problems there.
The Zuni program began last spring when An
thropology Prof. John Rick took freshman Jim
Welch and junior Jill Fairbrother to the Zuni pueblo
to study archaeology.
"It's like being in another culture even though
you never leave the United States," Fairbrother
said. "I feel like I learned just as much as I would
at Stanford without the pressures."
Barnett said the Zuni pueblo is the most logical
site for the program because it is the largest village

and has retained most of its culture. Stanford stu
dents will have a chance to see a village where
"religion pervades all aspects of life," he said, adding
that there will be religious dances and ceremonies
several nights a week.
Barnett said he hopes to give Zuni students "an
idea of what academic coursework at a university
is like and to provide Zuni students with academic
role models and peer tutors."
Rick said that last year's program was a success
because it "seemed to benefit the Zuni people."
The Zuni tribe "has not been particularly wel
coming of outsiders," Barnett said.
Stanford began its relationship with the tribe
three years ago when the tribal council approached
Assistant Dean of the Graduate Division Anne
Medicine. Medicine, an American Indian, had gone
to school with the son of the current Zuni governor,
Robert Lewis.
Medicine and Barnett have since sponsored a
faculty seminar that meets once or twice a month
to discuss issues such as Zuni culture, schooling
and modernization.
In the future, Barnett and Rick plan to alternate
spring quarter trips to the pueblo. Barnett added
that he hopes in the long run Stanford students
will be able to live with Zuni families.
The Zuni program is the equivalent of a 15-unit
quarter at Stanford.
The deadline for applications for the program is
Jan. 22.
