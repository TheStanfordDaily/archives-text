### 
Next Monday we celebrate the youngest of our
national holidays, commemorating the birth of Mar
tin Luther King Jr. Its message to Americans,
however, should be as old as the stump speeches
and Philadelphia presses that gave shape to our
nation's founding documents — that all Americans
deserve respect and an equal voice in this country's
legislatures and courtrooms, at its workplaces, on
its buses and in its restaurants.
For nearly two centuries, however, that stirring
promise remained empty for millions of Wack
Americans, and it is far from fulfillment today.
While King inherited the spirit of the Declaration
of Independence and the Constitution, he used
those ideals to challenge the hypocrisy and racism
in American society. He risked his life leading a
nonviolent civil disobedience movement to extend
the opportunity of America to the disadvantaged
and disenfranchised.
Though King may forever be recalled as this
nation's greatest black leader, the vision he brought
to life was for all Americans. Rallying blacks and
other minorities to demand an equal place in society,
he educated an entire population.
This is the third year since the King holiday was
officially initiated, but perhaps more importantly it

is the 20th year since King's assassination in
Memphis. The two decades since his death have
not brought the promised land he envisioned for
Americans of all classes. Thus, as we remember
him, we must recognize how much remains yet to
be done and find within us the courage to continue
the fight for his dream.
Tonight, King's daughter, Yolanda, will speak in
Kresge Auditorium about her father's "Dream
Deferred." Her address begins at 7 p.m. and is
jointly sponsored by the ASSU Speakers Bureau
and the Black Student Union. A provocative series
of events has been planned to commemorate the
King holiday at Stanford, sponsored by groups in
cluding the BSU, Residential Education, SUNet,
the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project,
Memorial Church and the University Committee
on Minority Issues.
King spoke the very language of our nationhood.
While history has given us many men of deeds and
many worthy witnesses, rarely have we had one
whose action matches his vision. In King, the world
of contemplation met, briefly and grandly, the world
of action. The glow from that moment we can still
see.
