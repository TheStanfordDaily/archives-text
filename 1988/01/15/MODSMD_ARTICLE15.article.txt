# Peace plan for Palestine
## 
### 
President Reagan's only foreign policy interest has
been in fighting commies. Other foreign policy goals,
like establishing peace between the Arabs and the
Jews in the Middle East, have been neglected.
Recent Palestinian uprisings in Israel's occupied
territories serve as a reminder that a basis for Arab-
Israeli peace is yet to be secured. Hopefully, our next
president will be prepared to use the leverage of the
United States as a force for peace. To the 1988
presidential hopefuls, I offer the following peace plan.

Israel presently administers its occupied territories
by a system of apartheid where Palestinians are treated
under a separate law. This state of affairs cannot
persist. But neither can Israel grant Israeli citizenship
to Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza.
This year, for the first time, there were more Arabs
born in Israel and the occupied territories than Jews.
Israel faces a choice between making apartheid per
manent, giving up its Jewish majority or making the
West Bank and Gaza independent. Giving up the
Jewish state is out of the question and apartheid must
be also. One day the West Bank and Gaza must
become independent. They should be made indepen
dent now.
It would be reasonable for Israel to insist that these
states be demilitarized. International peacekeeping
forces, backed by Israeli and Palestinian observers,
could keep arms out along the borders and pursue
arms and paramilitary organizations internally. Given
the legitimate Israeli fear of an Arab dictatorship, it
would also be reasonable to require certain immutable
constitutional provisions: free, periodic elections —
again conducted by international forces with Israeli
and Palestinian observers — as well as basic civil and
political liberties. Equal protection of the law would
have to be guaranteed and many other provisions
worked out.
Internationally supervised, demilitarized democra
cies for the West Bank and Gaza could be made to
work. A Nobel Peace Prize is in it for any U.S.
president who wants to make it happen.

In a different part of the world, another opportunity
to establish democracy and do right by a long-suffering
people looks like it will have gone by the boards long
before a new president can take power. Poor unfor
tunate Haiti has no communists. Thus, the Reaganauts
do not even stir as Haiti floats by, face down in the
water.
An election will take place in Haiti this coming
Sunday. There will be no secret ballot. Voters will
mark their votes in front of the same soldiers who
two months ago slaughtered civilians at the polling
places when General Namphy was afraid he might
not get to count the votes himself. The brain-dead
Reagan administration has actually urged the opposi
tion to accept the new election format. I suppose
Reagan is still smarting over Marcos's loss to Aquino
in the Philippines. He seems eager to have the dictators
win this round.

Israel presently administers its
occupied territories by a sys
tem of apartheid where Pales
tinians are treated under a
separate law. This state of
affairs cannot persist.

Reagan has made it clear he does not believe in
democracy abroad any more than at home. Maybe he
associates it with the Democrats. But he has been
willing to use a supposed belief in democracy as a
ploy for fighting communists. He could lend credence
to that policy by squashing this Duvalierist bug in
Haiti. What's stopping him? Is Grenada as big as he
goes? One third of little Hispaniola is too much for
the mighty U.S. of A?
In the mid-19605, the other two thirds of Hispaniola
— the Dominican Republic — also was having trouble
moving to democracy. President Lyndon Johnson sent
in U.S. troops to quell unrest and to conduct an
honest election. The victor was seen into power, and
the democracy has functioned ever since.
