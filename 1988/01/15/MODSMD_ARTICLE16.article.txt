Meaning of
'feminism' is
misunderstood
I am continually amazed and
frustrated at the reluctance of
people to call themselves
"feminists."
Specifically, this letter is in ref
erence to Pilar Keagy's statement
in the Jan. 2 issue of The Daily
that, "Again, I must state that I do
not consider myself a 'feminist,' but
I am a woman." Now, I do not
claim to know anything about
Keagy's beliefs about men and
women, nor am I trying to change
them. Rather, I am using her state
ment as an example of a statement
that I hear continually.
Feminism has become a dirty
word thanks to a great deal of ig
norance and unwillingness on the
part of people to learn about what
feminism actually is. In part, the
negative connotations attached to
the word "feminist" are the result
of very visible and radical groups
who are feminists and whose
theories and methods are not agree
able to many people.
But it is vital to understand that
radical feminists do not define the
word feminist. The Random House
College Dictionary defines
feminism as: 1) The doctrine advo
cating social and political rights for
women equal to those of men; 2)

An organized movement for the at
tainment of such rights for women.
It is basic, the word feminist does
not necessarily mean "hairy-legged
man-hater" or political activist.
Certainly, there are many differ
ent approaches to being a feminist.
However, when people state that
they are feminists they are saying
simply that they believe women are
equal to men and deserve equal
opportunities and rights.
When people say, "Well, I'm cer
tainly not a feminist!" what they
are stating is: 1) They don't know
what feminism means, or 2) they
don't believe women deserve the
same rights and opportunities that
are given to men.
I would be truly disheartened if
all the people who so vehemently
or otherwise claim they aren't
feminists actually believed in the
subordination of women. It saddens
me especially to see women openly
denying that they would advocate
equality for themselves.
Why does the word feminist in
spire such fear in us? I have already
ventured that people associate
feminists/feminism with various
sorts of stereotypical visions of a
militarist, man-hating movement. I
also believe people fear standing
out by claiming a set of beliefs that
not all people think of as being
acceptable. The fact that
feminist/feminism is still a dirty
word indicates just exactly how
much work the feminist movement
has yet to do.

If you think about it, advocating
equality is not such a radical state
ment to make. If even half the
people of the world had the
strength to say, "Yeah, I'm a
feminist," a lot of progress would
be made.
I believe people would find they
don't have to compromise their
identity by putting a name on some
thing they may already believe in
â€” namely, equality for people.
They are only taking pride in them
selves.

Rickety Roble
home to memories
I was delighted to read the two
recent stories about the sudden,
though somewhat belated, evacua
tion of Roble.
I lived in Roble my first two years
at Stanford (1931-33), and I suspect
the belated discovery of its lack of
safety results from a combination
of factors: the University's general
lack of concern with such issues (as
evidenced by the horrendous traffic
situation in the Stanford Shopping
Center) and the lack of enough
old-timers.
Roble in my day was the only
women's dorm. Segregation was
strict, and the only males seen daily
were in the dining rooms as hashers.

No men were permitted above the
lobby. Anastasia Doyle ran Roble,
and Ann Sterling assisted Christine
Ricker in running the dining room.
I don't recall that Roble, only 13
years old when I moved in (I was
16), had nearly as much ivy as in
recent years.
In any event, I was horrified when
at my last two class reunions my
classmates, mostly in their late 60s
or 70s, were put up in decrepit
Roble.
There was in my day a widely
circulated story, though I do not
know whether or not it was apocry
phal, that in winter and from late
summer on, birds always found
water in some of the Roble "tiles"
and thus got through long dry spells.
