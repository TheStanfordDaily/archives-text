## BSU view short-sighted 
### 
I have stood meekly by and watched for the past
four years as "enlightened" intellectual groups on
campus have hypocritically attacked issues and indi
viduals about which they know little or nothing. An
excellent example is South Africa.

On this issue, student groups vociferously denounce
the oppression in the nation and support "liberated"
black African states whose human rights abuses are
as poor as those in South Africa. The protesters, clad
in their battle gear of black boots, pre-torn jeans and
Benetton sweaters, try to put the discussion on South
Africa in black and white terms (no pun intended)
while ignoring the abuses of other dictatorial regimes
in Africa — regimes supported by the United States
as well as the Soviet Union.
Once again, the forces of stupidity are on the march.
And once more the dialogue is tied to race. However,
this time they seek to attack something quite personal.
The attack is underway; but this time the issue is
political representation in Alabama and the "en
lightened" intellectual group is the Black Student Un
ion, which has just completed a fun-filled "working"
vacation in the sunny South.
I am thrilled that the BSU members claim to have
learned from their 240-hour whirlwind (discounting
travel time) trip to the South. Apparently, they un
derstood all the issues at hand (well enough to pass
judgment, it seems) and perhaps even met a few black
political leaders. In many ways, the members of the
BSU are like an ancestor of mine who was part of a
group that decided to build a Utopian society in New
Harmony, Ind. Unfortunately, like the BSU, great
grandfather Owen did not realize that the world is a
complicated place and that things are not always as
simple as they appear.
In Alabama, the issue is not political but economic.
For years, the Wallace and Folsom gubernatorial ad
ministrations promoted an anti-business, pro-labor ap
proach to development in the state. The only problem
with such populist political ploys in a state like Ala
bama is that few businesses are interested in locating
in areas where state governments are noticeably hos
tile. Economically backward states can ill afford to

anger large corporations offering jobs and tax revenues.
Yet, the Wallace administration succeeded in doing
just that. The result? A strong disincentive toward
entrepreneurism in Alabama and toward continued
economic poverty.
Today, the best and brightest in Alabama, both
black and white, are more interested in becoming
doctors, lawyers and bankers than becoming entrepre
neurs. This is the result of years of anti-industrial
sentiment and a society that has stressed employment
in service industries as a symbol of success.
The only "political issue" at hand in Alabama is
the fact that the state has maintained a one-party
government since the end of the Civil War. Black
voters had a decisive impact on the outcome of the
gubernatorial election that put the last Wallace ad
ministration in power (the same Wallace who gave
the "segregation forever" speech).
Also, black voters could have ensured a Democratic
Party victory in the state last year if the party had
not been split by two idiots who disrupted the "old-boy
network" by hurling allegations of adultery, tax fraud
and extortion at each other. As a result, last year's
gubernatorial election brought a Republican to power
in Alabama.
And, oddly enough, only now are the issues of tort
reform, corporate taxation and — most importantly
— education being discussed and remedied. I know
these are boring issues and that Bill King would rather
discuss something simpler like class struggle, white
elitism and the BSU's efforts "to overcome political
forces" in the South, but the BSU would have done
itself a great service by comprehending the complex
economic situation in the state.
Yet if they had only asked, I would have been more
than happy to suggest black leaders in the state who
might have been quite excited to meet a legitimate
group of certified activists, such as the BSU. Unfor
tunately, practically all of the black leadership in the
state supported George Wallace in his last bid for the
governorship.
Yes, things aren't always as simple as they seem.
Only when pragmatic economic policies are applied
in Alabama, as they currently are after years of eco
nomic mismanagement, will there be prosperity for
rural blacks and whites in the South.
