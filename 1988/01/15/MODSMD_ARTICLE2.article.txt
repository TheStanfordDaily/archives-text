# Stanford safety officer authored allegations
## Operations manager was 'told to keep quiet' 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Millington said.
According to the San Jose Mercury News, Mol
destad resigned from the University last month; but
Moldestad told The Daily last night he is "techni
cally on vacation." Decleve said the University has
begun advertising for a new operations manager to
fill Moldestad's position.
Moldestad reportedly has 250 slides compiled
over his six years of employment depicting unsafe
conditions at Stanford. According to the Mercury
News, he expressed willingness to show the slides

The University employee whose letter to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy last month touched
off an extensive investigation of misconduct in the
University's Department of Health and Safety was
identified yesterday as Jon Moldestad, an operations
manager in the department.
The Dec. 10 letter, which charged safety mis
management and specific instances of employee
intimidation in the department, prompted the Uni
versity to quietly launch an in-deptn health and
safety probe last month, University officials revealed
at a press conference Wednesday.
Officials at the press conference would not iden
tify the letter's author, saying he had requested
that his name be kept secret. But Moldestad said
yesterday that that was not the case. He said he'd
been "told by the University to keep quiet" and
declined to comment.
University Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Freelen said Stanford will not confirm
whether it was Moldestad who made the charges.
"The University must respect the person's request
for anonymity,' Freelen said.
William Massy, vice president for Business and
Finance, said, "Tlie employee is free to make any
comments he would like."
The University has so far released only sketchy
details of the allegations. Kennedy said the "letter
does not contain many specific allegations. We want
to get a fix on how serious any hazard is before
we release details."
At Wednesday's press conference, Director of
Internal Audit Peter Millington, who heads the
probe, said the allegations were made by a person
still in the University's employ. "The information
I have is that the person is still an employee,"
to the University Board of Trus
tees as documentation of his al
legations, but University officials
declined the offer.
The buildings being investi
gated by Millington include the
Environmental Safety Facility, the
Center for Integrated Systems,
Keck, the Center for Molecular
and Genetic Medicine, the Stone
Building, deGuerre Pool Stadium,
McCullough, Stauffer, Herrin and
Mitchell.

Specific concerns have been
raised regarding safety in both
McCullough and the Environmen
tal Safety Facility, including prob
lems with Room 109 bin McCul
lough. Apparently, a chemical
spill of arsenic compounds oc
curred in the room, which has
subsequently been closed "purely
as a precautionary measure," said
Rob DeMattei, safety coordinator
for the building.
DeMattei said that no stipula
tions for acceptable levels of the
compounds on a surface exist. The
spill will be cleaned up either by
tne occupants of the lab or a pro
fessional service, he added.

The area of concern in the En
vironmental Safety Facility is a $7
million incinerator that is used to
burn non-chemical hospital waste.
The incinerator's scrubber —
which acts like a filter to keep
pollutants from being released
into the air — has not been op
erating since an accident in mid-
December, but the burning of
waste has continued.
According to Decleve, the
scrubber is merely an additional
measure to reduce the release of
pollutants below acceptable
levels. The incinerator is "in
cinerating at non-hazardous
levels," he said.
