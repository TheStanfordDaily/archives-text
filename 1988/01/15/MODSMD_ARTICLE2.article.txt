# Stanford safety officer authored allegations
## Operations manager was 'told to keep quiet' 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Millington said.
According to the San Jose Mercury News, Mol
destad resigned from the University last month; but
Moldestad told The Daily last night he is "techni
cally on vacation." Decleve said the University has
begun advertising for a new operations manager to
fill Moldestad's position.
Moldestad reportedly has 250 slides compiled
over his six years of employment depicting unsafe
conditions at Stanford. According to the Mercury
News, he expressed willingness to show the slides

The University employee whose letter to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy last month touched
off an extensive investigation of misconduct in the
University's Department of Health and Safety was
identified yesterday as Jon Moldestad, an operations
manager in the department.
The Dec. 10 letter, which charged safety mis
management and specific instances of employee
intimidation in the department, prompted the Uni
versity to quietly launch an in-deptn health and
safety probe last month, University officials revealed
at a press conference Wednesday.
Officials at the press conference would not iden
tify the letter's author, saying he had requested
that his name be kept secret. But Moldestad said
yesterday that that was not the case. He said he'd
been "told by the University to keep quiet" and
declined to comment.
University Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Freelen said Stanford will not confirm
whether it was Moldestad who made the charges.
"The University must respect the person's request
for anonymity,' Freelen said.
William Massy, vice president for Business and
Finance, said, "Tlie employee is free to make any
comments he would like."
The University has so far released only sketchy
details of the allegations. Kennedy said the "letter
does not contain many specific allegations. We want
to get a fix on how serious any hazard is before
we release details."
At Wednesday's press conference, Director of
Internal Audit Peter Millington, who heads the
probe, said the allegations were made by a person
still in the University's employ. "The information
I have is that the person is still an employee,"
