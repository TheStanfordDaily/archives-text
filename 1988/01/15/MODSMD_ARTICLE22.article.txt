## Ehrlich wins World Wildlife Fund medal Prof, battles for controls on world population 
### David Dirks 
"We are heading merrily down
the drain," according to Stanford
Prof. Paul Ehrlich, founder of an
organization called Zero Popula
tion Growth. "The earth can't sup
port five billion people."
"Either you are in favor of low
ering the birth rate, or you are in
favor of raising the death rate,"
said Ehrlich, who has been on a
crusade to lower the birth rate for
most of his professional life.
A professor of population studies,
Ehrlich was recently awarded the
1987 World Wildlife Fund's gold
medal "in recognition of his
achievements as a global spokesman
on population, extinction and other
environmental issues, and his con
tribution to the development of the
science of conservation biology."
"I am especially pleased with the
award because it shows that the
World Wildlife Fund recognized
that part of conservation is dealing
with other world problems," he
said. Ehrlich explained that ecologi
cal problems are interconnected
and that he is glad the World
Wildlife Fund realizes that "the
saving of cute, furry animals" is de
pendent on the reduction of the
world's human population.
The gold medal, the World
Wildlife Fund's highest honor, has
been awarded for nearly 20 years

to people who have made "an out
standing contribution to interna
tional conservation," according to
Elizabeth Kemf, a spokeswoman for
the fund.
"Nobody has come up with a
good reason for having more than
145 million people in America....
We will soon be 150 million over
that, and we still have much too
high a growth rate," Ehrlich said.

In a male-dominated culture such as
India or China, it is difficult to reduce
population growth because families often
will produce as many children as is
necessary in order to have a son. ... A
son has traditionally been seen as neces
sary to take care of his parents in their
old age.

The effects of overpopulation are
evident in various problems that
plague modern societies, he said.
Excessive garbage, water shortages,
poor air quality and economies that
can't support their national popula
tions are all tied to overpopulation.
The first step on Ehrlich's agenda

to tackle these problems is to "elect
a president who has got some
brains. .. . The government is push
ing in the wrong direction. Reagan
is possibly the worst president we've
ever had, and I'm saying that as a
Republican," he said.
According to Ehrlich, the gov
ernment should make abortion
available to those who want it. Con
traceptives, as well, should be made

widely available, and the govern
ment should promote the idea that
"a patriotic individual will not have
more than two children."
"The key is improving rights for
women," he said.
Ehrlich's wife, Dr. Anne Ehrlich,
who has co-authored many of his

books, shares many of her hus
band's views.
"It is a matter for the woman
herself to decide (whether or not
to have a child). Society should not
make that decision for her," she
said.
In a male-dominated culture such
as India or China, it is difficult to
reduce population growth because
families often will produce as many
children as is necessary in order to
have a son. According to Anne
Ehrlich, a son has traditionally been
seen as necessary to take care of
his parents in their old age.
As women gain more equality,
she said, having a son will no longer
be necessary. "But tradition
changes slowly," she added.
"The Chinese have done a
miraculous job, and they've done it
with a minimum of disruption,"
Paul Ehrlich said. He cited the fact
that reports of abuse and problems
in the system were publicized by
the government itself, showing its
willingness to expose and correct
abuses.
"Even though the Chinese still
have great problems, they are far
ahead of the United States," he
said.
Ehrlich founded Zero Population
Growth in 1968 and is still its
honorary president. He said the
group's "main goal is to impress on

people that the United States has
too many people."
In addition to his most recent
book, "Earth," co-authored with his
wife and published last spring,
Ehrlich has written 29 books, in
cluding his most famous, "The Pop
ulation Bomb."
"The population explosion will
come to an end; the question is
whether we decide to do it
humanely or let nature do it
[through] famine, an ecological
breakdown, war or an cpidemic dis
ease like AIDS," he said.
Anne Ehrlich explained that a
disease such as AIDS is more likelv

to spread in an overpopulated area
because people come in closer con
tact with each other and because
they may already be weakened by
malnutrition, making them more
susceptible to disease.
According to Paul Ehrlich, AIDS
is 'possibly the most serious health
threat in America's history." Al
though he admitted that it has not
been determined whether the
epidemic will have an effect on the
growth of the U.S. population, he
said that "in Africa, they are think
ing that it may significantly reduce
the population."
As for the overall effect of AIDS
on the world's population, he said
that the "transmissibility in the het
erosexual population" has yet to be
determined, but that there is a
major fear in the medical commu
nity that "the virus may change and
become more readily transmis
sible."
Contrary to popular belief, he
said, war has not been a great pop
ulation controller. "You can barely
see World War II on a world
demographics map."
A new kind of war, however,
would severely affect the world pop
ulation as the worst possible
method of population control. He
said, "In a thermonuclear war, there
may be some survivers, but nothing
you or I give a damn about will
survive."

to tackle these problems is to "elect
a president who has got some
brains. .. . The government is push
ing in the wrong direction. Reagan
is possibly the worst president we've
ever had, and I'm saying that as a
Republican," he said.
According to Ehrlich, the gov
ernment should make abortion
available to those who want it. Con
traceptives, as well, should be made

widely available, and the govern
ment should promote the idea that
"a patriotic individual will not have
more than two children."
"The key is improving rights for
women," he said.
Ehrlich's wife, Dr. Anne Ehrlich,
who has co-authored many of his

books, shares many of her hus
band's views.
"It is a matter for the woman
herself to decide (whether or not
to have a child). Society should not
make that decision for her," she
said.
In a male-dominated culture such
as India or China, it is difficult to
reduce population growth because
families often will produce as many
children as is necessary in order to
have a son. According to Anne
Ehrlich, a son has traditionally been
seen as necessary to take care of
his parents in their old age.
As women gain more equality,
she said, having a son will no longer
be necessary. "But tradition
changes slowly," she added.
"The Chinese have done a
miraculous job, and they've done it
with a minimum of disruption,"
Paul Ehrlich said. He cited the fact
that reports of abuse and problems
in the system were publicized by
the government itself, showing its
willingness to expose and correct
abuses.
"Even though the Chinese still
have great problems, they are far
ahead of the United States," he
said.
Ehrlich founded Zero Population
Growth in 1968 and is still its
honorary president. He said the
group's "main goal is to impress on

people that the United States has
too many people."
In addition to his most recent
book, "Earth," co-authored with his
wife and published last spring,
Ehrlich has written 29 books, in
cluding his most famous, "The Pop
ulation Bomb."
"The population explosion will
come to an end; the question is
whether we decide to do it
humanely or let nature do it
[through] famine, an ecological
breakdown, war or an cpidemic dis
ease like AIDS," he said.
Anne Ehrlich explained that a
disease such as AIDS is more likelv

to spread in an overpopulated area
because people come in closer con
tact with each other and because
they may already be weakened by
malnutrition, making them more
susceptible to disease.
According to Paul Ehrlich, AIDS
is 'possibly the most serious health
threat in America's history." Al
though he admitted that it has not
been determined whether the
epidemic will have an effect on the
growth of the U.S. population, he
said that "in Africa, they are think
ing that it may significantly reduce
the population."
As for the overall effect of AIDS
on the world's population, he said
that the "transmissibility in the het
erosexual population" has yet to be
determined, but that there is a
major fear in the medical commu
nity that "the virus may change and
become more readily transmis
sible."
Contrary to popular belief, he
said, war has not been a great pop
ulation controller. "You can barely
see World War II on a world
demographics map."
A new kind of war, however,
would severely affect the world pop
ulation as the worst possible
method of population control. He
said, "In a thermonuclear war, there
may be some survivers, but nothing
you or I give a damn about will
survive."


Paul Ehrlich
"We are heading merrily down
the drain," according to Stanford
Prof. Paul Ehrlich, founder of an
organization called Zero Popula
tion Growth. "The earth can't sup
port five billion people."
"Either you are in favor of low
ering the birth rate, or you are in
favor of raising the death rate,"
said Ehrlich, who has been on a
crusade to lower the birth rate for
most of his professional life.
A professor of population studies,
Ehrlich was recently awarded the
1987 World Wildlife Fund's gold
medal "in recognition of his
achievements as a global spokesman
on population, extinction and other
environmental issues, and his con
tribution to the development of the
science of conservation biology."
"I am especially pleased with the
award because it shows that the
World Wildlife Fund recognized
that part of conservation is dealing
with other world problems," he
said. Ehrlich explained that ecologi
cal problems are interconnected
and that he is glad the World
Wildlife Fund realizes that "the
saving of cute, furry animals" is de
pendent on the reduction of the
world's human population.
The gold medal, the World
Wildlife Fund's highest honor, has
been awarded for nearly 20 years

to people who have made "an out
standing contribution to interna
tional conservation," according to
Elizabeth Kemf, a spokeswoman for
the fund.
"Nobody has come up with a
good reason for having more than
145 million people in America....
We will soon be 150 million over
that, and we still have much too
high a growth rate," Ehrlich said.

In a male-dominated culture such as
India or China, it is difficult to reduce
population growth because families often
will produce as many children as is
necessary in order to have a son. ... A
son has traditionally been seen as neces
sary to take care of his parents in their
old age.

The effects of overpopulation are
evident in various problems that
plague modern societies, he said.
Excessive garbage, water shortages,
poor air quality and economies that
can't support their national popula
tions are all tied to overpopulation.
The first step on Ehrlich's agenda

to tackle these problems is to "elect
a president who has got some
