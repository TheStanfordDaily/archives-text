## Nitery's 'Teeth' is an inventive, biting satire 
### Debbie Frockt 
You might, at first, think that a
play about the virtues of marriage
written a generation ago would be
outdated, passe and tiresome.
You might think that, but you'd
be wrong.
Claudia Orenstein's production
of Thornton Wilder's "The Skin of
Our Teeth" is a wonderfully color
ful adaptation of a play whose
relevance is far from gone. Instead,
her entertaining and marvelously
stylized direction raises some inter
esting issues about how far we really
are from Wilder's Antrobus family
in 1988, and if we may possibly
have come too far from some basic
values for our own good.
The Antrobus story is about the
trials and tribulations of humanity
as seen through one family's expe
riences over time. There is, of
course, mother, father, daughter
and son, but the hitch in the whole
thing is Sabina (Marcie Gilbert),
the family maid, angel, demon,
voice of reason, disrupter, connec
tor and comedienne.
We sec ourselves in the charac
ters, traveling the rocky road from
one potentially annihilating circum
stance to the next — whether it be
an ice age. a flood, a war or a

marital break-up. In short, Wilder
is giving us a world history in two
hours that encompasses everything
from the vast grandeur of an entire
species right down to the discreet
details of ordinary everyday lives.
If this sounds like a tall order to
fill in a short two hours on stage,
now imagine a script that tells not
just one, but many stories. Imagine
the whole plot couched as a 1950s
television pilot about a family called
Antrobus that is being taped in
front of a live studio audience.
And if that's not enough for you,
imagine that characters in this sit
com might often break out of their
roles at crucial moments in the
"story" to espouse their views on
the atomic bomb or to share an
intimate personal portrait that may
or may not have ever happened.
Wilder's self-conscious explora
tion of the concept of theater, his
abundant use of direct engagement
with the audience and his generally
modernist stance may seem conven
tional now, but it must be remem
bered that he was making truly in
novative contributions to American
theater at the time he was writing.
Orenstein's production highlights
this feature and manages to retain
its freshness.
Orenstein makes full use of the

television show format by having
her characters speak as much to
the camera as to the audience or
to each other. Not only is it a won
derful spoof, but it also draws our
attention to the artificiality of the
medium we are in.
A subtle sense of timing is per
haps the key to the show's success.
Orenstein moves her actors sensi
tively but rapidly from moment to
moment. There are ony a few in
stances where the sense of farce is
abandoned and the action sinks un
der the weight of its own self
indulgent seriousness.
Gilbert has a gem to work with
in Sabina. She is a sexy and viva
cious schizophrenic presence who
seems to tie the whole thing to
gether even as she flits from high
comedy to melodramatics. Gilbert
is well-cast in the part and often
achieves believably humorous or
tragic moments as the occasion
demands. Her expression through
out the performance, however, was
a bit frozen, stifling some of the
range she might have discovered in
a more relaxed dramatic format.
John Bartunek as Mr. Antrobus
is a warm "Father Knows Best"
figure who only occasionally slips
into sulking disenchantment with
life. His deep, full voice resounds

niccly in the Antrohus body, and
he is both worldly and naive. A
bright spot in both his performance
and the play as a whole is the
Antrobus acceptance speech a la
Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, like
Gilbert, his expression remains
frozen a bit too much.

Although the lead players and
the supporting cast are all very
good, it is Suzanne Wight's
portrayal of Mrs. Antrobus that is
the show's real delight. She is a
delicious and frightening cross be
tween June Cleaver and a barra
cuda, flashing a permanently fixed

smile as she vehemently threatens
in a soft southern lilt to do every
thing in her power to keep her
family together.
The show plays at the Nitery
tonight, tomorrow night and Jan.
20-23, with all performances begin
ning at 8 p.m.

seems to tie the whole thing to
gether even as she flits from high
comedy to melodramatics. Gilbert
is well-cast in the part and often
achieves believably humorous or
tragic moments as the occasion
demands. Her expression through
out the performance, however, was
a bit frozen, stifling some of the
range she might have discovered in
a more relaxed dramatic format.
John Bartunek as Mr. Antrobus
is a warm "Father Knows Best"
figure who only occasionally slips
into sulking disenchantment with
life. His deep, full voice resounds

niccly in the Antrohus body, and
he is both worldly and naive. A
bright spot in both his performance
and the play as a whole is the
Antrobus acceptance speech a la
Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, like
Gilbert, his expression remains
frozen a bit too much.

Although the lead players and
the supporting cast are all very
good, it is Suzanne Wight's
portrayal of Mrs. Antrobus that is
the show's real delight. She is a
delicious and frightening cross be
tween June Cleaver and a barra
cuda, flashing a permanently fixed

smile as she vehemently threatens
in a soft southern lilt to do every
thing in her power to keep her
family together.
The show plays at the Nitery
tonight, tomorrow night and Jan.
20-23, with all performances begin
ning at 8 p.m.

Marcie Gilbert as Sabine, John Bartunek as Mr. Antrobus and Nancy Stone as Moses star in the Drama
Department's new production of Thornton Wilder's "Skin of Our Teeth," now performing at the Nitery.
You might, at first, think that a
play about the virtues of marriage
written a generation ago would be
outdated, passe and tiresome.
You might think that, but you'd
be wrong.
Claudia Orenstein's production
of Thornton Wilder's "The Skin of
Our Teeth" is a wonderfully color
ful adaptation of a play whose
relevance is far from gone. Instead,
her entertaining and marvelously
stylized direction raises some inter
esting issues about how far we really
are from Wilder's Antrobus family
in 1988, and if we may possibly
have come too far from some basic
values for our own good.
The Antrobus story is about the
trials and tribulations of humanity
as seen through one family's expe
riences over time. There is, of
course, mother, father, daughter
and son, but the hitch in the whole
thing is Sabina (Marcie Gilbert),
the family maid, angel, demon,
voice of reason, disrupter, connec
tor and comedienne.
We sec ourselves in the charac
ters, traveling the rocky road from
one potentially annihilating circum
stance to the next — whether it be
an ice age. a flood, a war or a

marital break-up. In short, Wilder
is giving us a world history in two
hours that encompasses everything
from the vast grandeur of an entire
species right down to the discreet
details of ordinary everyday lives.
If this sounds like a tall order to
fill in a short two hours on stage,
now imagine a script that tells not
just one, but many stories. Imagine
the whole plot couched as a 1950s
television pilot about a family called
Antrobus that is being taped in
front of a live studio audience.
And if that's not enough for you,
imagine that characters in this sit
com might often break out of their
roles at crucial moments in the
"story" to espouse their views on
the atomic bomb or to share an
intimate personal portrait that may
or may not have ever happened.
Wilder's self-conscious explora
tion of the concept of theater, his
abundant use of direct engagement
with the audience and his generally
modernist stance may seem conven
tional now, but it must be remem
bered that he was making truly in
novative contributions to American
theater at the time he was writing.
Orenstein's production highlights
this feature and manages to retain
its freshness.
Orenstein makes full use of the

television show format by having
her characters speak as much to
the camera as to the audience or
to each other. Not only is it a won
derful spoof, but it also draws our
attention to the artificiality of the
medium we are in.
A subtle sense of timing is per
haps the key to the show's success.
Orenstein moves her actors sensi
tively but rapidly from moment to
moment. There are ony a few in
stances where the sense of farce is
abandoned and the action sinks un
der the weight of its own self
indulgent seriousness.
Gilbert has a gem to work with
in Sabina. She is a sexy and viva
cious schizophrenic presence who
seems to tie the whole thing to
gether even as she flits from high
comedy to melodramatics. Gilbert
is well-cast in the part and often
achieves believably humorous or
tragic moments as the occasion
demands. Her expression through
