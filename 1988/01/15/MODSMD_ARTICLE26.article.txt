## Stanford cagers roll over the Huskies 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
To say that the most exciting mo
ment in Stanford's 86-70 victory
over Washington last night was
when Cardinal center Greg Butler
hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to beat
the betting spread of 14 points
would be an exaggeration.
It was apparent by the end of
the first half, however, that Stanford
was about a dozen points better
than the Huskies, and the Cardinal
methodically made that appearance
hold up until Butler sank the rain
bow to make the winning margin 16.
Stanford's Todd Lichti had an
unobtrusive 25 points, and forward
Howard Wright added a resounding
21 to help the Cardinal end a two
game losing streak and raise the
team's record to 11-5 overall, 3-2
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Washington, meanwhile, fell to
4-9, 0-4 in the Pac-10. Stanford con
tinues its homestand tomorrow
night when it hosts the Washington
State Cougars at 7:35 p.m. The
Cougars defeated California last
night 59-37.
A lack of depth on the Husky
side forced Washington to play zone
defense for most of the contest in
order to conserve energy, and Stan
ford responded with a stellar 63-
percent shooting percentage from
the field, including an amazing 83
percent in the second half.
"I knew they shot a good per
centage in the second half," Wash
ington Head Coach Andy Russo
said. "But 83 percent? I thought
our defense was good, but they
made some good shots."
And Stanford made those shots
from just about everywhere on the
court. Wright made most of his in
the paint, including a pair of two
handed slams. Cardinal guard Terry
Taylor garnered most of his 15
points (including four 3-point goals)
from locales in the vicinity of
Topeka. And Lichti quietly chalked
up his 25 points from vista points
in between.
The scoring spree by the Cardinal
trio answered any questions about

the ability of Stanford to win. Coach
Mike Montgomery's squad had lost
three out its last four ball games.
"Any time you lose a couple of
ball games some questions will
come up," Montgomery said. "It
helps to get this win in."
Lichti began the festivities by
sinking a 3-pointer, and his shot
set the theme for the evening —
"treys" were sent aloft repeatedly
as Washington attempted 18 3-
pointers on the night (out of 53
shots), and Stanford tried 17 (out
of 49).
The two teams stayed even in
the first 16 minutes of play, and
Stanford led 29-27 with 4:14 left
before halftime. At this point,
however, the Cardinal solved the
Husky zone defense and went on
a 12-4 run.
Sharp passes by Stanford reserves
Derek Bruton and Scott Meinert
led to inside buckets by Bryan
McSweeney and Bruton, respective
ly. Ten of the 12 points in the
Stanford spurt resulted from inside
shots, and the Huskies' hope of
shutting down the inside game
vanished as Stanford led 41-31 at
the half.
"They played two different zones
(a 2-3 and a match-up zone), and
we were able to hit outside on one
and inside on the other,"
Montgomery said.
Lichti and Taylor supplied the
outside bombardment, combining
for a 9-for-13 performance from 3-
point range. Lichti took advantage
of the fact that a 19-foot, 9-inch
shot is worth three points, while
Taylor disregarded the lower limit
and boldly shot from places where
few men have shot before.
Taylor had this explanation of
one shot he sank from, oh, about
25 feet or so: "I faked the shot,
and the guy didn't move, so I faked
it again, and he didn't come up on
me, so I figured, what the hell."
Two 3-pointers by Taylor and
Lichti, and two fast break layups
by Lichti and Wright propelled
Stanford to a 55-38 lead five
minutes into the second half, but

Washington hung in and narrowed
the lead to 69-62 with 5:50 left in
the game.
"We had a shaky period with
some errant passes," Montgomery
said of the Husky comeback. "What
they did was smart — they tried to
buy some time with the zone and
then at some point jump on us with
a very aggressive man (man-to-man
defense)."

Montgomery called a timeout at
that point, and his players
responded well. McSweeney hit a
jumper, Lichti sank two free throws
and Taylor tallied a "trey" to give
Stanford a 76-64 lead with 2:40 left
in the game.
Washington substituted only once
in the first 16 minutes of the second
half, so the squad was tired and
outmatched.

unobtrusive 25 points, and forward
Howard Wright added a resounding
21 to help the Cardinal end a two
game losing streak and raise the
team's record to 11-5 overall, 3-2
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Washington, meanwhile, fell to
4-9, 0-4 in the Pac-10. Stanford con
tinues its homestand tomorrow
night when it hosts the Washington
State Cougars at 7:35 p.m. The
Cougars defeated California last
night 59-37.
A lack of depth on the Husky
side forced Washington to play zone
defense for most of the contest in
order to conserve energy, and Stan
ford responded with a stellar 63-
percent shooting percentage from
the field, including an amazing 83
percent in the second half.
"I knew they shot a good per
centage in the second half," Wash
ington Head Coach Andy Russo
said. "But 83 percent? I thought
our defense was good, but they
made some good shots."
And Stanford made those shots
from just about everywhere on the
court. Wright made most of his in
the paint, including a pair of two
handed slams. Cardinal guard Terry
Taylor garnered most of his 15
points (including four 3-point goals)
from locales in the vicinity of
Topeka. And Lichti quietly chalked
up his 25 points from vista points
in between.
The scoring spree by the Cardinal
trio answered any questions about

the ability of Stanford to win. Coach
Mike Montgomery's squad had lost
three out its last four ball games.
"Any time you lose a couple of
ball games some questions will
come up," Montgomery said. "It
helps to get this win in."
Lichti began the festivities by
sinking a 3-pointer, and his shot
set the theme for the evening —
"treys" were sent aloft repeatedly
as Washington attempted 18 3-
pointers on the night (out of 53
shots), and Stanford tried 17 (out
of 49).
The two teams stayed even in
the first 16 minutes of play, and
Stanford led 29-27 with 4:14 left
before halftime. At this point,
however, the Cardinal solved the
Husky zone defense and went on
a 12-4 run.
Sharp passes by Stanford reserves
Derek Bruton and Scott Meinert
led to inside buckets by Bryan
McSweeney and Bruton, respective
ly. Ten of the 12 points in the
Stanford spurt resulted from inside
shots, and the Huskies' hope of
shutting down the inside game
vanished as Stanford led 41-31 at
the half.
"They played two different zones
(a 2-3 and a match-up zone), and
we were able to hit outside on one
and inside on the other,"
Montgomery said.
Lichti and Taylor supplied the
outside bombardment, combining
for a 9-for-13 performance from 3-
point range. Lichti took advantage
of the fact that a 19-foot, 9-inch
shot is worth three points, while
Taylor disregarded the lower limit
and boldly shot from places where
few men have shot before.
Taylor had this explanation of
one shot he sank from, oh, about
25 feet or so: "I faked the shot,
and the guy didn't move, so I faked
it again, and he didn't come up on
me, so I figured, what the hell."
Two 3-pointers by Taylor and
Lichti, and two fast break layups
by Lichti and Wright propelled
Stanford to a 55-38 lead five
minutes into the second half, but

Washington hung in and narrowed
the lead to 69-62 with 5:50 left in
the game.
"We had a shaky period with
some errant passes," Montgomery
said of the Husky comeback. "What
they did was smart — they tried to
buy some time with the zone and
then at some point jump on us with
a very aggressive man (man-to-man
defense)."

Montgomery called a timeout at
that point, and his players
responded well. McSweeney hit a
jumper, Lichti sank two free throws
and Taylor tallied a "trey" to give
Stanford a 76-64 lead with 2:40 left
in the game.
Washington substituted only once
in the first 16 minutes of the second
half, so the squad was tired and
outmatched.

Stanford's Howard Wright slams home two of his 21 points in last night's
manhandling of Washington in Maples Pavilion.
To say that the most exciting mo
ment in Stanford's 86-70 victory
over Washington last night was
when Cardinal center Greg Butler
hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to beat
the betting spread of 14 points
would be an exaggeration.
It was apparent by the end of
the first half, however, that Stanford
was about a dozen points better
than the Huskies, and the Cardinal
methodically made that appearance
hold up until Butler sank the rain
bow to make the winning margin 16.
Stanford's Todd Lichti had an
unobtrusive 25 points, and forward
Howard Wright added a resounding
21 to help the Cardinal end a two
game losing streak and raise the
team's record to 11-5 overall, 3-2
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
