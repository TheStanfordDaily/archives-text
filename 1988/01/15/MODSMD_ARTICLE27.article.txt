# Wright rocks the house

Howard Wright likes to play
against Pacific 10 Conference op
ponents at home.... In fact, you
could even call him dominating.
In league games at Maples
Pavilion, the junior forward is
scoring at a clip of 25 points per
contest — 11 points more per game
than his season average. He led the
team in scoring against USC with
24, tallied a career-high 30 against
defending Pac-10 champion UCLA
and also pulled down a game-high
11 rebounds vs. the Bruins.
In last night's 86-70 win over
Washington, Wright finished
second in scoring with 21 points.
That's more than he scored against
the Huskies in two games last
season.
"We certainly made an All-
American out of him tonight,"
Washington Coach Andy Russo
said. "He has not played well
against us before, but he got his
confidence early and hit some shots.
He did a nice job."
Russo can blame himself in part
for Wright's sudden emergence as
one of the Pac-10's premier players.
Russo, who has developed big men
such as Chris Welp and Phil Zeven
bergen, coached Wright during
tryouts for the Pan-American
Games last year, and it was a ben
eficial experience for the 6-foot-8
Stanford starter.
"Coach Russo worked with me a
lot and gave me a lot of individual
support and criticism," Wright said.
"I took his advice — and spent a
lot of hours in the weight room —
and worked hard to improve. I es
pecially wanted to play well against
Washington tonight because of the
help he's given me."
The help seems to have paid off
for Wright, who is scoring 13.7
points per game and pulling down

8.3 boards per contest. Coming into
this season, the San Diego native
was averaging 10.4 points and 6.5
rebounds per game in his Stanford
career.
Wright's improvement has added
tremendously to the Stanford of
fense. "He's trying really hard to
become one of the more dominating
players in the league," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said. "He
knows he's under some pressure.
For us to be successful, Howard
has to produce. He can't afford to
be tentative; he has to go out and
take advantage of his ability."
According to opponents, Wright
is certainly making the most of his
talent. "He's always been a great
athlete," said Washington forward
Mike Hayward, who was often as
signed the difficult task of stopping
Wright. "I had a tough time chasing
him around. He's one of the
stronger players in the league. In
two years he'll definitely be a top
round draft pick in the NBA be
cause he's such a great athlete, es
pecially the way he runs the floor."
Wright thrilled last night's crowd
with two awe-inspiring dunks
worthy of the professional ranks,
and Montgomery said he wouldn't
be surprised if his protege winds
up in the NBA. "If Howard con
tinues to improve and continues to
work hard, given his athletic ability,
his size and his strength, he's the
type of player who has a chance,"
Montgomery said. "I'd really like
to see him there, and he's starting
to see what he has to do to establish
himself."
Meanwhile, Wright is certainly
establishing himself in the Pac-10
and is largely responsible for Stan
ford's 3-0 league mark at home.
"At home we should win all our
games," Wright said. "That's our
goal."
And with Wright playing at the
top of his game, that doesn't seem
too far-fetched.
