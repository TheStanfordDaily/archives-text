# Card remains unbeaten
##

Basketball fans in Pullman got
their share of excitement last night,
as the No. 10 Stanford women's
basketball team had to rally from
a 34-29 halftime deficit to beat
Washington State 59-37. The Car
dinal now boasts a 14-0 record over
all and is 3-0 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference heading into tomorrow's
game at Washington.
Sophomore guard Jennifer Azzi
spearheaded the Stanford offense
for the second week in a row,
scoring 17 points and dishing up
five assists. She was followed by
forwards Katy Steding and Trisha
Stevens, who each garnered 10
points. The Cougars were led by
senior guard Penny Bowden's 13
points and five assists and freshman
forward Angie Weir's 10 rebounds.
As the statistics show, the game
was close until the very end. Wash
ington State was up 54-53 with 42

seconds left, but a jumper by Azzi
with :32 showing on the clock put
the Cardinal up for good.
The Cardinal hopes that tomor
row night will be equally fruitful
when it faces the No. 17 Washing
ton Huskies, the first top-20 team
on Stanford's schedule. Washington
has amassed a 9-2 record overall
and is 1-0 in the Pac-10 after de
feating the Cougars last weekend
81-72.
Led by junior guard Yvette Cole,
who is averaging 12.4 points per
game and is rated 13th in Pac-10
scoring, as well as sophomore for
ward Tracy Thirdgill (10.2 ppg), the
Husky women will undoubtedly
prove to be the Cardinal's toughest
competition.
"They're going to be very, very
good and play very, very well," Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"They're quick, they have a young,
very talented team and they will be
outstanding competition. We're
really excited to play them."

"They have a really good center
in Karen Deden, and a really good
forward in Lisa Oriard. Oriard
really killed us last year."
With the squad that Stanford is
fielding, however, Washington will
hardly be overconfident. Freshman
guard Sonja Henning, the reigning
Pac-10 Player of the Week, is
playing some of her best basketball
of late, averaging 10.1 ppg and
ranking tied for fifth place in con
ference scoring.
Former Pac-10 Players of the
Week Jill Yanke and Azzi are also
in top form. Junior center Yanke
is second in Stanford scoring with
13.2 ppg, while Azzi leads the Car
dinal with 13.9 ppg and the Pac-10
with 7.2 assists per game.
Azzi is also faring well in nation
wide statistics, placing 11th in 3-
point field goals and 14th in assists.
As a team, the Cardinal is rated
eighth in 3-pointers and 14th in
scoring margin.
