# Women's swimming hosts SJSU
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Many centuries ago, before the birth of the
United States, before the Dark Ages, even before
Ronald Reagan began dying his hair, the latest
fad in the world of sports involved lions, Chris
tians and many screaming fans.
Now, sports have become considerably more
civilized, but there is still the occasional giant
mismatch. It will be just like old times when
the Stanford women's swimming team hosts the
San Jose State Spartans (Christians?) at 10:30
a.m. tomorrow at dcGuerrc Pool.
The Cardinal, ranked second in the nation
behind only Texas, is off to a 2-0 start this year
after a decisive 91-40 victory over Arizona last
weekend. And the bad news for the visitors is
that the Wildcat team is very likely stronger
than San Jose State's.
Stanford Coach George Haines isn't expecting
the contest to go down to the wire, but his team
will get some competition. "They (San Jose
State) have some good swimmers," he said.
"We're going to work hard this weekend."
Haines plans to have his swimmers race mostly
in off events tomorrow to give them expcricnce
in other events and let them do something a
little different.
The disadvantage of swimming off events, be
sides making the score look a lot closer than it
should be, is that swimmers have little chance
to qualify for the NCAAs. This is not entirely
bad, however, as the Cardinal has a plethora
of meets scheduled where swimmers can go after
the qualifying times.
A new NCAA rule also makes the situation
better. Now a swimmer needs to qualify in only
one event, then is eligible to swim in three at
the NCAAs. Instead of trying to qualify 17
swimmers (the NCAA maximum) in three events
each (another NCAA-imposed limit), the 17

athletes need only to hit one cut each.
After last weekend, three Cardinal swimmers
have already qualified. Junior Michelle Donahue
hit the cut in the 100-yard backstroke, her class
mate Jcnna Johnson was under the limit in the
100 butterfly and senior Stacy Shupe qualified
in the 1650 freestyle.
Furthermore, junior Susan Lenth and sopho
more Susannah Miller were within two- or three
tenths of a second of qualifying in the 100
brcaststrokc and 200 backstroke, respectively.
"We look real good," Haines said. "It's the
best we've ever started out. We're swimming
real well; we're working hard in practice."

Stanford returns five of the
top 10 finishers in last
year's NCAA 200-meter
backstroke final.

The Cardinal has outstanding depth this
season after returning 14 of 15 point-scorers
from last year's NCAA runner-up squad. (Mi
chelle Griglione, the 15th, stopped out this year
to train for the 1988 Olympic Games.) While
the Cardinal will not have all these swimmers
going in their top events against San Jose State,
most are very well-rounded, as the Spartan com
petitors will soon discover. Stanford's goal for
the season, however, is the NCAA title, and in
this pursuit the Cardinal looks very formidable.
Stanford's biggest strength is in the backstroke
events. Five of the top 10 finishers in last year's
200 backstroke NCAA final are present this
season.

Besides Donahue, third in the 200 and second
in the 100 in 1987, Stanford has Miller, senior
Jennifer Pokluda, junior Jenny Shannon and
sophomore Laura McLean. All continue at the
top of their field, giving even an intrasquad
meet the look of the NCAA championship.
In the sprint freestyle events, the Cardinal
has Johnson, a five-time NCAA champion in
her first two seasons on the Farm, leading the
way. Behind her is senior Aimcc Berzins, the
runner-up to Johnson at the NCAA meet last
year. Furthermore, junior Dana Anderson and
sophomore Lisa Gillespie won All-America
honors in the 200 free.
In the longer freestyle events, Stanford has
eight-time All-Amcrican Shupc to complement
Gillespie and Anderson.
Johnson was an Olympic silver-medalist in
the 100 fly in 1984, while junior Monica
Niclcbcck is a strong competitor in the 200 fly.
Ixnth, two-time Olympian Susan Rapp and
sophomores Jill Johnson and Bethanne Lambert
provide strength in the breaststroke.
The Cardinal is even a power in the individual
medley events with two returning All-Americans,
McLean and Miller.
In the diving events, Stanford perhaps has its
best team ever with senior Leslie Klcinhckscl,
junior Amy Bichl and sophomore Ail-American
Katie Connors performing from both the one
and three-meter boards.
Stanford's lineup will reccivc a stern test next
weekend when the team ventures south to tangle
with UCI,A and USC. "They're good," Haines
said. "We expect to be favored to win the meets,
but they have some really good swimmers."
Things only get more interesting from there
as Stanford hosts Arizona State two weeks from
today. Then comes the big one Texas. The
winners of four consecutive national
titles, visit Stanford on Feb. 6 in what should
be a very exciting dual meet.

Things only get more interesting from there
as Stanford hosts Arizona State two weeks from
today. Then comes the big one Texas. The
winners of four consecutive national
titles, visit Stanford on Feb. 6 in what should
be a very exciting dual meet.

Susan Rapp is one of the best all-around swimmers on the talent-laden
Cardinal women's team.
Many centuries ago, before the birth of the
United States, before the Dark Ages, even before
Ronald Reagan began dying his hair, the latest
fad in the world of sports involved lions, Chris
tians and many screaming fans.
Now, sports have become considerably more
civilized, but there is still the occasional giant
mismatch. It will be just like old times when
the Stanford women's swimming team hosts the
San Jose State Spartans (Christians?) at 10:30
a.m. tomorrow at dcGuerrc Pool.
The Cardinal, ranked second in the nation
behind only Texas, is off to a 2-0 start this year
after a decisive 91-40 victory over Arizona last
weekend. And the bad news for the visitors is
that the Wildcat team is very likely stronger
than San Jose State's.
Stanford Coach George Haines isn't expecting
the contest to go down to the wire, but his team
will get some competition. "They (San Jose
State) have some good swimmers," he said.
"We're going to work hard this weekend."
Haines plans to have his swimmers race mostly
in off events tomorrow to give them expcricnce
in other events and let them do something a
little different.
The disadvantage of swimming off events, be
sides making the score look a lot closer than it
should be, is that swimmers have little chance
to qualify for the NCAAs. This is not entirely
bad, however, as the Cardinal has a plethora
of meets scheduled where swimmers can go after
the qualifying times.
A new NCAA rule also makes the situation
better. Now a swimmer needs to qualify in only
one event, then is eligible to swim in three at
the NCAAs. Instead of trying to qualify 17
swimmers (the NCAA maximum) in three events
each (another NCAA-imposed limit), the 17

athletes need only to hit one cut each.
After last weekend, three Cardinal swimmers
have already qualified. Junior Michelle Donahue
hit the cut in the 100-yard backstroke, her class
mate Jcnna Johnson was under the limit in the
100 butterfly and senior Stacy Shupe qualified
in the 1650 freestyle.
Furthermore, junior Susan Lenth and sopho
more Susannah Miller were within two- or three
tenths of a second of qualifying in the 100
brcaststrokc and 200 backstroke, respectively.
"We look real good," Haines said. "It's the
best we've ever started out. We're swimming
real well; we're working hard in practice."

Stanford returns five of the
top 10 finishers in last
year's NCAA 200-meter
backstroke final.

The Cardinal has outstanding depth this
season after returning 14 of 15 point-scorers
from last year's NCAA runner-up squad. (Mi
chelle Griglione, the 15th, stopped out this year
to train for the 1988 Olympic Games.) While
the Cardinal will not have all these swimmers
going in their top events against San Jose State,
most are very well-rounded, as the Spartan com
petitors will soon discover. Stanford's goal for
the season, however, is the NCAA title, and in
this pursuit the Cardinal looks very formidable.
Stanford's biggest strength is in the backstroke
events. Five of the top 10 finishers in last year's
200 backstroke NCAA final are present this
season.

Besides Donahue, third in the 200 and second
in the 100 in 1987, Stanford has Miller, senior
Jennifer Pokluda, junior Jenny Shannon and
sophomore Laura McLean. All continue at the
top of their field, giving even an intrasquad
meet the look of the NCAA championship.
In the sprint freestyle events, the Cardinal
has Johnson, a five-time NCAA champion in
her first two seasons on the Farm, leading the
way. Behind her is senior Aimcc Berzins, the
runner-up to Johnson at the NCAA meet last
year. Furthermore, junior Dana Anderson and
sophomore Lisa Gillespie won All-America
honors in the 200 free.
In the longer freestyle events, Stanford has
eight-time All-Amcrican Shupc to complement
Gillespie and Anderson.
Johnson was an Olympic silver-medalist in
the 100 fly in 1984, while junior Monica
Niclcbcck is a strong competitor in the 200 fly.
Ixnth, two-time Olympian Susan Rapp and
sophomores Jill Johnson and Bethanne Lambert
provide strength in the breaststroke.
The Cardinal is even a power in the individual
medley events with two returning All-Americans,
McLean and Miller.
In the diving events, Stanford perhaps has its
best team ever with senior Leslie Klcinhckscl,
junior Amy Bichl and sophomore Ail-American
Katie Connors performing from both the one
and three-meter boards.
Stanford's lineup will reccivc a stern test next
weekend when the team ventures south to tangle
with UCI,A and USC. "They're good," Haines
said. "We expect to be favored to win the meets,
but they have some really good swimmers."
Things only get more interesting from there
as Stanford hosts Arizona State two weeks from
today. Then comes the big one Texas. The
winners of four consecutive national
titles, visit Stanford on Feb. 6 in what should
be a very exciting dual meet.
