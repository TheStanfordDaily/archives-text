# County probes health complaint
## 
### Sean Kinch Staff writer 
Acting on an anonymous complaint, officials from
the Santa Clara County Health Department conducted
inspections of three University buildings yesterday but
turned up no evidence of negligence or major safety
problems, according to Bob Halston, an acting super
visor for the department.
The complaint was apparently unrelated to a Dec.
10 letter alleging widespread safety problems in Uni
versity buildings that has resulted in an extensive
in-house review of University health and safety policies,
Halston said.
Halston, who is in charge of the department's hazar
dous materials storage program, said the complaint,
which was received by the county
last Thursday, concerned "the
storage of hazardous materials" but
was "very vague ... (including)
nothing more specific than the
names of the buildings."
County officials inspected the En
vironmental Safety Facility and the
Keck and McCullough buildings.
The three buildings are among 10
named Wednesday by the Univer
sity as the targets of a safety inves
tigation launched as a result of the
Dec. 10 letter.
Halston said that as far as he
knows it is "just a coincidence" that
the University is conducting its own

investigation of health and safety
standards in the same buildings.
The two Health Department of
ficials who performed the inspec
tion found no dangerous situations
in any of the buildings, and Halston
said he was particularly impressed
with the Environmental Safety Fa
cility, which he called "state of the
art" in toxic waste storage.
But he also commented that
there is "room for improvement,"
especially in segregating hazardous
chemicals.
Peter Burnes, the University's
chemical safety manager, said the
University is trying to conform to
state and federal hazardous mate
rial storage ordinances that have
been phased in since 1983.
According to Burnes, the inspec
tors found that every safety measure

"is done or is being done." He
added that the county has "asked
to be kept up-to-date on the
progress."
The building manager for Keck,
John Kennedy, said he has "an
ticipated a walk-through like this
for some time." He added that the
inspectors "were not shocked by
anything" they saw in Keck.
Halston said the biggest problem
in all three buildings inspected by
the county was "the general lack
of storage space" for toxic materi
als. He noted, however, that this
problem does not present any real
danger.
It is clear, Halston said, that the
University is in "a whole new pro
gram of toxic storage" and that
some areas are in "great shape."
