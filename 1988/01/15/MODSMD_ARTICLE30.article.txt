# Gymnasts open at Oregon State
## 
### Chris Kendrick 
Breaking or tying 17 school records last
season is not enough to satisfy the women's
gymnastics team. They want more.
Tonight, with aspirations of reaching the
NCAA championships, the 15th-ranked Car
dinal launches its 1988 campaign in Corvallis,
Ore., against the 12th-ranked Oregon State
Beavers.
Both teams, having graduated only one
senior, come off the 1987 season in outstand
ing shape with young but experienced squads.
"It will be a tough competition. We are
about at the same level," senior Cindy Boyd
said.
Last season was a breakthrough for a Stan
ford team that was strengthened by its youth.
Sophomore Dina Amoroso last year broke
previous team records in the vault and the
floor exercise and the all-around competition.
Head coach Homer Sardina said he
believes the 1988 team can only improve
upon those impressive accomplishments. "I
think this team has better chemistry," Sardina
said. "They've got better work habits."
A major influence of this chcmistry is the
leadership of the two seniors, Cindy Boyd
and Alison McGann.
The rigorous two-a-day practices endured
since fall quarter have hammered the team
into excellent physical shape. "One group

comes in as early as 7 a.m., and they work
on drills and aerobic conditioning. They come
back and go through a full workout," Sardina
said. "I call that a lot of dedication, and it
takes a special kind of group to do that."
Sardina gave the team a two-week break
over the holidays to ensure a solid mental
condition among his gymnasts.
"If you know Stanford, staying at school
after finals gets you absolutely nowhere as
a coach because the athletes are mentally
drained," Sardina said. "If you want them
fresh and bright, you get them away from
the environment for a while, and when they
come back it's automatic."
The squad returned to intensive training
Jan. 2. Sardina said he divides the workload
between events; the gymnasts start with the
vault and the beam in the morning and return
in the afternoon to concentrate on the floor
exercise and the uneven bars.
The two-week break may have strength
ened the squad mentally, as Sardina suggests,
but he admitted that the team loses a week's
worth of physical training in the gym. Oregon
State resumed its training Dec. 27.
"The three weeks of training make a dif
ference," Sardina said. "They should be a
little bit sharper. Hopefully, we are ready to
go into competition. I think physically we
are; now we have to make sure our athletes
are mentally prepared."
