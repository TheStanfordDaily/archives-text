# Golfers head south

After more than two months off,
the Stanford men's golf team will
return to competition Monday and
Tuesday in Santa Barbara.
The Hammond Bell Pacific Coast
Championship at the par-72
Sandpiper Country Club will be "a
short game contest," according to
Stanford Coach Wally Goodwin.
Because the tournament occurs so
soon after winter break, all the
players participating may not have
had a chance to fine-tune their
games, Goodwin said. "The team
that putts best will win."
Following "heated qualifying
rounds," Goodwin has determined
which five players he will take to
the event. The top qualifier was
John Mahon, a junior from Glen
dale, followed by Junior Roger
Miraglia, freshman Mark Funseth
and sophomores Don Christensen
and Brad Joondeph. Competition
for the fifth slot was tight, with
Joondeph narrowly edging his
roommate, sophomore Mike
Aubrey, in sudden death.
Goodwin said he is hoping to
finish near the top of an 18-team
field that includes nationally
ranked UC-Santa Barbara and local
rivals California and San Jose State.

Joondeph said the upcoming
tournament is a tune-up for the
rest of the season. "If we didn't
play well, it wouldn't be a setback,"
he said.
Joondeph also said he feels the
match will be a good opportunity
to see if two months of practice
have helped the Stanford players.
"We have worked hard, and this
tournament will show how much
that work has paid off," he said.
Goodwin said he has high hopes
for the season, especially since
many players returning from last
year's squad are much improved.
The 1987 team struggled through
out the season. Stanford's best tour
nament was a fifth-place finish at
home. But Goodwin said he expects
that to change this year.
He said his team has "improved
three to four shots per player over
last year." He added that his top
priority is an NCAA tournament
berth for the squad this season. In
order to be eligible, the Cardinal
will have to be one of the top six
teams in District 8, which includes
the states of Washington, Oregon,
California, Arizona and New
Mexico. Goodwin said he is opti
mistic about the team's chances of
gaining an NCAA slot.
