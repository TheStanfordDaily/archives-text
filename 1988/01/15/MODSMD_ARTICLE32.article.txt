# Men's gymnasts visit Fullerton
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
It's time for you to get to know
the Stanford men's gymnastics
team.
With everybody returning from
last year's team, three of the
nation's elite collegians, and with
an especially strong supporting cast,
the 1988 Cardinal is sure to be in
the fight for the NCAA champion
ship.
This weekend Stanford (2-0)
travels to Fullerton State for an
other minor competition like last
weekend's Spartan Open. Many of
the Cardinal gymnasts will be per
forming in only a few events, ac
cording to junior Scott Schaffer.
After the Spartan Open last
week, Cardinal Head Coach Sadao
Hamada said the team would not
be looking to shift into high gear
until February, at the UCLA Invi
tational. In the meantime, the gym

nasts will be looking to improve the
difficulty of their routines before
working on consistency and clean
execution.
Fullerton, no longer with the ser
vices of former Chinese Olympian
Li Xiao Ping, is nonethless a strong
team. Eli Rodriguez and Bill Bar
ham lead the Titans. At this point
in the season, however, neither
squad will be especially concerned
with the meet's overall outcome,
but will instead focus on the per
formance of individual gymnasts in
individual events.
The lack of interesting news
about this weekend's meet allows
for some digression. Whether it's
Hamada's tongue-in-cheek remarks
about visions of Buddha, the team's
music video or the pre-meet tradi
tion of Nerf football, this unit of
Cardinal gymnasts is not always a
serious bunch. This season's team
press guide proves this beyond a
doubt.

Without the money or press at
tention to get a four-color booklet
printed, the men's gymnastics press
guide comes in the form of a three
page printout that looks more like
a course syllabus than anything else.
Each of the 10 gymnasts has a sec
tion detailing his many athletic ac
complishments. Toward the end of
each player profile there is a token
word or two about academics and
hobbies. This is typical of every
press guide since the beginning of
time.
As one flips through this team's
guide, though, some atypical
hobbies and academic feats are
mentioned. One begins to get
skeptical as the personal facts about
these men get more and more ab
surd.
For example, after the extensive
list of former national team member
Randy Besosa's accomplishments, it
reads, "Hobbies include smiling."
Chuck Gerardo's pastimes include

"drawing and snibby," whatever
that is. Mike Matzek, who finished
12th at the recent Winter USA
Championships, lists his hobbies as
dining and dessert. His profile goes
on to say, "Married to former
Vanna White of Wheel of Fortune
Fame. . . . The couple has 44
children."
The profile of junior Andy Ropp
includes such fascinating material
as, "(Andy) had a recent summer
job as dishwasher." Schaffer, the
guide says, "won the Algebra II
award in Bth grade." Letters of con
gratulations can be sent to Scott,
care of Stanford gymnastics, Encina
Gym.
Assuming the Cardinal gymnasts
put aside their hobbies, family and
storied academic careers, they'll
soon be making the headlines as
one of the nation's top squads. In
the meantime, you can rest assured
that they're having a fairly good
time.
