# Card wrestlers in Aggie tourney
## 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
While most of Stanford's stu
dent population seems to be
migrating toward Lake Tahoe for
the upcoming extended
weekend, Stanford's wrestlers
will be taking a shorter trip up
Interstate 80.
Their destination will not be
the slopes of Squaw Valley, but
rather the campus of UC-Davis,
where the Cardinal grapplers
will wrestle in both a dual meet
against Chico State tonight and
the annual Aggie Invitational
tournament tomorrow.
Last year's Aggie tournament
was extremely successful for
Stanford, as six of its wrestlers
finished first or second in the
seven-team competition. This ef
fort gave the Cardinal a narrow
1.25-point victory over second
place finisher Chico State. Of
last year's six placers, four men
return to defend their high
finishes.
Sophomore Steve Yarbrough,
who won the tournament at 158
pounds last year, will try to con
tinue his title streak this
weekend. After finishing in the
top eight at last weekend's com
petitive Doc Petersen tourna
ment, Yarbrough said he feels
confident heading into the Aggie
meet.

"Winning the Aggie last year
was the high point of my season
at the time. It really helped my
confidence. If I wrestle well this

weekend, I think I have a chance
of doing it again," Yarbrough
said. '
Eric Harber took second at
last year's competition, and al
though this season he has been
demoted from the varsity ranks
by freshman Steve Buddie, he
will have a chance to compete
again tomorrow.
All seven teams at the tour
nament are allowed to bring 15
wrestlers — the 10 varsity
starters, plus five others — which
gives more team members the
opportunity to compete.
Sophomore Ron Perry, last
year's 177-pound runner-up at
the Aggie, will also return to try
to better his finish this year. 190-
pound senior Terry Mclntyre,
also second at the 1987 Aggie,
will make his final appearance
at Davis.
Although it appears that Stan
ford's squad is relatively strong,
with seven returning placewin
ners (Baum finished fourth and
Josh Lisle fifth last year), Coach
Chris Horpel said he is not
marking up his "win" column just
yet.
"It's really too close to call
this year," he said. "You can't
count on taking first. If we do
really well, maybe that will be
enough to win."
Stanford will return to wrestle
in its first home meet of the new
year this Tuesday, Jan. 19, when
it will host Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo at 7:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
