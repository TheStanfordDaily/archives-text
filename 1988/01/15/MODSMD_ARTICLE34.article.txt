# Men's swimmers go their separate ways

### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Part of the men's swimming
traveling team takes on Michigan
State and the University of Michi
gan this weekend, while the
remainder of the squad faces UC-
Davis.
Fourteen Cardinal swimmers and
two divers are in the Midwest clash
ing with the Spartans this afternoon
and the eighth-ranked Wolverines
tomorrow. The California division
of the team will head to Davis to
battle the Aggies tomorrow after
noon.
The Cardinal's top performers
are competing in a half-distance
meet against unheralded Michigan
State today as a warm-up for tomor
row's matchup with the nationally
ranked Wolverines. Instead of the
regular 100 and 200 yards, the
squads will swim 50-yard races in
every event. Except for freestyle,
the 50 is not a collegiate champi
onship event.
"Stanford won the NCAA Cham
pionships in East Lansing, so we're
excited about going back to the site
of Cardinal swimming history,"
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney said.
"The Wolverines are probably
stronger than their eighth-place
ranking," Kenney said. "They are
a real quality team."
Stanford will be on the lookout
for Michigan breaststroker Mike
Berriman, currently ranked second
nationally, as well as freestyler
Brent Lang and butterflier Marty
Moran, both NCAA finalists last
season. The Wolverine squad is also
known for its divers, who are
coached by three-time Olympic
Coach Dick Kimbell.

"Since we have never swum
against them before, we're going to
go into the meet focused. We can't
relax because we don't know what
we're going up against," tri-captain
Sean Murphy said. "We don't have
any idea about the balance of their
squad, which could make for an
interesting meet."
Because Stanford is only taking
14 swimmers, the team will be
counting on the men to produce in
two or three events each for the
Cardinal to be successful.
Stanford will be using the meet
to begin to shave times and perfor
mances to national championship
caliber. Kenney said he believes it
might be possible for three distance
swimmers, freestyler John Witchel,
butterflier Anthony Mosse and
backstroker Murphy, to qualify for
the NCAAs this weekend.
"This team really needs some
thing tangible to hold on to â€”
NCAA qualifying times would give
us that boost," Witchel said. "We'll
make everyone uncomfortable (for
the national finals) if we can make
cuts unshaved and untaped."
The remainder of the Cardinal
squad will try to improve its per
formance at Davis against the un
known Aggies. "We will mostly be
racing the clock," Asst. Coach Ted
Knapp said. "Everybody should be
faster than against Texas and
Arizona."
The swimmers who stay in Cali
fornia will not have a carefree
weekend, however. There are still
six places remaining on the travel
ing team, and good races at Davis
could earn competitors a trip south
to compete against UCLA and USC
in February.
