# Students underestimate danger, Cowell director warns
## Campus 'ecstasy' use widespread 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
Ecstasy is one of the most popular
drugs on campus despite its undesirable
side effects, according to Dr. Paul Wal
ters, director of Cowell Student Health
Center.
Stanford "was flooded with ecstasy last
year," Walters told a group of Toyon
residents last night. "A lot of people took
it."
However, Walters disputed the find
ings of a recently released study that
claims one-third of Stanford undergrad
uates have experimented with the drug.
The study, conducted in May by a
Stanford neurologist and released last
month, found that 39 percent of students
interviewed had tried ecstasy at least
once.
"I don't think one-third of the students
did it," Walters said. "I don't think one
third of Stanford students have done
anything."
A study done by Cowell in 1986 con
cluded that the number of undergradu
ates who have tried the drug was 6 per
cent, enough for Walters to term it"the
major drug around here."
Walters noted that although a labora
tory in Berkeley suspected to be the

source of much of the ecstasy on campus
recently shut down, "it will still be avail
able as long as there is a market for it.
[There] is a superior job of marketing,
saying that [ecstasy] make, roommates
closer and heightens sense perception.
We've been looking for that since anti
quity," he said.
Walters added, "People say [ecstasy]
seems to be relatively safe and cheap,
but it's a peculiar drug."
Besides having what Walters terms
"peripheral effects" such as anxiety, in
creased heart rate, teeth-clenching and
depression, he said the drug can also
have effects on the central nervous sys
tem.
"It's a peculiar drug. I would tend not
to trust it,"he said.
Walters outlined his policy concerning
students curious about drugs: "I make a
deal with students. If you have a drug
and want to find out what it is, I'll find
out, no questions asked. I don't want to
know your name, and I don't care what
you do with it."
He said his goal is not to influence
students, but to have them make informa
tive decisions.
Walters stressed that the effects of
drugs are unpredictable, cautioning the

students that "it's not the drug, it's the
setting."
"What has fascinated me about people
who take drugs is that for the most part,
they would not go into a store and buy
things off the shelf that aren't labeled,
even if they were told, 'That's a can of
tomato soup,' " he said.
"I know whatever I tell you ... you
will make your own decisions, and I'd
rather you make them using infor
mation," he said.
Before becoming director of Cowell in
1983, Walters spent 26 years at Harvard
University, working at the Harvard Men
tal Health Service. Following what he
called "a series of unfortunate events"
related to drug use in the 19605, Walters
was <»sked to teach a course on street
drugs.
"About three weeks into the course,
it became clear I had run out of what I
knew about street drugs," he said, adding
that much of his knowledge of drugs
came later, by talking with students.
"I don't really think people take drugs
to have fun, even though they may be
fun, or because they're screwed up —
although they may be screwed up," he
said. "I don't know why they take drugs;
there's no one reason."
