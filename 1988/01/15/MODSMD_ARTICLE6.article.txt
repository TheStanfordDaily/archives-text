Democratic presidential hope
ful Rev. Jesse Jackson will not
make his previously scheduled
appearance here Tuesday be
cause of scheduling difficulties,
according to graduate student
David Drummond, co-organizer
of the campus Students for Jack
son campaign.
Although Jackson will make a
one-day trip to California Tues
day, the 4 p.m. speech he was
to give at Memorial Auditorium
was sandwiched between a noon
luncheon in Sacramento with his
national campaign manager, As
sembly Speaker Willie Brown,

and a fund-raising event that
evening in San Francisco.
Drummond, who found out
yesterday morning from Jack
son's national campaign office in
Chicago that Jackson is not com
ing, said he was "disappointed
by the unfortunate turn of
events."
Drummond added, "It simply
was not possible to get him from
Sacramento down to Stanford
and then back up to San Fran
cisco." However, Drummond
said he is optimistic that Jackson
will make an appearance at Stan
ford sometime in the near future,
probably in April or right before
the June California Democratic
primary.
