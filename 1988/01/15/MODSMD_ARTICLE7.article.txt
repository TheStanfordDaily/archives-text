# Faculty unrest over TA issue grows
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Concern over insufficient num
bers of teaching assistants (TAs)
for undergraduate classes and a dis
crepancy in TA availability among
schools has prompted the Univer
sity Subcommittee on Evaluation
and Improvement in Teaching to
begin examining the problem, ac
cording to Education Prof. Denis
Phillips, committee chair.
The committee has also been
asked by the deans of graduate and
undergraduate studies to focus on
the training and evaluation of TAs.
A committee report will be released
this spring, Phillips said.
Sociology Prof. Henry Walker has
joined other faculty who have
recently voiced concern over
shortages of TAs and the trend
toward "mass education" that they
say compromises the quality of un
dergraduate teaching at Stanford.
Walker said hr intends to inves

tigate and "find out the real nature
of the problem" that has caused
him to eliminate the discussion sec
tion of one class and suffice with
one TA for a class of 70 students.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein
said the recent outcries over specific
problems in his and other depart
ments are "symptomatic of larger
issues" of TA shortages that arc
undermining the quality and focus
of undergraduate education at
Stanford.
Bernstein said he has spent about
20 hours in the past week figuring
out issues concerning TAs and
rooms, an amount equal to the time
he has spent teaching.
Walker said that at a relatively
small research university such as
Stanford, professors "ought not to
be placed in a position to instruct
300 to 400 students."
He said it is "professionally and
personally embarrassing when a
professor walks into a class the first
day and is forced to say, 'I do not

know what I am going to do with
the class because I do not have a
TA," or when classes are so
modified that students "may not get
as much out of them."
Walker asserted that "something
is going to have to be changed,"
although Bernstein acknowledged,
"there is no single cause" of the
problem.
The most conspicuous cases of
TA shortages appear in the social
sciences, particularly the history,
political science and sociology de
partments.
Some of the reasons Bernstein
cited for the TA shortage include
the lack of flexibility in paying and
selecting course assistants and the
lack of available and qualified grad
uate students.
Dorothy Blake, a graduate assis
tant in political sciencc, pointed out
that there is "generally a tremen
dous shortage of teaching assis
tants" because "conscientious
teaching assistance takes time away

from dissertations."
Walker also noted that teaching
gets the "short shift" because most
graduate students get jobs on the
basis of their research.
Bernstein said the problem has
been growing, and that in the past
four or five years he has not had
half the number of teaching assis
tants he needs for his classes, in
cluding the popular history course,
"America Since 1945."
This year Bernstein said has
only one-fourth or -fifth of wnat he
deems a sufficent number of TAs.
Only 60 students of the class' 200
are provided with TAs.
In other departments, including
Human Biology and Physics, the
problem does not appear to be as
acute or is not an issue at all. In
physics, according to Cabrera,
teaching is an important part of the
graduate education and is often in-
eluded as part of graduate financial
aid packages.
According to Walker, the
shortage is due to unexpected bur
geoning enrollment in some classes
without a proportional increase in
TA allocation.
In human biology, according to
Shirley Feldman, a senior research
scientist in psychiatry who is also

associated with human biology,
"there is no shortage of high-caliber
and devoted teaching assistants."
Human biology also uses under
graduate TAs to supplement the
usual complement of graduate TAs.
Bernstein, however, noted that un
dergraduate TAs would be less ef
fective in social science courses be
cause "they demand a more
cumulative and subtle understan
ding" of the subject.
In addition to these differences,
the method of allocating TAs varies

between schools and departments
and is not based on a consistent,
University-wide policy.
The School of Engineering
divides its TAs among the engineer
ing departments in proportion to
the number of units each is ex
pected to award that quarter.
Ken Down, an associate dean at
the School of Engineering, said,
"The policy may not be enough,
but at least it is fair." He added
that he did not think the same for
mula was used by the other schools.
