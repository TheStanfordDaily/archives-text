## DATELINE 
### 
Dole campaign aide resigns post
David Owen, a longtime close political ally of Sen. Robert Dole
(R-Kan.) stepped down yesterday as national finance co-chairman
of the Senate minority leader's presidential campaign after nearly
a week of questions about his handling of Elizabeth Hanford Dole's
blind trust.
The questions centered on his role as the trust's financial adviser
in 1986 when it bought and sold an office building in suburban
Kansas City, Kan. In addition to Owen, two others who have been
associated with Sen. Dole were involved either with the trust or
the real estate transaction. One of them, a former Dole aide,
obtained a government contract with the senator's backing.
At a hastily convened news conference yesterday, Owen again
declined to explain the transaction, citing restrictions imposed by
the terms of the blind trust. Because of those restrictions, no one
affiliated with the trust has revealed whether the Elizabeth Dole
trust or individuals associated with Sen. Dole benefitted from the
complex deal.
In announcing his decision to "temporarily suspend my activities
on the campaign," Owen said: "At no time, under any circumstances,
did I discuss the transactions of that trust with either the senator
or Mrs. Dole."
Campaigning in lowa, Sen. Dole said of Owen's decision: "That's
good. We don't need that in this campaign. In our campaign, if
there is an appearance of bad judgment or misjudgment, or somebody
has a problem, I think you should just step aside."
Arias: Peace plan in danger
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica — President Oscar Arias Sanchez said
yesterday that his Central American peace plan faces imminent
collapse unless Nicaragua acts immediately to comply with its re
quirements for democratic reform.
On the eve of a regional summit to judge results of the five-nation
peace accord, Arias said that U.S. aid to Nicaraguan rebels and
superpower rivalry in the region are obstacles to cease-fires in its
three guerrilla wars.
But the peace plan's Nobel Prize-winning author emphasized
that "some of the Central American governments" are more to
blame than outsiders. He focused most of his criticism on the
Sandinista government in Managua.
Arias made public a strongly worded letter he sent Wednesday
to Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. It criticized recent state
ments by Ortega confirming plans to build a Soviet-equipped reserve
army of nearly 500,000 men and declaring the Sandinistas would
never give up power even if they lost an election.
The letter also said that there was no excuse for maintaining a
state of emergency, press curbs and political prisoners in Nicaragua.
The peace accord, signed Aug. 7, obliged the signatory nations to
end such restrictions and grant amnesties within 150 days.
"What I'm saying to Ortega in that letter is that if these things
are not done now, right now, immediately, the consequence will
be more war," Arias said in an interview.
German nuclear probe widens
BONN, W. Germany — Prosecutors are investigating whether
radioactive material suitable for making nuclear weapons may have
been delivered to Libya and Pakistan in recent years by persons
implicated in a Belgian-West German nuclear waste shipment scan
dal, Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer said last night.
The West German nuclear shipment company Transnuklear, which
is at the center of the nine-month-old scandal, may have transported
weapons-grade nuclear material to the northern port of Luebeck
for later shipment to Libya and Pakistan, Toepfer told journalists
after an emergency meeting of a parliamentary environment com
mittee.
Indications are that the nuclear material may have come from
a Belgian processing plant at Mol, near Antwerp, he said.
"Information to this effect is being investigated," Toepfer said.
The investigation was made public as the federal government
ordered the immediate shutdown of the Nukem nuclear fuel man
ufacturing company, which owns a controlling interest in Transnuk
lear.
The Nukem company, based at Hanau near Frankfurt in the
central state of Hesse, was closed because it failed to inform
authorities of irregularities in Transnuklear's transportation and
processing of nuclear waste, Toepfer said.
Meese friend pleads not guilty
NEW YORK — E. Robert Wallach, Attorney General Edwin
Meese Ill's longtime friend and former lawyer, and two other
defendants pleaded not guilty yesterday to charges of racketeering
in a scheme to influence Meese and other government officials to
benefit the scandal-tainted Wedtech Corp.
Wallach said after his arraignment that his activities on behalf
of Wedtech, a New York City defense company that sought no-bid
government contracts as a minority-run business, "were both ded
icated and lawful," consistent with what he described as 30 years
of work on behalf of minorities.
He predicted that "the true motivation (of the prosecution) will
become apparent," but his lawyer cut off questions on what this
meant. Wallach had sought unsuccessfully to have his case handled
by an independent counsel conducting a related probe of Meese,
contending that the Department of Justice would not treat him
fairly because of his ties to the attorney general.
Dr. R. Kent London, a former Wedtech consultant charged with
defrauding the now-bankrupt company of more than $1 million,
said that he was "a pawn in a political game" and that his "rights
are being sacrificed to an overzealous prosecution motivated by
political considerations."
Asked what politics had to do with his indictment, London told
a reporter to read the New York Times, apparently a reference to
reports here that U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani may resign
to seek the Republican nomination for the Senate.
Haitian opposition calls for strike
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Opposition leaders, labeling next
Sunday's presidential election "farcical," called yesterday for a
national strike to be held the day before the voting.
Declaring that "we don't want to give an appearance of credibility
to a masquerade," four of the major political figures of this black
Caribbean nation repeated their call for a boycott of the election
scheduled by the army-led government. They also expressed fear
of renewed violence similar to the terrorism that aborted a previous
election attempt here last Nov. 29.
The four opposition leaders, who were among the leading pres
idential candidates in the unsuccessful November election, also
denounced the scores of arrests in the past few days of provincial
anti-government activists who have been urging Haitians not to go
to the polls Sunday.
By calling for a boycott, the opposition leaders were risking
arrest. Under a new law proclaimed by the army-controlled
government's handpicked Electoral Council, urging voters to stay
away from the polls is punishable by a fine and prison sentence.
