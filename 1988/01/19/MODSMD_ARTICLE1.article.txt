# Officials plan new housing
## Two sites named as options 
### Frank Quaratiello Staff writer 
New undergraduate housing will be constructed on
either the golf driving range near Governor's Corner
or on the site of the Manzanita trailer park, according
to plans being formulated by University officials.
The target date for completion of the new dormitory
complex is 1991, said Keith Guy, director of Housing
and Food Service. Guy said the complex will probably
cost about $20 million.
The proposed undergraduate dormitory will be a
little larger than Sterling Quadrangle, which houses
450 students, according to Rodger Whitney, director
of Housing. Based on studies conducted by the Uni
versity administration, the creation of a dormitory of
this size would guarantee four years of on-campus
housing for all undergraduates, Whitney said.
Currently, 87 percent of Stanford undergraduates
are housed on campus, but for several years the ad
ministration has been planning to make four years of
on-campus housing available for all undergraduates,
according to Whitney. At present, undergraduates are
guaranteed only three years of on-campus housing.
"The driving range would be the easiest site because
it is available, but it is also farther from the center
of campus," Guy said. "The Manzanita Park site would
be more expensive to build on because we would have
to replace the beds lost, but it is centrally located."
Last spring, a group of administration officials
chaired by Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm Rob
inson met with architects from the firm of Backen,
Arrigoni & Ross to discuss the feasibility of building
a new undergraduate housing complex, according to
Guy.
The firm designed the new graduate housing complex
now under construction between the Cowcll Cluster
and Escondido Village.
After considering factors of location, function and
cost, the architects recently concluded that construc
tion of a new undergraduate housing complex is
feasible, Guy said.
Whitney said the administration will form a working
committee of faculty, staff and students to finalize
plans for the new dormitory. The committee will prob
ably be chaired by Robinson, Whitney added.
Whitney and Guy both agreed that the source of
funding for the proposed dormitory is very uncertain.
Part of the money from the Centennial Campaign
is slated to go toward undergraduate housing, but
Whitney said that much of this money would be spent
on improving existing facilities.
Whitney added that the new undergraduate housing
complex will probably be financed through debt service,
which involves using low-interest state bonds to pay
construction costs.
For several years, the University has been building
up a reserve fund to help pay for such construction,
but room fees will still have to be increased to pay
for part of the cost of the proposed housing complex,
Whitney said.
Both Guy and Whitney said that the closing of
Roble Hall hasn't had a major effect on the ad
ministration's decision to go ahead with the new un
dergraduate housing plans.
"The Roblc situation and the new un
dergraduate housing plans arc two sepa
rate issues," Whitney said.
Guy added that the Roble closing has
encouraged administration officials who
are planning the new undergraduate
housing complex to "proceed with due
haste."
No final decision has yet been made
as to the future of Roble Hall, Whitney
said.
"Everyone hopes that we will be able
to shore Roble up because it is a very
popular dorm, but it may prove more
cost-effective to just start over again,"
Whitney said. He added that studies are
being done now to determine the best
course of action.
