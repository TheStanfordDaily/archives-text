# Jennifer Kemp makes campaign stop
## Candidate's daughter blasts media 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Echoing Democratic candidate Gary
Hart's recent statements regarding the
press, the daughter of Republican presi
dential hopeful Jack Kemp criticized the
media's dominance in the electoral proc
ess at a meeting of the College
Republicans Friday.
Appearing at the Law School on behalf
of her father, Jennifer Kemp described a
presidential debate in Houston in which
the press, in her opinion, did not give
her father enough credit.
She said her father "was terrific" and
received a positive response from the au
dience.
Kemp summarized her father's reasons
for seeking the Republican nomination
and responded to questions regarding the
Equal Rights Ammendment (ERA), the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and So
cial Security.
She said her father sees "defending
freedom and Western values for all
people" as an important challenge in the

future, and described a fact-finding trip
to Central America on which the Qntire
family accompanied her father.
"My Dad took us to Central America,
and we talked to contras and iheir
families," she said. "These were people
my age, fighting for freedom."
Kemp said another major priority for
her father is "defending the family," add
ing that he is "100 percent pro-life."
Another reason her father has entered
the 1988 presidential race is his desire to
"restore America to a strong economy,"
Kemp said. She outlined a plan to create
"enterprise zones" in areas with high un
employment in order to "provide incen
tives for entrepeneurs to go into depressed
areas and hire people."
When asked to compare her feelings
on the ERA with her father's, she said
she agreed with his position that there
should be "equal rights for all people,
including equal pay for equal work," but
not necessarily an Equal Rights Amend
ment.
Kemp described SDI as "a defensive
system, not the 'Star Wars' the media

describes. It is moral to defend yourself."
She also emphasized that her father would
push for deployment of the space-based
defense system.
When asked if her father would con
sider cutting Social Security to balancc
tha budget, Kemp said "There is waste,
there are areas that can be eliminated
and my father believes in cutting those
areas."
She noted, however, that her father led
the successful battle to keep President
Reagan from freezing cost-of-living in
creases to Social Security recipients. Jack
Kemp "advocates combining the private
sector and the public sector" to solve the
problems with Social Security.
She said the difficulties that the family
of a nominee must undergo during a pres
idential campaign were of great impor
tance in Kemp's decision to run. "We
talked about it as a family and decided
he was doing it for the right reasons,"
she said.
In order to campaign for her father,
Kemp has taken a year off of teaching
elementary school.
