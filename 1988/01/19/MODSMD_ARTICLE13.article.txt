What follows is a story of corporate greed and
economic misfortune conspiring to fleece the Stan
ford University Libraries of hundreds of thousands
of dollars each year and impoverish the resources
available to Stanford's scholars. It is a story that
will end happily only if the academic community
unites to radically change the way in which it dis
seminates information.
The problem is the skyrocketing cost of academic
journals, especially in the sciences. Next year, for
example, Stanford Libraries will have to increase
its procurement budget by $660,000 — almost 15
percent — just to cover cost increases. All told,
Stanford will have to spend $5,203,000 just to main
tain its collection.
The lion's share of this money — one-third of
it — goes toward buying scientific publications. The
$1.7 million that Stanford spends on scientific pub
lications is more than its book budget for the
humanities, the social sciences, government docu
ments, special collections and Meyer Library com
bined.
This disparity in expenditure derives from the
fact that it costs more to keep current in science
than in other fields. One reason is the weak dollar.
Many scientific journals are European, and when
the dollar falls, as it has since 1986, subscription
prices necessarily increase.
Another factor is the proliferation of scientific
journals. In a process known as "twigging," each
scientific subspecialty has at least one magazine.
Falconer Biology Library, for example, subscribes
to Photobiochemistry and Photobiophysics (E
-lsevier: $221.50/ year), Photochemistry and
Photobiology (Pergamon: $712.00/ two years) and
Photosynthesis Research (Martinus Nijhoff:
$300/ year) to name just a few photobiological twigs.
Compared to these pricy publications, Yeast is a
bargain at $99.50.

Corporate greed contributes to twigging — two
$250/ year magazines are better than one, if you are
out to make money. And it causes outrageous
pricing. As an example, look at Robert Maxwell,
head of Pergamon Press of England, who has in
creased to 40 percent the profit margin on Pergamon
publications. That means that Stanford's subscrip
tion to Photochemistry and Photobiology lines Max
well's pocket with $248.80.
Maxwell and his avaricious cronies at Elsevier,
Nijhoff and elsewhere can get away with such
gouging only because they have a captive market
— university libraries. In any other context, such
profiteering exploitation would be condemned as
extortion. In this one, perversely, it is lauded as
skillful management.
Actions such as Maxwell's betray the publishing
industry's public trust. More seriously, though, they
cause the market of ideas to fail in its primary
purpose: the effective dissemination of information.
For a school like Stanford, which can afford to pay
industrial extortion, the situation is not yet a dis
aster.
The solution to this problem is innovation. If
Pergamon and Elsevier are not concerned with
scholars, scholars should circumvent Pergamon and
Elsevier. The obvious way to do so is through
on-line, electronic publishing.
Stanford has the talent and resources to take
the lead. An on-line, academic publishing network
could start with schools such as Stanford, Cal Tech,
UC-Berkeley and MIT, all of which have strong
science programs and computer resources. Such a
system would inevitably spread throughout the na
tion and the world. And it would liberate research
institutions from the painful fetters of economic
chance and capitalist mcrcy. It is an idea whose
time has come.
