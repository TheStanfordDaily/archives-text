## Heed Dr. King's message 
### 
A polite stare is still a stare, and
whispered insults still insults.
Yesterday, our nation and the
Stanford community honored the
life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
We celebrate the triumph of the
human soul over the torments suf
fered by blacks who endured foul
shrieks of hatred, water cannons,
dogs and jail sentences — punish
ments imposed for their courageous
attempts to sit in the front of a bus
or at a lunch counter.

No other leader of his generation
so fired my imagination or held
rapt my allegiance as Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. Why would I, as a
white, suburban, middle-class teen
ager, have been so moved by this
man. The answer is that Dr. King
stood for everything that was fair
and just, and his non-violent per
sistence seemed for a time to be
succeeding in overwhelming what I
naively hoped were all the barriers
to full equality. King's gentle
struggle was the moral and spiritual
continuation of the principles em
bodied in the American Revolution
and those of the nascent democra
cies emerging from colonialism in
Asia and Africa. And he was my
main hero.
Reform congregations in those
days, in one of which I was a youth
grouper, were low on Jewish ritual
and high on social action. The folk

rock and protest songs of the day
were our liturgy: "Civil rights!" was
the watchword of our faith. The
most important "mitzvahs" (good
deeds) we could do then were to
tutor those who needed help and
to collect money for the NAACP.
When our congregation's rabbi
went to Selma to support King we
felt as though we were at the side
of a Moses who would lay low the
Pharoahs of the South with the rod
of his words. We felt close to God.
All the rabbis of my generation
grew up with this ideological fervor,
and King remains a role model.
Yet the Messiah did not come.
King's achievements merely opened
doors leading to an anteroom from
which the downtrodden could see
more doors slammed in their faces.
We were all legally entitled to civil
rights, but would economic equality
ever be obtained in the land? And
the hateful stares and shouts still
pierced the air.
Exactly one year ago, I traveled
to Forsyth County, Ga., to be a
part of the civil rights march. For
the first time in my life, I encoun
tered the worst in humankind. They
lined the road like a gauntlet,
howling slurs and hurling gestures
such as I had never experienced.
And, almost 20 years after King's
murder, I gained on that march
new respect for all the men who
had marched with him. For during
his marches — unlike during mine
— the police had been present not
to protect the marchers, but to sup
port the mob.
But it is 20 years later, and the

struggle we have ahead of us is not
with hellmobs but with institutional
racism that is so subtle we don't
always recognize that it resides
within us, too. We can continue
King's struggle, even on our own
campus. There are, simply, too few
minorities at Stanford in every cat
egory of student, faculty and ad
ministration. And those who are
here are culturally invisible in the
curriculum of the University, as are
women and Jews.

. . . the struggle we
have ahead of us is
not with hellmobs,
but with institu
tional racism so
subtle we don't al
ways recognize that
it resides within us
too.

The gains to be made will no
longer be as dramatic as those
during King's leadership. But a
polite stare is still a stare, and
whispered insults still insults. And
the members of this community still
have work to do — together.
