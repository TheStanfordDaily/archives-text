## Accommodating the kosher diet 
### 
A kosher food alternative at Stanford is an
absolute must. By not providing students on
campus with a kosher meal alternative, Stanford
is being discriminatory. Many practicing Jews
accepted to Stanford do not attend this institu
tion because Stanford does not offer them a
kosher kitchen, whereas some universities do.

Those students who keep kosher and decide
to attend Stanford despite the drawback must
get off the meal plan when they live in the
dorms. A blessing, you may think. However, this
is not the case, as there is nowhere to cook
other than the kitchenettes. It would be impos
sible to keep the kitchenettes kosher without
infringing upon the rights of other dorm resi
dents who would want to prepare non-kosher
food there, as is their right.
As it is the only alternative short of getting
off the meal plan, some students become
vegetarians at Stanford. Yet, with even such
drastic changes in their diets, they are still not
keeping within the strict laws of Kashrut, since

the kitchens in which these vegetarian meals
are prepared are not kosher.
An alternative for these practicing Jews would
be to live off campus for all four years. But
why should a student be discriminated against
and deprived of an integral segment of the
Stanford experience because of his or her reli
gious commitments?
For precisely the reasons described above,
there are fewer Jews at Stanford than there
would be if the University established a kosher
kitchen. Many prospective freshmen are lost to
universities such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Tufts, Pennsylvania, Berkeley, Brandeis, etc.,
where kosher food accommodations are provid
ed. This also is the case for many bright young
Jews who do not even consider Stanford as an
option because the University does not provide
for their dietary needs. If we can have a
vegetarian option served at every meal and two
vegetarian houses, why shouldn't we have a
kosher kitchen?
To remedy its discriminatory actions, I pro
pose that the University establish a kosher
kitchen. This would serve a dual purpose. First,
it would accommodate those students who are
compromising their religious commitments to

attend Stanford. Second, it would make Stanford
a feasible option for kosher students. This is a
great opportunity for the University to prove its
commitment to achieving the diversity it claims
to have.

Many practicing Jews acceptcd
to Stanford do not attend this
university because Stanford
does not offer them a kosher
kitchen, whereas other univer
sities do.

The kitchen could be located in one of the
row houses where undergraduates as well as
graduate students could participate in such a
meal plan. These houses arc small enough to
meet the needs of kosher students who are
already enrolled at Stanford, while attracting
the prospective freshmen who would otherwise
choose another more accommodating university.
