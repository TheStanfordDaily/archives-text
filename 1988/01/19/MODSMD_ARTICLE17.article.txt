# Capriciousness of the law
## 
### 
"It's not just a good idea. It's the law."
That's from a New York state advertisement trying
to get people to obey the speed limit. And that's not
just an advertisement. It's an admission.

It's an admission that the sword of justice is more
like a Food Service plastic fork. New York knows that
the average citizen these days doesn't care too much
about what the law has to say. If it wants to convince
someone to drive 55, it knows it better first convince
them that it's a good idea. Of course, it's not such a
great idea, and that's why the average speed on an
American highway (before the speed limit increases)
was 66 mph.
The more you think about this situation, the more
scary it becomes. Our country, supposedly founded
on law and order, is nothing of the kind. As a child
grows up in today's society, he rapidly learns that the
law is to be ignored.
His parents probably drive a lot faster than 55, and
at 16 he will, too. About the same time he may start
to drink — five years before he is legally able to. As
he gets older, and his even older friends start to hang
out in bars and nightclubs, he will no doubt acquire
a fake ID — a felony in some states.
Any salesman will tell you that the way to change
someone's attitude is to do it a little bit at a time.
This is exactly what our society is doing to young
adults — getting them first to break small laws, such
as the one prohibiting duplication of copyrighted
records, then bigger laws, like alcohol, and then finally
felonies like fake IDs.
One wonders where this process stops. The reason
I don't steal from people is because I like them and
would feel bad if I hurt them. It has little or nothing
to do with the law. Now imagine the homeless child
who feels alienated and unwanted by his community.
You can see why he might turn into a thief. He doesn't
like people, and the law is as much a joke to him as
it is to everyone else. In the same situation, you or
I might do the same.
To make the affair even cruelcr, the law is not a
complete joke, but only a partial one. At unpredictable
intervals it rears its head and delivers a whopping big
bite to some unlucky citizen, such as the occasional
(and invariably shocked) Stanford student who gets
ticketed for underage drinking. This is not justice.

This is a lottery.
By setting the odds of getting punished at a
ridiculously low level, and by making laws that no one
really expects to be obeyed anyway, you ensure that
a random handful of people will get nailed with a
$100 ticket, while everyone else is breaking the same
law.
And it's not as if these punishments arc at all
effective in changing behavior. I know two people who
have received minor-in-posscssion tickets. Although
sapped finances sometimes leave them drinking Schlitz,
you can bet they're still drinking.
Capriciousness of the law is not something that
should be tolerated. If there's a law, it should be
enforced. And if it can't be enforced, the law should
be dropped — obviously there's something wrong with
it.
You can only ignore so many laws before you lose
respect for the legal system. I've reached that point,
and so have many people I know.
When I see a police car now, I can't help but flinch
and try to determine which laws I'm in violation of
at that particular moment, and this is just not the
way it should be. I consider myself a basically good
guy — certainly I never knowingly do harm to anyone
else. I shouldn't have to consider policemen to be
evil. If the system were working right, I'd justly consider
them my friends. After all, they're here to serve and
protect, right?
What burns me even more is the pervasiveness of
the problem. I genuinely don't know anyone who has
never broken the law. One girl from my dorm last
year is so pure she could make Snow White blush
(she scored 96 on the purity test), yet even she managed
to get herself a speeding ticket.
My father, who is the kind of guy who would rather
pay extra taxes than risk cheating the IRS, comes the
closest of anyone I know to being lawful. But once,
just once, he was late to a meeting and increased his
speed to 5 mph over the limit. Sure enough, just as
Murphy's ninth law calls for, an officer ticketed him.
To this day my dad warns me not to speed.
It would be funny if it weren't so stupid. How can
our society make laws, then break them and not even
pretend to be surprised when they're broken? Why
are we making a mockery of our legal system while
some criminals are inflicting untold grief upon us?
The law of averages says that someone who reads
this may someday be in a position of power. Please,
if you ever happen to be involved with the making of
laws, remember this: Don't shrug it off. Rome wasn't
built in a day and it didn't fall in a day either. It fell
little by little while people shrugged at the lack of
order.

on law and order, is nothing of the kind. As a child
grows up in today's society, he rapidly learns that the
law is to be ignored.
His parents probably drive a lot faster than 55, and
at 16 he will, too. About the same time he may start
to drink — five years before he is legally able to. As
he gets older, and his even older friends start to hang
out in bars and nightclubs, he will no doubt acquire
a fake ID — a felony in some states.
Any salesman will tell you that the way to change
someone's attitude is to do it a little bit at a time.
This is exactly what our society is doing to young
adults — getting them first to break small laws, such
as the one prohibiting duplication of copyrighted
records, then bigger laws, like alcohol, and then finally
felonies like fake IDs.
One wonders where this process stops. The reason
I don't steal from people is because I like them and
would feel bad if I hurt them. It has little or nothing
to do with the law. Now imagine the homeless child
who feels alienated and unwanted by his community.
You can see why he might turn into a thief. He doesn't
like people, and the law is as much a joke to him as
it is to everyone else. In the same situation, you or
I might do the same.
To make the affair even cruelcr, the law is not a
complete joke, but only a partial one. At unpredictable
intervals it rears its head and delivers a whopping big
bite to some unlucky citizen, such as the occasional
(and invariably shocked) Stanford student who gets
ticketed for underage drinking. This is not justice.

This is a lottery.
By setting the odds of getting punished at a
ridiculously low level, and by making laws that no one
really expects to be obeyed anyway, you ensure that
a random handful of people will get nailed with a
$100 ticket, while everyone else is breaking the same
law.
And it's not as if these punishments arc at all
effective in changing behavior. I know two people who
have received minor-in-posscssion tickets. Although
sapped finances sometimes leave them drinking Schlitz,
you can bet they're still drinking.
Capriciousness of the law is not something that
should be tolerated. If there's a law, it should be
enforced. And if it can't be enforced, the law should
be dropped — obviously there's something wrong with
it.
You can only ignore so many laws before you lose
respect for the legal system. I've reached that point,
and so have many people I know.
When I see a police car now, I can't help but flinch
and try to determine which laws I'm in violation of
at that particular moment, and this is just not the
way it should be. I consider myself a basically good
guy — certainly I never knowingly do harm to anyone
else. I shouldn't have to consider policemen to be
evil. If the system were working right, I'd justly consider
them my friends. After all, they're here to serve and
protect, right?
What burns me even more is the pervasiveness of
the problem. I genuinely don't know anyone who has
never broken the law. One girl from my dorm last
year is so pure she could make Snow White blush
(she scored 96 on the purity test), yet even she managed
to get herself a speeding ticket.
My father, who is the kind of guy who would rather
pay extra taxes than risk cheating the IRS, comes the
closest of anyone I know to being lawful. But once,
just once, he was late to a meeting and increased his
speed to 5 mph over the limit. Sure enough, just as
Murphy's ninth law calls for, an officer ticketed him.
To this day my dad warns me not to speed.
It would be funny if it weren't so stupid. How can
our society make laws, then break them and not even
pretend to be surprised when they're broken? Why
are we making a mockery of our legal system while
some criminals are inflicting untold grief upon us?
The law of averages says that someone who reads
this may someday be in a position of power. Please,
if you ever happen to be involved with the making of
laws, remember this: Don't shrug it off. Rome wasn't
built in a day and it didn't fall in a day either. It fell
little by little while people shrugged at the lack of
order.

"It's not just a good idea. It's the law."
That's from a New York state advertisement trying
to get people to obey the speed limit. And that's not
just an advertisement. It's an admission.

It's an admission that the sword of justice is more
like a Food Service plastic fork. New York knows that
the average citizen these days doesn't care too much
about what the law has to say. If it wants to convince
someone to drive 55, it knows it better first convince
them that it's a good idea. Of course, it's not such a
great idea, and that's why the average speed on an
American highway (before the speed limit increases)
was 66 mph.
