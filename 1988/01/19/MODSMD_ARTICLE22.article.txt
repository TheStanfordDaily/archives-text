## Sedated, hypnotized or anesthetized... The 						Bug mixes potions to knock you out cold

I for one am thrilled that they
are putting condom machines in my
dorm. If they work as well as the
candy machines, chances are that
when I really need a condom the
machines will be out of order and
will spit my money back at me. Or
worse, will give me a Reese's
Peanut Butter Cup instead.

Last time I checked, Peanut But
ter Cups were not recommended
as contraceptives. But they sure do
make you taste good.
Hurry up and send your questions
to Bug Me, Stanford Daily, Storke
Bldg, Stanford, CA, 94305. Or, for
you computer folks, send e-mail to
Bug-Me (not B.Bug-Me) at the
tragedies on LOTS. Remember, it's
your only chance to have your
"name and address withheld" with
out writing to Penthouse.

Dear Bug,
Quite often in a movie some
upstanding citizen (who really turns
out to be the villain) will slip some
drug into someone's drink — making
them unconcious — for one reason
or another, and then revive them later.
Sometimes it's a powder, other times
a liquid, but it always seems to work
very quickly.
My question is: Do such concoc
tions really exist? And if so, how did
these wonderful citizens of the social
community obtain them so easily
without anyone finding out? Do I
have to worry about my roommate
doing this to me so she can have a
'friend' over some night without me
knowing?

to become a victim.
You are referring, of course, to
the requisite scene in all spy movies
in which the mysterious and sexy
female is having a drink with the
powerful and rich male, when sud
denly the female creates a small
diversion, such as producing a rabid
muskrat from beneath her bras
siere, and proceeds to slip a blue
liquid from a small vial into the
drink of the male.
Moments later, the male becomes
groggy (indicated by an unfocused
camera shot) and proceeds to pass
out, at which point the female steals
the plans to the new submarine,
narrowly averting World War 111
Interestingly, capers such as this
have occured since prehistoric
times. For example, a hairy and

hunchbacked cavewoman would be
drinking the blood of a saber
toothed tiger with a muscular and
toothless caveman, when suddenly
the cavewoman would create a
small diversion, such as producing
a rabid mastadon from beneath her
brassiere, and proceed to hit the
caveman over the head with a
boulder.
Moments later, the cavewoman
steals the plans to the new sub
marine, narrowly averting World
War 111.
All seriousness aside, the drugs
used to knock people out are part
of a diverse group known as the
depressants (downers). Basically,
the depressants depress the activity
of the central nervous system, that
part of your brain that looks like
the stem of cauliflower.
Depending on the dosage ad
ministered, a depressant can either
act as a sedative, a hypnotic or an
anesthetic. A sedative makes you
relax; a hypnotic induces sleep; an
anesthetic induces deep, deep
sleep.
The drawback to depressants is
that a dosage that is too high causes
the central nervous system to be
come very, very depressed. Enough
so that your heart decides to stop
beating or your lungs decide to stop
breathing.
This is a medical condition fre
quently described as "death."
For the traditionalists among us,
chloral hydrate is the stuff that was

originally used in knock-out drops.
Unfortunately, chloral hydrate has
a couple of drawbacks: The stuff is
really bitter, and it leaves the victim
with a headache and upset stomach.
The bitterness can be easily corn
batted by putting it in a drink, and
in fact, during the sailor shortage
before the turn of the century,
Seacoast bars were known to serve
"Mickey Finn's," a drink laced with

chloral hydrate. The unsuspecting
drinker would wake up hours later
with a headache and upset stomach
as a crew member on a steamer
bound for China.
Hence the term, "Shanghaied."
However, these are modern
times, and chloral hydrate is out
dated stuff. For one thing, it takes
about 30 minutes to take effect,
and if your roommate is planning

on knocking you out, lets sec if we
can't find something much more
effective:
Ladies and gentlemen, meet the
barbituates! Barbituric acid was
first synthesized by Dr. A. Bayer
(the aspirin dude) and is the com
ponent of some of the niftiest
depressants around. Barbituates


BUG
ME

come in many different strengths,
allowing your roommate to knock
you out for anything from a short
make-out session to some major
dental reconstruction.
Remember, if barbituates are
taken with alcohol the effect is mul
tiplied. Also, if you frequently drug
your roommate, eventually they will
build up a resistance to the bar
bituates, until finally the dosage ne
cessary to put them in La-La Land
becomes fatal.
Please note that it is reasonably
easy to take a fatal overdose of
narcotics, and in no way am I con
doning or recommending the use
of these or any drugs. Remember
that should you give a fatal dosage
of these drugs to your roommate
you would be charged with murder,
and in the state of California mur
derers often serve as many as three
months in prison.
Dear Mr. Bug,
I know a girl who is taking 23
units. What is the maximum number
of units anyone has ever taken? What
were the courses? Who did it?
— Curious
According to the folks at the
registrar's office, nobody has ever

taken more than 24 or 25 units,
and in fact, nobody has even peti
tioned to take any more than that.
This is, of course, a blatant lie.
Thus, I am proud to present The
First Annual Max Units Contest!
Here are the rules: Anyone can
enter. There are two categories, un
dergraduate and graduate. Simply
send documented proof (like a copy
of a transcript or some other
official-looking piece of paper) to
the Bug at The Daily, proving that
you (or the person you stole the
transcript from) have taken a huge
number of units any quarter here
at Stanford.
Include your name, phone num
ber and favorite hockey player. If
you haven't taken massive excess
units but know someone who has,
feel free to send that person's name
along, and I'll check it out.
The winner receives the Official
Bug-Me Most Intense Student
Award and will become famous on
these pages, unless he or she wishes
to remain anonymous.
In case of a tie, entrants will be
asked to write a one-word essay on
what the ASSU Council of Presi
dents actually does, if anything.
The winners will be announced
in a few weeks, pending notification
of next of kin. (I'm not kidding.
This is a real contest.) If you are
an intense student, then enter
today!
