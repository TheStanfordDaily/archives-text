# Vendors enjoy weather and wealth
## 
### Shu-mei Wang 
On a nice day, anyone who passes between
Tresidder Union and the Post Office can't
miss the numerous vendors who sell their
wares at small tables or stands.
As a group, they sell a wide variety of
products, from sweaters, exotic jewelry, bags
and flowers to records, T-shirts and wall
hangings.

The vendors enhance the
campus considerably. They
make Stanford more
dynamic and less of an ivory
tower. They connect the
University to the real world
through commerce.

Ed MacNeill, who sells mostly silver
jewelry, said he imports almost 80 percent
of his merchandise from "exotic Asia."
Sylvia Nelson, whose products include
sweaters and wall-hangings, buys her goods
from Central America when she visits her
family there.
Herbert buys his wooden office products,
jewelry and bags from Africa and Mexico.
Nelson said she hopes that purchasing her
goods from El Salvador and Guatemala will

contribute to the economies of both countries.
Le√üoy Herbert explained that he is able
to sell leather bags made of Napa leather at
a "ridiculously low price" because he buys
them from a family business in Tijuana.
The Mexican family makes money, Herbert
makes money, and his customers get a good
deal, he said. "This is what I call a cottage
industry."
According to Tresidder Union's policy
governing White Memorial Plaza, the vendors
are here "in order to provide a pleasant
ambiance" for the whole area.
"(The vendors) enhance the campus con
siderably," said Robert Weiner, a professor
from St. Mary's College visiting the campus
for a day. They make Stanford "more dynamic
and less of an ivory tower. (The vendors)
connect the University to the real world
through commerce," he said.
The vendors agree that they provide a
valuable service to the area, and most said
they enjoy working at Stanford.
"People here are pleasant," Nelson said.
"It's a nice area."
"This is heaven on earth for vendors,"
MacNeill said. Yet, heaven means more than
just nice weather; for the most part, people
at Stanford don't bargain for better prices,
he said.
But, on the downside, they don't buy very
much either.

Ron Applin, one of the many vendors who populate
While Plaza, sells hand-knitted sweaters made from
llama's wool.
said that he was attracted by the
colors of their stands while he
shopped for gifts and a decoration
for his walls. Although he found
the prices to be fair, he didn't buy
anything.
"Today is a slow day," Nelson
said, adding that she had just
started her business a few weeks
earlier.
Herbert, on the other hand, has
been coming to Stanford for two
years now and said he isn't too
concerned with the money he
makes.
He said he keeps coming because
he enjoys meeting people and
traveling. Pointing at his leather
bags, Herbert explained that he
sells them at a low price simply
because he is tired of them.
Although he doesn't depend on
the income from his stand to live,
he said he is still happy with the
fact that it's "profitable" to sell at
Stanford.
