"The Best American Essays
1987," as its title advertizes, is a
volume that purports itself tied to
a specific place and time. However,
although national history and char
acter may well hover about our
minds as we drop into the worlds
brought to expression by these
American essayists, it certainly is
not a rigid backdrop.
Gay Talese, the editor of this
second edition in the series, has
collected pieces that seem less to
share a common starting-point than
a mutual desire to pierce the sur
face of the unexamined, or to push
familiar topics to more daring dis
course.
"The Case of Harry Houdini," by
Daniel Mark Epstein, is a fine ex
ample. This story originally ap
peared in The New Criterion, and
it does much more than chronicle
a fascination with the magician's
gifts.
Epstein examines the social and
political context in which Houdini
performed his miracles, listing the
many challenges and escapes he
performed. The power of the artist
that emerges thus shifts, at first,
from supernatural to revolutionary.
Epstein writes, "He had a message
that he delivered so forcefully that
it goes without mentioning in
theater courses: Humankind cannot
be held in chains.
The European middle class had

reached an impressionable age, and
the meaning of Houdini's theater
was not lost upon them. Nor was
he mistaken by the aristocracy, who
stayed away in droves. The spec
tacle of this American Jew bursting
from chains by dint of ingenuity did
not amuse the rich. They wanted
desperately to demythologize him."

... a sometimes con
curring and sometimes
contradictory group,
they are at the very
least pluralist, and that
is 'American.'

Once set into this political role,
Houdini seems less the slippery il
lusionist than someone whose ac
tions we might actually grasp. Yet,
the injection of spiritual wonder
and lingering questions that Epstein
includes near the end of his essay
causes the old doubts to flood back:
mystic or madman? The writer has
succeeded in provoking us and has
executed the essayist's task ad
mirably — taking a small portion
of the world and working it into
greater significance.
The volume contains many such
pieces, and their voices vary from
the intensely personal to the
restrained third-person and — in
the case of a Tom Wolfe article
from, of all places, Popular Me
chanics — to a slightly wacky third
person.
New Yorker reporter and
humorist Calvin Trillin goes to

small-town, USA, to write up a mur
der story for his "American
Chronicles" series. Once again he
proves himself a master of the sub
tleties of place and human motiva
tion. Drawing a portrait of Em
poria, Kan., he weaves a tale of
adultery, a wayward pastor and
rumors that prove true. Rural wis
dom triumphs; cheers for Poor
Richard.
Novelist and short story writer
Robert Stone dreams a nightmare
of cocaine addiction in America
that slides from the white chalk on
New York City streets to the pages
of Melville's memorable descrip
tions of whiteness in "Moby Dick."
Aspects of the piece are confes
sional, and there are others in which
anger — at the government's ina
bility to handle the crisis, at the
moral emptiness in which many of
today's chidren are forced to grow
up, at the rampant pleasure-seeking
creed in American society —
defines his tone. Stone's transitions
are sometimes awkward, and one
cannot help but read them as ex
pressive form, as confused mean
derings in a drugged cultural map
work. What strikes most forcefully
is that Stone, one of our best prac
titioners of fiction, writes here as
a journalist, choosing a situation
not in the imagination, but in our
own homes.
Columnist, free-lancer and
former think-tank affiliate William
Pfaff takes for his theme the dis
appearance of the independent
scholar in the United States. To
him, the loss of our private intel
ligentsia does not necessarily trans
late into fewer doctorates in our

census polls; his point is that the
university has become the only in
stitution supporting intellectual
thought and that scholars have thus
been siphoned off from mainstream
society and cloistered inside college
walls. Unlike Pfaffs examples of
England and France, the United
States no longer has a widespread
literary culture willing to patronize
small journals and presses, attend
lectures for the specialists or other
wise prop up the often financially
needy world of the professional
scholar.
Pfaffs insight into the declining
cultural situation in the United
States nicely complements a longer
essay by Gregor Von Rezzori about
his strange travels through Nabokov
and the American "Lolitaland." His
entry is a journal of the mind's
impressions as it crosses this con
tinent in search of the spark of a
revered literary text. The road he
takes is a well-traveled one, for his
itinerary falls in the tradition of the

great explorers before him: Huck
Finn, Sal Paradise and Dean
Moriarty, and a certain poodle
named Charley.
On one level, Von Rezzori faith
fully delivers his declared charge;
a wild, wicked old man, he pursues
the perfect American nymphet with
the zest of Yeats chasing Maude
Gonne. But his musings on a
country where the "wow" and "gee"
of his immature heroine prevail,
where the"the total liberation from
the dictates of good taste" exists in
our prize Olympic showcase of Los
Angeles, where the great open
space of the American idea has
shrunk to a kernel of insipidness,
and then exported to refigure
Europe during the years of the Mar
shall reconstruction, gradually take
over his voice.
Von Rezzori writes of the new
American landscape: "For
thousands of miles we traveled from
one such place to another, until in

the end they merged into one big
neutral and abstract hell, what
seemed to be the core of the United
States. We felt its tremendous
growing power, as it developed into
shining megalopolises, the ultimate
unencumbered perversion of the
small town's dream to become a
great city. And we knew that, when
we went home to Tuscany or the
Black Forest, to the Scottish
Lowlands or the Ile-de-France, we
would soon be in Lolitaland again.
Just as we would be there in
Nairobi, or Ankara, or Novosibirsk,
or anywhere else on our globe, es
pecially Tokyo or Hong Kong. It is
the land of the future."
Von Rezzori's vision is harsh,
Pfaffs resigned, Stone's pressing,
Wolfe's comic, Epstein's wondrous
and Trillin's a mixture of nostalgia
and heartlessness. A sometimes
concurring and sometimes contra
dictory group, they are at the very
least pluralist, and that is
"American."
