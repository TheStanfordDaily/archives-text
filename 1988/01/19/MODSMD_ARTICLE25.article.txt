## Band-aids are no cure Earth in need of new health-care plan 
### Ingo Bensch 
As humans discover the many
ways they are damaging the envi
ronment — for instance, acid rain
or ozone depletion — they often
call upon science and technology
for immediate, temporary solutions.
Although quick solutions can be
quite effective in the short term,
this "band-aid" approach may not
be the most prudent in the long run.
An alternate approach to the web
of environmental problems is being
promoted by Steve Rutledge, an
ecology writer and nature photog
rapher who teaches courses at the
Peninsula Conservation Center in
Palo Alto this winter.
Rutledge, who earned a master's
in environmental biology at the
University of Colorado, suggests
that mankind adopt a new perspec
tive toward the environment.
Humans tend to consider them
selves as masters of the planet; na
ture is theirs to conquer and con
trol. However, according to Rut
ledge, this view ignores the fact that
human beings must rely upon many
delicate natural equilibria. Humans
have forgotten that they are a part
of the global ecosystem and very
much dependent upon it.
Human beings currently ap
proach detrimental environmental
side effects of scientific progress
after the fact. Usually, Rutledge
argues, they accidentally discover
the problem, then try to quickly,
although temporarily, fix it before
modifying the responsible scientific
or industrial process. Each new
problem seems to be dealt with in
dividually using this method.
Unified approach
The change in attitude encour

aged by Rutlcdgc would serve to
eliminate some of the inadequacies
of the band-aid or patch-up ap
proach. In his two courses — Meet
the Life of Earth and Global Ecol
ogy and You — Rutledge proposes
a unified and comprehensive ap
proach based on the theory that
our environmental problems tend
to be related to one another and
often to social problems as well.
Environmental problems such as
land degradation, desertification
and species extinction are com
plexly interrelated with one another
and with some of the global social
problems. Rutledge argues that
society's philosophical approach to
the natural environment is the root
cause of many environmental prob
lems.
Religious and secular beliefs that
man is superior to other forms of
life on Earth and should be master
of his environment are responsible
for a potentially dangerous attitude,
according to Rutledge. Coupled
with a very common economic prac
tice of profit-maximization, this at
titude sets the stage for environ
mental problems as well as social
conflicts.
Problems with multinationals
Rutledge points to Kenya's White
Highlands to illustrate this inter
relatedness. Many of these fertile
lands are owned by multinational
corporations that use them to grow
tea for export.
Multinationals indirectly force
the indigenous populations to try
to live off of marginal and very
sensitive lands that quickly are
degraded from overuse. This
overuse adds to the land loss due
to desertification, which already

rcachcs up to 200 square miles per
day.
Rutledge points out that the
White Highlands phenomenon,
which can be attributed to the com
bination of profit maximization and
man's attitude toward his environ
ment, is repeated throughout
Africa.
The environmental losses in
Kenya directly contribute to social
problems, according to Rutledge.
After degradation takes place in
areas like the White Highlands, the
locals are forced to move, often
flocking to refugee camps in already
overcrowded cities. Although these
native cultures are adept at
nomadic lifestyles, they have no
skills they can apply in their new
urban settings. With no arable land
to work and little chance of getting
jobs, the refugees have little hope
of ever leaving the camps.
The extent of this overcrowding
is exemplified by the urban growth
in Mauritania. Before 1965, the
majority of that country's popula
tion lived in rural ares. Today, 85
percent of the people live in cities.
Most of this increase came in the
form of refugees.
Foreign land ownership that
leads to overuse of sensitive areas
also minimizes African national
food production. The most fertile
lands continue to be used for ex
port, while the marginal lands are
briefly overused and then become
useless. With the decline in arable
land, potential food production
decreases and starvation rises. One
third of all Africans already go
hungry, according to Rutledge.
In addition, the direct depen
dence of the natives and national
economies on a decreasing amount
of fertile land can spur tribal and

political land disputes.
Increase in extinction rate
The displacement of populations
onto sensitive lands and the at
tempted use and overuse of such
fragile areas in tropical rain forests
has led to the complete disap
pearance of many species. Since the
emergence of man's ability to ma
nipulate his environment the rate
of extinction of species has in
creased from about one every 1000
years to near one every hour, ac

cording to Rutledge.
The degradation of rain forests
contributes significantly to the in
creasing rate of extinction. While
rain forests cover less than 10 per
cent of the Earth's surface, they
contain about half of the species,
some of which are unique to an
area of a few square miles.
Rutledge argues that the rapid
rate of extinction of animal and
plant species is one of the "major
problems" man faces today. The
rate of extinction is already disturb
ing, and it continues to grow ex

ponentially. Some estimates state
that one-third of all species could
vanish in the next 50 years.
Although about 3 million species
have been cataloged, and the actual
number is over 10 million, Rutledge
classifies the loss of a species every
hour as serious. There is a delicate
balance in nature between
predators and prey, herbivores and
plants and other species classes.
The loss of some species could
severely upset this balance, and thus
