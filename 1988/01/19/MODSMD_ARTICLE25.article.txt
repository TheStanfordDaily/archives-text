## Band-aids are no cure Earth in need of new health-care plan 
### Ingo Bensch 
As humans discover the many
ways they are damaging the envi
ronment — for instance, acid rain
or ozone depletion — they often
call upon science and technology
for immediate, temporary solutions.
Although quick solutions can be
quite effective in the short term,
this "band-aid" approach may not
be the most prudent in the long run.
An alternate approach to the web
of environmental problems is being
promoted by Steve Rutledge, an
ecology writer and nature photog
rapher who teaches courses at the
Peninsula Conservation Center in
Palo Alto this winter.
Rutledge, who earned a master's
in environmental biology at the
University of Colorado, suggests
that mankind adopt a new perspec
tive toward the environment.
Humans tend to consider them
selves as masters of the planet; na
ture is theirs to conquer and con
trol. However, according to Rut
ledge, this view ignores the fact that
human beings must rely upon many
delicate natural equilibria. Humans
have forgotten that they are a part
of the global ecosystem and very
much dependent upon it.
Human beings currently ap
proach detrimental environmental
side effects of scientific progress
after the fact. Usually, Rutledge
argues, they accidentally discover
the problem, then try to quickly,
although temporarily, fix it before
modifying the responsible scientific
or industrial process. Each new
problem seems to be dealt with in
dividually using this method.
Unified approach
The change in attitude encour

aged by Rutlcdgc would serve to
eliminate some of the inadequacies
of the band-aid or patch-up ap
proach. In his two courses — Meet
the Life of Earth and Global Ecol
ogy and You — Rutledge proposes
a unified and comprehensive ap
proach based on the theory that
our environmental problems tend
to be related to one another and
often to social problems as well.
Environmental problems such as
land degradation, desertification
and species extinction are com
plexly interrelated with one another
and with some of the global social
problems. Rutledge argues that
society's philosophical approach to
the natural environment is the root
cause of many environmental prob
lems.
Religious and secular beliefs that
man is superior to other forms of
life on Earth and should be master
of his environment are responsible
for a potentially dangerous attitude,
according to Rutledge. Coupled
with a very common economic prac
tice of profit-maximization, this at
titude sets the stage for environ
mental problems as well as social
conflicts.
Problems with multinationals
Rutledge points to Kenya's White
Highlands to illustrate this inter
relatedness. Many of these fertile
lands are owned by multinational
corporations that use them to grow
tea for export.
Multinationals indirectly force
the indigenous populations to try
to live off of marginal and very
sensitive lands that quickly are
degraded from overuse. This
overuse adds to the land loss due
to desertification, which already

rcachcs up to 200 square miles per
day.
Rutledge points out that the
White Highlands phenomenon,
which can be attributed to the com
bination of profit maximization and
man's attitude toward his environ
ment, is repeated throughout
Africa.
The environmental losses in
Kenya directly contribute to social
problems, according to Rutledge.
After degradation takes place in
areas like the White Highlands, the
locals are forced to move, often
flocking to refugee camps in already
overcrowded cities. Although these
native cultures are adept at
nomadic lifestyles, they have no
skills they can apply in their new
urban settings. With no arable land
to work and little chance of getting
jobs, the refugees have little hope
of ever leaving the camps.
The extent of this overcrowding
is exemplified by the urban growth
in Mauritania. Before 1965, the
majority of that country's popula
tion lived in rural ares. Today, 85
percent of the people live in cities.
Most of this increase came in the
form of refugees.
Foreign land ownership that
leads to overuse of sensitive areas
also minimizes African national
food production. The most fertile
lands continue to be used for ex
port, while the marginal lands are
briefly overused and then become
useless. With the decline in arable
land, potential food production
decreases and starvation rises. One
third of all Africans already go
hungry, according to Rutledge.
In addition, the direct depen
dence of the natives and national
economies on a decreasing amount
of fertile land can spur tribal and

political land disputes.
Increase in extinction rate
The displacement of populations
onto sensitive lands and the at
tempted use and overuse of such
fragile areas in tropical rain forests
has led to the complete disap
pearance of many species. Since the
emergence of man's ability to ma
nipulate his environment the rate
of extinction of species has in
creased from about one every 1000
years to near one every hour, ac

cording to Rutledge.
The degradation of rain forests
contributes significantly to the in
creasing rate of extinction. While
rain forests cover less than 10 per
cent of the Earth's surface, they
contain about half of the species,
some of which are unique to an
area of a few square miles.
Rutledge argues that the rapid
rate of extinction of animal and
plant species is one of the "major
problems" man faces today. The
rate of extinction is already disturb
ing, and it continues to grow ex

ponentially. Some estimates state
that one-third of all species could
vanish in the next 50 years.
Although about 3 million species
have been cataloged, and the actual
number is over 10 million, Rutledge
classifies the loss of a species every
hour as serious. There is a delicate
balance in nature between
predators and prey, herbivores and
plants and other species classes.
The loss of some species could
severely upset this balance, and thus

the food chain globally, causing
even greater problems in local
ecosystems.
Importance of rain forests
Many of the plants in the rain
forests may contain compounds of
great medical use, Rutledge ex
plains. At present, the populations
of the jungles have the best under
standing of the uses of the many
varieties of herbs and plants found
in the forests. But Western scien
tists and doctors are rapidly gaining
new insights.
Vinblastine and vincristine, found
in the rosy periwinkle in the rain
forests of Madagascar, have become
important drugs in the fight against
childhood leukemia. In fact, they
make up the main treatment for
the disease.
Many other plants that have not
yet been discovered may have ben
eficial implications for medicine,
but these species may well be lost

to extinction.
As scientific and technological
advancements give us increased
control over the environment and
promote continued industrializa
tion, many serious environmental
problems can ensue.
There is often a long gap between
the beginning of an environmental
problem and the implementation of
a cure. This is due partially to the
delay in the discovery of any adverse
side effects and partially to the na
ture of our economic system.
Capitalists, eager to realize a
profit, often engage in impulsive,
large-scale use or production of new
inventions that may cause harmful
side effects that are not detected
for many years, Rutledge argues.
For instance, the use of a cancer
causing material may continue for
30 years before the resulting cancer
cases are diagnosed and traced to
their cause.
The evolution of coal-burning
plants presents another interesting
example. The invention of the in
candescent lamp in 1879 created a
fast-growing demand for electric
power. By World War 11, the proc
ess of thermal generation (the bur

ning of fossil fuels like coal to drive
generators) had been sufficiently
developed so that coal-burning was
responsible for half of the electricity
produced in the United States.
It was not until the 1960s that
people became alarmed about the
possible effects of sulfur- and
nitrogen-oxide emissions, and sci
entists are still gathering data to
better understand the relationship
between sulfur dioxide emissions,
acid rain and related problems.
Recognizing problems
Human beings often take half a
century to recognize technological
causes of environmental degrada
tion, and even after the discovery
of the side effect, there is argument
concerning the extent of damage
and its exact causes, Rutledge
points out.
By the time enough evidence has
been gathered to implicate the
damaging process, it is so deeply
integrated into the economy that it
is practically impossible to elimi
nate.

plants do not solve the problem.
After several more years of re
search, more permanent solutions
are being found. For example, two
more efficient, less costly and more
environmentally sound coal-burning
processes — fluidized-bed combus
tion and coal gasification — are
being perfected and should be

slowly introduced into industry over
the next few decades.
However, according to Rutledge,
the current process is long and al
lows damaging processes to con
tinue.

and with some of the global social
problems. Rutledge argues that
society's philosophical approach to
the natural environment is the root
cause of many environmental prob
lems.
Religious and secular beliefs that
man is superior to other forms of
life on Earth and should be master
of his environment are responsible
for a potentially dangerous attitude,
according to Rutledge. Coupled
with a very common economic prac
tice of profit-maximization, this at
titude sets the stage for environ
mental problems as well as social
conflicts.
Problems with multinationals
Rutledge points to Kenya's White
Highlands to illustrate this inter
relatedness. Many of these fertile
lands are owned by multinational
corporations that use them to grow
tea for export.
Multinationals indirectly force
the indigenous populations to try
to live off of marginal and very
sensitive lands that quickly are
degraded from overuse. This
overuse adds to the land loss due
to desertification, which already

rcachcs up to 200 square miles per
day.
Rutledge points out that the
White Highlands phenomenon,
which can be attributed to the com
bination of profit maximization and
man's attitude toward his environ
ment, is repeated throughout
Africa.
The environmental losses in
Kenya directly contribute to social
problems, according to Rutledge.
After degradation takes place in
areas like the White Highlands, the
locals are forced to move, often
flocking to refugee camps in already
overcrowded cities. Although these
native cultures are adept at
nomadic lifestyles, they have no
skills they can apply in their new
urban settings. With no arable land
to work and little chance of getting
jobs, the refugees have little hope
of ever leaving the camps.
The extent of this overcrowding
is exemplified by the urban growth
in Mauritania. Before 1965, the
majority of that country's popula
tion lived in rural ares. Today, 85
percent of the people live in cities.
Most of this increase came in the
form of refugees.
Foreign land ownership that
leads to overuse of sensitive areas
also minimizes African national
food production. The most fertile
lands continue to be used for ex
port, while the marginal lands are
briefly overused and then become
useless. With the decline in arable
land, potential food production
decreases and starvation rises. One
third of all Africans already go
hungry, according to Rutledge.
In addition, the direct depen
dence of the natives and national
economies on a decreasing amount
of fertile land can spur tribal and

political land disputes.
Increase in extinction rate
The displacement of populations
onto sensitive lands and the at
tempted use and overuse of such
fragile areas in tropical rain forests
has led to the complete disap
pearance of many species. Since the
emergence of man's ability to ma
nipulate his environment the rate
of extinction of species has in
creased from about one every 1000
years to near one every hour, ac

cording to Rutledge.
The degradation of rain forests
contributes significantly to the in
creasing rate of extinction. While
rain forests cover less than 10 per
cent of the Earth's surface, they
contain about half of the species,
some of which are unique to an
area of a few square miles.
Rutledge argues that the rapid
rate of extinction of animal and
plant species is one of the "major
problems" man faces today. The
rate of extinction is already disturb
ing, and it continues to grow ex

ponentially. Some estimates state
that one-third of all species could
vanish in the next 50 years.
Although about 3 million species
have been cataloged, and the actual
number is over 10 million, Rutledge
classifies the loss of a species every
hour as serious. There is a delicate
balance in nature between
predators and prey, herbivores and
plants and other species classes.
The loss of some species could
severely upset this balance, and thus

the food chain globally, causing
even greater problems in local
ecosystems.
Importance of rain forests
Many of the plants in the rain
forests may contain compounds of
great medical use, Rutledge ex
plains. At present, the populations
of the jungles have the best under
standing of the uses of the many
varieties of herbs and plants found
in the forests. But Western scien
tists and doctors are rapidly gaining
new insights.
Vinblastine and vincristine, found
in the rosy periwinkle in the rain
forests of Madagascar, have become
important drugs in the fight against
childhood leukemia. In fact, they
make up the main treatment for
the disease.
Many other plants that have not
yet been discovered may have ben
eficial implications for medicine,
but these species may well be lost

to extinction.
As scientific and technological
advancements give us increased
control over the environment and
promote continued industrializa
tion, many serious environmental
problems can ensue.
There is often a long gap between
the beginning of an environmental
problem and the implementation of
a cure. This is due partially to the
delay in the discovery of any adverse
side effects and partially to the na
ture of our economic system.
Capitalists, eager to realize a
profit, often engage in impulsive,
large-scale use or production of new
inventions that may cause harmful
side effects that are not detected
for many years, Rutledge argues.
For instance, the use of a cancer
causing material may continue for
30 years before the resulting cancer
cases are diagnosed and traced to
their cause.
The evolution of coal-burning
plants presents another interesting
example. The invention of the in
candescent lamp in 1879 created a
fast-growing demand for electric
power. By World War 11, the proc
ess of thermal generation (the bur

ning of fossil fuels like coal to drive
generators) had been sufficiently
developed so that coal-burning was
responsible for half of the electricity
produced in the United States.
It was not until the 1960s that
people became alarmed about the
possible effects of sulfur- and
nitrogen-oxide emissions, and sci
entists are still gathering data to
better understand the relationship
between sulfur dioxide emissions,
acid rain and related problems.
Recognizing problems
Human beings often take half a
century to recognize technological
causes of environmental degrada
tion, and even after the discovery
of the side effect, there is argument
concerning the extent of damage
and its exact causes, Rutledge
points out.
By the time enough evidence has
been gathered to implicate the
damaging process, it is so deeply
integrated into the economy that it
is practically impossible to elimi
nate.

After several more years of re

more efficient, less costly and more
environmentally sound coal-burning
processes — fluidized-bed combus

the next few decades.
However, according to Rutledge,

lows damaging processes to con
tinue.

As humans discover the many
ways they are damaging the envi
ronment — for instance, acid rain
or ozone depletion — they often
call upon science and technology
for immediate, temporary solutions.
Although quick solutions can be
quite effective in the short term,
this "band-aid" approach may not
be the most prudent in the long run.
An alternate approach to the web
of environmental problems is being
promoted by Steve Rutledge, an
ecology writer and nature photog
rapher who teaches courses at the
Peninsula Conservation Center in
Palo Alto this winter.
Rutledge, who earned a master's
in environmental biology at the
University of Colorado, suggests
that mankind adopt a new perspec
tive toward the environment.
Humans tend to consider them
selves as masters of the planet; na
ture is theirs to conquer and con
trol. However, according to Rut
ledge, this view ignores the fact that
human beings must rely upon many
delicate natural equilibria. Humans
have forgotten that they are a part
of the global ecosystem and very
much dependent upon it.
Human beings currently ap
proach detrimental environmental
side effects of scientific progress
after the fact. Usually, Rutledge
argues, they accidentally discover
the problem, then try to quickly,
although temporarily, fix it before
modifying the responsible scientific
or industrial process. Each new
problem seems to be dealt with in
dividually using this method.
Unified approach
The change in attitude encour

aged by Rutlcdgc would serve to
eliminate some of the inadequacies
of the band-aid or patch-up ap
proach. In his two courses — Meet
the Life of Earth and Global Ecol
ogy and You — Rutledge proposes
a unified and comprehensive ap
proach based on the theory that
our environmental problems tend
to be related to one another and
often to social problems as well.

form of refugees.
Foreign land ownership that
leads to overuse of sensitive areas
also minimizes African national
food production. The most fertile
lands continue to be used for ex
port, while the marginal lands are
briefly overused and then become
useless. With the decline in arable
land, potential food production
decreases and starvation rises. One
third of all Africans already go
hungry, according to Rutledge.
In addition, the direct depen
dence of the natives and national
economies on a decreasing amount
of fertile land can spur tribal and

political land disputes.
Increase in extinction rate
The displacement of populations
onto sensitive lands and the at
tempted use and overuse of such
fragile areas in tropical rain forests
has led to the complete disap
pearance of many species. Since the
emergence of man's ability to ma
nipulate his environment the rate
of extinction of species has in
creased from about one every 1000
years to near one every hour, ac

cording to Rutledge.
The degradation of rain forests
contributes significantly to the in
creasing rate of extinction. While
rain forests cover less than 10 per
cent of the Earth's surface, they
contain about half of the species,
some of which are unique to an
area of a few square miles.
Rutledge argues that the rapid
rate of extinction of animal and
plant species is one of the "major
problems" man faces today. The
rate of extinction is already disturb
ing, and it continues to grow ex

ponentially. Some estimates state
that one-third of all species could
vanish in the next 50 years.
Although about 3 million species
have been cataloged, and the actual
number is over 10 million, Rutledge
classifies the loss of a species every
hour as serious. There is a delicate
balance in nature between
predators and prey, herbivores and
plants and other species classes.
The loss of some species could
severely upset this balance, and thus

the food chain globally, causing
even greater problems in local
ecosystems.
Importance of rain forests
Many of the plants in the rain
forests may contain compounds of
great medical use, Rutledge ex
plains. At present, the populations
of the jungles have the best under
standing of the uses of the many
varieties of herbs and plants found
in the forests. But Western scien
tists and doctors are rapidly gaining
new insights.
Vinblastine and vincristine, found
in the rosy periwinkle in the rain
forests of Madagascar, have become
important drugs in the fight against
childhood leukemia. In fact, they
make up the main treatment for
the disease.
Many other plants that have not
yet been discovered may have ben
eficial implications for medicine,
but these species may well be lost

to extinction.
As scientific and technological
advancements give us increased
control over the environment and
promote continued industrializa
tion, many serious environmental
problems can ensue.
There is often a long gap between
the beginning of an environmental
problem and the implementation of
a cure. This is due partially to the
delay in the discovery of any adverse
side effects and partially to the na
ture of our economic system.
Capitalists, eager to realize a
profit, often engage in impulsive,
large-scale use or production of new
inventions that may cause harmful
side effects that are not detected
for many years, Rutledge argues.
For instance, the use of a cancer
causing material may continue for
30 years before the resulting cancer
cases are diagnosed and traced to
their cause.
The evolution of coal-burning
plants presents another interesting
example. The invention of the in
candescent lamp in 1879 created a
fast-growing demand for electric
power. By World War 11, the proc
ess of thermal generation (the bur

ning of fossil fuels like coal to drive
generators) had been sufficiently
developed so that coal-burning was
responsible for half of the electricity
produced in the United States.
It was not until the 1960s that
people became alarmed about the
possible effects of sulfur- and
nitrogen-oxide emissions, and sci
entists are still gathering data to
better understand the relationship
between sulfur dioxide emissions,
acid rain and related problems.
Recognizing problems
Human beings often take half a
century to recognize technological
causes of environmental degrada
tion, and even after the discovery
of the side effect, there is argument
concerning the extent of damage
and its exact causes, Rutledge
points out.
By the time enough evidence has
been gathered to implicate the
damaging process, it is so deeply
integrated into the economy that it
is practically impossible to elimi
nate.

sulfur oxides in the coal-burning
plants do not solve the problem.
After several more years of re
search, more permanent solutions
are being found. For example, two
more efficient, less costly and more
environmentally sound coal-burning
processes — fluidized-bed combus
tion and coal gasification — are
being perfected and should be

slowly introduced into industry over
the next few decades.
However, according to Rutledge,
the current process is long and al
lows damaging processes to con
tinue.

As humans discover the many
ways they are damaging the envi
ronment — for instance, acid rain
or ozone depletion — they often
call upon science and technology
for immediate, temporary solutions.
Although quick solutions can be
quite effective in the short term,
this "band-aid" approach may not
be the most prudent in the long run.
An alternate approach to the web
of environmental problems is being
promoted by Steve Rutledge, an
ecology writer and nature photog
rapher who teaches courses at the
Peninsula Conservation Center in
Palo Alto this winter.
Rutledge, who earned a master's
in environmental biology at the
University of Colorado, suggests
that mankind adopt a new perspec
tive toward the environment.
Humans tend to consider them
selves as masters of the planet; na
ture is theirs to conquer and con
trol. However, according to Rut
ledge, this view ignores the fact that
human beings must rely upon many
delicate natural equilibria. Humans
have forgotten that they are a part
of the global ecosystem and very
much dependent upon it.
Human beings currently ap
proach detrimental environmental
side effects of scientific progress
after the fact. Usually, Rutledge
argues, they accidentally discover
the problem, then try to quickly,
although temporarily, fix it before
modifying the responsible scientific
or industrial process. Each new
problem seems to be dealt with in
dividually using this method.
Unified approach
The change in attitude encour

aged by Rutlcdgc would serve to
eliminate some of the inadequacies
of the band-aid or patch-up ap
proach. In his two courses — Meet
the Life of Earth and Global Ecol
ogy and You — Rutledge proposes
a unified and comprehensive ap
proach based on the theory that
our environmental problems tend
to be related to one another and
often to social problems as well.
Environmental problems such as
land degradation, desertification
and species extinction are com
plexly interrelated with one another
and with some of the global social
problems. Rutledge argues that
society's philosophical approach to
the natural environment is the root
cause of many environmental prob
lems.
Religious and secular beliefs that
man is superior to other forms of
life on Earth and should be master
of his environment are responsible
for a potentially dangerous attitude,
according to Rutledge. Coupled
with a very common economic prac
tice of profit-maximization, this at
titude sets the stage for environ
mental problems as well as social
conflicts.
Problems with multinationals
Rutledge points to Kenya's White
Highlands to illustrate this inter
relatedness. Many of these fertile
lands are owned by multinational
corporations that use them to grow
tea for export.
Multinationals indirectly force
the indigenous populations to try
to live off of marginal and very
sensitive lands that quickly are
degraded from overuse. This
overuse adds to the land loss due
to desertification, which already

rcachcs up to 200 square miles per
day.
Rutledge points out that the
White Highlands phenomenon,
which can be attributed to the com
bination of profit maximization and
man's attitude toward his environ
ment, is repeated throughout
Africa.
The environmental losses in
Kenya directly contribute to social
problems, according to Rutledge.
After degradation takes place in
areas like the White Highlands, the
locals are forced to move, often
flocking to refugee camps in already
overcrowded cities. Although these
native cultures are adept at
nomadic lifestyles, they have no
skills they can apply in their new
urban settings. With no arable land
to work and little chance of getting
jobs, the refugees have little hope
of ever leaving the camps.
The extent of this overcrowding
is exemplified by the urban growth
in Mauritania. Before 1965, the
majority of that country's popula
tion lived in rural ares. Today, 85
percent of the people live in cities.
Most of this increase came in the
form of refugees.
Foreign land ownership that
leads to overuse of sensitive areas
also minimizes African national
food production. The most fertile
lands continue to be used for ex
port, while the marginal lands are
briefly overused and then become
useless. With the decline in arable
land, potential food production
decreases and starvation rises. One
third of all Africans already go
hungry, according to Rutledge.
In addition, the direct depen
dence of the natives and national
economies on a decreasing amount
of fertile land can spur tribal and

political land disputes.
