## Cougars shock cold-shooting Cardinal 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
On paper, the more talented Cardinal should not
have had much problem beating Washington State.
Going strictly by the numbers, David Sanders, the
Cougars' redshirt sophomore guard with an 11.8
scoring average, could never have been expected to
score 32 points, including a 7-for-ll performance from
the 3-point line.
But Saturday night in Maples Pavilion a pesky
Cougar squad, behind from the opening minute of the
game, rallied just in the nick of time to beat Stanford
70-68 in overtime on a 25-foot shot by Sanders. The
loss dropped the Cardinal to 3-3 (11-6 overall) and
sixth place in the Pacific 10 Conference, while the
Cougars moved ahead to fifth place at 3-2 (6-6 overall).
The Cougars game plan had been to keep the score
as low as possible. "At halftime we thought that if
we could keep it in the low 60s, we could win,"
Washington State Coach Kelvin Sampson said after
the game.
To do that the Cougars ran a controlled offense
designed to give outside shots to Sanders and his
backcourt mate Brian Wright. On defense Washington
State tried to neutralize Stanford's superior big men
with a zone.
It was a well-planned strategy, but it wouldn't have
worked if the Cardinal hadn't had an inexplicably
dismal shooting night. Two nights earlier against Wash
ington, Stanford tore apart a similar zone by shooting
63 percent from the field.
Saturday the same shots were there, but they simply
weren't going down. For the night Stanford shot only
48 percent, and the Cardinal made just 13 of 32 field
goal attempts (40 percent) in the second half. Only
three Cardinal players reached double figures, with
Todd Lichti and Greg Butler each scoring 16 points
and Howard Wright contributing 10.

The lack of scoring also worked
to neutralize a decisive Stanford
rebounding advantage, 42-23.
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery, satisfied with his team's
shot selection, said, "It wasn't pres
sure. It was just that the ball
wouldn't go down. I don't know
how to explain that."
According to Cardinal point
guard Terry Taylor, who was an
uncharacteristic l-of-7 from the
field, "It was just one of those
nights. We missed a lot of shots
that we usually make."
With 10:47 left in regulation, the
Cardinal was up by 12 at 52-40.
But the Cougars whittled away the
lead to 63-61 with just under two
minutes to go. With the game on
the line, the 6-foot-2 Sanders, a
thorn in the Cardinal's side all
night, snuck into the key, grabbed
a rebound and was fouled by Stan
ford's Stuart Thomas.
Sanders hit both ends of a one
and-one to send the game into over
time. Typical of the game, the Car
dinal finished regulation by going
scoreless for the last two-and-a-half
minutes.

In overtime Thomas, a 6-7 for
ward, was given the unenviable task
of guarding the smaller, quicker
Sanders. Starting forward Brian
McSweeney had done a good job
on Sanders during regulation, but
he fouled out in trying to fight
through pick after double-pick de
signed to spring the guard.
Nearly three minutes into the
five-minute overtime, it was
Sanders again — this time hitting
an 18-footer to put Washington
State up 65-63. Lichti answered
with two free throws to tie the score.
The Cougars' Neil Evans and
Stanford's Wright traded baskets to
keep the score even, and with 42
seconds left Wright made one of
two free throws to put the Cardinal
up 68-67. The Cougars took the
ball downcourt where it ended up,
once again, in the uncanny hands
of Sanders.
With Thomas on him, Sanders
pulled up quickly and nailed a shot
from 25 feet (his seventh in 11 3-
point attempts) to give the Cougars
a two-point advantage. "That kid
(Thomas) was on him," Sampson
said, "but he was three feet off.
Sanders gets his shot off so quick
that it only takes a couple of feet."
"The kid was hot, and he can
score. Wc just went to the well with
him."

him."
On paper, the more talented Cardinal should not
have had much problem beating Washington State.
Going strictly by the numbers, David Sanders, the
Cougars' redshirt sophomore guard with an 11.8
scoring average, could never have been expected to
score 32 points, including a 7-for-ll performance from
the 3-point line.
But Saturday night in Maples Pavilion a pesky
Cougar squad, behind from the opening minute of the
game, rallied just in the nick of time to beat Stanford
70-68 in overtime on a 25-foot shot by Sanders. The
loss dropped the Cardinal to 3-3 (11-6 overall) and
sixth place in the Pacific 10 Conference, while the
Cougars moved ahead to fifth place at 3-2 (6-6 overall).
The Cougars game plan had been to keep the score
as low as possible. "At halftime we thought that if
we could keep it in the low 60s, we could win,"
Washington State Coach Kelvin Sampson said after
the game.
To do that the Cougars ran a controlled offense
designed to give outside shots to Sanders and his
backcourt mate Brian Wright. On defense Washington
State tried to neutralize Stanford's superior big men
with a zone.
It was a well-planned strategy, but it wouldn't have
worked if the Cardinal hadn't had an inexplicably
dismal shooting night. Two nights earlier against Wash
ington, Stanford tore apart a similar zone by shooting
63 percent from the field.
Saturday the same shots were there, but they simply
weren't going down. For the night Stanford shot only
48 percent, and the Cardinal made just 13 of 32 field
goal attempts (40 percent) in the second half. Only
three Cardinal players reached double figures, with
Todd Lichti and Greg Butler each scoring 16 points
and Howard Wright contributing 10.

The lack of scoring also worked
to neutralize a decisive Stanford
rebounding advantage, 42-23.
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery, satisfied with his team's
shot selection, said, "It wasn't pres
sure. It was just that the ball
wouldn't go down. I don't know
how to explain that."
According to Cardinal point
guard Terry Taylor, who was an
uncharacteristic l-of-7 from the
field, "It was just one of those
nights. We missed a lot of shots
that we usually make."
With 10:47 left in regulation, the
Cardinal was up by 12 at 52-40.
But the Cougars whittled away the
lead to 63-61 with just under two
minutes to go. With the game on
the line, the 6-foot-2 Sanders, a
thorn in the Cardinal's side all
night, snuck into the key, grabbed
a rebound and was fouled by Stan
ford's Stuart Thomas.
Sanders hit both ends of a one
and-one to send the game into over
time. Typical of the game, the Car
dinal finished regulation by going
scoreless for the last two-and-a-half
minutes.

In overtime Thomas, a 6-7 for
ward, was given the unenviable task
of guarding the smaller, quicker
Sanders. Starting forward Brian
McSweeney had done a good job
on Sanders during regulation, but
he fouled out in trying to fight
through pick after double-pick de
signed to spring the guard.
Nearly three minutes into the
five-minute overtime, it was
Sanders again — this time hitting
an 18-footer to put Washington
State up 65-63. Lichti answered
with two free throws to tie the score.
The Cougars' Neil Evans and
Stanford's Wright traded baskets to
keep the score even, and with 42
seconds left Wright made one of
two free throws to put the Cardinal
up 68-67. The Cougars took the
ball downcourt where it ended up,
once again, in the uncanny hands
of Sanders.
With Thomas on him, Sanders
pulled up quickly and nailed a shot
from 25 feet (his seventh in 11 3-
point attempts) to give the Cougars
a two-point advantage. "That kid
(Thomas) was on him," Sampson
said, "but he was three feet off.
Sanders gets his shot off so quick
that it only takes a couple of feet."
"The kid was hot, and he can
score. Wc just went to the well with
him."
