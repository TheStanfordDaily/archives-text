## Cougars shock cold-shooting Cardinal 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
On paper, the more talented Cardinal should not
have had much problem beating Washington State.
Going strictly by the numbers, David Sanders, the
Cougars' redshirt sophomore guard with an 11.8
scoring average, could never have been expected to
score 32 points, including a 7-for-ll performance from
the 3-point line.
But Saturday night in Maples Pavilion a pesky
Cougar squad, behind from the opening minute of the
game, rallied just in the nick of time to beat Stanford
70-68 in overtime on a 25-foot shot by Sanders. The
loss dropped the Cardinal to 3-3 (11-6 overall) and
sixth place in the Pacific 10 Conference, while the
Cougars moved ahead to fifth place at 3-2 (6-6 overall).
The Cougars game plan had been to keep the score
as low as possible. "At halftime we thought that if
we could keep it in the low 60s, we could win,"
Washington State Coach Kelvin Sampson said after
the game.
To do that the Cougars ran a controlled offense
designed to give outside shots to Sanders and his
backcourt mate Brian Wright. On defense Washington
State tried to neutralize Stanford's superior big men
with a zone.
It was a well-planned strategy, but it wouldn't have
worked if the Cardinal hadn't had an inexplicably
dismal shooting night. Two nights earlier against Wash
ington, Stanford tore apart a similar zone by shooting
63 percent from the field.
Saturday the same shots were there, but they simply
weren't going down. For the night Stanford shot only
48 percent, and the Cardinal made just 13 of 32 field
goal attempts (40 percent) in the second half. Only
three Cardinal players reached double figures, with
Todd Lichti and Greg Butler each scoring 16 points
and Howard Wright contributing 10.
