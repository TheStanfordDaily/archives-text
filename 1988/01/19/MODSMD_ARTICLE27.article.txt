# Sanders on fire

Anyone who saw Washington
State guard David Sanders' 32-
point performance against Stan
ford Saturday night would find
it hard to believe that the 6-foot
-2 sophomore hasn't played much
in the previous two seasons.
It's true. In fact, the Stanford
game was only the fifth start of
this season for the Cougar bomb
er, who was in the starting lineup
for the first two Washington
State games but was benched for
seven straight contests before
getting the call against Washing
ton — just two games before the
Cougars faced the Cardinal.
Sanders played just 12 minutes
in the first game of the 1986-87
season and was hospitalized after
the game with double vision and
dizziness. The illness was
diagnosed as a viral infection,
and Sanders spent the remainder
of the year as a medical redshirt.
The previous season, as a fresh
man, Sanders saw very little ac
tion as a backup to All-Pacific
10 Conference guard Keith Mor
rison.
Despite not playing much

since high school, the Spokane
native rose to the occasion
against the Cardinal with 10-of
-20 field-goal shooting, including
7-of-ll from 3-point range, and
a 5-of-6 performance from the
line. The 32 points was a career
high for Sanders, whose previous
best was 24 against Indiana State
in December.
Moreover, Sanders seemed to
be involved in every critical play
of Washington State's dramatic
70-68 overtime win. Not only did
the sophomore launch a 25-
footer with 10 seconds left in
overtime to give the Cougars the
victory, he also hit two free
throws with 1:06 remaining in
regulation to tie the game at
63-63 and send the contest into
an extra period.
Even more remarkable, the
free throws were the result of a
foul Sanders drew while making
a rebound in the lane — despite
standing at least five inches
shorter than the three Stanford
men around the basket.

halftime because we weren't
