# Sanders on fire

### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
Anyone who saw Washington
State guard David Sanders' 32-
point performance against Stan
ford Saturday night would find
it hard to believe that the 6-foot
-2 sophomore hasn't played much
in the previous two seasons.
It's true. In fact, the Stanford
game was only the fifth start of
this season for the Cougar bomb
er, who was in the starting lineup
for the first two Washington
State games but was benched for
seven straight contests before
getting the call against Washing
ton — just two games before the
Cougars faced the Cardinal.
Sanders played just 12 minutes
in the first game of the 1986-87
season and was hospitalized after
the game with double vision and
dizziness. The illness was
diagnosed as a viral infection,
and Sanders spent the remainder
of the year as a medical redshirt.
The previous season, as a fresh
man, Sanders saw very little ac
tion as a backup to All-Pacific
10 Conference guard Keith Mor
rison.
Despite not playing much

since high school, the Spokane
native rose to the occasion
against the Cardinal with 10-of
-20 field-goal shooting, including
7-of-ll from 3-point range, and
a 5-of-6 performance from the
line. The 32 points was a career
high for Sanders, whose previous
best was 24 against Indiana State
in December.
Moreover, Sanders seemed to
be involved in every critical play
of Washington State's dramatic
70-68 overtime win. Not only did
the sophomore launch a 25-
footer with 10 seconds left in
overtime to give the Cougars the
victory, he also hit two free
throws with 1:06 remaining in
regulation to tie the game at
63-63 and send the contest into
an extra period.
Even more remarkable, the
free throws were the result of a
foul Sanders drew while making
a rebound in the lane — despite
standing at least five inches
shorter than the three Stanford
men around the basket.
"We got chewed out at
halftime because we weren't
rebounding," Sanders said. "Coach
said he's never been so embarrassed
about our rebounding. Nobody
blocked me out that time, and I
kind of snuck in there, and the ball
popped out to me."
Sanders was also instrumental in
the momentum shift toward Wash
ington State in the second half.
Stanford held its biggest lead, 52-40,
with 10:08 left to go when Cardinal
point guard Terry Taylor was
whistled for an intentional foul
against Cougar guard Anthony
Kidd. Kidd sank two free throws,
Washington State got the ball back
because of the intentional foul, and
Sanders threw in another 3-pointer
from 24 feet out. The 5-point swing
cut Stanford's lead to 52-45 and
signaled the start of the Cougar
comeback.
Stanford forward Stuart Thomas,
who had the thankless task of
guarding Sanders late in the game,
tried to put his opponent's perform
ance in perspective. "He's got a
really good jumper, and he gets it
off quick," Thomas said. "I think
maybe he's been shooting well this
week, and everyone else (on the
Stanford team) was getting messed
up because of it."
"Basically, we were getting to him
at the end of the game," Thomas
said. "I could get through the picks
fine except for the last shot. But
when you're 7-for-ll from the 3-
point line, that'll get you 21 real
quick."
