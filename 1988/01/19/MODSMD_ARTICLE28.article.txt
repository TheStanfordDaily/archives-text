# James shines in Shrine
## 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
Seventy-one of the nation's top
college football players met in the
63rd annual East-West Shrine
Game before a crowd of 62,000
(76,000 paid attendance) at Stan
ford Stadium Saturday, and the two
representatives from Stanford, run
ning back Brad Muster and wide
receiver Jeff James, gave solid per
formances and probably enhanced
their draft value in the West's 16-13
win.
Yet, despite the large number of
talented football players and the
plethora of professional scouts pres
ent at the all-star game, draft
ratings and the outcome of the con
test were ultimately not really im
portant, for the game is played to
benefit Shriners Hospitals for
crippled and burned children.
"Winning is kind of secondary,"
said Washington quarterback Chris
Chandler, the starting quarterback
for the West squad who led all
passers with 150 yards on 16 com
pletions in 26 attempts. "The kids
arc what this game is all about."
Stanford star Muster echoed
Chandler's sentiments. "I'm here to
have fun and help out the Shriners

Hospitals," Muster said. "I did both
today."
Still, most of the post-game ques
tions centered around individual
performances and the pro draft.
Quarterback Don McPherson, the
runner-up for the Heisman Trophy,
was especially singled out for a sub
par day in which the Syracuse senior
completed just 3 of 17 passes for
60 yards and one touchdown.
"I misfired a few times," said
McPherson, who also ran for 42
yards on six carries. "The scouts in
ths stands didn't bother me, just
the players on the field. It's tough
to get in the groove in all-star games
because of the short amount of
practice time."
Despite limited practice time,
Stanford's James had an excellent
outing, finishing as the second
leading receiver in the game with
four catches for 42 yards. (Wash
ington receiver Darryl Franklin
hauled in six passes for 62 yards
and one touchdown.)
"I certainly didn't hurt my
chances (in the draft)," said James,
who missed the final three games
of the regular season with a pulled
groin muscle. "I know I was a big
question mark after I got hurt. I
hope they (the scouts) saw what

they needed to see this week."
West Offensive Coordinator
Claude Gilbert of San Jose State
certainly saw what he wanted to
see from James. "He's an outstand
ing receiver," Gilbert said. "He's a
very, very talented young man and
a very smart receiver. He has all
the physical tools to be a great one.
I was really happy to be able to
work with him this week, and it
was nice to see him play well in
the game."
The only drawback to the contest
for James was the indignity of
having to wear the West's blue and
gold uniform (similar to rival
California's colors) all week. "I told
(California receiver) Brian Bedford
I was getting sick to my stomach
in all of this blue and gold," James
said.
The only drawback for Muster
was playing fullback rather than his
usual tailback position. The
projected first-round draft pick
spent much of the game blocking
for Offensive Player of the Game
Kenny Jackson of San Jose State,
who picked up 65 yards on 13
carries. Muster, on the other hand,
ran for 15 yards on only three

carries and also caught four passes
for 38 yards.
"I think they (the scouts) saw me
block more than I have in the last
four years," Muster said with a
smile. "But I'm happy with the way
things went. I was catching the ball
and making first downs when they
asked me to. I think I did a good
job when I was in there."
The two Stanford players made

a good impression on their team
mates. "James is a great receiver,"
Chandler said. "I got a feel for him
early in the week. Muster's play
speaks for itself. The first pass I
threw was to him. He's just a great
runner."
"It felt real good to play on the
same team with them, since I've
played against them for two years,"
said San Jose State quarterback
Mike Perez, who completed 8 of
20 passes for 89 yards and one
score. "They're really intelligent
guys, and they picked up the offense
really quickly."
