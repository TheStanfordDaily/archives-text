# Hoops loses first game of year

### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Some days, nothing seems to go
right. Saturday night in front of
4268 fans at Hec Edmundson
Pavilion in Seattle, the No. 10 Stan
ford women's basketball team suf
fered its first loss of the season at
the hands of No. 17 Washington
77-60.
The Cardinal now boasts a 14-1
record and is 3-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference, while the Huskies en
joy a 9-2 mark, 3-0 in league.
"I know we were ready, and we
knew what was coming, but I have
to give credit to their team," Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"Defensively, they did a good job
at pressing our guards and denying
our forwards and fronting our post
people. They got in passing lanes,
and we did not run our offense."
The Husky defensive force took
the Cardinal by surprise. Stanford
accumulated its 14-game win streak
with its heavy-pressure, full-court
play, but the squad couldn't put its
run together with its gun.
"We're used to being the people
who put the pressure on them, but
we were the ones getting it," Van-
Derveer said.
Stanford's trouble began early,
when Washington quickly increased
an 8-4 lead to a 21-6 advantage,
thanks to the fine off-the-bench play
of Aileen McManus. The half
ended with the Huskies ahead 33-
19.
The second half treated the
visitors better, but it was just a case
of too little, too late. "In the second
half we ran our offense better," the
Cardinal coach said. "The first half
was a 14-point game, and the
second half was a three-point game.
Had we been down by three at
halftime and reversed the halves, I
think we would have played much
better in another half."

"They were really in their flow,
and great crowd support had a lot
to do with it," VanDerveer said.
"They were really pumped, playing
in front of the biggest crowd they've
ever had, and they came out really
playing hard."
The attitude blended with ability
to yield the win. McManus hardly
held the monopoly on top perform
ance, as three other players scored
over 10 points, while two others
recorded nine.
"Their two guards did a good job
of putting a lot of pressure on our
guards," VanDerveer said. "Yvette
Cole shot 5-for-7 and did very well
defensively, and their point guard
(Jacki Myers) played very well."
Washington also has Lisa Oriard,
who is proving to be a perennial
problem for the Cardinal. Duplicat
ing her success against Stanford last
season, the Husky senior power for
ward finished the game with 12
points and a team-high 10
rebounds.
Fortunately, Stanford's clutch
player, forward Trisha Stevens, was
in her top form as well. Reminiscent
of her game-winning free throws at
Brigham Young in the first weekend
of the season, the freshman set the
game's standards in both scoring
and rebounding by finishing with
18 points and 12 boards in 35
minutes of play.
"They might have been a little
more concentrated on Jill (Yanke)
and the perimeter people," Stevens
said. That little edge made the dif
ference, allowing her to repeatedly
capitalize on scoring situations.
Another edge, surprisingly
enough, was the crowd support, as
the Husky fans actually motivated
the freshman instead of intimidat
ing her. "Maybe it helped me,"
Stevens said. "I don't care who
they're cheering for; it was like they
