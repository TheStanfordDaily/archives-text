# Fire chief, locals seek role in probe
## Stanford fails to report safety problems 
### Nick Anderson Erin Martin Senior staff writers 
Echoing a demand made Friday by the
Palo Alto fire chief that his department be
allowed to participate in Stanford's probe of
University health and safety conditions, Palo
Alto residents yesterday requested a role in
the investigation of Stanford's use and storage
of hazardous materials.
Both demands stemmed from the recent
formation of a University committee to ex
amine results of a current investigation of
possible legal violations of health and safety
regulations.
In a Dec. 10 letter to University President
Donald Kennedy, Safety Operations Manager
Jon Moldestad charged the University with
waste, mismanagement, unethical behavior
and cover-up in the area of health and safety.
Last week the University hired SRI Inter
national, a Menlo Park consulting firm, to
conduct a review of the allegations and make
recommendations for corrective action.
In a news conference Friday at the Stanford
branch station, Palo Alto Fire Chief Bob
Wall, in addition to demanding that his de
partment be included in the investigation,
complained about the University's failure to
report two campus toxic waste accidents to
the fire department.
The City of Palo Alto currently provides
the University with fire, health and safety
protection.
Wall said he was not informed that the
incinerator at Stanford's Environmental
Safety Facility has a scrubber with chronic
mechanical problems. The scrubber is de
signed to prevent the release of pollutants
and dangerous acids into the atmosphere.
Also, a Dec. 26 arsenic spill in the McCul

lough Building was not reported to the fire
department, Wall said.
But Alain Decleve, Stanford's director of
Health and Safety, yesterday said relations
between his department and the fire depart
ment are good. Decleve said he meets Wall
on a monthly basis to discuss safety.
"Under normal circumstances we commu
nicate very well," said Decleve, who will meet
this week with the chief.
Decleve acknowledged that there is some
confusion between the University and the
fire department about what constitutes a
"reportable" incident. "It's a problem of in
terpretation," he said. "Some people in the
fire department are suspicious of any chemi
cal spill."
According to Decleve, the University has
a two-fold agreement with the fire depart
ment:
• to notify the department immediately if
there are any chemical spills that have the
potential of dangerous releases in the envi
ronment; and
• to make special hazards known to workers
through prominently posted signs.
But area residents feel they should also
be included in any discussion of Stanford's
hazardous waste policies.
"We are very upset," said Susan Covey,
president of the College Terrace Association,
a residents' group representing 400 families
in Palo Alto. "It seems time that Stanford
make information much more available."
"The fire department is the agency called
upon to respond to these sorts of emergen
cies, and they don't even know what's going
on over there," Covey added.
John Joynt, president of the 500-family
Barron Park Association, said members of
