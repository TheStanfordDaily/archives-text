# Fire chief, locals seek role in probe
## Stanford fails to report safety problems 
### Nick Anderson Erin Martin Senior staff writers 
Echoing a demand made Friday by the
Palo Alto fire chief that his department be
allowed to participate in Stanford's probe of
University health and safety conditions, Palo
Alto residents yesterday requested a role in
the investigation of Stanford's use and storage
of hazardous materials.
Both demands stemmed from the recent
formation of a University committee to ex
amine results of a current investigation of
possible legal violations of health and safety
regulations.
In a Dec. 10 letter to University President
Donald Kennedy, Safety Operations Manager
Jon Moldestad charged the University with
waste, mismanagement, unethical behavior
and cover-up in the area of health and safety.
Last week the University hired SRI Inter
national, a Menlo Park consulting firm, to
conduct a review of the allegations and make
recommendations for corrective action.
In a news conference Friday at the Stanford
branch station, Palo Alto Fire Chief Bob
Wall, in addition to demanding that his de
partment be included in the investigation,
complained about the University's failure to
report two campus toxic waste accidents to
the fire department.
The City of Palo Alto currently provides
the University with fire, health and safety
protection.
Wall said he was not informed that the
incinerator at Stanford's Environmental
Safety Facility has a scrubber with chronic
mechanical problems. The scrubber is de
signed to prevent the release of pollutants
and dangerous acids into the atmosphere.
Also, a Dec. 26 arsenic spill in the McCul

lough Building was not reported to the fire
department, Wall said.
But Alain Decleve, Stanford's director of
Health and Safety, yesterday said relations
between his department and the fire depart
ment are good. Decleve said he meets Wall
on a monthly basis to discuss safety.
"Under normal circumstances we commu
nicate very well," said Decleve, who will meet
this week with the chief.
Decleve acknowledged that there is some
confusion between the University and the
fire department about what constitutes a
"reportable" incident. "It's a problem of in
terpretation," he said. "Some people in the
fire department are suspicious of any chemi
cal spill."
According to Decleve, the University has
a two-fold agreement with the fire depart
ment:
• to notify the department immediately if
there are any chemical spills that have the
potential of dangerous releases in the envi
ronment; and
• to make special hazards known to workers
through prominently posted signs.
But area residents feel they should also
be included in any discussion of Stanford's
hazardous waste policies.
"We are very upset," said Susan Covey,
president of the College Terrace Association,
a residents' group representing 400 families
in Palo Alto. "It seems time that Stanford
make information much more available."
"The fire department is the agency called
upon to respond to these sorts of emergen
cies, and they don't even know what's going
on over there," Covey added.
John Joynt, president of the 500-family
Barron Park Association, said members of
his residents' group were also dis
mayed with Stanford's unwilling
ness to release information to
citizens.
"My heart bleeds for [Chief Wal
-I]. We have been experiencing this
communication gap for over a year
now," he said.
According to Covey and Joynt,
Palo Alto residents legally have the
right to know this information
through Palo Alto ordinance Title
17 and also through the federal the
Superfund Act.
Both residents are also members
of the Hazardous Materials Coor
dinating Committee (HMCC), a
panel chaired by Wall and staffed
with representatives from both
Stanford and Palo Alto. It is de
signed to serve as a channel of
information on toxic chemical use
in this area.
Joynt, along with HMCC and
Barron Park member Inge Harding-
Barlowe, expressed concern about
Stanford's HMCC representatives.
"They have contributed very little
to HMCC meetings in over a year,"
Joynt said.
Managing Director Zera Murphy
and Lands Manager Paula
Kakimoto, of the department of
Real Estate and Lands Manage

ment, are the University's repre
sentatives to the committee.
Kakimoto and Murphy were un
available for comment last night.
During a Dec. 17 meeting of the
HMCC, Joynt, Harding-Barlowe
and Covey reportedly made sepa
rate inquiries regarding the in
cinerator and were told by Murphy
and Kakimoto that they believed
the incinerator was out of operation
at the time.
The questions of the three
HMCC members are not included
in the meeting's minutes.
"On a committee involved in is
sues of hazardous materials, the
University should supply someone
better able to contribute to discus
sions of public health and safety,"
Joynt said.
Decleve is expected to attend the
HMCC's Thursday meeting to ex
plain Stanford's safety procedures.
"This has not inspired a lot of
confidence in the University,"
Covey said. "Especially when it is
the landlord for [the Stanford Re
search Park]."
Researchers in several of the 10
buildings targeted by the investiga
tion said they were surprised at
Molestad's reported accusations.
One lab safety officer in the Keck
Building said yesterday he had "no
idea why it was singled out."
"It was a total surprise to me,"
said the source, a graduate student
who wished to remain anonymous.

"Keck is a brand-new building....
I don't know of any incidents that
may have led to this."
Built in 1986, Keck is used for
physical chemistry research. SRI is
investigating its containment proce
dures.
The lab safety officer disputed
the fire department's claim that the
University does not adequately
report spills of hazardous chemi
cals. "In the course of experiments,
one often drops a flask of this or
a flask of that," said the officer. "If
one drops a salt solution on the
floor, one has to ask oneself, 'Is it
worth reporting?' "
According to the source, the Uni
versity's Department of Health and
Safety has been "more than
cooperative" with his building, pro
viding "Life Safety Boxes" in every
department. The boxes list com
pounds, amounts stored, possible
hazards and procedures to follow
in the event of an emergency.
Other graduate students also
were undaunted by the charges.
Vincent Moy, a fourth-year
chemistry graduate student who
works in the chemistry building
Stauffer 11, said he "feels safe."
"Once or twice we've been lec
tured about safety," said Moy, who
added that the halls at Stauffer have
been "pretty clear" of equipment.
"Every time there is an incident,
it raises safety consciousness a
notch," Decleve said.
