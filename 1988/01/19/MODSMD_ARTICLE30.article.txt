# Golfers 7th after 36
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
The coastal town of Santa Bar
bara is known for its wealth and
idyllic weather conditions. Yes
terday, however, the nasty wind
and cold came out to punish the
Stanford men's golf team.
Every golfer who has struggled
through the wind and cold of an
early-morning round knows how
difficult it is to perform well un
der such circumstances. With the
added intensity of NCAA com
petition, turning in a good
scorecard becomes nearly impos
sible. The men's golf team, un
daunted by such hardships,
turned in a good performance
yesterday, fighting its way to
seventh place in a tightlv packed
field of 18.
After one day of competition
(two rounds) in the two-day
Hammond Bell Pacific Coast
Championship, UC-Santa Bar
bara leads the pack with a team
score of 608. Washington stands
second at 612. The Cardinal
turned in a respectable 630 to
hold seventh place by one stroke
over UC-lrvine.
Don Christensen, a sopho
more from Seattle, turned in a
surprising 156 (79-77) to lead
Stanford after the first day. He
was followed by sophomore Brad
Joondeph with 157 (81-76).
Other scorers for the Cardinal
were junior Johnny Mahon, who
fired 158 (82-76), and sopho
more Mark Funseth, who carded
159 (78-81).
Stanford Coach Wally Good
win described the 7000-yard
Sandpiper Country Club as a typ
ical California coastal course,
which uses ravines, hilltops and
ledges to augment its already dif
ficult oceanside conditions.

Goodwin stressed that the cour
se's length became a factor in
the windy conditions yesterday.
In addition, the coach told of
the punishing greens, which, not
unlike some at Augusta National
Golf Course in Georgia, make
it very difficult to hold an ap
proach shot on them. In the stiff
ocean breezes, Goodwin said,
"sometimes the ball would blow
clear off the greens."
Yesterday's performance by
the Cardinal golfers was not
quite what Goodwin had ex
pected. While the wind and cold
probably inflated all the team's
scores, the coach said that the
Cardinal team was "not playing
as well as I thought." He added
that the team should have scored
between 605 and 610 yesterday.
Stanford was already at a dis
advantage against UCSB even
without the harsh weather yes
terday — Sandpiper is the UCSB
Gauchos' home course. Was
hington's placement four shots
back impressed Goodwin, who
said that their golf program had
"come a long way" in the past
year.
On the positive side, Goodwin
added that this tournament
marked the first time the Car
dinal's scores had improved from
round one to round two. The
progress between rounds is a
good sign for a team that started
strongly in the University of San
Francisco Invitational at the
Olympic Club, but dropped out
of contention in the succeeding
rounds by scoring poorly.
Goodwin hopes the team's
performance will continue to im
prove today so the team can
"jump into third or fourth place."
He was encouraged by the per
formance yesterday because the
players "kept their heads."
