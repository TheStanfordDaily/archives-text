# Card wrestlers romp in Aggie Invitational
## 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
Stanford's wrestling team came
into this weekend's "Aggie In
vitational" tournament at UC-Davis
as the defending champions of the
meet. The Cardinal was, however,
the underdog of the competition
following losses to San Jose State
earlier in the season and to Chico
State in a Friday night warm-up
dual.
But as is often the case, the pre
meet predictions didn't hold true.
An outstanding team performance
gave the Cardinal a narrow two
point victory over Chico in the final
point standings, 136.25 to 134.25.
Four individual championships, a
runner-up performance and several
other placings by its wrestlers gave
Stanford the edge in what Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel called a "really
encouraging performance."
The Saturday tournament was

preceded by a dual meet Friday
night, during which Stanford
wrestled Chico at Davis. In a 24-13
defeat, the Cardinal had only three
individual victories. Josh Lisle, at
134 pounds, dominated his oppon
ent with a 18-7 decision, 158-pound
Steve Yarbrough finished his match
with a 6-3 victory, and Terry Mcln
tyre began his undefeated weekend
with a 10-1 conquest. The 118-
pound weight bracket was forfeited
again, as has been the case for Stan
ford throughout most of this season.
The final team scores did not
reflect what was really a close meet.
Freshman Steve Buddie lost an
early lead and finished his 167-
pound match in a 5-5 tie. A tie
gives each team two points. Two
other matches were decided by only
one point.
"It was a disappointing meet be
cause we lost two matches by one
point and tied another (Buddie's)
in which we were leading. It

could've easily gone the other way,"
Horpel said.
That performance set the scene
for Saturday's Aggie tournament,
in which seven teams were entered.
Chico State, Davis, Humboldt
State, San Jose State, Oregon In
stitute of Technology and Stanford
were each allowed to enter 15
wrestlers. The seventh team, San
Francisco State, never found its way
to Davis. "They're still a mystery,"
Horpel said.
Loren Vigil, Stanford's 126-
pound wrestler, came into his own
at the Aggie tournament as he
avenged two earlier losses and won
his bracket's championship. Vigil,
a freshman from New Mexico,
worked his way to the tournament's
final round and defeated his op
ponent from San Jose State by pin
ning him in 2:33.
The icing on the cake was that
the same Spartan opponent had ad
vanced to the Aggie finals by de

feating the Wildcat wrestler who
had beaten Vigil Friday night. Vigil
had also lost to the San Jose State
man in a dual meet earlier this
season, 9-3.
"It was a really big confidence
builder for me, especially since I
beat someone whom I had lost to
earlier this year," Vigil said. "I was
flying pretty high afterwards."
Lisle, at 134 pounds, finished
third in the Aggie, and his second
string understudy, Joe Reilly, took
sixth. Stanford took five non-varsity
wrestlers to the tournament in ad
dition to the starting grapplers.
James Dinette finished fourth at
142 pounds, and Stanford's second
142-pound wrestler, Mike Rehder,
took fifth.
The only Stanford vs. Stanford
matchup in the tournament came
in the early rounds of the 150-
pound division, where Geoff Baum
met freshman Jerome Farmer.
Farmer had held down the varsity

position for a short time at the
beginning of the season until Baum
regained the starting spot during a
challenge match. This time Baum
was again the victor, demoting
Farmer to the consolation bracket
with a 10-5 decision on his way to
a fourth-place finish.
Farmer bounced back from this
defeat to pin an opponent who had
defeated him at last week's Doc
Petersen tournament and garner a
fifth-place finish.
At 158 pounds, Yarbrough con
tinued his successful season by
bringing home a championship at
the tournament. Yarbrough won by
a technical fall (when one opponent
gains a 15-point advantage) in the
finals against Jeff Profio of San Jose
State. The match was stopped when
Yarbrough ran the score up to 23-7
and gained the required advantage.
Buddie, the 167-pound freshman
sensation, continued his winning
ways with a victory in the Aggie

finals over Brent Kranig of Chico
State. To make the win even
sweeter, it must be noted that Bud
die's opponent was the same
wrestler who had wrestled him to
a tie on Friday night. This time,
Buddie took the championship with
a 9-6 decision.
Eric Harbcr, a two-year letter
winner who was displaced by
Buddie this season, also had the
opportunity to wrestle at the com
petition. He finished in third place
after beating Phil Gardener of UC-
Davis in a decisive 7-1 match.
Sophomore Ron Perry, at 177
pounds, worked his way to the finals
by beating Brian Bennett of Chico
State, an opponent who had beaten
him 18-6 on Friday night. In the
championship match, however, it
was time for someone else to turn
the table. Don Zeman of UC-Davis,
who had lost to Perry in each of
their encounters during the past two
years, managed a 6-3 decision to
give Perry the second-place finish.
Stanford's fourth and final Aggie
champion emerged in the form of
190-pound Mclntyrc. Wrestling a
total of 10:15 during the entire
event, Mclntyre worked his way
through his weight bracket to gain
the championship crown. His first
match, against Neil Forester of the
Oregon Institute of Technology,
ended in 1:10 when Mclntyrc
pinned his opponent.
The second round of the meet
pitted Mclntyre against Trevor
Sanders of Humboldt State.
Sanders endured the offensive
onslaught for 2:05 before losing by
fall to Mclntyre.
In the finals, Mclntyre broke a
sweat defeating Humboldt's varsity
190-pound grappler, Jon Mclntirc,
by a score of 6-1.
In the heavyweight division,
Trent Smith finished fourth. Smith,

who is coming off of an injury to
his ribs, was wrestling in his first
matches since the beginning of the
season.
"It was good for the team to be
able to win when we had the
chance. Most of the teams (at the
Aggie) were pretty evenly matched,
and by winning the tournament we
did as well as we possibly could
have," Horpcl said.
Since points were awarded for
finishes as well as for advancement,
each wrestler's efforts were needed
for the Cardinal to place two points
ahead of Chico in the final stand
ings.
Stanford will be back on the mats
tonight in its first home meet since
Dec. 2. The Cardinal will wrestle
Cal Poly-San Luis Obisbo at 7:30
p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
"Cal Poly will be really tough.
They won a tournament earlier this
season in Fullerton, so it should be
a good matchup," Horpel said.
Tonight's match is one of only
five which Stanford will wrestle at
home this season. The next will be
against Cal State-Fullerton Jan. 29.
