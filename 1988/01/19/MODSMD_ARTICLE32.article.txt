# Card struggles in first meet of season
## Women gymnasts fall to Beavers 
### Chris Kendrick Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gymnastics team has the
talent and the work ethic to be among the top teams
in the nation, but the team will need to combine those
qualities demonstrated in practice into solid meet per
formances.
On Friday night, the Cardinal lost its first dual meet
of the season to the Oregon State Beavers in Corvallis,
Ore., 181.95-176.
"It was a typical first meet," Dina Amoroso said.
"We had some mistakes, and there was a lot of room
for improvement."
Amoroso, the top all-around finisher last season,
was injured in the second event of the meet while
she was executing the most difficult vault of the com
petition, a tsuak vault. Despite the injury, she still
placed second in that event.
"It will take time to heal," the sophomore said of
the injury. Consequently, she will not be competing
in next week's invitational at Berkeley.
As Stanford Coach Homer Sardina had anticipated,
the performances on the uneven bars, which was the
opening event, were the most inconsistent of the meet.
"The bars are a rough event for us to start on," he
said. "We had warmed up bars quite well, but we
missed virtually 90 percent of our release moves in
competition."
Sardina did say that redshirt sophomore Marietta
Frey performed well for the Cardinal on the bars in
her first competition for Stanford since returning from
an injury that kept her out all of last season.
In the floor exercise, sophomore Susan Banta moved
from the exhibition team to give the first team a boost
with a solid 8.55 score. "This was the best meet that
Susan's had at Stanford," Sardina said.
