# Card struggles in first meet of season
## Women gymnasts fall to Beavers 
### Chris Kendrick Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gymnastics team has the
talent and the work ethic to be among the top teams
in the nation, but the team will need to combine those
qualities demonstrated in practice into solid meet per
formances.
On Friday night, the Cardinal lost its first dual meet
of the season to the Oregon State Beavers in Corvallis,
Ore., 181.95-176.
"It was a typical first meet," Dina Amoroso said.
"We had some mistakes, and there was a lot of room
for improvement."
Amoroso, the top all-around finisher last season,
was injured in the second event of the meet while
she was executing the most difficult vault of the com
petition, a tsuak vault. Despite the injury, she still
placed second in that event.
"It will take time to heal," the sophomore said of
the injury. Consequently, she will not be competing
in next week's invitational at Berkeley.
As Stanford Coach Homer Sardina had anticipated,
the performances on the uneven bars, which was the
opening event, were the most inconsistent of the meet.
"The bars are a rough event for us to start on," he
said. "We had warmed up bars quite well, but we
missed virtually 90 percent of our release moves in
competition."
Sardina did say that redshirt sophomore Marietta
Frey performed well for the Cardinal on the bars in
her first competition for Stanford since returning from
an injury that kept her out all of last season.
In the floor exercise, sophomore Susan Banta moved
from the exhibition team to give the first team a boost
with a solid 8.55 score. "This was the best meet that
Susan's had at Stanford," Sardina said.

Stanford's Cheryl Doo, last year's co-captain, is known for her exciting floor routines.
After a long evening, the Cardi
nal gymnasts, who had been war
ming up since 5 p.m., seemed to
have lost their concentration when
the final event, the beam, started
at 10 p.m.
"The way the meet was organized
was slow," Sardina said. "We had
lost our focus going into the beam,
and we had some falls."
The meet loss was overshadowed
by several bright spots, according

to Sardina, who was forced to adjust
the lineup considerably because of
the injuries to Amoroso and junior
Jinny Rhec. The freshmen and the
seniors had outstanding meets;
senior Alison McGann finished
third all-around with a 35.55.
"In essence we had 20 falls, and
10 go toward the team score," Sar
dina said. "Our team score would
have been five points higher if we
hit everything. We have to shore
up our misses."
"I'm not too hung up on wins
and losses because wins and losses
don't mean anything â€” it's the
score," Sardina said.
