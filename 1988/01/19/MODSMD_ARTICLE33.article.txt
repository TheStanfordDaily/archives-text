# Swimming wins two, falls to Michigan

### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The holiday weekend cannot be considered
a success for the Stanford men's swimming
team, but it should not be called a failure
either.
Although a group of Cardinal swimmers
dropped a key meet against Michigan Sat
urday, the team did win two of three over
the weekend, defeating both Michigan State
and UC-Davis.
Raising Stanford's dual-meet record to 4-2,
the travelling squad prevailed 62-50 over the
Michigan State Spartans Friday, and the Car
dinal contingent destroyed Pacific 10 Con
ference rival Davis 114-97 Saturday. The
second-ranked Cardinal was surprised,
however, by the No. 8 Michigan Wolverines
65-46 in its second dual-meet loss of the year
— the first time the squad has dropped more
than one contest in a season during the past
four years.
Opening the contest with a rare loss in
the 400-yard medley relay, the Cardinal was
forced to play catch-up the entire meet and
battle the Wolverines' momentum. Stanford
won the relay at the past three NCAA cham
pionships and had not lost the race previously
this season.
"Losing the first relay was really hard,"
sophomore Doug Lillydahl said. "We always
win it. It's expected. It was a test for the
team to come back for the next events."
The squad was not defeated after its early
loss, winning six out of the 10 remaining
swimming events, but it was not able to gain
the advantage over the fast and deep Mich
igan squad.
"We weren't out of the meet after the
relay loss," senior tri-captain Sean Murphy

said. "We definitely put up a fight till the
end."
But Stanford was not able to compete with
the Wolverines' meet preparations. The
Michigan squad was more rested and had
extra swimmers — Stanford travelled with
only 14 competitors. The Cardinal was able
to finish two swimmers in the top three in
only the 200 backstroke, narrowly missing
point-scoring finishes in a number of events.
"They were rested, ready and sharp,"
Murphy said. "They got the second- and
third-places we needed to win."
"We didn't swim badly, but they swam an
excellent meet," Lillydahl said.
The meet was highlighted by strong per
formances from distance freestyler John
Witchel, butterflier Anthony Mosse, back
stroker Murphy and sprinter Lillydahl.
Witchel swam back-to-back events, following
a win in the grueling 1000 free with a close
second in the 200 free. He later came back
and won the 500 free.
Mosse prevailed in the 200 fly, Murphy in
the 200 back and Lillydahl in the 50 free.
The victory was Lillydahl's first in a major
dual meet. The Cardinal also took the 400
free relay.
Although the divers were defeated in both
events by Michigan's Lee Michaud, Cardinal
junior Mike Frawley took second in both the
1-meter and 3-meter competitions, and fresh
man Mike Burton placed third in the 1-meter
event.
"I'm really pleased with the meet. We got
out of it exactly what we needed," Stanford
Coach Skip Kenncy said. "Wc know exactly
what Pac-10 competition is like, and we

Stanford freshman Matt Rogers, one of the top recruits in the nation, and the men's
swimming team split their squad last weekend and came away 2-1 in dual-meet competition.
