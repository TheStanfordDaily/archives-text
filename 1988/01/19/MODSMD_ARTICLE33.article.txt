# Swimming wins two, falls to Michigan
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The holiday weekend cannot be considered
a success for the Stanford men's swimming
team, but it should not be called a failure
either.
Although a group of Cardinal swimmers
dropped a key meet against Michigan Sat
urday, the team did win two of three over
the weekend, defeating both Michigan State
and UC-Davis.
Raising Stanford's dual-meet record to 4-2,
the travelling squad prevailed 62-50 over the
Michigan State Spartans Friday, and the Car
dinal contingent destroyed Pacific 10 Con
ference rival Davis 114-97 Saturday. The
second-ranked Cardinal was surprised,
however, by the No. 8 Michigan Wolverines
65-46 in its second dual-meet loss of the year
— the first time the squad has dropped more
than one contest in a season during the past
four years.
Opening the contest with a rare loss in
the 400-yard medley relay, the Cardinal was
forced to play catch-up the entire meet and
battle the Wolverines' momentum. Stanford
won the relay at the past three NCAA cham
pionships and had not lost the race previously
this season.
"Losing the first relay was really hard,"
sophomore Doug Lillydahl said. "We always
win it. It's expected. It was a test for the
team to come back for the next events."
The squad was not defeated after its early
loss, winning six out of the 10 remaining
swimming events, but it was not able to gain
the advantage over the fast and deep Mich
igan squad.
"We weren't out of the meet after the
relay loss," senior tri-captain Sean Murphy

said. "We definitely put up a fight till the
end."
But Stanford was not able to compete with
the Wolverines' meet preparations. The
Michigan squad was more rested and had
extra swimmers — Stanford travelled with
only 14 competitors. The Cardinal was able
to finish two swimmers in the top three in
only the 200 backstroke, narrowly missing
point-scoring finishes in a number of events.
"They were rested, ready and sharp,"
Murphy said. "They got the second- and
third-places we needed to win."
"We didn't swim badly, but they swam an
excellent meet," Lillydahl said.
The meet was highlighted by strong per
formances from distance freestyler John
Witchel, butterflier Anthony Mosse, back
stroker Murphy and sprinter Lillydahl.
Witchel swam back-to-back events, following
a win in the grueling 1000 free with a close
second in the 200 free. He later came back
and won the 500 free.
Mosse prevailed in the 200 fly, Murphy in
the 200 back and Lillydahl in the 50 free.
The victory was Lillydahl's first in a major
dual meet. The Cardinal also took the 400
free relay.
Although the divers were defeated in both
events by Michigan's Lee Michaud, Cardinal
junior Mike Frawley took second in both the
1-meter and 3-meter competitions, and fresh
man Mike Burton placed third in the 1-meter
event.
"I'm really pleased with the meet. We got
out of it exactly what we needed," Stanford
Coach Skip Kenncy said. "Wc know exactly
what Pac-10 competition is like, and we

needed to swim in a meet where
nobody is quite sure what is going
to happen. We are a young team,
and the experience was beneficial."
"It was one of our better swim
meets as far as energy, effort and
concentration went," Murphy
added. "Unfortunately the final
result didn't show this."
The half-distance meet against
Michigan State was considered
more of a warm-up for the Michigan
contest than a serious competition.
The usual dual-meet 200-yard races
were not held, and the 100-yard
events were not contested either.
Swimmers competed in 25- and 50-
yard races for each event, of which
only the 50 free is a sanctioned race.
"It was a really fun meet," Lil
lydahl said. "I haven't swum 25-yard
races since I was 10."
The Cardinal's goal was to gain
speed for the Michigan contest the
following day.
The swimmers who did not go to
the midwest were busy travelling to
Davis and handily defeating the
Aggies. The Cardinal was victorious

in nine of the meet's 13 events and
swam a number of racers unoffi
cially so as to not run up the score
of the meet.
According to Asst. Coach Ted
Knapp, the squad raced hard but
not very fast. "I thought we would
be a little faster, but we weren't
able to get the times we would have
liked to because the pool was very
slow and the wind affectcd the
racing," he said.
Although no swimmer qualified
for the NCAA finals based on his
performance this weekend, Mosse
became the first Cardinal to make
the championships based on his
times when racing in Austrailia the
past two weeks. He qualified in the
200 fly, but the new NCAA rules
require that a swimmer need only
qualify for the meet in one event
to swim in up to three races.
Overall, Kenney is optimistic
about the Cardinal's chances in
postseason competition, even con
sidering the team's second dual
meet loss this year. "We're a much
better championship team than
dual-meet team," he said. "The
tough job ahead of us in relation
to the losses is to maintain our
confidence right up to the end
(NCAAs)."
