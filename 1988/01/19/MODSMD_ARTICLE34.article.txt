# Men's gymnastics wins third in row
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
When embarking on a long,
strenuous march that will be com
plete only if the troops are at full
strength over the last few miles, it
is important to start off slow.
The Stanford men's gymnastics
team has started a three-month
journey to the NCAA champion
ships in Lincoln, Neb. When it fi
nally reaches its destination, the
Cardinal must perform at its abso
lute best. Therefore, for the mo
ment, the Stanford gymnasts must
forget about their overall scores.
They must concentrate, instead, on
practicing difficult routines whose
benefits will not be realized until
much later in the winter.
Friday night the Cardinal
traveled to Cal State-Fullerton for
its second meet of the 1988 season.
Despite approaching the meet in a
way not particularly beneficial to
the team score, Stanford did win,
271.6 to 267, and it improved its
record to 3-0.
Only one Cardinal gymnast,
junior Andy Ropp, participated in
all six events Friday evening. Ropp
scored 54 points, an especially good
total considering that this was only
the season's second meet and that
the judging was, according to junior
Scott Schaffer, "pretty tight."
Fullerton's Bill Barham led the
meet's all-around competition,
scoring 56.8 points.
Schaffer pointed to Stanford's
performance on the still rings as
the highlight of the competition.
Given that this event has never been
the team's strong point, improve
ment on the rings is one of the

Cardinal's more important goals.
That the rings went so well despite
the fact that senior Mike Matzek,
Stanford's top ring performer, and
sophomore Adam Forman, also an
especially strong gymnast, did not
compete on the event made the
Cardinal's work especially satisfy
ing, according to Schaffer.
Forman, who redshirted last year,
and Tim Wang, a freshman from
New York City, are Stanford's only
gymnasts without considerable col
legiate experience. Both, however,
are expected to contribute imme
diately. Forman, considered by
many coaches to be the nation's
No. 1 recruit last season, will likely
perform at the level of a seasoned
sophomore.
Wang's smooth execution and
stylistic aptitude are his strong
points now. As he adds strength
and difficulty to his routines, he
will become a more and more valu
able Cardinal performer.
While its record and margin of
victory thus far have been impres
sive, Stanford's scores do not even
approach what they will be when
routines have been perfected and
when Head Coach Sadao Hamada
has the team competing at its high
est level. As well, the Cardinal will
find its competition a little more
serious in terms of putting together
a total team performance.
Under optimal conditions and
with a little luck, the Cardinal gym
nasts project team scores as high
as 285 points. The talent runs deep
for this season's squad, and so, un
der less than optimal conditions and
even with a couple of injuries, Stan
ford will likely have a meet average
of over 280 points by season's end.
