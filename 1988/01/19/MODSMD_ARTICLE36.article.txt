do to become very embarrassed.

women's swimming team.
The San Jose State Spartans
found out the hard way that the
Cardinal swim team is not to be
tangled with. In a non-scoring meet
at deGuerre Pool Saturday, Stan
ford dominated the Spartans while
getting ready for a pair of big meets
this weekend. The Cardinal visits
top-10 powers UCLA and USC Fri
day and Saturday.
Despite having many swimmers
competing in off-events, the Cardi
nal faced little difficulty in the Spar
tans, receiving more competition
from swimmers from the Woodside
Swim Club. The Woodside swim
mers actually finished first in four
events, although they were in the
pool only on an exhibition basis.
"Sometimes it's hard to get up
for a meet like that," senior Jen
Pokluda said. "(But) everyone al
ways wants to swim well. There's
a certain degree of respect for every
meet."

The contest began under stormy
skies with the 200-yard medley
relay, and the Cardinal swimmers
showed right away that they were
up. The Stanford A team, com
prised of Pokluda, juniors Susan
Lenth and Jenna Johnson, and
sophomore Jill Johnson won the
event, with the Stanford B team
(seniors Susan Rapp and Stephanie
Norton, and juniors Michelle
Donahue and Carrie Larson) taking
a close second, more than four
seconds ahead of the rest of the
field.
As the day wore on, the pattern
continued. Jenna Johnson went on
to win two other events, matching
the performance of sophomore Bet
hanne Lambert. Johnson triumphed
in the 50 free, then turned around
and won the 500 free, a much longer
event than those she usually swims.
Lambert, an All-American last
year in the 200 breast, won both
that race and the 100 breast, leading
a pair of Stanford sweeps.
Four other Stanford swimmers
won races Saturday, quite a domi
nant perfomance compared to the
Spartans' placing only one compet
itor in the top three all day. Pokluda
won the 100 back, an event she has
placed in at the NCAAs in each of
her prior three years here.

Junior Aimee Berzins took her
specialty, the 100 free, sophomore
Susannah Miller won the 200 back,
and Rapp tied Angie Wester of
Woodside for the 100 fly title.
The Cardinal then finished the
meet the same way it had started,
taking first and second in the meet
ending 200 free relay. The A team
— Jenna Johnson, freshmen Jody
Smith, Miller and Berzins — edged
the B team, composed of Pokluda,
freshman Suzy Buckovich, Rapp
and senior Stacy Shupe.
"The weather was really bad,"
Pokluda said, "but we had fun.
We're doing so well this year;
everyone's really excited."
The meets in Los Angeles this
weekend will be the first of many
against top-10 opponents. After this
weekend, the Cardinal returns to
the Farm to meet the Sun Devils
of Arizona State on Jan. 29.
The following Saturday the Car
dinal will have a chance to extract
some revenge from its arch-nemesis,
Texas. The Longhorns edged Stan
ford in last year's NCAA cham
pionships to win their fourth con
secutive national title.
"I think we're ready for it (the
improved competition). We're
really directing ourselves for these
meets," Pokluda said.
