# Humane Society charges EIR is incomplete

### Elizabeth Howton Staff writer 
Charging that the draft environmental
impact report on Stanford's proposed
Research Animal Facility II (RAF II)
is "inaccurate" and "incomplete," direc
tors of the Palo Alto Humane Society
yesterday demanded that the final ver
sion of the report evaluate surrounding
Stanford buildings in addition to RAF 11.
The final report should "address the
incremental and cumulative impacts of
.. . other subdivisions of Stanford .. .
and the companies in the area," the
directors argued.
The draft environmental impact report
(EIR), released Dec. 21, states that
there are no "unavoidable significant ad

verse impacts" to the environment as
sociated with the proposed facility. Bar
ring major changes in the final version
of the report, the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors will probably grant
the University a land-use permit, which
would enable construction of RAF II to
begin this spring.
While acknowledging that their "pri
mary concern" is for animal welfare,
Humane Society Director Patricia Elsen
said the group's members are "not one
issue people" and are genuinely con
cerned with the potential environmental
impact of the facility.
The Humane Society directors ex
pressed opposition to the project on a
variety of grounds besides animal wel
fare, including health risks to laboratory

workers, uncertainty about the results
and ethics of recombinant DNA re
search, possible damage to the environ
ment and the University's "history of
carelessness" in dealing with health and
safety concerns in general.
The concerns about recombinant
DNA research stem from the proximity
of RAF II to another building under
construction, the Center for Molecular
and Genetic Medicine. The members
feel that because RAF II is being built
in part to support research at the center,
the latter should also be considered in
the report.
Citing a cancer outbreak at the Pas
teur Institute in France, Director Lise
Giraud said that there is "no reason to
assume that recombinant DNA ... is

safe."
She added, "It has the potential, no
matter how remote, of catastrophic
results."
Giraud, who is a librarian here, also
warned that research can become a
"precipitous search for monetary
rewards" and may be conducted more
speedily and secretively than is safe.
"Huge amounts of money [are] at stake,"
she said.
The report states that the facility
would not be engaged in any experi
ments, including recombinant DNA re
search, that would require more than
"basic" levels of safety equipment and
techniques and that "solid and liquid
hazardous wastes other than those
similar to household wastes would
not be generated in the RAF II
facility."
But the directors suggested that
even those types of wastes might
combine with wastes from other
labs at the University or from com
panies in the area to adversely af
fect the environment. They raised
the possibility that a crippling judg
ment could be brought against the
University or Santa Clara County
in the event of a chemical accident.
In addition, they charged that
"there are no EPA (Environmental
Protection Agency) regulations on
what bacteria can go down the
drain" and no filters on the ven
tilation stacks for RAF 11, which
will be underground.
Citing "confidential sources,"
Giraud also said the University has
a poor history of handling health
and safety risks. Procedures now in
pace are "practically nil and
meaningless," and there are "no
routine inspections," she said, add
ing that safety violations at the Uni
versity were "common knowledge."
Giraud cited allegations by a Uni
versity employee which, when
revealed Dec. 10, precipitated a
widespread investigation into health

and safety concerns.
Although RAF II will house
mainly rodents, Elsen said the fa
cility will not meet the requirements
of a 1985 amendment to the Animal
Welfare Act, requiring the "exercise
of canines" and the "psychological
well-being of primates," because it
will be underground.
The enforcing USDA regulations
for the amendment have not yet
been enacted, and the directors
charged that Stanford has been
secretly engaged in lobbying against
them.
But a report released by the Uni
versity in August stated that the
University has "every reason to be
lieve that [its] new facility will be
in compliance with the new USDA
regulations." University President
Donald Kennedy also added in the
report that "we will be legally re
quired to comply with the new reg
ulations whenever they are issued."
The Humane Society asked the
Board of Supervisors to require
Stanford to commission the envi
ronmental impact report. The Uni
versity estimates that the report has
cost $500,000, including the costs
of delaying construction. However,
the directors allege conflict of in
terest because the report was
produced by a company hired by
Stanford.
Construction, which was
originally scheduled to begin last
fall, will not begin until April.
