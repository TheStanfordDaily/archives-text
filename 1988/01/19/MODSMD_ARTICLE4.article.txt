# Humane Society charges EIR is incomplete

### Elizabeth Howton Staff writer 
Charging that the draft environmental
impact report on Stanford's proposed
Research Animal Facility II (RAF II)
is "inaccurate" and "incomplete," direc
tors of the Palo Alto Humane Society
yesterday demanded that the final ver
sion of the report evaluate surrounding
Stanford buildings in addition to RAF 11.
The final report should "address the
incremental and cumulative impacts of
.. . other subdivisions of Stanford .. .
and the companies in the area," the
directors argued.
The draft environmental impact report
(EIR), released Dec. 21, states that
there are no "unavoidable significant ad

verse impacts" to the environment as
sociated with the proposed facility. Bar
ring major changes in the final version
of the report, the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors will probably grant
the University a land-use permit, which
would enable construction of RAF II to
begin this spring.
While acknowledging that their "pri
mary concern" is for animal welfare,
Humane Society Director Patricia Elsen
said the group's members are "not one
issue people" and are genuinely con
cerned with the potential environmental
impact of the facility.
The Humane Society directors ex
pressed opposition to the project on a
variety of grounds besides animal wel
fare, including health risks to laboratory

workers, uncertainty about the results
and ethics of recombinant DNA re
search, possible damage to the environ
ment and the University's "history of
carelessness" in dealing with health and
safety concerns in general.
The concerns about recombinant
DNA research stem from the proximity
of RAF II to another building under
construction, the Center for Molecular
and Genetic Medicine. The members
feel that because RAF II is being built
in part to support research at the center,
the latter should also be considered in
the report.
Citing a cancer outbreak at the Pas
teur Institute in France, Director Lise
Giraud said that there is "no reason to
assume that recombinant DNA ... is

safe."
She added, "It has the potential, no
matter how remote, of catastrophic
results."
Giraud, who is a librarian here, also
warned that research can become a
"precipitous search for monetary
rewards" and may be conducted more
speedily and secretively than is safe.
"Huge amounts of money [are] at stake,"
she said.
The report states that the facility
would not be engaged in any experi
ments, including recombinant DNA re
search, that would require more than
"basic" levels of safety equipment and
techniques and that "solid and liquid
