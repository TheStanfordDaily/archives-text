daughter of the late Martin Luther
King Jr., combined politics and
drama with flair Friday night, rem

pressive oratorical talents.
"You must get off your aa ...
pathy," King, an actress and po
litical activist, wryly told a
capacity, predominantly black
crowd at Kresge Auditorium.
College students have become
too "laid-back" in a time of "mis
directed priorities," King said.
According to King, the Penta
gon spends an estimated $41 mil
lion every hour on war, while 48
percent of all American black
children live below the poverty
line.
While students are safely tucked
away in the "never-never-land of
Stanford University," her father's
dream for social equality is "being
deferred," King said.
"In 1988 Jim Crow is dead, but

"social discrepancy" that 6 percent
of the nation controls 70 percent

do not vote," King said. "They must be

Black Student Union (BSU) Chair Bill
King (no relation) sat behind King during
her speech, nodding approvingly as she
lashed out at students who are not poli

co-sponsored the speech.
"If you do not think [student leaders]
are working, do not just sit there and
criticize and complain. Get in there," she
said.
She also encouraged students to apply
for internships and scholarships at the
Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Social

Change in Atlanta, Ga., where students
develop skills for non-violent social
change.
King called yesterday's national holiday
for her father "a moment of triumph for
America."
"We have hundreds of monuments to
men of war. At last there is an opportunity
to celebrate a man of peace," she said.
