Americans should support presi
dential candidates who recognize
the need to "tax and invest" in
order to face a "national emergen
cy" of inadequate education, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
told the Commonwealth Club of
San Francisco Friday.
In his speech to the association
of business leaders from the Bay
Area, Kennedy called education in
the United States an "omnibus
crisis with three parts."
The first of the three problems,
Kennedy said, is "an epidemic of
juvenile poverty" that has created

speeches have included an empha

government definitions of knowl

At the university level, he advo
