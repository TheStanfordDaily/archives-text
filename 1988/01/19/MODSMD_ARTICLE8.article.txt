Parades, prayers mark King holiday
ATLANTA — Americans marked the third annual observance
of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday yesterday with parades, prayer
services, marches and pealing of bells.
Public officials, preachers and civil rights leaders joined with
thousands of ordinary citizens — black and white — to honor the
martyred Atlanta minister and to call for a renewed commitment
to King's dream of freedom and justice for all.
"Daddy, we've come a long, long way," King's son, Martin Luther
King III, said in a moving tribute at an ecumenical service in
Atlanta, focal point of the nationwide holiday activities, "but we've
still got a long, long way to go."
The King holiday celebration in Atlanta was launched with a
traditional wreath-laying ceremony at King's white-marble crypt,
set in a reflecting pool next door to Ebenezer Baptist Church,
where King once served as co-pastor with his father.
King's widow, Coretta Scott King, was accompanied by Democratic
Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young for
the placing of the wreath of yellow and white mums at King's
tomb. Young, a former King lieutenant, also offered a brief prayer.
Mrs. King presided over the ecumenical service at Ebenezer
Baptist, where her son spoke.
Cuba to resume U.S. emigration
WASHINGTON — Reagan administration officials said yesterday
that Cuban immigration into the United States, suspended since
1985, will resume next month under an agreement that represents
the strongest evidence to date of a warming in relations between
Washington and Havana.
Final details of the accord were approved at a quiet meeting of
Cuban and U.S. diplomats in Mexico last week, the officials said.
It remains unclear why the Cubans changed their stand, but U.S.
officials speculated that President Fidel Castro is seeking to expel
political opponents through emigration, a tactic he has used as an
outlet for dissent since coming to power Jan. 1, 1959.
For the United States, the agreement is a significant step toward
a long-range goal of systematic Cuban immigration that would keep
out so-called "undesirables" such as the criminals now held in U.S.
prisons awaiting return to their island home, while allowing political
dissidents to emigrate to the United States.
U.S.-Cuban relations have been chilly since the inauguration
three years ago of Radio Marti, a U.S. government-operated radio
station that broadcasts news, features and commentary in Spanish
to Cuba from a transmitter in Florida. The station is named for
19th-century Cuban patriot Jose Marti.
Cuba angrily suspended the immigration agreement May 20, 1985,
the day Radio Marti went on the air. Castro's government denounced
the station, which broadcasts on both standard and short-wave
bands, as a "shameful provocation."
Soviets call for weapons cuts
BONN, West Germany — The Soviet Union yesterday called for
dismantling all of the world's tactical nuclear arms — those with
ranges of less than 300 miles — but said that negotiations on such
weapons could be postponed for a while.
"We are for a complete elimination of tactical nuclear means,
which would be in accordance with the inherent interests of all
Europeans," Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said in
a speech at a state dinner last night during a two-day visit to Bonn.
Shevardnadaze's declaration confirmed long-held expectations
within the Western alliance that Moscow would press for a "third
zero option" providing for dismantling all of the world's shortest
range nuclear weapons.
The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed last
month in Washington, embodies what is called the "double zero
option," because it provides for scrapping all nuclear missiles in
two range categories: from 300 to 600 miles, and from 600 to 3500
miles.
But NATO opposes a "third zero option," because it believes
that it is necessary to keep some tactical, or battlefield-range,
nuclear weapons as a deterrent in view of the Warsaw Pact's
perceived superiority in conventional, or non-nuclear, arms.
The Soviet Union, since January 1986, has supported elimination
of all of the world's nuclear weapons by the year 2000. But the
Soviets had not previously made a public proposal specifically urging
abolition of tactical nuclear weapons.
Argentine army rebellion ends
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Renegade Lt. Col. Aldo Rico
surrendered yesterday after skirmishes with loyal government forces,
ending a weekend rebellion by disgruntled Argentine army officers.
Three government soldiers were reported wounded in fighting
near a northern infantry regiment that was controlled by Rico until
late afternoon. Mutinies in several other provincial army units and
at an airport in Buenos Aires produced tense confrontations but
ended without shooting.
Thus, the armed forces averted a bloody internal conflict, and
Argentina's four-year-old democracy emerged shaken but intact.
"Democracy in the country is now consolidated, and we have
put order in the house," President Raul Alfonsin said last night.
"This episode has made possible in the Argentine army a restruc
turing that will permit us to work in closer unity."
Rico had emphasized that his rebellion was not aimed at deposing
the government. His main demands were for the resignation of the
army chief of staff and for an amnesty that would free officers
charged with killings, torture and other human rights violations.
Haitian government claims victory
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Supporters of Haiti's army-led
government claimed victory and opponents cried foul yesterday as
incomplete results of Sunday's widely boycotted presidential election
began to trickle in to the capital city.
Scattered partial returns from two of the country's nine provinces
showed conservative candidate Leslie Manigat significantly ahead
of the 10 other candidates, with Gregoire Eugene second, according
to the government-run National Radio.
A spokesman for the four-party opposition coalition that boycotted
the voting called for the results to be declared null and void.
In radio broadcasts yesterday, three of the coalition leaders, Marc
Bazin, Silvio Claude and Gerard Gourgue, denounced the voting
as a "fraud" and a "sham."
According to official and unofficial estimates, between 80 percent
and 93 percent of Haitians stayed away from the polls to protest
manipulation of the election by the provisional government of Lt.
Gen. Henri Namphy.
Acknowledging that a substantial majority of eligible voters stayed
home, the spokesman for the government's handpicked Electoral
Council, which staged the voting, said that "more than 20 percent
participated." The spokesman, Gerard Bretous, said that it might
be several days before a more precise and official count is available.

Public officials, preachers and civil rights leaders joined with
thousands of ordinary citizens — black and white — to honor the
martyred Atlanta minister and to call for a renewed commitment
to King's dream of freedom and justice for all.
"Daddy, we've come a long, long way," King's son, Martin Luther
King III, said in a moving tribute at an ecumenical service in
Atlanta, focal point of the nationwide holiday activities, "but we've
still got a long, long way to go."
The King holiday celebration in Atlanta was launched with a
traditional wreath-laying ceremony at King's white-marble crypt,
set in a reflecting pool next door to Ebenezer Baptist Church,
where King once served as co-pastor with his father.
King's widow, Coretta Scott King, was accompanied by Democratic
Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young for
the placing of the wreath of yellow and white mums at King's
tomb. Young, a former King lieutenant, also offered a brief prayer.
Mrs. King presided over the ecumenical service at Ebenezer
Baptist, where her son spoke.
Cuba to resume U.S. emigration
WASHINGTON — Reagan administration officials said yesterday
that Cuban immigration into the United States, suspended since
1985, will resume next month under an agreement that represents
the strongest evidence to date of a warming in relations between
Washington and Havana.
Final details of the accord were approved at a quiet meeting of
Cuban and U.S. diplomats in Mexico last week, the officials said.
It remains unclear why the Cubans changed their stand, but U.S.
officials speculated that President Fidel Castro is seeking to expel
political opponents through emigration, a tactic he has used as an
outlet for dissent since coming to power Jan. 1, 1959.
For the United States, the agreement is a significant step toward
a long-range goal of systematic Cuban immigration that would keep
out so-called "undesirables" such as the criminals now held in U.S.
prisons awaiting return to their island home, while allowing political
dissidents to emigrate to the United States.
U.S.-Cuban relations have been chilly since the inauguration
three years ago of Radio Marti, a U.S. government-operated radio
station that broadcasts news, features and commentary in Spanish
to Cuba from a transmitter in Florida. The station is named for
19th-century Cuban patriot Jose Marti.
Cuba angrily suspended the immigration agreement May 20, 1985,
the day Radio Marti went on the air. Castro's government denounced
the station, which broadcasts on both standard and short-wave
bands, as a "shameful provocation."
Soviets call for weapons cuts
BONN, West Germany — The Soviet Union yesterday called for
dismantling all of the world's tactical nuclear arms — those with
ranges of less than 300 miles — but said that negotiations on such
weapons could be postponed for a while.
"We are for a complete elimination of tactical nuclear means,
which would be in accordance with the inherent interests of all
Europeans," Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said in
a speech at a state dinner last night during a two-day visit to Bonn.
Shevardnadaze's declaration confirmed long-held expectations
within the Western alliance that Moscow would press for a "third
zero option" providing for dismantling all of the world's shortest
range nuclear weapons.
The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed last
month in Washington, embodies what is called the "double zero
option," because it provides for scrapping all nuclear missiles in
two range categories: from 300 to 600 miles, and from 600 to 3500
miles.
But NATO opposes a "third zero option," because it believes
that it is necessary to keep some tactical, or battlefield-range,
nuclear weapons as a deterrent in view of the Warsaw Pact's
perceived superiority in conventional, or non-nuclear, arms.
The Soviet Union, since January 1986, has supported elimination
of all of the world's nuclear weapons by the year 2000. But the
Soviets had not previously made a public proposal specifically urging
abolition of tactical nuclear weapons.
Argentine army rebellion ends
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Renegade Lt. Col. Aldo Rico
surrendered yesterday after skirmishes with loyal government forces,
ending a weekend rebellion by disgruntled Argentine army officers.
Three government soldiers were reported wounded in fighting
near a northern infantry regiment that was controlled by Rico until
late afternoon. Mutinies in several other provincial army units and
at an airport in Buenos Aires produced tense confrontations but
ended without shooting.
Thus, the armed forces averted a bloody internal conflict, and
Argentina's four-year-old democracy emerged shaken but intact.
"Democracy in the country is now consolidated, and we have
put order in the house," President Raul Alfonsin said last night.
"This episode has made possible in the Argentine army a restruc
turing that will permit us to work in closer unity."
Rico had emphasized that his rebellion was not aimed at deposing
the government. His main demands were for the resignation of the
army chief of staff and for an amnesty that would free officers
charged with killings, torture and other human rights violations.
Haitian government claims victory
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Supporters of Haiti's army-led
government claimed victory and opponents cried foul yesterday as
incomplete results of Sunday's widely boycotted presidential election
began to trickle in to the capital city.
Scattered partial returns from two of the country's nine provinces
showed conservative candidate Leslie Manigat significantly ahead
of the 10 other candidates, with Gregoire Eugene second, according
to the government-run National Radio.
A spokesman for the four-party opposition coalition that boycotted
the voting called for the results to be declared null and void.
In radio broadcasts yesterday, three of the coalition leaders, Marc
Bazin, Silvio Claude and Gerard Gourgue, denounced the voting
as a "fraud" and a "sham."
According to official and unofficial estimates, between 80 percent
and 93 percent of Haitians stayed away from the polls to protest
manipulation of the election by the provisional government of Lt.
Gen. Henri Namphy.
Acknowledging that a substantial majority of eligible voters stayed
home, the spokesman for the government's handpicked Electoral
Council, which staged the voting, said that "more than 20 percent
participated." The spokesman, Gerard Bretous, said that it might
be several days before a more precise and official count is available.
