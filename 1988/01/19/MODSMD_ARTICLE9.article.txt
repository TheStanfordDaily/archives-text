# Israel seeks new Reagan ideas
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - A senior Is
raeli official urged the Reagan ad
ministration yesterday to shake its
election-year lethargy and propose
"new ideas" to break the deadlock
in the Middle East peace process
because the region is becoming in
creasingly violent and dangerous.
"I don't believe that we can af
ford paralysis," Yossi Belin,
director-general of the Foreign
Ministry, told a small group of
reporters at the Israeli Embassy.
"The question is what is going to
be the price of doing nothing.
Keeping the status quo for 1U or
two years is unrealistic."
Belin, who is in Washington to
meet with high-level administration
officials, said it was futile to expect
either Israel or Jordan to take the
initiative because the level of
mutual mistrust is so high that "if
(Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak)
Shamir suggests something that is
beautiful, the king (of Jordan) will
say that is nothing new ... and
vice versa."
That means, he said, that only
the United States can push the

peace process off dead center. But,
he said, U.S. officials have said that
nothing much can be done until
after the U.S. elections in Novem
ber and Israeli elections expected
earlier in the fall.
"Nothing was done in '87, and
(U.S. officials say) nothing will be
done in '88 because of the elec
tions," he said. "I believe we can't
stick to that way of thinking. We
can't let '88 pass without a political
development even though it will be
much more difficult because of the
elections."
Secretary of State George Shultz
and other administration officials
have become increasingly frustrated
at the failure of Israel and its Arab
neighbors to narrow their differ
ences, despite sometimes intense
U.S. intervention. U.S. officials
have also expressed irritation at the
failure of Israeli government
leaders to agree among themselves
on an approach to the Arab world.
The government is an uneasy coa
lition of the right-wing Likud bloc
and the centrist Labor Alignment.
U.S. officials have said privately

that there is not much Washington
can do without initiative from the
region. Belin maintained that the
administration has it backward: Is
rael and Jordan cannot be expected
to settle their differences without
guidance from the United States.
"The involvement of the United
States in the past two decades was
much more important than ideas
proposed in the Middle East itself,"
Belin said.
Belin is to meet today with Lt.
Gen. Colin Powell, White House
national security adviser, and Rich
ard Murphy, assistant secretary of
state for Near East and South Asian
affairs.
He conferred yesterday with the
chiefs of Israeli consulates around
the United States. It was under
stood that he called the meeting to
instruct the diplomats on ways to
repair the damage to Israel's image
caused by press and television
coverage of Israeli soldiers beating,
tear gassing and sometimes shoot
ing Palestinian demonstrators
during the continuing protests in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

But, in his meeting with
reporters, Belin said that the dis
turbances had done no irreparable
damage either to the American
public's perception of Israel or to
Jerusalem's relationship with the
U.S. government. And, unlike some
other Israeli officials, Belin did not
charge that the press had exagger
ated the situation.
"Eventually the problem that we
have to face is that the ground in
the (occupied) territories was right
for being influenced by the PLO
or the (Moslem) fundamentalists,"
he said.
Belin said it was important for
the administration to continue put
ting forward new ideas for a Middle
East settlement even if the
proposals seem to lead nowhere.
He said that a proposal to invite
Israeli and Jordanian leaders to at
tend last month's Washington sum
mit meeting between President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev "wasn't the best idea â€”
maybe it was impossible from the
beginning."
