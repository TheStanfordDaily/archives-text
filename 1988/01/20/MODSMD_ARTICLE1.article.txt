# Profs, propose alternative W. Culture changes
## 
### Russell Korobkin Frank Quaratiello Staff writers 
A group of 25 humanities and
social science professors brought to
gether by English Prof. William
Chace has formulated and distrib
uted an alternative to proposed leg
islation by the Western Culture
Task Force to change the Univer
sity's Area One requirement.
The group's alternative proposal
calls for a modification of the cur
rent Western Culture program that
would retain a core list of readings,
but would require the various tracks
to read works by women and per
sons of color.
The alternative proposal also
calls for an amendment to the West
ern Culture requirement mandating
the confrontation of "issues relating
to class, ethnicity, race, religion,
gender and sexual orientation" and
directs the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (CUS) to re
examine the University's non-
Western Culture requirement.
"Our proposal mandates, or re
quires, that the core list include
readings by women and persons of
color," Chace said.

Chacc said his group's plan would
make "de jure" something that al
ready exists "de facto." He said
many tracks already include read
ings from women and persons of
color, so his group's proposal is
only mandating what is already
taking place.
CUS Chair Craig Heller called
the Chace group's proposal "essen
tially maintenance of the status quo
with the addition of a few phrases"
about women and minorities.
Chace said his group is planning
to eventually submit its proposal to
the Faculty Senate in an attempt
to block adoption of the task force
legislation.
The new proposal argues that the
way to address complaints about
the lack of attention paid to non-
European cultures in the Area One,
or Western Culture, requirement is
through the "establishment of
rigorous courses dealing directly
with those cultures."
In contrast, the task force pro
posal, which is scheduled to be con
sidered by the Faculty Senate to
morrow, seeks to abolish the core
list mandated by the original West
ern Culture Program charter and
to rename the requirement Culture,

Ideas and Values (CIV). In addi
tion, the task force proposal man
dates the study of at least one non-
European culture and works by
women and minorities.
Chace criticized the task force
proposal, calling it "very vague" be
cause it "systematically avoids the
question (of specific readings)."
If the task force proposal is
passed, the University will end up
either going back to a core list or
eliminating the Area One require
ment altogether, Chace predicted.
"While we respect the work of
the task force and the CUS, we
feel that their proposed solution is
an extreme one and is ultimately
unnecessary," Chace said.
To Chace and other opponents
of the task force recommendations,
a core list is vitally important to
the Area One requirement because
it assures a common academic ex
perience among freshmen and be
cause they feel that certain works
provide "a bedrock foundation for
becoming an educated person in
any field." Chace said he sees the
core list as "an anchor" for the
Western Culture program.
Task Force Chair Paul Seaver
disagreed with Chace's analysis of
the importance of a list.
"What he's in a sense saying is
that the "A" (core) list defines the
program and nothing else does,"
Seaver said of Chace's position.
"Literature and the Arts (one of
the Western Culture tracks) defines
itself in terms of literature and art,

not in terms of the "A" list," he said.
Seaver argued that the works on
the core list are important, but
added that "nobody claims they are
exhaustive or definitive."
The Chace group's position paper
was distributed to members of the
Faculty Senate last week with a
copy of the task force proposal.
According to Faculty Senate
Chair Gerald Lieberman, the Chace
group proposal will probably be dis
cussed at the senate meeting to
morrow along with the task force
recommendations. He said no vote

will take place on any changes in
the Area One requirement until the
next senate meeting Feb. 4, at the
earliest.
Until last week, opposition to the
task force proposals had seemed
slight and scattered. The emergence
of an organized opposition group
may complicate the approval proc
ess for the legislation, which ap
peared to be headed for easy senate
adoption when it was approved by
the CUS in November.
Neither Heller nor Seaver —
both supporters of the task force

proposal — nor Lieberman would
predict whether the opposition
movement will jeopardize the
chances for passage of the task force
legislation.
Representatives of campus
minority and progressive groups
denounced the Chace group's pro
posal yesterday.
Miguel Marquez, a member of
MEChA, the Chicano student or
ganization, called the plan "ab
surd."
The proposal is "an insult to the
task force and students who have

been working for the changes," said
Stacey Leyton, an ASSU senator
and member of Students United for
a Democratic Education. "It keeps
the program basically the way it is,
with a few tokens thrown in to pla
cate minority groups."

proposal include:

Chace criticized the task force
proposal, calling it "very vague" be
cause it "systematically avoids the
question (of specific readings)."
If the task force proposal is
passed, the University will end up
either going back to a core list or
eliminating the Area One require
ment altogether, Chace predicted.
"While we respect the work of
the task force and the CUS, we
feel that their proposed solution is
an extreme one and is ultimately
unnecessary," Chace said.
To Chace and other opponents
of the task force recommendations,
a core list is vitally important to
the Area One requirement because
it assures a common academic ex
perience among freshmen and be
cause they feel that certain works
provide "a bedrock foundation for
becoming an educated person in
any field." Chace said he sees the
core list as "an anchor" for the
Western Culture program.
Task Force Chair Paul Seaver
disagreed with Chace's analysis of
the importance of a list.
"What he's in a sense saying is
that the "A" (core) list defines the
program and nothing else does,"
Seaver said of Chace's position.
"Literature and the Arts (one of
the Western Culture tracks) defines
itself in terms of literature and art,

not in terms of the "A" list," he said.
Seaver argued that the works on
the core list are important, but
added that "nobody claims they are
exhaustive or definitive."
The Chace group's position paper
was distributed to members of the
Faculty Senate last week with a
copy of the task force proposal.
According to Faculty Senate
Chair Gerald Lieberman, the Chace
group proposal will probably be dis
cussed at the senate meeting to
morrow along with the task force
recommendations. He said no vote

will take place on any changes in
the Area One requirement until the
next senate meeting Feb. 4, at the
earliest.
Until last week, opposition to the
task force proposals had seemed
slight and scattered. The emergence
of an organized opposition group
may complicate the approval proc
ess for the legislation, which ap
peared to be headed for easy senate
adoption when it was approved by
the CUS in November.
Neither Heller nor Seaver —
both supporters of the task force

proposal — nor Lieberman would
predict whether the opposition
movement will jeopardize the
chances for passage of the task force
legislation.
Representatives of campus
minority and progressive groups
denounced the Chace group's pro
posal yesterday.
Miguel Marquez, a member of
MEChA, the Chicano student or
ganization, called the plan "ab
surd."
The proposal is "an insult to the
task force and students who have

been working for the changes," said
Stacey Leyton, an ASSU senator
and member of Students United for
a Democratic Education. "It keeps
the program basically the way it is,
with a few tokens thrown in to pla
cate minority groups."

A group of 25 humanities and
social science professors brought to
gether by English Prof. William
Chace has formulated and distrib
uted an alternative to proposed leg
islation by the Western Culture
Task Force to change the Univer
sity's Area One requirement.
The group's alternative proposal
calls for a modification of the cur
rent Western Culture program that
would retain a core list of readings,
but would require the various tracks
to read works by women and per
sons of color.
The alternative proposal also
calls for an amendment to the West
ern Culture requirement mandating
the confrontation of "issues relating
to class, ethnicity, race, religion,
gender and sexual orientation" and
directs the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (CUS) to re
examine the University's non-
Western Culture requirement.
"Our proposal mandates, or re
quires, that the core list include
readings by women and persons of
color," Chace said.

Chacc said his group's plan would
make "de jure" something that al
ready exists "de facto." He said
many tracks already include read
ings from women and persons of
color, so his group's proposal is
only mandating what is already
taking place.
CUS Chair Craig Heller called
the Chace group's proposal "essen
tially maintenance of the status quo
with the addition of a few phrases"
about women and minorities.
Chace said his group is planning
to eventually submit its proposal to
the Faculty Senate in an attempt
to block adoption of the task force
legislation.
The new proposal argues that the
way to address complaints about
the lack of attention paid to non-
European cultures in the Area One,
or Western Culture, requirement is
through the "establishment of
rigorous courses dealing directly
with those cultures."
In contrast, the task force pro
posal, which is scheduled to be con
sidered by the Faculty Senate to
morrow, seeks to abolish the core
list mandated by the original West
ern Culture Program charter and
to rename the requirement Culture,

Ideas and Values (CIV). In addi
tion, the task force proposal man
dates the study of at least one non-
European culture and works by
women and minorities.
Chace criticized the task force
proposal, calling it "very vague" be
cause it "systematically avoids the
question (of specific readings)."
If the task force proposal is
passed, the University will end up
