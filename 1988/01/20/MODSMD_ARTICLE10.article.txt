# Soviets invite Israeli delegation
## 
### 
MOSCOW â€” The Soviet Union
has agreed to allow Israeli
diplomats to visit Moscow, the first
such delegation permitted in more
than 20 years.
Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov said yesterday
that the Israelis will review the work
of Dutch diplomats who have been
looking after Israeli interests in
Moscow. No date has been set for
the visit, which Gerasimov said was
agreed to during the course of dis
cussions last week in Helsinki.
There have been no Israeli
diplomats in Moscow since 1967,
when the Soviet Union severed re
lations with the Jewish state after
the Six-Day War.
However, Gerasimov said yester
day's announcement does not sig
nify any change in the Soviet atti
tude on restoring diplomatic ties.

Moscow has taken the position that
it will not restore diplomatic rela
tions with Israel until there is a
comprehensive Middle East peace
settlement.
Gerasimov also said the forth
coming visit is not connected with
the presence of the Soviet consular
delegation that has been in Israel
since last July. That delegation was
sent to provide services for Soviet
citizens who live in Israel and to
look into the status of Soviet prop
erty in Israel.
Israel then sought a reciprocal
visit, but Moscow rejected the idea,
contending that there are no Israeli
citizens in the Soviet Union and no
Israeli property.
In Jerusalem, a spokesman for
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir wel
comed word of the Helsinki agree
ment, although he emphasized that

Israel is still not satisfied with the
rate of Soviet Jewish emigration and
that it still wants full diplomatic
relations restored.
Foreign Ministry spokesman
Ehud Gol expressed "regrets that
the Soviet Union again sets condi
tions on renewal of relations be
tween the two countries."
Sources in Jerusalem who asked
not to be identified said that a del
egation of four to five Israeli
diplomats is expected to leave for
Moscow sometime next month.
Present for the talks in Helsinki,
according to Israeli officials in
Jerusalem, were Nimrod Novik,
chief political adviser to Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres, and the
deputy head of the Soviet Foreign
Ministry's Mideast department.
Topics said to have been discussed
included emigration of Soviet Jews

and the Middle East peace process.
Until yesterday, there had been
no public announcement of the
meeting in Helsinki, apparently to
discourage media attention.
Soviet-Israeli diplomacy has
taken a lower profile since envoys
from the two countries first met in
Helsinki in August, 1986, amid
heavy publicity. That meeting broke
up after 90 minutes, with no agree
ment on anything, after the Israelis
tried to put the issue of Jewish
emigration on the agenda.
Israeli sources regarded it as par
ticularly interesting that the Soviets
chose to make yesterday's an
nouncement at a time when Israel
is under fire in the United States
and elsewhere for its handling of
unrest in the occupied territories.
