# Violence grows in South Africa

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - A squad
of gunmen armed with AK-47 assault rifles at
tacked a house in a black township outside the
South African city of Pietermaritzburg and killed
five men, the police reported yesterday.
The incident reflected a further escalation of
the fighting between rival black groups in Natal
province. Four other people, also black, were
shot or stabbed to death in other incidents in
the Pietermaritzburg area, the police said, bring
ing to more than 60 the number of people killed
in Natal in the last three weeks.
Tension has risen sharply in the region with
rumors that Inkatha, the predominantly Zulu
political movement led by Chief Mangosuthu
Gatsha Buthelezi, intends to re-establish its
supremacy in the area under a central govern
ment initiative to restore order by returning
power to tribal chiefs, most of whom are loyal
to Buthelezi.
Inkatha again blamed the Natal clashes, in
which 268 people were killed last year in the

Pietermaritzburg area alone, on the outlawed
African National Congress and the United Dem
ocratic Front. The latter is a national coalition
of anti-apartheid groups that the government
and Inkatha view as the ANC's legal surrogate.
Supporters of the United Democratic Front
say, however, that the fighting has resulted
primarily from Inkatha's efforts to recover the
considerable ground that it lost in the area
because of its conservative stance and that these
attempts, in turn, had sparked a tough resistance
from its opponents.
"Mostly, however, the situation is out of con
trol and has been so for more than five months,"
a black clergyman said by telephone from one
of Pietermaritzburg's embattled townships yes
terday, asking not to be quoted by name. "There
are attacks, reprisals, counter-reprisals ... and
each morning we pick up the bodies."
South Africa police, despite their virtually
unlimited powers under the country's state of
emergency and the sending of re-enforcements

to the area three weeks ago, have so far been
unable even to reduce the violence.
As black youths returned to school in the
area this week, community leaders expressed
their fears that even more serious clashes were
coming between supporters of Inkatha and those
of the United Democratic Front and the African
National Congress.
"When AK's are being used, the violence is
growing, escalating," the black pastor said, ob
serving that most of the weaponry has been
homemade: a deadly assortment of knives, ma
chetes, spears, firebombs and an occasional pis
tol. Police headquarters in Pretoria refused to
provide details of the shooting in which the five
men were killed late Monday in Mpumalanga,
a black shantytown outside Pietermaritzburg.
However, police said they are investigating the
possible involvement of guerrillas belonging to
the African National Congress.
