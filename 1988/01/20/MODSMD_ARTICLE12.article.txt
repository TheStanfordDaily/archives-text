Jewish self-identity will be dif
ficult to maintain in modern
America, Religious Studies Prof.
Arnold Eisen said yesterday at
a lecture sponsored by Hillel,
the Jewish student organization.
Eisen, who spoke to more than
50 students and faculty members
at the Faculty Club, has au
thored two books concerning
Jewish religious ideology in
America.
Although he believes Ameri
can Jews are still in many ways
a unique people, Eisen said they
are losing their group identity
and attributed this decrease to
several factors.
The most important of these
reasons is the Jewish conception
of themselves as a "chosen
people," Eisen said. He said
Jews coming to America were
faced with a dilemma because
"America was already fulfilling
the role as a chosen people in
the place of the Jews."
According to Eisen, Jews are
now faced with the predicament
of both assimilating into Amer
ican culture and considering
themselves "chosen" because of
their religious tradition.
Eisen said this sense of being
God's "chosen people" has al
ways produced a feeling of unity
among Jews, though he noted
that this concept can be
"evasive" and cannot be

"defended by theological evi
dence."
Many Jews have become more
concerned with "fitting into
(American) society," he said,
adding that the level of accept
ance of Jews in America by non-
Jews is higher than it has been
in the past.
"Anti-scmitism thriving from
the 1920s through the '50s has
decreased," diminishing the
need for Jewish unification,
Eisen said.
He urged American Jews to
become more in touch with
Jewish tradition and criticized
American Jewish thought, calling
it "intellectually vacuous." Eis
ner expressed concern that many
Jewish theologians "do not have
a sound foundation in Jewish
thought or tradition," adding
that "God is not a subject for
sermons in the American
synagogue."
He did, however, cite efforts
such as Stanford's Jewish studies
concentration as evidence of
emerging serious American
scholarship on the subject of
Jewish theology and culture.
The future of the American
Jew is uncertain, he said. To
ensure a strong Jewish identity
in America, Eisen suggested
American Jews direct less fund
ing to programs dealing with
anti-semitism and inter-marriage
and more to those concerned
with Jewish education.
