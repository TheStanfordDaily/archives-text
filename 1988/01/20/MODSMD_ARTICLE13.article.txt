# Diplomats praise results of arms talks

Two high-ranking foreign diplomats praised
what they called the "precedent" established by
the recent U.S.-Soviet Intermediate Nuclear
Forces (INF) treaty eliminating medium-range
nuclear weapons in Europe.
Algerian ambassador to the United States
Mohamed Sahnoun and Jaap Ramaker, the
Netherlands' representative to the United Na
tions, spoke with students in Toyon Lounge last
night as part of a series on "Arms Control and
National Security" presented jointly by Toyon
and Stanford-in-Government.
"This is the first time in history that a weapon
already in existence has been completely done
away with," Ramaker said. "There are treaties
against chemical weapons and weapons in cer
tain areas like Antarctica and outer space, but
this is the first treaty to completely do away
with the weapon entirely."
Ramaker said the INF treaty came as a wel

come surprise to Dutch political leaders, who
never expected the Soviets to agree to the pro
posal. "No one ever really thought that the
Soviets would agree to the double-zero option,
whereby each side would eliminate all
intermediate-range nuclear weapons," he said.
"After a lot of delay, Gorbachev surprised a lot
of people and agreed to do away with the
weapons."
Sahnoun said the agreement could be viewed
as a victory for the United States and its allies.
"It looks like the West has come out as the
winner just because the treaty is what the West
was looking for," he said.
Ramaker said that the agreement calls for
strict verification of compliance, forcing the two
parties to "agree to allow the other to look into
what they had agreed to."
According to Ramaker, the elimination of
intermediate-range weapons would also reduce
the Soviet nuclear arsenal far more than it would
that of NATO. According to the INF treaty,
the Soviets had to eliminate launch vehicles

containing a total of 1434 warheads compared
to the 340 warheads mounted on U.S. Pershing
missiles, he said.
Sahnoun, who said he has been active in
Algerian overseas affairs for over 25 years,
pointed out that "to accept verification is some
thing new psychologically for the Soviets. The
INF treay is an interesting psychological step
that needs to be analyzed further."
Ramaker said that although there are nuclear
weapons still in the Netherlands, they are not
banned by the INF treaty.
"We do have nuclear weapons on our soil,
but we do not have a say in the use of them
other than as part of NATO," Ramaker said.
"The Netherlands did not get cruise missiles
and will not get them. We do not have our own
nuclear weapons because of the non
proliferation agreement signed by a number of
nations who believe that without control most
states would have them, which by a theory of
numbers would not be good."
