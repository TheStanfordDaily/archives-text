# Drainage problems cited as cause
## Flooding damages Casa Zapata 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Flooding in the basement of Casa
Zapata over the weekend disrupted
residence programming.
The flooding, which may have
caused thousands of dollars in
damage, forced a temporary reloca
tion of discussion section and
tutorial sessions, the removal of
nine computers and the pulling up
of newly installed carpeting.
This and other drainage, roofing
and maintenance problems have
prompted Casa Zapata Resident
Fellow Tony Burciaga to question
"plans to beautify the kitchen
facilities when there is almost a
foot of water on the top of the
Stern Hall dining area."
Housing and Food Services Di
rector Keith Guy said yesterdav he

was unaware of the flooding and
the Stern Hall problems but said
he "would look into them im
mediately."
Guy said "any major building
problems" would receive greater
and more urgent attention than any
"amenities," such as the long-term
plan to upgrade the Stern kitchen
facilities. He said the issues of
roofing, drainage and upkeep raised
by Burciaga "will be attended to
right away."
Burciaga said maintenance at
Stern was "lax" but added that Uni
versity maintenance was "respo
nsive and sensitive" in sending
people out once the problems were
brought to their attention.
Saturday's rain and a clogged
drain caused partial flooding in the
dance studio and basement study

room. Damage was limited after
the drain was unplugged.
More heavy rains Sunday com
bined with a nearby overflowing
drain to cause water to seep
through a window, soaking the art
studio and computer room.
Peter Harvey, supervisor of
Housing and Administrative Ser
vices, said the flooding was not a
result of neglect but rather a com
bination of the large amount of
rainfall and an incidentally clogged
drain. The Zapata window-well
drains are checked once a week,
he said, noting that several other
minor problems surfaced elsewhere
on campus over the weekend be
cause of the rain.
The clean-up took slightly longer
than usual due to the holiday
weekend, said Harvey. He noted,
however, that once begun, the work

was done "very quickly." The base
ment should be restored to normal
by the end of the week, Harvey said.
The carpet and the underlying
padding have been removed to be
cleaned but may need replacing.
The computers, though unharmed,
have been stored in another room.
The flooded study room had tem
porarily been used to house four
women displaced by the December
closing of Roble Hall, but the new
residents were relocated last week
after unacceptable levels of asbestos
were detected in the room.
According to Harvey, the flood
ing would have proven "disastrous"
if the women were still living there.
Burciaga said he thought the
worst part of the incident was the
waste of "time and energy that
could have been spent more con
structively."
