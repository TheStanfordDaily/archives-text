Since classes resumed at the beginning of this
month, members of the Stanford community have
had ample reason to become increasingly concerned
about the University's regard for their health and
safety.
Coming hard on the heels of the closings of
Roble Hall and the Lou Henry Hoover House
because of structural weaknesses, the University
announced last week it was launching an extensive
investigation of its health and safety policies in
response to charges of misconduct leveled by Jon
Moldestad, an operations manager in the Depart
ment of Health and Safety.
Moldestad's letter accuses the University of waste,
mismanagement, unethical behavior, employee in
timidation and cover-up in the area of health and
safety. Unfortunately, specific information about
the charges remains unknown because the Univer
sity has refused to release the contents of the letter.
At a hastily called press conference last Wed
nesday, the University announced it had hired the
consulting firm SRI International to investigate the
handling of toxic gases, chemical storage, ventilation
and incinerator operations at 10 buildings on
campus.
A number of troubling questions also remain
unanswered regarding the administration's decision
in December to close Roble. University officials
knew as early as last June, after some preliminary
testing, that Roble's walls probably were made of
hollow clay tile rather than reinforced concrete, as
was previously believed.
Because detailed as-built architectural plans for
Roble were lost long ago, University officials have
said they were unable to ascertain the risk. But
how much concern does it show for the health and
safety of students merely to assume year after year
that Roble was structurally safe without the benefit
of any conclusive evidence? Why was extensive
testing of Roble's walls not conducted over the
summer?
Last week, the University announced that the
president's residence, the Lou Henry Hoover House,

was likewise an earthquake hazard, even though
the building's original architect, Birge Clark, had
been warning administrators about the risk for
decades.
This litany of safety gaffes suggests a worrisome
lack of commitment to health and safety on the
part of the University administration.
Also disturbing is the University's lack of candor
in handling the Moldestad affair. Large-scale in
vestigations of this kind seldom are undertaken
without compelling reasons. But so far the Univer
sity has refused to disclose the specific allegations
Moldestad made in his letter. Surely members of
the Stanford community have a right to know if
University facilities pose a serious threat to their
well-being.
At the press conference, the University refused
to identify Moldestad, saying he had requested
anonymity. In fact, however, Moldestad has since
said that University officials told him to "keep
quiet" about his charges. Such behavior calls into
question the University's ability to conduct a com
plete and thorough investigation on its own. Hiring
SRI — which enjoys a close relationship with Stan
ford — to do the investigating is hardly reassuring.
Over the weekend, Palo Alto Fire Chief Bob
Wall demanded that his department be included
in the investigation. He complained that the Uni
versity had failed to report two campus toxic waste
accidents to the fire department, which is respon
sible for providing fire protection to Stanford. Wall's
concerns are both understandable and prudent, but
they do not go far enough.
It is time for the University to invite an outside
governmental agency to thoroughly examine Mol
destad's allegations about Stanford's health and
safety policies and to review the structural sound
ness of the University's facilities and residences.
If the University refuses to do so, students, faculty
and staff members ought to petition a state agency
to intervene. Only this course of action will ensure
that all of the unanswered questions are addressed.
