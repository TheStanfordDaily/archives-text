## Grads opting for greed 
### 
This piece is in response to two recent Daily view
points: Ugo Colella's "Corporate America kills in
dividuality" (Jan. 5) and Robert Jacobsen's "Obligation
of living in society" (Jan. 13). It is true that most of
us will "have to work for a living," as Jacobsen points
out. However, he ignores the very real distinctions
between working just to financially support oneself
and family, working to meet selfish goals beyond basic
needs and using a job as a means of paying back
some sort of debt to society.

The factory workers Jacobsen describes spend long
days in such a harsh work environment not because
they place an inherent value on the creation of truck
loads of consumer goods, but rather because it provides
a means of making money to meet basic needs.
In a sense, these factory workers are like Colella's
corporate employees in that they endure working con
ditions in exchange for what they are paid for doing
their jobs. The fundamental difference, which both
writers seem to ignore, is that college-educated people,
particularly those pedigreed at prestigious institutions
like Stanford, can find many, many ways to "make a
living."
Colella's argument is that graduates are forced into
corporate America, become brainwashed into "doing

what they despise" and then pursue materialistic
pleasures in an attempt to give their lives meaning.
With regard to Stanford students, I believe this line
of reasoning is incorrect and largely backward.
Corporations recruit students by offering materialis
tic rewards for labor: money, status, opportunities for
power and financial security. These are the top
priorities of a large majority of today's students. To
cite one source, The New York Times recently reported
that in an American Council on Education survey of
200,000 college freshmen, over 70 percent said they
attended college to "make more money" and pointed
to "being financially well off' as their key goal. It is
because of these values, not because of any coercion
by corporations or an innate desire to better society,
that most students choose their jobs. That is,
materialism is most often the cause, not the result,
of corporate careers.
Perhaps those who accept high-paying corporate
jobs merely for the financial rewards believe that, as
Jacobsen suggests, they are merely "working for a
living." In reality, these people are first and foremost
pursuing their material desires, not working to meet
their basic needs.
In any case, if after leaving Stanford we choose to
work in a corporation because of the money and
perquisites it provides, then we must consciously accept
responsibility for our decision.
