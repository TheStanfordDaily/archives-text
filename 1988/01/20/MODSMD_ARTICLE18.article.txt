Bug Me column
was insulting
to the disabled

This letter is in response to The
Daily's insensitive "Bug Me"
column, "The intrepid Bug goes out
on a (lost) limb" (Jan. 12).
I usually find "Bug Me" very
humorous, but why the author
wrote on amputations and how his
questionable scribblings got past the
editor is beyond my understanding.
His own words, "this is the most
disgusting question I have received
.. . which is why 1 have chosen to
answer it," are no justification for
treating an issue such as amputation
in a crude and unfeeling manner.
His bad jokes and light-hearted
manner reflect poorly on the judg
ment and sensitivity of the Stanford
community.
First of all, something as devas
tating as actually losing a limb due
to accident or disease is not a sub
ject to joke about. The comments
about amputated limbs showing up
in Food Service are indecent, as is
the illustration of a leg mounted as
a trophy item. I wonder how the
writer would respond to an article
such as this after having experi
enced the physical and emotional
pain and trauma of living through
an amputation.
Secondly, the author seems to
think that undergoing an amputa
tion is something a person docs by
choice â€” "I don't know about you,
but the thought of having a doctor
cut through my femur with a power
saw does not make my list of top-10
fun activities."
This type of statement neglects
to go into detail about the perma
nent disability and stigma that ac

companies an amputation and how
the individual's life is affected not
only by the reality of the disability
but by the aggravation from an in
sensitive and unnecessary article
put forth in a question-and-answer
column.
The column ends with the lovely
phrase, "Gag me with a power saw."
If he continues to write such trash
in the future, I would like to.

Israel column
simplistic and
sensationalized

In his latest column, "Peace Plan
for Palestine" (Daily, Jan. 13), Al
exander Rawls boldly tries to
analyze and solve Israel's problems
in the space of a 10-inch column.
He concludes that Israel is an "apa
rtheid" state and that all freedom
loving people should condemn it.
In his column, Rawls professes
his dislike for President Reagan.
Yet Rawls shows he is a child of
the Reagan era by attempting to
define the complex problems of the
Middle East in terms of simple
slogans and stretched analogies.
Israel, for all its faults, is a
country in which all its citizens,
Jewish and Arab, have full rights,
including the right to vote and to
protest. Whatever it is, it is not an
apartheid state.
The problem of the occupied ter
ritories is complex. Its solution does
not lie in sensationalized, USA
Today-type columns such as
Rawls's. It lies in extensive research
of the problems, as well as in patient
negotiation among the pertinent

parties. It cannot be solved over
night.

Garrison story
didn't address
all the issues

The Daily's front page article on
congressional candidate Jim Gar
rison (Jan. 13) was not very in
formative. The writer told us that
Garrison was an international busi
ness consultant, but it failed to pro
vide any details about his affiliation,
background or age.
Garrison's experience is with the
Esalen Institute's Soviet exchange
program (Times Tribune, Jan. 13.)
Was this information omitted from
the article for a reason? The
reporter should be trying go inform
the reader, not write PR for the
candidate. Even though The Daily
is a student newspaper, it should
still strive for credibility.
I believe your paper would be
doing the community a greater ser
vice by addressing the issue of why
the Democrats have been unwilling
to run a strong candidate for this
congressional scat, in effect forfeit
ing the district to the Republicans.
Perhaps The Daily could encourage
someone from the Stanford com
munity to enter the race. Then the
voters of this district could have a
real choice.
It would be a shame if the Dem
ocratic failure to run a strong can
didate resulted in the re-election
of Rep. Ernie Konnyu.
