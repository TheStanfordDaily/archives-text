# Co-ops convenient, cost-effective
## 
### 
Stanford dormitory residents live in a very
unique environment. All of their basic needs
are met for them. Food Service cooks for them,
maids clean up after them and RAs are surrogate
parents for them.

This sheltered environment is in sharp con
trast to the rest of society. Everyone else, unless
he is wealthy enough to afford a maid and a
cook, is forced to take care of himself. This
system encourages elitist thinking; there are stu
dents, and there are servant workers.
Workers are nameless and faceless, existing
only to serve students and clean up after their
parties. This situation encourages laziness and
disrespect for real work. While the current dor
mitory and cafeteria system may have made
sense back when most college students were
wealthy, with servants at home to match those
at school, it is anachronistic now.
Fortunately, at Stanford there are alternatives:
co-ops and, to a lesser extent, self-ops. In the
co-operatives, everyone takes turns doing the
cooking and cleaning. People take care of them
selves. There are no nameless, faceless workers
to clean up after parties.
Co-ops have many advantages over dorms:
They are extremely efficient; co-op board bills

average about 40 percent of what Food Service
charges. This is a savings of roughly $600 per
quarter. Over a year, that will pay for a very
nice summer vacation in Europe.
Of course, you do have to work — generally
from three to five hours a week. But, for this
work, you are saving $10 to $15 per hour. This
"wage" is so high because co-ops are very effi
cient. "Management" decisions are made on a
local level; there is no bloated bureaucracy to
be paid.
Co-op residents also have much more freedom
to arrange their lives. Co-op kitchens are always
open. If you get hungry at 3 a.m., you go
I downstairs and fix yourself something to eat.
And for breakfast or lunch you eat what you
want to eat, not what Food Service decides you
want.
For dinner, if you aren't thrilled by the se
lection, there is always plenty of other food
around. It is easy to invite friends to dinner;
most co-ops have very liberal guest policies. If
you want to miss dinner, cook crew can save
you some dinner or you can cook something
yourself. Likewise, taking food for a picnic lunch
in the park is no problem.
These things are possible because in co-ops
decisions are made at a very local level. Co-ops
make their own rules and set their own
schedules. Decision-making is often incredibly
informal. If you especially liked dinner, you tell
your friend who cooked it. If enough people do
that, he'll probably make it again. Likewise, if
you love avocados, for example, you can usually
convince the food manager to order them. The
informality and small scale make co-ops far more
flexible than other groups.
Of course, this tremendous freedom does have

a price. Co-op residents have to take responsi
bility for their lives. Someone has to take re
sponsibility for ordering food, cooking and clean
ing. While this does take time, it can also be
a welcome change from studying. It is much
easier to keep finals in perspective when you
realize that 60 people are depending on you to
cook dinner.
Unfortunately, co-ops have a reputation on
campus for housing flower children who cat
nothing but granola and sprouts. Some co-op
residents fit this description, but there arc also
many pre-meds, engineers, physicists and
economists. On the whole, co-op residents arc
extremely successful, both at Stanford and later.
At Hammarskjold, a co-op with 26 residents,
there are three ex-Hammies currently at UCSF
Medical School.
A good percentage of the undergrads make
Phi Beta Kappa. On a more adventurous note,
a former Hammie organized the last two Amer
ican Mount Everest expeditions. This very varied
mixture makes co-ops useful for breaking down
stereotypes. Before I joined a co-op, I thought
all undergraduates did nothing but party and
go to football games. Now, I only feel that way
about undergrads who don't live in co-ops.
For those who consider co-ops to be too
different, there are also self-operated houses.
The self-ops work quite a bit like co-ops, cxccpt
that they hire a cook. Residents do the cleaning
and help with the cooking. Sometimes, self-ops
pay residents to clean and hash. The main dif
ference is that there is someone around to plan
the meals and direct the cooking. Bccause of
this, self-ops are considerably more. expensive
than co-ops, although they arc still much cheaper
than University-run Food Service.

Stanford dormitory residents live in a very
unique environment. All of their basic needs
are met for them. Food Service cooks for them,
maids clean up after them and RAs are surrogate
parents for them.

This sheltered environment is in sharp con
trast to the rest of society. Everyone else, unless
he is wealthy enough to afford a maid and a
cook, is forced to take care of himself. This
system encourages elitist thinking; there are stu
dents, and there are servant workers.
Workers are nameless and faceless, existing
only to serve students and clean up after their
parties. This situation encourages laziness and
disrespect for real work. While the current dor
mitory and cafeteria system may have made
sense back when most college students were
wealthy, with servants at home to match those
at school, it is anachronistic now.
Fortunately, at Stanford there are alternatives:
co-ops and, to a lesser extent, self-ops. In the
co-operatives, everyone takes turns doing the
cooking and cleaning. People take care of them
selves. There are no nameless, faceless workers
to clean up after parties.
Co-ops have many advantages over dorms:
They are extremely efficient; co-op board bills

average about 40 percent of what Food Service
charges. This is a savings of roughly $600 per
quarter. Over a year, that will pay for a very
nice summer vacation in Europe.
Of course, you do have to work — generally
from three to five hours a week. But, for this
work, you are saving $10 to $15 per hour. This
"wage" is so high because co-ops are very effi
cient. "Management" decisions are made on a
local level; there is no bloated bureaucracy to
be paid.
Co-op residents also have much more freedom
to arrange their lives. Co-op kitchens are always
open. If you get hungry at 3 a.m., you go
I downstairs and fix yourself something to eat.
And for breakfast or lunch you eat what you
want to eat, not what Food Service decides you
want.
For dinner, if you aren't thrilled by the se
lection, there is always plenty of other food
around. It is easy to invite friends to dinner;
most co-ops have very liberal guest policies. If
you want to miss dinner, cook crew can save
you some dinner or you can cook something
yourself. Likewise, taking food for a picnic lunch
in the park is no problem.
These things are possible because in co-ops
decisions are made at a very local level. Co-ops
make their own rules and set their own
schedules. Decision-making is often incredibly
informal. If you especially liked dinner, you tell
your friend who cooked it. If enough people do
that, he'll probably make it again. Likewise, if
you love avocados, for example, you can usually
convince the food manager to order them. The
informality and small scale make co-ops far more
flexible than other groups.
Of course, this tremendous freedom does have

a price. Co-op residents have to take responsi
bility for their lives. Someone has to take re
sponsibility for ordering food, cooking and clean
ing. While this does take time, it can also be
a welcome change from studying. It is much
easier to keep finals in perspective when you
realize that 60 people are depending on you to
cook dinner.
Unfortunately, co-ops have a reputation on
campus for housing flower children who cat
nothing but granola and sprouts. Some co-op
residents fit this description, but there arc also
many pre-meds, engineers, physicists and
economists. On the whole, co-op residents arc
extremely successful, both at Stanford and later.
