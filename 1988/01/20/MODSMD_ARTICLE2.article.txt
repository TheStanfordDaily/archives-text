## Students plan 'silent vigil' at Fac Senate 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Members of six campus minority and progressive
groups will stage a "silent vigil" outside the Faculty
Senate meeting tomorrow to express support for pro
posed changes in the Western Culture requirement.
Students from the Stanford Organization for Lesbian
and Gay Equality, the Black Student Union, the
Chicano group MEChA, the Asian American Students
Association, the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion and Students United for a Democratic Education
will demonstrate at the Law School as "a show of
support for the task force proposal," said senior Stacey
Leyton, a SUDE member.
The Faculty Senate is scheduled to debate the West
ern Culture Task Force proposal for a new requirement
titled "Cultures, Ideas and Values." CIV would include
the study of works from at least one European culture
and at least one non-European culture, as well as
works from women and persons of color. The core
reading list currently used in Western Culture classes
would also be abolished under the task force proposal.
The groups involved stressed that the vigil is not a
protest but rather an "educational activity" designed
to "show the Faculty Senate that students care" about
the Western Culture debate, according to junior Derick
Lin, AASA Issues Committee chairman. Lin estimated
that 10 AASA members would be involved in the vigil.
MEChA member Miguel Marquez, a junior, outlined
the plans for the demonstration. "The students will
form a line that the professors have to walk through"
as they enter the meeting, Marquez explained.
"The key (to the passage of the proposal) is student
support.. .. We (MEChA) are pretty excited about
showing that the bulk of students do care" about the
proposal, Marquez added.
Leyton characterized the current Western Culture
Task Force proposal as a compromise, but said it was
a step in the right direction. "Although we're not fully
satisfied, the current proposal is a compromise pro
posal, and it opens the door to more new tracks that
will produce further change," she said. Leyton added
that SUDE would "prefer a stronger proposal" because
the task force proposal "doesn't force the tracks to
change."
Marquez also said MEChA is somewhat dissatisfied
with the proposal, especially with the preamble, which
defines the purpose of the document.
"The whole preamble is still there, but it has been
split in two, and the rationale behind the proposal is
no longer in the statement that would appear in the
listings," he said.
Although MEChA would like to see the preamble
"sealed back together," Marquez said "it will be easier
to pass the proposal with the way it is now, and this
is the best alternative" to the current Western Culture
program.
According to Leyton, participants in the vigil will
hold signs with "ideas, quotes, books and names"
representing thinkers whose works are "overlooked"
in the current Western Culture tracks.
Last spring, a demonstration was staged outside the
Law School by many of the same groups urging that
the Western Culture requirement be changed. Led by
presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, who was visiting
campus in commemoration of Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday, students chanted "Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Western Culture has got to go."
