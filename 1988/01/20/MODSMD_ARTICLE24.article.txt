# Romance is set at Stanford
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
The reaction is always the same
when a Stanford student first sees
the book. First they notice the pink
cover with the single red rose and
the spine with an oval-shaped paint
ing of a glamorous blonde, and then
they see the airbrushed inside cover
with a stunning couple groping in
front of a red-tiled dormitory.
Then they notice the golden Stan
ford pendant that forms the "O"
in the title, "Roommates."
Gradually they realize that the book
is a romance novel set at Stanford.
Frequently they have to be
helped off the floor.
"Roommates" (Zebra Books,
$4.50), which could be generously
described as a trashy, soft-core
romance novel, details the lives and
loves of five Stanford students as
they romp playfully through their
undergraduate years from 1970 to
1974 and beyond (particularly ro
mantic years on the Farm, it would
appear).
Carrie is a pudgy, wide-eyed
freshman who lives in Lagunita.
Stephen is her older brother, a
junior: "Carrie realized that without
Stephen she would be unable to
negotiate the mechanics of regis
tering, of finding her room, of car
rying her luggage." Yeah, Carrie,
tough stuff.
Megan is Carrie's roommate, a
blonde freshman actress sex kitten
from Malibu. "To Megan, virginity
was something to get over, like
braces or the measles ..the an
tithesis of Carrie, who can't find
her room without a search party.
Beth is Carrie's other roommate,
a too prim and proper applied
physics and aeronautics whiz from
Houston. "Beth hated many things:
trivial conversations, giggling silly
girls, giggling silly boys, poor taste.
But the thing she hated the most
was being touched."
Jake is Stephen's roommate and
Megan's love slave, so to speak.
Joining the army at 17 with an ac
cent thicker than Carrie's hips and
without a high school diploma, he
loses a thigh in Vietnam (I swear
this is true; he has a leg with a
thigh missing) but is nursed back
to health by the wife of an army
general who teaches him enough
English, history and literature for
him to enroll at Stanford. Plausi
bility is not this novel's strong point.
Finding a plot for these charac

ters to perform is about as easy as
finding an English-speaking TAin
the Math Department. It's your
basic adult-fiction romance novel
written in incredibly mediocre
prose. Sprinkled throughout with
sexual interludes, "Roommates"
nevertheless avoids hard-core por
nographic trysts.
Stanford readers should scoff at
the descriptions of campus life in
the book. Dorms have candlelit sit
down dinners every Sunday, women
in Lagunita sit by their phones
waiting for dates to call, the campus
switchboard shuts off at 10 p.m.
and Lake Lagunita is full in Sep-

tember. Take this passage: "They
had heard about the notorious Stan
ford Dollies, those beautiful, liberal,
Southern California blondes.. .
Most would picture author Kath
erine Stone as the stereotypical
romance writer: a 45-year-old
housewife with three kids and two
cats who sits every day in front of
her manual typewriter making up
details about love at Stanford.
But Katherine Stone is actually
the pseudonym of Barbara Kirby,
a 1970 graduate of Stanford who
majored in English. Kirby, who
went to medical school following
her graduation, is an infectious dis
eases specialist in Milwaukee.
"Using the pseudonym was part
of the fantasy of writing the book,"

says first-time author Kirby, "and I
picked the name 'Stone' so I would
be next to Danielle Steele on the
racks." Unfortunately for Kirby,
"Roommates" doesn't contain
enough graphic sex to be classified
a romance, so instead has been
relegated to the general fiction sec
tion of most bookstores, far away
from Ms. Steele.
She admits to writing water into
Lake Lag in the Fall ("It just
wouldn't be romantic to look out
the window onto a dry lake bed")
and to changing Roble's name to
Lagunita ("I had it as Roble in the
first draft but didn't want all the
readers to pronounce it 'Robel' "),
but Kirby defends the rest of the
details in the book.
Things were very different in
1970, she says. Roble was the
women's dorm, Sunday dinners
were sit-down candlelit affairs and
the phones went off promptly at
10. After 10, pajama parties in
Roble were rampant. (Roble was a
popular dormitory on campus that
was closed in 1987.) It was the be
ginning of the Conservative Era,
but you could still visit the Fillmore
in the city to hear bands like the
Doors and Jefferson Airplane.
Kirby has traveled around the
country to give talks in her medical
field and has published papers in
medical journals; "Roommates"
was her first foray into fiction.
Despite the pseudonym, Kirby
makes no effort to hide her real
identity. "My colleagues know I
wrote it," she says,"and they like
it."
Despite it's less-than-beautiful
prose, "Roommates" has sold ex
tremely well. Although it is just
hitting the Bay Area (copies are
available in the Stanford Book
store), the book is already in its
second printing. Her second and
third novels, "Carleton Club," set
in San Francisco, and "Twins," are
due out shortly from Zebra Books.
Kirby says she wrote the book
partly because of a deal she made
with her Stanford boyfriend, Gary,
20 years ago. Each of them
promised they would dedicate their
first book to the other, and, al
though they have since gone their
separate ways, the dedication does
indeed read, "To Gary, because a
promise is a promise."
"And it's not Gary Hart," she
says with a giggle.
