## Weight-loss programs aim to change students' habits 
### Vivian Rogers Staff writer 
It's come to that time of year
again when many students feel
they have to lose 10 pounds
before they'll be seen in a swim
ming suit during spring break at
Mazatlan.

But how do you lose weight
when you live off Food Service
entrees and hunger after choco
late chip cookies from the Book
store?
Although Cowell Student
Health Center doesn't offer an
all-you-can-eat diet plan, they do
have two programs guaranteed to
improve students' eating habits.
For motivated students who
may only need occasional encour
agement, In The Mail, a weight
program started three years ago
through Cowell's Health Promo
tion, provides information and
basic encouragement for sticking
with a healthy diet.
For others more inclined to
cheat without greater incentives,
Cowell's Counseling and Psycho
logical Services (CAPS) offers
weight-management groups or
one-on-one counseling with a
nutritionist.
Both programs try to change
life-long eating habits by teaching
sensible eating patterns that
reduce the intake of fat calories
from carbohydrates.
"Almost every American eats
too much fat," said Laura
Brainin-Rodriguez, a nutritionist
at CAPS. "Stanford students are
no exception."
"The concept of 'on a diet'
should be removed, " said Ana
Kozlowski, a health promotion
specialist at Cowell and organizer
of In The Mail. "It suggests that
you can go back to your old eating

habits after quickly losing
weight."
Although more women than
men tend to participate in these
programs, men often join both
and do well in losing weight and
changing their eating habits, Koz
lowski said.
Cowell's In The Mail sends in
formation packets on weight loss,
nutrition and exercise. The em
phasis is on using better eating
habits and exercising to slowly
lose weight and maintain losses.
"We inform students that
eating well is not boring," Koz
lowski said. "The key issue is
moderation, so there is room for
the 'I can't live without' food."
The weight management group
at CAPS meets once a week and
is led by Brainin-Rodriguez.
During the sessions, participants
keep records of what food they
eat and discuss different psycho
logical aspects of eating.
"The group will basically lead
the discussions," Brainin-
Rodriguez said. "Subjects can
range from how people personally
feel about their weight to how to
deal with large parties or din
ners."
The basic tenet of the group
will be affirmation. This is the
process of assisting your body
through maintaining a positive
outlook. According to Brainin-
Rodriguez, many of the people
who come to the group have been
discouraged by many other diets
and have negative feelings about
their ability to correct their weight
problems.
Brainin-Rodriguez said she also
sees about 30 people a year for
one-on-one consultations. "I can
meet with them from once-a-week
to once-a-month according to
their needs," she said.
Both women said they dis
courage trying to lose weight fast.
They recommend losing only two
pounds per week. "If someone
thinks that is too easy," Kozlowski
said, "they should remember all
those weeks they didn't lose two
pounds."
For many, dorm food has ac
tually made it easier to gain

weight on a weekly basis. Many
students who have come to
Cowell or CAPS for weight loss
have complained about the
entrees at Food Service. "Dorm
food choices can be bewildering
if you are trying to eat sensibly,"
Brainin-Rodriguez said.
A CAPS survey shows that stu
dents consume up to 2800 calories
a day by eating Food Service
entrees. Although this is the rec
ommended daily allowance for
men, it is over the daily allowance
for women, which is 2000 calories.
Kozlowski's office is currently
working with Stern Food Service
to improve the menu. Soon Stern
will offer a nutritional and edu
cational program that will include
low fat entrees at lunch and din
ner. The program will try to lower
the fat content in these entrees
from 40 percent or above to only
30 percent or lower.
A person's percentage of body
fat is the best way to determine
if he or she is overweight. Ac
cording to both Kozlowski and
Brainin-Rodriguez, someone may
seem overweight according to the
scale but will look slim because
they have more muscle than fat.
"I try to encourage that those
in the group throw away their
scales," said Kozlowski, "and look
in the mirror instead."
According to statistics from an
In The Mail packet, a 5-foot-5
woman can have an acceptable
weight of 111 to 142 pounds, de
pending on her muscle-to-fat
ratio, her bone structure and
other factors. The average weight
for her height is 123 pounds. A
man who is 5-9 can have an ac
ceptable weight from 136 to 170,
with an average weight of 149
pounds.
Many students do not know as
much about their diets as they
think, Kozlowski said. "They are
very surprised when we start to
inform them about hidden fats
such as sunflower seeds or olives.
Or when we tell them that their
salad can have up to 2000 calories
once they add dressing, avocados
and bacon bits."

scale but will look slim because
they have more muscle than fat.
"I try to encourage that those
in the group throw away their
scales," said Kozlowski, "and look
in the mirror instead."
According to statistics from an
In The Mail packet, a 5-foot-5
woman can have an acceptable
weight of 111 to 142 pounds, de
pending on her muscle-to-fat
ratio, her bone structure and
other factors. The average weight
for her height is 123 pounds. A
man who is 5-9 can have an ac
ceptable weight from 136 to 170,
with an average weight of 149
pounds.
Many students do not know as
much about their diets as they
think, Kozlowski said. "They are
very surprised when we start to
inform them about hidden fats
such as sunflower seeds or olives.
Or when we tell them that their
salad can have up to 2000 calories
once they add dressing, avocados
and bacon bits."

It's come to that time of year
again when many students feel
they have to lose 10 pounds
before they'll be seen in a swim
ming suit during spring break at
Mazatlan.

But how do you lose weight
when you live off Food Service
entrees and hunger after choco
late chip cookies from the Book
store?
Although Cowell Student
Health Center doesn't offer an
all-you-can-eat diet plan, they do
have two programs guaranteed to
improve students' eating habits.
For motivated students who
may only need occasional encour
agement, In The Mail, a weight
program started three years ago
through Cowell's Health Promo
tion, provides information and
basic encouragement for sticking
with a healthy diet.
For others more inclined to
cheat without greater incentives,
Cowell's Counseling and Psycho
logical Services (CAPS) offers
weight-management groups or
one-on-one counseling with a
nutritionist.
Both programs try to change
life-long eating habits by teaching
sensible eating patterns that
reduce the intake of fat calories
from carbohydrates.
"Almost every American eats
too much fat," said Laura
Brainin-Rodriguez, a nutritionist
at CAPS. "Stanford students are
no exception."
"The concept of 'on a diet'
should be removed, " said Ana
Kozlowski, a health promotion
specialist at Cowell and organizer
of In The Mail. "It suggests that
you can go back to your old eating

habits after quickly losing
weight."
Although more women than
men tend to participate in these
programs, men often join both
and do well in losing weight and
changing their eating habits, Koz
lowski said.
Cowell's In The Mail sends in
formation packets on weight loss,
nutrition and exercise. The em
phasis is on using better eating
habits and exercising to slowly
lose weight and maintain losses.
"We inform students that
eating well is not boring," Koz
lowski said. "The key issue is
moderation, so there is room for
the 'I can't live without' food."
The weight management group
at CAPS meets once a week and
is led by Brainin-Rodriguez.
During the sessions, participants
keep records of what food they
eat and discuss different psycho
logical aspects of eating.
"The group will basically lead
the discussions," Brainin-
Rodriguez said. "Subjects can
range from how people personally
feel about their weight to how to
deal with large parties or din
ners."
The basic tenet of the group
will be affirmation. This is the
process of assisting your body
through maintaining a positive
outlook. According to Brainin-
Rodriguez, many of the people
who come to the group have been
discouraged by many other diets
and have negative feelings about
their ability to correct their weight
problems.
Brainin-Rodriguez said she also
sees about 30 people a year for
one-on-one consultations. "I can
meet with them from once-a-week
to once-a-month according to
their needs," she said.
Both women said they dis
courage trying to lose weight fast.
They recommend losing only two
pounds per week. "If someone
thinks that is too easy," Kozlowski
said, "they should remember all
those weeks they didn't lose two
pounds."
For many, dorm food has ac
tually made it easier to gain

weight on a weekly basis. Many
students who have come to
Cowell or CAPS for weight loss
have complained about the
entrees at Food Service. "Dorm
food choices can be bewildering
if you are trying to eat sensibly,"
Brainin-Rodriguez said.
A CAPS survey shows that stu
dents consume up to 2800 calories
a day by eating Food Service
entrees. Although this is the rec
ommended daily allowance for
men, it is over the daily allowance
for women, which is 2000 calories.
Kozlowski's office is currently
working with Stern Food Service
to improve the menu. Soon Stern
will offer a nutritional and edu
cational program that will include
low fat entrees at lunch and din
ner. The program will try to lower
the fat content in these entrees
from 40 percent or above to only
30 percent or lower.
A person's percentage of body
fat is the best way to determine
if he or she is overweight. Ac
cording to both Kozlowski and
Brainin-Rodriguez, someone may
seem overweight according to the
scale but will look slim because
they have more muscle than fat.
