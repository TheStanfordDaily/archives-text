## 'Moonstruck': pointless but entertaining fluff 
### Jennifer Reese Staff writer 
"Moonstruck" is an undeniably
inane movie, but what's wrong with
a little inanity if it's good company?
The movie is insubstantial and
corny but always good-hearted and
cute. It's a silly piece of froth with
no bite, but for what it's worth it's
enjoyable.
The flimsy story centers on a New
York Italian family, and more spe
cifically on the family's widowed
37-year-old daughter Loretta
(Cher). At the beginning of the
movie Loretta becomes engaged to
a weak Nice Guy, Johnny Cam
mareri (Danny Aicllo), whom she
doesn't love.
Johnny then flies to Italy to be
with his dying mother, and through
various twists of plot Loretta meets
and falls in love with Johnny's sexy
brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage).
Ronny works in the oven room of
the family bakery; he lost his hand
in a bread slicer years ago, blames
Johnny and has never forgiven him.
This is the central romance, but
the movie doesn't dwell on it. In
stead, the movie darts constantly to
side stories, such as the comical
marriage of Loretta's parents and
the renewed sex life of Loretta's
aging aunt and uncle.
The movie never settles long on

one story. It has the quintessential
light touch. It makes a few very
banal comments on love, men,
women and marriage, but even
these are quickly and mercifully al
lowed to evaporate.
There really isn't a profound mo
ment to be found in the movie. The
story just slides down like sugar
water; there's no crescendo of pain
or intensity. The film ends as hap
pily and mildly as it begins. What
has happened? What have we just
eaten? Who knows, but it's sweet
and doesn't leave you too full.
The laughs (and there are a few)
too often comc from playing off
Italian mannerisms and style. The
jokes are frequently stale. If the
family hadn't been Italian, what
would the film-makers have done
for laughs? There isn't much fresh
or exciting humor here.
Cher was probably miscast in the
lead as Loretta. She has heavy
lidded eyes and a hard face that
isn't quite right here. The role
needs a humane, warm, earthy type
— a Dcbra Winger.
Cher isn't a bad actress, but her
persona gets in the way; she's too
sexual and witch-like, even when
she puts on an Italian accent and
has grey streaks in her hair. No
matter how well she acts, she always
comes across as an exotic, tough
broad. She just isn't Loretta.

Her romance with Ronny, played
by Nicholas Cage, is wooden.
There's no perceptible spark be
tween these two actors. Cage does
nothing with his role. Granted, it's
a thankless part, but Cage makes
it worse. He has two facial expres
sions: one for when he's trying to
look brutish and sexual, the other
for when he wants to appear pas
sionate and in love.

'It's a featherweight
movie with fleeting
charm/

As Lorctta's parents, Vincent
Gardenia and Olympia Dukakis
steal the show. Gardenia has a fat,
old baby face, and his grumpiness
is truly funny — it doesn't seem
faked. Just watching him grumble
is terrific.
Dukakis is frank and salty as
Loretta's mother. She stretches her
mediocre lines and makes them
sparkle. These two performances
give the movie whatever glow it has.
The film purports to be about
love and family, but ultimately it
isn't really about anything at all.
It's a featherweight movie with
fleeting charm. It leaves you with
an amused, if indulgent, smile on
your face. Things could be worse.
