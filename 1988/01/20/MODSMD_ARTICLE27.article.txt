# Picking winners from this year's Grammy crop
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
Nominations for the 30th annual Grammy Awards
were announced last Thurday, and we have invited
several of America's most famous prognosticators to
pick their favorites to win the major awards March 2:
CBS News Anchorman Dan Rather: Good evening,
Dan Rather reporting. Steve Winwood's "Back in the
Highlifc Again" was the early favorite to win Record
of the Year honors, but has faded as revelations about
his cheekbones have surfaced. Paul Simon's stand on
South Africa has hurt his "Graceland" in the polls,
while U2 has been fighting the wimp factor with their
confused attitude on "I Still Haven't Found What I'm
Looking For."
Look for Suzanne Vega to parlay her early support
for "Luka" in the lowa caucuses into a win at the

New Hampshire primary; but a surprise block of south
ern hispanic voters could enable Los Lobos' "La Bam
ba" to steal the victory at the Democratic convention
and go on to a convincing victory in the general
election.
For Album of the Year, Prince's "Sign 'o the Times"
is just that, part of a continuing trend toward main
stream acceptance for performers with previously small
followings. Michael Jackson's "Bad" is also self
descriptive, and his late entry into the race should
preclude his picking up enough support to win.
Linda Ronstadt, Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris'
"Trio" could garner strong support from the southern
contingent, except for the fact that it is a country
album, and demographic statistics from the past 29
Grammys indicate that no country album has ever
won in a leap year with a Democratic-controlled House
of Representatives.

Whitney Houston's "Whitney" would win, except
for the fact that it contains basically the same songs
from her first album, only in a different order. There
fore, expect U2's "The Joshua Tree" to coast to an
easy win at the convention for lack of a better can
didate.
Courage.
Jimmy the Greek: Brent, in the category of Best
R & B Vocal Performance, Male, I like Michael Jack
son's "Bad." I know, Smokey Robinson has performed
well the past few weeks with "Just to See Her," and
Jonathon Butler blew out Detroit by 23 points with
"Lies," but you have to remember that Jackson has
far more playoff experience, and who can forget his
"Thrilling" victory in Grammy No. 27?
The one factor that could make it interesting, Brent,
is Stevie Wonder's "Skeletons." Wonder has looked
great in practice this week, and I've never seen anyone
so confident. But still, I'd go with Jackson and give
the points, as he will win the Grammy by a touchdown
March 2.
Dee Snider of Twisted Sister: Hey fellow
headbangers! Welcome to my picks for Best New
Artist. The nominees are: Breakfast Club, a stupid
poseur pop group named after a John Hughes movie;
Cutting Crew, a stupid poseur pop group from some
where in Scandinavia; Terence Trent D'Arby, a stupid
coseur pop singer named after a popular roast beef
restaurant; Swing Out Sister, a stupid poseur pop
group with a strange looking lead singer; and Jody
W-uley, a stupid poseur pop singer with nice legs.
I don't like any of these groups, so I pick Whitesnake
for best new artist. So what if they've had four or
five previous albums; you ever heard a Whitesnake
song before this vear, dude?

Psychic Jeanne Dixon: For Best Pop Vocal Per
formance, Female, I predict Carly Simon's "Coming
Around Again" will lose when it is revealed that Carly
is the child of alien warthogs. Barbra Streisand's "One
Voice" will flounder in the voting after the confirmed
sighting of psychic water buffaloes in her bedroom.
Whitney Houston's "I Wanna Dance With Some
body" would win, except that I see Whitney and Larry
"Bud" Melman tying the knot in early '88. Belinda
Carlisle's "Heaven is a Place on Earth" will come in
a close second, and I predict her performance at the
Grammys will cause a tidal wave that destroys parts
of Kansas.
I predict that Suzanne Vega's "Luka" will not only
win the award, but Ms. Vega will record a duet with
Bigfoot.
House Committee on Un-American Activities: For
Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male, we must first
eliminate Sting's "Bring on the Night," because Sting's
real name is Gordon Sumners, and changing one's
name is Un-American. This also rules out Elton John's
"Candle in the Wind," because Elton's real name is
Reginald Dwight.
Michael Jackson is really Janet Jackson, and vice
versa, so he won't win for "Bad," while A 1 Jarreau is
also Janet Jackson, which rules out "Moonlighting."
This leaves Bruce Springsteen, and you don't get more
American than the Boss. Give him the Grammy for
"Brilliant Disguise."
Strangely, Bruce is also nominated for Best Rock
Vocal for "Tunnel of Love," which isn't any more
rock than "Brilliant Disguise." But hey, this is the
Boss, so give him the Grammy for rock vocal too. In
fact, give him the Grammys for Best Mexican-American
Performance, Best Traditional Blues Recording and
Best Classical Recording as well.
