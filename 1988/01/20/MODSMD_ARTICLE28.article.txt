## Card dropped by San Luis Obispo 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
Chris Horpel, the head coach of
Stanford's wrestling team, sat in the
stands with a grin on his face fol
lowing last night's loss to Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo. Although the Car
dinal lost 22-15 to the Mustangs,
Horpel said he felt his young team
had made an outstanding effort. "I
thought we did great," he said,
Stanford gave up its customary
six points in the form of an 118-
pound forfeit and had 142-pound
James Dinette sidelined with an
ankle injury. The healthy members
of the squad filled in and made a
valiant effort to restrain Cal Poly,
which had won a tournament at
Cal State-Fullerton earlier this
season.
Stanford's dual meet record has
not been overly impressive, but a
team victory at the Aggie Invita
tional Tournament in Davis last
weekend, highlighted by four indi
vidual championships, gave the Car
dinal squad momentum heading
into last night's encounter.
Loren Vigil, a freshman who
came to Stanford boasting second-,
third- and fifth-place finishes in his
New Mexico state meets, went
against junior John Galkowski. Vigil
held a two-point lead going into
the final seconds of his match but
was taken down with :06 left on
the clock to finish the period in a
4-4 tie. Both teams were allotted
two points, negating their respective
gains, and the meet went into the
next weight bracket with Cal Poly
up 8-2.
"I should have had it â€” that's
all," Vigil said in reference to his
opponent's late comeback.
Josh Lisle was next on the mat,
representing Stanford's 134-pound
division. Lisle gained an advantage
on senior Darren Rodriguez, who
was wrestling "up a weight" for Cal
Poly due to an injury to the Mustang
starter.
Wrestlers are allowed to ascend
in brackets as long as they maintain
a certain minimum weight. In this
case the weight disadvantage
proved to be too much for the Mus
tang, as Lisle rode Rodriguez re
lentlessly until the match ended
with Lisle on top 11-4.

Replacing the injured Dinette
was reserve freshman Mike Rehder,
who grappled with Cal Poly's John
Martin. In his first collegiate varsity

match, Rchder was taken down and
released until Martin had gained a
15-point advantage, which earned
Cal Poly a technical fall and five
team points.
Sophomore Geoff Baum at
temped to defend against the
onslaught of Cal Poly's Cordell
Baker but ended the 150-pound
match with a 10-3 decision in
Baker's favor.
With the meet score at 16-8 in
Cal Poly's favor, 158-pound sopho
more Steve Yarbrough stepped
onto the mat to challenge senior
Malcolm Boykin. Yarbrough per
formed the move of the night by
picking up Boy kin's leg and
maneuvering him into what ap
peared to be a push and a shove
and a two-point takedown.
Yarbrough held onto his lead
through the final period to win the
match with a one-point advantage
4-3.
Freshman Steve Buddie contin

ued the rally for the Cardinal. Com
peting against freshman Sean
Bentsen, Buddie gave a shutout
performance to win the 167-pound
bracket 9-0. Buddie, who is from
Ohio, posted a fourth-place and
runner-up finishes in his high school
state tournament. He has been one
of the most consistent performers
on an unusually young Cardinal
team, and last night's effort brought
the meet score to 19-12, Cal Poly's
advantage.
At 177 pounds, Ron Perry com
peted against Anthony Romero.
Perry had lost to Romero earlier
in his career but showed improve
ment by bringing the match to
within a point before losing, 5-4.
"He looked a lot closer this time,"
said Horpel.
With Stanford down by seven
points, senior Terry Mclntyre
stepped onto the mat to grapple
with sophomore Rick Ravilin.
Mclntyre put Ravilin into a "front

headlock" and earned what
wrestlers term "investment points"
(because of the intimidation and
pain involved in the move) before
taking Ravilin down and finishing
the match with a two-point lead 7-5.
"It was a bit sloppy," said
Mclntrye in reference to his victory.
"I gave up way too many points."
Mclntyre is the only senior starter
on a young Stanford team that is
composed otherwise of three fresh
men and five sophomores. This
should secure a promising future
for Stanford's wrestling program, as
Horpel continues to comb the
country for qualified recruits.
The heavyweight matchup came
with the Cardinal down 19-15 in
team points. A major decision (win
ning a match by 8-14 points) would
have given Stanford the upset vic
tory.
