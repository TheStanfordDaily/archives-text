# Columnist reviews a sports-filled day
## 
### 
I spent a sports-filled Saturday
at the East-West Shrine Game,
then at the Stanford basketball
game against Washington State.
(I also watched California play
Washington on TV", but Cal bas
ketball is kind of difficult to clas
sify as a sport these days.)

Many questions arose during
the day.
First of all, in Stanford's 70-68
loss to Washington State:
• Why didn't Stanford call a
timeout when Cougar guard
David Sanders hit a 3-point shot
with 10 seconds left?
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery explained that he
thought the team would have a
better chance of scoring if they
took the ball out of bounds right
away, got the ball up the court
and got the offense set up for
one shot. But there was obvi
ously hesitation about what to
do, and the Cardinal lost its
chance — and the game. A time
out would have at least
eliminated any confusion about
what play the team was running.
• Why not foul one of the Wash
ington State players with about
30 seconds left and Stanford
leading 68-67? The most the
Cougars could do is go up by
one (if the foul was not ruled
intentional), and the Cardinal
would have had enough time to
get off a good shot.
Ok, I know it's generally not
a good idea to foul when your
team is ahead, but Washington
State had already demonstrated
that it could use the shot clock
masterfully and could sink 3-
pointers almost at will. It was
virtual suicide to let the clock
get down that low and then let
Sanders get his hands on the
ball. It's always better to be in

a position to win the game rather
than lose it.
• Why wasn't Todd Lichti on
Sanders? Sanders was shooting
over the shorter guys and beating
taller opponents by a step. Lichti
is only two inches taller than
Sanders but is quick and has
great leaping ability. Mont
gomery felt he needed Lichti to
guard Brian Wright, or Wright
would kill the Cardinal from out
side. But by the end of the game
it was pretty obvious who was
really doing the damage and who
would take the final shot.
• Was that intentional foul called
on Terry Taylor really intention
al? Was it really even a foul?
From where I was sitting it
looked 1) like Taylor went for
the ball and 2) swiped at An
thony Kidd but didn't touch him.
• How did Sanders get that of
fensive rebound in the lane
against three guys all over five
inches taller than he is?
The Shrine Game also brought
numerous questions to mind.
• Why didn't Brad Muster get
the ball more? Carrying or catch
ing the football is obviously his
forte, not blocking. Plus, Muster
is one of the most enjoyable
players in the country to watch.
It's too bad the 62,000 fans and
scouts at Stanford Stadium Sat
urday didn't get to see him do
much more than block.
You'd think West Offensive
Coordinator Claude Gilbert,
who is the coach at San Jose
State, would realize that Muster
is not a blocking back and that
a lot of people probably wanted
to see him perform. Of course,
Muster was mostly blocking for
San Jose State running back
Kenny Jackson, a Gilbert
protege.
• Why don't they invite punters
to the game? Neither team had
a punter, and it was ridiculous
watching the kickers trying to
perform the punting chores. East
kicker Chip Lohmiller of Min
nesota was particularly pathetic
and probably cost the East the
game by consistently giving the


Susan
Slusser
West excellent field position.
How tough or expensive (proba
bly the real problem) can it be to
add a pair of punters to the roster?
The Bay Area had two of the top
three punters in the nation this year
in Stanford's Doug Robison (No. 2
in the country) and Cal's Scott
Tabor (No. 3). Tom Tupa of Ohio
State led the nation in punting and
would have been a perfect choice
for the East.
Professional scouts are interested
in all three; why not let them show
case their talents in an all-star game
along with the other top college
football players in America? What's
the point in discriminating against
punters, of all people?
• Was there any position that Holy
Cross star Gordie Lockbaum didn't
play? He played all four spots in

the defensive backfield, along with
fullback, flanker and split end.
Maybe the East should have tried
him out at quarterback; that's
where they were having the most
problems.

Why discriminate
against punters, of
all people?

• Have you ever seen extensive use
of stepladders in a halftime show
before? The Kilgore College Ran
gerettes choreographed their per
formance using about 25 small lad
ders. It was actually pretty good.
A "step up" from other halftime
shows, you might say.
• Why do Shriners wear such silly
hats, and what exactly is a poten
tate?

and got the offense set up for
one shot. But there was obvi
ously hesitation about what to
do, and the Cardinal lost its
chance — and the game. A time
out would have at least
eliminated any confusion about
what play the team was running.
• Why not foul one of the Wash
ington State players with about
30 seconds left and Stanford
leading 68-67? The most the
Cougars could do is go up by
one (if the foul was not ruled
intentional), and the Cardinal
would have had enough time to
get off a good shot.
Ok, I know it's generally not
a good idea to foul when your
team is ahead, but Washington
State had already demonstrated
that it could use the shot clock
masterfully and could sink 3-
pointers almost at will. It was
virtual suicide to let the clock
get down that low and then let
Sanders get his hands on the
ball. It's always better to be in

a position to win the game rather
than lose it.
• Why wasn't Todd Lichti on
Sanders? Sanders was shooting
over the shorter guys and beating
taller opponents by a step. Lichti
is only two inches taller than
Sanders but is quick and has
great leaping ability. Mont
gomery felt he needed Lichti to
guard Brian Wright, or Wright
would kill the Cardinal from out
side. But by the end of the game
it was pretty obvious who was
really doing the damage and who
would take the final shot.
• Was that intentional foul called
on Terry Taylor really intention
al? Was it really even a foul?
From where I was sitting it
looked 1) like Taylor went for
the ball and 2) swiped at An
thony Kidd but didn't touch him.
• How did Sanders get that of
fensive rebound in the lane
against three guys all over five
inches taller than he is?
The Shrine Game also brought
numerous questions to mind.
• Why didn't Brad Muster get
the ball more? Carrying or catch
ing the football is obviously his
forte, not blocking. Plus, Muster
is one of the most enjoyable
players in the country to watch.
It's too bad the 62,000 fans and
scouts at Stanford Stadium Sat
urday didn't get to see him do
much more than block.
You'd think West Offensive
Coordinator Claude Gilbert,
who is the coach at San Jose
State, would realize that Muster
is not a blocking back and that
a lot of people probably wanted
to see him perform. Of course,
Muster was mostly blocking for
San Jose State running back
Kenny Jackson, a Gilbert
protege.
• Why don't they invite punters
to the game? Neither team had
a punter, and it was ridiculous
watching the kickers trying to
perform the punting chores. East
kicker Chip Lohmiller of Min
nesota was particularly pathetic
and probably cost the East the
game by consistently giving the


Susan
Slusser
West excellent field position.
How tough or expensive (proba
bly the real problem) can it be to
add a pair of punters to the roster?
The Bay Area had two of the top
three punters in the nation this year
in Stanford's Doug Robison (No. 2
in the country) and Cal's Scott
Tabor (No. 3). Tom Tupa of Ohio
State led the nation in punting and
would have been a perfect choice
for the East.
Professional scouts are interested
in all three; why not let them show
case their talents in an all-star game
along with the other top college
football players in America? What's
the point in discriminating against
punters, of all people?
• Was there any position that Holy
Cross star Gordie Lockbaum didn't
play? He played all four spots in

the defensive backfield, along with
fullback, flanker and split end.
Maybe the East should have tried
him out at quarterback; that's
where they were having the most
problems.

• Have you ever seen extensive use
of stepladders in a halftime show
before? The Kilgore College Ran
gerettes choreographed their per
formance using about 25 small lad
ders. It was actually pretty good.
A "step up" from other halftime
shows, you might say.
• Why do Shriners wear such silly
hats, and what exactly is a poten
tate?
I spent a sports-filled Saturday
at the East-West Shrine Game,
then at the Stanford basketball
game against Washington State.
(I also watched California play
Washington on TV", but Cal bas
ketball is kind of difficult to clas
sify as a sport these days.)

Many questions arose during
the day.
First of all, in Stanford's 70-68
loss to Washington State:
• Why didn't Stanford call a
timeout when Cougar guard
David Sanders hit a 3-point shot
with 10 seconds left?
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery explained that he
thought the team would have a
better chance of scoring if they
took the ball out of bounds right
away, got the ball up the court
and got the offense set up for
one shot. But there was obvi
ously hesitation about what to
do, and the Cardinal lost its
chance — and the game. A time
