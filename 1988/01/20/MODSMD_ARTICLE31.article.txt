# Stanford's minority coaches are few
## 
### 
Over the weekend Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder
joined the growing cadre of aging sports per
sonalities who have made blatantly racist
remarks.
Just like those of A 1 Campanis, Howard Cosell
and George Steinbrenner, Snyder's comments
were amazingly stupid, insensitive and just flat
out wrong.

Somehow, though, such hysterical racism
seems a little distant from Stanford. While no
one will deny that there are racial problems
here, they don't seem to be rooted in such
blatant and overtly negative sentiments as those
Snyder related.
Yet when one observes the Stanford Athletic
Department it becomes clear that there are
some discrepancies in the level of minority rep
resentation. The concentration here will be on
black representation in light of Snyder's com
ments.
The NFL has 28 teams and no black head
coaches. Stanford has 29 varsity sports and two
black head coaches, Brooks Johnson and Bcr
hane Andeberhan. Granted, Johnson coaches
four teams as the track and cross countrv co-

ordinator, but still only two of Stanford's 25
head coaches are black, and they are the only
two black head coaches Stanford has ever had.
The data on assistant coaches is a little less
clear since there are both full-time and part-time
posts, but of the roughly 25 full-time assistants
only two are black, and only one is involved in
a team sport.
Black representation in Stanford coaching is
therefore alarmingly low, running at less than
10 percent for both assistants and head coaches.
The picture is even bleaker when one looks
at the Athletic Department administration. Here
the administrators are almost entirely white.
The ratios of minority representation are less
than encouraging and portray a white-male
dominated Athletic Department, with few
minorities and a scarcity of women.
The reasons this situation exists are less clear.
While it is specious to believe this highly skewed
racial and sexual ratio is part of any evil design
on the part of the Athletic Department, and
the sample is a small one, the end result still
remains that minorities are not being hired in
any great percentage.
Minorities are certainly qualified. The vast
majority of coaches and administrators are
former athletes themselves, and the pool of
former black athletes is steadily growing larger.
Why is it, then, that mostly former white
athletes are being hired, and not just at Stanford
but at other schools as well? The minority talent
is out there. Charles Harris holds the reins of
the highly successful Arizona State athletic pro
gram, while Tab Bennett is the long-time Uni

versity of Illinois sports information director and
Marvin Cobb is the assistant athletic director
at USC.
This is just a sample of the group of successful
black administrators, and the list of coaches is
even longer. This list includes coaches like
Francis Peay, who is turning the Northwestern
football program around, and Olympic basket
ball coach John Thompson at Georgetown.
Still, neither group is as large as it should
be, and Stanford could take a leadership position
in the hiring of qualified minority candidates
for administrative and coaching positions.
Steps have been taken in the past year, when
Andcberhan was one of four new coaches hired,
but more can be done. The University is cur
rently looking for a new associate athletic di
rector who will serve as the primary coordinator
for women's sports; and minorities, particularly
females, should receive extremely strong con
sideration for the post.
The Athletic Department should be more
completely integrated, but it's not alone. Much
has been made of professional athletic or
ganizations' homogeneity, but the same problem
exists to a slightly lesser degree on the college
level.
Just as there is an under-representation of
minorities in the ranks of the faculty, so too
the same problem exists in the coaching and
athletic administration staffs.
There are no easy answers for a problem
Athletic Director Andy Geiger says is "always
a concern," yet it must be addressed.
