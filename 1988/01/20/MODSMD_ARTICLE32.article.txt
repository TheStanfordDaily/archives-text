# WSU guard named Player of the Week
## 
### 
Washington State's David
Sanders, who scored 16 points
against California and doubled that
total against Stanford, was named
Pacific-10 basketball Player of the
Week on Monday.
The Cougars guard, a sopho
more, led the team to a pair of
road victories. In the Cal game, he
also had seven rebounds and four
assists. Sanders' 32-point outburst
in the overtime game at Stanford
was a career-high for him. His
seventh 3-pointer of the night, with
10 seconds left in overtime, made
Washington State a winner.
Sanders was 10-of-20 from the
field against the Cardinal, burying
his seven 3-pointers in just 10 at
tempts. He also went 5-of-6 from

the free-throw line, two of those
coming with 1:06 left in regulation
to knot the score at 63-63 and send
the game into the extra stanza.
Other players nominated for the
weekly award, which is sponsored
by Volkswagen, were Anthony Cook
of Arizona, Matt Beeuwsaert of Cal,
Anthony Taylor of Oregon, Bill
Sherwood of Oregon State, Todd
Lichti of Stanford and Chris Munk
of USC.
Lichti scored 16 points in the loss
to the Cougars, six of which came
down the stretch as Stanford tried
in vain to hang on to its fast-fading
lead. Lichti also took one ill-advised
shot in the waning moments which
barely drew iron.
