# Golfers place 5th in Santa Barbara
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
In order to make up for the
milder weather today, the
denizens of the Sandpiper
Country Club in Santa Barbara
made their already difficult
oceanfront course even more dif
ficult by stretching it to over 7000
yards.
The Stanford men's golf team,
to spite the men who placed the
pins and tee blocks, came roaring
back to finish fifth in a field of
18 teams yesterday at the final
round of the 54-hole Hammond
Bell Pacific Coast Champion
ship.
UC-Santa Barbara, playing on
its home turf, outdistanced the
field by a wide margin, scoring
a team total of 913 for the three
rounds. Stanford Coach Wally
Goodwin attributed the home
team's success to "local
knowledge," which is important
on a course with so many
doglegs.
Washington, a team Goodwin
called "much improved," took
second place with 928. The other
top teams in a tightly packed
field were San Jose State, Pep
perdine, Fresno State and Stan
ford.
The weather did not play a
factor in yesterday's round, as it
had Monday with stiff winds and
bitter cold temperatures.
However, the increased tee-to
green distance of the holes made
the course much harder to score
low on.
Sophomore Mark Funseth
called the course "one of the
best we play all year long." He
added that the layout was much
better to play in the winter than
the Stanford Golf Course be
cause it does not absorb as much
water and the greens do not be
come spongy.
The individual medalist for the
Cardinal was sophomore Brad
Joondeph, who fired a final
round 78 to lead the Cardinal
at 235 (81-76-78). He was fol
lowed by Funseth at 237 (78-81-

78) and junior John Mahon at
238 (82-76-80).
The first-round medalist for
Stanford, sophomore Don Chris
tensen, who battled windy con
ditions Monday, faltered in the
final round with an 86. Sopho
more Mike Hubley, who was not
a factor in the opening rounds,
came back with a vengeance yes
terday, blazing to a 75 that in
cluded four birdies in the first
nine holes of play.
Hubley, who blamed his poor
performance Monday on the
weather and the lack of a prac
tice round, said he "felt pretty
confident" about his game yes
terday. Overall, he said all facets
of his game improved from the
first day of competition to the
second.
Goodwin said he was ecstatic
over Hubley's drastic turnaround
yesterday. Any coach likes to see
his players improve, but Good
win was especially pleased at
Hubley's performance because
"he practices hard and deserves
what he gets." Goodwin added
that Hubley's poor performance
Monday was due to the fact that
he played the course sight
unseen as a last-minute substi
tute for junior Roger Miraglia,
who was unable to play in the
tournament.
Goodwin said he was surprised
that the team's scores were so
high, but attributed it mostly to
Monday's weather. The high
winds especially hurt Funseth
because he hits the ball high,
Goodwin said. He added that he
has high expectations for the
sophomore in the future because
"he is capable of lots of birdies."
The coach said he expects the
team's performance in the tour
nament to improve its ranking
in District 8. As of Dec. 15, the
Cardinal was ranked No. 11, be
hind teams such as California
and New Mexico State, both of
which the Cardinal beat in this
week's competition. Goodwin
said the Stanford team could
rank as high as eighth when the
next poll is taken.
