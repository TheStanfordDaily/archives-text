It will be "an act of intellectual suicide and a
damn shame" if Stanford eliminates the required
core reading list from its Western Culture program,
U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett said
yesterday.
In a telephone interview with The Daily, Bennett
said the study of works on the University's core
list — 15 traditionally recognized classics — is
essential for students if they are to become effective
citizens in Western society. He stressed that the
reading list should not be eliminated because of
political pressure from "dissident students and facul

Tomorrow, the Faculty Senate will consider a
proposal to eliminate the core list and require the
study of at least one non-Western culture in the
required freshman program.
Several ethnic minority and women's groups here
charge that the University's core list requirement
is largely responsible for the Western Culture
program's "Eurocentric, white male bias."

Speaking from Washington, D.C., Bennett said
he would not try to participate directly in the
Faculty Senate debate on the proposal. But because
Stanford is among the nation's most prestigious
universities, its position on a core curriculum may
influence other institutions, said Loye Miller, Ben
nett's press secretary.
Even if action by Stanford were not to have an
effect on other universities, Miller said, Bennett
"has deep concern that Stanford will eliminate its
requirement."
An understanding of the most fundamental ques
tions of Western society, which Bennett said are
addressed in the classic works, is "very important
because Western society will be the water in which
Stanford graduates will be the fish."
"Western culture is our tradition, our culture. It
is the one 99.5 percent of Stanford graduates will
live in, vote in, be lawyers in, be writers in,"he said.
Study of Western culture "is not an ideological
track," Bennett said. "Wrestling with the questions
