# Bennett assails reforms
## Secretary comments on Stanford debate 
### Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
It will be "an act of intellectual suicide and a
damn shame" if Stanford eliminates the required
core reading list from its Western Culture program,
U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett said
yesterday.
In a telephone interview with The Daily, Bennett
said the study of works on the University's core
list — 15 traditionally recognized classics — is
essential for students if they are to become effective
citizens in Western society. He stressed that the
reading list should not be eliminated because of
political pressure from "dissident students and facul
ty."
Tomorrow, the Faculty Senate will consider a
proposal to eliminate the core list and require the
study of at least one non-Western culture in the
required freshman program.
Several ethnic minority and women's groups here
charge that the University's core list requirement
is largely responsible for the Western Culture
program's "Eurocentric, white male bias."

Speaking from Washington, D.C., Bennett said
he would not try to participate directly in the
Faculty Senate debate on the proposal. But because
Stanford is among the nation's most prestigious
universities, its position on a core curriculum may
influence other institutions, said Loye Miller, Ben
nett's press secretary.
Even if action by Stanford were not to have an
effect on other universities, Miller said, Bennett
"has deep concern that Stanford will eliminate its
requirement."
An understanding of the most fundamental ques
tions of Western society, which Bennett said are
addressed in the classic works, is "very important
because Western society will be the water in which
Stanford graduates will be the fish."
"Western culture is our tradition, our culture. It
is the one 99.5 percent of Stanford graduates will
live in, vote in, be lawyers in, be writers in,"he said.
Study of Western culture "is not an ideological
track," Bennett said. "Wrestling with the questions
of Marx vs. Madison, Plato vs. Aristotle and Luther
vs. the Church .. . (is) not to follow
a (particular) party line."
Bennett stressed that teaching
non-Western cultures is very impor
tant but added that that "does not
remove the obligation" of a univer
sity to teach Western culture. "The
better a student knows Western cul
ture, the better he can understand
other cultures," Bennett said. He
recommended that Stanford "beef
up" its non-Western requirements
instead of "diluting" the Western
Culture program.
He argued that having a separate
non-Western requirement is "not
to belittle [other cultures]. It's sim
ply to put first things first."

"That's to say: Get to know your
own family first and build your con
fidence so that you can get to know
others.. .. It's the Socratic act of
'Know thyself,' " he said.
Bennett said people "don't un
derstand Western society" if they
argue that Stanford's core reading
list has a built-in bias because few
works by women and minorities are
included in it.
"There is no tradition that is
more enlightened than the West,"
Bennett said. "The idea of political
equality itself is a Western idea.
The whole world shares that view.
If we look for the banner around
which people who are oppressed
rally, we will find it in the West,"
he said.
"I agree with (Stanford English
Prof. William) Chace; the race or

sex of who wrote the books is the
least important thing. The most im
portant is the ideas presented,"he
said.
Bennett said a chant of those
opposed to Stanford's program,
"Hey hey, ho ho, Western Culture
has got to go," characterizes their
position. "Good music, no lyrics,"
Bennett said.
In a speech yesterday to the
American Council of Educators,
Bennett attacked proposed changes
in Stanford's Western Culture pro
gram. "A very vocal minority is at
tempting to overpower a less vocal
majority" to abolish the core list,
Bennett said. He called this "aca
demic policy by intimidation."
Responding to that speech,
Chace yesterday called Bennett
"underinformed."

"Minority groups have had some
effect for good and some for ill,"
Chace said, noting that pressure
from groups opposed to the core
list causes the faculty to respond.
Bennett has been a longtime
proponent of required reading of
the classics in higher education. In
his 1984 book, "To Reclaim a
Legacy," Bennett wrote that higher
education should require that stu
dents read a set of classic authors
selected by each institution based
on the faculty's ability to teach
those works deemed important.
In the book, Bennett suggested
that universities require several
works included on Stanford's core
list, such as the Bible and Plato's
"Republic." Most of his recommen
dations are not on Stanford's list,
including works by Chaucer, Milton
and Martin Luther King Jr.

rally, we will find it in the West,"

"I agree with (Stanford English
Prof. William) Chace; the race or

sex of who wrote the books is the
least important thing. The most im
portant is the ideas presented,"he
said.
Bennett said a chant of those
opposed to Stanford's program,
"Hey hey, ho ho, Western Culture
has got to go," characterizes their
position. "Good music, no lyrics,"
Bennett said.
In a speech yesterday to the
American Council of Educators,
Bennett attacked proposed changes
in Stanford's Western Culture pro
gram. "A very vocal minority is at
tempting to overpower a less vocal
majority" to abolish the core list,
Bennett said. He called this "aca
demic policy by intimidation."
Responding to that speech,
Chace yesterday called Bennett
"underinformed."

"Minority groups have had some
effect for good and some for ill,"
Chace said, noting that pressure
from groups opposed to the core
list causes the faculty to respond.
Bennett has been a longtime
proponent of required reading of
the classics in higher education. In
his 1984 book, "To Reclaim a
Legacy," Bennett wrote that higher
education should require that stu
dents read a set of classic authors
selected by each institution based
on the faculty's ability to teach
those works deemed important.
In the book, Bennett suggested
that universities require several
works included on Stanford's core
list, such as the Bible and Plato's
"Republic." Most of his recommen
dations are not on Stanford's list,
including works by Chaucer, Milton
and Martin Luther King Jr.
It will be "an act of intellectual suicide and a
damn shame" if Stanford eliminates the required
core reading list from its Western Culture program,
U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett said
yesterday.
In a telephone interview with The Daily, Bennett
said the study of works on the University's core
list — 15 traditionally recognized classics — is
essential for students if they are to become effective
citizens in Western society. He stressed that the
reading list should not be eliminated because of
political pressure from "dissident students and facul
ty."
Tomorrow, the Faculty Senate will consider a
proposal to eliminate the core list and require the
study of at least one non-Western culture in the
required freshman program.
Several ethnic minority and women's groups here
charge that the University's core list requirement
is largely responsible for the Western Culture
program's "Eurocentric, white male bias."

Speaking from Washington, D.C., Bennett said
he would not try to participate directly in the
Faculty Senate debate on the proposal. But because
Stanford is among the nation's most prestigious
universities, its position on a core curriculum may
influence other institutions, said Loye Miller, Ben
nett's press secretary.
Even if action by Stanford were not to have an
effect on other universities, Miller said, Bennett
"has deep concern that Stanford will eliminate its
requirement."
An understanding of the most fundamental ques
tions of Western society, which Bennett said are
addressed in the classic works, is "very important
because Western society will be the water in which
Stanford graduates will be the fish."
"Western culture is our tradition, our culture. It
is the one 99.5 percent of Stanford graduates will
live in, vote in, be lawyers in, be writers in,"he said.
Study of Western culture "is not an ideological
track," Bennett said. "Wrestling with the questions
of Marx vs. Madison, Plato vs. Aristotle and Luther
vs. the Church .. . (is) not to follow
a (particular) party line."
Bennett stressed that teaching
non-Western cultures is very impor
tant but added that that "does not
remove the obligation" of a univer
sity to teach Western culture. "The
better a student knows Western cul
ture, the better he can understand
other cultures," Bennett said. He
recommended that Stanford "beef
up" its non-Western requirements
instead of "diluting" the Western
Culture program.
He argued that having a separate
non-Western requirement is "not
to belittle [other cultures]. It's sim
ply to put first things first."

"That's to say: Get to know your
own family first and build your con
fidence so that you can get to know
others.. .. It's the Socratic act of
'Know thyself,' " he said.
Bennett said people "don't un
derstand Western society" if they
argue that Stanford's core reading
list has a built-in bias because few
works by women and minorities are
included in it.
"There is no tradition that is
more enlightened than the West,"
Bennett said. "The idea of political
equality itself is a Western idea.
The whole world shares that view.
If we look for the banner around
which people who are oppressed
rally, we will find it in the West,"
he said.
