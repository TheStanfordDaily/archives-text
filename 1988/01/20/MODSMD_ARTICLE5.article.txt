# Med report cites clinical deficiencies

The invigoration of clinical academic pro
grams in the School of Medicine is an "urgent
priority," according to a landmark report pre
sented to the University Board of Trustees
by the Medical School last month.
As part of a two-year planning and eval
uation effort headed by Medical School Dean
David Korn, the report calls for "a major
facilities program over the next 10 years" in
hopes of providing greater balance among
medical students' education, research and
patient care.
The Medical School report is part of the
first major self-assessment of the school since
its move from San Francisco to the Stanford
campus in 1959.
The proposed facilities program calls for
the construction of new space for the clinical
sciences and renovation of the 30-year-old
Medical School buildings in order to allow
the continuation of high-technology experi
mental research.
Improvements of Lane Medical Library and
a student, education center are also necessary,
according to Korn, who has been dean of
the school for just over three years.
As a first step, University trustees have
approved the construction of a $15 million
laboratory building in the near future.
But to fulfill long-range goals of space
requirements, the Medical School's Institu
tional Planning Committee seeks to "review
and evaluate academic programs of each clini
cal department to determine their space and
resource needs," Pathology Prof. Errol Fried
berg, the committee chair, said yesterday.
Once determined, the space requirements
will then be "integrated into a complete in
stitutional package," he added.
The traditional structure of education for
the four-year medical student involves two
years of study of the basic sciences — such
as biochemistry, genetics and molecular bi

ology — followed by two years of training
in clinical academic programs dealing
primarily with actual patient care.
The report states that although the Medical
School has met with much success in the
basic sciences over the past 30 years, devel
opment in clinical departments has been ir
regular and uneven.
The report concluded that to continue to
attract the faculty talent required for excel
lence in clinical, educational and research
programs, the school must address the prob
lem of academic space needs and must end
its cycle of space "impoverishment."
"It's the perception of the dean that we're
losing faculty," Friedberg said.
In the past, major achievements in the
Medical School have been linked to the suc
cessful recruitment of key faculty members
and to the availability of appropriate aca
demic facilities and resources, the report
states.
The clinical activities of the faculty involve
research in faculty members' respective clini
cal departments at the school, in addition to
patient care and clinical teaching at Stanford
University Hospital (SUH) and local hospitals
with which the Medical School is affiliated.
The need for clinical facilities for Medical
School faculty has largely been addressed
through a complete modernization of SUH,
as well as plans to construct the Packard
Children's Hospital and Charter Hospital at
Stanford.
According to Spyros Andreopoulos, the
Medical School's director of communications,
academic space at the Medical School —
such as laboratories for clinical research —
are inadequate, and for this reason the Med
ical School will in the future be unable to
effectively recruit faculty and leadership fig
ures in the clinical departments.
Faculty are not attracted to the school
without the opportunity to "expand the store
