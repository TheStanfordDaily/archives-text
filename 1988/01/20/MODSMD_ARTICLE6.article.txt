# Some testing; still incomplete
## Seismic study clears campus buildings 
### Nick Anderson Senior staff writer 
A preliminary review of structural
plans of University facilities has deter
mined that no other campus buildings
face the problems that forced the closure
of Roble Hall and the Lou Henry Hoover
House, a University official said yester
day.
But some buildings need to be tested
physically by drilling holes in walls before
a final determination of seismic safety
can be made, said John Hughes, asso
ciate provost for Facilities Planning.
Hughes said the affected departments
will be directly notified this week about
the necessary testing, which will last
several weeks.
In addition, two older facilities at

Hopkins Marine Station — the Locb
and Agassiz buildings — remain to be
inspected, Hughes said.
The inspections are being conducted
by Stanford's Blume Earthquake Center
in conjunction with University Project
Management.
The Hoover House and Roble are
being examined by the San Francisco
engineering firms Forell Elfesser, and
Rutherford & Chckenc, respectively.
Both buildings were constructed with
hollow clay tiles in their outer walls,
placing them at an unacceptable earth
quake risk relative to other campus
buildings, Hughes said.
Hughes said there are two criteria for
determining relative risk: "First, the ac
tual physical hazard; second, what is the

occupancy?"
"California is a geologically active
state, and earthquakes will happen," he
said. "In a very strong quake there are
no structures that are absolutely safe."
Hughes added that Stanford is not
legally bound to seismically upgrade its
buildings.
The first state earthquake regulations
appeared in 1933, 15 years after the
construction of Roble. Since then,
several state regulations have been
passed, but none of them apply to build
ings retroactively.
The Hoover House, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's residence, will
be reinforced following its closure Jan.
27. A final social event is planned for
that date to acknowledge the work done

by the more than 100 employees who
assisted in the closing of Roble over the
holidays. Roblc's fate remains undeter
mined, Hughes said.
The Kennedys arc still looking for a
place to stay during their year-long
hiatus from the Hoover House.
Other buildings affected by earth
quake risk include Green Library and
the Old Chemistry Building. The tiered
stacks in Green are currently being
braced at a cost of $5 million, Hughes
said. The Old Chemistry Building has
been permanently decommissioned in
several stages over the past two years.
The Knoll and Encina Gym, two of
the oldest buildings on campus, have
been determined to be structurally safe,
according to Hughes.
