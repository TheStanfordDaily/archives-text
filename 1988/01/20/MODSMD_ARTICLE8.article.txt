Israel tries to end Arab strikes
JERUSALEM — Israeli authorities stepped up the pressure
yesterday on Palestinian workers and shopkeepers in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, putting into effect what was described
as Stage 2 of the government's program to break a six-week cycle
of civil unrest that has left at least 36 people dead.
Touring the Ramallah area north of Jerusalem, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin said the government will block food shipments from
relief organizations and other countries in an effort to end the
commercial strikes that continue to paralyze Arab East Jerusalem
and a number of towns in the occupied territories.
"We will show who is running the territories," he said.
Rabin said that the violent stage of the unrest appeared to have
passed as a result of massive troop reinforcements, new riot-control
tactics and curfews in the Palestinian refugee camps.
Soldiers forced Ramallah merchants to open their stores yesterday
morning despite a strike called by the Palestinian "Uprising Com
mittee." However, most of the merchants remained outside their
shops, and there were no customers. East Jerusalem stores were
shuttered for the 10th day in a row.
In Gaza City, soldiers reportedly confiscated the identification
papers of about 50 Palestinian shop owners and said the vital
documents would not be returned until they ended their strike,
which has been almost continuous since the trouble began last Dec.

Coastal storm ravages So. Calif.
LOS ANGELES — Damage estimates topped $68 million and
continued to climb yesterday as property owners and public officials
began the arduous task of cleaning up after the winter storm that
ravaged a 250-mile stretch of the coast from Santa Barbara south
to the Mexican city of Ensenada.
Wind-driven surf threatened oceanfront structures again yesterday
as tides peaked above seven feet at 8:38 a.m., but the waves were
considerably smaller than the 25-foot breakers that destroyed part
of a pier, damaged homes, restaurants and a hotel and forced
scores of beachfront residents and visitors to flee Sunday and
Monday.
Sandbag levees, bulldozed berms and rock-pile seawalls hastily
erected during the night did their job yesterday, and there were
few reports of additional damage.
"Everything we have done is holding," said Battalion Chief Gordon
Pearson of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
Forecasters said the tides and surf should diminish even more
tomorrow, and no further damage was expected.
Los Angeles County supervisors declared a state of emergency
and asked Gov. George Deukmejian to declare the stricken com
munities a disaster area.
Nofziger federal trial opens
WASHINGTON — Defense attorneys for Lyn Nofziger, focusing
on a loophole in federal ethics law, contended yesterday that the
former White House aide had lobbied ex-colleagues on relatively
minor issues and therefore did not break the law.
In his opening statement at Nofziger's federal trial on charges
of lobbying improprieties, attorney E. Lawrence Barcella told jurors
that the law prohibits lobbying by an ex-government official only
on matters of "direct and substantial interest" to his former agency.
Barcella argued that Nofziger, after resigning as President
Reagan's political director in 1982, had lobbied for an electric
motor manufacturer, an aircraft company and a maritime union on
issues that were "not that big a deal" to the White House. He
urged jurors to "put things in proper perspective."
Assistant special prosecutor Lovida Coleman Jr., however,
portrayed strong White House interest in the matters.
Court lets North probe continue
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court refused yesterday to
hear a constitutional challenge to independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh's investigation of the Iran-contra scandal, clearing the way
for Walsh to pursue a criminal indictment against Lt. Col. Oliver
North.
The court action lets stand a contempt of court citation against
North for refusing to turn over information requested by a secret
grand jury in Washington.
The attorneys for North, the pivotal figure in the secret plan to
sell U.S. arms to Iran and send the profits to rebels in Nicaragua,
have conducted an aggressive defense at every stage of the proceed
ings against him. When a grand jury asked North to submit a
handwriting sample last summer, his attorneys responded with an
attack on Walsh's authority to conduct the inquiry.
Under the Ethics in Government Act, Walsh was selected by a
three-judge panel in December 1986, to investigate the Iran-contra
affair and to prosecute any crimes committed by officials working
for the president. But North's attorneys contended that only the
president can select federal prosecutors.
U.S. Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr. rejected the attack and charged
North with contempt for refusing the grand jury order. North's
lawyers tried again before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia, but Judge Douglas Ginsburg, later to be nominated
unsuccessfully to the Supreme Court, issued an opinion saying that
North may raise the constitutional challenge only after a trial, not
before one. Yesterday, the Supreme Court dismissed North's appeal
of that ruling (North vs. Walsh, 87-869).
The Supreme Court action leaves North with a choice of supplying
the subpoenaed information, including a handwriting sample, or
going to jail.
Jackson assails media coverage
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Democratic presidential candidate
Jesse Jackson unleashed a sharp attack on the news media during
a fund-raising luncheon yesterday, saying the media portrays
minorities in a way "designed to poison the minds of the common
people."
Jackson, in California for fund-raisers here and in San Francisco
that were expected to bring in $100,000 for his presidential campaign,
made the remarks to a roomful of mostly black business and political
leaders.
The $500-a-plate luncheon was closed to the press, but some
reporters listened to the remarks and tape recorded them from an
adjacent partitioned-off area.
While recounting the difficulties of competing with other, better
financed Democratic candidates, Jackson said the "ultimate struggle"
was against the media and its power to write and report on his
campaign, which he termed "appraisal power."
Jackson declared that the media projects minorities, particularly
blacks and Latinos, "in five deadly ways every day."
"It projects us as less intelligent than we are, as less hard working
than we are, as less patriotic than we are, as less universal than
we are and as more violent than we are — in ways designed to
poison the minds of the common people," Jackson said.

LOS ANGELES — Damage estimates topped $68 million and
continued to climb yesterday as property owners and public officials
began the arduous task of cleaning up after the winter storm that
ravaged a 250-mile stretch of the coast from Santa Barbara south
to the Mexican city of Ensenada.
Wind-driven surf threatened oceanfront structures again yesterday
as tides peaked above seven feet at 8:38 a.m., but the waves were
considerably smaller than the 25-foot breakers that destroyed part
of a pier, damaged homes, restaurants and a hotel and forced
scores of beachfront residents and visitors to flee Sunday and
Monday.
Sandbag levees, bulldozed berms and rock-pile seawalls hastily
erected during the night did their job yesterday, and there were
few reports of additional damage.
"Everything we have done is holding," said Battalion Chief Gordon
Pearson of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
Forecasters said the tides and surf should diminish even more
tomorrow, and no further damage was expected.
Los Angeles County supervisors declared a state of emergency
and asked Gov. George Deukmejian to declare the stricken com
munities a disaster area.
Nofziger federal trial opens
WASHINGTON — Defense attorneys for Lyn Nofziger, focusing
on a loophole in federal ethics law, contended yesterday that the
former White House aide had lobbied ex-colleagues on relatively
minor issues and therefore did not break the law.
In his opening statement at Nofziger's federal trial on charges
of lobbying improprieties, attorney E. Lawrence Barcella told jurors
that the law prohibits lobbying by an ex-government official only
on matters of "direct and substantial interest" to his former agency.
Barcella argued that Nofziger, after resigning as President
Reagan's political director in 1982, had lobbied for an electric
motor manufacturer, an aircraft company and a maritime union on
issues that were "not that big a deal" to the White House. He
urged jurors to "put things in proper perspective."
Assistant special prosecutor Lovida Coleman Jr., however,
portrayed strong White House interest in the matters.
Court lets North probe continue
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court refused yesterday to
hear a constitutional challenge to independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh's investigation of the Iran-contra scandal, clearing the way
for Walsh to pursue a criminal indictment against Lt. Col. Oliver
North.
The court action lets stand a contempt of court citation against
North for refusing to turn over information requested by a secret
grand jury in Washington.
The attorneys for North, the pivotal figure in the secret plan to
sell U.S. arms to Iran and send the profits to rebels in Nicaragua,
have conducted an aggressive defense at every stage of the proceed
ings against him. When a grand jury asked North to submit a
handwriting sample last summer, his attorneys responded with an
attack on Walsh's authority to conduct the inquiry.
Under the Ethics in Government Act, Walsh was selected by a
three-judge panel in December 1986, to investigate the Iran-contra
affair and to prosecute any crimes committed by officials working
for the president. But North's attorneys contended that only the
president can select federal prosecutors.
U.S. Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr. rejected the attack and charged
North with contempt for refusing the grand jury order. North's
lawyers tried again before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia, but Judge Douglas Ginsburg, later to be nominated
unsuccessfully to the Supreme Court, issued an opinion saying that
North may raise the constitutional challenge only after a trial, not
before one. Yesterday, the Supreme Court dismissed North's appeal
of that ruling (North vs. Walsh, 87-869).
The Supreme Court action leaves North with a choice of supplying
the subpoenaed information, including a handwriting sample, or
going to jail.
Jackson assails media coverage
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Democratic presidential candidate
Jesse Jackson unleashed a sharp attack on the news media during
a fund-raising luncheon yesterday, saying the media portrays
minorities in a way "designed to poison the minds of the common
people."
Jackson, in California for fund-raisers here and in San Francisco
that were expected to bring in $100,000 for his presidential campaign,
made the remarks to a roomful of mostly black business and political
leaders.
The $500-a-plate luncheon was closed to the press, but some
reporters listened to the remarks and tape recorded them from an
adjacent partitioned-off area.
While recounting the difficulties of competing with other, better
financed Democratic candidates, Jackson said the "ultimate struggle"
was against the media and its power to write and report on his
campaign, which he termed "appraisal power."
Jackson declared that the media projects minorities, particularly
blacks and Latinos, "in five deadly ways every day."
"It projects us as less intelligent than we are, as less hard working
than we are, as less patriotic than we are, as less universal than
we are and as more violent than we are — in ways designed to
poison the minds of the common people," Jackson said.

Israel tries to end Arab strikes
JERUSALEM — Israeli authorities stepped up the pressure
yesterday on Palestinian workers and shopkeepers in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, putting into effect what was described
as Stage 2 of the government's program to break a six-week cycle
of civil unrest that has left at least 36 people dead.
Touring the Ramallah area north of Jerusalem, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin said the government will block food shipments from
relief organizations and other countries in an effort to end the
commercial strikes that continue to paralyze Arab East Jerusalem
and a number of towns in the occupied territories.
"We will show who is running the territories," he said.
Rabin said that the violent stage of the unrest appeared to have
passed as a result of massive troop reinforcements, new riot-control
tactics and curfews in the Palestinian refugee camps.
Soldiers forced Ramallah merchants to open their stores yesterday
morning despite a strike called by the Palestinian "Uprising Com
mittee." However, most of the merchants remained outside their
shops, and there were no customers. East Jerusalem stores were
shuttered for the 10th day in a row.
In Gaza City, soldiers reportedly confiscated the identification
papers of about 50 Palestinian shop owners and said the vital
documents would not be returned until they ended their strike,
which has been almost continuous since the trouble began last Dec.
