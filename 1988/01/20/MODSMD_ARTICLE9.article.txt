## Contras, Sandinistas to bargain 
### 
MIAMI â€” Softening their earlier position,
contra leaders yesterday said they will hold face
to-face peace talks with Sandinista officials
despite the Nicaraguan government's refusal to
include the civic opposition.
The contras said, however, they will not
engage in a cease-fire before the Sandinistas
negotiate political issues in three-way talks that
include the internal opposition. They called for
such a meeting to be held simultaneously with
the cease-fire talks.
"A cease-fire is not a goal. It is a means to
achieve democracy," said contra leader Alfonso
Robelo.
Alfredo Cesar, another representative on the
contras' six-member directorate, added, "We will
not stop shooting if the tripartite talks have not
succeeded."
At a press conference in their headquarters
here, the U.S.-backed guerrillas said they will
meet tomorrow with the mediator, Roman Cath
olic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo of
Nicaragua, in San Jose, Costa Rica, to arrange

the talks.
Obando met with Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega Monday, and the two agreed that
the talks could be held Jan. 27-28. That would
follow President Reagan's State of the Union
speech, in which he is expected to push his
request for renewed military aid to the contras.
Congress is expected to vote on the aid in
early February in what is being described by
both Republicans and Democrats as a make-or
break decision on the policy of support for the
rebels.
Ortega agreed to hold the first direct talks
with the contras under pressure from four other
Central American presidents when they met last
weekend to evaluate each country's compliance
with the regional peace plan they signed Aug. 7.
Sunday, the contras had rejected the offer for
direct talks unless they included civic opposition
parties. Ortega refused.
Monday, Ortega abolished the People's Anti-
Somocista Tribunals for trying accused contras,
and yesterday he formally lifted a state-of

emergency law limiting civil liberties. He had
promised to take the steps at the presidents'
meeting.
Ortega also said he will release 1800 former
National Guardsmen under deposed dictator
Anastasio Somoza and 1500 contra convicts if
there is a cease-fire or if a country outside
Central America will accept them.
Contra leaders said these steps are "sec
ondary." In order to end the six-year war, they
are demanding a list of constitutional and po
litical reforms that would separate the Sandinista
Party from the army and government institutions,
weaken presidential power, prohibit presidential
re-election and guarantee private property.
"What we agreed to in San Jose is clear in
that we are only to talk about the negotiation
of a cease-fire with armed groups so they can
put down their arms, so they can accept the
amnesty and then take part in the political
dialogue," Ortega said Monday.
