# New proposal alters today's Area 1 debate

A counterproposal to the Western Culture Task
Force's proposal to change the University's Area One
requirement adds an element of drama to the long
awaited debate that will officially commence at today's
Faculty Senate meeting.
The task force proposal, finalized last month after
a year of University-wide debate and compromise, was
expected to win easy confirmation by the senate. But
the counterproposal, spearheaded by English Prof.
William Chace and signed by 22 other faculty members,
makes the outcome uncertain.
It was originally expected that the senate would
vote on the proposal today, but now the vote will
come, at the earliest, at the senate's Feb. 4 meeting,
according to Senate Chair Gerald Licbcrman.
A lively and far-ranging debate is expected at today's
meeting.
"The debate will be much, much wider than to
either abolish [the current program] or not," said
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall, vice chair of the senate.
The counterproposal differs from the Western Culture
Task Force plan in that it retains the current core
reading list, but with the addition of works by women
and minorities. Under the task force plan, however,
the core list would be abandoned, and the requirement
would be renamed "Cultures, Ideas and Values."
McCall last year chaired the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (CUS), the legislative body in charge
of the task force, and is a cosignatory of the alternative
proposal. "I have never felt that the task force proposal
would sail through," he said.
Most faculty members involved with the debate
agreed that predicting what action the senate will take
is difficult. Task force chairman Paul Seaver noted
that only a minority of senate members — specifically
those in the humanities and social science departments
— have participated in discussions so far.
"I can't imagine what the representatives from the
law, medical and engineering schools will think of all
of this," said Seaver, who is also a history professor.
"The humanities is very much a minority in the senate."
Operations Research Prof. Kenneth Arrow, who
chaired the senate last year, said he "would be
surprised" if no modifications to the task force proposal
were made.
"I think everybody is committed to the idea that
emphasis on women and minorities should be increased
