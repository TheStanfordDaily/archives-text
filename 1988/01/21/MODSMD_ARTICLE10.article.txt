# Reagan sets contra aid showdown
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - President
Reagan, employing some of his
sharpest language in recent months
in support of the Nicaraguan con
tras, raised the specter yesterday of
a communist Managua regime
moving north and turning the Gulf
of Mexico into an American version
of the war-torn Persian Gulf if U.S.
aid to the Nicaraguan rebels is cut
off.
Reagan, anticipating an ex
tremely close vote on his coming
request for new money for the
rebels, scoffed at reforms an
nounced by Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega and said: "This vote
will be remembered by the Amer
ican people either as the time we
acted to support freedom and kept
our mainland secure, or as the be
ginning of one of America's most
tragic mistakes."
The tone of the president's
remarks, made in a speech to contra
supporters, reflects the White
House's make-or-break view of the
vote. If Congress rejects the aid
request, administration officials say
they fear that the Democrats con

trolling the House and Senate will
not schedule any more votes this
year on assistance to the Contras.
"We're at a critical juncture,"
Reagan said. "If Congress votes
down aid this time, the decision
may well be irrevocable. And, if
that happens, it's my great fear that
we will have abandoned all hope
for democracy in Nicaragua and
peace in Central America."
With the first vote scheduled in
the House on Feb. 3, the issue is
likely to dominate Reagan's
schedule over the next two weeks.
White House staff members not di
rectly involved in Central American
affairs and congressional relations
have been assigned to help round
up support.
One administration official said
earlier in the week that, as of Mon
day, a tentative decision had been
made to seek $100 million for the
rebels when Reagan sends his for
mal request to Congress next Tues
day. However, a senior White
House official speaking on the con
dition of anonymity said yesterday
that that figure had been trimmed

— a development that reflects the
difficulty of winning approval for
the funding.
"The more money you ask for,
the fewer votes you get," he said.
In the first of several speeches
he is scheduled to give on Contra
aid over the next two weeks, the
president said: "Imagine the effect
on U.S. national security if the San
dinista vision of a communist
Central America is realized and
Mexico is threatened. Imagine, if
for the first time in this century,
we had to concern ourselves with
a security threat on our Southern
border. Imagine our vital sea lanes
through the Gulf put in jeopardy.
The kind of turmoil that exists in
the Persian Gulf cannot be allowed
to exist in the Gulf of Mexico."
The president said it was "will
fully naive to think the Soviet Un
ion, beset by a crisis in its own
economy, would be pouring billions
of dollars into a country on the
other side of the world if they didn't
sec great opportunities there."
"It's time to realize that the San
dinista communists and their Soviet

mentors arc serious people with
serious objectives. It's time we got
serious too," Reagan told a group
of civic leaders, state legislators and
church officials in the stately East
Room of the White House. (Such
events are usually held in an
auditorium of the Executive Office
Building next to the White House.)
Democrats in Congress opposing
continued aid have said Ortega's
moves to comply with the require
ments of last August's Central
American peace accord — reached
with the presidents of Costa Rica,
El Salvador, Guatemala and Hon
duras — stemmed from a Soviet
refusal to supply Nicaragua with
the aid needed to defeat the Con
tras militarily. On Saturday, Ortega
promised, among other steps, to lift
a state of emergency that had cur
tailed civil liberties.
But Reagan, reflecting a fear in
the administration that such steps
could build opposition to the fund
ing request, said, "Each reluctant
reform is still easily undone."
