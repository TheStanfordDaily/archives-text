## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Squeezing free speech 
### 
Public school students do not have the same
constitutional rights to free speech as adults in
other settings, the Supreme Court ruled last week
in Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier. The
Court's 5-3 ruling is a regrettable decision that may
have ominous and far-reaching implications for
public high school and university journalism.
The case involved a newspaper written and edited
by a journalism class at a suburban St. Louis high
school. The school principal excised from publica
tion a pair of articles, on topics of teen pregnancy
and children of divorced parents, along with other
unobjectionable articles that happened to be on
the same pages. The principal believed the two
articles were "inappropriate" for a young audience
and also that the persons discussed in the articles
(though labeled with pseudonyms) might be iden
tified and suffer an infringement of privacy.
Justice Byron White stated for the Court that
the school principal had acted lawfully in suppress
ing the stories. He found it significant that the
paper was produced as part of the curriculum and
was financed by the school board. "A school may
refuse to lend its name and resources to the dis
semination of student expression," he wrote. This
is a valid point; ordinarily, a newspaper publisher
should be allowed to govern the paper's content.
However, since virtually all public high school
papers receive administrative subsidies in one form
or another, and many are curricular, White's opinion
provides enormous license for censorship. The only
limit on this so-called "editorial control" is that it
be "reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical
concerns." This is really no limitation at all, because
the "reasonable relationship" test is one the gov
ernment invariably passes.
College newspapers at public universities are also
susceptible to censorship under this ruling, since
legal precedents involving college students were

cited interchangeably with high school free speech
cases by White.
No one argues that a school newspaper shouldn't
be regulated for ungrammatical, poorly written, in
adequately researched, libelous, biased or profane
material. In addition, administrators should be per
mitted to exercise responsible sensitivity to the
legitimate privacy of individuals, by, for example,
requiring that the subjects of stories remain
anonymous in certain instances. But content-based
restrictions are indefensible, notwithstanding the
Supreme Court's opinion.
School papers constitute a public forum in which
all strains of student expression should be equally
accommodated, even if they are offensive or con
tradictory to an administrator's outlook. Otherwise,
a public school may become, as Justice William
Brennan noted in his dissenting opinion, an "enclave
of totalitarianism" in which the government may
suppress ideas it cannot suppress in public parks
or plazas.
Until lately, the law was forthright in protecting
the liberties of public school students. Justice White
ironically cited language in a famous Vietnam War
era case, that students do not "shed their consti
tutional rights to freedom of speech or expression
at the schoolhouse gate." Unfortunately, White and
the Court failed to grasp the spirit and import of
that monumental message, now all but eroded.
The ruling in the Hazelwood case is legally ques
tionable and ethically unacceptable. It marks the
return to an era of in loco parentis, in which school
administrators act patronizingly as substitute par
ents, instead of allowing students individuality and
responsibility. As Brennan observed, the decision
imparts a "civic lesson" to students that is at odds
with "those fundamental values necessary to the
maintenance of a democratic political system" which
public schools are supposed to convey.
