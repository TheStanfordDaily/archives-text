Poisoning birds
a bad example
It is shameful for a University
like Stanford to have to poison the
black birds at Tresidder Union.
The birds are hungry; humans
create the waste that attracts them;
and they must pay with their lives
for human sloppiness.
Is this the right example to teach
to Stanford students? Doesn't Stan
ford have any compassion for other
living beings?

Why not feed the birds in the
morning before the cafeteria opens?
Stanford might have some interest
ing solutions for the famines in
Africa with this kind of attitude.

Bennett remarks
irresponsible
I am astonished at Secretary of
Education William Bennett's
misuse of his official position to

assail a report which he admits to
not having read!
It is unnecessary to respond to
his specious arguments on a point
by point basis because few of them
have any bearing on the proposed
legislation on the Area One re
quirement.
Bennett's remarks, based on
"what I am told" and "what I have
heard" are inaccurate, ignorant and
coming from a senior public official,
utterly irresponsible.
