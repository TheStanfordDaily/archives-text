# Exposing the mythology of the Stanford degree
## 
### 
As a senior who plans to graduate this
June, I've been haunted by a nagging ques
tion which haunts, will haunt or has
haunted us all: What am I going to do
when I graduate/am expelled from the col
legiate womb?

I mention the womb because graduating
seniors from years past have applied the
analogy of birth to graduation — pain,
shock and despair after a long period of
labor. Infant graduates gasp for air, strug
gling to acclimate themselves to the new
and foreign environment. The thin cord
that connects us to the comfort and ease
of the campus is abruptly and mercilessly
cut. The strong survive, grow and prosper.
The weak — well, you get the point.
I'd like to think Stanford graduates are
somewhat better prepared to face the world
than newborns, and I believe the statistics
back me on this assumption. Nonetheless,
graduation is for many students, and at
times perhaps for most students, an event
met with the special apprehension reserved
for the perils of the unknown.
We fear being swallowed by the corporate
machine, to emerge faceless cogs in a mech
anism we cannot control or even influence.
Or we resign ourselves to devoting most

of our waking hours to jobs we despise.
We fear an increasingly competitive job
market. We fear failure on the job, troubled
by the knowledge that unlike the kind
people at Academic Standing the world at
large does not ignore failure and is even
less likely to forgive it.
To keep us warm as we make our way
through this harsh and cold world, however,
we will have our well respected degrees,
indicating that we have received a first-rate
education and are now entitled to prestige
and all of its benefits.
The fact of the degree becomes sur
rounded with a nearly mythic aura. The
strange combination of fear and apprehen
sion surrounding graduation and the 'real
world,' and the awe-inspiring reputation
and prestige surrounding the selective ed
ucational institution has resulted in a tra
dition of myth and folklore concerning the
Stanford bachelor's degree. (This applies
equally to graduate and professional
degrees, as will be made clear.)
The popular degree myths can be de
scribed as four basic types:
The degree as savings bond
Those adhering to this myth believe that,
like a savings bond, their education will
automatically "pay off' at some future date
with interest. Graduation thus becomes
the bond's date of maturity, after which
the degree represents legal tender, payable
to the bearer on demand.
The graduate then has only to "cash in"
his or her costly education for a lifetime
of wealth and ease. Study beyond the un
dergraduate level allows the stu
dent/bondholder to build greater equity,

thus increasing the cash value of the
degree(s).
The degree as lottery ticket
The individual who accepts this piece of
folklore believes himself to be a realist as
compared to the Type I specimen. The
Type II doesn't foolishly imagine that every
graduate will "cash in," but views the after
graduation experience as a lottery with very
favorable odds (odds approaching, say, one
in five).
As graduates play the odds with their
future, some will hit the "jackpot" and be
awarded incalculable sums of cash, fame
and personal fulfillment. Advanced study
has revealed that Type ll's are in fact no
more realistic than Type I's, imagining that
even those who fail to hit the jackpot will
receive sizable "parting gifts" or consolation
prizes.
The degree as stock portfolio
Common among economics majors, this
myth draws a parallel from the post
graduation job market to the exciting and
volatile world of the stock market. College
education is thus a calculated economic
investment. The astute graduate has bought
low and will sell high as the laws of supply
and demand drive the equilibrium price of
his coveted degree higher and higher.
The decision to continue one's education
rests on market projections: If the
degree/education market is bullish, further
education may well pay off, if it is bearish,
one is well advised to "cut one's losses"
and sell. All's fair in this laissez-faire free
for-all, and the Boeskys of any graduating
class will parlay their degrees into obscene
yearly incomes or mind-boggling windfalls.

The degree as magic key/treasure map
Creative types, fiction writers and drama
majors are likely to be Type IV's. The
Type IV fantasizes that his or her degree
will be a key to a secret door, behind which
lies fantastic wealth or a map that will lead
the way to hidden treasure.
Anyone who falls squarely into one of
these categories should look for employ
ment on Fantasy Island. But before running
to the CPPC to interview for Tattoo's job,
consider this: Each of these myths has in
it a grain, however small, of truth.
Education is a bit like an investment.
There is a certain degree of chance involved
in our prospects for the future, and our
prestigious degrees can be like magic keys,
opening doors that may otherwise have
been closed to us.
The sum total is that, armed with a good
education and all it entails, we stand a

better than fair chance at success in
whatever we pursue. Moreover, success
isn't necessarily measurable in dollar
amounts; goals such as personal fulfillment,
self expression and contribution to the
greater welfare of society are equally, if
not more, important to most of us.
These goals may come with a monetary
price tag; I should think that one's in
dividuality and personal integrity are worth
a salary cut. A degree from Stanford doesn't
mean we are instantly entitled to fulfill all
of our personal ambitions at a high salary,
with little or no effort involved.
A good education does help one to
pursue personal goals, achieve a comfort
able standard of living and more fully ap
preciate what life has to offer. And perhaps
that's a kind of fantasy-come-true itself.
