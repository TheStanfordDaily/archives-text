## Area One change a boon for education

On Feb. 4, the Stanford Faculty Senate will
vote on the proposal to change the Western
Culture program. We are writing to urge that
faculty representatives on the Senate vote to
support the proposed changes.

SUDE

The current Western Culture program lacks
both vitality and breadth. Students and teachers
must annually focus their attentions within the
boundaries of a restrictive core list of texts.
Such a core list sets pedagogical restraints on
even the most gifted of instructors; it limits the
potential for the kind of classroom innovation
that benefits teacher and student alike.
No one would deny that a good teacher can
and should continue to be inspired by great
literature, or that students should be exposed
to great thinkers every year. Yet even the current
Western Culture program requires only a selec
tive sampling of the great thinkers of the Western
tradition. In almost every track, students leave
the program ignorant of Tolstoy, Austen,
Herodotus, Fielding, Voltaire and Chekhov, to
name just a few.
It would be impossible to treat adequately
the diversity of Western thought even within
the span of an academic year. The current pro
gram, however, retains a narrowness of focus
which is pedagogically suspect. We as students
want to be exposed to thinkers representative
of the entire range of the Western experience.

By eliminating the core list and by mandating
at least some exposure to works by minorities
and women, the new proposed course would
enable us, in some small degree at least, to
achieve this.
The new course would challenge us intellec
tually by enabling us to draw comparisons and
reach conclusions which would be simply im
possible under the present program. How, for
example, does W.E.B. Dußois's conception of
the soul of the black race compare with the
Hegelian conception of spirit? How does the
ethical system of the Native American religious
leader Black Elk contrast with that of a Luther
or of a St. Augustine? How does the conception
of right held by Mary Shelley differ from that
held by, say, Locke, and how much, if any, of
that difference can be attributed to gender?

A core list sets pedagogical
restraints on even the most
gifted of instructors.

The English Department has proposed an
alternative to the proposed changes which, in
stead of providing for changes within the West
ern Culture curriculum, would add two lines to
the existing legislation mandating that Western
Culture courses address issues of race and
gender, among others. In addition, the English
Department proposal would require a re
evaluation of the non-Western distribution re

quirement.
We are glad the English Department recog
nizes the importance of race and gender issues.
But why then not approve a proposal which
would truly enable students to address these
issues?
The English proposal fails precisely because
it would not sufficiently challenge us as students:
It would not require us to draw the same kind
of intellectual comparisons involving the issues
of race and gender which would be possible
under the current proposal. Stanford students
would continue to receive an education which
is unnecessarily balkanizcd.
Besides providing some clear educational ad
vantages over both the existing program and the
English Department proposal, the proposal
before the Senate would address problems of
inequity which plague the current Western Cul
ture requirement, which neglects the contribu
tions of women and minorities to Western cul
ture.
It is no coincidcncc that the strongest support
for this proposal has come from the minority
student organizations and from minority faculty
members. The new proposal would not only
address this inequity, but also provide students
both minority and white with a more compre
hensive, accurate portrait of their cultural roots.
The new proposal, in short, presents students
with the opportunity to receive nothing less than
a better education during their freshman year
than they now do. Thus we strongly urge the
Faculty Senate to support the changes in the
Area One requirement.
