# Abhorring stupid gore

I don't like to think of myself as narrow-minded,
but here's where I'll openly admit my prejudice. I
refuse to sec "Return of the Living Dead Part II."
Perhaps several people are with me in this bigotry.
I welcome all converts to my fundamentalist dislike
of modern horror films. And I've got plenty of dogma
to enhance this position. I'm a veteran of "Night of
the Living Dead," "Dawn of the Dead," "Day of the
Dead," "Return of the Living Dead," etc. Believe me,
no matter what the names, they're all pretty poor
pieces of film.

Let's talk about dead bodies that invade shopping
malls and feed on people's brains. Gross, but I can
deal. Then we have, and please don't ask why since
I doubt the script writers even know, an infusion of
Hell's Angels running around this mall (I forget which
of the Dead movies this scene is in, but bear with
me). One Hell's Angel really needs to try the blood
pressure machine — so much so that he lets the
zombies advance on him and eat him alive. Oh yeah,
they jack up the pressure of the arm band, too, so
that he explodes — it's as pretty as that. Now I ask
you: after the mild amusement and nausea passes,
what do you do with these images? We might laugh
at this on the scrcen and then get ang™ with our
governments for playing games with bombs. We're
desensitized to violence.
"Dawn of the Dead" slightly approached reason.
The zombies were a threat to the last few people on
earth, and these humans were more complicated char
acters who did more than flee and scream, but also
fought stress and power politics among themselves in
order to survive. One of them even worked with a
zombie he was studying and taught him to be human
again.
Soon, however, the movie deteriorated into more
bloodshed. Most often the story of these types of
horror films is dead bodies and devils causing wrack

and ruin for no reason. Why? This is the human body
we're treating like a punching bag.
I saw these Dead films with avid fans who lunged
hungrily for the popcorn whenever the maiming on
screen got started. People who pushed the rewind
button four or five times to get that super slo-mo
replay of gore explosions. These arc normal people
— these are my friends. This is also me. I cheer at
violence all the time — when the good guys send the
bad guys to hell, I'm there hooting. Hut there's some
thing incredibly callous in our gladiator-style relish of
maiming.
I'm not such a hard-core realist that I don't like a
little fantasy that these movies provide. The use of
the Boogeyman in "Halloween" is scary and
marketable, but the rest of the films in the "Halloween"
canon dwindled into pursuit and pummel, poison and
pierce. I looked for better p-words for "kill" in the
thesaurus just now, and the experience was upsetting.
Open up your "Roget's" and stare at the page of
synonyms for kill. The two antonyms provided at the
bottom — "life" and "reproduction" don't stand a
chance. There's so many different words in the English
language for killing, and obviously thousands of ways
to portray it on the screen, but when do we stop
counting and start caring a little?
I'm waxing nostalgic for the days when Hitchcock
ruled the horror scene. He didn't need to play in gore
— he could give us terror without all that. "Psycho"
has some chilling cinematography. I even liked Norman
Bates at points. He had a history, a purpose, a home.
The protagonists nowadays don't live anywhere, they
have no reason to exist anywhere, and what's more
they never die. We won't talk about "Friday the 13th."
Oh, wait a minute, yes we will, since I have a
specific complaint in that area. It's the mixing of sex
and violence in these films. Let's face it — if the
characters decide to "do it," they die. Camp counselors
pay for having sex. In "Nightmare on Elm Street," a
potentially good film, oversexed adolescents get
mangled after their passion. I like sex scenes where
I know the people will be safe. Mixing sex and gore
is simply perverse.
I think it's symbolic that the zombies in the Dead
movies eat brains. You know something's eaten the
brains of these filmmakers long ago.
