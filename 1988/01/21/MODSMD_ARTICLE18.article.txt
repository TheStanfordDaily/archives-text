## Training for world service 
### 
In the last 10 years Third World
development has become one of the
hottest areas of interest on college
campuses. Students across America
have begun studying the cultures
of developing countries and working
in the Third World through a va
riety of voluntary organizations like
the Overseas Development Net
work, Volunteers in Asia and the
Peace Corps.

At the same time, politicians and
academicians have been question
ing whether the youths of America
have a responsibility to serve their
community and their country in one
way or another.
Several high schools have made
a summer of volunteer community
work a requirement for graduation;
an increasing number of law schools
have agreed to forgive student loans
to students who agree to practice
law in the public sector after grad
uation. Thousands of young people
in America apply for limited spots
in the Peace Corps every year;
thousands of others wish they could,
but don't have the financial security
to take the time away from a more
lucrative job. At the same time,
community organizations suffer
from lack of money and volunteer
help.
With the rising costs of college
and the need for college students
to have some sort of goal for their
post-college years, campus Reserve
Officer Training Corps (ROTC) has
been extremely successful. The

every year; thousands

benefits are immense: full college
tuition, security in the years after
college and a sense of commitment
and self-worth. Hundreds of
thousands of high school seniors
apply to ROTC hoping to trade
military service for a college career.
There is probably an equal number
of students out there who would
gladly trade a few years of non
military service for a college career.
Wouldn't an alternate service col
lege training program for the Peace
Corps, VISTA and other non
military organizations be just as suc
cessful as ROTC? In today's soci
ety, in which much of the younger
generation is fearful of or uni
nterested in military service, there
is a need for this type of parallel
option that could offer similar ed
ucational benefits to a wider variety
of young people.
The institution of a training pro

gram in college to serve in national
or international nonmilitary organ-;
izations has several positive effects^
• Similar to ROTC, such a program;
would give hundreds of students;
across the country the chance to;
finance a college education.
• Domestic and international or
ganizatins would receive well-'
trained, committed volunteers for
a large block of time. This would
benefit community organizations'
who frequently have trouble in-;
stituting long-term projects because
of the high turnover rate and lack
of reliability of volunteers; it would
also benefit international organiza-.
tions, which could spend less time
on their own language and technical
training of volunteers, sending them
for several extra months into the
field.
• The benefits of a military training
program would be spread to a larger
group of people: leadership train
ing, responsibility acceptance, per
sonal confidence building. Young
people could still learn about com
mitment, setting goals and finding
worth in our society, and at the
same time they would benefit the
community.
A bill to allocate funding for this
project is already on the U.S. Sen
ate floor. Chances are, with the
state of our economy, it will not
pass this year or next. Stanford Uni
versity in the last decade has been
at the forefront of promoting the
value of public service. Why can't
Stanford pioneer this new program
and stand as a model for America
of world service training?
