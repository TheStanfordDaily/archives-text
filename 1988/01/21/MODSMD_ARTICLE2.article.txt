'This lunch is for the birds'
Two blackbirds enjoy a hearty lunch yesterday afternoon in front of Tresidder Union.
The pair apparently survived Tresidder's use of poisonous grain last week to scare
birds away from the area. Putting their lives in possible danger, the birds re-entered
the war zone to enjoy a lunch for lovebirds at a very "cheep" price.
