## A
						money-making machine: The ASSU strikes it rich 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
This is the first in a series on the
ASSU's finances.

Big business has come to Stan
ford University. Not suddenly, and
not without prior warning, the As
sociated Students of Stanford Uni
versity has gradually become a very
wealthy organization.
The student government main
tains a reserve of over $1.5 million
in various long-term investments to
hedge against potential losses, ac
cording to ASSU Financial
Manager Viviennc Huang, a senior.
The 1987-88 operating budget
outlines $381,676 to be spent by
the ASSU this year.
How the ASSU raises this kind
of money has been a matter of great
confusion to many students.
While nearly half of the ASSU's
income comes from the University,
$195,671 of the ASSU operating
budget is expected to come from
investments, ASSU business proj
ects and cost recovery.
"The ASSU itself does not use
money from the Special Fee (the
$24 each student contributes every
quarter) to run the ASSU. We do
get a subsidy for administering the
system," Huang said.
Most of the ASSU reserve fund
of over $1.5 million is invested in
various long-term investments
which are conservatively scheduled
to raise $36,675, or 4.5 percent in
terest. This money is not spent, but
reinvested.
Because the profit from these
long-term investments is not con
sidered spendable income, it does
not figure in the ASSU's normal
budget.
This year, the ASSU is expected
to make over $46,000 from short
term investments. This sum is not
re-invested. The capital which
generates this profit comes, in part,
from the year's operating funds, so
it is invested "extremely conser
vatively," Huang said.
The ASSU business projects,
which are scheduled to clear nearly
$70,000 this school year, include
the Advertising Agency, Sunday
Flicks, Lecture Notes, Special Proj
ects, T-Shirts and Typesetting.

Each project is semi-independent
and overseen by a student director.
Although the financial manager
oversees the general operation of
each business, the day-to-day con
cerns of operation are usually left
to the director.
Sunday Flicks easily provides the
major share of the revenue from
business projects. Huang admitted
that the ASSU budgets very con
servatively, since the money
projected as profit is spent over the
course of the year. If a project were
to fall short of its goal, the amount
would have to be covered out of
the reserves.

The student govern
ment maintains a
reserve of over $1.5
million in various long
term investments to
hedge against potential
losses.

Sunday Flicks, which shows films
once and sometimes twice a week
in Memorial Auditorium, is sched
uled to clear $34,200 in profit over
three quarters. Senior Bob Litle,
director of the Sunday Flicks, said
that projection is "pretty close," al
though it "might be a little conser
vative."
Litle described the profit from
his project as fairly constant from
year to year, but said that it varies
from quarter to quarter. Fall quar
ter, especially, when a high percen
tage of incoming freshmen buy
passes, usually brings in more
money than the others.
Chemistry and calculus students
will not be surprised to hear that
the second most profitable ASSU
project is Lecture Notes.
The service provides printed
review notes for certain classes.
Copying services are also provided
by the project for students and or
ganizations at rates that are
"cheaper than other companies,"
said senior Donna Regenbaum, di
rector of Lecture Notes.
The ASSU projects that the pro
gram will raise just over $12,000 in

the operating budget, but Regen
baum said "that is very low. Last
year we netted over $20,000."
According to Regenbaum, the
service is constantly looking for
areas in which to expand. This year,
notetakers were provided "for lots
of new classes. Some took off, and
some really dived."
The limiting factor on the growth
of Lecture Notes is that only certain
classes are large enough to support
the service, Regenbaum said.
Aside from these well-known ser
vices, the oddballs of the ASSU
business projects are grouped under
Special Projects. The programs that
fall under this title are "not de
signed to do any one thing," ac
cording to Special Projects Director
Chris Nadan, a senior. Special Proj
ects is a catch-all title which in
cludes the Linen Service, among
other programs.
The refrigerators which the busi
ness used to rent to students,
through the ASSU Refrigerator
Rental service, were sold this year
"for several thousand dollars,"
Nadan said. This sum will either
go to Special Projects or to the
general fund of the ASSU.
To expand Special Projects, a
Stanford Bagel Service is in the
works and an ASSU-sponsored va
cation open to the general student
body is also being considered.
Nadan also noted that the ASSU
"budgets very conservatively," and
said he expected this year's profits
from Special Projects to be compa
rable to last year's $14,000, as op
posed to the $8800 projected for
this year by the operating budget.
The remaining three projects —
Ad Agency, T-Shirts and Typeset
ting — account for $13,521 of the
ASSU's projected profit this year.
Students are increasingly taking
advantage of the new Drycleaning
Service which is located on the back
patio of the second floor of Tres
idder Union.
Although the project is not ex
pected to make a profit according
to the operating budget, junior Ira
Williams, the project director, said
he "hopes to be a couple thousand
(dollars) in the black by the end
of winter quarter."
