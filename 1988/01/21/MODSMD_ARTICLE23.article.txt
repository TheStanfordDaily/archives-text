# Gamer takes on Scrabble
## 
### Paul DeFigueiredo 
Whenever I am out on a first
date the conversation inevitably
turns to hobbies.
After my date finishes telling
me about her interests in plasma
physics, Beethoven sonatas and
Ironman triathlons, she will ask
what my favorite pastimes are.

My standard reply is that "I
like to play all sorts of games."
More often than not this reply
gets me into trouble.
But when I say I like games, I
do not mean those kinds of games,
but instead the kinds of games I
loved as a kid and still enjoy
playing today. This column is ded
icated to games such as chess,
checkers, Monopoly and cards.
Each week I will present some
of the history or strategy behind
a well-known game, introduce an
obscure or archaic game, or offer
a puzzle or brain teaser to be
solved.
One of mv favorite games is

Scrabble. It is also one of the few
games in which I can still defeat
my 10-year-old brother (but just
barely).
Bouyed by continued success
against my younger sibling, I
decided to test my Scrabble skills
against a more serious (and post
pubescent) adversary once back
at Stanford.
The outcome of this second
game was devastating for my ego.
Using words like "cassia," a va
riety of cinnamon, and "roque,"
a form of croquet, my seasoned
opponent easily doubled my
score, and baptized me into the
world of the competitive Scrabble
player.
The serious Scrabble player will
most likely know all of the 86
allowable two letter words — e.g.
"aa" (basaltic lava) and "ai" (a
large sloth) — as well as most of
the 908 allowable three letter
words — e.g. "eke" (to supple
ment) and "kea" (a New Zealand
parrot) — listed in the Official
Scrabble Players' Dictionary.
Clearly Scrabble has come a
long way since its humble begin
nings.
The precurser of the modern
day game of Scrabble was in
vented during the Depression by
Alfred M. Butts, a New York ar
chitect. In his original game,

which he called "Lexico," there
was no playing board, and the
tiles were made out of cardboard.
But in 1948, after standardizing
a set of 100 wooden tiles and
creating a board upon which to
play, James Brunot, a friend of
Butts, began to market the game
which he called Scrabble.
Although Brunot sold fewer
than 2000 copies of the game in
his first year, by 1952 Scrabble
was outselling all other word
games in the market.
Today Scrabble is still one of
the world's best-selling board
games and is produced in seven
different languages.
The Spanish version of the
game contains tiles with the char
acters "11" and "rr", just as "ae"
and "th" are standard in the
Icelandic version. Scrabble
players' associations with official
tournaments and championships
have also been established.
"The Guinness Book of World
Records" recognizes Scrabble
records for the highest score in
one turn (392), and the highest
score by one player (1843) in a
three-game tournament series.
Scrabble is indeed a game that
can be enjoyed at any level of
play, but I think players will find


the greatest satisfaction (and most
victories) when competing, as I
have, against younger, preferably
preliterate, siblings.
PUZZLES
Test your word-building abilities
with the following puzzles:
1. Given the following Scrabble
"trays" of seven letters each, form
words to gain the maximum number
of points.
One need not necessarily use all
the letters in a tray. The numerals
alongside each letter indicate the
number of points a player will
receive for using that letter in a
word. The trays are arranged in
order of increasing difficulty.
a. c 3, 11, al, nl, h4, y4
(score fifth-letter double)
b. nl, nl, al, p3, w4, rl, si
c. d 2, rl, il, il, v4, si, c 3
d. al, ql, si, d 2, il, nl, m 3 (score
first letter triple)
2. Use only vowels to fill in the
blanks to form a word.
q
3. Use only consonants to fill in
the blanks to form words.

a. - - y
b. — c
4. Can you give a word (more than
seven letters) that uses all the
