## All-night diners cure the midnight munchies 
### Ceri Jones Susan Stellin 
Some things never change ... bed
sheets, Molly Ringwald, the sample
study list on the back of the Time
Schedule and 24-hour restaurants.
"Open 24 hours" is a slogan you
can depend on. It may not mean
good coffee, service with a smile or
restrooms fit for human use, but it
does mean at least an hour away
from the most tedious of problem
sets.
Hut not all 24-hour restaurants
are created equal. In fact, within
the vicinity of Stanford, we discov
ered three eateries providing
unique nocturnal diversions.
Though they could be classed within
the same genre, University
Creamery, Denny's and Lyon's offer
three distinctly different dining ex
periences.
If economy is your top priority,
Denny's (4256 El Camino Real,
south of campus) is the best bar
gain. A basket o' fries is a mere
$1.25, a milkshake only $1.55, and
an order of toast a steal at 75 cents.
Both Lyon's and University
Creamery charge slightly higher
prices, particularly for the ever
popular milkshake. A shake at
Lyon's (4298 El Camino Real, just
past Denny's) will set you back
$2.25, and the Creamery (209 Uni
versity Ave.) charges an audacious
$2.75
If you are willing to spend the
extra few dollars for quality, we'd

recommend either Lyon's or the
Creamery. Although Denny's boasts
a colorful 11-page menu, quantity
does not necessarily ensure quality.
We found the best milkshake at
the Creamery; the bittersweet choc
olate was a special favorite. For
french-fry connoisseurs, Lyon's of
fers the thick-cut variety while both
Denny's and the Creamery stick to
the regular straight-cut style.
Denny's redeeming cuisine can
be found on the breakfast page,
particularly the hash browns and,
as one reviewer noted, "The toast
is really good here."
The coffee at Denny's is
notorious, though, with the coffee
at the Creamery vying for the honor
at a close second. Coffee can be
ordered at Lyon's in various alco
holic or non-alcoholic forms, as ad
vertised by the dog-eared card next
to the salt and pepper shakers.
Though service is almost an af
terthought at two in the morning,
we found it one of the defining
characteristics of the late-night
dining experience.
Denny's is famous for waitresses
with three-letter names — such as
"Ova" and "Dee" — who are
genuinely willing to go the extra
mile. It may seem like there actually
is a mile between you and a glass
of water, but pleasant service gen
erally makes up for the long wait.
At Denny's, we boldly requested
a coffee milkshake that was not
listed on the menu, and our waitress

valiantly attempted to fulfill the re
quest. However, adding hot coffee
to a vanilla milkshake did not turn
out to be such a good idea.
Service at the Creamery can only
be described as sluggish and un
willing at best. A request for a refill
on coffee was received as a gross
imposition, and we wouldn't rec
ommend requesting any milkshake
flavor not listed on the menu here.
The Creamery has been around
since 1917, though, so congenial
service is obviously not a top
priority among Palo Alto residents.
As for Lyon's, the service can only
be described as quick and efficient.
Aside from other considerations,
we found aesthetics of prime im
portance when seeking refuge
during the wee hours. Choosing a
24-hour restaurant is like choosing
an ice cream flavor: It has to suit
your mood.
Denny's is infamous for its orange
and fuschia "Help me, I'm trapped
in the Big Top" motif and is prob
ably not the best place to read
Kafka.
While a run-of-the-mill critic
might call the Creamery "com
fortable," we'd hate to mislead
anyone, because its booths were
certainly not designed with comfort
in mind. However, it does have the
lived-in feel characteristic of all
good diners and an old jukebox in
back.
Of the three all-night emporiums,
Lyon's definitely has the most

soothing atmosphere. Decorated in
shades of forest green and brown,
the restaurant's lighting is low
enough to camouflage the natural
appearance of anyone awake past
3 a.m. but bright enough to read
the menu. The semi-secluded cir
cular booths are comfortable
enough to fall asleep in, yet not so
private as to obscure the conversa
tions of nearby customers.
While sit-down restaurants have
their merits, there is another way

to satisfy those late-night munchies
without the hassles of poor service,
cold coffee, dirty ashtrays or un
comfortable booths: Safeway.
Once eloquently described as
"the most fun you can have (after
midnight) with your clothes on," a
visit to Safeway during single-digit
morning hours gives a whole new
meaning to buying tissue.
Only at Safeway is the service
actually better late at night. Cas
hiers don't care after 11 p.m. if you

read the entire issue of People mag
azine without buying it. You can
go through the express lane with
more than 11 items and not even
have to wait in line to do so.
As for variety, even Denny's 11-
page menu pales in comparison to
Safeway's array of processed
cookies, flavored potato chips, pints
of ice cream, bins of bulk foods,
rows of soft drinks, shelves of candy
bars and tables of baked goods.
And Safeway, too, is open 24 hours.
