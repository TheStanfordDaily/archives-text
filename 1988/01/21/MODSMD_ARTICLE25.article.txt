## Johnson anchors Card swimmers 
### David Hirning 
Swimming is undoubtedly a very
individualized sport, and Stanford
junior Jenna Johnson has done ex
ceedingly well on her own. She
enters this year with five individual
NCAA titles and an indivdual silver
medal at the 1984 Olympics to her
•Credit.
But, while pursuing individual ex
cellence Johnson has also been able
io contribute to team efforts, win
ning two gold medals and four
NGAA crowns as a member of
Various relay teams. This year the
sprinter hopes to do well in both
individual and team events, and in
so doing help the Cardinal to an
NCAA championship and then
strike gold in the 1988 Summer
Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
Right now is a busy time for
Johnson and the rest of the Cardi
nal squad, with some important
dual meets slated for the next
month. On Feb. 6, defending na
tional champion Texas visits
deGuerre Pool in a big matchup
for both teams.
Texas nosed Stanford out for the
NCAA title by a mere 17 points
last year, and the two teams are
again considered to be tops in the
country. The winner will have a
tremendous psychological advan
tage in the NCAA championships
in late March.
However, the NCAAs are not so
much an end for the Cardinal as
they are a beginning. The swimmers
get a week off before returning to
prepare for nationals or, as in
Johnson's case, the Olympic trials.
As she has already qualified for the
NCAAs, all that remains is to train
hard for what lies ahead. But how
does she handle trying to focus on
two big events at once?
"I have the Olympics in the back
of my head at all times," Johnson
said, "but I have to think about the
NCAAs first. And when I'm
working hard in the pool, I'm think
ing about the NCAAs but I'm think
ing about the Olympics too."

Junior Jenna Johnson would like nothing more Chan an NCAA team title to go along with the three Olympic
medals she has already won.
Of course, Johnson is not alone
in having more than just the
NCAAs to think about. Many mem
bers of Stanford's team are looking
towards the trials or other national
and international competition. As
teammate and two-time Olympian
Susan Rapp put it, "Anything you
do (for the NCAAs) will carry over
to the Olympics."
Even the Olympic coach himself
sees no conflict. Richard Quick,
who is the head women's swimming
coach of arch-rival Texas as well as
head of the Olympic staff, said, "Je
nna is going to have a terrific
NCAAs and it shouldn't interfere
with her preparation for the Olym
pics."
With world-class times in the
freestyle and butterfly sprints,
Johnson is very versatile and is con
sidered to be one of the best overall
swimmers in the world. She began
swimming at age eight and her tal
ent quickly emerged. By the time
she was 12, she was swimming year
round, a big step for her.
Always bigger than her peers, she
kept encountering better competi
tion and "getting humbled," as she
put it. It was almost on a whim
that she decided to enter the Olym
pic trials at age 16. She was un
known and impossibly naive about
the world of international swim
ming. Yet her raw speed and nat
ural ability qualified her for the

butterfly and two 400-metcr relays.
And the rest, as they say, is history.
Today, everything is much differ
ent. "Sometimes, when I think
about it, it doesn't seem like it really
happened," Johnson said of her
Olympic experience. "I keep finding
myself comparing myself to what 1
was then, and I can't do that be
cause I don't have the same body
at all. At sixteen, I weighed 20
pounds less and I wasn't very
strong. I was mostly speed."
At Stanford, Johnson has not
only hit the weight room but has
also grown to her full height, a
lanky 6-foot-2.
This frame may be her major
asset. In the pool, she has a great
physical advantage. Rapp says
Johnson's kick is one of her greatest
assets, and something that makes
her a great sprinter. George Haines,
Stanford's women's swimming
coach, likes Johnson's quickness
and ability to concentrate under
pressure. But, in the end, it seems
that you could simply describe
Johnson as a born swimmer.
Johnson looks at her ability as a
gift. "I sec it as a God-given talent.
I swim because God has given me
the ability. That doesn't mean I
don't have to work hard, because
I do. But if swimming is part of
God's plan for me, then I will work
hard for that plan," she said.
Johnson is working especially
hard this year, and it shows. "She's
now swimming as well as she ever
has," Haines said. "She has more
physical strength than ever before,

and her workouts have been very
solid."
Haines, who has seen a lot in
over 30 years of coaching swimming
(including seven stints on the Olym
pic staff) called Johnson "equal to
anyone" he's ever coached.
"Johnson is right up there with the
great ones," he said.

i see it as a God
given talent. I swim
because God has given
me the ability. That
doesn't mean I don't
have to work hard, be
cause I do.'

One would assume that for a
swimmer of Johnson's stature, the
Olympics would be much more im
portant than the NCAAs. Not true,
she says. "I've already won an
Olympic gold medal, but I've never
won an NCAA team championship.
It would be a tremendous thing for
the team," she said.
Indeed, no current Cardinal
member has been able to experi
ence the thrill of winning an NCAA
championship — Stanford last won
the title in 1983. Jenna takes a lot
of pride in swimming for her school
and for her coaches. Swimming for
her country is "cool, but it's weird."
But even though she's won Olym
pic medals before, the second time

will be just as challenging, if dif
ferent. Johnson says her wins in
1984 will have two effects on her
1988 performance: First, she should
be used to the pressure, she has
experience in international compe
tition and she knows what to expect;
second, on the other hand she has
to face higher expectation from her
self and others, and she said she
"thinks" more now. "I have a ten
dency to overanalyze things,"
Johnson said.
In addition, the fast-swimming
Eastern-bloc nations will be com
peting in Seoul, unlike in 1984 when
a Soviet-led boycott of the Olympics
gave the Americans a decided ad
vantage.
Of course, Johnson doesn't have
an automatic berth in the Olympics.
There are the trials to get through.
Only the top two finishers in each
event qualify for the games. Com
petition in the U.S. is so fierce that
the third place in the trials would
be likely to get the bronze in South
Korea.
Still, optimism abounds for
Johnson, and the consensus is she
will get to the Olympics and do
well. "She has an excellent chance
at a medal. In my opinion, she has
the physical attributes and the com
petitiveness to have a real shot at
a gold medal," Quick said.
Johnson may overanalyze, but at
times it is necessary. When hun
dredths of a second separate swim
mers, mental concentration is key.
"A lot of times, in the difference
between first and second, the onlv

thing holding you back is your
head," she said.
But, she does not do it alone.
She cited both Haines and Quick
as giving her confidence and sup
port that have helped her very
much. In addition, assistant coach
Terry Carlisle has been important
in refining her technique. Johnson
said that there is always room for
improvement, and the gold medalist
has raised her level since freshman
year, according to Rapp.
This is a hectic year for Johnson,
and next year will be much easier,
as she finishes her Stanford career.
But what about the future? Johnson
won't rule out staying around for
the 1992 games. "It depends on this
year. If I make it (the Olympic
team) and my times in the NCAAs
arc better senior year, I might want
to keep swimming," she said.
Another factor in this decision
will be her career. A communica
tions major, Johnson has had con
flicts at Stanford between sports
and academics, and she said
academics have often taken a back
seat. But in the long run, she hopes
to get into broadcasting, and swim
ming will be second-place. "I'll play
it by ear," Johnson said.
For now, this young star has
plenty on her hands. Coming off a
sophomore year plagued by illness,
she is concentrating on staying
healthy and getting in great shape.
With Johnson in top form, the Car
dinal squad is a formidable force.
As Quick put it, "She's the key —
she's the heart of that team."

about it, it doesn't seem like it really
happened," Johnson said of her
Olympic experience. "I keep finding
myself comparing myself to what 1
was then, and I can't do that be
cause I don't have the same body
at all. At sixteen, I weighed 20
pounds less and I wasn't very
strong. I was mostly speed."
At Stanford, Johnson has not
only hit the weight room but has
also grown to her full height, a
lanky 6-foot-2.
This frame may be her major
asset. In the pool, she has a great
physical advantage. Rapp says
Johnson's kick is one of her greatest
assets, and something that makes
her a great sprinter. George Haines,
Stanford's women's swimming
coach, likes Johnson's quickness
and ability to concentrate under
pressure. But, in the end, it seems
that you could simply describe
Johnson as a born swimmer.
Johnson looks at her ability as a
gift. "I sec it as a God-given talent.
I swim because God has given me
the ability. That doesn't mean I
don't have to work hard, because
I do. But if swimming is part of
God's plan for me, then I will work
hard for that plan," she said.
Johnson is working especially
hard this year, and it shows. "She's
now swimming as well as she ever
has," Haines said. "She has more
physical strength than ever before,

and her workouts have been very
solid."
Haines, who has seen a lot in
over 30 years of coaching swimming
(including seven stints on the Olym
pic staff) called Johnson "equal to
anyone" he's ever coached.
"Johnson is right up there with the
great ones," he said.

i see it as a God
given talent. I swim
because God has given
me the ability. That
doesn't mean I don't
have to work hard, be
cause I do.'

One would assume that for a
swimmer of Johnson's stature, the
Olympics would be much more im
portant than the NCAAs. Not true,
she says. "I've already won an
Olympic gold medal, but I've never
won an NCAA team championship.
It would be a tremendous thing for
the team," she said.
Indeed, no current Cardinal
member has been able to experi
ence the thrill of winning an NCAA
championship — Stanford last won
the title in 1983. Jenna takes a lot
of pride in swimming for her school
and for her coaches. Swimming for
her country is "cool, but it's weird."
But even though she's won Olym
pic medals before, the second time

will be just as challenging, if dif
ferent. Johnson says her wins in
1984 will have two effects on her
1988 performance: First, she should
be used to the pressure, she has
experience in international compe
tition and she knows what to expect;
second, on the other hand she has
to face higher expectation from her
self and others, and she said she
"thinks" more now. "I have a ten
dency to overanalyze things,"
Johnson said.
In addition, the fast-swimming
Eastern-bloc nations will be com
peting in Seoul, unlike in 1984 when
a Soviet-led boycott of the Olympics
gave the Americans a decided ad
vantage.
Of course, Johnson doesn't have
an automatic berth in the Olympics.
There are the trials to get through.
Only the top two finishers in each
event qualify for the games. Com
petition in the U.S. is so fierce that
the third place in the trials would
be likely to get the bronze in South
Korea.
Still, optimism abounds for
Johnson, and the consensus is she
will get to the Olympics and do
well. "She has an excellent chance
at a medal. In my opinion, she has
the physical attributes and the com
petitiveness to have a real shot at
a gold medal," Quick said.
Johnson may overanalyze, but at
times it is necessary. When hun
dredths of a second separate swim
mers, mental concentration is key.
"A lot of times, in the difference
between first and second, the onlv

thing holding you back is your
head," she said.
But, she does not do it alone.
She cited both Haines and Quick
as giving her confidence and sup
port that have helped her very
much. In addition, assistant coach
Terry Carlisle has been important
in refining her technique. Johnson
said that there is always room for
improvement, and the gold medalist
has raised her level since freshman
year, according to Rapp.
This is a hectic year for Johnson,
and next year will be much easier,
as she finishes her Stanford career.
But what about the future? Johnson
won't rule out staying around for
the 1992 games. "It depends on this
year. If I make it (the Olympic
team) and my times in the NCAAs
arc better senior year, I might want
to keep swimming," she said.
Another factor in this decision
will be her career. A communica
tions major, Johnson has had con
flicts at Stanford between sports
and academics, and she said
academics have often taken a back
seat. But in the long run, she hopes
to get into broadcasting, and swim
ming will be second-place. "I'll play
it by ear," Johnson said.
For now, this young star has
plenty on her hands. Coming off a
sophomore year plagued by illness,
she is concentrating on staying
healthy and getting in great shape.
With Johnson in top form, the Car
dinal squad is a formidable force.
As Quick put it, "She's the key —
she's the heart of that team."
Swimming is undoubtedly a very
individualized sport, and Stanford
junior Jenna Johnson has done ex
ceedingly well on her own. She
enters this year with five individual
NCAA titles and an indivdual silver
medal at the 1984 Olympics to her
•Credit.
But, while pursuing individual ex
cellence Johnson has also been able
io contribute to team efforts, win
ning two gold medals and four
NGAA crowns as a member of
Various relay teams. This year the
sprinter hopes to do well in both
individual and team events, and in
so doing help the Cardinal to an
NCAA championship and then
strike gold in the 1988 Summer
Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
Right now is a busy time for
Johnson and the rest of the Cardi
nal squad, with some important
dual meets slated for the next
month. On Feb. 6, defending na
tional champion Texas visits
deGuerre Pool in a big matchup
for both teams.
Texas nosed Stanford out for the
NCAA title by a mere 17 points
last year, and the two teams are
again considered to be tops in the
country. The winner will have a
tremendous psychological advan
tage in the NCAA championships
in late March.
However, the NCAAs are not so
much an end for the Cardinal as
they are a beginning. The swimmers
get a week off before returning to
prepare for nationals or, as in
Johnson's case, the Olympic trials.
As she has already qualified for the
NCAAs, all that remains is to train
hard for what lies ahead. But how
does she handle trying to focus on
two big events at once?
"I have the Olympics in the back
of my head at all times," Johnson
said, "but I have to think about the
NCAAs first. And when I'm
working hard in the pool, I'm think
ing about the NCAAs but I'm think
ing about the Olympics too."

Junior Jenna Johnson would like nothing more Chan an NCAA team title to go along with the three Olympic
medals she has already won.
Of course, Johnson is not alone
in having more than just the
NCAAs to think about. Many mem
bers of Stanford's team are looking
towards the trials or other national
and international competition. As
teammate and two-time Olympian
Susan Rapp put it, "Anything you
do (for the NCAAs) will carry over
to the Olympics."
Even the Olympic coach himself
sees no conflict. Richard Quick,
who is the head women's swimming
coach of arch-rival Texas as well as
head of the Olympic staff, said, "Je
nna is going to have a terrific
NCAAs and it shouldn't interfere
with her preparation for the Olym
pics."
With world-class times in the
freestyle and butterfly sprints,
Johnson is very versatile and is con
sidered to be one of the best overall
swimmers in the world. She began
swimming at age eight and her tal
ent quickly emerged. By the time
she was 12, she was swimming year
round, a big step for her.
Always bigger than her peers, she
kept encountering better competi
tion and "getting humbled," as she
put it. It was almost on a whim
that she decided to enter the Olym
pic trials at age 16. She was un
known and impossibly naive about
the world of international swim
ming. Yet her raw speed and nat
ural ability qualified her for the

butterfly and two 400-metcr relays.
And the rest, as they say, is history.
Today, everything is much differ
ent. "Sometimes, when I think
about it, it doesn't seem like it really
happened," Johnson said of her
Olympic experience. "I keep finding

petition in the U.S. is so fierce that
the third place in the trials would
be likely to get the bronze in South
Korea.
Still, optimism abounds for
Johnson, and the consensus is she
will get to the Olympics and do
well. "She has an excellent chance
at a medal. In my opinion, she has
the physical attributes and the com
petitiveness to have a real shot at
a gold medal," Quick said.
Johnson may overanalyze, but at
times it is necessary. When hun
dredths of a second separate swim
mers, mental concentration is key.
"A lot of times, in the difference
between first and second, the onlv

thing holding you back is your
head," she said.
But, she does not do it alone.
She cited both Haines and Quick
as giving her confidence and sup
port that have helped her very
much. In addition, assistant coach
Terry Carlisle has been important
in refining her technique. Johnson
said that there is always room for
improvement, and the gold medalist
has raised her level since freshman
year, according to Rapp.
This is a hectic year for Johnson,
and next year will be much easier,
as she finishes her Stanford career.
But what about the future? Johnson
won't rule out staying around for
the 1992 games. "It depends on this
year. If I make it (the Olympic
team) and my times in the NCAAs
arc better senior year, I might want
to keep swimming," she said.
Another factor in this decision
will be her career. A communica
tions major, Johnson has had con
flicts at Stanford between sports
and academics, and she said
academics have often taken a back
seat. But in the long run, she hopes
to get into broadcasting, and swim
ming will be second-place. "I'll play
it by ear," Johnson said.
For now, this young star has
plenty on her hands. Coming off a
sophomore year plagued by illness,
she is concentrating on staying
healthy and getting in great shape.
With Johnson in top form, the Car
dinal squad is a formidable force.
As Quick put it, "She's the key —
she's the heart of that team."
Swimming is undoubtedly a very
individualized sport, and Stanford
junior Jenna Johnson has done ex
ceedingly well on her own. She
enters this year with five individual
NCAA titles and an indivdual silver
medal at the 1984 Olympics to her
•Credit.
But, while pursuing individual ex
cellence Johnson has also been able
io contribute to team efforts, win
ning two gold medals and four
NGAA crowns as a member of
Various relay teams. This year the
sprinter hopes to do well in both
individual and team events, and in
so doing help the Cardinal to an
NCAA championship and then
strike gold in the 1988 Summer
Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
Right now is a busy time for
Johnson and the rest of the Cardi
nal squad, with some important
dual meets slated for the next
month. On Feb. 6, defending na
tional champion Texas visits
deGuerre Pool in a big matchup
for both teams.
Texas nosed Stanford out for the
NCAA title by a mere 17 points
last year, and the two teams are
again considered to be tops in the
country. The winner will have a
tremendous psychological advan
tage in the NCAA championships
in late March.
However, the NCAAs are not so
much an end for the Cardinal as
they are a beginning. The swimmers
get a week off before returning to
prepare for nationals or, as in
Johnson's case, the Olympic trials.
As she has already qualified for the
NCAAs, all that remains is to train
hard for what lies ahead. But how
does she handle trying to focus on
two big events at once?
"I have the Olympics in the back
of my head at all times," Johnson
said, "but I have to think about the
NCAAs first. And when I'm
working hard in the pool, I'm think
ing about the NCAAs but I'm think
ing about the Olympics too."

Junior Jenna Johnson would like nothing more Chan an NCAA team title to go along with the three Olympic
medals she has already won.
Of course, Johnson is not alone
in having more than just the
NCAAs to think about. Many mem
bers of Stanford's team are looking
towards the trials or other national
and international competition. As
teammate and two-time Olympian
Susan Rapp put it, "Anything you
do (for the NCAAs) will carry over
to the Olympics."
Even the Olympic coach himself
sees no conflict. Richard Quick,
who is the head women's swimming
coach of arch-rival Texas as well as
head of the Olympic staff, said, "Je
nna is going to have a terrific
NCAAs and it shouldn't interfere
with her preparation for the Olym
pics."
With world-class times in the
freestyle and butterfly sprints,
Johnson is very versatile and is con
sidered to be one of the best overall
swimmers in the world. She began
swimming at age eight and her tal
ent quickly emerged. By the time
she was 12, she was swimming year
round, a big step for her.
Always bigger than her peers, she
kept encountering better competi
tion and "getting humbled," as she
put it. It was almost on a whim
that she decided to enter the Olym
pic trials at age 16. She was un
known and impossibly naive about
the world of international swim
ming. Yet her raw speed and nat
ural ability qualified her for the

butterfly and two 400-metcr relays.
And the rest, as they say, is history.
Today, everything is much differ
ent. "Sometimes, when I think
about it, it doesn't seem like it really
happened," Johnson said of her
Olympic experience. "I keep finding
myself comparing myself to what 1
was then, and I can't do that be
cause I don't have the same body
at all. At sixteen, I weighed 20
pounds less and I wasn't very
strong. I was mostly speed."
At Stanford, Johnson has not
only hit the weight room but has
also grown to her full height, a
lanky 6-foot-2.
This frame may be her major
asset. In the pool, she has a great
physical advantage. Rapp says
Johnson's kick is one of her greatest
assets, and something that makes
her a great sprinter. George Haines,
Stanford's women's swimming
coach, likes Johnson's quickness
and ability to concentrate under
pressure. But, in the end, it seems
that you could simply describe
Johnson as a born swimmer.
Johnson looks at her ability as a
gift. "I sec it as a God-given talent.
I swim because God has given me
the ability. That doesn't mean I
don't have to work hard, because
I do. But if swimming is part of
God's plan for me, then I will work
hard for that plan," she said.
Johnson is working especially
hard this year, and it shows. "She's
now swimming as well as she ever
has," Haines said. "She has more
physical strength than ever before,

and her workouts have been very
solid."
Haines, who has seen a lot in
over 30 years of coaching swimming
(including seven stints on the Olym
pic staff) called Johnson "equal to
anyone" he's ever coached.
"Johnson is right up there with the
great ones," he said.

i see it as a God
given talent. I swim
because God has given
me the ability. That
doesn't mean I don't
have to work hard, be
cause I do.'

One would assume that for a
swimmer of Johnson's stature, the
Olympics would be much more im
portant than the NCAAs. Not true,
she says. "I've already won an
Olympic gold medal, but I've never
won an NCAA team championship.
It would be a tremendous thing for
the team," she said.
Indeed, no current Cardinal
member has been able to experi
ence the thrill of winning an NCAA
championship — Stanford last won
the title in 1983. Jenna takes a lot
of pride in swimming for her school
and for her coaches. Swimming for
her country is "cool, but it's weird."
But even though she's won Olym
pic medals before, the second time

will be just as challenging, if dif
ferent. Johnson says her wins in
1984 will have two effects on her
1988 performance: First, she should
be used to the pressure, she has
experience in international compe
tition and she knows what to expect;
second, on the other hand she has
to face higher expectation from her
self and others, and she said she
"thinks" more now. "I have a ten
dency to overanalyze things,"
Johnson said.
In addition, the fast-swimming
Eastern-bloc nations will be com
peting in Seoul, unlike in 1984 when
a Soviet-led boycott of the Olympics
gave the Americans a decided ad
vantage.
Of course, Johnson doesn't have
an automatic berth in the Olympics.
There are the trials to get through.
Only the top two finishers in each
event qualify for the games. Com
petition in the U.S. is so fierce that
the third place in the trials would
be likely to get the bronze in South
Korea.
Still, optimism abounds for
Johnson, and the consensus is she
will get to the Olympics and do
well. "She has an excellent chance
at a medal. In my opinion, she has
the physical attributes and the com
petitiveness to have a real shot at
a gold medal," Quick said.
Johnson may overanalyze, but at

dredths of a second separate swim

"A lot of times, in the difference
between first and second, the onlv
