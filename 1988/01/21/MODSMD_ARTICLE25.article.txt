## Johnson anchors Card swimmers 
### David Hirning 
Swimming is undoubtedly a very
individualized sport, and Stanford
junior Jenna Johnson has done ex
ceedingly well on her own. She
enters this year with five individual
NCAA titles and an indivdual silver
medal at the 1984 Olympics to her
â€¢Credit.
But, while pursuing individual ex
cellence Johnson has also been able
io contribute to team efforts, win
ning two gold medals and four
NGAA crowns as a member of
Various relay teams. This year the
sprinter hopes to do well in both
individual and team events, and in
so doing help the Cardinal to an
NCAA championship and then
strike gold in the 1988 Summer
Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
Right now is a busy time for
Johnson and the rest of the Cardi
nal squad, with some important
dual meets slated for the next
month. On Feb. 6, defending na
tional champion Texas visits
deGuerre Pool in a big matchup
for both teams.
Texas nosed Stanford out for the
NCAA title by a mere 17 points
last year, and the two teams are
again considered to be tops in the
country. The winner will have a
tremendous psychological advan
tage in the NCAA championships
in late March.
However, the NCAAs are not so
much an end for the Cardinal as
they are a beginning. The swimmers
get a week off before returning to
prepare for nationals or, as in
Johnson's case, the Olympic trials.
As she has already qualified for the
NCAAs, all that remains is to train
hard for what lies ahead. But how
does she handle trying to focus on
two big events at once?
"I have the Olympics in the back
of my head at all times," Johnson
said, "but I have to think about the
NCAAs first. And when I'm
working hard in the pool, I'm think
ing about the NCAAs but I'm think
ing about the Olympics too."

medals she has already won.
