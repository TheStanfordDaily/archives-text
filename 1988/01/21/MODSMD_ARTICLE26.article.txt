# Never give away the lead for free
## 
### 
Can they be serious? Several
fans have suggested during dis
cussions about Saturday's Wash
ington State victory over Stan
ford that the Cardinal should
have fouled the Cougars when
Stanford was ahead 68-67 with
35 seconds remaining in over
time.

The thought is preposterous.
Mind-boggling.
A foul would have given Wash
ington State at least one free
throw. The key word there is
FREE. A chance to tie the game
with an uninhibited flick of the
wrist.
When you're ahead, you make
the trailing team earn its points.
In fact, you make it earn its
attempts. Never give the other
team a free throw.
Every single coach in the
country would rather be ahead
by one point without the ball
than behind by one point with
the ball. Every trailing team
takes the shot with 10 or 12
seconds left, so if the shot is no
good, there is a chance for an
offensive rebound and a second
shot.
And of course, if the shot is
good, the other team, Stanford
in this case, has eight or 10
seconds to regain the lead. Thus,
logic says you do not foul when
you're ahead. Period.
If the above doesn't convince
you, then let's bust out the cal
culator and take a nerdish num

ber perspective. With 35 seconds
left, the Cougars were shooting
41 percent from the field. Thus,
if Stanford plays tough defense,
Washington State has around a
40 percent chance of taking the
lead.
If Stanford fouls, the Cougars
have about a 63-pcrcent chance
of taking the lead on free throws.
And, expecting Stanford to come
right back and score after shoot
ing horribly in the previous
minutes is expecting too much.

Editor,
With regards to Chris Fialko's
Jan. 14 column, eliminating the
3-point line will only make the
United States less competitive in
international play.
Proof of this is Brazil's upset to
the U.S. team for the gold medal
in the Pan American Games last
summer. Oscar Schmidt and Mar
cel Souza of Brazil crippled an
American team whose only decent
3-point shooter was Rex Chap
man.
FIRA (the international basket
ball federation) will certainly not
eliminate the 3-point line. It's up
to the United States to get better
at it or keep losing basketball
supremacy.
Alfredo Cubina, Stanford.
Ah, here's the tricky question
of international basketball. After
all, Rex Chapman was an 18-ycar
old playing against mostly 25-30-
year-old foreigners.
The issue at hand is whether
college hoops should move the
3-point line back to the interna
tional distance and then play the
thousands of games under that
condition to prepare for only a
handful of international games,
It's not the NCAA's job to
produce gold-medal winners.
