# With three top recruits, netters aim for a title

Dick Gould doesn't rebuild, he
reloads.
In 1982, the Cardinal failed to
receive an NCAA tournament in
vitation. But the following season,
spearheaded by Gould's freshman
corps of Dan Goldie, Jim Grabb,
John Letts and Eric Rosenfcld,
Stanford jumped from an also-ran
to a top NCAA force to defeat
SMU and capture the NCAA
crown. In 1986, the same group
engineered the Cardinal's eighth
championship in the last 16 years.
Last year, the Cardinal went 13-
10 and didn't make the tournament
field for the first time since 1982.
Like the 1983 season, however,
Gould has worked his recruiting
magic this season, reloaded with
another top-notch freshman class,
and is poised to lead the team on
a run at the NCAA title. Last year's
No. 19 team has become this year's
preseason co-No. 1 pick (with Geor
gia).
"Even though the NCAAs arc in
Georgia," Peppcrdine Coach Rich
ard Gallicn said, "I think Stanford
is the team to beat. They have the
most horses."
Indeed, despite an increase in
quality across the board in col
legiate tennis, many pick the
NCAAs as a two-horse race be
tween defending national champion
Georgia, which returns five of its
top seven players and has an out

standing recruiting class of its own,
and the Cardinal.
"The NCAA will be stronger this
year than last year," Georgia Coach
Dan Magill said. "We should see
the return of the Pac-10 [conferen
ce] I voted for Stanford No. 1 and
Georgia No. 2. Stanford had a good
recruiting year, and I have a tre
mendous amount of respect for
Dick Gould."
"We are depending heavily on
three freshmen. (Freshman) Al
Parker, our No. 1 player, has the
most potential of any freshman we
have ever recruited," he added.
Other teams capable of knocking
off the Cardinal and Georgia are
preseason No. 3-ranked USC and
fourth-ranked (tied) LSU and Pcp
perdine. During the long haul, as
Stanford found last year, injuries
can weaken a team, and others can
emerge.
"I think Stanford, Georgia, USC
and LSU are the top teams," Cal
ifornia Coach Scott McCain said.
"Outside of those four, a team that
develops during the season and
ends well may challenge for the
title."
The Cardinal enters the 1988
campaign with something it didn't
have last season — depth. Injuries
to starters Patrick McEnroe, Gordie
McKce and Peter Jacobson
dccimated an already shaky lineup
last year.
But with freshmen David
Wheaton, Martin Blackman, Glenn
Solomon and Dan Turbow joining
senior McEnroe and sophomores

Jeff Tarango, Jeff Cathrall, Barry
Richards and Eric Peus, Stanford
is loaded this season with both bar
rels.
The prize freshman catches are
Wheaton and Blackman. Wheaton,
from Excelsior, Minn., is the U.S.
Junior National U.S. Open cham
pion and possesses a lethal two
handed backhand. He is ranked No.
3 nationally in the Volvo Collegiate
Tennis Series/ITCA. One of the
most talented young players in the
world, Wheaton is also ranked No.
2 in doubles with Tarango in the
same poll.

T think Stanford is the
team to beat. They
have the most horses.'

Pepperdine coach

Although currently injured with
a lacerated left wrist, Wheaton is
practicing with the team and should
return to the lineup in approxi
mately a month. "Wheaton and
Parker are unquestionably the top
two recruits in the nation," Magi 11
said.
Blackman, from Bradcnton, Fla.,
is noted for his powerful serve and
will threaten Stanford's top three
players, Wheaton, Tarango and
McEnroe. Blackman, 45th in the
preseason singles rankings, is also

an excellent doubles player and will
solidify the Cardinal doubles com
binations.
The tentative starting lineup, mi
nus Wheaton, includes Tarango No.
1, McEnroe No. 2, Blackman No.
3, Cathrall No. 4, Solomon No. 5
and Richards No. 6. In doubles,
the McEnroe-Blackman, Cathrall-
Peus and Tarango-Richards duos
have the inside track.
When Wheaton returns, he will
play from No. 1 to No. 3 in singles
and will team with either Tarango,
McEnroe or Blackman in doubles.
"There is no clear cut No. 1;
there is no clear cut No. 6," Gould
said. "We have guys not playing
that could play No. 5 or No. 6.
When you have a good team, you
have that."
In addition to the Cardinal's
depth from top to bottom, Gould
has the luxury of having three
players capable of playing No. 1.
Tarango, ranked 19th in preseason,
and McEnroe (No. 12) both played
in the top position last season, and
Wheaton should be ready to step
right in. With several solid players
not even in the starting lineup, just
being among the Cardinal's top six
will be a dogfight.
"I have three guys I have com
plete confidence in playing No. 1
(Wheaton, Tarango and McEn
roe)," Gould said. "Blackman can
beat anyone on a given day, and
Cathrall has improved immensely.
Good teams are blessed with these
decisions."
While Wheaton, Tarango and

McEnroe, in the top three slots in
some order, the bottom three pos
itions won't be filled by any pus
hovers. Blackman figures to be one
of the nation's strongest No. 4
players on a college team. Cathrall,
who has shown steady improvement
through last season and over the
summer, and Solomon should also

prove exciting to watch.
In addition, Richards, junior
Curtis Dunn, who won the NorCal
Rolex Regional National Indoor
qualifying tournament in Hayward
this fall, and Peus will challenge
for singles slots.

Senior Patrick McEnroe brings experience to a starting lineup that will
include three freshmen once David Wheaton gets healthy.
"We are strong from top to bot
tom in singles and doubles," Gould
said. "When we get David
(Wheaton) back, and if everyone
stays healthy, we should be a whale
of a team."
One noticeable improvement
over last year's squad is the condi
tion of the doubles teams. While
the singles matches set the tone in
a given match, the doubles matches
often decide the outcome.
When Wheaton returns, Cathrall-
Peus will play third doubles. Al
though the top two combinations
have not yet been decided,
Wheaton, Tarango, McEnroe and
Blackman are all gifted doubles
performers and will undoubtedly
team to form potent doubles duos.
"Last year we weren't strong in
doubles," McEnroe said. "With
Wheaton and Martin Blackman we
are really strong in doubles this
year. I think our doubles teams
could be the key."
After a disappointing season last
year, Gould has developed another
Stanford team capable of winning
it all. As in the 1983 championship
season, Gould has reloaded with
an exceptional freshman recruiting
class. Blended with veterans
McEnroe, Tarango and Cathrall,
the freshmen could help duplicate
the Cardinal's 1983 turnaround and
bring Stanford its ninth NCAA
crown.
