# Sailing has no trouble in paradise

Stanford sailors usually head east
when they leave for major regattas,
but last Thursday four members of
the Stanford sailing team instead
headed west to Honolulu to attend
the University of Hawaii Invita
tional Regattas, where they won 17
of the 22 races held during the two
one-day events.
While other Stanford students
endured a major rainstorm in Cal
ifornia, senior Tom Kuhle and
junior Rita Snape sailed under
sunny skies to back-to-back wins in
A Division, and seniors Dan Buck
staff and Kathleen Mallery put the
balmy breezes to good use while
twice winning B-Division.
In the first of the two regattas,
the winning Stanford foursome was
followed by Hawaii, California and
San Francisco State. In the second
regatta, San Francisco State took
second place, Hawaii took third and
California took fourth.
Though the Stanford sailors
brought home deeper tans along
with their victories, each paid a
heavy price for the brief vacation.
As a Varsity II sport, the Stanford
sailing team is completely self
funded. That meant that the four
sailors and Coach Blake Middleton
had to pay their own way to and
from the Hawaii regatta.
Even so, the four all spoke highly
of the regatta, which was sailed off
Waikiki in large swells and a stiff
Hawaiian trade wind that ranged

between eight and 15 knots.
"It's definitely an experience no
sailor should pass up if they get
the opportunity. The competition
was good, and the weather was even
better. You just don't get to sail in
those kinds of conditions in Red
wood City," Kuhnle said.
"When we planned for the trip,

it seemed like something of a va
cation, but once we were there it
was like any other regatta. We were
out to win, and we put everything
we had into every race. That's the
way we always sail," Mallery said.
The regatta in Hawaii was the
second of this new year for the
Cardinal, and dozens more lie

ahead before the national champi
onship in the spring. In February,
competition begins in a Northern
California Regatta Series that will
eventually determine which team
from the local region will head to
the Collegiate Sailing National
Championship, which will be held
in Richmond this year.
