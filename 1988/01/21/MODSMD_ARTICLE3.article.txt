# Hospital blamed for AIDS death

A lawsuit filed against Stanford
University Hospital Tuesday claims
doctors used blood tainted with the
AIDS virus while operating on a
San Carlos man, who later died of
the disease.
Robert Fox, an attorney and
brother of the deceased, filed suit
for punitive damages on behalf of
the man's widow and her children
in Santa Clara County Superior
Court.
The patient in the case, Stanley
Fox, received the contaminated
blood during a June 1983 heart
bypass operation. He died last Jan
uary at age 67.
"The medical world was aware
of the fact that AIDS probably was
spread by blood . . . but the (Stan
ford doctors) did not bother to tell
Stanley that if he had waited four
weeks he could have had the donor
blood tested," Robert Fox told the
San Jose Mercury News.
Fox also said his brother's surgery
was not urgent and could have
waited until Stanford began its
screening. The screening process

was instituted four weeks later.
But hospital officials maintain the
screening test was not perfected
even then. According to Spyros An
dreopoulos, director of Communi
cations for the Medical Center,
there was a possibility that con
taminated blood could remain un
detected because the H virus —
which carries AIDS — had not yet
been discovered.
Stanford's test, Andreopoulos
said, simply eliminated blood
donated by members of high-risk
groups.
Andreopoulos said Stanford was
"in the forefront" of such screening
research and decided to proceed
with its plan despite skepticism on
the part of blood banks that deemed
the procedure unnecessary.
Fox told the Mercury News that
Stanford withheld the information
about the screening in order to
protect itself from a "virtual shut
down of the operating facilities for
all types of surgery."
Thomas Fenner, vice president
of General Counsel for the Univer
sity, declined to discuss the details
of the suit, and said he was unsure
whether it had reached the courts.
He added, however, that it is "our
opinion that Stanford is not liable,
and we will be presenting on that
matter in court."
Law Prof. Marc Franklin said
California has a statute stating the
plaintiff must prove the negligence
of the hospital in order to win this
kind of case.
