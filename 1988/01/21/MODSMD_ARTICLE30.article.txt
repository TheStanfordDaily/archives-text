With all of the feathers she
has accumulated, Nancy Reno
needs a bigger cap.
This weekend in Stockton at
the first-ever East-West Col
legiate Volleyball All-Star Clas
sic, the Stanford senior middle
blocker capped a sterling col
legiate career by leading the
West team to a five-game victory
over the East, earning West
Most Valuable Player honors
over players like Stanford team
mate Wendi Rush and Hawaii's
Suzanne Eagye, the Pacific Coast
Athletic Association's Player of
the Year.
Reno enjoyed the most suc
cessful season of her collegiate
career in 1987, earning First
Team All-America and All-
Pacific 10 Conference Team
honors. The biology major was
also named to the All-Pac-10 Ac
ademic Team.
The 1987 Pac-10 Player of the
Year, Stanford setter Rush, also
turned in a fine performance for
the West, coming in for Pacific's
setter and high school teammate
Liz Hert to spark the squad to
victories in games one, two and
five with serving deadly enough
to place her in the finals of the

serving accuracy contest held at
halftime.
But the night belonged to
Reno. Her trademark loop play
was as devastating as it was all
season long, even against the su
perior blocking of Kramer and
her East All-Star teammates that
shut down many of the West's
best hitters, and whenever Rush
came into the game the pair
rekindled the magic that led the
Cardinal to the final four every
year of their carcers.
