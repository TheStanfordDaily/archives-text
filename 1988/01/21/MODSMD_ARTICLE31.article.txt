# Visiting Reagan official:
## INF treaty makes 'safer, saner world' 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
The Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces (INF) Treaty between the
United States and the Soviet Union
and the Strategic Defense Initiative
will increase world security, a
Reagan administration official said
here last night.
Allen Holmes, assistant secretary
of state for politico-military affairs,
told a group of about 50 arms con
trol experts in Tresiddcr that the
significance of the INF treaty "is
that it moves us in the direction of
a more stable world" and that using
SDI technology will lead to a "safer
and saner world."
Although the Soviet Union is cau
tious of the U.S. proposal to build

a space-based nuclear weapons
defense system, Holmes said, talks
at last month's superpower summit
increase the chances that the
United States will conduct SDI re
search more openly.
The proposal to share research
includes an exchange of data, open
laboratories and observation of tests
in the development of SDI. Holmes
said this idea is "still on the table,"
but "provides the basis for some
important new steps which could
be agreed upon to enhance inter
national security."
Holmes also said the INF treaty,
which includes asymmetric reduc
tions in nuclear and conventional
forces to equal levels by NATO and
the Warsaw Pact nations, on-site
inspection of arms levels, and global

limits on arms increases, is "in the
security interests of the United
States and our allies."
The INF treaty, he said, forces
the Soviets to eliminate several
classes of intermediate and short
range missiles with four times the
firepower of the missiles the United
States has agreed to destroy.
These arms cuts are consistent
with the Reagan administration's
plan to "rcduce military threats and
political intimidation to U.S. and
allied interests and forces," Holmes
said.
In addition, he said, a successful
INF treaty will be a political victory
for NATO. It will demonstrate to
the Soviet Union that NATO "has
the political will and cohesion to
carry out touch decisions to ensure

its own security," he said.
Holmes spoke here as part of a
three-day "Arms Control and Na
tional Security" conference spon
sored by the Executive Council on
Foreign Diplomats, a non-profit or
ganization of senior U.S. govern
ment and business officials respon
sible for briefing foreign diplomats
stationed in the United States and
introducing them to the various
regions of this country.
The colloquium, also sponsored
here by the Center for International
Security and Arms Control and the
Center for Research in Interna
tional Studies, two University
affiliated groups, includes speeches
and seminars by foreign ambas
sadors, top U.S. officials, business
leaders and University professors.
