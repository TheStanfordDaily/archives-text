# Asbestos discovered in dean's Row house

Asbestos has caused Assoc.
Dean for Student Affairs Norm
Robinson to live in his guest
room while workers remove the
hazardous substance from the
basement below his apartment
in a University-owned house on
the Row.
Robinson first suspected a
problem when he returned after
winter break to find his apart
ment hot and humid with the
floorboards in his bedroom
"sticking up."
Workers have already begun
to remove the asbestos, which
was found to originate in the
steam pipes in the basement of
Gardiner House, at 624 Mayfield
Ave, next to Durand House. A
handful of students and Univer
sity administrators live in Gar
diner.
Robinson and Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Joe I'isano, who
also lives in the house, originally
thought they would be forced to
leave their apartments while the

asbestos was removed. But tests
revealed that the asbestos levels
are not dangerous.
The heat in the apartment has
been turned off, and Robinson
is living in his guest room until
the repairs are completed some
time next week. Pisano will not
have to leave his room.
According to Director of
Housing and Food Service Keith
Guy, other Stanford Row houses
were built around 1928, the con
struction date of Gardiner
House. However, Guy said he
does not foresee any special ac
tion being taken as a result of
the discovery at Gardiner.
A survey of asbestos levels in
some Row Houses was taken in
June 1986, and monitoring of the
houses continues.
Row houses not included in
the 1986 survey have not been
checked for dangerous asbestos.
The asbestos levels in Row
houses will only be checked if a
resident or maintenance worker
feels there is a problem, Guy
said.
