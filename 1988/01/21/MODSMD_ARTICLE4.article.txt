# Quad offices targeted
## Rash of computer thefts suggests pro job 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
An increase in personal computer
theft at Stanford — underscored by a
recent rash of robberies over winter
break — may indicate that a professional
ring of thieves is at work on campus,
according to the Stanford Police De
partment.
There have been about seven thefts
since Jan. 1, including three or four
thefts over winter break that were not
reported until this quarter, Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said. In the past year, thieves
have stolen 40 computers and made at

least nine other attempts to break into
University buildings and steal computer
equipment.
But Niemeyer said officials have no
clear leads in the case. "Unfortunately,
right now we have zero information. . . .
No clues have turned up," Niemeyer
said.
Most of the computers were stolen
from offices around the Quad, but some
students have also reported thefts,
Niemeyer said. The most common com
puters stolen are the tabletop versions
of IBMs and Apples, which are easily
carried away in bags or boxes.

Niemeyer said he is "fairly certain"
the thief or thieves is professional. He
added that he does not discount the
possibly that there may be a network of
vandals.
He said the thieves are more sophis
ticated than those who engineered the
rash of car stereo thefts last year. Those
thefts were probably drug-related, while
these thefts are "for the money,"
Niemeyer said.
"If computers were being unloaded in
our area, we would know about it,"he
said. "However, nothing has turned up
so far, which means that the computers
are being moved."

Niemeyer said such movement of
stolen property is a sign of a sophisti
cated ring, since "a good professional
thief will always move the booty out of
the area."
Another obstacle in solving the crime,
he said, is the abundance of computers
at Stanford. Some University officials
estimate that there are about 12,000
personal computers on campus, and the
Bookstore sells 500 to 600 of the mac
hines per month.
Niemeyer said any students who think
they have information regarding the
thefts should contact the Stanford Police
Department.
