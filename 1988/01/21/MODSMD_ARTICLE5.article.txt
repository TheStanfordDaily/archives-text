# IFC clarifies alcohol guidelines
## 
### Sean Kinch Staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council released
plans yesterday intended to mitigate the
dangers of alcohol use in fraternities by
making the IFC party guidelines more
clear and by instituting an educational
program in coordination with Cowcll Stu
dent Health Center.
The party planning guidelines now in
effect are ignored by fraternities because
they are too long and complex, according
to IFC President Vinny Frost. He said
the revised edition of the guidelines, writ
ten by the IFC Alcohol Task Force, does
not add any new rules but should make
them more accessible.
Frost will present the new guidelines
for approval by the full IFC at the or
ganization's next meeting. He said he ex
pects "no opposition" to the revised
guidelines, which include no specific en
forcement mechanism.
The educational program consists of an

information packct, written under the su
pervision of Louise Miller, health promo
tion specialist at Cowcll. It describes the
perils of alcohol consumption and will be
given to each fraternity member during
visits to all fraternities by task force mem
bers.
The party guidelines include banning
straight shots of alcohol, requiring all hard
alcohol to be diluted at least 50 percent
by a non-alcoholic beverage and requiring
five members of the host fraternity to
remain sober and monitor the party, Frost
said.
Frost, who is also president of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity, said many houses,
including his own, do not comply with
the rule requiring 50 percent dilution of
hard alcohol.
But Frost said his fraternity will begin
to follow the guidelines, saying that "the
Phi Dclts will have to change our
kamikazee party."
The monitors will be responsible for
keeping guests from "becoming in

ebriatcd," Frost said, and for not allowing
those who do to drive home.
Michelle Granda, president of the
Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, said she
believes there is "no feasible way" that
fraternities could completely monitor their
parties considering the size of the func
tions, even though fraternities are "taking
more responsibility" for their guests'
safety.
By contrast, Kappa Alpha fraternity
President Charles Moody said his house
is already "looking out for guys who arc
drunk" and that there have been "several
incidents" of inebriated party-goers being
given rides home by KA members.
The new guidelines also state that hard
alcohol should not be served after mid
night, and beer and wine not after 1:30
a.m., a rule Frost acknowledged has not
been followed in the past.
He said "it may be advantageous" for
the IFC executive council to police the
curfew on the serving of alcohol, but he
added, "I don't want to be a watchdog."
