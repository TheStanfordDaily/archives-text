# Soviets preview student exchange

### Bruce LeDesma Staff writer 
A delegation of education officials from
the Soviet Union met yesterday with Stan
ford students to finalize details of a spring
student exchange between Stanford and
Soviet universities.
On the first of two days at Stanford,
the Soviet officials "seemed to like every
thing they saw," said senior Kathv Healy,
a member of the student-run Stanford
Soviet Exchange Project (SSEP), which
gave the group a tour of the campus.
Alexander Kovalev, deputy secretary
general of the Soviet Student Council,
said in a reception yesterday at Hurlburt
House that the group's purpose in visiting
was to formulate concrete details for the
upcoming exchange.
"Our main goal is to negotiate that
procedure," said Kovalev, who represents
a national Soviet organization of students
from 890 universities. Details discussed
included information on the academic

background of the American students, the
goals of the program from the U.S. per
spective and logistics of the trip itself.
Asked if the program will eventually
expand to include professors or scientists,
Kovalev replied, "Our principle position
is to decentralize student exchanges. We
leave it to individual universities to solve
these questions."
He added, however, that while the Stu
dent Council's stated objective is simply
to organize exchanges, it also fosters ex
change by advising Soviet universities to
"deepen the confidence between interna
tional students." Other delegation
members include Liudmilla Subbotina, a
representative from Novosibirsk Univer
sity, and Jonas Grigornis, deputy
headmaster of Vilnius University. A
similar Soviet group is currently touring
East Coast colleges involved in the ex
change.
Speaking through a translator, Sub
botina said the group being sent from her

university will include one of the Soviet
Union's premier physicists, two graduate
students in biology and physics and several
undergraduates. She added that the Soviet
students themselves selected the
represented fields when designing the ex
change group.
According to Subbotina, one of the fo
cal points of the exchange will be com
paring Soviet and American undergradu
ate educational programs. She said the
students plan to discuss the characteristic
shared by the two systems of a broad
education during the first two years and
specialization during the last two.
"We want to know about your practice
of organizing alternate methods of
education," she satd.
Until recently, SSEP has relied on
telegrams to communicate with the
Soviets on issues surrounding the ex
change. "Now we can sit down face to
face with them to work on the tech
nicalities," Healy said.
