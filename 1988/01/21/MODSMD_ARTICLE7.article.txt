# Daily interview:
## Officials defend safety policy, admit mistakes 
### Nick Anderson Burke Smith Senior staff writers 
William Massy, vice president of Busi
ness and Finance, and Curt Williams, di
rector of Facilities Project Management,
have been intimately involved in the seis
mic study that forced the closure of Roblc
Hall and the Lou Henry Hoover House,
as well as the current probe into University
health and safety policies.
In a wide-ranging interview with The
Daily yesterday, Massy and Williams
defended University action on the closure
of Roble and admitted shortcomings in
current safety policy. Massy also criticized
members of the public who he said want
to interfere with University decision
making.
The following are excerpts from the in
terview.
Daily: We're focusing on one particular
period. It seems facilities had a pretty
tough couple of days on Dec. 10 and Dec.
11. You received notice Dec. 11 that Roble
was seismically unsafe, and (University
President Donald) Kennedy received a let
ter Dec. 10 from Jon Moldestad (an op
erations manager in health and safety)
charging that the Department of Health
and Safety has serious problems. What
arc the long-term ramifications of this for
management? Are there going to be any
shake-ups?
Massy: With respect to the Roble matter,
there the facts are all out. We were initially
under some misapprehensions about the
construction of the building, but I think
the process worked very well. A few blips
came up on the radar screen, and it was
processed quite diligently. With respect to
the Moldestad matter, I can't predict what
will come about as the result of the SRI

report, but I can assure you we will take
it very seriously.
Daily: You use the word diligently, but
there's a perception that the University
dragged its feet on Roble. John Hughes,
assistant provost for Planning and Man
agement, admitted as much when he said
the University "could have and should
have" acted more quickly over the sum
mer.
Massy: Yes, in retrospect as you look at
the outcome, you could probably say we
could have saved a month or six weeks.
But the consultants did complicated
studies, and this wasn't the only blip on
the radar screen. You start a process
going, and you pursue at norma! speed.
To my knowledge, there was no lack of
diligence. The process accelerated as it
reached more advanced stages.
Williams: We wouldn't have been able to
have it done (before September) in any
event. At the very last, the consultants
argued that we should wait until June to
close the dorm, and we said no because
of the large number of people living there.
Daily: When will you know the final fate
of Roble?
Williams: Probably in a couple of months.
I seriously doubt that we will tear it down,
but we're looking at that option.
Daily: Turning to the Moldestad affair,
why did the University wait a month to
call the press conference, and arc you
satisfied with the University's level of can
dor in the matter?
Massy: We called the press conference
right after wc made the announce
ment, and we had already con
tracted with SRI. We don't nor
mally publicize reviews when we
start them. The employee had spe
cifically asked that his letter remain
confidential. I feel that we did be
have in a reasonable and candid
fashion, but some can second guess.
We asked him specifically before
the announcement whether we
should use his name, and he said,
"Please take it out."
Daily: Obviously you're aware that
Moldestad has since told the press
that he was told by the University
to "keep quiet."
Massy: I was surprised to hear that.
I know that we had been told by
University attorneys that he was not
under any prohibition. Perhaps
there was some confusion. (Assoc.
Vice President) Amy Blue did say
at one point in the fall that she
wished the employee wouldn't talk
to the press. I found out about that,
and we both agreed that was an
unfortunate statement to make. She
then went to the employee and
apologized.
Daily: There once was an adminis
trative council, the Panel on Health
and Safety, which was discontinued
two years ago. What docs that say
about the University's commitment
to health and safety?
Massy: Yes it was discontinued, on

its own recommendation. In
retrospect, that was a very bad idea.
Had Don Kennedy and I known
then what we know now, we never
would have permitted it. The Uni
versity does need to work harder.
Daily: Did some analogous body
arise to fill the panel's consulting
duties?
Massy: Not that 1 know of.
Daily: Could you defend the Uni
versity's commitment to health and
safety before the Moldestad letter
came to light?
Massy: One good example is that
we've put a lot of money into the
Environmental Safety Facility
(ESF). I'm wringing my hands that
the darn scrubber in its incinerator
didn't work the way the manufac
turer said it would, but we were
out there trying.
Williams: I doubt if any other col
lege has a facility as sophisticated
as ESF.
Massy: It would not be too far to
say that perhaps we tried to do too
much. We've stumbled in the proc
ess, but we will get it fixed. Second
ly, we have added a large number
of staff to the Department of Health
and Safety, at a far greater rate
than any other department. We
have invested quite heavily in
McCullough, literally millions of
dollars. Not to say that we've
achieved everything we want to.
Williams: Seismic, asbestos, fire

protection â€” all those areas have
received attention.
Daily: We've received anonymous
calls from employees in some build
ings that there have been spills that
have gone unreported that have
resulted in headache and nausea
for some employees. Wouldn't it be
appropriate for the University to
notify those affected about this sit
uation?
Massy: Oh, absolutely. I know I've
heard in the past few weeks about
alleged cases of unreported spills,
and damn it, they should be re
ported.
Daily: But why isn't the University
telling us which areas are being
examined now so that people can
be aware of the hazard?

Massy: Well, there is an established
reporting system. If there is some
thing wrong, it's got to be fixed.
There are life safety boxes in each
area affected that list hazards and
procedures. One thing we have to
do is increase consciousness to get
these things reported, but I can't
wave a wand to make everyone
report every spill.
Daily: There have been complaints
from the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment and local residents that
they're not being included in this
process. How do you intend to in
volve the public?
Massy: There is a legal requirement
that has to do with reporting. With
respect to the public's involvement,
there's no question that the public
has a stake. There arc processes,

including notifying the fire depart
ment, planning agencies, air quality
commissions, that will accomplish
that. We try to do everything we're
expected to do. Some of our critics
would like us to do more.
For example, we have a panel on
animal care that has members of
the public on it. There is a desire
among our critics to put members
of a particular group committed to
stopping animal research on that
panel. The agenda of these people
is not to regulate, but to stop. We
are trying very hard, but does it
make sense to have someone in
volved in our councils who is com
mitted to stopping us from doing
what we need to do? Aren't we
entitled to run our own processes,
with regulations as provided? Stan
ford has a certain right of privacy.

Daily: There are a great number
of employees willing to make
serious charges anonymously right
now about safety problems. What
does it say about Stanford that these
people aren't willing to point the
finger in public, for fear that they
will lose their jobs or be persecuted
by their superiors?
Massy: I don't know. I'm concerned
about that phenomenon. My vision
of Stanford is that people can stand
up and say what they think. We've
gone to considerable lengths to
safeguard their ability to do that.
That's something we're trying to
find out about now.
Daily: Is the University's reluctance
to publicize the Moldestad allega
tions contributing to people's fears?
Massy: I don't perceive that we are
being terribly "closed." We've dis
closed quite a bit. We shouldn't
publicize the latest rumor every day.
Daily: John Hughes did a report
last spring that was used in con
junction with Jon Moldestad's letter
to identify buildings to be studied
with SRI. Was there any delay in
acting upon that report, or would
it have been enough to start this
kind of response by the University?
Williams: I don't know that there
was a formal study. Last spring we
addressed some of these concerns,
but not to this extent.
Massy: There are often cases of
disagreement among University ex
perts on these kinds of issues, and
Jon has very strong opinions.
