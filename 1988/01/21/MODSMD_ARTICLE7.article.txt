# Daily interview:
## Officials defend safety policy, admit mistakes 
### Nick Anderson Burke Smith Senior staff writers 
William Massy, vice president of Busi
ness and Finance, and Curt Williams, di
rector of Facilities Project Management,
have been intimately involved in the seis
mic study that forced the closure of Roblc
Hall and the Lou Henry Hoover House,
as well as the current probe into University
health and safety policies.
In a wide-ranging interview with The
Daily yesterday, Massy and Williams
defended University action on the closure
of Roble and admitted shortcomings in
current safety policy. Massy also criticized
members of the public who he said want
to interfere with University decision
making.
The following are excerpts from the in
terview.
Daily: We're focusing on one particular
period. It seems facilities had a pretty
tough couple of days on Dec. 10 and Dec.
11. You received notice Dec. 11 that Roble
was seismically unsafe, and (University
President Donald) Kennedy received a let
ter Dec. 10 from Jon Moldestad (an op
erations manager in health and safety)
charging that the Department of Health
and Safety has serious problems. What
arc the long-term ramifications of this for
management? Are there going to be any
shake-ups?
Massy: With respect to the Roble matter,
there the facts are all out. We were initially
under some misapprehensions about the
construction of the building, but I think
the process worked very well. A few blips
came up on the radar screen, and it was
processed quite diligently. With respect to
the Moldestad matter, I can't predict what
will come about as the result of the SRI

report, but I can assure you we will take
it very seriously.
Daily: You use the word diligently, but
there's a perception that the University
dragged its feet on Roble. John Hughes,
assistant provost for Planning and Man
agement, admitted as much when he said
the University "could have and should
have" acted more quickly over the sum
mer.
Massy: Yes, in retrospect as you look at
the outcome, you could probably say we
could have saved a month or six weeks.
But the consultants did complicated
studies, and this wasn't the only blip on
the radar screen. You start a process
going, and you pursue at norma! speed.
To my knowledge, there was no lack of
diligence. The process accelerated as it
reached more advanced stages.
Williams: We wouldn't have been able to
have it done (before September) in any
event. At the very last, the consultants
argued that we should wait until June to
close the dorm, and we said no because
of the large number of people living there.
Daily: When will you know the final fate
of Roble?
Williams: Probably in a couple of months.
I seriously doubt that we will tear it down,
but we're looking at that option.
Daily: Turning to the Moldestad affair,
why did the University wait a month to
call the press conference, and arc you
satisfied with the University's level of can
dor in the matter?
Massy: We called the press conference
