Dow Jones falls 57.20 points
NEW YORK — New anxieties about the profits of high-technology
companies upended the stock market yesterday, dumping the Dow
Jones industrial average 57.20 points to its lowest level in more
than a month.
Already uneasy from other high-tech earnings reports, investors
fled many issues in early afternoon on news that Motorola Corp.
earnings were below Wall Street's expectations. The slide was
hastened by an avalanche of program trading, which shaved 40
points from the Dow in half an hour.
The index ended the day at 1879.14, its lowest level since Dec.
11, when it stood at 1867.04. Broader market indexes were also
down sharply, and volume was a moderate 181.66 million shares,
compared to 153.55 million on Tuesday.
The strength of the entire economy has been called into question
in the past week by the disappointing quarterly earnings posted by
such important high-tech concerns as International Business Mac
hines, Digital Equipment, Tandem Computers and, now, Motorola.
Many of these reported higher profits, but analysts expected even
better numbers, reasoning that the companies benefit from the
evident strength of the domestic economy as well as export sales
that have been stimulated by a weak dollar.
But the lower-than-expected figures have led many to wonder
how much bounce there is in the U.S. economy. "The high-tech
sector had been the great hope for the market for weeks, with
everybody hoping that they would lead a recovery," said Charles
Eaton, a vice president at Nikko Securities in New York. "Now
that's all coming apart."
Still, some analysts contended that the high-tech concerns' results
have been far too strong to merit such a selloff. "You can't put a
finger on one fundamental reason why the stocks of these companies
continue to take hits," said Edward Biederman, technical analyst
at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco.
Hart denies campaign finance error
WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart,
responding to a report that his campaign received questionable
contributions from a California film producer, yesterday denied any
knowledge of financial improprieties but said he will hold himself
"responsible for whatever happened."
The former Colorado senator was responding to a report in the
Miami Herald that producer Stuart Karl may have violated campaign
finance laws by advancing more than $96,000 to Hart in the closing
days of Hart's 1984 presidential bid and by putting on his own
payroll a Hart aide in 1986.
Federal law limits to $1000 the amount that an individual can
contribute to a presidential campaign. A person or his company
can lend money to a campaign, but only if does so in "the normal
course of business" and the company reasonably expects repayment.
Hart's campaign settled the debt last year for $9600, but the Federal
Election Commission has not yet approved it.
Election laws also prohibit companies from providing employee
services to a campaign. However, at the time the aide worked for
Karl, Hart was not yet registered as a candidate, leaving unclear
whether the rule would apply. Also, the staff member said yesterday
he only worked for Hart in his spare time.
The cases mark the second time that questions have been raised
about the relationship between Hart and persons who aided his
1984 campaign. Last spring, the Los Angeles Times reported that
officials were probing whether a Virginia media concern owned by
a leading Hart supporter had violated campaign laws by advancing
Hart nearly $900,000 in credit to buy advertising in 1984. That
'investigatipn is ppntinuing.
Hart's campaign reported its debt to Karl in its required filings
to the FEC on its finances. It said the loan was for was for video
• production, but the Herald reported that at least a portion of the
money, $15,802, was used to buy goods and services Hart needed
for the 1984 Democratic convention, including 800 foam-rubber
flying disks emblazoned with a Hart logo.
Reagan assesses East-West relations
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, making a sometimes stern
assessment of U.S. security strategy as he begins his final year in
office, said yesterday that the Soviet Union remains "the most
significant threat" to American interests despite Kremlin leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's reform programs and the warm afterglow of
last month's Washington summit.
"We must not delude ourselves into believing that the Soviet
threat has yet been fundamentally altered, or that our vigilance
can be reduced," Reagan said in his second annual report to
Congress on national security strategy.
"In the Soviet Union we hear talk of 'new thinking' and basic
changes in Soviet policies at home and abroad," Reagan said. "We
will welcome real changes, but we have yet to see any slackening
of the growth of Soviet military power, or abandonment of expan
sionist aspirations.
He said Washington "will continue to judge the Soviets by their
actions rather than their words."
The report, required each year under a 1986 law, was written
in the first person although a senior administration official said
that it was the work of hundreds of officials at the State Department,
Department of Defense , CIA and other agencies. It contained no
new initiatives for Reagan's last year, concentrating instead on a
review of U.S. interests and the long-term strategies needed to
protect them.
Govt, opponent detained in Haiti
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — A leading opponent of Haiti's
Army-led government was detained at Port-au-Prince airport and
taken to the national penitentiary yesterday as he returned from
abroad for a protest of Sunday's widely disputed, government-run
presidential election.
Airport security police seized Louis Dejoie II, a former presi
dential candidate who had been on a Caribbean-U.S. speaking tour.
Dejoie's agenda on his travels was to explain why he and three
other ex-contenders had called for a boycott of the government
staged election. A large majority of Haitian voters heeded the call
and boycotted the voting, which was marked by irregularities.
Dejoie, 57, was held for more than four hours at the international
airport after arriving on a flight from Puerto Rico, where he has
business interests. He had planned to join the other three boycotting
ex-candidates in a press conference today to denounce what they
have called the "farce" and "masquerade" of an election staged by
the provisional government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
Journalists who followed a white police pickup truck that took
Dejoie away from the airport under guard said that he was taken
directly to the national penitentiary in Port-au-Prince.
There was no indication from the government whether he had
been charged, as required by Haitian law, or how long he would
be held. A government spokeswoman said that security police had
informed her only that Dejoie was being held for questioning.
The former presidential aspirant was known to have angered
Namphy's ruling group over remarks he has made during the past
three weeks in Washington, Miami and Barbados urging a total
international economic boycott of Haiti.

of the growth of Soviet military power, or abandonment of expan
sionist aspirations.
He said Washington "will continue to judge the Soviets by their
actions rather than their words."
The report, required each year under a 1986 law, was written
in the first person although a senior administration official said
that it was the work of hundreds of officials at the State Department,
Department of Defense , CIA and other agencies. It contained no
new initiatives for Reagan's last year, concentrating instead on a
review of U.S. interests and the long-term strategies needed to
protect them.
Govt, opponent detained in Haiti
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — A leading opponent of Haiti's
Army-led government was detained at Port-au-Prince airport and
taken to the national penitentiary yesterday as he returned from
abroad for a protest of Sunday's widely disputed, government-run
presidential election.
Airport security police seized Louis Dejoie II, a former presi
dential candidate who had been on a Caribbean-U.S. speaking tour.
Dejoie's agenda on his travels was to explain why he and three
other ex-contenders had called for a boycott of the government
staged election. A large majority of Haitian voters heeded the call
and boycotted the voting, which was marked by irregularities.
Dejoie, 57, was held for more than four hours at the international
airport after arriving on a flight from Puerto Rico, where he has
business interests. He had planned to join the other three boycotting
ex-candidates in a press conference today to denounce what they
have called the "farce" and "masquerade" of an election staged by
the provisional government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
Journalists who followed a white police pickup truck that took
Dejoie away from the airport under guard said that he was taken
directly to the national penitentiary in Port-au-Prince.
There was no indication from the government whether he had
been charged, as required by Haitian law, or how long he would
be held. A government spokeswoman said that security police had
informed her only that Dejoie was being held for questioning.
The former presidential aspirant was known to have angered
Namphy's ruling group over remarks he has made during the past
three weeks in Washington, Miami and Barbados urging a total
international economic boycott of Haiti.

Dow Jones falls 57.20 points
NEW YORK — New anxieties about the profits of high-technology
companies upended the stock market yesterday, dumping the Dow
Jones industrial average 57.20 points to its lowest level in more
than a month.
Already uneasy from other high-tech earnings reports, investors
fled many issues in early afternoon on news that Motorola Corp.
earnings were below Wall Street's expectations. The slide was
hastened by an avalanche of program trading, which shaved 40
points from the Dow in half an hour.
The index ended the day at 1879.14, its lowest level since Dec.
11, when it stood at 1867.04. Broader market indexes were also
down sharply, and volume was a moderate 181.66 million shares,
compared to 153.55 million on Tuesday.
The strength of the entire economy has been called into question
in the past week by the disappointing quarterly earnings posted by
such important high-tech concerns as International Business Mac
hines, Digital Equipment, Tandem Computers and, now, Motorola.
Many of these reported higher profits, but analysts expected even
better numbers, reasoning that the companies benefit from the
evident strength of the domestic economy as well as export sales
that have been stimulated by a weak dollar.
But the lower-than-expected figures have led many to wonder
how much bounce there is in the U.S. economy. "The high-tech
sector had been the great hope for the market for weeks, with
everybody hoping that they would lead a recovery," said Charles
Eaton, a vice president at Nikko Securities in New York. "Now
that's all coming apart."
Still, some analysts contended that the high-tech concerns' results
have been far too strong to merit such a selloff. "You can't put a
finger on one fundamental reason why the stocks of these companies
continue to take hits," said Edward Biederman, technical analyst
at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco.
Hart denies campaign finance error
WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart,
responding to a report that his campaign received questionable
contributions from a California film producer, yesterday denied any
knowledge of financial improprieties but said he will hold himself
"responsible for whatever happened."
The former Colorado senator was responding to a report in the
Miami Herald that producer Stuart Karl may have violated campaign
finance laws by advancing more than $96,000 to Hart in the closing
days of Hart's 1984 presidential bid and by putting on his own
payroll a Hart aide in 1986.
Federal law limits to $1000 the amount that an individual can
contribute to a presidential campaign. A person or his company
can lend money to a campaign, but only if does so in "the normal
course of business" and the company reasonably expects repayment.
Hart's campaign settled the debt last year for $9600, but the Federal
Election Commission has not yet approved it.
Election laws also prohibit companies from providing employee
services to a campaign. However, at the time the aide worked for
Karl, Hart was not yet registered as a candidate, leaving unclear
whether the rule would apply. Also, the staff member said yesterday
he only worked for Hart in his spare time.
The cases mark the second time that questions have been raised
about the relationship between Hart and persons who aided his
1984 campaign. Last spring, the Los Angeles Times reported that
officials were probing whether a Virginia media concern owned by
a leading Hart supporter had violated campaign laws by advancing
Hart nearly $900,000 in credit to buy advertising in 1984. That
'investigatipn is ppntinuing.
Hart's campaign reported its debt to Karl in its required filings
to the FEC on its finances. It said the loan was for was for video
• production, but the Herald reported that at least a portion of the
money, $15,802, was used to buy goods and services Hart needed
for the 1984 Democratic convention, including 800 foam-rubber
flying disks emblazoned with a Hart logo.
Reagan assesses East-West relations
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, making a sometimes stern
assessment of U.S. security strategy as he begins his final year in
office, said yesterday that the Soviet Union remains "the most
significant threat" to American interests despite Kremlin leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's reform programs and the warm afterglow of
last month's Washington summit.
"We must not delude ourselves into believing that the Soviet
threat has yet been fundamentally altered, or that our vigilance
can be reduced," Reagan said in his second annual report to
Congress on national security strategy.
"In the Soviet Union we hear talk of 'new thinking' and basic
changes in Soviet policies at home and abroad," Reagan said. "We
will welcome real changes, but we have yet to see any slackening
of the growth of Soviet military power, or abandonment of expan
sionist aspirations.
He said Washington "will continue to judge the Soviets by their
actions rather than their words."
