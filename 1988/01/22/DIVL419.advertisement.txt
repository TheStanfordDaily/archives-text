Hypercholesterolemia is a
condition in which too much
cholesterol, a fatty wax-like

the blood. Cholesterol is
manufactured by the bodv,
and comes from animal
substances, such as meat,
egg yolks and whole milk
dairy products. When the
amount of cholesterol
becomes excessive, it is
deposited ;>n or in the lining
of the arteries with other fatty
substances. Over a period of
years, the lining of the
arteries becomes thicker and
harder, and the channel
through which the blood
flows is narrowed. When an
artery which supplies the
heart with oxygenated blood
closes off. a heart attack
results.
