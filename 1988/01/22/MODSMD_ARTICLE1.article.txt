Debate over the future of the
University's Western Culture re
quirement came to a head yesterday
as the Faculty Senate opened dis
cussion of this divisive issue that
has split faculty opinion and drawn
national attention.
Most senators who spoke during
yesterday's session agreed that
greater representation of women
and minorities is necessary in the
Area One requirement. It is the
question of how to achieve this —
by modifying the requirement or by
changing it altogether — that is
emerging as the critical issue in the
senate debate.
The main proposal now under
consideration, submitted to the sen
ate by the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (CUS), is a
modified version of a report
prepared by the Western Culture
Task Force. The proposal would
change the requirement itself by
abandoning the current core
reading list and renaming the pro
gram "Culture, Ideas and Values."
But a recently introduced alter
native proposal takes a different
approach. Instead of changing the
requirement, the counterproposal

seeks to modify the current program
by adding works to the existing core
list. The focus of the ensuing debate
has thus centered on which ap
proach — specifically, whether to
retain or to abolish the core list —
the faculty should adopt in
redesigning the Western Culture,
or Area One, requirement.
The debate will continue at the
senate's next meeting, on Feb. 4.
The senate will vote on any pro
posed changes at its Feb. 18
meeting at the earliest.
Despite sharp disagreement
among faculty members over the
contrasting approaches to changing
the requirement, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy emphasized
to the senate that "these positions
are not polar extremes of educa
tional philosophy, but different
points along a continuum of a fun
damental consensus."
"It is wrong to characterize one
view as conservative or racist," Ken
nedy said. "It is equally wrong to
label the other as permissive or
lacking the courage of conviction."
CUS Chair Craig Heller opened
the debate by arguing for passage
of the task force recommendations.
"We live in a changing world,
and the student population of our
university is changing not only in

demographic statistics, but in intel
lectual and professional aspirations
and needs," he said. "As a univer
sity, we cannot be satisfied with
accommodating only the interests
of the majority."
Focusing his attention on the
core list, Heller noted that several
faculty members have found the list
overlv restrictive. "To maintain a
