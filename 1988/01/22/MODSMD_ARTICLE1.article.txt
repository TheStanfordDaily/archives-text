# Factions clash as faculty debates W. Culture

### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
Debate over the future of the
University's Western Culture re
quirement came to a head yesterday
as the Faculty Senate opened dis
cussion of this divisive issue that
has split faculty opinion and drawn
national attention.
Most senators who spoke during
yesterday's session agreed that
greater representation of women
and minorities is necessary in the
Area One requirement. It is the
question of how to achieve this —
by modifying the requirement or by
changing it altogether — that is
emerging as the critical issue in the
senate debate.
The main proposal now under
consideration, submitted to the sen
ate by the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (CUS), is a
modified version of a report
prepared by the Western Culture
Task Force. The proposal would
change the requirement itself by
abandoning the current core
reading list and renaming the pro
gram "Culture, Ideas and Values."
But a recently introduced alter
native proposal takes a different
approach. Instead of changing the
requirement, the counterproposal

seeks to modify the current program
by adding works to the existing core
list. The focus of the ensuing debate
has thus centered on which ap
proach — specifically, whether to
retain or to abolish the core list —
the faculty should adopt in
redesigning the Western Culture,
or Area One, requirement.
The debate will continue at the
senate's next meeting, on Feb. 4.
The senate will vote on any pro
posed changes at its Feb. 18
meeting at the earliest.
Despite sharp disagreement
among faculty members over the
contrasting approaches to changing
the requirement, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy emphasized
to the senate that "these positions
are not polar extremes of educa
tional philosophy, but different
points along a continuum of a fun
damental consensus."
"It is wrong to characterize one
view as conservative or racist," Ken
nedy said. "It is equally wrong to
label the other as permissive or
lacking the courage of conviction."
CUS Chair Craig Heller opened
the debate by arguing for passage
of the task force recommendations.
"We live in a changing world,
and the student population of our
university is changing not only in

demographic statistics, but in intel
lectual and professional aspirations
and needs," he said. "As a univer
sity, we cannot be satisfied with
accommodating only the interests
of the majority."
Focusing his attention on the
core list, Heller noted that several
faculty members have found the list
overlv restrictive. "To maintain a


William Chace
core list at this time would decrease
the flexibility essential to foster cre
ative changes in Area One," he said.
Heller said another problem with
the core list has been "a certain
political symbolism" that students
and faculty have attributed to it.
"It has come to be identified with
the perceived male-dominated,
Eurocentric orientation of the
Western Culture program," he said.
Philosophy Prof. John Perry, a
member of the task force, also
criticized the retention of a core
list within the Area One require
ment, saying the list has deviated
from its original intent as "a flexible
instrument" and instead has be
come a "rigid nightmare."
"It's perceived by others as Stan
ford's canon of readings," Perry
said. "It's a harmful perception
that's distorting and has alienated
faculty."
Perry said the 1978 Pilot Program
Committee that helped to establish
the current Western Culture pro
gram wanted to ensure a common
intellectual experience for students.
But he added that "this can be
achieved by other means and does
not justify the costs of the core list."
But English Prof. Robert Pol
hemus defended the core list. "The
course is much more than a core
list, but the core list is the re
quirement," he said.

"If there is not a basic core ...
why should such a course be a Uni
versity requirement for everyone,
as opposed to a discipline or
departmental requirement?" Pol
hemus asked. "The core can and
should be reformed and monitored
from time to time, and it keeps
reminding faculty and students that
they are indeed engaged in some
kind of a common intellectual ex
perience."
History Prof. Paul Robinson,
chair of the Western Culture Pro
gram Committee, also referred to
the alienating effect that the core
list has — specifically on younger
faculty members — because it dic
tates to faculty "what a course
should look like."
"The reasons the younger faculty
feel alienated will not be remedied
by a new list or additions or sub
stitutions to the list," he said. "The
notion of a list is what they find
objectionable. It will always provide
a series of roadblocks."
Robinson cautioned that if the
senate fails to adopt the task force
proposal, Western Culture could
become "an aging course" because
younger faculty will not want to
teach it.
"I have not the slightest fear that
my senior colleagues who have
taught these past eight years are
going to stop teaching their courses,
so I'm worried more of the conse
quences of failing to adopt the pro
posal, rather than the consequences
of adopting it," Robinson said.

Senate Vice Chair Marsh McCall,
who chaired the CUS last year,
spoke out strongly against the task
force proposal, pointing to what he
sees as "profound paradoxes" in the
plan.
"In terms of existing Western
Culture tracks, the simple fact is
that virtually every one of them
would not have to change at all in
order to qualify for inclusion (in
the task force plan)," McCall said.
"The senate has to ask what the
point is if [the proposal] charges
the current program with serious
shortcomings, but in actual legisla
tion compels no change."
McCall, a classics professor, said
another paradox of the proposal is
that it would allow for the existing
tracks to remain while new tracks
are added. "Whom are these new
tracks for?" he asked. "Does the
proposed legislation mean that the
current tracks are educationally
legitimate for the large majority of
Stanford students ... but not for
those students who by one process
or another become critical of the
Western Culture program?"
Assoc. History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee, former dean of Undergrad
uate Studies, closed yesterday's
debate by defending the task force
proposal.
"The proposal before the senate
is less of a departure from the
original intent [of the 1978 task
force that originated the current
Western Culture requirement] than
from the current program," she

said. The original vision of Western
Culture was "shrunken" by the core
list, Lougee said. She added that
simply expanding the list would not
remedy the problem.
"Simple amendation or
patchwork to the current program
would result in students not taking
these additives seriously," she said.
Because so much of yesterday's
debate focused on the issue of a
core list, Kennedy suggested the
senate should hear "testimony from
the trenches, especially from those
who teach the courses and from
freshmen in their natural habitats."
Senior Stacey Leyton, one of
three ASSU representatives on the
CUS, said she was dismayed at the
slow speed of the debate. "I'm
frustrated at the delaying of the
decision for so long," she said. "The
faculty needs to be committed to
resolving this in a more timely mat
ter."
Former Black Student Union
Chair Steve Phillips praised the po
litical process related to the debate
but questioned the makeup of the
decision-making bodies. "I'm basi
cally encouraged that the Univer
sity's processes have brought our
notion of education into the main
stream, but I'm a little concerned
about the lack of people of color
on the senate," he said.
Phillips added he didn't think the
alternative proposal to keep the
core list would stand in the way of
approval of the task force recom
mendations.

consideration, submitted to the sen
ate by the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (CUS), is a
modified version of a report
prepared by the Western Culture
Task Force. The proposal would
change the requirement itself by
abandoning the current core
reading list and renaming the pro
gram "Culture, Ideas and Values."
But a recently introduced alter
native proposal takes a different
approach. Instead of changing the
requirement, the counterproposal

seeks to modify the current program
by adding works to the existing core
list. The focus of the ensuing debate
has thus centered on which ap
proach — specifically, whether to
retain or to abolish the core list —
the faculty should adopt in
redesigning the Western Culture,
or Area One, requirement.
The debate will continue at the
senate's next meeting, on Feb. 4.
The senate will vote on any pro
posed changes at its Feb. 18
meeting at the earliest.
Despite sharp disagreement
among faculty members over the
contrasting approaches to changing
the requirement, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy emphasized
to the senate that "these positions
are not polar extremes of educa
tional philosophy, but different
points along a continuum of a fun
damental consensus."
"It is wrong to characterize one
view as conservative or racist," Ken
nedy said. "It is equally wrong to
label the other as permissive or
lacking the courage of conviction."
CUS Chair Craig Heller opened
the debate by arguing for passage
of the task force recommendations.
"We live in a changing world,
and the student population of our
university is changing not only in

demographic statistics, but in intel
lectual and professional aspirations
and needs," he said. "As a univer
sity, we cannot be satisfied with
accommodating only the interests
of the majority."
Focusing his attention on the
core list, Heller noted that several
faculty members have found the list
overlv restrictive. "To maintain a


William Chace
core list at this time would decrease
the flexibility essential to foster cre
ative changes in Area One," he said.
Heller said another problem with
the core list has been "a certain
political symbolism" that students
and faculty have attributed to it.
"It has come to be identified with
the perceived male-dominated,
Eurocentric orientation of the
Western Culture program," he said.
Philosophy Prof. John Perry, a
member of the task force, also
criticized the retention of a core
list within the Area One require
ment, saying the list has deviated
from its original intent as "a flexible
instrument" and instead has be
come a "rigid nightmare."
"It's perceived by others as Stan
ford's canon of readings," Perry
said. "It's a harmful perception
that's distorting and has alienated
faculty."
Perry said the 1978 Pilot Program
Committee that helped to establish
the current Western Culture pro
gram wanted to ensure a common
intellectual experience for students.
But he added that "this can be
achieved by other means and does
not justify the costs of the core list."
But English Prof. Robert Pol
hemus defended the core list. "The
course is much more than a core
list, but the core list is the re
quirement," he said.

"If there is not a basic core ...
why should such a course be a Uni
versity requirement for everyone,
as opposed to a discipline or
departmental requirement?" Pol
hemus asked. "The core can and
should be reformed and monitored
from time to time, and it keeps
reminding faculty and students that
they are indeed engaged in some
kind of a common intellectual ex
perience."
History Prof. Paul Robinson,
chair of the Western Culture Pro
gram Committee, also referred to
the alienating effect that the core
list has — specifically on younger
faculty members — because it dic
tates to faculty "what a course
should look like."
"The reasons the younger faculty
feel alienated will not be remedied
by a new list or additions or sub
stitutions to the list," he said. "The
notion of a list is what they find
objectionable. It will always provide
a series of roadblocks."
Robinson cautioned that if the
senate fails to adopt the task force
proposal, Western Culture could
become "an aging course" because
younger faculty will not want to
teach it.
"I have not the slightest fear that
my senior colleagues who have
taught these past eight years are
going to stop teaching their courses,
so I'm worried more of the conse
quences of failing to adopt the pro
posal, rather than the consequences
of adopting it," Robinson said.

Senate Vice Chair Marsh McCall,
who chaired the CUS last year,
spoke out strongly against the task
force proposal, pointing to what he
sees as "profound paradoxes" in the
plan.
"In terms of existing Western
Culture tracks, the simple fact is
that virtually every one of them
would not have to change at all in
order to qualify for inclusion (in
the task force plan)," McCall said.
"The senate has to ask what the
point is if [the proposal] charges
the current program with serious
shortcomings, but in actual legisla
tion compels no change."
McCall, a classics professor, said
another paradox of the proposal is
that it would allow for the existing
tracks to remain while new tracks
are added. "Whom are these new
tracks for?" he asked. "Does the
proposed legislation mean that the
current tracks are educationally
legitimate for the large majority of
Stanford students ... but not for
those students who by one process
or another become critical of the
Western Culture program?"
Assoc. History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee, former dean of Undergrad
uate Studies, closed yesterday's
debate by defending the task force
proposal.
"The proposal before the senate
is less of a departure from the
original intent [of the 1978 task
force that originated the current
Western Culture requirement] than
from the current program," she

said. The original vision of Western
Culture was "shrunken" by the core
list, Lougee said. She added that
simply expanding the list would not
remedy the problem.
"Simple amendation or
patchwork to the current program
would result in students not taking
these additives seriously," she said.
Because so much of yesterday's
debate focused on the issue of a
core list, Kennedy suggested the
senate should hear "testimony from
the trenches, especially from those
who teach the courses and from
freshmen in their natural habitats."
Senior Stacey Leyton, one of
three ASSU representatives on the
CUS, said she was dismayed at the
slow speed of the debate. "I'm
frustrated at the delaying of the
decision for so long," she said. "The
faculty needs to be committed to
resolving this in a more timely mat
ter."
Former Black Student Union
Chair Steve Phillips praised the po
litical process related to the debate
but questioned the makeup of the
decision-making bodies. "I'm basi
cally encouraged that the Univer
sity's processes have brought our
notion of education into the main
stream, but I'm a little concerned
about the lack of people of color
on the senate," he said.
Phillips added he didn't think the
alternative proposal to keep the
core list would stand in the way of
approval of the task force recom
mendations.
Debate over the future of the
University's Western Culture re
quirement came to a head yesterday
as the Faculty Senate opened dis
cussion of this divisive issue that
has split faculty opinion and drawn
national attention.
Most senators who spoke during
yesterday's session agreed that
greater representation of women
and minorities is necessary in the
Area One requirement. It is the
question of how to achieve this —
by modifying the requirement or by
changing it altogether — that is
emerging as the critical issue in the
senate debate.
