# Spring break
## Students to visit Nicaragua 
### Leslie Saul 
Eighteen Stanford students will
travel to Nicaragua over spring
break as part of an educational tour
sponsored by a Palo Alto-based ed
ucational foundation.
The students will spend most of
their time in Managua, the capital
city, and may meet with government
officials, members of the political
opposition, church and health rep
resentatives and U.S. embassy of
ficials.
Group members also hope to
meet with representatives of the
Nicaraguan Ministry of Health and
Ministry of Education and La
Prensa, the nation's frequently cen
sored opposition newspaper.
Three days of the trip will be
spent on a service project involving
physical labor. The students will
also meet local families in a com
munity clinic or school.
Influenced by a group of Stanford
students who went to El Salvador
last March, students associated with
the Public Service Center proposed
making the trip to Nicaragua.
However, the Public Scrvice Center,
one of several sponsors of the El
Salvador trip, decided not to spon

sor this year's trip.
Public Scrvice Center Director
Catherine Milton, who said she is
personally enthusiastic about the
trip, explained that the center will
not sponsor the trip because its
focus is on education rather than
service. Milton said the Public Ser
vice Center also decided against
sponsoring the trip because of con
cern about the potential risk in
volved.
She added that the Public Scrvice
Center hoped to avoid controversy
similar to that surrounding last
year's El Salvador trip, which arose
when one participant charged that
the students were given a biased,
leftist view of the political situation
there.
After the Public Scrvice Center's
faculty advisory board decided
against funding the trip, student or
ganizers were directed to Synergy,
a Palo Alto non-profit organization
that promotes educational cross
cultural exchanges. Synergy selec
ted the participants from 34 appli
cants.
Students participating in the pro
gram will contribute as much as
they can toward their expenses, and
the rest of the money will be raised

through fund-raising efforts.
According to Dean of the Chapel
Robert Gregg, Memorial Church
intends to give financial support to
one student.
Magdalena Fittoria, who partici
pated in a similar program in
Nicaragua as a Stanford student in
1983 and is now a coordinator of
the Ravenswood Tutoring Program,
is working on her own time to help
plan the program. She described
the upcoming tour as an attempt
to "allow participants to get ex
posed to a wide range of
Nicaraguan experiences" and to
gain "a better understanding of the
complexity of the conflict."
Steve Babb, regional coordinator
for the Stanford Overseas Devel
opment Network, is also helping
plan the project in an unofficial,
volunteer capacity. He stressed that
"the students will be going with
open minds and with a sense of
humility and a sense of the com
plexity of the situation â€” that it's
not black and white."
Babb, a Stanford alumnus, has
traveled in Nicaragua before and
has personal contacts there.
