No one in the School of Humanities and Sciences
would disagree that the 140 students denied the
opportunity of taking a discussion section for History
172 A this quarter were denied an important part
of the educational experience.
Undergraduates need one-on-one attention and
group interaction. The atmosphere in lecture classes
can often be impersonal, the professor a distant
voice. Office hours help to create a link between
student and scholar, but it is the section that pro
vides the best forum to explore ideas presented in
class.
Likewise, no one in Graduate Studies would dis
pute that Ph.D candidates benefit from leading
these sections. Teaching experience is required by
curriculum and sensitizes tomorrow's professors to
life in the classroom.
While the shortage of TAs is not widespread,
neither is the problem in History 172 A an isolated
incident. The chronic lack of qualified TAs to lead
sections for large lectures in certain social science
classes, particularly in history, political science and
economics, has been confirmed by Tom Wasow,
dean of Undergraduate Studies and associate dean
of Humanities and Sciences.
The shortage can be traced in part to overall
trends in academia. Glutted markets in the 1970s
and early '80s have translated into smaller graduate
enrollments, and thus a smaller pool of qualified
TAs. Dean of Graduate Studies Elizabeth Traugott
maintains that graduate students are performing
the teaching required of them and that deficiencies

in undergraduate programs should be framed as a
separate issue. Admitting greater numbers of
graduates simply for the sake of TA needs, or
requiring those already here to teach more fre
quently are options generally unattractive to both
Wasow and Traugott.
What is to be done? The School of Humanities
and Sciences, which is responsible for allocating
TA funds, says that money is available but that
personnel are not. Using undergraduate TAs, as
human biology, computer science and Structured
Liberal Education have done, is not appropriate
for the humanities and social sciences because of
the nature of the work and the level of background
required. Certain departments have enlisted help
from the Law School and the Graduate School of
Business, but even this has not been enough.
Hiring post-doctorates in non-tenure track posi
tions would significantly improve the situation, es
pecially in history and political science. This alter
native is the most costly, but the greater crime is
denying the large social science departments suffi
cient instructors.
It may be true that the University has found
itself the victim of dwindling graduate enrollment,
but it is also true that undergraduates have been
made victims of inadequate resources. The School
of Humanities and Sciences has the luxury of making
long-term adjustments, but each undergraduate at
Stanford is here for only four years. The University
should take quick action, for failure to do so would
mean falling short of its educational mission.
