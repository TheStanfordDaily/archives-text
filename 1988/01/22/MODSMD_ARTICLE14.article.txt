Ineligibility for
club will cause
discrimination
While giving a fair assessment of
the discrimination inherent in all
male clubs, the writer of "The
politicking in all-male clubs" (Daily,
Jan. 12) merely scratched the sur
face. What she failed to address
was the issue of job discrimination.
Donald Kennedy has stated that
Stanford pays for part of Vice-
President for Public Affairs Robert
Freelen's dues to the Bohemian
Club. Presumably Stanford contri
butes to Freelen's dues because his
membership in the Bohemian Club
allows him to make some signifi
cantly important contacts on behalf
of the University.
If Stanford (or any university, col
lege or corporation) believes it ne
cessary to place a high-ranking of
ficial (in this case the vice-president
for public affairs) in a primarily
white all-male club, Stanford will
promote or hire only a white male
to that high-ranking position. Any
female or non-white male, being
ineligible for membership in the
Bohemian Club, for instance, is
thereby prohibited from holding the
office of vice-president for public
affairs even though he or she may

otherwise be totally qualified to do
s Â°.
Subtle job discrimination is job
discrimination nonetheless. How
docs the Stanford administration
justify this type of discrimination
given its affirmative action and
equal opportunity employer
policies?

Co-ops teach
responsiblity
The article "Co-ops convenient,
cost-effective" (Daily, Jan. 20) was
a good insight into a system which
best addresses the problem of
student-worker relations. The
Daily's earlier editorial "Overco
ming Arrogance" (Daily, Jan. 14)
had lamented the disrespect of stu
dents toward the people who clean
up their messes and cook for them.
However, their solution was simply
to alert students to this problem
and encourage them to act more
respectfully.
This solution will have very little
effect, while the article gave many
good reasons why co-ops stand as
a workable solution to this problem.
As the Daily's editorial pointed out,
students should be "cleaning up
their own messes rather than think

ing it their God-given right to have
someone clean up after them." The
only way to effectively eliminate
that elitism is to take away the cook
and the maid and allow students
to be responsible. Perhaps it's time
that housing officials realize that
giving students an easy way out
deprives them of valuable ideas and
skills developed in the educational
atmosphere of co-ops.
If it's "residential education" that
they really want, how can they deny
some students a home in which
cooperation, responsibility, and
self-determination are best ex
emplified? Leland Stanford put it
best when he said, "We have pro
vided that the benefits resulting
from cooperation shall be freely
taught. Cooperative societies bring
forth the best capacities, the best
influences of the individual for the
benefit of the whole, while the good
influences of the many aid the in
dividual." If Leland were alive
today, you could bet that he would
be at the forefront of the movement
against the Stanford housing offi
cials who have attempted to reduce
the number of co-ops instead of
increasing their number. Student
desire to be pampered must be
countered with their need to be
come responsible. Can a "first
class" university aim for any less?
