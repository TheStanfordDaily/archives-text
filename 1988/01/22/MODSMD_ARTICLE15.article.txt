## Roble move harder than people think 
### 
On Dec. 18, 1987, at 12:15 p.m. Stanford
University officially revealed to the residents of
Roble Hall that students would no longer live
in the beloved dorm after autumn quarter. Struc
turally unsound, Roble could not possibly
withstand a moderate earthquake lasting 15 to
20 seconds. Needless to say, many tears flowed
onto other people's shoulders during the next
24 hours. Upon returning to campus after the
winter break, Roble residents slowly and meth
odically packed their possessions and moved to
their new locations. The University provided
professional movers at no cost to the students
and even offered to pay for relocation of telep
hones.

The general consensus among all students was
that Roble residents were taking the move well
and that the University was doing all that it
could possibly do. However, contrary to the
predominant impression reigning through the
University, most Roble refugees have had very
rough times settling in, and the University has
not done all that it can do.
The Daily has continuously given the impres
sion that Robleites have shown a high degree
of optimism despite their predicament. This at
titude prevailed during the beginning of the
week because the refugees had other things to
worry about, such as packing. The shock of
separation from roommates and hallmates did
not occur until nearly everyone had obtained
their permanent residences.
While most freshmen seemed much happier
with their new accommodations than they had
expected to be, uppcrclassmen did not have a
thrilling choice of on-campus housing. They had
to go through a housing draw, and many feared
that they would find themselves rooming with
some heartless graduate student if a high draw

number split them from their roommates. One
Robleite calculated that she and her roommate
would have to draw within the top 10 numbers
in order to obtain a double that would keep
them together. That calculation took into ac
count all doubles available, including those that
nobody really wanted.
Many thoughts about stopping out filled
Robleites' minds, freshmen and uppcrclassmen
alike, because the pressure of drawing an un
desirable residence and the subsequent separa
tion from roommates seemed too much to bear.
Those who decided not to stop out soon found
themselves way behind in their studies after the
few days of classes because of the pressures of
moving and readjusting.
Once the boxes began arriving in the rooms,
a number of people began to feel the effects
of the separation, and they revealed this feeling
only to other Robleites. The people in the new
residences never saw this side because Roble
people demonstrated their ability to keep their
composure to try to make the best of a bad
situation in front of non-Roble people. This
fact, in addition to The Daily's articles giving
the impression that Roble residents did not
really care about having to move out, showed
that the paper, like most of the University, was
really in the dark as far as the feelings of Roble
students were concerned.
When Robleites first wandered into Tresidder,
it appeared that the University was going out
of its way to help them. As the week dragged
on, it became more and more apparent that the
University was not doing everything that it could;
it was only doing the minimum.
The University provided professional movers,
but it should do that because it would have
been ridiculous to ask students to move 30 boxes
from Roble to Branner by themselves. People
were working overtime to help students settle
into the new residences, but that too was an
obligation.
On the other side, the University has refused
to construct or to pay for lofts in some rooms

where lofts are necessary, or in cases like the
Branner RA workroom, it has not given nearly
enough money. It did not order closets until
the week of Jan. 13, more than a full week after
rooms were assigned, and it knew that these
rooms did not have closets.

. . . most Roble refugees have
had very rough times settling
in, and the University has not
done all it can do.

The University also did not move furniture
quickly enough. It promised freshmen desks and
dressers by Tuesday at the latest. On Thursday
morning, one Roble frosh called the Roble hot
line and asked for furniture and received a
response from the man in charge that none was
available. The frosh subsequently bicycled to
Roble, found eleven desks and dressers in Roble
dining hall Band caught the same person he
had talked to over the phone a few minutes
earlier in a red-faced lie.
If Roble residents cannot trust the man in
charge, whom do they trust? And how many
other lies have people at the top told Robleites?
It may appear that all is working out well for
Roble residents, that the University is doing all
that it can, and that the entire event was bringing
Stanford together, but appearances often
deceive. The Roble shutdown will have reper
cussions throughout the remainder of the year,
and maybe into next year; the crisis will continue.
However, the Stanford community seems to
have been misled because the present circum
stances are much worse than The Daily depicts
them. Instead of "continuing to show concern,"
Stanford is going to have to get the facts straight
and start to show some concern.
