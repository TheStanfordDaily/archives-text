# From tirades to tolerance
## 
### 
I have been writing a column now for two volumes.
Basically an entire school year. That's long enough
for this writer, and it's time to move on to something
different. So, then, a retirement of sorts:

This retirement doesn't bring with it a gold watch,
or even a small bonus, but it docs bring time to reflect
on the unique experience of being a columnist for
The Daily.
I remember about this time last year when I first
got the loony idea that I wanted to write for The
Daily. Like any good God-fearing, tax-paying college
student, I wanted to change the world. More specif
ically, I wanted every one of my columns to be a
religious experience. I wanted to engage my readers
— to make them laugh, cry or revolt. Anything. I
wanted controversy.
There must be some eight-syllable psychological term
for that perverse need to be read. But in any event,
by the time the 20th or so response to my Western
Culture column rolled in calling for my crucifixion,
you can just imagine how ecstatic I must have been.
I could hardly contain my glee. I had made students
take time out of their busy schedules to write a letter
to The Daily. The ultimate compliment.
I recall President Kennedy's comment — something
to the effect that "premature salvoes" were being
fired. Many others made reference to the "infla
mmatory rhetoric" and "shrill" writing. Well, you cer
tainly would have been hard-pressed to get much
shriller than I was, and I certainly fired more than
my fair share of salvoes. But I couldn't figure out why
these killjoys were so upset. After all, isn't "spirited
debate" a good thing?
Only this year have I begun to realize what they
were getting at. I have learned about the beauty of
restraint and understatement. Everyone thinks he is
right and in his own way is trying to change things

for the better.
The Iranians think they're right. So do the commu
nists and the religious fundamentalists. Closer to home,
so do the people who clamored (and continue to
clamor) against the Western Culture requirement, the
Reagan Library and racism.
This revelation came to me sometime in the middle
of summer in the form of a phone call. A girl who
introduced herself as Marlcne from Florida woke me
up from my peaceful slumber. What did she want?
She wanted to talk to me about racism at Stanford.
This student, who to this day I still do not know,
called me up long distance in the middle of the summer
to challenge my statements on racism. Wackos don't
do that sort of thing. Only a thoughtful, sensitive
person would call up some obnoxious college journalist
and say, "it sounds like you've done some thinking
about these issues, but 1 disagree. .. . "From that
moment on, the Rainbow Agendas of the world gained
my respect.
1 still believe that the Western Culture changes are
profoundly wrong. Institutional racism? Come on,
Stanford doesn't tell young black students "Nigger Go
Home!" Robert Dork should have been confirmed to
the Supreme Court. The list goes on. I continue to
hold firm to my convictions. In fact, I'm probably
more passionate about some issues than I've ever been.
But the moral of the story is that people with
opposing viewpoints are just as intelligent, just as
passionate and just as well-meaning, if not more so.
And if I can calmly, and rationally, go to.these people
(either directly or through my writing) and say, "I'm
right; here's why . .then we have a very constructive,
very civilized dialogue indeed.
Now in no way should "civilized dialogue" be con
strued here as boring or inoffensive. Boring the reader
is the highest sin for a columnist. Rather, it should
be viewed as a respect for opposing viewpoints and
an appreciation of differences, to use the jargon of
the Rainbow Agenda. A good column should be able
to involve the reader, no matter what his views.
Joseph Goebbels once said that when he heard
someone talk about "civility" he would reach for his
gun. There's a kernel of wisdom there, but not nearly
as much as I used to think. Dare I say it? I think
I've mellowed out.

Reagan Library and racism.
This revelation came to me sometime in the middle
of summer in the form of a phone call. A girl who
introduced herself as Marlcne from Florida woke me
up from my peaceful slumber. What did she want?
She wanted to talk to me about racism at Stanford.
This student, who to this day I still do not know,
called me up long distance in the middle of the summer
to challenge my statements on racism. Wackos don't
do that sort of thing. Only a thoughtful, sensitive
person would call up some obnoxious college journalist
and say, "it sounds like you've done some thinking
about these issues, but 1 disagree. .. . "From that
moment on, the Rainbow Agendas of the world gained
my respect.
1 still believe that the Western Culture changes are
profoundly wrong. Institutional racism? Come on,
Stanford doesn't tell young black students "Nigger Go
Home!" Robert Dork should have been confirmed to
the Supreme Court. The list goes on. I continue to
hold firm to my convictions. In fact, I'm probably
more passionate about some issues than I've ever been.
But the moral of the story is that people with
opposing viewpoints are just as intelligent, just as
passionate and just as well-meaning, if not more so.
And if I can calmly, and rationally, go to.these people
(either directly or through my writing) and say, "I'm
right; here's why . .then we have a very constructive,
very civilized dialogue indeed.
Now in no way should "civilized dialogue" be con
strued here as boring or inoffensive. Boring the reader
is the highest sin for a columnist. Rather, it should
be viewed as a respect for opposing viewpoints and
an appreciation of differences, to use the jargon of
the Rainbow Agenda. A good column should be able
to involve the reader, no matter what his views.
Joseph Goebbels once said that when he heard
someone talk about "civility" he would reach for his
gun. There's a kernel of wisdom there, but not nearly
as much as I used to think. Dare I say it? I think
I've mellowed out.
Scott Lyon is an undeclared sophomore. This is his last
column.
