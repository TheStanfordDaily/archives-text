Faculty Senate approval of the Western Culture
Task force proposal, once seen as inevitable, ap
pears this week to be in danger for the first time.
In an informal Daily poll last night, more than
60 percent of the senators contacted said they are
undecided about whether to vote for the task force
proposal or a counterproposal drawn up last week
by a group of humanities and social science pro
fessors. Approximately one third of faculty senate
members were interviewed.
Of the senators who said they have decided how
they will vote or said they are "leaning" in one
direction, a slight majority favored the task force
proposal, which was recommended to the senate
in November by the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS).
Because the full senate usually approves legisla
tion recommended by one of its committees, passage
of the proposal seemed in the fall to be almost
certain. Until very recently, there was little indica
tion the group might reject the advice of the CUS.
The emergence of the counterproposal last week
changed this, both because it — to a certain extent
— redefined the issues of the debate and because
it gave faculty members concerned with the task
force proposal a more palatable option than voting

for the status quo.
The task force proposal features three main
planks: the study of at least one non-European
culture, the inclusion of more works by women and
minority authors in the curriculum and the elimi
nation of the core list of readings currently required
in all eight Western Culture tracks.
Widespread support for the first two planks trans
lated into widespread campus support for the task
force's proposed legislation. Only a few voices ex
pressed firm opposition.
Last week's counterproposal, however, redefined
the terms of the public debate and changed its
focus. The counterproposal, signed by 25 professors
opposed to the task force legislation, based its
opposition on the core list.
The new group, led by Vice Provost and English
Prof. William Chace, agrees with the task force
that more emphasis should be placed on groups
and issues often left out of the Western Culture
curriculum, but insists that a core list should be
part of any Western Culture requirement. It
demands the perpetuation of the list for the sake
of a "common intellectual experience for ail Stan
ford undergraduates."
Chace's group notes, however, that the core list
should be "open to revision" and include more
