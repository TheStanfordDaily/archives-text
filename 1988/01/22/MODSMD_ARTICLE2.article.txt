Faculty Senate approval of the Western Culture
Task force proposal, once seen as inevitable, ap
pears this week to be in danger for the first time.
In an informal Daily poll last night, more than
60 percent of the senators contacted said they are
undecided about whether to vote for the task force
proposal or a counterproposal drawn up last week
by a group of humanities and social science pro
fessors. Approximately one third of faculty senate
members were interviewed.
Of the senators who said they have decided how
they will vote or said they are "leaning" in one
direction, a slight majority favored the task force
proposal, which was recommended to the senate
in November by the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS).
Because the full senate usually approves legisla
tion recommended by one of its committees, passage
of the proposal seemed in the fall to be almost
certain. Until very recently, there was little indica
tion the group might reject the advice of the CUS.
The emergence of the counterproposal last week
changed this, both because it — to a certain extent
— redefined the issues of the debate and because
it gave faculty members concerned with the task
force proposal a more palatable option than voting

for the status quo.
The task force proposal features three main
planks: the study of at least one non-European
culture, the inclusion of more works by women and
minority authors in the curriculum and the elimi
nation of the core list of readings currently required
in all eight Western Culture tracks.
Widespread support for the first two planks trans
lated into widespread campus support for the task
force's proposed legislation. Only a few voices ex
pressed firm opposition.
Last week's counterproposal, however, redefined
the terms of the public debate and changed its
focus. The counterproposal, signed by 25 professors
opposed to the task force legislation, based its
opposition on the core list.
The new group, led by Vice Provost and English
Prof. William Chace, agrees with the task force
that more emphasis should be placed on groups
and issues often left out of the Western Culture
curriculum, but insists that a core list should be
part of any Western Culture requirement. It
demands the perpetuation of the list for the sake
of a "common intellectual experience for ail Stan
ford undergraduates."
Chace's group notes, however, that the core list
should be "open to revision" and include more
works by women and minorities.
Supporters of the task force insist
the core list is unnecessary, stifles
the creativity of professors, keeps
young professors who may be op
posed to the restrictive nature of
the core out of the Western Culture
program and is politically divisive.
Chace, long a leading critic of
the task force, was quoted this week
in the New York Times as saying
the idea to eliminate the core list
is "a version of academic populism."
Task force member Clayborne
Carson, associate professor of his
tory, said his group's report is
moderate and any proposal advo
cating less change "would just not
be adequate."
Neither Chace nor Carson is a
member of the senate.
The recent counterproposal
succeeded in shifting attention away
from the issue of minority repre
sentation to the question of the
core list, and in the process made
a move to recapture the support of

faculty moderates who had lined
up behind the task force proposal
in the fall.
Nearly all the senators inter
viewed last night said the core list
was the central issue of the debate.
Most said they thought the argu
ments of both sides were reasonable
and that they were having a difficult
time deciding how to cast their
votes.
Economics Prof, and senator
Kenneth Arrow said he is still
debating in his mind whether a core
list is necessary to achieve the kind
of liberal arts education he thinks
is important. When he said "both
sides made very good points," he
echoed the sentiments of the
majority of his colleagues in the
senate who are not directly involved
with the Western Culture program,
as well as many of those who are.
Task force member Barry Katz,
an instructor in the Values, Tech
nology, Science and Society track,
and not a senator, said "it seems
to be anybody's guess" whether the
task force recommendations will be
approved. "I'm not going to put my
money on it."

the task force, was quoted this week
in the New York Times as saying
the idea to eliminate the core list
is "a version of academic populism."
Task force member Clayborne
Carson, associate professor of his
tory, said his group's report is
moderate and any proposal advo
cating less change "would just not
be adequate."
Neither Chace nor Carson is a
member of the senate.
The recent counterproposal
succeeded in shifting attention away
from the issue of minority repre
sentation to the question of the
core list, and in the process made
a move to recapture the support of

faculty moderates who had lined
up behind the task force proposal
in the fall.
Nearly all the senators inter
viewed last night said the core list
was the central issue of the debate.
Most said they thought the argu
ments of both sides were reasonable
and that they were having a difficult
time deciding how to cast their
votes.
Economics Prof, and senator
Kenneth Arrow said he is still
debating in his mind whether a core
list is necessary to achieve the kind
of liberal arts education he thinks
is important. When he said "both
sides made very good points," he
echoed the sentiments of the
majority of his colleagues in the
senate who are not directly involved
with the Western Culture program,
as well as many of those who are.
Task force member Barry Katz,
an instructor in the Values, Tech
nology, Science and Society track,
and not a senator, said "it seems
to be anybody's guess" whether the
task force recommendations will be
approved. "I'm not going to put my
money on it."
