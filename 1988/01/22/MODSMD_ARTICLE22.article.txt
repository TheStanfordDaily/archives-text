## KAs spike out at deadly disease 
### Kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writer 
This Saturday provides a chance
for volleyball players to sparkle —
in the mud.
Sinking into a foot of ooze might
limit mobility, but athletic agility is
not the issue for over 300 Stanford
students participating in the second
annual Kappa Alpha Volleyball
Tournament.
The tournament, an all-day event
to be held in the swampy bed of
Lake Lagunita, is a fund-raiser for
the National Muscular Dystrophy
Association (NMDA).
"It is the biggest fund-raiser by
(Stanford) students ever," said KA
President Charles Moody, a senior.
According to Moody, over $3000
was raised for the association at
last year's tournament.
"People pay more attention to
mud than to a car wash," Moody
explained. He attributed last year's
success to how "unusual" the
charity event is.
To prepare for the tournament,
fraternity members will haul out
hoses from the Palo Alto Fire De
partment today and tommorow
morning, drenching the lake's basin
with hundreds of gallons of water
to create six very muddy volleyball
courts.
"We will also hose down the
courts between games. It gets dry
because everyone soaks up the
mud," said senior Steve Baer, KA
philanthropy chairman.
After last year's tournament, par
ticipants "soaked in the shower for
four or five hours" and "found mud
in the ears" days later, Baer said.
For those who do not want to
look like mud-caked creatures from
"The Deep," Moody said non
participants are also encourged to
attend the event. But Moody said
he cannot ensure that they will
remain completely muck free.

"Even if you are not going to
play, it is a fun event to watch and
just see the ridiculous," Moody said.
For those taking part in the mud
bath (40 teams are expected), the
entry fee is $100 per team. Checks
should be made out to the National
Muscular Distrophy Association,
and all proceeds will go directly to
the association, Moody said. The
entry deadline is 6 p.m. tonight.
The 10-member teams will play
15-point games in the double
elimination tournament. Prizes,
ranging from body shampoo to din
ners at Chilis, will be awarded to
the highest-finishing teams.

Otero House won the coveted
"muddiest team award" last year
and will vie for it again this year,
Moody said.
In addition to Stanford dorm
teams and fraternities, local busi
nesses including Compadres and
Advanced Decisions Systems, a
computer company, will also field
teams.
According to NMDA Regional
Director Paul Westhelle, the KAs
have been "very successful at get
ting corporate and campus sup
port."
"They (the KAs) are our most
succesful college group that spon

sors (events) in this area," Wes
thelle said.
Proceeds from the tournament
benefit 900 muscular dystrophy
patients in the Bay Area. Because
of their efforts, the association pre
sented the KAs with a community
service award, Westshellc said.
The National Kappa Alpha
Board also cited the Stanford chap
ter as one of its top five
philanthropic chapters last year be
cause of Mud Volleyball's success.
A final warning to all those par
ticipating in tomorrow's mud bath:
Wear clothes "that you can trash"
and inexpensive shoes because "the
mud will suck them up," Baer said.
