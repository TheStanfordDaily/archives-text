# Mac upgrades: Many confusing decisions
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
If you're like the average Stan
ford student, you use your Mac
intosh to run Mac Write and
maybe a game or two. All this
talk of new Macintoshes with
more speed and power probably
doesn't impress you.

But maybe it should.
When the Macintosh was in
troduced in January 1984 it was
slow and underpowered. Still, it
was hailed as a revolution in
computing, and everyone knew
the machine's shortcomings
would be addressed.
The release of the Macintosh
512K, the so called Fat Mac, in
September 1984 was a major step
in that it quadrupled the memory
of the original machine.
Today's Macintoshes — the
SE and the Macintosh II —
make even the Mac 512K seem
like a dinosaur; they provide a
number of reasons why owners
of the older machines should
consider an upgrade.
The logic is as follows: If you
are running Mac Write on a 128K
machine, you are limited to run
ning version 2.2 (To check your
version number, select About
Mac Write. . . from the Apple
menu while running the pro

gram).
While version 2.2 is fine for
the most basic word processing
tasks, even the least sophisti
cated computer user can benefit
from the added features of
Mac Write 5.0, the latest version.
For example, version 5.0 pro
vides a 100,000-word spelling
checker, as well as ways to enter
more commands without the use
of the mouse. It's hard to imag
ine a Stanford student who
couldn't benefit from these ad
ditions The problem is, the
minimum system configuration
that will allow you to run version
5.0 is the Macinosh 512K En
hanced. This model differs from
the plain 512 in that it supports
double-sided disks and has
several different internal compo
nents that allow it to run faster.
Microdisc, located upstairs at
the Stanford Bookstore, charges
$234 to upgrade a 512K machine
to the level of a 512K Enhanced.
To upgrade a 128K machine, or
a machine with a third-party
512K upgrade — such as those
from Mac Doctor — will cost a
hefty $472.
If you go this route you will
be able to run virtually all of
your old software and a great
deal of software you couldn't run
before. Additionally, many pro
grams will run better and more
quickly.
The catch: This upgrade,
though it may be expensive, is
hardly enough to bring you
anywhere near the state of the
art. The other options available,
including selling your Macintosh
and starting anew, will be ex
plored in the next column.
