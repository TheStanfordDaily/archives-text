## First in 10 years Stanford hosts black theater conference 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
Stanford is currently hosting the
first California black theater con
ference in 10 years. "Black Theater:
Moving Toward the Twenty-First
Century," a statewide black theater
conference sponsored by the Stan
ford Committee on Black Perform
ing Arts will take place today
through Sunday at the Law School.
Conference Coordinator Halifu
Osumare said that it has taken 10
years to get a conference together
mainly because of the organiza
tional difficulties inherent in such
an undertaking. "There was no one
group that had the resources or the
network to put the conference
together," Osumare said.
"The Committee on Black Per
forming Arts decidcd that we'd like
to see another conference happen
again," Osumare said. "We called
people from the field to see if they
wanted to have a conference to dis
cuss the state of the art, and they
said they did."

Black theater has
become 'a survival of
the fittest in terms of
finding funds.'

"There's been a wide amount of
interest," said Elena Becks, an ad
ministrative assistant for the Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts.
"People have been calling from all
over the state for information."
According to Osumare, the goal
of the conference is to bring to
gether key players in the black
theater — directors, actors,
academicians — in order to "see if
a network can be created for the
development of black theater." She
Mdded that not nly '^rk
rganizations ar inv I ; al
that several white theater compan
ies, like the San Francisco-based

American Conservatory Theatre,
are interested in producing black
plays.
The three-day conference has
several programs scheduled, but
three featured events at Kresge
Auditorium represent the compre
hensive focus of the conference,
Osumare said.
Tonight, actor-playwright John
O'Neal will perform his critically
acclaimed one-man show "You
Can't Judge a Book by Looking at
it's Cover: Sayings From the Life
of Jabbo Jones." O'Neal's perform
ance is a humorous collection of
stories which is, according to one
reviewer, about "how being black
in Mississippi taxes a man's in
genuity."
On Saturday, the keynote address

will be given by producer/director
Woodie King, known for guiding
such plays as "For Colored Girls
Who Have Considered Suicide..
to national prominence.
Sunday's full session, "Moving
Towards the Twenty-First Century"
will feature Woodie King and UC-
Berkeley Drama Prof. Margaret
Wilkerson, who has undertaken the
most comprehensive study to date
of black theaters in California.
Osumare said the conference is
important as a way to make people
aware of the current state of black
theater. "There has been a
proliferation of black theater,"
Osumare said. "Ten years ago,
there were only 10 major theater
companies; now there arc over 50
in the state."

She added that with the rise of
black theater there has been a cor
responding need for money. As a
result, black theater has become "a
survival of the fittest in terms of
finding funds," she said.
Osumare said she hopes that con
ference will address these issues but
stressed that "it will have to come
from the participants themselves"
to effect change.
Becks said she doesn't know yet
if the conference will become an
annual event. "It's hard to say,"
she said. "What we're trying to do
is get people together so that hope-i
fully something more concrete can
develop."
Tickets for conference events are
available through BASS and the
Tresidder box office.
