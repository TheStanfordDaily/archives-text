Dramarama â€” "Box Office
Bomb"
Right off the bat, I have to
say that I really like these guys.
Ever since I heard their debut
album, "Cinema Verite," I have
become a fan of this hard
driving, witty and at times sar
castic band.
Consider their hit "Anything,
Anything (I'll Give You)," the
frustrated bachelor's anthem.
How can you not admire an artist
with the boldness to declare
"When I was young I learned a
game/ Where love and happiness
were the same/ Now I'm older
and I don't play/ I found out
the hardest way"?
Second only to The Smiths'
"Unhappy Birthday" (which
begins with the immortal lines,
"I've come to wish you an un
happy birthday/ Because you're
evil and you lie/ And if you
should die/ I might be slightly
sad/ But I won't cry") for
straight-ahead, no-holds-barred
poignancy, "Anything, Anything"
and the other songs on the album
are hardly songs to share with
the grandparents.
Dramarama's eagerly an

ticipated follow-up definitely
lives up to the standard set by
the band's debut. Sin
ger/songwriter John Easdale has
penned 11 more tunes, effec
tively mixing raucous lead guitar
lines occasionally bordering on
feedback, compelling percussion
and his ever-biting lyrics. "Box
Office Bomb" is anything but a
flop.
Following along the lines of
"Cinema Verite," several songs
clearly stand out from the rest.
"It's Still Warm," the first single
off of the album, is the best song
of the production, casting a
skeptical eye on the band's new
success, California and the re
cording industry ("Hold my
hand, I've got a new career/ But
it's still warm out here").
On the down side, Easdale's
talent as a composer does not
match his penchant for lyrics,
and you often feel a sense of
deja vu when one of the later
songs on the album cranks into
the chorus. It also gets tiring
after about 20 minutes, making
it much more desirable to listen
to the record one side at a time
rather than sitting through the
whole thing.
Nonetheless, "Box Office
Bomb" is definitely worth listen
ing to and worth owning.
