# Director Huston finds life in Joyce's 'Dead'
## 
### Erik Hagestad 
John Huston's latest and final film, "The Dead,"
is a monumental cinematic achievement. In an era of
light entertainment and overblown melodrama, Huston
has succeeded in creating a delicate and passionate
work of art.
"The Dead" is an adaption of James Joyce's ac
claimed short story. Huston had been hoping to film
the story for over 30 years, and so it is appropriate
that it should be the culminating work of his career,
which spanned six decades.
This sense of personal culmination is enhanced by
the film's use of talent from other members of the
Huston clan. The director's son Tony wrote the screen
adaption, and his daughter Anjelica gives a nearly
perfect performance in the female lead.
The film portrays the relationship between Gabriel
Conroy (Donal McCann) and his wife, Greta (Anjelica
Huston) as Gabriel comes to realize his lack of un
derstanding and love for Greta and the ugliness of
his own egocentricity. More generally, however, "The
Dead" illustrates the interdependence of all experience
and memory, of both the living and the dead.
The film's setting is the Dublin home of Gabriel's
two elderly aunts, Kate (Helena Carroll) and Julia
(Cathleen Delany) on the night of their annual after-
Christmas party. Despite being confined almost entirely
to a few small rooms of the house, the film never
stagnates thanks to the wonderfully intricate interac
tion of the party guests.
Joyce's writing is not particularly suited to the screen,
for he often favors description at the expense of plot;
however, director Huston has largely overcome this
impediment through the use of a lush cinematic style
and the addition of a strong line of humor.
For instance, the camera waltzes through the warmly
lit dance room, following the shitting conversations,
or it rolls lightly along the dinner table, providing
brief glimpses of the lively feast.
Also, many of the unavoidable lulls in the story line
are filled by an emphasis on the humorous interplay
between two drunk guests, carefree Freddy Malins

and the dignified Mr. Browne, played to comic excel
lence by Donal Donnelly and Dan O'Herlihy, respec
tively. Unfortunately, the introduction of humor does
not manage to enliven all the slow parts of the film,
so it drags at points.
Indeed, by no means can one call "The Dead"
fast-paccd entertainment to make it such would
be a desecration of Joycc's writing, but the Hustons
have managed to transfer the emphasis of the tale
from prose to visuals without any great loss.
The most remarkable portion of the film is the
climactic scene between Gabriel and Greta in which
she tells him of a former adolescent love. In this
scene, Huston manages to convey, almost purely
through visual style, Gabriel's realization of his own
lonely conceit and lack of true feeling.
As he comprehends how strongly Greta once loved,
Gabriel shrinks into the background of the scene,
becoming small, pathetic and almost vulgar in com
parison with Greta's large, beautiful profile which
glows with tragic emotion.
Huston follows this climax by giving voice to the
final lines of Joyce's story, some of the most enthralling
words written in the English language. He combines
this internal monologue with visions of Ireland beneath
the falling snow, a unifying symbol throughout both
the story and the film. The images are breathtaking,
and when combined with Joyce's lines, the result is
one of the most beautiful and inspired moments in
cinema.
"The Dead" is by no means a perfect adaption, nor
a perfect film in its own right. Several important
aspects of Joyce's story have been ignored, such as
Gabriel's lust (as opposed to love) for Greta, which
Joyce brought to life in an important passage. The
result is that the film may be a bit slow or confusing
for those who have not read the story, but on the
whole, it is a work of compelling beauty and insight.
Perhaps the most wonderful aspect of "The Dead,"
though, is that it was made at all; hopefully its success
will be an eye-opening precedent for an all-too-money
oriented and shallow-minded Hollywood.
