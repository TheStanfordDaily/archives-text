## Hobbled Cardinal takes on California 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Maybe the gods of basketball want the big game to
be closer.
At least that's what the Stanford basketball team
must be thinking after starters Todd Lichti and Howard
Wright each slightly injured an ankle in practice yes
terday.
That's good news for the struggling California
Golden Bears (5-9 overall, 2-4 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference), who will visit Stanford's Maples Pavilion
tomorrow night for a 7:35 p.m. tip-off.
"Todd and Howard both went down (in practice)
with ankle injuries, but I think they'll both be playing
Saturday," Cardinal guard Terry Taylor said after prac
tice last night.
In any case, physical misfortunes come at a bad
time for Coach Mike Montgomery's squad, which has
lost three out of its last four games, defeating only
the ccllar-dwelling Washington Huskies.
The Cardinal (11-6, 3-3) is coming off a heartbreak
ing loss to Washington State last Saturday but has
had a full week to prepare for tomorrow's contest.
The Golden Bears, meanwhile, ended a seven-game
losing streak against the Huskies last Saturday. During
the losing streak, the Bears shot a dismal 35 percent
from the field and scored 10 points and 12 points in
the first halves of two of the contests.
Nevertheless, this is a traditional rivalry.
"I think we're more psyched about this game than
some others because they're kind of like our rivals,"
Taylor said. "That's definitely pumping us up."
Only one California player has been consistently
pumping in the points, and his name is Matt Beeuw
saert. The 6-foot-6 junior transfer from Notre Dame
is averaging 16.0 points per game, 21 per Pac-10
contest.

"Bceuwsacrt is by far their best player," Taylor said.
"We'll have to shut him down."
He of the unpronounceable name is also averaging
7.4 rebounds per game and 3.2 assists. Beeuwsaert,
however, is the only Bear who is guaranteed a starting
job. In the Washington game, a frustrated California
Coach Lou Campanelli started Beeuwsaert and four
freshman, including two walk-ons.
"They've been shuffling a lot of guys in there,"
Taylor said. "I don't know what Campanelli's doing,
but the way things are going they'll play a lot of guys
in the first half."
Last season Stanford and California split their two
contests, with the Bears winning 87-82 in Harmon
Gym, and the Cardinal coming out victorious at
Maples, 88-80.
The Bears have won eight out of the last 10 meetings,
but the momentum seemed to be twisting toward the
Cardinal, possibly until a couple of ankles twisted
yesterday.
Lichti and Wright are the leading scorers and
rebounders for Stanford, and both have played many
more minutes than any of their teammates. Lichti is
registering 20.8 points per game, 5.7 rebounds and 33
minutes, while Wright has posted 13.9 points, 8.1
rebounds, and 32 minutes.
Lately Stanford has seen quite a bit of zone defense,
and tomorrow the Cardinal will most likely see some
more.
"The one thing they do is trap a lot out of their
zone," Taylor said. "I don't think we'll have a lot of
trouble with that, though."
Taylor and company had trouble from long distance
against Washington State, pulling their best Jckyll and
Hyde imitation. Against Washington two days earlier,
Stanford set a school record with 10 3-pointers, only
to go 2-for-10 from beyond the stripe against Wash
ington State.

If Todd Lichti and Howard YVright are unable to play tomorrow against California, look for juniors Terry
Taylor and Bryan McSweeney (23) to light up the Cardinal offense.
