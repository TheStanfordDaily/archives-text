# Faculty Senate meeting
## Students rally for Area 1 change 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Holding placards asserting "The
status quo has got to go" and"The core
list is the real closing of the American
mind," more than 100 students flanked
an entrance to the Law School yesterday
through which Faculty Senate members
passed on their way to debate changes
in the University's Western Culture re
quirement.
Members of the Asian American Stu
dents Association, the Black Student
Union, MEChA, the Stanford American
Indian Organization, Stanford Organi
zation for Lesbian and Gay Equality
and Students United for a Democratic
Education staged a demonstration in

support of the Western Culture Task
Force's proposed revisions of the West
ern Culture, or Area One, requirement.
The demonstrators, who held signs
listing notable minority and women
writers' names and quotations, turned
out for the meeting to "show the Faculty
Senate that we do have support from
the community and to make sure the
support is heard," BSU spokesperson
Louis Jackson said.
Sophomore Cannetta Ivy read a state
ment written for the occasion by the
Rev. Jesse Jackson praising the "cou
rageous stuggle" of the Stanford stu
dents to change the curriculum. "The
proposal to change the Stanford West
ern Culture program is in the best spirit
of the Rainbow Coalition," Jackson

wrote. "To be truly educated, one must
study the fullness of our nation. The
imminent changes at Stanford represent
a positive step into the future for higher
education in America," Jackson said.
The demonstration was staged to
show approval for the task force's pro
posal for a new course titled "Cultures,
Ideas and Values." CIV would include
the study of works from at least one
European culture and at least one non-
European culture, as well as works by
women and people of color.
The current Western Culture core
reading list of 15 authors would be
abolished under the task force proposal.

More than 100 students flanked the entrance to the Law School before the Faculty Senate meeting yesterday to demonstrate
for changes in the University's Western Culture requirement.
In addition, the proposal calls for
a review of the curriculum in three
years, at which time a core list could
be proposed, according to senior
Rudy Fuentes, a student represen
tative to the Faculty Senate's Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies.
Senior Jinny Shinsato voiced
AASA's support for the task force
proposal. In a statement read at
the demonstration, Shinsato said
the proposal is a "progressive step"
because it recognizes the impor
tance of "contrasting ideas and
values drawn from different tradi
tions and cultures and of moving
away from a Eurocentric focus."
At the demonstration, Students
for Western Culture, a newly

formed student group that opposes
the task force proposal, passed out
fliers. According to freshman Norm
Book, the fliers were designed to
let the senate know that the six
groups supporting the proposal "are
not representative of Stanford as a
whole."
In addition to Students for West
ern Culture, a group called "Save
the Core!" met two days ago to
organize a campaign in support of
English Prof. William Chace's
recent counterproposal to keep the
core reading list and to add a se
lection of works by minorities and
women to the required reading.
"What we want to do is preseve
what we have and add to what we
have to make it better," said Lora
Headrick, an undeclared sopho
more and a member of the group.
Responding to Chace's coun

tcrproposal, Jackson wrote that the
counterproposal should have been
made a long time ago "if it was
that important to them." The
struggle to change the Western Cul
ture requirement has gone on for
almost eight years, Jackson wrote,
but the opposition to change
emerged only two days before the
debate. "It was almost hypocritical
in a way," he said.
According to senior Julie Mar
tinez, spokesperson for MEChA,
Chace's proposal is "tokenist, add
ing a few minorities and women on
the side to appease people."
The task force proposal, if ap
proved by the senate, would give
"a much better perspective of the
ideas that made our society and a
better reflection of the people that
make up this society today," Mar
tinez said.
