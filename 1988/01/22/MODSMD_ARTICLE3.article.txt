## Students rally for Area 1 change 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Holding placards asserting "The
status quo has got to go" and"The core
list is the real closing of the American
mind," more than 100 students flanked
an entrance to the Law School yesterday
through which Faculty Senate members
passed on their way to debate changes
in the University's Western Culture re
quirement.
Members of the Asian American Stu
dents Association, the Black Student
Union, MEChA, the Stanford American
Indian Organization, Stanford Organi
zation for Lesbian and Gay Equality
and Students United for a Democratic
Education staged a demonstration in

support of the Western Culture Task
Force's proposed revisions of the West
ern Culture, or Area One, requirement.
The demonstrators, who held signs
listing notable minority and women
writers' names and quotations, turned
out for the meeting to "show the Faculty
Senate that we do have support from
the community and to make sure the
support is heard," BSU spokesperson
Louis Jackson said.
Sophomore Cannetta Ivy read a state
ment written for the occasion by the
Rev. Jesse Jackson praising the "cou
rageous stuggle" of the Stanford stu
dents to change the curriculum. "The
proposal to change the Stanford West
ern Culture program is in the best spirit
of the Rainbow Coalition," Jackson

wrote. "To be truly educated, one must
study the fullness of our nation. The
imminent changes at Stanford represent
a positive step into the future for higher
education in America," Jackson said.
The demonstration was staged to
show approval for the task force's pro
posal for a new course titled "Cultures,
Ideas and Values." CIV would include
the study of works from at least one
European culture and at least one non-
European culture, as well as works by
women and people of color.
The current Western Culture core
reading list of 15 authors would be
abolished under the task force proposal.
