# No. 1 netters open season

The race to Athens has begun,
and it starts in Atlanta.
Chasing after the NCAA bid that
eluded it last season, the revamped
and top-ranked (along with Geor
gia) Stanford men's tennis team
opens its season tomorrow and Sun
day in Atlanta against No. 25 Geor
gia Tech and No. 10 Tennessee.
In a series of matchups designed
to dedicate Georgia Tech's new in
door center, the Cardinal begins
the competition by facing the Yel
low Jackets in what is a reunion of
softs for Stanford Coach Dick
Gould and Georgia Tech Coach
Gery Gorsmond.
Gorsmond, a 1973 Stanford grad
uate and a starter on Gould's first
NCAA championship team, has
recently taken over the coaching
reigns in an attempt to turn the
Tech program around.
With no players ranked in the
top 50 nationally, Gorsmond and
his Yellow Jackets could be running
into a buzzsaw fueled by three Stan
ford players in the nation's top 50.
And that doesn't include freshman
David Wheaton (No. 3), who is out
with a lacerated left wrist.
"Georgia Tech has two good
players at the top," Stanford's Jeff


Benjamin Tong/Daily file
Sophomore JelT Cathrall figures to be one of the strongest No. 4 or No. 5 players on
a college team this year.
