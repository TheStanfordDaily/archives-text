# No. 1 netters open season
## 
### Matthew Hodman Editorial staff 
The race to Athens has begun,
and it starts in Atlanta.
Chasing after the NCAA bid that
eluded it last season, the revamped
and top-ranked (along with Geor
gia) Stanford men's tennis team
opens its season tomorrow and Sun
day in Atlanta against No. 25 Geor
gia Tech and No. 10 Tennessee.
In a series of matchups designed
to dedicate Georgia Tech's new in
door center, the Cardinal begins
the competition by facing the Yel
low Jackets in what is a reunion of
softs for Stanford Coach Dick
Gould and Georgia Tech Coach
Gery Gorsmond.
Gorsmond, a 1973 Stanford grad
uate and a starter on Gould's first
NCAA championship team, has
recently taken over the coaching
reigns in an attempt to turn the
Tech program around.
With no players ranked in the
top 50 nationally, Gorsmond and
his Yellow Jackets could be running
into a buzzsaw fueled by three Stan
ford players in the nation's top 50.
And that doesn't include freshman
David Wheaton (No. 3), who is out
with a lacerated left wrist.
"Georgia Tech has two good
players at the top," Stanford's Jeff


Benjamin Tong/Daily file
Sophomore JelT Cathrall figures to be one of the strongest No. 4 or No. 5 players on
a college team this year.
Tarango said. "But their depth is
not so good. Not many teams can
stay with us (from top to bottom).
Jeff Cathral! didn't lose many
matches at No. 3 last year, and
when David gets back he'll play
No 5. That's a little scary."

From the first to sixth singles
spots and in all three doubles com
binations, the Cardinal is indeed
loaded.
Tarango (No. 19 nationally),
senior Patrick McEnroe (12th),
freshman Martin Blackman (45th),
sophomore Cathrall, freshman Glen
Solomon and sophomore Barry Ric
hards lead the singles brigade.
McEnroe-Blackman, Cathrall-Eric
Peus and Tarango-Richards set the

doubles lineup.
Of the two matches, the more
interesting battle is against Tennes
see Sunday. The Volunteers have
two of the top players in the nation
in seniors Byron Talbot and Shelby
Cannon. Talbot is ranked fourth
nationally, and Cannon is fifth.
They also combine to form the
third-ranked doubles tandem in the
country.
With Georgia Tech and Tennes

see as Stanford's first two season
matches, many will watch this
weekend to see just how last year's
No. 19 team has become this year's
team to beat. Tennessee in partic
ular should prove a stiff test.
"The No. 1 team has to prove
they've earned it," Gould said. "We
are playing two pretty good teams
away from home, and we're young.
But it's time to play; we're looking
forward to it."
