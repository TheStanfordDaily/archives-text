# Hoops faces Cal, San Jose State
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
It's rivalry time again in the Bay Area
this weekend. Tonight at Berkeley the
Stanford women's basketball team renews
Big Game hostilities when it faces Cali
fornia, a team that has beaten the Car
dinal in nine of the past 10 meetings.
The Cardinal travels to San Jose State
Saturday.
Stanford is currently ranked 11th in the
nation by the Associated Press poll, one
spot ahead of the Washington team that
defeated the Cardinal last weekend bv a
77-60 margin. The loss leaves Stanford at
14-1 overall, 3-1 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference and second in the league, behind
the Huskies and USC, both 3-0.
The Golden Bears, on the other hand,
arc in a four-way tie for last place in the
Pac-10 with a 1-3 mark, 10-6 overall.
Nevertheless, enjoying the home court
benefits of noisy Harmon Gym and a 13-9
record against the Cardinal in the last 11
years, California has the psychological up
per hand.
"1 know what kind of rivalry exists be
tween Stanford and Cal, and I hope our
team understands the intensity and the
emotion involved with the game," Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDcrveer said. "Paper
records mean nothing when you play with
Cal at Cal. I believe we are the better
team, but we have to play the better game.
"Our team has to take this game very
seriously with a tremendous amount of
teamwork. They play a lot of different
people in a lot of different combinations,
and at any time if you don't do what you
arc supposed to do they can hurt you,"
she said.
The Cardinal learned this valuable les
son last week, when the Huskies shut
Stanford down in front of 4300 vocal fans
at Hcc F.dmondson Pavilion and gave the

Cardinal its first loss of the season. This
little bit of knowledge should lead Stan
ford a long way this weekend.
"I think [the fact] that we played at
Washington should help us," VanDcrveer
said. "At Washington there was noise,
there were a lot of people and Washington
was sky-high. That kind of experience can
help us; it doesn't have to rattle our team,
and I'm sure we'll have our fans (at
Berkeley), too," she said.

"They're really going to be up to play
us," junior center Jill Yanke saia. "I have
a feeling they are going to be more up
for us than any of the other teams they
play, especially on their own home court."
"I know they arc going to have a lot
of people. The more people at a game,
whether they are for us or them, the more
I like it. I know it's going to be loud and
they're going to be fired up, but I think
we will be, too," she said.
Judging by talent and performance
alone, Stanford has a big advantage. The
Golden Bears are trying to compensate
for the loss of several powerful players
who graduated last June, while the Car
dinal is looking better and better.
"Realistically, it's hard to see Cal really
being in the race for No. 1 or No. 2 in
the league," VanDcrveer said. "They're
a very young team, and they've lost three
games already — that was as many as
last year's champion lost."
"They have a lot of young players that
have looked good in certain games and
spurts," she said. "They have a young
player, Laura Baker, who is playing well,
and a senior forward, Amanda Ray, who

is strong, rebounds and is probably their
best player inside."
Ray is also statistically strong, placing
eighth in the Pac-10 in scoring, eighth in
free throws and second in rebounds.
The Stanford team, too, is statistically
impressive. The squad is currently rated
eighth nationally in three-point field goals
made, a category in which sophomore
guard Jennifer Azzi holds the 14th indi
vidual spot. Stanford and Azzi also hold
a firm lock on the top spots on the Pac-10
assists lists.
In addition, the Cardinal leads the
league in scoring margin, is second in
scoring offense, scoring defense and free
throw percentage, and is third in rebound
margin. The Golden Bears, however, only
rate in the top three in scoring offense.
Nevertheless, after last weekend, Stan
ford has learned not to take any opponent
for granted and not to allow itself to be
taken out of its own game. "We learned
that we need to work our half-court of
fense better," Yanke said. "We've been
working on it all week, and we've gotten
some of the wrinkles out.
"Basically, we need to come out more
fired up, with more intensity, with more
of that gut instinct that we're going to
win."
Just like in the Big Game in football,
the contest will boil down to a meeting
of emotions, with the team best able to
handle the anxiety and pressure emerging
as the victor. VanDcrvcer has set up her
game plan accordingly.
"We have to do things with intensity
and enthusiasm," the Cardinal coach said.
"I think that those two words will be the
difference in the game, not so much
rebounding and shooting."
"If we do those things with intensity
and enthusiasm, I don't think there is any
way we can possibly be outplayed," she
said.

"They have a lot of young players that
have looked good in certain games and
spurts," she said. "They have a young
player, Laura Baker, who is playing well,
and a senior forward, Amanda Ray, who

is strong, rebounds and is probably their
best player inside."
Ray is also statistically strong, placing
eighth in the Pac-10 in scoring, eighth in
free throws and second in rebounds.
The Stanford team, too, is statistically
impressive. The squad is currently rated
eighth nationally in three-point field goals
made, a category in which sophomore
guard Jennifer Azzi holds the 14th indi
vidual spot. Stanford and Azzi also hold
a firm lock on the top spots on the Pac-10
assists lists.
In addition, the Cardinal leads the
league in scoring margin, is second in
scoring offense, scoring defense and free
throw percentage, and is third in rebound
margin. The Golden Bears, however, only
rate in the top three in scoring offense.
Nevertheless, after last weekend, Stan
ford has learned not to take any opponent
for granted and not to allow itself to be
taken out of its own game. "We learned
that we need to work our half-court of
fense better," Yanke said. "We've been
working on it all week, and we've gotten
some of the wrinkles out.
"Basically, we need to come out more
fired up, with more intensity, with more
of that gut instinct that we're going to
win."
Just like in the Big Game in football,
the contest will boil down to a meeting
of emotions, with the team best able to
handle the anxiety and pressure emerging
as the victor. VanDcrvcer has set up her
game plan accordingly.
"We have to do things with intensity
and enthusiasm," the Cardinal coach said.
"I think that those two words will be the
difference in the game, not so much
rebounding and shooting."
"If we do those things with intensity
and enthusiasm, I don't think there is any
way we can possibly be outplayed," she
said.

Freshman forward Celeste I .avoir (white) should hrlp Stanford bounce back from last wrek's
loss to Pacific-10 rival Washington.
It's rivalry time again in the Bay Area
this weekend. Tonight at Berkeley the
Stanford women's basketball team renews
Big Game hostilities when it faces Cali
fornia, a team that has beaten the Car
dinal in nine of the past 10 meetings.
The Cardinal travels to San Jose State
Saturday.
Stanford is currently ranked 11th in the
nation by the Associated Press poll, one
spot ahead of the Washington team that
defeated the Cardinal last weekend bv a
77-60 margin. The loss leaves Stanford at
14-1 overall, 3-1 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference and second in the league, behind
the Huskies and USC, both 3-0.
The Golden Bears, on the other hand,
arc in a four-way tie for last place in the
Pac-10 with a 1-3 mark, 10-6 overall.
Nevertheless, enjoying the home court
benefits of noisy Harmon Gym and a 13-9
record against the Cardinal in the last 11
years, California has the psychological up
per hand.
"1 know what kind of rivalry exists be
tween Stanford and Cal, and I hope our
team understands the intensity and the
emotion involved with the game," Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDcrveer said. "Paper
records mean nothing when you play with
Cal at Cal. I believe we are the better
team, but we have to play the better game.
"Our team has to take this game very
seriously with a tremendous amount of
teamwork. They play a lot of different
people in a lot of different combinations,
and at any time if you don't do what you
arc supposed to do they can hurt you,"
she said.
The Cardinal learned this valuable les
son last week, when the Huskies shut
Stanford down in front of 4300 vocal fans
at Hcc F.dmondson Pavilion and gave the

Cardinal its first loss of the season. This
little bit of knowledge should lead Stan
ford a long way this weekend.
"I think [the fact] that we played at
Washington should help us," VanDcrveer
said. "At Washington there was noise,
there were a lot of people and Washington
was sky-high. That kind of experience can
help us; it doesn't have to rattle our team,
and I'm sure we'll have our fans (at
Berkeley), too," she said.

"They're really going to be up to play
us," junior center Jill Yanke saia. "I have
a feeling they are going to be more up
for us than any of the other teams they
play, especially on their own home court."
"I know they arc going to have a lot
of people. The more people at a game,
whether they are for us or them, the more
I like it. I know it's going to be loud and
they're going to be fired up, but I think
we will be, too," she said.
Judging by talent and performance
alone, Stanford has a big advantage. The
Golden Bears are trying to compensate
for the loss of several powerful players
who graduated last June, while the Car
dinal is looking better and better.
"Realistically, it's hard to see Cal really
being in the race for No. 1 or No. 2 in
the league," VanDcrveer said. "They're
a very young team, and they've lost three
games already — that was as many as
last year's champion lost."
"They have a lot of young players that
have looked good in certain games and
spurts," she said. "They have a young
player, Laura Baker, who is playing well,
