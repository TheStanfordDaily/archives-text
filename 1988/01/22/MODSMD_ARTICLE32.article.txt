# Spikers head for first action at Santa Barbara

### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
Being a part of the Stanford men's volley
ball program is sort of like being the little
brother of a girl who graduated from Harvard
. . . uh, Stanford with a perfect 4.0 GPA:
You are always looking to achieve as much
as she did. Or, in the case of men's volleyball,
you are always trying to contend with the
success of your female counterparts.
Although the Stanford women's team has
reached the NCAA final four the past six
consecutive years, the men's squad is still
looking for its first appearance in that pres
tigious field. This may just be the year it
happens.
The Cardinal squad left yesterday for UC-
Santa Barbara in preparation for their first
action of the year. The team will be par
ticipating in a tournament featuring 21 other
top teams from around the country, as well
as two squads from Canada. There are two
noticeable absentees from the tournament,
however; No.l Penn State and N0.5 Pepper
dine will not play.
"We don't know much about the other
teams," Stanford Head Coach Fred Sturm
said. "Our purpose (in going to the tourna
ment) is to look at the other teams and see
how they play us."
Stanford, though not picked in the
preseason top 10, was one of 10 other teams
that received votes in the preseason polls.
But Sturm warned Cardinal fans about being
overconfident. "We lost seven men from last
year," he said. "We're focusing our play in
terms of improvement this year."
Aside from the four graduating seniors,

Stanford has also lost a player who trans
ferred and has chosen to redshirt two other
team members. Two names from that group
of seven should leap out at those who fol
lowed the squad last year.
One is Scott Fortune, who would have
been a senior this year if he were playing
with the team. Fortune is trying to finish
recuperating from a foot injury that hampered
him last year and is was practicing with the
U.S. national team. The other big contributor
who is gone is sophomore Kent Steffes who
transferred to UCLA at the end of last year.
But don't let Sturm's attitude or the loss
of a large number of players fool you. The
Cardinal, despite its focus on "improvement,"
will be a contending force in the Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. Stan
ford is coming off three consecutive berths
to the Western Regional of the NCAA tour
nament and should do at least that well again
this year.
Although the team, according to Sturm,
"has no proven superstars," there are a num
ber of players who will play an important
role in the Cardinal's run at the national
championship. Sophomore hitter Dan Hanon
is a preseason third team All-America selec
tion and should key a balanced Stanford
attack.
Sophomore Parker Blackman, freshman
Rvan O'Hara and senior captain Brad Nelson
will also become faimiliar names as the season
progresses.
Sturm, however, said he is not depending
on big individual efforts to win games for
