# No. 6 Stanford meets No. 4 Arizona State

### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Prepared for an easy weekend taking on
the Santa Clara Swim Club and a little Cal
ifornia sunshine, the men's swim team has
suddenly found itself hosting nationally
ranked Arizona State Saturday due to a
scheduling glitch.
Coming off a loss to Michigan last weekend,
the three-time-defending NCAA champion
Cardinal has an opportunity to show its cham
pionship form tomorrow when it takes on its
Pacific 10 rival. Stanford, 4-2 overall and 2-0
in conference competition, will seek to remain
undefeated in the Pac-10 and hopes to bolster
its fallen national ranking. Ranked second
in preseason polls, the squad is currently
rated sixth.
The Sun Devils will not be easy prey.
"We defintely have a certain rivalry with
Arizona State," senior tri-captain Sean
Murphy said. "And they arc a good dual
meet team, even better than Michigan."
The fourth-ranked Sun Devils arc tough
dual meet competitors. In addition, Arizona
State crushed Texas, which gave the Cardinal
its first loss of the season in early December.
"It's going to be a competitive meet.
They're definitely a hard team to beat," said
sophomore backstroker Rick Gould.
Although Arizona State does not have any
well-known swimmers, the team consists of
a number of talented athletes, many of whom
are currently rated in the top 10 nationally
in their events. Frecstyler Paul Howe is fourth
in the 200-meter freestyle, only two-tenths
of a second behind Stanford's John Witchel,
and Gerhardt Vanderwallt is fourth in the

400-meter individual medley.
The Sun Devils also have two ranked 500-
meter freestylers, as well as a ranked
breaststrokcr and butterflier; also, the squad's
medley and freestyle relay teams have both
recorded faster times than the Cardinal this
season.
"On paper they beat us, so it is a matter
of us having to do something different than
we have done the past few meets," Stanford
Coach Skip Kcnney said.
According to Kcnney, the Cardinal needs
to swim harder and more aggressively than
it has been swimming so far this season. He
said the team needs to attack the meet better
than it has been doing and be especially
agrcssive in events following a winning swim.
In addition, Kcnney said he believes it is
imperative that swimmers come in second
and third in events in addition to first, since
the Cardinal has been letting its opponents
gain valuable points by not capturing more
than one place in many races.
"Our depth has not helped us at all so
far. We really need those seconds and thirds.
It has to come through for us to be victorious
this weekend," Kcnney said.
Since Arizona State is favored in the med
ley relay, the first event, Stanford is going
to have to be able to overcome an early
deficit if necessary. Accustomed to winning
the opening race, the inability to rebound
cost the Cardinal the meet against Michigan.
"Momentum is a huge factor, and they arc
definitely going to start out strong," Murphy
added. "Hopefully we can make a dent in
the first few events and come back stronc in

the 200-meter stroke races."
The Cardinal does have an ad
vantage in that the Sun Devils have
a meet against California today, so
they will have had two hard days
of swimming in a row. In addition,
Stanford will have the home pool

advantage. However, swimmers on
the Cardinal squad said they felt
the huge crowd at Michigan and
the enthusiam they generated really
aided the swimmers of both squads.
"The fans at Michigan made it
a great swimming atmosphere," said
junior Jay Mortenson. "We really
hope lots of students will comc out
Saturday. It defintely helps our
times."
