# Second-rated Card faces UCLA, USC

Enough hors d'oeuvres; bring on
the main course.
That is the feeling of the Stanford
women's swimming team as it opens
the difficult part of its season
schedule today in Los Angeles. The
Cardinal, 2-0 in dual meets this
season, faces UCLA today and USC
tomorrow in what will be the first
true tests for the team in its cam
paign to improve on its runner-up
status at last year's NCAA cham
pionships.
Not only did both the Bruins and
the Trojans place in the top 15
nationally last season, but both are
currently ranked in the top 10 this
year. Thus, the second-ranked Car
dinal will be favored, but will
definately have its hands full.
"They're pretty strong," said
junior Michelle Donahue. "We
can't take them lightly."
But the Cardinal is also very
strong and has pehaps the best team
the school has ever had. "We've
been really consistent this season,"
said senior Jen Pokluda.
Of the two, the Trojans appear
stronger than their Southern Cali
fornia rivals. USC returns many
placc winners from the 1987
NCAAs, led by Leslie Daland. The
sophomore first made a name for
herself at the Goodwill Games in
Moscow in 1986, winning both the
distance freestyle events.
After she decided to swim for
USC, and under her father, Peter
Daland, the Trojans' coach, she
continued her success last year. At
the Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionships she won the 1650-yard

freestyle, five seconds ahead of
Stanford senior Stacy Shupe and
seven seconds ahead of third-place
finisher Donahue.
In the 500, Daland scored a third,
trailing Cardinal junior Dana An
derson and sophomore Lisa Gil
lespie. Three weeks later, at the
NCAA finals, Daland took 11th in
the 500 (Anderson was 9th, Shupe
12th) and Bth in the 1650 (Shupe
finished 6th, Gillespie 11th).
The Trojans are also placed in
the top 10 in both the 200 and 400
medley relays at the NCAAs and
have returning Ail-Americans to
test Stanford's top swimmer, junior
Jenna Johnson, in both the 50 free
and the 100 fly. Of course, Johnson
has won both of these events at the
NCAAs. . .
Today's foes, the Bruins, don't
have quite as much talent as USC,
but are nobody's pushover. Sopho
more Kim Rosso may be best
remembered by the Cardinal, as it
was her second place in the 200
free at the Pac-lOs that prevented
a Stanford 1-2-3-4 sweep. As it
ended up, junior Aimee Berzins
won for the Cardinal, with Gil
lespie, Anderson and Shupe follow
ing Rosso.
The Bruins also have an All-
America diver in junior Karla
Goltman, but Stanford counters
with All-Amcrica sophomore Katie
Connors. And in the other events
a strong edge is with the Cardinal.
Stanford has the top backstrokers
in the nation with five returning
All-Americas (Donahue, Fokluda,
junior Jenny Shannon and sopho
mores Laurie McLean and Susan
nah Miller) and arguably the top
breaststrokers.
