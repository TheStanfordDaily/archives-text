# Whitlingers, Green spark tourney wins
## 
### 
Studies have shown that twins
tend to exhibit the same behavior
— among other things, they dress
and act alike. A case in point is
Stanford freshmen Tami and Teri
Whitlinger, who happen to play ten
nis the same way.
They win.
The sisters were not exactly in
identical form yesterday in the
opening day of the Women's Inter
collegiate Invitational Tennis
Championships at the Riviera Ten
nis Club in Pacific Palisades. But
they were dam close.
Tami, the top seed in the singles
draw, lost just six games in two
matches in advancing to today's
third round. Teri, the 16th seed,
was a notch better, dropping only
four games.
Cardinal sophomore Lisa Green,
the tournament's No. 7 seed and
an NCAA semifinalist last year,
joined the Whitlingers in the third
round after capturing a pair of
three-set matches.
Three other Stanford players
were ousted in the first day of ac
tion. Senior Kay Tittle lost in the
second round, and junior Eleni
Rossides, the No. 3 seed, and fresh
man Sandra Birch were eliminated
in the opening round.
All three of the Cardinal doubles
entries won their first-round
matches yesterday and advanced to

both of her matches yesterday.

round, she escaped with a 6-3, 3-6,
6-3 victory over Utah's Michelle
Mras in the afternoon match.
Rossides and Tittle both fell vic
tim to players they had defeated in
last year's NCAA team champion

storm by her, taking the next seven
games and the match.
Tittle beat SMU's talented Jean

Birch, the top recruit in the na
tion last year, was nipped by
UCLA's Kirsten Dreyer 6-4, 2-6,

No. 7 seeds, advanced with a 6-4,
