# Fencing looks to foil rivals at Long Beach
## 
### Mike Shay Staff writer 
After more than a month and a
half of rest, the Stanford men's and
women's fencing teams return to
action, taking on Air Force, Fuller
ton State, Long Beach and possibly
San Diego State tomorrow at Long
Beach.
The Cardinal's most recent bout
took place Dec. 5 at Evanston, 111.,
where the squads competed against
nationally ranked teams, including
Notre Dame, Wisconsin and North
western.
At Northwestern the team fought
for two long days against some of
the best of the midwestern and east
ern schools. Air Force and Long
Beach also attended that tourna
ment but didn't fence against Stan
ford.
"Air Force looks really good,"
said men's team captain Dave Russ
of the upcoming tourmanment.
"They are probably the team to
beat."
Air Force presents perhaps the
greatest challenge to the Cardinal
fencers. They did well at North
western and are a very strong team,
said men's coach Zoran Tulum.
Long Beach is less of a threat.
"Long Beach didn't do well at
Northwestern," Russ said.
The Cardinal has fenced only two
other teams from the western
region, UC-Santa Cruz and Cali
fornia.
The Stanford team is still rela
tively young. There arc some team
members for whom this weekend's

tournament will be their first col
legiate competition. Air Force, on
the other hand, has an experienced
team.
"Experience counts more than
anything else, especially in fencing,"
Rankin said.
An added difficulty will be that
only the Stanford team will have
been up late preparing new weap
ons that arrived just yesterday.
"It's not going to be a pushover,"
Rankfn said. But she said she is
confident that the Stanford team
will be able to top Air Force.
Rankin said that although there
is nothing special about the Air
Force squad, it remains a very well
conditioned and well trained team.
The men of Air Force have some
very good athletes, according to
Russ. The Stanford men's sabre
team will consist of Dave Russ,
Douglas Flinn and Jim Farrell. The
men's epee team will be Stephen
Schmidt, Joseph Elizondo, Peter
Duimstra and Richard Reader. The
men's foil will be Christopher Gil
len, Stan Brobston, Craig Ring and
Duncan Bell.
The women's foil team will be
Elizabeth Spillman, Laurel Mend,
Vanessa Southern, Grace Chang
and Olivia Judson.
Rankin will not be competing this
weekend due to a fractured ankle.
Her ankle will be in a cast for
another 10 days.
Rankin said she expects to return
to competition for the regionals in
March.
"Compared to last year we are
ahead of the game," Russ said.
