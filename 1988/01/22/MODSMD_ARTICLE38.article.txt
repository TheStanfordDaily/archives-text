# Women's gymnastics vaults to Cal Invite
## 
### Chris Kendrick Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team heads to Bear territory
tomorrow to compete in the
fornia Invitational against Califor
nia, Chico State and Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo.
Stanford Coach Homer Sardina
enters the tournament with a young
lineup, including two freshmen and
three sophomores. But the young
players are stabilized by two veteran
competitors, seniors Alison
McGann and Cindy Boyd.
This weekend's competition, only
the second meet of the season, will
give the younger gymnasts valuable
meet experience. "We're taking a
look at our younger players," Sar
dina said.
Freshman Christie Volastro, who
is participating in the all-around
competition, said she believes meet
experience will eliminate the teams
that hampered the Cardinal's per
formance last week in a loss against
Oregon State.
"By doing the routines and
making every routine, we won't get
as nervous," she said. "The more
meets we have, the more fun we
can have with it. Then we can get
more aggressive."
According to Sardina, consistency
is the key to Stanford's future. "Our
first responsibility is consistency,"
he said. "We need to hit 24 out of
24 routines. Our second responsi
bility is to do it as cleanly as pos
sible."
The Bears have yet to compete
this season, and also have several
freshmen on their roster. Because
of their youth and lack of meets
thus far, Sardina said he remains

unaware of their team strengths.
He predicted, however, that Stan
ford and Cal will probably vie for
first place at the meet.
"I think it will boil down to
Berkeley and ourselves for the team
title," Sardina said. "I'm not so con
cerned with competition as with
how we're going to perform."
Sardina and his gymnasts are
gunning for an event total between
44.5 and 45.2 points. That level of
scoring would give the Cardinal a
team score of 180 points, four points
higher than the team score against
Oregon State.
The Stanford coach is resting cer
tain gymnasts, including the injured
Dina Amoroso and Jennifer Bloom,
in a move to strengthen the team's
weaker events.
"We work through the events in
a cycle," Sardina said. "We gather
momentum and work toward our
peak performances."
With such a young team compet
ing in the invitational, the leader
ship roles will fall on the seniors,
McGann and Boyd. "I try to make
sure everyone is relaxed," McGann
said. "I go out and do my best and
encourage everybody else to do the
same."
McGann, who finished third in
the all-around competition last
week, is one of the dominant mem
bers of the squad and is expected
to be an important part of the
team's performance at Cal.
After a shaky performance in its
first meet last week, Stanford looks
to pull it all together tomorrow.
"The girls looked good in practice,"
Sardina said. "The first meet shook
us up and got us motivated. Now
they know it's the season."
