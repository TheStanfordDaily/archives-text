# Fire officials join Stanford safety probe
## 
### Erin Martin Bobby Schrader Senior staff writers 
Palo Alto Fire Chief Bob Wall told
reporters yesterday after a meeting of the
city's Hazardous Materials Coordinating
Council (HMCC) that the fire department
will be included in Stanford's probe of health
and safety conditions in University facilities.
According to Wall, the probe's findings
will be reported periodically to the depart
ment. In addition, firefighter l ! will be inter
viewed for their input on how to conduct
the investigation, he said.
Peter Millington, the University auditor
heading the investigation, confirmed that the
fire department will be included in the probe
but said the extent of its participation is still
unclear.
At the meeting, Stanford Health and Safety
Director Alain Decleve discussed the Uni
versity's controversial Environmental Safety
Facility and attempted to resolve community
concerns about a malfunctioning scrubber on
the facility's incinerator.
The scrubber — a safety device designed
to neutralize dangerous acids and other pol
lutants released during the incineration proc
ess — was found to be inoperative in Mav
1987.
Decleve refused to comment on questions
regarding Stanford's probe and the contents
of a Dec. 10 letter written by a University
health official that made allegations about
safety violations.
The letter, submitted to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, was written by health
and safety manager Jon Moldestad, who
resigned from his post last month.
Although the allegations of the letter
remain undisclosed, attention has been
focused on the incinerator, and area residents
are concerned that it is emitting toxic pol
lutants.
Wall, who demanded last Friday that his
department be included in the investigation,
said Decleve explained the function of the
scrubber "to [the fire department's] satisfac
tion."

The incinerator has continued to operate
without the scrubber under a variance
granted by the Bay Area Air Quality Man
agement District.
Decleve said the scrubber was installed as
an extra safety measure and is not required
in the type of incineration presently being
done at the facility.
According to Assoc. Director of Health
and Safety Douglas Brown, "the incinerator
itself is 99 percent destructive."
Brown explained that the variance was
granted because the scrubber is not needed
for the clean operation of the incinerator.
"In other words, the emissions coming out
(of the incinerator) have no environmental
or health impact," he said.
According to Brown, the Air Resources
Board is preparing a report on the in
cinerator's emissions that will be released
within the next two weeks.
Barron Park Association President and
HMCC member John Jovnt presented a series
of demands requesting that information re
garding the probe and the handling of hazar
dous materials be made public.
Joynt said he based his demands on the
federal "right-to-know" law, the Superfund
Amendments Reorganization Act, Title 111.
College Terrace Association President and
HMCC member Susan Covey added to
Joynt's list, demanding that the contents of
Moldestad's letter be released.
Joynt and other council members com
plained about the University's general un
willingness to communicate about safety pro
cedures related to the handling of toxic ma
terials.
"I feel like we're playing a catch-us-if-vou
can game," he said. "It has been difficult to
get any answers at all."
Decleve said earlier this week that the
University already has a two-fold agreement
concerning safety procedures with the fire
department. This includes notifying the de
partment immediately if there are any chemi
cal spills that have the potential of dangerous
releases in the environment, and to make
special hazards known to workers through
prominently posted signs.
