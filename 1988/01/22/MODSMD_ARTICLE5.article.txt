# Misunderstandings resolved
## Stanford-USSR exchange hits snag 
### Johnny Cuerva 
Soviet education officials got a
surprise here Wednesday evening
when they discovered that a Stan
ford student delegation heading to
a Siberian university in March
would not be all sciencc students
who speak fluent Russian.
Engaging in direct discussion for
the first time Wednesday, members
of the Stanford-Soviet Exchange
Project (SSEP) and a Soviet ad
vance team were surprised when
they realized each had different no
tions about an upcoming exchange

in which 14 Stanford students will
visit Novosibirsk State University
and Soviet students will visit Stan
ford.
Owing to miscommunication, the
Soviets thought the exchange would
strongly emphasize sciencc training,
whereas the Stanford group
believed the exchange would be
more broad-based and cultural in
nature.
After a negotiating session yes
terday afternoon, however, the
misunderstanding was cleared up
and a compromise deal was struck.
According to senior Jamie Dris

coll, a member of the Stanford del
egation, the Soviets had been under
the impression that Stanford was
solely a technical school and there
fore expected the Stanford delega
tion to be made up primarily of
science majors. The Soviet repre
sentatives also assumed their dele
gation would be spending the
majority of its stay in Stanford lab
oratories.
Ludmilla Subbotina, the repre
sentative from Novsibirsk Universi
ty, said through a translator that
the Soviet delegation would consist
of physics, chemistry and biology

majors. In contrast, the Stanford
delegation will be composed
primarily of students majoring in
the social sciences.
Subbotina expressed surprise at
the Stanford group's composition,
since she expected the Stanford del
egation to be technically oriented
and to speak fluent Russian.
While three of the Stanford del
egation are science majors and
three speak Russian, the group was
selected last spring for its diversity,
and Russian language proficiency
