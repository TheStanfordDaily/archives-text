# Misunderstandings resolved
## Stanford-USSR exchange hits snag 
### Johnny Cuerva 
Soviet education officials got a
surprise here Wednesday evening
when they discovered that a Stan
ford student delegation heading to
a Siberian university in March
would not be all sciencc students
who speak fluent Russian.
Engaging in direct discussion for
the first time Wednesday, members
of the Stanford-Soviet Exchange
Project (SSEP) and a Soviet ad
vance team were surprised when
they realized each had different no
tions about an upcoming exchange

in which 14 Stanford students will
visit Novosibirsk State University
and Soviet students will visit Stan
ford.
Owing to miscommunication, the
Soviets thought the exchange would
strongly emphasize sciencc training,
whereas the Stanford group
believed the exchange would be
more broad-based and cultural in
nature.
After a negotiating session yes
terday afternoon, however, the
misunderstanding was cleared up
and a compromise deal was struck.
According to senior Jamie Dris

coll, a member of the Stanford del
egation, the Soviets had been under
the impression that Stanford was
solely a technical school and there
fore expected the Stanford delega
tion to be made up primarily of
science majors. The Soviet repre
sentatives also assumed their dele
gation would be spending the
majority of its stay in Stanford lab
oratories.
Ludmilla Subbotina, the repre
sentative from Novsibirsk Universi
ty, said through a translator that
the Soviet delegation would consist
of physics, chemistry and biology

majors. In contrast, the Stanford
delegation will be composed
primarily of students majoring in
the social sciences.
Subbotina expressed surprise at
the Stanford group's composition,
since she expected the Stanford del
egation to be technically oriented
and to speak fluent Russian.
While three of the Stanford del
egation are science majors and
three speak Russian, the group was
selected last spring for its diversity,
and Russian language proficiency
was not required for participation
in the project.
Senior Kathy Healy, an SSEP
member, said this misunderstanding
was quickly cleared up yesterday
when the Stanford delegation sub
mitted a written statement to the
Soviets outlining the diverse activ
ities the Soviet students will exper
ience during their stay here. The
Stanford group also requested that
it be presented with a diverse
itinerary while in Novosibrisk.
The statement, drafted overnight
and modified shortly before yester
day's 2 p.m. negotiating session,
also stipulated that the Stanford
students be exposed to cultural and
social activities while in

Novosibirsk, in addition to scientific
activity. After the document was
translated and its meaning ex
plained, the Subbotina agreed to
the SSEP proposal, according to
Healy.
Sophomore Kim Grose, another
Stanford delegate, attributed the
misunderstanding to the fact that
the parties involved in the exchange
had not been in direct contact with
each other prior to this meeting.
Before Wednesday's meeting, the
two parties had been communica
ting through the Citizen's Exchange
Council, a New York-based non
profit organization that works to
promote citizen diplomacy between
the United States and the Soviet
Union.
Despite uncertainty after Wed
nesday night's meeting, noontime

press conference for the Soviet ad
vance team at the Bechtcl Interna
tional Center went smoothly.
Alexander Kovalyev, deputy
foreign minister of the Soviet Stu
dent Council, said that the ex
change program was the direct
result of the 1985 Geneva summit
between President Ronald Reagan
and General Secretary Mikhail
Gorbachev. At the summit, a spe
cial agreement was signed to
promote cultural exchange — in
cluding student exchange — be
tween the Unifted States and the
Soviet Union.
According to Kovalyev, the ex
change will promote "mutual un
derstanding on a grass roots level."
He said if the program goes well
the exchange program will be ex
panded to include other univer
sities.
