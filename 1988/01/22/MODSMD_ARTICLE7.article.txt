Israel adopts policy of force
JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
yesterday that a new army policy of using beatings and other forms
of physical force against Palestinian demonstrators had been ap
proved by the Israeli cabinet.
Speaking on the eve of the Moslem sabbath and expected new
disturbances in Jerusalem, Shamir said on a tour of the southern
district of Jerusalem that the new policy is one of self-defense and
"not a violent move." His remarks were quoted on Israel Radio.
Israel has come under widespread international criticism for its
use of gunfire to quell disturbances in the occupied territories in
recent weeks, during which dozens of Palestinians have been killed.
The State Department on yesterday criticized Israel's contention
that beating demonstrators is more humane than killing them,
saying, "We believe both are wrong."
Meanwhile, a senior military commander told Israeli journalists
that although the new methods have proved to be effective, he is
concerned about their long-term impact on the psychology of his
soldiers.
Israeli, U.N. and Palestinian sources have reported scores of
Arabs beaten by soldiers this week under a policy that the army
says is intended to cut down on the need to use live ammunition
against rock- and firebomb-throwing demonstrators.
Reagan revises SDI summit stance
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, responding to a secret
protest from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has dropped the approach
he took at the December summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev to bridge the long-standing U.S.-Soviet disagreement
over the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) research program and
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, U.S. officials said
yesterday.
Reagan Wednesday secretly approved instructions to U.S.
negotiators in Geneva telling them to demand Soviet acquiescence
to the disputed "broad interpretation" of the ABM Treaty that
would allow realistic testing in space of elements of SDI. Gorbachev
refused to accept any such formulation when he was in Washington.
Reagan's new instructions were a response to a recent letter
from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Adm. William Crowe Jr.,
to National Security Adviser Colin Powell. In that secret letter,
Crowe told Powell that the vague formula on SDI research agreed
to by Reagan and Gorbachev at the summit was unacceptable.
New poll shuffles deck in lowa
DES MOINES, lowa — With 17 davs before this state's critical
Democratic caucuses, a major reshuffling in the field has moved
Rep. Richard Gephardt, (D-Mo.)into a shaky lead and caused Sen.
Paul Simon (D-Ill.) to go abruptly on the attack.
Former Colorado senator Gary Hart, meanwhile, is rapidly losing
strength. Private polls taken for at least one campaign indicate that
Hart could finish as low as sixth in lowa among the seven Democratic
candidates.
An NBC-TV poll, taken Sunday to Tuesday, showed Gephardt
supported by 19 percent of those who say they are likely to attend
the lowa caucuses, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukalns by 18
percent, Simon by 15 percent, Hart by 14 percent, Jesse Jackson
by 8 percent, former Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt by 8 percent,
15 percent undecided. The opinions of 720 lowa Democrats were
polled.
A Los Angeles Times poll gave Gephardt 23 percent, Simon, 21;
Dukakis, 15; Hart, 12; Babbitt, 11, and Jackson, 8. Margins of
errors in the polls essentially mean there is a dead heat at the top.
Huge satellite in need of rescue
An 11-ton research satellite the size of a bus could plunge through
the atmosphere and send large chunks of debris crashing to the
Earth unless it is rescued by the space shuttle within the next year
or two, officials said yesterday.
"We do know there will be some fairly big chunks of metal that
will survive re-entry" if the satellite is not retrieved, said Robert
James Jr., chief of the projects division at NASA's Langley Research
Center in Virginia. James hopes to rescue the facility next year.
The $14 million satellite has no on-board propulsion or control
system, so if the time comes for it to tumble out of the sky,
engineers on the ground will have no control over it.
Research data collected by the satellite for the past four years
would be lost, and most of the debris would probably land in the
ocean.
The Long Duration Exposure Facility was launched from the
space shuttle Challenger in 1984 and was to have remained in orbit
for about a year, collecting data through 57 different experiments
about the effects of long-term exposure to space. The following
year, however, NASA delayed retrieval of the satellite because of
other pressing commitments for the space shuttle.
New drug reverses skin wrinkling
WASHINGTON — Fulfilling the ancient dream of preserving
youthful skin, scientists report that a relatively cheap drug used to
treat acne can reverse the aging and wrinkling of skin.
The treatment, using a topical cream called tretinoin, softened
rough skin, faded age spots and enriched the complexions of almost
every patient who tried it, according to a paper published in today's
issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.
"The article suggests that a new age has dawned," wrote Dr.
Barbara Gilchrest, of the Boston University School of Medicine,
in an accompanying editorial. "An enthusiastic reception for this
report is assured."
Dermatologists have for some time suspected that Retin-A, the
drug's trade name, helps erase wrinkles caused by the sun and
many have prescribed it for that purpose. But Friday's report is
the first to provide convincing scientific evidence for those claims.
"The effects were far more dramatic than anything I had an
ticipated," said Dr. John Vorhees, chairman of the dermatology
department at the University of Michigan Medical School, and the
chief investigator in the study. "Obviously, the implications are
pretty big."
The cosmetic industry long ago turned Ponce de Leon's dream
of attaining eternal youth into a billion-dollar industry. But while
generations of cosmetic adventurers have tried to reverse the aging
process, none has ever succeeded.
In the Voorhees study, 30 patients ranging in age from 35 to 70
rubbed Retin A on one forearm daily and a cream containing no
medication on the other. Half the subjects also tested the drug on
their faces. None of them knew which cream contained the drug.
Every patient showed significant reversal of skin damage caused
by the sun on the tretinoin-treated forearms but not on the others,
according to the report. In addition, all but one of the patients
who received tretinoin on their face showed improvement while
none of the others did.
