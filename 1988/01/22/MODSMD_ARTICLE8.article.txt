# Nicaragua proposes rights panel

### 
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica — The
Nicaraguan government yesterday
offered to establish an international
commission, including members of
the U.S. Republican and Demo
cratic parties, to monitor the polit
ical rights of contras who put down
their guns and join Nicaragua's in
ternal political opposition.
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs
Victor Hugo Tinoco said that the
Sandinistas also would not object
if the contras continue to receive
humanitarian aid from the United
States once a cease-fire has been
declared. He said that the aid must
be channeled through an organiza
tion such as the International Red
Cross.
Contra leader Alfredo Cesar
complained that the latest Sandi
nista proposal does not broaden or
guarantee political rights of the op
position. "They say the commission
can supervise our political rights,"
he said. "The question is, what are
our political rights? They are invit
ing us to join a club that doesn't
offer much."

But Cesar supported the idea of
a commission that would bring new
international political actors, such
as Christian Democrats, into the
Nicaraguan situation.
In Washington, the White House
had no comment, but an adminis
tration official, speaking on condi
tion of anonymity, said, "We have
to see what the terms of the cease
fire are and the manner in which
they are negotiated."
The contras, meanwhile, agreed
to begin the first direct cease-fire
negotiations on Jan. 28, as proposed
by the mediator, Nicaraguan Car
dinal Miguel Obando y Bravo. The
Sandinistas have already accepted
the date.
The six-member Contra direc
torate met for two hours yesterday
with Obando for the first time since
he became the mediator in the
Nicaraguan conflict. But the rebels
refused to sit down with the San
dinista cease-fire commission,
which arrived in Costa Rica unex
pectedly seeking to begin cease-fire
talks immediately.

Tinoco said the Sandinistas
wanted to begin the talks before
Cardinal Obando leaves Friday for
the Vatican. Contra leaders called
the move a publicity stunt.
"The Sandinistas know the direc
torate is not going to meet with a
delegation of this level, not unless
it is headed by (Nicaraguan Presi
dent Daniel) Ortega or a member
of the Sandinista directorate," said
Cesar, a member of the contra
directorate.
Obando said that the talks be
tween cease-fire commissions will
be held in San Jose and could run
for two days. He said that Msgrs.
Carlos Santi and Bosco Vivas will
mediate on his behalf.
Tinoco said that he had intended
to present the Sandinistas* proposal
to the contras, but he made the
announcements publicly instead
when the rebel leadership declined
to meet yesterday with the
Nicaraguan government delegation.
Reading from a prepared text,
Tinoco said that the measures are
aimed at "achieving a ccase-fire

with the contras and incorporating
them into the political life of the
country with irrevocable guarantees
that they will enjoy full political
rights and civil liberties."
The government proposed an
eight-member commission to guar
antee that the contras are allowed
to join political parties or organize
a new party and to participate fairly
in elections.
He said that the Sandinistas
would invite members of the fol
lowing groups to form the commis
sion: United Nations; Organization
of American States; the Contadora
Group of Latin American countries;
Christian Democrat International;
Liberal International; Socialist In
ternational; Republican Party; and
the Democratic Party.
Tinoco also said that the govern
ment would agree to the delivery
of U.S. humanitarian aid to the
contras during a cease-fire for a
period of time to be agreed upon
by both sides.
