# Hart unable to account for donations

WASHINGTON â€” Gary Hart's debt-ridden
1984 presidential campaign has failed to account
for almost $60,000 in apparently excessive and
possibly illegal campaign contributions, despite
repeated efforts by the Federal Election Com
mission to settle the accounts, according to FEC
computer records and documents.
FEC files also show that Hart's campaign
received $30,000 from two California fund
raisers the morning after Hart's second-place
finish in the 1984 lowa caucuses in sale and
leaseback transactions that are generally
prohibited by federal election law.
In addition, the records raise questions about
the Hart campaign's explanation of how a Cal
ifornia video producer, Stuart Karl, underwrote
thousands of dollars in campaign expenses in
July 1984 in apparent violation of the law.
A Washington Post computer analysis of FEC
records for Hart's 1984 race disclosed that
$59,745 in excessive contributions from 74 indi
viduals have neither been refunded nor other
wise cleared from the books.
Federal law prohibits individuals from contri
buting more than $1000 to a candidate in each

election. Campaigns routinely receive contribu
tions from individuals who have reached the
$1000 limit, the Post analysis disclosed.
Many of those excess contributions typically
are returned immediately by campaign staff
workers, said Fred Eiland, an FEC spokesman.
Others are deposited in campaign bank accounts,
but the excess amount is later refunded and the
refund reported to the FEC. Hart did return a
number of excess contributions from his 1984
campaign, which is still at least $1.1 million in
the red.
Documents obtained from the FEC show that,
beginning in March 1984, election officials
repeatedly asked the Hart campaign to explain
dozens of contributions made in apparent viola
tion of federal election laws.
"A sample review of your itemized receipts
.. . discloses a significant amount of apparent
excessive contributions," Benita Marcus Adler,
then an FEC senior reports analyst, wrote the
Hart campaign about its July 1984 contributions
report.
More than a year after the first FEC warning,
Hart's 1984 campaign treasurer Michael Moore

responded to the FEC by saying an internal
review of apparently excessive contributions was
under way.
"We are in the process of preparing a detailed
analysis of potentially over-limit contributions
noted by the (FEC) auditors during their
review," Moore wrote in a letter dated Aug. 7,
1985.
Moore also wrote that only $3023.50 in ex
cessive contributions had "not yet been fully
resolved, either by reattribution of the contri
bution to another person ... or by refund."
FEC officials said yesterday that they had no
record of the report promised by Moore, or of
any other committee filings that resolved the
challenged contributions.
Hart's 1988 campaign has been scrambling to
explain his finances since The Miami Herald
reported Wednesday that Stuart Karl had paid
some of the 1984 campaign expenses in apparent
violation of the law.
Reporters questioned Hart about the cam
paign finance issues at several campaign stops
in New Hampshire yesterday.
