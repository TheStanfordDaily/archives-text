$25,000 SCHOLARSHIPS:
THE FAST TRACK TO
SUCCESS.
Iwo-vear NROTC scholarships offer tuition and other financial benefits
worth as much as $25,000 to qualified college sophomores.
All these benefits are provided for one purpose: to educate and train
qualified young men and women to serve as commissioned officers in the
Navy.
The Navy pays for tuition, textbooks, instructional fees, and gives you
an allowance of $100 a month for up to 20 months during your last two years
of college. Upon graduation and completion of requirements, you'll become
an important part of the Navy adventure as a Navy officer.
Call your Navy representative for more information on this challenging
and rewarding program.
