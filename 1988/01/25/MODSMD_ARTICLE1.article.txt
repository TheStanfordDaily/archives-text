# The hidden threat: Date rape is all too common
## Inside 
### Joe Metcalfe Staff writer 
Although "Susan," a Stanford student,
had originally planned to spend the evening
with her boyfriend, a call from another friend
changed her mind. According to Susan,
"Jeff" said he really needed to talk to her
in person. It was too important to discuss
on the phone. Susan was dropped off at
the campus fraternity house where her friend
was a member, not expecting to stay long.
No one seemed to know where Jeff was,
but Susan was invited to play drinking games
while she waited. The alcohol flowed, and
soon she was dnink. The men began to
make overt sexual advances, first alone and
then as a crowd.
It was at this point that Susan knew she
was in trouble.
"I didn 7 know what was going on," she
says today. "I felt really out of control. All
of a sudden the situation was out of my

hands."
Finally, Susan remembers, Jeff entered
the crowded room wearing only a rubber
raincoat and told Susan about a sexual
fantasy he wanted to act out. She protested
but was ignored.
"He forced himself on me, and that started
a lot of guys. There was always at least one
guy, sometimes two. There were guys 1 didn't
know coming in and doing stuff to me, and
I didn't know what was going 0n.... They
were holding me. ... I would try to leave,
but they would pull me back d0wn...."
"I didn't have any control, (and) it didn't
matter if 1 agreed at that point. ... I passed
out after that."
The next day Susan called Jeff to confront
him with what had happened the previous
night.
"He said, 'You were drunk. You've been
here before, and it's your own problem. I
think you really need help if you think some
thing was wrong,' " she recalls.

The names have been changed, but this
is "Susan's" account of events that oc
curred at a Stanford fraternity in 1986.
The other stories of rape recounted in
this article were also reported to have
occurred at Stanford.
Unfortunately, similar reports of date
and gang rape on university campuses
across the country are all too common.
"Rape happens in all geographical
regions," said Teresa Rodriguez, a rape
crisis director at the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA in Palo Alto. "It is cross-cultural
and cross-economic. There isn't one group
that is safe."
Only recently have universities begun
to recognize the problem of rape on col
lege campuses. Some institutions such as
Stanford, acknowledging relatively early
what one writer has called "the hidden
epidemic," have initiated programs on
rape education, awareness and prevention.
Misconceptions about rape are com

mon. Most people fail to recognize the
fact that there are varying classifications
of rapes and rapists. Most instead assume
that all rapists are those most often read
about in the newspapers or reported on
television, ski-masked men with knives
who jump out from hushes or dark alleys.
Such stereotypes are usually false, es
pecially on college campuses. Indeed, it
is much more common in cases of rape
at universities for the survivor to know
her assailant.
He is often a remote acquaintance,
someone who lives down the hall or a
boyfriend.
Perhaps the most important and exten
sive work on the subject of rape on college
campuses was published in 1985. Funded
in part by the National Center for the
Prevention and Control of Rape, Kent
State Unvcrsity psychologist Mary Koss
surveyed more than 7000 university stu
dents from 35 institutions across the

country. The results were startling:
• One woman in eight had been raped in
the year previous to the survey, and 52
percent of all women surveyed had expe
rienced some form of sexual victimization
during their life. Koss defines rape as
engaging in intercourse against one's will.
• One in every 12 men had participated
in a rape or attempted rape.
• Of the women raped, 90 percent knew
their assailants, and almost half of the
rapes occurred on dates or during similar
situations.
• Fewer than 10 percent of the assaulted
women told the police about the rape.
"People think the only way you can be
raped is by strangers, and that's not true,"
Rodriguez said. "Eighty to 90 percent of
rapists are known to the victims, and they
have some sort of relationship, all the way
from acquaintances to spouses."
