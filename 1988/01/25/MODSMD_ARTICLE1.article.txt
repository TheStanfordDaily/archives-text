# The 						hidden threat: Date rape is all too common
## Inside 
### Joe Metcalfe Staff writer 
Although "Susan," a Stanford student,
had originally planned to spend the evening
with her boyfriend, a call from another friend
changed her mind. According to Susan,
"Jeff" said he really needed to talk to her
in person. It was too important to discuss
on the phone. Susan was dropped off at
the campus fraternity house where her friend
was a member, not expecting to stay long.
No one seemed to know where Jeff was,
but Susan was invited to play drinking games
while she waited. The alcohol flowed, and
soon she was dnink. The men began to
make overt sexual advances, first alone and
then as a crowd.
It was at this point that Susan knew she
was in trouble.
"I didn 7 know what was going on," she
says today. "I felt really out of control. All
of a sudden the situation was out of my

hands."
Finally, Susan remembers, Jeff entered
the crowded room wearing only a rubber
raincoat and told Susan about a sexual
fantasy he wanted to act out. She protested
but was ignored.
"He forced himself on me, and that started
a lot of guys. There was always at least one
guy, sometimes two. There were guys 1 didn't
know coming in and doing stuff to me, and
I didn't know what was going 0n.... They
were holding me. ... I would try to leave,
but they would pull me back d0wn...."
"I didn't have any control, (and) it didn't
matter if 1 agreed at that point. ... I passed
out after that."
The next day Susan called Jeff to confront
him with what had happened the previous
night.
"He said, 'You were drunk. You've been
here before, and it's your own problem. I
think you really need help if you think some
thing was wrong,' " she recalls.

The names have been changed, but this
is "Susan's" account of events that oc
curred at a Stanford fraternity in 1986.
The other stories of rape recounted in
this article were also reported to have
occurred at Stanford.
Unfortunately, similar reports of date
and gang rape on university campuses
across the country are all too common.
"Rape happens in all geographical
regions," said Teresa Rodriguez, a rape
crisis director at the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA in Palo Alto. "It is cross-cultural
and cross-economic. There isn't one group
that is safe."
Only recently have universities begun
to recognize the problem of rape on col
lege campuses. Some institutions such as
Stanford, acknowledging relatively early
what one writer has called "the hidden
epidemic," have initiated programs on
rape education, awareness and prevention.
Misconceptions about rape are com

mon. Most people fail to recognize the
fact that there are varying classifications
of rapes and rapists. Most instead assume
that all rapists are those most often read
about in the newspapers or reported on
television, ski-masked men with knives
who jump out from hushes or dark alleys.
Such stereotypes are usually false, es
pecially on college campuses. Indeed, it
is much more common in cases of rape
at universities for the survivor to know
her assailant.
He is often a remote acquaintance,
someone who lives down the hall or a
boyfriend.
Perhaps the most important and exten
sive work on the subject of rape on college
campuses was published in 1985. Funded
in part by the National Center for the
Prevention and Control of Rape, Kent
State Unvcrsity psychologist Mary Koss
surveyed more than 7000 university stu
dents from 35 institutions across the

country. The results were startling:
• One woman in eight had been raped in
the year previous to the survey, and 52
percent of all women surveyed had expe
rienced some form of sexual victimization
during their life. Koss defines rape as
engaging in intercourse against one's will.
• One in every 12 men had participated
in a rape or attempted rape.
• Of the women raped, 90 percent knew
their assailants, and almost half of the
rapes occurred on dates or during similar
situations.
• Fewer than 10 percent of the assaulted
women told the police about the rape.
"People think the only way you can be
raped is by strangers, and that's not true,"
Rodriguez said. "Eighty to 90 percent of
rapists are known to the victims, and they
have some sort of relationship, all the way
from acquaintances to spouses."
Most rape counselors agree that
one important reason this and other
stereotypes about rape persist is
that a large percentage of rape vic
tims never report the assault.
Susan didn't report the rape. When
she returned home the next day, her
boyfriend was waiting for her. She
told him what had happened but
didn't go to the police.
"I thought it was my own fault,"
she says."I didn't know what to do."
Rape is recognized to be the most
underreported of all crimes, and
cases involving date and gang rape
are even less frequently reported.
Underreporting of rapes at univer
sities is so widespread, Koss con
cluded, that at least 10 times more
rapes occur among college students
than are reflected in official crime
statistics.
There are many reasons for this.
Pressing charges is a complex proc
ess, often traumatic for the rape
victim, and only rarely are rapes
successfully prosecuted.
According to Nadine O'Leary, as
sistant to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, there has been no
case of date or gang rape reported
to the Judicial Affairs Office for at
least 40 years.
The last reported sexual assault
at Stanford occurred in December
1986, according to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
Victims of date or gang rape
rarely come forward, Herrington
said.
"In our society, the victim may

either feel embarrassed or guilty,
(and) there's a sense of hopeless
ness about what might happen (if
the crime is reported)," said Laurie
Wedemeyer, a community educator
at the Mid-Peninsula YWCA.
"There is more self-blame (in
cases of date or gang rape), and
the whole trust issue is much more
prominent than with (anonymous)
rape," Wedemeyer said. Feelings of
shame, guilt and lowered self
esteem are often stronger in such
cases, she added.

'Men should start
talking about date
rape and find out
why it occurs be
cause the people af
fected by rape are
their female friends,
their sisters and
their daughters. 1

"If it's your boyfriend that raped
you, there's an issue of trust or
loyalty that comes into play, a fear
about being believed or (a fear of)
being blamed for what happened,"
Rodriguez said.
According to Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano, another reason
why women often do not report

rape is that many do not understand
what is and what is not rape. He
noted that such confusion helps ex
plain why, when answering rape sur
veys, women answer "no" to the
question, "Have you ever been
raped?" but "yes" when asked if
they had ever been forced to have
sex by an acquaintance.
Indeed, Koss' study reported that
of the women who were raped,
three out of four did not identify
their experience as rape. In the
eyes of many women, rape, if com
mitted by an acquaintance or friend,
seems not to be rape at all.
Stereotypes about traditional sex
roles are often cited by psy
chologists and rape experts as one
of the principal causes of rape.
According to Susan Chicos, com
munity educator at the Mid-
Peninsula Support Network for Bat
tered Women, "Stereotypes persist,
stereotypes from movies, books and
television that [instruct men on] the
macho way to be."
These stereotypes, Chicos said,
foster certain ways of thinking and
the development of specific sex
roles that may encourage sexual ag
gression against women.
Perhaps more importantly, a
belief that the male is the exclusive
sexual initiator and aggressor, while
the female is the weak and passive
receptor, shapes the behavior of
rape victims and leads many to view
themselves not as a victim, but as
an accomplice.
Although date and gang rape
share certain similarities with
anonymous rape, there are differ
ences.
Domination of women is a salient

characteristic of stranger rape,
which is typically a show of power
through sex. Acquaintance rape, on
the other hand, involves power or
physical coercion, but usually to ob
tain sex.
"Most anonymous rapists are
really hate-filled and violent toward
women," explained Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Patricia Polhemus.
"More date rapists are not hate
filled, but they feel they are entitled
to sex."
Assoc. Director of Residential
Education Alice Supton added that
date rapists "feel they're entitled
to what they want and they are
going to get it, riding roughshod
over a woman's feelings."
But, according to Melinda
Hodell, a graduate student in psy
chology and instructor of the course
"Psychology of Women and Vio
lence," control over women is still
an issue in date rape.
"In a culture that doesn't have
the issues of power and domination
over women, I don't think we would
have date rape," she said.
When "Julie" saw her friend
"Debbie" at a fraternity party, she
knew Debbie was in trouble.
Almost unconscious from excessive
drinking, Debbie could barely walk
and spoke incoherently. As Julie re
members it, four or five members of
the fraternity were virtually carrying
Debbie upstairs to a bedroom. Julie,
with the aid of a friend, stopped them
and carried Debbie back to her fresh
man dorm in Stern.
The following day, a member of
the fraternity told Julie that the guys
in the house were mad at her.

"They said you took their fun
away," he said.
Alcohol can be a primary con
tributor to the problem of rape.
This is perhaps more likely on a
university campus than in society
at large because alcohol is the focus
of so many social events.
"Alcohol helps reduce inhibitions
and is an excuse sometimes for not
taking responsiblity," Supton said.

'If it's your
boyfriend that
raped you, there's
an issue of trust or
loyalty that comes
into play, a fear
about being
believed or being
blamed for what
happened.'

"When alcohol has been used in
excess, it skews people's judgment,"
added Vinny Frost, president of the
Inter-Fraternity Council and of the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity.
"The natural agrcssiveness of
men (who might be prone to rape)
is enhanced with drinking," Chicos
said.
According to Frost, the question

of alcohol involves the fraternities
at Stanford since "alcohol is a larger
part of the social environment
(within the fraternity system) than
outside."
Fraternities, however, cannot be
assumed to be singularly responsi
ble for such incidents. Alcohol is
also served at dorm parties, and
harmful stereotypes about women
are by no means limited to members
of the Greek system.
But few deny that factors more
prevalent in fraternities have played
an important role in date and gang
rape incidents.
Sexist behavior toward women is
often cited as a prominent charac
teristic of some fraternities at many
universities. Criticism leveled at fra
ternities often is focused on hostile
attitudes toward women that are
fostered in a fraternity environment
— an environment in which contact
with women is limited to classes
and social situations.
Kappa Alpha President Charles
Moody said that fraternity members
"need to be conscious of attitudes
promulgated by its members."
"When you don't live with
women," Pisano said, "you are iso
lated in a way, and it is easier to
objectify people you don't have con
tact with."
"In an all-male environment, cer
tain attitidues toward women as a
group can be expressed that just
are not expressed when individually
men arc talking about women,"
Supton said.
Pisano added that he believes
that in situations when rape is being
committed, there may be "less of
an inclination to call your (frate
rnal) brother on that kind of be
havior."
But John Brooke, president of
the Theta Xi fraternity, cautioned
that fraternities differ significantly
from one another and care must
be exercised when talking about the
Greek system as a whole in relation
to issues such as date or gang rape.
"There are 11 (housed) fraterni
ties, and if one house has a problem
(with rape), that doesn't necessarily
mean that all fraternities have a
problem," Brooke said.
"Kim" went to a fraternity party
that evening with a friend. Although
she only had a few drinks, their al
cohol content was high and soon
took its effect. She walked home and
quickly fell asleep.
Sometime later that night, Kim
recalls, she awoke to find someone

in her room whom she didn7 imme
diately recognize. He raped her and
then dragged her into an outer room.
At this point, Kim realized that her
assailant was a member of the fra
ternity she had left earlier in the eve
rung'
"He threw me in the hammock
and raped me again," Kim said. "He
then took a shower, got dressed and
left."
According to Polhcmus, steps can
be taken to reduce the risk of rape.
"Just trying to defend yourself
greatly increases your chances of
avoiding rape," she said. "If we
make victims totally victims, then
women will be totally vulnerable
forever. Things can be done."
One way to increase awareness
is through educational programs
such as those sponsored by the
Rape Education Project. Such
residence-based discussion groups,
however, are not panaceas, Supton
said. "Increasing the level of aware
ness has not (in the past) had a
total impact on behavior," she cau
tioned.

"It seems that unfortunately a lot
of the men who go to rape educa
tion workshops are already ed
ucated and are already aware of
the problem," Wcdemeycr noted.
Getting men involved in the dis
cussions is vital, Hodell said.
"Men who believe date and gang
rape are wrong need to tell other
men so that the valuing" comes
from their peers, Hodell argued.
"A lot of men think date rape is
wrong," she said. "Men should start
talking about date rape and find
out why it occurs, because the
people affected by rape are their
female friends, their sisters and
their daughters."
But better personal communica
tion may be an additional important
first step in solving this problem.
"Part of it is a language problem,"
Pisano said. "It's hard for people
to talk about sex. . . . [When]
people have the idea that 'no*
means 'yes,' sex becomes some sort
of elaborate mating ritual."
"If we don't talk about sex, then
what's going on in one mind may
not be the same as what's going on

in the other person's mind," Supton
said.
Although discussion groups may
be enough to alter certain in
dividuals' behavior, some experts
argue that the beliefs that make
rape a reality are so deep-rooted
that they are not likely to change
after a short discussion on rape.
"Until we have a wonderful world
(without rape), the ball is in the
female's court to protect herself,"
she said.
One option is to enroll in the
Stanford Workshops on Social and
Political Issues (SWOPSI) course,
"Issues in Self-Defense for Wom
en." Such classes, said Sarah Bryer,
a member of the Women's Center
and the Rape Education Project,
teach students more than physical
self-defense.
"They taught me not only how
to defend myself but how to be
self-assertive — that it's okay to be
rude sometimes," Bryer said.
"Everyone is vulnerable to rape
at one point or another," Rodriguez
said, "and Stanford is no exception
to that.'
Although "Susan," a Stanford student,
had originally planned to spend the evening
with her boyfriend, a call from another friend
changed her mind. According to Susan,
"Jeff" said he really needed to talk to her

Political Issues (SWOPSI) course,
"Issues in Self-Defense for Wom
en." Such classes, said Sarah Bryer,
a member of the Women's Center
and the Rape Education Project,
teach students more than physical
self-defense.
"They taught me not only how
to defend myself but how to be
self-assertive — that it's okay to be
rude sometimes," Bryer said.
"Everyone is vulnerable to rape
at one point or another," Rodriguez
said, "and Stanford is no exception
to that.'
Although "Susan," a Stanford student,
had originally planned to spend the evening
with her boyfriend, a call from another friend
changed her mind. According to Susan,
"Jeff" said he really needed to talk to her
in person. It was too important to discuss
on the phone. Susan was dropped off at
the campus fraternity house where her friend
was a member, not expecting to stay long.
No one seemed to know where Jeff was,
but Susan was invited to play drinking games
while she waited. The alcohol flowed, and
soon she was dnink. The men began to
make overt sexual advances, first alone and
then as a crowd.
It was at this point that Susan knew she
was in trouble.
"I didn 7 know what was going on," she
says today. "I felt really out of control. All
of a sudden the situation was out of my

hands."
Finally, Susan remembers, Jeff entered
the crowded room wearing only a rubber
raincoat and told Susan about a sexual
fantasy he wanted to act out. She protested
but was ignored.
"He forced himself on me, and that started
a lot of guys. There was always at least one
guy, sometimes two. There were guys 1 didn't
know coming in and doing stuff to me, and
I didn't know what was going 0n.... They
were holding me. ... I would try to leave,
but they would pull me back d0wn...."
"I didn't have any control, (and) it didn't
matter if 1 agreed at that point. ... I passed
out after that."
The next day Susan called Jeff to confront
him with what had happened the previous
night.
"He said, 'You were drunk. You've been
here before, and it's your own problem. I
think you really need help if you think some
thing was wrong,' " she recalls.

The names have been changed, but this
is "Susan's" account of events that oc
curred at a Stanford fraternity in 1986.
The other stories of rape recounted in
this article were also reported to have
occurred at Stanford.
Unfortunately, similar reports of date
and gang rape on university campuses
across the country are all too common.
"Rape happens in all geographical
regions," said Teresa Rodriguez, a rape
crisis director at the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA in Palo Alto. "It is cross-cultural
and cross-economic. There isn't one group
that is safe."
Only recently have universities begun
to recognize the problem of rape on col
lege campuses. Some institutions such as
Stanford, acknowledging relatively early
what one writer has called "the hidden
epidemic," have initiated programs on
rape education, awareness and prevention.
Misconceptions about rape are com

mon. Most people fail to recognize the
fact that there are varying classifications
of rapes and rapists. Most instead assume
that all rapists are those most often read
about in the newspapers or reported on
television, ski-masked men with knives
who jump out from hushes or dark alleys.
Such stereotypes are usually false, es
pecially on college campuses. Indeed, it
is much more common in cases of rape
at universities for the survivor to know
her assailant.
He is often a remote acquaintance,
someone who lives down the hall or a
boyfriend.
Perhaps the most important and exten
sive work on the subject of rape on college
campuses was published in 1985. Funded
in part by the National Center for the
Prevention and Control of Rape, Kent
State Unvcrsity psychologist Mary Koss
surveyed more than 7000 university stu
dents from 35 institutions across the

country. The results were startling:
• One woman in eight had been raped in
the year previous to the survey, and 52
percent of all women surveyed had expe
rienced some form of sexual victimization
during their life. Koss defines rape as
engaging in intercourse against one's will.
• One in every 12 men had participated
in a rape or attempted rape.
• Of the women raped, 90 percent knew
their assailants, and almost half of the
rapes occurred on dates or during similar
situations.
• Fewer than 10 percent of the assaulted
women told the police about the rape.
"People think the only way you can be
raped is by strangers, and that's not true,"
Rodriguez said. "Eighty to 90 percent of
rapists are known to the victims, and they
have some sort of relationship, all the way
from acquaintances to spouses."
Most rape counselors agree that
one important reason this and other
stereotypes about rape persist is
that a large percentage of rape vic
tims never report the assault.
Susan didn't report the rape. When
she returned home the next day, her
boyfriend was waiting for her. She
told him what had happened but
didn't go to the police.
"I thought it was my own fault,"
she says."I didn't know what to do."
Rape is recognized to be the most
underreported of all crimes, and
cases involving date and gang rape
are even less frequently reported.
Underreporting of rapes at univer
sities is so widespread, Koss con
cluded, that at least 10 times more
rapes occur among college students
than are reflected in official crime
statistics.
There are many reasons for this.
Pressing charges is a complex proc
ess, often traumatic for the rape
victim, and only rarely are rapes
successfully prosecuted.
According to Nadine O'Leary, as
sistant to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, there has been no
case of date or gang rape reported
to the Judicial Affairs Office for at
least 40 years.
The last reported sexual assault
at Stanford occurred in December
1986, according to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
Victims of date or gang rape
rarely come forward, Herrington
said.
"In our society, the victim may

either feel embarrassed or guilty,
(and) there's a sense of hopeless
ness about what might happen (if
the crime is reported)," said Laurie
Wedemeyer, a community educator
at the Mid-Peninsula YWCA.
"There is more self-blame (in
cases of date or gang rape), and
the whole trust issue is much more
prominent than with (anonymous)
rape," Wedemeyer said. Feelings of
shame, guilt and lowered self
esteem are often stronger in such
cases, she added.

'Men should start
talking about date
rape and find out
why it occurs be
cause the people af
fected by rape are
their female friends,
their sisters and
their daughters. 1

"If it's your boyfriend that raped
you, there's an issue of trust or
loyalty that comes into play, a fear
about being believed or (a fear of)
being blamed for what happened,"
Rodriguez said.
According to Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano, another reason
why women often do not report

rape is that many do not understand
what is and what is not rape. He
noted that such confusion helps ex
plain why, when answering rape sur
veys, women answer "no" to the
question, "Have you ever been
raped?" but "yes" when asked if
they had ever been forced to have
sex by an acquaintance.
Indeed, Koss' study reported that
of the women who were raped,
three out of four did not identify
their experience as rape. In the
eyes of many women, rape, if com
mitted by an acquaintance or friend,
seems not to be rape at all.
Stereotypes about traditional sex
roles are often cited by psy
chologists and rape experts as one
of the principal causes of rape.
According to Susan Chicos, com
munity educator at the Mid-
Peninsula Support Network for Bat
tered Women, "Stereotypes persist,
stereotypes from movies, books and
television that [instruct men on] the
macho way to be."
These stereotypes, Chicos said,
foster certain ways of thinking and
the development of specific sex
roles that may encourage sexual ag
gression against women.
Perhaps more importantly, a
belief that the male is the exclusive
sexual initiator and aggressor, while
the female is the weak and passive
receptor, shapes the behavior of
rape victims and leads many to view
themselves not as a victim, but as
an accomplice.
Although date and gang rape
share certain similarities with
anonymous rape, there are differ
ences.
Domination of women is a salient

characteristic of stranger rape,
which is typically a show of power
through sex. Acquaintance rape, on
the other hand, involves power or
physical coercion, but usually to ob
tain sex.
"Most anonymous rapists are
really hate-filled and violent toward
women," explained Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Patricia Polhemus.
"More date rapists are not hate
filled, but they feel they are entitled
to sex."
Assoc. Director of Residential
Education Alice Supton added that
date rapists "feel they're entitled
to what they want and they are
going to get it, riding roughshod
over a woman's feelings."
But, according to Melinda
Hodell, a graduate student in psy
chology and instructor of the course
"Psychology of Women and Vio
lence," control over women is still
an issue in date rape.
"In a culture that doesn't have
the issues of power and domination
over women, I don't think we would
have date rape," she said.
When "Julie" saw her friend
"Debbie" at a fraternity party, she
knew Debbie was in trouble.
Almost unconscious from excessive
drinking, Debbie could barely walk
and spoke incoherently. As Julie re
members it, four or five members of
the fraternity were virtually carrying
Debbie upstairs to a bedroom. Julie,
with the aid of a friend, stopped them
and carried Debbie back to her fresh
man dorm in Stern.
The following day, a member of
the fraternity told Julie that the guys
in the house were mad at her.

"They said you took their fun
away," he said.
Alcohol can be a primary con
tributor to the problem of rape.
This is perhaps more likely on a
university campus than in society
at large because alcohol is the focus
of so many social events.
"Alcohol helps reduce inhibitions
and is an excuse sometimes for not
taking responsiblity," Supton said.

'If it's your
boyfriend that
raped you, there's
an issue of trust or
loyalty that comes
into play, a fear
about being
believed or being
blamed for what
happened.'

"When alcohol has been used in
excess, it skews people's judgment,"
added Vinny Frost, president of the
Inter-Fraternity Council and of the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity.
"The natural agrcssiveness of
men (who might be prone to rape)
is enhanced with drinking," Chicos
said.
According to Frost, the question

of alcohol involves the fraternities
at Stanford since "alcohol is a larger
part of the social environment
(within the fraternity system) than
outside."
Fraternities, however, cannot be
assumed to be singularly responsi
ble for such incidents. Alcohol is
also served at dorm parties, and
harmful stereotypes about women
are by no means limited to members
of the Greek system.
But few deny that factors more
prevalent in fraternities have played
an important role in date and gang
rape incidents.
Sexist behavior toward women is
often cited as a prominent charac
teristic of some fraternities at many
universities. Criticism leveled at fra
ternities often is focused on hostile
attitudes toward women that are
fostered in a fraternity environment
— an environment in which contact
with women is limited to classes
and social situations.
Kappa Alpha President Charles
Moody said that fraternity members
"need to be conscious of attitudes
promulgated by its members."
"When you don't live with
women," Pisano said, "you are iso
lated in a way, and it is easier to
objectify people you don't have con
tact with."
"In an all-male environment, cer
tain attitidues toward women as a
group can be expressed that just
are not expressed when individually
men arc talking about women,"
Supton said.
Pisano added that he believes
that in situations when rape is being
committed, there may be "less of
an inclination to call your (frate
rnal) brother on that kind of be
havior."
But John Brooke, president of
the Theta Xi fraternity, cautioned
that fraternities differ significantly
from one another and care must
be exercised when talking about the
Greek system as a whole in relation
to issues such as date or gang rape.
"There are 11 (housed) fraterni
ties, and if one house has a problem
(with rape), that doesn't necessarily
mean that all fraternities have a
problem," Brooke said.
"Kim" went to a fraternity party
that evening with a friend. Although
she only had a few drinks, their al
cohol content was high and soon
took its effect. She walked home and
quickly fell asleep.
Sometime later that night, Kim
recalls, she awoke to find someone

in her room whom she didn7 imme
diately recognize. He raped her and
then dragged her into an outer room.
At this point, Kim realized that her
assailant was a member of the fra
ternity she had left earlier in the eve
rung'
"He threw me in the hammock
and raped me again," Kim said. "He
then took a shower, got dressed and
left."
According to Polhcmus, steps can
be taken to reduce the risk of rape.
"Just trying to defend yourself
greatly increases your chances of
avoiding rape," she said. "If we
make victims totally victims, then
women will be totally vulnerable
forever. Things can be done."
One way to increase awareness
is through educational programs
such as those sponsored by the
Rape Education Project. Such
residence-based discussion groups,
however, are not panaceas, Supton
said. "Increasing the level of aware
ness has not (in the past) had a
total impact on behavior," she cau
tioned.

"It seems that unfortunately a lot
of the men who go to rape educa
tion workshops are already ed
ucated and are already aware of
the problem," Wcdemeycr noted.
Getting men involved in the dis
cussions is vital, Hodell said.
"Men who believe date and gang
rape are wrong need to tell other
men so that the valuing" comes
from their peers, Hodell argued.
"A lot of men think date rape is
wrong," she said. "Men should start
talking about date rape and find
out why it occurs, because the
people affected by rape are their
female friends, their sisters and
their daughters."
But better personal communica
tion may be an additional important
first step in solving this problem.
"Part of it is a language problem,"
Pisano said. "It's hard for people
to talk about sex. . . . [When]
people have the idea that 'no*
means 'yes,' sex becomes some sort
of elaborate mating ritual."
"If we don't talk about sex, then
what's going on in one mind may
not be the same as what's going on

in the other person's mind," Supton
said.
Although discussion groups may
be enough to alter certain in
dividuals' behavior, some experts
argue that the beliefs that make
rape a reality are so deep-rooted
that they are not likely to change
after a short discussion on rape.
"Until we have a wonderful world
(without rape), the ball is in the
female's court to protect herself,"
she said.
One option is to enroll in the
Stanford Workshops on Social and
Political Issues (SWOPSI) course,
"Issues in Self-Defense for Wom
en." Such classes, said Sarah Bryer,
a member of the Women's Center
and the Rape Education Project,
teach students more than physical
self-defense.
"They taught me not only how
to defend myself but how to be
self-assertive — that it's okay to be
rude sometimes," Bryer said.

said, "and Stanford is no exception

in the other person's mind," Supton
said.
Although discussion groups may
be enough to alter certain in
dividuals' behavior, some experts
argue that the beliefs that make
rape a reality are so deep-rooted
that they are not likely to change
after a short discussion on rape.
"Until we have a wonderful world
(without rape), the ball is in the
female's court to protect herself,"
she said.
One option is to enroll in the
Stanford Workshops on Social and
Political Issues (SWOPSI) course,
"Issues in Self-Defense for Wom
en." Such classes, said Sarah Bryer,
a member of the Women's Center
and the Rape Education Project,
teach students more than physical
self-defense.
"They taught me not only how
to defend myself but how to be
self-assertive — that it's okay to be
rude sometimes," Bryer said.
"Everyone is vulnerable to rape
at one point or another," Rodriguez
said, "and Stanford is no exception
to that.'
Although "Susan," a Stanford student,
had originally planned to spend the evening
with her boyfriend, a call from another friend
changed her mind. According to Susan,
"Jeff" said he really needed to talk to her
in person. It was too important to discuss
on the phone. Susan was dropped off at
the campus fraternity house where her friend
was a member, not expecting to stay long.
No one seemed to know where Jeff was,
but Susan was invited to play drinking games
while she waited. The alcohol flowed, and
soon she was dnink. The men began to
make overt sexual advances, first alone and
then as a crowd.
It was at this point that Susan knew she
was in trouble.
"I didn 7 know what was going on," she
says today. "I felt really out of control. All
of a sudden the situation was out of my

hands."
Finally, Susan remembers, Jeff entered
the crowded room wearing only a rubber
raincoat and told Susan about a sexual
fantasy he wanted to act out. She protested
but was ignored.
"He forced himself on me, and that started
a lot of guys. There was always at least one
guy, sometimes two. There were guys 1 didn't
know coming in and doing stuff to me, and
I didn't know what was going 0n.... They
were holding me. ... I would try to leave,
but they would pull me back d0wn...."
"I didn't have any control, (and) it didn't
matter if 1 agreed at that point. ... I passed
out after that."
The next day Susan called Jeff to confront
him with what had happened the previous
night.
"He said, 'You were drunk. You've been
here before, and it's your own problem. I
think you really need help if you think some
thing was wrong,' " she recalls.

The names have been changed, but this
is "Susan's" account of events that oc
curred at a Stanford fraternity in 1986.
The other stories of rape recounted in
this article were also reported to have
occurred at Stanford.
Unfortunately, similar reports of date
and gang rape on university campuses
across the country are all too common.
"Rape happens in all geographical
regions," said Teresa Rodriguez, a rape
crisis director at the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA in Palo Alto. "It is cross-cultural
and cross-economic. There isn't one group
that is safe."
Only recently have universities begun
to recognize the problem of rape on col
lege campuses. Some institutions such as
Stanford, acknowledging relatively early
what one writer has called "the hidden
epidemic," have initiated programs on
rape education, awareness and prevention.
Misconceptions about rape are com

mon. Most people fail to recognize the
fact that there are varying classifications
of rapes and rapists. Most instead assume
that all rapists are those most often read
about in the newspapers or reported on
television, ski-masked men with knives
who jump out from hushes or dark alleys.
Such stereotypes are usually false, es
pecially on college campuses. Indeed, it
is much more common in cases of rape
at universities for the survivor to know
her assailant.
He is often a remote acquaintance,
someone who lives down the hall or a
boyfriend.
Perhaps the most important and exten
sive work on the subject of rape on college
campuses was published in 1985. Funded
in part by the National Center for the
Prevention and Control of Rape, Kent
State Unvcrsity psychologist Mary Koss
surveyed more than 7000 university stu
dents from 35 institutions across the

country. The results were startling:
• One woman in eight had been raped in
the year previous to the survey, and 52
percent of all women surveyed had expe
rienced some form of sexual victimization
during their life. Koss defines rape as
engaging in intercourse against one's will.
• One in every 12 men had participated
in a rape or attempted rape.
• Of the women raped, 90 percent knew
their assailants, and almost half of the
rapes occurred on dates or during similar
situations.
• Fewer than 10 percent of the assaulted
women told the police about the rape.
"People think the only way you can be
raped is by strangers, and that's not true,"
Rodriguez said. "Eighty to 90 percent of
rapists are known to the victims, and they
have some sort of relationship, all the way
from acquaintances to spouses."
Most rape counselors agree that
one important reason this and other
stereotypes about rape persist is
that a large percentage of rape vic
tims never report the assault.
Susan didn't report the rape. When
she returned home the next day, her
boyfriend was waiting for her. She
told him what had happened but
didn't go to the police.
"I thought it was my own fault,"
she says."I didn't know what to do."
Rape is recognized to be the most
underreported of all crimes, and
cases involving date and gang rape
are even less frequently reported.
Underreporting of rapes at univer
sities is so widespread, Koss con
cluded, that at least 10 times more
rapes occur among college students
than are reflected in official crime
statistics.
There are many reasons for this.
Pressing charges is a complex proc
ess, often traumatic for the rape
victim, and only rarely are rapes
successfully prosecuted.
According to Nadine O'Leary, as
sistant to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, there has been no
case of date or gang rape reported
to the Judicial Affairs Office for at
least 40 years.
The last reported sexual assault
at Stanford occurred in December
1986, according to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
Victims of date or gang rape
rarely come forward, Herrington
said.
"In our society, the victim may

either feel embarrassed or guilty,
(and) there's a sense of hopeless
ness about what might happen (if
the crime is reported)," said Laurie
Wedemeyer, a community educator
at the Mid-Peninsula YWCA.
"There is more self-blame (in
cases of date or gang rape), and
the whole trust issue is much more
prominent than with (anonymous)
rape," Wedemeyer said. Feelings of
shame, guilt and lowered self
esteem are often stronger in such
cases, she added.

'Men should start
talking about date
rape and find out
why it occurs be
cause the people af
fected by rape are
their female friends,
their sisters and
their daughters. 1

"If it's your boyfriend that raped
you, there's an issue of trust or
loyalty that comes into play, a fear
about being believed or (a fear of)
being blamed for what happened,"
Rodriguez said.
According to Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano, another reason
why women often do not report

rape is that many do not understand
what is and what is not rape. He
noted that such confusion helps ex
plain why, when answering rape sur
veys, women answer "no" to the
question, "Have you ever been
raped?" but "yes" when asked if
they had ever been forced to have
sex by an acquaintance.
Indeed, Koss' study reported that
of the women who were raped,
three out of four did not identify
their experience as rape. In the
eyes of many women, rape, if com
mitted by an acquaintance or friend,
seems not to be rape at all.
Stereotypes about traditional sex
roles are often cited by psy
chologists and rape experts as one
of the principal causes of rape.
According to Susan Chicos, com
munity educator at the Mid-
Peninsula Support Network for Bat
tered Women, "Stereotypes persist,
stereotypes from movies, books and
television that [instruct men on] the
macho way to be."
These stereotypes, Chicos said,
foster certain ways of thinking and
the development of specific sex
roles that may encourage sexual ag
gression against women.
Perhaps more importantly, a
belief that the male is the exclusive
sexual initiator and aggressor, while
the female is the weak and passive
receptor, shapes the behavior of
rape victims and leads many to view
themselves not as a victim, but as
an accomplice.
Although date and gang rape
share certain similarities with
anonymous rape, there are differ
ences.
Domination of women is a salient

characteristic of stranger rape,
which is typically a show of power
through sex. Acquaintance rape, on
the other hand, involves power or
physical coercion, but usually to ob
tain sex.
"Most anonymous rapists are
really hate-filled and violent toward
women," explained Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Patricia Polhemus.
"More date rapists are not hate
filled, but they feel they are entitled
to sex."
Assoc. Director of Residential
Education Alice Supton added that
date rapists "feel they're entitled
to what they want and they are
going to get it, riding roughshod
over a woman's feelings."
But, according to Melinda
Hodell, a graduate student in psy
chology and instructor of the course
"Psychology of Women and Vio
lence," control over women is still
an issue in date rape.
"In a culture that doesn't have
the issues of power and domination
over women, I don't think we would
have date rape," she said.
When "Julie" saw her friend
"Debbie" at a fraternity party, she
knew Debbie was in trouble.
Almost unconscious from excessive
drinking, Debbie could barely walk
and spoke incoherently. As Julie re
members it, four or five members of
the fraternity were virtually carrying
Debbie upstairs to a bedroom. Julie,
with the aid of a friend, stopped them
and carried Debbie back to her fresh
man dorm in Stern.
The following day, a member of
the fraternity told Julie that the guys
in the house were mad at her.

"They said you took their fun
away," he said.
Alcohol can be a primary con
tributor to the problem of rape.
This is perhaps more likely on a
university campus than in society
at large because alcohol is the focus
of so many social events.
"Alcohol helps reduce inhibitions
and is an excuse sometimes for not
taking responsiblity," Supton said.

'If it's your
boyfriend that
raped you, there's
an issue of trust or
loyalty that comes
into play, a fear
about being
believed or being
blamed for what
happened.'

"When alcohol has been used in
excess, it skews people's judgment,"
added Vinny Frost, president of the
Inter-Fraternity Council and of the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity.
"The natural agrcssiveness of
men (who might be prone to rape)
is enhanced with drinking," Chicos
said.
According to Frost, the question

of alcohol involves the fraternities
at Stanford since "alcohol is a larger
part of the social environment
(within the fraternity system) than
outside."
Fraternities, however, cannot be
assumed to be singularly responsi
ble for such incidents. Alcohol is
also served at dorm parties, and
harmful stereotypes about women
are by no means limited to members
of the Greek system.
But few deny that factors more
prevalent in fraternities have played
an important role in date and gang
rape incidents.
Sexist behavior toward women is
often cited as a prominent charac
teristic of some fraternities at many
universities. Criticism leveled at fra
ternities often is focused on hostile
attitudes toward women that are
fostered in a fraternity environment
— an environment in which contact
with women is limited to classes
and social situations.
Kappa Alpha President Charles
Moody said that fraternity members
"need to be conscious of attitudes
promulgated by its members."
"When you don't live with
women," Pisano said, "you are iso
lated in a way, and it is easier to
objectify people you don't have con
tact with."
"In an all-male environment, cer
tain attitidues toward women as a
group can be expressed that just
are not expressed when individually
men arc talking about women,"
Supton said.
Pisano added that he believes
that in situations when rape is being
committed, there may be "less of
an inclination to call your (frate
rnal) brother on that kind of be
havior."
But John Brooke, president of
the Theta Xi fraternity, cautioned
that fraternities differ significantly
from one another and care must
be exercised when talking about the
Greek system as a whole in relation
to issues such as date or gang rape.
"There are 11 (housed) fraterni
ties, and if one house has a problem
(with rape), that doesn't necessarily
mean that all fraternities have a
problem," Brooke said.
"Kim" went to a fraternity party
that evening with a friend. Although
she only had a few drinks, their al
cohol content was high and soon
took its effect. She walked home and
quickly fell asleep.
Sometime later that night, Kim
recalls, she awoke to find someone

in her room whom she didn7 imme
diately recognize. He raped her and
then dragged her into an outer room.
At this point, Kim realized that her
assailant was a member of the fra
ternity she had left earlier in the eve
rung'
"He threw me in the hammock
and raped me again," Kim said. "He
then took a shower, got dressed and
left."
According to Polhcmus, steps can
be taken to reduce the risk of rape.
"Just trying to defend yourself
greatly increases your chances of
avoiding rape," she said. "If we
make victims totally victims, then
women will be totally vulnerable
forever. Things can be done."
One way to increase awareness
is through educational programs
such as those sponsored by the
Rape Education Project. Such
residence-based discussion groups,
however, are not panaceas, Supton
said. "Increasing the level of aware
ness has not (in the past) had a
total impact on behavior," she cau
tioned.

"It seems that unfortunately a lot
of the men who go to rape educa
tion workshops are already ed
ucated and are already aware of
the problem," Wcdemeycr noted.
Getting men involved in the dis
cussions is vital, Hodell said.
"Men who believe date and gang
rape are wrong need to tell other
men so that the valuing" comes
from their peers, Hodell argued.
"A lot of men think date rape is
wrong," she said. "Men should start
talking about date rape and find
out why it occurs, because the
people affected by rape are their
female friends, their sisters and
their daughters."
But better personal communica
tion may be an additional important
first step in solving this problem.
"Part of it is a language problem,"
Pisano said. "It's hard for people
to talk about sex. . . . [When]
people have the idea that 'no*
means 'yes,' sex becomes some sort
of elaborate mating ritual."
"If we don't talk about sex, then
what's going on in one mind may
not be the same as what's going on

in the other person's mind," Supton
said.
Although discussion groups may
be enough to alter certain in
dividuals' behavior, some experts
argue that the beliefs that make
rape a reality are so deep-rooted
that they are not likely to change
after a short discussion on rape.

female friends, their sisters and
their daughters."
But better personal communica
tion may be an additional important
first step in solving this problem.
"Part of it is a language problem,"
Pisano said. "It's hard for people
to talk about sex. . . . [When]
people have the idea that 'no*
means 'yes,' sex becomes some sort
of elaborate mating ritual."
"If we don't talk about sex, then
what's going on in one mind may
not be the same as what's going on

in the other person's mind," Supton
said.
Although discussion groups may
be enough to alter certain in
dividuals' behavior, some experts
argue that the beliefs that make
rape a reality are so deep-rooted
that they are not likely to change
after a short discussion on rape.
"Until we have a wonderful world
(without rape), the ball is in the
female's court to protect herself,"
she said.
One option is to enroll in the
Stanford Workshops on Social and
Political Issues (SWOPSI) course,
"Issues in Self-Defense for Wom
en." Such classes, said Sarah Bryer,
a member of the Women's Center
and the Rape Education Project,
teach students more than physical
self-defense.
"They taught me not only how
to defend myself but how to be
self-assertive — that it's okay to be
rude sometimes," Bryer said.
"Everyone is vulnerable to rape
at one point or another," Rodriguez
said, "and Stanford is no exception
to that.'
Although "Susan," a Stanford student,
had originally planned to spend the evening
with her boyfriend, a call from another friend
changed her mind. According to Susan,
"Jeff" said he really needed to talk to her
in person. It was too important to discuss
on the phone. Susan was dropped off at
the campus fraternity house where her friend
was a member, not expecting to stay long.
No one seemed to know where Jeff was,
but Susan was invited to play drinking games
while she waited. The alcohol flowed, and
soon she was dnink. The men began to
make overt sexual advances, first alone and
then as a crowd.
It was at this point that Susan knew she
was in trouble.
"I didn 7 know what was going on," she
says today. "I felt really out of control. All
of a sudden the situation was out of my

hands."
Finally, Susan remembers, Jeff entered
the crowded room wearing only a rubber
raincoat and told Susan about a sexual
fantasy he wanted to act out. She protested
but was ignored.
"He forced himself on me, and that started
a lot of guys. There was always at least one
guy, sometimes two. There were guys 1 didn't
know coming in and doing stuff to me, and
I didn't know what was going 0n.... They
were holding me. ... I would try to leave,
but they would pull me back d0wn...."
"I didn't have any control, (and) it didn't
matter if 1 agreed at that point. ... I passed
out after that."
The next day Susan called Jeff to confront
him with what had happened the previous
night.
"He said, 'You were drunk. You've been
here before, and it's your own problem. I
think you really need help if you think some
thing was wrong,' " she recalls.

The names have been changed, but this
is "Susan's" account of events that oc
curred at a Stanford fraternity in 1986.
The other stories of rape recounted in
this article were also reported to have
occurred at Stanford.
Unfortunately, similar reports of date
and gang rape on university campuses
across the country are all too common.
"Rape happens in all geographical
regions," said Teresa Rodriguez, a rape
crisis director at the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA in Palo Alto. "It is cross-cultural
and cross-economic. There isn't one group
that is safe."
Only recently have universities begun
to recognize the problem of rape on col
lege campuses. Some institutions such as
Stanford, acknowledging relatively early
what one writer has called "the hidden
epidemic," have initiated programs on
rape education, awareness and prevention.
Misconceptions about rape are com

mon. Most people fail to recognize the
fact that there are varying classifications
of rapes and rapists. Most instead assume
that all rapists are those most often read
about in the newspapers or reported on
television, ski-masked men with knives
who jump out from hushes or dark alleys.
Such stereotypes are usually false, es
pecially on college campuses. Indeed, it
is much more common in cases of rape
at universities for the survivor to know
her assailant.
He is often a remote acquaintance,
someone who lives down the hall or a
boyfriend.
Perhaps the most important and exten
sive work on the subject of rape on college
campuses was published in 1985. Funded
in part by the National Center for the
Prevention and Control of Rape, Kent
State Unvcrsity psychologist Mary Koss
surveyed more than 7000 university stu
dents from 35 institutions across the

country. The results were startling:
• One woman in eight had been raped in
the year previous to the survey, and 52
percent of all women surveyed had expe
rienced some form of sexual victimization
during their life. Koss defines rape as
engaging in intercourse against one's will.
• One in every 12 men had participated
in a rape or attempted rape.
• Of the women raped, 90 percent knew
their assailants, and almost half of the
rapes occurred on dates or during similar
situations.
• Fewer than 10 percent of the assaulted
women told the police about the rape.
"People think the only way you can be
raped is by strangers, and that's not true,"
Rodriguez said. "Eighty to 90 percent of
rapists are known to the victims, and they
have some sort of relationship, all the way
from acquaintances to spouses."
Most rape counselors agree that
one important reason this and other
stereotypes about rape persist is
that a large percentage of rape vic
tims never report the assault.
Susan didn't report the rape. When
she returned home the next day, her
boyfriend was waiting for her. She
told him what had happened but
didn't go to the police.
"I thought it was my own fault,"
she says."I didn't know what to do."
Rape is recognized to be the most
underreported of all crimes, and
cases involving date and gang rape
are even less frequently reported.
Underreporting of rapes at univer
sities is so widespread, Koss con
cluded, that at least 10 times more
rapes occur among college students
than are reflected in official crime
statistics.
There are many reasons for this.
Pressing charges is a complex proc
ess, often traumatic for the rape
victim, and only rarely are rapes
successfully prosecuted.
According to Nadine O'Leary, as
sistant to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, there has been no
case of date or gang rape reported
to the Judicial Affairs Office for at
least 40 years.
The last reported sexual assault
at Stanford occurred in December
1986, according to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
Victims of date or gang rape
rarely come forward, Herrington
said.
"In our society, the victim may

either feel embarrassed or guilty,
(and) there's a sense of hopeless
ness about what might happen (if
the crime is reported)," said Laurie
Wedemeyer, a community educator
at the Mid-Peninsula YWCA.
"There is more self-blame (in
cases of date or gang rape), and
the whole trust issue is much more
prominent than with (anonymous)
rape," Wedemeyer said. Feelings of
shame, guilt and lowered self
esteem are often stronger in such
cases, she added.

'Men should start
talking about date
rape and find out
why it occurs be
cause the people af
fected by rape are
their female friends,
their sisters and
their daughters. 1

"If it's your boyfriend that raped
you, there's an issue of trust or
loyalty that comes into play, a fear
about being believed or (a fear of)
being blamed for what happened,"
Rodriguez said.
According to Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano, another reason
why women often do not report

rape is that many do not understand
what is and what is not rape. He
noted that such confusion helps ex
plain why, when answering rape sur
veys, women answer "no" to the
question, "Have you ever been
raped?" but "yes" when asked if
they had ever been forced to have
sex by an acquaintance.
Indeed, Koss' study reported that
of the women who were raped,
three out of four did not identify
their experience as rape. In the
eyes of many women, rape, if com
mitted by an acquaintance or friend,
seems not to be rape at all.
Stereotypes about traditional sex
roles are often cited by psy
chologists and rape experts as one
of the principal causes of rape.
According to Susan Chicos, com
munity educator at the Mid-
Peninsula Support Network for Bat
tered Women, "Stereotypes persist,
stereotypes from movies, books and
television that [instruct men on] the
macho way to be."
These stereotypes, Chicos said,
foster certain ways of thinking and
the development of specific sex
roles that may encourage sexual ag
gression against women.
Perhaps more importantly, a
belief that the male is the exclusive
sexual initiator and aggressor, while
the female is the weak and passive
receptor, shapes the behavior of
rape victims and leads many to view
themselves not as a victim, but as
an accomplice.
Although date and gang rape
share certain similarities with
anonymous rape, there are differ
ences.
Domination of women is a salient

characteristic of stranger rape,
which is typically a show of power
through sex. Acquaintance rape, on
the other hand, involves power or
physical coercion, but usually to ob
tain sex.
"Most anonymous rapists are
really hate-filled and violent toward
women," explained Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Patricia Polhemus.
"More date rapists are not hate
filled, but they feel they are entitled
to sex."
Assoc. Director of Residential
Education Alice Supton added that
date rapists "feel they're entitled
to what they want and they are
going to get it, riding roughshod
over a woman's feelings."
But, according to Melinda
Hodell, a graduate student in psy
chology and instructor of the course
"Psychology of Women and Vio
lence," control over women is still
an issue in date rape.
"In a culture that doesn't have
the issues of power and domination
over women, I don't think we would
have date rape," she said.
When "Julie" saw her friend
"Debbie" at a fraternity party, she
knew Debbie was in trouble.
Almost unconscious from excessive
drinking, Debbie could barely walk
and spoke incoherently. As Julie re
members it, four or five members of
the fraternity were virtually carrying
Debbie upstairs to a bedroom. Julie,
with the aid of a friend, stopped them
and carried Debbie back to her fresh
man dorm in Stern.
The following day, a member of
the fraternity told Julie that the guys
in the house were mad at her.

"They said you took their fun
away," he said.
Alcohol can be a primary con
tributor to the problem of rape.
This is perhaps more likely on a
university campus than in society
at large because alcohol is the focus
of so many social events.
"Alcohol helps reduce inhibitions
and is an excuse sometimes for not
taking responsiblity," Supton said.

'If it's your
boyfriend that
raped you, there's
an issue of trust or
loyalty that comes
into play, a fear
about being
believed or being
blamed for what
happened.'

"When alcohol has been used in
excess, it skews people's judgment,"
added Vinny Frost, president of the
Inter-Fraternity Council and of the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity.
"The natural agrcssiveness of
men (who might be prone to rape)
is enhanced with drinking," Chicos
said.
According to Frost, the question

of alcohol involves the fraternities
at Stanford since "alcohol is a larger
part of the social environment
(within the fraternity system) than
outside."
Fraternities, however, cannot be
assumed to be singularly responsi
ble for such incidents. Alcohol is
also served at dorm parties, and
harmful stereotypes about women
are by no means limited to members
of the Greek system.
But few deny that factors more
prevalent in fraternities have played
an important role in date and gang
rape incidents.
Sexist behavior toward women is
often cited as a prominent charac
teristic of some fraternities at many
universities. Criticism leveled at fra
ternities often is focused on hostile
attitudes toward women that are
fostered in a fraternity environment
— an environment in which contact
with women is limited to classes
and social situations.
Kappa Alpha President Charles
Moody said that fraternity members
"need to be conscious of attitudes
promulgated by its members."
"When you don't live with
women," Pisano said, "you are iso
lated in a way, and it is easier to
objectify people you don't have con
tact with."
"In an all-male environment, cer
tain attitidues toward women as a
group can be expressed that just
are not expressed when individually
men arc talking about women,"
Supton said.
Pisano added that he believes
that in situations when rape is being
committed, there may be "less of
an inclination to call your (frate
rnal) brother on that kind of be
havior."
But John Brooke, president of
the Theta Xi fraternity, cautioned
that fraternities differ significantly
from one another and care must
be exercised when talking about the
Greek system as a whole in relation
to issues such as date or gang rape.
"There are 11 (housed) fraterni
ties, and if one house has a problem
(with rape), that doesn't necessarily
mean that all fraternities have a
problem," Brooke said.
"Kim" went to a fraternity party
that evening with a friend. Although
she only had a few drinks, their al
cohol content was high and soon
took its effect. She walked home and
quickly fell asleep.
Sometime later that night, Kim
recalls, she awoke to find someone

in her room whom she didn7 imme
diately recognize. He raped her and
then dragged her into an outer room.
At this point, Kim realized that her
assailant was a member of the fra
ternity she had left earlier in the eve
rung'
"He threw me in the hammock
and raped me again," Kim said. "He
then took a shower, got dressed and
left."
According to Polhcmus, steps can
be taken to reduce the risk of rape.
"Just trying to defend yourself
greatly increases your chances of
avoiding rape," she said. "If we
make victims totally victims, then
women will be totally vulnerable
forever. Things can be done."
One way to increase awareness
is through educational programs
such as those sponsored by the
Rape Education Project. Such
residence-based discussion groups,
however, are not panaceas, Supton
said. "Increasing the level of aware
ness has not (in the past) had a
total impact on behavior," she cau
tioned.

"It seems that unfortunately a lot
of the men who go to rape educa
tion workshops are already ed
ucated and are already aware of
the problem," Wcdemeycr noted.
Getting men involved in the dis
cussions is vital, Hodell said.
"Men who believe date and gang
rape are wrong need to tell other
men so that the valuing" comes
from their peers, Hodell argued.
"A lot of men think date rape is
wrong," she said. "Men should start
talking about date rape and find
out why it occurs, because the
people affected by rape are their
female friends, their sisters and
their daughters."
But better personal communica
tion may be an additional important
first step in solving this problem.
"Part of it is a language problem,"
Pisano said. "It's hard for people
to talk about sex. . . . [When]
people have the idea that 'no*
means 'yes,' sex becomes some sort
of elaborate mating ritual."
"If we don't talk about sex, then
what's going on in one mind may
not be the same as what's going on

in the other person's mind," Supton
said.

ucated and are already aware of
the problem," Wcdemeycr noted.
Getting men involved in the dis
cussions is vital, Hodell said.
"Men who believe date and gang
rape are wrong need to tell other
men so that the valuing" comes
from their peers, Hodell argued.
"A lot of men think date rape is
wrong," she said. "Men should start
talking about date rape and find
out why it occurs, because the
people affected by rape are their
female friends, their sisters and
their daughters."
But better personal communica
tion may be an additional important
first step in solving this problem.
"Part of it is a language problem,"
Pisano said. "It's hard for people
to talk about sex. . . . [When]
people have the idea that 'no*
means 'yes,' sex becomes some sort
of elaborate mating ritual."
"If we don't talk about sex, then
what's going on in one mind may
not be the same as what's going on

in the other person's mind," Supton
said.
Although discussion groups may
be enough to alter certain in
dividuals' behavior, some experts
argue that the beliefs that make
rape a reality are so deep-rooted
that they are not likely to change
after a short discussion on rape.
"Until we have a wonderful world
(without rape), the ball is in the
female's court to protect herself,"
she said.
One option is to enroll in the
Stanford Workshops on Social and
Political Issues (SWOPSI) course,
"Issues in Self-Defense for Wom
en." Such classes, said Sarah Bryer,
a member of the Women's Center
and the Rape Education Project,
teach students more than physical
self-defense.
"They taught me not only how
to defend myself but how to be
self-assertive — that it's okay to be
rude sometimes," Bryer said.
"Everyone is vulnerable to rape
at one point or another," Rodriguez
said, "and Stanford is no exception
to that.'
