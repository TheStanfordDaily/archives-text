Stanford students should take
advantage of the opportunities
available in state and federal
government in order to influence
and learn about the political
process, California State As
semblyman Byron Shcr told a
group of students at Branner
Ilall Friday afternoon.
Sher, who is also a professor
at the Law School, represents
Stanford and Palo Alto.
According to Sher, local stu
dent activity seems to be focused
primarily on national issues,
rather than on local or Califor
nian issues.
"Federal conflicts are very im
portant, of course, and students
have been very vocal and influen
tial in major issues, especially
beginning in the 19605, but they
have to realize that students can
have an impact in local level
stuff, too," he said.
Students can be especially in
fluential during political cam
paigns, Shcr said, adding that
some of his students here have
helped "tremendously" in his
campaigns.
"Students can make a differ
ence because they're young,
bright and they have tons of en

ergy and initiative," he said.
"Student groups can be powerful
lobby groups, but they must be
organized and vocal."
Shcr cited UC-Berkeley as an
example of a university with a
powerful student lobby organi
zation. In addition, a Cal-at-
Sacramento program designed to
urge students to get involved in
state government has existed
there for 50 years, he said.
A Stanford-in-Sacramcnto
program was begun only last year
under Stanford-in-Government.

'Student groups can be
powerful lobby groups,
but they must be or
ganized and vocal.'

Sophomore Lori Silver, head
of the Stanford-in-Sacramento
program, noted that Stanford
students "can have much more
influence on state politics than
national politics because we are
so visible in California."
According to Sher, environ
mental issues are some of the
most important concerns Califor
nians face today.
