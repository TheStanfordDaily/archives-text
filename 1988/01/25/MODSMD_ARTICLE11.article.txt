# Libertarian Marrou seeks vice presidency
## Candidate: Bring all U.S. troops home 
### Jay Bhattacharya Staff writer 
Andre Marrou, the Libertarian
Party's 1988 vice presidential can
didate, in a Sunday interview here
called for a non-interventionist
foreign policy and the withdrawal
of U.S. troops from all foreign com
mitments, including Japan and
Western Europe.
Marrou's stance echoes a tradi
tional Libertarian platform that em
phasizes decreased government in
volvement in nearly every aspect of
American life.
Arguing that "individual freedom
and civil liberties gain directly"
from a minimization of government
interference, Marrou said he ad
vocates free trade, a reduction in
governmental bureaucracy and the
abolition of the income tax.
"The troops serve no purpose in
foreign countries. ... They should
be called back to defend America,"
he said. "U.S. troops (in Western
Europe) can't defend (West) Ger
many against a Soviet attack. ...
We must ask the fundamental ques
tion: What are our troops for? We
must have them to defend this
country, and for no other reason."
Eliminating U.S. military pres
ence abroad "would save over $200
billion," Marrou said, and would
be a significant step toward a
balanced budget.
According to Marrou, events in
other countries should not be im
portant in determining U.S. policy.
Regarding the Persian Gulf, for ex
ample, Marrou asks, "Why are our
ships defending an area that pro
vides us with only 4 percent of our
oil, while the Alaska pipeline, which
gives us 25 percent of it, is left
open ... to terrorist attack?"
While Marrou said he believes

that the United States should con
tinue to draw oil from the Gulf, he
said he recommends that those na
tions (such as Japan) that draw the
majority of their oil from the region
provide its defense.
Marrou's platform contains other
controversial defense policies, in
cluding a reduction in the total
number of American nuclear war
heads from 35,000 to 5000.
"There are too many warheads
now, and there is no way to deliver
them all to the Soviet Union.. ..
We don't have the delivery systems
(to support our warheads). Just
having them around serves no pur
pose."
Marrou's position on issues such
as social security and welfare follow
that of the Libertarian Party's.
"Government (welfare and social
security) programs waste a large
portion of money alloted to them
on useless bureaucracies," he said.
"Private charities are best
equipped to deal with the problems
of homelessness and poverty be
cause they don't waste money on
excess administration," Marrou
said.
The current government actually
inhibits private organizations from
helping the homeless, Marrou said.
For example, zoning laws prevent
the establishment of shelters for the
homeless in many cities, he said.
To combat the national budget
deficit, "the government should
stop replacing bureaucrats who
leave their jobs," Marrou said, add
ing that recalling troops from
abroad will also help reduce the
national debt.
Marrou said he also advocates
eliminating public education, a
drastic step toward reducing gov
ernment spending. Public education
is poorer in quality and more costly

than private schooling, he said.
He further argued that education
should not be mandatory. "People
should have a choice" in whether
they want to have an education,
Marrou said, adding that he ex

pected most people to choose to
go to school.
Marrou suggested that the gov
ernment subsidize the educations
of those who cannot afford private
school ing.
