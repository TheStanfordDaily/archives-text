The University last week announced that its new
undergraduate housing complex will be built either
at the present location of the golf driving range or
on the site of the Manzanita trailer park.
It is encouraging to see the University taking
steps to realize its hope of guaranteeing four years
of on-campus housing to all undergraduates. Indeed,
decisions about the site and design of the complex,
targeted for completion in 1991, should be made
with all due speed.
But where to build? The driving range or Man
zanita?
The University can choose to build on the driving
range, an athletic facility that is popular, well
utilized and probably difficult to replace. It is a
site that is even farther from the center of campus
than Governor's Corner, which is already referred
to colloquially as "out there."
Or the University can choose to build the new
housing complex on the present site of "the trailers,"
a housing cluster that is ugly, run-down and long
overdue to be replaced. It is close to both the
academic center of campus and popular facilities
like Maples Pavilion and Encina Gym.
Granted, some students do like life in the Man
zanita trailers. But those students are far outnum
bered by the hundreds of students currently living

off campus who would be accommodated by a dorm
complex that would much better utilize the huge
amount of land presently occupied by the
dilapidated trailers.
Of course, there would be a temporary reduction
in the number of on-campus housing spaces between
the time the trailers are torn down and the time
the new complex is completed. But the University
could address this problem by offering rent subsidies
to students forced off campus during construction.
There are several compelling reasons not to
choose the driving range as the site of the new
housing complex. The range is very popular (it's
almost always crowded). It is the kind of facility
that, because of its size, would be difficult to re
locate. Furthermore, the range is one of the few
spots on campus where interested students can
learn to play golf. The Stanford Golf Course is
heavily used and of such difficulty that it isn't
practical to expect beginning students to learn on
the course.
The choice is clear: The trailers need to go, and
there is no better reason to get rid of them than
to make way for more and better undergraduate
housing.
The motley mobile homes won't be missed. New
housing and a farewell to the unguaranteed year
will be welcome and long-overdue innovations.
