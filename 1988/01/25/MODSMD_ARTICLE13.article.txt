Article recounting
trip south reveals
confused concerns
I read with some dismay the Jan.
14 article in The Daily concerning
the efforts of "Project Democracy,"
and some comments are in order.
First, although the supposed rea
son for this trip was to register
voters, the only mention made in
the article was that "to our surprise
.. . most of the blacks ... were
already registered." Who did the
research that showed a problem in
the first place? Did any of the Stan
ford students register even one new
voter?
Second, the writer states that the
reason voters fail to vote is that
they think voting won't improve
things, but concludes that this time
it will be different. He fails to give
any reasoning, however, why this
time should be any different, stating
only that "1988 is a historic time."
Third, the writer states that
"blacks in the South are clearly the
most exploited, the most economi
cally depressed" of the ethnic
groups in the country. However,
rural poverty is not clearly worse
than ghetto life, and Asian and
Mexican workers in the Los Angeles
area face what seems a harsher life
than Southern blacks. This is obvi
ous in the article itself: "The people

(poor rural blacks) were more
friendly than any I've ever encoun
tered."
Fourth, freezing rain seems a
pretty poor excuse not to register
voters. Even the post office delivers
in the rain. Enough said. The fifth
point is far more serious: libel.
According to the writer, "An
other large corporation, American
Can, owns approximately 40 per
cent of the land in Sumter County
and logs the land without paying
proper taxes." How was this con
clusion reached? Is there docu
mented evidence? Is there a case
in court? If not, I would be wary
of bringing up such charges in a
news article.
Something like "we heard they
were not paying taxes" is bad
enough, but to state that they are
not, well, I'd contact the Law School
about this. Certainly if I were an
officer of American Can, I would
not appreciate such a comment.
Sixth, the writer bemoans the fact
that there is only one park in the
entire county. But how many people
live there? And how many parks
are necessary in a rural county?
And despite the lack of "swimming
pools," I suspect the young folks
there do more swimming than their
urban counterparts in natural
streams.
Seventh, the writer's last com
ment is particularly galling. "From

the FBI to corrupt local, state and
national politicians to big corpora
tions, the forces stacked against the
poor and most particularly, the
black poor of the South, are
tremendous." However, earlier in
the article he noted that the FBI
had investigated the politicians and
found them not corrupt (which he
used as evidence that the FBI was
harassing the citizens).
They cannot be both corrupt and
innocently harangued. Further, ex
actly what link exists between the
criminal activities of "national
politicians" (whoever they are) and
any deliberate policies enacted to
keep the poor impoverished? At
worst, one might accuse Washing
ton of neglect.
And as far as large corporations
are concerned, most states are fight
ing to get them to locate therein,
as companies are seen to greatly
reduce poverty by providing jobs.
Thus, this article fails to demon
strate any of its accusations, some
of which are serious (tax evasion,
corrupt local officials, health
hazards).
Indeed, the trip itself is called
into question. If I went to register
voters, I would knock on every door,
rain or shine, to register them.
When did "motivating voters" be
come part of the plan, or attending
church or investigating tax fraud?
