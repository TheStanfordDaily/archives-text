## Israeli policy belies peace promises 
### 
The rccent riots in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza have so far left 36 Palestinians dead
and more than 200 wounded at the hands of
the Israeli armed forces. More than 1000 Pales
tinians have been imprisoned, and four were
deported after "quick trials".

Although these riots are being described as
the worst in 20 years of occupation, it is not
the first time that Israeli forces have killed
unarmed civilians or deported Palestinians. At
least 1000 Palestinians have been deported since
1967.
The riots reflect the frustration and desper
ation of the Palestinians in the occupied ter
ritories, where they neither have freedom of
political expression nor the right to vote. About
260,000 of 1.2 million Palestinians living in the
territories commute daily to Israel (where they
are not allowed to spend the night) to work in
a variety of low-paying jobs. They are not entitled
to social benefits or insurance for old age or
disability since the Israelis hire them on a daily
basis.
Nevertheless, Palestinians pay more taxes than
Israelis â€” but for much less in services, since
most live in refugee camps. Those who choose
to work in the territories find it even harder.
For security reasons, Israeli officials have banned
Gaza residents from fishing, the main source of
income for Gazans. Farming requires military
permission, especially to dig wells, permission
that is almost never granted. Farmers cannot
market their produce except through the Israeli
government.
Palestinians who may want to work abroad
need the permission of the Israeli government,
and they risk losing their residency status if they
do not return to the territories within a year.
Palestinians suspected of involvement in anti-
Israeli attacks can have their homes bulldozed

before they are even charged with a crime. They
can also be detained for as long as six months
before any charges are brought against them.
Moreover, a Palestinian can lose his land
through "expropriation for public use" or "mil
itary purposes," which translate into building
new Jewish settlements. As of April 1987, as
much as 52 percent of the West Bank has been
turned into 124 luxurious settlements that host
60,000 Israeli settlers.
On the other hand, Jewish immigrants of So
viet or American nationality automatically ac
quire Israeli citizenship. These actions by the
Israeli government are clearly a form of racism
that cannot be tolerated. Yet officials claim
Israel is not like South Africa. They argue that
Israel could have annexed the West Bank and
Gaza and granted the inhabitants Israeli citizen
ship but has not done so because the Israeli
government wants to reach a settlement of the
Palestinian issue with its Arab neighbors. Israeli
officials claim that since there are 3.5 million
Jews and 2 million Palestinians in the occupied
territories, Israel would still retain its Jewish
identity.
However, given the high birth rate among
Palestinians compared to Jews, Israel is bound
to lose its Jewish identity by the year 2000
(provided Palestinians have the same rights as
Jews). This leads to the second option: negotiat
ing a settlement to establish a Palestinian state
that would give back the occupied territories to
their rightful owners.
Israeli officials claim they are ready to
negotiate with the Arabs in order to establish
a state (not necessarily Palestinian) that would
be under the supervision of Israel and Jordan
or Egypt. This clearly does not solve the problem,
since it deprives the Palestinians of their basic
right of self-determination.
Israeli officials also claim they arc ready for
a peaceful settlement with all the Arabs who
are unwilling to negotiate. They cite the Camp
David treaty with Egypt as an example but
overlook the fact that Sadat had callcd for a

peaceful settlement as early as 1971. When Israel
refused his offer, Egypt and Syria launched the
1973 war that finally led to the Camp David
accord and the return of Sinai to Egypt.
Many analysts expected Egypt to act as a
bridge between Israel and the Arab world, but
Israel continued its aggression against the Arabs
in order to isolate Egypt from the Arabs and
prevent future negotiations that would lead to
further territorial concessions. In 1981, contrary
to all United Nations resolutions and the Camp
David accords, Israel annexed Jerusalem and
the Syrian Golan Heights.
In June 1982, 40 days after returning the Sinai
to Egypt, Israel invaded Lebanon and committed
the Sabra and Shatila massacres, in which
thousands of women, children and old people
were slaughtered. In the meantime, more settle
ments were being built in the occupied territories
in defiance of the Camp David accords. In 1982,
Israel rejected the "Reagan Initiative," a carbon
copy of the Camp David treaty. It began sup- [
plying Iran with arms only to prolong the Iran-
Iraq war. Its air raids on Lebanon since 1985 '
arc too many to count. In the past two years j
alone, Israel has launched 39 of these raids,
killing at least 100 civilians.
These actions arc clearly not ones of a gov
ernment interested in pcace, but rather they
are of one that wants the "status quo" to go
on forever. It hopes to expel the Palestinians
somehow and to annex the occupied territories.
Meanwhile, Washington continues economic and
military support for Israel that amounts to $3
billion a year. As a result, the Israeli government
has defied all U.N. resolutions and international
opinion.
Unless the United States threatens to stop
its military aid to Israel, there is very little hope
for a peaceful settlement in the area. After all,
the bullets that claimed the lives of 36 Pales
tinians and the F-18s used in the various raids
on Lebanon were made in the United States.
