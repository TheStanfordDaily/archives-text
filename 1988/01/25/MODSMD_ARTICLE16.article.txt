# Disney beats downhill
## 
### 
Many college students spend three-day weekends
going skiing. I, however, do not partake in this rite
of mountain athletics. Being of a singularly uncoor
dinated disposition, unable to navigate snow or ice
even without boards strapped to my feet, skiing and
I have never developed what could be called a close
relationship.

My few attempts at this sport have resulted in what
could best be described as "egalitarian skiing:" I mow
down other skiers regardless of their sex, age or class.
Consequently, my plans for Martin Luther King's
birthday weekend looked not to the frosty north, but
to the sunny south and the fulfillment of a childhood
dream: Disneyland.
When I was seven, the Perkinses, close family friends,
took a vacation to Disneyland, and their two sons
returned from this venture bearing wondrous tales
and personalized mouse ears. They described the park
in such glowing terms that I was soon clamoring to
my parents for equal treatment.
But I was doomed to disappointment. At this tender
age, I learned that the Sassaman family docs not do
Disneyland; rather, the Sassaman family does central
Pennsylvania, my parents' homeland.
On these vacations I was offered what appeared,
on the surface, to be a suitable substitute: Hcrshey
Park, a theme park created by the makers of the
Ã¼biquitous waxen chocolate products. Unfortunately,
it could never live up to the fabled wonders of the
Magic Kingdom.
So, when I actually made it to Disneyland two weeks
ago, I was ready for a truly amazing experience. I was
accompanied by my boyfriend, a veteran of many
Disneyland excursions, and Misty, our cheerful and
ever-faithful chaperone. After our eight-hour drive
through the Central Valley, sans any acceptable radio
stations, I had hoped to stay in the Disneyland Hotel,
a typically ugly 1950s monstrosity that looms on the
park's edge. Unfortunately, rooms at this place cost
a whopping $160 a night, higher than the rates most
families can afford and certainly out of reach for
starving college students like ourselves.
So we ended up in the less ostentatious and signif
icantly cheaper Pink Flamingo Motel, which appeared
to have been transplanted from Las Vegas. It appeared
to be less a "family-oriented" business than a location

for covcrt, rendezvous between Minnie and Goofy,
but, after all, we were in Orange County.
My first impression of Disneyland was that it
employed fascists in its parking lot. Ever wonder where
petty and authoritarian people go to exercise systematic
power over others? Well, they're in the parking lot
of the Happiest Place on Earth, making sure that
every single space in each row is filled before the next
row is begun. There were no warm smiles here, no
happy, welcoming faces; just veiled threats of expulsion
for parking in the Kanga Lot before both the Donald
and Snow White lots were completely full.
Once inside the park, things were somewhat better.
The grounds were very clean, as were the bizarre
polyester uniforms of the employees running the rides.
The lines for these were long, 30 minutes being the
average wait for a five-minute ride; but some of them
were actually quite fun. The teacups were everything
I had hoped for, as were the Matterhorn and Pirates
of the Caribbean.
But in many places, the Magic of the Kingdom wore
a bit thin. The award for most sickening went to
Captain Eo, a 3-D movie starring Michael Jackson.
The plot was simple: Captain Eo (Michael) goes on
an intergalactic mission to make Angelica Huston
beautiful again. Despite her opposition to this, he
accomplishes the task by dancing about and shooting
rainbows from his fingers. It was a bit like Thriller,
only set on the Deathstar, with storm troopers instead
of corpses.
I had also looked forward to It's a Small World.
But let me assure you, 10 continuous minutes of that
song, sung over and over in childish, slightly off-key
voices, will leave even the most ardent internationalist
feeling xenophobic.
And let me add, for my friends who are wondering
why they didn't get post cards, that I honestly tried.
I bought several, wrote appropriate cliches on the
back and "mailed" them. How was 1 to know that
Disney, in his never-ending effort to make everything
squeaky clean and Utopian, had designed trash barrels
that closely resemble mailboxes?
As much as I hate to admit it, Disneyland does
have a unique charm, perverse though it may be, but
enough that it brought out a small measure of the
child in at least this one cynic. At any rate, it was
better than hurtling down a mountain slope, completely
out of control and then fooling no one with the claim
that my screams of distress were actually Nordic battle
cries, absolutely fitting given the origins of skiing.
Oh, by the way, I didn't get any mouse cars. This
"child in all of us" business should only be allowed
to go so far. Maturity is not a quality to be trifled with.
Besides, they didn't have my size.
