Which character are you in"The
New Generation?" After reading
this collection of short stories, gath
ered from the creative writing pro
grams at Stanford, the University
of lowa, Columbia and Johns Hop
kins, the reader will naturally try
to find a place for himself among
the mottled lives of the characters
depicted in the work of these
blooming writers.
The collection is edited by Alan
Kaufman, who was a graduate stu
dent at Columbia at the time the
work was published. In his preface,
which is better understood after
reading the stories, Kaufman writes
that his aim was to find the voice
of the 1980s.
Of the writers in his collection,
Kaufman writes, "They inhabit an
age which freezes the heart: meta
phorically speaking, a Medusa. To
trap her diabolical visage in their
fiction, they track her to her lair,
hold their imaginations up to her,
catch her reflection in polished
prose; dangerous work. In her
image, we see our own."
The "new generation" is not un
familiar to us. Its members are
detached adolescents, passionate
drug addicts and cryptic Vietnam
veterans. They are persistent ar
tisans, average New Yorkers and
eager immigrants.
Love and attachments are com
mon themes in"The New
Generation," but suprisingly, the
stories give this age-old preoccupa
tion a particular novelty that
reflects something of our age. As
with all fine short stories, there is

no lack of drama in these works.
A tone of the macabre dominates
this collection. Violence is the victor
in many of the stories, including
Eileen Pollack's "The Vanity of
Small Differences," Fred Leebron's
"Cuisinart" and Patricia Macinnes'
"View from Kwaj." The "new
generation" lives in a world where
frustrated teenagers set themselves
afire, and unrequited lovers lash
out with dangerous kitchen appli
ances.

The new generation
is not unfamiliar to
us. Its members are
detached adoles
cents, passionate
drug addicts and
cryptic Vietnam vet
erans.

Eroticism keeps good company
with the grotesque in"The New
Generation." Naked women wor
ship a parable-telling minister,
biting and gnawing each other in
liberal sexual gratification through
out the church. The narrator in the
story, Teri Ruch's "Claire's Lover's
Church," is not kidding when he
says, "They are bad, bad, bad, and
love it."
But not all these stories are so
extreme. In "Conviction," by Tama
Janowitz, young divorcees answer
personal ads calling for "Women
of all ages; get what you really want"
and apply to be "hot, horny ladies"

with companies such as "Linda's
Phone Fantasies."
But just when the reader reaches
the brink of laughing in terror and
runs out of faith in normal sexuality,
everyday Middle America reap
pears to rescue the "new gen
eration."
In addition to the uncanny tales
of distorted perceptions, there are
crafty glimpses of contemporary life
that tend toward realism. The
reader encounters characters who
might be likenesses of himself or
of co-workers and friends.
These stories mirror life. "In the
American Society," by Gish Jen, is
a light-hearted insight into the lives
of Asian-Americans and country
club thugs. Ethan Canin's "Where
We Are Now" is a somewhat slow
moving tale of a couple realizing
they cannot afford a house in South
ern California.
A few stories are a bit on the
stale side, such as Susan Minot's
"Sparks" and Linda Svendsen's
"Flight," but their characters arc
accurate depictions of the middle
class society from which they come.
Character is one of this collec
tion's most outstanding features. If
someone were to say, 'Picture a
shoe salesman,' you would probably
think of someone very much like
the main character of "Ten Cents
a Dance" by Joseph Ferrandino:
toupee, thick glasses, etc. However,
the portrayal is so honestly true to
the stereotype that Henry, the sales
man, easily wins the reader's heart.
In"The New Generation," even
raccoons contribute to the varied
voice of personalities. Gregory
Blake Smith's "Hands," a recount
ing of love and rivalry between man
and garbage-robbing beast, is one
of the best in the collection.
The Stanford writers featured in
the collection, for better or worse,

offer a fairly realistic view of the
"new generation." Whether this has
anything to do with life in Palo
Alto is up for debate.
Some of the locally famous writ
ers include Michelle Carter, Ehud
Havazelet, Katharine Andres, Den
nis McFarland and Kent Nussey.
Their lucid stories are packed with
frank information that balances the
elusive tones found in the erotic
and grotesque stories.
Michelle Carter's "The Things
That Would Never Be Mine" is a
skeleton of calculated detail. Her
characters are brought to life by
their specificity: The husband is the
type "who would never ... cat the
chocolate vein out of the fudge rip
ple," and his rival, his wife's aged
female companion, charms his mate
out of the boredom of a shaky mar
riage. The diction is eloquent and
the dialogues important, but the
story is missing a certain vitality.
Ehud Havazelet's "Jillie" seduces
the reader with two emotionally
vivid teenagers. Jillie is dynamic and

intriguing â€” especially in her devo
tion to an incoherent grandmother.
The reader cannot help but join
her adoring male cousin as he fol
lows Jillie through their summer
together.
"Things to Draw" by Katharine
Andres also focuses on two probing
adolescents, though the thoughtful
protagonist here must confront the
death of her father. Margaret's
mourning is tempered by the con
solation she finds in a sensitive
friend, the Brooklyn Zoo and Sa
shimi. Andres' carefully constructed
outlook, as seen through Margaret's
eyes, is interesting and soothing.
A faulty marriage is again the
subject in Dennis McFarland's
"Last Night." The characters here
are twisted around each other, a
confused menagerie of discontent.
Throughout the story, tensions rise
and fall in a barroom where a dis
carded, drunken boyfriend meets
his clean-cut successor.
Kent Nussey turns to life in Cal
ifornia in"In Christ There Is No

East or West" to uncovcr bored
and spiritually empty people. An
eerie visit from a missionary ends
up in musical union between two
men who play the trombone. Al
though the main character reads
Emerson and loves hockey, his lust
for his neighbor, a vivacious college
co-ed, is a bit too common and
undermines the strange tone set by
the visit of the religious emissary .
In"The New Generation," these
realistic and macabre talcs combine
gracefully to create a world that is
believable and yet places no limita
tions on experience, no matter how
bizarre.
Together, the stories elicit emo
tions that range from compassion
and joy to shuddering terror. The
world of "The New Generation" is
one in which a reader can really
live. Kaufman has assembled a virile
and stimulating society. The "new
generation" created by these new
writers is one that parallels the
strange oddities and human emo
tions of life itself.
