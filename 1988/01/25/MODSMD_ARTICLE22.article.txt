## Rejuvenated Wright sparks Card romp, 70-54 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Ice, elcctrical stimulation, crutches, contrasting heat
and cold treatments and a whole lot of hoping were
applied to Howard Wright's sprained ankle Friday
and Saturday, hut in the end it was old Mother Nature
that came to the rescue.
"Adrenaline is one hell of a painkiller," Wright said
in the Cardinal locker room Saturday night after
scoring 18 points and playing 32 minutes in Stanford's
70-54 victory over the visiting California Golden Hears.
For a man who was on crutches until several hours
before tip-off, Wright had an astounding evening. The
6-foot-8 junior was 7-of-9 from the field, including an
un-Wright hook shot, sank all four of his free throws,
picked up only two personal fouls and swatted one
ill-advised Bear shot.
That must have been one mighty dose of adrenaline.
"Before we ran out (for pre-game warm-ups), I was
trying to warm up in the hallway, and it felt terrible,"
Wright said. "Then we ran out, and the crowd got us
going, and 1 got pumped up."
And when Wright scored the first basket of the
game on his patented lean-in layup, the diagnosis was
that California would be in trouble. The Bears ended
up suffering their eighth loss in their last nine games,
and their record fell to 5-10 overall, 2-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference.
Stanford meanwhile improved to 12-6, 4-2 in the
Pac-10, and Cardinal Coach Mike Montgomery, whose
top scorer, Todd Lichti, was also hampered by an
ankle injury, felt extremely relieved.
"Needless to say, I'm very, very pleased with this
win, especially after all of the problems this week,"
Montgomery said. "Friday night we had both Howard
and Todd on crutches, and it wasn't until a half hour
before the game that we knew Howard would play."
Just a minute and a half into the game, however,
Montgomery's worries began to dissipate. Three
straight buckets by Wright, Bryan McSwccney and
Lichti sent the sellout crowd of 7500 into a frenzy
and sent the Bears into the refuge of a time-out huddle.
Stanford took a 34-26 lead into halftime and then
blew the game open with an even faster start to the
second half.
Cardinal guard Terry Taylor, who surprisingly hadn't
attempted a 3-point shot in the first 20 minutes, buried
two bombs to begin the last 20 minutes. Wright added
a nifty reverse layup to put Stanford ahead 42-28, and
California scurried to a sideline huddle once again.
"Stanford came out smoking," California Coach Lou
Campanelli said. "It's the same thing we've been doing
on the road â€” getting down and then playing catch
up."
The Bears never again got closer than 12 points.
"A couple of 3-point shots by Terry, and boom, it
gave us a great start to the second half," Montgomery
said. "Our defense played very well tonight. We didn't
let the lead shrink."
The Cardinal defense's cardinal goal for the evening
was to stop California's Matt Becuwsaert, and
McSwecncy was the main man. McSweeney held
Beeuwsacrt, who was averaging 15.3 points per game,
to a miniscule four points.
Beeuwsacrt started off cold, and after the crowd
started chanting "air ball" every time he got the ball,
he lost location of the rim entirely.
"I think Bryan (McSweeney) got things rolling, and
then Matthew started thinking about his shot after
that," Lichti said.
Campanelli, who among other things wasn't too
happy with the officiating, did not give credit to
McSweeney for shutting down Becuwsaert.
"I don't think it was anything Stanford did. If a kid
only gets four shots, then you can say he was clamped,"
Campanelli said. "Matt got himself into trouble with
some (referee's) calls and got into foul trouble."
Whether the 6-6 Becuwsaert was in the game or
not, California had difficulty stopping the taller Car

dinal. In addition to Wright's 18 inside points, Stan
ford's 6-11 center Greg Butler scored 14 and held
Bear center Hartmutt Ortman to four points on the
night.
The only effective Golden Bear was the happy-go
lucky freshman Roy Fisher, who simply chuckled when
a few Stanford fans suggested they pull his shorts
down while he was inbounding the ball in front of
the student section.
Fisher kept his shorts up, pulled down 10 rebounds
and laughed his way to 18 points on the evening.
Stanford continued to shoot well from the field,
hitting 52 percent in the contest. The Cardinal still

had some shaky stretches when it turned the ball over
too often, but those mistakes didn't make a difference.
The bench also had a good night, with Derek Bruton
scoring four points and grabbing five rebounds in only
seven minutes of action and freshman Deshon W'ingatc
giving Wright and Butler 12 minutes of rest.
"I would have started Stuart (Thomas) if Wright
couldn't play, because I thought Deshon would have
been too nervous," said Montgomery, who used Win
gate as the first man off the bench. "Deshon is just
the nervous sort."
Stanford travels to Oregon State Thursday and
Oregon Saturday.
