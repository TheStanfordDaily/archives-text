# McSweeney shuts down Beeuwsaert

What happens when the Pacific 10 Conference's
leading scorer is held to only four points?
If he's playing for California, a team with about as
much depth as Lake Lagunita in the fall, the answer
is an easy win for Stanford.
Coming into Saturday night's game, Golden Bear
forward Matt Beeuwsaert (pronounce it "beezer" and
you'll be close enough) was tied with Bill Sherwood
of Oregon State for the Pac-10 scoring lead with an
average of 21 points per game. Last weekend, at home
against the Washington schools, the junior transfer
from Notre Dame led all scorers with a total of 43
points in two games.
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery knew the kid
was hot. His answer was Cardinal forward Brian
McSweeney, who held Beeuwsaert to just four points
Saturday on a l-of-6 shooting night. In the first half,
while the Cardinal slowly built an eight-point lead,
Beeuwsaert didn't score a single field goal; his two
points for the half came from the free-throw line.
Part of his problem was fouls. Starting about six
minutes into the half, Beeuwsaert picked up three
fouls in two-and-a-half minutes and was forced to sit
on the bench. But it was McSweeney's defense that
kept Beeuwsaert from scoring while he was on the
court. By the end of the game, Beeuwsaert had played
30 minutes, the second-highest total on his team, and
had scored only four points.
"We stressed that part of their attack all week in
practice," Montgomery said. "Bryan's defense early
helped establish us in the game."
Explaining what happened, California Coach Lou
Campanelli said his star "just didn't shoot the ball
like he's been shooting it. He was rushing the shots.
He put himself in a tough position (with the fouls)."
Asked about McSweeney's defense, Campanelli said,
"I thought Mac did a decent job."
Diplomatically, McSweeney agreed that Beeuwsaert
had "an off-night."
Nominate Mac for an ambassadorship. Come on,
Coach, just "decent?" Good defense is the only thing
that makes a scorer rush his shots. Fouls or no fouls,
Beeuwsaert played nearly the entire second half and
managed only one basket, and that one was what's
called garbage. An offensive rebound bounced to
Beeuwsaert, and he put it back in the basket.
For his part, McSweeney has been given tough
defensive assignments all season. Against Arizona he
had to guard Sean Elliot, and last week against Wash
ington State he was given the hot-shooting David
Sanders. Difficult tasks by any stretch of the imagina
tion, but McSweeney likes the role of defensive stopper.
"They don't look to me for the scoring threat, so
I figure I'll do it on defense," McSweeney said. "I
don't look forward to it (guarding guys like Beeuw
saert). It's something you just go out and do."
At the beginning of the game, McSweeney's strategy
was "to not give him an uncontested outside shot."
He knew that through the course of the game Beeuw
saert would get open on occasion. But by playing him
close to begin with, McSweeney hoped to take away
a little of the Cal forward's confidence.
It worked. "Once he started to miss, he got a little
tentative," McSweeney said. From there, the statistics
tell the rest of the story. McSweeney stayed on him,
and Beeuwsaert finished with only four points. Because
there was no one on the bench to replace the forward,
the lack of scoring from Beeuwsaert made a Cal win
nearly impossible.
"It took away a lot of what they are," McSweeney
said. Saturday, that was certainlv true.
