SAN JOSE - If only the first half
didn't count. ...
Overcoming slow opening-half starts
both Friday and Saturday night, the Stan
ford women's basketball team validated
its No. 11 place in the Associated Press
rankings by handily defeating California
95-71 and San Jose State 55-33 to advance
the Cardinal record to 16-1 overall, 4-1
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The Golden Bears, in a four-way tie
for last place in the league, dropped to
10-7 overall and 1-5 in the Pac-10. The
Spartans hold the bottom spot in the
Pacific Coast Athletic Association and are
now 1-15 on the year.
California came out strong Friday night,
pulling out to an 8-4 lead in a defense
oriented first five minutes of play. Stan
ford came back to post a 19-15 advantage
with 10 minutes left in the half and, after
a prolonged scoring exchange, held a 41-
34 advantage.
The Cardinal got back into the form
of a top-20 team in the second period of
play, jumping out to a 15-point lead after
five minutes and never looking back. The
overwhelmed Bears could do little but
push hard to score and seize the few
opportunities at an open basket that
arose.
"I don't think we came out explosive
enough in the second half, and that was
basically it," Cal freshman forward
Andrea Knapp said. "In the first half 1
expected them (Stanford) to come out a
little more pumped than they were, but
they were up for it in the second half."
For Knapp's coach, the beginning of
the game was not much better than the
end. Although the Golden Bears effec
tively held off Stanford's potent run-and
gun offense, California Coach Gooch
Foster expected more.
"I was a little bit disappointed with our
play in the first half," Foster said. "Against
a team like Stanford, you have to go up
early; you can't struggle from behind. I
thought the first half was our undoing."
"I thought they (Cal) played really well
in the first half," Stanford Coach Tara

VanDerveer said. "I think we were in
foul trouble and weren't in the flow be
cause people didn't relax. We made some
adjustments at halftime, and I think we
played a lot better in the second half."
Among the modifications was an ad
justment to what VanDerveer deemed a
"junk defense" being used by Cal â€” a
formation totally new to the Cardinal that
slowed Stanford's offense in the first half.
Coupled with some inspired play by the
forwards, the halftime adjustments en
abled the Cardinal to reel off 54 points
in the second half while holding a still
fired-up Cal team to 37.
"I thought the key was Trisha Stevens
hitting some key baskets and Katy Steding
getting some key rebounds and scoring,"
VanDerveer said. "1 thought defensively
we got some things going, so they didn't
get second shots like they did in the first
half."
"I think Jennifer Azzi played a much
better second half," she said. "I think she
was a little out of control in the first
half." Nevertheless, Azzi, the Pac-10
leader in assists, finished the game with
16 points, tied with Stevens for team-high
scoring.
Steding amassed an impressive 14
points and a game-high 10 rebounds, the
only double-double of the weekend.
Reserve forwards Kami Anderson and
Tammy Svoboda also put in fine perfor
mances, garnering 11 and 13 points
respectively. )
"Even though I'm just a freshman, I
could feel the intensity," Svoboda said.
"I knew they were going to be up for us,
and wc needed to be up for them."
Junior forward Evon Asforis, no
stranger to the emotional cross-Bay
rivalry, bolstered the Cardinal effort as
well with some tough inside shooting. "I
was pleased with Evon," VanDerveer said.
"I thought Evon went in and played solid
basketball and worked hard."
Surprisingly enough, the Golden Bears'
offense was not led by senior forward
Amanda Ray, the team's leading scorer
and team captain, but by freshman for
wards Knapp and Teresa Palmisano.
Knapp accrued 14 points and grabbed six
boards, while Palmisano exploded for a

game-high 22 points and a team-high
seven rebounds.
Unfortunately for San Jose State, the
Spartans will not get a second crack at
the Cardinal this season. If the first half
Saturday night was any indication of San
Jose's potential, Stanford should be glad
it will not face the Spartans again.
Like the night before, the Cardinal was
slightly sluggish when it came out on the
floor and became prey to the "power-up"
Spartan offense. By the halftime buzzer,
the two teams had struggled to a 24-23
score, with San Jose holding the advan
tage.
The second half was a totally different
ballgame. After a loud halftime meeting,
Stanford simply blew the Spartans off the
court by scoring 32 points while holding
San Jose to a mere nine with some fierce
defensive play by Azzi and fellow Cardinal
guard Sonja Hcnning.
"They played very well in the first half,
and they played kind of like they had
nothing to lose," said VanDerveer. "I
thought they ran their offense very well,
and we were very lackadaisical. We came
in and thought we could just show up
and play, but we're not that good."
After the half, however, Stanford camc
in and played like it had something to
prove. "People have some pride in how
they approach the game, and they came
out and showed it in the second half. I
got mad; maybe they got a little mad,
and they played a little better in the
second half," VanDerveer said.
"I think it was a good lesson, and I'm
glad we didn't have to,learn it the really
hard way," VanDerveer said.
"I think we played much better in the
second half," Asforis said. "I think we
lacked intensity in the first half, but I
think we got it together in the second
half, and we came out to play."
Attitude was clearly the difference Sat
urday night, just as it had been at Berkeley
Friday. "We had to get ourselves on the
ball, and I think we did," Asforis said.
"Overall, the team was working together
better, and when the team works together
everybody looks good."

Showing that special shooting touch that has marked the Cardinal lately, junior Evon
Asforis sinks a free throw.
