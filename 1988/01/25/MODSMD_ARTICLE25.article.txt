## 
### Matthew Bodman Editorial staff 
Getting production from sources both expected and
unexpected, the co-No. 1 Stanford men's tennis team
(along with Georgia) defeated lOth-rated Tennessee
5-2 Saturday and No. 25 Georgia Tech yesterday 5-3
at the Bill Moore Tennis Center in Atlanta to start
its season 2-0.
"I felt if there was a key for the weekend, that it
proved that this team can play tough when things are
on the line," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said. "There
were some guys who had to come through in certain
situations, and they did come through. Two good wins
for us — gutty, gritty and a great start for the year,"
he said.
Saturday against the Volunteers, although Shelby
Cannon (fifth-ranked in the nation in singles) trounced
the Cardinal's Jeff Tarango 6-1, 6-1, the expected
Stanford sources Patrick McEnroe, Martin Blackman
and Jeff Cathrall came through to win their singles
matches and help spark the Cardinal to a 4-2 lead.

In a tight match between two of the nation's best,
McEnroe (12th nationally) defeated Byron Talbot
(fourth) 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.
Cathrall and Eric Peus then finished off Tennessee's
Mike Pittard and Cornelius DeVilliers for the 5-2
victory.
Yesterday against Georgia Tech, however, it was
the unexpected Cardinal sources Glenn Solomon and
Barry Richards that sparked the Stanford win. With
Tarango losing to Tech's Kenny Thorne 6-1, 6-4 and
McEnroe bowing to Bryan Shelton 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, it
was up to the bottom of the lineup to deliver. And
deliver they did.
Demonstrating the Cardinal's depth in the singles
ladder, Richards upended Brad Pybris 7-6, 7-5, and
in the day's most critical match, Solomon edged Franz
Sydow 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 to stake the Cardinal to a 4-2
lead. Blackman and McEnroe polished off Thorne
and Shelton to clinch the Stanford win.
"I have to give him (Solomon) a lot of credit —
for a freshman being in a pressure situation," Gould
said. "I can't say enough about the guys in the bottom
of the lineup."
