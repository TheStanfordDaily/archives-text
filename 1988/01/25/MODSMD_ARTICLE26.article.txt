# Swimming upends UCLA, USC
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
While the beaches along the coast
of Southern California have been
recovering from the tremendous
damage caused by storms there last
week, a different type of tempest
raged in Los Angeles this weekend.
The Stanford women's swimming
squad swamped both UCLA and
USC to run its dual-meet record
to 4-0, 3-0 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference.
The second-ranked Cardinal beat
the Bruins Friday 157-111, then
came back the next day to crush
the Trojans 168-95.
"I thought we swam really well,"
Stanford Coach George Haines
said. "We made about seven
(NCAA) cuts. That's what we're
trying to do."
Sophomores Bethanne Lambert
and Jill Johnson were under the
NCAA qualifying time in the 200-
yard breaststroke in both meets,
while junior Susan Lenth qualified
in that event Saturday.
Against the Bruins, sophomore
Susannah Miller qualified in the
200 backstroke and junior Michelle
Donahue, who hit the NCAA cut
two weeks ago, was again under
the standard. Junior Jenna Johnson
and senior Stacy Shupe have al

ready qualified, as have divers Katie
Connors and Leslie Kleinhekscl.
The big winners against UCLA
were Donahue and Jenna Johnson,
who both won twice. Donahue was
victorious in both the 100 and 200
back, while Johnson won the 200
free and the 100 butterfly.
The other winners for the Car
dinal were Lenth in the 100 breast,
senior Susan Rapp in the 200 fly,
junior Aimee Berzins in the 100
free and Lambert in the 200 breast.
Connors won the 1-meter diving
competition, and the Stanford A
team (senior Jen Pokluda, Rapp,
Jenna Johnson and sophomore
Laurie McLean) won the 200 med
ley relay.
The meet against USC, the
higher-ranked of the Cardinal's two
top-10 weekend opponents, was
even more of a blowout. With Stan
ford competitors winning 12 of the
16 events, the Cardinal coasted to
victory despite the fact that Jenna
Johnson did not compete.
Johnson had cut her foot the pre
vious day in the UCLA pool and
needed five stitches. "It's not real
serious," Haines said, "just some
thing to keep her out of the water
for two or three days."
Both Berzins and Connors were
double winners Saturday; Berzins
took the 50 and 100 free races, and

sophomore Connors won both
diving events. Stanford swept the
diving events as Kleinheksel, a
senior, took second in each, and
junior Amy Biehl scored a pair of
thirds.
The Cardinal continued its year
long dominance of the backstroke
events, sweeping both. In the 100,
Donahue won, Pokluda took second
and McLean claimed third, while
junior Jenny Shannon won the 200.
Shannon was followed by Pokluda
and freshman Jody Smith to com
plete the sweep.
The breaststroke events were
similar, with the Cardinal sweeping
the 200 (Lambert, Jill Johnson and
Lenth) and Lenth and Lambert run
ning 1-2 in the 100.
Also winning for Stanford were
Shupe in the 1650 free, Smith in
the 200 free, the 400 medley relay
team of Donahue, Lenth, Rapp and
Berzins, and the 400 free relay
squad, which was comprised of
Smith, freshman Suzy Buckovich,
Rapp and Berzins.
Haines said he is satisfied with
his team's progress at this point in
the season. "I think everybody's in
really good condition," he said,
"(but) we need more speed for the
Texas (Feb. 6) and Cal (Feb. 13)
meets."
