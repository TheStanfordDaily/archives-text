# Stanford scorches Sun Devils

### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Scoring a resounding win against Arizona State
Saturday, the Stanford men's swimming team proved
it is once again in the running for the national crown.
The 80-33 victory over the fourth-ranked Sun
Devils gave the Cardinal a 5-2 overall dual-meet
record, 2-0 in Pacific 10 Conference competition.
The win also came as proof, after losses to Texas
and Michigan earlier in the season, that the Cardinal
squad is still a championship-caliber squad. Stanford
not only won all but three events, but had three
NCAA-qualifying swims and a nation-leading time
as well.
According to senior tri-captain Matt Nance, it
was an entire team effort. "Everyone swam well,"
he said. "A score like that indicates that the whole
team is swimming fast."
The meet opened with both a win and two NCAA
qualifications. The Cardinal medley-relay team (Jay
Mortenson, Matt Rodgers, Anthony Mosse, Byron
Burson) outdistanced Arizona State by almost a
second, gaining a lead the team would never relin
quish, and 100-yard backstrokers Mortenson and
Sean Murphy (B team) both clocked NCAA qual
ifying swims.
"The first relay set the tone for the meet," said
junior butterflier Rich Roll. "Their relay swam well
against Cal (Friday). The fact that we won shows
we could get the ball rolling and swim a good meet.
We really got the momentum going."
In addition to his 100 back performance, Murphy
also qualified in the 200 back event with a time of
1:48.94. Top freestyler John Witchel swam a 1:38.14
time in the 200 free, the nation's fastest performance
this year, and was very close to qualifying in the
500 free.

"I'm pleased to finally make a little bit of a
breakthrough," Murphy said. "I haven't swum a
1:48 for a while. It was just a matter of a little
more concentration and strategy."
"Murphy, Mortenson and Witchcl had great
swims," Stanford Coach Skip Kenney said. "They
proved that you don't have to wait until the end
of the year to swim fast. Now the next guy can see
this and swim faster. Before this meet we were
missing that soembody to step up and lead the way."
Along with Murphy and Witchcl's victories, Doug
Lillydahl was victorious in the 50 free, Mosse won
the 200 fly, Rodgers took the 200 breaststroke event
and the 400 free relay squad (John 1 lodge, Lillydahl,
Burson, Witchcl) was victorious.
The divers were also successful; junior Matt
Frawley won both the 1-mctcr and the 3-meter
events, and freshman Mike Burton placed third in
the 1-meter and second in the 3-mctcr competition.
Kenney also praised Rodgers" and Mosse's swims.
"Rodgers' 200 breast was great. It was definitely a
case of him seeing others swimming well and getting
caught up in the excitement," he said. "Anthony
is an automatic win every time he steps up to swim
the fly. It's really easy'to take this for granted,
which we shouldn't. He's a guy we can really count
on."
In addition to the many firsts, Stanford placed
a second person in the top three in almost every
event, which it had not been doing in its past few
meets.
The team is gunning for the NCAAs in the spring.
"Training really started to show this meet," Murphy
said. "We're just going to keep getting sharper and
better. Our goal is NCAAs. We want to win dual
meets, but we're geared for the championships."
