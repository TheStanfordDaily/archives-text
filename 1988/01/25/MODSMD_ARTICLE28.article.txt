# Spikers 2-6 against stiff competition

### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
Probably the best thing about the
Stanford men's volleyball squad's
trip to Santa Barbara over the
weekend was that the Cardinal was
allowed to occupy the same court
as some of the most talented vol
leyball teams in the nation and the
world.
Stanford, en route to its 2-6
record and 12th-place finish (in a
field of 24), played four of the top
10 teams in the United States.
Moreover, Stanford competed
against a Brigham Young club team
that had proven itself last year by
defeating eventual NCAA cham

pion UCLA, as well as a team from
Manitoba, Canada, that went on to
win the tournament (beating the
now-No. 2 Bruins 15-0 in the de
ciding game).
"The bad news is we lost some
matches," Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm said. "The good news is that
with some improvement we will be
able to compete very well with these
teams by the end of the year."
Indeed, the Cardinal showed
flashes of brilliance at the tourna
ment, but was unable to mount a
very consistent attack after winning
its first two matches against UC-
Davis and UC-Irvinc. Although
Stanford took Manitoba to the limit
in its third match, losing 15-12 in

the third game, the Cardinal
seemed to fade from then on out.
"We were simply unable to main
tain our concentration level," Sturm
said. "We had a shot against
Manitoba, Northridge, Hawaii and
definitely against San Diego State,
but we beat ourselves. Eight per
cent of the time in volleyball one
team beats itself; we were that team
in four matches this weekend."
Sophomore Dan Hanan agreed.
"We've just got to be more steady.
We were kind of up and down a
lot this weekend and that doesn't
win matches," he said.
Despite the team's inconsistency,
there were some solid individual

performances. According to Sturm,
John Alstrom played "very steady,"
boosting the coach's confidence in
the talented freshman. Hanan,
junior Dave Johnson and sopho
more Parker Blackman all put in
notable efforts as well. Blackman
deserves special commendation, as
he was forced to play all eight
matches in full as the lone Stanford
setter available for action.
"Our top priority (at Santa Bar
bara) was to get some game time,"
Sturm said. "Another priority was
to look at people playing different
positions in different combinations,
while keeping our players fairly well
rested. We accomplished those
goals successfully."
