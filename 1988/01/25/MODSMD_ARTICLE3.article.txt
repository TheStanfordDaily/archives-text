## 
### John Pollack Editorial staff 
Amidst the current campus debate about
Stanford's Western Culture program, the
University has released results of a survey
of freshmen taken last spring that indicates
wide satisfaction among those in the program.
According to the poll, 69 percent of the
respondents said they received "a useful un
derstanding of the development of Western
culture" from the current requirement.
Just over 50 pcrccnt of respondents also
said they were glad they had been required
to take the three-quarter sequence.

Great Works was the most popular choice
among the eight tracks offered last year, with
323 students enrolled. History was second
with 300 students; followed by Values, Tech
nology, Scicncc and Society (VTSS) with 213;
Philosophy with 152; Conflict and Change
with 138; l iterature and the Arts with 123
and Structured Liberal Education (SLE) with
71. An alternative course offered spring quar
ter by Assoc. History Prof. Clay Carson
featuring more works by women and people
of color drew 102 students.
The track that is currently considered to
most include the contributions of
thinkers outside of Western culture
— Conflict and Change — received
the lowest satisfaction rating of all
the Western Culture tracks: 59 per
cent.
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, who
chairs the Committee on Under

graduate Studies, minimized the
significance of this survey on the
current debate. It won't "bear any
relationship" to the Faculty
Senate's decision on the matter, he
said. Heller's committee is urging
the senate to adopt proposed
changes in the Western Culture
program that would eliminate the
program's core reading list and
would reorganize the program to
stress an increased number of works
bv women and minorities under the

name "Cultures, Ideas and Values."
Literature and the Arts received
the highest satisfaction rating of all
the tracks, with % percent of re
spondents calling it a "positive ex
perience." SLE was rated at 93 per
cent, Great Works at 86 percent,
Carson's alternative course at 85
percent, Humanities at 84 percent,
Philosophy at 79 percent, History
at 74 percent and VTSS at 64 per
cent.
