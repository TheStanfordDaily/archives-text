The Stanford wrestling team's
upper weights carried their own
tonnage — and the team's burden
— Friday in Areata to provide a
late rally and overcome Humboldt
State in a narrow victory, 25-23.
"My hat's off to the big guys,"
said Stanford Coach Chris Horpel.
The only Stanford win in the first
half of the meet came during the

126-pound match, when freshman
Lorcn Vigil pulled up with a 3-1
decision in a match Horpel de
scribed as a "totally defensive bat
tle."
"As it turned out, Loren's was a
key victory because both teams won
five matches," Horpel said.
After giving up six points in an
118-pound forfeit, winning at 126
pounds and losing at 134, 142 and
150 pounds, Stanford went into
Steve Yarbrough's 158-pound

match with the team score 18-3 in
favor of Humboldt.
"It was kind of scary with the
score like that going into 158," Vigil
said. "We really needed some
points."
Yarbrough responded to the call
with a second-round pin of Hum
boldt's John Slaughter and reversed
the tide for the Cardinal.
Yarbrough, a sophomore, main
tained his unbeaten 8-0 dual-meet
record with the win. He is 16-4

overall.
The next match was all Stanford
as 167-pound Steve Buddie pum
meled Humboldt's Kevin Buie for
an 18-5 victory. Buddie shares
Yarbrough's undefeated dual-meet
mark with a 7-0-1 record and leads
the Cardinal in total team-point
earnings. Buddie has accrued a
total of 63 team points so far this
season and currently has an overall
