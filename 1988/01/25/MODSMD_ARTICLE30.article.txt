# Grapplers overpower Humboldt St.
## 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team's
upper weights carried their own
tonnage — and the team's burden
— Friday in Areata to provide a
late rally and overcome Humboldt
State in a narrow victory, 25-23.
"My hat's off to the big guys,"
said Stanford Coach Chris Horpel.
The only Stanford win in the first
half of the meet came during the

126-pound match, when freshman
Lorcn Vigil pulled up with a 3-1
decision in a match Horpel de
scribed as a "totally defensive bat
tle."
"As it turned out, Loren's was a
key victory because both teams won
five matches," Horpel said.
After giving up six points in an
118-pound forfeit, winning at 126
pounds and losing at 134, 142 and
150 pounds, Stanford went into
Steve Yarbrough's 158-pound

match with the team score 18-3 in
favor of Humboldt.
"It was kind of scary with the
score like that going into 158," Vigil
said. "We really needed some
points."
Yarbrough responded to the call
with a second-round pin of Hum
boldt's John Slaughter and reversed
the tide for the Cardinal.
Yarbrough, a sophomore, main
tained his unbeaten 8-0 dual-meet
record with the win. He is 16-4

overall.
The next match was all Stanford
as 167-pound Steve Buddie pum
meled Humboldt's Kevin Buie for
an 18-5 victory. Buddie shares
Yarbrough's undefeated dual-meet
mark with a 7-0-1 record and leads
the Cardinal in total team-point
earnings. Buddie has accrued a
total of 63 team points so far this
season and currently has an overall
record of 15-4-1.
"Coming into the upper weights
is like putting our 'fearsome four
some' on the mats," Buddie said.
"After losing the first few matches
I get pumped to really wrestle well.
I feel like I'm being counted on."
At 177 pounds, Ron Perry, who
is an Areata native, returned home
to completely dominate Humboldt's
Mike Nichols with a :51 fall. As
Horpel put it, Perry was "really
psyched up" for his homecoming.
Terry Mclntyre stepped onto the
mat for his 190-pound match ex

pecting to have a rematch with
Humboldt's John Mclntire. Mcln
tyre had beaten Mclntire in the
finals of the "Aggie" tournament
last weekend. Mclntyrc, however,
pitted his talents against Perry's
former Areata teammate, Justin
Sande. In a strange coaching move,
Humboldt moved Mclntire to the
heavyweight bracket and had
Sanders move from the 177- to the
190-pound bracket.
The unfailing Mclntyre put his
big Mac-attack to work and
emerged from the match with his
seventh pin of the season in 4:54.
Mclntyre leads all Cardinal
wrestlers in pins (Vigil, Yarbrough
and Buddie arc tied for second with
three) and is second in total team

points, one-half of a point behind
Buddie. The victory Friday was his
17th win this season.
With the 190-pound victory, Stan
ford was assured of the meet win
with a seven-point cushion. Trent
Smith wrestled Mclntire in the
heavyweight bracket and lost by a
technical fall that gave Humboldt
five points and the Cardinal a two
point victory.
"1 was hoping to do better in
some of the lightweight matches,"
Horpel said. "We're just not as con
sistent as I want to be. But the
team's still making good progress."
Stanford will wrestle again Friday
when it takes on Fullerton State in
Maples Pavilion.
