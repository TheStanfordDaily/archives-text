# Women's gymnastics captures Cal Invite

### Karen Gryler 
BERKELEY - Becky Ashton
of the Stanford women's gym
nastics team paused; she had
missed the trick she was sup
posed to perform in her uneven
bar routine. Ashton's ingenuity
came through, though, and with
some quick adjustments she was
back on track to finish her
routine with a good dismount.
Ashton's recovery symbolized
Saturday's California Invita
tional meet for the Cardinal:
Mistakes were covered up, and
the team came through to deliver
a victory. It may have been the
Cal Invitational, but it was the
Stanford women's gymnastics
team that was the star. With a
score of 175.60, the Stanford
squad soundly beat Cal 174.45,
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo 169.45
and Chico State 133.95.
Stanford Coach Homer Sar
dina competed with a young
team, with only a few veterans
to round it out, but said he was
pleased with the results. "I used
this meet to test our depth and
limits. We're juggling the squad
around to see what works best
for us," he said.
"I needed to put the younger
people out there to see what
level they perform at. Now I
know if we have a situation
where some of our more expe
rienced girls can't compete, I
have a great alternative."
The Cardinal, with clean tum
bling and graceful dance as its
trademarks, started the meet off
on the right foot with a solid
performance on the floor exer
cise. Seniors Alison McGann
and Cindy Boyd led the way with
scores of 9.2 and 9.0 respectively.
Sophomores Becky Ashton and
Susan Banta followed close be
hind with 8.95 and 8.9 perfor

mances.
Undaunted at competing in
only her second collegiate com
petition, freshman Christie
Vilastro performed with confi
dence and mile-high tumbling to
receive an 8.7.
The next event, the vault, had
more of the same in store for
the team — consistently good
performances from each team
member. Again, McGann's tal
ent showed through with a 9.05
vault, followed close behind by
the rest of the team. After the
first two events, Stanford took a
commanding lead.
But the uneven bars proved
harder for the Cardinal than it
had expected. There were
several falls, but the team did
all it could to make up for them.
Help came from redshirt soph
omore Marietta Frey, who put
in a solid 8.65 routine, and the
event culminated in seemingly
effortless 9.0 and 9.15 routines
from Banta and McGann. Banta
was particularly impressive,
showing consistency while per
foming difficult routines.
Marred by five falls during the
beam competition, the Cardinal
nevertheless came through with
solid dance routines to hold onto
the lead.
When it was all over, Stanford
had done just what it needed to.
McGann's consistent perfor
mances earned her the highest
individual title of the night —
all-around winner of the meet
with a 36.25 total. "I felt pretty
good out there," McGann said.
"I was more consistent and con
fident this meet."
"There's going to be some
friendly competition during prac
tice now that the freshmen have
proven themselves," said Asst.
Coach Sam Shaw.
