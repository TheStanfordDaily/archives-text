## Nearly all freshmen plan to seek advanced degrees 
### Hsuan Sze 
Although more than 95 percent of Stanford's
current freshman class say they hope to earn ad
vanced degrees, many will change their minds by
the time they are seniors, according to a recent poll.
During the past five years Stanford freshmen
have become increasingly interested in continuing
their education beyond the undergraduate level,
according to a survey conducted by the UCLA
Institutional Research Program.
But records at the Registrar's Office indicate
that the number of Stanford seniors who say they
plan to enter professional and graduate schools has
remained essentially unchanged — at 33 percent
— over the past five to 10 years, said Damodharan
Namboothiri, director of research for the Registrar's
Office.

Namboothiri said he based his findings on col
leeted information from senior surveys and records
of graduate school achievement tests, such as the
MCAT and the GRE. Namboothiri admitted,
however, that his records may not be entirely ac
curate because many of the students surveyed may
later decide not to go to graduate school.
"We know the intentions (of seniors who respond
to the surveys and those who apply to graduate
programs), but we do not know what they actually
end up doing," Namboothiri said.
In recent years, more Stanford undergraduates
have stopped out after receiving their bachelor's
degree before entering graduate programs, he said.
The UCLA report was part of a national survey
involving 278 four-year colleges, 53 universities and
59 two-year colleges.
