# Stanford gets Olympic boost
## Officials inspect Farm, praise Bay Area athletic facilities 
### Leslie Hatamiya Staff writer 
Stanford University, along with several
Bay Area sports facilities, received rave
reviews this weekend from U.S. Olympic
Committee members assessing the area's
bid to host the 19% Summer Games.
"The Bay Area came out superlatively"
in the site selection committee's two-day
tour of various sports facilities located
from San Francisco to San Jose, said state
Sen. Qucntin Kopp, who chairs the Bay
Area Sports Organizing Committee, the
organization spearheading the Bay Area
bid.
The Bay Area, including Stanford, is
one of four sites being considered for the
United States' entry bid to host the 1996
games. The Bay Area was the first of the
four sites that the committee will visit,
Kopp said. The other U.S. cities being
considered arc Atlanta, Nashville and
Minneapolis-St. Paul.
According to Kopp, the reaction of the
nine-member delegation "was quite en
thusiastic" after spending Friday and Sat
urday visiting athletic sites, including
Stanford Stadium.
If the Bay Area is chosen as the site
for the games, Stanford would host the
opening and closing ceremonies, the track
and field events and the swimming com
petition. Stanford would also house be
tween 7000 and 8000 athletes.
Because 1996 will be the 100 th anni
versary of the modern Olympics, Athens,

Greece, which hosted the games in 1896,
will probably be chosen as the site of the
'96 games. But if the Bay Area is selected
by the United States Olympic Committee
as the U.S. entry for the 1996 games, its
chances of being the U.S. entry in future
Olympic years would be strengthened,
Kopp said.
Although Kopp said the Bay Area has
"a good chance" of securing the U.S.
entry, Stanford is only reluctantly
cooperating with the Bay Area's bid effort.
Despite weekend news reports stating
that the University has become more en
thusiastic about the prospect of hosting
the games, Stanford officials contended
yesterday that Stanford has not changed
its initial position of cooperating with, but
not actively campaigning for, the Bay Area
bid.
In September, Athletic Director Andy
Geiger stated Stanford's position on the
bid as "cooperating and participating at
this level . . . (but) we are not wildly
enthusiastic about it."
"The University wants to be helpful as
part of the Bay Area," said Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Norm Robinson, who
accompanied the U.S. Olympic Commit
tee members on their tour of Stanford.
Robinson added, however, that making
sure the games would not interfere with
the University's own programs during the
summer is a top priority.
Robinson said the timing of the Olym
pics may present a problem if the Uni
versity were to host the Games, since

Stanford's usual summer schedule would
probably conflict with the time when the
athletes would be housed in student
residences.
"It would be quite a disruption from
our usual (summer session) schedule," he
said.
According to Alan Cummings, senior
associate director of Athletics, "Our par
ticipation has been as representatives of
the Bay Area, and our intention has been
to be as helpful with the committee's visit
to the Bay Area as possible."
Cummings said he was confident that
Stanford could "do a good job at hosting
events at Stanford Stadium," considering
the University's experience in hosting the
Super Bowl in 1985 and nine soccer events
as part of the 1984 Summer Olympics.
However, Cummings said he was unsure
about the University's ability to host water
sports events because of complications
with crowd control, housing and traffic.
The close location of the deGuerre Pool
complex to Stanford Stadium could create
some problems, he said.
"It's a little awesome to think of having
a full stadium twice a day," Cummings
said, "but I am confident of coming up
with a plan that would accomplish all of
the logistics" of hosting the sports events.
The U.S. Olympic Committee Executive
Board is scheduled to announce its deci
sion on the U.S. nominee on April 29,
and the International Olympic Committee
will name the official site for the 1996
Summer Games in January 1990.
