# Chace plan loses a supporter
## Prof, will not back alternative Area One legislation 
### Brooke Harrington Elizabeth Howton 
Feminist Studies Chair Diane Mid
dlebrook withdrew her support last week
from the Chace counterproposal on West
ern Culture, writing that "a vote in favor
of retaining a core list is a vote against
the spirit of criticism in which the whole
review of Western Culture was under
taken."
Middlebrook's letter came as the long
awaited debate over changing the Area
One, or Western Culture, requirement
came to a head in the Faculty Senate.
The counterproposal was put forth ear
lier this month by English Prof. William
Chace and 24 other faculty members in
an effort to block passage of a plan
prepared by the Western Culture Task
Force and the Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies (CUS).
The Chace plan calls for maintenance
of a core reading list that would include
works by "women and persons of color,"
whereas the CUS plan would abolish the
core list and require that contributions
to society made by women and minorities
be emphasized in a reorganized program
to be known as "Cultures, Ideas and
Values." Debate opened on the two
proposals in the senate Thursday.
Middlebrook, an English professor, had
signed the document in draft form but
withdrew her support before it was pre
sented to the senate.
Chace declined to comment on Mid
dlebrook's decision but said "wisdom will
prevail."
In a letter to Academic Secretarv Clara

Bush, who handles administrative duties
for the senate, Middlebrook acknowl
edged the importance of "a common in
tellectual experience" among students but
said she was disturbed by the lack of
"critical understanding" in the commit
tee's proposed changes.
In particular, Middlebrook wrote that

the proposal does not address the "lack
of awareness of how assumptions about
gender inhabit everv book on the reading
list."
"This lack cannot be remedied by add
ing a few more texts by women," she said.
