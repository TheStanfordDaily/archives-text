# Few other schools require Western culture courses
## 
### Vivian Rogers Staff writer 
As a debate rages here at Stanford over
which authors and cultures should be in
cluded in the undergraduate Western Cul
ture program, many other universities
avoid the controversy entirely by requiring
merely that students complete a certain
amount of coursework in the humanities.
Most universities do not follow Stan
ford's approach of designing courses that
deal specifically with Western or non-
Western cultures.
"Focusing on Western civilization only
and not taking into account other cultures
is a big mistake in this age," said Philip
Khoury, associate dean of the School of
Humanities and Social Science at MIT.
"We're not surprised about what has hap
pened to Stanford's (Western Culture)
program."
To fulfill MlT's general requirements,

students must take eight classes spread
over three areas of study: the humanities,
the arts and social science. Last spring,
MIT reduced the number of courses that
normally fulfill these requirements in or
der to offer more courses on different
cultures.
Those universities that have Western
culture requirements similar to Stanford's
tend to have well-established courses that
meet with little protest.
Both the University of Chicago and
Columbia University have strong Western
civilization programs that go back almost
to the founding of each institution.
While the University of Chicago
decided last year to modify its program,
the change did not include offering more
courses in non-Western cultures. Rather,
the university now requires two one-year
courses — one "sequence in the
humanities and (one in) social
science," said Lewis Fortner, ad
viser to the Chicago's Undergrad
uate College. Before, two two-year
courses that dealt with "the great
classics" were mandatory.
The absence of any formal non-
Western culture requirement has
so far not sparked any student
protest at Chicago.
"I can't seem to remember any
sort of protest besides an occasional
letter to the editor," Fortner said.

"It may be because [the university
offers] ample opportunity to study
both Western civilization and the
Third World" outside of its require
ments.
In contrast, students protesting
the lack of any mandatory ethnic
courses at the UC-Santa Cruz
succeeded in changing the univer
sity's requirements two years ago.
In addition to six courses in the
humanities, natural sciences and so
cial sciences, students at Santa Cruz
are now required to complete at
least one course that focuses on
the Third World.
Today, Santa Cruz is one of the
onlv universities in the United

States to maintain such a require
ment.
UC-Santa Barbara has a required
Western culture program similar to
Stanford's.
"There are two courses in West
ern civilization and one in civiliza
tion and thought," said Britt
Johnson, dean of the College of
Arts and Letters at Santa Barbara.
"While students are here they must
have one course in a non-Western
culture which they can choose to
also fulfill another requirement."
"We are now discussing the issue
of an ethnic studies requirement
focused on California because of
student interest," Johnson said.
