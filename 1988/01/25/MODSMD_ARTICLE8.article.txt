Israelis protest govt, actions
TEL AVIV, Israel — Tens of thousands of Israelis demonstrated
for an end to Israel's "iron fist" policy in the occupied territories
Saturday, presenting the government with its most significant chal
lenge from inside the country during the current outbreak of unrest
among the Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
In Tel Aviv, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Jewish citizens took
part in the biggest protest march here since Israel's invasion of
Lebanon in 1982. And in a gesture of protest in Nazareth, an Arab
member of the Knesset (Parliament) resigned from the troubled
Labor Alignment in the surprise climax to a noisy but peaceful
anti-government demonstration by an estimated 12,000 to 15,000
Arab citizens of Israel.
The demonstrations came after more than six weeks of violent
protests in the occupied areas, during which at least 36 Palestinians
have died from Israeli gunfire. Hundreds of other Palestinians have
been injured by gunshots or beatings, and as many as 300,000 at
a time have been restricted to their homes under curfews.
The Tel Aviv protest was sponsored by the Peace Now group,
a loose amalgam of leftist and moderate organizations and individ
uals which had also organized demonstrations against Israel's 1982
invasion of Lebanon. Only a 1982 Peace Now rally that drew an
estimated 400,000 Israelis was bigger in numbers than Saturday's
affair.
Sandinistas slioot down cargo plane
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Sandinista forces shot down a cargo
plane that was dropping war material to U.S.-backed guerrillas,
government and rebel spokesmen said yesterday.
The DC-6 aircraft crashed in Southeastern Nicaragua after dark
Saturday with 10 crewmen aboard, according to reports from the
scene.
President Daniel Ortega said that a Sandinista counterinsurgency
battalion captured one crewman and found the bodies of four
others 23 miles east of San Carlos. The other five were being
sought in the jungle area near the Costa Rican border, 125 miles
southeast of here.
It was the first contra supply plane downed since October 1986.
Since then the rebels have gained the initiative in the war by using
CIA-supervised night parachute drops to keep about 10,000 troops
inside Nicaragua replenished with ammunition, medicine, uniforms,
boots, food and cash.
Lt. Col. Roberto Calderon, a senior Sandinista commander, told
reporters who were flown to the crash scene yesterday that the
plane was hit by two portable SAM-7 missiles.
Western military specialists said that it did not seem to pose a
wider threat to the contra flights. Portable missiles, long part of
the Sandinista arsenal, have been largely ineffective against aircraft
because they are not guided by radar.
Even so, Ortega warned President Reagan, "Just as this plane
has been shot down by our combatants, your policy (of aiding the
contras) has been shot down, has been destroyed. Even if [Congress]
votes for new funds, they are not going to defeat our revolution."
Senate begins treaty ratification
WASHINGTON — The new U.S.-Soviet treaty banning ground
launched intermediate range nuclear weapons will be formally sub
mitted to the Senate today, with supporters confident that it will
be ratified but concerned that it may become a vehicle to block
potential accord on deep reductions in intercontinental ballistic
missiles.
With the Democratic leadership and the Reagan administration
allied, congressional observers last week predicted that the pact
will easily receive the two-thirds majority necessary to put it into
force.
Nevertheless, the White House, concerned over the possibility
of "killer amendments," enlisted former Sen. John Tower (R-Tcxas),
a one-time chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and
more recently a U.S. arms negotiator, as a special troubleshooter.
As two months of hearings and debate open before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, the administration will send Secretary
of State George Shultz to Capitol Hill as its lead-off witness. At
the same time, Senate majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) and
minority leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) will appear to stress their own
endorsement of the agreement signed last month by President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
A chief concern of treaty supporters is that the agreement could
be jeopardized by efforts to make its ratification conditional upon
righting the imbalance in conventional forces in Europe. Most
analysts believe that the Soviet Union and its allies hold an advantage
over the 16 NATO nations in most categories of non-nuclear
weaponry.
NATO allies will aid in mine sweep
WASHINGTON — Five NATO allies — Britain, France, Italy,
the Netherlands and Belgium — have agreed to help the United
States make a "clean sweep" of mines from the Persian Gulf,
working through an informal unified command, Department of
Defense officials said yesterday.
The plan is designed to keep five minesweepers operating in the
gulf at any one time, the officials said, on a timetable sufficiently
frequent to cover the entire area and keep shipping lanes relatively
secure.
The officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified,
said that the cooperation of the allied navies is especially welcome
in offsetting congressional criticism that Washington's monthly cost
of $25 to $30 million is too heavy a share of the cost for protecting
oil shipments that go largely to Europe and Japan.
Rear Adm. J.S. Tichelman, naval attache of the Netherlands
Embassy here, said that the Northern European allies have worked
together in the North Sea for decades and have continued to do
so since undertaking their mission in the Persian Gulf.
Sparks fly at Democratic debate
DURHAM, N.H. — The seven Democratic presidential candi
dates traded jabs and jibes for two hours yesterday afternoon in
one of the most contentious debates of the 1988 campaign.
The two putative front-runners, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Mas
sachusetts and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, came under the
most sustained attack for their proposals on taxes and trade.
But the sparks flew fastest when Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. attacked former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt's proposed 5-percent
sales tax as "inherently regressive" and "essentially a Republican
idea."
Babbitt, who was the most aggressive and critical of the candidates,
repeatedly interrupted Gore to deny the charge. "That's across the
line," he sputtered angrily. "No one's ever questioned my credentials
as a Democrat."
"Then don't put out a Republican idea," Gore quickly replied.
The two-hour nationally televised debate at the University of
New Hampshire was sponsored by the state Democratic Party. With
barely two weeks until the Feb. 8 lowa caucuses, it was the fourth
debate in the last 10 days, with a fifth scheduled tonight in Boston.

sales tax as "inherently regressive" and "essentially a Republican
idea."
Babbitt, who was the most aggressive and critical of the candidates,
repeatedly interrupted Gore to deny the charge. "That's across the
line," he sputtered angrily. "No one's ever questioned my credentials
as a Democrat."
"Then don't put out a Republican idea," Gore quickly replied.
The two-hour nationally televised debate at the University of
New Hampshire was sponsored by the state Democratic Party. With
barely two weeks until the Feb. 8 lowa caucuses, it was the fourth
debate in the last 10 days, with a fifth scheduled tonight in Boston.

Israelis protest govt, actions
TEL AVIV, Israel — Tens of thousands of Israelis demonstrated
for an end to Israel's "iron fist" policy in the occupied territories
Saturday, presenting the government with its most significant chal
lenge from inside the country during the current outbreak of unrest
among the Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
In Tel Aviv, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Jewish citizens took
part in the biggest protest march here since Israel's invasion of
Lebanon in 1982. And in a gesture of protest in Nazareth, an Arab
member of the Knesset (Parliament) resigned from the troubled
Labor Alignment in the surprise climax to a noisy but peaceful
anti-government demonstration by an estimated 12,000 to 15,000
Arab citizens of Israel.
The demonstrations came after more than six weeks of violent
protests in the occupied areas, during which at least 36 Palestinians
have died from Israeli gunfire. Hundreds of other Palestinians have
been injured by gunshots or beatings, and as many as 300,000 at
a time have been restricted to their homes under curfews.
The Tel Aviv protest was sponsored by the Peace Now group,
a loose amalgam of leftist and moderate organizations and individ
uals which had also organized demonstrations against Israel's 1982
invasion of Lebanon. Only a 1982 Peace Now rally that drew an
estimated 400,000 Israelis was bigger in numbers than Saturday's
affair.
Sandinistas slioot down cargo plane
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Sandinista forces shot down a cargo
plane that was dropping war material to U.S.-backed guerrillas,
government and rebel spokesmen said yesterday.
The DC-6 aircraft crashed in Southeastern Nicaragua after dark
Saturday with 10 crewmen aboard, according to reports from the
scene.
President Daniel Ortega said that a Sandinista counterinsurgency
battalion captured one crewman and found the bodies of four
others 23 miles east of San Carlos. The other five were being
sought in the jungle area near the Costa Rican border, 125 miles
southeast of here.
It was the first contra supply plane downed since October 1986.
Since then the rebels have gained the initiative in the war by using
CIA-supervised night parachute drops to keep about 10,000 troops
inside Nicaragua replenished with ammunition, medicine, uniforms,
boots, food and cash.
Lt. Col. Roberto Calderon, a senior Sandinista commander, told
reporters who were flown to the crash scene yesterday that the
plane was hit by two portable SAM-7 missiles.
Western military specialists said that it did not seem to pose a
wider threat to the contra flights. Portable missiles, long part of
the Sandinista arsenal, have been largely ineffective against aircraft
because they are not guided by radar.
Even so, Ortega warned President Reagan, "Just as this plane
has been shot down by our combatants, your policy (of aiding the
contras) has been shot down, has been destroyed. Even if [Congress]
votes for new funds, they are not going to defeat our revolution."
Senate begins treaty ratification
WASHINGTON — The new U.S.-Soviet treaty banning ground
launched intermediate range nuclear weapons will be formally sub
mitted to the Senate today, with supporters confident that it will
be ratified but concerned that it may become a vehicle to block
potential accord on deep reductions in intercontinental ballistic
missiles.
With the Democratic leadership and the Reagan administration
allied, congressional observers last week predicted that the pact
will easily receive the two-thirds majority necessary to put it into
force.
Nevertheless, the White House, concerned over the possibility
of "killer amendments," enlisted former Sen. John Tower (R-Tcxas),
a one-time chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and
more recently a U.S. arms negotiator, as a special troubleshooter.
As two months of hearings and debate open before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, the administration will send Secretary
of State George Shultz to Capitol Hill as its lead-off witness. At
the same time, Senate majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) and
minority leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) will appear to stress their own
endorsement of the agreement signed last month by President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
A chief concern of treaty supporters is that the agreement could
be jeopardized by efforts to make its ratification conditional upon
righting the imbalance in conventional forces in Europe. Most
analysts believe that the Soviet Union and its allies hold an advantage
over the 16 NATO nations in most categories of non-nuclear
weaponry.
NATO allies will aid in mine sweep
WASHINGTON — Five NATO allies — Britain, France, Italy,
the Netherlands and Belgium — have agreed to help the United
States make a "clean sweep" of mines from the Persian Gulf,
working through an informal unified command, Department of
Defense officials said yesterday.
The plan is designed to keep five minesweepers operating in the
gulf at any one time, the officials said, on a timetable sufficiently
frequent to cover the entire area and keep shipping lanes relatively
secure.
The officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified,
said that the cooperation of the allied navies is especially welcome
in offsetting congressional criticism that Washington's monthly cost
of $25 to $30 million is too heavy a share of the cost for protecting
oil shipments that go largely to Europe and Japan.
Rear Adm. J.S. Tichelman, naval attache of the Netherlands
Embassy here, said that the Northern European allies have worked
together in the North Sea for decades and have continued to do
so since undertaking their mission in the Persian Gulf.
Sparks fly at Democratic debate
DURHAM, N.H. — The seven Democratic presidential candi
dates traded jabs and jibes for two hours yesterday afternoon in
one of the most contentious debates of the 1988 campaign.
The two putative front-runners, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Mas
sachusetts and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, came under the
most sustained attack for their proposals on taxes and trade.
But the sparks flew fastest when Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. attacked former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt's proposed 5-percent
sales tax as "inherently regressive" and "essentially a Republican
idea."
