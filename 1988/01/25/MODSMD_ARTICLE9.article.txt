## Contra aid showdown begins 
### 
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Jim
Wright (D-Texas) said yesterday that he would
consider a proposal from President Reagan to
extend humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan con
tras and at the same time put military aid in
escrow for use only under specified conditions.
The Speaker also said during a television
interview that any action to delay the House
vote on the administration's request for contra
aid that is scheduled for Feb. 3 must be initiated
by the president. Reagan is expected to deliver
a strong appeal for the aid in the State of the
Union message he will deliver at 9 p.m. EST
tonight.
There was no hint of compromise yesterday
when a reporter asked the president on his
return from a weekend at Camp David, Md.,
whether he expects Congress to approve military
aid. Reagan's reply was a laconic "We'll try."
When asked if the administration is proposing
the escrow procedure for lethal aid, Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, who appeared
before Wright on ABC's televised "This Week
with David Brinkley," said, "We're still working
on the package." The administration's proposal,
he said, "will be very carefully tailored to support
the (Central American peace) negotiations."
Abrams made it clear, however, that the ad
ministration will be seeking "direct military aid,"
as well as non-lethal aid. He did not comment
directly on the recommendation put forward
Friday by 19 middle-of-the-road Democratic con
gressmen in a letter to President Reagan that
he delay his aid request pending further develop
ments in the Central American peace process.
But he strongly advocated continued pressure
to extract concessions from Nicaragua's Marxist

led Sandinista regime.
Two senior Republican Senators, Alan
Simpson of Wyoming, the minority whip, and
Ted Stevens of Alaska, his predecessor in the
post, indicated readiness to go along with defer
ment of the vote, an approach also suggested
by Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), the Senate's
minority leader. The Senate is committed to
vote the day after the House acts — provided
the measure passes the House.
Simpson, interviewed on NBC's "Meet the
Press," said that he would make up his mind
on the desirability of postponing a vote after
he hears "the intensity of the president in the
State of the Union address." Personally, Simpson
added, "I would not be adverse to that at all."
Stevens, appearing on the ABC program, said,
in apparent reference to Senate Republicans,
"We would accept a delay," but he did not think
one would be acceptable to those House Dem
ocrats "who oppose any aid to the contras." He
said he expected Reagan to "come up with some
sort of escrow fund concept."
Election-year overtones were evident in many
of the comments, but they were frankly stated
by Abrams, who accused House Democratic
leaders of proposing to "hand the Sandinistas
their ultimate objective" out of a "desire to beat
the president as a political issue and kill off the
contras as a political issue without regard to
the potential impact on the negotiations" now
under way in Central America.
Abrams agreed with a questioner that infla
tion, which he estimated at 1800 percent, now
threatens the Sandinista regime with collapse.
But he said that the Soviet Union now "keeps
it on its feet."

"The real question," Abrams said, "is whether
we're going to let the Soviets buy domination
of Central America, or whether we're going to
continue supporting the Nicaraguans who want
to fight to win their country back."
Asked whether loss of the contra-aid proposal
would hand Republicans a political issue,
Abrams said that was "generally correct."
Wright argued that the views of Central Amer
ican presidents should be taken into consider
ation in reaching a decision on putting arms
funds into escrow.
"I think if this administration would spend
just a fraction of the time trying to encourage
both sides to be forthcoming and create a cease
fire, we'd have peace," Wright said.
The speaker repeatedly refused to say cat
egorically whether he would support a measure
funding humanitarian aid without provisions for
lethal aid. Facing the same question later at a
Democratic conference at White Sulphur
Springs, W.Va., he told reporters: "I don't want
to be hypothetical; let's see what the president
recommends."
Reached at the same conference, House
majority whip Tony Coclho (D-Calif.) and Rep.
David Bonior (D-Mich.) agreed that the House
vote will turn on the final decisions reached by
about 50 House members who have yet to com
mit themselves on the measure. Bonior said he
had talked to most of the Democrats who signed
the letter to Reagan urging deferment of the
vote and said it was his "feeling that they will
not be with the president" if the vote is Feb. 3.
