# Officials deny dangers posed by animal lab

Stanford officials maintain that the proposed Re
search Animal Facility II will not be an environmental
hazard, despite continued claims by animal rights
groups that the draft environmental impact report
(EIR) on the facility is flawed.
The EIR, released Dec. 21 and reviewed at a Santa
Clara Planning Commission hearing Jan. 21, states
there would be no "unavoidable significant adverse
impacts" to the environment resulting from the con
struction of RAF 11. The County Board of Supervisors
will vote in March whether to accept the report.
Santa Clara county officials have not released their
opinions of the EIR and would not comment last
night on its chances for approval.
But a Stanford official close to the project predicted
the EIR will be approved by the Board. "I imagine
[the Board of Supervisors] will approve the EIR,"
project manager Stephen Glenn said. "There is no
reason not to pass it. It will not cause negative envi
ronmental impacts."
The Palo Alto Humane Society claims the EIR is
flawed in several aspects and in many cases violates
state law.
Patricia Elsen, a director of the Palo Alto Humane
Society, said the project description contained in the
EIR is "inaccurate and insufficient and too narrowly
scoped." She said RAF II has not been discussed in
association with Research Animal Facility I and the
Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine (CMGM),
though the three buildings will be linked by under
ground tunnels.
She claimed the officials are examining "little pieces"
of the project and "must consider the cumulative
impact of these pieces" by studying the work the three
facilities have in common.
Glenn said RAF I, RAF II and CMGM do not
have to be studied as a whole because they are "com
pletely separate projects in separate buildings."
Elsen claimed researchers will
perform "biohazardous" work at
RAF 11, which will not contain suf
ficient protective devices to prevent
harmful bacteria from being
released into the air.
Elsen also said the University vi
olated the California Environmen
tal Quality Act by failing to give
contrary expert opinion to the find
ings in the EIR. Glenn refused to
comment on this charge.

According to Larry Horton, as
sociate vice president for Public Af
fairs, the delays caused by the EIR
have cost the University $700,000.
One of the factors prompting an
order for an EIR was the concern
over recombinant DNA research to
be done at RAF 11.
Dr. Paul Berg, professor of bioc
hemistry at the Medical Center,
told the county planning commis
sion that DNA research is not
hazardous. "There is a wide and
general consensus that recombinant
DNA carries little or no risk," he
said.
