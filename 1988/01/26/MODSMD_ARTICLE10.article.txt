# Reagan gives State of Union speech
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan last
night gave a glowing assessment of the state of
the Union, telling a joint session of Congress
and a national television audience that his ad
ministration had, "at a critical moment in world
history, reclaimed and restored the American
dream."
In his final State of the Union address, Reagan
said, "Let's make this the best of eight.... I
don't buy the idea that this is the last year of
anything, because we're not talking here tonight
about registering temporary gains, but ways of
making permanent our successes."
The president called for "a bipartisan con
sensus for the cause of world freedom" that
would support both a strategic nuclear arms
treaty with the Soviet Union arid continued
assistance to anti-communist "freedom fighters"
in Nicaragua and Afghanistan. But Reagan was
restrained in his appeal for new aid for the
Nicaraguan contras and acknowledged that
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has
taken some steps toward democratic reform.
The president said he will submit a new aid
request tomorrow that "would sustain the
freedom fighters" and challenge the Sandinistas
"to take irreversible steps toward democracy."
White House officials said the aid package will
total about $45 billion, including $5 billion in
military aid that would be put into escrow.
In the Democratic response, House Speaker

Jim Wright of Texas and Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd of West Virginia sought to paint
a sharp contrast between the priorities of the
Democratic-led Congress and the final-year
policies of an administration they think has lost
its ability to hold sway on Capitol Hill.
Reagan's speech last night was designed to
recapture the emotional fervor of the campaign
that brought him to the White House rather
than to proclaim a new agenda, aides said.
Reagan said the nation is "strong, prosperous,
at peace and ... free." He concluded the address
with familiar lines, saying that the nation remains
"a shining city on a hill" for future generations.
And as conservatives had wanted him to do,
Reagan restated his commitment to the unful
filled items of his social agenda, including an
anti-abortion "human life" amendment to the
Constitution and another amendment allowing
school prayer.
The president also called for passage of a
constitutional amendment mandating a federal
balanced budget, thus restating the theme of
his first State of the Union message in 1982
that "the federal government is too big and it
spends too much money." The federal budget
deficit was nearly $80 billion in fiscal 1981 and
is now $148 billion; the national debt was $715
billion when Reagan took office and is now
nearly $2 trillion.
In an approach alternately conciliatory and

critical, Reagan called upon Congress to enforce
the two-year compromise budget agreement
reached last month that is designed to reduce
federal deficits bv 576 billion over two years.
He claimed that "the budget process has broken
down," producing "monstrous continuing resolu
tions that pack hundreds of billions of dollars
worth of spending into one bill — and a federal
government on the brink of default."
But while saying that he would veto continuing
resolutions in the future, Reagan called upon
Congress to avoid a confrontation on fiscal issues
in his final year in office.
"Let's change all this," said Reagan of the
budget process. "Instead of a presidential budget
that gets discarded and a congressional budget
resolution that is not enforced, why not a simple
partnership, a joint agreement that sets out the
spending priorities within the available dead
lines?"
Reagan also sent Congress a 39-page legisla
tive message that includes strong criticism of
pending legislation that would broaden federal
power to combat racial discrimination in schools
and other institutions receiving federal funds.
The legislative message also declared that "the
most important piece of unfinished business" is
to restore the tax break for capital gains that
was eliminated by the 1986 tax act.
