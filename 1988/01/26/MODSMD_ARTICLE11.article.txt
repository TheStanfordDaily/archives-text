# Workshop confronts rules of sex 'game'
## 
### Angle Kim Staff writer 
There is an important difference
between having sex and making
love, visiting sociologist Jerry Talley
told a group of more than 70 stu
dents attending a workshop last
night in Florence Moore Hall.
Sex differs from making love in
that sex is a mechanical and bio
logical human function, while
making love involves caring and
consideration for the other party's
desires, Talley said. "One is not
necessarily better than the other,
but the problem arises when one
person thinks they're making love
and the other thinks they're having
sex. . . . That's painful," he said.
This misunderstanding is a result
of distinct sexual roles and images,
according to Talley, who said men
have conformed to the aggressive,
"macho" image and women have
responded with passivity.
He said that in recent years there
has been a "swing toward the con
servative end," both politically and
socially. "Now, I hear girls saying
that they're not comfortable with
asking guys out," he said. "I didn't
hear that eight years ago. We fought
the sexual revolution and lost."
According to Talley, males and

females play a game with each other
in sexual situations which may
result in unpleasant consequences,
such as rape. Referring to yester
day's Daily article on date and gang
rape, he said these situations arise
because of a lack of communication
between the parties involved, as
well as the dangerous game be
tween the sexes.
In order to illustrate this sexual
game — frequently unnoticed by
the participants — he divided the
room in half by drawing a line with
a string and placed eight males on
one side and eight females on the
other. The males then had to at
tempt to get the females to cross
the line either with verbal persua
sion or force while staying on their
own side, while the females tried
to stay on their own side.
After the game was over, the
female participants commented that
they felt threatened by the physical
prowess of the males who coerced
them to cross the line. When one
woman was forced over the line,
several males in the audience
cheered.
"There's a sense of triumph here
for the males. It's a competition
between one group, the males, and
their antagonists, the females," Tal
ley said. "There's a boundary which

separates the two groups."
According to Talley, this game is
analogous to the sexual game which
exists in the modern dating scene.
He said the rules to this game are
set by society and learned by
children, who then follow them as
they grow older.
"Guys are told to take charge
and to be aggressive," he said. "So
they come on a little too strong,
thinking that girls have to be forced
across that line. The girls do the
only rational thing given the irra
tional set of sexual rules, which is
to step back three feet.
"Date rape is not an aberrant
event, but an unfortunate extention
of rules that govern the 'normal'
male to female interaction. The
guys come on and the girls remain
passive and quiet, hoping that their
lack of response will be taken as a
'no.' The guys take the silence as
a 'yes' and they make more moves,
and so on and so on. The girls'
signal for a damper is interpreted
by the guys as an agreement. This
is exactly how the phenomenon of
date rape works."
Talley offered a phrase that in
dividuals should use when misun
derstandings about sex occur: "I
feel X when you do Y and I'd like
you to do Z." This simple method

of communication is effective and
powerful in eradicating many of the
problems which arise from assump
tions — rather than knowledge —
of the other person's feelings.
He urged the students to rid so
ciety of these "crazy, irrational
rules" and replace them with ones
which encourage open interaction,
communication and equality be
tween the two sexes.
He illustrated these new rules by
another demonstration involving
the divided room. The setting was
the same as the previous one, but
this time males and females were
given the same rules. They were to
pair up with a member of the op
posite sex and work to accomplish
a goal together.
This time, there was no compe
tition between the male group and
the female group. Rather, there was
trust and communication between
the two parties.
"Somewhere between the frosh
and senior years, we should take
over the parental positions and
make our own rules which are
representational of the second
situation," Talley said.
Talley will be teaching a one-unit
Residential Education course titled
"Sexual Etiquette" spring quarter.

He illustrated these new rules by
another demonstration involving
the divided room. The setting was
the same as the previous one, but
this time males and females were
given the same rules. They were to
pair up with a member of the op
posite sex and work to accomplish
a goal together.
This time, there was no compe
tition between the male group and
the female group. Rather, there was
trust and communication between
the two parties.
"Somewhere between the frosh
and senior years, we should take
over the parental positions and
make our own rules which are
representational of the second
situation," Talley said.

There is an important difference
between having sex and making
love, visiting sociologist Jerry Talley
told a group of more than 70 stu
dents attending a workshop last
night in Florence Moore Hall.
Sex differs from making love in
that sex is a mechanical and bio
logical human function, while
making love involves caring and
consideration for the other party's
desires, Talley said. "One is not
necessarily better than the other,
but the problem arises when one
person thinks they're making love
and the other thinks they're having
sex. . . . That's painful," he said.
This misunderstanding is a result
of distinct sexual roles and images,
according to Talley, who said men
have conformed to the aggressive,
"macho" image and women have
responded with passivity.
He said that in recent years there
has been a "swing toward the con
servative end," both politically and
socially. "Now, I hear girls saying
that they're not comfortable with
asking guys out," he said. "I didn't
hear that eight years ago. We fought
the sexual revolution and lost."
According to Talley, males and

females play a game with each other
in sexual situations which may
result in unpleasant consequences,
such as rape. Referring to yester
day's Daily article on date and gang
rape, he said these situations arise
because of a lack of communication
between the parties involved, as
well as the dangerous game be
tween the sexes.
In order to illustrate this sexual
game — frequently unnoticed by
the participants — he divided the
room in half by drawing a line with
a string and placed eight males on
one side and eight females on the
other. The males then had to at
tempt to get the females to cross
the line either with verbal persua
sion or force while staying on their
own side, while the females tried
to stay on their own side.
After the game was over, the
female participants commented that
they felt threatened by the physical
prowess of the males who coerced
them to cross the line. When one
woman was forced over the line,
several males in the audience
cheered.
"There's a sense of triumph here
for the males. It's a competition
between one group, the males, and
their antagonists, the females," Tal
ley said. "There's a boundary which

separates the two groups."
According to Talley, this game is
analogous to the sexual game which
exists in the modern dating scene.
He said the rules to this game are
set by society and learned by
children, who then follow them as
they grow older.
"Guys are told to take charge
and to be aggressive," he said. "So
they come on a little too strong,
thinking that girls have to be forced
across that line. The girls do the
only rational thing given the irra
tional set of sexual rules, which is
to step back three feet.
"Date rape is not an aberrant
event, but an unfortunate extention
of rules that govern the 'normal'
male to female interaction. The
guys come on and the girls remain
passive and quiet, hoping that their
lack of response will be taken as a
'no.' The guys take the silence as
a 'yes' and they make more moves,
and so on and so on. The girls'
signal for a damper is interpreted
by the guys as an agreement. This
is exactly how the phenomenon of
date rape works."
Talley offered a phrase that in
dividuals should use when misun
derstandings about sex occur: "I
feel X when you do Y and I'd like
you to do Z." This simple method

of communication is effective and
powerful in eradicating many of the
problems which arise from assump
tions — rather than knowledge —
of the other person's feelings.
He urged the students to rid so
ciety of these "crazy, irrational
rules" and replace them with ones
which encourage open interaction,
communication and equality be
tween the two sexes.
He illustrated these new rules by
another demonstration involving
the divided room. The setting was
the same as the previous one, but
this time males and females were
given the same rules. They were to
