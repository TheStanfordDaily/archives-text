## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Retain the core list 
### 
Next month, the Faculty Senate will vote on one
of the most important curricular issues in decades:
whether to change the freshman Western Culture
program.
The senate is now considering two proposals: the
revised report of the Area One Task Force and a
counterproposal offered by a group of faculty mem
bers led by Vice Provost and English Prof. William
Chace. While neither plan offers a perfect approach
to incorporating the voices of women and minorities
into the course curriculum, the Chace proposal is
far superior.
The task force proposal envisions a new course
called Cultures, Ideas and Values which would
replace the current Western Culture sequence. The
core reading list now common to all eight Western
Culture tracks would be eliminated, and freshmen
would study at least one non-European culture in
addition to European culture. In addition, the pro
posal requires that only the past six to eight cen
turies be treated in a substantial manner.
The Chace proposal retains the present Western
Culture program with modifications. Most impor
tantly, it would keep the core list and require that
works by women and persons of color be included
in the course. The Chace proposal has two impor
tant advantages: it provides that antiquity be studied
seriously and, by retaining the core list, it ensures
that Western Culture continues to be a common
intellectual experience for all Stanford freshmen.
Chace and company justifiably criticize the task
force for its vague and irresponsible recommenda
tions. But the Chace proposal also should be made
more explicit before it is adopted. Namely, it ought
to mandate that works by women and minorities
be included on the core reading list.
Currently, half of the books read in a Western
Culture track (15 out of about 30 works) must
come from the core list. This textual base unites
freshmen in a common, year-long academic exper
ience. Students from different tracks are able to
discuss the same works from different perspectives.
It is one of the only times students in the sciences

and those in the humanities will have something
in common academically. The core list also has
symbolic importance, for what we choose to em
phasize academically says something about what
beliefs we hold.
Incorporating works by women and minorities
into the core list of readings will ensure that the
commitment to considering diverse viewpoints be
comes an integral part of the Western Culture
program. The core list should be revised, and ex
panded if necessary, so that at least 20 percent of
the works represent minority and non-elite view
points. That proportion would be the result of
including one such work among the five books
currently on the core list for each quarter. Professors
would have the flexibility to include more works
from the modern period if they prefer. While such
a degree of specificity may seem arbitrary, it is the
only reasonable way out of the current impasse.
The alternative is unacceptable vagueness.
As the Chace proposal suggests, selecting
"canonical" works from the modern period is
problematic. Therefore, to ensure that the core list
reflects changing scholarly judgment, it should be
subject every three years to a thorough review by
the Western Culture committee. Given the reluc
tance of the faculty to review the core list even
once in the past eight years, a new mechanism
mandating institutional review must be created.
Finally, we should note that the core list is only
one aspect of teaching Western Culture. Text must
be accompanied by context. Lectures, discussions
and secondary sources deepen students' understand
ing of primary sources as well as the contributions
of women and minorities to the culture of the West.
One cannot legislate everything, and we must trust
the ability of professors to provide this context.
Preserving and modifying the Western Culture
core list will maintain a unifying pedagogical base
and ensure that the voices of women and persons
of color are heard. Subject to these qualifications,
the Chace proposal deserves the support of the
Faculty Senate.
