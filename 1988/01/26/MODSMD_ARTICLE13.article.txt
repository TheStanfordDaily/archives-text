In an intellectual sense we are
Westerners. This involves, among
other things, learning to lead ex
amined lives. "Know thyself' is at
the heart of this tradition. Reading
the core list is somewhat like un
wrapping a gift only to find a com
plex mirror that does not reflect
race or gender but rather an ability
to see the relationship between the
individual and society as fluid and
dynamic. It is filled with heroes and
the possibility that we can be among
them. Martin Luther King Jr. was
named after Martin Luther for ob
vious reasons.

With this in mind, it is offensive
to see the Westerner, rich or poor,
black or white, male or female, ac
cepting without thought of any debt
incurred the patrimony we all enjoy,

those of us who live in the free
world. Ingratitude is so obvious
when one begins to dilute the im
portance of Plato and Aristotle, the
impact of the Roman republic, the
rewards of the scientific revolution.
We cannot hope to repay Socrates
what he gave us, nor the genera
tions who fought for freedoms
reified in the Bill of Rights.
To live lives without any sense
of obligation to those who made
our lives as tolerable as they are is
spiritually atrophying. We cannot
repay the gift of Western thought
and literature, but we can take part
in it, and the Western Culture
debate at Stanford is only the latest
episode. I urge saving the core and
making the non-Western thought
and literature requirement an
equally challenging course. Do not
continue to compare them or
remark about the race or gender
behind great ideas. Every continent
has its philosophers, but this debate

should not be a simple-minded
popularity contest dictated by the
Zeitgeist.
To fail to understand our place
and responsibility in Western cul
ture is to declinc to express,
however clumsily, our gratitude for
the fruits of genius, for the
generosity that gave us the lives we
lead. We have worlds waiting for
us (Western and non-Western), but
before we go off to make things
that much better we must under
stand how we arrived at this time
in history. Unwrapping the gift of
Western thought and literature is
a key step in that direction. Take
it upon yourself, task force
proposals notwithstanding, to read
the core as it now stands. Anything
less is denying yourself in history.
Anything more, of course, is ex
pected.
