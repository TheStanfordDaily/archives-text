# The 						fine art of listening
## 
### 
Way back when I was a freshman in high school,
I saw a movie that changed my life. The place was
my English class, and the movie was about listening.
That's right, listening. We couldn't believe it either.
When we asked my teacher if she was going to collect
notes, she responded as she always did: "Only if you
don't take any." Great, I thought, as I took out some
binder paper. Everyone expected to see another boring
movie about the mysterious intricacies of the English
language. Instead, we were watching a movie about
.. . listening.

Listening? What's the deal? We thought we all
knew how to do that already. Most people didn't take
the movie very seriously. They had reason not to; it
was somewhat corny, and the tone throughout was a
laid-back, humorous one. But underneath the light
exterior was a serious message: Listening, true listen
ing, is an art.
By listening 1 don't mean everyday conversational
listening, which most of us do without really thinking
about it. People talk about what kind of day they had,
and we hear what they say and respond accordingly.
That kind of listening comes naturally. What I am
referring to is serious, problem-solving listening, the
kind you need for a friend who has something tearing
him or her apart inside. That kind of listening often
does not come naturally. You have to learn it.
The definition of a "good listener" undoubtedly
varies from person to person. For some, a good listener
might simply mean anyone who's willing to hear them
when they need to talk about a problem. For me,
though, it runs deeper than that. When I have a
serious problem and I have to tell somebody, I can
be extremely picky about whom I choose to talk to.
Unless people specifically ask, I don't like to talk
about my problems. I feel bad about this, but most
of the time the reason I don't like to talk about my
problems is that unless the other person is a good
listener, I feel so much worse after talking to him or
her that I'd rather not talk at all in the first place.
Sometimes, half the reason a problem tears you
apart is because you have to keep it inside. If you
can just get it out, you suddenly see things that you
didn't see before, and you can figure out what to do
about it. Many times the only thing you need to set
you on that path is someone who knows how to just
listen.
I have only a dim memory of that movie, but I do

remember some of the "rules of good listening" that
it emphasized and illustrated over and over again. I
don't profess to be an expert on the subject. But
whenever I try to help people who have problems, I
try to follow these rules, and I've found that they do
help.
• Never pass judgment. This rule is crucial for people
talking to others who are "below" them in age or
rank. Many times people forget that others are entirely
capable of making sound decisions. The gut reaction,
the instinct, is to protect and to guide. But if someone
needs to talk about a serious problem, the worst thing
you can do is give him your opinion of the way he
handled the situation.
Just because someone is older or has more exper
ience does not necessarily mean that he knows what's
best. One of the most infuriating things in the world
is that "elder knows best" quality, the mentality that
flatly refuses to even consider that the ideas of someone
younger or "inferior" may be right.
• Never give advice if you can help it. Many times
the person will figure out his own problem if given
enough time and understanding. He doesn't need any
additional advice to confuse his thoughts any further.
• Listen to the person. Let him know you're listening.
Look at him when he speaks, take in what he says
and don't say anything. Some people are shy or re
luctant to talk about their problems. Be patient and
give them time to think. And don't ever interrupt.
Body language, however subtle, is incredibly revealing.
You can sense it when someone doesn't feel like
listening to you. If you have a big problem, you might
be better off talking to someone else who cares about
what you're saying.
• Don't ever talk about yourself. You are the listener.
Someone is trying to figure out a problem that is
hurting him inside. The least kindness you can do is
give him some attention, not draw it to yourself. I
don't mean trying to help someone solve a problem
by drawing on a similar thing that happened in your
life; sometimes that is helpful. Just don't take the
focus of the conversation away from the person who
really needs it.
When you shine the spotlight on yourself instead,
you are essentially saying that you really don't give a
damn about his problem, because you'd rather talk
about yourself.
There were many other "rules," but those stand out
most in my memory. Until I saw that movie I hadn't
realized that I really did not know how to listen at
all. It had a tremendous impact on me then, and it
still does now. I actually did take notes, in the naive
belief that my English teacher would collect them.
(She never did.) Soon afterward I misplaced them,
and I haven't seen them since. But every time I talk
to people I'm reminded of everything I learned from
that movie.

Way back when I was a freshman in high school,
I saw a movie that changed my life. The place was
my English class, and the movie was about listening.
That's right, listening. We couldn't believe it either.
When we asked my teacher if she was going to collect
notes, she responded as she always did: "Only if you
don't take any." Great, I thought, as I took out some
binder paper. Everyone expected to see another boring
movie about the mysterious intricacies of the English
language. Instead, we were watching a movie about
.. . listening.

Listening? What's the deal? We thought we all
knew how to do that already. Most people didn't take
the movie very seriously. They had reason not to; it
was somewhat corny, and the tone throughout was a
laid-back, humorous one. But underneath the light
exterior was a serious message: Listening, true listen
ing, is an art.
By listening 1 don't mean everyday conversational
listening, which most of us do without really thinking
about it. People talk about what kind of day they had,
and we hear what they say and respond accordingly.
That kind of listening comes naturally. What I am
referring to is serious, problem-solving listening, the
kind you need for a friend who has something tearing
him or her apart inside. That kind of listening often
does not come naturally. You have to learn it.
The definition of a "good listener" undoubtedly
varies from person to person. For some, a good listener
might simply mean anyone who's willing to hear them
when they need to talk about a problem. For me,
though, it runs deeper than that. When I have a
serious problem and I have to tell somebody, I can
be extremely picky about whom I choose to talk to.
Unless people specifically ask, I don't like to talk
about my problems. I feel bad about this, but most
of the time the reason I don't like to talk about my
problems is that unless the other person is a good
listener, I feel so much worse after talking to him or
her that I'd rather not talk at all in the first place.
Sometimes, half the reason a problem tears you
apart is because you have to keep it inside. If you
can just get it out, you suddenly see things that you
didn't see before, and you can figure out what to do
about it. Many times the only thing you need to set
you on that path is someone who knows how to just
listen.
I have only a dim memory of that movie, but I do

remember some of the "rules of good listening" that
it emphasized and illustrated over and over again. I
don't profess to be an expert on the subject. But
whenever I try to help people who have problems, I
try to follow these rules, and I've found that they do
help.
• Never pass judgment. This rule is crucial for people
talking to others who are "below" them in age or
rank. Many times people forget that others are entirely
capable of making sound decisions. The gut reaction,
the instinct, is to protect and to guide. But if someone
needs to talk about a serious problem, the worst thing
you can do is give him your opinion of the way he
handled the situation.
Just because someone is older or has more exper
ience does not necessarily mean that he knows what's
best. One of the most infuriating things in the world
is that "elder knows best" quality, the mentality that
flatly refuses to even consider that the ideas of someone
younger or "inferior" may be right.
• Never give advice if you can help it. Many times
the person will figure out his own problem if given
enough time and understanding. He doesn't need any
additional advice to confuse his thoughts any further.
• Listen to the person. Let him know you're listening.
Look at him when he speaks, take in what he says
and don't say anything. Some people are shy or re
luctant to talk about their problems. Be patient and
give them time to think. And don't ever interrupt.
Body language, however subtle, is incredibly revealing.
You can sense it when someone doesn't feel like
listening to you. If you have a big problem, you might
be better off talking to someone else who cares about
what you're saying.
• Don't ever talk about yourself. You are the listener.
Someone is trying to figure out a problem that is
hurting him inside. The least kindness you can do is
give him some attention, not draw it to yourself. I
don't mean trying to help someone solve a problem
by drawing on a similar thing that happened in your
life; sometimes that is helpful. Just don't take the
focus of the conversation away from the person who
really needs it.
When you shine the spotlight on yourself instead,
you are essentially saying that you really don't give a
damn about his problem, because you'd rather talk
about yourself.
There were many other "rules," but those stand out
most in my memory. Until I saw that movie I hadn't
realized that I really did not know how to listen at
all. It had a tremendous impact on me then, and it
still does now. I actually did take notes, in the naive
belief that my English teacher would collect them.
(She never did.) Soon afterward I misplaced them,
and I haven't seen them since. But every time I talk
to people I'm reminded of everything I learned from
that movie.
