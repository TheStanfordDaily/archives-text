## School's editorial control is acceptable 
### 
The editorial "Squeezing free speech" (Daily,
Jan. 21) argued against the recent Supreme
Court decision (giving high school administrators
broad powers to censor high school newspapers).
I would like to argue in favor.

The majority of the Supreme Court judges
have decided that the principal of a high school
did not violate any First Amendment rights by
censoring the school-owned newspaper. The dis
senting judges argued that students who arc
subjected to censorship will not become good
citizens of the country and that the decision
should have been based on an existing legal
precedent.
I believe that while the dissent raised a
legitimate and pressing concern about the po
tential effects of the decision on the future civic
behavior of the students, the majority was correct
in deciding to uphold the right to private owner
ship.
The majority voted that "educators do not
offend the First Amendment by exercising edi
torial control over the style and content of stu
dent speech in school-sponsored expressive ac
tivities," as The New York Times reported on
Jan. 14. The First Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution guarantees freedom of expression
in public places. The majority's underlying ar
gument is that the school has the right to edit
the student newspaper because it owns it and

it publishes it.
The decision assumes that the school is the
"educators." It could be the students or the
owners of the school. If it were the students,
then a private school would have to abandon
ownership of its resources. If it were the owners,
then a public school would be a public place
protected by the First Amendment. But it is
not, because the citizens who have access to it
must qualify as students or teachers.
In his articulation of the dissent opinion, As
sociate Justice William Brennan argues that if
the educators exercise their censoring option
consistently, the students will be exposed to a
narrow set of ideas. As a result, they will fail
to express their full opinion freely when they
become adult citizens.
It is true that an education based on censor
ship docs not prepare students adequately for
their civic duties in a democratic society. But
the court should not consider educational
policies when it judges whether the owner of a
newspaper has the right to edit it. If it had
voted otherwise, the constitutional right to
private ownership would have been violated.
However legitimate Brennan's concerns may be,
they are outside of the Court's judiciary function.
Another objection raised by the dissent con
cerns the existence of a legal precedent. In the
Tinker v. Dcs Moines Independent Community
School District case, it was decided that "official
censorship of student expression is unconstitu
tional unless the speech materially disrupts
classwork or involves substantial disorder or in
vasion of rights of others."

Mad the Supreme Court based its decision
on this precedent, it would have upheld the
judgment of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
that the principal violated the First Amendment
rights of the students. The high school students
did not disrupt classwork nor did they invade
the rights of others to privacy because they
maintained anonymity in the articles about preg
nancy and divorce that were censored by the
principal.

The majority was correct in
deciding to uphold the right to
private ownership.

Nevertheless, the Tinker precedent applies to
freedom of speech inside the classroom and not
to a newspaper published under the school's
name and backed by its financial resources. It
would have been relevant only if the school had
censored a newspaper owned by the students.
In conclusion, the Supreme Court was correct
in judging that the school-owned newspapers
arc under the school's editorial control. They
arc not public forums protected by the First
Amendment. The educators who act under the
school's name have the option of turning them
into public forums if they think that this is the
best way to fulfill their pedagogic mission. But
no court can force such an option on them,
because courts do not legislate.
