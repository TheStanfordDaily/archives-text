## Scientists attack AIDS with two-drug treatment 
### Robert Liu 
Stanford researchers are begin
ning a clinical study to test a new
AIDS treatment that uses both the
anti-viral medication azidothy
midine (AZT) and an immune
boosting agent known as
interleukin-2 (IL-2) to combat the
virus in the early stages of infection,
according to the study's supervisor,
Dr. Scott Harkonen.
The Stanford doctors conducting
the study are now in the final stages
of selecting the 25 patients they
will use to test the new treatment.
Stanford's two-pronged approach
involves first slowing the virus's
reproduction and then stimulating
the body's immune system. AZT
does the former and IL-2 does the
latter.
AIDS, or Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome, is caused by
the Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV). HIV attacks "helper
T cells," white blood cells that are
an integral part of the the body's
immune system. AIDS leaves its
victim vulnerable to infectious dis
eases and cancers that don't appear
in normal individuals but lead to
death in AIDS patients.
AZT, the only AIDS treatment
approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), interferes
with certain enzymes that assist in
the reproduction of HIV. However,
there are dangers associated with
the drug because it also affects the
reproduction of body cells such as
white blood cells, although this
varies for each individual, according
to Physician Specialist David
Schwartz.
IL-2, one of the body's own
cytokines, or short-distance cell-to

cell "hormones," is normally
produced by the T cells to promote
the growth and activity of these
immune cells. Because T cells play
an important role in the mainte
nance of a strong immune system,
IL-2 is a vital substance in the battle
against viral disease.
The HIV virus attacks T cells,
both preventing the natural produc
tion of IL-2 and limiting the T cells'
ability to respond to IL-2.
In the AIDS patient, the T cell
signal that activates IL-2 production
can also stimulate the reproduction
of the HIV virus in infected cells,
Schwartz said.
IL-2 that is administered from
outside the body does not contain
this harmful chemical signal and
may induce the T cell's own recep
tors for the IL-2.
By thus activating the T cells,
IL-2 will stimulate production of
more of the harmful signal that in
creases HIV reproduction. The
Stanford scientists hope that AZT
will inhibit this HIV reproduction,
Schwartz said.
The IL-2 treatment must be ap
plied early on, before the T ceils
have been consumed, when the abil
ity of the T cells to respond to IL-2
is deficient but not completely ab
sent.
"The study is designed to try to
intervene in the course of the dis
ease when the immune system is
still intact," Harkonen said.
For this reason, the HIV-positive
patients in the study must have T
cell counts of at least 400 per mil
liliter of blood tested. These
patients are in the pre-AIDS con
dition. They have neither full-blown
AIDS nor (AIDS-related complex
(ARC), a precursor of AIDS.

The patients do not experience
ARC symptoms such as night
sweats, diarrhea, thrush and unex
plained weight loss upon entering
the trial. They do have persistent
generalized swelling of the lymph
nodes, according to research nurse
Marilyn Mohlar.
The results of this preliminary
study, called Phase I by the FDA,
may not be ready for six months to
a year, Harkonen said.
Schwartz emphasized that the
treatment is not expected to be a
cure for AIDS, although it will
hopefully diminish the virus's harm
to the host body. If the treatment
succeeds, the patient will no longer
exhibit ARC symptoms, but may
still be contagious. AZT is only ef
fective in suppressing the replica
tion of the HIV virus, which means
that though "quiet," it can still be
transmitted to others through high
risk activities such as anal sex or
intravenous drug abuse.
Moreover, Schwartz commented
that "continuing these high-risk
practices may lead to the accelera
tion of the disease in those already
infected." This is because these ac
tivities open up the subject to more
infection by diseases which could
lead to death or reactivation of the
HIV virus in the immune-deficient
body.
For any study of a new drug treat
ment program, the FDA establishes
a three-part procedure which must
be completed before the agency
grants its approval for commercial
manufacture. Phase I primarily tests
the safety of the drug with the sec
ondary objective of checking its ef
ficacy.
Stanford's study will administer
different doses to its patients to

determine a safe and effective
regimen, Harkonen said. This is
particularly important in view of
the possible harm an overdose of
AZT can cause to the patients' body
cells, Schwartz said.
If the drugs pass Phase I, the
next step is a treatment study in
volving several AIDS research
centers around the country. This
involves an intensive investigation
into the effectiveness of the drugs,

said Laura Hofstadter, a spokesper
son for the study.
Phase 111 is the controlled clinical
trial in which thousands of patients
are given the medication to com
pare it to the best treatments today.
The completion of all three
phases may take many years, but
according to Harkonen, AIDS re
search is given a priority by the
FDA. In fact, he said, AZT was
approved in the record time of

about two years. He added that if
Stanford's study succeeds, the treat
ment may be widely available to
AIDS patients by the end of 1988
Finally, Schwartz concluded that
there are two foci to this study at
Stanford: the clinical and the re
search. The clinical focus examines
the early events in the infection of
HIV before the onset of AIDS; the
research focus investigates the cel
lular basis of the immune response.
