## The
						gambling Bug tries to strike it rich in Vegas

While the rest of the Stanford
community was having a rowdy time
at Saturday's basketball game en
joying the humiliation of the
Golden Bears, I was donating my
valuable time as a referee at the
Viennese Ball and Tractor Pull.
The Ball was very cleanly played,
and I was only forced to hand out
18 minutes in penalties. I cited one
couple for tripping, another for el
bowing, and several men received
high-sticking penalties. Except for
the bench-clearing brawl at the end
of the third waltz, my job was
remarkably easy for a ball with such
clear playoff implications.
And speaking of implications, re
member to implicate your questions

them to Bug-Me (not B.Bug-Me)
at the tragedies on LOTS.
Dear Bug,
With Tahoe season upon us, a
question about underage gambling
seems in order. If you were underage
but managed to gamble at a casino
anyway, and perhaps won some
money, could they take it away if
they found out your age? If they could,
wouldn't they have to give back any
money you lost to them?

The following is a true story. Only
the names have been omitted to
protect the stupid:
August 7, 1987. Caesar's Palace
Casino, Las Vegas, Nev. A family
vacationing from Hot Springs, Ark.,
is idly hanging around the casino,
wiling away the spare time by oc
casionally getting in on a little of
the gambling action. Being nice par
ents, Mom and Dad allow their
19-year-old son to unobtrusively
play the slot machines; after all, as
long as he's quiet, nobody's going
to notice that he's underage. Every
thing is just peachy.
But does Junior stick to the nice
25-cent slot machines wedged be
tween rows of little old ladies with
paper cups full of nickels?
Nooooooo!! Junior decides to play
the gargantuan "Million Dollar
Baby" slot machine. Unobtrusively,
our 19-year-old hero pumps a silver
dollar into the"Million Dollar
Baby," pulls the handle, and a very

obtrusive $1,061,000 comes pouring
out of the one-armed bandit.
Oops.
Now this family may be from
Arkansas, but they ain't stupid, so
immediately Dad comes running
over to replace his son in front of
the slot machine and gamely an
nounces that it was he who just
won a million bucks.
But noooooooo!
You see, all casinos have video
cameras trained on the major jack
pot games, and whenever a large
jackpot is won, the Nevada Gaming
Commission must be called in to
verify the win. The Commission
checks the slot machine to make
sure the microchips haven't been
tampered with (betcha didn't know
modern slots had microchips), and
then they view the videotape of the
win.

Sure enough, when thj gaminj
control agents took a peek at the
videotape, what did they see but
Junior winning $1,061,000, and Dad
hustling over to displace him in
front of the machine.
Guess who went back to
Arkansas empty-handed.
Casinos don't operate on the
Wheel of Fortune Theory of
Gamesmanship ("Once you win a
prize it's yours to keep") because
it is illegal for them to pay winnings
to underage gamblers. According
to a representative of the Holiday
Inn Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas,
they would feel very uncomfortable
allowing an underage gambler to
keep any large winnings. Transla
tion: They would take away your
chips.
They claim they catch 99 percent
of underage gamblers before they
even have a chance to start gam
bling. Anyone looking remotely un
derage is required to show ID when
buying chips, and there are pit

bosses and security guards roaming
the casino floor ready to demand
ID of anyone suspected of being
under age 21.
Obviously if casinos had the
choice they'd allow six-year-olds to
play, because the more gamblers
there are, the more money the
casino makes. Unfortunately, the
Gaming Control Commission can
impose strict penalties on casinos
that don't carefully control un
derage gamblers. It's similar to laws
pertaining to liquor stores.
In casino lingo, underage
gamblers will be "eighty-sixed,"
which means tossed out on their
butts. Chances are they'll have their
chips taken away, too, particularly
if they have a lot of them. Since
there is no way to document how
much a person may have lost, it
would be impossible for the casinos
to give them back their losses, even
if they had any remote desire to
do so.
If you are underage and feel you
must gamble, here are a few sug
gestions:
• Have someone of legal gambling
age buy your chips. Chances are if
you look under 26 you'll be carded
if you try to buy chips.
• Don't keep large amounts of chips
on your person. If they do discover
you arc underage, they'll probably
take away your chips. If you start
winning big, hide your chips some
where and cash them in later.
• Don't bother to play games with
big jackpots. Winners in those
games have to be verified by the
Nevada Gaming Commission, and
that requires more than your fake
ID to get by.
• If you use a fake ID, make sure
it's realistic looking. The casino se
curity see people from every state,
and a driver's license from Alaska
that doesn't look real won't cut it.
Also, remember that using a fake
ID is a felony in some states.
• If casino officials demand to see
your ID, immediately become in
dignant and leave with your chips
instead of trying to pass as 21.
They'll probably let you go rather
than create a scene, and you can
cash in your chips later and go
gamble elsewhere.
Dear Bug Me: .
Quite frankly, we're concerned. It's
about student No. 1234567, the one
on the back of the Time Schedule.
The fact that this person takes classes

at 8 a.m. is enough to warrant serious
investigation ... but what really has
us losing sleep is the content of this
schedule.
Is "Ottoman Empire" taught at
Stanford? Do any of these classes
satisfy distribution requirements? Can
we take "Sailing" winter quarter too?
Just what is "Collective Social Be
havior," and how can we join? But
most of all, how long has student
No. 1234567 been taking the same
classes, and is Dean Fetter aware of
his/her less-than-successful academic
progress?
-SAC
I don't know if this thought has
occurred to you at all, but if you'd
stop and think for like one second
you'd realize that Dean Fetter is
dean of Admissions and doesn't give
a damn what anyone does after they
get in here. Thank you. I just
wanted to set you straight.
Prior to winter quarter in 1975
there wasn't a sample study list on
the back of the Time Schedule, and

students had to cope for themselves
with the incredibly difficult task of
figuring out how to properly fill out
a study list. Presumably students
got stupider in winter '75, because
it was that quarter that the first
sample study list was offered.
Student No. 1234567 has indeed
been taking the same classes for
the last 14 years, although several
things have changed. "Writing
Workshop," which is now offered
Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 12:15
p.m. was originally from 11 a.m. to
12:15 p.m. Furthermore, "Ottoman
Empire" used to be five days a
week at 8 a.m., instead of its current
Monday, Wednesday, Friday slot.
The adviser used to be T.R.
Smith, but he was replaced by Ad
viser's Signature (Mr. Signature ob
viously being of Armenian decent),
and John Doe has been replaced
by Student's Signature (probably a
distant cousin of the adviser).
Although student No. 1234567
has been taking these classes for

14 years, all of the original profes
sors of the classes have died and
been replaced by new ones.
Originally, the classes were taught
by Staff, Vucinich, Rosenblum and
Steenbackers, respectively. Then,
for about two years, the sample
study list was very blurry and un
readable (like a real study list), and
suddenly when it became intelligi
ble two years later, Steenbackers
had changed his name to Steen
baueus.
Those teachers have all passed
on to the great office hours in the
sky, and the current teachers are
Staff, Smith, Jones and Stephens,
respectively. Coincidentally, Step
hens, teaching Sailing every quarter,
is the name of the guy who puts
together the Time Schedule.
Hmmmmm?
Every few years they update the
quarter and year of the study list;
it currently reads Summer 1986,
which explains why student No.
1234567 is taking Sailing.
As for the rest of the curriculum,
those classes are fictional, but then
again, so are most classes at Stan
ford. Here are the actual class des
criptions, which I have stolen from
the mysterious vaults of Old Union:
English 1A: Writing Workshop:
Intensive course emphasizing the
published bestseller as a writing
goal. Students will be required to
write and publish a novel which, to
receive credit, must remain on the
New York Times Bestseller List for
16 weeks. (6 units, DR: 2)
History 186: Ottoman Empire:
Class deals with the impact of
several different great furniture
societies on modern home decorat
ing. Contrasted with the Ottoman
Empire will be the Couch Dynasty,
the Dinette Kingdom and the Easy
Chair Oligarchy. (5 units, DR: 3)
Sociology 220: Collective Social
Behavior A look at behavior when
different social groups interact.
Specific case studies will include
nuns visiting Heil's Angels motor
cycle bars, professional wrestlers at
a senior citizens' luncheon and
elementary school children visiting
death row inmates. (5 units).
Athletics 155: Sailing: One of
Stanford's most popular classes
since President Kennedy used the
$300 million Centennial endow
ment to purchase the Loch Ness
Monster. Students eaten by "Ne
ssie" will not receive credit. (1 unit,
mandatory Pass/Nessie Chow).
