# Students go into action to save the environment
## 
### Michelle Finkel Staff writer 
"It's important to understand
that the things that Stanford stu
dents and the people of Palo Alto
do (can) contribute to our global
problems," said junior Eric Jorgen
sen, member of the new campus
organization, Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford (SEAS).
"There's waste of food and water.
We're taking for granted what we
have."
The members of SEAS hope to
change that. The group was organ
ized at the beginning of the year
by students in "Managing the Com
mons," a class on Third World
resource use.
Many students in the class ex
pressed interest in getting involved
in local conservation work if there
were an organization on campus
for that purpose. So SEAS was
born.
When organization member
Robert Abrams came to Stanford
as a freshman last year he was
surprised that there was no student
run environmental conservation
group. So he established the East
African Wildlife Society, an exten
sion of a group he had worked with
previously. However, the group had

few active members.
SEAS has approximately 20
members and focuses on local issues
such as recycling paper and dis
couraging use of Styrofoam, rather
than on the extreme environmental
problems of East Africa, as the
wildlife society did.
SEAS has only held three
meetings and has no real organiza
tional hierarchy yet. Presently, the
group is focusing on recruiting as
many members as possible and
giving each member some respon
sibility, Abrams said.
"The problem I've found is with
most organizations ... if you want,
as a student, to get involved on an
individual level it's difficult," he
said. Abrams wants to make sure
that in SEAS every member is ac
tively participating.
SEAS is involved in numerous
projects at present. The group has
been working on the Outdoor Ed
ucation Program, in which Stanford
students act as camp counselors for
elementary school students who will
be visiting a nature camp in San
Mateo for one week during Stan
ford's spring break. The fifth- and
sixth-graders who attend will be
studying animals in their habitats.
With the help of SEAS, the
elementary school students will

learn about the environment, rather
than only spend a short time at the
camp and possibly forget what they
had seen, Jorgensen said.
SEAS is also trying to organize
radio documentaries to be distrib
uted to national public radio, as
well as trying to prepare programs
in the dorms on campus to encour
age environmental awareness.
The group is now concentrating
on a speaker series called "Conser
vation and Sustainability" that
meets on Wednesday nights at 8
p.m. in Krcsge Auditorium. The
next speaker in the series is Bruce
Wilcox, who will be discussing the
subject of "Global Rainforest
Deforestation."
Other speakers in the series in
clude Raymond Dasman, professor
of Environmental Studies at the
UC-Santa Cruz; Jerry Moles, Di
rector of the NeoSynthesis Re
search Center of Mirahawattc, Sri
Lanka; and Helena Norberg-
Hodge, Right Livelihood Award
recipient.
The lecture series is being pre
sented in conjunction with Human
Biology 14, "Culture and Conser
vation."
SEAS members are also lobbying
for an environmental issues focus

for next year's "You Can Make a
Difference" conference. The con
servation issue is one of the main
topics being considered, according
to sophomore member Molly Cum
mings, who is one of the lobbyists.
The issues addressed by SEAS
are related to the institutional rac
ism that was the topic of this year's
"You Can Make a Difference" con
ference, Jorgensen said.
"Racism and environmental
degradation are related," he said.
Jorgensen cited examples, explain
ing that toxic waste sites and other
environmentally hazardous areas
are often in primarily black neigh
borhoods.
"We want to make people aware
that we're not just concerned about
trees. This is an all-encompassing
issue," he said.
Senior Sally Kauffman, a human
biology major and a member of
SEAS, summarized the or
ganization's principal emphasis:
"You have conservation and envi
ronmental issues that are not nor
mally talked about on campus, and
there are people [who] don't really
know about them. I think one of
our main goals is educating every
one about the environmental issues
that are at hand right now."

mons," a class on Third World
resource use.
Many students in the class ex
pressed interest in getting involved
in local conservation work if there
were an organization on campus
for that purpose. So SEAS was
born.
When organization member
Robert Abrams came to Stanford
as a freshman last year he was
surprised that there was no student
run environmental conservation
group. So he established the East
African Wildlife Society, an exten
sion of a group he had worked with
previously. However, the group had

few active members.
SEAS has approximately 20
members and focuses on local issues
such as recycling paper and dis
couraging use of Styrofoam, rather
than on the extreme environmental
problems of East Africa, as the
wildlife society did.
SEAS has only held three
meetings and has no real organiza
tional hierarchy yet. Presently, the
group is focusing on recruiting as
many members as possible and
giving each member some respon
sibility, Abrams said.
"The problem I've found is with
most organizations ... if you want,
as a student, to get involved on an
individual level it's difficult," he
said. Abrams wants to make sure
that in SEAS every member is ac
tively participating.
SEAS is involved in numerous
projects at present. The group has
been working on the Outdoor Ed
ucation Program, in which Stanford
students act as camp counselors for
elementary school students who will
be visiting a nature camp in San
Mateo for one week during Stan
ford's spring break. The fifth- and
sixth-graders who attend will be
studying animals in their habitats.
With the help of SEAS, the
elementary school students will

learn about the environment, rather
than only spend a short time at the
camp and possibly forget what they
had seen, Jorgensen said.
SEAS is also trying to organize
radio documentaries to be distrib
uted to national public radio, as
well as trying to prepare programs
in the dorms on campus to encour
age environmental awareness.
The group is now concentrating
on a speaker series called "Conser
vation and Sustainability" that
meets on Wednesday nights at 8
p.m. in Krcsge Auditorium. The
next speaker in the series is Bruce
Wilcox, who will be discussing the
subject of "Global Rainforest
Deforestation."
Other speakers in the series in
clude Raymond Dasman, professor
of Environmental Studies at the
UC-Santa Cruz; Jerry Moles, Di
rector of the NeoSynthesis Re
search Center of Mirahawattc, Sri
Lanka; and Helena Norberg-
Hodge, Right Livelihood Award
recipient.
The lecture series is being pre
sented in conjunction with Human
Biology 14, "Culture and Conser
vation."
SEAS members are also lobbying
for an environmental issues focus

for next year's "You Can Make a
Difference" conference. The con
servation issue is one of the main
topics being considered, according
to sophomore member Molly Cum
mings, who is one of the lobbyists.
The issues addressed by SEAS
are related to the institutional rac
ism that was the topic of this year's
"You Can Make a Difference" con
ference, Jorgensen said.
"Racism and environmental
degradation are related," he said.
Jorgensen cited examples, explain
ing that toxic waste sites and other
environmentally hazardous areas
are often in primarily black neigh
borhoods.
"We want to make people aware
that we're not just concerned about
trees. This is an all-encompassing
issue," he said.
Senior Sally Kauffman, a human
biology major and a member of
SEAS, summarized the or
ganization's principal emphasis:
"You have conservation and envi
ronmental issues that are not nor
mally talked about on campus, and
there are people [who] don't really
know about them. I think one of
our main goals is educating every
one about the environmental issues
that are at hand right now."
