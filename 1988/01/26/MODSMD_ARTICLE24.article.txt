## Columnist examines Cardinal recruiting 
### 
During the past weekend a
dozen high school football players
came to Stanford from around the
country for a 48-hour football
recruiting visit. I was given almost
total access to the process and
spent the weekend with prospective
players, current players, coaches,
parents and all the other people
involved in the recruiting of pro
spective student-athletes. What fol
lows are both a description of the
events and some impressions I
gained.

Around noon on Saturday
Dick James, the Stanford foot
ball recruiting coordinator, is
heading to San Francisco for an
airport pickup. This weekend
and the two big recruiting
weekends that immediately
preceded it are James' football
season. He has worked all year
pinpointing prospective student
athletes around the country, and
he'll run this weekend's activi
ties.
Not only has he set up travel
schedules and the overall
itinerary, but he has also briefed
the coaches through a packet of
"word pictures." These word pic
tures give biographical informa
tion on each athlete while also
outlining his personal character
istics and how to approach him.
This can include whether an ath
lete is outgoing or shy, how he's
looking at Stanford and how he
fits into Stanford's recruiting
plans.
James will be picking up Chad
Roghair, a lanky quarterback

from Rcdlands, and Charlie
Lough, a linebackcr from
Upland.
This is Roghair's first recruit
ing trip, and he'll be heading
east to Ivy League schools for
his other four visits. He's been
accepted early at Princeton and
had applied to Stanford even
before he was recruited as an
athlete.
Lough had been to California
the week before and had also
been to Colorado with a trip to
UCLA planned.
When we arrive back at Stan
ford we head to Stickney's (one
of Stanford Head Coach Jack
Elway's favorite restaurants) for
lunch. After that we take a
driving tour of the campus and
head to the Tennis Center where
all the recruits and coaches have
gathered.
Of the 13 recruits scheduled
for visits, 11 have arrived. One
hurt his ankle in a basketball
game the night before, and an
other will be arriving later from
Lander Valley, Wyo.
Also at the Tennis Center are
parents. The Stanford coaching
staff strongly encourages parents
of prospective student-athletes
to visit with their sons. Not only
do the coaches believe the par
ents should be involved in their
sons' college decision, but there
is also a feeling that parents will
see through the lure of a good
weight room or nice stadium and
be particularly attracted to the
acadcmics and caring atmos
phere Stanford provides.
Once everyone has gathered,
Elway delivers a welcome to the
group. This is his only official
action of the recruiting weekend,
and Elway plays a surprisingly
minor role in this part of the
process. This is not to say that
Elway doesn't become involved
