## Columnist examines Cardinal recruiting 
### 
During the past weekend a
dozen high school football players
came to Stanford from around the
country for a 48-hour football
recruiting visit. I was given almost
total access to the process and
spent the weekend with prospective
players, current players, coaches,
parents and all the other people
involved in the recruiting of pro
spective student-athletes. What fol
lows are both a description of the
events and some impressions I
gained.

Around noon on Saturday
Dick James, the Stanford foot
ball recruiting coordinator, is
heading to San Francisco for an
airport pickup. This weekend
and the two big recruiting
weekends that immediately
preceded it are James' football
season. He has worked all year
pinpointing prospective student
athletes around the country, and
he'll run this weekend's activi
ties.
Not only has he set up travel
schedules and the overall
itinerary, but he has also briefed
the coaches through a packet of
"word pictures." These word pic
tures give biographical informa
tion on each athlete while also
outlining his personal character
istics and how to approach him.
This can include whether an ath
lete is outgoing or shy, how he's
looking at Stanford and how he
fits into Stanford's recruiting
plans.
James will be picking up Chad
Roghair, a lanky quarterback

from Rcdlands, and Charlie
Lough, a linebackcr from
Upland.
This is Roghair's first recruit
ing trip, and he'll be heading
east to Ivy League schools for
his other four visits. He's been
accepted early at Princeton and
had applied to Stanford even
before he was recruited as an
athlete.
Lough had been to California
the week before and had also
been to Colorado with a trip to
UCLA planned.
When we arrive back at Stan
ford we head to Stickney's (one
of Stanford Head Coach Jack
Elway's favorite restaurants) for
lunch. After that we take a
driving tour of the campus and
head to the Tennis Center where
all the recruits and coaches have
gathered.
Of the 13 recruits scheduled
for visits, 11 have arrived. One
hurt his ankle in a basketball
game the night before, and an
other will be arriving later from
Lander Valley, Wyo.
Also at the Tennis Center are
parents. The Stanford coaching
staff strongly encourages parents
of prospective student-athletes
to visit with their sons. Not only
do the coaches believe the par
ents should be involved in their
sons' college decision, but there
is also a feeling that parents will
see through the lure of a good
weight room or nice stadium and
be particularly attracted to the
acadcmics and caring atmos
phere Stanford provides.
Once everyone has gathered,
Elway delivers a welcome to the
group. This is his only official
action of the recruiting weekend,
and Elway plays a surprisingly
minor role in this part of the
process. This is not to say that
Elway doesn't become involved


Brendan
Healey
in recruiting, but he's much more
effective in the one-on-one relation
ships he develops when he makes
home visits.
When the athletes are on the
Farm, Elway gives them a chance
to soak up the University. If he
hasn't seen them yet in their home
or school, chances are that he will
eventually. Elway is known as a
good in-home recruiter who appeals
to parents with his family-oriented
outlook and the fact that he sent
his own son to Stanford.
After Elway speaks, the athletes
meet their student hosts. These
hosts are football players and may
be the most important aspect of a
recruiting visit. A host is possibly
the most influential person in a
player's decision, because the host
represents an athlete's potential
teammates for the next four or five
years.
If a player doesn't like his host
or the host himself appears dis
gruntled with the school, it's likely
the recruit will matriculate else
where.
The hosts take the recruits to
their lodgings at the Holiday Inn,
and then everyone is back at 4:30
for a social hour in the Hall of
Fame Room in Encina Gym.

After the social hour they head
over to the Faculty Club for a buffet
dinner and short talks by adminis
trators and several current football
players. Defensive back Rob
Englehardt talks about dispelling
Stanford's effete image by winning
at Texas, while offensive lineman
Chuck Gillingham tells the recruits
he's planning on going to the Rose
Bowl and they wouldn't be here if
they weren't, too.
The Cal basketball game follows,
and the recruits are released with
their hosts to sample Stanford
nightlife, which for most means par
ties at the KAs and Delts.
Sunday begins with a faculty
brunch at the Holiday Inn. Elway
rumbles in a half an hour late, and
the affair is generally low-key. In
addition to a student host, each
recruit is assigned a faculty host,
and they all have brunch together
Sunday morning. The faculty, as
well as parents and athletes, seem
to enjoy the event, and several
senior faculty members, including
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow, a
Nobel Laureate, participate.
Position meetings follow the
brunch, and the recruits and those
parents who want to attend break
up into small groups with the as
sistant coaches. These meetings can
get highly technical and involve
philosophies, diagrams and film
review. It's really the only time
during the weekend that football is

the main topic of conversation.
Parents and athletes then split
up for the rest of the day. Student
hostesses escort parents around
campus, while players tour the
weight room, and then the two
groups switch.
Sunday dinner is at faculty homes
for the parents and Sundance for
the players. Lough and Roghair are
sitting with current players
Englehardt, quarterback Greg En
nis and running back Scott Eschel
man. At dinner Lough says he is
virtually committed to Stanford
pending his admissions decision and
is even talking about cancelling his
trip to UCLA.
One of the assistants comes by
and jokingly says that most schools
would hide a guy like Ennis from
recruits, but soon Ennis is telling
Lough and Roghair how much the
coaching staff is concerned about
the players. In one of the few
serious moments of the dinner, En
nis relates how he feels several
coaches have become his good
friends and how Elway, unlike many
head coaches, truly cares about his
players.
The athletes then head off for
Flicks or other entertainment, and
a recruiting weekend is winding to
a close.
The process is entering a crucial
time with the Feb. 10 letter of intent
signing date rapidly approaching,
and decisions must be made.

Twenty-two scholarships are avail
able, and the coaches can't offer
too many athletic tenders, but they
need as full a class as possible.
Hanging over the whole conver
sation is the specter of superstar
prep quarterback Todd Marinovich.
Stanford has been recruiting him
since his freshman year of high
school, and he could single
handedly make a good class a great
one. He's at Miami this weekend
after visiting Stanford last weekend,
and he's not tipping his hand. Other
prep quarterbacks will likely wait
for Marinovich to pick a school
before they commit.
Still roughly 10 athletes have al
ready committed to Stanford, al
though the last dozen will be the
hardest. Should a scholarship be
offered to a marginal player who
wants Stanford, or should it be
saved for the wavering superstar?
Of course one will definitely be
saved for Marinovich.
It's a juggling act, and one the
players are going through, also.
Recruits are dropping visits and
adding trips as they weigh their
prospects at different schools.
One recruit who isn't wavering
is big defensive lineman Frank
Busalacchi. He committed to Stan
ford last Thursday, and he and his
parents are ecstatic on the ride to
San Jose Airport. He "loves" Stan
ford, and his parents are equally
excited about their son's future.

It's a juggling act, and one the
players are going through, also.
Recruits are dropping visits and
adding trips as they weigh their
prospects at different schools.
One recruit who isn't wavering
is big defensive lineman Frank

During the past weekend a
dozen high school football players
came to Stanford from around the
country for a 48-hour football
recruiting visit. I was given almost
total access to the process and
spent the weekend with prospective
players, current players, coaches,
parents and all the other people
involved in the recruiting of pro
spective student-athletes. What fol
lows are both a description of the
events and some impressions I
gained.

Around noon on Saturday
Dick James, the Stanford foot
ball recruiting coordinator, is
heading to San Francisco for an
airport pickup. This weekend
and the two big recruiting
weekends that immediately
preceded it are James' football
season. He has worked all year
pinpointing prospective student
athletes around the country, and
he'll run this weekend's activi
ties.
Not only has he set up travel
schedules and the overall
itinerary, but he has also briefed
the coaches through a packet of
"word pictures." These word pic
tures give biographical informa
tion on each athlete while also
outlining his personal character
istics and how to approach him.
This can include whether an ath
lete is outgoing or shy, how he's
looking at Stanford and how he
fits into Stanford's recruiting
plans.
James will be picking up Chad
Roghair, a lanky quarterback

from Rcdlands, and Charlie
Lough, a linebackcr from
Upland.
This is Roghair's first recruit
ing trip, and he'll be heading
east to Ivy League schools for
his other four visits. He's been
accepted early at Princeton and
had applied to Stanford even
before he was recruited as an
athlete.
Lough had been to California
the week before and had also
been to Colorado with a trip to
UCLA planned.
When we arrive back at Stan
ford we head to Stickney's (one
of Stanford Head Coach Jack
Elway's favorite restaurants) for
lunch. After that we take a
driving tour of the campus and
head to the Tennis Center where
all the recruits and coaches have
gathered.
Of the 13 recruits scheduled
for visits, 11 have arrived. One
hurt his ankle in a basketball
game the night before, and an
other will be arriving later from
Lander Valley, Wyo.
Also at the Tennis Center are
parents. The Stanford coaching
staff strongly encourages parents
of prospective student-athletes
to visit with their sons. Not only
do the coaches believe the par
ents should be involved in their
sons' college decision, but there
is also a feeling that parents will
see through the lure of a good
weight room or nice stadium and
be particularly attracted to the
acadcmics and caring atmos
phere Stanford provides.
Once everyone has gathered,
Elway delivers a welcome to the
group. This is his only official
action of the recruiting weekend,
and Elway plays a surprisingly
minor role in this part of the
process. This is not to say that
Elway doesn't become involved


Brendan
Healey
in recruiting, but he's much more
effective in the one-on-one relation
ships he develops when he makes
home visits.
When the athletes are on the
Farm, Elway gives them a chance
to soak up the University. If he
hasn't seen them yet in their home
or school, chances are that he will
eventually. Elway is known as a
good in-home recruiter who appeals
to parents with his family-oriented
outlook and the fact that he sent
his own son to Stanford.
After Elway speaks, the athletes
meet their student hosts. These
hosts are football players and may
be the most important aspect of a
recruiting visit. A host is possibly
the most influential person in a
player's decision, because the host
represents an athlete's potential
teammates for the next four or five
years.
If a player doesn't like his host
or the host himself appears dis
gruntled with the school, it's likely
the recruit will matriculate else
where.
The hosts take the recruits to
their lodgings at the Holiday Inn,
and then everyone is back at 4:30
for a social hour in the Hall of
Fame Room in Encina Gym.

After the social hour they head
over to the Faculty Club for a buffet
dinner and short talks by adminis
trators and several current football
players. Defensive back Rob
Englehardt talks about dispelling
Stanford's effete image by winning
at Texas, while offensive lineman
Chuck Gillingham tells the recruits
he's planning on going to the Rose
Bowl and they wouldn't be here if
they weren't, too.
The Cal basketball game follows,
and the recruits are released with
their hosts to sample Stanford
nightlife, which for most means par
ties at the KAs and Delts.
Sunday begins with a faculty
brunch at the Holiday Inn. Elway
rumbles in a half an hour late, and
the affair is generally low-key. In
addition to a student host, each
recruit is assigned a faculty host,
and they all have brunch together
Sunday morning. The faculty, as
well as parents and athletes, seem
to enjoy the event, and several
senior faculty members, including
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow, a
Nobel Laureate, participate.
Position meetings follow the
brunch, and the recruits and those
parents who want to attend break
up into small groups with the as
sistant coaches. These meetings can
get highly technical and involve
philosophies, diagrams and film
review. It's really the only time
during the weekend that football is

the main topic of conversation.
Parents and athletes then split
up for the rest of the day. Student
hostesses escort parents around
campus, while players tour the
weight room, and then the two
groups switch.
Sunday dinner is at faculty homes
for the parents and Sundance for
the players. Lough and Roghair are
sitting with current players
Englehardt, quarterback Greg En
nis and running back Scott Eschel
man. At dinner Lough says he is
virtually committed to Stanford
pending his admissions decision and
is even talking about cancelling his
trip to UCLA.
One of the assistants comes by
and jokingly says that most schools
would hide a guy like Ennis from
recruits, but soon Ennis is telling
Lough and Roghair how much the
coaching staff is concerned about
the players. In one of the few
serious moments of the dinner, En
nis relates how he feels several
coaches have become his good
friends and how Elway, unlike many
head coaches, truly cares about his
players.
The athletes then head off for
Flicks or other entertainment, and
a recruiting weekend is winding to
a close.
The process is entering a crucial
time with the Feb. 10 letter of intent
signing date rapidly approaching,
and decisions must be made.

Twenty-two scholarships are avail
able, and the coaches can't offer
too many athletic tenders, but they
need as full a class as possible.
Hanging over the whole conver
sation is the specter of superstar
prep quarterback Todd Marinovich.
Stanford has been recruiting him
since his freshman year of high
school, and he could single
handedly make a good class a great
one. He's at Miami this weekend
after visiting Stanford last weekend,
and he's not tipping his hand. Other
prep quarterbacks will likely wait
for Marinovich to pick a school
before they commit.
Still roughly 10 athletes have al
ready committed to Stanford, al
though the last dozen will be the
hardest. Should a scholarship be
offered to a marginal player who
wants Stanford, or should it be
saved for the wavering superstar?
Of course one will definitely be
saved for Marinovich.
It's a juggling act, and one the
players are going through, also.

adding trips as they weigh their
prospects at different schools.

after visiting Stanford last weekend,
and he's not tipping his hand. Other
prep quarterbacks will likely wait
for Marinovich to pick a school
before they commit.
Still roughly 10 athletes have al
ready committed to Stanford, al
though the last dozen will be the
hardest. Should a scholarship be
offered to a marginal player who
wants Stanford, or should it be
saved for the wavering superstar?
Of course one will definitely be
saved for Marinovich.
It's a juggling act, and one the
players are going through, also.
Recruits are dropping visits and
adding trips as they weigh their
prospects at different schools.
One recruit who isn't wavering
is big defensive lineman Frank
Busalacchi. He committed to Stan
ford last Thursday, and he and his
parents are ecstatic on the ride to
San Jose Airport. He "loves" Stan
ford, and his parents are equally
excited about their son's future.
