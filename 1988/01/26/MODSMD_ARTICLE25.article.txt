# Baseball team looks to repeat
## 
### Chris Myers Editorial staff 
Spring has arrived early, and with
it comes baseball season.
The Stanford nine will begin
defense of its NCAA championship
Friday, hosting Santa Clara at 2:30
p.m. at Sunken Diamond. The Car
dinal will then take on a squad of
Stanford alumni in an exhibition
game Saturday at 1 p.m., before
traveling to Santa Clara Sunday to
face the Broncos again at 1 p.m..
After going 53-17 last season and
winning the College World Series
in Omaha, Neb., last June, the Car
dinal won't sneak up on Santa Clara
or anyone else this year.
"Winning the national champion
ship gives you a lot of recognition,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "The flip side of that is that
you don't surprise anybody;

everybody you play wants to beat
you because you're the defending
champions . . . but I'd like to have
that problem every year."
Whether or not Marquess will
have that problem next year will
depend largely on how well the
team fills the gaps left by the depar
ture of three regulars and three
pitchers from last year's team.
Graduation took left-fielder Ruben
Amaro, center-fielder Toi Cook and
shortstop David Esquer, as well as
pitchers Rob Wassenaar and A 1
Osuna. The major leagues took ace
pitcher Jack McDowell, who won
two games in the College World
Series, then went 3-0 in four starts
with the Chicago White Sox after
a call-up from the minors in Sep
tember.
Still, the cupboard is far from
bare. The Cardinal may have lost

some great players, but that's like
a centipede losing a few legs: there
are plenty more where those came
from.
"Talent-wise, we're right with last
year's team," junior second
baseman Frank Carey said. "Of
course, you never know if a team's
going to come together and gel like
last year's did."
"We have a real solid nucleus
back," junior pitcher Steve Chitren
said. "The big problem will be trying
to battle complacency."
Comparisons with last year's
team are unavoidable, but this
year's team is different not only
from that team but also from typical
Stanford teams during Marquess'
11-year stint as coach.
Traditionally, Marquess builds
his teams around pitching, defense
and speed.

But if the typical Stanford team
is like a sports car — high
performance, fuel-efficient, built for
speed and occasional bursts of
power — then this year's team is
a log truck — bigger, stronger, but
definitely not faster.
"This team has no speed, or very
little speed, which is unusual for
us," Marquess said. "So it's going
to have to be a different kind of
team. It's going to be an adjustment
for me — I'll have to sit on my
hands more."
In the past, once Stanford
baserunners were on first they had
an uncanny knack for getting home
somehow — a stolen base here, a
hit-and-run or sacrifice bunt there.
This year, the options are more
limited.
"We're not going to be able to
get runs one base at a time," junior
third baseman Ed Sprague said.
"We're going to have to hit the
ball. In the past, if we weren't hit
ting, we could scrape up a run and
hope for a shutout (from the pitch
ing staff). This year we're gonna
have to hit it in the gaps."
And wait for the long ball. But
that wait usually won't be long.
Lurking in the middle of the Car
dinal batting order are four hitters
capable of hitting 10 or more home
runs each this year. Sprague hit 16
last year. Sophomore right-fielder
Paul Carey hit 12, junior Ron Wit
meyer had eight and senior catcher
Doug Robbins had four. Each of
them will probably increase those
numbers this year. Marquess is ex
pecting big things from Robbins in
particular. "I think you're going to
see Doug hit 10 home runs this
year," Marquess said.
Further down in the order are
two more players — sophomore
left-fielder Brian Johnson and
junior designated hitter Jeff
Saenger — who can hit for power.
Johnson hit 33 home runs (includ
ing one in a game at Candlestick
Park) in his last two years at Skyline
High School in Oakland. But he
batted only 47 times last season
and will no doubt benefit from a
chance to hit regularly this year.

to have to be a different kind of
team. It's going to be an adjustment
for me — I'll have to sit on my
hands more."
In the past, once Stanford
baserunners were on first they had
an uncanny knack for getting home
somehow — a stolen base here, a
hit-and-run or sacrifice bunt there.
This year, the options are more
limited.
"We're not going to be able to
get runs one base at a time," junior
third baseman Ed Sprague said.
"We're going to have to hit the
ball. In the past, if we weren't hit
ting, we could scrape up a run and
hope for a shutout (from the pitch
ing staff). This year we're gonna
have to hit it in the gaps."
And wait for the long ball. But
that wait usually won't be long.
Lurking in the middle of the Car
dinal batting order are four hitters
capable of hitting 10 or more home
runs each this year. Sprague hit 16
last year. Sophomore right-fielder
Paul Carey hit 12, junior Ron Wit
meyer had eight and senior catcher
Doug Robbins had four. Each of
them will probably increase those
numbers this year. Marquess is ex
pecting big things from Robbins in
particular. "I think you're going to
see Doug hit 10 home runs this
year," Marquess said.
Further down in the order are
two more players — sophomore
left-fielder Brian Johnson and
junior designated hitter Jeff
Saenger — who can hit for power.
Johnson hit 33 home runs (includ
ing one in a game at Candlestick
Park) in his last two years at Skyline
High School in Oakland. But he
batted only 47 times last season
and will no doubt benefit from a
chance to hit regularly this year.

Sophomore right-Fielder Paul Carey, last year's College World Series MVP, is a preseason All-America pick
as the Cardinal begins its quest for a second straight national championship.
Spring has arrived early, and with
it comes baseball season.
The Stanford nine will begin
defense of its NCAA championship
Friday, hosting Santa Clara at 2:30
p.m. at Sunken Diamond. The Car
dinal will then take on a squad of
Stanford alumni in an exhibition
game Saturday at 1 p.m., before
traveling to Santa Clara Sunday to
face the Broncos again at 1 p.m..
After going 53-17 last season and
winning the College World Series
in Omaha, Neb., last June, the Car
dinal won't sneak up on Santa Clara
or anyone else this year.
"Winning the national champion
ship gives you a lot of recognition,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "The flip side of that is that
you don't surprise anybody;

everybody you play wants to beat
you because you're the defending
champions . . . but I'd like to have
that problem every year."
Whether or not Marquess will
have that problem next year will
depend largely on how well the
team fills the gaps left by the depar
ture of three regulars and three
pitchers from last year's team.
Graduation took left-fielder Ruben
Amaro, center-fielder Toi Cook and
shortstop David Esquer, as well as
pitchers Rob Wassenaar and A 1
Osuna. The major leagues took ace
pitcher Jack McDowell, who won
two games in the College World
Series, then went 3-0 in four starts
with the Chicago White Sox after
a call-up from the minors in Sep
tember.
Still, the cupboard is far from
bare. The Cardinal may have lost

some great players, but that's like
a centipede losing a few legs: there
are plenty more where those came
from.
"Talent-wise, we're right with last
year's team," junior second
baseman Frank Carey said. "Of
course, you never know if a team's
going to come together and gel like
last year's did."
"We have a real solid nucleus
back," junior pitcher Steve Chitren
said. "The big problem will be trying
to battle complacency."
Comparisons with last year's
team are unavoidable, but this
year's team is different not only
from that team but also from typical
Stanford teams during Marquess'
11-year stint as coach.
Traditionally, Marquess builds
his teams around pitching, defense
and speed.

But if the typical Stanford team
is like a sports car — high
performance, fuel-efficient, built for
speed and occasional bursts of
power — then this year's team is
a log truck — bigger, stronger, but
definitely not faster.
"This team has no speed, or very
little speed, which is unusual for
us," Marquess said. "So it's going
to have to be a different kind of
team. It's going to be an adjustment
for me — I'll have to sit on my
hands more."
In the past, once Stanford
baserunners were on first they had
