# Card lacrosse team beefing up
## NCAA tourney a realistic goal 
### Robert Pardington Staff writer 
Having gained NCAA certifica
tion as a varsity team last year, the
Stanford lacrosse team has begun
training in earnest for the upcoming
season.
Lacrosse is still officially a club
sport, and the Cardinal is a member
of the Western Collegiate Lacrosse
League.
Last year, Whittier College took
the WCLL championship. Among
the other teams in the league are
California, Arizona, Arizona State
and UC-Santa Barbara.
The Cardinal went to the final
four of the WCLL last year, losing
to Whittier in the semifinals.
Should Stanford take the WCLL
championship, it would go to the
NCAA championships at Syracuse
in May. There, the Cardinal would
encounter stiff competition from
the high-caliber East Coast teams.
Stanford returns 15 players, with
only four having graduated. The
majority of the team is from the
Atlantic Coast, with several coming
from Maryland.
A possible weakness for the
squad is depth, a traditonal strength
of Stanford. The veteran players
are taking measures to compensate
for the fault.
"We're going to try to use our
defensemcn to full advantage,"
senior midfielder Vinny Frost said.
"Our transition game has to be
stronger."
Steeling themselves for the rigors
of upcoming competition, the 23
members of the A squad have taken
up weightlifting.
"We have a lot of good freshman
prospects," senior co-captain Peter
Manos said. "Both our attack and
defense should be strong. It's some

what of a rebuilding year for the
midfield."
For those readers unfamiliar with
lacrosse, here are some of the
basics: the full-contact sport pits
two teams of 10 players, each wield
ing a long stick with a net on the
end. Players catch and shoot a small
hard ball into a slightly larger than
hockey-sized goal. Goals are worth
one point each.
"Lacrosse has been called the
fastest game on foot," senior co
captain Dave Adams said. "It's
comparable to ice hockey on land."
Stanford attacker Rob Lamkin
was the leading scorer last year,
averaging four points (goals and as
sists) per contest. Lamkin, unfor
tunately, will be out three weeks
with a broken ankle.

called the fastest game
on foot. It's compara
ble to ice hockey on
land.'

In its first game last fall, the Car
dinal downed Cal 14-7 in a
preseason matchup for Bay Area
superiority.
The Cardinal plays its home
games on the Lacrosse Field (next
to Maples Pavilion) Saturdays at 1
p.m. This Saturday, Stanford hosts
a mini-tournament in preparation
for a clash with Claremont-
McKenna College at home on Sun
day.
