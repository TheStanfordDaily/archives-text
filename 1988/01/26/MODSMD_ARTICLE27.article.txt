Relying on its foil squad and
battling injuries, the Stanford
men's fencing team won only one
of four matches Saturday at Cal
State-Fullcrton.
The Cardinal beat the host
team 18-9, then dropped
matches with Long Beach State
and UC-San Diego by one and
two bouts, respectively.
The men's foil team led the
way for Stanford, winning 24 out
of 36 bouts. Senior Chris Gillen
went undefeated on the day.
Sophomore Duncan Bell won 10
of 12 bouts.
Bell lost only to Air Force,
but the performance of the Stan
ford fencers against the talented
Falcon squad impressed Cardi
nal Men's Coach Zoran Tulum.
"Air Force has a double West
Coast champion, Tommy Guer
ra," Tulum said, "Two of our
fencers beat him."
Gillen and Bell defeated
Guerra 5-1.
The men's sabre team did not
fare as well. At the beginning of
the first match, against Long
Beach, captain Dave Russ
sprained his ankle.
"It is almost impossible to
fence sabre with an injured leg,"
Tulum said. "The only strategy
is defense."
He explained that Russ was
limited to defensive parries and
riposts but was never able to
make any attacks because of the
ankle.
Despite the handicap, though,
Russ recorded a respectable
mark of 5-4.
After defeating Fullerton, the
men's team lost to Long Beach
14-13, San Diego 15-12 and Air
Force 16-11.
The team's biggest handicap

was itself. The epee team,
coupled with the injury to Russ,
pulled down the whole team.
The epee team is the least
experienced weapon on the Stan
ford squad. Some that fenced
Saturday had never been to a
collegiate tournament before.
The epee team won only
against Fullerton, by an 8-1
score.
The Stanford men's sabre
team was comprised of Russ and
sophomores Douglas Flinn and
Jim Farrell. The men's epee
team was senior Stephen
Schmidt, freshman Joseph
Elizondo and sophomores Peter
Duimstra and Richard Reader.
The foil team consisted of
seniors Gillen and Craig Ring,
freshman Stan Brobston and
sophomore Bell.
The women's team, led by
junior Elisabeth Spilman, turned
in a balanced performance. This
team also had some people that
had never been to a collegiate
competition.
The women's team beat Ful
lterton 13-3 and San Diego 11-5.
It lost to Long Beach 12-4 and
Air Force 10-6.
Spilman was 12-4 on the day.
The women's team is also
hampered by a key injury, with
senior captain Alexandra Rankin
side-lined by an ankle injury.
Rankin expects to have her
ankle out of the cast and be
back for the regional competition
taking place the first weekend
in March.
The women's foil team in
cludes Spilman, senior Laurel
Mend, sophomores Vanessa
Southern and Grace Chang and
freshman Olivia Judson.
The Cardinal returns to Roble
Gym to take on San Francisco
State Saturday.
