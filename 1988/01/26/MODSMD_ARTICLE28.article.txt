# Jennifer Azzi leads stellar Stanford backcourt
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
After watching a Stanford women's basketball
game this season, two things become readily
apparent to the spectator: Stanford has a quality
team, and floor captain Jennifer Azzi is one
great player.
Honored as the Pacific 10 Conference Player
of the Week six weeks ago and rating well
statistically in categories as diverse as 3-point
field goals made and total assists, the Oak Ridge,
Tenn., native has been instrumental in leading
the Cardinal to its first ever top-20 ranking and
an impressive 16-1 record, establishing herself
as one of the premier cagers on the West Coast
in the process.
However, beneath the facade of a lean, mean
competitor lies a much different Jennifer Azzi.
Off the court, the sophomore is articulate and
personable, an individual who has shattered the
stereotypes plaguing others in her sport.
"I'd say she's one of my closest friends," junior
center Jill Yanke said. "I have a lot of respect
for her. She's fun to talk to, she's fun to be
with and she is always up to go out and do fun
things."
"She's got a great personality," Yanke con
tinued. "She's not all basketball. It's an impor
tant part of her life, but she's not like Miss
Basketball of Stanford. She likes to go out at
night and have fun with everybody. She loves
to go shopping, she likes to go to the City, she
likes to go to the beach and lay out. She's just
a normal person."
A normal person who plays great basketball,
that is. After a stellar prep career which she
capped by leading Oak Ridge High School to
a 34-2 record and the state finals in 1986 while
she garnered honors as the East Tennessee High
School Player of the Year, Azzi came to the
Farm as one of the gems in Tara VanDerveer's

sparkling first recruiting class at Stanford.
At that point, Stanford hardly had a program
that would attract a player of Azzi's caliber in
the same way that Ohio State and Vanderbilt,
her other choices, would have. Nonetheless, the
Cardinal beat out the perennial powerhouses
and earned her services.
"It was sort of a gut feeling, I guess," Azzi
said of her decision to come to Stanford. "It
was the only place that I really wanted to go.
Ohio State had its drawbacks, and so did Van
derbilt."
"For Stanford, the only drawback was that
previously they weren't that good of a team,
didn't have that great of a program. But they
brought in this new coach and her coaching
staff, so it looked like an ideal situation: I could
help build a program, plus my parents really
wanted me to come here. They played a big
factor."
"She was basically an adventuresome person,
and she was willing to take a chance by going
to a program that was basically nowhere," Van-
Derveer said. "Stanford is not really on the
basketball map, but she was willing to meet the
challenge."
Meet it she has. Azzi started in every game
but one last season and played well enough to
secure a spot on the 1987 Pac-10 All-Freshman
team. Her play this year is even better, surpass
ing the expectations held by the coaching staff
after seeing her play in high school.
"We knew we wanted to run, and we needed
a point guard to push the ball upcourt," Van-
Derveer said. "At the time we didn't see her
as much as a scorer, but she has worked hard
in the off-season and developed into a shooter,
especially a 3-point shooter."
"She comes from a winning program and is
very competitive, and we need players of that
caliber on our team," the Cardinal coach added.
Her competitive nature and intensity have

been the keys to Azzi's on-court success. Her
attitude has earned her the respect of her team
mates and simply intimidates the opposition.
"She doesn't seem to get discouraged," Van-
Derveer said. "Although she's been in a lot of
situations that are very frustrating, but especially
this year she is really tuning into coaching more.
She seems a lot more open to suggestion and
is really working on improving her weaknesses."
"She's definitely a leader," Yanke said. "She
plays the guard position, which means that she's
like the quarterback of the team because she
runs the offense. She does get people fired up.
She is the inspiration for our team."
"I think she's determined," the Cardinal cen
ter continued. "She's always working hard in
the off-season and she's constantly asking people
for tips on how she should work out, what she
can do to improve her shots and her drive,
anything like that. She wants to do well, whatever
it takes to be like that."
Though all of this praise of her play pleases
the sophomore, Azzi would rather people think
of her more as a person and not just an athlete.
"I guess one thing that always bothered me was
'Jennifer Azzi — oh, she's the basketball player!'
I'd rather hear, 'Jennifer Azzi — oh, she's a
nice person, I really like her' instead of, 'This
is a basketball player.' "
"I just don't like the stereotypes involved with
athletes," the sophomore said. "One thing that
gets to me is when people think of female
athletes as weird or something."
"This is very important (to me), and the reason
I've stuck with it (basketball) is because people
believe that women athletes aren't feminine, are
jocks," Azzi continued. "I just completely don't
agree with that, and I hope people don't think
of me that way. I'd like for mem to think of
me as just a normal person who is also an
athlete, instead of a female jock who happens
to be nice."

and earned her services.
"It was sort of a gut feeling, I guess," Azzi
said of her decision to come to Stanford. "It
was the only place that I really wanted to go.
Ohio State had its drawbacks, and so did Van
derbilt."
"For Stanford, the only drawback was that
previously they weren't that good of a team,
didn't have that great of a program. But they
brought in this new coach and her coaching
staff, so it looked like an ideal situation: I could
help build a program, plus my parents really
wanted me to come here. They played a big
factor."
"She was basically an adventuresome person,
and she was willing to take a chance by going
to a program that was basically nowhere," Van-
Derveer said. "Stanford is not really on the
basketball map, but she was willing to meet the
challenge."
Meet it she has. Azzi started in every game
but one last season and played well enough to
secure a spot on the 1987 Pac-10 All-Freshman
team. Her play this year is even better, surpass
ing the expectations held by the coaching staff
after seeing her play in high school.
"We knew we wanted to run, and we needed
a point guard to push the ball upcourt," Van-
Derveer said. "At the time we didn't see her
as much as a scorer, but she has worked hard
in the off-season and developed into a shooter,
especially a 3-point shooter."
"She comes from a winning program and is
very competitive, and we need players of that
caliber on our team," the Cardinal coach added.
Her competitive nature and intensity have

been the keys to Azzi's on-court success. Her
attitude has earned her the respect of her team
mates and simply intimidates the opposition.
"She doesn't seem to get discouraged," Van-
Derveer said. "Although she's been in a lot of
situations that are very frustrating, but especially
this year she is really tuning into coaching more.
She seems a lot more open to suggestion and
is really working on improving her weaknesses."
"She's definitely a leader," Yanke said. "She
plays the guard position, which means that she's
like the quarterback of the team because she
runs the offense. She does get people fired up.
She is the inspiration for our team."
"I think she's determined," the Cardinal cen
ter continued. "She's always working hard in
the off-season and she's constantly asking people
for tips on how she should work out, what she
can do to improve her shots and her drive,
anything like that. She wants to do well, whatever
it takes to be like that."
Though all of this praise of her play pleases
the sophomore, Azzi would rather people think
of her more as a person and not just an athlete.
"I guess one thing that always bothered me was
'Jennifer Azzi — oh, she's the basketball player!'
I'd rather hear, 'Jennifer Azzi — oh, she's a
nice person, I really like her' instead of, 'This
is a basketball player.' "
"I just don't like the stereotypes involved with
athletes," the sophomore said. "One thing that
gets to me is when people think of female
athletes as weird or something."
"This is very important (to me), and the reason
I've stuck with it (basketball) is because people
believe that women athletes aren't feminine, are
jocks," Azzi continued. "I just completely don't
agree with that, and I hope people don't think
of me that way. I'd like for mem to think of
me as just a normal person who is also an
athlete, instead of a female jock who happens
to be nice."

Stanford's Jennifer Azzi leads the Pac-10 in assists and is Nth in the
nation in 3-point scoring.
After watching a Stanford women's basketball
game this season, two things become readily
apparent to the spectator: Stanford has a quality
team, and floor captain Jennifer Azzi is one
great player.
Honored as the Pacific 10 Conference Player
of the Week six weeks ago and rating well
statistically in categories as diverse as 3-point
field goals made and total assists, the Oak Ridge,
Tenn., native has been instrumental in leading
the Cardinal to its first ever top-20 ranking and
an impressive 16-1 record, establishing herself
as one of the premier cagers on the West Coast
in the process.
However, beneath the facade of a lean, mean
competitor lies a much different Jennifer Azzi.
Off the court, the sophomore is articulate and
personable, an individual who has shattered the
stereotypes plaguing others in her sport.
"I'd say she's one of my closest friends," junior
center Jill Yanke said. "I have a lot of respect
for her. She's fun to talk to, she's fun to be
with and she is always up to go out and do fun
things."
"She's got a great personality," Yanke con
tinued. "She's not all basketball. It's an impor
tant part of her life, but she's not like Miss
Basketball of Stanford. She likes to go out at
night and have fun with everybody. She loves
to go shopping, she likes to go to the City, she
likes to go to the beach and lay out. She's just
a normal person."
A normal person who plays great basketball,
that is. After a stellar prep career which she
capped by leading Oak Ridge High School to
a 34-2 record and the state finals in 1986 while
she garnered honors as the East Tennessee High
School Player of the Year, Azzi came to the
Farm as one of the gems in Tara VanDerveer's

sparkling first recruiting class at Stanford.
At that point, Stanford hardly had a program
that would attract a player of Azzi's caliber in
the same way that Ohio State and Vanderbilt,
her other choices, would have. Nonetheless, the
Cardinal beat out the perennial powerhouses
and earned her services.
"It was sort of a gut feeling, I guess," Azzi
said of her decision to come to Stanford. "It
