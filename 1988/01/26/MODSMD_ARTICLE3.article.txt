# State of the Union address
## Profs, call Reagan view 'ironic' 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
The Reagan administration has "re
claimed and restored the American
dream" at a critical moment in world
history, President Ronald Reagan told the
nation last night in his final State of the
Union address.
But scholars here were less than praise
ful of the president's speech, calling it
"ironic" and characterizing it as "dramatic
theater."
Senior Hoover Research Fellow John
Bunzel praised Reagan's delivery but dis
missed the seriousness of the address.
"Once again, the president was the
'master communicator' and created an
image of America which he deeply

believes in," Bunzel said, who added that
the speech was "dramatic theater at best."
Political Science Prof. John Manley
pointed to the "irony" in Reagan's "Amer
ican Dream."
"He is the chief spokesman of a far
right version of [an] American Dream
which is elitist, competitive, Adam Smith
ian," Manley said, adding that many of
Reagan's policies actually inhibit
Americans from achieving the American
Dream.
Manley said the president's support of
spending cuts in housing and student loans
were inconsistent with his vision of the
Dream.
"His version of the American Dream
is a fantastic trip to a world that has no
reality," he added.

In his address. Reagan acknowledged
that the national budget has remained
unbalanced during his two terms, saying
the"budget process has broken down."
The president callcd for "a joint agree
ment (between the president and
Congress) that sets out the spending
priorities within available deadlines . ..
to avoid presidential budgets that get dis
carded and congressional budget resolu
tions that are not enforced."
He also advocated a line-item veto on
appropriations bills and a constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced budget.
Bunzel expressed doubt that the
Democrat-controlled Congress would
grant a Republican president the line-item
veto, which allows the president to
delete specific items from a bill
before signing it.
Currently, a president must veto
an entire bill if he does not wish
a specific item on a bill to become
law.
"[Even if] they believe in a line
item veto, a Democratic Congress
would wait for a Democratic ad
ministration" before granting that
veto power, Bunzel said.
In addition, Reagan called for a
"bipartisan consensus for the cause

of world freedom" before he leaves
office. He praised what he called
the "freedom fighters" of Afghani
stan and Nicaragua, and made a
modest appeal for a new contra-aid
package he will present to Congress
next month.
Political Scicnce Assoc. Prof.
Condoleezza Rice said Reagan's
latest appeal for contra aid will
"probably come down to other is
sues" besides the strength of his
appeals.
"A lot depends on how the public
perceives the chances for peace in
Nicaragua," she said.
Rice said the Democratic
majority in the Congress has hurt
Reagan's political clout.
