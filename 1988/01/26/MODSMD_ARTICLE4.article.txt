# Job prospects good for grads
## MSU study foresees increase in jobs despite stock crash 
### Leslie Saul 
The October stock market crash
will not hurt the job prospects of
the Class of 1088, according to a
recent nationwide survey of
employers conducted by a re
searcher at Michigan State Univer
sity.
The study predicts a 3.8-percent
national increase in hiring from the
Class of '88 compared to the Class
of '87, and an average annual start
ing salary for those with bachelor's
degrees of $22,609 — a 3.2-percent
increase over last year.
Although starting salaries for
women and minorities are expected
to increase by only 2.5 percent,
employers responding to the survey
indicated that the salary outlook is
"very good" for these groups,
despite the disparity between these
groups and the graduating popula
tion at large.
The director of Stanford's Career
Planning and Placement Center,
Ruth Schneider, noted that salaries
of Stanford graduates will likely be
higher than the national average.
"Stanford students will be at the
high end of the salary range in
everything," Schneider said.
According to Schneider, a recent

CPPC survey found that 1987 Stan
ford engineering graduates earned
$141 more than the national
monthly average — a trend she said
is characteristic of Stanford
graduates in all fields.
The Michigan State survey indi
cated that students majoring in
computer science, electrical engi
neering, accounting, financial ad
ministration, mechanical engineer
ing, education, industrial engineer
ing and chemical engineering are
most in demand by employers.
Graduates in less demand include
those majoring in retailing, adver
tising, communications, personnel
administration, art, journalism, so
cial sciences, home ecology, natural
resources and agriculture.
But Schneider emphasized that
liberal arts skills — writing, organ
izing, analyzing and planning — arc
becoming more and more desirable
in the job market. She cited as
proof of this trend the growing num
ber of accounting firms that recruit
undergraduates here, even though
Stanford docs not offer a bachelor's
degree in accounting.
Most of the liberal arts majors
were hired by the military, service
and volunteer organizations, mer
chandisers, publishers and banks,

according to Schneider.
"If you can talk the game, it
doesn't matter what your major is.
What's really important is that you
know that you're interested in a
certain field," she said, adding that
Stanford students know what they
want and can persuade prospective
employers better than most other
students.
Those expected to land the high
est starting salaries, according to
the Michigan State survey, arc
chemical engineers ($30,197), elec
trical engineers ($29,924), mechan
ical engineers ($29,457) and com
puter scientists ($28,331).
Some of the lowest starting
salaries are expected in the fields
of journalism ($19,843), home eco
nomics ($17,398), retailing
($17,035) and geology ($16,649).
Jack Shingleton, the director of
the Career Placement Center at
Michigan State and director of the
survey, agreed with Schneider in
emphasizing the need for students
to choose careers based on their
interests. "It would be a big mistake
for students to choose a career path
based on salaries or on the supply
and demand ratio. The most im
portant thing is to do what you
enjoy," he told The Daily.
