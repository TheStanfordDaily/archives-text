# Foothills plan meets Palo Alto opposition

### Todd Pierce Editorial staff 
Stanford's long-range Foothills develop
ment plan, submitted to Palo Alto City of
ficals last week, is meeting with substantial
criticism from city officials and residents who
had hoped the University would set aside
several hundred acres for parks.
The controversial Stanford Foothills
Region Plan, presented to the Palo Alto
Planning Commission last week, allows con
stuction of buildings intended for low
intensity academic use and prohibits con
struction in a 180-acre tract and another 135
acres of creekside space.
Artists' studios, which are low-intensity ac
ademic structures, will be built in forested
areas of the Foothills, according to University
officials.
"The site is ideal and the studios fit in
the Foothills plan perfectly. The plan is an
internal document that the Stanford Planning
Staff has put together," said Andrew Doty,
Stanford's director of Community Affairs. "If
a facility needs to be isolated and has low
intensity academic use then we'll look at the
Foothills."

But members of the Palo Alto Planning
Commission think the plan is a prelude to
greater development. Commission Chair El
len Christensen said she was "very disap
pointed" with the acreage alloted for open
space. "It's a way to get people to start
thinking that's how the Foothills should be
used. If something appears on the horizon
then they have a plan," she said.
Commissioner Helene Wheeler was upset
that she had less than a week to review the
plan before the meeting, receiving a copy on
the Friday before Wednesday's meeting.
Wheeler added that the commission was
"extremely worried" about the plan. "Stan
ford essentially said to us that it was going
to disregard criticism related to visual im
pact."
Ken Schreiber, director of Planning and
Community Environment for Palo Alto, sug
gested the University set aside four areas in
the Foothills that would be free from con
struction. But Stanford officials deemed the
request of 630 acres of parks excessive and
limiting to planning decisions, according to
Doty.
"The trustees couldn't write off
the land. Stanford's record for plan
ning standards are clear and have
set an example for the entire area,"
Doty said.
Enid Pearson, president of the
Committee for Green Foothills, a
local citizens' group, said Stanford
had formulated the plan "more or
less in secret" and called it typical
of the University's tendency to "go
ahead and do things without think
ing of the impact on surrounding
communities."
"Stanford clearly plans to develop

in the Foothills. In the plan there's
a map with roads and culs-de
sac.... They don't call it develop
ment. Stanford has had concessions
any developer would die for," she
said.
Doty said Pearson was over
reacting. "It's absurd. It's not a mat
ter of secrecy at all. It has been
presented as an internal document
that the Stanford Planning Staff has
put together so Stanford can have
sites," he said. "Enid Pearson has
nothing to fear. This is all much
ado about nothing."
Pearson claimed that if the Uni
versity "were more open then they
wouldn't need Doty to apologize to
local communities."
