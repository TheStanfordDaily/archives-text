# Foothills plan meets Palo Alto opposition

### Todd Pierce Editorial staff 
Stanford's long-range Foothills develop
ment plan, submitted to Palo Alto City of
ficals last week, is meeting with substantial
criticism from city officials and residents who
had hoped the University would set aside
several hundred acres for parks.
The controversial Stanford Foothills
Region Plan, presented to the Palo Alto
Planning Commission last week, allows con
stuction of buildings intended for low
intensity academic use and prohibits con
struction in a 180-acre tract and another 135
acres of creekside space.
Artists' studios, which are low-intensity ac
ademic structures, will be built in forested
areas of the Foothills, according to University
officials.
"The site is ideal and the studios fit in
the Foothills plan perfectly. The plan is an
internal document that the Stanford Planning
Staff has put together," said Andrew Doty,
Stanford's director of Community Affairs. "If
a facility needs to be isolated and has low
intensity academic use then we'll look at the
Foothills."

But members of the Palo Alto Planning
Commission think the plan is a prelude to
greater development. Commission Chair El
len Christensen said she was "very disap
pointed" with the acreage alloted for open
space. "It's a way to get people to start
thinking that's how the Foothills should be
used. If something appears on the horizon
then they have a plan," she said.
Commissioner Helene Wheeler was upset
that she had less than a week to review the
plan before the meeting, receiving a copy on
the Friday before Wednesday's meeting.
Wheeler added that the commission was
"extremely worried" about the plan. "Stan
ford essentially said to us that it was going
to disregard criticism related to visual im
pact."
Ken Schreiber, director of Planning and
Community Environment for Palo Alto, sug
gested the University set aside four areas in
the Foothills that would be free from con
struction. But Stanford officials deemed the
request of 630 acres of parks excessive and
limiting to planning decisions, according to
Doty.
