# Protesters want Prof. to give up Yale post
## 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Demanding that Stanford Law Prof. Debra
Rhode, a Yale alumna, resign her position
on the Yale University Corp., sympathizers
of a union for Yale clerical and technical
workers arc planning to distribute leaflets at
her Law School class tomorrow.
According to organizers of the group that
will be handing out the leaflets, Rhode, di
rector of Stanford's Institute for Research
on Women and Gender and a noted expert
on sex discrimination and comparable worth,
has refused to make a public statement sup
porting Yale clerical and technical workers
engaged in negotiations for pay increases and
comparable worth.
These critics assert that because of her
scholarly work, Rhode should speak out on
behalf of the technical and clerical workers
at Yale, many of whom are women.
The Yale Corp., made up of Yale alumni
and affiliates, is comparable in function to
the Stanford Board of Trustees and directs
Yale's policies on budget and labor issues.
Before Rhode's first class tomorrow,
"Gender Discrimination in the Field of Law,"
Ann Brocker, a Yale alumna, and Julie Wil
liams, a Stanford School of Education alumna
and a member of the Yale Class of '83, plan
to inform the class of "the kinds of economic
discrimination at Yale against a workforce
which is predominately female and

minorities," Brocker said.
Brocker and Williams said Rhode should
make a public statement supporting the
workers at Yale and condemning University
policy on treatment of women and minority
workers. "[Rhode] is a little hypocritical (in
not taking a public stance)," Brocker said.
Rhode declined to comment on the matter
yesterday.
Earlier this month, Rhode circulated a
letter on behalf of the faculty Women's
Caucus denouncing Stanford's policy sub
sidies for membership in organizations such
as the all-male Bohemian Club.
Williams said that as a member of the first
co-ed class at Yale and a member of the
corporation, Rhode has an obligation to sup
port the workers, many of whom are female.
"[Rhode] has stayed out of it. She is sitting,
doing paper research, while she could really
make a difference," said Williams, who was
also a clerical worker at the Yale Psychology
Department for one year.
"These are the people who do the nitty
gritty research for the professors, mostly
single mothers, who are paid extremely poorly
by the University," Williams added.
According to the Yale Daily, union officials
have accused the University of discrimination
because women and minorities are concen
trated in lower pay grades. Yale officials
contend the accusations are untrue.
The latest Yale proposal is a 5-
percent average annual wage in
crease for the next four years, while
the union is demanding an 8 per
cent increase over the same period.
The union, 34 Federation
of University Employees American
Federation of Labor Congress of
Industrial Organizations (AFL
CIO), and Yale officials extended
the Jan. 16 contract expiration date
to Jan. 24. At midnight on Sunday,
the union announced plans to con
tinue negotations. As of yesterday

a settlement had not been reached,
but a strike had not been called.
"Last week, the potential strike
was all that the students had been
talking about," said David Wyshner,
news editor of The Yale Daily
News. If the dining hall workers
were to strike, all campus dining
halls would be forced to close and
students would receive an $80 meal
plan reimbursement check.
"This has been an embarrassment
for Yale and a terrible disruption
to students," she added.
A strike would be the sixth at
Yale in 21 years. In the fall of 1984,
when the last contract terminated,
2400 workers picketed for wage in
creases.
