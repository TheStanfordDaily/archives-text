Bush, Rather trade heated insults
WASHINGTON — Vice President George Bush, grilled by
anchorman Dan Rather in an extraordinary live interview on the
CBS Evening News, last night denied concealing information on
the Iran-contra affair and accused the network of falsely suggesting
that he was lying.
Bush, who traded insults with Rather in an unusually long and
combative exchange, also charged that CBS had misled him by
saying that the topic of the interview would be for a political profile
rather than a report on his role in the Iran-contra matter. CBS
denied the vice president's charges of misrepresentation.
The 10-minute interview was preceded by a five-minute videotaped
report about Bush's role in the affair and his contention that, even
though he supported President Reagan's program of selling arms
to Iran, he had expressed reservations about the transactions.
Bush, clearly angry when the camera shifted from the introduction
to him in the vice president's office, told Rather: "You've impugned
my integrity by suggesting ... that I didn't tell the truth. You
didn't accuse me of it, but you made that suggestion."
At one point Bush, referring to an incident last year when Rather
walked off the CBS Evening News six minutes early after being
upset over having his news broadcast cut short by the network's
coverage of a tennis match, declared:
"It's not fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How
would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes
when you walked off the set in new York? Would you like that?"
Reagan introduces superpower pact
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration launched the
new U.S.-Soviet Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty toward its final
hurdle yesterday, assuring senators that the agreement will
strengthen Western nuclear deterrence and enhance the conven
tional military position of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Leading off the battle to assemble the two-thirds majority ne
cessary for the Senate to ratify the long-debated pact eliminating
ground-launched medium-range missiles, Secretary of State George
Shultz told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, "We knew
what we wanted, and we held out until we got it."
Shultz' satisfaction with the treaty was echoed by Defense Sec
retary Frank C. Carlucci, who told the Armed Services Committee,
"The key point is that the treaty, in addition to eliminating a
category of weapons in which the Soviet Union has enjoyed a
significant preponderance, will not impede NATO's ability to main
tain and modernize a credible mix of nuclear and conventional
forces."
Israeli minister defends beatings
TEL AVIV — Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday
defended his orders to use physical force, "including beatings,"
against Palestinian demonstrators.
"This policy is going to continue," Rabin said in an interview.
He conceded that there had been "a certain number" of incidents
in which soldiers exceeded army guidelines in administering beatings,
and he said the goal is to "cope more effectively" with such cases
in the future.
He specifically rejected another Cabinet minister's suggestion
over the weekend that his public endorsement of limited beatings
had been a slip of the tongue. He said that "by no means" did he
consider the policy a mistake.
Rabin's first public reference to the policy was a week ago, but
he said yesterday that it had been in effect since early January in
the hope that it would reduce the need for lethal force against
demonstrators. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said last Thursday
that the Defense Ministry's decision to use physical force had been
endorsed by the Cabinet, describing it as a policy of self-defense
and "not a violent move."
New poll shows GOP election edge
WASHINGTON — A broad public perception that Republicans
are offering the better-qualified candidates for president in 1988,
particularly on national security and tax issues, is offsetting tradi
tional Democratic advantages on domestic concerns and tilting the
odds in the November election to the GOP, according to the latest
Washington Post-ABC News poll.
Two weeks before the lowa caucuses launch the nomination
battle, two of every five Democrats surveyed say it would be better
for their party to find another candidate to nominate at the con
vention than it would be to pick one of the seven men now actively
campaigning.
Only one-tenth of the Republicans polled expressed similar dis
satisfaction with their field of six contenders.
Among registered Republicans and Republican-leaning indepen
dents in the survey, Vice President Bush led Senate Minority Leader
Robert Dole of Kansas 49 percent to 26 percent, similar to the
edge he enjoyed in an October poll. Trailing in the poll completed
Saturday were former television evangelist Pat Robertson, 8 percent;
Rep. Jack Kemp, N.Y., 6 percent, and former secretary of state
Alexander Haig Jr. and former Delaware governor Pierre "Pete"
du Pont IV, 4 percent each.
Among registered Democrats and independents who lean to the
Democrats, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and former senator
Gary Hart led the field, with 25 and 23 percent respectively. The
others were: Sen. Paul Simon, 111., 12 percent; Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, 11 percent; Sen. Albert Gore Jr., Tenn., 6 percent;
Rep. Richard Gephardt, Mo., 4 percent, and former Arizona gover
nor Bruce Babbitt, 3 percent.
Arizona's Mecham must face recall
Arizona's Secretary of State certified yesterday that the state's
beleaguered governor, Evan Mecham, must face a recall election
this spring, setting up a political contest that is likely to feature a
dozen candidates and split the Republican Party right down the
middle.
With formal notification that enough Arizonans have signed
petitions to force the recall, Mecham has a choice of resigning the
governorship by Sunday or competing in a recall election — officially
non-partisan, but already the focus of intense political maneuvering.
Mecham's office said yesterday he will not resign. If he doesn't,
the election will probably take place on May 17.
It takes only 3300 signatures to get on the recall ballot, and
preliminary indications are that about a dozen people will make
the effort. But there will probably be three chief contenders: Mec
ham, who is a conservative Republican; Carolyn Warner, the Dem
ocrat whom Mecham squeaked by in the tight 1986 gubernatorial
election; and some senior Republican figure who is likely to be
supported by most of the state's GOP establishment.
It is not completely certain who will emerge as the anti-Mecham
Republican, but a corps of business and political leaders is promoting
one of the Arizona GOP's elder statesmen, John Rhodes, the
former minority leader in the U.S. House. The 71-year-old Rhodes
initially rejected pleas that he enter the recall election, but as
pressure on him has increased he has sounded more and more like
a candidate.
