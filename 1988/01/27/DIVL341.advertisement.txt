STEP INTO TEACHING
Why not consider teaching
as a profession?
The Stanford Teacher Education Program (STEP) is a 12-month program which
leads to a California Single Subject (secondary) Teaching Credential and a Master
of Arts degree in Education. STEP students may be admitted in the areas of
English, foreign language, mathematics, or social studies.
Some paid internships are available for STEP students. A smaller number of
fellowships are also available, administered with a preference for
minority students.
Application deadline is February 15,1988.
