# Fewer apply for admission

Despite its reputation as one of
the top universities in the country,
Stanford suffered a 7-percent drop
in the number of freshman appli
cants this year.
But University officials believe
the drop may just reflect a change
in the application procedure, rather
than a decline in Stanford's
popularity.
Before this year, all applicants
who completed at least the first
step of a two-part application proc
ess were counted in the total. The
first part only required that appli
cants send in basic information and
did not involve writing essays.
This year, the application proce
dure was changed to a one-step
process that included writing essays.
This requirement may have discour
aged some potential applicants
from applying.
According to a preliminary count
released by the Admissions Office,
the number of applications received
dropped to 15,700 from last year's
16,884.
Director of Freshman Admis
sions John Bunnell said he is not
yet worried by the drop because he
has no statistics from comparable
institutions to compare with the
numbers here. "I have no idea what
the other schools' experiences are
this year," he said. "If we find out
that schools like Harvard and Yale
arc up, then I will be concerned."
Due to demographic trends, "All
admissions officers have been ex
pecting this drop for the last four
or five years," said Dean of Under
graduate Admissions Jean Fetter.
"I can't say I'm surprised."
Fetter said she believes that the
number of high school seniors ap
plying "early decision" to Eastern
schools was also down by about 7
percent this year.
In past years, approximately 15
percent of applicants failed to com
plete the second step in the Stan
ford application process. These in
complete applications were always
counted as part of the total number
of applicants to Stanford.
"I'm anxious to see how many
completed applications there are
and what the quality is," Bunnell
said, adding that this type of as
sessment will not be possible until
April.
"If the quality is up, then quantity
doesn't matter," he said.
According to Fetter, the decline
in the number of applications
relates to the declining number of
high school seniors, a demographic
trend that is predicted to continue
through the 19905. Also, Fetter said
it is possible that students are be
coming intimidated by the compet
itive admissions process at elite in
stitutions such as Stanford and
therefore do not apply.
Freshman applications to Stan
ford reached a high of 17,000 in
1984-85, Fetter's first term as dean.
Applications dropped to 16,100 the
next year, followed by last year's
16,884.
