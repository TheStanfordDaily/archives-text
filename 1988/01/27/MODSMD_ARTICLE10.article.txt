# Reagan seeks contra compromise
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion, which has decided to seek $36.25 million
in assistance for the Nicaraguan rebels but put
the military segment in escrow pending a cease
fire, struggled yesterday to find a way for both
the White House and Congress to have a role
in deciding when the military aid should begin
to flow.
Administration officials hope that a last-ditch
compromise giving Congress a voice in the mil
itary money's release will prevent House Dem
ocrats from killing the entire contra aid package
and thwarting one of President Reagan's chief
foreign policy programs.
But, fewer than 24 hours before Reagan was
to send his long-anticipated contra aid package
to Congress, his aides were still scrambling to

devise the mechanism and far from confident
they would succeed.
"It's still very much up in the air," said one
administration official, speaking on the condition
of anonymity. He said White House officials
would consult with members of Congress this
morning before making final decisions on key
details of the aid program.
The House is to vote on the package Feb. 3,
in accordance with the agreement made with
the White House last month.
Under the administration's package, $3.6 mil
lion of the aid would be spent on Redeye anti
aircraft missiles, small arms ammunition and
other weaponry. The rest would be for food,
clothing and other non-lethal aid.
But the armaments would be released only if

Nicaragua's Sandinista government and the con
tras did not reach a cease-fire and the Sandi
nistas failed tp make progress toward imple
menting promised democratic reforms.
Democratic leaders of Congress, who have
opposed Reagan's contra aid initiative, insisted
that they will reject any proposal that allows
the administration to make the decision that
the peace process is stalled and the military aid
should be sent.
Trying to keep the crucial escrow option alive,
senior White House officials were trying to ad
dress concerns that giving Congress a role in
the money's release might violate the Con
stitution's provision for separation of the
branches of government.
