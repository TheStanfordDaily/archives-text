# Aspirin found to thwart heart attacks
## 
### 
A major new study has found
that an aspirin every other day may
be highly effective in preventing
first heart attacks.
In an article scheduled for pub
lication tomorrow in the New Eng
land Journal of Medicine, research
ers said that aspirin was so effective
in reducing the risk of a heart attack
that they prematurely terminated
the long-term study so that all
22,071 participants, half of whom
did not take aspirin, could benefit
from the newly gained knowledge.

An editorial by Dr. Arnold Rel
man, the highly respected editor of
the weekly journal, called the study
"a milestone in the continuing
struggle" against heart attack.
The finding has broad implica
tions because an estimated 1.5 mil
lion Americans suffer first heart at
tacks each year and a third of them
die as a result.
In the 57-month study, whose
participants were all male
physicians, 104 out of the 11,034
who took aspirin had heart attacks,

compared to 189 heart attacks in
the 11,037 who took only a sugar
pill, or placebo. Statistically, the
numbers mean that ordinary aspirin
reduced the heart attack risk for
healthy individuals by as much as
47 percent.
Previous studies have shown that
daily aspirin use by heart attack
victims could reduce the number of
second heart attacks and thereby
save as many as 50,000 lives per
year. Such aspirin therapy is now
routine for heart attack victims.
But the new study is the first to

show that aspirin can reduce the
risk of first heart attacks.
Despite that finding, however,
physicians yesterday were not ready
to recommend that everyone take
aspirin.
"There are a number of people
who can benefit from this treat
ment, but I hope not everybody in
the United States is going to take
aspirin every morning," said Dr.
Claude Lcnfant, director of the Na
tional Heart, Lung and Blood In
stitute, which sponsored the study.
