### Brent Bigler 
Critics who planned to distribute
protest leaflets in Law Prof. Debra
Rhode's class today decided to can
cel their protest last night after Yale
University and a union representing
Yale clerical and technical workers
reached a tentative contract settle
ment yesterday.
Rhode, a Yale alumna, is a mem
ber of the board of the Yale Corp.
Rhode's critics asserted Monday
that because of her tics to Yale
and her scholarly work on sex dis
crimination and comparable worth,
she should have spoken out on be
half of the mostly female union
workers, who are members of the
Local 34 Federation of University
Employees American Federation of
Labor Congress of Industrial Or
ganizations (AFL-CIO). Critics
claimed that, given the substance
of her work, her refusal to speak
out on the negotiations was
hypocritical.
The critics had planned to dis
tribute leaflets in Rhode's class in
order to pressure her into making
a public statement on the negotia
tions.
The tentative settlement, which

averted a potential strike, extends
the union contract for four more
years. Union members will vote
soon on the proposed agreement.
Julie Williams, who received a
masters in Education from Stanford
and attended Yale as an under
graduate, was one of the organizers
of the cancelled protest.
Williams said she will be watching
Rhode's future record on labor is
sues to make sure she "puts her
money where her mouth is."
Rhode said last night that she is
"extremely pleased with the set
tlement" and that "everyone I've
talked to is relieved (that the strike
has been averted)." She added that
the agreement is "a precedent that
it's possible for the union and the
administration to bargain in good
faith without a strike."
If there had been a strike, it
would have been the sixth at Yale
in 21 years. In the fall of 1984,
after the termination of the last
contract, 2400 workers picketed for
wage increases.
If workers had struck, all campus
dining halls would have been forced
to close.
According to Williams, the union
is very pleased with the tentative

agreement, which gives the Yale
workers an annual wage increase
over each of the next four years.
Williams said the union claimed
Yale discriminated against women,
paying them lower salaries and
giving them less substantial benefits
than those awarded to male
workers.
