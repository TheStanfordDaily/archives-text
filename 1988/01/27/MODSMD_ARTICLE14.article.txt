The University's ongoing internal debate over
the future of its Western Culture requirement has
lately been transformed into a national issue with
broad political overtones for various educational
agendas.
Articles in The New York Times and The Wall
Street Journal, and especially comments by Secre
tary of Education William Bennett and presidential
candidate Jesse Jackson, have propelled this proc
ess.
Western Culture, though, has always been a
politicized topic on the Stanford campus. The move
ment for change in the structure of the course was
initiated by the Black Student Union and pursued
by a coalition of minority groups that charged that
the Western Culture curriculum is sexist and
Eurocentric, and that it thus alienates and mar
ginalizes significant segments of the freshman class
who find their heritages invalidated within the cen
terpiece of the undergraduate curriculum.
Minority groups have lobbied for curricular af
firmative action, that is, for increased representation
of minority writers and viewpoints in Western Cul
ture readings. This has had foreseeable results.
Some opponents of change warn that the inclusion
of what they perceive as substandard minority texts
will dilute the teaching of the Western intellectual
tradition, and certain minority students have coun
tered by leveling charges of racism against all op
ponents of change.
This politicization of what is ostensibly an aca
demic issue was inevitable and, to some extent,
valuable. The issue almost certainly would not have
arisen nor have proceeded to apparent resolution
(in the upcoming Faculty Senate vote) as rapidly
as it has without the impetus of minority protest.
The politicization of debate has been unfortunate,
though, because it has diverted attention from the
more basic pedagogical concerns which must
legitimately determine the future of the Western
Culture program.
Both reform proposals now before the Faculty
Senate recognize that increasing the emphasis on
the works, contributions and experiences of women
and minorities within the context of the Western
Culture program is important academically.
It is important not because women and minorities
will find their respective heritages validated or be-

cause past inequities will be remedied (although
these are collateral benefits), but rather because
the intellectual experience will be enhanced by a
balanced presentation of diverse perspectives and
a sensitivity to portraying the complexity of historical
realities.
It was Aristotle who lamented, millennia ago,
that anything worth saying about the human con
dition had already been said. As a corollary, it can
be said that ideas worth stating apply broadly across
the gulf of time, space and culture. Exposure to
viewpoints in primary readings that reflect the full
range of humanity illustrates the universality of
those Western ideas that remain forceful today.
Plato should still be read as an essential component
of the Western Culture track, not because of tra
dition but because his ideas continue to resonate.
It is, however, a pedagogical disservice to all
students, not just women and minorities, for a
course that seeks to convey the power of ideas to
imply by the structure of its syllabus that every or
any important idea within the Western intellectual
tradition was initiated, or singularly held, by a few
white men at particular historical and geographical
junctures.
Since the academic aspect of the push for reform
of the Western Culture track has until recently
been largely ignored in the politically oriented
debate at Stanford, it is perhaps not suprising that
Bennett has construed the reform efforts as being
"without intellectual or academic defense."
However, Bennett's stance is conveniently in con
cert with his own tradition-oriented political out
look, making his interest in Stanford's freshman
curriculum appear politically motivated as well. He
is improperly elevating Western Culture reform here
to a metaphor for what traditionalists perceive as
the demise of American education in general.
While Stanford students and faculty should be
proud that our university has become sufficiently
prestigious that internal academic matters are of
national interest and may influence curricular
debates at other universities, we should be wary of
the politicization of campus affairs that this may
entail.
Unfortunately, the future of the Western Culture
program is one debate in which pedagogical con
cerns have been overshadowed by political ones
from the beginning.
