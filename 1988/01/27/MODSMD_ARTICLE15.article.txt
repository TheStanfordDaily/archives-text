## Food Service is serving rudely 
### 
Picture yourself walking back
from Meyer Library on a cold, rainy
Sunday. Your stomach is screaming
for some sort of nourishment. You
check your watch; it is 5:58 p.m.
At the Wilbur dining hall, there is
a guy beginning to close and lock
the doors to the cafeteria. You
begin to run toward the door.
"I'm sorry, we're closed," says
the gatekeeper nonchalantly.
Inside, there are many students
waiting patiently in line.
"But we were just at the library
doing all of our assignments, and
we just got back. Don't you want
us to have some dinner?"
Inside, the meal card checker
screams, "No! don't let them in!"
"I am sorry; I can't let you in. I
have just let all these other people
in and we close at exactly 6 p.m."
With that last remark, he shuts
the doors and leaves you standing

in the cold with a growling, empty
stomach. Sounds like a fairy tale
with a bad ending? This incident
actually took place at Wilbur last
quarter.
Food Service is a service for the
students. Each quarter we pay a
hefty amount of money for the ser
vice. It became evident in the recent
fast how little of that money actually
goes toward buying the food. A
majority of it goes to the service.
And then there is the fact that
it was a holiday weekend. They
weren't serving many people, and
many other places weren't open.
What they did was especially in
considerate and malicious. The
time spent telling us why we weren't
allowed in was at least 10 times
longer than the time needed for us
to get inside. Thus, we do not be
lieve their main concern was to
close exactly on time but to dem
onstrate their menial powers. It irks
us to think we pay for this sort of
service.
We realize the workers were
technically correct. Food Service

closed at 6 p.m., and it so happened
our watches were slower than the
official time. We also realize that
letting us in probably would have
caused some minute inconvenience
that would have been easily distrib
uted over the entire staff. However,
when compared with the inconven
ience we have had to endure with
Food Service in the past 12 weeks,
it is nothing. It seems the Food
Service workers who have to deal
with fellow students all day long
should be just a tad more concerned
with other people's needs, espe
cially under extraordinary circum
stances.
Stanford has always been known
to us as a friendly and considerate
place not too caught up in the bu
reaucracy so often present in other
schools. These outstanding charac
teristics should not end with Food
Service.
