# Honesty is worth risks
## 
### 
The softness under your fingertips as you caress her
thigh, suffused with the glow, fading now as the sweat
begins to cool; the saline taste in your mouth as you
bawl uncontrollably at the unfairness, at the cruelty
of your tormentors; the riveting joy of the music in
your head, touching something in you that wants to
cry out that, yes, this is the way that the world can
be, that this is the way that the world should be —
such moments are the only truth that we can really
know.

We are creatures inextricably wedded and embedded
in the tides and turnings of our experience, and it is
only in the reaching out to share what we have known
that we can begin to approach the greatness that we
all sometimes feel is pent up somewhere within us.
The power and promise of facing your life with honesty,
openness and truth is precisely the knowledge that
happiness is nothing more than the facility with which
you are able to know, react and act from your heart.
I have known what it means to be unhappy, what
it means to despair with the dull-hearted inner blank
ness that comes when you start to believe that the
essence of this whole living business is nothing more
than suffering. It was a long time ago, and I was
young, a gangly fifth-grader stuck by a school system
faced with declining enrollment in a joint fifth/sixth
grade class. I was physically stretched by the normal
hormonal surges that begin around that age into an
ill-coordinated bean pole and emotionally contorted
into a cocked bear trap eager to be tripped.
To say that I had a little problem with my temper
is, perhaps, like saying the Challenger had a slight
malfunction. I could explode at the slightest provoca
tion, but having been raised to believe that fighting
is wrong and being too uncoordinated to accomplish
much even had that option been open to me, I would
generally just flail around wildly at my assailants. I
believe the technical term for it is "spazzing out."
In any case, such moments were invariably followed
by the rapid realization of the ineffable futility of what
I was doing and overwhelming tears of hopelessness.
I was, in short, quite a spectacle for my classmates,
some of whom took it upon themselves to induce
these behaviors as often as possible to provide endless
hours of entertainment for the masses.
I lived in fear and self-hatred. I could not understand
why I had to face such incessant cruelty, why my
classmates hated me so much. I have warm and caring
parents, and yet I could not approach them because
I knew it was wrong to lose my temper and to fight.
If I told them, they might hate me too. My grades
plummeted, and soon I was even a failure at the one
thing that had always made me better than the bullies.
Life was a deep cesspool, and I was drowning in it.

Many of us have been there, to that dusty, worm
eaten place where in unliving somnambulation the
dead-hearted endure their private suffering. There is
a quietness there that is nothing like the serenity of
silence. You can abide there for an hour or months
or, unfortunately for some, a lifetime and never hear
anything beyond your own inner railings against an
alien world seemingly devoid of any kind of nurturing
or nourishment.
Truth, however, cannot exist in despair, and the
overwhelming sense that there can be no escape from
that place is utlimately the biggest lie of all.
I remember quite distinctly the moment I began to
find my way out. I was seated in the stillness of a
bath, frantic with the inner turmoil of hopelessness,
when suddenly a simple realization hit me. My class
mates did not care about me. They were not overly
concerned with making my life miserable. The truth,
simple and crystalline, was that by behaving as I had,
I had been the progenitor of my own misfortune.
It was hard, learning not to rise to the provocation
of bullies, and it was perhaps harder to come to accept
the idea that I was not the center of everyone else's
universe, but in the end the episode left me with one
grand certainty: You cannot be happy unless you
acknowledge, accept and act upon the truth of who
you are. And that means it is imperative to speak
from your heart and in all matters to center yourself
by knowing that which is important to you and that
which is not.
It is a scary thing to open yourself and speak of
the things that have meaning for you. If you show
people who you really are, then you run the risk of
their rejecting the real you, of their not liking the
real you. It is, indeed, safer to deal with abstractions,
illusions and masks. It is also entirely unrewarding to
do so.
What matters in this world is touching people, phys
ically and intimately. It is a perverse delusion of our
society, indeed, that tangible heart-to-heart connection
is in any fashion limited to sex or sexual relationships.
The foundation of the certain joy of humanness is
this: that the truth of all we have known and everything
that we have been is worthy of full acceptance, that
in openness and inner nakedness there is a place for
us to meet and comfort one another and that through
the unity and challenge that is love we can know and
grant each other affirmation of the greatness which
is within each of us.
The only hope that exists is the hope we have to
offer each other. The only happiness we can purchase
is that which we earn with the sincerity, smiles and
hugs by which we affirm each other's worth. The only
truth we can possess are the bits we have gleaned
from personal experience, accepted into our hearts
and validated by sharing openly with others.
In a world where people do suffer, where people
do hurt each other and where there are stupidities
and problems of every kind, the center of human
interaction must be honesty. For if we fail to speak
and act from the heart, then, ultimately, we have
failed ourselves; and there is indeed no hope for any
real growth of change in our lives or in our society.

silence. You can abide there for an hour or months
or, unfortunately for some, a lifetime and never hear
anything beyond your own inner railings against an
alien world seemingly devoid of any kind of nurturing
or nourishment.
Truth, however, cannot exist in despair, and the
overwhelming sense that there can be no escape from
that place is utlimately the biggest lie of all.
I remember quite distinctly the moment I began to
find my way out. I was seated in the stillness of a
bath, frantic with the inner turmoil of hopelessness,
when suddenly a simple realization hit me. My class
mates did not care about me. They were not overly
concerned with making my life miserable. The truth,
simple and crystalline, was that by behaving as I had,
I had been the progenitor of my own misfortune.
It was hard, learning not to rise to the provocation
of bullies, and it was perhaps harder to come to accept
the idea that I was not the center of everyone else's
universe, but in the end the episode left me with one
grand certainty: You cannot be happy unless you
acknowledge, accept and act upon the truth of who
you are. And that means it is imperative to speak
from your heart and in all matters to center yourself
by knowing that which is important to you and that
which is not.
It is a scary thing to open yourself and speak of
the things that have meaning for you. If you show
people who you really are, then you run the risk of
their rejecting the real you, of their not liking the
real you. It is, indeed, safer to deal with abstractions,
illusions and masks. It is also entirely unrewarding to
do so.
What matters in this world is touching people, phys
ically and intimately. It is a perverse delusion of our
society, indeed, that tangible heart-to-heart connection
is in any fashion limited to sex or sexual relationships.
The foundation of the certain joy of humanness is
this: that the truth of all we have known and everything
that we have been is worthy of full acceptance, that
in openness and inner nakedness there is a place for
us to meet and comfort one another and that through
the unity and challenge that is love we can know and
grant each other affirmation of the greatness which
is within each of us.
The only hope that exists is the hope we have to
offer each other. The only happiness we can purchase
is that which we earn with the sincerity, smiles and
hugs by which we affirm each other's worth. The only
truth we can possess are the bits we have gleaned
from personal experience, accepted into our hearts
and validated by sharing openly with others.
In a world where people do suffer, where people
do hurt each other and where there are stupidities
and problems of every kind, the center of human
interaction must be honesty. For if we fail to speak
and act from the heart, then, ultimately, we have
failed ourselves; and there is indeed no hope for any
real growth of change in our lives or in our society.

The softness under your fingertips as you caress her
thigh, suffused with the glow, fading now as the sweat
begins to cool; the saline taste in your mouth as you
bawl uncontrollably at the unfairness, at the cruelty
of your tormentors; the riveting joy of the music in
your head, touching something in you that wants to
cry out that, yes, this is the way that the world can
be, that this is the way that the world should be —
such moments are the only truth that we can really
know.

We are creatures inextricably wedded and embedded
in the tides and turnings of our experience, and it is
only in the reaching out to share what we have known
that we can begin to approach the greatness that we
all sometimes feel is pent up somewhere within us.
The power and promise of facing your life with honesty,
openness and truth is precisely the knowledge that
happiness is nothing more than the facility with which
you are able to know, react and act from your heart.
I have known what it means to be unhappy, what
it means to despair with the dull-hearted inner blank
ness that comes when you start to believe that the
essence of this whole living business is nothing more
than suffering. It was a long time ago, and I was
young, a gangly fifth-grader stuck by a school system
faced with declining enrollment in a joint fifth/sixth
grade class. I was physically stretched by the normal
hormonal surges that begin around that age into an
ill-coordinated bean pole and emotionally contorted
into a cocked bear trap eager to be tripped.
To say that I had a little problem with my temper
is, perhaps, like saying the Challenger had a slight
malfunction. I could explode at the slightest provoca
tion, but having been raised to believe that fighting
is wrong and being too uncoordinated to accomplish
much even had that option been open to me, I would
generally just flail around wildly at my assailants. I
believe the technical term for it is "spazzing out."
In any case, such moments were invariably followed
by the rapid realization of the ineffable futility of what
I was doing and overwhelming tears of hopelessness.
I was, in short, quite a spectacle for my classmates,
some of whom took it upon themselves to induce
these behaviors as often as possible to provide endless
hours of entertainment for the masses.
I lived in fear and self-hatred. I could not understand
why I had to face such incessant cruelty, why my
classmates hated me so much. I have warm and caring
parents, and yet I could not approach them because
I knew it was wrong to lose my temper and to fight.
If I told them, they might hate me too. My grades
plummeted, and soon I was even a failure at the one
thing that had always made me better than the bullies.
Life was a deep cesspool, and I was drowning in it.

Many of us have been there, to that dusty, worm
eaten place where in unliving somnambulation the
dead-hearted endure their private suffering. There is
a quietness there that is nothing like the serenity of
silence. You can abide there for an hour or months
or, unfortunately for some, a lifetime and never hear
anything beyond your own inner railings against an
alien world seemingly devoid of any kind of nurturing
or nourishment.
