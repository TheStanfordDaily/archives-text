## European culture deserves focus 
### 
The Western Culture program is apparently
Stanford's idea of an adequate grounding in the
humanities for those students who may never
take another humanities course at Stanford. Its
primary aim, therefore, should be to provide
these students with as much of an overall un
derstanding as possible of what it means to be
a human being.

Such an understanding requires three areas
of study: The origins of human culture, the
varieties of human culture and the greatest
achievements of human culture. The present
stated aim of the Western Culture program is
to provide students with a minimum of "cultural
literacy." This is a fine goal, but it is essentially
the same as the goals of the old-fashioned girls'
finishing school. An overall understanding of
what it means to be a human being seems to
me a more suitable goal for a modern university
student.
Such an understanding certainly is best
achieved by spending the great majority of one's
time on the greatest achievements of human
culture, and the greatest achievements of human
culture are without a doubt the intellectual
achievements of Western European culture.
Moreover, providing cultural literacy is an
essential duty of a university, so the study of
Western culture should indeed occupy the great

majority of the curriculum of the basic
humanities track. But it is impossible to under
stand any one culture without understanding
human culture in general.
In my own field I have often heard professors
waxing poetic about some "characteristically
Greek" attribute of ancient Greek culture with
out having any idea whether this attribute is
found in other cultures or not. I think it is
outrageous that a Stanford student, particularly
a humanities major, may graduate from here
without ever having studied a non-Western cul
ture.
A study of the literature and art of each age
is clearly essential to tasting directly the spirit
of that people, but it must be based on the
foundation of history and religion/philosophy.
The majority of Western Culture tracks at Stan
ford have such a basis, but there is one that
appears to study primarily or exclusively litera
ture and the arts. My own area of specialization
in classics is literary criticism, so I am not just
riding my own hobbyhorse when I say this West
ern Culture track should be discontinued. A
student should, in my opinion, have a choice
between a track that is almost all history and
philosophy, and one that is almost almost all
history and philosophy.
There is currently one Western Culture track
that apparently does not require students to
study ancient Greece and Rome. Here I am
obviously riding my own hobbyhorse a little; but
since the study of the origins of human culture

will take the student up through the origin of
civilization in Mesopotamia and Egypt anyway,
and since knowledge of the classical world is
essential for cultural literacy — one hears in
the real world much more often of Plato and
Aristotle and the Roman Empire than of Vol
taire and Rousseau — it is again outrageous
that study of ancient Greece and Rome is not
required.
The role and achievements of women and
minorities clearly constitute an important part
of the history of Western culture and should
be frequently mentioned in lectures on the his
tory of this culture. But when it comes to al
locating precious time to reading the greatest
literary products of European culture, it is too
much to ask that authors such as Dostoyevsky
be ignored while James Baldwin and Jane Aus
ten are put on the syllabus.
Again, I cannot expect everyone to share my
personal tastes, but I know that many teachers
of the Western Culture track, if asked to name
their own short list of greatest authors, would
produce a list lacking a woman and/or a minority
author. They should be free to do so.
In closing, let me say that whatever is con
troversial or offensive in any of this, one thing
should not be: Providing cultural literacy really
is like being a finishing school. The basic
humanities track of a major university should
provide such literacy, but the primary aim should
be a basic grounding in the study of the human
being.
