## Student is modern-day fairy godmother Seamstress' designs are a hit

Diane Boxill is a modern-day fairy god
mother for Stanford women in need of
gowns or dresses for formal occasions.
Boxill, a Stanford junior who is creating
her own major in arts and design for
industrial engineering, has turned her
childhood sewing hobby into a real talent
for designing clothes.
Most recently, Viennese Ball goers
probably spotted several of Boxill's eve
ning creations waltzing to the strains of
the Blue Danube on Saturday night.
Boxill said she became interested in
design as an eighth-grader after ex
perimenting with patterns one afternoon
with a friend and her friend's mother. A
"really awful polyester" was the material
she had to work with, Boxill said.
Now specializing in materials like silk,
velvet, satin, tafetta and challis for evening
wear, Boxill's interest and talent in de
signing clothes has really grown.
"Evening wear is the most interesting
(type of design) to me," Boxill said. "It
allows me to use dramatic ideas that
would not apply to some other clothing
styles."
Boxill has designed clothes for herself,
prom dresses for her sister and wedding
dresses for friends. Now a major channel
of energy and time, her hobby may be
come a career goal.
Without formal training in tailoring and
design, years of practice have nonetheless
enabled Boxill to teach herself how to
make patterns and design the dresses that
she pictures in her head.
At the beginning of last quarter, Boxill
began to create designs for her friends
at Stanford and has already finished
several dresses for both the Viennese Ball
and Club Ujamaa.
With the financial backing of a female
lawyer she knows from the community,
Boxill purchased a sewing machine and
material for her models' dresses.
While Boxill said she "doesn't consider
her enterprise a business" because she is
still in school, she continues to sew and
take classes.
At present, Boxill said she plans to
turn her talents into a career in clothes
design. "I don't want to work for anyone
if I can help it," Boxill said. "This is a
skill that I have that I can use and make
profitable."

Boxill said she plans to work this sum
mer with garment buyers in boutiques in
Los Angeles and New York. After she
graduates, she Hopes to travel to Paris
and Senegal, where she plans to study
traditional techniques for making fabrics,
dyeing and designing.
Putting together an evening gown takes
a considerable amount of time, according
to Boxill.
A trip to a fabric store with the person
who requests the dress is usually the first
step in a long process. When an appro
priate style and material have been chosen
and three to four fittings are done, the
process of putting the dress together
begins, Boxill said.
Typically, a dress takes three to four
weeks to complete, but Boxill claims to
have finished gowns in as little as eight
hours.
"I can look at someone and tell what
colors and styles would look good on
them," Boxill said. "I think all clothes are
constructed from some basic styles â€” it
all depends on how you put them together.

What I'm doing is putting the basics to
gether in ways that are flattering to people
of all different shapes and sizes."
"I recommend simple and elegant
styles. I notice that people tend to wear
what's in vogue, but they need to be
realistic and wear what looks good on
them, not on models."
Some of Boxill's designs include a gown
with a black velvet fitted bodice, a black
beaded velvet skirt and a huge black velvet
bow.
Currently, Boxill is putting on fashion
shows with her models at the dormitories
in conjunction with Seine's, a tuxedo rental
boutique on University Avenue.
Most students who have asked Boxill
to design for them have been satisfied
with the clothes she has made.
Junior Anita Kremin bought a tea
length green tafetta and black velvet dress
for a Theta Delta Chi fraternity formal.
"I went to Diane because I didn't see
what I wanted in the stores," Kremin
said.
