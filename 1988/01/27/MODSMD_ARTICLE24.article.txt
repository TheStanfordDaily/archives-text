# Brain Teaser tackles a game called 'Ghost'
## 
### Paul Defigueiredo Staff writer 
When travelling long distances in a car
full of stir-crazy people, I like to play
word games. One of my favorite word
games, which Gyles Brandreth describes
in his book "The Joy of Lex" is GHOST.
With two players, the game proceeds
as follows: The first player calls out a
letter. The second player then adds a
letter either in front or in back of the
first letter.

In doing this, the second player must
have a word in mind that contains the
two-letter string.
The first player proceeds as the second,
adding another letter either in front or in
back of the two-letter string. Similarly, he
must have a word in mind that contains
the newly formed three-letter string.
However, the word he has in mind may
be different from his opponent's word.
The round continues in this manner,
with each player adding letters in succes
sion. The first player who adds a letter
to the string that completes a word loses
the round. Two- and three-letter words
do not count.
The first player to lose a round acquires
a "G." After losing two rounds he acquires
an "H," and so on until one player ac
cumulates the letters that spell the word
"GHOST" and thereby loses the game.
These rules can easily apply to any num
ber of players. Consider the following
sample game:
Fred: O (He is thinking of the word
"DEOXYHEMOGLOBIN.")
Frank: ON (He is thinking of the word
"BONEHEAD.")
Fred: ONE ("ONE" is a word, but be
cause three-letter words do not count,
Fred hasn't lost the game yet. He is think
ing of the word "DIMETHYLKETONE.")
Frank: ONEH (He is still thinking of

the word "BONEHEAD.")
Fred: Fred is stumped. (Fred cannot
think of a word that contains the string
"ONEH," so he challenges Frank to reveal
the word he was thinking of.)
Frank answers that he was thinking of
the word "BONEHEAD," which means
having a head that is nothing but one big
bone.
Frank wins the game. Frank also calls
Fred a bonchead, though this is not part
of the game.
So you want to play GHOST on your
next cross-country drive?
Knowing the rules is only the first step.
Below are a couple of pointers that will
guarantee victory on your next trip:
• Travel with 5-year-olds who have a
smaller English vocabulary than your own.
That way you can get away with words
like "electrolysis" and "liposuction."
• If you have lost a game of GHOST,
tell your opponent that the game is really
called GHOSTBUSTER. If you are about
to lose a game of GHOSTBUSTER, it is
best to feign car sickness by gagging your
self and vomiting on your opponent.
PUZZLES
Test your GHOST skills by forming
words that have an even number of letters
from the word fragments listed below:
1. ghtho 6. naffil
2. kiin 7. hetst
3. icic 8. ajol
4. bscqu 9. ymna
5. eallo 10. achrymo
SOLUTIONS
Here are the author's solutions. They
arc not intended to be unique. For some
questions, I am sure there arc many pos
sible correct solutions.
