Pop Will Eat Itself — "Box Frenzy"
A funny thing happened in the
English Midlands in 1987.
The Midlands have long endured
snide remarks about an affinity for
early '70s hard rock/heavy metal
and the consequent implications of
vulgarity, machoism and stupidity.
In late 1986 and early 1987, the
Midlands revolted and spewed forth
a number of bands that decided to
fully embrace these warped values
assigned to them.
The Bomb Party, Crazy Head,
Pop Will Eat Itself and the Gaye
Bykers on Acid drank, partied and
vomited their way into music
magazines and up the independent
charts, leaving behind vile odors
and bodily fluids wherever possible.
In a nation happily devoted to
the sterile celibacy of Morrissey and
the serene androgeny of New Or
der/The Cure, these bands extolled
over sexism, stupidity and filth, and
raucously declared "Grebo" the
next big thing.
"Horrors!! ' thinks the liberal
minded reader. "Sexism?! in 1988!"
Grebo is not for those who arc
deeply liberal or feminist at heart.

You won't like the lyrics and you
probably wouldn't like the music
anyway.
"Box Frenzy" (no, "box" is not
a six-sided container here, boys and
girls) is the Poppies' latest effort
and musically marks a significant
departure from their earlier re
leases. Their sexist, acidic rum
blings have taken a hippety-hop
turn; the result is something like
dirty-acid-biker meets English
white-boy rap.
And strange though it may seem,
the entire album is highly listenable
and danceable. Songs like "Beaver
Patrol" and "Let's Get Ugly" will
offend your moral sensibilities but
will seduce your musical sen
sitivities. Ain't life a bitch?
— Cindy Ecstacy
Gaye Bykers on Acid — "Drill Your
Own Hole"
"Drill Your Own Hole" is the
first full album from the Gaye
Bykers and follows their successful
"Nosedive Karma." I don't want to
ponder the significance of these
titles, but indeed the Bykers seemed
to have drilled one deep hole this

time around.
The Bykers, like the Poppies,
have moved away from the early
Grebo 'proper' sound of blinding
no-frills guitar, and have developed
a sort of psychotic-hippy "drenched
in LSD" sound.
Many of the songs wander off
into wonderland as the band mem
bers indulge in hallucinated fanta
sies. Most of it sounds pretty dang
groovy anyway; it just takes a little
getting used to. Lead singer Mary
Mary's lyrics lean more toward out
right dementia and paranoia
("Drive-In Salvation" is an espe
cially fascinating, maniacal
tantrum) than the rest of the Grebo
bunch, but the characteristic sexist
and sex-obsessed Grebo ravings are
evident in "Git Down (Shake your
thang)" and "After Suck There's
Blow."
— Cindy Ecstacy
Single Gun Theory — "Exorcise
This Wasteland" (1987)
Currently, there are a wide vari
ety of synth-groups emitting easily
digestible, somewhat ambiguous
and thoroughly inoffensive aural

candy. The production is consis
tently top-of-the-line and the result
is inevitably danceable. Single Gun
Theory almost fits in this category,
yet somehow outdoes the likes of
the Pet Shop Boys and, yes, even
the beloved Tiffany.
Incorporating production work by
"underground" notables Tom El
lard of Severed Heads and Anthony
Valcic of MOEV, this debut effort
is quite satisfying technically. Ad
dressing relevant sociopolitical Is
sues simultaneously from intraper
sonal, interpersonal and societal
contexts, "Exorcise This Was
teland" is conceptually challenging
as well.
In"I Close My Eyes," the vocalist
laments the limited scope of con
cerns that our society demonstrates
for the misfortunes of others, as we
pay attention to issues only as long
as they are "media events" and we
use apocalyptic disasters as mere
conversation pieces. In direct con
trast to the thematic content, the
delivery is rather pleasant as a
sweet, intimate, siren-like voice
floats gracefully among ambiant, yet
quirky, dance tracks.

anyway.
"Box Frenzy" (no, "box" is not
a six-sided container here, boys and
girls) is the Poppies' latest effort
and musically marks a significant
departure from their earlier re
leases. Their sexist, acidic rum
blings have taken a hippety-hop
turn; the result is something like
dirty-acid-biker meets English
white-boy rap.
And strange though it may seem,
the entire album is highly listenable
and danceable. Songs like "Beaver
Patrol" and "Let's Get Ugly" will
offend your moral sensibilities but
will seduce your musical sen
sitivities. Ain't life a bitch?

Gaye Bykers on Acid — "Drill Your
Own Hole"
"Drill Your Own Hole" is the
first full album from the Gaye
Bykers and follows their successful
"Nosedive Karma." I don't want to
ponder the significance of these
titles, but indeed the Bykers seemed
to have drilled one deep hole this

time around.
The Bykers, like the Poppies,
have moved away from the early
Grebo 'proper' sound of blinding
no-frills guitar, and have developed
a sort of psychotic-hippy "drenched
in LSD" sound.
Many of the songs wander off
into wonderland as the band mem
bers indulge in hallucinated fanta
sies. Most of it sounds pretty dang
groovy anyway; it just takes a little
getting used to. Lead singer Mary
Mary's lyrics lean more toward out
right dementia and paranoia
("Drive-In Salvation" is an espe
cially fascinating, maniacal
tantrum) than the rest of the Grebo
bunch, but the characteristic sexist
and sex-obsessed Grebo ravings are
evident in "Git Down (Shake your
thang)" and "After Suck There's
Blow."

Single Gun Theory — "Exorcise
This Wasteland" (1987)
Currently, there are a wide vari
ety of synth-groups emitting easily
digestible, somewhat ambiguous
and thoroughly inoffensive aural

candy. The production is consis
tently top-of-the-line and the result
is inevitably danceable. Single Gun
Theory almost fits in this category,
yet somehow outdoes the likes of
the Pet Shop Boys and, yes, even
the beloved Tiffany.
Incorporating production work by
"underground" notables Tom El
lard of Severed Heads and Anthony
Valcic of MOEV, this debut effort
is quite satisfying technically. Ad
dressing relevant sociopolitical Is
sues simultaneously from intraper
sonal, interpersonal and societal
contexts, "Exorcise This Was
teland" is conceptually challenging
as well.
In"I Close My Eyes," the vocalist
laments the limited scope of con
cerns that our society demonstrates
for the misfortunes of others, as we
pay attention to issues only as long
as they are "media events" and we
use apocalyptic disasters as mere
conversation pieces. In direct con
trast to the thematic content, the
delivery is rather pleasant as a
sweet, intimate, siren-like voice
floats gracefully among ambiant, yet
quirky, dance tracks.
