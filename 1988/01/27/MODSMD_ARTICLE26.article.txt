# CDs and LPs fight it out over sound quality
## The 						myth of superiority 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
The LP is dead, long live the CD.
This battle cry is echoed over
and over on the pages of
newspapers like The San Francisco
Chronicle and magazines like
Stereo Review. The topic was even
used recently to fill space on the
evening news. It is echoed so often
that much of the public now takes
it as the gospel truth.
The belief on the street is that
the days of the vinyl long-playing
record arc numbered, and, before
you know it, there will be nothing
but shiny, metallic compact discs in
record stores.
In addition, these "CD believers"
think their beloved jewel boxes con
tain the ideal medium for reproduc
ing recorded sound far superior to
anything available before.

But, there is another school of
thought, albeit a smaller one. This
school contends that CD technology
is fundamentally flawed, CD sound
is anything but perfect and that
their beloved LPs are not likely to
disappear anytime soon.
The question is: How can these
LP diehards cling to their beliefs
in the face of the tremendous en
thusiasm the CD has generated?
The answer is (excuse the clichd)
both simple and complex.
The simple answer is that some
people think the LP sounds better
than the CD. The CD crowd says
that's nonsense. The two sides arc
at an impasse until the LP
aficionados make a concession:
Over 90 percent of the people who
purchase CD players to replace
their old turntables are buying an

improvement in sound quality,
but....
The CD crowd interrupts, shouts
"we've won" and heads for home.
Then the LP fans continue where
they left off.
The reason why most people get
better sound when they buy CD
players is because they are replacing
direct drive turntables (Direct drive
means that the motor that spins
the platter is placed directly under
the spindle that holds the record
in place).
This particular faction of LP fans,
a faction to which I belong, holds
that direct drive turntables, no mat
ter how much they may cost, are
terrible at reproducing sound and
should not be manufactured at all.
This group continues by saying
that the belt drive turntable (o;ie
in which the motor transfers rota

tional energy to the spindle by
means of a small belt) is the only
kind of turntable worth buying.
Even that presents a problem.
Companies like Technics and Sony
often charge less for their belt drive
turntables than they do for their
direct drive machines. If the belt
drives are superior, why do they
often cost less?
The response, for lack of a better
one, is that no turntable made by
Technics or Sony (or any other mass
market manufacturer) sounds good
enough to justify its pricetag.
Turntables in the $200-$3OO
range made by companies like
Thorens and Bang & Olufsen,
however, will outplay most CD
players. And upgrading to one of
these turntables instead of buying
a CD player provides the added
benefit of allowing you to keep your
record collection.
Moving to CDs means taking that
collection — one in which you've
invariably invested time, money and
emotion — and throwing it in the
trash can. Hardly seems logical.

For those contemplating the pur
chase of a CD player, I offer the
following advice: Go to a store that
sells some high-end equipment
(brands like Nakamichi, Boston
Acoustics and Denon) but has no
high-pressure salesmen. If they start
talking features and specifications,
you're in the wrong store. Don't
forget to bring along an album you
like on both CD and LP if possible.
Ask the salesman to set it up so
that you can switch between the
LP and the CD. Start them both
at the same time so that they are
playing virtually the same passage
of music. Switch between the two
machines (and have someone else
switch as well so you don't know
which one is playing at any given
time) and listen to the music.
You should not listen for which
one sounds "better" — because
every study on the subject has
shown if people listen for "better"
the one they prefer is the one that
is louder. You have to free your
mind of the preconceived notion of
better.

Instead, listen for more subtle
things. The fans of the LP find that
CDs sound worse than records be
cause they tend to compress the
sound stage, fail to accurately keep
the tempo and lack musical infor
mation that is found on records.
Sound stage compression: The ef
fect this creates is that the
performers all seem like they arc
coming from one place when they
aren't. On Barbra Streisand's
"Broadway Album," for example,
you can clearly tell she is standing
in front of the band when listening
to the record. On the CD she
sounds like she is standing in the
middle of the band.
It is comparatively harder to hear
the clarity of the vocals when the
instruments begin to dominate.
Missing musical information: To
oversimplify a bit, since the CD
records sound digitally they don't
record the complete wavelength like
LPs, which are analog, do. Instead,
a process called sampling is used
to piece together the musical signal.
In Dire Straits' "So Far Away,"

on the "Brothers in Arms" album,
the intro to the song contains subtle
vocal and instrumental sounds that
are simply not audible on the CD.
Listen carefully, you'll hear what
you're missing.
Inability to keep tempo: The sam
pling process is flawed further be
cause it cannot keep tempo ac
curately. If you swing your arm back
and forth to simulate a metronome
you will find that the CD will often
not be able to keep the beat very
early into a song.
Paul Simon's "Graceland" title
track even starts on the wrong beat
on the CD, and it gets worse
throughout the song. Inaccurate
tempo increases listener fatigue and
subconsciously reduces the pleasure
you derive from your music.
The remaining sticking point is:
If CDs have flaws, why are com
panies touting them and the digital
sound they contain as the second
coming. The answer involves big
business and industry conspiracy
and will be handled next week.
The LP is dead, long live the CD.

school contends that CD technology
is fundamentally flawed, CD sound
is anything but perfect and that
their beloved LPs are not likely to
disappear anytime soon.
The question is: How can these
LP diehards cling to their beliefs
in the face of the tremendous en
thusiasm the CD has generated?
The answer is (excuse the clichd)
both simple and complex.
The simple answer is that some
people think the LP sounds better
than the CD. The CD crowd says
that's nonsense. The two sides arc
at an impasse until the LP
aficionados make a concession:
Over 90 percent of the people who
purchase CD players to replace
their old turntables are buying an

improvement in sound quality,
but....
The CD crowd interrupts, shouts
"we've won" and heads for home.
Then the LP fans continue where
they left off.
The reason why most people get
better sound when they buy CD
players is because they are replacing
direct drive turntables (Direct drive
means that the motor that spins
the platter is placed directly under
the spindle that holds the record
in place).
This particular faction of LP fans,
a faction to which I belong, holds
that direct drive turntables, no mat
ter how much they may cost, are
terrible at reproducing sound and
should not be manufactured at all.
This group continues by saying
that the belt drive turntable (o;ie
in which the motor transfers rota

tional energy to the spindle by
means of a small belt) is the only
kind of turntable worth buying.
Even that presents a problem.
Companies like Technics and Sony
often charge less for their belt drive
turntables than they do for their
direct drive machines. If the belt
drives are superior, why do they
often cost less?
The response, for lack of a better
one, is that no turntable made by
Technics or Sony (or any other mass
market manufacturer) sounds good
enough to justify its pricetag.
Turntables in the $200-$3OO
range made by companies like
Thorens and Bang & Olufsen,
however, will outplay most CD
players. And upgrading to one of
these turntables instead of buying
a CD player provides the added
benefit of allowing you to keep your
record collection.
Moving to CDs means taking that
collection — one in which you've
invariably invested time, money and
emotion — and throwing it in the
trash can. Hardly seems logical.

For those contemplating the pur
chase of a CD player, I offer the
following advice: Go to a store that
sells some high-end equipment
(brands like Nakamichi, Boston
Acoustics and Denon) but has no
high-pressure salesmen. If they start
talking features and specifications,
you're in the wrong store. Don't
forget to bring along an album you
like on both CD and LP if possible.
Ask the salesman to set it up so
that you can switch between the
LP and the CD. Start them both
at the same time so that they are
playing virtually the same passage
of music. Switch between the two
machines (and have someone else
switch as well so you don't know
which one is playing at any given
time) and listen to the music.
You should not listen for which
one sounds "better" — because
every study on the subject has
shown if people listen for "better"
the one they prefer is the one that
is louder. You have to free your
mind of the preconceived notion of
better.

Instead, listen for more subtle
things. The fans of the LP find that
CDs sound worse than records be
cause they tend to compress the
sound stage, fail to accurately keep
the tempo and lack musical infor
mation that is found on records.
Sound stage compression: The ef
fect this creates is that the
performers all seem like they arc
coming from one place when they
aren't. On Barbra Streisand's
"Broadway Album," for example,
you can clearly tell she is standing
in front of the band when listening
to the record. On the CD she
sounds like she is standing in the
middle of the band.
It is comparatively harder to hear
the clarity of the vocals when the
instruments begin to dominate.
Missing musical information: To
oversimplify a bit, since the CD
records sound digitally they don't
record the complete wavelength like
LPs, which are analog, do. Instead,
a process called sampling is used
to piece together the musical signal.
In Dire Straits' "So Far Away,"

on the "Brothers in Arms" album,
the intro to the song contains subtle
vocal and instrumental sounds that
are simply not audible on the CD.
Listen carefully, you'll hear what
you're missing.
Inability to keep tempo: The sam
pling process is flawed further be
cause it cannot keep tempo ac
curately. If you swing your arm back
and forth to simulate a metronome
you will find that the CD will often
not be able to keep the beat very
early into a song.
Paul Simon's "Graceland" title
track even starts on the wrong beat
on the CD, and it gets worse
throughout the song. Inaccurate
tempo increases listener fatigue and
subconsciously reduces the pleasure
you derive from your music.
The remaining sticking point is:
If CDs have flaws, why are com
panies touting them and the digital
sound they contain as the second
coming. The answer involves big
business and industry conspiracy
and will be handled next week.
The LP is dead, long live the CD.
This battle cry is echoed over
and over on the pages of
newspapers like The San Francisco
Chronicle and magazines like
Stereo Review. The topic was even
used recently to fill space on the
evening news. It is echoed so often
that much of the public now takes
it as the gospel truth.
The belief on the street is that
the days of the vinyl long-playing
record arc numbered, and, before
you know it, there will be nothing
but shiny, metallic compact discs in
record stores.
In addition, these "CD believers"
think their beloved jewel boxes con
tain the ideal medium for reproduc
ing recorded sound far superior to
anything available before.

But, there is another school of
thought, albeit a smaller one. This
school contends that CD technology
is fundamentally flawed, CD sound
is anything but perfect and that
their beloved LPs are not likely to
disappear anytime soon.
