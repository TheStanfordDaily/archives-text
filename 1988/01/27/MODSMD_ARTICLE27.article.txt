Though digital sound is far from
perfect, the compact digital disc
player provides the best long-lasting
sound reproduction currently avail
able in the United States.
The key word here is long-tasting.
Long Playing albums (and cassette
tapes, for that matter) do sound
very clear when you first play them,
and it is arguably true that a given
LP sounds clearer than the CD of
that recording.
However, even the finest turn
table cannot stop the process of
erosion. Because the record player's
needle makes direct contact with
the LP's grooves to "read" the audio
info stored on the vinyl disc, the
album begins to wear after the first
playing, which decreases the
dynamic quality of the album.

CDs, on the other hand, do not
suffer this fate because the CD
player reads with a laser that never
contacts the disc in a frictionary
manner. Thus, unlike the be
leaguered LP, a compact disc will
sound the same five years from now
as it did on the day it was pur
chased.
This is certainly good news for
the audiophile, since he will be able
to enjoy a favorite recording with
good sound for as long as he wants
without needing to buy a new al
bum. Ignoring the fact that CD
prices are scheduled to drop, this
could mean a decent savings to even
a non-eccentric music lover.
As for the notion that an owner
of a CD player need throw away
his collection of LPs because he
upgraded his sound system, this is
complete rubbish. I recently pur
chased a CD player to complement
my cassette deck. However, I feel
nt> urge to toss aside my 185 cassette
tapes due to this acquisition.
For the most part, my tapes do
adequate service, decently
reproducing the recordings stored
on them in spite of the wear they've
endured. Though I have purchased
CD copies of some of my more
cherished lecords to enhance my
enjoyment, replacing every tape is
not only overly extravagant but not
even actually required
Clearly, no medium offers perfect
sound reproduction shy of an un
amplified live performance in an
acoustically excellent stage, but for
those of us not wealthy enough to
retain an artist at our personal dis
posal, the CD is currently the best
option available.
