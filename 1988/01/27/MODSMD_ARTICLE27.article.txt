Though digital sound is far from
perfect, the compact digital disc
player provides the best long-lasting
sound reproduction currently avail

The key word here is long-tasting.
Long Playing albums (and cassette
tapes, for that matter) do sound
very clear when you first play them,
and it is arguably true that a given
LP sounds clearer than the CD of
that recording.
However, even the finest turn
table cannot stop the process of
erosion. Because the record player's
needle makes direct contact with
the LP's grooves to "read" the audio
info stored on the vinyl disc, the
album begins to wear after the first
playing, which decreases the
dynamic quality of the album.

CDs, on the other hand, do not
suffer this fate because the CD
player reads with a laser that never
contacts the disc in a frictionary
manner. Thus, unlike the be
leaguered LP, a compact disc will
sound the same five years from now
as it did on the day it was pur
chased.
This is certainly good news for
the audiophile, since he will be able
to enjoy a favorite recording with
good sound for as long as he wants
without needing to buy a new al
bum. Ignoring the fact that CD
prices are scheduled to drop, this
could mean a decent savings to even
a non-eccentric music lover.
