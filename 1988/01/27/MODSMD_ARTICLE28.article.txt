## Stanford pitching struts the right stuff 
### Chris Myers Editorial staff 
The Stanford baseball team's pitching
staff is a right-wing institution.
In fact, there isn't a lefty in the group.
But that's nothing particularly new; the
Cardinal staff has long had a definite
starboard list. It's just more noticeable
than ever now that Al Osuna, the lone
left-hander from last year's staff, is gone.
Right-handedness isn't the only thing
that Stanford's pitchers have in common,
though. They also share a degree of in
experience that may be an important fac
tor in how well they perform this season
for the Cardinal, which begins defense of
its NCAA championship this weekend.
"I think staff-wise, we're as good as
we've been," senior pitcher Lee Plemel
said. "But we're going to have a lot of
guys who just haven't thrown very many
innings at Stanford."
In fact, the three men who arc gone
from the pitching staff this year — Osuna
and Rob Wassenaar, both of whom
graduated, and Jack McDowell, who
passed up his final year of eligibility and
was nabbed by the Chicago White Sox in
the first round of the major league draft
— accounted for 29 of the team's 53 wins
last year.
"We have to make up for those guys,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"That's tough to do, when you have to
make up for a first-round draft pick .. .
realistically, you don't do that."
But realistically, things could be a lot
worse. Plemel, who won nine games last
year and seven the year before, is back
to assume the No. 1 starter role.
Also back is bullpen ace Steve Chitren,
who recorded eight wins and 13 saves in
31 appearances last season and was named
First-Team All-Pacific 10.
Those two will be the aces in the hole
for Marquess. Control will be the key for
Plemel as he steps out of McDowell's
long shadow and moves into a stopper
role on the staff. Plemel "has four pitches
(fastball, curve, slider and split-fingered
fastball) that he can throw for strikes at
any time," senior catcher Doug Robbins
said. But, as Marquess said, "he's got to
be able to throw the ball over the plate;
if he pitches behind (in the count) he
usually gets in trouble."
When Plemel is spotting his fastball

well and throwing his breaking stuff for
strikes, however, "he can give you an
awful lot to worry about as a hitter,"
pitching coach Tom Dunton said.
Chitren can also give hitters a lot to
worry about. He throws a fastball with a
lot of movement on it and a wicked slider,
and this year he is throwing an off-speed
curve more frequently. He'll be particu
larly effective in relief of finesse pitchcrs
like Plcmel, when his hard stuff will seem
even harder.
"He handles pressure real well,"
Marquess said of Chitren. "He seems to
pitch better in tough situations. It's funny
— I'd rather have Chit pitch with a guy
on third than nobody on."
The staff also boasts a couple of im
pressive freshmen, Mike Mussina and
Stan Spencer. Mussina, from Mon
toursville, Pa., would have been a first
round major-league draft pick last June
if he hadn't decided to come to Stanford.
"Mike is one of the top pitching prospects
we've ever had here," Marquess said. "I
would compare him to Jack McDowell at
this point in his career."
Mussina has turned in some impressive
performances, pitching six no-hit innings
against Holland in the Taipei Interna
tional Tournament in Taiwan in Decem
ber.
Mussina throws a 90-mph fastball and
a knuckle-curve, which, Dunton said, "just
dives."
Spencer, from Vancouver, Wash., has
been"the most pleasant surprise" on the
staff, Marquess said. "We knew Stan was
going to be a good pitcher, but he just
took 0ff.... He increased his fastball by
about four or five miles per hour (over
the summer), has a good curvcball and
tremendous control. ... He just throws
strikes."
"Stan's strength is location of his
fastball," Robbins said. "He's not afraid
to throw inside and work the inside corner
(of the plate)."
Spencer will be a candidate to start, or
might step into one of the long-relief
spots that Wassenaar and Osuna filled
last year, Dunton said.
Also battling for starting spots will be
juniors Brian Keyser and Jim Price and
sophomore Mark Carper. All three of
them, however, are question marks.
Keyser gave some idea of his promise
when he went five innings and gave up

only four hits against Louisiana State in
the College World Series last June.
"When Brian's on, he's got the best stuff
of anyone on the staff," Robbins said.
"We're counting on him to fill some big
shoes."
However, Keyser has been experiencing
some soreness in his elbow and probably
won't throw this weekend. Marquess de
scribed Keyser's condition as "day-to
day."
The 6-foot-5 Price, who also plays tight
end on the Stanford football team, was
a mystery last year. "For the first part of
the season he was one of our better
pitchers, but then he tailed off for
whatever reason," Marquess said. Robbins
said that Price may have been pitching
in pain after reporting to spring football
practice in April.
When he's healthy, Price "has the best
movement on his fastball" of anyone on
the staff, and also throws an effective
split-fingered fastball, Robbins said.
Carper will remain a question mark for
a while. After undergoing surgery in July
for ligament and cartilage damage in his
left knee, he was expected to be available
in late March. "But he's come back,"
Marquess said. "He's not going to beat
anybody in the 50-yard dash, but he can
pitch, and he's had one or two outings
in early January and has thrown very
hard."
One thing's certain about the Cardinal
staff: Whoever pitches, he'll be throwing
the ball right-handed.
Dunton said that Stanford may face
some batting orders stacked with left
handed hitters, but that's not a cause for
concern, according to Chitren. "I don't
think it's going to be that big of a
problem," he said. "Our right-handers arc
pretty used to seeing lefties, and we know
what we need to do to get them out."
Correction: Yesterday's article incorrectly
stated the starting times of this weekend's
games. Stanford plays Santa Clara at 2
p.m. Friday at Sunken Diamond. Satur
day's alumni game — featuring numerous
former Stanford players now playing at
various professional levels — is at noon
at Sunken Diamond. The Cardinal plays
Santa Clara again at noon Sunday at Buck
Shaw Stadium in Santa Clara.
