# What's up with 49er hype?
## 
### 
Perhaps you've noticed something has
been absent from The Daily sports page
the past few weeks.
We haven't run a single story about
that San Francisco football team.
You know, the one that's been in all
the local papers almost every day since
their untimely demise. The team that
gets more press for losing than most
teams get for winning.

Forty-Niner hype has reached such
ridiculous proportions in the Bay Area
that two weeks after the 'Miners' loss,
the press is still devoting the vast
majority of the sports page to the team.
Columnists (particularly in that formerly
green section) write about Walsh, Mon
tana & Co. every day.
Let it be known, just for the record,
that Chris Fialko, Brendan Healey and
I (until now) have not said one word
about Jerry Rice's hairdo, finesse, char
donnay or gum-throwing all year.

Nor have we mentioned The Great
Quarterback Controversy. Who really
cares in January about who will be the
49ers' QB next August? Talk about
making something out of nothing. Will
Montana retire? Or, more likely, will
Walsh force him to? Will Joe get fatal
food poisoning at Dwight Clark's new
restaurant?
Will Steve Young get traded? Will
he move to fullback where he can better
use his running and blocking capabili
ties? Will former Stanford quarterback
John Paye emerge as the top contender
for the position in training camp and
beat out both Montana and Young?
Will Freddie Solomon, the former
'Nincr receiver and emergency QB,
come out of retirement to take over at
signal-caller for good? The S.F.
sportwriters seem to have covered most
of the possibilities and impossibilities,
if anyone's even paying attention to
them anymore.
Just as we're nearly recovering from
49er overkill, along comes the biggest
publicity attraction of all — the Super
Bowl.
Sar Diego is the biggest victim of
hyperbole so far. There was even an
article in a local paper (the one that
used to have a green sports section)
that referred to the Southern California

city as "Minneapolis on the ocean" —
and that was just in the headline. Gosh,
the similarities just abound.
Then there are all the stories about
Bronco fans and the extremes they'll
go to to get tickets. A woman painted
herself blue and rode on horseback,
nude, through Denver to demonstrate
her immense allegiance to the team.
(She got tickets.)
A few days ago, a man put an ad in
a Denver paper offering to trade his
"non-shopping, non cooking wife with
an attitude problem" for a ticket to the
Super Bowl. Feminist groups are now
picketing his house, but the husband
has gotten hundreds of calls, and his
wife seems pretty nonchalant about the
whole thing. Someone offered her hus
band two horses for her and she said,
"Well, at least they weren't donkeys or
something — then I'd be upset." A
great step forward for women's lib.
The sad thing is, with Super Bowl
hysteria at full pitch, the guy will prob
ably get a ticket anyway, because he
has a gimmick. And gimmicks are what
the Super Bowl is all about, since the
actual game is never any good.
All I can say is, thank God the 49ers
aren't in the Super Bowl again. The
combination of hype and Super hype
would be too much.
