# Minority groups fault University admissions

Leaders of campus minority groups agreed last night
that University admissions policies do not adequately
attract a wide range of minority students to Stanford.
At a forum organized by Otero house, a panel
representing the Black Student Union (BSU), the
Asian American Student Association (AASA), EI
Centro Chicano and the Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO) addressed Stanford admissions
policies, racial prejudice on campus and students' ig
norance of other cultures.
According to junior Rudy Fuentes, co-coordinator
of El Centro Chicano, many minority students have
been left out of the admissions process as University
admissions officers have shifted their attention away
from areas of the country once targeted for minority
recruitment.
Fuentes, a native of southern Texas, said this area
— which has a large minority population — was
neglected by Stanford admissions officers when they
began to concentrate more on recruiting students from
the Midwest two years ago.
SAIO member Tracy Leßeau, a freshman, said the
bulk of admissions office recruitment efforts are aimed
at students living in urban areas, but many minorities
live in rural parts of the country.
She was also critical of the efforts of Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions Jean Fetter to attract
European students to Stanford. "Dean Fetter can go
to Europe and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars
to recruit students there, but won't spend $10 to go
to Oakland," Leßeau said.
Leaders of AASA say that although the University
admits many Asian students, these students do not
accurately represent a geographical and economic cross
section of Asians.
Senior Vivian Wu, a member of AASA, said most
Asian students at Stanford are of Taiwanese descent,
and the University does not admit a large number of
Korean, Vietnamese and Filipino students. She also
noted that while between 50 and 60 percent of
Japanese and Chinese people belong to the "working
class," the majority of Asian Americans admitted to
Stanford come from wealthy families.
Working class Asians are not well-represented here
because they are not actively recruited and do not

receive financial aid information, Wu said.
The minority group leaders also criticized the faculty
and administration for lacking knowledge and interest
in cultural differences between different peoples.
"The majority of the faculty and administrators don't
know about Asian and other cultures," Wu said. "They
don't understand what it means to be Asian-
American."
Sophomore Li Miao, co-chairperson of AASA's Ed
ucational and Cultural Committee, said one solution
is to increase the number of minority faculty members.
"Administrators should respect the minority com
munity as equal partners instead of as irritants," said
BSU Chair Bill King, a senior.
Fuentec echoed King's statement, saying activism
on the part of minorities is often wrongly viewed with
