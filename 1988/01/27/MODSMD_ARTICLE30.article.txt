Indiana men's basketball Coach Bobby
Knight's revelation about the Stanford men's
basketball team last month that "the game
can be played by people who are students"
was proven again yesterday.
The Pacific 10 Conference All-Academic
Football Team selections were released yes
terday, with the Stanford football team
placing no less than seven players on the
first team. No other school had more than
three named.
Most notable for Stanford was senior run
ning back Brad Muster (3.2 grade-point
average in economics), who became the con
ference's first-ever four-time first-team selec
tion. Muster earlier received national honors
by being named to the GTE/COSIDA Aca
demic All-America First Team.
Muster was joined on the first-team offense
by sophomore running back Jon Volpe (3.5
in industrial engineering) and sophomore of
fensive guard Andy Papathanassiou (3.0 in
economics).
Making the first team on defense were
senior free safety Rick Theder (3.4 in indus
trial engineering), who was selected for the
second time, junior nose guard Buck Rog
geman (3.4 in English), senior punter Doug
Robison (3.0 in public policy) and senior
nose guard Eric Volta (3.0 in history).

"It makes me feel a little honored," Volta
said. "My first couple of years here weren't
exactly the best (academically), but I turned
it around."*
"When I first got to Stanford," he said, "I
didn't feel I could compete in the classroom.
I thought the only reason that I was here
was that I could play football. At the end
of my sophomore year, I realized I could
compete in the classroom as well. And when
you think you can do something you spend
more time on it."
Stanford rolled another seven on the
honorable-mention list, bringing the total
number of Stanford honorees to 14.
Honorable mention recipients included
senior quarterback Greg Ennis, sophomore
offensive guards Chuck Gillingham and Dan
Nash and sophomore wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey on offense, and junior cornerback
Brad Cook, junior outside linebacker Rob
Hinckley and senior inside linebacker Paul
Svitenko on defense.
Hinckley and first-team selection Robison
received honorable mention honors last year.
Oregon and Washington State each had
three players selected to the All-Academic
First Team. In terms of players selected over
all, Oregon had eight, followed by Washing
ton State with five, Arizona with four, Oregon
State, UCLA, USC and Washington with
three, and Arizona State with two. California
placed one man on the team.
