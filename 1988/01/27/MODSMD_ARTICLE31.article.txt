# Election '88
## Garrison announces bid for House seat 
### Johnny Cuerva 
Mountain View businessman Jim
Garrison, declared his candidacy for
Congress in the 12th District —
which includes Stanford — at his
campaign headquarters in Moun
tain View yesterday,
Garrison joins Anna Eshoo,
Robin Yeamans and Sylvia Sim
mons as a Democratic candidate
for the congressional nomination in
a district that has long been a Re
publican stronghold.
Vying for the Republican nomi
nation are incumbent Rep. Ernie
Konnyu and Stanford Law Prof.
Tom Campbell.
Garrison said yesterday his
chances of winning are "excellent"
and that he is "highly qualified" for
the position. He cited his extensive
international experience gained as
executive director of the Esalen In
stitute, which he described as an
international business consulting
firm located in Big Sur. He added
that he has already raised $80,000
to finance his campaign.
According to Garrison, the 12th
District needs a Democratic repre
sentative to help Silicon Valley
businesses, which face increasing
foreign competition. In the 19905,
he noted, area businesses will need
government assistance that he said
only a Democrat will provide.

Garrison said that his interna
tional experience as a mediator be
tween the governments of Pacific
Rim countries and American com
panies wishing to do business there
would make him the only member
of Congress to have had extensive
international negotiating experi
ence.
If elected, Garrison said he would
increase environmental protection
and focus on rebuilding social pro
grams such as education and child
care, which he said have been "cut
to the bone" by the Reagan admin
istration.
Garrison and the other Demo
cratic candidates are running in a
traditionally strong Republican dis
trict. A Democrat has not been
elected in the 12th District since
B.F. Sisk won in 1960.
Sue 12th District candidates are
scheduled to participate in a forum
on national security issues Friday
at 7:30 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
The forum is sponsored by PIC
PAC, a non-partisian political ac
tion committee located in Palo
Alto.
The forum will be moderated by
Santa Clara County Court Judge
LaDoris Corde. Political Science
Assoc. Prof. Condoleezza Rice and
Coit Blacker, acting co-director of
Stanford's Center for International
Security and Arms Control, will be
panelists.
