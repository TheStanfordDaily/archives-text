### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
Students will have an opportunity to speak out on
University policies concerning campus minorities at a
forum tonight organized by the University Committee
on Minority Issues.
The committee, charged with examining the quality
of minority life at Stanford, was established last year
by University President Donald Kennedy in response
to demands made by the Rainbow Agenda, a coalition
of student minority groups.
The forum, which will take place at 7 p.m. in Room
2 of the History Garner, is "intended to elicit maximum
information" on the minority student presence, resi
dential life, educational activities and on support ser
vices such as couseling and advising, said committee
vice chair Faye McNair-Knox.
The committee expects to submit a report this fall
that may include policy recommen
dations in line with the committee's
charge to "promote a University en
vironment in which all members
have equal opportunity to develop
full human potential."
In addition to committee mem
bers, the forum will feature stu
dents, faculty and staff, who will
voice their opinions and comment
on minority life at Stanford. Com
ments may be public or confidential,
according to committee staff mem
ber Fernando de Necochea.
"This is part of an effort to be
as collaborative as possible," said

Nccochea, who added that the com
mittee has already met with Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons in
its preliminary efforts to gather gen
eral information on minority issues.
"This is the first [part] of a more
formal outreach effort," .said
McNair-Knox, who is also an assis
tant dean for Student Affairs. She
explained that the committee plans
to hold at least three other forums
by the end of the academic year to
acquire information and gauge stu
dent sentiment on various minority
issues.
"The second step will be to
analyze and evaluate the infor
mation," Necochca said. In addition
to holding the forums, Necochea
said the committee is considering
hiring ouside professional research

ers to examine the minority issue.
Student life is one of five areas
the committee is currently investi
gating. The other areas include:
• curriculum;
• undergraduate and graduate
recruitment;
• faculty recruitment and hiring;
promotion and development; and
• staff recruitment, hiring, promo
tion and development.
"We will have various types of
other forums for these areas," said
History Prof. Albert Camarillo, the
committee chair.
Before writing its final report in
October, the committee will
prepare a preliminary report to be
completed this April. "It'll be a
substantive report," Neocochea
said.
