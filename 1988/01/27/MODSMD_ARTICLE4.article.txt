# Forum to air ethnic concerns
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
Students will have an opportunity to speak out on
University policies concerning campus minorities at a
forum tonight organized by the University Committee
on Minority Issues.
The committee, charged with examining the quality
of minority life at Stanford, was established last year
by University President Donald Kennedy in response
to demands made by the Rainbow Agenda, a coalition
of student minority groups.
The forum, which will take place at 7 p.m. in Room
2 of the History Garner, is "intended to elicit maximum
information" on the minority student presence, resi
dential life, educational activities and on support ser
vices such as couseling and advising, said committee
vice chair Faye McNair-Knox.
The committee expects to submit a report this fall
