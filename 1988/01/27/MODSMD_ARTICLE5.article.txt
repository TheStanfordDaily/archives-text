# Former White House aides
## Voters will reject Reaganism, panelists agree 
### Bobby Schrader Senior staff writer 
The American electorate will at
tempt in the upcoming election "to
move away from the permissiveness
and go-go personality" that has
characterized the Reagan years, a
former Carter administration offi
cial said last night at a panel dis
cussion in Krcsge Auditorium.
"The American people perceive
that something is going wrong," said
Gerald Rafshoon, former assistant
communications director under
President Carter. Rafshoon spoke
as part of "White House Insiders,"
a panel discussion moderated by
University President Donald Ken
nedy and featuring several former
top White House aides.
Other panel participants in
cluded John Ehrlichman, former as
sistant to the president for domestic
affairs in the Nixon administration,
and Martin Anderson, former as
sistant to the president for policy
development in the Reagan admin
istration.
The panelists agreed that inter
national security and the economy

will be the two most important is
sues in the presidential campaign.
"In the economic sphere, the pri
mary question is, what to do about
the deficit? ... and on issues of
defense, the name of the game is
bilateral nuclear disarmament,"
Anderson said.
Rafshoon said greed and corrup
tion in American society, under
scored by the Wall Street insider
trading scandals, have alerted the
American public to attitudinal
problems in society.
The panel also addressed the role
of the press in shaping the outcome
of elections. Rafshoon said the
American people "don't vote on is
sues. ... The issues facing this
country are too complex for the
American people." Rather, the
voters "choose candidates who they
think can handle the issues best for
them," he said.
Ehrlichman questioned whether
the voters could really see through
the media images cultivated by the
candidates to look at the substance
of their ideas.
Ehrlichman, who is best known

for his role in the Watergate
coverup which led to the downfall
of the Nixon presidency, said there
was a "distinct narrowing of the
federal agenda under the Reagan
administration" and that this af
fected the candidates' platforms in
1988.
Ehrlichman said Reagan's ten
dency to "push many things to the
state and local level" has redefined
the scope of presidential priorities,
which is reflected in turn in the
Democratic candidates' platforms.

Ehrlichman added, "(Democratic
presidential candidate Paul) Simon
is exceptional, but this condition
has resulted with the other Demo
crats slugging it out on Reagan's
ground."
Rafshoon said the"the ghost of
the Iran-contra affair" and the is
sues it raised — character, man
agement style and competence —
will hang over the candidates and
influence voter's judgments of
them.
Rafshoon asked the audience to

visualize how each candidate would
have handled the Iran-contra situ
ation. "Can you visualize Iran
contra happening under this guy?"
he asked the audience, referring to
a generic presidential candidate.
"Carter was elected because of
Watergate. Reagan was elected be
cause of the shortcomings of Jimmy
Carter. Every president paves the
way for his successor," he said.
"In this campaign I think crooks,
womanizers and ideologues need
not apply," Rafshoon said.
