# Branner fire fizzles

### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
A small fire in a Branner Hall kitchen
early yesterday morning forced residents
out of the freshman dormitory for about
an hour until smoke cleared from the
building.
According to Palo Alto firefighter Doug
Konn, the fire department responded to
an alarm at about 12:30 a.m. and found
that a small fire in a second-floor kitchen
had already been extinguished by resi
dents.
Konn said "no real damage had occur
red," but that heavy smoke kept the alarm
going for another half hour until the smoke
dissipated.
Branner computer coordinater Adam

Josephs said the cause of the fire was a
wax design class project that overheated
and burst into flames on the kitchen stove.
Josephs, a senior, said the fire broke
out when paraffin wax caught fire in an
open pot. When the student working on
the project tried to put out the fire by
smothering it and then lifting the pot off
the stove, wax spilled on the floor and
spread the fire.
Freshman Ethan Rikleen, the student
working on the design project, said the
pot of wax caught fire suddenly, taking
him by surprise.
He said he had been trying to melt the
wax so he could mold it into different
textures, and that he didn't realize that
paraffin could be ignited at such a low
temperature.
