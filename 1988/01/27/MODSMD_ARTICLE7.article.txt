# ASSU straw poll
## Students favor condom dispensers 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
Two thirds of Stanford students favor
putting condom dispensers in University
residences, according to a straw poll of
student opinion released last night by the
ASSU and the Council of Presidents.
The results of the poll, which was the
second student survey conducted by ASSU
Straw Poll Coordinator Patty Marby, were
announced at an ASSU Senate meeting
last night.
In a telephone poll of 98 graduates and
93 undergraduates two weeks ago, 67 per
cent of respondents said they wanted Res
idential Education to put condom dis
pensers in student residences. Nine per
cent opposed such a measure, and 24

pcrcent had no opinion.
The poll also indicated that 50 percent
of respondents were dissatisfied with the
current parking permit system, while 25
pcrcent were satisfied. The remaining 25
percent had no opinion.
The senate last night approved contin
ued funding for the straw poll.
, Marby said the Council of Presidents
(COP) consults with a statistical analyst
under Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody to ensure that the poll questions
arc unbiased and that the poll results are
accurate.
In other business last night, senator
Stacey Lcyton asked the senate to start
a petition of students favoring the Area
One Task Force Proposal, which among
other things would eliminate the Western

Culture core reading list and rename the
Area One requirement "Cultures, Ideas
and Values (CIV)."
The senate continues to endorse the
CIV proposal despite a proposal last week
by English Prof. William Chace, which
Leyton called "threatening."
Chace's proposal, which has been
signed by 22 other faculty members, seeks
to retain the core list with the addition
of works by women and minorities.
"At the Faculty Senate meeting last
week, about 20 more professors signed a
faculty petition for the CIV proposal, so
right now it's really hard to say" what
the final Faculty Senate decision will be,
Leyton said.
"A lot of faculty are feeling optimistic
(about the CIV proposal)," she added.
