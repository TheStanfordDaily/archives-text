At least 30 dead in Mexico blast
MEXICO CITY — The official death count in a coal mine
explosion and fire in northern Mexico rose to 30 yesterday. Nine
other miners are feared dead, trapped near the bottom in the worst
mining disaster in Mexico in 19 years.
Rescue teams of miners,and technicians from the Red Cross and
local fire departments worked through the day yesterday in an
effort to rescue the last miners believed to have been trapped by
the explosion Monday. Rescue operations were delayed by the need
to pump out water poured in to extinguish the blaze.
"The nine are cut off in the next to the last cave of the mine,"
said Martin Flores Cura, a member of the fire department in
Monclova, the largest nearby city. "It has been a long time and
there is probably very little oxygen where they are."
Ninety-nine miners, most burned or bruised, escaped in the first
moments after the explosion or were pulled out afterward. There
were 138 miners working the morning shift when the explosion
occurred, company officials said.
The explosion occurred when a short circuit in an electrical
transformer ignited methane gas that had built up in the mine,
according to officials of Sidermex, the government steel company
that owns the mine.
It occurred at the "Four and a Half' mine in Las Esperanzas
about 80 miles southwest of Piedras Negras on the Texas border.
The mining area is in Coahuila, a major coal-producing state.
El Salvador frees murder suspects
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — A military appeals court
yesterday ordered the release of three prisoners accused of shooting
to death four U.S. Marines and nine civilians at an outdoor cafe
in 1985.
The tribunal upheld a decision by a lower military court pardoning
the men under a sweeping amnesty law on political crimes. The
three have never been brought to trial for the killings, for which
a leftist guerrilla faction claimed responsibility.
Yesterday's decision apparently will cost the Salvadoran govern
ment $18.5 million in U.S. economic support. Congress voted in
December to withhold 10 percent of the $185 million in economic
aid approved for El Salvador this year if the suspects are released.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman
said that his department was examining the legislation but that it
appeared that the 10 percent cut will be automatic upon their release.
In San Salvador, U.S. Embassy spokesman Jake Gillespie called
the court order "morally wrong and politically damaging. We are
dismayed at the court's decision."
He said the embassy was studying possible appeals. However,
the Salvadoran attorney general, Roberto Giron Flores, said the
appeals process had been exhausted. "There is no more recourse,"
Giron Flores said.
Shultz to see Mubarak, Palestiiieans
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz is to discuss
the escalating Arab-Israeli confrontation in the occupied territories
today with two Palestinian leaders, the State Department announced
yesterday. '
One of the two is an East Jerusalem newspaper publisher arrested
earlier this month for urging a nonviolent boycott of Israeli cigarettes
and other products.
Department spokesman Charles Redman said the two men —
Hanna Siniora, publisher of the Arabic-language newspaper A 1
Fajr, and Fayez Abu Rahme, an attorney — were "Palestinians
with whom one can talk about the situation in the occupied ter
ritories."
Shultz is also scheduled to confer today with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, who arrived in Washington last night on an official
state visit.
Earlier in the day, in London, Mubarak and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher issued a joint call for an international conference
to rejuvenate the Arab-Israel peace process. Mubarak stopped in
London as well as Bonn on his way to Washington.
Siniora and Abu Rahme were among a group of Palestinian
leaders who refused to meet Shultz last October in Jerusalem, a
snub the secretary of state angrily blamed on intimidation by
"enemies of peace" in the Palestine Liberation Organization. At
the time, Palestinian sources said that if Shultz wanted to talk
about conditions on the West Bank and in Gaza "he should talk
to the PLO."
Indians reject Sandinista demand
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Talks aimed at ending Nicaragua's
Indian insurgency hit an early snag yesterday when the Indians
rejected a government demand that they publicly oppose further
U.S. aid to the contras.
The dispute surfaced on the first day of peace talks here between
Interior Minister Tomas Borge and a Miskito Indian group led by
Brooklyn Rivera, who has broken with the contra movement to
negotiate on Indian rights.
Armstrong Wiggins, an aide to Rivera, said that Indian negotiators
were surprised by Borge's opening position. He said that the minister
was blocking a promised visit by the newly returned exiles to their
Atlantic coastal homeland unless they urge the U.S. Congress to
vote against new aid to anti-Sandinista rebels.
Borge, whose ministry governs the coastal region, did not comment
publicly on the government position.
It appeared to underscore the Sandinistas' determination to use
the Indian visit to sway the vote set for next week on a Reagan
administration request for about $36 million in contra aid.
"We did not come here to be used like this," Wiggins said during
a mid-day recess in the talks at the Moravian Church. "We came
to speak with our people so we can negotiate in their interest.
Then if we see that the government is serious about Indian rights,
we might take a position on what the Congress should do."
Bush camp happy after TV quarrel
WASHINGTON — Officials in Vice President George Bush's
campaign — and some independent political analysts — declared
yesterday that Bush gained valuable ground in his fight for the
Republican presidential nomination by standing up to CBS News
anchorman Dan Rather and angrily refusing to answer his questions
on the Iran-contra scandal.
Bush himself gloried in a flood of backslapping and phone calls
that his staff said was running 10-1 in Bush's favor after the brawling
live television interview on the CBS Evening News Monday.
"I need combat pay for last night, I'll tell you," he joked to a
luncheon audience during a day of campaigning in Wyoming. The
crowd burst into applause.
"It absolutely was a plus for the vice president," Bush spokesman
Pete Teeley said, "because the American people have seen Rather
push people around for 20 years, and the fact is that George Bush
stood up to the guy and refused to be bullied and went toe to toe
with him."

transformer ignited methane gas that had built up in the mine,
according to officials of Sidermex, the government steel company
that owns the mine.
It occurred at the "Four and a Half' mine in Las Esperanzas
about 80 miles southwest of Piedras Negras on the Texas border.
The mining area is in Coahuila, a major coal-producing state.
El Salvador frees murder suspects
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — A military appeals court
yesterday ordered the release of three prisoners accused of shooting
to death four U.S. Marines and nine civilians at an outdoor cafe
in 1985.
The tribunal upheld a decision by a lower military court pardoning
the men under a sweeping amnesty law on political crimes. The
three have never been brought to trial for the killings, for which
a leftist guerrilla faction claimed responsibility.
Yesterday's decision apparently will cost the Salvadoran govern
ment $18.5 million in U.S. economic support. Congress voted in
December to withhold 10 percent of the $185 million in economic
aid approved for El Salvador this year if the suspects are released.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman
said that his department was examining the legislation but that it
appeared that the 10 percent cut will be automatic upon their release.
In San Salvador, U.S. Embassy spokesman Jake Gillespie called
the court order "morally wrong and politically damaging. We are
dismayed at the court's decision."
He said the embassy was studying possible appeals. However,
the Salvadoran attorney general, Roberto Giron Flores, said the
appeals process had been exhausted. "There is no more recourse,"
Giron Flores said.
Shultz to see Mubarak, Palestiiieans
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz is to discuss
the escalating Arab-Israeli confrontation in the occupied territories
today with two Palestinian leaders, the State Department announced
yesterday. '
One of the two is an East Jerusalem newspaper publisher arrested
earlier this month for urging a nonviolent boycott of Israeli cigarettes
and other products.
Department spokesman Charles Redman said the two men —
Hanna Siniora, publisher of the Arabic-language newspaper A 1
Fajr, and Fayez Abu Rahme, an attorney — were "Palestinians
with whom one can talk about the situation in the occupied ter
ritories."
Shultz is also scheduled to confer today with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, who arrived in Washington last night on an official
state visit.
Earlier in the day, in London, Mubarak and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher issued a joint call for an international conference
to rejuvenate the Arab-Israel peace process. Mubarak stopped in
London as well as Bonn on his way to Washington.
Siniora and Abu Rahme were among a group of Palestinian
leaders who refused to meet Shultz last October in Jerusalem, a
snub the secretary of state angrily blamed on intimidation by
"enemies of peace" in the Palestine Liberation Organization. At
the time, Palestinian sources said that if Shultz wanted to talk
about conditions on the West Bank and in Gaza "he should talk
to the PLO."
Indians reject Sandinista demand
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Talks aimed at ending Nicaragua's
Indian insurgency hit an early snag yesterday when the Indians
rejected a government demand that they publicly oppose further
U.S. aid to the contras.
The dispute surfaced on the first day of peace talks here between
Interior Minister Tomas Borge and a Miskito Indian group led by
Brooklyn Rivera, who has broken with the contra movement to
negotiate on Indian rights.
Armstrong Wiggins, an aide to Rivera, said that Indian negotiators
were surprised by Borge's opening position. He said that the minister
was blocking a promised visit by the newly returned exiles to their
Atlantic coastal homeland unless they urge the U.S. Congress to
vote against new aid to anti-Sandinista rebels.
Borge, whose ministry governs the coastal region, did not comment
publicly on the government position.
It appeared to underscore the Sandinistas' determination to use
the Indian visit to sway the vote set for next week on a Reagan
administration request for about $36 million in contra aid.
"We did not come here to be used like this," Wiggins said during
a mid-day recess in the talks at the Moravian Church. "We came
to speak with our people so we can negotiate in their interest.
Then if we see that the government is serious about Indian rights,
we might take a position on what the Congress should do."
Bush camp happy after TV quarrel
WASHINGTON — Officials in Vice President George Bush's
campaign — and some independent political analysts — declared
yesterday that Bush gained valuable ground in his fight for the
Republican presidential nomination by standing up to CBS News
anchorman Dan Rather and angrily refusing to answer his questions
on the Iran-contra scandal.
Bush himself gloried in a flood of backslapping and phone calls
that his staff said was running 10-1 in Bush's favor after the brawling
live television interview on the CBS Evening News Monday.
"I need combat pay for last night, I'll tell you," he joked to a
luncheon audience during a day of campaigning in Wyoming. The
crowd burst into applause.
"It absolutely was a plus for the vice president," Bush spokesman
Pete Teeley said, "because the American people have seen Rather
push people around for 20 years, and the fact is that George Bush
stood up to the guy and refused to be bullied and went toe to toe
with him."

At least 30 dead in Mexico blast
MEXICO CITY — The official death count in a coal mine
explosion and fire in northern Mexico rose to 30 yesterday. Nine
other miners are feared dead, trapped near the bottom in the worst
mining disaster in Mexico in 19 years.
Rescue teams of miners,and technicians from the Red Cross and
local fire departments worked through the day yesterday in an
effort to rescue the last miners believed to have been trapped by
the explosion Monday. Rescue operations were delayed by the need
to pump out water poured in to extinguish the blaze.
"The nine are cut off in the next to the last cave of the mine,"
said Martin Flores Cura, a member of the fire department in
Monclova, the largest nearby city. "It has been a long time and
there is probably very little oxygen where they are."
Ninety-nine miners, most burned or bruised, escaped in the first
moments after the explosion or were pulled out afterward. There
were 138 miners working the morning shift when the explosion
occurred, company officials said.
The explosion occurred when a short circuit in an electrical
transformer ignited methane gas that had built up in the mine,
according to officials of Sidermex, the government steel company
that owns the mine.
It occurred at the "Four and a Half' mine in Las Esperanzas
about 80 miles southwest of Piedras Negras on the Texas border.
