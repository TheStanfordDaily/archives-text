## Minorities seek sensitivity 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Expressing disappointment, frus
tration and fatigue, racial minority
students last night challenged the
University and student groups to
approach minority concerns with
more sensitivity and to take imme
diate action to correct institutional
racism.
More than 80 students, faculty
and staff attended a forum organ
ized by the University Committee
on Minority Issues, which was
formed last spring in response to
demands by racial minority groups
that the University improve Stan
ford minority life. The forum's pur
pose was to allow students to inform
the committee about their concerns
with University policies and student
attitudes toward minorities.
Two of the main targets of staff
and student criticism were the Of
fice of Student Affairs and The Dai
ly-
While Student Affairs "is suppor
tive of the things (minority) groups
have been asking for, somehow the
senior policymakers are not hearing
what we (members of minority com
munities) are saying," said Juan
Ynigucz, assistant dean of Student
Affairs.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Campus Affairs Michael Jackson,
some of what he called mispcrccp

tions of racial minority organiza
tions are due to "the inaccuracy
and ineptness of The Daily."
Moreover, The Daily is discrim
inatory in its policies, according
junior Alex Sweet, a member of
MEChA. "Our views arc not given
equal time in The Daily," he said.
"Basically we had to coerce The
Daily into publishing (a letter to
the editor promoting MEChA's
support of a grape boycott)."
Steve Phillips, former chair of the
Black Student Union and a Stan
ford alumnus, charged that some
inaccuracies about minorities stem
from Student Affairs. "Often misin
formation gets out to the public
and never gets followed up," he
said.
The purpose of this "interactive"
forum, the first of its kind, was "to
engage in dialogue, to raise issues,
to establish communication with
students, faculty and staff about
University policies, said Assoc. His
tory Prof. Albert Camarillo, chair
of the committee.
"We are dealing with some very
sensitive issues, issues that arc
charged with emotion," said
Camarillo when he opened up the
discussion to members of the com
mittee and to the audience.
Students from the African Amer
ican, Asian-American, Chicano-
Latino and Native American com
munities responded with feelings of

alienation and isolation.
"Parts of the (Stanford) family
are being neglected," said Joey
Thomas, a student member of the
committee. "We need to appreciate
some of the things these parts of
the family contribute," he said.
Instead, some students said they
are made to feel unwanted at Stan
ford. "I feel like a bastard child at
a family reunion," said Cheryl
Taylor, a member of the BSU.
Saying that she feels like she is
being asked to "deny my blackness,"
Taylor expressed feelings of dis
couragement at the lack of response
on the part of white students to
minority issues. "This is not just
our problem; it is everyone's
problem," she said.
This concern that the burden of
racism is viewed as the responsibil
ity of minority students and not an
issue for majority students was a
main focus of the two-and-a-half
hour discussion.
Many students raised the issue
of what they saw as the University's
attempt to avoid issues of institu
tional racism. "I find it hard to
believe that Stanford students can
escape a problem (racism) that
plagues the rest of society," said
Mary Dillard, a sophomore who
lives in Ujamaa House.

by Leonard Adler, a member of the
Council of Presidents, about the
responsibility of white students —
and particularly the ASSU — in
overcoming institutional racism,
BSU Chair Bill King asked for help
in organizing dorm discussions
about "openness to differences."
And while minority leaders
stressed the dire need for such dis
cussions, they also expressed a

sense of fatigue.
"I'm 21 years old, I'm black in
America, and I'm tired already,"
said Amanda Kemp, a resident as
sistant in Ujamaa and a member
of the BSU. "I still have a lot longer
to live."
Kemp told the the forum of her
discouragement at Stanford. "I
came into this institution expecting
it was going to help me change
society; now I feel deluded," Kemp
said.
"We have a deep attachment to
(the minority organizations) be

cause they represent a part of our
selves," Kemp said, "They are not
just clubs, they are organizations,
advocates, holders of information,
homes for some of us, forces that
bring us together."
The forum was the first step in
a year-long process evaluating the
quality of minority life at Stanford.
The committee plans to hold dorm
discussions, organize more forum,
and conduct further interviews with
students, faculty and staff before
issuing its report to the University
next fall.

Ynigucz, assistant dean of Student
Affairs.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Campus Affairs Michael Jackson,
some of what he called mispcrccp

tions of racial minority organiza
tions are due to "the inaccuracy
and ineptness of The Daily."
Moreover, The Daily is discrim
inatory in its policies, according
junior Alex Sweet, a member of
MEChA. "Our views arc not given
equal time in The Daily," he said.
"Basically we had to coerce The
Daily into publishing (a letter to
the editor promoting MEChA's
support of a grape boycott)."
Steve Phillips, former chair of the
Black Student Union and a Stan
ford alumnus, charged that some
inaccuracies about minorities stem
from Student Affairs. "Often misin
formation gets out to the public
and never gets followed up," he
said.
The purpose of this "interactive"
forum, the first of its kind, was "to
engage in dialogue, to raise issues,
to establish communication with
students, faculty and staff about
University policies, said Assoc. His
tory Prof. Albert Camarillo, chair
of the committee.
"We are dealing with some very
sensitive issues, issues that arc
charged with emotion," said
Camarillo when he opened up the
discussion to members of the com
mittee and to the audience.
Students from the African Amer
ican, Asian-American, Chicano-
Latino and Native American com
munities responded with feelings of

alienation and isolation.
"Parts of the (Stanford) family
are being neglected," said Joey
Thomas, a student member of the
committee. "We need to appreciate
some of the things these parts of
the family contribute," he said.
Instead, some students said they
are made to feel unwanted at Stan
ford. "I feel like a bastard child at
a family reunion," said Cheryl
Taylor, a member of the BSU.
Saying that she feels like she is
being asked to "deny my blackness,"
Taylor expressed feelings of dis
couragement at the lack of response
on the part of white students to
minority issues. "This is not just
our problem; it is everyone's
problem," she said.
This concern that the burden of
racism is viewed as the responsibil
ity of minority students and not an
issue for majority students was a
main focus of the two-and-a-half
hour discussion.
Many students raised the issue
of what they saw as the University's
attempt to avoid issues of institu
tional racism. "I find it hard to
believe that Stanford students can
escape a problem (racism) that
plagues the rest of society," said
Mary Dillard, a sophomore who
lives in Ujamaa House.

by Leonard Adler, a member of the
Council of Presidents, about the
responsibility of white students —
and particularly the ASSU — in
overcoming institutional racism,
BSU Chair Bill King asked for help
in organizing dorm discussions
about "openness to differences."
And while minority leaders
stressed the dire need for such dis
cussions, they also expressed a

sense of fatigue.
"I'm 21 years old, I'm black in
America, and I'm tired already,"
said Amanda Kemp, a resident as
sistant in Ujamaa and a member
of the BSU. "I still have a lot longer
to live."
Kemp told the the forum of her
discouragement at Stanford. "I
came into this institution expecting
it was going to help me change
society; now I feel deluded," Kemp
said.
"We have a deep attachment to
(the minority organizations) be

cause they represent a part of our
selves," Kemp said, "They are not
just clubs, they are organizations,
advocates, holders of information,
homes for some of us, forces that
bring us together."
The forum was the first step in
a year-long process evaluating the
quality of minority life at Stanford.
The committee plans to hold dorm
discussions, organize more forum,
and conduct further interviews with
students, faculty and staff before
issuing its report to the University
next fall.
Expressing disappointment, frus
tration and fatigue, racial minority
students last night challenged the
University and student groups to
approach minority concerns with
more sensitivity and to take imme
diate action to correct institutional
racism.
More than 80 students, faculty
and staff attended a forum organ
ized by the University Committee
on Minority Issues, which was
formed last spring in response to
demands by racial minority groups
that the University improve Stan
ford minority life. The forum's pur
pose was to allow students to inform
the committee about their concerns
with University policies and student
attitudes toward minorities.
Two of the main targets of staff
and student criticism were the Of
fice of Student Affairs and The Dai
ly-
While Student Affairs "is suppor
tive of the things (minority) groups
have been asking for, somehow the
senior policymakers are not hearing
what we (members of minority com
munities) are saying," said Juan
Ynigucz, assistant dean of Student
Affairs.
