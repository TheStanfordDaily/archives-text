# University to inform Fac Sen on joint deals
## 
### Mary Elizabeth McNitt Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate will be in
formed in advance about*
academically related joint ven
tures, University President
Donald Kennedy and Provost
James Rosse said last week, but
a former senator who has been
outspoken about the issue
downplayed the effect of the
policy last night, calling it a "non
policy."
"I think the senate should
have power over this kind of
decision," said English Prof.
Ronald Rcbholz. "Information is
meaningless if the senate can't
do anything about it."
The administration's decision
came in response to controversy
last June over a joint venture by
Charter Medical Corp. and the
Psychiatry Department at the
Medical Center. The University
will lease a $40 million psychia
tric hospital from Charter for 40
years until Stanford assumes full
ownership.
"It was sort of sprung on us
as an announcement," said Reb
holz.
Rebholz, currently on sabbati
cal, indicated that faculty were
concerned about having a private
company with profit motives

making decisions in an academic
department.
According to Rcbholz, the
joint venture would leave
Charter managing the Psychiatry
Department. The corporation
could have an impact on faculty
appointments and other aca
demic matters, he said.
Rebholz said the joint venture
contract is a key issue in the
dispute. The contract, which is
confidential, would indicate who
will be making decisions about
finances and who will make ac
ademic decisions.
Rosse said concerns over the
Charter issue were worked out
last summer in the Faculty Sen
ate and that the project is well
under way.
He also said that the Charter
issue was the first of its kind,
and that "joint ventures are ex
tremely rare." As a result, Rosse
said, he and Kennedy decided
not to set a specific policy on
the joint venture issue.
Rosse said that in the future
he and Kennedy will notify the
senate well in advance of joint
ventures so that senate members
may express their concern.
Rosse indicated that Kennedy
will write to the Faculty Steering
Committee confirming this
policy of advance notice.
