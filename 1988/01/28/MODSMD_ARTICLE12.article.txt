# Ex-model decries gender stereotypes
## 
### Angie Kim Staff writer 
A former model turned "radical
feminist" passionately urged a
Branner crowd last night to rebel
against unfair stereotypes of wom
en, especially as portrayed in the
media.
Anne Simonton, the coordinator
of Media Watch — a group that
works to promote a "healthier"
image of women in the media —
brought some of the more than 300
students in Branner to tears.
Simonton advocated the eradica
tion of pornography and media ad
vertising, which are "demeaning to
the female integrity."
"I'm not here to be a moralist,
but I'm here to prompt discussions
of the things which are all around
us that depict women as helpless,
passive sex toys that enjoy being
violated physically, that enjoy rape
and bondage," Simonton said.
"These media images desensitize
and numb us to the hostility of
them."
She cited her own modeling
career, which began at age 14, as
an example of such dehumaniza
tion. "I felt like a prostitute as a
model," she said. "I was selling my
body, and my agent seemed like a
pimp. The only difference was,
modeling was legal."
Simonton quit modeling in 1979,
exactly eight years after she was
gang-raped by three men early in
her career. She said she was unable
to take the rapists to trial, even
though she could identify one of

them, because she was told she
needed an eyewitness to prosecute.
Simonton said she quit when she
realized that by modeling she was
indirectly promoting violence
against women.
Last night, Simonton showed pic
tures of advertisements and media
clippings that glamourized charac
teristics such as passivity, stupidity
and worthlessness in women.
Even in ordinary magazine ad
vertisements, women are portrayed
as "cute little helpless creatures"
who are used to sell merchandise.
Men, on the other hand, are
equated with productive action, in
telligence and importance.
Such unfair and inaccurate
portrayals of women lead to harm
ful attitudes, Simonton said. Many
rapists claim they commit rape be
cause they don't see their victim
"as a human being." She showed
ads in which women were dismem
bered. "A piece of ass here, a thigh
there, a breast over there. ...
We're not seen as whole human
beings," she said.
"It's no wonder that statistics
show that one out of every four
girls will be sexually molested
before they are 16 years old, and
that one out of every three women
will be raped some time in her life,
and that one-half of women will be
beaten by her husband or lover
more than once in her lifetime,"
she said.

tcred rape victims arc especially
popular. She also showed examples
of subliminal images of nude
females and obscene and suggestive
language in advertisements.
She described the media and por
nography world as "a fantasy land"
that portrays "males stalking
females" as an enoyable adventure.
"We become desensitized after

seeing only five of these ads," she
said, and begin to think that "maybe
women don't even feel pain."
She ended her presentation with
a plea for activism and urged stu
dents to eradicate the negative con
notations of women in society by
means of civil disobedience, if ne
cessary.
"I've been arrested 11 times
now," she said. "It's the backbone
of our culture, the willingness to
risk for their beliefs. I hope it'll be
a trend again. Then we can cele
brate the diversity of women."
