## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper ASSU for students?

Lecture Notes is one of many valuable services
the ASSU provides to Stanford undergraduates.
Covering selected courses, the daily write-ups are
helpful materials for a student who might miss an
occasional class. But those who use them for this
purpose are forced to buy notes covering the entire
course, for the packets can only be obtained on a
full subscription basis.
The benevolent solution — to offer the notes in
daily or weekly, as well as full-course bundles —
has apparently been rejected as being less lucrative
and less efficient. However, though the ASSU
budgets nearly $12,500 income in its fiscal operating
expenses from Lecture Notes, an ASSU represen
tative recently told The Daily that closer to $20,000
is raised each year by the service. The ASSU should
be able to channel that extra revenue into improve
ments in service — such as making lecture notes
more readily available.
The situation with Lecture Notes is an example
of some of the problems with the ASSU's monetary
strategy. The 1987-88 budget indicates that over
half of the funds spent this year will go to operating
salaries. By contrast, a fraction will be allocated
for student services. Something is wrong here. The
ASSU should concentrate less on fattening itself

and more on attending to the needs of Stanford
students. While long-term saving and financial plan
ning are significant aspects of the ASSU's charge,
it should handle posterity where posterity belongs
— in investment portfolios. What is needed today
are more services.
The return of the ASSU Course Guide was to
mark such a renewal of commitment to genuine
services. The guide is a valuable academic resource
for many students, and its absence left a gap be
tween the University's Courses and Degrees and
departmental gossip. However, publication was
halted last year for reasons of cost, the ASSU said.
The data was put instead on-line on "Folio,"
where far fewer students will ever access it than
were exposed to the guide in its previous incarna
tion. One wonders how Lecture Notes can earn
excess profits of $8000, and projects like the Course
Guide can be so underfinanced as to be crippled.
The ASSU has become an inward-looking organ
ization concentrating more on its own financial
aggrandizement than on the services it is or should
be providing to students. It must rearrange its
priorities and look outside itself — to the community
eagerly awaiting improved services.
