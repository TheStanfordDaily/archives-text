Eliminate sexist,
aggressive ways
The infuriating article (Daily,
Jan. 25) concerning rape at a Stan
ford fraternity demands considera
tion of the value of the University
sponsorship of this kind of overtly
sexist and aggressive environment.
I am familiar with the notable
charity efforts of several fraterni
ties, and I realize that many, if not
most, fraternity members are fully
self-controlled and conscientious in
dividuals. However, charity and in
dividual goodwill has not and will
not overcome the systematic prob
lem posed by housed fraternities.
Through a string of incidents (in
cluded are the Jan. 25 rape stories,
last year's drowning death, the
flaming couch and the throwing of
the woman into a cement pond),
officialy housed and formerly
housed fraternities have shown us
the extremely negative character of
their cultures despite claims to the
contrary that they are "just a bunch
of guys havin' a good time." Fol
lowing sufficient evidence, the Uni
versity should force housed campus
fraternities off-campus.
By removing these factories of
sexism, worthless and dangerous in
ebriation, aggression and homopho
bia, the University could free itself
to a large degree of these unfor
tunate tendencies. Of course, as

they exist to some degree in all
residences and in the wider world
in general one cannot hope to erad
icate them quickly. But it would be
foolish to support their propagators.
It would be likewise reprehen
sible to "cut off' dislodged frater
nity members from aid. Though per
haps hopelessly idealistic, outreach
education in matterns concerning
sexism and problems of the world
in general at least give many "fra
ternity boys" the chance to trans
form themselves into self-controlled
responsible men.

Israel should
abide accords
As an alumnus and an occasional
reader of The Daily I would like
to comment on the letter "Israel
column simplistic and sen
sationalized" (Daily, Jan. 20).
I have also lived in the Middle
East before, during and after the
creation of the state of Israel and
have met many displaced Pales
tinians during this time.
It is evident that the writer fol
lows the highly organized or
chestrated propaganda philosophy
dictated by the many pro-Israel or
ganizations in this country. We con
stantly read, as the writer notes,

that "all citizens of Israel, including
Arabs, have full rights to vote and
protest." I wonder if he is reading
current newspapers and watching
TV reports and scenes of soldiers
shooting and beating Palestinian
teenagers in Jerusalem. Are these
examples of full rights?
The most unbelievable statement
is that a solution cannot be found
overnight because the problem is
complex, requires extensive re
search and patient negotiations
among pertinent parties. Israel has
had an iron-fist military occupation
for 20 years. Would anyone identify
20 years as overnight? The most
pertinent party is the Palestinian
â€” who has been trying to negotiate
for over 15 years. Israel has con
stantly refused and wants to dictate
to whom they will talk, if anyone.
The problem is not complex and
does not require extensive research.
It can be solved overnight. Just have
Israel abide by the Camp David
agreements by getting out of the
occupied territories and let the
Palestinians have their rightful
homeland.
