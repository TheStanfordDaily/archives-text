## Club is not egalitarian 
### 
Bohemian Club President George Elliot takes ex
ception to The Daily's "No Bohemians, please" edi
torial. Well, there is plenty to take exception to in
his reply in the viewpoint column "Single-sex clubs
justified" (Daily, Jan. 8).

First, on discrimination: Without bothering to men
tion why its members want to remain an all-male club,
the writer drags out the same justifications, like "the
freedom of association," as arc used by white
supremacists in South Africa and in this country.
But why has the Bohemian Club extended its dis
crimination ("freedom to not have women members")
to employment? Why has it taken a seven-year lawsuit
and a U.S. Supreme Court action to employ women
at the club's Bohemian Grove resort? The only logical
answer is that these guys want, need and believe in
discrimination, in membership and employment.
The recent labor troubles at the Bohemian Club
let us know what the club thinks of working people.
Among the provisions being implemented by the club,
in opposition to union proposals agreed to by the
other exclusive private clubs in San Francisco, are the
removal of retirees from receiving medical benefits, a
three-year wage freeze and the elimination of 11 per
cent of its work force from receiving medical benefits.
The removal of retirees from receiving medical
benefits is, probably the crudest of the Bohemian
Club's new labor policies. Employees who for many
years have catered to every whim of club members
are all of a sudden being denied this benefit in their
retirement that all of their co-workers who retired
over the last several decades have received.
The writer crows, "We have members of virtually
every 'class' of minorities that has been catagorized
by law" (except women). According to club employees,
blacks, Hispanics and Asians appear to be less than
1 percent of the membership. And the number of
Jews, and even Democrats, is minimal and qualifies
under the term "tokenism." Does the writer dare to
provide an ethnic breakdown of the club's member
ship?
The writer wails at the labeling of the Bohemian
Club as "reactionary" and "elitist." In reality, both of

these adjectives suit the club perfectly.
The elite nature of the Bohemian Club is well
documented in several books. The club's membership
rosters include or have included every Republican
President since Hoover, George Shultz, Caspar
Weinberger and George Bush. In addition, CEOs or
higher officials from over 40 of the largest 50 Fortune
500 industrial companies and from 20 of the nation's
25 largest banks are Bohemians.
Eight of the 20 Stanford faculty members who belong
to the Bohemian Club are affiliated with the Hoover
Institution, which qualifies as reactionary. Of the 28
Bohemian professors from UC-Berkeley, many have
nuclear weapons backgrounds.
A recent incident, as reported by The San Francisco
Examiner, illustrates the crude, reactionary instincts
of Bohemian Club members. After speaking at a Cham
ber of Commerce luncheon, Bohemian Club spokesper
son James Carter said that admitting women to the
club would be a "distraction" to club members, causing
them to suffer from chemical (hormonal) imbalances.
Carter said that an exception to this rule would be
someone like Jeanne Kirkpatrick, who presumably,
would not be a "distraction."
The writer concludes that the Bohemian Club is
"egalitarian in its camaraderie, activities and spirit."
For an institution as expensive, secretive and exclusive
as the Bohemian Club to portray itself as egalitarian
is not only unbelievable but adds a new muse to the
list of the arts supposedly patronized by the club: the
art of lying.
The question remains concerning the resources of
Stanford University being utilized to subsidize mem
berships for its male faculty in the Bohemian Club.
Surely we pay our professors enough to join truely
egalitarian organizations.
In other words, why should funds be taken from
worthwhile academic projects to be squandered on
the Bohemian Club, an organization that is in fact
elitist and reactionary and practices real, potential
discrimination against a major portion of this Univer
sity's student body, faculty and staff — the women of
Stanford?
Something tells us we won't be hearing the answer
to this question from the president of the Bohemian
Club.

A recent incident, as reported by The San Francisco
Examiner, illustrates the crude, reactionary instincts
of Bohemian Club members. After speaking at a Cham
ber of Commerce luncheon, Bohemian Club spokesper
son James Carter said that admitting women to the
club would be a "distraction" to club members, causing
them to suffer from chemical (hormonal) imbalances.
Carter said that an exception to this rule would be
someone like Jeanne Kirkpatrick, who presumably,
would not be a "distraction."
The writer concludes that the Bohemian Club is
"egalitarian in its camaraderie, activities and spirit."
For an institution as expensive, secretive and exclusive
as the Bohemian Club to portray itself as egalitarian
is not only unbelievable but adds a new muse to the
list of the arts supposedly patronized by the club: the
art of lying.
The question remains concerning the resources of
Stanford University being utilized to subsidize mem
berships for its male faculty in the Bohemian Club.
Surely we pay our professors enough to join truely
egalitarian organizations.
In other words, why should funds be taken from
worthwhile academic projects to be squandered on
the Bohemian Club, an organization that is in fact
elitist and reactionary and practices real, potential
discrimination against a major portion of this Univer
sity's student body, faculty and staff — the women of
Stanford?
Something tells us we won't be hearing the answer
to this question from the president of the Bohemian
Club.
Mike Conan is the president of United Stanford Workers.
