## Police out of line in campus bust 
### 
I would like to respond to the behavior and
procedures used by the Stanford Police Depart
ment at an ATO party last Saturday night, Jan.
23. The police, in a less than congenial manner,
failed to follow proper procedures in handling
the party, ignoring the information which they
themselves ask house officers to provide.

Scott Coors

As ATO house manager, I am responsible
for any infractions and disturbances at any time,
especially during parties. For this reason, I am
always extremely diligent in following all Uni
versity guidelines with respect to parties. The
University expects party hosts to register with
the Stanford Police (a detail which I doubt is
widely practiced) and to adhere to the Stanford
Alcohol Policy.
I informed the police of our proposed party
on Saturday afternoon, leaving my name and
phone number as a police contact in case of
problems. Only students with Stanford IDs were
allowed into the party, as enforced by monitors
at the front door — all other doors were locked
for security.
Around 12:15 a.m. a resident alerted me to
the fact that someone, notably a police officer,
was scaling the outer wall of our courtyard to
gain access to our party, even though the front
doors were wide open. He then opened the side
courtyard door from the inside to let four more
officers in.
Once inside, the sergeant informed me that
there had been several noise complaints from
some of our faculty neighbors. To this I
apologized and immediately asked the (indoor)
band to cut the volume in half and close the
dining room windows.
When I returned, I was greeted with a ques
tion about who was drinking alcohol and replied
that we had carded everyone at the door for a
Stanford ID. The sergeant then said that wasn't
"good enough" and that he was fully capable
of placing me under arrest for providing alcohol

to minors, stating he "could probably bust 25
people here for minor possession" if he wanted
to. I immediately told the beer servers to begin
carding for 21 while he proceeded to demand
identification from two nearby beer-drinking stu
dents who were, incidentally, over 21.
As to the content of these comments, I would
like to say that the sergeant was totally in the
right. Yes, it is California law that all drinkers
must be over 21, and yes this law should be
enforced. Whether or not the law is fair is not
the question — it is his job to enforce the law
as it stands and that's what he was trying to
do. Enforcing laws on the Stanford campus is
not a fun (or easy) task. I thoroughly appreciate
and commend the good job the Stanford Police
routinely performs. Here he was right — I was
clearly at fault.

The belligerent attitude with which the sergeant
approached me was thoroughly uncalled for. I was
making every effort to be calm and cooperative in the
situation, an effort which seemed to go unnoticed
except for the apparent embarasssment of one of the
officers over the sergeant's behavior.

The belligerent attitude with which the ser
geant approached me was thoroughly uncalled
for, however. I was making every effort to be
calm and cooperative in the situation — an
effort which seemed to go unnoticed cxcept for
the apparent embarrassment of one of the of
ficers over the sergeant's behavior. The sergeant
stated, more in the form of a controlled yell,
that he was "sick and tired of this attitude"
college students have toward underage drinking.
While perfectly justified and understandable,
this attack was inappropriately aimed directly
at me. It made me wonder if ATO was being
"made an example of and put serious question
into my mind about whether the noise complaints

(for which I sincerely apologize) were the only
reason the police appeared 45 minutes before
the University's specified weekend quiet hour
of 1 a.m. I will readily agree that I was in the
wrong; however, I don't appreciate ATO being
treated like the first place ever to have thrown
a party on the Stanford campus.
My second and most important concern is
over the fact that the police failed to go through
proper channels in handling the situation. They
told me they received general noise complaints,
"heard there was something going on at ATO"
and came over to check it out. Did anyone
bother to call the number I had provided them?
No, my answering machine had no messages,
not even empty (dial tone) ones. Did they at
tempt to find out who was in charge before
coming over? No, I had to repeat my name

three times to them. And, to top it all off, did
they even bother to use the front door? No,
they scaled the wall as if to imply that some
sort of raid was going on. I also wonder why
five officers were required to handle a routine
noise complaint.
All I can say is that I used all the proper
channels in organizing things so I would be
easily accessible in the event of problems. I
would have expected the police department to
at least give me the common courtesy of going
through the proper channels in their procedures
as well.

the question — it is his job to enforce the law
as it stands and that's what he was trying to
do. Enforcing laws on the Stanford campus is
not a fun (or easy) task. I thoroughly appreciate
and commend the good job the Stanford Police
routinely performs. Here he was right — I was
clearly at fault.

The belligerent attitude with which the sergeant
approached me was thoroughly uncalled for. I was
making every effort to be calm and cooperative in the
situation, an effort which seemed to go unnoticed
except for the apparent embarasssment of one of the
officers over the sergeant's behavior.

The belligerent attitude with which the ser
geant approached me was thoroughly uncalled
for, however. I was making every effort to be
calm and cooperative in the situation — an
effort which seemed to go unnoticed cxcept for
the apparent embarrassment of one of the of
ficers over the sergeant's behavior. The sergeant
stated, more in the form of a controlled yell,
that he was "sick and tired of this attitude"
college students have toward underage drinking.
While perfectly justified and understandable,
this attack was inappropriately aimed directly
at me. It made me wonder if ATO was being
"made an example of and put serious question
into my mind about whether the noise complaints

(for which I sincerely apologize) were the only
reason the police appeared 45 minutes before
the University's specified weekend quiet hour
of 1 a.m. I will readily agree that I was in the
wrong; however, I don't appreciate ATO being
treated like the first place ever to have thrown
a party on the Stanford campus.
My second and most important concern is
over the fact that the police failed to go through
proper channels in handling the situation. They
told me they received general noise complaints,
"heard there was something going on at ATO"
and came over to check it out. Did anyone
bother to call the number I had provided them?
No, my answering machine had no messages,
not even empty (dial tone) ones. Did they at
tempt to find out who was in charge before
coming over? No, I had to repeat my name

three times to them. And, to top it all off, did
they even bother to use the front door? No,
they scaled the wall as if to imply that some
sort of raid was going on. I also wonder why
five officers were required to handle a routine
noise complaint.
All I can say is that I used all the proper
channels in organizing things so I would be
easily accessible in the event of problems. I
would have expected the police department to
at least give me the common courtesy of going
through the proper channels in their procedures
as well.

I would like to respond to the behavior and
procedures used by the Stanford Police Depart
ment at an ATO party last Saturday night, Jan.
23. The police, in a less than congenial manner,
failed to follow proper procedures in handling
the party, ignoring the information which they
themselves ask house officers to provide.

Scott Coors

As ATO house manager, I am responsible
for any infractions and disturbances at any time,
especially during parties. For this reason, I am
always extremely diligent in following all Uni
versity guidelines with respect to parties. The
University expects party hosts to register with
the Stanford Police (a detail which I doubt is
widely practiced) and to adhere to the Stanford
Alcohol Policy.
I informed the police of our proposed party
on Saturday afternoon, leaving my name and
phone number as a police contact in case of
problems. Only students with Stanford IDs were
allowed into the party, as enforced by monitors
at the front door — all other doors were locked
for security.
Around 12:15 a.m. a resident alerted me to
the fact that someone, notably a police officer,
was scaling the outer wall of our courtyard to
gain access to our party, even though the front
doors were wide open. He then opened the side
courtyard door from the inside to let four more
officers in.
Once inside, the sergeant informed me that
there had been several noise complaints from
some of our faculty neighbors. To this I
apologized and immediately asked the (indoor)
band to cut the volume in half and close the
dining room windows.
When I returned, I was greeted with a ques
tion about who was drinking alcohol and replied
that we had carded everyone at the door for a
Stanford ID. The sergeant then said that wasn't
"good enough" and that he was fully capable
of placing me under arrest for providing alcohol

to minors, stating he "could probably bust 25
people here for minor possession" if he wanted
to. I immediately told the beer servers to begin
carding for 21 while he proceeded to demand
identification from two nearby beer-drinking stu
dents who were, incidentally, over 21.
As to the content of these comments, I would
like to say that the sergeant was totally in the
right. Yes, it is California law that all drinkers
must be over 21, and yes this law should be
enforced. Whether or not the law is fair is not
the question — it is his job to enforce the law
as it stands and that's what he was trying to
do. Enforcing laws on the Stanford campus is
not a fun (or easy) task. I thoroughly appreciate
and commend the good job the Stanford Police
routinely performs. Here he was right — I was
