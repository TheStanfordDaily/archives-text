# University may intervene
## IFC rejects dry Rush 
### Sean Kinch Staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council last
night rejected a proposal by one of
its committees to ban alcohol from
open Rush parties, prompting Uni
versity officials to say that fraterni
ties may be required to have dry
Rush parties anyway.
The IFC Rush committee urged
that no alcohol be served "at any
time during official IFC Rush hours
at the official IFC Rush open
houses" and advised "extra caution"
at the weekend parties.
But the full council decided that
the Rush alcohol policy will remain
unchanged from last year: Beer and
wine can be served during the first
week of Rush, no alcohol during
the afternoon parties of the second
week, and any alcohol can be served
during the last week.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said he "certainly doesn't
think it's a good decision" and
added that it is "possible" that the
University will overrule it. "If the
risks (of Rush with alcohol) are
higher than the community is will
ing to take, then the University will
have to step in,"he said.
IFC President Vinny Frost said
he docs not think Lyons will make
a "knee-jerk reaction" to the IFC
decision. Frost predicted instead
that Lyons "will consider that the
situation has been deliberated

properly."
Lyons said he plans to discuss
the situation with other Stanford
officials and may speak to the full
IFC before making a decision.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said he was "disappointed"
with the IFC decision. "It was made
for all the wrong reasons." he said.
"If the statistics showed that al
cohol helped the Rush process,
then I could understand the deci
sion, but that isn't the case," Pisano
said. "It's hard for me to see the
other side of the argument because
I am so in favor" of a dry Rush.
Diana Conklin, associate dean of
Residential Education and director
of the Row, said it is "regrettable"
that the fraternities "didn't take the
opportunity to take a step forward
... toward reducing alcohol as a
focus" of Rush.
Furthermore, Conklin said it is
"just folly to have large parties with
large amounts of alcohol with un
derage drinkers, especially during
Rush â€” there is a real risk invol
ved."
The IFC also decided at the
meeting not to issue Rush cards
this year. Instead, each rushee will
be required to show University
identification and sign a guest book
at each party.
Although the vote was strongly
in favor of allowing alcohol at Rush
functions, there was some vocal sup
port for the Rush committee's pro

posal.
Rene Lacerte, president of Sigma
Alpha Mu fraternity, said he "did
not think the arguments in favor of
a wet Rush are sound." Lacerte
said Rush "should work" without
alcohol and that fraternities just
need to be more "creative."
After the meeting, Frost said
keeping a wet Rush "may be short
sighted," but added that "informed
decisions have been made."
Frost pledged that the IFC Rush
and executive committees "will take
a more active role in the enfor
cement" of Rush guidelines.
Pisano said University officials
have not established a Rush policy
for fraternities because the frater
nities should have the "freedom"
to govern themselves. He added
that fraternities are more likely to
comply with a policy that they
agreed upon.
In a Nov. 3 interview with KZSU
and The Daily, Lyons said a Uni
versity decision requiring a dry
Rush "was in the cards," but that
he hoped the IFC would make the
decision itself. He said Rush
guidelines would not change until
"the IFC gets up the courage to
have a dry Rush."
"If fraternities are hell-bent on
shooting themselves in the foot,
then there is a limit to what we
can do to stop them," Lyons said
last night.
