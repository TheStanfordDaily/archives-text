## Though they may be justifiable.... Salaries soak up most of the ASSU's fortune 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
This is the second in a series on the
finances of the ASSU.

If the ASSU were a corporation
attempting to make a profit, any
money it made could be divided
among the stockholders. Since the
ASSU is a non-profit organization,
though, it must spend any money
it makes. To that end, the ASSU
plans to spend $381,676 in the 1987-
88 school year.
The question is, though, where
will the money go?
Over 50 percent of the current
budget is spent on salaries, with a
fairly substantial 19 percent ear
marked for student salaries.
Included in this $73,000 are the
salaries of the Council of Presi
dents, the chairman of the ASSU
Senate, the financial manager and
various staff and committee posi
tions.
Some of the salaries for the
school year are the following: Coun
cil of Presidents members, $4500
each; chair of the senate, $4500;
financial manager, $5800; adminis
trative manager, $4000; and
Nominations Commission chair,

$950.
Many officeholders receive a
summer salary in addition to what
they earn during the school year.
For example, the financial manager
earns $3200, the COP members
$500, the chair of the senate $1000,
and the administrative manager
$500.
"Last year there was a salary
review committee which cut the fi
nancial manager salary from
$12,000 to $9000 because it was felt
that was out of line with the other
salaries," said COP member
Leonard Adler. "As well, the other
salaries were cut a little."
Adler justified his salary by
noting that he works 20 hours a
week in the office, 20 hours a week
outside the office and attends the
bi-weekly ASSU Senate meetings.
He said his salary averages less than
$4 an hour, as compared to the
University's minimum wage of $5.80
an hour.
"Because of the phenomenal
amount of time they (salaried stu
dents) spend, they need to get
recompense," said Senate Chair
Dave Smolen.
The chair's position is important
because "you need someone to pick
committee members, to preside

over meetings, to prepare an
agenda and to serve as liaison be
tween the University and the
senate," he said.
Another $126,000, or 32 percent
of the operating budget, is set aside
for the salaries of non-student office
personnel. A large portion of this
sum, $98,000, is funded by the Uni
versity.

The main duties of the office staff
involve the management of the
ASSU banking service for student
groups.
The University allocates money
to the ASSU to help provide ser
vices like lifeguards for the Boat
house and funding for student in

volvement on University commit
tees. The justification is, "If the
ASSU did not exist, we would feel
obligated to provide [these ser
vices]," said Margaret Fidler, asso
ciate dean for Student Affairs.
Additionally, the ASSU spends
$21,000 a year on student elections.
Despite the decision this year to
lease automatic voting machines,
the ASSU will not go over this
budgeted amount, Adler predicted.
Although an initial outlay of
$5300 was required to obtain the
machines and to do the computer
programming necessary to run
them, Elections Commission Chair
Steve Baer said the commission will
probably come in under budget this
year.
Baer said this was possible be
cause with the new machines, "We
are spending (the money) in differ
ent ways." He added that this will
decrease the overall cost of running
the elections.
The ASSU's $1.5 million reserve
fund also contributes to the oper
ating budget. According to
Vivienne Huang, ASSU financial
manager, in the past senators have
been reluctant to spend any of the
reserves because of misperceptions
about the purpose of the fund.

As a result, Huang said the fund
was split into five categories in an
effort to clarify how it is to be used.
The categories are special discre
tionary funding, annual discretion
ary funding, protection against busi
ness projects losing money, protec
tion against spending over the
amount provided by the operating
budget and income smoothing.
The special discretionary fund
contains money intended for major
capital expenditures such as last
year's $85,000 renovation of the
ASSU offices.
Although the special discretion
ary fund will probably not be dipped
into every year, it is available and
sets aside a portion of the reserve
fund that the senate can safely
spend.
The special fund also generates
interest, and this interest generates
the annual discretionary fund. Ac
cording to Adler, the ASSU intends
to spend this money — ap
proxiamately $17,000 — each year.
This year, much of the money was
spent on the all-campus party, an
ASSU pamphlet (a document which
explains the workings of the ASSU)
and the new course guide.
The income-smoothing portion of
the reserve fund is designed to fill

any gap between projected income
and actual income. For instance,
the ASSU operating budget
predicts a profit of $46,475 from
short-term investments. If the ac
tual profit at the end of the year
were only $30,000, then the remain
ing $16,475 would come out of in
come smoothing.

'Because of the
phenomenal amount
of time they
(salaried students)
spend, they need to
get recompense.'
— Dave Smolen

The rest of the operating budget
covers expenses such as office op
erating costs, service programs and
facilities improvements. Just over
$40,000 of the total budget will
cover the budgets for programs like
the ASSU News, the straw poll and
advertising.

Over 50 percent of the current
budget is spent on salaries, with a
fairly substantial 19 percent ear
marked for student salaries.
Included in this $73,000 are the
salaries of the Council of Presi
dents, the chairman of the ASSU
Senate, the financial manager and
various staff and committee posi
tions.
Some of the salaries for the
school year are the following: Coun
cil of Presidents members, $4500
each; chair of the senate, $4500;
financial manager, $5800; adminis
trative manager, $4000; and
Nominations Commission chair,

$950.
Many officeholders receive a
summer salary in addition to what
they earn during the school year.
For example, the financial manager
earns $3200, the COP members
$500, the chair of the senate $1000,
and the administrative manager
$500.
"Last year there was a salary
review committee which cut the fi
nancial manager salary from
$12,000 to $9000 because it was felt
that was out of line with the other
salaries," said COP member
Leonard Adler. "As well, the other
salaries were cut a little."
Adler justified his salary by
noting that he works 20 hours a
week in the office, 20 hours a week
outside the office and attends the
bi-weekly ASSU Senate meetings.
He said his salary averages less than
$4 an hour, as compared to the
University's minimum wage of $5.80
an hour.
"Because of the phenomenal
amount of time they (salaried stu
dents) spend, they need to get
recompense," said Senate Chair
Dave Smolen.
The chair's position is important
because "you need someone to pick
committee members, to preside

over meetings, to prepare an
agenda and to serve as liaison be
tween the University and the
senate," he said.
Another $126,000, or 32 percent
of the operating budget, is set aside
for the salaries of non-student office
personnel. A large portion of this
sum, $98,000, is funded by the Uni
versity.

The main duties of the office staff
involve the management of the
ASSU banking service for student
groups.
The University allocates money
to the ASSU to help provide ser
vices like lifeguards for the Boat
house and funding for student in

volvement on University commit
tees. The justification is, "If the
ASSU did not exist, we would feel
obligated to provide [these ser
vices]," said Margaret Fidler, asso
ciate dean for Student Affairs.
Additionally, the ASSU spends
$21,000 a year on student elections.
Despite the decision this year to
lease automatic voting machines,
the ASSU will not go over this
budgeted amount, Adler predicted.
Although an initial outlay of
$5300 was required to obtain the
machines and to do the computer
programming necessary to run
them, Elections Commission Chair
Steve Baer said the commission will
probably come in under budget this
year.
Baer said this was possible be
cause with the new machines, "We
are spending (the money) in differ
ent ways." He added that this will
decrease the overall cost of running
the elections.
The ASSU's $1.5 million reserve
fund also contributes to the oper
ating budget. According to
Vivienne Huang, ASSU financial
manager, in the past senators have
been reluctant to spend any of the
reserves because of misperceptions
about the purpose of the fund.

As a result, Huang said the fund
was split into five categories in an
effort to clarify how it is to be used.
The categories are special discre
tionary funding, annual discretion
ary funding, protection against busi
ness projects losing money, protec
tion against spending over the
amount provided by the operating
budget and income smoothing.
The special discretionary fund
contains money intended for major
capital expenditures such as last
year's $85,000 renovation of the
ASSU offices.
Although the special discretion
ary fund will probably not be dipped
into every year, it is available and
sets aside a portion of the reserve
fund that the senate can safely
spend.
The special fund also generates
interest, and this interest generates
the annual discretionary fund. Ac
cording to Adler, the ASSU intends
to spend this money — ap
proxiamately $17,000 — each year.
This year, much of the money was
spent on the all-campus party, an
ASSU pamphlet (a document which
explains the workings of the ASSU)
and the new course guide.
The income-smoothing portion of
the reserve fund is designed to fill

any gap between projected income
and actual income. For instance,
the ASSU operating budget
predicts a profit of $46,475 from
short-term investments. If the ac
tual profit at the end of the year
were only $30,000, then the remain
ing $16,475 would come out of in
come smoothing.

phenomenal amount
of time they
(salaried students)
spend, they need to
get recompense.'

The rest of the operating budget
covers expenses such as office op
erating costs, service programs and
facilities improvements. Just over
$40,000 of the total budget will
cover the budgets for programs like
the ASSU News, the straw poll and
advertising.
This is the second in a series on the
finances of the ASSU.

If the ASSU were a corporation
attempting to make a profit, any
money it made could be divided
among the stockholders. Since the
ASSU is a non-profit organization,
though, it must spend any money
it makes. To that end, the ASSU
plans to spend $381,676 in the 1987-
88 school year.
The question is, though, where
will the money go?
Over 50 percent of the current
budget is spent on salaries, with a
fairly substantial 19 percent ear
