# Selling your Macintosh is a no-win scenario
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Last week, this column discussed
the possibility of upgrading older
Macintoshes to the level of the
Macintosh 512K Enhanced. The
problem with following this route,
as mentioned before, is that it will
hardly bring you to the forefront
of Macintosh technology.
The question then becomes:
What other options are available?

Unfortunately, more comprehen
sive upgrades than the 512K
Enchanced are not the answer. The
reason is that the Macintosh SE, a
machine which bears superficial
resemblance to its predecessors, is
so unlike the machines before it
that Apple was unable to offer an
upgrade — at any price.
There are ways to improve the
Macintosh 512K Enhanced and
older machines. If you buy genuine
Apple upgrades to bring the com
puter up to the level of the Mac
Plus, you can then add additional
memory from a third-party manu
facturer and run all the software
currently available.
But all of this can cost a great
deal of money — over $1000 in
some circumstances — and there
fore may not be worthwhile. The
obvious alternative is to sell your
current Mac and start again with a
new machine.

Even here you will run into trou
ble, however. The first stumbling
block is Microdisc policy. If you
bought your computer through
Microdisc you cannot sell it for one
year after the purchase date. More
importantly, you cannot buy a new
computer for two years.
In a nutshell, if you bought a
Macintosh 512K Enhanced in Sep
tember 1986, and you want a new
Mac you're out of luck.
But it gets worse. Let's say you've
waited the two years and are eligi
ble to buy a new computer. Who
do you sell your old one to? Don't
even think of selling it on campus.
If you try to, not only will you have
to discount the computer for
depreciation, you'll be discounting
off Microdisc's bargain basement
prices.
Example: If you bought a Mac
Plus for $1300 from Microdisc a
year ago, it might only be worth
$900 to a Stanford student today
because he or she can get a new
one for less than you paid a year
ago. But in the real world the Mac
Plus still retails for over $1500, so
you might be able to get $1200 by
selling it outside of Stanford.
If you succeed in selling this Mac
Plus you might be tempted to pur
chase a Macintosh SE with a hard
disk drive — that machine is Ap
ple's current best seller. To get it
will cost you, though. By the time
you add in the cost of the keyboard
(which is no longer included with
the machine), the tax and the
Microsdisc handling fee, the Mac
SE will cost about $2200.
Once again, it's $1000 for the
upgrade. If you use your Mac for
little other than word processing
this is certainly not worth the cost.
However, as noted in last week's

column, the upgrade to the 512K
Enhanced is worth it for just about
anyone who can afford it. Be
forewarned, though, time may be
running out. The rumor on the
street is that Apple may not
manufacture this upgrade in the fu
ture. So, if you're going to do it,
do it soon.

On the other hand there are the
Macintosh users out there who want
the top of the line complete with
all the bells and whistles — and
are willing to pay for it, no matter
what it costs.
For those users, there are only
two options available: the Macin
tosh SE and the Macintosh 11. But
like those working with low end
machines, these so-called "power
users" have confusing choices, too.
The Macintosh SE can run every
program ever written for the Mac
that doesn't use color (and even
some that do, though the machine
won't display the colors on the
screen).
The Macintosh II is much more
expandable than the SE, can
produce some mind-boggling colors,
runs much faster than the SE, and
when the Mac 111 comes out a year
from now, Mac II owners should
be able to upgrade fairly easily.
The Mac II does not run some
older programs, but almost every
software company — including Ap
ple spinoff Claris — has upgraded
its applications to run on the Mac
11.
The mid-level power user may
not need the Macintosh ll's speed
or expandability yet, but may want
to consider the machine anyway.
Why? The latest Apple rumor that

is circulating says that in January
1988 Apple will announce the Mac
intosh 111. The Macintosh II will
drop in price, and the SE and the
Plus will be discontinued. If that is
true, the original, monitor-in-the
box Macintosh will be gone for
good.
But the rumor is not likely to
come true, for one reason. Since
even the cheapest Mac is much
more expensive than the typical
IBM clone, many people are
clamoring for a low-end Macintosh.
Such a machine would attract the
first-time buyer who might want a
more powerful machine later.
If the Mac 111 does come out
next year at a price only slightly

higher than the current Mac 11, the
price of the SE (or th,e Plus, though
it's doubtful it will still be manufac
tured by then) could be slashed
considerably. Then the SE could
be the low-end Macintosh.
It would be nowhere near as in
expensive as a $400 IBM clone, but
it could come in near the $1000
mark and satisfy a number of
people.
Of course, the biggest catch of
all is that much of this is specula
tion. Apple never announces new
machines until they are released
because they don't want to kill the
sales of any current machines that
might become obsolete.

This means that upgrade seekers
are in limbo until 1988 at the ear
liest. The most sound recommen
dations are the following: Get your
machine up to the level of at least
the 512K Enhanced because Apple
no longer supports anything older.
If you want to run Multifinder,
which allows you to use two pro
grams at the same time, give your
machine at least two megabytes of
memory.
Beyond that, if you can hold off
for a while, do so. Your current
machine will depreciate, but at least
you won't be stuck replacing your
computer with a new one only to
find that the new one is already
obsolete.

But the rumor is not likely to
come true, for one reason. Since
even the cheapest Mac is much
more expensive than the typical
IBM clone, many people are
clamoring for a low-end Macintosh.
Such a machine would attract the
first-time buyer who might want a
more powerful machine later.
If the Mac 111 does come out
next year at a price only slightly

higher than the current Mac 11, the
price of the SE (or th,e Plus, though
it's doubtful it will still be manufac
tured by then) could be slashed
considerably. Then the SE could
be the low-end Macintosh.
It would be nowhere near as in
expensive as a $400 IBM clone, but
it could come in near the $1000
mark and satisfy a number of
people.
Of course, the biggest catch of
all is that much of this is specula
tion. Apple never announces new
machines until they are released
because they don't want to kill the
sales of any current machines that
might become obsolete.

This means that upgrade seekers
are in limbo until 1988 at the ear
liest. The most sound recommen
dations are the following: Get your
machine up to the level of at least
the 512K Enhanced because Apple
no longer supports anything older.
If you want to run Multifinder,
which allows you to use two pro
grams at the same time, give your
machine at least two megabytes of
memory.
Beyond that, if you can hold off
for a while, do so. Your current
machine will depreciate, but at least
you won't be stuck replacing your
computer with a new one only to
find that the new one is already
obsolete.


Last week, this column discussed
the possibility of upgrading older
Macintoshes to the level of the
Macintosh 512K Enhanced. The
problem with following this route,
as mentioned before, is that it will
hardly bring you to the forefront
of Macintosh technology.
The question then becomes:
What other options are available?

Unfortunately, more comprehen
sive upgrades than the 512K
Enchanced are not the answer. The
reason is that the Macintosh SE, a
machine which bears superficial
resemblance to its predecessors, is
so unlike the machines before it
that Apple was unable to offer an
upgrade — at any price.
There are ways to improve the
Macintosh 512K Enhanced and
older machines. If you buy genuine
Apple upgrades to bring the com
puter up to the level of the Mac
Plus, you can then add additional
memory from a third-party manu
facturer and run all the software
currently available.
But all of this can cost a great
deal of money — over $1000 in
some circumstances — and there
fore may not be worthwhile. The
obvious alternative is to sell your
current Mac and start again with a
new machine.

Even here you will run into trou
ble, however. The first stumbling
block is Microdisc policy. If you
bought your computer through
Microdisc you cannot sell it for one
year after the purchase date. More
importantly, you cannot buy a new
computer for two years.
In a nutshell, if you bought a
Macintosh 512K Enhanced in Sep
tember 1986, and you want a new
Mac you're out of luck.
But it gets worse. Let's say you've
waited the two years and are eligi
ble to buy a new computer. Who
do you sell your old one to? Don't
even think of selling it on campus.
If you try to, not only will you have
to discount the computer for
depreciation, you'll be discounting
off Microdisc's bargain basement
prices.
Example: If you bought a Mac
Plus for $1300 from Microdisc a
year ago, it might only be worth
$900 to a Stanford student today
because he or she can get a new
one for less than you paid a year
ago. But in the real world the Mac
Plus still retails for over $1500, so
you might be able to get $1200 by
selling it outside of Stanford.
If you succeed in selling this Mac
Plus you might be tempted to pur
chase a Macintosh SE with a hard
disk drive — that machine is Ap
ple's current best seller. To get it
will cost you, though. By the time
you add in the cost of the keyboard
(which is no longer included with
the machine), the tax and the
Microsdisc handling fee, the Mac
SE will cost about $2200.
Once again, it's $1000 for the
upgrade. If you use your Mac for
little other than word processing
this is certainly not worth the cost.
However, as noted in last week's

column, the upgrade to the 512K
Enhanced is worth it for just about
anyone who can afford it. Be
forewarned, though, time may be
running out. The rumor on the
street is that Apple may not
manufacture this upgrade in the fu
ture. So, if you're going to do it,
do it soon.

On the other hand there are the
Macintosh users out there who want
the top of the line complete with
all the bells and whistles — and
are willing to pay for it, no matter
what it costs.
For those users, there are only
two options available: the Macin
tosh SE and the Macintosh 11. But
like those working with low end
machines, these so-called "power
users" have confusing choices, too.
The Macintosh SE can run every
program ever written for the Mac
that doesn't use color (and even
some that do, though the machine
won't display the colors on the
screen).
The Macintosh II is much more
expandable than the SE, can
produce some mind-boggling colors,
runs much faster than the SE, and
when the Mac 111 comes out a year
from now, Mac II owners should
be able to upgrade fairly easily.
The Mac II does not run some
older programs, but almost every
software company — including Ap
ple spinoff Claris — has upgraded
its applications to run on the Mac
11.
The mid-level power user may
not need the Macintosh ll's speed
or expandability yet, but may want
to consider the machine anyway.
Why? The latest Apple rumor that

is circulating says that in January
1988 Apple will announce the Mac
intosh 111. The Macintosh II will
drop in price, and the SE and the
Plus will be discontinued. If that is
true, the original, monitor-in-the
box Macintosh will be gone for
good.
But the rumor is not likely to
come true, for one reason. Since
even the cheapest Mac is much
more expensive than the typical
IBM clone, many people are
clamoring for a low-end Macintosh.
