## Cafe brings France to Foothills 
### Bruce Brown Clara Wu 
Nina's Cafe
2991 Woodside Road, Woodside
851-4565
Located not more than 10
minutes from Stanford, on Wood
side Road west of Highway 280,
there is a small dining room with
10 tables, a fireplace, fresh bou
quets and fine French food.
It is called Nina's Cafe, and
though it sits over 6000 miles from
the Left Bank, one evening there
may convince you that France lives
in the Foothills of Northern Cali
fornia.
Jean Cornil, a native of Vichy,
is the chef at Nina's. Trained in
France, he arrived in the United
States in the early 19705. His first
venture in the Bay Area was Le
Pot au Feu, located in Menlo Park,
and Nina's Cafe has been in his
hands for about five years. (Cornil
has since sold Le Pot au Feu and
opened another restaurant in
Mountain View.)
The fare at Nina's is traditional
French, lightened by a touch of
nouvelle California cuisine. The
menu is arranged daily and takes
advantage of the freshest seasonal
offerings. Dinner at Nina's presents
a choice of several appetizers, an
entree that includes soup or salad,
and a splendid dessert tray.
To begin, we chose New Zealand
mussels broiled with garlic butter
and parmesan cheese, and the pate
du chef with peppercorns and
juniper berries. If mussels are
prepared unimaginatively, eating
them can be like swallowing
goldfish; at Nina's, however, they

are a treat, well-seasoned and
tender.
The pate, unusually spicy, is a
welcome respite from the typical
liver-dominated variety. Served
with cornichons, or cherkins, im
ported from France and eaten with
fresh rolls, it makes for a delightful
prelude to the main course.
The soup of the day was cream
of leek, and laced with a twist of
spinach it was as aesthetically pleas
ing as it was gastronomically satis
fying. It arrived steaming and sat
well on this winter's night. The
salade maison is straightforward,
topped with sunflower seeds and a
creamy house dressing.
We chose from among four
seafood specialties and three
meat/poultry dishes for our entrees.
Mahi-mahi, blackened in cajun
spices, manifests the nouvelle twist
to Nina's fare. The fish was meaty,
broiled to perfection and glazed
lightly to draw out its flavors. What
it lacked were the heavy sauces as
sociated with most schools of
French cooking.
A sauce base did appear,
however, with the milk-fed veal,
cooked in broth with mushrooms,
artichoke hearts and crumbled blue
cheese. The veal was succesfully
prepared but did not quite measure
up to the excellence of the mahi
mahi. Sweet yam puree and fresh
string beans accompanied both
entrees and balanced the stronger
tastes of the main dishes.
The expectation of dessert in
French restaurants sits at the core
of Western myth, and Nina's did
not disappoint in this sacred cul
tural role. The dessert cart was a
landscape of fresh quiches,

homebaked tarts, lemon meringue
pie and, of course, the obligatory
Napoleon.
The absence of chocolate was
noticeable — nearly creating a
panic in this crew — but our dis
appointment was overcome by the
generous portions of apricot quiche
and apple cinnamon torte. The
desserts, while not excessively
sweet, were nicely enhanced by
creme anglaise. A fine finish
indeed.
With such an elaborate spread,
an empty wine glass would be crim
inal. We drank a Christophe
Sauvingon Blanc, a Napa label. It
was a fine choice from among a
somewhat limited list.
Wines at Nina's are mostly
Californian, with a few French rep
resentatives; obtaining a more ex
tensive wine collection would, we
would think, be a top priority for
a restaurant as sophisticated as this
one.

The ambiance at Nina's is
decidedly romantic. A wood fire
and soft lighting make winter dining
particularly charming. Our friendly
host Henri assured us that the ar
rival of the spring and summer
seasons at the cafe is also something
to which we can look forward — a
rear room, also used for regular
seating, is converted into an out
door patio.
Nina's is open for lunch and din
ner Tuesday through Saturday and
for brunch on Sundays. Dinner
entrees, which include soup or
salad, are about $15, a reasonable
cost for an evening escape.
A French philosopher of some
repute once boasted that the life
dealt is but "the best of all possible
worlds." At Nina's, the motto rings
less of Pangloss' fatalism than of a
unique culinary self-determinism.
As Henri remarked, "Here, any
thing is possible."
