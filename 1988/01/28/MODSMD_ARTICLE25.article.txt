# Bed, breakfast at intimate inn

### Helen Willey 
Most hotels are generic build
ings with sterile rooms, but the
Cowper Bed & Breakfast Inn in
Palo Alto is an exception to the
norm.
The inn â€” actually two houses
at 705 and 711 Cowper St.in
Palo Alto, has an unrushed, com
fortable home-like atmosphere
that can not be found in any
institutional "chain" hotel.
The reasonably priced rooms
cost from $50 to $70, less expen
sive than most luxury hotels in
the area.
The house is decorated in red
toned wood that panels the
ceiling and walls downstairs.
Warm colors of rose and colonial
blue highlight the interior. Clas
sic English furniture is placed
symmetrically around a large
brick fircplace.
The warmth and seclusion of
the inn convinced me to reserve
a room for the following Sunday
night.
Our $50 room turned out to
be the smallest in the house. It
was just large enough to fit a
bed, dresser and a bed-side
table. But there was no bath
room!
When I reserved the room, I
had not realized that a "shared
bathroom" meant a communal
bathroom for all those staying
on the second floor. Although

the second floor only consisted
of four rooms, we were disap
pointed with the situation.
We were envious of our neigh
bors across the hall who had
paid $10 more for a room triple
the size of ours with a connecting
bathroom.
Despite the smallness of our
room, its charm was undeniable.
Arrangements of red and blue
dried flowers matched the slate
blue print of the wallpaper and
a splendid Amish quilt lay spread
over the bed.
Included in our stay was
breakfast served in the small but
elegant dining room downstairs.
Silverware and crystal decorated
the table. Everyone who had
spent the night at the inn had
a place setting.
Peggy Woodworth, owner of
the inn, served us bananna muf
fins and coffee while we chatted
with the pleasant older couple
who had spent the night in the
room across the hall.
"It's definitely a family
business," said Woodworth's
daughter, Maria, who is a Stan
ford senior and works at the
house on weekends.
With the success of her busi
ness it does not look like the
inn will fold in the near future.
Peggy now has seven employees
to help her, including her two
daughters. "Most nights we are
full," she said,
