## Hoops hits halfway 
### 
When you don't have anything
to say, you lean back on the
barstool and look down at your
beer and maybe hope that it's
half full rather than half empty.
And as the Pac-10 and college
basketball season enters its mid
point weekend, let's hope the
second half will be better than
the middling play of the first half.

We haven't had a team we
could love or hate in the No. 1
spot. Instead, it has been
Arizona. Ho hum. USC Coach
George Raveling understands
with a yawn. "They're like an
Emily Post team, playing with
the proper on-court etiquette,"
he said.
If Arizona can defeat Arizona
State tonight and Illinois on Sat
urday, the Wildcats will most
likely breeze through their Pac
-10 foes and remain No. 1 for
the rest of the year. This must
be what it felt like when Calvin
Coolidge was president.
Back when ol' sleepy Cal
snoozed in the White House was
about the last time Stanford
made the NCAA tournament.
Actually, it was 1942.
Anyway, the Cardinal still has
a shot at the tourney this year.
Coach Mike Montgomery's team
has a 12-6, 4-3 record, with 11
Pac-10 games to go, not includ
ing the confcrcnce tournament.
If Stanford can swing a 7-4
record over that pre-tourney
span, then the odds arc better
than 50-50.
Two wildcards also exist. The
first is a Wildcat. If Stanford can
shut down Arizona's Sean Elliot
and upset the Wildcats here on
the Farm ... well .. . bonanza.
The national media almost ex

pects Arizona to go 18-0 in the
Pac-10. The team that beats the
Wildcats will receive mounds of
important exposure.
The second wildcard is the
Pac-10 tourney, which will be
held on Arizona's home floor in
McKale Center. Arizona will
win. But the team that gets hot
and faces Arizona in the cham
pionship game could supplant
the regular season second-place
team come NCAA berth-time.
Boy, those last few paragraphs
were pretty darn boring, huh?
Don't worry, just order another
beer because here comes the
juicy stuff.
Where are the Cowboys?
Wyoming has returned to
oblivion. A team that was a
preseason pick by many to be
No. 1 has lost too many and is
no longer in the rankings.
They've got the same guys as
last year, when they were fresh
and fun, so hopefully they will
return.
Wouldn't it be more fun if a
team that demolishes back
boards were No. 1? Pittsburgh
is fun to watch whether Jerome
Lane is remodeling rims,
Demetrius Gore is getting
sucker-punched by several
Georgetown Hoyas, or the
pubescent Charlie Chaplin-look
alike freshman Panther point
guard Scan Miller is dishing out
assists.
Four Big East teams have
quietly entered the top 20, but
they will be too busy beating
each other to move up in the
rankings. Ditto for the Big 10,
where Purdue, Michigan, lowa
and Illinois have left defending
national champion Indiana suck
ing wind.
Yet Indiana will rise from the
ashes and be in the hunt by
March. Bobby Knight may be
reeling now, but he's got more
horses than he did last season,
although he lacks the reign of
Steve Alford.
If Mr. Knight wins it, find me,
and I'll buy you a beer.
