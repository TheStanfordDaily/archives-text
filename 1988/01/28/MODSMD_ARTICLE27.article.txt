# Stanford guns for second place
## 
### Erik Sten Senior Staff writer 
About a third of the way into
the Pacific 10 Conference season
it's hard to imagine a much more
even league. Take away division
leading Arizona, make it the Pac-9
and a race for second, and at this
point anything could happen.
Behind the Wildcats, no less than
five of the Pac-10's teams are
knotted in the standings with three
losses apiece. Arizona State leads
the group with five wins; Stanford
and Washington State each have
four; and following right behind are
Oregon and Oregon State, which
having played only six games so far,
are both 3-3.
A lot of numbers, indeed. What
they work out to, however, is one
simple formula — this weekend's
road trip to Oregon could very well
make or break the Cardinal season.
Two wins would put Stanford
strongly in the race for second. A
couple of losses would put the Car
dinal in quite the proverbial hole.
"It's a very important road trip,"
Stanford small forward Brian
McSweeney said. "Winning two
games would establish us as the
second place team."
First stop for the Cardinal will
be Corvallis, where tonight it will
take on a small, quick Oregon State
team. The tallest starting Beaver
stands 6-foot-6; for that reason the
Cardinal will be looking to feed its
big men inside. Effective inside all
year (averaging 12.3 and 14.3 points
per game respectively), both start
ing center Greg Butler and power
forward Howard Wright should be
able to score once they get the ball.
The trick will be getting it to
them. To offset his team's lack of
size, Oregon State Coach Ralph
Miller has installed a pressure
defense, the aim of which is to keep
the ball away from the opposing
team's big men. With a lightning
quick pair of guards in Eric Knox
and Gary Payton, that strategy has
worked well for the Beavers.
Good ball-handling and passing,

Stanford's 6-foot-ll center Greg Butler will play a key role in tonight's game at Oregon State — none of the
Beaver starters are taller than 6-6.
