# Defense a Card strength
## 
### Chris Myers Editorial staff 
With Stanford's relatively inexpe
rienced pitching staff facing the of
ten fearsome batting orders in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Di
vision (and in a rugged non-league
schedule), the Cardinal's defense
will figure prominently in the team's
campaign to retain its NCAA base
ball championship.
When Stanford, ranked second
nationally in both major preseason
polls, opens play at 2 p.m. Friday
at Sunken Diamond against Santa
Clara, five of the eight starting po
sition players from last year's cham
pionship team will be back.
The Cardinal will probably not
experience any drop-off in the play
of its infield, where sophomore
shortstop Troy Paulsen will step
into the only vacancy.
But all eyes will be trained on
the outfield, where new starters will
try to fill the winged shoes of center
fielder Toi Cook and left-fielder
Ruben Amaro, both of whom
graduated.
Cook and Amaro not only were
the team's offensive sparkplugs last
year, but were also invaluable on
defense, running dow-n a lot of balls
in the gaps that mjght otherwise
have gone for extra bases.
In fact, for several years Stanford
has had an outfield that could help
pitchers out by running under their
mistakes. Two years ago, Cook
played right and was joined in the
outfield by fellow speed merchants
Mark Davis in center and Walt Har

ris in left.
"We've been spoiled a little bit
in the past," junior second baseman
Frank Carey said of the outfield's
play. "I would have to say that's a
question (this year)... . It's not
really fair to compare, but we have
some really good athletes.... we're
still going to be OK."
In fact, the left field spot will be
filled by the best athlete on the
team, sophomore Brian Johnson.
Johnson a three-time California
High School Athlete of the Year
and the starting quarterback for the
Stanford football team for most of
last season, saw only limited action
on the diamond in 1987, playing a
variety of positions, including third
base, left field, designated hitter
and (for one-and-two-thirds in
nings) pitcher.
"Brian has earned a chance to
start," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "He sat last year,
and learned a lot. Everyone said,
'What's wrong with Brian Johnson?'
Well, nothing was wrong with Brian
Johnson. In most cases, it takes a
freshman a year — especially when
you come to a good program — to
adjust to better pitching."
So far, Johnson's play in left has
impressed Marquess. "He surpris
ingly has played very well defen
sively He's doing a good job
there," he said.
If Johnson falters, junior Scott
Delucchi will spell him.
Center field is less settled. Junior
Eric DeGraw and junior college
transfer Jack Hollis are the leading
candidates for the starting spot.

Whoever starts, he will be the fast
est person in the lineup and will
be valuable not only in the field
but also in the otherwise lead
footed batting order. DeGraw was
used some as a pinch runner last
year and is described by Marquess
as a "a good defensive center
fielder" and"the best base runner
on the team."
Hollis transferred from Los An
geles Harbor Junior College, where
he hit .387 last year with eight home
runs and 30 stolen bases.
"He's real similar to Eric
(DeGraw)," Marquess said. "He
can run, play some good center
field, steal bases, but has good
power, too."
Marquess said that DeGraw and
Hollis will probably alternate starts
in center for the tirst 10 or 15
games of the year.
Waiting in the wings are two
promising and speedy freshmen,
Mike Eicher from San Diego and
Albert Richardson from Hanford.
The only other ncwcomcr to the
starting lineup is Paulsen. He was
in a battle for the starting shortstop
spot last year before suffering a
knee injury Feb. 21. Up to that
point he had played in nine games,
starting six and batting .379 with a
home run, three doubles and 10
RBIs.
He underwent reconstructive sur
gery in March and is now fully
recovered from the injury, although
he continues to wear a brace that
Marquess said doesn't restrict his
movement. "He'll be better than he
was before the injury," Marquess

said.
Returnees fill the rest of the
starting lineup:
• Catcher: Senior Doug Robbins is
the best-kept secret on the Stanford
team. "I love him back there — he
doesn't a lot but he's so con
sistent," pitching coach Tom Dun
lon SR'd. 'Tie catches everything!

blocks everything. .. . He's really
underrated."
"He's a great defensive catcher,"
Marquess said. "Throws great. . . .
He won't really impress you with
his arm strength, but he throws
people out. He's got a tremendous
quick release."
In addition, Robbins "is really

valuable bccausc he handles
pitchers so well," Marquess said.
"He calls a great game."
Robbins had flashes of brilliance
offensively last year, but struggled
at the plate most of the latter half
of the season. Then in the West I

Second baseman Frank Carey may assume the leadoff role this year with the departure of speedsters Ruben
Amaro and Toi Cook.
Regional he batted .438 with two home
runs, two doubles, five RBIs and eight
runs scored. "I expect Doug to have his
best year offensively," Marquess said.
• First base: Junior Ron Witmcyer may
be the best first baseman in the nation.
Defensively, he is agile around the bag,
gloves everything in sight and makes the
the tricky 3-6-3 double play look like
child's play. He has committed only five
errors in 938 chances in two years.
Offensively, Witmeyer can hit for
power and average. He started slowly
last season but hit .438 with 35 RBIs
in the final 30 games of the season.
Last summer, he played in the Cape
Cod League, an amatuer league that
uses wood bats and consists primarily
of college players. He hit. 343 for Har
wich, banging five home runs and earn
ing a spot in the Cape Cod League
All-Star team.
• Second base: Junior Frank Carey made
the switch to second last year after a
lifetime at shortstop. His defense was

spotty at times, but now he has settled
into the new position and will anchor
the middle infield.
"I think Frank Carey is a key defen
sively," Marquess said. "He kind of holds
us together up the middle ... and he's
much improved, especially on defense."
Carey also played in the Cape Cod
League last summer, batting a nifty .313
and hitting four home runs for the Cotuit
Kcttelers. He joined Witmeyer on the
Cape Cod League All-Star Team.
After stealing 95 bases in his career
at Granite Hills High School in San
Diego County, Carey was slightly
hobbled by a nagging ankle injury the
past two years, stealing only seven bases
his freshman year and 17 last year.
But now Carey is back at full strength
and probably will look to run more,
especially if he is batting in the lead-off
spot.
• Third base: Junior Ed Spraguc will
probably play catcher in the major
leagues, Marquess said, but "has made
himself into a pretty good defensive
player at third base." He played partic
ularly good defense in the College World
Series last June.

Sprague's biggest contributions,
however, come on offense. He hit .330
last year, with 18 doubles, 16 home runs
and 69 RBIs. "I've never had a player
have the statistics he has as a freshman
and sophomore," said Marquess, who is
in his 12th year as Stanford's coach.

'I think Frank Carey is a
key defensively. He kind
of holds us together up
the middle . . . and he's
much improved, especially
on defense.'

Last summer Spraguc played on the
U.S. team that won a silver medal in
the Pan American Games. He batted
.385 with a home run and four RBIs
during the Games.
• Right Held: Sophomore incumbent
Paul Carey had a memorable freshman

year. He batted .353 with a school
record-tying 20 doubles, 62 RBIs and
12 home runs, including three grand
slams. No one who was anywhere in the
Bay Area last June need be reminded
that the last of those three grand slams
came in the bottom of the 10th against
Louisiana State, with Stanford trailing
by three and tottering on the verge of
elimination.
Carey was named the Most Outstand
ing Player of both the West I Regional
and the College World Series.
"I don't know if you can have a year
like that again," Marquess said. "I think
he's very capable of that; I think he's a
better player than he was last year; the
only problem is that every one else
knows that, too, and he's not going to
be able to sneak up on anybody."
Marquess said Carey has particularly
improved his fielding. "He's a much bet
ter outfielder (than he was last year),"
he said. "In fairness to Paul, he played
mostly first base in high school and
hadn't played that much outfield.. ..
He's faster than he was. ... He probably
has the best arm of any of the outfiel
ders."

base, left field, designated hitter
and (for one-and-two-thirds in
nings) pitcher.
"Brian has earned a chance to
start," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "He sat last year,
and learned a lot. Everyone said,
'What's wrong with Brian Johnson?'
Well, nothing was wrong with Brian
Johnson. In most cases, it takes a
freshman a year — especially when
you come to a good program — to
adjust to better pitching."
So far, Johnson's play in left has
impressed Marquess. "He surpris
ingly has played very well defen
sively He's doing a good job
there," he said.
If Johnson falters, junior Scott
Delucchi will spell him.
Center field is less settled. Junior
Eric DeGraw and junior college
transfer Jack Hollis are the leading
candidates for the starting spot.

Whoever starts, he will be the fast
est person in the lineup and will
be valuable not only in the field
but also in the otherwise lead
footed batting order. DeGraw was
used some as a pinch runner last
year and is described by Marquess
as a "a good defensive center
fielder" and"the best base runner
on the team."
Hollis transferred from Los An
geles Harbor Junior College, where
he hit .387 last year with eight home
runs and 30 stolen bases.
"He's real similar to Eric
(DeGraw)," Marquess said. "He
can run, play some good center
field, steal bases, but has good
power, too."
Marquess said that DeGraw and
Hollis will probably alternate starts
in center for the tirst 10 or 15
games of the year.
Waiting in the wings are two
promising and speedy freshmen,
Mike Eicher from San Diego and
Albert Richardson from Hanford.
The only other ncwcomcr to the
starting lineup is Paulsen. He was
in a battle for the starting shortstop
spot last year before suffering a
knee injury Feb. 21. Up to that
point he had played in nine games,
starting six and batting .379 with a
home run, three doubles and 10
RBIs.
He underwent reconstructive sur
gery in March and is now fully
recovered from the injury, although
he continues to wear a brace that
Marquess said doesn't restrict his
movement. "He'll be better than he
was before the injury," Marquess

said.
Returnees fill the rest of the
starting lineup:
• Catcher: Senior Doug Robbins is
the best-kept secret on the Stanford
team. "I love him back there — he
doesn't a lot but he's so con
sistent," pitching coach Tom Dun
lon SR'd. 'Tie catches everything!

blocks everything. .. . He's really
underrated."
"He's a great defensive catcher,"
Marquess said. "Throws great. . . .
He won't really impress you with
his arm strength, but he throws
people out. He's got a tremendous
quick release."
In addition, Robbins "is really

valuable bccausc he handles
pitchers so well," Marquess said.
"He calls a great game."
Robbins had flashes of brilliance
offensively last year, but struggled
at the plate most of the latter half
of the season. Then in the West I

Second baseman Frank Carey may assume the leadoff role this year with the departure of speedsters Ruben
Amaro and Toi Cook.
Regional he batted .438 with two home
runs, two doubles, five RBIs and eight
runs scored. "I expect Doug to have his
best year offensively," Marquess said.
• First base: Junior Ron Witmcyer may
be the best first baseman in the nation.
Defensively, he is agile around the bag,
gloves everything in sight and makes the
the tricky 3-6-3 double play look like
child's play. He has committed only five
errors in 938 chances in two years.
Offensively, Witmeyer can hit for
power and average. He started slowly
last season but hit .438 with 35 RBIs
in the final 30 games of the season.
Last summer, he played in the Cape
Cod League, an amatuer league that
uses wood bats and consists primarily
of college players. He hit. 343 for Har
wich, banging five home runs and earn
ing a spot in the Cape Cod League
All-Star team.
• Second base: Junior Frank Carey made
the switch to second last year after a
lifetime at shortstop. His defense was

spotty at times, but now he has settled
into the new position and will anchor
the middle infield.
"I think Frank Carey is a key defen
sively," Marquess said. "He kind of holds
us together up the middle ... and he's
much improved, especially on defense."
Carey also played in the Cape Cod
League last summer, batting a nifty .313
and hitting four home runs for the Cotuit
Kcttelers. He joined Witmeyer on the
Cape Cod League All-Star Team.
After stealing 95 bases in his career
at Granite Hills High School in San
Diego County, Carey was slightly
hobbled by a nagging ankle injury the
past two years, stealing only seven bases
his freshman year and 17 last year.
But now Carey is back at full strength
and probably will look to run more,
especially if he is batting in the lead-off
spot.
• Third base: Junior Ed Spraguc will
probably play catcher in the major
leagues, Marquess said, but "has made
himself into a pretty good defensive
player at third base." He played partic
ularly good defense in the College World
Series last June.

Sprague's biggest contributions,
however, come on offense. He hit .330
last year, with 18 doubles, 16 home runs
and 69 RBIs. "I've never had a player
have the statistics he has as a freshman
and sophomore," said Marquess, who is
in his 12th year as Stanford's coach.

'I think Frank Carey is a
key defensively. He kind
of holds us together up
the middle . . . and he's
much improved, especially
on defense.'

Last summer Spraguc played on the
U.S. team that won a silver medal in
the Pan American Games. He batted
.385 with a home run and four RBIs
during the Games.
• Right Held: Sophomore incumbent
Paul Carey had a memorable freshman

year. He batted .353 with a school
record-tying 20 doubles, 62 RBIs and
12 home runs, including three grand
slams. No one who was anywhere in the
Bay Area last June need be reminded
that the last of those three grand slams
came in the bottom of the 10th against
Louisiana State, with Stanford trailing
by three and tottering on the verge of
elimination.
Carey was named the Most Outstand
ing Player of both the West I Regional
and the College World Series.
"I don't know if you can have a year
like that again," Marquess said. "I think
he's very capable of that; I think he's a
better player than he was last year; the
only problem is that every one else
knows that, too, and he's not going to
be able to sneak up on anybody."
Marquess said Carey has particularly
improved his fielding. "He's a much bet
ter outfielder (than he was last year),"
he said. "In fairness to Paul, he played
mostly first base in high school and
hadn't played that much outfield.. ..
He's faster than he was. ... He probably
has the best arm of any of the outfiel
ders."

First baseman Ron Witmeyer is regarded by many as
the best fielding first baseman in the country.
With Stanford's relatively inexpe
rienced pitching staff facing the of
ten fearsome batting orders in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Di
vision (and in a rugged non-league
schedule), the Cardinal's defense
will figure prominently in the team's
campaign to retain its NCAA base
ball championship.
When Stanford, ranked second
nationally in both major preseason
polls, opens play at 2 p.m. Friday
at Sunken Diamond against Santa
Clara, five of the eight starting po
sition players from last year's cham
pionship team will be back.
The Cardinal will probably not
experience any drop-off in the play
of its infield, where sophomore
shortstop Troy Paulsen will step
into the only vacancy.
But all eyes will be trained on
the outfield, where new starters will
try to fill the winged shoes of center
fielder Toi Cook and left-fielder
Ruben Amaro, both of whom
graduated.
Cook and Amaro not only were
the team's offensive sparkplugs last
year, but were also invaluable on
defense, running dow-n a lot of balls
in the gaps that mjght otherwise
have gone for extra bases.
In fact, for several years Stanford
has had an outfield that could help
pitchers out by running under their
mistakes. Two years ago, Cook
played right and was joined in the
outfield by fellow speed merchants
Mark Davis in center and Walt Har

ris in left.
"We've been spoiled a little bit
in the past," junior second baseman
Frank Carey said of the outfield's
play. "I would have to say that's a
question (this year)... . It's not
really fair to compare, but we have
some really good athletes.... we're
still going to be OK."
In fact, the left field spot will be
filled by the best athlete on the
team, sophomore Brian Johnson.
Johnson a three-time California
High School Athlete of the Year
and the starting quarterback for the
Stanford football team for most of
last season, saw only limited action
on the diamond in 1987, playing a
variety of positions, including third
base, left field, designated hitter
and (for one-and-two-thirds in
nings) pitcher.

starting six and batting .379 with a
home run, three doubles and 10
RBIs.
He underwent reconstructive sur
gery in March and is now fully
recovered from the injury, although
he continues to wear a brace that
Marquess said doesn't restrict his
movement. "He'll be better than he
was before the injury," Marquess

said.
Returnees fill the rest of the
starting lineup:
• Catcher: Senior Doug Robbins is
the best-kept secret on the Stanford
team. "I love him back there — he
doesn't a lot but he's so con
sistent," pitching coach Tom Dun
lon SR'd. 'Tie catches everything!

blocks everything. .. . He's really
underrated."
"He's a great defensive catcher,"
Marquess said. "Throws great. . . .
He won't really impress you with
his arm strength, but he throws
people out. He's got a tremendous
quick release."
In addition, Robbins "is really

valuable bccausc he handles
pitchers so well," Marquess said.
"He calls a great game."
Robbins had flashes of brilliance
offensively last year, but struggled
at the plate most of the latter half
of the season. Then in the West I

Second baseman Frank Carey may assume the leadoff role this year with the departure of speedsters Ruben
Amaro and Toi Cook.
Regional he batted .438 with two home
runs, two doubles, five RBIs and eight
runs scored. "I expect Doug to have his
best year offensively," Marquess said.
• First base: Junior Ron Witmcyer may
be the best first baseman in the nation.
Defensively, he is agile around the bag,
gloves everything in sight and makes the
the tricky 3-6-3 double play look like
child's play. He has committed only five
errors in 938 chances in two years.
Offensively, Witmeyer can hit for
power and average. He started slowly
last season but hit .438 with 35 RBIs
in the final 30 games of the season.
Last summer, he played in the Cape
Cod League, an amatuer league that
uses wood bats and consists primarily
of college players. He hit. 343 for Har
wich, banging five home runs and earn
ing a spot in the Cape Cod League
All-Star team.
• Second base: Junior Frank Carey made
the switch to second last year after a
lifetime at shortstop. His defense was

spotty at times, but now he has settled
into the new position and will anchor
the middle infield.
"I think Frank Carey is a key defen
sively," Marquess said. "He kind of holds
us together up the middle ... and he's
much improved, especially on defense."
Carey also played in the Cape Cod
League last summer, batting a nifty .313
and hitting four home runs for the Cotuit
Kcttelers. He joined Witmeyer on the
Cape Cod League All-Star Team.
After stealing 95 bases in his career
at Granite Hills High School in San
Diego County, Carey was slightly
hobbled by a nagging ankle injury the
past two years, stealing only seven bases
his freshman year and 17 last year.
But now Carey is back at full strength
and probably will look to run more,
especially if he is batting in the lead-off
spot.
• Third base: Junior Ed Spraguc will
probably play catcher in the major
leagues, Marquess said, but "has made
himself into a pretty good defensive
player at third base." He played partic
ularly good defense in the College World
Series last June.

Sprague's biggest contributions,
however, come on offense. He hit .330
last year, with 18 doubles, 16 home runs
and 69 RBIs. "I've never had a player
have the statistics he has as a freshman
and sophomore," said Marquess, who is
in his 12th year as Stanford's coach.

'I think Frank Carey is a
key defensively. He kind
of holds us together up
the middle . . . and he's
much improved, especially
on defense.'

Last summer Spraguc played on the
U.S. team that won a silver medal in
the Pan American Games. He batted
.385 with a home run and four RBIs
during the Games.
• Right Held: Sophomore incumbent
Paul Carey had a memorable freshman

year. He batted .353 with a school
record-tying 20 doubles, 62 RBIs and
12 home runs, including three grand
slams. No one who was anywhere in the
Bay Area last June need be reminded
that the last of those three grand slams
came in the bottom of the 10th against
Louisiana State, with Stanford trailing
by three and tottering on the verge of
elimination.
Carey was named the Most Outstand
ing Player of both the West I Regional
and the College World Series.
"I don't know if you can have a year
like that again," Marquess said. "I think
he's very capable of that; I think he's a
better player than he was last year; the
only problem is that every one else
knows that, too, and he's not going to
be able to sneak up on anybody."
Marquess said Carey has particularly
improved his fielding. "He's a much bet
ter outfielder (than he was last year),"
he said. "In fairness to Paul, he played
mostly first base in high school and
hadn't played that much outfield.. ..
He's faster than he was. ... He probably
has the best arm of any of the outfiel
ders."

First baseman Ron Witmeyer is regarded by many as
the best fielding first baseman in the country.
With Stanford's relatively inexpe
rienced pitching staff facing the of
ten fearsome batting orders in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Di
vision (and in a rugged non-league
schedule), the Cardinal's defense
will figure prominently in the team's
campaign to retain its NCAA base
ball championship.
When Stanford, ranked second
nationally in both major preseason
polls, opens play at 2 p.m. Friday
at Sunken Diamond against Santa
Clara, five of the eight starting po
sition players from last year's cham
pionship team will be back.
The Cardinal will probably not
experience any drop-off in the play
of its infield, where sophomore
shortstop Troy Paulsen will step
into the only vacancy.
But all eyes will be trained on
the outfield, where new starters will
try to fill the winged shoes of center
fielder Toi Cook and left-fielder
Ruben Amaro, both of whom
graduated.
Cook and Amaro not only were
the team's offensive sparkplugs last
year, but were also invaluable on
defense, running dow-n a lot of balls
in the gaps that mjght otherwise
have gone for extra bases.
In fact, for several years Stanford
has had an outfield that could help
pitchers out by running under their
mistakes. Two years ago, Cook
played right and was joined in the
outfield by fellow speed merchants
Mark Davis in center and Walt Har

ris in left.
"We've been spoiled a little bit
in the past," junior second baseman
Frank Carey said of the outfield's
play. "I would have to say that's a
question (this year)... . It's not
really fair to compare, but we have
some really good athletes.... we're
still going to be OK."
In fact, the left field spot will be
filled by the best athlete on the
team, sophomore Brian Johnson.
Johnson a three-time California
High School Athlete of the Year
and the starting quarterback for the
Stanford football team for most of
last season, saw only limited action
on the diamond in 1987, playing a
variety of positions, including third
base, left field, designated hitter
and (for one-and-two-thirds in
nings) pitcher.
"Brian has earned a chance to
start," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "He sat last year,
and learned a lot. Everyone said,
'What's wrong with Brian Johnson?'
Well, nothing was wrong with Brian
Johnson. In most cases, it takes a
freshman a year — especially when
you come to a good program — to
adjust to better pitching."
So far, Johnson's play in left has
impressed Marquess. "He surpris
ingly has played very well defen
sively He's doing a good job
there," he said.
If Johnson falters, junior Scott
Delucchi will spell him.
Center field is less settled. Junior
Eric DeGraw and junior college
transfer Jack Hollis are the leading
candidates for the starting spot.

Whoever starts, he will be the fast
est person in the lineup and will
be valuable not only in the field
but also in the otherwise lead
footed batting order. DeGraw was
used some as a pinch runner last
year and is described by Marquess
as a "a good defensive center
fielder" and"the best base runner
on the team."
Hollis transferred from Los An
geles Harbor Junior College, where
he hit .387 last year with eight home
runs and 30 stolen bases.
"He's real similar to Eric
(DeGraw)," Marquess said. "He
can run, play some good center
field, steal bases, but has good
power, too."
Marquess said that DeGraw and
Hollis will probably alternate starts
in center for the tirst 10 or 15
games of the year.
Waiting in the wings are two
promising and speedy freshmen,
Mike Eicher from San Diego and
Albert Richardson from Hanford.
The only other ncwcomcr to the
starting lineup is Paulsen. He was
in a battle for the starting shortstop
spot last year before suffering a
knee injury Feb. 21. Up to that
point he had played in nine games,
starting six and batting .379 with a
home run, three doubles and 10
RBIs.
He underwent reconstructive sur
gery in March and is now fully
recovered from the injury, although
he continues to wear a brace that
