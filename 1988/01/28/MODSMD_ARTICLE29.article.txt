# Freestyler Berzins smiles from start to finish
## 
### Cameron Macky Staff writer 
Why is Aimec Berzins smiling?
Is it because the junior freestyler
on the Stanford women's swimming
team placed second in her specialty,
the 100 freestyle, at last year's
NCAA Championships?
No, that's not it. That's ancient
history.
OK, is it because she helped the
Cardinal's 400 medley relay and 400
free relay teams to first-place
finishes at those same champion
ships, setting not only NCAA but
U.S. records in both events?
No. That's not it, either. That,
too, is history. Besides, records are
made to be broken.
All right, is it because during the
championships she beat her fastest
previous time not once or twice,
but three times?
Sorry, that's not even close. Once
again, that was long ago, and think
ing about last year's times won't
win this year's races.
Well then, why is she smiling?
Who knows? Maybe she's smiling
because she gets to swim every day,
which is what she enjoys more than
anything else. Hey, she smiles so
much the smile might be glued on
her face. And it's always there. This,
finally, could be the reason why
Aimee Berzins is smiling: It's what
she does best.
She swims pretty well, too. As a
freshman in the 1986 NCAA Cham
pionships, she placed ninth in the
100 free (garnering All-America
honors in the process) and 13th in
the 50 free. She was also named
All-America for her contributions
on four of the Cardinal relay teams.
Not bad for a freshman, but it didn't
even come close to the performance
she would turn in at the 1987

NCAAs.
"Everything just came together
for her during that meet (the '87
NCAAs)," said Stanford Women's
Swimming Coach George Haines.
"She had never gone under 50
seconds in the 100, and then she
did it three times in three races.
She was a key factor on our team."
Berzins' performance on the
record-setting relay teams was noth
ing short of spectacular. The 400
medley, which she anchored, was
"the highlight of the meet," accord
ing to Berzins. "The excitement was
tremendous, the crowd was going
crazy ... to have it come down to
the last leg and to be standing on
the platform watching was great.
Jenna (Johnson, who swam the

third leg) had just caught and
passed the Texas swimmer, who was
in the lane next to us. I was thinking
'Okay, it's up to me.' You're think
ing, hut you can't think."
When she touched the wall at
the end of the race, Berzins had
not only won the race for the Car
dinal, she had swum the fastest 100
of her life, coming home in 48.51
seconds. Two days later, in the 400
free relay, she broke the 48-second
mark as she helped her teammates
set another U.S. record.
The 100 free was held on the
day between the two relays. Team
mate Johnson, a 1984 Olympian and
the 1986 100 free champion, was
the favorite in the event. At the
end of the race, Johnson had suc

cessfully defended her crown, with
Berzins, who won the 1987 Pacific
10 Conference title in both the 100
and 200 free, claiming second in
49.55 seconds, a personal best for
the open 100.
"That (the 100) was probably one
of the best moments of my life,"
recalls Berzins. "I knew I could do
it! Nobody really expected me to
do anything. It was so exciting!"
Coach Haines, for one, took her
performance in stride. "I wasn't
really surprised (by her times)," he
said. "She has a lot of natural abil
ity, and she's a great competitor.
Turning is probably her strong
point. She's got great strength com
ing off the walls," he added.
Berzins now finds herself in the

peculiar position of being the
second-fastest swimmer in the
country without even being the fast
est on her own team. The presence
of Johnson, who has already won
two Olympic gold medals, has
caused Berzins to swim in relative
anonymity. "Swimmers in general
don't get a lot of recognition, and
Aimee definitely has not received
all (the praise) she's deserved,"
Johnson says. "She kind of gets
overlooked, partly because of me.
Sometimes you almost have to
break a world record to get some
recognition."
Berzins doesn't seem to mind.
"I've always been in the shadows.
It doesn't bother me, though. That's
just the way it is," she says.
While Johnson has cast a shadow
of sorts on her, Berzins sees their
relationship as purely beneficial:
Each swimmer pushes the other,
causing both to excel. "We both
help each other. That's the great
thing about being here: I get to
train against the best swimmers in
the country every day,"says Ber
zins. "Jenna's helped me a lot. She's
helped me grow in ways she doesn't
even know. We're competitive, but
there's nothing negative about it.
You can only look at it in a positive
sense."
Johnson is quick to agree. "A lot
of times in practice we swim in the
same lane and race each other,"
she says. "Aimee's always encour
aging me, pushing me to do better.
She's probably helped me more
than I've helped her."
"There's no question that being
together has helped them both,"
Haines says."I think what that did
for Aimee was it took away the
nervousness of swimming against
some of the better swimmers.
"Aimee's got such great energy,

too, and that rubs off on the other
swimmers."
"She is really bubbly," agrees tri
captain Susan Rapp. "It's easy to
get excited when there's someone
there who's always excited. She has
a huge smile."
Johnson takes the description
one step further. "Aimee is the
most bubbly person on the team.
She's almost hyper," Johnson says.
Berzins will try to channel that
energy into a repeat performance
at the upcoming NCAA meet, but
her main concern will be winning
a team championship for the
second-ranked Cardinal. "My first
goal is the NCAAs, for the team,"
she says. "We're really gelling,
we're one unit. I think we've got a
great chance of taking the title."
With that accomplished, she will
concentrate on the Olympic trials,
competing in the 100-meter free.
And after that?
"I'll swim here during my senior
year, but after that I'll have to sit
down and decide what I want to
do with the rest of my life," the
American Studies major says.
"People ask me, 'What do you do
after you give up something you've
been doing for 14 years?'. . . .
They've got a point: How do you
stop doing something that's given
you your identity, your character?
It's been so much a part of me, it's
going to be very hard to give up.
I swam through high school, it
helped me go to college, and it
determines how I spend my time.
I've learned so much from swim
ming: the value of hard work, how
to manage time. ... I'm sure what
I've learned will transfer to the rest
of my life," she said. "I just don't
know what I'll be doing yet."
She'll think of something. All that
energy certainly can't go to waste.

Junior Amy Berzins will try this season to catch the only freestyler in the country faster than she is: teammate
Jenna Johnson.
