# Students lobby Fac Sen Groups weigh in on Western Culture fight
##

Student opinion on the Western
Culture debate has polarized into
two csrrp® lobbying of the Fac
ulty Senate intensifies this week.
Supporters for the Chace West
ern Culture proposal — which calls
for retention of a core reading list
— gathered last night at Lathrop
House, where a group called "Save
the Core" planned lobbying strategy
to garner senate votes for the plan.
Meanwhile, several ethnic
minority groups — including the
Black Student Union (BSU), the
Asian American Students Associa
tion fAASA) and MEChA, the

Chicano student organization — are
circulating a student petition calling
for passage of the Western Culture
proposal supported by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies. The
CUS plan abolishes the core list
and renames the Western Culture
program "Cultures, Ideas and
Values."
The CUS plan is a slightly
modified version of recommenda
tions prepared by the Western Cul
ture Task Force.
Several ASSU senators, led by
senior Stacey Leyton, are siding
with the minority groups and aiding
the distribution of the petition,
which more than 300 students have
signed since it began circulating
three weeks ago, Levton said.

Leyton argued for the petition at
the last ASSU Senate meeting. Al
though the senate did not formally
vote on the CUS proposal, several
of the senators left the meeting with
petitions to circulate, she said.
"We want to show that there are
a lot of students supporting the task
force recommendation," said
Leyton, who is deputy chair of the
senate.
Leyton said the drive will con
tinue until the final Faculty Senate
vote on Western Culture, which
may come at the senate's Feb. 18
meeting.
In contrast to the public tactics
of the minority groups, Save the
Core is communicating privately
with key Faculty Senate members.
"We want a calm, intellectual ex
change with the Faculty Senate to
quietly persuade them [to approve]
Chace's plan," sophomore Lora
Headrick told 17 students at the
Save the Core meeting.
"We agree completely with the
task force concerns that women and
minorities aren't represented well,"
said Headrick, who helped organize
the group. "The only thing we dis
agree with is their method."
Headrick said the Chace proposal
is better than both the existing Area
One requirement and the task force

proposal because "it's flexible and
structured at the same time."
According to Headrick, Save the
Core decided to write letters only
to Faculty Senate members because
it wants "to focus on the senate
. . . [without being] intrusive or
obtrusive about what we're doing."
Junior Janine Duyvestein said the
group, which is currently operating
on a SlOO alumni donation, decided
not to stage a protest before the
Feb. 4 and 18 senate meetings be
cause "Western Culture is not for
one group. It's not a special interest
issue."
The BSU, MEChA and Students
United for Democratic Education
(SUDE) staged a protest before the
Faculty Senate's Jan. 21 meeting,
at which the senate initiated con
sideration of the two reform
proposals.
