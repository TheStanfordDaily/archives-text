# Conservation biologist:
## Rain forests face global 'crisis' 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Global rain forest deforestation
has reached a "crisis level" and has
become "one of the most important
environmental issues facing
mankind," according to a former
Stanford biologist who spoke on
campus last night.
Bruce Wilcox, former director of
Stanford's Center for Conservation
Biology, told an audience in Kresge
Auditorium that 37 percent of rain
forest acreage will be destroyed by
the year 2000.
Speaking as part of the continu

ing human biology lecture series
"Conservation and Sustainability,"
Wilcox said this rate of loss trans
lates to a deforestation rate of 2
percent per year and the destruc
tion of 50 acres of forest per minute.
The rain forests, which cover 24
million square kilometers — about
one fourth of the earth's surface
— are cleared to collect building
materials, to farm land, to provide
fuel and to expand grazing area,
Wilcox said.
Wilcox noted that society has
failed to control the destruction of
forests because it is ignorant about

tropical ecosystems and how to use
them properly.
"We have not yet fully diagnosed
the problem," he said. "And we
have not fully begun applying the
proper treatment."
The social, political and eco
nomic instability of Third World
countries also prevents govern
ments from acting to stem tropical
deforestation, he said.
Because about one third of
known species live in tropical rain
forests, Wilcox said, the destruction
of these animal habitats will in
crease the extinction of species.
