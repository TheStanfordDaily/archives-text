# Kennedy confirmation likely
## Judge clears Senate panel 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer With wire reports 
The Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday
unanimously recommended confirming Pres
ident Reagan's nomination of Stanford
alumnus Judge Anthony Kennedy to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
The committee's approval of Kennedy
clears the way for a confirmation vote some
time next week by the full Senate and an
end to the paralysis of a high court reluctant
to make major rulings with a crucial vacancy.
The senators, voting 14-0 to recommend
Kennedy's confirmation, heaped praise on
the Sacramento federal appeals court judge,
and several held him up in contrast to Judge
Robert Bork — Reagan's initial nominee —
who was rejected by the Senate.
If confirmed, Kennedy, who earned a bac
helor's degree in political science here in
1958 and went on to Harvard Law School,
will join two other Stanford alumni on the
high court. Chief Justice William Rehnquist
earned a coterminal political science degree
here in 1948 and graduated from Stanford
Law School in 1952. Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor graduated from the Law School
in the same year after earning a bachelor's
degree in economics here in 1950.
Political Science Prof. Robert Horn, who
taught Kennedy as an undergraduate, said
last night, "It would take a miracle to stop
him from being confirmed by the full Senate."
Horn said he would not be surprised if the
vote of the full Senate were also unanimous.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-
W.Va.), a committee member, said he hoped
to schedule a Senate vote for confirmation

as early as Friday or next Monday. However,
a committee official said later that the vote
would not occur until Tuesday, after distri
bution of a printed committee report.
The committee's vote was taken in an at
mosphere of good will and camaraderie
sharply different from the scene of the Bork
hearings, which featured civil rights groups
and Democratic critics exchanging angry al
legations with the first nominee's staunch
Republican supporters.
Both Republican and Democratic senators
described Kennedy, 51, as a reasonable and
compassionate jurist who assesses each case
on its merits without applying a strict, precon
ceived ideology.
While the conservative Bork was "on the
extreme side of interpreting the Con
stitution," Kennedy is more moderate and
"in the mainstream" of American thought,
said committee member Sen. Dennis DeCon
cini (D-Ariz.).
Kennedy's views "reflect the core values
of our constitutional system of government,"
said Committee Chair Joseph Biden (D-Del.),
a leader in the fight that brought Bork's
defeat in October.
President Reagan praised the vote in the
Senate, and said in a statement, "I look
forward to a positive vote soon .. . that will
bring this distinguished and scholarly legal
mind to the court."
Horn echoed Reagan, commenting that
Kennedy will have a "salutory effect on the
court."
Kennedy is expected to play a pivotal role
on the court, as did his predecessor, Lewis
Powell. The nine-member court is evenly split
