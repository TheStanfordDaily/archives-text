Smuggler fingers Panama leader
WASHINGTON — Graphic details of Panama strongman Manuel
Noriega's alleged participation in drug deals and money laundering
has been obtained by congressional investigators from a major
American marijuana trafficker who described delivering $300,000
in a briefcase to Noriega to demonstrate his sincerity.
The Senate Government Operations permanent investigations
subcommittee will hear testimony today from Steven Michael Kalish,
a principal witness in a Tampa, Fla.-based investigation by the U.S.
Customs Service into Noriega's alleged role in illicit drug trafficking
and schemes to disguise the proceeds.
In another Noriega case, it was learned that the Department of
Justice plans to seek an indictment of the strongman and others
on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges in Miami next
month. A grand jury there is scheduled to hear testimony this week
from Jose Blandon, the former Panamanian consul general in New
York fired by Noriega two weeks ago. Blandon has vowed to make
public details of Noriega's alleged corruption if he does not step
down.
Department of Justice officials have voiced doubts about the
legal strength of the Miami case, which depends heavily on testimony
by Floyd Carlton Caceres, a Panamanian pilot now in the federal
witness protection program. Caceres claims to have made drug
related payments to Noriega, and Blandon's testimony is expected
to buttress that case significantly, one source familiar with the
investigation said.
Shamir promises new softer line
NEW YORK — A prominent U.S. Jewish leader announced
yesterday he had received personal assurances from Israel's Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir that indiscriminate beatings of Palestinian
Arabs or any kind of "excessive" force by soldiers and security
people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will not be tolerated.
"With regard to the issue of beatings in the occupied territories,
I can state today that Israel does not have a policy of indiscriminate
beatings," Morris Abram, chairman of the Conference of Major
American Jewish Organizations, said at a news conference in Man
hattan. "Such a policy would be wrong and inconsistent with Israel's
historic policy and practice."
Abram read a message from Shamir that said: "The use of
indiscriminate beatings or any kind of excessive force by our security
people or soldiers is not permitted. The use of force is sanctioned
only for the purpose of breaking up violent demonstrations, for
self-defense and for those resisting arrest."
Sources familiar with intense discussions between prominent Jews
and top Israeli officials believe the message from Shamir represented
a distinct softening of Israel's hard-line position toward individual
Arabs.
"There is a general feeling of satisfaction that this kind of thing
is not going to happen again," said one well-connected Jewish
activist in New York. "When Abram spoke with Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin on the phone, you can be sure he did not call him
praising him for his policy of beatings."
Mubarak shares Mideast peace ideas
WASHINGTON — Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak yesterday
briefed top Reagan administration officials on his ideas for a new
Middle East peace initiative as pressure mounted for the United
States to take some action on its own to break the long-stalled
peace process.
"We had a very worthwhile discussion and that's about all I can
say at this time," Secretary of State George Shultz told reporters
after an hourlong meeting with Mubarak. The Egyptian leader is
to meet today with President Reagan.
Mubarak also met with Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci to
discuss an agreement that is expected to be signed during his
four-day visit here formally giving Egypt the same status as Israel
as a major non-NATO ally.
But the major issue on Mubarak's agenda this week is discussing
some new formula for getting the peace process off dead center.
Shultz also met yesterday with two West Bank Palestinian leaders,
Hanna Siniora and Fayez Abu Rahmeh, who urged him in a letter
to support an international peacekeeping force to protect Pales
tinians in the Israeli-occupied territories from the "brutality of
Israel's military authorities."
The two Palestinians said, after a 30-minute meeting they de
scribed as "cordial," that they had urged Shultz to take a more
active role in the Middle East and to give the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), which they called in their letter "our sole
legitimate representative," a place at an international peace con
ference.
Teen interviewed by CBS found dead
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A black South African
teen-ager who alleged in a recent CBS News documentary that he
had been tortured by police has been found shot to death five days
after being questioned by authorities about the interview, officials
and the youth's family said yesterday.
Family members charged that Godfrey Sicelo Dhlomo, 18, had
been hiding from the police because he feared he would be killed
in retaliation for his appearance in the documentary, "Children of
Apartheid," broadcast in the United States in December. The
authorities denied the allegation.
Dhlomo's body, with a bullet wound in the head, was found
Monday near his grandmother's home in the sprawling black
township of Soweto near Johannesburg, police officials said.
Dhlomo also was interviewed in a Dutch television documentary
in March, but was not identified by name in either program. He
had told his CBS interviewer that he had been detained four times
and was tortured by the police.
NASA sets shuttle launch for Aug. 4
WASHINGTON — The National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration announced yesterday it has set Aug. 4 as the new
target date to launch the U.S. space shuttle on its first mission
since the Challenger tragedy.
The announcement came on the eve of the second anniversary
of the worst accident of the space age and shortly after plans were
unveiled for a memorial honoring the seven astronauts who died
as a fireball destroyed the shuttle, and seven other astronauts who
have died in training and aircraft accidents.
As the space agency disclosed its new launch plan for the shuttle
Discovery, program officials told Congress they have completed
their investigation of last month's test failure of a redesigned shuttle
booster rocket, and have satisfied themselves that they have in
hand two other potential problems discovered in recent days.
"We did have a hiccup," Richard Truly, NASA's associate ad
ministrator for space flight, told a House subcommittee as officials
reported on the December test mishap. "We got bit on that design,
and it cost us a couple of months."
