# GNP rose while spending fell
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - U.S. eco
nomic output rose at a surprisingly
strong 4.2 percent annual rate in
the fourth quarter of 1987, but
spending by consumers fell sharply,
the Commerce Department re
ported.
The result was a large buildup
in business inventories, which will
cause companies to curb output and
jobs in months ahead, economists
said. The figures almost certainly
mean that the economy will un
dergo a major slowdown, they said,
and some warned that the chances
of a recession this year have in
creased.
For all of 1987, the economy ex
panded at a 3.8-percent pace, as
measured by the growth in gross
national product, adjusted for in
flation, from the fourth quarter of
1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987.

The White House, which had
predicted a more modest 3.2-
percent growth rate for 1987, issued
an upbeat statement on the report.
"This indicates very little slippage
in growth from the October drop
in the stock market," presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
"The economy continues to perform
with considerable strength."
But the report also contained bad
news for the White House, which
is extremely anxious to avoid a
recession in the coming election
year.
Consumer spending declined at
a 3.8-percent annual rate, adjusted
for inflation, in the October-to-
Dccember period while businesses
were piling up inventories.
Economists said that the cutback
in consumption may have been at
tributable to factors other than the

stock market's woes. But they said
that in any event, many companies
will curtail operations, cease hiring
and even lay off some workers to
bring production into line with sales
during the first half of 1988.
"We've got too many inventories,
too many goods sitting on the shelf,"
said David Wyss, chief financial
economist at Data Resources, an
economic consulting firm in Lexi
ngton, Mass. Businesses will stop
ordering goods for a while, Wyss
said, and"the odds are very good
now that we could have at least
one quarter of negative growth" in
1988. A recession is usually defined
as two consecutive quarters in
which GNP falls.
The report is likely to intensify
concern within the administration
that the Federal Reserve is keeping
interest rates too high. Beryl

Sprinkel, chairman of the Council
of Economic Advisers, has been
complaining privately that the Fed
is keeping too tight a rein on the
economy, and some other adminis
tration officials are also worried. A
spokeswoman for Sprinkel said
Wednesday that he would not com
ment on the GNP figures.
Fed officials appeared unalarmed
by Wednesday's report, however.
Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson
said it isn't clear that the large
increase in inventories poses a
threat to the economy in early 1988.
The situation "certainly bears
watching," he told reporters after
delivering a speech.
He also rejected the central ar
gument advanced by Sprinkel that
last year's slow growth in the money
supply could kill the expansion.
