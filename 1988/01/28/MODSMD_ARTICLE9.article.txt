# Reagan asks for scaled-down aid

### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, declar
ing that he will not "preside over the com
munization of Central America,"yesterday for
mally sent Congress his $36.25 million request
for assistance to Nicaragua's contras after aban
doning a plan to give Congress a voice in de
termining whether and when military funds in
the package could be released.
Congressional Democrats quickly denounced
Reagan's aid proposal and predicted that they
had enough votes to defeat it in the House. A
group of key Democrats already is planning to
propose a competing aid package that would
eliminate any funds for military supplies.
Reagan pledged to hold in escrow the $3.6
million military segment of his funding request
as long as progress is made toward a cease-firc
between the contras and Nicaragua's Sandinista
government. The White House had sought to
devise a compromise that would have given
Congress a role in deciding when these funds
could be released.
However, only a day after Reagan and several

senators had discussed the proposed compro
mise, the White House decided that it could
not overcome constitutional obstacles, involving
separation of powers, in working out the formula.
Instead, Reagan said, he would "personally
consult the presidents of the four Central Amer
ican democracies" before resuming the weapons
flow to the contras under his proposed plan,
although White House officials gave no guaran
tee that he would be bound by their views.
A senior State Department official said an
itinerary is being drawn for Secretary of State
George Shultz for a one-stop trip to Central
America within several weeks to confer with
regional leaders about their peace efforts.
The aid package has become a centerpiece
of the president's foreign policy during his final
year in office and White House officials made
it clear yesterday that Reagan will direct nearly
all his energies in coming days to winning ap
proval of the proposal when the House votes
on it next Wednesday.

'This is the do-or-dic point," presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwatcr said of the last
ditch effort to win support for the contras. "The
money that we're requesting will dictate the
lifeblood of the resistance."
Barring a drastic change in the current po
litical climate, there will be no more votes in
this Congress on the issue of contra aid.
The White House, facing a Democratic
majority in the House and Senate that was
objecting to the plan well before it was prepared,
had searched frantically until the last minute
for a compromise that might draw crucial swing
votes. But, in the end, the administration backed
away from several compromise proposals that
had been under discussion.
Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Calif.), the third
ranking member of the Democratic leadership,
declared, "This thing is dead on arrival." That
view was echoed by several much-courted
moderates.
