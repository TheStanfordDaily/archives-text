# Students fight contra aid
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Staff writer 
The Stanford Central America
Action Network (SCAAN), a
campus student group, is organizing
local opposition to President
Reagan's proposed $36 million in
aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
SCAAN launched a letter-writing
campaign to U.S. representatives
this week, urging them to vote
against aid to the contras. Staffing
a table in White Plaza, group mem
bers encouraged the Stanford com
munity to write letters to their rep
resentatives and provided students
and other passersby with informa
tion about the aid proposal, which
Congress will vote on next week.
According to SCAAN member
Benjamin Robinson, a graduate stu
dent in Modern Thought and
Literature, the group generated 161
letters this week.
"The vote [in Congress] next
week is expected to be very close,"
he said. "Grass-roots organization
is very important, as we saw in the
Bork nomination case. Students
need to have a sense of responsi
bility for important issues."
"Students see contra aid issues
as a far-away thing," he added.
"That's not the way it is. Stanford
is involved with foreign policy issues
because of the Hoover Institution
and its affiliation with Secretary of
State George Shultz."
Shultz is currently on leave from
his position as a professor at the
Graduate School of Business.
SCAAN member Cathy Echols
said the proposal, which calls for
$32.4 million in "non-lethal" aid
and $3.6 million in "lethal" aid to
the contras, is deceptive.
" 'Lethal' aid is money going di
rectly to armaments," Echols said.
"So-called 'non-lethal' aid can still
be used to buy spare parts for
helicopters or to pay for ClA
administered training," she added.
Robinson concuncd, noting that
non-lethal aid eases the contras'
financial burden and frees up
money from other sources that can
then be spent on military goods.
SCAAN members said they also
plan to attend a demonstration in
San Francisco Monday organized
by Pledge of Resistance and
Nicaragua Network, two local
groups active in Central American
issues.
Echols said President Reagan
used "expediated procedures" to
put the proposal directly on Con
gress' agenda Jan. 27, without first
submitting it to review by Congres
sional committees, as is standard.
