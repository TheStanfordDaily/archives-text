# Advisory group to review University ties
## Budget cuts threaten Bing School 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
Funding pressures at Bing Nur
sery School have prompted the Uni
versity to appoint an advisory group
to study the relationship between
Stanford and the school, said Carol
Young-Holt, director of the Bing
School.
The school, located near Escon
dido Village, has provided a lab
environment for Stanford faculty
and students to study young
children since the 19405, but federal
budget cutbacks and reductions in
University financial support for
Bing have forced substantial tuition
increases for families of pupils at
the school.
"Funding is the crux of the mat
ter," said Young-Holt, explaining
the need for the advisory commit
tee.
According to Young-Holt,
"Someone in a leadership position
in the University needs to decide
whether they want to recommit to
the school and continue to use it
as a lab for University work. ... If
so, I hope the University will want
to make a serious (financial) com
mitment."

According to Psychology Prof. El
len Markman, the committee must
consider whether to continue the
present relationship between Stan
ford and the nursery school, expand
the program to include research by
other universites and colleges or
terminate the existing relationship
and change Bing into an indepen
dent, non-profit entity.
Markman stressed that the com
mittee has only just begun fact
finding and is far from a decision
regarding the school's future.
Young-Holt said the school,
which has a current enrollment of
over 300 children, is valuable be
cause it provides a "practical lab
situation" for both professors and
undergraduate students.
She explained that the school was
originally established as a labora
tory school for Stanford research
and student training.
Young-Holt said the school pro
vides "valuable hands-on experien
ce" for about 70 Stanford human
biology and psychology students
who come to the school each quar
ter to observe the children.
She said studying at the Bing

School is "an unparalleled experi
ence for undergrads" who are in
terested in child development, and
students who have studied there in
the past are "highly enthusiastic"
about the program.
She said, however, that while the
school now has "one of the best
programs in the world for children,"
such excellence costs a certain
amount, and tuition cannot rise in
definitely.
Therefore, Young-Holt said, she
hopes students and faculty will
"speak out on behalf of the school's
importance" to Stanford and con
vince the University to continue
funding.
Tina Kass, an assistant provost
and a member of the advisory
group, said there is "agreement
among committee members that
Bing provides a pretty important
service."
However, advisory committee
member Susan Schofield, associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences,
said the school's strong relationship
with Stanford in the past has be
come more "tenuous" in recent
years because fewer faculty are in
volved.

Markman said she personally
does a "vast amount" of research
at Bing that is valuable to her work
in cognitive psychology. Many psy
chology courses at Stanford have a
research component which can be
fulfilled by study at Bing, she added.
Markman said almost all children
over the age of three at the school
routinely participate in some of the
studies conducted by the Psychology
Department.
In the past, researchers have
studied such behavioral factors as
segregation by sex on the play
ground.
Schofield said she believes the
studies done by Stanford are a pos
itive force in attracting families to
the school.
"My impression is that the
families who enroll here are eager
to have their children involved," she
said, noting that parents of students
often take part in studies involving
parenting.
Young-Holt said she hopes "as
much importance will be attached
to the research done at Bing School
as is given to high-tech research at
Stanford."
