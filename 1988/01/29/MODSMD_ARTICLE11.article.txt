## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Editor's farewell 
### 
Course title: The Daily
Requirements: 25-65 hours/wk; 2-5 papers/wk; all
nighters routine.
Units: none.
Although most students would sensibly rather
drop out and sell used cars for a living than put
themselves through so much work, there are a few
of us around who aren't so sensible: We work at
The Daily.
The hours are hellish, the work is routinely frus
trating, and the product is often less than it could
be. But still we come back for more.
Why? Because capturing and presenting the life
of Stanford University each and every day is a
perverse but endlessly fascinating challenge. The
perfect newspaper is an elusive prize, but it is one
that never loses its appeal.
Each day of this past volume, we raced the clock
to give you the best Daily we possibly could. Some
days we came close; other days we fell far short
of the mark.
But every afternoon, as we set to work on yet
another day's Daily, we were comforted by the
knowledge that tomorrow was a clean slate.
Whether we were following up on an excellent
analysis of the Western Culture debate or mopping
up after a missed story, "tomorrow" was always a
chance to top — or redeem — the work of today.
Sadly, for the Daily staff of Volume 192 there

will be no more "tomorrows." Our time is up. For
better or for worse, all of us — editors, writers,
photographers and artists — are going to have to
be satisfied with the printed record we've left be
hind.
The Daily this volume has made its share of
mistakes, but it has also offered the Stanford com
munity some very good journalism. Joe Metcalfe's
thoughtful treatment of date rape, Nick Anderson
and Alicia Kent's thorough coverage of the Roble
crisis, and the wit of Andrew Berkowitz are just a
few examples.
The past four months have been the best of my
life. It's been a pleasure and a challenge to work
with so many talented and caring people. Thanks
especially to managing editors Chris Myers and
Ken Stevens for their skill, dedication and en
durance.
I've taken a lot of classes at Stanford, but none
compare to The Daily. For me, it's been a course
in life.
