Rape story fuels
frat stereotypes
We are writing to express our
dismay and frustration with The
Daily's Jan. 25 article on date rape.
We feel it was misleading and that
its tone was seriously distorted
against fraternities. Accordingly, we
are compelled to voice our oppo
sition to such slanted articles, which
only serve to create more misun
derstanding.
First, we are under no circum
stances denying the severity or
brutality of date rape. It is an ugly
issue which must be confronted and
dealt with. However, to imply as
The Daily did that the fraternal
system as a whole bears a large
part of the responsibility for the
prevalence of date rape is an ir
responsible generalization.
In the article, the writer cautions
against stereotyping rape situations,
yet all three anecdotes in the article
described date rapes involving fra
ternities. He writes that the rapist
is "often a remote acquaintance,
someone who lives down the hall
or a boyfriend." However in each
of the accounts the rapist is neither
a boyfriend nor a fellow dorm res
ident but a fraternity member.
We do not question the authen
ticity of the three stories, but date
rape is a societal phenomenon, not
a fraternal one. By linking frater
nities with all of the narratives, the
writer created the false impression
that date rape is far more likely in
a fraternity than in society at large.
Our house recognizes, as do
many other houses, that date rape
is a serious and all too common
occurrence. Hoping to better edu
cate and sensitize ourselves to the

issues involved, we have hosted the
Rape Education Project in each of
the past two years. In December a
sorority participated with us in the
program, which was well-attended
and very informative.
In closing, we are not arguing
that date rape is an insignificant
problem nor that the fraternity en
vironment is free from blame. And
we are certainly not evading our
responsibility, especially as fraternity
members, to challenge sexist
thought and behavior. Rather we
hope that as members of the diverse
Stanford community, we can work
together to recognize, attack and
hopefully overcome this problem.
Articles such as this one typify
The Daily's traditional anti
fraternity stance and only increase
misunderstanding and unfair as
sumptions.

Teach all four
major cultures
I'm writing because I was as
tounded by some of the recent
statements in the press concerning
Western Culture education at Stan
ford.
A Europe-oriented education
was not appropriate 30 years ago,
and it's even less appropriate now.
Such an education is the main cause
of the ethnocentrism of white
Americans.
This ethnocentrism, in turn, has
been a major factor in such national
disasters as the Vietnam War, our

declining ability to compcte in
world markets and our inability to
come to terms with the Nicaraguan
revolution.
What people need is a compre
hensive understanding of the cul
tural history of our planet. A good
starting point would be an equal
emphasis on each of the four major
cultural traditions: African, Asian,
Euro-American and Latin Ameri
can.

Thanks to staff
as villa era ends
As the era of Stanford's "Villa
Salviatino" comes to a close (Daily,
Jan. 11), it seems appropriate to
recognize and salute the mnny years
of service by all the Italian resident
staff at the overseas campus in
Florence.
I had the good fortune to be a
faculty wife at the villa in the spring
of last year while my husband was
teaching there. We were impressed
with the caliber of the faculty (we
audited several classes), the skill
and dedication of the administra
tion and the resources and patience
of the staff.
It is regrettable that the era of
the villa must come to an end. I
expect a new generation of Stanford
students will enjoy the Palazzo on
the Arno. May they also be fortu
nate enough to enjoy the excellent
people who make up the pcrmanant
cadre at the Florence campus under
the able direction of Prof. Guiseppe
Mammarella.
