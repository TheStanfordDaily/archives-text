# Budget paring possible
## 
### 
Interest payments on the national debt are already
the third-largest budget item behind defense and Social
Security. A few more years of $200-billion deficits and
for the rest of your life half of every tax dollar you
pay will go to just the interest on the national debt.
Yet thanks to President Reagan there is still no talk
of paying our taxes or of cutting defense spending,
and thanks to a gridlocked Congress there is no talk
of cutting anything else.

The budget could be balanced without even having
to make difficult choices over priorities. There are
enough spending items that could be cut and enough
taxes that could be reformed simply as a matter of
rationality.
On the spending side, $100 billion could be cut
from defense. Caspar Weinberger was a terrible sec
retary of defense. Given an extra $1 trillion to play
with, he squandered it on trying to "lock in" wasteful,
unnecessary and wrongheaded programs. Sitting-duck
aircraft carriers, World War 11-vintagc warships with
600-man crews, redundant bomber programs and Star
Wars must go.
Reagan tried to sell Star Wars as an alternative to
deterrence. The administration concedes that the idea
behind Star Wars is to enhance deterrence by making
our deterrent force more difficult to attack. But the
United States and the Soviet Union agreed in signing
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that anti-missile
systems arc highly destabilizing and ultimately threaten
deterrence. To keep its deterrent intact, each side
would have to build enough missiles to be sure it
could overcome the other side's anti-missile system.
An arms race would ensue.
The most stable deterrent is when each side fields
an equal number of single-warhead missiles. This is
also the cheapest system. According to Democratic
presidential candidate Albert Gore, the Soviets have
expressed interest in such an agreement.
Many other military cuts arc possible. Two hundred
thousand troops could be brought home from Europe,
which is perfectly capable of manning its own defense,
and pork-barrel army bases could be shut down all
over the United States.
Social Security must also be reformed. Bruce Babbitt
is the only presidential candidate brave enough to
advocate needs testing Social Security. Jealous
defenders of untested benefits try to paint needs testing
as an attack on the needy. Of course, it is just the
opposite. A needs-tested program could give larger
benefits to those without resources of their own and
still save money.
Defenders of untested benefits also try to assert
that Social Security is a retirement plan that recipients
have paid for. The only way Social Security is like a

retirement plan is that those who earned the most
when they were working receive the largest payments.
Otherwise, there is no relation between what people
pay in to Social Security and what they get out. Current
recipients arc getting far more out than they paid in.
Of course, the opposite will be true by the time today's
young people arc old.
In education, the Reagan spending cuts have been
penny-wise and pound-foolish. The dollars we skimp
on education today will cost us in crime, unemployment
and lost tax revenues in the future. This hidden deficit
can be reduced by spending more money in the right
places today.
The city of San Antonio, Tex., attacks the cycle of
underachievcment in the underclass by getting to un
educated mothers when they are pregnant. Mothers
are given remedial education and taught how to stim
ulate their children. The children are enrolled in
advance and head start programs from birth. The
demographics of poverty can be successfully confronted
if we put some brains and resources into the effort.
The Reagan administation has pointed out how
welfare can lead to dependency and has used this as
a rationale for cutting welfare programs. But the
strangest incentive to dependency on welfare is the
fact that when a welfare recipient gets a job she loses
her welfare benefits, which usually amount to more
than she can earn working full time at minimum wage.
The way to eliminate dependency on welfare is not
to spend less on welfare but to spend more and to
allow recipients to keep the majority of their earnings
when they do get a job.
In Massachusetts, Gov. Michael Dukakis has
reformed welfare by providing day care and job train
ing. Recipients get to keep their welfare benefits for
a year after getting a job and arc allowed free day
care indefinitely. Many long-term recipients are moving
off the rolls as a result. Even in the fairly short run,
being more generous can save money.
* On the revenue side, I would begin with a tax on
oil. One reason to have an oil tax is to prepare for
the next oil price shock. Price shocks cause the com
bination of inflation and recession that the economy
experienced in 1974 and 1979. If we have a hefty tax
on oil, we can remove it when an oil price shock hits.
The domestic oil price will then remain constant.
Obviously, the best time to have put such a tax on
oil would have been when the price of oil fell in 1982,
before the economy adjusted to the lower price. We
can't put the tax on now without causing inflation.
For one, we need the revenue. The 1981 economic
report of the president estimated that $50 billion of
revenue per year would be raised by a 50-ccnt-pcr
gallon gasoline tax. If gas prices had been kept at
their 1982 levels, we would have $500 billion less debt
now.
Less venally, a tax on oil would make users pay the
social cost of the pollution they generate. A tax is
necessary to reduce oil consumption to economically
appropriate levels.
There are many intelligent things that could be
done if only we elect a president who will do them.

being more generous can save money.
* On the revenue side, I would begin with a tax on
oil. One reason to have an oil tax is to prepare for
the next oil price shock. Price shocks cause the com
bination of inflation and recession that the economy
experienced in 1974 and 1979. If we have a hefty tax
on oil, we can remove it when an oil price shock hits.
The domestic oil price will then remain constant.
Obviously, the best time to have put such a tax on
oil would have been when the price of oil fell in 1982,
before the economy adjusted to the lower price. We
can't put the tax on now without causing inflation.
For one, we need the revenue. The 1981 economic
report of the president estimated that $50 billion of
revenue per year would be raised by a 50-ccnt-pcr
gallon gasoline tax. If gas prices had been kept at
their 1982 levels, we would have $500 billion less debt
now.
Less venally, a tax on oil would make users pay the
social cost of the pollution they generate. A tax is
necessary to reduce oil consumption to economically
appropriate levels.
There are many intelligent things that could be
done if only we elect a president who will do them.

Interest payments on the national debt are already
the third-largest budget item behind defense and Social
Security. A few more years of $200-billion deficits and
for the rest of your life half of every tax dollar you
pay will go to just the interest on the national debt.
Yet thanks to President Reagan there is still no talk
of paying our taxes or of cutting defense spending,
and thanks to a gridlocked Congress there is no talk
of cutting anything else.

The budget could be balanced without even having
to make difficult choices over priorities. There are
enough spending items that could be cut and enough
taxes that could be reformed simply as a matter of
rationality.
On the spending side, $100 billion could be cut
from defense. Caspar Weinberger was a terrible sec
retary of defense. Given an extra $1 trillion to play
with, he squandered it on trying to "lock in" wasteful,
unnecessary and wrongheaded programs. Sitting-duck
aircraft carriers, World War 11-vintagc warships with
600-man crews, redundant bomber programs and Star
Wars must go.
Reagan tried to sell Star Wars as an alternative to
deterrence. The administration concedes that the idea
behind Star Wars is to enhance deterrence by making
our deterrent force more difficult to attack. But the
United States and the Soviet Union agreed in signing
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that anti-missile
systems arc highly destabilizing and ultimately threaten
deterrence. To keep its deterrent intact, each side
would have to build enough missiles to be sure it
could overcome the other side's anti-missile system.
An arms race would ensue.
The most stable deterrent is when each side fields
an equal number of single-warhead missiles. This is
also the cheapest system. According to Democratic
presidential candidate Albert Gore, the Soviets have
expressed interest in such an agreement.
Many other military cuts arc possible. Two hundred
thousand troops could be brought home from Europe,
which is perfectly capable of manning its own defense,
and pork-barrel army bases could be shut down all
over the United States.
Social Security must also be reformed. Bruce Babbitt
is the only presidential candidate brave enough to
advocate needs testing Social Security. Jealous
defenders of untested benefits try to paint needs testing
as an attack on the needy. Of course, it is just the
opposite. A needs-tested program could give larger
benefits to those without resources of their own and
still save money.
Defenders of untested benefits also try to assert
that Social Security is a retirement plan that recipients
have paid for. The only way Social Security is like a

retirement plan is that those who earned the most
when they were working receive the largest payments.
Otherwise, there is no relation between what people
pay in to Social Security and what they get out. Current
recipients arc getting far more out than they paid in.
Of course, the opposite will be true by the time today's
young people arc old.
In education, the Reagan spending cuts have been
penny-wise and pound-foolish. The dollars we skimp
on education today will cost us in crime, unemployment
and lost tax revenues in the future. This hidden deficit
can be reduced by spending more money in the right
places today.
The city of San Antonio, Tex., attacks the cycle of
underachievcment in the underclass by getting to un
educated mothers when they are pregnant. Mothers
are given remedial education and taught how to stim
ulate their children. The children are enrolled in
advance and head start programs from birth. The
demographics of poverty can be successfully confronted
if we put some brains and resources into the effort.
The Reagan administation has pointed out how
welfare can lead to dependency and has used this as
a rationale for cutting welfare programs. But the
strangest incentive to dependency on welfare is the
fact that when a welfare recipient gets a job she loses
her welfare benefits, which usually amount to more
than she can earn working full time at minimum wage.
The way to eliminate dependency on welfare is not
to spend less on welfare but to spend more and to
allow recipients to keep the majority of their earnings
when they do get a job.
In Massachusetts, Gov. Michael Dukakis has
reformed welfare by providing day care and job train
ing. Recipients get to keep their welfare benefits for
a year after getting a job and arc allowed free day
care indefinitely. Many long-term recipients are moving
off the rolls as a result. Even in the fairly short run,
being more generous can save money.
