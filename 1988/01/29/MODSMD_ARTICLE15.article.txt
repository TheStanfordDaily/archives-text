The proposal of the Western Culture Task
Force and the statements of its opponents reveal
a basic misconception of the proper approach
to ideas and of the standards by which a uni
versity curriculum should be developed.

Stanford Objectivists

The major concern of the task force, and the
major problem its proposal is designed to solve,
is that writings by women and minorities are
underrepresented in the Western Culture re
quirement. The proposal's opponents seem to
concede that this is a pressing problem and that
it is a legitimate concern for the developers of
a curriculum. But is it?
Ideas are the product of individual minds. A
culture is created by individuals who think in
dependently and who originate ideas. Such in
dividuals may be male or female, black or white,
tall or short, fat or slim, with or without glasses;
but none of these attributes are essential to the
quality of their ideas or to their influence on
the culture.
When studying Aristotle, for example, his rales
of logic, his philosophy of science, his biology
and his ethics are all relevant. The nature of
his influence on later thinkers and on the de
velopment of Western culture is also relevant.
The fact that he was white or that he was male
is not relevant. The same is true of any other
important thinker.

Claiming that writings by women and
minorities are underrepresented makes no more
sense than claiming that writings by tall, fat
writers with glasses are underrepresented. The
standard in developing a curriculum should be
content; the concern should be with the diversity
and quality of the ideas to which the students
are exposed rather than with any nonessential
attributes the writers may have.
What made the task force concentrate on the
pseudo-problem of race and gender? And why
do the proposal's opponents concede that this
is the important issue? Why is the debate con
ducted as if nobody recognizes that content
should be the only concern?
If you want to fully understand the basic
issues behind the Western Culture debate, we
recommend studying Ayn Rand. Her philosophy
can help identify and challenge the unidentified
premises that are taken for granted by both
sides and are setting the terms of the debate
The first premise that should be identified
and challenged is the collectivist approach to
ideas. This is the view that sees ideas as the
product not of individual minds but of collec
tives. By this view, our culture was not created
by individuals but by groups such as "the men,"
"the women," "the whites," "the blacks," etc.
Probably very few people at Stanford hold
such a view explicitly, but most intuitively accept
it as the natural way of looking at issues. This
is what lends seeming plausibility to the claim
that women and minorities are under

represented. Rand identified the pervasive in
fluence and results of this collectivist approach
and gave a full, fundamental defense of the
individual nature of ideas and culture.
The second premise that should be challenged
is the view of the study of ideas as a pastime
which may "enrich your mind" but is of no
practical importance. This view makes it
plausible to regard content as an unimportant
issue that may, if necessary, be sacrificed to
other considerations. It also prevents most stu
dents and faculty from realizing the importance
of the whole Western Culture debate.
Rand identified the crucial, practical impor
tance of ideas in life. Man needs a view of
existence and of himself as a basic framework
in which he makes all his specific decisions.
Philosophical ideas provide this framework.
Some people choose and hold philosophical
ideas explicitly; most hold them unknowingly as
attitudes that seem self-evidently natural, ab
sorbed from their high school teachers and from
the media, which in turn have absorbed them
from the universities. These philosophical ideas
ultimately determine every aspect of an in
dividual's life and of the life of a nation, including
their very survival.
The intellectual quality of the university cur
riculum — of the ideas to which students arc
exposed — is not a minor issue with which we
can afford to play games of race and gender
one-upmanship; it is a matter of life-and-death
importance.
