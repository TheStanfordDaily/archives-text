## Exhibition will usher in future of solar energy 
### Thomas Vajda Staff writer 
The Stanford Solar Car Project
will help usher in the future of solar
energy this Sunday by exhibiting
both a simulated solar home and a
solar-powered automobile.
The exhibit, which will take place
at Skilling Auditorium between
noon and 3 p.m., will demonstrate
how solar energy may be used in
the future to provide power for both
household appliances and com
muter automobiles.
General Motors will also contrib
ute to the exhibition by displaying
its solar racecar, Sunßaycer, which
recently won an international solar
powered race in Australia (see
related story).
The Solar Car Project demon
stration will consist of a "simulated
residence" powered by the sun's
rays and a Chevy Chevette con
verted to run on electricity
generated from ordinary commer
cial solar panels.
According to senior David An
derson, a member of the project,
"The purpose of the Solar Car Proj
ect will be to show that you can
use present (solar) technology to
meet energy needs of your house
and automobile."
The electricity-powered Chevette
that will be used in Sunday's dem
onstration made its first appearance
at Stanford last May. The car was
featured in an electrical vehicle
rally held in conjunction with the
University's Centennial Celebra

tion.
Unlike other participants in the
rally, however, the Chevette is
powered entirely by solar-derived
electricity.
The simulated residence is made
up of 11 4-by-8-foot solar panels,
each covered with thousands of
solar cells. These cells convert solar
energy received from the sun's ra
diation into electrical currents.
These currents then charge 12 24-
volt batteries.
An inverter is then used to con
vert the currents from direct to al
ternate currents of 117 volts, the
voltage required by household ap
pliances. "It's the same thing that
you get out of your wall socket,"
Anderson said.
To demonstrate this process, the
exhibition will show the Super Bowl
on a television plugged into these
solar-charged battery packs.
The electricity generated from
these solar panels also powers the
Chevette, whose original gasoline
engine was replaced with an electric
motor and 12 six-volt batteries.
According to John Reuyl, the
Solar Car Project's advisor, the ex
hibition will provide an interesting
juxtaposition of the possibilities for
solar-electric automobiles. While
"the GM Sunßaycer represents the
very top end of solar technology
(and) has little immediate practical
value," the Stanford project, on the
other hand, is "geared to immediate
practicality.... (It) can be done
using off the shelf technology."
Anderson added that the Solar

Car Project is currently more real
istic than the GM project. "Solar
racecars (like the Sunßaycer) won't
be seen on the road."
The Stanford Solar Car Project
was organized in the fall of 1986
by Reuyl.
Reuyl said that while interviewing
students for resident assistant pos
itions at Schiff House, where he
was a resident fellow for several
years, he came across a few who
were "excited about the concept of
a solar house and solar car." With
the help of a few students, he
formed the Solar Car Project.
Today the project consists
primarily of electrical and mechan
ical engineers who have an interest
in what Anderson calls, " 'true en
gineering' — people who are inter
ested in engineering and really want
to apply it."
Much of the group's work this
year has been directed toward
raising funds from various academic
departments and outside organiza
tions.
Members of the Solar Car Project
said they hope Sunday's exhibit will
provide needed exposure and
generate interest and support for
future solar-electric projects. "What
we do in the future will depend in
part on what interest is raised this
weekend," Reuyl said.
He explained that future projects
may include building a directly solar
powered car similar to the GM Sun-
Raycer.
