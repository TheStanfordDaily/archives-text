## U.S. lawyers 'better than ever,' Belli says 
### Angie Kim Staff writer 
"The law keeps the country together, and
lawyers are important; we're better than we
ever were," famed attorney Melvin Belli told
an audience in Branncr Hall last night.
Belli, who has defended clients such as
Jack Ruby and victims of the Union Carbide
chemical leak in Bhopal, India, is currently
representing Jim and Tammy Bakker in their
fight to regain the PTL ministry.
Belli's legal career began in 1933, and since
then he said he has seen the legal profession
change a great deal. "When I got out of law
school at U. of C. (Berkeley), I went into
criminal law and found a fountainhcad of
corruption in the police department,
Sacramento, the city hall, etc.," Belli said.
According to Belli, the San Francisco legal
world used to resemble a "circus filled with
histrionics," rife with bribery and illegal deals
with police officers.
Upon entering the world of litigation, Belli
quickly found that life outside the classroom
was a different experience. He said he ac
cepted several "death row" cases, trying to
win reprieve for kidnappers and murderers

awaiting execution. A few times Belli was
successful, a feeling he likened to "hitting a
home run without a baseball bat."
For many clients awaiting execution,
however, even Belli couldn't win their
reprieve. He recalled that his friendship with
the San Quentin prison chaplain made the
two men the only friends the doomed men
could turn to, and they often reciursted Bclli's
presence at the executions. Belh recounted
his horror at witnessing his first execution,
the hanging of a kidnapper whom Belli said
he "had truly grown to like."
Belli next tried civil law, which he said
was less exciting than criminal law because
most civil cases end in settlements rather
than trials. "A case without a trial is like a
wedding without a first night," he said.
Belli added that he no longer limits himself
to one area of law, and he encouraged all
lawyers to be diverse in their law practice.
"Do a little bit of everything," he advised,
claiming that an "all-around lawyer" will be
most successful in his legal career.
Belli said the introduction of "demonstra
tive evidence" was a big improvement in the
legal system. This method of presenting
evidence to juries was pioneered by Belli

during a particularly famous criminal case.
The case involved a prisoner who, when
allegedly provoked by a knife-throwing fellow
prisoner, "stomped" that prisoner to death.
Although the defendant said he had killed
the prisoner in self-defense, jury-members
were skeptical because they did not believe
the murderer's story about the knife attack.
But Belli brought into court a drawer full
of "hideous knives" confiscated from
prisoners in San Quentin prison. In front of
the jury he "accidentally" stumbled and
dropped the box, thereby spilling the con
tents. By so demonstrating the existence of
such knives, Belli said he erased all doubts
in the minds of the jurors that prisoners
could gain possession of lethal weapons while
in prison.
After this "genesis of demonstrative eviden
ce," Belli applied this technique to civil law
cases, fighting for the right to introduce pic
tures, films, blackboards and positive X-rays
into court as evidence.
"You have to bring realism into the court
by using your imagination," Belli said.
"There's no law against being dramatic, (or
against) playing to emotions and perceptive
senses of jury members," he said. "That's

not unfair."
He said such demonstrative and colorful
use of evidence has now become a "distinctive
branch of law."
Belli also participated in early precedent
setting tort cases, involving large settlements
for personal injury victims.
Called the "king of torts" by Life magazine,
Belli introduced the idea that victims should
sue for emotional suffering and psychological
damages, in addition to claiming material
losses.
"Juries didn't use to give adequate awards
for pain and suffering, and I saw something
wrong with that," he said.
According to Belli, law schools have also
improved over recent years. He noted that
during the early 1900s, law schools taught
only "textbook law," ignoring the develop
ment of students' creativity.
Belli said advertising has helped legal pro
fessionals become better known.
"These ads help not only to make the
lawyers known but also to spread the legal
world into households and such," he said.
"Now family lawyers are becoming a neces
sary part of life, just like family doctors."
