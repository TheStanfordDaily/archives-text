General Motors will come to
Stanford Sunday to exhibit its
solar-powered automobile, Sun-
Raycer, which recently won the
first Pentax World Solar Chal
lenge race in Australia.
The automobile will be on dis
play at Skilling Auditorium be
tween noon and 3 p.m.
Designers of the automobile,
including Howard Wilson, vice
president for GM programs at
GM's Hughes Aircraft subsidiary,
will also be on hand to give a
presentation that will include
video clips of the race.
GM's visit to Stanford is the
result of a joint effort by both
institutions to bring the Sun-
Raycer and its designers to this
campus. Because of GM's success
with the Sunßaycer, members of
the Stanford Solar Car Project
invited the GM to visit the Uni
versity with the solar automobile.
According to John Reuyl, the
Solar Car Project's faculty advis
er, Wilson also expressed interest
in bringing the car to Stanford
and meeting with students' and
faculty.
The Sunraycer's victory in the

Pentax World Solar Race con
sisted of competing against an in
ternational field of solar-powered
automobiles in a race that took
them from one end of Australia
to the other.
Covering over 1880 miles, the
race started from the city of Dar
win in northern Australia, and
finished in Adelaide.
The solar cars raced from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. during the day,

with two hours allowed in the
morning and evening to recharge
batteries with energy from the
sun's radiation.
After posting the top qualifying
speed of 71 mph, the Sunßaycer
claimed the pole position and
easily outran all its competitors.
The Sunßaycer averaged over 40
mph during the course of the race,
finishing 23 hours and 600 miles
ahead of the second place car.
