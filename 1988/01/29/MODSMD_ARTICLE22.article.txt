## Stanford Theater to change format 
### Kelly Brown 
Besides ushering out the final
days of January and the 1987-88
football season, this weekend will
usher out the final days of the Stan
ford Theater â€” at least as we know
it.
The theater, prominently located
on University Avenue in Palo Alto,
has been purchased by the David
and Lucile Packard Foundation and
will be converted into a revival
house, showing works primarily
from the "golden age" of film, the
1930s and "40s.
The theater will close Monday
for restoration and will reopen Fri
day for a five-week festival of "clas
sic" films. The "Festival of Artists"
will honor three directors: Ernest
Lubitsch, Rouben Mamoulian and
Josef von Sternberg.
The transformation of the Stan
ford Theater is being orchestrated
by David W. Packard, son of
Hewlett-Packard founder David
Packard, and the younger Packard's
wife, Pamela.
It all began last July, when the
Packards rented the theater to put
on a film festival honoring Fred
Astaire, who had recently died. The
couple organized a two-week film
series in which they showed As
taire's films with an original carbon
arc projector.
Pamela Packard said she was as
tounded at the positive response to
the Astaire festival. In the 14 days
of the festival, 13,000 tickets were
sold; all profits were donated to
the Children's Hospital at Stanford.
The younger David Packard took
his father to the festival, where
Pamela Packard said her father-in
law was "amazed and overjoyed at
seeing a packed house" and upset
that so many people interested in
these films should have no place to
see them regularly.
Encouraged by over 850 letters
received since the summer, the
Packards tapped the resources of
the Packard Foundation to acquire
the theater.
All of the Hollywood festival films
shown at the new Stanford Theater

will come from the UCLA Film and
Television Archives, which contain
"the best existing prints" of the clas
sic films, Pamela Packard said. All
proceeds from the showing of the
films will go back to the archives.
Pamela Packard said she
regretted that over 50 percent of
films made before 1951 have been
lost due to disintegration. Much of
the work of the experts at the
UCLA archives goes toward trans
ferring old films from fragile nitrate
film stock to a newer, more durable
"safety stock," she explained.
Another goal of the reorganized
theater will be to help in the pre
servation of newsreels, which could
be invaluable to universities for use
in history courses, Pamela Packard
said.
After the five-week Festival of
Artists, the theater will temporarily
close for further remodeling. A

committee is presently working on
the details, but the theater, which
was built around 1924, will most
likely be restored to a '30s decor.
She said more historical research
and consulting must be done before
any conclusions can be reached.
When the theater reopens it will
run films from the '30s and '40s,
including famous Gary Cooper,
Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette
Mac Donald films. Some films will
transcend this era to include classic
actors and actresses such as Audrey
Hepburn and Greta Garbo.
The new Stanford Theater also
hopes to provide director/artist pro
gram notes and lectures to help
viewers learn about films it shows.
Pamela Packard said she hopes the
theater will help to serve the inter
ests of "an intellectual crowd."
She said she believes that many
revival theaters have folded because

they lacked consistency. She ex
plained that many such theaters
have a hard time holding a clientele
because they play '30s movies one
week, then '60s or even '70s movies
the next.
In addition, she said, the films
used in these theaters are often
prints of very poor quality. Prints
of older films tend to be scratched,
with the wrong aspect ratio and
with badly damaged sound tracks,
she said. However, Pamela Pack
ard promised that the new Stanford
Theater will be showing all 35mm
films of the highest possible quality.
There will be an opening night
ceremony at the theater at 7 p.m.
Friday, featuring a display of an
tique cars. Tickets for the upcoming
festival are $4 for a double feature.
The Stanford Theater is located
at 221 University Ave. in downtown
Palo Alto.
