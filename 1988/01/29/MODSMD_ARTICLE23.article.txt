# City dancing

### James Lujan Editorial staff 
So, ypu're a guy, and you've
got nothing to do on a Friday
night. You get together with
three other guys who have noth
ing to do and decide to hit the
City â€” you call it "boys' night
out."
Well, I've had a few nights
like that, but I haven't been
going to these dance places lately
to have fun. No, I've been going
for purely journalistic purposes.
1 thought it might make a good
story to give the lowdown on
Bay Area nightclubs that feature
mainstream dance music.
San Francisco has quite a few
interesting nightclubs with DJ
dance music. Wolfgang's used to
be a good place for meeting
people, but it suffered a major
fire over the summer.
Speaking of getting burned,
there's a club called City Nights
(715 Harrison St.) that has some
good music and a good dance
floor; however, during my inves
tigation, I found that for the
most part, the patrons had a
negative reaction to the ques
tions I posed.
While there, the only quotes
I could draw out of various mem
bers of the opposite gender were:
"No, thanks, I'm with someone";
"Sorry, I'm waiting for a friend";
and "How much money you
got?"
A slightly friendlier crowd
hangs out at Mirage (3394 22nd
Ave.). The only problem is that
there's a big cover charge and
a small dance floor. But they
play some pretty decent dance
music.
If you like the funked-out,
neo-disco, KSOL-type of dance
music, The Palladium (1031
Kearny St.) is a good place to
go. I liked the place because
they let you dance until 6 a.m.,
which was something I used to

do when I was younger.
If you and a date have just
come from the prom, might I
suggest you go to Oz, on top of
the St. Francis hotel. When my
buddies and I first went there
and heard Madonna dance music
as we walked out of the elevator,
we were expecting a run-of-the
mill, hotel-type dance club.

However, we were taken aback
to see a fortysomething crowd
decked out in tuxedos and se
quined dresses. We wisely
decided not to enter the es
tablishment when we saw a sign
that said, "Non-members: $15."
Another place we didn't go
into was Club 412 (412 Broad
way). From the outside it looked
like a routine dance place. Plus,
it was late, and we were feeling
too cheap for the $8 cover
charge.
For some inexplicable reason,
one of my pals likes to hang out
at this little Japanese place
called the Kanzaki Lounge (1705
Buchanan St.) in Japantown. He
says he likes the place because
of the bands. True, the live bands
are OK if you like to hear Asian
bands playing American rock
music, but there's absolutely no
way to meet people there.
Finally, one spot I want to
investigate further is a place on
top of 1 Embarcadero Center
called Channel's. It's got dance
able dance music, an interesting
crowd and, when I was there,
no cover.
