## Stanford hoops stomps the Beavers Big men Butler and Wright combine for 46 points 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — With five minutes to
go, the score was tied at 63, the 7000 Beaver
faithful were on their feet, and Gary Payton,
the brash, bald-headed Oregon State point
guard, looked as if he could conquer the world.
You wouldn't have known it by the final score.
When the buzzer sounded, Payton was on the
bench, out of the game with five fouls, and the
Cardinal had won by a whopping 13 points,
78-65. It was a picture-perfect ending for a
near-perfect game by Stanford that gave the
Cardinal its first Pacific 10 Conference road win
of the year.
Combined with Arizona State and Washington
State losses last night, the Stanford win leaves
the Cardinal in sole posession of second place
in the Pac-10, with a league record of 5-3.
Stanford's overall record moves to 13-6.
"In a nutshell, Stanford did what it had to
do to win, period," Oregon State Coach Ralph
Miller said, "The best team won."
What the Cardinal did was make a
phenemonal 28 of 40 shots from the field (a
.700 percentage), sink 19-20 free throws for a
new Gill Coliseum record and outrebound the
Beavers 30-14.
The field-goal percentage was so good
primarily because the Cardinal took most of its
shots from within 10 feet of the basket. Taking
advantage of defenders four and five inches
shorter than them, Stanford center Greg Butler
and power forward Howard Wright took 26 of
the team's 40 shots and combined for 46 points.
Following the big men in the scoring category
were Todd Lichti with 15 and Taylor with 12.
The two guards were the only other Stanford
players to reach double figures. The foursome
accounted for 73 of the Cardinal's 78 points.
Together Wright and Butler scored the Car
dinal's first 12 points of the game, as it quickly

became apparent that the short, quick Beavers
were helpless once the ball got inside.
"That was about as badly as we've been
whipped inside this year," Miller said.
"OSU is very quick; they create a lot of prob
lems with their quickness when you try to bring
the ball up the floor," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "If we had an advantage, we
knew it would have to be with our big people."
Stanford's big men clearly won the battle, and
the Cardinal guards did a good job of controlling
the ball and getting it inside, but until the final
five minutes, Oregon State's hustle and pressure
defense were enough to keep the Beavers in
the game.

'I knew when I shot it, it was
going to go in. It took the
crowd out.'

At the half, the Cardinal was down 35-34,
largely due to 14 points in 14 minutes by Payton,
who sat out the final six minutes of the half
after picking up his third foul.
With 10 minutes gone in the second stanza,
Stanford had built a six-point lead that looked
like it might last. But the veteran Miller, one
of the most successful coaches in the nation,
still had a little something up his sleeve.
He called a timeout and brought in all 7-1,
285 pounds of Johan Reinalda, a rarely used
reserve center from the Netherlands, and an
obvious crowd favorite. Up to that moment,
Reinalda had seen only one minute of Pac-10
action this season. For a couple of minutes,
Reinalda's defense was effective in the middle,
and the Beavers stormed back to a 63-63 tie.
"I was kind of surprised they didn't bring him
in earlier. They were obviously having a little
bit of trouble inside," Butler said.

Reinalda's spark was, however, only tempo
rary. Once the score was tied, Stanford
responded. Cardinal guard Taylor hit a 3-
pointer. His trademark fist went in the air, the
Beaver crowd was silenced, and Stanford was
off to the races.
"I knew when I shot it, it was going to go
in,"the sharp-shooting guard said. "It took the
crowd out of it more than anything."
Payton, who finished with a career-high-tying
22 points, tried to answer with another "trey,"
but the shot was short. Wright scored from the
line and then the field. He was followed by
Butler, whose short jump shot gave Stanford a
72-63 advantage with 1:25 to go.
Payton scored a layup with 1:13 left to give
the Beavers their only basket of the the game's
final five minutes. Payton fouled out 30 seconds
later, leaving the Beavers without much of a
chance.
Although Montgomery said he thought his
team was "a little bit flat defensively" on the
night, he added that the defensive effort in the
final minutes was as good as possible. As Oregon
State rushed to get back in the game, it simply
found nothing there.
"All of a sudden we kind of just regrouped
as a team," Butler said. "Everyone picked up
the intensity; we just played a little harder."
The win was Montgomery's first over Oregon
State since coming to Stanford last year. Until
last night, the Beavers were the only Pac-10
team Montgomery hadn't beaten.
Returning to action in the game was Cardinal
forward Andrew Vlahov, who had missed the
team's last eight games because of loose cartilage
in his left knee. Still recovering, Vlahov logged
two minutes and grabbed one rebound at the
end of the first half.
The next stop for the Cardinal is Eugene,
where the team will take on the Oregon Ducks
Saturday. The 7:35 p.m. game will be broadcast
by both' KZSU and KCBS radio.

The two guards were the only other Stanford
players to reach double figures. The foursome
accounted for 73 of the Cardinal's 78 points.
Together Wright and Butler scored the Car
dinal's first 12 points of the game, as it quickly

became apparent that the short, quick Beavers
were helpless once the ball got inside.
"That was about as badly as we've been
whipped inside this year," Miller said.
"OSU is very quick; they create a lot of prob
lems with their quickness when you try to bring
the ball up the floor," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "If we had an advantage, we
knew it would have to be with our big people."
Stanford's big men clearly won the battle, and
the Cardinal guards did a good job of controlling
the ball and getting it inside, but until the final
five minutes, Oregon State's hustle and pressure
defense were enough to keep the Beavers in
the game.

'I knew when I shot it, it was
going to go in. It took the
crowd out.'

At the half, the Cardinal was down 35-34,
largely due to 14 points in 14 minutes by Payton,
who sat out the final six minutes of the half
after picking up his third foul.
With 10 minutes gone in the second stanza,
Stanford had built a six-point lead that looked
like it might last. But the veteran Miller, one
of the most successful coaches in the nation,
still had a little something up his sleeve.
He called a timeout and brought in all 7-1,
285 pounds of Johan Reinalda, a rarely used
reserve center from the Netherlands, and an
obvious crowd favorite. Up to that moment,
Reinalda had seen only one minute of Pac-10
action this season. For a couple of minutes,
Reinalda's defense was effective in the middle,
and the Beavers stormed back to a 63-63 tie.
"I was kind of surprised they didn't bring him
in earlier. They were obviously having a little
bit of trouble inside," Butler said.

Reinalda's spark was, however, only tempo
rary. Once the score was tied, Stanford
responded. Cardinal guard Taylor hit a 3-
pointer. His trademark fist went in the air, the
Beaver crowd was silenced, and Stanford was
off to the races.
"I knew when I shot it, it was going to go
in,"the sharp-shooting guard said. "It took the
crowd out of it more than anything."
Payton, who finished with a career-high-tying
22 points, tried to answer with another "trey,"
but the shot was short. Wright scored from the
line and then the field. He was followed by
Butler, whose short jump shot gave Stanford a
72-63 advantage with 1:25 to go.
Payton scored a layup with 1:13 left to give
the Beavers their only basket of the the game's
final five minutes. Payton fouled out 30 seconds
later, leaving the Beavers without much of a
chance.
Although Montgomery said he thought his
team was "a little bit flat defensively" on the
night, he added that the defensive effort in the
final minutes was as good as possible. As Oregon
State rushed to get back in the game, it simply
found nothing there.
"All of a sudden we kind of just regrouped
as a team," Butler said. "Everyone picked up
the intensity; we just played a little harder."
The win was Montgomery's first over Oregon
State since coming to Stanford last year. Until
last night, the Beavers were the only Pac-10
team Montgomery hadn't beaten.
Returning to action in the game was Cardinal
forward Andrew Vlahov, who had missed the
team's last eight games because of loose cartilage
in his left knee. Still recovering, Vlahov logged
two minutes and grabbed one rebound at the
end of the first half.
The next stop for the Cardinal is Eugene,
where the team will take on the Oregon Ducks
Saturday. The 7:35 p.m. game will be broadcast
by both' KZSU and KCBS radio.

Point guard Terry Taylor hit a 3-pointer last night with five minutes
left to spark Stanford to a game-ending 15-2 run and a 78-65 win.
CORVALLIS, Ore. — With five minutes to
go, the score was tied at 63, the 7000 Beaver
faithful were on their feet, and Gary Payton,
the brash, bald-headed Oregon State point
guard, looked as if he could conquer the world.
You wouldn't have known it by the final score.
When the buzzer sounded, Payton was on the
bench, out of the game with five fouls, and the
Cardinal had won by a whopping 13 points,
78-65. It was a picture-perfect ending for a
near-perfect game by Stanford that gave the
Cardinal its first Pacific 10 Conference road win
of the year.
Combined with Arizona State and Washington
State losses last night, the Stanford win leaves
the Cardinal in sole posession of second place
in the Pac-10, with a league record of 5-3.
Stanford's overall record moves to 13-6.
"In a nutshell, Stanford did what it had to
do to win, period," Oregon State Coach Ralph
Miller said, "The best team won."
What the Cardinal did was make a
phenemonal 28 of 40 shots from the field (a
.700 percentage), sink 19-20 free throws for a
new Gill Coliseum record and outrebound the
Beavers 30-14.
The field-goal percentage was so good
primarily because the Cardinal took most of its
shots from within 10 feet of the basket. Taking
advantage of defenders four and five inches
shorter than them, Stanford center Greg Butler
and power forward Howard Wright took 26 of
the team's 40 shots and combined for 46 points.
Following the big men in the scoring category
were Todd Lichti with 15 and Taylor with 12.
