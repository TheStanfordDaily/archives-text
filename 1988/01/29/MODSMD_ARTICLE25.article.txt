# Cardinal nine kicks off season
## 
### Chris Myers Editorial staff 
Stanford baseball fans will get a taste
of the new and a taste of the old this
weekend.
Two things are new: the 1988 edition
of the Cardinal, which begins defense of
its NCAA championship at 2 p.m. today
against Santa Clara at Sunken Diamond;
and the Bud D. Klein Varsity Clubhouse,
which will make the diamond an even
more glorious place to watch ballgamcs.
And for longtime Cardinal fans who
yearn for days past, there's the old: tomor
row's alumni game featuring numerous
former Stanford stars now playing profes
sional baseball. A three-inning oldtimers
game will begin at noon, followed at 1:30
p.m. by a nine-inning game between the
current Stanford team and an alumni
squad. Admission is free and autographs
will be available after both games.
The new clubhouse was built with
money donated by Bud Klein, Class of
1950, a Stockton resident, and his four
children, Kathryn, Tom, Dick and Steve.
The facility, located along the first-base
line, includes locker rooms for both teams,
a central meeting room, coaches' offices,
equipment room, public restrooms and a
snack bar.
It also includes ticket offices and a gate
that will make the stands more accessible
to handicapped spectators and will also
ease the long lines and snarled traffic
experienced in the past whenever a large
crowd came out for a ballgame.
The new clubhouse will be enjoyed by
,a. lot of old Stanford players tomorrow.
Professionals playing in the alumni game
include Mike Aldrete of the San Francisco

Giants; 1987 Cardinal pitching ace Jack
McDowell, now of the Chicago White
Sox; Jeff Ballard and Pete Stanicek, both
of the Baltimore Orioles; and Paul Zuvella
of the Cleveland Indians.
Also scheduled to play are two other
members of last year's championship team
— pitcher AI Osuna, now in the Houston
Astros organization, and shortstop David
Esquer, now with the Orioles — as well
as Walt Harris, also in the Orioles or
ganization, Mark Davis (White Sox), Rick
Lundblade (Philadelphia Phillies), John
Ramos (New York Yankees) and Eric
Hardgrave (San Diego Padres).
The alumni game falls between two
games against Santa Clara. Sunday's game
is scheduled for noon at Buck Shaw
Stadium in Santa Clara. However, the
field there is still damp because of poor
drainage, so there is some possibility that
the Sunday game also will be played at
Sunken Diamond. Game time is noon,
regardless of the site.
Stanford and Santa Clara met five times
last year, with the Cardinal taking all five
games. The Broncos, members of the West
Coast Athletic Conference, were 25-30-2
last season.
Senior right-hander Lee Plemcl will
start for the Cardinal today. Plemel was
9-5 with a 3.65 earned run average and
90 strikeouts last year. He and the other
Cardinal pitchers probably will throw only
three or four innings each, said pitching
coach Tom Dunton.
Freshman right-hander Mike Mussina
will get the call on Sunday for the Car
dinal.
Santa Clara will counter with ace Wes
Bliven on Friday and Victor Cole on Sun
day. Blivcn, a senior right-hander, was

7-6 last year with a 4.02 ERA.
Cole, a junior righty, was 6-5 with a 5.23
ERA.
As Stanford begins its quest to return
to the College World Series, the team
will face not only a tough Pacific 10 Con
ference and non-league schedule, but also
the high expectations of fans and players
alike.
"I think there's a lot of pressure on us
because we won the national champion
ship," junior pitcher Steve Chitren said.
"People are going to expect a lot of things
from us."
Last year the team stumbled early,
going 11-8 and 0-2 in the Pac-10 before
coming back to run away from the con
ference field, cruise through the West I
Regional and win the College World Se
ries in Omaha, Neb.
Defending the NCAA title presents a
special challenge. "You never know how
a team will respond," said Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess. "We're proud of what
we accomplished last year; but that was
last year. Some teams have a tendency
to become complacent and not work hard
the next year."
But the players downplay the possibility
of complacency. "We had a bad, bad start
last year," said junior second baseman
Frank Carey. "If we start out that way
this year, everyone will say we're com
placent ... but I don't think that's going
to be a problem. The intensity's going to
be there."
Senior catcher Doug Robbins agreed.
"When you win a lot, you get this feeling
— it's just a great feeling," he said. "Once
you get a taste of that, it's almost an
addiction."

The new clubhouse will be enjoyed by
,a. lot of old Stanford players tomorrow.
Professionals playing in the alumni game
include Mike Aldrete of the San Francisco

Giants; 1987 Cardinal pitching ace Jack
McDowell, now of the Chicago White
Sox; Jeff Ballard and Pete Stanicek, both
of the Baltimore Orioles; and Paul Zuvella
of the Cleveland Indians.
Also scheduled to play are two other
members of last year's championship team
— pitcher AI Osuna, now in the Houston
Astros organization, and shortstop David
Esquer, now with the Orioles — as well
as Walt Harris, also in the Orioles or
ganization, Mark Davis (White Sox), Rick
Lundblade (Philadelphia Phillies), John
Ramos (New York Yankees) and Eric
Hardgrave (San Diego Padres).
The alumni game falls between two
games against Santa Clara. Sunday's game
is scheduled for noon at Buck Shaw
Stadium in Santa Clara. However, the
field there is still damp because of poor
drainage, so there is some possibility that
the Sunday game also will be played at
Sunken Diamond. Game time is noon,
regardless of the site.
Stanford and Santa Clara met five times
last year, with the Cardinal taking all five
games. The Broncos, members of the West
Coast Athletic Conference, were 25-30-2
last season.
Senior right-hander Lee Plemcl will
start for the Cardinal today. Plemel was
9-5 with a 3.65 earned run average and
90 strikeouts last year. He and the other
Cardinal pitchers probably will throw only
three or four innings each, said pitching
coach Tom Dunton.
Freshman right-hander Mike Mussina
will get the call on Sunday for the Car
dinal.
Santa Clara will counter with ace Wes
Bliven on Friday and Victor Cole on Sun
day. Blivcn, a senior right-hander, was

7-6 last year with a 4.02 ERA.
Cole, a junior righty, was 6-5 with a 5.23
ERA.
As Stanford begins its quest to return
to the College World Series, the team
will face not only a tough Pacific 10 Con
ference and non-league schedule, but also
the high expectations of fans and players
alike.
"I think there's a lot of pressure on us
because we won the national champion
ship," junior pitcher Steve Chitren said.
"People are going to expect a lot of things
from us."
Last year the team stumbled early,
going 11-8 and 0-2 in the Pac-10 before
coming back to run away from the con
ference field, cruise through the West I
Regional and win the College World Se
ries in Omaha, Neb.
Defending the NCAA title presents a
special challenge. "You never know how
a team will respond," said Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess. "We're proud of what
we accomplished last year; but that was
last year. Some teams have a tendency
to become complacent and not work hard
the next year."
But the players downplay the possibility
of complacency. "We had a bad, bad start
last year," said junior second baseman
Frank Carey. "If we start out that way
this year, everyone will say we're com
placent ... but I don't think that's going
to be a problem. The intensity's going to
be there."
Senior catcher Doug Robbins agreed.
"When you win a lot, you get this feeling
— it's just a great feeling," he said. "Once
you get a taste of that, it's almost an
addiction."

Stanford baseball fans will get a taste
of the new and a taste of the old this
weekend.
Two things are new: the 1988 edition
of the Cardinal, which begins defense of
its NCAA championship at 2 p.m. today
against Santa Clara at Sunken Diamond;
and the Bud D. Klein Varsity Clubhouse,
which will make the diamond an even
more glorious place to watch ballgamcs.
And for longtime Cardinal fans who
yearn for days past, there's the old: tomor
row's alumni game featuring numerous
former Stanford stars now playing profes
sional baseball. A three-inning oldtimers
game will begin at noon, followed at 1:30
p.m. by a nine-inning game between the
current Stanford team and an alumni
squad. Admission is free and autographs
will be available after both games.
The new clubhouse was built with
money donated by Bud Klein, Class of
1950, a Stockton resident, and his four
children, Kathryn, Tom, Dick and Steve.
The facility, located along the first-base
line, includes locker rooms for both teams,
a central meeting room, coaches' offices,
equipment room, public restrooms and a
snack bar.
It also includes ticket offices and a gate
that will make the stands more accessible
to handicapped spectators and will also
ease the long lines and snarled traffic
experienced in the past whenever a large
crowd came out for a ballgame.
