# Beavers, Ducks come to Maples
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Believe it or not, there may be
something on campus more exciting
than senior casino night this eve
ning, as the Stanford women's bas
ketball team hosts Oregon at 7:30
p.m. at Maples Pavilion in what
could be the most pivotal game in
the Cardinal's quest for the Pacific
10 Conference crown. The action
will be broadcast on KZSU and on
X-TV.
Oregon State comes to the Farm
Saturday, after facing a California
squad Stanford defeated last
weekend at Berkeley in a 95-71 de
cision. The Beavers are currently
in fifth place in the Pac-10 with a
3-3 conference record and 8-8 over
all, one place ahead of the Ducks
at 9-7 overall and 2-4 in league.
By contrast, Stanford currently
enjoys a 16-1 mark (3-1 in the Pac
-10), good enough to secure for the
Cardinal the No. 10 spot in the
Associated Press poll and second
place in the league behind USC
and Washington. The squad's only
loss came at the hands of the No.
11 Huskies two weeks ago at
Seattle.
Since Oregon last week came
within one point of the Huskies,
losing 68-67 in Eugene, the Cardi
nal will have its hands full.
Bolstered by its twin towers of 6-

foot-7 ccnter Stephanie Kasperski
and 6-3 forward Kris Glidden, the
Ducks will be a sizable opponent.
"This is a big weekend when you
see who's coming to town," Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDervccr said.
"Oregon has a very big team. They
were up by 13 last weekend against
Washington with 10 minutes to go,
so we know they're a tough team."
Leading the charge was
Kasperski, a sophomore from West
Germany, who tops the Ducks in
scoring with 15.3 points per game
and leads the nation with an in
credible 4.2 blocked shots per game.
Moreover, she boasts an unprece
dented 13 blocks in one game ear
lier this season.
"I'm going to have to use my
quickness on her and use a lot of
fakes because she's the leading
shot-blocker in the country," said
Stanford center Jill Yanke, who will
be matched up with the Husky
sophomore for most of the evening.
"When I get the ball, I need to
fake or else beat her down the
court."
Though Kasperski and her team
mates got the upper hand last year,
a much-improved Yanke is ready
to turn the tables. "I remember
that she was a shot-blocker but that
I could score over her; I was capable
of that. I know she's improved, so
I don't know what the matchup will
be like, but I know I can score over

her if 1 work hard," she said.
With this parity on the inside,
the game will probably be decided
on the perimeter, which gives Stan
ford a big advantage. The Cardinal
is currently ranked eighth in the
nation in three-point field goals
made and boasts the 12th-ranked
individual in that category, sopho
more point guard Jennifer Azzi. In
addition, Stanford has one of the
tallest three-point shooters in 6-0
spohomore forward Katy Steding.

'I'm going to have to
use my quickness on
her and use a lot of
fakes because she's the
leading shot-blocker in
the country.'

Another outside weapon arose
last week in senior reserve guard
Charli Turner. Last weekend at Cal,
Turner let one fly that was officially
just shy of the three-point range,
hut if her practice-shooting this
werk is any indication, she could
do some serious offensive damage
to the sitting Ducks.
'They don't come out on the
thi e-point shooters, so we look to

take the three-point shot," Turner
said. "We'll beat the zone up the
floor, and if we can get it inside
we'll look to get their girls in foul
trouble. We're just going to play
our game, and we should be able
to beat them."
"The biggest thing I think is the
offensive boards," Turner added.
"We need to go to the offensive
boards, and we need to keep them
off the boards."
Although Oregon State is a
smaller and quicker team than
Oregon, the Cardinal will probably
also prevail over the pesky Beavers.
Coming off victories against scrappy
California and San Jose State
teams, the Cardinal will be ready
for a fast-paced game.
"Oregon State is just the flipside
of Oregon," VanDcrvccr said.
"They are a smaller, quicker team.
They trap, they press and they have
the leading scorer in the league."
That's junior guard Chelle
Flamoe, who is averaging 21.5
points per game. Coupled with
freshman center Kari Parriott's 14.8
points per game, this scoring level
makes Oregon State a headache for
the opposing team's defense.
"They play a very young line up,
but they're very aggressive defen
sively," the Cardinal coach added.
"It's going to be a tough game.
We're really going to have to work
hard and play well back-to-back."


Freshman Trisha Stevens has started 15 straight games for the Cardinal
and is averaging nine points and Five rebounds a game.
