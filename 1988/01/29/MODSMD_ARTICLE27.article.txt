# Spikers at UCSB

### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
Remember when Luke
Skywalkcr was pushed into
taking responsibility for the
"good side" at the ripe young
age of 18? Fortunately for all of
humanity, he came through with
flying colors — by using the
force.
It seems as though Stanford's
young volleyball team will need
something at least as strong as
the force if they are to be suc
cessful this weekend against two
of the best squads in the country.
The Cardinal opens league
play tonight against the No. 2
UCLA Bruins at Pauley Pavilion,
and then must make the long
trek to UC-Santa Barbara to play
the No.B Gauchos Saturday.
"I'd like to see us side-out
well," Stanford Head Coach
Fred Sturm said. "We'll go
through spells where we don't
score points. I just want us to
be able to stay in the matches."
The Bruins will certainly press
that goal to the limit. UCLA
boasts one of the best front lines
in the country, anchored by All-
America middle blocker Don
Deninger. A club team from
Manitoba, Canada, found that
out the hard way, getting stuffed
13 times in the fifth game of the
championship match in last
weekend's tournament at Santa
Barbara. And Deninger wasn't
playing.
"We expect him (Deninger)
to be on the floor tomorrow
night," Sturm said. "We're pre
paring to play against a UCLA
team that includes the big middle

blocker."
The Cardinal will have more
than just the Bruins' front line
to worry about, however. UCLA
also has one of America's best
setters in Matt Sonnichsen. He
will key the rugged Bruin offense
— an offense Sturm and his
players know will be tough to
handle.
"We've got to try and serve
them out of their offense," Sturm
said. "We'll also have to make
some changes in how we block."
Sophomore Dan Hanan
agreed. "At Santa Barbara a lot
of teams ran plays that confused
our blockers. We'll have to be
more ready against UCLA," he
said.
A win against UCLA would
be especially sweet for Sturm,
maybe even more so than for
the players. Sturm once played
under UCLA Coach A 1 Skates,
who has led the Bruins to 12
national titles in the past 18
years.
Regardless of tonight's out
come, Stanford will have to work
hard mentally to get ready for
a Santa Barbara team that Sturm
says is "better than its No.B na
tional ranking."
The Gauchos are led by setter
Tim Wallace and outside hitter
David Rottman. Rottman, at 6-
foot-4, is a bona fide All-
America candidate. Wallace
would likely be a first team all
league choice if not for the pres
ence of Sonnichsen.
"Neither match this weekend
is clearly easier than the other,"
Sturm said. "Santa Barbara is a
very, very good team. And we are
playing them after having played
the Bruins in L.A. 24 hours earlier."
Although the Cardinal is the un
derdog in both matches this
weekend, do not count them out
too quickly. The team has had a
fine week of practice and has a

good attitude heading into league
play. Junior Dave Johnson, sopho
more Parker Blackman and fresh
man John Alstrom have made
especially notable improvement in
practice thus far.
"Like any coach, I look at wins
and losses," Sturm said, "but my
main focus right now is on improve
ment. I just want the men to play
steady, consistent volleyball."
Maybe they should use the force,
as well.
