# Men's swimmers travel to Dallas

### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Now that the men's swimming
team has proven it is a champion
ship caliber squad, its talent is about
to be tested.
Coming off a sweep of nationally
ranked Arizona State, the Cardinal
is sending its top swimmers to com
pete against the best in the nation
at the Dallas Morning News Classic
this weekend. Stanford's top eight

competitiors clash with the best of
Texas, Southern Methodist, Califor
nia, Florida and Michigan, the
other leading collegiate swim teams,
tonight and tomorrow night at
SMU. The remainder of the Car
dinal squad will host the Santa
Clara Swim Club and the San Jose
Aquatics Saturday at 11 a.m.

John Witchel, backstrokcr Jay Mor
tenson, backstroker Matt Nance,

freestyler/butterflier Doug Lil
lydahl, freestyler Byron Burson and
breaststroker Matt Rodgers are
representing the Cardinal in Dallas.
"Because of the competition and
atmosphere it is one of the most
fun meets of the year," Mosse said.
The meet contains all NCAA
championship events and is the only
time the squad will swim all official
races until the Pacific 10 Confer
ence meet in March. However, un
like the championships, trials and

finals are not held. Instead, each
event consists of a championship
and consolation heat, and one
swimmer represents each team in
each race. Each racer competes in
three events â€” two individual races
and a relay.
"It is one of the best preparations
for the end of the season meets
(Pac-10 and NCAA champion
ships). I wish the entire team could
go," Murphy said.
According to the participants,
having only eight members on each
squad creates a very tight team at
mosphere that heightens the com
petitiveness of the meet. "It feels
more like you are on a basketball
team than a swim team," Murphy
said.
Even though the meet brings to
gether the best swimmers in the
nation, NCAA qualifying times are
not usually recorded because each
participant has to swim so many
races. In addition, according to
Mortenson, the timing of the meet
is not conducive to peak times.
Teams are just entering the most
important phase of the season, and
it is difficult to swim fast right now.
With the top six teams from last
year's NCAA finals competing, the
meet will probably be very close.
However, the Cardinal is super
stitious about winning the compe
tition. For the past four years, the
squad that has been victorious in
the Classic has not won the NCAA
championships.
According to Mosse, when the
meet first started the Cardinal
treated it seriously but now just
uses the competition as a stepping
stone to the NCAAs. The squad
uses the meet as a preview for the
championships, because the swim
mers in this meet are usually the
