# No. 4 Arizona State comes to deGuerre
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Despite a damp weather forecast for today,
the Sun will indeed be visible at deGuerre
Pool.
The Arizona State Sun Devil women's
swimming team faces Stanford today at 2
p.m., and although Arizona State is currently
ranked fourth and is 5-0 this season, the
prognosis for the visitors is not too bright.
The Cardinal comes in with a No. 2 na
tional ranking and a 4-0 record. Stanford has
also been swimming very well lately, having
buried both UCLA and USC on the road
last week.
"It should definitely be a good meet," said
sophomore breaststroker Jill Johnson. "I
think we're going to be really psyched."
Johnson and her fellow breaststrokers are
going to have their hands full against two of
the top swimmmers in the nation in that
event — sophomore Susie Mortenson and
freshman Jenny Hau. Mortenson, a Santa
Clara native, is the Sun Devils' only returning
scorer from last year's NCAA meet, at which
she took 12th in the 100-yard breast.
Hau, another local from Campbell, is even
better. She set the deGuerre Pool record in
a high school meet her sophomore year (the
record — 1:02.66 — still stands), and her
best time is faster than any in either Arizona
State or Stanford history. She is also a three
time U.S. champion in the 100.

"It'll be a tough meet," Mortenson said.
"We're going to go in there and swim our
best."
"We've got a lot of good people on our
team this year," she added. "We haven't lost
a meet, either."
Johnson isn't the only swimmer who will
oppose Hau and Mortenson, however, in this
battle of perhaps the two best breaststroke
corps in the nation. Three Cardinal swimmers
have already qualified for the NCAAs in that
event. In addition to Johnson, Stanford boasts
the talent of sophomore Bethanne Lambert
and junior Susan Lenth. The three earned
a total of five top-12 finishes in the two
breaststroke events at last year's NCAAs.
"I think we can definately rise to the oc
casion (against the two)," Johnson said. "It's
amazing what can come out (against great
competition)."
Stanford is loaded in every other event, as
well. The Cardinal has the top two sprint
freestylers from last season in juniors Jenna
Johnson and Aimee Berzins.
"They're a good team," Berzins said, "I
think it's a good opportunity to swim fast."
The Cardinal swims against top-ranked
Texas next week, but the Stanford swimmers
don't expect that to be much of a distraction.
"We know that Texas is next week," Berzins
added, "but we're going to take it one week
at a time. Texas is just in the back of our
minds."
Stanford's backstrokers are also probably

the best in the country. Junior Michelle
Donahue and sophomore Susannah Miller
both qualified in the 200 back last weekend
as the Cardinal backstrokers dominated both
the Bruins and the Trojans. Senior distance
freestyler Stacy Shupe has also made NCAA
cuts, along with Jenna Johnson and divers
Katie Connors and Leslie Kleinheksel.
"It's a real relief (to have made cuts),"
Miller said. "Now I can concentrate on the
200 IM." Because of a rule just adopted by

the NCAA, a swimmer who makes one cut
can swim three different events at the NCAA
meet. Thus, the swimmers who have already
qualified can work on strengthening their
other events as well.
Another plus for the Cardinal is the success
the diving squad has had lately. After scoring
one-two-three sweeps off both boards at USC
Saturday, the divers are set for another strong

Stacy Shupe has already qualified for the NCAA championships and will lead the Cardinal
distance freestyle corps today against Arizona State.
meet.
"We had the best weekend we've
ever had," Connors said. The soph
omore All-American went on to cite
the closeness of this year's team.
"(The swimmers) are really en
couraging," she said, adding that
this boosts her confidence when
she's on the board.
Stanford continues against a
deadly schedule the next few weeks.
After No. 4 Arizona State today
and No. 1 Texas next Saturday at

deGuerre, the Cardinal hosts No.
3 California the following weekend.
"Our main goal is to get faster
every time," Jill Johnson said. "It
gives training a focus. You just go
out there and swim as well as you
can every time."
Miller said she thinks the team
is doing just that and will be ready
for these tough meets. "We seem
to be getting better each week,"
she said. "Everyone's getting shar
per.
Berzins agreed. "Every meet we
go into, we're looking to go forward,
working on little things."
And that can only mean trouble
for everyone else.
