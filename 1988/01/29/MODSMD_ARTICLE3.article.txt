# Incinerator gets safety exemption
## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Stanford University will tempo
rarily be permitted to operate the
waste incinerator at its Environ
mental Safety Facility without a
scrubber, a regional environmental
agency ruled yesterday.
The inoperative scrubber —
which is supposed to filter hydrogen
chloride from the smoke produced
by the incinerator — has become
a center of recent controversy con
cerning health and safety at Stan
ford.
The Bay Area Air Quality Man
agement District granted Stanford
permission in the form of a retroac
tive variance valid from Nov. 23,
1987 until Feb. 12, 1988. Yester
day's variance was the fourth
granted to Stanford as a result of
scrubber malfunctions in less than
a year.
The incinerator is used to destroy
potentially infectious waste from
Stanford Hospital. The faulty scrub
ber was installed last February.
Complaints concerning health
and safety at Stanford were initially
brought up in a Dec. 9 letter sent
to University President Donald
Kennedy from Jon Moldestad, an
operations manager in the Univer
sity's department of Health and
Safety.
Moldestad charged that the Uni

versity has problems with safety
mismanagement and cited specific
instances of employee intimidation
concerning these matters. These al
legations prompted the University
in December to quietly begin an
investigation of safety practices at
various University facilities.
According to University Director
of Health and Safety Alain Decleve,
the incinerator can operate without
the scrubber at "non-hazardous
levels."
Toby Sherwood, assistant counsel
for the Air Quality District, sup
ported Decleve's assertion. Even
without the scrubber, the in
cinerator is still "one of the cleanest
and most efficient hospital in
cinerators in our district," Sher
wood told the district's Hearing
Board at a hearing yesterday.
Hearing Board member Thomas
Ferrito said the scrubber's various
malfunctions appear to be unre
lated but that their causes might
include bad management, poor
design or poor construction.
Curtis Williams, University direc
tor of Facilities, said all three prob
lems have contributed to the scrub
ber malfunctions. "The primary
problem has been that there has
not been a lot of development of
air pollution control equipment,
and historically there is a pretty
significant learning curve," he said.
According to Williams, the scrub
ber was not specifically designed to
accompany the incinerator. He said
that the incinerator manufacturer
and the University chose this par
ticular scrubber because they felt
it was compatible with the system
as a whole.
Williams said the problems are
not due to a mismatch of the two
elements of the system and that the
manufacturer was conscientious in
choosing the scrubber.
However, problems have been
discovered with the construction of

the facility. "We have found things
that were not of the quality we
would have wanted," Williams said.
According to Williams, the con
tractor is now repairing the defects
at no charge to the University.
The scrubber operated for 45
minutes Wednesday, but a power
failure occurred when it was being
shut down. Williams said the cause
of the failure is unknown and that
the scrubber may not be at fault.
The problem did cause the Uni
versity to alter its request to the
hearing board, Williams said. Prior
to Wednesday's problem, Stanford
was seeking only a four-day vari
ance. Ultimately, however, the Uni
versity sought and was granted the
variance until Feb. 12.
