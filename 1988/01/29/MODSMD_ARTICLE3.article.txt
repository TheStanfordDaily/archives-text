# Incinerator gets safety exemption
## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Stanford University will tempo
rarily be permitted to operate the
waste incinerator at its Environ
mental Safety Facility without a
scrubber, a regional environmental
agency ruled yesterday.
The inoperative scrubber —
which is supposed to filter hydrogen
chloride from the smoke produced
by the incinerator — has become
a center of recent controversy con
cerning health and safety at Stan
ford.
The Bay Area Air Quality Man
agement District granted Stanford
permission in the form of a retroac
tive variance valid from Nov. 23,
1987 until Feb. 12, 1988. Yester
day's variance was the fourth
granted to Stanford as a result of
scrubber malfunctions in less than
a year.
The incinerator is used to destroy
potentially infectious waste from
Stanford Hospital. The faulty scrub
ber was installed last February.
Complaints concerning health
and safety at Stanford were initially
brought up in a Dec. 9 letter sent
to University President Donald
Kennedy from Jon Moldestad, an
operations manager in the Univer
sity's department of Health and
Safety.
Moldestad charged that the Uni

versity has problems with safety
mismanagement and cited specific
instances of employee intimidation
concerning these matters. These al
legations prompted the University
in December to quietly begin an
investigation of safety practices at
various University facilities.
According to University Director
of Health and Safety Alain Decleve,
the incinerator can operate without
the scrubber at "non-hazardous
levels."
Toby Sherwood, assistant counsel
for the Air Quality District, sup
ported Decleve's assertion. Even
without the scrubber, the in
cinerator is still "one of the cleanest
and most efficient hospital in
cinerators in our district," Sher
wood told the district's Hearing
Board at a hearing yesterday.
Hearing Board member Thomas
Ferrito said the scrubber's various
malfunctions appear to be unre
lated but that their causes might
include bad management, poor
design or poor construction.
Curtis Williams, University direc
tor of Facilities, said all three prob
lems have contributed to the scrub
ber malfunctions. "The primary
problem has been that there has
not been a lot of development of
air pollution control equipment,
and historically there is a pretty
