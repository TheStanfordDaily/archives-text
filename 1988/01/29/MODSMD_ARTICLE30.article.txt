# Card grapplers in two matches
## 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
Stanford's wrestling team will have a busy
schedule for the next two days as it faces Cal
State-Fullerton this afternoon in Maples Pavilon
and participates in the All-California Invitational
tomorrow at San Francisco State.
After beating Humboldt State last weekend
by a narrow two-point margin, the Cardinal
grapplers will attempt to bring their dual meet
record to the .500 mark by defeating the Lum
berjacks. Stanford is currently 4-5-0 in head-to
head competition. Fullerton is 6-3-1, with a
second place finish at the Midwest Champion
ships last December to its credit.
Stanford's team record, however, is deceiving.
Four of the upper weight classes — 158, 167,
177 and 190 pounds — have a combined dual
record of 27-6, and those wrestlers have been
carrying most of the burden for the Cardinal
so far this season. They are Steve Yarbrough,
Steve Buddie, Ron Perry and Terry Mclntyre,

respectively; last week at Areata it was these
individuals who pulled off Stanford's comc-from
behind victory.
"I think we'll be favored (against Fullerton)
at 158, 167 and 177," said coach Chris Horpel.
"I'd add 190 to that list, but Terry is 1-1 with
his opponent for the season."
Mclntyre pinned Fullerton's Paul Reutzel at
a tournament earlier this season but was pinned
in a later match by Reutzel.
"He's a really good wrestler," Mclntyre said.
"It'll be a tough match."
If Horpel's predictions of victories at three
of the upper weights hold true, it will still be
necessary for Stanford to win two more matches
to garner the victory. For those wins, Horpel
will likely look to Mclntyre and to some of his
lower weight brackets.
Part of the reason for the Cardinal's difficulty
in dual competition this season is the inexperi
ence of the squad. Mclntyre is the only senior
on the starting squad, with the rest of the lineup
filled by freshmen and sophomores.

Freshman Loren Vigil, at 126 pounds, has
proven himself as a collegiate competitor in
recent weeks after winning an individual title
at the "Aggie Invitational" tournament and
beating his opponent in a key match during the
Humboldt dual meet. Sophomore Josh Lisle
took third at the Aggie Invitational and is cur
rently sixth on the squad in total team-point
accumulation.
Tomorrow's All-Cal tournament "has become
college's unnofficial state championship meet,"
Horpel said. "I'd be happy to place, as a team,
within the top three finishers."
Stanford finished fifth of 12 teams at last
year's All-Cal tournament. Yarbrough and
Mclntyre both placed third in 1987, and Perry
finished fourth.
Today's match will begin at 4:30 p.m. in
Maples Pavilon. Admission for Stanford students
is free. Tomorrow's tournament at San Francisco
State will begin at 9 a.m. with wrestling con
tinuing all day.
