# S.F. State hits Roble
## 
### 
This weekend the Stanford
fencing team returns home to
take on San Francisco State.
Thus far this season the men's
team is undefeated at home. The
women's team has split its two
home matches. Tomorrow's
meet begins at 1 p.m. in Roble
Gym. Stanford is coming off a
series of away meets held at Cal
State-Long Beach last weekend.
San Francisco State has an ad
vantage over the Stanford team
entering tomorrow's contest. San
Francisco does not have varsity
status, making it a club team.
"They are not limited to
NCAA regulations: (On a club
team) everybody can fence, un
dergraduates, post-graduates,
even Olympic team members.
That can be tough," men's Coach
Zoran Tulum said.
The last home meet Stanford
fought was the Big Meet against

California. Berkeley is also a
club team, but Stanford
remained undaunted. The
women won 11-5 and the men
won 18-9.
"On Stanford's side of the bal
ance sheet is a strong combina
tion: hard work, enthusiasm and
teamwork," Tulum said. "(Our)
biggest enemy is experience, but
team unity and constant practice
give a tangible and real expecta
tion (for victory)," Tulum said.
Last season the Stanford
men's squad defeated San Fran
cisco 15-12. The women won 13-
3.
This Saturday the women's foil
team will be freshman Olivia
Judson, sophomores Elizabeth
Spilman and Vanessa Southern,
junior Juliet Judson and senior
Tracy Schmidt. Senior
Alexandra Rankin, the women's
team captain, is recovering from a

broken ankle, but plans on return
ing for the regionals in March.
The men's effort will be headed
by the foil team. Senior Chris Gillen
will lead the foil squad this
weekend. Gillen was undefeated
last weekend.
