# Gymnasts host Arizona
## 
### Chris Kendrick Staff writer 
It's home sweet home for the
woman's gymnastics team as the the
Cardinal hosts its first meet of the
season at Maples Pavilion this Sun
day at noon against No. 10 Arizona
and two teams from Canada, the
University of Alberta and the Uni
versity of British Columbia.
Coach Homer Sardina, who
tested his team last week in a big
win at the California Invitational at
Berkeley, will utilize an experienced
squad against the high-caliber
teams competing in the meet this
weekend.
Senior Alison McGann, the all
around winner of the meet at Cal,
is hoping to have an even stronger
meet now that the Cardinal is at
home. "I had a solid performance
last week, but I just want to make
it better," McGann said.
The Cardinal is removing several
of its gymnasts from the injured
reserve list to have a team at full

strength. One of Stanford's
strongest gymnasts, sophomore
Dina Amoroso, who suffered a
minor injury on the vault in Stan
ford's first meet, will return to the
lineup in the all-around competi
tion. Junior Jinny Rhee is also
scheduled to compete in the all
around in her first performance
since she dropped out of competi
tion last February because of a
stress fracture.
Arizona will be looking to prove
the depth of its squad after suffering
a slim three-tenths-of-a-point loss
to No. 4 Arizona State. The
Wildcats will rely on their key
performers, sophomore Kelly Chap
man and All-American Mary Kay
Brown.
Alberta, whose team finished
third in the Canadian collegiate na
tional championships, is expectcd
to be stronger this year. The two
Canadian schools should battle for
third in the meet.
