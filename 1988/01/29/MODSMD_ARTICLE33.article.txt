# Women's tennis tackles San Jose
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Opening the season against
the defending national cham
pions is not a good idea. Espe
cially when they pulled in the
best recruiting class in the
country, and they're ranked No.
1 again this year. The only con
solation for the San Jose State
women's tennis team is that it
might rain.
The Spartans have the unenvi
able task of meeting two-time
defending national champion
Stanford at 1:30 p.m. today on
the Varsity Courts. San Jose
State is not expected to provide
much of a threat for the Cardi
nal, but should at least test the
home squad's young lineup.
"I'm very excited about the
team (this year)," said Coach
Frank Brennan. "I think we have
the best group of athletes we've
ever had here at Stanford."
The Cardinal has five return
ees from last year's NCAA
championship team, led by soph
omore Lisa Green. As a fresh
man last year, Green advanced
to the semifinals in the NCAA
singles tournament before finally
falling.
Other veterans from last year's
squad are seniors Kay Tittle and
Cari Hagey, junior Cindy
Buchsbaum and sophomore
Valerie Wilson. All contributed
at various times in both doubles
and singles competition last year
and provide some needed exper
ience for the other team mem
bers.
Another returnee is junior
Eleni Rossides, who came to
Stanford in 1985 as one of the
top junior players in the country
but missed almost all of the last
two vears.

She suffered a stress fracture
injury early in her freshman year
and missed almost two full
seasons, but Rossides appears fi
nally to be back this year.
The key to Stanford's national
title defense, however, is the play
of three freshmen: Tami
Whitlinger, Teri Whitlinger and
Sandra Birch are needed to fill
some big holes left by gradua
tion.
"I'm very optimistic," Brennan
said. "It's a team that will take
a long time to gel. I'm just ex
cited that we have talent."
Brennan has the difficult task
of replacing two-time NCAA
singles champion Patty Fendick,
as well as standouts Stephanie
Savides and Leigh Anne
Eldredge, but he said he thinks
the newcomers can plug the
gaps.
"Our team is probably about
as strong as last year's ... at
the national championships," he
said, "but it's going to be tough."
Brennan added that many teams
are better than they were last
season.
His players appear to have the
confidence necessary to make a
run at the national title again,
though. "I'm excited about it
(the dual match opener)," Teri
Whitlinger said. "This'll be fun
because you're playing as a
team."
She also emphasized that the
team's youth could play a posi
tive role. "I'm more excited be
cause we have a fairly young
team. I think we're more out to
have fun and play our best."
The team's lineup is not offi
cial, but it appears Rossides and
Tami Whitlinger will be battling
for the top spot. Both have al
ready had some great performances
in tournaments during the fall and
should be a strong top two.
They'd better be careful,
however, because this year's team
has a tremendous amount of depth.
Green, Teri Whitlinger and Birch
are fighting for the next three spots,

with the others close behind.
Things are also looking up in
doubles. The Whitlingers have been
the top doubles seeds in every tour
nament they've entered as col
legians and lead a strong Stanford
lineup.
Brennan said he is not sure his
team should be ranked No. 1, but
is happy to get the respect. "I think
that's a credit to the program," he
said. "There are a lot of good
schools out there."
