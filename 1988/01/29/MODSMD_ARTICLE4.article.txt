# Wells Fargo will boost staff, add ATM
## Bank to upgrade services 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
The Wells Fargo Bank at Tresiddcr Union
will expand its operations in order to alleviate
the long lines that have plagued the bank's
customers, according to Wells Fargo Vice
President Fritz Kaupp.
The improvements, which were discussed
yesterday at a meeting between Kaup and
the Tresiddcr Space and Operations Com
mittee, will include a new automatic teller
machine (ATM) and an additional staff mem
ber.
The new plan also involves having the
service manager come outside periodically to
watch the line of customers. If the line be
comes very long, the manager will take people
from the line and bring them inside to handle
transactions, acting as a third teller.
Wells Fargo now offers two walk-up teller
windows and three ATMs.
"They gave us a pretty firm commitment
that they will try to keep both walk up lines
open," said Paul Szczesiul, assistant director
of Tresiddcr.
Wells Fargo moved to its Tresiddcr loca
tion in 1972, at which time it occupied ap
proximately double its current space. The
then full-service branch was down-sized
during a Tresiddcr renovation that began in
1984.
Junior Preston Hammer, chair of the Spacc

and Operations Committee, explained that
due to the decrease in space at Tresiddcr,
banking services were also scaled down. The
current Wells Fargo lease expires Sept. 17,
1990, and will require Tresiddcr approval in
order to be renewed.
A return to a larger size bank is "not in
the cards," Kaupp said.
At the meeting, Kaupp reportedly said
people should not have to wait in line for
more than five minutes and that customers
could call him with complaints.
According to Szczesiul, rcccnt student com
plaints have concerned long lines and a dis
courteous attitude on the part of some bank
employees.
"We felt the situation was getting out of
hand," Hammer said.
Hammer described Kaupp as having been
"open to suggestions, yet defensive" during
the meeting. But Kaupp said yesterday that
he "didn't have any arguments with them
(the committee). ... Their goals are my
goals."
Kaupp denied that there had been an in
crease in complaints. "I think it's just some
thing they (the committee) have taken off
the back burner and put on the front burner,"
he said. He added that volume at the bank
has actually been declining since 1985-86 and
has recently leveled off.
