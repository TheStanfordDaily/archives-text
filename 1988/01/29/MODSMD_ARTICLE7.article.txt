Reagan to end Asian trade perks
WASHINGTON — A Cabinet-level committee has recommended
that President Reagan withdraw special trade privileges enjoyed by
four fast-growing Asian nations whose soaring trade surpluses with
the United States have created a serious economic challenge to
the administration.
Sources said the president is expected to approve the decision
of the White House Economic Policy Council, which could be
announced as early as tomorrow.
The action reflects the administration's frustration with the so
called "four tigers" of Asia — Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea
and Taiwan — whose double-digit economic growth is due in large
part to their trade with the United States. The action also reflects
the countries' growing statures as industrial powers.
The countries would be removed from the list of 140 less developed
countries eligible to import many products into the United States
free of duty under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP),
giving them the same status as Japan, West Germany and other
industrialized nations.
Together, the four newly industrialized countries (NICs) in Asia
received $5.3 billion in benefits under the GSP program by avoiding
duty payments, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said a
year ago. In effect, the duty-free status reduces prices of products
from those countries sold in the United States, giving them a
significant competitive advantage.
Drug smuggler implicates Nicaragua
WASHINGTON — A convicted drug smuggler, describing in
fluential Central American drug contacts that he said included
Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega as a "full-scale co
conspirator," told a Senate investigative panel yesterday that he
learned of a huge drug base operating out of Nicaragua.
Steven Kalish, a 35-year-old high school dropout who said that
he built a drug empire so vast that his 180 workers couldn't keep
track of all the money, testified that he was told by a business
associate in the Columbian drug cartel that it "had set up the
largest cocaine manufacturing plant in the world."
Kalish, who has been in jail for the past 43 months, suggested
that some officials of Nicaragua's Sandinista regime were aware of
the cartel's operation— thus raising anew charges of drug involve
ment by the leftist regime.
The alleged Sandinista-drug connection "would be very significant
if it could be documented," said Sen. William Roth Jr. (D-Del.)
who presided over much of Thursday's hearing. But the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations is not expected to probe the
Nicaraguan connection, but rather to concentrate on Noriega's
alleged role as a key facilitator — and money-maker — in the
Central American drug flow.
Israeli general discusses beatings
JERUSALEM — Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, military commander
for the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said yesterday that "we had
maybe too many" cases of soldiers unnecessarily beating Palestinians,
and he acknowledged that the punishment for many soldiers re
sponsible for such beatings has been limited to transfers.
Mitzna made it clear, however, that he believes that the relative
calm in the occupied territories now is largely the result of severe
tactics against demonstrators, including beatings with clubs.
The 42-year-old general, apparently in keeping with an official
effort to reverse the negative reaction to Israel's policy of dealing
with the unrest, said the critics may be right, at least in part.
He told reporters that the main issue now "of course is the
behavior of our soldiers" in dealing with the rock-throwing and
taunting of the demonstrators.
Referring to reports that Israeli troops have not only beaten
demonstrators but physically abused nonviolent Palestinians and
detainees to the point of brutality, Mitzna said that "we the Israelis,
or Jews, have a very sensitive conscience, (and these incidents) are
something against our way of thinking, our way of behaving.. ..
They are exceptions to the policy."
Each of the complaints, many of them from soldiers, is being
checked, he said, "and if there is someone we have to punish, we
punish them."
Police, polygamists battle in Utah
MARION, Utah — A 13-day standoff between police and a
violent polygamist clan ended in a bloody shootout yesterday that
left one policeman dead and the family's leader critically wounded
in the snowy barnyard of their mountain stronghold.
The siege that began here around 8:15 a.m. concluded a long
and frustrating war of nerves that involved harassing the 15 family
members with floodlights and high-pitched noises blaring from
loudspeakers in the hope that fatigue would wear them down.
After nearly two weeks of watchful waiting in the face of threat
ened violence, an undisclosed number of officers slipped into the
polygamists' compound early yesterday, hid in an empty house and
waited for clan leader Addam Swapp, 27, to emerge from the main
cabin 50 yards away.
When Swapp and his younger brother, Jonathan, 21, came outside
to do chores, the officers unleashed an attack dog on them.
Swapp was seen raising his rifle, and a volley of gunfire hit the
house where police were hiding, said John Nielsen, Utah commis
sioner of public safety. The dog's handler, Lt. Fred House, 35, was
killed when a bullet narrowly missed his bullet-proof vest and struck
his torso.
Helms attacks INF treaty in Senate
WASHINGTON — Relentless attacks by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-
N.C.) on the new U.S.-Soviet nuclear-arms treaty have prompted
an organized counteroffensive from frustrated Democrats, turning
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's deliberations on the pact
into hour-by-hour combat for control of the debate.
Since minutes after the hearings opened Monday, Helms has
dominated the proceedings with a constant barrage of charges
against the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) pact negotiated
last month by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev.
While the conservative North Carolinian has been virtually alone
in his attacks on the treaty, the sensational nature of some of his
charges, coupled with the lack of other fireworks, has enabled him
to dominate news stories and enliven otherwise largely uneventful
gavel-to-gavel coverage of the hearings on cable television.
Unable to deter Helms and reluctant to leave the charges un
answered, Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston, Calif., got to
gether Tuesday morning with Sens. Joseph Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and
Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.) to organize what a Democratic aide called
a "Helms Watch."
"We didn't like to have charges designed to undermine the treaty
floating around without a response to them," Cranston said yesterday
in explaining the strategy.

announced as early as tomorrow.
The action reflects the administration's frustration with the so
called "four tigers" of Asia — Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea
and Taiwan — whose double-digit economic growth is due in large
part to their trade with the United States. The action also reflects
the countries' growing statures as industrial powers.
The countries would be removed from the list of 140 less developed
countries eligible to import many products into the United States
free of duty under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP),
giving them the same status as Japan, West Germany and other
industrialized nations.
Together, the four newly industrialized countries (NICs) in Asia
received $5.3 billion in benefits under the GSP program by avoiding
duty payments, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said a
year ago. In effect, the duty-free status reduces prices of products
from those countries sold in the United States, giving them a
significant competitive advantage.
Drug smuggler implicates Nicaragua
WASHINGTON — A convicted drug smuggler, describing in
fluential Central American drug contacts that he said included
Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega as a "full-scale co
conspirator," told a Senate investigative panel yesterday that he
learned of a huge drug base operating out of Nicaragua.
Steven Kalish, a 35-year-old high school dropout who said that
he built a drug empire so vast that his 180 workers couldn't keep
track of all the money, testified that he was told by a business
associate in the Columbian drug cartel that it "had set up the
largest cocaine manufacturing plant in the world."
Kalish, who has been in jail for the past 43 months, suggested
that some officials of Nicaragua's Sandinista regime were aware of
the cartel's operation— thus raising anew charges of drug involve
ment by the leftist regime.
The alleged Sandinista-drug connection "would be very significant
if it could be documented," said Sen. William Roth Jr. (D-Del.)
who presided over much of Thursday's hearing. But the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations is not expected to probe the
Nicaraguan connection, but rather to concentrate on Noriega's
alleged role as a key facilitator — and money-maker — in the
Central American drug flow.
Israeli general discusses beatings
JERUSALEM — Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, military commander
for the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said yesterday that "we had
maybe too many" cases of soldiers unnecessarily beating Palestinians,
and he acknowledged that the punishment for many soldiers re
sponsible for such beatings has been limited to transfers.
Mitzna made it clear, however, that he believes that the relative
calm in the occupied territories now is largely the result of severe
tactics against demonstrators, including beatings with clubs.
The 42-year-old general, apparently in keeping with an official
effort to reverse the negative reaction to Israel's policy of dealing
with the unrest, said the critics may be right, at least in part.
He told reporters that the main issue now "of course is the
behavior of our soldiers" in dealing with the rock-throwing and
taunting of the demonstrators.
Referring to reports that Israeli troops have not only beaten
demonstrators but physically abused nonviolent Palestinians and
detainees to the point of brutality, Mitzna said that "we the Israelis,
or Jews, have a very sensitive conscience, (and these incidents) are
something against our way of thinking, our way of behaving.. ..
They are exceptions to the policy."
Each of the complaints, many of them from soldiers, is being
checked, he said, "and if there is someone we have to punish, we
punish them."
Police, polygamists battle in Utah
MARION, Utah — A 13-day standoff between police and a
violent polygamist clan ended in a bloody shootout yesterday that
left one policeman dead and the family's leader critically wounded
in the snowy barnyard of their mountain stronghold.
The siege that began here around 8:15 a.m. concluded a long
and frustrating war of nerves that involved harassing the 15 family
members with floodlights and high-pitched noises blaring from
loudspeakers in the hope that fatigue would wear them down.
After nearly two weeks of watchful waiting in the face of threat
ened violence, an undisclosed number of officers slipped into the
polygamists' compound early yesterday, hid in an empty house and
waited for clan leader Addam Swapp, 27, to emerge from the main
cabin 50 yards away.
When Swapp and his younger brother, Jonathan, 21, came outside
to do chores, the officers unleashed an attack dog on them.
Swapp was seen raising his rifle, and a volley of gunfire hit the
house where police were hiding, said John Nielsen, Utah commis
sioner of public safety. The dog's handler, Lt. Fred House, 35, was
killed when a bullet narrowly missed his bullet-proof vest and struck
his torso.
Helms attacks INF treaty in Senate
WASHINGTON — Relentless attacks by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-
N.C.) on the new U.S.-Soviet nuclear-arms treaty have prompted
an organized counteroffensive from frustrated Democrats, turning
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's deliberations on the pact
into hour-by-hour combat for control of the debate.
Since minutes after the hearings opened Monday, Helms has
dominated the proceedings with a constant barrage of charges
against the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) pact negotiated
last month by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev.
While the conservative North Carolinian has been virtually alone
in his attacks on the treaty, the sensational nature of some of his
charges, coupled with the lack of other fireworks, has enabled him
to dominate news stories and enliven otherwise largely uneventful
gavel-to-gavel coverage of the hearings on cable television.
Unable to deter Helms and reluctant to leave the charges un
answered, Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston, Calif., got to
gether Tuesday morning with Sens. Joseph Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and
Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.) to organize what a Democratic aide called
a "Helms Watch."
"We didn't like to have charges designed to undermine the treaty
floating around without a response to them," Cranston said yesterday
in explaining the strategy.

Reagan to end Asian trade perks
WASHINGTON — A Cabinet-level committee has recommended
that President Reagan withdraw special trade privileges enjoyed by
four fast-growing Asian nations whose soaring trade surpluses with
the United States have created a serious economic challenge to
the administration.
