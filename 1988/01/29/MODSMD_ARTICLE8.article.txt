# Sandinistas, contras talk peace

### 
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica — In their first face
to-face negotiations in nearly seven years of war,
Nicaraguan government officials and U.S.-
backed contras met for more than two hours
yesterday to lay out sharply different truce
proposals.
Monsignor Bosco Vivas, a Nicaraguan Roman
Catholic bishop and the mediator at the talks,
said the two sides were "sincere" and showed
"mutual respect," but he expressed little hope
for a quick cease-fire. Costa Rican officials were
similarly pessimistic.
Vivas said both sides read their truce
proposals aloud, then exchanged initial reac
tions. They agreed to meet again today, he said.
Before the meeting began at a Roman Cath
olic seminary in a San Jose suburb, the
negotiators representing Nicaragua's ruling San
dinista party unveiled their latest offer for a
ceasc-fiie by March 15, to be monitored by both
an international commission and a "mixed mil
itary commission" of Nicaraguan soldiers and
contras.
The Sandinistas said their proposal offers the
rebels guarantees of physical and political se
curity, but it maintains the government's long
standing position that the contras must disarm
before they will be allowed to discuss political
reforms with the government as part of a civic
opposition.
The contras' proposal insists on sweeping con
stitutional reforms to limit the power of the
leftist Sandinistas as a condition for a cease-fire.
Costa Rican officials said they did not expect
major progress toward a cease-fire in the

Nicaraguan guerrilla war before Congress votes
on the Reagan admininistration's proposal for
$36.25 million in military and non-lethal aid for
the contras next Wednesday.
"The contras will not want to negotiate in
depth until the vote, and the Sandinista gov
ernment will not want to make major promises
before the vote," said a Costa Rican official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The key
to the game is not here, but in Washington."
In separate press conferences, the contras
charged that the Sandinista proposal was aimed
at defeating the aid, and the Sandinistas con
tended that the rebel position was based on
Reagan administration policy rather than the
Central American peace plan of last August.
The talks are the result of that peace accord,
conceived by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
and signed by all five Central American presi
dents. The plan commits the governments to
cease-fires, amnesty, political dialogue and dem
ocratic reforms to end the region's wars.
Throughout Nicaragua's war, the Sandinistas
had rejected talks with the contras and insisted
on a direct dialogue with the United States,
which helped found the insurgency and contin
ues to fund it. Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega agreed to send a negotiating team to
the direct talks during a meeting of the Central
American presidents here earlier this month to
judge the progress of the plan.
The two sides held indirect talks twice in the
Dominican Republic late last year, mediated by
Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo. Those meetings were unsuccessful.

In the morning, before the talks began, the
Sandinista and contra negotiating teams each
met separately with the mediators, Bishops Vivas
and Carlos Santi at the rambling Central Sem
inary in the lower-middle-class Paso Ancho sub
urb. A knot of anti-Sandinista protesters gath
ered outside the 19505-era structure, which was
guarded by Costa Rican security personnel.
The Sandinista commission is headed by Dep
uty Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco and
the army intelligence chief, Maj. Ricardo
Wheelock; the contra team is headed by banker
Jaime Morales and guerrilla commander Wal
ther Caldron.
Each side has two foreign observers. The
Sandinistas' arc American attorney Paul
Reichler and West German Social Democrat
Hans-Jurgen Wischnewski; the contra advisers
arc two former foreign ministers, Gonzalo Facio
of Costa Rica and Adm. Ramon Emilio Jimenez
of the Dominican Republic.
Yesterday's talks began about 4 p.m. in the
seminary library, recessed briefly for coffee and
resumed until about 6:30 p.m. A second three
hour round was scheduled for today.
Asked if it was possible to reach agreement
in only two days, Vivas said, "We are hopeful,
but we are not dreamers.... I sincerely believe
there will not be time to reach an agreement."
Contra negotiator Morales called the talks "a
good start. There was no agreement or dis
agreement." A Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry of
ficial, Oscar Tellcz, said the talks were "going
well."

ceasc-fiie by March 15, to be monitored by both
an international commission and a "mixed mil
itary commission" of Nicaraguan soldiers and
contras.
The Sandinistas said their proposal offers the
rebels guarantees of physical and political se
curity, but it maintains the government's long
standing position that the contras must disarm
before they will be allowed to discuss political
reforms with the government as part of a civic
opposition.
The contras' proposal insists on sweeping con
stitutional reforms to limit the power of the
leftist Sandinistas as a condition for a cease-fire.
Costa Rican officials said they did not expect
major progress toward a cease-fire in the

Nicaraguan guerrilla war before Congress votes
on the Reagan admininistration's proposal for
$36.25 million in military and non-lethal aid for
the contras next Wednesday.
"The contras will not want to negotiate in
depth until the vote, and the Sandinista gov
ernment will not want to make major promises
before the vote," said a Costa Rican official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The key
to the game is not here, but in Washington."
In separate press conferences, the contras
charged that the Sandinista proposal was aimed
at defeating the aid, and the Sandinistas con
tended that the rebel position was based on
Reagan administration policy rather than the
Central American peace plan of last August.
The talks are the result of that peace accord,
conceived by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
and signed by all five Central American presi
dents. The plan commits the governments to
cease-fires, amnesty, political dialogue and dem
ocratic reforms to end the region's wars.
Throughout Nicaragua's war, the Sandinistas
had rejected talks with the contras and insisted
on a direct dialogue with the United States,
which helped found the insurgency and contin
ues to fund it. Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega agreed to send a negotiating team to
the direct talks during a meeting of the Central
American presidents here earlier this month to
judge the progress of the plan.
The two sides held indirect talks twice in the
Dominican Republic late last year, mediated by
Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo. Those meetings were unsuccessful.

In the morning, before the talks began, the
Sandinista and contra negotiating teams each
met separately with the mediators, Bishops Vivas
and Carlos Santi at the rambling Central Sem
inary in the lower-middle-class Paso Ancho sub
urb. A knot of anti-Sandinista protesters gath
ered outside the 19505-era structure, which was
guarded by Costa Rican security personnel.
The Sandinista commission is headed by Dep
uty Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco and
the army intelligence chief, Maj. Ricardo
Wheelock; the contra team is headed by banker
Jaime Morales and guerrilla commander Wal
ther Caldron.
Each side has two foreign observers. The
Sandinistas' arc American attorney Paul
Reichler and West German Social Democrat
Hans-Jurgen Wischnewski; the contra advisers
arc two former foreign ministers, Gonzalo Facio
of Costa Rica and Adm. Ramon Emilio Jimenez
of the Dominican Republic.
Yesterday's talks began about 4 p.m. in the
seminary library, recessed briefly for coffee and
resumed until about 6:30 p.m. A second three
hour round was scheduled for today.
Asked if it was possible to reach agreement
in only two days, Vivas said, "We are hopeful,
but we are not dreamers.... I sincerely believe
there will not be time to reach an agreement."
Contra negotiator Morales called the talks "a
good start. There was no agreement or dis
agreement." A Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry of
ficial, Oscar Tellcz, said the talks were "going
well."
