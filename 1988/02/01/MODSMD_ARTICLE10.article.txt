To celebrate Tresidder Me
morial Student Union's 25th an
niversary, coordinators at the stu
dent union are planning a series
of performances and exhibitions
this week featuring artists from
Stanford and from the local com
munity.
According to William King, a
Student Arts at Stanford coordi
nator, the purpose of the celebra
tion is to "show the rest of the
community the best of Tresidder."
King said he is excited about
the programs this week because
they "represent the original pur
pose of Tresidder — bringing to
gether the various dimensions of
the Stanford community in a cul
tural setting."

On behalf of Tresidder, mem
bers of STA.RTs organized this
week's events with a budget of
approximately $5,000.
One of the programs included
in the celebration is an exhibit at
the Coffee House that details the
construction of Tresidder through
a collection of early photographs
and old newspaper clippings from
the union's beginnings in the
early '60s.
The 74,000-square-foot struc
ture was designed by San Fran
cisco architects Spencer and Lee,
who relied heavily on student in
put in their plans.
Tresidder was named after
Stanford's fourth president,
Donald Tresidder, who served
from 1943 until his death in 1948
and was known for his contact

with students, according to Paul
Szczesiul, assistant director of the
union.
In accordance with Tresidder's
wishes, Stanford's trustees deter
mined that a union would be built
to "present a social, cultural,
recreational and intellectual pro
gram for the whole campus."
The new building, which cost
$2,675,000 to complete, was de
signed as part of a student com
plex that included the Bookstore,
Post Office, Old Union and Dink
elspiel Auditorium. Construction
of the building began in April
1961 and was completed by Oc
tober 1962.
STARTs decided this week's
celebration would be a good op
portunity to "showcase student

talent," Program Coordinator
Nancy Noelke said.
Musicians from Stanford and
the local community will perform
at the British "High Tea" events
taking place every day this week
at 4 p.m. on the second floor of
Tresidder.
Programs later in the week will
include performances by Ballet
Folklorico, the Kumba Dance Em
semble, Hawaiian Club Dancers,
the Stanford Comtemporary
Dance Ensemble and Stanford
jazz artists.
The week's activities will close
Friday evening with the "Grand
Finale": a variety show featuring
the Fleet Street singers, Stanford
Jazz Combo, Mixed Company and
the Stanford Gospel Choir.
