# Program will study premature birth

### Brent Bigler 
Stanford biologists and med
ical researchers have combined
forces in the formation of a
new $1.4 million program ded
icated to attacking problems
surrounding premature birth,
program officials announced
Friday.
The first of its kind in the
nation, the Developmental and
Neonatal Biology Training Pro
gram is designed to bring clini
cal and biological researchers
together in the laboratory, ac
cording to Pediatrics Prof. Mer
ton Bernfield, director of the
program.
By combining the efforts of
clinicians and scientists, the
program will increase the un
derstanding of the basic biolog
ical problems underlying
premature births, he added.
"We're working to under
stand the basic biology of (cell)
differentiation," Bernfield said,
"(including) how abnormal or
gans form, and what goes on
in the cells of premature
babies, so that we can prevent
not only premature births, but
also birth defects."
The object of the program is
to give clinicians the "opportu
nity to learn research in labo

ratories of basic scientists so
that there will be much better
research training for people
taking care of babies,"
Bernfield said.
"If they can gain new knowl
edge of how to solve problems,
then we've succeeded. That's
our goal."
Because neonatal medical
technology is so complicated,
advances in the field can be
made more rapidly by applying
both scientific and clinical
methods to premature birth
problems, according to
Bernfield.
Funded by the National In
stitutes of Health for an initial
five years, the program com
bines two separate grants given
to Stanford in 1982.
In 1986, Bernfield ap
proached the NIH to explore
the possibility of bringing the
training programs together.
"They were very enthusiastic,"
he said, adding that the NIH
initially endorsed the idea last
July.
The program provides
stipends for seven post
graduates and pays full tuition
for five pre-doctorates. Fellows
must be actively engaged in re
search to remain in the pro
gram.
