JERUSALEM â€” The Israeli govern
ment under then-Prime Minister
Shimon Peres agreed in 1985 not to
oppose a proposed, $1 billion Iraqi oil
pipeline project primarily out of
deference to Jordan, which is a close
ally of Baghdad and the key to most
Israeli visions of some future Middle
East peace agreement, senior officials
said here Sunday.
Also, the officials said, the agree
ment reflected concern in at least part
of the ruling coalition over the danger
of an Iranian victory in the Iran-Iraq
War and the possible impetus such a
development might provide to what
are perceived as dangerous currents
of Islamic fundamentalism throughout
the region.
The sources, who represent both
major partners in the coalition, said
Peres had written to "a competent
member of the U.S. government" in
November 1985 outlining Israel's
stand on the pipeline, which was to
have been built on Jordanian territory
close to Israel and Israeli-occupied
areas on the West Bank of the Jordan
River.
Contrary to some published reports,
informed sources here close to Peres
said that the Israeli leader did not
write to U.S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111, even though Meese was one
of several "top officials in the Amer
ican administration" who had con
tacted their Israeli counterparts about
the pipeline project in discussions
dating back at least into late-1984.
Meese did write to Peres concerning
the deal, the sources said. The date
of that communication could not be
immediately learned, but the sources
said the communication had nothing
to do with money.
Peres' motives in supporting the
pipeline project are important in light
of the latest developments in a con
tinuing investigation of Meese by U.S.
independent counsel James McKay.
Government sources familiar with
the inquiry told the Los Angeles Times
in Washington last week that the in
quiry now focuses on a memo to the
attorney general by his close friend
and lawyer, E. Robert Wallach. The
memo reportedly suggests payments
to Peres to secure his support for the
pipeline, which Wallach promoted on
bohalf of another client.

Peres, who is now deputy prime min
ister and foreign minister, categori
cally denied late Saturday that money
or anything else of value was ever
offered in connection with the pipeline
project either to him or the Labor
Alignment political bloc that he heads.
The Hebrew-language newspaper
Maariv quoted Peres Sunday as saying:
"If someone would come and offer me
money for political decisions I would
throw him out the window."
Interviewed Sunday by Israel Radio,
Bruce Rappaport, a wealthy, Israeli
born Swiss businessman who was a
key intermediary in the pipeline ne
gotiations, said that "never did we
have a conversation on a payment of
money either to a minister, or to a
party, or to a government, or to
anyone. I haven't yet bribed anyone,
and one would have to be a fool to
think that a man like Peres, whom I
have known for 45 years and who has
such clean hands, would respond in
any manner."
Payments to foreign officials or po
litical parties in order to gain or retain
business are prohibited under the 1977
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. And
even if no payments were ever made
or offered, the question has arisen
whether Meese acted improperly by
allegedly failing to report the sugges
tion contained in the Wallach
memorandum.
In a statement released through the
Foreign Ministry spokesman, Peres
said Saturday that "all ministers (of
the Israeli government) concerned"
had considered the proposed pipeline
following a request by the U.S. gov
ernment and that they had agreed not
to oppose the project.
Baghdad, recalling that Israeli
warplanes in 1981 had destroyed an
Iraqi nuclear reactor then under con
struction, reportedly sought as
surances that the same fate would not
befall the pipeline. Iraq is said to have
approached the United States to act
as an intermediary to sound out the
Israelis.
The Foreign Ministry spokesman
also confirmed that U.S. officials
sought a firm guarantee that Israel
would not attack the pipeline and that
the Israeli government agreed to con
sider such a pledge.
