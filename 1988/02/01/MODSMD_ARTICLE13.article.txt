# President says he has full confidence in Meese
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - President
Reagan has full confidence in Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111, despite
being told last week that Meese is the
"focal point" of a criminal probe into
a $1 billion pipeline project backed by
Meese's close friend, E. Robert Wal
lach, White House Chief of Staff
Howard H. Baker Jr. said Sunday.
Baker said that he was informed of
Meese's role last Wednesday by inde
pendent counsel James McKay, who
is investigating whether Meese and
Wallach improperly used White House
influence to promote the proposed
pipeline.
In a briefing with Baker and White
House lawyer A.B. Culvahouse, McKay
did not specifically identify Meese as
a target of his inquiry, a legal term
that would mean that Meese is under
direct threat of criminal indictment,
Baker said.
"I use the same term that I believe
Mr. McKay has used, a 'focal point'
of the investigation," Baker said. Cul

vahouse later gave Reagan an account
of the meeting with McKay, he said.
Reagan will closely monitor the
progress of McKay's investigation,
Baker said, but was "very adamant"
in denying to aides that Meese would
be asked to resign or temporarily step
aside while the inquiry is under way.
Baker made the comments in an
interview on the CBS program "Face
the Nation." His statements came
amid indications that McKay's pipeline
inquiry has spread to involve other
parts of the U.S. government.
The probe centers on efforts by Wal
lach and Meese in 1985 to secure
guarantees from Israel and the
banking community that would permit
financing of the pipeline, which was
to carry oil from Iraq to the Jordanian
port of Aqaba. The Iraq government
refused to permit construction to begin
without ironclad assurances that Isra
el, its enemy, would not destroy the
completed pipeline.
