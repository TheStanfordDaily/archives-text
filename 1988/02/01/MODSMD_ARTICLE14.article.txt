# Evidence may link Waldheim to deportations

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (DPA) - A Yugoslav his
torian who unearthed a telex message that, if
genuine, links Austrian President Kurt Waldheim
"in the closest way yet" to Nazi war crimes, an
nounced yesterday that he has more evidence
against Waldheim.
Dusan Plenca said in an interview with Swedish
radio that he had discovered a new document
proving that the former United Nations secretary
general was involved in a deportation order in 1943
to a concentration camp in Bosnia.
"The new document contains a confirmation by
Waldheim that the deportation got under way," he
said. Plenca said he planned to disclose his latest
findings in a hook due to be published this spring.
He reiterated that the telex message, which he
passed to the West German news magazine Der
Spiegel for publication in its Monday edition, was
authentic.
The 46-year-old telex message indicates that
Waldheim relayed orders for the deportation of more
than 4,000 Balkan civilians, among them Jews, while
serving as officer in the German army in 1942.

A Waldheim spokesman in Vienna Saturday
denounced the telex as an "apparent forgery" a day
after the contents of the message were made avail
able to the press by Der Spiegel. He said it had
been offered to correspondents in Vienna for "a
five-digit sum in dollars".
The latest allegations came just a week before a
Vienna government-picked panel of international
historians investigating Waldheim's alleged Nazi
past is due to present its final report to Austrian
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky Feb. 8.
Waldheim has repeatedly said he never knew of
deportations.
Plenca criticized the fact that no Yugoslav histo
rian was appointed to the panel. "I do not know
which goal the panel pursues," he said in the in
terview. "A panel member visited Yugoslavia only
briefly although all documents are here," he added.
West German historian Manfred Messerschmidt,
a member of the panel, Saturday said he doubted
the authenticity of the telex because it was "not in
line with the military jargon used then." But if
authentic the document would link Waldheim "in

the closest way yet" to alleged Nazi war crimes, he
told Austrian Orf radio.
Der Spiegel claims it is the first piece of solid
evidence linking the embattled Austrian president
to World War II crimes. The telex conveyed an
"urgent" message July 22, 1942, from Col. Fedor
Dragojlov, later chief of the Croatian general staff,
to "the commandant of the First Group Unit." It
reads: "Urgent. Lieutenant Kurt Waldheim of Gen
eral Stahl's staff orders removal of 4,224 prisoners
from Kozara, consisting primarily of women and
children and approximately 15 percent elderly men:
3,514 to Grubisino Polje and 730 to Zemun."
Der Spiegel said the discrepancy of 20 deportees
in the telex presumably was due to the haste with
which the order was dispatched.
The order followed a bloody clash between Ger
man forces and resistance fighters in the Kozara
Mountains, the magazine says. The article claims
many of the deportees were Jewish and that large
numbers later died in various Nazi camps.
