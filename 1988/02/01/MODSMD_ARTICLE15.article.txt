New Mideast peace effort
JERUSALEM — Concerned by nearly two
months of violence in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, the United States has
launched a major new effort to break a six
year-old deadlock in the Middle East peace
process, officials here and in Washington said
yesterday.
Secretary of State George Shultz said that
American officials now "are in very active dis
cussions with the key parties — with the Is
raelis, with the Jordanians, with the Egyptians
and, in a lesser way, with the Palestinian
leaders."
Israeli reports said that the American ini
tiative involves specific new proposals for lim
ited Palestinian autonomy in the occupied ter
ritories during a four-year transition period
plus the opening of negotiations for a firm
solution to the problem of the disputed region
in as little as one year.
Shultz said that Washington's effort is
aimed at shifting the emphasis away from
procedures for arranging an international
peace conference and toward "the substance
of what can be done right now to help the
situation on the West Bank and Gaza quickly."
Freighter burns in Gulf
BAGHDAD, Iraq (DPA) — An apparently
unmanned Panamanian-flagged freighter was
reported on fire and abandoned in the northern
Persian Gulf yesterday, however it had not
been determined whether the the ship had
been hit by an Iraqi Exocet missile or by
Iranian speedboats.
Regional shipping sources said the freighter,
identified by salvage company sources as the
15,000-ton Panamanian freighter Mare, was
spotted ablaze yesterday morning south of the
Saudi island of al-Arabiyah, which is near the
Iranian Revolutionary Guard base at Farsi
Island in the upper central part of the gulf.
Iranian speedboats use Farsi as a base.
The sources said no requests for salvage
work had been received and that it appeared
the ship was hit on the Iranian side of the
gulf and was subsequently abandoned by its
crew.
Iraq has claimed 17 raids on Iranian ship
ping since the beginning of this month, but
only six have been independently confirmed.
Area near Chernobyl livable
MOSCOW — Part of the area around the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant has been decon
taminated enough to allow people to return
to live there, a leading Soviet medical specialist
said in an interview released here yesterday.
Medical specialist Leonid Ilyin said the
southeast portion of an 18-mile zone evacuated
after the April 1986 explosion and fire at the
plant is now fit for habitation. About 115,000
people were evacuated from the farming towns
around Chernobyl, following what was the
world's worst nuclear accident.
But Ilyin, who is vice president of the Soviet
Academy of Medical Sciences, stopped short
of recommending that the area be resettled,
saying that farming remains dangerous be
cause of pockets of high radiation in the
countryside.
"The radiation situation... allows the popu
lation to come back," Ilyin said. But, he added,
"For people to return, they need to be provided
with their habitual work."
