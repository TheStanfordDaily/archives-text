# Editorial
## Editor's welcome 
### 
You may have noticed a few
changes in today's Daily.
Our new look is the result of a
redesign process that will continue
through the spring. For the next
several months we will be be add
ing new elements and fine-tuning
our graphic display, all as part of
an effort to better organize infor
mation and present it to our
readers.
Every week, our special Sports
Monday section will summarize
the Cardinal's play over the
weekend. On Wednesdays, we will
clue you in to the best in local
diversions in our Entertainment
section. There is increased empha
sis on our Books department,
which will feature reviews by Stan
ford students and professors. And
every Friday, our new Weekend
section will preview the movies
opening in the area and help you
get away from the Farm.
For those of you who are fans
of Binky and Akbar and to Jeff,
you'll be glad to hear that Matt
Groening's popular weekly strip,
"Life in Hell," will be appearing
in The Daily every Wednesday.
Opus and the rest of the "Bloom
County" gang remain with us, ex
cept that the strip will run in the
Classifieds section inside the back
page of the paper.
The New York Times daily cross
word puzzle will also be located in
the Classifieds section (now you'll
be —etble to find "the crossword
quickly and quietly — and no one
in your class will know).
This week the Opinions page will
introduce "Point-Counterpoint,"
where guest newsmakers will
debate each other on current issues

every Thursday. Opinions will also
bring you five weekly columnists
carefully selected from a competi
tive group of 57 applicants.
Another added feature to The
Daily is Thursday's sports calen
dar, which will summarize Stan
ford's sporting schedule for each
upcoming weekend.
But the real changes at The
Daily have been made behind the
scenes. The production of the
paper has been streamlined so that
we work more efficiently and get
the paper to you earlier.
Our new organization has al
lowed us to rededicate ourselves
to introducing people to the world
of journalism, to teaching people
some very practical communica
tion skills. The opportunity to
learn and advance within The
Daily has never been better.
Importantly, we have reaffirmed
our committment to the coverage
of sensitive issues and are working
to gain perspective in areas where
we have fallen short.
The Daily is here to serve the
Stanford community, and feedback
from our readers is essential if we
are to do the best job we can. When
you have questions, concerns or
.suggestions regarding The Daily,
please call us, stop by our offices
(located in the Storke Publications
Building across from Terman En
gineering) or call me at home at
323-5849.
Thanks and enjoy The Daily,
