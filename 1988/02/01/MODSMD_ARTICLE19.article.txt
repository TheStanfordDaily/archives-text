## Minorities an admissions concern 
### 
All of us in Undergraduate Admis
sions take an active interest in stu
dents beyond those thick letters of
admission. Stanford students are a source
of inspiration in our lives.
It is regrettable, to say the least, when
members of the Stanford community
present their perceptions as established
facts. In particular, I refer to the recent
panel discussion at Otero when students
commented on the recruitment activities
of our office. Uninformed comments do
little to promote discussion and to benefit
change, two cherished goals of any uni
versity.
Furthermore, responsible journalism
involves more than simply reporting what
people have said; the facts, the context,
and sound judgement play important
roles in producing a good piece.
In The Daily's Jan. 27 article,
"Minority Groups Fault University Ad
missions," some gross misstatements
have impugned the efforts and credibility
of the Admissions staff and have contrib
uted to further the misperceptions about
our efforts toward minority recruitment.
Here are the most significant inac
curacies (and I quote directly from the
article):
• "Southern Texas has been neglected
. . . when [admissions officers] began to
concentrate on the Midwest two years
ago," as'one student was quoted as
saying. This is simply untrue. We
recruited in south Texas every year but
one since 1980.
During that year, the staff member
responsible for that area decided to par

ticipate in a joint recruitment effort with
six other universities. This trip was for
the express purpose of minority recruit
ment; representatives from the seven
schools held luncheons for counselors and
evening meetings for students and par
ents in Atlanta, New Orleans, Albuquer
que and San Jose.
We have been trying to improve our
minority recruitment efforts in the
greater Chicago area, but this has not
in any way represented a shift of "atten
tion away from areas of the country once
targeted for minority recruitment," as
the article states. Instead, it represents
an expansion for our total outreach ac
tivities.
• "Efforts are aimed primarily at urban
areas . . ." Our staff of 12 must choose
from the 25,000 high schools each fall.
In 48 total weeks of travel, each of us
aims to visit four schools a day.
This year, the total number of schools
visited was 663 (without including over
50 group college nights). There is a ne
cessary limit to the number of rural
schools we can include in our travel
schedule, but we make an effort to reach
them.
• The joint university fall quarter trip
to Europe did not involve "hundreds of
thousands of dollars," as one student
stated, nor did this outreach effort occur
at the expense of our overall outreach
efforts this year. The trip costs were
relatively modest, in part because they
were shared among the five other uni
versities who took part.

As for not spending "$lO to go the
Oakland," as one student said, we have
recruited every year in Oakland schools,
and will continue to do so. In fact, early
in the fall we discussed plans to enhance
local outreach and will initiate them this
spring.
• "Working class Asians are not well
represented here because they are not
actively recruited and do not receive fi
nancial aid information," one student
said.
Last year, I asked members of the
Asian American community to please pro
vide me with the source of this assertion.
We visit a number of public high schools
with substantial Asian populations from
less privileged backgrounds.
The staff in Undergraduate Admissions
constantly re-evaluates its recruitment
and enrollment efforts. We do not believe
we have all the answers, and we always
welcome constructive input from stu
dents and others.
At the moment, all our energy is
devoted to evaluating freshman applica
tions for next year's class. When this
challenge is behind us, we will continue
our efforts to inform Stanford students
about the work of our office.
The success of any discussion depends
on, among other things, informed com
ments and measured judgments that are
presented with sensitivity and under
standing. We are all responsible for the
quality of the outcome.
