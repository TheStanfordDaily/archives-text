# CIR recommends major investment policy shift
## Calls on Stanford to approve S. Africa pull-outs 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
Urging the University to aban
don its long-standing policy of
"selective disinvestment," a Uni
versity committee today will
release a report calling for the
Board of Trustees to disinvest
from every company whose share
holders want to move out of South
Africa.
The report from the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) states that "the Stanford
community must take a stronger
stand against apartheid" and
criticizes selective disinvestment
as an obsolete policy in light of
recent developments in South
Africa.
Selective disinvestment is the
University policy of considering
shareholder proposals to with
draw from South Africa on a case
by-case basis. The CIR report
recommends instead a policy of
automatically approving every
resolution to disinvest.
If approved, the recommenda
tion will represent a "very major
shift and a new landmark" for
the University's South African in
vestment policy, according to
Frederick Hillier, CIR co-chair
and professor of operations re
search.
The trustees' Special Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility
will begin consideration of the
proposal Monday, Hillier said last
night.
The University presently holds
stock in about 40 U.S. companies
that conduct business in South
Africa.
The University has for many
years encouraged progressive
companies to continue to assist
blacks under the provisions of the
Sullivan Principles, a set of
guidelines used by the University
to direct its investment. The

policy recommends that "those
companies not taking social re
sponsibility seriously pull out" of
their investments, according to
Hillier.
Under these guidelines, the
Board of Trustees considers dis
investment resolutions from com
panies selectively, even though
Reverend Leon Sullivan has
renounced the view outlined in
his "Principles" that social change
in South Africa can be effected
through active, progressive par
ticipation by U.S. companies in
the South African economy.
Last year the CIR voted to con
tinue the selective disinvestment
policy.
The new CIR recommendations
seek to make a University "yes"
vote on withdrawal resolutions
"standard policy," according to
CIR member Linda Yates, a grad
uate student in political science.
The CIR is a 12-member advisory
panel composed of students,
alumni and faculty.
"We've looked at the South
Africa situation and Stanford's
case-by-case [treatment]," Yates
said. "The bottom line for this
committee was that it's time to
get out of South Africa."
She added that "blacks are not
reaping benefits" from the pres
ence of U.S. companies.
Although American companies
have provided jobs for blacks and
funded social programs for blacks
outside the workplace, the report
states that these measures simply
alleviate the effects of apartheid
instead of accelerating its demise.
Comparing apartheid to "this
century's most oppressive totali
tarian states," the report states
that the only measures that can
weaken apartheid are those that
ultimately increase white support
for ending apartheid or decrease
the power of whites to enforce
apartheid.

The committee pointed out that
U.S. corporations pay taxes to the
South African government, di
rectly perpetuating apartheid.
In addition to taxes, the psy
chological benefit of "political
legitimacy" is another negative ef
fect of the continued presence of
U.S. and other foreign companies,
according to the report.
"American corporate presence
in South Africa may be construed
as moral support for the system,
thereby reinforcing the faith of
South African whites in the
validity of their policies," the
report states.
To change the racial attitudes
among South African whites, the
committee suggests disinvest
ment because it emphasizes
"isolation" and "growing pariah
status" for South Africa.
Research of the symbolic impact
of U.S. disinvestment showed the
committee that disinvestment
represents "a severing of the
Western emotional and psychic
'umbilical cord' ... a critical nail
in the coffin of international
isolation."
"A paranoia about becoming a
pariah among the Western na
tions strongly drives [South
African'si thinking," the report
states. "The very delectable carrot
is that ending apartheid will bring
the companies back."
The report continues that dis
investment's negative economic
consequences to blacks would be
"marginal or even minimal." Crit
ics of disinvestment charge that
disinvestment will cause an in
crease in black unemployment
In addition to advocating Uni
versity approval of a blanket dis
investment policy, the committee
also seeks to determine the "roles
we can play in this issue as an
educational institution," accord
ing to Yates.
