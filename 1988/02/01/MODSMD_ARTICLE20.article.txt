## Israeli-Arab talks crucial for Middle East peace 
### 
In his Jan. 25 Viewpoint, gradu
ate student Aley El Shazly
presents a legitimate gripe: the
Palestinians have been getting the
short end of the stick both from
Israel and the rest of the Arab
world. I agree that the Israeli-
Palestinian problem has gotten out
of hand, as can be seen by the
recent riots in Gaza and the West
Bank, and that a solution has to be
found soon.
There definitely should be a Pales
tinian state, but not at the expense
of the Israeli state. Yes, Israel has
gotten herself into a mess, but she
cannot be held solely responsible.
The years that the West Bank and
Gaza were under Jordanian control,
the Jordanians did very little to

foster any growth, be it economic or
otherwise, except the growth of
resentment against Israel. Israel,
therefore, inherited these economic
and social problems along with the
territories.
Meanwhile, those concerned about
the Palestinians and Israel face a
grave situation. Israel cannot solve
these problems on her own for they
are not completely her own prob
lems. Resolution of this crisis re
quires the cooperation of the whole
Arab world (which has been foster
ing this "status quo," as Mr. Shazly
calls it, if anyone has) and Israel, if
not the U.S. as well.
What if Israel were to grant the
Palestinians what they want â€” to
unoccupy the territories and to let

the Palestinians rule their own state
in the West Bank and Gaza? Israel
would then probably close her bor
ders to this new state, guarding it
with a military force stronger than
now exists by the border with
Lebanon. Non-Israeli Arabs would
most likely not be allowed into
Israel. Without the economic
cooperation of Egypt, Jordan and
Israel, this state would not survive.
Who would lead this state? (Which
raises a host of other issues that go
beyond the current focus on the
conflicts in Gaza and the West
Bank).
Only in my wildest dreams do I
ever imagine that these two peoples
will bury the hatchet and work out
a peaceful solution. But only under

a strong and true peace would these
two states be able to survive next to
each other. Economic, social and
political cooperation could only help
their individual growth, whereas
protracted warfare would only be a
strain on both of their resources, to
say nothing of morale.
Reasonable people will soon see
that neither claim is more "right"
than the other. I believe that the
right answer is to accept the reality
that there are two peoples who
deserve this little bit of territory.
They need to share it by establish
ing two states and working together
towards mutual progress.
