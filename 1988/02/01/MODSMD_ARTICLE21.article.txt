# Stanford lacks rape awareness
## 
### 
While the revelation of incidents of
date rape at Stanford was not new,
surprising or unexpected, I must admit
that I was dismayed by "Susan's"
account in the Jan. 2C issue of The
Daily.
The major reason for ttiis is because
the attacker is usually someone that
the victim knows. It seemi, that the
only time that stories about rape reach
The Daily is when "an unidentified
man" leaps from the bushes or tries to
grab a woman at the dish.
Nevertheless, although it may i;ot
always be obvious, there is a definite
.problem of sanctioned but hidden
violence and sexual harassment
towards women on this campus. It
used to amaze me that people would
think that because we are "elite," we
are also exempt from the problems

that are plaguing the rest of society.
In my discussions of date rape, there
is invariably at least one man who
says, "Well, sure it's a problem at
some (non-elite) schools, but you would
think at Stanford ..." These are the
same men who whistle at the Flicks,
applauding the violence as a woman is
beaten by her jealous lover. During
their applause and jubilation, I wonder
if they ever stop to notice that women
near them are flinching.
Wake up, Stanford boy, take respon
sibility for your actions!
Wake up, Stanford woman, you have
a friend who is secretly suffering and
she needs to know that you will help
her fight. "Boys will be boys" forever,
if we let them.
Wake up, Stanford. This problem has
been a secret for too long. It's time to
find our voices. I'm tired of arguing on
my own.
