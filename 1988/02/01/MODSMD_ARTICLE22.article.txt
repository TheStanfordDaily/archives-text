# Fans' Nazi salute disturbs spectator
## 
### 
The last thing I expected to see
when I attended the Jan. 23 Stanford-
Cal basketball game was large numbers
of the Stanford student section chiding
their rivals with numerous Nazi
salutes. Such senseless and ignorant
acts can't be justified as part of the
long and intense rivalry between the
schools.
First, I did not attend either school.
I am, however, Jewish and the son
of a survivor of Auschwitz.
I have been to many sporting events
where opponents treated each other to
insults, middle fingers and physical
mayhem, all of which I find preferable
to Nazi salutes.
In particular, this form of "expres
sion" was being directed toward the
Cal band every time they struck up a
song.
At half-time, in a state of disgust, I

confronted a group of students in the
midst of a rousing "Zig Heil." I asked
one if he realized what he was doing.
Quickly came the response, "Oh, it
doesn't mean that."
I asked what "it" meant. There was
no reply.
Clearly, the user fully understood
the historic symbolism of the gesture
but felt that the analogy was appropri
ate in the situation.
I have no doubts that Stanford and
Stanford students disavow the ideology
underlying National Socialism, one of
the darkest chapters in the history of
man.
My concerns are that those that
display an insensitivity to oppression,
even in the guise of jest, are poten
tially condemned to see history repeat
itself.
My hope is that the students in
volved realize this is 1988 and not
1938.
