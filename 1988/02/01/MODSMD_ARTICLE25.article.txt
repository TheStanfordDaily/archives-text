## New band leader tuned into style 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Senior Dylan Johnson is drum
ming up a storm at the Stanford
Band Shak and in the world of
fashion design as well.
Johnson, the Band's drum
major for the 1988-89 sports
season, has an unlimited supply
of creative energy — a trait the
spontaneous musical group
thrives on.
But Johnson's creative impulse
is not limited to directing the
Band. The drum major also
designs fashions for women.
While jiving to the beat of "All
Right Now" in front of 50,000
football fans excites Johnson, sit
ting in front of a lone sewing ma
chine with fabric has the same
effect.
"For me, going to a fabric store
is like going to a candy store for
kids," he said.
Johnson said that as a child,
he dreamed of becoming both the
Band's drum major and a fashion
designer.
When his father took him to
see the Band as a four year-old,
he knew "right then" that he
wanted to be the drum major.
"I should have had a barbie doll
as a kid,' Johnson joked, and
added that women's fashion has
also always interested him.
Here at Stanford, Johnson is
working hard to make his child
hood fascination a reality.
"I am learning all their [the
Band's] tempos and am getting
in shape physically," he said. "In
my bedroom I wear my walkman,

conduct and jump around. It is
ultra-aerobics."
According to Johnson, several
past Stanford drum majors — in
cluding last year's drum major
Peter Adamy — tore ligaments,
sprained ankles and injured them
selves severely during shows.
By jumping rope and jogging
on a regular basis the drum mtyor
said he hopes to strengthen his
body and avoid injuries.
Johnson is also getting in shape
for two fashion shows this spring
where critics and buyers of the
fashion world will get a look at
12 dresses he designed.
Johnson said he designs for the
individual and strives to capture
the best feature in every woman.
His dress styles range from sweep
ing ballroom gowns to short, silk
dresses that emphasize the
wearer's iegs.
"Dresses are based on the
woman's body and how women
move," Johnson said. "[Desig
ning] is like taking a painting off
a canvas and moving it around."
Johnson said that designing is
an "art" for him and that selling
his designs is not a primary goal.
Johnson, however, said he has an
eye for spotting trends.
"Legs are going to be important
this year. Skirts are going to be
even shorter," he predicted.
Johnson also made predictions
about the Band's future, saying
that the organization would be
less of a "white bread band."
"It has been a year of placation
for the Band (following last year's

problems with the Athletic De
partment). We have not done any
thing too pungent. But we cannot
lose our spontaneity."
Last year, Athletic Director
Andy Geiger temporarily can
celled the Band's performances
because of behavior he considered
to be inappropriate.
According to Johnson, this year
the Band has "progressed musi
cally and sounds really good," but
performances do not excite the
crowd because the audience does
not understand the Band's "in
sular" humor.
Band mascot Brendan Kelly
("the Tree") said that Johnson

has "a real knack for showman
ship" that will improve the Band's
perfomances.
"I am really glad I do not have
to share the stage with hirr " said
Kelly, a senior who will pass on
his role as the Tree in May.
Whether he is designing a dress
or directing the Band, Johnson
said he loves attention and being
a main attraction.
"When I am conducting I think:
This is the Stanford Band. Any
minute they could drop their
pants. But now they are watching
me," Johnson said.
