## 
### Erin Martin Editorial Staff 
Both fashions and spirits
were high Saturday night at
Club Ujamaa, an annual casino
night sponsored by Ujamaa,
the Afro-American theme
house.
Held in Lagunita Court, the
semi-formal party was by no
means limited to gambling. Be
sides blackjack and roulette
tables, there was also a daiquiri
bar featuring tasty peach and
strawberry daiquiris, a pastry
cafe, a lively jazz band and, of
course, plenty of dancing.
A performance by the
Kuumba Dance Ensemble, a
student dance troupe which
specializes in modern and
traditional African and jazz
dance, helped set the cultural
tone which underscored the en
tire evening.
The party, one of Stanford's
best-attended student events,
was organized by residents of
Ujamaa with the hope of giving
the Stanford community more
exposure to the house and its
theme. More than 2,500 stu
dents attended this year's gala
affair, according to one party
organizer.
According to Club Ujamaa
organizer Nicole Ray, a junior
majoring in mechanical engi

neering, planners this year
tried to mix a social atmos
phere with a strong cultural
focus.
"We wanted to introduce
people to the house and show
what it stands for," she said.
"Hopefully 'Club Uj' will get
people to come back for some
of the regular theme pro
grams," Ray added.
Sophomore Canetta Ivy, a
member of the Kuumba Dance
Ensemble, said her perform
ance was strengthened by the
active response from the audi
ence.
"It was such a live crowd,"
she said. "It is a great feeling
to have the crowd with you."
The social and cultural eve
ning was wpll-received by stu
dents.
First-year history graduate
student Jeff Fear called the
party a "big bash" and said
that Club Ujamaa seemed to
be one of few campus parties
"where an even mix of students
of all races get together to have
a good time."
"It makes for a lot more life,"
Fear said.
