## Oregon rebounds to upset cagers, 80-66 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
EUGENE, Ore. — In this
league, it looks like only
Arizona gets two wins on
the road.
After turning in a near
perfect second half against
Oregon State two nights

earlier, the Stanford men's basketball team
looked like every other Pacific 10 Confer
ence team on the road Saturday night as
it folded in the second stanza and fell to
the Oregon Ducks by the score of 80-66,
dropping the team's league record to 5-4,
13-7 overall.
With both teams shooting poorly and the
Cardinal up by four at halflime, 34-30, the
prospects of a road-trip sweep looked good.
But the Ducks opened the second half with
a seven-point spurt, leaving a somewhat
stunned Stanford team down by three.
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery called
a timeout to regroup, but it may already
have been too late.
As the fans at Mac Arthur Court, one of
the Pac 10's toughest arenas in which to
pick up a road victory, began to heat up,
the Cardinal continued to struggle and the
Ducks, boosted by some clutch free-throw
shooting (20-of-28 in the second half),
rolled to a 14-point win.
"They had a run to open the second
half," Montgomery said. "That's the one
thing you don't want to happen. ... We
made a lot of mental mistakes. Somehow,
someway, something wasn't there."
The loss compounded the already con
fusing race for second place in the Pac-10.
Going into this weekend, five Pac-10 teams
(Arizona State, OSU, Oregon, Washington
State, and Stanford) were knotted at three
losses apiece, behind unbeaten and proba

bly untouchable Arizona, now 9-0 in con
ference play and 20-1 overall.
Now, there are five teams with four
losses each, and the chase will begin anew
on Thursday. The only change in the con
ference was UCLA, whose two wins this
weekend moved the Bruins ahead of WSU,
as the Cougars dropped a pair in Southern
California to fall a game back at five losses.
"We're in the hunt," Stanford guard
Terry Taylor said, "I didn't think it would
be this close with so many teams in it, but
I guess the other teams are proving me
wrong."
After losing to California last Thursday,
Saturday's game was crucial to the Ducks'
hopes. "We needed a win badly," Oregon
guard Anthony Taylor said. "If we lost
tonight, the chances of having a successful
season were gone."
"That was a very special win for us,"
Oregon Coach Don Monson said. "We were
down after the California game, but we
came back."
Oregon played well, but the Cardinal
also hurt itself. After shooting 70 percent
from the field against the Beavers, Stanford
managed to hit only 37 percent Saturday
on a 23-of-63 night.
The Ducks didn't do a who'e lot better,
hitting only 41 percent for the game, but
they did win the battle at the line, tallying
25 points from the charity stripe compared
to Stanford's 14.
"Obviously we didn't shoot the ball well.
We took good shots, but the ball didn't go
down," Montgomery said.
On the boards the Cardinal, a very good
rebounding team on the year (beating op
ponents by an average of nearly seven
boards a game), was whipped by the hus
tling Ducks, 52-38. Most significantly, after

night at Oregon, where the Ducks handed the Cardinal its fourth
Pac-10 loss of the year.
being up a couple of rebounds in
the first half, Stanford was out
boarded 34-18 in the second
stanza.
"We got out-rebounded in the
second half. Therein lies the
game," Montgomery said.
Also give some credit to the
Duck defense. Unlike the Beavers,
who couldn't stop power forward
Howard Wright and center Greg
Butler inside, Oregon did a good
job of both keeping the ball away
from the big men and muscling
them when it got there. Butler,
who scored 24 points on 14 shots
against OSU, took only six shots
on Saturday and finished with
just eight points.
"They have this match-up zone
and they match-up very well,"
Butler said. "But we also had a
real hard time running our of
fense. That makes defense a lot
easier."
Wright led the Cardinal with
21 points, but the baskets
definitely came the hard way.
Wright, shooting .651 on the
season, went 7-of-18 from the
floor, logging seven points at the
free throw line. The only other
Stanford player to reach double

figures was guard Todd Lichti at
15.
Compare that to the Ducks,
who were led by Taylor's 26 points
and had four players in double
figures. Three of those players —
6-foot-6 forward Randy Grant, 6-6
forward Keith Balderston and 6-1
guard Frank Johnson — also
turned in double-figure rebound
ing totals. Only Wright, with 12,
managed that for the Cardinal.
Oregon's Taylor, currently the
Pac-10's leading scorer at 20.9 a
game, had his usual high scoring
night, but like Wright's the points
didn't come so easily. It was a
pretty dismal shooting night for
Taylor; covered well by Lichti,
Taylor hit only 9-of-25 shots (one
of which was a three-pointer)
from the field. The senior did,
however, convert seven of nine
free throws to boost his total to
26.
"Todd did an excellent job on
Taylor," Montgomery said.
For his part, Lichti was reason
ably pleased with his effort. "I
could've done a better job — a
couple of times I lost sight of him.
But somebody does have to do it.
It's a challenge to me."
The next challenge for the Car
dinal, and it is a formidable one,
will be a home game next

EUGENE, Ore. — In this
league, it looks like only
Arizona gets two wins on
the road.
After turning in a near
perfect second half against
Oregon State two nights

earlier, the Stanford men's basketball team
looked like every other Pacific 10 Confer
ence team on the road Saturday night as
it folded in the second stanza and fell to
the Oregon Ducks by the score of 80-66,
dropping the team's league record to 5-4,
13-7 overall.
With both teams shooting poorly and the
Cardinal up by four at halflime, 34-30, the
prospects of a road-trip sweep looked good.
But the Ducks opened the second half with
a seven-point spurt, leaving a somewhat
stunned Stanford team down by three.
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery called
a timeout to regroup, but it may already
have been too late.
As the fans at Mac Arthur Court, one of
the Pac 10's toughest arenas in which to
pick up a road victory, began to heat up,
the Cardinal continued to struggle and the
Ducks, boosted by some clutch free-throw
shooting (20-of-28 in the second half),
rolled to a 14-point win.
"They had a run to open the second
half," Montgomery said. "That's the one
thing you don't want to happen. ... We
made a lot of mental mistakes. Somehow,
someway, something wasn't there."
The loss compounded the already con
fusing race for second place in the Pac-10.
Going into this weekend, five Pac-10 teams
(Arizona State, OSU, Oregon, Washington
State, and Stanford) were knotted at three
losses apiece, behind unbeaten and proba

bly untouchable Arizona, now 9-0 in con
ference play and 20-1 overall.
Now, there are five teams with four
losses each, and the chase will begin anew
on Thursday. The only change in the con
ference was UCLA, whose two wins this
weekend moved the Bruins ahead of WSU,
as the Cougars dropped a pair in Southern
California to fall a game back at five losses.
"We're in the hunt," Stanford guard
Terry Taylor said, "I didn't think it would
be this close with so many teams in it, but
I guess the other teams are proving me
wrong."
After losing to California last Thursday,
Saturday's game was crucial to the Ducks'
hopes. "We needed a win badly," Oregon
guard Anthony Taylor said. "If we lost
tonight, the chances of having a successful
season were gone."
"That was a very special win for us,"
Oregon Coach Don Monson said. "We were
down after the California game, but we
came back."
Oregon played well, but the Cardinal
also hurt itself. After shooting 70 percent
from the field against the Beavers, Stanford
managed to hit only 37 percent Saturday
on a 23-of-63 night.
The Ducks didn't do a who'e lot better,
hitting only 41 percent for the game, but
they did win the battle at the line, tallying
25 points from the charity stripe compared
to Stanford's 14.
"Obviously we didn't shoot the ball well.
We took good shots, but the ball didn't go
down," Montgomery said.
On the boards the Cardinal, a very good
rebounding team on the year (beating op
ponents by an average of nearly seven
boards a game), was whipped by the hus
tling Ducks, 52-38. Most significantly, after

night at Oregon, where the Ducks handed the Cardinal its fourth
Pac-10 loss of the year.
being up a couple of rebounds in
the first half, Stanford was out
boarded 34-18 in the second
stanza.
"We got out-rebounded in the
second half. Therein lies the
game," Montgomery said.
Also give some credit to the
Duck defense. Unlike the Beavers,
who couldn't stop power forward
Howard Wright and center Greg
Butler inside, Oregon did a good
job of both keeping the ball away
from the big men and muscling
them when it got there. Butler,
who scored 24 points on 14 shots
against OSU, took only six shots
on Saturday and finished with
just eight points.
"They have this match-up zone
and they match-up very well,"
Butler said. "But we also had a
real hard time running our of
fense. That makes defense a lot
easier."
Wright led the Cardinal with
21 points, but the baskets
definitely came the hard way.
Wright, shooting .651 on the
season, went 7-of-18 from the
floor, logging seven points at the
free throw line. The only other
Stanford player to reach double

figures was guard Todd Lichti at
15.
Compare that to the Ducks,
who were led by Taylor's 26 points
and had four players in double
figures. Three of those players —
6-foot-6 forward Randy Grant, 6-6
forward Keith Balderston and 6-1
guard Frank Johnson — also
turned in double-figure rebound
ing totals. Only Wright, with 12,
managed that for the Cardinal.
Oregon's Taylor, currently the
Pac-10's leading scorer at 20.9 a
game, had his usual high scoring
night, but like Wright's the points
didn't come so easily. It was a
pretty dismal shooting night for
Taylor; covered well by Lichti,
Taylor hit only 9-of-25 shots (one
of which was a three-pointer)
from the field. The senior did,
however, convert seven of nine
free throws to boost his total to
26.
"Todd did an excellent job on
Taylor," Montgomery said.
For his part, Lichti was reason
ably pleased with his effort. "I
could've done a better job — a
couple of times I lost sight of him.
But somebody does have to do it.
It's a challenge to me."
The next challenge for the Car
dinal, and it is a formidable one,
will be a home game next
Thursday with the No. 1 Arizona
Wildcats, who are currently un
beaten in Pac-10 play.
