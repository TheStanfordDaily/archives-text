## Oregon rebounds to upset cagers, 80-66

EUGENE, Ore. — In this
league, it looks like only
Arizona gets two wins on
the road.
After turning in a near
perfect second half against
Oregon State two nights

earlier, the Stanford men's basketball team
looked like every other Pacific 10 Confer
ence team on the road Saturday night as
it folded in the second stanza and fell to
the Oregon Ducks by the score of 80-66,
dropping the team's league record to 5-4,
13-7 overall.
With both teams shooting poorly and the
Cardinal up by four at halflime, 34-30, the
prospects of a road-trip sweep looked good.
But the Ducks opened the second half with
a seven-point spurt, leaving a somewhat
stunned Stanford team down by three.
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery called
a timeout to regroup, but it may already
have been too late.
As the fans at Mac Arthur Court, one of
the Pac 10's toughest arenas in which to
pick up a road victory, began to heat up,
the Cardinal continued to struggle and the
Ducks, boosted by some clutch free-throw
shooting (20-of-28 in the second half),
rolled to a 14-point win.
"They had a run to open the second
half," Montgomery said. "That's the one
thing you don't want to happen. ... We
made a lot of mental mistakes. Somehow,
someway, something wasn't there."
The loss compounded the already con
fusing race for second place in the Pac-10.
Going into this weekend, five Pac-10 teams
(Arizona State, OSU, Oregon, Washington
State, and Stanford) were knotted at three
losses apiece, behind unbeaten and proba

bly untouchable Arizona, now 9-0 in con
ference play and 20-1 overall.
Now, there are five teams with four
losses each, and the chase will begin anew
on Thursday. The only change in the con
ference was UCLA, whose two wins this
weekend moved the Bruins ahead of WSU,
as the Cougars dropped a pair in Southern
California to fall a game back at five losses.
"We're in the hunt," Stanford guard
Terry Taylor said, "I didn't think it would
be this close with so many teams in it, but
I guess the other teams are proving me
wrong."
After losing to California last Thursday,
Saturday's game was crucial to the Ducks'
hopes. "We needed a win badly," Oregon
guard Anthony Taylor said. "If we lost
tonight, the chances of having a successful
season were gone."
"That was a very special win for us,"
Oregon Coach Don Monson said. "We were
down after the California game, but we
came back."
Oregon played well, but the Cardinal
also hurt itself. After shooting 70 percent
from the field against the Beavers, Stanford
managed to hit only 37 percent Saturday
on a 23-of-63 night.
The Ducks didn't do a who'e lot better,
hitting only 41 percent for the game, but
they did win the battle at the line, tallying
25 points from the charity stripe compared
to Stanford's 14.
"Obviously we didn't shoot the ball well.
We took good shots, but the ball didn't go
down," Montgomery said.
On the boards the Cardinal, a very good
rebounding team on the year (beating op
ponents by an average of nearly seven
boards a game), was whipped by the hus
tling Ducks, 52-38. Most significantly, after

Junior center Greg Butler's best efforts were not enough Saturday
night at Oregon, where the Ducks handed the Cardinal its fourth
Pac-10 loss of the year.
