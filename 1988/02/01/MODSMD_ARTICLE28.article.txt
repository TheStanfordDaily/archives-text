# Vlahov's return surprises Ducks
## 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
EUGENE, Ore. — Before anyone despairs com
pletely, there was some very good news Saturday
night in Eugene.
The game marked the return to action of Cardinal
forward Andrew Vlahov. Sidelined since Dec. 23
because of knee problems, the freshman from
Australia is now once again ready for action. Against
the Ducks, Vlahov scored eight points and grabbed
one rebound in 17 minutes of play. It may not have
been a career performance for the freshman, but
it did bode well for the rest of the Stanford season.
Before being forced to undergo knee surgery last
month, Vlahov was averaging 4.5 points and 4.2
rebounds per game and had started against both
San Francisco and UCLA.
As one of the first players off Coach Mike
Montgomery's bench, Vlahov brings the Cardinal
both more muscle and a deceptively good shooting
touch. After putting the body on a couple of Ducks,
Vlahov surprised the McArthur Court crowd by
nailing two three-pointers.
A six-foot-seven forward hitting a twenty-foot
jumper is certainly a pretty sight. For Vlahov,
however, just playing was a big relief.
"It's good to be back after being out so long,"
he said. "At first I was a little tenative, but I got
it out of my mind after I got into the game."
The knee, Vlahov said, is feeling fine, though it
took a little while to get used to playing with the
brace he now has to wear. "You do what you have
to do," he said.
For his teammates, Vlahov is a bit of security, a
full 225 pounds of it, ready to be called forth from
the bench. "He's so physical, so strong," center
Greg Butler said, "he's a force out there."
