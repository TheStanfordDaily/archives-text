# Swimmers lap ASU

The Stanford
women's swim
ming team contin
ued its campaign
to prove there is
little competition
for the "big two"

in the world of collegiate swim
ming Friday at deGuerre Pool.
The second-ranked Cardinal
soundly thumped No. 4 and pre
viously unbeaten Arizona State
164-104, adding to the belief that
Stanford and top-ranked Texas
are far ahead of the rest in the
race for the NCAA title.
"I was really happy with it (the
meet)," freshman Barb Metz said.
"Everyone swam really well."
Metz swam pretty well herself.
After the Stanford A team took
the 400-yard medley relay to open
the meet, Metz led the whole way
in winning the 1,000 freestyle.
The freshman also scored with a
second in the 200 butterfly and
a third in the 500 free as the
Cardinal upped its record to 5-0.
Metz was only one of many
Stanford stars, however, on a day
when those in the cardinal-and
white could do no wrong. Perhaps
the most promising sign was the
return of senior Susan Rapp to
the breaststroke events.
Rapp, who has spent the last
few years here fighting off sore
knees and an injured ankle, swam
the 200 breast for the first time
since she set an NCAA record at
last year's championships and
won the race while posting an

NCAA qualifying time.
Rapp also took a second in the
100 breast and contributed to two
relay victories. "I was really
pleased," she said, adding that her
knees and ankle "held up okay. I
was pleased with my time.
"We knew ASU had a lot of
good swimmers and a definite
chance to beat us."
Other big winners for the Car
dinal include juniors Michelle
Donahue (100 and 200 back
stroke), Aimee Berzins (100 and
200 free), Jenna Johnson (50 free
and 100 fly) and sophomore Katie
Connors (one-meter diving). The
400 free relay team (Berzins,
Rapp, freshman Jody Smith and
Johnson) also won, qualifying for
the NCAAs in the process.

Stanford's 400 free
relay team qualified
for the NCAA
Championships.

The Cardinal now has this week
to prepare for No. 1 Texas, the
four-time defending national
champions. The meet is at
deGuerre this Saturday at noon
and will give Stanford a chance
to avenge a narrow 17-point loss
to the Longhorns at NCAAs last
year.
"We'll be resting a little more
for the Texas meet to get
everybody to make cuts," Rapp
said. "It should be a much faster
meet. We'll be psyched to try and
win it."
