# Group assails surgeon general's AIDS-test plan
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
The Surgeon General's proposal to con
duct AIDS tests for every student at one
major U.S. university drew heavy
criticism from a student group involved
with combatting the epidemic on campus.
The goal of the proposal, forwarded by
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop at a
world AIDS conference last Wednesday
in London, is to gather representative
data on the spread of the Acquired Im
mune Deficiency Syndrome among young
adults in an urban setting.
Koop's project would be "horrendously
expensive" and waste money "that would
be much better spent on AIDS education,

research and treatment," according to
senior Daniel Bao, director of the Stan
ford AIDS Education Project.
Koop did not specify whether the tests
would be mandatory or voluntary, but
Bao said "it is difficult to believe he could
ask for mandatory testing."
"We (the AIDS Education Project) be
lieve that anonymous, voluntary testing
has use, but we are against mass man
datory screenings."
Bao added that the proposal "brings
up a lot of questions, like will people
who test positive be told, and will they
receive counseling?"
"The testing would have to be abso
lutely voluntary, but that means a lot of
students would opt not to take the test,"

he said, noting that voluntary testing
raises questions about the accuracy of
data collected from a self-selected popu
lation sampling.
According to Bao, the cheapest AIDS
test would cost $30 per student, in ad
dition to the cost of counseling before
and after the test. A person tested for
the virus would need instruction in how
to interpret the results because they are
often ambiguous.
"The costs would be outrageous," he
said. "We need that money to go to AIDS
education."
Koop said a university has not yet been
chosen, but would probably be one in a
large city with a student body of around
25,000, making Stanford an unlikely

choice.
Dr. Paul Walters, director of the Cowell
Student Health Center and responsible
for monitoring the overall health of the
student body, said he had not yet
prepared comment on the proposal.
Although the incidence of AIDS in the
United States is highest among 20- to
24-year-olds, the greatest number of Cal
ifornia cases — 5,153 as of Dec. 31, 1987
— were reported among 30- to 39-year
olds. Since the disease was identified in
1981, 11,181 cases have been reported
in California.
According to Pete Weisser, information
officer for the California Department of
Health Services, the number of AIDS

cases in California for 20- to 29-year-olds
is 1,902, less than 30- to 39-year-olds
and 40- to 49-year-oldi.
Bao said no accurate data is available
detailing the presence of AIDS at Stan
ford, but that a project to commemorate
Stanford AIDS victims has turned up 24
names.
He added that only three of those were
recent students, and the names collected
by the project are "only a minority of
those from the Stanford community who
have died" as a result of AIDS.
Koop said the federal government is
also considering a similar testing proposal
to perform mass screenings at a few high
schools across the nation.
