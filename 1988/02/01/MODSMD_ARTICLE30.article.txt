# Spikers fall at UCLA, UCSB

As expected, the opponents
weren't pushovers.
Stanford's young volleyball
team had a rough weekend,
losing their first Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association
matches of the year to two of

the nation's top teams. Friday in Los Angeles
the Cardinal fell to the mighty UCLA Bruins,
15-5, 12-15, 15-10, 15-10, while UC-Santa Bar
bara crushed a mentally drained Cardinal
squad the next night, 15-11, 15-10, 15-4.
"We need to be more consistent on the side
out part of our game,'" Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm said. "Our passing was inconsistent,
forcing us to struggle to score against our
opposition's serve."
Against UCLA, that flaw in Stanford's game
was especially noticeable. Not because the
team played worse against the Bruins (indeed,
quite the opposite is true), but because the
Cardinal lost some key opportunities to stay
in the match as a result of their inability to
effectively return some powerful UCLA serves.
"UCLA served better. . . that was the dif
ference," Sturm said. "We got stuck in a couple
of rotations and were unable to side-out from
particular offensive sets."
The Bruins were once again led by Ail-
Americans Matt Sonnichsen and Don
Dendinger. Dendinger recorded a number of
winning hits to go along with his match-high
14 blocks. Sonnichsen almost flawlessly led
the UCLA offense that Sturm called "typical"

and "effective."
There were some bright spots,
however, in the frustrating loss
to the Bruins. Sophomore Dan
Hanan played very well, and soph
omore setter Parker Blackman
seemed to settle comfortably into
his role as the leader of the Car
dinal offense.
The match Saturday night
against UCSB was a whole differ
ent ballgame. Stanford, though up
by large margins in the first two
games, was unable to compete
mentally with the experienced

Gauchos. This translated into a
loss of both those leads and a
shut-out by the team from five
hours down the coast.
The Cardinal players, ahead 7-2
in game one, "beat themselves"
according to Sturm. "We had a
number of chances to increase our
lead, but squandered them," he
said. "Serving errors were espe
cially damaging to our team in
the opening game."
"We were right there, even
against Santa Barbara," Hanan
said, "but we weren't able to
maintain a high level of concen
tration when we had to. We
couldn't score the big points."
