# Spikers fall at UCLA, UCSB

As expected, the opponents
weren't pushovers.
Stanford's young volleyball
team had a rough weekend,
losing their first Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association
matches of the year to two of

the nation's top teams. Friday in Los Angeles
the Cardinal fell to the mighty UCLA Bruins,
15-5, 12-15, 15-10, 15-10, while UC-Santa Bar
bara crushed a mentally drained Cardinal
squad the next night, 15-11, 15-10, 15-4.
"We need to be more consistent on the side
out part of our game,'" Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm said. "Our passing was inconsistent,
forcing us to struggle to score against our
opposition's serve."
Against UCLA, that flaw in Stanford's game
was especially noticeable. Not because the
team played worse against the Bruins (indeed,
quite the opposite is true), but because the
Cardinal lost some key opportunities to stay
in the match as a result of their inability to
effectively return some powerful UCLA serves.
"UCLA served better. . . that was the dif
ference," Sturm said. "We got stuck in a couple
of rotations and were unable to side-out from
particular offensive sets."
The Bruins were once again led by Ail-
Americans Matt Sonnichsen and Don
Dendinger. Dendinger recorded a number of
winning hits to go along with his match-high
14 blocks. Sonnichsen almost flawlessly led
the UCLA offense that Sturm called "typical"
