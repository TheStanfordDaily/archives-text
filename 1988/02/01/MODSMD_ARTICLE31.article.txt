## Stanford nine go 0-1

SANTA CLARA — Stanford
freshman Mike Mussina
looked good in his collegiate
pitching debut yesterday.
Santa Clara's Victor Cole
looked even better.
Pro scouts toting radar

guns were clustered in the stands to watch
Mussina, one of the most sought-after
recruits in the nation last year, but Cole
stole the show. The junior right-hander,
who was moved out of the bullpen and
into the starting rotation this year, went
all the way for the Broncos, surrenduring
only three hits — all singles — as Santa
Clara beat the defending national champion
Cardinal 3-2 at Buck Shaw Stadium.
"I felt strong going in," Cole said. "We
played them five times in the fall; I know
the hitters."
"He pitched a real good game . .
changed speeds well," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "We just didn't hit the ball
at all."
It was the first full game of the season
for both teams, whose game last Friday at
Sunken Diamond was suspended because
of rain in the bottom of the third inning.
Stanford leads 2-0 in that game, which will
be completed at 2:30 p.m. today at Sunken
Diamond. The Cardinal then hosts UC-
Davis at 2 p.m. tomorrow.
Yesterday's game shaped up early as a
pitcher's duel, and was scoreless through
five-and-a-half innings. Mussina had scat
tered four hits through five, but immedi
ately got in trouble in the sixth. Bronco
third baseman Jeff Healey led off the in

ning with a long single into the left
centerfield gap, and scampered to third on
Troy Buckley's sharp single down the left
field line.
Junior Steve Chitren came on in relief
of Mussina, and Bronco shortstop Matt
Toole lined Chitren's first pitch into left
for a single that scored Healey. A sacrifice
bunt and an intentional walk loaded the
bases with one out and Vince Machi coming
to bat.
"I was looking for a fastball, and adjust
ing to anything different," Machi said. He
looked in the right place and stroked a
single into shallow right-center to score
Buckley and Toole and put the Broncos
up 3-0.
Stanford mustered only one threat the
rest of the way. In the seventh, a walk, a
single by Doug Robbins and another walk
loaded the bases with one out. Brian
Johnson then flied out deep to center to
score Ed Sprague and move pinch-runner
Albert Richardson to third. Richardson
came home on a wild pitch by Cole to make
the score 3-2, but that was all the scoring
for the Cardinal.
The highly touted Mussina, from Mon
toursville, Pa., looked sharp in his debut.
Although he struggled some with his con
trol, he walked only one and struck out
three in five innings. "I felt pretty confi
dent, but I was a little nervous at the
beginning," he said. "There's an adjust
ment you have to make in control between
high school and college. ... I could spot
my fastball (today) but I didn't have very
good control of my curve."
The Cardinal will get another shot at
the Broncos today. Senior Lee Plemel, who
started the game Friday, will be on the
mound again for the Cardinal.
