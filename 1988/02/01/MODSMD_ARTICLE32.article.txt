# Hoops moves to 18-1

### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team continued its
fast-breaking ways in this
weekend's homestand
against Oregon and Oregon
State. In a pair of up-tempo
games, the No. 10 Cardinal

handily defeated Oregon 84-48 on Friday
night and Oregon State 71-48 on Saturday
to advance its record to 18-1 overall and
6-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Thanks to an upset victory by Washing
ton State over No. 15 USC, Stanford now
has sole possession of second place in the
league behind No. 11 Washington. The
Beavers and the Ducks share the fifth spot.
Oregon found itself in deep trouble al
most immediately after tip-off, when Stan
ford freshman Soi\ja Henning sank an 18-
footer to put the Cardinal on the
scoreboard. The Stanford squad then raced
off to a 16-0 lead in just three minutes,
and thanks to consistently tough defense
finished the half with a comfortable 37-20
lead.
"I expected it would be closer," senior
forward Kami Anderson said. "I think that
they somewhat gave up. Once it was 14-0,
they stopped playing hard. They came
within 15 during the game, but they
stopped playing hard and got into foul
trouble."
The most notable problem for the Ducks
was their main weapon Stephanie
Kasperski, who fouled out with 10:41 left
in the second half and just six points, five

rebounds and no blocks to her credit. Con
sidering that the 6-7 forward leads the
nation in blocked shots and her team in
scoring, the game was basically over after
her exodus.
Nobody told this to Evon Asforis,
however. The junior forward exploded in
the last four minutes to tally 10 points,
six rebounds and two blocks in the game,
only the third time in her collegiate career
that Asforis has attained double-figures in
scoring.
Sophomore guard Jennifer Azzi led the
Stanford offensive drive with a game-high
15 points and six assists. Exploiting the
holes left by the Ducks on the perimeter,
Azzi uncorked 4-of-7 three-point shots to
maintain the Cardinal's lead throughout
the contest.
Henning and freshman forward Tammy
Svoboda excelled as well, tallying 11 points
each. Svoboda also worked hard enough
on the boards to pull down a game-high
eight rebounds.
"Our team came out ready to play, and
I think everyone played really well," Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I
thought people concentrated on doing the
right thing, and I was pleased with how
everybody played. Overall, I thought it was
a good team effort."
The Cardinal had a more difficult battle
with the wily Beavers. Employing its
trademark heavy-pressure defense and
transition offense, Oregon State forced 12
Stanford turnovers and gave the Cardinal
quite a series of scares.

Oregon State forward Chelle Flamoe was atop the
Pac-10 in scoring going Into the game, but Jennifer
Azzi got the upper hand Friday night.

The tactic, however, only
delayed the inevitable. Though
plagued by small errors in execu
tion, many creditable to the
Beaver's traps and screens, Stan
ford's versatile run-and-gun of
fense bolstered an aggressive
defense to seal the Cardinal's 18th
win of the season.
Freshman Trisha Stevens
topped Stanford's scoring with 14

points, followed by forward Katy
Stedirig and Azzi at 12 each. The
sophomores' offensive efforts
made them only the 16th and
17th Stanford women to score
over 500 career points in school
history.
The Beavers were led by fresh
man center Kari Parriott, who set
the game's standards with 17
points and 10 rebounds. Junior
guard Chelle Flamoe, who led the
Pac-10 in scoring through last
week with an average of 21.5
points per game, was held to just
two points in the first half and
14 points in the game.
