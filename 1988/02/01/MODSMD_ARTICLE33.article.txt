# Titan grapplers pin Cardinal down

### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
After an im
pressive road
victory over
Humboldt State
last week
end, the Stan
ford wrestling

team returned to Maples
Pavilion Friday night for a
match with Fullerton State.
The Titans ruined the
homecoming, defeating the
Cardinal 28-11.
Fullerton held the Cardinal
scoreless through the first five
matches until sophomore Steve
Yarbrough stepped onto the
mat for his 158-pound match.
Yarbrough gave a clinic on
takedown technique en route
to a 19-6 decision, which gave
Stanford four team points.
Steve Buddie continued the
rally for Stanford at 167
pounds, coming behind from a
6-2 deficit to win his match
over Titan Paul Halwejin, 15-7.
At 177 pounds, Ron Perry
overcame Fullerton's Kenny
Jensen to post a 12-6 victory,

giving Stanford its third —
and, as it turned out, its last
— individual win of the eve
ning.
Terry Mclntyre, in the 190-
pound class, came into his
match against Titan Paul Reut
zel with a 1-1 record against
his opponent. He pummeled
and circled Reutzel throughout
the first period, but was even
tually defeated to drop the
match, 3-2.
"I think Terry was giving
him a little too much respect,"
said Stanford assistant coach
Mark Martel. "I know he can
beat him (Reutzel)."
With victory a mathematic
impossibility, Trent Smith
came up to try and vindicate
the meet for Stanford in the
heavyweight match. Unfortun
ately, Smith's efforts against
David Jones resulted in a 12-6
defeat, which ended the after
noon for the Cardinal.
"We're a pretty darn good
team right now," said Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel. "We're
just a little inconsistent."
