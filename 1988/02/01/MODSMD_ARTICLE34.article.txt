Summing up her
performance in
Sunday's meet,
sophomore Dina
Amoroso said,
"Well, I've left
room for improve-

ment, but the meet went OK over
all." Her comments serve as an
accurate reflection on the per
formance of the entire team.
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team made a clean showing
in its Maples Pavilion debut yes
terday, placing second in a meet
involving three other teams. With
a strong score of 180.75, the Car
dinal topped the University of Al
berta's score of 160.90 and the
University of British Columbia's
165.70. However, this was not
enough to displace No. 10
Arizona, who won the meet with
a score of 183.80.
An exceptional start on vault
helped to set the pace for the
Stanford team, led once again by
Alison McGann, whose clean
twisting vault earned a 9.5.
Amoroso followed with a powerful
9.40 lay-out tsukahara.
Moving to bars, several strong
routines bolstered the Cardinal

score. Jinny Rhee swung a smooth
routine with a difficult release
move to earn her a 9.40, and
Susan Banta hit a routine with a
clean dismount to receive a 9.20.
However, a bit of bad luck plagued
the latter half of the line-up and
scores dropped. Several Stanford
falls put Arizona into the lead by
.30.
On the beam, only Cheryl Doo,
with a score of 9.0, Becky Ashton,
9.10 and Cindy Boyd, 8.95, ex
ecuted clean routines, but their
efforts were not enough to bridge
the widening gap between the
Cardinal and the Wildcats.
Doo and Rhee came through for
the Cardinal once again on the
floor. Doo's energetic dance and
clean tumbling received a 9.25,
and Rhee's incredible piked
double back flip earned her a 9.20.
Sheri Evenson' crowd-pleasing
9.05 routine also helped reduce
the sting from others' falls and
breaks. Unfortunately, it was not
enough to repair the damage that
had been done, and the team fell
to Arizona.
However, the Cardinal did have
its successes. Amoroso placed
third in the all-around with a 36.0
total, and Rhee placed second with
an impressive 36.5.



Sophomore Becky Ashton's skill on the balance
beam highlighted Stanford's performance.
