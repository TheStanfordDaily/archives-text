# Men's swimming sixth
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
It was not a weekend to
cherish, but it was not a
complete fiasco.
The men's swim team
was beaten but not
humiliated in the pres
tigious Dallas Morning

News Classic Friday and Saturday. The
Cardinal's sixth place finish in the meet
of the top six squads in the nation
(Texas, Michigan, Berkeley, Florida,
Southern Methodist, and Stanford) was
not positive, but the team was encour
aged by a number of individual swims
and was alerted to its weaknesses in
regards to NCAA competition,
"The placing of the team looks a lot
worse than we really swam," tri-Captain
Sean Murphy said.
According to tri-Captain Anthony
Mosse, it was the stiffest competition
and the deepest teams Stanford had ever
faced in the Classic. Although some
swimmers did not perform as well as
they had hoped they would, a number
of competitiors had outstanding races,
swam seasonal bests, and swam under
or very close to NCAA qualifying times.
Sean Murphy won the 100-yard back
stroke (50.27) and Mosse was victorious

in the 200 butterfly (1:46.9), with both
times under the NCAA standard.
Murphy also took second in the 200
back (1:48.62) in a very close race with
last season's NCAA champion, and
Mosse took first in the 100 fly consola
tion heat. Freshman Matt Rodgers took
second in the 200 breaststroke (2:20.96),
and Matt Nance placed third in the 400
individual medley with times that nar
rowly missed meeting NCAA qualifica
tions.
Murphy, Mosse and Nance were all
pleased with their performances, and
were satisfied with where they are in
regards to training and competitive
times for this point of the season. In
addition, the three captains were excited
about a number of other team members'
swims, especially Rodgers'.
"Matt was really tough." Mosse said.
"Coming in as a freshman and swim
ming so strong so early in the season
is a tremendous boost to the team."
The captains felt the Cardinal's weak
spots were the relays and the sprint
events. However, rest is a big factor in
both of these sprinting areas, and the
squad does not cut down on traning
until the end of the season. In addition,
Stanford had to leave many of its top
sprinters home because of the eight man
limit.
