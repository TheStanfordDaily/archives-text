# Black fraternities, sororities try to define role in community

Black fraternity and sorority
members discussed Friday at
Ujamaa House the need to better
publicize their organizations' pos
itive and independent roles on
campus and in the community.
The meeting, attended by al
most 40 students and hosted by
the Black Greek Letter Council,
addressed various concerns of the
black Greek community, focusing
on it? relations with the Interfra
ternity Council and the Inter
sorority Council.
The BGLC is an independent
organization, made up of the
presidents of th-Â» three black fra
ternities and two sororities. Al
though the BGLC performs ad
ministrative functions similar to
those of the IPC and the ISC, the
three organizations' goals are
completely different, according to
Mark Garner, president of the
BGLC.
The fact that non-Greeks often
assume that the BGLC is basically
the same as the IFC or the ISC
was cited at the meeting as a per
sistent problem for black frater
nities and sororities. In reality,
BGLC leaders said, the two com
munities espouse very different
goals.
The need for a clear definition
of the relationship between the
BGLC and the IFC and ISC was
later acknowledged by members
of each of the councils.

Until last year, when the Uni
versity officially recognized the
BGLC as a separate entity, the
University treated the group as
part of the IFC and ISC, Garner
said.
According to Garner, this was
an ill-informed policy. The BGLC
"deserves to be a separate group
(because) we arc a completely dif
ferent organization," he said.
Carol DeMattei, president of
the ISC, concurred, noting that
the BGLC has "no need to be a
part of the ISC and IFC," because
it functions as a separate group.
However, both DeMattei and
Bill Kubin, director of Public Re
lations for the IFC, expressed a
desire for increased communica
tion between the three councils.
The IFC would "like to see the
BGLC get more involved in our
activities," Rubin told The Daily
last night, adding that the IFC is
sometimes frustrated that two
groups don't work more closely
together.
Senior Mwenda Kudumu, a
member of one of the black
sororities, Delta Sigma Theta,
said the councils haven't always
worked together well because
members of the BGLC sometimes
feel pressure from the IFC and
the ISC to conform to their pledge
and rush methods.
While the larger Greek organi
zations on campus focus primarily
on sponsoring social events, the
black organizations focus more on
volunteer work, he said

In contrast to the larger frater
nities, social activities are "more
of an aside to the (black Greek
system's) charter of service,"
Garner said.
A significant portion of the
meeting was devoted to describing
the various community service
programs supported by the five
black Greek organizations.
Among other activities, the fra
ternities and sororities currently
participate in an East Palo Alto
High School advising program de
signed to help students complete
their high school educations; book
drives for a school in Kenya where
a member of a Stanford sorority
has gone to work; work at a local
homeless shelter; and a "Families
in Transition" program that pro
vides aid for teen-age mothers.
"We look and see the need for
help and apply it," one fraternity
member said of his involvement
in community service.
Aside from community service,
members of the Greek system dis
cussed some of the common
frustrations they experience as
members of black fraternities and
sororities.
Most students agreed that the
time commitment the Greek sys
tem demands of its members is
one of the largest drawbacks of
the organizations. However,
stereotyping by non-Greeks, who
know little about the BGLC, and
divisiveness within the black com-
