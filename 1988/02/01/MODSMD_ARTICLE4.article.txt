# Black fraternities, sororities try to define role in community
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Black fraternity and sorority
members discussed Friday at
Ujamaa House the need to better
publicize their organizations' pos
itive and independent roles on
campus and in the community.
The meeting, attended by al
most 40 students and hosted by
the Black Greek Letter Council,
addressed various concerns of the
black Greek community, focusing
on it? relations with the Interfra
ternity Council and the Inter
sorority Council.
The BGLC is an independent
organization, made up of the
presidents of th-» three black fra
ternities and two sororities. Al
though the BGLC performs ad
ministrative functions similar to
those of the IPC and the ISC, the
three organizations' goals are
completely different, according to
Mark Garner, president of the
BGLC.
The fact that non-Greeks often
assume that the BGLC is basically
the same as the IFC or the ISC
was cited at the meeting as a per
sistent problem for black frater
nities and sororities. In reality,
BGLC leaders said, the two com
munities espouse very different
goals.
The need for a clear definition
of the relationship between the
BGLC and the IFC and ISC was
later acknowledged by members
of each of the councils.

Until last year, when the Uni
versity officially recognized the
BGLC as a separate entity, the
University treated the group as
part of the IFC and ISC, Garner
said.
According to Garner, this was
an ill-informed policy. The BGLC
"deserves to be a separate group
(because) we arc a completely dif
ferent organization," he said.
Carol DeMattei, president of
the ISC, concurred, noting that
the BGLC has "no need to be a
part of the ISC and IFC," because
it functions as a separate group.
However, both DeMattei and
Bill Kubin, director of Public Re
lations for the IFC, expressed a
desire for increased communica
tion between the three councils.
The IFC would "like to see the
BGLC get more involved in our
activities," Rubin told The Daily
last night, adding that the IFC is
sometimes frustrated that two
groups don't work more closely
together.
Senior Mwenda Kudumu, a
member of one of the black
sororities, Delta Sigma Theta,
said the councils haven't always
worked together well because
members of the BGLC sometimes
feel pressure from the IFC and
the ISC to conform to their pledge
and rush methods.
While the larger Greek organi
zations on campus focus primarily
on sponsoring social events, the
black organizations focus more on
volunteer work, he said

In contrast to the larger frater
nities, social activities are "more
of an aside to the (black Greek
system's) charter of service,"
Garner said.
A significant portion of the
meeting was devoted to describing
the various community service
programs supported by the five
black Greek organizations.
Among other activities, the fra
ternities and sororities currently
participate in an East Palo Alto
High School advising program de
signed to help students complete
their high school educations; book
drives for a school in Kenya where
a member of a Stanford sorority
has gone to work; work at a local
homeless shelter; and a "Families
in Transition" program that pro
vides aid for teen-age mothers.
"We look and see the need for
help and apply it," one fraternity
member said of his involvement
in community service.
Aside from community service,
members of the Greek system dis
cussed some of the common
frustrations they experience as
members of black fraternities and
sororities.
Most students agreed that the
time commitment the Greek sys
tem demands of its members is
one of the largest drawbacks of
the organizations. However,
stereotyping by non-Greeks, who
know little about the BGLC, and
divisiveness within the black com-
munity were also cited as prob
lems.
Many members were discour
aged by accusations from within
the black community that black
fraternities and sororities are sim
ply "sell-outs" to the Western Hel
lenistic tradition that spawned
the development of the white
Greek system.
This divisiveness, however, is

"mending itself," Garner said. He
emphasized that BGLC members
are now working along with the
rest of the black community to
foster mutual support.
Although many members of the
black Greek system said they were
troubled by the negative publicity
their organizations have received
because of their rush traditions,
public opinion about their prac
tices is based on misperceptions,
BGLC members said.
Most members of black frater
nities and sororities spoke favor
ably about their experiences as

members.
Highlights of many students'
experiences included the exposure
to communities outside of Stan
ford, the support of their fellow
members and the ability of these
organizations to "get extremely
big things done," according to
senior Brian Bryant, a member
of Omega Psi Phi, a black frater
nity.
The negative publicity the black
Greek system has received is a
result of poor communication be
tween the Greek and non-Greek
communities, Garner said.

Non-Greeks rarely acquaint
themselves with the objectives
and work of the BGLC members,
he said.
"We have to lead people to
water," Garner said. "People
don't come out for what we
publicize," and yet they continue
to make derogatory generaliza
tions about black fratenities and
sororities without educating
themselves.
One member said that black
fraternal organizations "have let
the negative publicity get out of

homeless shelter; and a "Families
in Transition" program that pro
vides aid for teen-age mothers.
"We look and see the need for
help and apply it," one fraternity
member said of his involvement
in community service.
Aside from community service,
members of the Greek system dis
cussed some of the common
frustrations they experience as
members of black fraternities and
sororities.
Most students agreed that the
time commitment the Greek sys
tem demands of its members is
one of the largest drawbacks of
the organizations. However,
stereotyping by non-Greeks, who
know little about the BGLC, and
divisiveness within the black com-
munity were also cited as prob
lems.
Many members were discour
aged by accusations from within
the black community that black
fraternities and sororities are sim
ply "sell-outs" to the Western Hel
lenistic tradition that spawned
the development of the white
Greek system.
This divisiveness, however, is

"mending itself," Garner said. He
emphasized that BGLC members
are now working along with the
rest of the black community to
foster mutual support.
Although many members of the
black Greek system said they were
troubled by the negative publicity
their organizations have received
because of their rush traditions,
public opinion about their prac
tices is based on misperceptions,
BGLC members said.
Most members of black frater
nities and sororities spoke favor
ably about their experiences as

members.
Highlights of many students'
experiences included the exposure
to communities outside of Stan
ford, the support of their fellow
members and the ability of these
organizations to "get extremely
big things done," according to
senior Brian Bryant, a member
of Omega Psi Phi, a black frater
nity.
The negative publicity the black
Greek system has received is a
result of poor communication be
tween the Greek and non-Greek
communities, Garner said.

Non-Greeks rarely acquaint
themselves with the objectives
and work of the BGLC members,
he said.
"We have to lead people to
water," Garner said. "People
don't come out for what we
publicize," and yet they continue
to make derogatory generaliza
tions about black fratenities and
sororities without educating
themselves.
One member said that black
fraternal organizations "have let
the negative publicity get out of
hand" by not addressing it.
Black fraternity and sorority
members discussed Friday at
Ujamaa House the need to better
publicize their organizations' pos
itive and independent roles on
campus and in the community.
The meeting, attended by al
most 40 students and hosted by
the Black Greek Letter Council,
addressed various concerns of the
black Greek community, focusing
on it? relations with the Interfra
ternity Council and the Inter
sorority Council.
The BGLC is an independent
organization, made up of the
presidents of th-» three black fra
ternities and two sororities. Al
though the BGLC performs ad
ministrative functions similar to
those of the IPC and the ISC, the
three organizations' goals are
completely different, according to
Mark Garner, president of the
BGLC.
The fact that non-Greeks often
assume that the BGLC is basically
the same as the IFC or the ISC
was cited at the meeting as a per
sistent problem for black frater
nities and sororities. In reality,
BGLC leaders said, the two com
munities espouse very different
goals.
The need for a clear definition
of the relationship between the
BGLC and the IFC and ISC was
later acknowledged by members
of each of the councils.

Until last year, when the Uni
versity officially recognized the
BGLC as a separate entity, the
University treated the group as
part of the IFC and ISC, Garner
said.
According to Garner, this was
an ill-informed policy. The BGLC
"deserves to be a separate group
(because) we arc a completely dif
ferent organization," he said.
Carol DeMattei, president of
the ISC, concurred, noting that
the BGLC has "no need to be a
part of the ISC and IFC," because
it functions as a separate group.
However, both DeMattei and
Bill Kubin, director of Public Re
lations for the IFC, expressed a
desire for increased communica
tion between the three councils.
The IFC would "like to see the
BGLC get more involved in our
activities," Rubin told The Daily
last night, adding that the IFC is
sometimes frustrated that two
groups don't work more closely
together.
Senior Mwenda Kudumu, a
member of one of the black
sororities, Delta Sigma Theta,
said the councils haven't always
worked together well because
members of the BGLC sometimes
feel pressure from the IFC and
the ISC to conform to their pledge
and rush methods.
While the larger Greek organi
zations on campus focus primarily
on sponsoring social events, the
black organizations focus more on
volunteer work, he said

In contrast to the larger frater
nities, social activities are "more
of an aside to the (black Greek
system's) charter of service,"
Garner said.
A significant portion of the
meeting was devoted to describing
the various community service
programs supported by the five
black Greek organizations.
Among other activities, the fra
ternities and sororities currently
participate in an East Palo Alto
High School advising program de
signed to help students complete
their high school educations; book
drives for a school in Kenya where
a member of a Stanford sorority
has gone to work; work at a local
homeless shelter; and a "Families
in Transition" program that pro
vides aid for teen-age mothers.
