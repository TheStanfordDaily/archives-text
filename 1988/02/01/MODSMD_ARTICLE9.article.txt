# Candidates blast Contra-aid proposal
## 12th District contenders meet at Kresge 
### Matthew Poppe 
Republican and Democratic
candidates for the 12th Congres
sional District blasted President
Reagan's proposed Contra aid
program during a panel discussion
on national security issues at
Kresge Friday night.
A capacity crowd of district
voters — mostly area residents
rather than students — filled
Kresge to see the first public
meeting of the candidates.
Candidates in attendance in
cluded Democrats Jim Garrison,
a Mountain View businessman,
San Mateo County Supervisor
Anna Esheo and Hillsborough at
torney Sylvia Simmons.
San Jose attorney Robin
Yeamans, a declared Democratic
candidate, cancelled from the
forum at the last minute.
Yeamans is expected to announce
Feb. 8 that she will drop out of
the race and support Eshoo.
Stanford Law Prof. Tom
Campbell represented the
Republicans. First-term incum
bent Ernie Konnyu, Campbell's
foe in the June primary, did not
attend.
The four candidates present
were unanimous in their con
demnation of the Contra aid pro
gram, which the House will vote
on Wednesday. Ernie Konnyu's
absence was especially significant
at this point since he is expected

to vote in favor of the program.
"I think that Ronald Reagan
should follow Nancy Reagan's
slogan, 'Just Say No'," Eshoo
said.
"America has to stand for
peace," Garrison said.
While Campbell agreed with the
Democratic candidates, he in
sisted that the Soviets must con
currently end aid to the
Nicaraguan government for the
United States to make such a
move.
In contrast, Konnyu announced
last week that he favors the $36.5
million aid package to the Con
tras, a switch from his earlier
stance.
The forum was sponsored by
the Political Impact Coalition of
Northern California (PIC-PAC), a
newly formed nonpartisan politi
cal action committee devoted to
peace and national security. The
forum was part of PIC-PAC's
deliberations over which candi
date to endorse. The endorsed
candidate will receive up to
$10,000.
The 12th District, which runs
from San Jose to Menlo Park and
includes Stanford, has been a Re
publican stronghold since 1960.
The candidates responded to a
series of questions from a panel,
followed by a period of questions
from the audience.
