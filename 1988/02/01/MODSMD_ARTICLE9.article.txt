# Candidates blast Contra-aid proposal
## 12th District contenders meet at Kresge 
### Matthew Poppe 
Republican and Democratic
candidates for the 12th Congres
sional District blasted President
Reagan's proposed Contra aid
program during a panel discussion
on national security issues at
Kresge Friday night.
A capacity crowd of district
voters — mostly area residents
rather than students — filled
Kresge to see the first public
meeting of the candidates.
Candidates in attendance in
cluded Democrats Jim Garrison,
a Mountain View businessman,
San Mateo County Supervisor
Anna Esheo and Hillsborough at
torney Sylvia Simmons.
San Jose attorney Robin
Yeamans, a declared Democratic
candidate, cancelled from the
forum at the last minute.
Yeamans is expected to announce
Feb. 8 that she will drop out of
the race and support Eshoo.
Stanford Law Prof. Tom
Campbell represented the
Republicans. First-term incum
bent Ernie Konnyu, Campbell's
foe in the June primary, did not
attend.
The four candidates present
were unanimous in their con
demnation of the Contra aid pro
gram, which the House will vote
on Wednesday. Ernie Konnyu's
absence was especially significant
at this point since he is expected

to vote in favor of the program.
"I think that Ronald Reagan
should follow Nancy Reagan's
slogan, 'Just Say No'," Eshoo
said.
"America has to stand for
peace," Garrison said.
While Campbell agreed with the
Democratic candidates, he in
sisted that the Soviets must con
currently end aid to the
Nicaraguan government for the
United States to make such a
move.
In contrast, Konnyu announced
last week that he favors the $36.5
million aid package to the Con
tras, a switch from his earlier
stance.
The forum was sponsored by
the Political Impact Coalition of
Northern California (PIC-PAC), a
newly formed nonpartisan politi
cal action committee devoted to
peace and national security. The
forum was part of PIC-PAC's
deliberations over which candi
date to endorse. The endorsed
candidate will receive up to
$10,000.
The 12th District, which runs
from San Jose to Menlo Park and
includes Stanford, has been a Re
publican stronghold since 1960.
The candidates responded to a
series of questions from a panel,
followed by a period of questions
from the audience.
The panelists included Coit
Blacker, co-director of the Center
for International Security and
Arms Control, and Condoleezza
Rice, associate professor of polit
ical science. The event was
moderated by Judge LaDoris Cor
dell of the Santa Clara County
Municipal Court.
The program began with a
statement by each candidate on
the definition of national security.
The Democrats expressed a con
sensus view that support of a
strong national defense required
strength at home.
"We cannot be a leader of
families of democracy abroad if
we don't tend to the health of
our families here at home," Eshoo
said.
Simmons' view was similar.
"Defense, economic vitality, and
education — these are the keys
to national security."
Campbell, though, stressed U.S.
strength on the international
scene, strongly supporting the
Reagan administration. Campbell
pointed to Reagan's success in
pressuring the Soviets to remove
their forces from Afghanistan.
Responding to questions from
the panel, the candidates also

agreed on their support of the
recently signed INF treaty, which
abolished intermediate range nu
clear weapons from both U.S. and
Soviet arsenals.
With the exception of Simmons,
they were also confident that the
agreement could be verified.
"This INF agreement is the be
ginning of a whole new range of
reducing arms in the world, and
we got there because we were
strong," Campbell said. He
credited this accomplishment to
Reagan, and supported the Stra
tegic Arms Reduction Talks as the
next step in the arms control proc
ess.
Further topics discussed in
cluded the possibility of establish
ing a Palestinian homeland, the
effect of American forces in the
Persian Gulf region, the conduct
of covert operations by the CIA
and the role of Congress in the
construction of U.S. military
strategy.
One of the few issues that
generated disagreement was
whether the Strategic Defense In
itiative violates the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic Missile Treaty.
Both Eshoo and Garrison
claimed that SDI violates the
ABM treaty, and that "Star Wars"
research should be terminated.
Simmons joined Campbell in sup
porting the program.
