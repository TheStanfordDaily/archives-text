# Seventy faculty endorse CUS Area One proposal
## 
### Eric Young 
Seventy faculty members
signed a statement released yes
terday supporting the controver
sial CUS Area One reform plan
to replace the current Western
Culture requirement with one en
titled "Culture, Ideas, and
Values."
Associate Prof, of Spanish and
Portugese Mary Pratt, one of
three professors collecting the
signatures, said the purpose of
the statement was to "give the
senate an idea of the depth and
breadth of faculty" who are in
terested in seeing the Area One
requirement change by abolishing
its core reading list and adding
emphasis to works by women and
minorities in the curriculum.
The document is "intended to
counter not just the Chace pro
posal, but a number of proposals
that retain the core list," she

added.
The Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies plan, if approved by
the Faculty Senate, would elimi
nate the core list of books now
common to all Western Culture
tracks. A counterproposal by Eng
lish Prof. William Chace would
retain the core list in a redesigned
W'estem Culture requirement.
The CUS plan is a slightly
modified version of recommenda
tions prepared last year by the
Western Culture Task Force.
The statement in support of the
CUS plan, co-authored by Anthro
pology Prof. Renato Rosaldo and
Classics and Comparative Litera
ture Prof. Gregson Davis, will be
distributed at this Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting. A vote
on plans for Area One reform is
not expected until the senate's
Feb. 18 meeting.
Rosaldo said the CUS plan
should be adopted because "the

whole idea of what it is to study
culture has changed." He said
some faculty members are dis
couraged from teaching the cur
rent Western Culture require
ment because of the limitations
the core list places on the course.
Rosaldo added that students
now live in a more interdependent
world, and that they need to study
under faculty members who pre
viously felt alienated and excluded
by the program because of the
existence of the core list.
Bearing 40 signatures of West
ern Culture lecturers and faculty
members, the proposal first ap
peared Jan. 23 before the Faculty
Senate. It now has 56 names of
faculty from departments in the
humanities and 14 in various
other departments. The coordina
tors said yesterday they are still
working to collect more names.
Yesterday Chace said he was
neither surprised nor concerned
about the number of signators
from departments in the
humanities. His first reaction to
the statement was praise for the
diversity of opinion in the Uni
versity.
He added that the only measure
of the Western Culture debate's
success would come "in a Par
liamentary way" when the Fac
ulty Senate votes on the matter
later this month.
Several members of "Save the
Core" — a student group that
favors the Chace plan — said
when contacted last night that
they haven't seen the statement
supporting the CUS plan. Never
theless, they expressed concern
that passage of the CUS plan
might cause the deterioration of
the Western Culture experience
for undergraduates.
According to Save the Core

member Laura Headrick, a soph
omore, if the core list is
eliminated, the common ground
for the study of humanities would
disappear.
Davis said such worries are un
founded. People who make such
charges have not "read the letter
effectively," he said.
