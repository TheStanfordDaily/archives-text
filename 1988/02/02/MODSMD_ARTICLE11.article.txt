# Residents fight dorm closing
## San Jose State students sue to stay in 'unsafe' structure 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
In contrast to former Roble Hall
residents, when San Jose State
officials' announced the closing of
a student family housing complex
because it was seismically unsafe,
San Jose State students reacted
by taking their university to
court.
San Jose State officials an
nounced in November that the
100 student families living in
Spartan City must evacuate their
residences by Jan. 15 because the
structure is an earthquake and
fire hazard, according to Richard
Staley, Public Information Officer
for San Jose State.
Attorney Jen Fujioka of the Le
gal Aid Society of Santa Clara
County disagreed with the uni
versity decision to close the 10
barracks, which were transferred
from the Richmond Naval
Shipyard after World War 11.
Fujioka said yesterday that the
facility, a one-story wood struc
ture mounted on concrete footing,
is no less safe than any other
campus buildings.

Roble was closed in December
by Stanford officials because its
outer walls, composed of hollow
clay tiles, were judged unable to
support its concrete floors in the
event of a mayor earthquake.
"Frankly, I do not think the
(San Jose) university had
seriously studied the building,"
said Fujioka, who is representing
the Spartan City residents. "[The
university] had other intentions
for closing it down."
Staley said about 60 families
have moved out, each using
$1,000 in relocation money the
university gave the residents to
find new housing. But 40 families
have remained to fight the deci
sion to close the facility, which is
the only on-campus university
housing open to married students
and students with children.
Last week, the residents won a
court injunction that will allow
them to stay in the residence until
Aug. 1, at which time the
residence will close.
However, several residents said
they will not stop with this tem
porary decision. According to
Fujioka and Spartan City resi

dents Susan Marsland and Fran
cois Larrivee, a $2.5 million suit
for emotional compensation has
been filed against the university,
charging that the university has
"denied equal access to education"
and is "discriminatory" against
married students and students
with children. "If the students
can't get housing, the university
has to pay for some of its sin,"
Fujioka said.
Roble resident assistants said
that, unlike the San Jose State
students, they have "absolutely
no interest" in suing Stanford for
emotional compensation, accord
ing to senior D.J. Dull, formerly
the head resident assistant in
Roble. "If anything we are trying
to put this behind us," he said.
Leonard Adler, a former Roble
resident and member of the Coun
cil of Presidents, said he would
consider taking action to win emo
tional compensation if other Roble
residents expressed an interest in
suing the University. "[Stanford]
had a responsiblity. It might give
a message to other schools to be
more safety responsible," Adler
said.
