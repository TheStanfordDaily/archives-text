Schultz, Shevardnadze to meet
MOSCOW — Secretary of State George
Shultz will confer in Moscow Feb. 21-23 with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
to prepare for another Soviet-American sum
mit meeting, it was announced yesterday.
It will be the first in a series of talks between
Shultz and Shevardnadze in advance of Pres
ident Reagan's first visit to the Soviet Union
for his fourth conference with Kremlin leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
Shultz and Shevardnadze will focus on
prospects for a 50 percent reduction in stra
tegic nuclear weapons by the time Reagan and
Gorbachev meet, probably in the last week of
May or the first week in June.
Reagan and Gorbachev signed a treaty to
eliminate ground-launched intermediate nu
clear forces during their Washington summit
last December but both sides have said an
agreement on halving the number of the most
powerful nuclear weapons would be more dif
ficult to achieve.
A senior Western diplomat familiar with the
Soviet-American arms control talks has said
that he felt there was "a 50-50 chance —
maybe a little better" that an agreement could
be ready by the time of the summit meeting.
Speaking on condition that he not be iden
tified, the diplomat said there was agreement
already "on most matters of principle" in the
strategic arms negotiations in Geneva. "But
there is still a lot of hard bargaining ahead,"
he added.
East bloc dissidents protest
WARSAW, Poland — Dissident activists in
Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and the So
viet Union staged demonstrations and issued
statements yesterday protesting repression in
Romania in an unprecedented instance of coor
dination among Warsaw Pact opposition move
ments.
In Warsaw and Budapest, hundreds of
people gathered outside the Romanian Em
bassy in mid-day rallies, while in Prague, about
60 people carried out a 24-hour hunger strike.
Activists in all three capitals switched off lights
in their apartments in a symbolic protest of
the drastic economic austerity suffered by
Romanians.
The protest actions were supported in a
statement by Soviet human-rights activist
Andrei Sakharov that was endorsed by four
other Soviet dissidents, Lev Timofeyev, Sergei
Kovalyov, Raisa Gogaroz and Naum Meiman.
The East European groups also issued state
ments and Polish activists unsuccessfully at
tempted to deliver a petition to Romanian
Embassy officials.
"We know . . . the enormous price you must
pay for fighting for the right to human dignity
and the right to live free of hunger and terror,"
said a statement addressed to Romanians and
signed by 49 Polish activists, including leaders
of the banned Solidarity trade union. "We
believe deeply that our shared dream for a
free and democratic central Europe will be
fulfilled."
Waldheim telegram disappears
BONN, West Germany — A West German
military historian flew to Yugoslavia Monday
in an effort to authenticate a World War II
telegram said to link Austrian President Kurt
Waldheim with Nazi war crimes, but if such
a telegram exists it seems to have disappeared.
The historian, Manfred Messerschmidt, a
member of a commission set up in Vienna to
review Waldheim's service as a lieutenant in
the German army, flew from Vienna to Zagreb
hoping to see the telegram, even though he
told reporters that "at present, no one knows
where it is."
According to Der Spiegel, a West German
news magazine, the telegram was found by a
Yugoslav military historian, Dusan Plenca,
who was quoted as saying that it "seriously
implicates" Waldheim in war crimes.
Waldheim, a former secretary general of the
United Nations, served as an intelligence of
ficer with a German army unit in the Balkans
from 1942 to 1945. He insists that he took
no part in any criminal activity.
A spokesman for Waldheim has said that
the Plenca telegram is apparently a forgery.
