# Violence worsens in Israel, 2 killed
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — Two Palestinian
demonstrators were shot to death yes
terday and up to 20 others were
wounded by Israeli gunfire in the
worst day of violence since before
Christmas in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
The deaths, which occurred near
Anabta, an Arab village about 60 miles
northwest of Jerusalem, were the first
unrest-related fatalities since Jan. 15
in the occupied territories. They
brought to at least 38 the number of
violent deaths since the anti-Israeli
riots began Dec. 9.
The shootings also reflected a will
ingness by the Israelis to resume the
use of lethal force after less severe
methods failed to curb the unrest.
Palestinian sources and Israeli army
spokesmen both reported the use of
live ammunition by troops throughout
the territories. But they differed as to
how many had been wounded and in
what circumstances.

The Palestine Press Service, a news
agency that is pro-Palestine Liberation
Organization and has widespread
sources in the area, said Israeli soldiers
killed Moayad Shaar, 21, and Mourad
Hamdallah, 17, in a demonstration at
a roadblock near Anabta. Four other
persons were wounded by gunfire, the
agency said, including a woman said
to be in serious condition with a bullet
in the chest.
An army spokesman described the
event as follows: "Several cars trave
ling in the area were stopped about
10:30 a.m. at a barricade by several
hundred demonstrators and were at
tacked. We don't know who did it but
there was shooting. We are checking."
There was a police vehicle among
those stopped, as well as buses carry
ing soldiers and cars with men in ci
vilian clothes, the army spokesman
said.
"When the attacks became severe,
several men got out and started

shooting," she went on. "We don't
know who did the shooting, soldiers
or civilians, but two men were killed
and a woman wounded."
Shortly afterward, an army patrol
arrived and opened fire, she said,
wounding two more demonstrators in
the legs.
If Israeli civilians were shown to be
involved in the killings, it would be
the second time non-military person
nel had killed Palestinians since the
unrest began. On Jan. 11, Israeli set
tlers from the West Bank killed one
Palestinian and wounded another.
Army officers said that eight Pales
tinians were shot and wounded al
together in demonstrations that
ranged from Jenin in the north of the
West Bank to the Bethlehem and
Hebron areas south of Jerusalem.
Other demonstrations elsewhere in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip were
dispersed with tear gas and rubber
bullets.

The Palestine Press Service and
other Arab sources said that at least
20 persons suffered gunshot wounds
in the course of the day. The news
agency provided names and ages to
support its account.
The army's sparse accounts made
no significant mention of beatings. For
about a week and a half, apparently
because of domestic and international
criticism of Israel's use of gunfire, the
military had limited itself to using
clubs and fists. But as the protesters
realized that they were not likely to
be shot, they increased their aggres
siveness.
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said
yesterday that the use of force, includ
ing shootings, will continue.
"The main aim is to achieve calm
by taking the initiative against the
participants and the instigators of vi
olent acts," he said in an Israel radio
