JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -
Black political feuding around Pieter
maritzburg claimed 19 more lives over the
weekend, police reported yesterday, and
there were fears of a further escalation in
the violence in Natal province.
Eleven people were killed Sunday, ac
cording to South Africa's national police
headquarters in Pretoria. The death toll
so far this year in Natal now stands at 108.
Police patrols found the bodies of five
young men at Sweetwaters, which is about
six miles west of Pietermaritzburg. The
bodies of three other men, all stabbed or
shot to death, were found at the town
Saturday.
Another victim, a 35-year-old woman,
had been stabbed more than 100 times,
according to policemen who found her body
at Taylor's Halt, about 12 miles west of
Pietermaritzburg. The body of a 70-year
old man who had also been stabbed
repeatedly was also found there.
"The killings have escalated even though
there are large numbers of police in the
area," Peter Kerchhoff of the Pieter
maritzburg Agency for Christian Social
Awareness commented. "There is a general
feeling of despair, of gloom, because there
seems to be no end to the killing."
More than 380 people have died in the
Natal fighting over the past 13 months,
and the violence around Pietermaritzburg,
the provincial capital, is greater than vir
tually any since President Pieter Botha
imposed a national state of emergency in
June 1986 to curb the spreading civil un
rest.
The fighting in Natal stems from the
intense rivalry between Inkatha, the poli
tically conservative, predominantly Zulu
movement led by Chief Mangosuthu But
helezi, and the United Democratic Front,
a coalition of more militant anti-apartheid
groups broadly aligned with the outlawed
African National Congress.
At stake in the fighting, outside observ
ers believe, is political control of Natal, the
traditional home of South Africa's 6 million
Zulus, the nation's largest ethnic group,
and the right to speak for them in any

future negotiations over a new political
system for the country.
The fighting was particularly intense
Sunday, according to residents of several
black townships in the area, as minibuses
and trucks filled with men — apparently
Inkatha members — armed with spears,
clubs and some guns, poured into areas
where UDF members live or areas that are
being contested. In addition to those killed,
a number were seriously injured, the police
said.
The clashes continued yesterday, accord
ing to residents, but the police reportedly
used tear gas to disperse the mobs.
The police reported serious clashes at a
dozen other Natal towns over the weekend,
including one at Ashdown, west of Pieter
maritzburg, in which three young men,
apparently local UDF supporters, were
killed when fighting broke out during an
Inkatha rally.
Both Inkatha and the UDF, as well as
the African National Congress, have urged
an end to the violence, but the killers ap
pear to be beyond the control of black
political leaders.
"I want peace in Pietermaritzburg, and
I want it now," Buthelezi said last week.
"If there is anything I could have done to
bring about a cessation of hostilities in the
area, I would have long since done it."
He blamed the United Democratic Front
and the African National Congress for ths
prolonged trouble, ahd said: "There is an
undeclared war against Inkatha in the
Pietermaritzburg area. This is not imagina
tion. It is just fact."
Mediation efforts by local white busi
nessmen and clergymen, including
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the
Nobel Peace laureate, have all but collapsed
due to the feud's intense bitterness and
the desire by each side to avenge its losses.
But A.S. Chetty, a local UDF leader, said
yesterday that his organization is still will
ing to resume negotiations with Inkatha
to end the conflict.
