# Committee bows to Mecham demand
## 
### 
PHOENIX, Ariz. - Gov.
Evan Mecham won a show
down with the Arizona House
yesterday, forcing its impeach
ment committee to change its
procedures and exclude its at
torneys from directly question
ing Mecham about possible
malfeasance.
Mecham, already facing
criminal charges and a May 17
recall election, stunned com
mittee and House members
when he said that he would
answer their questions, but not
those of William French and
Paul Eckstein, attorneys
retained by the House to ex
plore allegations of fraud, per
jury, improper use of public
funds and obstruction of jus
tice.
"I think it is unfair and in
violation of my constitutional
rights to have two attorneys
cross-examine me without per
mitting my counsel to make
any objections," Mecham told
the panel.
Committee Chair Jim Skelly,
a Republican from Scottsdale,
Ariz., warned the governor that
that his refusal to follow the
rules was a violation of the
state constitution, but Mecham
stood his ground.
"If we want to continue this,
we should probably go to the
mat and find out legally," the
Republican governor said.
Skelly responded by telling
Mecham that he was adjourn
ing the hearings "until such
time as vou decide that you

will comply with our rules."
Following hastily called
caucuses, Republican and Dem
ocratic members acquiesced to
the governor's demands.
Under the new procedure,
the counsels waived their right
to ask questions, but are ex
pected to feed those questions
to House members when Mec
ham returns for scheduled
questioning by House members
Wednesday morning.
Under normal procedures,
witnesses before the panel have
been questioned by the House
counsels and then queried by
impeachment committee mem
bers.
