# Aide accuses Panama leader of corruption
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The
Panamanian leader, Gen. Manuel An
tonio Noriega, has obtained payoffs
and hidden profits of millions of dol
lars for himself and a group of
Panamanian military and civilian as
sociates by selling government services
and influence, according to a former
top Noriega political adviser and aide,
Jose Blandon.
The services sold by Noriega and
his associates include passports, visas,
airport landing rights and merchant
marine identification cards for crew
men aboard Panamanian-registered
vessels, said Blandon, who for several
months late last year was Noriega's
secret emissary to the Reagan admin
istration.
In more than eight hours of inter
views last weekend, Blandon charged
that Noriega had used his 4-year reign
as military commander-in-chief and de

facto ruler of Panama to convert the
government into a "criminal en
terprise."
After what were described as
repeated death threats, Blandon and
his family on Sunday were placed un
der 24-hour guard by the U.S. Mar
shals Service, according to informed
sources. Noriega fired Blandon last
month from his job as Panama's con
sul general in New York.
On Thursday, Blandon testified for
about five hours before a federal grand
jury in Miami that is investigating
Noriega's alleged ties to the
multibillion-dollar Latin American
drug trade. Federal prosecutors are
expected to seek an indictment soon,
possibly this week, sources said.
Noriega has repeatedly denied any
involvement in drug trafficking or
other corrupt activities. A Noriega
spokesman recently said Blandon's al

legations are "ridiculous."
The spokesman added that Blandon
was not part of Noriega's inner circle
and did not have access to the infor
mation he says he has.
In this weekend's interviews, Blan
don characterized Noriega's alleged in
volvement in drug trafficking as only
one component of a systematic pattern
of corruption.
Blandon compared Noriega to Fer
dinand Marcos of the Philippines, the
late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of
Iran and the late Anastasio Somoza
of Nicaragua. "They were corrupt,"
Blandon said. "Noriega is a crimi
nal. M
Blandon said that Noriega and his
associates derive profits and commis
sions from hidden interests thev al
legedly have in Panamanian busi
nesses. In particular, Blandon said,
they are active with firms that operate

in Panama's Colon free zone, a duty
free trading center through which mil
lions of dollars in high-technology
goods and other products are moved.
Blandon alleged that Noriega has a
hidden interest in a company that last
year was hired by Aeroflot, the Soviet
airline, to act as its agent in Panama.
He said he has been told that Noriega
has a 15 percent interest in the
Panamanian firm and is expected to
make millions of dollars from the
Aeroflot deal.
Blandon provided a copy of what he
said was the agreement, dated Aug.
6, 1987, between the Panamanian firm
and Aeroflot. He identified the person
signing the purported document for
the Panamanian firm as a close
Noriega associate who allegedly was
placed in charge of the firm to
safeguard Noriega's interest.
