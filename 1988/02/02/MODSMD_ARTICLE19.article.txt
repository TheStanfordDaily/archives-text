## 'Redskins' is racist 
### 
A RECENT PIECE in the
"Scorecard" section of
Sports Illustrated highlights
a growing controversy over the use
of "Indians" as a school nickname.
For decades, many Native
Americans have loudly and justly
protested that "Indian" nicknames
trivialize their heritage and per
petuate negative racial stereotypes.
Perpetuating the "savage war
monger" caricature insensitively
defines Native Americans as one
dimensional and limits under
standing of the diverse cultures
and histories of the many tribes
that have inhabited the United
States for centuries.
Although a few prominent uni
versities, led by Stanford and
Dartmouth, have long since
abolished their "Indian" labels,
many organizations in the world
of professional and amateur sports
continue to ignore concern about
the issue.
Social worker Phil St. John, a
Sioux from Minneapolis, Minn.,
recently began a drive to remove
"Indians" as the nickname of Min
neapolis' Southwest Secondary
School. According to St. John, a
white Southwest student wore
warpaint and a headband in the
stands during a basketball game
and behaved according to all the
appropriate "Indian" stereotypes
— war whoops and menacing ges
tures among them.
With the help of a local adver
tising agency, St. John created and
distributed a poster comparing the
"Indian" label to other racial epi
thets. According to Sports II

lustra ted, the poster proved so ef
fective that the school soon
changed its nickname to the
Lakers and the local board of ed
ucation banned from the city's
schools any nickname believed to
perpetuate racial stereotypes. "I
figured I had tolerated that kind
of stuff most of my life, and it was
time I did something," St. John
said.
Particularly disturbing is the
widespread use such names by
junior and senior high school ath
letic teams. Racial attitudes are
formed early, and it is irresponsible
for our country's educational in
stitutions to promote simplistic
and derogatory stereotypes of one
of our nation's most persecuted
minority groups.
Perhaps the most glaring exam
ple of the offensiveness of racially
based nicknames is an athletic
team very prominent in the minds
of many Americans right now: the
Washington Redskins.
It is indeed ironic that the foot
ball team that two days ago fielded
the first black quarterback ever to
play in a Super Bowl carries, in
the words of St. John, "the most
racist and derogatory name you
can use to describe the American
Indian people."
The success of St. John's efforts
in Minneapolis comes as an en
couraging sign that racial labels
need no longer grace the uniforms
of our country's athletic teams.
Such labels — and the racially
slanted behavior of unthinking
fans that often accompany them
— can and must be abolished.
