# Dean fears faculty hiring may suffer
## 
### David Dirks 
Stanford's Dean of Humanities and Sciences
said yesterday it may be "counterproductive" to
attempt to hire faculty specifically to teach
courses that meet the proposed "Cultures, Ideas
and Values" requirement, should the plan pro
posed by the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies be approved by the Faculty Senate later
this month.
Although Norman Wessells refused to either
support or condemn the CUS plan because he is
an ex-officio member of the Faculty Senate, he
circulated a letter last week to members of the
senate in which he wrote that tailoring depart
ment faculty searches "to meet an ex
tradepartmental general studies requirement" for
freshmen could distort the focus of new faculty
members' scholarship.
Hiring faculty specifically to teach CIV "would
be counterproductive at the junior faculty level.

where younger faculty should properly be focus
ing on development of their scholarship and
teaching careers in the learned disciplines them
selves," Wessells said yesterday.
Wessells also predicted qualified candidates
would be difficult to locate. "There are very few
Stanford-level people to be hired. [A department]
would have to spend an immense amount of time
searching, with a low probability of success," he
said.
He added that the problem of finding qualified
teachers to fill lecturer positions will increase in
the 1990s "due to the retirements of senior facul
ty."
English Prof. William Chace, sponsor of a coun
terproposal that, unlike the CUS plan, retains
the core list of readings, said yesterday he "as
sociates himself with the spirit of Wessells' let
ter."
