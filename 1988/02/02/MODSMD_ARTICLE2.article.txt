# Dean fears faculty hiring may suffer
## 
### David Dirks 
Stanford's Dean of Humanities and Sciences
said yesterday it may be "counterproductive" to
attempt to hire faculty specifically to teach
courses that meet the proposed "Cultures, Ideas
and Values" requirement, should the plan pro
posed by the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies be approved by the Faculty Senate later
this month.
Although Norman Wessells refused to either
support or condemn the CUS plan because he is
an ex-officio member of the Faculty Senate, he
circulated a letter last week to members of the
senate in which he wrote that tailoring depart
ment faculty searches "to meet an ex
tradepartmental general studies requirement" for
freshmen could distort the focus of new faculty
members' scholarship.
Hiring faculty specifically to teach CIV "would
be counterproductive at the junior faculty level.

where younger faculty should properly be focus
ing on development of their scholarship and
teaching careers in the learned disciplines them
selves," Wessells said yesterday.
Wessells also predicted qualified candidates
would be difficult to locate. "There are very few
Stanford-level people to be hired. [A department]
would have to spend an immense amount of time
searching, with a low probability of success," he
said.
He added that the problem of finding qualified
teachers to fill lecturer positions will increase in
the 1990s "due to the retirements of senior facul
ty."
English Prof. William Chace, sponsor of a coun
terproposal that, unlike the CUS plan, retains
the core list of readings, said yesterday he "as
sociates himself with the spirit of Wessells' let
ter."
"[Wessells] has pointed at a real
problem" with the CUS plan,
Chace said.
Although Western Culture
Task Force Chair Craig Heller, a
biology professor, acknowledged
that Stanford generally does not
hire faculty to teach a specific
course, he said "the hiring of lec
turers is quite different" because
they are hired strictly on a part
time basis.
Wessells spoke out against
proposals to hire more "parafacul
ty" — lecturers as opposed to
tenured professors — to teach the

proposed freshman requirement.
Currently, about $500,000 of the
$700,000 of the Western Culture
Program's budget is spent paying
parafaculty positions.
Instead of allocating more
money to hire lecturers for the
proposed course, he said Stanford
"should recruit women and
minority group professorial fac
ulty with great determination and
vigor."
Wessells specifically attacked
section 4C of the CUS plan, which
states: "Minority faculty and fac
ulty with expertise in the study
of cultures outside the European
cluster of cultures shall be ac
tively encouraged to teach in
program tracks. The appointment
of lecturers/instructors with ex

pertise in fields that would
facilitate implementation of the
objectives above shall also be en
couraged."
Wessells said the section has
"got it sort of backwards. We nor
mally don't search that way, we
search for the best possible person
in one area." Wessells explained
that after hiring, the faculty mem
bers teach in their department or
in interdisciplinary programs for
a few years, before being encour
aged to teach the large freshman
courses.
If the CUS plan is adopted, he
said, the faculty should strive to
develop "a common intellectual
experience . . . including great
books, events, achievements and
social processes."

He warned that without a com
mon thread linking the different
tracks, there could be an "erosion
of confidence" in the requirement,
and possibly "its total demise."
"That would be a disastrous
step, one that would be detrimen
tal to our educational program,
to our freshman admissions, to
our position of national leadership
in curricular development and to
our relationship with many indi
viduals on whom we depend for
the support of our students and
our faculty alike," he said.
The Faculty Senate will debate
the Western Culture reform
proposals Thursday, but will not
vote on the matter for several
weeks.
