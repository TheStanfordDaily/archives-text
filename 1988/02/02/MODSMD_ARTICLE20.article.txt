## Fraternities add positive element to campus life 
### 
WE RARELY WRITE letters to
The Daily, but the condescend
ing and ill-informed Jan. 28
letter by Chris Balz merits a response.
Balz cites a "string" of four inci
dents which happened over a period of
approximately six years as "sufficient
evidence" that "the University should
force housed fraternities off campus."
He neglects to mention that three of
the incidents were perpetrated by
fraternities which are no longer
housed, or recognized by the Univer
sity or by the Interfraternity Council.
Assuming that the fourth incident
occurred in a fraternity which is still
housed, would the problems of a single
house be grounds to indict the entire
Stanford fraternity system? Through

malicious and blatant stereotyping such
as this, Balz is at least as prejudicial
as he accuses "fraternity boys" of
being.
These problems, to the extent that
they exist, are endemic to the campus
as whole, and the elimination of frater
nities would not end them; to suggest
that their presence on the Stanford
campus is a consequence of fraternity
life is symptomatic of an appallingly
narrow perspective.
For example, this year our fraternity
sponsored a campus-wide alcohol
awareness forum featuring such noted
speakers as University President
Donald Kennedy, English Prof. Ken
neth Fields and experts from outside
the Stanford community. Numerous

fraternities have been at the forefront
eliminating drunk driving, as evidenced
by the Sigma Chi-initiated STOP
program.
Beyond combating social problems
that fraternities are unjustifiably asso
ciated with, Stanford fraternities have
an exemplary record in other forms of
community service.
Fraternities have helped coach young
athletic teams and have run programs
for underprivileged children such as
the annual haunted house.
Finally, every Greek organization on
campus has at least one national
charity for which it implements service
projects throughout the year. Our
charity is the Muscular Dystrophy

Association for which we raised over
$5,000 Jan. 23 in our annual mud
volleyball tournament.
We have not presented this litany of
Greek service projects in an effort to
laud ourselves. Rather, we are attempt
ing to set the record straight on the
degree of civility and social conscious
ness within our homes.
We would like to issue a standing
invitation to all members of the Stan
ford community to visit our house at
any time to witness the reality of
fraternity life.
