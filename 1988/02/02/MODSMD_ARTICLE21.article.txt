# Objectivists don't address the issue
## 
### 
In a Jan. 29 Viewpoint in The Daily,
"Don't play games with Western Cul
ture," the Stanford Objectivists misrep
resented the concerns of the students
and faculty involved in the Area One
debate.
According to the Objectivists, who
base their philosophy on the writings
of Ayn Rand, those advocating changes
in the Western Culture program wish
to introduce new writings solely be
cause they are by women or
minorities.
The Objectivists argue without
evidence that "ideas are the product of
individual minds," and that "culture is
created by individuals who think in
dependently."
Thus, they say the gender and eth
nic origin of the thinker is irrelevant.
However, they contradict themselves
later, stating that philosophical ideas
are often acquired from schools and

the media. Thus, they concede that
views are shaped by culture.
In fact, the Objectivists eloquently
and inadvertently present the real
reason that the underrepresentation of
women and minorities is a concern.
Culture profoundly influences an in
dividual's ideas. The lack of women
and minorities in the Western Culture
curricula denies Stanford students the
opportunity to evaluate the wealth of
ideas originating outside of male
European society.
The great thinkers whose writings
are currently on the reading list did
not originate their ideas in a vacuum.
For example, Freud developed his
theories after observing Victorian
culture. Many anthropologists, aware
of cultural relativism, now doubt
whether these theories are universally
applicable.
The Stanford Objectivists claim that
the philosophical ideas disseminated by
universities "ultimately determine
eveiy aspect ... of the life of a nation,
including its survival." If this is true,
it is imperative that Stanford present a

complete range of ideas, the valuable
products of a World Culture require
ment.
