# Don't resist change to Western Culture
## 
### 
I am writing in partial response to
Don Hersey's Jan. 27 "Viewpoint."
Hersey began his piece on the Western
Culture debate as though it were an
academic, intellectual argument and
ended by revealing that much of his
opinion is based on personal taste.
It seems to me that much of the
resistance to change (or fundamental
change in the core list) has come from
obstinate personal tastes, whether or
not any convincing proof has been
offeisd that cultural literacy consists of
a core list of bonks by European, elitist
men.
If Stanford is truly committed to

realistically presenting the fabric of
America's heritage, it would not insist
that there is not enough time to read
about the important contributions of
women and non-Europeans, as Hersey
asserts. If this were true, any
reputable and respectable institution
would re-evaluate the integrity of a
year-long "Western Culture" course
and either adopt the proposed "Cul
tures, Ideas and Values" course or
rename Western Culture for what it
truly is: "European Elitists 101, 102
and 103."
Tta people working on reforming
Western Culture are not attempting to
desecrate the origins of American
culture, but instead arc trying to
introduce and emphasize all that the
course has harmfully disregarded. The
proposed changes will not deprive
Western Culture of anything by includ
ing what should already have existed
in the first place, but will rejuvenate
Western Culture with validity and true
representation.
