## Contra aid undermines peace plan 
### 
ON FEB. 3 AND 4, Congress will
have the choice of either
reaffirming or destroying a gragile
hope for peace in Central America. If
Congress votes to approve President
Reagan's request for new aid to the
contras, it will be voting to continue a
policy which has done nothing but
increase militarization violence and
suffering in all of Central America.
We at Stanford are not dissociated from
these events, as we may sometimes feel.
Not only has the Hoover Institution been
instrumental in formulating the policies
of the Reagan administration, but the
University has contributed one of the
highest-level guardians of the Contra
policy, Stanford Business Prof, and Sec
retary of State George Shultz.
The Stanford Central American Action
Network represents a part of the Stan
ford community that opposes the contin
ued United States funding of the Contras.
We are a group of informed Stanford
students, faculty, staff and alumni who
view the policy as inherently flawed and
who are particularly disturbed by a new
request for aid at this critical time.
The Reagan administration's request
for additional Contra aid at this time,
when there exists the first (and possibly
last) genuine chance for peace, betrays
a blatant disrespect for the efforts of the
Central American presidents who are
struggling to forge a solution to the con
flict, and a clear lack of commitment to
peace in the region.
Reagan has undermined the peace
process from the beginning by pressuring
the Central American presidents to back
away from it and by rejecting their pleas
to halt aid to the Contras.
The president has also displayed an
amazing selectivity of vision. He has ig
nored or derisively dismissed important

movements toward greater openness in
Nicaragua (such as the lifting of restric
tions on the media and the release of
large numbers of political prisoners) and
has focused solely on the shortcomings.
The Contra war has been a bad policy
from the outset. It is clear that the Con
tras have not won the hearts and minds
of the Nicaraguan people. The Contra
tactics of terror (the murdering of farm
ers, teachers, health workers, mothers
and children; the kidnappings; and the
rape and torture of their victims) can
only elicit hatred for the Contras and for
the U.S. government which sponsors
them.
The lack of popular support for the
Contras is clearly evident in that they
control no territory in Nicaragua, must
use kidnapping as a means of "recruiting"
members, and are completely dependent
on United States support.
For seven years, the Reagan adminis
tration has claimed that it is funding the
Contras as a means of pressuring the
Sandanistas into initiating democratic
reforms. Yet that strategy has yielded
only increased restriction on internal op
position, increased militarization and
greater Soviet support.
The diplomatic process initiated by
President Arias is a new approach, and
now we are seeing movement toward
greater democratic freedoms in
Nicaragua. President Arias has explicitly
requested that no new assistance, includ
ing so-called humanitarian assistance, be
given to the Contras at this time. Who
are we, with the blood of seven years of
violence on our hands, to disregard that
request? j
If Reagan can sit down to dinner in
Washington with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, why can't he see that in the
long run the United States can profit by

helping Nicaraguans to help themselves
recover from their terrible recent political
history?
Instead of shipping Contras more guns
and ammunition, mining Nicaraguan
harbors and ignoring the jurisdiction of
the International Court of Justice on
these matters, why not fully explore the
diplomatic and political options? Why not
listen to a Nobel Peace Prize laureate,
President Oscar Arias, as he pleads over
and over that the United States discon
tinue Contra aid?
Why not instead fund United States
efforts to help Nicaragua build hospitals
to care for Contra war casualties, to build
public works projects such as safe drink
ing water plants, and to help improve
agricultural production?
Would these actions not provide a far
better example of what democracy can
achieve than the brutal violence of the
Contras, the CIA-sponsored assassination
manuals, the lies revealed during the
Iran-Contra hearings and, now, the con
tempt shown for attempts to achieve a
diplomatic solution to the conflict?
George Shultz and his political allies
at the Hoover Institution are pursuing
a dangerously wrong-headed policy, one
that could eventually jeapordize Stan
ford's reputation as a center for the un
biased pursuit of knowledge and learning.
We applaud those individuals associ
ated with Stanford who have voiced
criticism of the present Contra policy and
who have offered positive alternatives to
an escalating war in Nicaragua and
Central America.

agricultural production?
Would these actions not provide a far
better example of what democracy can
achieve than the brutal violence of the
Contras, the CIA-sponsored assassination
manuals, the lies revealed during the
Iran-Contra hearings and, now, the con

diplomatic solution to the conflict?
George Shultz and his political allies
at the Hoover Institution are pursuing
a dangerously wrong-headed policy, one
that could eventually jeapordize Stan

We applaud those individuals associ

criticism of the present Contra policy and
who have offered positive alternatives to
an escalating war in Nicaragua and
Central America.

ON FEB. 3 AND 4, Congress will
have the choice of either
reaffirming or destroying a gragile
hope for peace in Central America. If
Congress votes to approve President
Reagan's request for new aid to the
contras, it will be voting to continue a
policy which has done nothing but
increase militarization violence and
suffering in all of Central America.
We at Stanford are not dissociated from
these events, as we may sometimes feel.
Not only has the Hoover Institution been
instrumental in formulating the policies
of the Reagan administration, but the
University has contributed one of the
highest-level guardians of the Contra
policy, Stanford Business Prof, and Sec
retary of State George Shultz.
The Stanford Central American Action
Network represents a part of the Stan
ford community that opposes the contin
ued United States funding of the Contras.
We are a group of informed Stanford
students, faculty, staff and alumni who
view the policy as inherently flawed and
who are particularly disturbed by a new
request for aid at this critical time.
The Reagan administration's request
for additional Contra aid at this time,
when there exists the first (and possibly
last) genuine chance for peace, betrays
a blatant disrespect for the efforts of the
Central American presidents who are
struggling to forge a solution to the con
flict, and a clear lack of commitment to
peace in the region.
Reagan has undermined the peace
process from the beginning by pressuring
the Central American presidents to back
away from it and by rejecting their pleas
to halt aid to the Contras.
The president has also displayed an
amazing selectivity of vision. He has ig
nored or derisively dismissed important

movements toward greater openness in
Nicaragua (such as the lifting of restric
tions on the media and the release of
large numbers of political prisoners) and
has focused solely on the shortcomings.
The Contra war has been a bad policy
from the outset. It is clear that the Con
tras have not won the hearts and minds
of the Nicaraguan people. The Contra
tactics of terror (the murdering of farm
ers, teachers, health workers, mothers
and children; the kidnappings; and the
rape and torture of their victims) can
only elicit hatred for the Contras and for
the U.S. government which sponsors
them.
The lack of popular support for the
Contras is clearly evident in that they
control no territory in Nicaragua, must
use kidnapping as a means of "recruiting"
members, and are completely dependent
on United States support.
For seven years, the Reagan adminis
tration has claimed that it is funding the
Contras as a means of pressuring the
Sandanistas into initiating democratic
reforms. Yet that strategy has yielded
only increased restriction on internal op
position, increased militarization and
greater Soviet support.
The diplomatic process initiated by
President Arias is a new approach, and
now we are seeing movement toward
greater democratic freedoms in
Nicaragua. President Arias has explicitly
requested that no new assistance, includ
ing so-called humanitarian assistance, be
given to the Contras at this time. Who
are we, with the blood of seven years of
violence on our hands, to disregard that
request? j
If Reagan can sit down to dinner in
Washington with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, why can't he see that in the
long run the United States can profit by

helping Nicaraguans to help themselves
recover from their terrible recent political
history?
Instead of shipping Contras more guns
and ammunition, mining Nicaraguan
harbors and ignoring the jurisdiction of
the International Court of Justice on
these matters, why not fully explore the
diplomatic and political options? Why not
listen to a Nobel Peace Prize laureate,
President Oscar Arias, as he pleads over
and over that the United States discon
tinue Contra aid?
Why not instead fund United States
efforts to help Nicaragua build hospitals
to care for Contra war casualties, to build
public works projects such as safe drink
ing water plants, and to help improve
agricultural production?
Would these actions not provide a far
better example of what democracy can
achieve than the brutal violence of the
Contras, the CIA-sponsored assassination
manuals, the lies revealed during the
Iran-Contra hearings and, now, the con
tempt shown for attempts to achieve a
diplomatic solution to the conflict?
