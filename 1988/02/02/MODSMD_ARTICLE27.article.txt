## Bug addresses noisy vapor issue 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
The Bug is back for Volume
193 of The Daily. Thanks to
everyone who sent in their ques
tions last volume; I've saved many
of them to answer in the upcom
ing weeks. Frankly, though, I
need more good questions. You
know the kind I like: the strange,
the offensive, the perverted, the
puzzling. Send 'em to me at Bug
Me, Stanford Daily, Storke Build
ing, Stanford, CA, 94305. Or for
those of you forever sentenced to
LOTS, send 'em to Bug-Me (not
B.Bug-Me) at Othello, Lear, Ham
let or Macbeth (the tragedies) on
LOTS.

And folks, let's have no more
questions about the band, OK? I
know we're all big fans of
LSJUMB, but you know, if I get
one more question about the
origin of (pick one): "All Right
Now," "White Punks on Dope,"
the Tree, the Dollies, the swishing
noise during the national anthem,
the tuba color scheme, Tammy
the piccolo player or the Band
Shak, frankly, I'll go nuts.
Thanks.
Dear Bug Me,
Concerning your reply to the in
quiry about student #1234567, all
the original professors have not
"passed on to the great office
hours in the sky." Prof. Emeritus
Wayne Vucinich, for one, is alive
and well and the current chair of
History 199, "The Origins of
Modern Society."
Second, you implied that
sailing is not taught during win
ter quarter. If you'd bother to
check your handy-dandy time
schedule you'd see that contrary
to popular belief, sailing is offered
winter quarter at Redwood City
— the lake is obviously a bit dry.
— An Obnoxious Reader
This obviously disturbed you a
lot more than it did Prof.
Vucinich. As soon as I received
your letter and a number of angry
phone calls from the Professor

Wayne S. Vucinich Fan Club, I
telephoned Prof. Vucinich to de
termine whether, to paraphrase
Mark Twain, rumors of his death
were greatly exaggerated.
Vucinich was interested to learn
that he had been declared dead,
and announced, much to my dis
may, that he hadn't read Bug Me
that morning.
"Then you're not dead," I of
fered cautiously.
"Not yet," he said. "I'm well
and feel afloat."
So for those of you who were
greatly disturbed by last week's
column, you can rest comfortably
knowing that Prof. Vucinich is
not only alive and well, but he is
feeling afloat too.
Speaking of feeling afloat (gotta
love this transition), if you would
check your time schedule you'd
notice that the sailing offered win
ter quarter is not the same sailing
that half the student body takes
spring quarter, but rather varsity
sailing, open only to those hearty
souls on the varsity sailing team.
However, on the sample study list
on the back of the time schedule,
sailing is listed as a club sport.
The plot thickens!
It doesn't really matter, how
ever, because the real accusation
you make is that I have implied
that sailing is not offered winter
quarter. If you would go back and
read last week's column, you'll
see that nowhere is it implied that
sailing is not offered winter quar
ter. I only pointed out that the
sample study list is for summer
quarter.
I'll concede that you were right
about Prof. Vucinich, but I think
you have to admit that I was right
about sailing. This leaves us
pretty much even, but I have
cuter girls on my hall than you
do, so I'd say I win.
Moral of the story: Do your re
search and don't be obnoxious.
Only those who are always right
can afford to be obnoxious.
Dear Bug,
During finals week, I had just
gotten all of the people who were
already done to stop partying long
enough for me to finish my
studies. So I proceeded quietly to
my room, opened the window for
a cool breeze, and "Whoooshhh!"
All I could hear in my room was
the loud belching of what is prob
ably Stanford's "Cardinal
Cogeneration Plant." Has anyone
ever tried to study with the sound
of steam pouring into the atmos
phere in the background 1 ? It isn't
easy. And in the middle of finals,
no less.
What is so important that the
University needs to release steam

all night during finals week. What
is cogeneration? And, who do you
call to tell it to shut up?!?
— Steaming While I Study
Rumors to the effect that the
cogeneration plant is God's way
of punishing people for the luxury
of living in Governor's Corner are
greatly exaggerated. For those
who are not residents of that side
of campus, allow me to describe
just how loud the cogeneration
plant was during finals week:
Imagine that you are at San
Francisco International Airport,
standing at the gate, waiting for
your sister to arrive on a DC-10.
Now imagine sticking your head
into the engine of the DC-10. That
is approximately how loud the
plant was during finals week.

The Cardinal Cogeneration
Plant (which to me sounds like a
place where they clone little red
birds) is not, as you might
suspect, a Faculty Senate plot to
reduce grade inflation by interfer
ing with Dead Week study hours,
but rather an ingenius power
producing system designed very
carefully to resemble a nuclear
reactor.
Cogeneration is a process for
producing energy which is much
more efficient than most other
methods, because they use the
same heat source to generate both
electrical and thermal energy.
Here's more or less how it works:
Natural gas is burned and then
fed through a boiler to create
steam. The steam is then fed
through a turbine (similar to the
turbines on a jet engine) to
produce electricity, while the

excess steam is used to heat the
campus. This process of making
heat and electricity from gas is
known as cogeneration.
Stanford buys some of the
electricity to use on campus, as
well as using the steam for
heating. But this leaves lots of
excess electricity, so Cardinal
Cogeneration sells it to Pacific
Gas & Electric.
The final score is that Stanford
gets paid a percentage of the prof
its from the sale of electricity to
PG & E; Stanford also gets paid
for the lease on the land that the
cogeneration plant uses. We end
up paying only for the utilities
we use from the plant, the end
result being that Stanford gets
free electricity, free heating and
a profit on top of that. The

cogeneration plant is completely
owned by an outside company.
The plant is generating some
power now, although it won't be
completely finished for a couple
of months. During finals week
they were testing it out, but
having some problems with the
steam turbines. They couldn't
very well feed the steam through
the turbines while they were
fixing them, so they had to release
it into the air. It's just steam, so
it doesn't pose any kind of envi
ronmental threat, but it sure is
loud.
When the plant is finished and
fully operational, be assured that
it won't make any annoying
noises, but rather will sit there
silently creating power and
warmth for the Stanford campus.
Not to mention cloning little
red birds.
