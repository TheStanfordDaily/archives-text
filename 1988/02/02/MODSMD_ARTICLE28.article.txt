# Teahouse steams

Serving up Chinese noodles,
green tea and five cent fortune
cookies, the student-run
Teahouse is fast becoming the
campus cure for late night
hunger pangs.
Open from nine until mid
night, Thursday through Sun
day evenings, the newly
remodeled Teahouse, located in
Wilbur Hall, serves an esti
mated 150 people per night.
Sophomore Victor Hwang,
supply manager for the restau
rant, said the Teahouse is "a
fun way" to share Asian cul
ture with the Stanford commu
nity.
"We get a variety of people
in [the restaurant] who are not
just Asian," said sophomore
Rob Chen, who serves as res
taurant treasurer.
"We get policemen in here
sometimes as well as this foot
ball player who always comes
in for take-out ramens
(Chinese noodles)," he said.
Colorful fans hang on the
walls, paper lanterns flutter
from the ceiling, and big, soft
pillows surround the tables —
the student managers are very
proud of the Teahouse's "new
look."
According to Hwang, the
Teahouse, before its redecora
tion, was "dark, dim and
greasy."

"We've done a hell of a lot
of work to make this place
nicer," he said.
The Teahouse specializes in
dim sum, heart-shaped ap
petizers filled with an assort
ment of vegetables and meat.
Chinese for "little hearts," dim
sum sells for 65 cents.
Founded by students 17
years ago, the Teahouse is a
non-profit organization. All
employees work on a volunteer
basis, and when the restaurant
does make a profit the money
is donated to the Asian Amer
ican Students Association and
other Asian campus organiza
tions.
One difficulty the Teahouse
faces at present is a lack of
students willing to work. "All
we need are some people to
volunteer to work two hours a
week," Hwang said.
Student managers said they
are busy at work planning a
larger menu with a greater va
riety of items. They hope to
set a precedent for future
managers, since none plan to
return to the job next year.
"The job is really tiring,"
Hwang said. "I think one year
is enough."
Freshman Rebecca King,
who sampled the Asian cuisine
one heavy-duty study night,
recommended the Teahouse as
"a great place for a study
break."

A far cry from frozen yogurt, this noodle dish prepared by
sophomore Carolyn Wei is a specialty for late night snackers
who venture to the Teahouse.
