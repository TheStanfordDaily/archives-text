# Cardinal carpet out for football recruits
## 
### 
Last week I presented an ab
breviated diary of a 48-hour
football recruiting weekend.
This week I'll give a few more
impressions culled from a very
interesting few days.
What amazed me most was
the near total access Stanford
Recruiting Coordinator Dick
James and the rest of the
coaching staff gave me
throughout the entire
weekend. Football coaches can

rival Ollie North and his
buddies for secrecy, devious
ness and general paranoia, and
it says a lot about the Stanford
staff that they were willing to
open up the entire process to
n reporter. Obviously, they feel
they have nothing to hide, and
in fact they encouraged me to
attend as many events as pos
sible.
That would never happen at
Oklahoma or Miami.
The only meetings I wasn't
allowed to sit in on were those
between Stanford Coach Jack
Elway and individual recruits.
There were only a few of these
Sunday afternoon, though, and
these meetings generally only
take place if Elway is unlikely
to visit an athlete in his home.
One would expect Elway and
the other coaches to give the
athletes the hard sell through
out their visits, but it doesn't
happen. The whole weekend is
very subdued. There isn't a
"rah-rah Stanford, we're the
best" routine. The coaches fade
into the background and let the
place sell itself. If any pitches
need to be made, that's done
later in the home when it
comes to crunch time.
Still, every school is selling
something, and the coaches try

to impress the recruits with
the integration of athletics and
academics in Stanford's close
knit community. A Stanford
recruiting weekend is fast
paced, but it's centered around
the Farm. Other schools go for
flashier events.
While Stanford recruits are
dining at the Faculty Club, Cal
ifornia is taking its recruits for
a dinner cruise on the Bay.
Colorado and Utah take
recruits skiing, while Arizona
takes them horseback riding
and UCLA shows off its
sorority system.
Of course all these activities
can be pretty enjoyable and
some schools become known as
"visit schools." These are
schools like Nevada-Las Vegas
and Arizona State that an ath
lete may not want to attend
but that can still provide 48
hours of all-expenses-paid fun.
A school visit can be an eye
opening experience for an ath
lete. One told of a visit to Cal
ifornia where the assistant
coach couldn't even identify
the school's buildings. When
asked what his athletes' mty'ors
were, the coach drew a blank.
Schools are allowed to give
each athlete up to $50 each
way for transportation between
the home and airport, and one
recruit told how he received
the whole sum from a large
midwestern school even though
he lived within a few miles of
the airport.
Recruits are, therefore,
learning about the good and
bad aspects of a school
throughout a visit.
One aspect of Stanford that's
played down is the football
facilities. Compared to those of
many of the other schools these
athletes visit, Stanford's foot
ball facilities aren't too impres
sive. The locker room is small
and located hundreds of yards
from the practice fields and
stadium, and the weight room
is in a barn.
Therefore, facilities are given


Brendan
Healey
the soft sell, and if anything is
emphasized along those lines, it's
the grass stadium and practice
fields and nice weather.
Another mqjor aspect of recruit
ing, one that was featured in
Sports Illustrated last fall, is the
role of student hostesses. Yes,
Stanford does have student hos
tesses, but they aren't assigned
to specific players and they are
only on hand for a few events.
There are also no follow-up
"hope-to-see-you-on-campus
next-year-big-fella" letters or
calls. Hostesses at Stanford
should not be confused with
Florida's "Gator Getters" or
TCU's "Horned Frog Associates."
They're much more low-key.
The question that finally begs
itself is why Stanford rolls out
the red carpet for football
recruits. After all, Stanford is
primarily an academic institution,
and it seems somewhat odd to
romance 17-year-old football
players instead of math whizzes
or young historians. A lot of time
and effort goes into the recruiting
process.
This effort comes not only on
the part of the football staff, but
also on the part of the admissions
people and faculty. Since football
players can sign letters of intent
on Feb. 10, they need to know at
that time if they have been ac
cepted. This means the admis
sions staff has to have reached a
decision on football players
roughly two months ahead of the
time it decides on everyone else.
It seems like a lot of privileges,
but that's how the recruiting
game is played, and every school
does it. Even the Ivies, although
they technically can't offer athle
tic scholarships, can and do
recruit heavily. It's the nature of
the beast.

in fact they encouraged me to
attend as many events as pos
sible.
That would never happen at
Oklahoma or Miami.
The only meetings I wasn't
allowed to sit in on were those
between Stanford Coach Jack
Elway and individual recruits.
There were only a few of these
Sunday afternoon, though, and
these meetings generally only
take place if Elway is unlikely
to visit an athlete in his home.
One would expect Elway and
the other coaches to give the
athletes the hard sell through
out their visits, but it doesn't
happen. The whole weekend is
very subdued. There isn't a
"rah-rah Stanford, we're the
best" routine. The coaches fade
into the background and let the
place sell itself. If any pitches
need to be made, that's done
later in the home when it
comes to crunch time.
Still, every school is selling
something, and the coaches try

to impress the recruits with
the integration of athletics and
academics in Stanford's close
knit community. A Stanford
recruiting weekend is fast
paced, but it's centered around
the Farm. Other schools go for
flashier events.
While Stanford recruits are
dining at the Faculty Club, Cal
ifornia is taking its recruits for
a dinner cruise on the Bay.
Colorado and Utah take
recruits skiing, while Arizona
takes them horseback riding
and UCLA shows off its
sorority system.
Of course all these activities
can be pretty enjoyable and
some schools become known as
"visit schools." These are
schools like Nevada-Las Vegas
and Arizona State that an ath
lete may not want to attend
but that can still provide 48
hours of all-expenses-paid fun.
A school visit can be an eye
opening experience for an ath
lete. One told of a visit to Cal
ifornia where the assistant
coach couldn't even identify
the school's buildings. When
asked what his athletes' mty'ors
were, the coach drew a blank.
Schools are allowed to give
each athlete up to $50 each
way for transportation between
the home and airport, and one
recruit told how he received
the whole sum from a large
midwestern school even though
he lived within a few miles of
the airport.
Recruits are, therefore,
learning about the good and
bad aspects of a school
throughout a visit.
One aspect of Stanford that's
played down is the football
facilities. Compared to those of
many of the other schools these
athletes visit, Stanford's foot
ball facilities aren't too impres
sive. The locker room is small
and located hundreds of yards
from the practice fields and
stadium, and the weight room
is in a barn.
Therefore, facilities are given


Brendan
Healey
the soft sell, and if anything is
emphasized along those lines, it's
the grass stadium and practice
fields and nice weather.
Another mqjor aspect of recruit
ing, one that was featured in
Sports Illustrated last fall, is the
role of student hostesses. Yes,
Stanford does have student hos
tesses, but they aren't assigned
to specific players and they are
only on hand for a few events.
There are also no follow-up
"hope-to-see-you-on-campus
next-year-big-fella" letters or
calls. Hostesses at Stanford
should not be confused with
Florida's "Gator Getters" or
TCU's "Horned Frog Associates."
They're much more low-key.
The question that finally begs
itself is why Stanford rolls out
the red carpet for football
recruits. After all, Stanford is
primarily an academic institution,
and it seems somewhat odd to
romance 17-year-old football
players instead of math whizzes
or young historians. A lot of time
and effort goes into the recruiting
process.
This effort comes not only on
the part of the football staff, but
also on the part of the admissions
people and faculty. Since football
players can sign letters of intent
on Feb. 10, they need to know at
that time if they have been ac
cepted. This means the admis
sions staff has to have reached a
decision on football players
roughly two months ahead of the
time it decides on everyone else.
It seems like a lot of privileges,
but that's how the recruiting
game is played, and every school
does it. Even the Ivies, although
they technically can't offer athle
tic scholarships, can and do
recruit heavily. It's the nature of
the beast.
Last week I presented an ab
breviated diary of a 48-hour
football recruiting weekend.
This week I'll give a few more
impressions culled from a very
interesting few days.
What amazed me most was
the near total access Stanford
Recruiting Coordinator Dick
James and the rest of the
coaching staff gave me
throughout the entire
weekend. Football coaches can

rival Ollie North and his
buddies for secrecy, devious
ness and general paranoia, and
it says a lot about the Stanford
staff that they were willing to
open up the entire process to
n reporter. Obviously, they feel
they have nothing to hide, and
in fact they encouraged me to
attend as many events as pos
