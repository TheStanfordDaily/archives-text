In what on paper
figures to be a
whitewash, even
without the ser
vices of Stanford
senior Patrick
McEnroe, fresh-

man David Wheaton and sopho
more Barry Richards, the Cardi
nal men's tennis team travels to
San Jose today to face the out
gunned Spartans at 1:30 p.m.
Stanford, which shares the No.
1 ranking with Georgia and comes
off two solid road wins in Atlanta
over No. 10 Tennesse and Georgia
Tech Jan. 23-24, will field a
diluted, yet deceiving, lineup
against the Spartans in prepara
tion for the Ail-American Indoor
tournament this weekend.
"They (San Jose State) are not
a great team, but they are a solid
team," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "They have always
given us trouble down there. We
are looking to get a couple guys
who didn't play in Atlanta into

the lineup."
McEnroe and Richards are rest
ing, and Wheaton, with a
lacerated left wrist, is still not
ready to compete. To compensate,
Gould has plucked three reserves

Tm ready to go and
see if I can do it.
Since we have such
a good team this
year, I want to be a
big winnning factor
instead of an also

from his eucalyptus grove of tal
ent, and the Cardinal shouldn't
miss a beat.
Sophomore Eric Peus, a regular
with sophomore Jeff Cathrall at
No. 2 doubles, and junior Curtis
Dunn move into the lineup for
their first singles action of the

season. Freshman Dan Turbow
enters the doubles bracket for the
first time this year with singles
starter Glenn Solomon.
"We are just excited to play
them," San Jose State Coach John
Hubbell said. "Our players will
be sky-high. We have less depth
after our No. 1 player, but I think
we can play them tough in a
couple positions."
In the feature match of the day,
sophomore Jeff Tarango takes on
Spartan Malcom Allen at the No.
1 position. Last year, they split
two matches, with Tarango
edging Allen 7-5, 2-6, 7-6 at San
Jose State and Allen thumping
Tarango 6-2, 6-3 at Stanford's
Varsity Courts. Tarango looks to
rebound from two early season
drubbings by Tennesse's Shelby
Cannon (6-1, 6-1) and Georgia
Tech's Kenny Thorne (6-1, 6-4).
Allen, a junior, has played at
the No. 1 singles slot at San Jose
State for the past two years. He
was 21-9 last season and can play
