# Fencers dominate S.F. State
## 
### David Earnest Staff writer 
Stanford's men's and women's fenc
ing teams both looked impressive
against San Francisco State in this
Saturday's action at Roble Gym. The
men's team dominated all three
events, giving up only three bouts to
win the meet 25-3, while the women's

team was equally impressive, winning 15-1.
Stanford Men's Coach Zoran Tulum was pleased
with his team's performance, citing a lack of ex
perience among most of the fencers. "Most of our
fencers come from fencing schools and have very
little experience in meets," he said. "All our guys
got a chance to fence today. They were all very
serious, and I couldn't ask for more."
San Franciso State Coach Joe Manzano was also
very impressed with Stanford's team. "They are
very tough and will only get better," he said.
Leading the men's team in the foil event was
sophomore Duncan Bell, winning all three of his
bouts while being touched only twice. Junior Steph
en Schmidt dominated the epee event by winning
his three bouts. Team captain Dave Russ won all
three of his bouts in the sabre event.
The women's team also dominated its bouts.
Junior Juliet Johnson and senior Tracy Schmidt
turned in impressive performances as the women
stifled their opponents while dropping only a single

bout.
"Everyone fenced well," Schmidt said. "Today
there was not as much pressure on us, and we were
able to think about how we were fencing. I think
we all had good form and style. It was good, clean
fencing."
San Francisco State had a disadvantage entering
Saturday's action. Manzano noted that two of his
fencers who were responsible for the team's equip
ment did not show up for the meet. Because of a
shortage of fencers, the women's team had to forfeit
four bouts to Stanford. In spite of their problems,
San Francisco State fencers Julius Cabral and Mark
Burlingame performed well, often challenging their
Stanford counterparts.
Coach Tulum had praise for Manzano and San
Francisco State's team. "Their foil team is .very
good. Their program operates without funding from
the university, and they still produce good fencers."
Tulum was also very optomistic about his team's
future. "I'm very pleased with our fencing so far
this year, considering our inexperience," he said.
"We only need a few more years before we can
compete on a national level." He also said that the
team should perform well in this year's regional
championships, to be held in March.
The teams travel this Saturday to Santa Cruz to
face a talented Banana Slug team. The following
Saturday the teams return to Roble Gym to fence
against San Jose State. The competition will begin
at 1:00 p.m.
