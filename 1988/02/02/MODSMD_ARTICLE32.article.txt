## Baseball evens the score Santa Clara downed 3-2 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The bad news
about the Stanford
baseball team is
that it has
managed to get
only three hits in
each of its first two

games this season. In fact, the
Cardinal batters probably
couldn't hit themselves in the face
with a glass of water right now.
The good news is that it's only
a matter of time until the hit
parade gets underway, and in the
meantime, the team is doing
everything else — i.e., pitching
and playing defense — quite well.
Well enough, in fact, to over
come a woeful offensive effort and
scratch out a 3-2 victory over
Santa Clara yesterday at Sunken
Diamond. The game was the com
pletion of a game that began last
Friday but was suspended because
of rain in the bottom of the third
inning.
The win evens the defending
national champion Cardinal's
season record at 1-1.
"We'll take the first win any
way we can get it," senior Doug
Robbins said. "After yesterday, we
just needed to get going in the
right direction."
"Yesterday" was Sunday, when
the Cardinal dropped its season
opener to the Broncos, 3-2. The
Santa Clara players made no
bones about whooping it up after
that game. It was an unseemly
display.
"Yeah, they kind of had a little
celebration," Robbins said. "Kind
of like we did after we won the
World Series.
"That sticks in your mind. . . .
It fired us up a little. When you
lose, you don't like to have it
rubbed in your face."
The Cardinal didn't exactly
come out with a vengeance yes
terday, but the team aid cling
tenaciously to the lead it had built
up in the first three innings of
the game Friday.
Action resumed yesterday in
the bottom of the third, with
Stanford leading 2-0, but Santa
Clara struck quickly against Car
dinal starter Lee Plemel. Jeff

Dißono led off the fourth with a
single to left, then scored on Troy
Buckley's double into the left
center gap, making the score 2-1.
Plemel escaped the jam without
further damage, and retired the
side in the fifth and sixth innings.
' My arm felt good, but my lo
cation was really bad," Plemel
said. "I kind of settled down later,
started to think about things . ..
I was able to spot the ball better."
But Plemel hung an inside
curve to Buckley leading off the
seventh, and Buckley again ripped
it, this time off the 335 sign in
the left-field corner for a double.
Plemel again escaped unscathed,
but he wasn't as fortunate in the
eighth.
With one out, Ed Giovanola
started things with a bunt single,
then went all the way around to
third on a wild pitch. Jeff Healey
fisted a 3-2 pitch into right to
score Giovanola and tie the game.
Stanford came to bat in the
eighth with just five hits in the
first 16 innings of the season.
Robbins led off the inning with a
bloop into left field that fell just
in front of a diving Vince Machi
for a double. "I didn't think it
was going to fall," Robbins said.
"But they were playing a no
doubles defense, with [the outfiel
dersl back by the fence to keep
the ball from going in the gap.
That's why it fell in."
That was just the break the
struggling Cardinal offense
needed. Robbins went to third on
a nice sacrifice bunt down the
first-base line by Jeff Saenger,
then scored on Frank Carey's
deep fly to right field to put Stan
ford up 3-2.
Machi led off the ninth with a
line single to center. Victor Cole,
who pitched the Broncos to vic
tory on Sunday, was brought on
as a pinch-runner, but was
promptly gunned down at second
on a botched hit-and-run that ef
fectively snuffed the rally. Plemel
then struck out Andy Solomon
and Bruce Powers to ice the win.
The performance was vintage
Plemel: nine innings, nine hits,
one walk and five strikeouts.
"Lee's real tough to beat if you
get him a lead," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "They got

a bunch of hits off him, but he
didn't walk anybody before they
had someone on."
Plemel's outing comes on the
heels of fine performances by
freshman Mike Mussina and
junior Steve Chitren on Sunday.
In the two games combined, Stan
ford's pitchers have walked only
three batters and allowed five
earned runs. The Stanford
defense, meanwhile, has been
error-free.
"We're really struggling with
the bat," Marquess said, "but
we've had good pitching and good
defense. ... To even win a game
where you get three hits — that's
pretty impressive in itself."
Still, the lack of offense is
noticeable. "Six hits in 18 innings

— that's not indicative of what
this team's capable of doing,"
Robbins said. "The backbone of
this team is going to be putting
runs on the board and pitching.
If we only score two or three runs
a game, we're not going to be
nearly as successful as we want
to be."
Marquess, however, isn't overly
concerned about the slow start.
"I think we will hit," he said.
"For whatever reason, we've
never hit extremely well early in
the season, so that's not an un
usual pattern."
The Cardinal will try to fire up
its offense today as it hosts UC-
Davis at 2 p.m. at Sunken Dia
mond.
