Scores soared
and tempers
flared yesterday
at the Yamaha
USC Invitational
at the Industry
Hills Resort Golf

Course in Los Angeles, but

Stanford's Jodi Figley weath
ered the storm in grand fashion,
posting a sizzling 75 to tie for
second after the first of three
days of play. She and Pearl Sinn
of ASU are two shots behind
Michiko Hattori of Texas.
"I'd love to have another
round like today," an ecstatic
Figley said.
Stanford carded a team total

of 330, good for seventh place,
20 strokes behind early leader
Arizona State. Tulsa is second
at 314, with San Jose State an
other two strokes back. Texas
fired a 323 to finish fourth,
while New Mexico and U.S. In
ternational are tied for fifth at
326.
The Cardinal leads a tightly
packed remainder of the top ten.
Two strokes back of Stanford
are USC and New Mexico State.
Southern Methodist is 10th at
333.
The par-71, 6,085-yard course
"is very difficult — almost un
fair," said sophomore Stephanie
Parel, whose 88 was less than
a stroke off the day's average
score.
"There were a lot of high
scores," added freshman Kristin
Ryan, who managed an 85. "I
played all right except for a
couple of holes." Those two
holes were an quintuple bogey
and a triple bogey.
The main reason for the high
scores was the difficulty of the
course, according to senior Kay
Cornelius. "It's a tricky course,"
she said. "It takes constant
mental awareness."
"You can't get away with
anything," freshman Jodi Figley
said, regarding the course's
relentlessness. "You have to
play one shot at a time and not
think about what you've already
done or what you need to do on
the next hole."
Behind Figley and Sinn in the
individual battle are Maggie
Kelt of Tulsa, Susan Shapcott
of USIU, and Eve Biron of
Arizona State — all tied for
fourth at 76. Pam Wright of
ASU, Pat Hurst of San Jose
State, Michelle Wooding of New
Mexico State and Allison Shap
cott of USIU finished out the
top 10 at 77.
One reason for the unusually
high scores is the condition of
the course. The Bermuda grass
used gets especially hard in the
winter, and shots often take un
expected kicks. "Drives are
definitely rolling further, but if
you were off the mark, even a
little, it only got worse," Cor
nelius said.
