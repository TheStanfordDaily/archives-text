# Wrestlers score at All-Cal Tourney
## 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
Looking to
rebound from a
loss to Fullerton
State on Friday
night, the Stan
ford wrestling
team ventured to

San Francisco State University
on Saturday to take part in the
All-Cal Invitational tournament.
Six of the Cardinal's nine
wrestlers finished in the top four
places of their weight brackets.
Stanford came in fourth as a
team, just three-quarters of a
point behind Fullerton in the
final standings, and had three
grapplers competing in the final
round of the tournament.
"I feel pretty good about the
finish," Stanford Coach Chris
Horpel said. "I think we're just
as good as Fullerton, and our
final standings proved that."
Freshman Loren Vigil was
first out for Stanford. The 126-
pound freshman lost to a
wrestler from Humboldt State
in the first round of the tourna
ment, but rallied to win three
straight matches and finish third
in the consolation finals. He
avenged the opening loss to
Humboldt by defeating the same
wrestler in the final round and
claiming the third-placc prize.
"It took that first loss to really
get him mad," said Horpel. "The
last match was really close again,
but Loren moved when he had
to."
At 134 pounds, sophomore
Josh Lisle went 1-2 on the day
to garner a fourth-place finish.

against Fullerton State's Deets

Winslow, who pinned Lisle on
Friday night, Lisle showed im
provement by making the bout
a close match. Demoted to the
consolation bracket, Lisle beat
San Francisco State's wrestler
to avenge an early season loss,
but was beaten again by Winslow
in the consolation finals to take
fourth.
James Dinette wrestled for
Stanford at 142 pounds, and also
went 1-2 on the day, but didn't
finish in the tournament's top
four places. Dinette lost a close
bout to Fresno State 8-5, beat
San Francisco's wrestler, and
lost to Fullerton's grappler 5-0
before being eliminated from the
competition.
At 150 pounds, sophomore
Geoff Baum had a tough opening
round as he faced the eventual
meet champion from Fresno
State. After dropping that bout,
Baum took on San Francisco
State's wrestler only to lose
again, 7-4.
"He wrestled with all of the
heart you could ever want," Hor
pel said. "It just seemed like he
was too concerned with winning
or losing and didn't remember
to just go out there, relax and
wrestle."
Steve Yarbrough, at 158
pounds, ended the meet as
runner-up to a wrestler from
Fresno State whom he had
beaten earlier this year. On the
way to his second-place finish,
Yarbrough ran up a 2-1 record.
"That final match reminded
me of the Super Bowl," Horpel
commented. "Steve made some
great moves at the beginning,
then the Fresno State wrestler
just took control and ran up the
score."

Steve Buddie, at 167 pounds,
had a similar experience. After
beating Fullerton's Paul Hal
wejin 15-7 on Friday night,
Buddie lost to the same man in
the opening round of the tour
nament. He came back to win
two matches, then went into the
consolation finals to face Hal
wejin for the third time in 24
hours. This time Buddie came
out on top, winning 5-2 and
finishing in third place at the
competition.
Ron Perry ended his day with
a second place finish to his credit
at 177 pounds. After forcing
Fullerton's wrestler to call an
injury default after his ankle was
hurt, Perry went on to beat
Bakersfield's wreslter 7-4.

And the ankle? "I don't know.
I just grabbed it and it made
this loud pop," Perry said.
Perry faced Don Zeeman of UC
Davis in the finals of the tour
nament, but lost the match 3-2.
It was the fifth time the pair
have wrestled since Perry's ar
rival to The Farm last year, and
he currently leads the series, 3-2.
Stanford's only champion on
Saturday was 190-pound Terry
Mclntyre. The senior team cap
tain demolished Chico State's
wrestler in the opening round
by a technical fall, then defeated
Bakersfield's wrestler 7-3. In the
final round Mclntyre faced Jon
Mclntire of Humboldt State,
reenacting the finals of the Aggie
Invitational tournament of two

weeks ago when Mclntyre beat
Mclntire 6-1 to win that crown.
This time Mclntyre again won
the match, taking a 3-2 decision
to finish in first place on the day.
"Any one of five guys in my
bracket could have won it,"
Mclntyre said. "I guess I was
just a little better than them
that day."
Sophomore Trent Smith com
peted in the heavyweight divi
sion, finishing 0-2 on the day
after dropping matches to UC-
Davis and San Francisco State.
Stanford's wrestlers will have
some time to rest before they
return to the mat. Their next
competition will be in two weeks
when the team travels to Fresno
State to take on the Bulldogs.



Steve Buddie shows the style and strength that earned him third place this weekend at the All-Cal
Tournament. Buddie, wrestling at 167 pounds, is 8-0-1 on the season.
