# Blacks unite for Liberation Month
## 
### Grace Ho 
Concerned about class
stratification within the American
black community, several Stan
ford student organizations and
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center are organizing a
month-long series of programs be
ginning Friday entitled "Black
Liberation Month."
Keith Archuleta, assistant di
rector of the Row and director of
the Black Community Service
Center, said he hopes the pro
gramming will build a sense of
unity and solidarity within the
black community here as well as
educate others outside the com
munity.
Junior James Ransom, a mem
ber of the program planning com
mittee, said the opening sympo
sium Friday night will "address
the issue of [black] middle-class
apathy" towards other blacks.

"To me, Black Liberation
Month expresses how much
struggle we have gone through,"
Ransom said. "But I would like
to see the fruits of the civil rights
movement nurture excellence for
everyone, not just the elite few."
Fatima Ford, a junior and the
symposium's coordinator, said
this year's symposium, "Black
Class Stratification: Bridging the
Gap," reflects concerns about the
socio-economic crises facing the
black middle and lower classes.
Archuleta addressed the issue
of class conflict yesterday. "As a
people, we are worse off than in
the 1960's due to Reaganomics,"
he said. "There is presently 30
percent of the black community
below the poverty line, and 60
percent of black youths are un
employed."
Archuleta predicted a high
turnout for Friday night's pro
gram. "We expect at least 500

participants from all over the Bay
Area. We hope to reach out to
students and faculty, as well as
workers from Stanford, East Palo
Alto and other Bay Area com
munities," he said.
Black Liberation Month, cele
brated nationally, evolved from
Negro History Week, which was
founded in 1926 during the Jim
Crow days. Over the years, it be
came a celebration of the
and struggles of black people in
the United States, and was first
celebrated at Stanford in 1975.
Mwenda Kudumu, a junior and
another program organizer, said
she hopes in the future a special
month won't be necessary to ap
preciate black culture, but rather
"that it will be celebrated
throughout the 12 months and
become incorporated in the his
tory of the United States."

Planning for this year's Stan
ford events began in October,
when groups of interested stu
dents and faculty held weekly
meetings to select a relevant topic
and organize activities.
Ford said organizers try to
formulate a general theme based
on a topic that is urgent to the
black community.
Twelve black student organiza
tions on campus, working with
the Black Community Service
Center, developed programs for
the celebration. These will include
a seminar on black male role
models, a conference sponsored by
the Black Business Students As
sociation, a performance by Dance
Theater of Harlem and a youth
outreach day to East Palo Alto.
Black Liberation Month at
Stanford will open with the sym
posium at 7:30 p.m. Friday, Feb.
5, in Kresge Auditorium.
