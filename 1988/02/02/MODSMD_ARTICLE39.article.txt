A story in yesterday's Daily in
correctly summarized a report by
the Commission on Investment
Responsibility. The report did not
urge Stanford to divest, or sell
stock, from companies doing busi
ness in South Africa. Instead, the
report recommended that Stan
ford approve all shareholder
resolutions ordering companies to
disinvest, or move out of, South
Africa.
