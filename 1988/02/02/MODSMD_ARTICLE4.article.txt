# Roble closing adds confusion to Draw
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
The procedure for granting new
returning residence priorities to
former Roble Hall residents will
begin later this week when letters
are sent out to all eligible stu
dents, a University housing offi
cial said yesterday.
In addition, Rodger Whitney,
director of student housing, con
firmed that the closing of Roble
would not reduce the number of
spaces available to undergradu
ates in the Draw.
The procedure for giving out
the new returning residence
priorities is complex, Whitney
said. First, the Housing Center
must identify all students eligible
to participate in a special draw to
be held between March 10 and
March 22.
Eligible students include
anyone who has lived in Roble
since autumn quarter of 1986 and
who still qualify for housing next
year. This allows people who may
have lived in Roble as sophomores
and chose to take their unguar
anteed year in 1987-88 to regain
a returning residence priority.
Once eligible students receive
their letters, they may simply
elect to take returning residence
priority in their current residence
and drop out of the special draw.
If they elect to continue, they
must rank their preferences from
a list of 24 available choices. The
choices include all non-freshman
houses in Wilbur, Stern and

Florence Moore Halls and
Lagunita Court. Toyon Hall, the
Sterling Quadrangle dorms and
the four- and six-person suites are
also available.
In order to accommodate stu
dents who already have returning
residence priority to these dorms,
no more than 15 percent of the
spaces in any given dorm will be
available to former Roble resi
dents. That means in Toyon, for
example, 20 spaces will be avail
able, and a total of 40 spaces will
be available in the suites.
To further cloud the issue, stu
dents must select the year in
which they will exercise their new
priority — 1988-89 or 1989-90 —
before submitting their prefer
ence list.
As with the annual housing
draw, students can draw in groups
of eight. But, unlike the Draw,
they can avoid being split up from
the rest of their group as long as
they are willing to accept a lower
choice in a house that has enough
space available for the entire
group.
Whitney said keeping the num
ber of undergraduates students
on campus constant is "a very
important goal." That goal will
be accomplished by using some of
the newly created spaces in study
rooms, switching some spaces in
Manzanita Park and Mirrielees
House from gidduate to under
graduate and continuing to
"uprate" some rooms to hold an
additional person.
Some uprating was done on the
Row and in Manzanita to accom
modate former Roble residents in
January, and Whitney said the
process would continue.
Though the specifics are not in
place, Whitney cited the Lagunita
"mini-doubles" — where two
freshman live in a room identical

in size to one occupied by a single
upperclassmen — as an example
of how uprating might work.
He added that the Housing Of
fice was working to create a
"cluster of freshman" in certain
dormitories to replace the large
group that was lost from Roble
but that no plans to that end were
finalized.
Whitney also said that no deci
sion has been made whether to
tear down Roble or to reinforce
it against earthquakes, but that
one should be forthcoming in the
coming months.
