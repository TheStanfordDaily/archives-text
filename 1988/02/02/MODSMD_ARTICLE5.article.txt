# Fetter refutes minority claims
## Admissions office, ethnic groups find some common ground 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Campus minorities and the Univer
sity admissions office blame lack of com
munication for much of last week's ten
sion between the groups concerning
minority recruitment, and although dis
agreements still exist, the parties concur
on several issues, officials from both
sides said.
At a forum of campus minority
leaders at Otero House last Tuesday,
representatives from the Asian Ameri
can Student Association, El Centro
Chicano, the Stanford American Indian
Organization and the Black Student Un
ion criticized as inadequate the admis
sions office's efforts to recruit minority
students.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter defended her office in a
letter in yesterday's Daily. "Some gross
misstatements have impugned the ef
forts and credibility of the admissions
staff and have contributed to further
the misperceptions about our efforts
toward minority recruitment," Fetter
wrote.
At the forum, senior Rudy Fuentes,
El Centro's co-coordinator, charged that
admissions officers faii to recruit
minorites from South Texas when they
focus their efforts on different parts of
the country. In her letter, Fetter main
tained that since 1980, the University
has actively recruited in South Texas
every year but one.
In that year, former admissions offi
cer Chris Ponce toured the Southwest
as part of a joint recruitment trip with
recruiters from six other universities,
Fetter stated. This year, the admissions
office "stepped up" the number of
regional meetings there, and Fetter
claimed she was personally responsible
for the Houston and Dallas meetings.
Fetter also questioned AASA member

Vivian Wu's claim last Tuesday that
"working class" Asians, although
making up 50 to 60 percent of
Americans of Chinese and Japanese des
cent, are under-represented at Stanford.
Fetter said she has asked members of
the Asian American community to back
up this assertion, but that she has not
yet received a reply.
Fetter maintained that each of the
40,000 applications mailed to high
school seniors this year contains finan
cial aid information and a statement of
the University's need-blind admissions
policy.
In light of Fetter's response, Fuentes
toned down his remarks Sunday, offer
ing more conciliatory opinions on the
admissions office's minority recruit
ment efforts. He said the University
deserves commendation for attracting
more minorities than many other uni
versities, but that Stanford "still
shouldn't be complacent. Recruitment
can get better."
Ponce, now assistant dean of admis
sions, echoed Fuentes. "I don't think
anyone in the admissions office is satis
fied," he said. "We don't feel complacent
with regard to minority recruitment."
Ponce, Fuentes and Wu also agreed
there are means of improving minority
recruitment, including expansion of the
"Ambassador Program."
Under this program, Stanford
minority students returning home for
vacation visit their area high schools in
an effort to encourage other minorites
to consider pursuing higher education,
possibly at Stanford.
Trained by the admissions office,
these "supplementary representatives"
educate minority students about Stan
ford and act as role models, Ponce said.
Ponce stressed that these "ambas
sadors" will not take the place of Uni

versity admissions officers, but will
"amplify the efforts of the admissions
office" in minority recruitment for
1988.
Though the admissions office is cur
rently busy reading freshman applica
tions, Ponce said development of the
program will begin in the spring and
that a recruitment itinerary will be set
by the end of summer.
The program was first introduced in
1983, but ended aftei its student leader
graduated. In 1985, the Committee for
Undergraduate Adrmssions and Finan
cial Aids, a branch of the Faculty Sen
ate, revitalized it with support for an
other pilot program.
Ponce said it is hard to determine
the success of the 1985 program. "We
don't know how to measure its effect
because it's so new," he said. But he
added that the University will go ahead
with it again this year.
Fuentes and Wu agreed that this


Jean Fetter
could be an effective tool for
minority recruitment.
"There is a lack of resources in
any admissions office to cover the
nation," Fuentes said. "We need
to get another source, students.
Stanford should consider it (the
ambassador program), or some
thing similar. It's really a great
program."
Wu, a senior, said the ambas
sador program is a "good effort,"
but that it needs more funding
to be effective. She said the
minority representatives under
the current proposal will not
receive financial compensation for

travel expenses or wages lost for
work missed during vacation pe
riods. Wu emphasized that money
earned during vacations is crucial
to many students.
She also faulted the program
for possibly failing to reach stu
dents who don't come from high
schools represented at Stanford.
At last Tuesday's forum, SAIO
member Tracy Leßeau, a fresh
man, accused the admissions of
fice of spending "hundreds of
thousands of dollars" on a recruit
ing trip to Europe but refusing
to spend "10 dollars to go to Oak
land."
Fetter refuted these assertions,
noting that the trip to Europe
cost the admissions office only
$2400, which is five percent of
the admissions office's total travel

budget. Fetter said the trip served
to recruit minority students over
seas, and also allowed her to fulfill
obligations to the Alumni Associ
ation and the Centennial Cam
paign Committee.
Fetter also said her office dis
cussed plans this fall to enhance
local outreach efforts her office
will begin this spring.
Leßeau's uninformed state
ments illustrate a lack of commu
nication between the admissions
office and minority students con
cerning recruitment policies. Rifts
between the two groups may
therefore not always result from
differences of philosophy but from
a lack of understanding each
other clearly.
Ponce acknowledged there is a

communication problem between
the admissions office and
minority groups at Stanford. "We
don't share a common body of
knowledge," he said. "We'd like
to bridge that gap."
