# City battles Sand Hill plan
## Palo Alto leaders oppose extending road to El Camino 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Palo Alto civic leaders yesterday
voiced strong opposition to ex
tending Sand Hill Road across El
Camino Real to Alma Street
during an informal discussion of
the proposal with University of
ficials at Tresidder.
Although some Palo Alto offi
cials conceded they could accept
an end to any proposed extension
at El Camino Real, all were
adamant that there would be no
compromise on a Menlo Park pro
posal to extend the road further
to Alma Street.
"Palo Alto's position has been
that we won't even talk about it.
It (Sand Hill Road) cannot con
nect to Alma," said Ellen Wyman,
leader of the Civic League and
Palo Alto Tomorrow, two Palo
Alto community development
groups.
For about 50 years, the com
munities of Palo Alto, Menlo Park
and Stanford have argued over a
proposal to connect Sand Hill
Road to El Camino. Currently,
cars must drive through the Stan
ford Shopping Center parking lot
in order to reach El Camino.
Negotiations are at a standstill
over whether the road should be
extended to Alma Street in Palo
Alto. Palo Alto residents oppose
the further extension because
they fear the impact of the added
traffic in their neighborhoods.
Menlo Park, though, will not
agree to extend Sand Hill Road
unless it crosses El Camino into

Palo Alto. Residents say that the
extension to Alma is necessary to
prevent overburdening streets in
Menlo Park.
For a long time, Stanford has
pushed for the extension to El
Camino but has taken no stance
on the Alma dispute between Palo
Alto and Menlo Park.
"(Extending Sand Hill to Almal
is not really an answer," Wyman
said. "It's moving traffic out of
Stanford land and on into the
city." Wyman was also concerned

that Stanford may continue to
develop its Sand Hill Road prop
erty. Wyman said Stanford "con
tinues to build big, large things
on [Sand Hilll to create more traf
fic."
However, Andrew Doty, Stan
ford's director of community re
lations, countered by saying the
University has had access to the
Foothills through Interstate 280
for many years and hasn't
developed those lands. He called
this decision an act of "self
restraint" by the Universitv.
