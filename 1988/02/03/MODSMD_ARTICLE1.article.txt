# Students to bear brunt of future Roble costs
## Funds to be drawn from rent, Lyons says on KZSU 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons said
last night that the cost of repairs to Roble
Hall or the construction of new housing to
replace it would have to be borne largely
by students through an increase in rental
fees.
In a wide-ranging 35-minute interview on
KZSU radio, Lyons said the University is
closely examining how much it would cost
to reinforce the outer walls of Roble, which
were judged in December unable to support
its concrete floors in the event of a major
earthquake. He said, however, that the Uni
versity is looking for additional ways to help
defray the reinforcement costs, including a
fund-raising campaign.
"Most of (the money to rebuild Roble)
really does have to come out over the long
haul of 40 years or so," Lyons said.
"Everybody chips in a little bit of each part
of the rent to carry some debt in order to
afford housing either in the future or in
the present."
In response to a question called in by a
student during the interview regarding how
Lyons could "justify penalizing the student
body by increasing rental rates for a problem
that is really the University's," Lyons said
rent pays for all campus residences and that
if one residence must be improved, all stu
dents will pay for it.
Addressing the issue of fraternity Rush,

Lyons reiterated his long-standing postion
that alcohol should be banned from spring
Rush functions. He said he would not like
to see the University mandate a dry rush,
which it could do. Rather, he said he hoped
the fraternities would recognize that alcohol
free Rush functions are in their best inter
ests.
It is not a matter of the University im
posing some rule; it is a matter of one of
these days frats are going to find that nobody
is going to show up," Lyons said. "Who in
their right mind would publicly, in this era
of enforcement of drinking laws, advertize
parties that serve alcohol to minors? I mean,
it just doesn't make very much sense."
By adopting a dry Rush policy, fraternities
could not only overcome some of the nega
tive stereotypes of "drinking clubs" and
"rich kids," but they could also "begin to
attract some students who are interested in
being in a fraternity for all the terrific things
fraternities have to offer," Lyons said.
" This alcohol issue just gets in the way
of people seeing frats for what they some
times are and what they always can be."
he said.
In light of recent criticism directed at
fraternities regarding alleged incidences of
date and gang rape, Lyons said he felt there
is a "hidden" problem with rape on campus,
but that it would be "misleading" to asso
ciate fraternities with campus rapes.
Lyons did, however, connect alcohol with
rape. "(Sexual harassment) is a problem that

all too often happens where there is alcohol,"
he said.
Also in the interview, Lyons responded
to charges made by seme minority students
and staff last week at a public forum or
ganized by the University Committe on
Minority Issues. Lyons said he listened "very
carefully" to comments brought up at the
forum and saw some truth in crititcisms
