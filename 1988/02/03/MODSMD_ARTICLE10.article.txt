# Arab, Israeli panelists agree:
## Talk can help defuse Mideast tension 
### Tim Marklein 
Only persistent efforts to promote commu
nication and human understanding can lessen
Middle East tension, a panel of Israelis and
Palestinians agreed here last night.
"It is important not that we agree on facts
but that we are able to communicate fact to
fact, truth to truth," said panelist Samantha
Silva, one of four participants in the informal
discussion at Alph Sigma House.
The panel on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
was sponsored by Hillel, the Jewish student
organization. All four panelists were members
of the Foundation for Middle East Commu
nication, a Washington D.C.-based interest
group.
According to Silva, co-chair of the Bay Area
chapter of the foundation, the organization's
membership includes people of Jewish, Chris
tian and Muslim faiths and works to get to
"the root of the Middle East problem: com
munication."
Panelist jsmily Shihadeh, a Palestinian

emigre to the United States, said conflict in
the Middle East was and is a real element in
her life. Although she left the Middle East
many years ago, she said one memory of her
childhood still lingers: the loss of her house
to Israelis. She said she grew up with constant
feelings of "being a victim."
Shihadeh said she still feels a need to com
municate those feelings. "In human relations
we have to talk about things," she said. "We
can't hold things back." Talking about her
youth "does something to me to bring out
old pains," she added.
Another panelist, journalist Avner Perry,
agreed that communication helps heal old
wounds. As a Jew born in Palestine, he said
he "grew up thinking of Arabs in fear." His
culture taught him to despise Palestinians,
he said. In retrospect, "I'm saddened by that,"
he said.
Perry said participating in workshops spon
sored by the foundation has softened his "an
ger" toward Palestinians. Even though his
childhood beliefs predisposed him to avoid

contact with Palestinians, he said he is now
able to consider Shihadeh "a friend."
Similarly, Shihadeh said her attitudes
toward Israelis have softened because of her
involvement with the foundation and its peace
efforts. She said the organization stresses "re
lationships between individuals, families, com
munities and countries."
Silva noted that although there are many
other interest groups related to Middle East
ern issues, most usually partake in "positional
work" which forces people apart because of
its emphasis on conflict.
She argued that "what makes [the foun
dation] unique is that all of us disagree, yet
we are able to work together. That's where
a lasting solution is."
The fourth panelist was Santa Rosa resident
Dottie Kay, who described herself as Jewish
"by upbringing but not by choice."
Last night's forum was part of a series of
programs sponsored by Hillel designed to in
form community members about the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.
