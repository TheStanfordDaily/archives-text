# Gift establishes scholarship fund
## Minority undergraduates targeted 
### Glen Tripp Staff writer 
A local philanthropist has
given Stanford two pieces of
Palo Alto property worth ap
proximately $334,000 in order
to establish an undergraduate
scholarship fund with a pref
erence for black and other
minority students.
The donation from Celeste
Neely, who has no official Stan
ford ties but considers herself
"devoted to education," will be
supplemented by a $110,000
gift from the Hewlett Pledge
for Scholarships. The pledge
adds one third to any donation
of $100,000 and above.
All students applying for fi
nancial aid will be considered
recipients of the funds, but
black and minority students
will be given first priority, ac
cording to University Develop
ment Officer Fred Hartwick.
Minority students, especially
black undergratuates, will be
considered first for Neely's gift
until the University has met
its financial aid comitment to
them. Only then will all other
students may be considered for
the scholarships.
The scholarship is being
awarded in honor of Neely's
daughter, Hortense Miller, who
died in 1985.
Neely had her first contact
with Stanford when she began
using its libraries and attend

ing moot trials while working
toward a correspondence law
degree in the 19405.
Although she considered es
tablishing scholarships at other
colleges, Neely said that "one
thing turned me on to Stanford
— it will be around forever.
And I've never heard of a Stan
ford graduate getting into
serious trouble."
"Highly educated people
don't accentuate race so
much," the 87-year-old added.
Neely, who was the first
black real estate agent in Palo
Alto, has operated numerous
businesses with her husband
during the 50 years she has
lived in the city.
Born to a rural Louisiana
family in 1900, Neely was the
24th of 25 children, only six of
whom lived to adulthood.
She began her education in
Louisiana, despite the fact that
the state provided at the time
just three months of schooling
a year for blacks. "My family
believed in education," she
said. "I kept my head in books."
After teaching school in
Louisiana for a year, Neely left
for California, arriving in Palo
Alto in 1927.
From Palo Alto, Neely
pursued learning via the mail,
eventually earning a bachelor's
degree in law from Chicago's
La Salle University in 1948. "I
just kept on studying," she
said.
