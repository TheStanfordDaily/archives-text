Man shot in clash with Israelis
OFRA, Occupied West Bank — A Palestinian
was wounded yesterday in new clashes with
the Israeli army, Arab reports said. Jewish
settlers vowed to carry out vigilante justice if
the army failed to protect them.
The Palestine Press Service and officials at
al Ittihad Hospital said soldiers shot a 21-
year-old Palestinian, Said Yassin, in the pelvis
after protests in the West Bank city of
Tulkarem.
The Arab-run agency also said 20 Pales
tinians were beaten by soldiers during a dem
onstration in the nearby village of Habla.
The army said it imposed curfews on Habla
and Tulkarem refugee camp but could not
confirm the reports of injuries immediately.
The latest clashes came after nearly eight
weeks of violence in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
In Washington, Secretary of State George
Shultz told Congress he had undertaken a
new Mideast diplomatic initiative designed to
provide "a greater sense of political control"
to the 1.5 million Palestinians who live in the
occupied territories.
E. Germans expel 4 dissidents
BONN, West Germany — East Germany
expelled four dissidents to West Germany yes
terday in an action apparently aimed at calm
ing tempers among young East Berliners who
have been demonstrating for reform.
At the same time, Wolfgang Vogel, an East
Berlin lawyer, said he thought that a score of
demonstrators arrested over the last two weeks
would be freed, possibly by the weekend.
Vogel, who has been involved in a number
of East-West exchanges, said he expected "that
all detainees will be released this week, and
that they will be able to emigrate if they desire
to do so."
More than 200 dissidents, most of them
young people, were arrested in East Berlin
Jan. 17, when they tried to join an official
parade headed by East German leader Erich
Honecker commemorating the German Com
munist revolutionaries Rosa Luxemburg and
Karl Liebknecht. Twenty of them are still in
jail facing possible treason charges.
Since then, meetings of support have been
held in East German Protestant churches, cul
minating Monday night in a service attended
by 2,000 people.

Meese cart't recall key events
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111 said 29 times on the witness stand
yesterday that he had difficulty recalling key
events in the illegal-lobbying case against Lyn
Nofziger, his old friend and former White
House aide.
Meese testified repeatedly that he had "no
independent recollection," "no distinct recol
lection," "no specific recollection" or simply
"no recollection" of being lobbied by Nofziger
in 1982 on a no-bid, $32 million Army contract
for scandal-torn Wedtech Corp.
In a dramatic, though business-like con
frontation, Meese was questioned at Nofziger's
trial by independent counsel James McKay,
who also has been investigating Meese.
The special prosecutor has tentatively
cleared Meese on a Wedtech-related matter
but is actively probing an Iraqi pipeline deal
involving Meese and his friend, E. Robert Wal
lach.
McKay, wrapping up the prosecution's case
against Nofziger, asked Meese some questions
about Wallach. But they were only to establish
for the jury what had been previously
publicized: that Wallach first brought the dis
puted Wedtech contract to Meese's attention
in 1981 and that Meese ordered a review by
his staff to give the company "a fair hearing."
