# Banks slash prime rate amid fears
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Major banks
across the country cut their prime
lending rate to 8.5 percent from 8.75
percent yesterday amid growing con
cerns that the nation's economy is on
the verge of a recession.
Just before the banks moved, the
government reported that its chief
barometer of future economic activity
fell for the third month in a row, a
development that often signals a
downturn just around the corner. And
slack economic activity typically
results in falling interest rates.
But despite several recent negative
economic indicators, a wide range of
analysts say they are convinced that
fears of a recession are overblown.
"If this is a recession we're entering,
it's the strangest one we've ever had,"
said Lyle Gramley, chief economist at
the Mortgage Bankers Association and
a former Federal Reserve board mem
ber. "I see a brief slowdown in activity,
but the engine driving the real eco
nomy has not been shut off."
The drop in bank lending rates,
which began with New York's Morgan
Guaranty Trust and quickly spread to
most other major banks, came in

response to other interest rates that
have dropped recently because of un
expected signs of economic weakness
and speculation that the Federal
Reserve might be forced to ease credit
to help ward off further erosion.
The cut in the prime rate, which is
used by banks to set interest rates of
a variety of business and consumer
loans, leaves the key lending rate at
its lowest level since last September,
when it jumped from 8.25 percent to
8.75 percent. Banks last reduced the
prime rate in early November, shortly
after the Oct. 19 stock market crash.
Yesterday's 0.2 percent drop in the
Department of Commerce's index of
leading indicators for December — fol
lowing a sharp 1.2 percent November
setback that was primarily due to fall
out from the stock market collapse
and a revised 0.1 percent dip in Oc
tober — was the latest in a series of
reports that have convinced a number
of analysts and many investors that
the economy has already begun to turn
downward.
"The question now is not whether
we are in a recession," said Irwin Kel
lner, chief economist of Manufacturers

Hanover Bank in New York, "but how
long and how deep it will be."
Last week, the government reported
that consumer spending fell sharply
during the last quarter of 1987, raising
fears that a large accumulation of un
sold goods may force companies to cut
production and jobs to bring their in
ventories in line with shrinking sales.
The government also reported Tues
day that sales of new single-family
homes fell for the second consecutive
month in December, dropping 6.2 per
cent after a 2.4 percent dip in Novem
ber.
In addition, unemployment claims
have been on the rise for the past
several weeks, pointing to sluggish job
growth last month and fostering
worries inside the Reagan administra
tion that unemployment could start
climbing this year. That wouTT be a
big blow to the Republicans' dhtances
of retaining control of the White House
in November's election.
Whether unemployment rose last
month, as many analysts expect it did,
will become clear Friday when the De
partment of Labor reports job figures
for January.

In the reverse logic of Wall Street,
though, bad news for the economy is
usually good news for investors in the
bond market, who welcome slow
growth or even recession because it
reduces the dangers of inflation and
increases the likelihood that the Fed
will try to stimulate the economy by
driving interest rates down.
As a result, bond prices rallied
throughout the day, and bond yields,
which move in the opposite direction,
sagged. The yield on the 30-year Treas
ury bond fell to about 8.32 percent,
its lowest level since last April, from
8.42 percent Monday.
But many economists remain un
convinced that the economy is collaps
ing. "The bond market is fundamen
tally misreading the economy," Gram
ley said.
"The recession crowd is in full cry,"
added Larry Kudlow, chfief economist
at the New York investment company
of Bear, Stearns & Co., "but I just
don't buy it. We are likely to see a
mild mid-course correction that will
extend the recovery, not abort it. "
