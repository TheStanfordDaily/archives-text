# Gephardt leads in Iowa
## 
### 
Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri has
surged to the front of the pack of Demo
cratic presidential contenders in Monday's
lowa caucuses, while former front-runner
Gary Hart has fallen to fourth place, ac
cording to a Gallup Poll released yesterday.
Gephardt, the favorite of 32 percent of
the Democrats surveyed, led Gov. Michael
Dukakis of Massachusetts who had 19 per
cent, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois with 15
percent and Hart, 13 percent. Former Gov.
Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson each had 6 percent, with 9
percent undecided.
On the Republican side, Sen. Bob Dole
of Kansas continued to hold a comfortable
lead over Vice President George Bush. Dole
had 39 percent; Bush, 27 percent; Rep.
Jack Kemp of New York, 10 percent; former
evangelist Pat Robertson, 8 percent; former
Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware, 6 percent;
and former Secretary of State Alexander
Haig, 1 percent. Nine percent were un
decided.
Last month's Gallup survey in lowa

showed Hart leading with 34 percent;
Simon, 16 percent; Gephardt, 15 percent;
and Dukakis, 13 percent.
Gephardt appears to be peaking at the
right time in the state where he has focused
virtually all his attention in recent months.
But predicting the outcome of the lowa
caucuses with a poll is difficult because
only a small percentage of the eligible
voters turn out and because the voting is
done in public, subject to the arguments
and pressures of peers.
With a low turnout, a candidate with
good organization often does better than
the poll results would predict. Bush and
Dukakis are viewed by many reporters as
having superior organizations in lowa.
While support was shifting dramatically
among Democratic voters, there was little
change on the Republican side. Dole
dropped slightly over the month from 44
percent to 39 percent, and Bush stayed
about the same — 29 percent last month
and 27 percent now.
