# FBI chief Sessions admits to improper investigation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — FBI Director William
Sessions denied yesterday that the bureau
"mounted a massive surveillance campaign
against American citizens opposed to the
administration's Central American policy,"
but he acknowledged that the probe of a
liberal group "was not properly directed"
in all instances.
Speaking to reporters at FBI headquar
ters three months after becoming director,
Sessions offered the bureau's first detailed
explanation of documents released last
week by the Center for Constitutional
Rights, a New York lawyers' group.
The documents, obtained under the
Freedom of Information Act, showed that
the Federal Bureau of Investigation had
extensively investigated the Committee in
Solidarity with the People of El Salvador
(CISPES).
During their investigation, agents
photographed protesters at peace rallies
and recorded their license-plate numbers;
investigated union members and college
students; and checked up on church forums
and Knights of Columbus dinners, accord

ing to the documents.
Sessions said the probe was prompted
by tips that key CISPES members "were
involved in covertly furnishing funds and
material to a foreign terrorist or
ganization," the FMLN, a leftist opposition
group in El Salvador.
He said FBI agents conducted only "lim
ited investigation" of other groups "to
round out or develop information on the
scope of activities and influence of
CISPES."
Sessions, who is conducting an internal
reveiw of the investigation at the request
of President Reagan and Attorney General
Edwin Meese 111, testified Tuesday at a
closed meeting of the Senate Select Com
mittee on Intelligence.
Chairman David Boren (D-Okla.) said
the panel had asked for "all unedited doc
uments relating to the investigation of do
mestic groups" and had told Sessions "the
seriousness with which it views allegations
of inappropriate activity" in such surveil
lance.
