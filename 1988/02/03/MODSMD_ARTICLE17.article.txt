TUSCALOOSA, Ala. - Two
gunmen, one of whom report
edly has a history of mental
illness, broke into a private
Baptist elementary school here
yesterday, took about 85 pupils
hostage and, in an effort to aid
the homeless, demanded to
speak with President Reagan,
Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt and
Tuscaloosa Mayor A 1 DuPont.
The gunmen — one white
and one black — donned ski
masks and entered the West
End Christian School at about
8:40 a.m. Authorities said the
pair apparently seized the stu
dents and two teachers solely
in an attempt to protest alleged
government neglect of the
nation's homeless and hungry.
At mid-day the black gun
man, who was not identified,
surrendered and was taken
into custody. About an hour
later the white gunman, iden
tified as James Harvey, a Viet
nam War veteran with a his
tory of mental illness, released
40 of the children.

Then, at approximately 3:30
p.m. he released nine of the
remaining hostage pupils in ex
change for a chance to talk with
an Associated Press reporter.
He also released one of the two
teachers, Judy Dunne, who
teaches fourth grade and is
pregnant.
The children taken hostage
were members of the first-,
third-, fourth- and fifth-grade
classes at the school, authori
ties said. They added that the
second-grade class managed to
escape after their teacher grew
suspicious during the break-in
and led them to safety. The
sixth-grade class was away
from the school on a field trip.
Tuscaloosa police and
Federal Bureau of Investiga
tion agents surrounded the
school building and, along with
Mayor DuPont and other
public officials, immediately
began negotiations with the
gunmen.
