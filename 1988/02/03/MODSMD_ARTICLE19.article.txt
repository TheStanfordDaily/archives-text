## Contra aid wrong 
### 
CONTRARY to the Reagan
administration's claims, the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua
do not enjoy widespread support
among the Nicaraguan people.
This, combined with mounting
evidence suggesting that the rebels
differ little from the Sandinistas
in terms of human rights abuses,
should have convinced the U.S.
government to halt Contra aid long
ago.
With Arias' peace plan in its cri
tical stages and another vote over
new aid coming before the House
today, now is the time to halt fur
ther U.S. support for the rebels.
An article in Monday's Wall
Street Journal described the ex
perience of a group of journalists
who traveled for three days with
Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
The trip, intended by the Con
tras as a public relations vehicle
to demonstrate their movement's
extensive support among civilians
in Nicaragua, ended up having the
opposite effect.
Instead, the group witnessed
rebels steal and slaughter farmers'
livestock, coerce them to partici
pate in troop maneuvers, and fi
nally, force civilians to declare
their allegiance to the Contras
against their wishes.
As the article's author concluded
at the end of his trip, this clearly
illustrates that the Contras do not
enjoy the popular support that the
Reagan Administration would have
the U.S. public believe they do.
Reports such as these demon
strate the futility of providing
funds to a rebel movement that
the majority of Nicaragua's popu
lation does not embrace.
Reagan will again try to make
his case for Contra aid today when
the House votes on whether or not
to send $3.6 million in "lethal"
and $32.6 million in "non-lethal"
aid to the rebels.
The first problem with this pro

posal is that the distinction be
tween these two types of aid is as
misguided as the administration's
broader policy in Nicaragua. Be
cause "non-lethal" aid can be used
to maintain weaponry or to free
funds to be used to increase the
Contras' arsenals, all of the $36
million in proposed aid is, in effect,
lethal.
A decision to increase any kind
of U.S. aid to the rebels, when
they have received over $100 mil
lion in CIA-handled funds over the
past 16 months, comes at a par
ticularly inopportune time.
In providing this aid, the United
States will ignore Nobel Peace
Laureate and Costa Rican Presi
dent Oscar Arias' specific request
that outside countries not interfere
with the progress of his peace plan.
Proponents of this aid, including
Stanford's representative to
Congress Ernie Konnyu, argue
that keeping a portion of this aid
in escrow to deliver only if Arias'
plan fails will pressure the Sandi
nista government into signing the
peace agreement.
Yet Konnyu and others who sup
port this aid must realize that
while threats to increase Contra
funding may pressure the Sandi
nistas to sign a peace treaty, it will
create a corresponding disincentive
for Contra participation in the
plan.
It may also provoke increased
Soviet assistance to the Sandinis
tas.
Since the Sandinistas came to
power in 1979, the United States
has maintained a policy of inter
ference in Nicaraguan affairs.
Now that progress is possible,
we shouldn't hinder it by creating
outside pressures which may prove
too strong for the fragile founda
tion Arias is trying to construct
for peace in Central America.
