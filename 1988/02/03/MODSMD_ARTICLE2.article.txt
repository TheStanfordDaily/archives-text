# Judge expected to uphold curbs on NCAA testing
## Drug case set to enter final phase 
### Leslie Hatamiya Staff writer 
The final trial in the ongoing
NCAA drug-testing case that in
volves two Stanford athletes is
scheduled to open Monday, but
Santa Clara County Superior
Court Judge Conrad Rushing is
not expected to alter his prelim
inary rulings severely restricting
the NCAA's mandatory drug
testing program.
In a Nov. 19 preliminary in
junction, Rushing forbade NCAA
drug testing of all Stanford ath
letes except members of the foot
ball and men's basketball teams.
Two weeks later, on Dec. 4, he
issued another preliminary in
junction ruling that these athletes
may only be tested for four sub
stances: steroids, cocaine, heroin
and amphetamines. The judge
further stipulated that NCAA of

ficials may not monitor athletes
as they urinate.
"I doubt that {Rushing] will
change his decision because there
have already been two weeks of
extensive testimony and evidence
and the court has indicated that
it has already thoroughly
reviewed the evidence," said Stan
ford attorney Debra Zumwalt,
who is representing the Univer
sity as a third party in the case
against the NCAA.
In essence, "the court has al
ready decided the case once," she
said.
NCAA General Counsel George
Gangwere said that "it's conceive
able that the judge could change
[his decision] in several respects."
Because the Nov. 19 and Dec.
4 rulings are only preliminary in
junctions, which are meant to
stand only until the judge makes
a final decision in a case, it is

legally possible that Rushing may
change his position in a final
ruling.
According to Zumwalt, after the
Dec. 4 ruling Stanford and the
two student plaintiffs, senior soc
cer player Jennifer Hill nnd i
linebacker Barry McKeever,
"were willing to stipulate that the
preliminary injunction be the
final trial."
The NCAA, however, exercising
its legal right to a full trial and
a final ruling, insisted on the up
coming final trial in order to bring
in more expert testimony.
"We are entitled to put up more
evidence and get a final trial," he
said. "We have to keep trying."
All evidence presented at the
preliminary hearing will be con
sidered as evidence in the final
trial, Zumwalt said. Unlike the
NCAA, Stanford, Hill and
McKeever do not plan to submit

new evidence, she said.
Although the final ruling will
be "specific to Stanford athletes,"
Zumwalt said the case would
likely be "considered to be per
suasive authority' in similar cases
nfltiun w ido.
In his preliminary rulings,
Rushing determined that Stan
ford athletes are unique among
college athletes because the Uni
versity "does not distinguish be
tween its students and its student
athletes, favors drug education
and has a program to carry out
drug education at its own in
stitution."
Rushing will make his final
ruling on the case at the conclu
sion of this trial, which will con
tinue Feb. 10, 17 and 19. Because
Rushing is currently involved in
another case, the trial will not be
heard on consecutive days.
