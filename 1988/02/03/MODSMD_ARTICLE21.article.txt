## Liberal future Gore-y 
### 
LET'S GET ONE THING straight
right away. I'm a Republican, and
I'll be voting for the (likely) Bush-
Kemp ticket in November. Whether or
not that team can be beaten is at the
heart of this column, for there is only
one man in the current crop of Demo
cratic contenders who has a strong
chance of upending the GOP.
When you look at history, the Demo
cratic nomination process and current
demographics, you see clearly why Albert
Gore must be the Democratic nominee
if his party is serious about winning the
White House.
The Democrats have a lot of problems
this year (this decade, actually), not the
least of which is the fact that their pres
idential nomination procedure is so
hopelessly rigged against producing a vi
able candidate with broad national ap
peal who can win in the November elec
tion.
The nomination process starts years
early in lowa of all places, a very self
important state where everyone's got a
big mouth, a big gripe and an even bigger
John Deere tractor.
(I really dislike the lowans I've been
seeing on TV lately. These damn people
seem honestly offended if they haven't
met a candidate personally four or five
times!
(A candidate could wrap up the elec
tion right now by saying, "lowans, stop
squawking. You'll get no farm aid and
like it!" People in the Northeast, South
and West would love it!)
Today's spineless candidates are
forced to tell lowa voters exactly what
they want to hear, however, and not one
candidate in the anaemic bunch has dem
onstrated the courage and conviction to
tell these people where to stick their
lousy caucus â€” except Albert Gore,

who's skipped town (that would be Des
Moines if you're scoring at home) and
headed south.
By A) pandering to grumpy, very
liberal lowans, and B) possessing a hope
lessly out-of-touch national leadership
that's living the Keynesian glory days
of FDR, Democrats keep nominating
candidates far to the left of mainstream
America. Today's Democratic Party is
truly the embodiment of the Pogo Prin
ciple: We have seen the enemy, and it
is ourselves.
So much for lowa. After New
Hampshire, the field will inevitably win
now, with Babbitt, Hart, and perhaps
even Gephardt taking the plunge. The
remaining Democrats wiil continue their
pitiful pandering to interest groups that
always promise much more than they
can deliver on election day.
Where the Democratic nominee hails
from is almost as important as his/her
ideology. Democrats, gather 'round and
spread the word: Republicans know how
to beat Northern liberals. In fact, due
to demographics, it's really quite easy.
You can't win without the support of
the South and the West, which are
quickly falling into the Republican
ranks.
As statistical evidence, Texas is the
only southern state carried by Demo
crats in even half of the past six elec
tions. Also, among the 18 states fre
quently classified as "western", the
Republicans have won 16 in each of the
last five elections. These states alone
provide 123 electoral votes, nearly half
of the 270 needed to capture the
presidency. California has gone to the
Republican candidate in five of the last
six elections. So Democrats, send us no
Simons, no Dukakises and certainly no

Jacksons, or you will unquestionably lose
the election (perhaps all 50 states again),
and it'll be your own damn fault.
In short, Democrats, before you cast
your ballot, look beyond the horserace
for the nomination and vote for the man
with an ideology that's palatable to the
mainstream voter, not just Eleanor
Smeal's cronies. Don't blindly back the
candidate with the best shot for the
nomination, or even the one who agrees
with you on 9 out of 10 issues (after
all, isn't any Democrat in vour mind
better than another Republican?). Look
for the candidate with the best shot to
win the election in November. Have your
eyes on the right prize! The goal must
be the White House, not merely the nom
ination.
Should the Democrats choose another
northern liberal, the Republicans will
win the presidency yet again, with ease.
A Southerner must be chosen. Other
wise, on Nov. 8, Dan Rather will turn
around from his anchor desk, and with
a large tear in his eye, he'll see a huge
map of election results with Republican
blue from Maine to Milpitas. The
violently liberal anchor may walk off the
set in disgust. Will the Republicans really
deserve all the credit, though, or have
the Democrats just blown it again,
snatching defeat from the jaws of vic
tory?
