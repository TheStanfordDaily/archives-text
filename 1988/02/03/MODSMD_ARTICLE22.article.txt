## Sandinista efforts in peace initiative revealed 
### 
Al2-MEMBER legal delegation of
the National Lawyers Guild
recently spent two weeks in
Nicaragua focusing on the Central
American Peace Plan signed by five
Central American Presidents in
Guatemala City on August 7, 1987.
Point five of the Peace Plan recently
reaffirmed in the Jan. 15 meeting in
Costa Rica calls on governments out
side the region to terminate "military,
logistical, financial or public relations
support" to insurrectionist movements
as "an indispensable condition of at
taining peace in the region."
The fact that members of Congress
are discussing any aid to the Contras
is a slap in the face to the right of
self-determination of these countries

and destabilizing to the entire peace
process.
The Nicaraguan government has
made great steps to comply with the
Peace Plan. There are 14 political
parties in Nicaragua, including
Marxist-Leninist and Communist par
ties who criticize the government for
catering to the private sector and
preserving the rights of wealthier
producers and U.S. companies that
continue to operate in Nicaragua.
There is remarkable freedom of the
press given the fact that the country is
at war. The newspaper La Prensa and
Radio Catolica operate daily and freely
criticize the government. Political
opposition holds rallies and demonstra
tions, some led by conservative U.S.
congressmen.

The U.S. is waging a cruel war
against the people of Nicaragua. In
equivalent U.S. terms, more
Nicaraguans have died in the Contra
war than U.S. citizens died in World
War I, World War 11, Korea and Viet
nam wars combined; a large percentage
of Contra victims are civilians,
predominantly rural peasants.
The war aimed at destroying the
economic infrastructure and the U.S.
economic embargo are having the
intended effect of causing Nicaraguans
to sufiftr to obtain a minimal survival.
However, it is not having the intended
effect of turning the Nicaraguan people
against the government which has
eradicated polio, improved literacy and
redistributed land to peasant families.

The U.S.-backed Contra war must
end. The Contras must come back into
the political process guaranteed them
under the government's amnesty law
as some have done already. It may be
too late to influence the current con
gressional vote on Contra aid; however,
I believe that ultimately only massive
demonstrations and actions by the
majority of U.S. citizens that oppose
the war will get our government to
stop its cruel treatment of this small
nation of three million people. We as
students can do our bit to try to get
our government to let Central America
make its own peace.
