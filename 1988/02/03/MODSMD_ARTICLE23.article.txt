# Women employees need organization
## 
### 
The stories Jan. 26 and 27 in The
Daily on Debra Rhode, Stanford law
professor and director of the Institute
for the Study of Women and Gender
who was charged with not using her
position on the Yale Corporation to
help Yale working women, awakened
memories.
I was at meetings in the early
1970's from which the present Center
for Research on Women, or CROW,
emerged.
It was decided at the time to form a
Stanford women's organization to
exclude all but faculty women, on the
premise that they would have the
prestige, clout or security to be a force
for the advancement of women.
I have been waiting for them to be
that ever since.
In 1979-80, when Stanford's clerical
workers — most of them, of course,

women — fought for collective bargain
ing rights to improve the pay and
conditions of their employment, they
sent a letter of appeal for support to
CROW.
Though some individual faculty
women (countable on the fingers of
one rather badly mutilated hand) did
sign sympathetic statements, CROW, I
was told by leaders of the organizing
effort, never even dignified the letter
with the courtesy of a reply.
In 1974 I filed and two years later
won a grievance against the blatantly
sexist salary distribution in the Univer
sity Libraries, which netted 18 women
librarians $50,000 in back pay.
With a naivet6 I have since lost, I
assumed the matter would be of inter
est to Stanford's affirmative action
officer for women — a darling of
CROW members — and sent her a
copy of the grievance document, full of
facts and horrendous figures. (A griev
ance is a rather harrowing process of
very little fun in which the grievant is
pitted against the might of the Univer

sity and soon learns that justice is not
of very high priority in this institu
tion.)
Some 20 months into the grievance,
she and I met under the showers of
DeGuerre. "How," she drawled, "is
that Thing of yours going?" — those
being the first and last words I ever
heard her pronounce on the subject.
Last month, 63 faculty women
signed a letter to President Kennedy
protesting Stanford's institutional
support of the Bohemian Club, an
organization that excludes them. I
noted from their letter a total and
shameful absence of any allusion to
the nasty little role the Club plays in
American politics or its ugly and op
pressive labor policies toward women
and minorities.
Places like Stanford and Yale foster
the flourishing of women — and
minorities — who use liberation move
ments merely to further their own
careers and attain positions they could
never have aspired to had it not been
for the struggles of others.

They feel blissfully free of any re
sponsibility for extending the power
and influence they have thus won to
help those less able or well-positioned.
It pains — and frightens — me to
hear students talk of such people as
"role models." I do believe that, before
according one's admiration to such
models, one should take a good hard
look at the role they play.
