# 'Psycho Fan' must be in the front row
## 
### 
Who says Stanford doesn't
have good fans?
Basketball crowds have been
more rowdy this season than
in recent memory, and while
this is probably due in large
part to the increased success
of both the men's and women's
programs, Cardinal fans also
have a little additional incen
tive this year.

The Psycho Fan.
You know, the guy in the
middle of the front row with
the red Stanford jacket and of
ten a cap. The fan who is al
ways on his feet, applauding
Stanford scores and yelling at
the refs and the other team.
Not your ordinary sedate
Maples Pavilion patron.
The Psycho Fan thus fills a
void Stanford sports has suf
fered since the irrepressible
Cornelius Williams graduated
two years ago. Corn, well
known for his cowboy hat
and/or the comb he often wore
rakishly on his head, stomped
the floor so hard at Maples
during opposing players' free
throws that he was frequently
warned by officials to desist.
His antics even once caused the
volleyball team to be penalized
a point.
Since then, crowds had
remained pretty placid and
boring. But now, The Psycho
Fan has become a fixture at
every home basketball game,

men's and women's, and was
seen over the weekend at the
baseball games against Santa
Clara — even at Santa Clara.
The Psycho Fan is not your
ordinary heckler, however.
While most run-of-the-mill
hecklers will shut up fast when
their victims confront them,
our vociferous fan doesn't back
down.
One of the most enjoyable
moments of the season so far
was when The Psycho Fan was
yelling "You, you, you," and
pointing at Washington State
guard David Sanders. Sanders
turned and looked at The Fan.
Did our hero meekly retire
back to his seat? Of course not.
He kept looking directly at
Sanders and continued point
ing at him while shouting
"You, you." Sanders could only
stand there and glower.
It's definitely nice to have at
least one crazy person in the
crowd keeping the refs on their
toes, rattling the other team
and making the Stanford crowd
a little less inhibited. The
strange thing is, The Psycho
Fan isn't really psycho and
doesn't go to Stanford.
He's a planetologist (despite
what you're thinking, this has
nothing to do with astrology
— it's the study of planetary
geology) named Ken Trego who
has been working here for
three months. He graduated
from Arizona State, but says
that ASU is not a good school
in terms of tradition, so he's
a Stanford fan instead.
He does admit, however, that
Stanford could use a little more
crowd support. "There are fans
there," Trego said, "they just
need to be a little louder. It's
