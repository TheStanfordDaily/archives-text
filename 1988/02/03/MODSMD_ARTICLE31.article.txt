## Men's tennis coasts at San Jose 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
It wasn t anything
to write home
about, but the top
ranked Stanford
men's tennis team
nevertheless re
corded a ho-hum

5-2 win yesterday in the South
Bay against the unranked and
outmanned San Jose State Spar
tans.
Spurred by Malcolm Allen's 5-7,
6-3, 6-3 upset victory over the
Cardinal's Jeff Tarango, the Spar
tans almost made a match of it.
But sparked by regulars Martin
Blackman, Glenn Solomon and
Jeff Cathrall, and reserves Curtis
Dunn and Dan Turbow, Stan
ford's top-to-bottom strength
came through in the end to stake
the Cardinal to an easy victory.
The Cardinal improved to 3-0,
while the Spartans dropped to 1-1.
"It wasn't a sterling match,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"We didn't play great, but the
guys who needed to play did play
and we got out of there with a
victory. San Jose is a much im
proved team over last year."
The best match of the day was
at the No. 1 position. Tarango
and Allen split their two matches
last year and Allen proved to be
the Spartans' best player by a
wide margin. In the deciding set,
Allen's shots on key points were
simply too good.
"I played well, but didn't capi
talize on the big points," Tarango
said. "To be on the No. 1 team
and be the No. 1 player, I've got
to play a lot better. In the tough
matches I've got to win my
match."
Tarango, who was beaten by
Tennesse's Shelby Cannon and
Georgia Tech's Kenny Thorne last
weekend in Atlanta, had to settle
for his third loss this season in
three tries. Last year, by contrast,
Tarango swept to victories in his
first 10 matches.

"He can beat the guys he has
played," Gould said. "I was
pleased that he improved since
his last two matches. He played
much more intelligently than he
did in Atlanta. It's good experi
ence for Jeff going into the in
doors (Rolex Ail-American Indoor
Championships)."
Blackman defeated San Jose
State's Roberto Digiulo 6-3, 6-4,
Solomon outlasted Tom Sheehan
6-1, 4-6, 6-0 and Cathrall bombed
Gavin MacMillan 6-2, 6-2. All
three have started the season 3-0.
"I think we were probably a bit
overconfident," Solomon
said."Things got a little tight but
we were in command the whole
way. I'm playing well enough
right now to have a real good
season."

probably a bit over

Stanford's other two victories
came at No. 6 singles and No. 3
doubles. Junior Curtis Dunn, who
is also playing in this weekend's
Rolex Ail-American Indoor Cham
pionships in Minneapolis
Thursday through Sunday, edged
Spartan Eric Burley 6-4, 7-5.
In the only doubles match com
pleted yesterday, freshman Dan
Turbow, making his collegiate
debut with the Cardinal, paired
with Solomon to down the Burley-
Gary Peralta duo 6-1, 3-6, 6-2.
Sophomore Eric Peus, entering
the singles ladder for the first
time this season, bowed to San
Jose State's Paul Carbon 6-4, 6-4.
The matches involving the first
two Cardinal doubles teams,
Blackman-Tarango and Cathrall-
Peus, were halted in the third set.
