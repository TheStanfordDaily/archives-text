# Cardinal blasts out of batting slump vs. Davis, 13-8
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
It didn't take long yesterday for the
Stanford baseball team to break out
of its two-game batting slump.
Junior second baseman Frank
Carey, batting in the lead-off position
for the first time this year, stroked
the second pitch from UC-Davis

pitcher Ron Staub up the middle for a single. Ron
Witmeyer and Paul Carey followed with doubles,
and the attack was on.
The Cardinal, which had a total of six hits and
five runs in the first two games of the season,
banged out 14 hits — including six doubles and a
home run — on the way to a 13-8 defeat of the
Aggies at Sunken Diamond. The win improves
second-ranked Stanford's record to 2-1. The Aggies
go to 0-1.
The Cardinal was due for an offensive explosion.
"We just got tired of scratching for a couple runs,"
sophomore shortstop Troy Paulsen said. "Everybody
went out today and said, 'We gotta hit the ball
hard' instead of worrying about where we're stand
ing in the (batter's) box or where our hands are."
"We were like a volcano waiting to erupt," junior
Ed Sprague said. "Our hitting is going to come .. .
We just have to wait for the big inning."
The big inning finally came in the second against
the Aggies. With Stanford up 2-1, Brian Johnson
led off with a single — his first hit of the season
— into left. Paulsen lashed a double — his first
hit of the season — down the left-field line, with
Johnson stopping at third. Freshman center fielder
Mike Eicher, in his first collegiate at-bat, roped a

single into left to score Johnson and Paulsen.
After Staub walked the next two batters, Frank
Carey and Doug Robbins, Jim Woodward came on
in relief. Witmeyer hit what looked like a double-play
ball to second, but Aggie second-baseman Alex Case
booted the ball. Eicher and Carey crossed the plate
and the score was 6-1 with no outs.
That brought up Sprague, hitless for the season
up to that point. Down 0-2 in the count, he unloaded
a drive that landed somewhere in Mountain View.
Three-run homer, score: 9-1.

"It's good to get the first [home run] out of the
way," Sprague said. "I think that's what this team
needed ... it needed to show itself, 'Hey we can
hit,' that we're a good team — not just on paper."
Eicher wasn't the only player making his Stanford
debut. Freshman right-hander Stan Spencer started
for the Cardinal and turned in three strong innings,
giving up two hits and one run — a home run in
the second by Aggie designated hitter Warren Buck.
Sophomore Mark Carper and juniors Jim Price
and Steve Chitren mopped up for the Cardinal.
Spencer may be on the mound again Friday for
the first game of this weekend's three-game series
with Fullerton State, Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. The Titans face the Cardinal at 2
p.m. Friday, noon Saturday and 1 p.m. Sunday. All
games are at Sunken Diamond.
