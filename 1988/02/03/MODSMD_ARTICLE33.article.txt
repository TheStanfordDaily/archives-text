Have you ever
seen a frozen
golf ball?
They were in
abundance yes
terday as the
Stanford wom-

en's golf team played most the
day in freezing rain on a course
which, even under ideal condi
tions, produces unusually high
scores.
Monday's scoring average of
87.5 was a lofty goal in Tues
day's second round of the
Yamaha USC Invitational at
the Industry Hills Resort Golf
Course in Los Angeles.
"It was an ugly day," said
freshman Michele Lyford,
whose 87 was the third-lowest
score for the Cardinal.
Stanford teed off early,
which was clearly a disadvan
tage. "When we teed off it was
below 40 (degrees) and raining
real good," Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin said.
Most of the team has not
had much experience in incle

ment weather, according to
Baldwin. "I do believe we've
learned a lot and will be better
for it down the road," he said.
San Jose State's amazing
312 gave it a two-dav total of
628, which puts them 11
strokes ahead of second-place
Arizona State. Tulsa, Texas,
and U.S. International all
remained within striking dis
tance.
Unfortunately, temperatures
cannot excuse 31 strokes.
"Today none of our players
played well, but they all tried
really hard," Baldwin said.
"This course is just too severe
of a test for any level of play."
"I doubt if we'll ever come
back," added Lyford.
"It was just one of those
days," said freshman Jodi
Figley, whose team low 84
placed her in ninth place, nine
strokes back of leader Michiko
Hattori of Texas. "I can't use
the weather as an excuse."
"We all just bottomed out,"
Lyford added. "We tried to keep
everything dry when every

thing was wet."
Senior Kay Cornelius managed
an 84 as well, even though she
made two double bogeys and a
triple bogey. "You turn those
scores into bogeys and you've got
an 80," she said.
"I had no feeling for the first
10 holes," she added. "I got a
little careless on a couple holes,
and if you lose concentration for
even a second you get in trouble.

My goal for tomorrow is nothing
over a bogey."
Sophomore Stephanie Parel,
who shot 49 on the front nine
and 39 on the back nine, is looking
forward to tomorrow's final
round. "I finally got things going
on the back and hopefully can
carry them into tomorrow," she
said.
New Mexico's Michelle Wooding
moved into second individually at
152, two strokes back of Hattori.
ASU's Pearl Sinn and Dana
Lofland of SJSU are tied for
fourth at 155, and Susan Shapcott
of USIU is close behind at 156.
