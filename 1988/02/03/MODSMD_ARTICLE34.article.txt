# Women's netters hoping six is enough

### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
With his top three
players scheduled
to go to Minneap
olis and another
nursing a broken
collar bone, Stan
ford women's ten-

nis Coach Frank Brennan looked
down his list of available players
for this afternoon's match against
Pacific and found only five names.
So Brennan asked sophomore
Lisa Green to remain at Stanford
and pass up a chance to compete

this weekend in the Rolex Na
tional Indoor Intercollegiate Ten
nis Championships in Minneapo
lis.
That may be bad news for
Green, who will miss a chance to
play against the nation's best
players, but her disappointment
is probably shared by the Tigers
of Pacific, who might have had a
fighting chance had the top
ranked Cardinal only brought five
players to the Stanford Tennis
Stadium for today's 1:30 p.m.
match.
The Cardinal blanked the
Tigers 9-0 in Stockton last year

en route to capturing its second
consecutive NCAA team title, but
Brennan is entering today's
season-opening dual match with
cautious optimism. "I'm glad
we're here (playing at home),"
Brennan said. "Over there last
time they were pretty damn good.
They all had career days."
Junior Eleni Rossides and
freshman Tami Whitlinger, each
of whom has won a tournament
already this season, will not com
pete for the Cardinal today or to
morrow (against Fresno State).
Both flew into Minneapolis this

morning and are preparing for
first-round action in the Rolex
tournament tomorrow.
Junior Cindy Buchsbaum, who
broke her collar bone in a bicycle
accident a few weeks ago, will not
be available for action this week.
In the absence of Rossides and
Whitlinger, Green will play No. 1
today and freshman Sandra Birch
will occupy the No. 2 spot.
Freshman Teri Whitlinger,
senior Kay Tittle, senior Cari
Hagey and sophomore Valerie
Wilson round out today's Stan
ford lineup.
