# Spikers host Loyola in bid for first win
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
The first win is often the
sweetest of all. At the very
least, it is a way to get off the
mat in a season that, so far,
has been frustrating at best.
That's the attitude the Stan
ford men's volleyball team

needs to take into tonight's match against
league foe Loyola-Maramount. The Cardinal,
0-2 on the season, must treat every match

from here on out as a big one. The squad
cannot afford to let up mentally, especially
against the relatively weak Lions (0-2).
"Loyola will be a test for us," Stanford
Coach Fred Sturm said. "We will not take
this match lightly. We'll have to buckle down
and stay psyched through the duration of the
match.
Such an event would be a virtual first for
the struggling Cardinal. The Stanford men
have been unable to compete mentally in their
first two matches of the season, against UCLA
and UC-Santa Barbara. But those two teams

clearly outdistanced the Cardinal in more than
just the mental aspect of the game. Loyola
will not.
"This is a match we should win," Stanford
junior hitter Dave Johnson said. "If we can
just maintain a solid performance throughout,
I'm confident we can emerge with the 'W'
(win)."
Certainly, the Cardinal should. After a good
week of practice, Stanford will be in prime
shape to get their first win of the year
"We've got to have this game," sophomore
Dan Hanan said.
