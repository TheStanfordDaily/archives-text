A story in yesterday's Daily in
correctly quoted Classics and
Comparative Literature Prof.
Gregson Davis as saying that crit
ics of the proposed CUS Area One
reform legislation have not "read
the letter effectively." Davis in
stead said that the critics have
not read the CUS plan carefully.
A second story in yesterday's
Daily identified the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center as a
co-sponsor of Black Liberation
Month. The Black Community
Services Center is the co-sponsor.
