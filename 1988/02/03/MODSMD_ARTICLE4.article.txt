## Editor to speak at graduation 
### Sean Kinch Staff writer 
Newspaper editor and television
commentator Robert Maynard
will deliver the keynote address
at Stanford's commencement
ceremonies June 12, the Univer
sity announced yesterday.
"This is obviously one of the
greatest honors of my life,"
Maynard said last night.
University President Donald
Kennedy He received the invita
tion over the phone Monday from
and accepted immediately.
Maynard, who is the editor and
president of the Tribune in Oak
land, writes a nationally synd
icated column and appears peri
odically on "This Week with David
Brinkley" and the "MacNeil/Leh
rer News Hour." He last spoke
here during the Cornerstone
ceremonies last May.
Though he has only begun his
preparation for the address,
Maynard said his speech will "un
doubtedly have a great deal to do
with education," a topic on which
he has based many of his columns
and speeches.
A selection panel comprised of
students, faculty and administra
tive staff drew up a list of six
names of possible speakers and
submitted it to Kennedy last No
vember. Kennedy chose Maynard
from the list and made the final
arrangements.
The other names on the list
will not be released, panel mem
bers said.
Prof. Norman Wessells, dean of
Humanities and Sciences and a
panel member, called Maynard
"extremely intelligent" and "a
person of great substance." Wes
sels emphasized that the renown
of the candidates "was not an is
sue," the panel was only con
cerned with "the excellence of the
person."
Stacey Estrella and Ed Goines,
the senior class presidents who
were on the selection panel, said
they were pleased that Maynard
was chosen to speak. Both said
Maynard was "one of the top
choices."
According to Estrella, Maynard
will appeal to students because
he is still "building his career . . .
His struggle (to succeed) is still
very fresh." Maynard will provide
"a good message for students who
are about to embark on their own
careers," she said.
Maynard is not as nationally

prominent as commencement
speakers of recent years, includ
ing former Speaker of the House
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill and New
York Governor Mario Cuomo. But
Goines said, "We should be
looking for a lot from him in the
future."
"He is really a rising star,"
Estrella concurred. "We should be
honored (to) get him while he's
flourishing."

Maynard's status as a role
model for black students was con
sidered by the panel, Wessells
said, but it was not the deciding
factor.
A strong proponent of quality
public education, Maynard
criticized Secretary of Education
William Bennett in his Jan. 3
column for not providing ade
quate leadership in creating "a
comprehensive agenda for public
education."
Maynard, a 1966 Harvard
Nieman fellow, worked on the ed
itorial board of the Washington
Post before he became the first
black editor and publisher of a
major metropolitan daily newspa
per. He bought the Tribune in
1983 and continues to hold
majority interest in the paper.
Along with his wife Nancy
Hicks Maynard, who graduated
from Stanford Law School last
year, he founded the Institute for
Journalism Education at Colum
bia University in 1977 to train
minority journalists. The institute
is now located at UC-Berkeley.
Maynard grew up in Bedford-
Stuyvesant, N.Y. He was the
youngest of six children of immi

grants from Barbados. He
dropped out of high school to
pursue writing and moved to
Greenwich Village, where he met
writers such as James Baldwin

and Langston Hughes.
Maynard never went on to
receive any academic degrees, al
though he holds three honorary
degrees from different colleges.
"When I began at age 16 to
become a journalist, it was not a
calling that cared very much
about college degrees," he wrote
in a 1972 column criticizing white

editors for not fairly judging the
qualifications of minority candi
dates for new jobs.
Maynard's committment to the
Bay Area has extended over 20
years, from his time as a corre
spondent with the Washington
Post to his current position with
the Tribune.
