# ASSU straw poll
## Students split on W. Culture 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Student opinion appears to be about evenly split
on whether or not the Faculty Senate should ap
prove proposed reforms in the University's Western
Culture program, according to the results of an
ASSU straw poll released yesterday.
Of students polled, 52 percent expressed support
for the Committee on Undergraduate Studies' pro
posal, which would scrap the present core list of
readings and establish a new requirement titled
"Cultures, Ideas and Values." However, when asked
how they felt about the current Western Culture
program's core reading list, 65 percent said they
favor it.
Based on the comments received by the pollsters,
straw poll coordinator Patty Marby said one reason
the results appear to be contradictory is that "people
favored the [CUS] proposal in that they favored
changes, but they thought it a bit extreme and
wanted to keep the core list."
The current debate over the future of the Western

Culture program has become focused on the fate
of the core list of required readings. The future of
the core list was highlighted last month by a pro
posal authored by English Prof. William Chace de
signed to counter the CUS plan.
Chace's proposal, signed by 25 professors, calls
for retention of the core list but "requires that the
core list include readings by women and persons of
color," he said.
While Chace said he was uncertain how the results
of the student poll should be interpreted, he added
"that a 65-percent figure is a pretty strong one."
Classics and Comparative Literature Prof. Greg
son Davis, one of three organizers of a petition
gathered in favor of the CUS proposal and signed
by 70 faculty members, said he believed the results
indicated there might be some confusion in students'
minds about the specifics of the proposal.
Anthropology Prof. Renato Rosaldo, one of Davis'
co-organizers, downplayed the importance of polls
