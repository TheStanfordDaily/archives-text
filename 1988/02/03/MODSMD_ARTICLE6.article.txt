# Lawyer assails private clubs
## S.F. official seeks non-discriminatory membership rules 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
Fresh from leading a legal as
sault on San Francisco's exclusive
Olympic Club, San Francisco city
attorney Louise Renno told a
campus audience last night it is
high time private clubs recognize
the ir\justice of excluding women
and minorities from membership.
Although Renne said she recog
nizes the "constitutional right of
association" that has traditionally
allowed private clubs to choose
members selectively, she argued
that "at some point this right ends
and the law against discrimina
tion takes effect."
Speaking in Branner, Renne
discussed her own involvement in
the continuing and well

publicized case against San Fran
cisco's Olympic Club, whose
bylaws, Renne claims, exclude
women and blacks.
According to Renne, the city of
San Francisco chose to prosecute
the club after it discovered that
three holes of the club's golf
course are located on city-owned
property. She said it was "pretty
clear" to her that a club located
on public property could not
legally exclude women and
minorities from membership.
Renne recounted that when she
approached the board of the club,
"they were agreeable" to a settle
ment eliminating the exclusive
bylaws. The club's members, how
ever, voted down the settlement
and are now "spending a tremen
dous amount of money fighting

this case," she said. The suit is
currently under appeal.
She said that while the case
against the Olympic Club was "ob
vious," most such cases are not
so clear. She explained that
private clubs in San Francisco
must be found to violate one of
two laws in order to qualify as
discrimination cases.
The first law Renne cited is the
Unruh Civil Rights Act, which
prohibits discrimination in the
marketplace. Under this Califor
nia law, clubs involved in business
transactions are forbidden to dis
criminate by sex or race.
The second law Renne cited was
a recently passed San Francisco
city ordinance that prohibits
private clubs of over 400 members
that regularly serve meals or
receive money from non-members
from excluding women or
minorities as members.
This city law covers eight large
San Francisco clubs, including the
Bohemian Club, which has filed
a lawsuit against the ordinance,
Renne said.
The Bohemian Club came un
der fire at Stanford this fall after
it was discovered that the Uni
versity partially reimburses fac
ulty members for dues paid to the
club. The Bohemian Club has
been charged with discriminatory
practices against women and
minorities.
According to Renne, "for a club
[such as the Olympic] to have dis
criminated for so long is unex
cusable. ... If it doesn't change,
it's just plnin stupid."
Renne argued that "even for
crass commercial reasons, clubs
should stop discrimination." She
cited the example of visiting busi
nessmen from other countries
who might be barred from certain
private clubs in San Francisco;
this could hurt the "international
economy which is important" to
Bay Area businesses, she said.
Although she said she has

received a large amount of hate
mail concerning the Olympic Club
lawsuit, Renne told the audience
"any time a public official takes
on a controversial cause, they will
antagonize people."
Of her decision to prosecute the
Olympic Club, Renne said , "I
think my obligation under the law
is clear, no matter what people

have to say about it."
Renne added that "feelings run
high on both side of this issue
(private club membership)." She
said she thinks in some cases
people are just prejudiced, while
in others the "philosophy of the
right of association" prompts
private club members to defend
their exclusivity.
