Gephardt leads — Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri has surged
to the front of the pack of Demo
cratic presidential contenders in
Monday's lowa caucuses, while
former front-runner Gary Hart has
fallen to fourth place, according
to a Gallup Poll released yester
day. Page 2
Ho-hum — The Stanford men's
tennis team easily defeated the
San Jose State Spartans yester
day, winning 5-2 in San Jose. Even
a loss by Jeff Tarango and the
unavailability of Patrick McEnroe,
Barry Richards and David
Wheaton wasn't enough to stop
the No. 1-ranked Cardinal against
the Spartans Page 7
Explosion — Breaking out of its
hitting drought in a big way, the
baseball team thumped the UC-
Davis Aggies 13-8 at Sunken Dia
mond. The Cardinal rocked Aggie
pitchers for 14 hits, and the game
was all but over after a seven-run
second-inning highlighted by Ed
Sprague's first home run of the
season. Page 7
