# Athletes blast NCAA drug testing
## Hill, McKeever visit Adams 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
Calling the NCAA drug-testing program
of college athletes a "Big Brother" activity,
senior Jennifer Hill blasted the NCAA's
drug-testing program at Adams House last
night.
Hill, a soccer player, and junior Barry
McKeever, a football player, are awaiting a
final decision on their historic drug-testing
suit against the National Collegiate Athletic
Association.
The two athletes expect Santa Clara
County Superior Judge Conrad Rushing to
uphold his preliminary ruling that severely
restricts the NCAA's mandatory testing pro
gram "within the next couple of weeks,"
McKeever said.
Hill and McKeever filed suit against the
program on the grounds that such testing
was an invasion of their right to privacy
guaranteed by the California Constitution.
McKeever said that being drug tested was
like letting officials "look into your body to
find out what you've done. It's like allowing
them to search your dorm room for mari
juana or steroids with no probable cause."
Hill compared the testing to "Big Brother"
and stressed that "drug testing assumes the
athlete is guilty. There is no program for
education before or after the fact. If you
test positive you're out. There's something
wrong with that."
Rushing issued an injunction Nov. 19 ban
ning testing of athletes in all 26 Stanford
varsity sports except football and men's bas
ketball. In a second injunction issued two
weeks later, he stipulated that football and
men's basketball players could only be tested
for four substances — steroids, cocaine,
heroine and amphetamines — out of an
original list of over 3,000.
McKeever was tested prior to the 1987
Gator Bowl under NCAA provisions that
mandate that athletes submit urine samples
for testing prior to post-season competition.
McKeever recounted in great detail the
lack of privacy during the testing and his
fear that he had accidentally eaten or taken
one of the numerous substances banned by

the NCAA.
"I had to wait in line and drink fluid for
about 40 minutes before a trainer led me
into a room with four NCAA people who
asked me if I had taken any drugs,"
McKeevcr said. "I told them that I had
taken something about two weeks
beforehand for nausea. They gave me a
beaker and told me that they need 100
milliliters.
"They told me to keep my hands out of
my pockets and not to stick my fingers in
it. The NCAA mandates that an official
stand five feet behind you and only two
athletes can be tested at a time so they can
assure proper supervision," he continued.
"They told me to pour it into two vials and
lock them in a case. After about two hours
I finally got to leave and had to face a bunch
of cameras and reporters.
"The test covered everything from steroids

to childrens' Co-Tylenol. Who knows what
I ate or took?" he said.
Although McKeever's complaints about
the lack of privacy during testing and that
the list of illegal substances was much too
long were addresed by the preliminary
ruling, McKeever has not ruled out an ap
peal of the decision with hopes that a total
ban would be extended to the remaining
two sports.
An appeal could mean at best an extension
to the other two sports, but the same appeal
would also risk a complete reversal of the
decision to halt testing in the other 24
sports.
The NCAA has also indicated that it may
seek an appeal-to prevent the Stanford case
from setting a precedent that could elimi-

nate drug testing of college ath
letes across the nation.
McKeever attributed Rushing's
refusal to extend the ban to foot
ball and men's basketball to the
judge's belief that those sports
had previously shown a high in
cidence of drug use. The judge
ruled that steroids were only use
ful as a performance enhancer for
football because of the strength
required and therefore should be
controlled in that sport.

His decision not to extend the
ban to basketball may have been
based on the boasting of Villanova
player Gary McLain who claimed
that he had played in the NCAA
Final Four on drugs and "that it
felt great."
Hill's involvement dates back
to March 1987 when she joined
in the fight against mandatory
testing started by diver Simone
LeVant in October 1986. "I
wanted to keep the movement
going after Simone graduated. It
was something I believed in
strongly."
McKeever and Stanford joined
the suit that summer.

"I was opposed to the guilty
until proven innocent approach.
If you can show you're clean,
you're innocent; until then, you're
guilty," McKeever said.
Hill attributes Stanford's in
volvement to a number of factors.
"If I was declared ineligible in the
event that the soccer team made
the NCAA finals, the whole team
would be declared ineligible be
cause I played during the regular
season. Things were also looking
good for us winning, and Stanford
had been opposed to drug testing
from the beginning."
McKeever added that if the ath
letes won the suit "it would make
the University look good."
