North, Noriega link alleged
WASHINGTON — Panamanian leader Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega and Lt. Col. Oliver
North planned secretly in 1985 to train
Nicaraguan rebels in Panama, according to
Jose Blandon, a former top Noriega aide who
is now under 24-hour guard by the U.S. Mar
shals Service as a witness in federal drug and
corruption investigations of Noriega.
Blandon alleged that the training of between
200 and 250 Contras took place from July
1985 to May 1986. Several knowledgeable mil
itary and other U.S. officials expressed skep
ticism this week that the plan was ever carried
out, but a well-placed government official said
Wednesday there is intelligence information
to support Blandon's report that Panama
trained Contra fighters.
Blandon alleged in interviews over the last
week that in return for the secret Contra
training, North agreed that he would try to
get the U.S. government to assist Panama
with its debt crisis in late 1985.
Violence escalates in Israel
JERUSALEM — Unrest in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip entered its ninth
straight week yesterday as at least six Pales
tinians were wounded by gunfire during vio
lent clashes with Israeli troops and a 24-year
old Arab woman died of a gunshot wound in
the head sustained Monday.
The woman was at least the 39th Palestinian
to be killed by Israeli gunfire since the trouble
began Dec. 9. The United Nations and Pales
tinian sources put the death toll at up to 42,
and hundreds have been wounded.
Military sources said the unrest appeared
to have moved more toward towns and villages
in the southern part of the West Bank yes
terday after several days in which the most
violent clashes were in the north. Also, the
sources reported increasing friction between
the 800,000 Palestinians in the area and about
60,000 Jewish settlers on the West Bank.
SEC chair requests more power
WASHINGTON — Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman David Ruder yesterday
asked Congress to transform the agency into
a regulatory superpower by vastly expanding
its authority over the nation's stock, options
and futures markets.
The SEC proposal, unveiled at the Senate
Banking Committee's second day of hearings
on the October stock market collapse, would
give the agency authority to halt temporarily
or shut down trading in stock and options
markets during emergencies emergencies. Un
der current regulation, the power to suspend
trading in both of these markets is vested only
in the president.
