# House strikes down Contra aid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The House,
striking what could be a mortal blow
against the centerpiece of the Reagan
administration's Central American
policy, yesterday night narrowly
rejected the president's request to pro
vide $36.2 million in new aid to the
rebels fighting Nicaragua's Marxist
government.
The 219-to-211 vote killing Presi
dent Reagan's aid package to the Con
tras came at the end of a divisive
10-hour debate and a furious lobbying
campaign in recent weeks that in
cluded an llth-hour concession to
Congress by the president. At the end,
164 of the Houses' 257 Democrats,
and 12 of its 177 Republicans joined
in voting against the president.
Defeat of the package, which in
cluded $3.6 million in lethal assistance,
means that for the remainder of
Reagan's term the White House will
not be guaranteed another congres
sional vote on the issue that has
dominated its Central American
agenda. However, the administration
still can seek additional aid through
the regular appropriations process —
a route that is more easilv blocked by

the Democrat-controlled Congress, but
one that the White House will almost
certainly try.
However, the House leadership has
said it will propose its own package
of purely humanitarian assistance for
the Contras so they will not be totally
abandoned. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater called it "little more
than a refugee plan." Another White
House official said the president will
"do whatever he can" to help that
package, even though he considers it
"woefully insufficient."
In killing the president's request,
the House rejected Reagan's argu
ments that the Contras are the United
States' best bulwark against commu
nist expansion in Central America and
that continued financial support is ne
cessary to make the Sandinista gov
ernment adhere to the Central Amer
ican peace process that began last sum
mer.
Instead, the House accepted the
views of the Democratic leadership
that a new round of aid would upset
the delicate process of achieving peace
in the region by encouraging
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega

to abandon his commitment to
democratization and the recently
begun cease-fire talks with the Con
tras.
The closeness of yesterday night's
vote reflected the high political stakes
of an election year, the delicate stage
of the six-month-old Central American
peace process and the deep divisions
caused by the most contentious foreign
policy issue of the Reagan presidency.
Both sides billed the vote as a show
down that could end the ad
ministration's seven-year effort to
topple Nicaragua's government by
supporting and arming the Contras —
a policy that Congress has backed with
more than $200 million in direct aid.
Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., who
led the floor fight for the package,
called it "a very serious defeat" for
the president's policy in Central
America, one that would be very dif
ficult to reverse.
Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said
"this is a big vote in the path toward
lame-duckism. It effectively is the end
of the president's policy."
Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-
Calif., said, "Tonight's vote is not a

defeat for the President but a victory
for peace. ... It is the end of the
Reagan doctrine but also a begin
ning. . . . Although the president's
Contra policy is dead, America's in
volvement in Central America remains
active, engaged and involved."
The House began debating Reagan's
request at 10:30 a.m., 14 hours after
the president broadcast an appeal for
his package that included an induce
ment designed to sway some of the
few undecided members. In agreeing
shortly before his speech to give
Congress an final chance to block le
thal aid, Reagan bowed to pressure
from House Republican leaders and
former Virginia governor Charles
Robb, a Democrat, who argued the
concession was necessary to give the
package a chance.
Of the $32.6 million of nonlethal
aid in Reagan's $36.2 million request,
$7.2 million would be for humanitar
ian aid in the form of food, medicine,
shelter and clothing. The balance
would be "non-lethal" aid that could
include items that could be used in
fighting such as jeeps.
