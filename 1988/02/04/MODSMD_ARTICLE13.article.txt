# Meese insists he is innocent
## Secret memo cites possible payoff 
### 
WASHINGTON - The key
portion of a classified memo that
is the prime focus of an indepen
dent counsel's investigation — 10
words that Attorney General Ed
win Meese 111 insists imply no
wrongdoing — refers directly to
a possible financial payment or
contribution by a Swiss business
man to an Israeli political party,
sources familiar with the inquiry
said yesterday.
This description of the crucial
part of the memo, which other
sources said involves Swiss oilman
Bruce Rappaport and then-Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres'
Labor Party, raises questions
about the attorney general's
statement Monday that he does
"not believe that it fairly implies
a violation of the law was com
mitted or contemplated."
Nathan Lewin, Meese's lawyer,
contends that the memo, written
by longtime Meese friend E.
Robert Wallach about a proposed
$ 1 -billion pipeline deal in Iraq,
does not constitute any illegality,
sources said. Lewin's reported
stand is based partly on the fact
that Rappaport, as a Swiss citizen,

would not be covered by the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
But other attorneys, not in
volved in the case but experienced
with the 1977 act, disputed
Lewin's arguments, saying that
the law could well cover the ac
tivity outlined in the memo. The
federal law prohibits U.S. citizens
from bribing foreign officials and
specifically stipulates that the at
torney general may take legal ac
tion to stop a violation if it ap
pears that one is about to occur.
Sources did not disclose the ex
act wording of the memo's pivotal
10 words, which Meese said "have
given rise to this speculation'
about an alleged bribery plan. Nor
could it be learned whether the
payment in question had already
been made or was being proposed.
Supporters of the proposed
Iraqi pipeline wanted guarantees
by Israel that it would not oppose
the project or launch a military
attack against it. Payments or
contributions to Peres' party are
believed to have been considered
as an incentive for cooperation by
Israel, long an enemy of Iraq.
