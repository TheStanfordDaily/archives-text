# Court bars surrogate motherhood contracts
## 
### 
TRENTON, N.J. â€” The New Jersey
Supreme Court ruled yesterday in the
landmark custody case of Baby M that
contracts paying a woman to give birth
to a child amount to illegal baby selling.
But, in a unanimous 7-0 decision, the
court awarded custody of the toddler to
her father and gave visitation rights to
the child's biological mother, Mary Beth
Whitehead Gould, who bore the infant
under contract.
The justices reversed all but the cus
tody portion of a lower trial court deci
sion, and ordered another lower court
judge to determine what Whitehead
Gould's visitation rights would be.
"We invalidate the surrogacy contract
because it conflicts with the law and
public policy of this state," New Jersey's
highest court said. "While we recognize
the depth of the yearning of infertile
couples to have their own children, we
find the payment of money to a 'sur
rogate' mother illegal, perhaps criminal,
and potentially degrading to women."
The court, however, found no illegality
in allowing women voluntarily and with
out payment to act as surrogate mot
hers, provided they are not subject to
binding agreements to surrender their
children.
The decision affects surrogacy agree

ments only in New Jersey, but could
apply as a guideline for some other
states. At least 27 state legislatures are
considering bills outlining the limits of
surrogate parenting because of the Baby
M case. However, none has passed so far.
Lawyers for William and Elizabeth
Stern, the couple who hired Whitehead
Gould as a surrogate mother for the
child, described their clients as
"surprised, confused and elated" by the
decision. They said that the Sterns
would not appeal because they do not
consider themselves crusaders for
legalized surrogacy and always consid
ered custody the issue.
But attorney Gary Skoloff said that
the Sterns would fight to limit
Whitehead Gould's visitation rights to
"give this child some kind of security
and privacy."
"The Sterns' primary goal was to end
the publicity," he added. "Now there is
going to have to be a hearing on the
visitation rights and there will be more
publicity."
Speaking to a news conference with
with tears in her eyes, Whitehead Gould
said, "I'm glad that the months of un
certainty are over. I did not begin this
as a public crusade.
