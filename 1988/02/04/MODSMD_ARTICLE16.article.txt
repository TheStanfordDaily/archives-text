## AIDS plan useless 
### 
THE HEAVILY criticized pro
posal to conduct AIDS tests
for every student at one
major university recently an
nounced by Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop begs one question:
What's the point?
Koop, at a world AIDS confer
ence last week, said the goal of the
test is to gather representative
data on the spread of the acquired
immune deficiency syndrome
among young adults in an urban
setting. However, many dis
crepencies and amibiguities can
and will arise with this type of
study — and such inconclusive
data can often be taken as fact
and promote unnecessary anxiety.
For example, Koop did not
specify whether the tests would be
mandatory or voluntary, but
Daniel Bao, director of the Stan
ford AIDS Education Project, said
"it is difficult to believe he could
ask for mandatory testing." If the
test is voluntary, as is likely, most
students who do not believe it ne
cessary to be tested will opt out
of taking the test, thereby skewing
the accuracy of the findings in fa
vor of positive test results.
In addition, the accuracy of the
test itself is questionable. If a stu
dent tests positive for the AIDS
virus, this does not mean he or
she has the disease. And if he or
she does test positive, will the stu
dent be told? Already the study
seems as if it will do more harm
than good.
The location of the study is an
other problem. Koop said a uni
versity has not yet been chosen,
but would probably be one in a
large city with a student body of
around 25,000. Yet, test findings
of a university in a large city in
Texas will probably have different
results than if the study is done
in San Francisco or New York. The
results, no matter where they are
taken, will be quite limited in scope

and not be of much use to the
general population between the
ages of 18 and 24. This study can
either increase unnecessary anx
iety or further encourage the ill
founded notion that the average
college student is invinceable and
has a special immunity to the AIDS
virus.
The cost of Koop's proposed
study must also be called into ques
tion. According to Bao, the
cheapest AIDS test would cost $30
per student, in addition to the cost
of counseling before and after the
test. Thirty dollars multiplied by
about 25,000 students is a lot of
money that could be used in a
more effective manner to combat
the AIDS virus. "We need that
money to go toward AIDS
education," Bao said, for example.
If this study is, in fact, being done
partially for educational purposes,
there are many more constructive
ways to achieve a more well
informed population.
At Stanford, for example, Resi
dential Education has done a good
job so far in increasing student
awareness and education of the
AIDS virus. Resident assistants
have disseminated AIDS informa
tion via bullitin boards and dorm
meetings, and Res Ed has held a
series of speakers on AIDS at
dorms throughout campus. Res Ed
estimated over 200 students
showed up for one speech on AIDS
in Roble Hall alone last quarter.
Res Ed also has a series of
videotapes on both the biological
and social aspects of the virus.
Koop has generally been a prag
matic leader in the battle against
AIDS, but this is a poor plan that
will only lead to inaccurate, incon
clusive results. If Koop is willing
to spend that kind of money on
an AIDS study — great. But please
put it towards a project that will
help and not hurt the AIDS battle.
