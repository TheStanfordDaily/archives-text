## Sexism, date rape intrinsic to housed fraternities 
### 
I AM WRITING IN response to the
Jan. 29 letter in The Daily by Will
Wall and Rob Bentley, president
and resident assistant respectively, of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon. I find their
refutation of Joe Metcalfe's Daily
article on rape sickly inaccurate. I
want to ask several profound and
incredibly germane questions to
readers who thought that The Daily
article was, in the words of Wall and
Bentley, "misleading . . . and seriously
distorted against fraternities."
First, what does it mean that all
three rapes illustrated in the article
occurred in fraternities? Wall and
Bentley seem affronted that Metcalfe
decided to document three rapes that
occurred in fraternities; that somehow
Metcalfe consciously singled out frater

nities to promulgate, in their words,
"The Daily's traditional anti-fraternity
stance."
The fact is that Metcalfe went ask
ing questions, and what he found were
rapes which occurred in fraternities.
Wall and Bentley feel cheated, even
though Metcalfe "cautions against
stereotyping rape situations," and
states in the article that the rapist is
"often a remote acquaintance, someone
who lives down the hall, or a
boyfriend." On the contrary, I believe
that Metcalfe does not launch an
unjust invective. Rather, he actually
gives fraternities a benefit of the doubt
that they don't deserve.
Why do rapes occur in fraternities?
Unfortunately, I have had significant
experience living in all-male environ-

ments for extended periods of time.
Invariably in this situation, extreme
sexist attitudes are generated and
accentuated by the mass, but rarely
challenged by the few who may dis
agree.
Women are continually lowered to
sexual objects. It is admirable to
"score," and in more ribald terms, to
conquer. Housed fraternities are obvi
ously an all-male living situation and
may even take further to the extreme
the sexism with which I have all too
often been inundated.
Third, how genuine are fraternities,
in the words of Wall and Bentley,
"hoping to educate and sensitize"
themselves to the reality of rape in
their houses, incurred by their mem
bers? Does the SAE house sincerely

"recognize, as do many other houses,
that date rape is a serious and all too
common occurrence?" I doubt it.
The fact that the three rapes il
lustrated in The Daily occurred in
fraternities, by fraternity members, is
unequivocal, cogent and utterly obscene
evidence that acquaintance rape is a
fraternal problem.
As long as fraternities exist in their
present form, frat brothers will con
tinue to hear of, and see, the sexual
conquests of their housemates. Some
times these include rape. How many
cases will it take for something drastic
to be done? Isn't simply one rape
enough?
