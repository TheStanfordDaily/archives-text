# Area One proposal addresses diversity
## 
### 
We have a community that is in
creasingly polarizing as modest changes
are made to appreciate the diversity of
the student, faculty and administrative
bodies. The Culture, Ideas and Values
proposal makes room for innovative
and new approaches to the humanities
into the Area One requirement.
It does not mandate the ousting of
Plato or Homer fron. the curriculum;
conversely it does allow for a compara
tive study of the Haitian and French
Revolutions.
The proposal's authors and the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
agreed that mandating the study of
certain texts was not in the interest of
the program or the student body.
Among other reasons, these committees
found that the core list puts implicit
value of one book or group over an-

other; that a number of faculty teach
ing Western Culture finds the list
restrictive and new track proposals
could not accommodate the core list;
and that no other course in the Uni
versity's curriculum has legislated
content and that has not served to
degrade Stanford's undergraduate
program.
Yet the "impoverishment" of under
graduate education is exactly the
prediction of English Prof. William
Chace because the common intellectual
experience will be lost. He has instead,
in what would seem to be only a few
weeks, written an alternative proposal
that calls for the incorporation of
women and people of color into the
core list. There are some critical prob
lems with this proposal.
First, it assumes that one only gets
a common intellectual experience
through reading the same texts. This
is not true. Surveys conducted last
year found that there was minimal
cross track discussion between students

in various Western Culture tracks
except for the Alternative View course
taught by Prof. Clay Carson. A com
mon experience is forged when stu
dents discuss and share ideas with
each other whether or not they read
the same texts.
Second, Chace's alternative is im
practical. Who will determine which
texts by people of color and women
should be incorporated? Will they be
given equal time with texts by white
men? Such a core list would only lead
to overloading already taxed freshmen
or to tokenism. Adding more texts on
a level that is equal to that of white
male authors makes a course load
unwieldy for even the most diligent
student, let alone for one adjusting to
a new environment.
Even worse, if we only include a
token number of texts by women and
people of color, the requirement will be
very clearly stating that this group has
only played a peripheral or minor role

in the development of our society. The
Daily has called for a 20 percent rate
of inclusion which translates into one
text on the list per quarter. Will that
text be by a woman or a person of
color? And which color? Considering
that the m*y'ority of people in this
country and on this planet are female,
and that the majority of people in this
world and a rapidly increasing portion
of America are people of color, this is
not only arbitrary but out of sync with
social realities.
Contrary to Alan Bloom, we are not
marching back into the late '60s but
into the 21st century and, given the
dangers and kaleidoscope of peoples
with whom we must negotiate, our
education must evolve to reflect this
new reality. As Martin Luther King,
Jr. said, "We must learn to live to
gether as brothers or perish together
as fools." Let us give CIV a chance.
