## Coasts through with 97-0 vote 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer With wire reports 
The Senate swiftly and unani
mously confirmed Anthony Ken
nedy to the Supreme Court yes
terday, ending a ferocious political
battle that began seven months
ago.
Kennedy, a federal appeals
court judge who was President
Reagan's third choice to succeed
retired Justice Lewis Powell, was
approved by a vote of 97-0, with
Democrats and Republicans alike
praising him as a moderate, open
minded conservative.
Kennedy, Â»vho has been on the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for 12 years, will be sworn in Feb.
18 in the Supreme Court cham
bers in Washington. On the Court
he will join two other Stanford
alumni, Chief Justice William
Rehnquist and Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor, both graduates of
the Law School Class of '52. Ken
nedy graduated from Stanford
with a bachelor's in political sci
ence in 1958.
President Reagan said in a
statement he is "extremely
pleased" and declared Kennedy
"will make an outstanding addi
tion to the Supreme Court. . . .
The Senate has not only restored
to the nation a full nine-member
Supreme Court, it has reaffirmed
this country's commitment to the
philosophy of judicial restraint."
At a news conference at the
McGeorge School of Law in
Sacramento, where he has taught
constitutional law since 1965,
Kennedy had nothing but praise
for the Senate's confirmation
process.
"It attests to the strength of
the constitutional system that,
though there may be divergences
or differences or unresolved ques
tions with reference to the inter
pretation of the Constitution,
there is nonetheless a commit
ment by the members of the Sen

ate and the president and the
courts to the constitutional
process," he said.
Kennedy said the confirmation
process made him better under
stand the Constitution. "I came
away from that process with a
better, a clearer, a surer, a deeper
understanding of the system of
checks and balances."

Stanford students Kristin and
Greg Kennedy, two of Kennedy's
children, "couldn't be more
proud" of their father. "He's
worked very hard on the law all
his life and this is his reward,"
Greg said. The two will be trave
ling to Sacramento and Washing
ton for receptions and the
swearing-in ceremony .
The Kennedy confirmation,
after a pro forma one hour debate,
was in marked contrast to the
stormy fight touched off by the
nomination last July of Robert
Bork.
Bork, Reagan's first choice to
fill the vacancy created by Pow
ell's June 26 retirement, was
denounced as a rigid right-wing

Kennedy was extolled Wednes

the mainstream of constitutional

interpretation."
Kennedy is expected to play a
pivotal role on the sharply divided
court, particularly on such issues
as abortion, affirmative action
and separation of church and
state.

avoided tipping his hand on how
he would rule on many contro
