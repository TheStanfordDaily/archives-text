## Pre-med outlook gray 
### 
AT SOME TIME in your life you
will or already may have thought
about becoming a doctor. Remem
ber, that's what your mother always
wanted. But before you buy your stethe
scope, think about this: To become a
medicine man or woman in this day and
age, a student has to suffer through 15
grueling years of training, memorize
thousands of life-saving facts, attend 10
million hours of monotonous lecturing,
and on top of it all compete with fellow
blood-sucking "pre-meds" while living on
junk food and two hours of sleep a night.
There's anxiety and worry, constant
preparation, taking notes, studying notes,
exams out your ears and cold cadavers
to dissect. Nonetheless, misery eventually
gives way to brilliance, prestige and won
derful monetary compensation. What
more could a mother ask for, right?
Before you send your unsuspecting
chiid out into the world of blood and
guts, think of the upcoming American
health care revolution. Think of all those
years of moral upbringing that will be
unwound by the so-called "doctor's eco
nomic upside-down cake" and perverse
incentive structures.
As Joseph Califano says in his book,
America's Health Care Revolution, "For
most doctors, the bucks are in treatment
of disease, not in its prevention or health
promotion. The economic self-interest of
doctors is served by performing medical
services: running batteries of tests to
avoid malpractice suits; identifying il
lnesses to be cured; conducting consulta
tions with other physicians. . . Unless
doctors find things to do to us, most of

them don't get paid."
The result of these twisted economic
incentives has been an explosion of un
necessary medical services and sky
rocketing cost increases. High costs in
the medical industry are related to in
creases in demand for medical services
created by third party insurances and
government insurances, the soaring costs
of medical malpractice insurance, in
creases in defensive medicine and restric
tions on the supply of physicians.
Today the supply of physicians is
growing at rates that are inefficient and
costly. In 1985, there were 218 doctors
for each 100,000 people. It is estimated
that we only need 188. In the year 2000,
there will be 630,000 doctors in America
â€” 130,000 more than we will need.
We would expect this oversupply of
physicians to lower the price of health
care. But the AMA forgot one thing.
In the current system, the doctor tells
the patient what treatment and how
much of it he needs. It is a bit late in
the game to realize that more doctors
does not mean lower prices.
More doctors is definitely a step in the
wrong direction, especially considering
the new dimensions of practicing
medicine. With more and more Health
Maintenance Organizations appearing,
the need for doctors is decreasing. None
theless, medical schools continue to grad
uate growing numbers of doctors, many
of whom are specialists who charge al
most 10 times more than normal prac
titioners.
The extra supply of doctors should
mean that undersupplied rural areas are

adequately provided for, but this is not
the case. Doctors and specialists are
gravitating towards urban areas where
their fees are higher and as a result,
rural areas lack even basic primary care
providers.
The answer to our health care worries
is not easily apparent, but the first step
in the health care revolution is to change
the way that doctors are being paid. We
must let the traditional forces of the
market work to reduce fees and eventu
ally solve the problem of excessive supply.
In time perhaps medical schools will offer
classes on cost containment, and will
stress the need for geographically equal
distribution of primary care physicians.
All of this is not to say that doctors
are terrible people. They are t merely
human, responding to a peculiar incen
tive structure, and trying to give the best
possible medical care in the process. It
is time, however, to realize that medicine
is not as sacred as Marcus Welby makes
it seem. Until we can learn to change
the ways of the medicine men and wom
en, it might be a good idea to think about
sending Junior to Stanford Law School
instead of Stanford Medical School. (And
you thought your mother knew every
thing.)
