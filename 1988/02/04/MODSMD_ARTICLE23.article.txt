## Abortion technique allows for safer multiple births 
### Ingrid Wickelgren Science editor 
A doctor pushes a needle
through a woman's belly while
watching the tip on an ultrasound
display. He guides the needle to
the target — a black gestational
sack. — the capsule of water sur
rounding a 9-week-old fetus.
Potassium chloride flows through
the needle and into the fetal heart.
The heart stops. The dead fetus
is eventually absorbed by the
mother's body. But if all has gone
well, the remaining fetuses
develop nicely.

Doctors skilled in the art of
selective abortion are trying to
sculpt a more perfect pregnancy.
But while whittling a vital crea
tion, the doctors' needles pierced
the front page of the New York
Times in a Jan. 25 article. As the
Times made glaringly clear, nei
ther parents nor doctors of selec
tive abortions can escape the
moral dilemmas associated with
the death of an unborn child. But
what the Times did not explicitly
state was that selective abortions
can ease more ethical dilemmas
than they create.
The arguments for selective
abortion, in many cases, are com
pelling enough to make the most
avid anti-abortionist stutter. A
woman bearing three to eight
embryos is at high risk for serious
medical complications; for both
herself and, more importantly,
her unborn children. The unex
pected child-rearing prospects
facing the woman often are not

an issue.
Women pregnant with multiple
fetuses are often at high risk of
miscarriage (possibly in advanced
stages of pregnancy), or of giving
birth to premature fetuses, which
may not survive or may develop
neurological defects. Selective
abortion allows a woman to
preserve the life and health of one
or two fetuses, when previously
she may have aborted all of them.
Some women become aware in
their third month that one or
more of their fetuses is abnormal.
Without selective abortion, these
parents are faced with a dilemma:
is preserving the life of a healthy
fetus worth the emotional and fi
nancial strain — on the entire
family — brought by a child with
severe abnormalities?
More parents are now faced
with the dilemmas created by
multiple pregnancies because
today's fertility techniques result
in a high frequency of multiple
pregnancies relative to natural
methods.
In some cases, a doctor gives
an infertile woman an ovulation
enhancing drug, which can induce
the release of more than one egg
from the ovaries. Or doctors may
have implanted several in vitro
or test tube- fertilized eggs in a
woman's uterus and several sur
vive. With the implantation of five
embryos, more than two survive
in fewer than one in 100 women.
However, this is still 50 times
higher than the natural incidence
of triplets or greater multiples.
The woman who has found her
self carrying more than she had
planned is often referred to a doc
tor who performs selective abor
tions. The equipment is in every
hospital — needles and
ultrasound machines — but the
expertise is rare.
Dr. Micki Golbus of the
Reproductive Genetics Unit of the
Department of Obstetrics and Gy
necology at the Univeristy of Cal
ifornia at San Francisco Medical
School and his assistant Dr.
James Goldberg are the only doc
tors in the Bay Area that do selec
tive abortions, also called preg

nancy reductions. Goldberg esti
mated that there are only 10 to
20 doctors in the nation that per
form such reductions.
Unlike the typical mother
seeking abortion of a single fetus,
the typical woman seeking selec
tive abo?tion wants a child, in
many cases badly enough to turn
to artificial methods. She is torn
when told that her pregnancy is
likely to be unhealthy. This is the
opposite dilemma of a woman
with a single healthy fetus who
does not want the child for emo
tional and/or economic reasons.
Although there are risks to the
mother ranging from real dangers
to terrible inconvenience, selec
tive abortions are done mainly to
save the baby. "These (women)
are willing to go through anything
to get pregnant and save all of
their fetuses," said Dr. Amin
Milki of the Stanford Medical
Center's in vitro fertilization pro
gram.
Women bearing multiple
fetuses are themselves at much
higher risk of toxemia, a disorder
characterized by high blood pres
sure and fluid retention which can
cause convulsions in the mother.
Multiple fetuses also increase the
mother's chance of obstetrical
hemorrhaging after delivery. Fur
ther, to prevent the babies from
being premature, the mother may
have to be hospitalized for weeks
or months, receiving drugs and
frequent medical tests, according
to Milki.
"Each (abortion case) is a tough
ethical decision for the couple,"
Goldberg said of the cases he has
seen. He said that the woman's
infertility history, her expecta
tions and other children are all
discussed, but the ultimate deci
sion almost always rests on a
health or survival issue.
However, one woman reduced
her presumably healthy twins to
a single fetus, according to the
New York Times.
"We don't definitely recom
mend (pregnancy reduction) in
any case. We counsel the parents
about the risk of successfully car
rying the pregnancy versus the

risk of the procedure," Goldberg
said.
In general, the greater the num
ber of fetuses, the greater the risk
of developmental problems or
death. The biggest increase in risk
occurs between twins and triplets,
according to Goldberg. Triplets
and greater multiples will very
frequently be born premature, of
ten developing neurological
defects.
Golbus fir3t began selective
abortion a number of years ago
for twins, one of which was ab
normal. In such cases, the mother
had to choose between aborting
both or accepting one abnormal
child, Golbus said. Now, the
woman can choose to give birth
to a single healthy baby. Golbus
has applied his technique to about
15 of these cases.
Golbus extended the technique

to other cases of multiple
pregancy within the last two
years. All four or five of their
selective abortions have been for
women who received in vitro
fertilized eggs.
The largest number of fetuses
in a mother treated at UCSF was
four, but other programs have had
much larger numbers, Goldberg
said. The New York Times docu
ments cases of women with six
and eight fetuses, both of whom
turned to selective abortion.
Most doctors, including Golbus,
leave the woman with twins. All
of the UCSF pregnancy reduc
tions have been successful, Golbus
said. Indeed, Milki is not aware
of any reported cases in which a
doctor performing reduction has
lost all of the fetuses.
However, it is hard to get reli
able data about the success rate

of the technique, because, as Milki
pointed out, doctors are not likely
to report cases that failed. Fur
ther, the technique has not been
performed enough times for there
to be reliable statistics on success
rates.
The technique is delicate be
cause the fetuses are small — as
small as one and a half inches
long — and the doctor must target
only certain ones.
There is also a risk that the
process, like any other that pokes
around in the uterus, will induce
premature contractions and result
in the loss of all of the fetuses,
according to Milki.
Although pregnancy reduction
is delicate, the doctors who do it,
including Golbus, learned it on


their own without ever seeing
it done.
"The technique was an ex
tension of a whole range of fe
tal therapeutic techniques"
familiar to the UCSF doctors,
Goldberg said.
Doctors at Stanford do not
perform pregnancy reductions
and do not plan to start such
a service. Because of the risk
involved, it is better for a su
perspecialist — like Golbus —
to do it, Milki said.
Stanford doctors have never
referred any patient to a doctor
for selective abortions, but if
they were to do so they would
refer her to Golbus, he said.
The first pregnancy reduc
tions were performed in 1983
and 1984 by Dr. Yves Dumez
in Paris and a Dr. Rodesch in
Belgium.
So, the ethics of single fetus
abortion is no longer the
newest debate about how much
control humans should have
over the fate of potential new
life. But neither is it the oldest.
In 1916, when Margaret
Sanger founded the first U.S.
birth control clinic in Brooklyn,
she was arrested and jailed. At
that time, the popular moral
consensus in America dictated
that humans were not even al
lowed control over their own
gametes — eggs and sperm.
Most Americans now not
only condone but openly sup
port the use of birth control
to prevent the conception of an
unwanted child. But abortion
is a harder "pill" to swallow
because after the sperm and

egg have combined, many jus
tifiably believe that life has
begun.
Anti-abortionists believe
that an egg, once fertilized,
deserves a kind of "self
determination," freedom to

carry out its genetic program,
no matter what the desires of
the more developed being that
conceived it. However, when
those "desires" include real
threats to the life of the
siblings and the mother of that
self-determined fetus, a person
still against termination for
any reason begins to represent
an extreme viewpoint.
Thus, the moral-ethical
dilemmas created by multiple
abortion cases make it harder
to defend blanket statements
about the immorality of abor
tion.
But at the very least, "pro
choice" supporters should be
glad Americans are debating
abortion and not birth control.

or test tube- fertilized eggs in a
woman's uterus and several sur
vive. With the implantation of five
embryos, more than two survive
in fewer than one in 100 women.
However, this is still 50 times
higher than the natural incidence
of triplets or greater multiples.
The woman who has found her
self carrying more than she had
planned is often referred to a doc
tor who performs selective abor
tions. The equipment is in every
hospital — needles and
ultrasound machines — but the
expertise is rare.
Dr. Micki Golbus of the
Reproductive Genetics Unit of the
Department of Obstetrics and Gy
necology at the Univeristy of Cal
ifornia at San Francisco Medical
School and his assistant Dr.
James Goldberg are the only doc
tors in the Bay Area that do selec
tive abortions, also called preg

nancy reductions. Goldberg esti
mated that there are only 10 to
20 doctors in the nation that per
form such reductions.
Unlike the typical mother
seeking abortion of a single fetus,
the typical woman seeking selec
tive abo?tion wants a child, in
many cases badly enough to turn
to artificial methods. She is torn
when told that her pregnancy is
likely to be unhealthy. This is the
opposite dilemma of a woman
with a single healthy fetus who
does not want the child for emo
tional and/or economic reasons.
Although there are risks to the
mother ranging from real dangers
to terrible inconvenience, selec
tive abortions are done mainly to
save the baby. "These (women)
are willing to go through anything
to get pregnant and save all of
their fetuses," said Dr. Amin
Milki of the Stanford Medical
Center's in vitro fertilization pro
gram.
Women bearing multiple
fetuses are themselves at much
higher risk of toxemia, a disorder
characterized by high blood pres
sure and fluid retention which can
cause convulsions in the mother.
Multiple fetuses also increase the
mother's chance of obstetrical
hemorrhaging after delivery. Fur
ther, to prevent the babies from
being premature, the mother may
have to be hospitalized for weeks
or months, receiving drugs and
frequent medical tests, according
to Milki.
"Each (abortion case) is a tough
ethical decision for the couple,"
Goldberg said of the cases he has
seen. He said that the woman's
infertility history, her expecta
tions and other children are all
discussed, but the ultimate deci
sion almost always rests on a
health or survival issue.
However, one woman reduced
her presumably healthy twins to
a single fetus, according to the
New York Times.
"We don't definitely recom
mend (pregnancy reduction) in
any case. We counsel the parents
about the risk of successfully car
rying the pregnancy versus the

risk of the procedure," Goldberg
said.
In general, the greater the num
ber of fetuses, the greater the risk
of developmental problems or
death. The biggest increase in risk
occurs between twins and triplets,
according to Goldberg. Triplets
and greater multiples will very
frequently be born premature, of
ten developing neurological
defects.
Golbus fir3t began selective
abortion a number of years ago
for twins, one of which was ab
normal. In such cases, the mother
had to choose between aborting
both or accepting one abnormal
child, Golbus said. Now, the
woman can choose to give birth
to a single healthy baby. Golbus
has applied his technique to about
15 of these cases.
Golbus extended the technique

to other cases of multiple
pregancy within the last two
years. All four or five of their
selective abortions have been for
women who received in vitro
fertilized eggs.
The largest number of fetuses
in a mother treated at UCSF was
four, but other programs have had
much larger numbers, Goldberg
said. The New York Times docu
ments cases of women with six
and eight fetuses, both of whom
turned to selective abortion.
Most doctors, including Golbus,
leave the woman with twins. All
of the UCSF pregnancy reduc
tions have been successful, Golbus
said. Indeed, Milki is not aware
of any reported cases in which a
doctor performing reduction has
lost all of the fetuses.
However, it is hard to get reli
able data about the success rate

of the technique, because, as Milki
pointed out, doctors are not likely
to report cases that failed. Fur
ther, the technique has not been
performed enough times for there
to be reliable statistics on success
rates.
The technique is delicate be
cause the fetuses are small — as
small as one and a half inches
long — and the doctor must target
only certain ones.
There is also a risk that the
process, like any other that pokes
around in the uterus, will induce
premature contractions and result
in the loss of all of the fetuses,
according to Milki.
Although pregnancy reduction
is delicate, the doctors who do it,
including Golbus, learned it on


their own without ever seeing
it done.
"The technique was an ex
tension of a whole range of fe
tal therapeutic techniques"
familiar to the UCSF doctors,
Goldberg said.
Doctors at Stanford do not
perform pregnancy reductions
and do not plan to start such
a service. Because of the risk
involved, it is better for a su
perspecialist — like Golbus —
to do it, Milki said.
Stanford doctors have never
referred any patient to a doctor
for selective abortions, but if
they were to do so they would
refer her to Golbus, he said.
The first pregnancy reduc
tions were performed in 1983
and 1984 by Dr. Yves Dumez
in Paris and a Dr. Rodesch in
Belgium.
So, the ethics of single fetus
abortion is no longer the
newest debate about how much
control humans should have
over the fate of potential new
life. But neither is it the oldest.
In 1916, when Margaret
Sanger founded the first U.S.
birth control clinic in Brooklyn,
she was arrested and jailed. At
that time, the popular moral
consensus in America dictated
that humans were not even al
lowed control over their own
gametes — eggs and sperm.
Most Americans now not
only condone but openly sup
port the use of birth control
to prevent the conception of an
unwanted child. But abortion
is a harder "pill" to swallow
because after the sperm and

egg have combined, many jus
tifiably believe that life has
begun.
Anti-abortionists believe
that an egg, once fertilized,
deserves a kind of "self
determination," freedom to

carry out its genetic program,
no matter what the desires of
the more developed being that
conceived it. However, when
those "desires" include real
threats to the life of the
siblings and the mother of that
self-determined fetus, a person
still against termination for
any reason begins to represent
an extreme viewpoint.
Thus, the moral-ethical
dilemmas created by multiple
abortion cases make it harder
to defend blanket statements
about the immorality of abor
tion.
But at the very least, "pro
choice" supporters should be
glad Americans are debating
abortion and not birth control.
A doctor pushes a needle
through a woman's belly while
watching the tip on an ultrasound
display. He guides the needle to
the target — a black gestational
sack. — the capsule of water sur
rounding a 9-week-old fetus.
Potassium chloride flows through
the needle and into the fetal heart.
The heart stops. The dead fetus
is eventually absorbed by the
mother's body. But if all has gone
well, the remaining fetuses
develop nicely.

Doctors skilled in the art of
selective abortion are trying to
sculpt a more perfect pregnancy.
But while whittling a vital crea
tion, the doctors' needles pierced
the front page of the New York
Times in a Jan. 25 article. As the
Times made glaringly clear, nei
ther parents nor doctors of selec
tive abortions can escape the
moral dilemmas associated with
the death of an unborn child. But
what the Times did not explicitly
state was that selective abortions
can ease more ethical dilemmas
than they create.
The arguments for selective
abortion, in many cases, are com
pelling enough to make the most
avid anti-abortionist stutter. A
woman bearing three to eight
embryos is at high risk for serious
medical complications; for both
herself and, more importantly,
her unborn children. The unex
pected child-rearing prospects
facing the woman often are not

an issue.
Women pregnant with multiple
fetuses are often at high risk of
miscarriage (possibly in advanced
stages of pregnancy), or of giving
birth to premature fetuses, which
may not survive or may develop
neurological defects. Selective
abortion allows a woman to
preserve the life and health of one
or two fetuses, when previously
she may have aborted all of them.
Some women become aware in
their third month that one or
more of their fetuses is abnormal.
Without selective abortion, these
parents are faced with a dilemma:
is preserving the life of a healthy
fetus worth the emotional and fi
nancial strain — on the entire
family — brought by a child with
severe abnormalities?
More parents are now faced
with the dilemmas created by
multiple pregnancies because
today's fertility techniques result
in a high frequency of multiple
pregnancies relative to natural
methods.
In some cases, a doctor gives
an infertile woman an ovulation
enhancing drug, which can induce
the release of more than one egg
from the ovaries. Or doctors may
have implanted several in vitro
or test tube- fertilized eggs in a
woman's uterus and several sur
vive. With the implantation of five

health or survival issue.
However, one woman reduced
her presumably healthy twins to
a single fetus, according to the
New York Times.
"We don't definitely recom
mend (pregnancy reduction) in
any case. We counsel the parents
about the risk of successfully car
rying the pregnancy versus the

risk of the procedure," Goldberg
said.
In general, the greater the num
ber of fetuses, the greater the risk
of developmental problems or
death. The biggest increase in risk
occurs between twins and triplets,
according to Goldberg. Triplets
and greater multiples will very
frequently be born premature, of
ten developing neurological
defects.
Golbus fir3t began selective
abortion a number of years ago
for twins, one of which was ab
normal. In such cases, the mother
had to choose between aborting
both or accepting one abnormal
child, Golbus said. Now, the
woman can choose to give birth
to a single healthy baby. Golbus
has applied his technique to about
15 of these cases.
Golbus extended the technique

to other cases of multiple
pregancy within the last two
years. All four or five of their
selective abortions have been for
women who received in vitro
fertilized eggs.
The largest number of fetuses
in a mother treated at UCSF was
four, but other programs have had
much larger numbers, Goldberg
said. The New York Times docu
ments cases of women with six
and eight fetuses, both of whom
turned to selective abortion.
Most doctors, including Golbus,
leave the woman with twins. All
of the UCSF pregnancy reduc
tions have been successful, Golbus
said. Indeed, Milki is not aware
of any reported cases in which a
doctor performing reduction has
lost all of the fetuses.
However, it is hard to get reli
able data about the success rate

of the technique, because, as Milki
pointed out, doctors are not likely
to report cases that failed. Fur
ther, the technique has not been
performed enough times for there
to be reliable statistics on success
rates.
The technique is delicate be
cause the fetuses are small — as
small as one and a half inches
long — and the doctor must target
only certain ones.
There is also a risk that the
process, like any other that pokes
around in the uterus, will induce
premature contractions and result
in the loss of all of the fetuses,
according to Milki.
Although pregnancy reduction
is delicate, the doctors who do it,
including Golbus, learned it on


their own without ever seeing
it done.
"The technique was an ex
tension of a whole range of fe
tal therapeutic techniques"
familiar to the UCSF doctors,
Goldberg said.
Doctors at Stanford do not
perform pregnancy reductions
and do not plan to start such
a service. Because of the risk
involved, it is better for a su
perspecialist — like Golbus —
to do it, Milki said.
Stanford doctors have never
referred any patient to a doctor
for selective abortions, but if
they were to do so they would
refer her to Golbus, he said.
The first pregnancy reduc
tions were performed in 1983
and 1984 by Dr. Yves Dumez
in Paris and a Dr. Rodesch in
Belgium.
So, the ethics of single fetus
abortion is no longer the
newest debate about how much
control humans should have
over the fate of potential new
life. But neither is it the oldest.
In 1916, when Margaret
Sanger founded the first U.S.
birth control clinic in Brooklyn,
she was arrested and jailed. At
that time, the popular moral
consensus in America dictated
that humans were not even al
lowed control over their own
gametes — eggs and sperm.
Most Americans now not
only condone but openly sup
port the use of birth control
to prevent the conception of an
unwanted child. But abortion
is a harder "pill" to swallow
because after the sperm and

egg have combined, many jus
tifiably believe that life has
begun.
Anti-abortionists believe
that an egg, once fertilized,
deserves a kind of "self
determination," freedom to

carry out its genetic program,
no matter what the desires of
the more developed being that
conceived it. However, when
those "desires" include real
threats to the life of the
siblings and the mother of that
self-determined fetus, a person
still against termination for
any reason begins to represent
an extreme viewpoint.
Thus, the moral-ethical
dilemmas created by multiple
abortion cases make it harder
to defend blanket statements
about the immorality of abor
tion.
But at the very least, "pro
choice" supporters should be
glad Americans are debating
abortion and not birth control.
A doctor pushes a needle
through a woman's belly while
watching the tip on an ultrasound
display. He guides the needle to
the target — a black gestational
sack. — the capsule of water sur
rounding a 9-week-old fetus.
Potassium chloride flows through
the needle and into the fetal heart.
The heart stops. The dead fetus
is eventually absorbed by the
mother's body. But if all has gone
well, the remaining fetuses
develop nicely.

Doctors skilled in the art of
selective abortion are trying to
sculpt a more perfect pregnancy.
But while whittling a vital crea
tion, the doctors' needles pierced
the front page of the New York
Times in a Jan. 25 article. As the
Times made glaringly clear, nei
ther parents nor doctors of selec
tive abortions can escape the
moral dilemmas associated with
the death of an unborn child. But
what the Times did not explicitly
state was that selective abortions
can ease more ethical dilemmas
than they create.
The arguments for selective
abortion, in many cases, are com
pelling enough to make the most
avid anti-abortionist stutter. A
woman bearing three to eight
embryos is at high risk for serious
medical complications; for both
herself and, more importantly,
her unborn children. The unex
pected child-rearing prospects
facing the woman often are not

an issue.
Women pregnant with multiple
fetuses are often at high risk of
miscarriage (possibly in advanced
stages of pregnancy), or of giving
birth to premature fetuses, which
may not survive or may develop
neurological defects. Selective
abortion allows a woman to
preserve the life and health of one
or two fetuses, when previously
she may have aborted all of them.
Some women become aware in
their third month that one or
more of their fetuses is abnormal.
Without selective abortion, these
parents are faced with a dilemma:
is preserving the life of a healthy
fetus worth the emotional and fi
nancial strain — on the entire
family — brought by a child with
severe abnormalities?
More parents are now faced
with the dilemmas created by
multiple pregnancies because
today's fertility techniques result
in a high frequency of multiple
pregnancies relative to natural
methods.
In some cases, a doctor gives
an infertile woman an ovulation
enhancing drug, which can induce
the release of more than one egg
from the ovaries. Or doctors may
have implanted several in vitro
or test tube- fertilized eggs in a
woman's uterus and several sur
vive. With the implantation of five
embryos, more than two survive
in fewer than one in 100 women.
However, this is still 50 times
higher than the natural incidence
of triplets or greater multiples.
The woman who has found her
self carrying more than she had
planned is often referred to a doc
tor who performs selective abor
tions. The equipment is in every
hospital — needles and
ultrasound machines — but the
expertise is rare.
Dr. Micki Golbus of the
Reproductive Genetics Unit of the
Department of Obstetrics and Gy
necology at the Univeristy of Cal
ifornia at San Francisco Medical
School and his assistant Dr.
James Goldberg are the only doc
tors in the Bay Area that do selec
tive abortions, also called preg

nancy reductions. Goldberg esti
mated that there are only 10 to
20 doctors in the nation that per
form such reductions.
Unlike the typical mother
seeking abortion of a single fetus,
the typical woman seeking selec
tive abo?tion wants a child, in
many cases badly enough to turn
to artificial methods. She is torn
when told that her pregnancy is
likely to be unhealthy. This is the
opposite dilemma of a woman
with a single healthy fetus who
does not want the child for emo
tional and/or economic reasons.
Although there are risks to the
mother ranging from real dangers
to terrible inconvenience, selec
tive abortions are done mainly to
save the baby. "These (women)
are willing to go through anything
to get pregnant and save all of
their fetuses," said Dr. Amin
Milki of the Stanford Medical
Center's in vitro fertilization pro
gram.
Women bearing multiple
fetuses are themselves at much
higher risk of toxemia, a disorder
characterized by high blood pres
sure and fluid retention which can
cause convulsions in the mother.
Multiple fetuses also increase the
mother's chance of obstetrical
hemorrhaging after delivery. Fur
ther, to prevent the babies from
being premature, the mother may
have to be hospitalized for weeks
or months, receiving drugs and
frequent medical tests, according
to Milki.
"Each (abortion case) is a tough
ethical decision for the couple,"
Goldberg said of the cases he has
seen. He said that the woman's
infertility history, her expecta
tions and other children are all
discussed, but the ultimate deci
sion almost always rests on a
health or survival issue.
However, one woman reduced
her presumably healthy twins to
a single fetus, according to the
