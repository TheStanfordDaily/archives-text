# ASSU explains quarterly fee policy
## Funds go to student organizations

This is the third in a series on
the finances of the Associated Stu

Most Stanford students imme
diately recognize the itemized $24
charge on tuition bills marked
"ASSU Special Fee." But where
does it go?
The title is very misleading, ac
cording to senior Vivienne Huang,
ASSU financial manager. The
money does not go into ASSU cof
fers to help run the student
ernment. "The money is not ours,
we don't use it in any way,"
Huang said.
Rather, the funds are allocated
to various student groups accord
ing to the guidelines established
in the spring student election.
Students have the option in the
election to approve or deny each
fee request made by specific
groups.
The process which culminates
in the election and eventual dis
tribution of money begins at this
time each year. According to
junior John Inda, chair of the
ASSU Senate Appropriations
Committee, groups must put to
gether a budget request and pres
ent it to the committee.
The group's representatives
then must be interviewed by the
committee, which makes recom
mendations to each on possible
changes in their proposals, and
then suggests whether or not the
senate should place the request
on the ballot.
The senate votes whether or

not the money request should ac
tually go on the ballot. This year's
vote will take place at the senate's
next meeting on Feb. 10.
According to Inda, 25 groups
have applied for funding this year.
Among them are the Program
Board, ASSU Legal Counseling,
The Daily, the Black Student Un
ion, the Quad t Stanford-in-
Government and SURE Escort
Service.
In the event that the senate
rejects the proposal, the group
does have the option to petition
students to have their request
considered in the spring. Inda said
students must put together a pe
tition of "20 percent of the stu
dent body by the end of February"
in order to land a spot on the
ballot.
If the senate so desires, it can
split a fee request into separate
parts on the ballot. According to
Inda, this usually happens when
the senate feels a portion of a
group's budget is worthwhile
while another is not. As an ex
ample, he described the Stanford
Band's fee request last year.
Funds for a planned trip to
Colorado were included in the
Band's budget. Inda said the fee
request was split with the feeling
that "the Band is worthwhile, but
the trip not necessarily so." The
students passed the non-trip re
quest, but decided not to fund the
trip.
Students have the option of
having up to $23.81 of the $24
returned each quarter. The errant
19 cents goes to the ASSU to
administer the disbursement of
the money and student refunds,
Huang said. At the start of each

quarter, the University sends the
ASSU a large check which is im
mediately disbursed to the appro
priate groups.
The process takes the "time of
at least one professional staff
member for at least two weeks,"
Huang said. Students can get
itemized refunds, so that they can
take back money from one organ
ization but not from others.
The student refunds are taken
into account by budgeting a
return rate of 25 percent. If more
than the budgeted amount is
returned to students, Huang said,
she technically has the authority
to take back money from the af
fected groups.
Student opinions concerning
the Special Fee System are ex
tremely varied. One student,

freshman Erica Webber, com
plained, "Since they take it [the
$24 fee] and go through all of the
red tape to give it back to us, why
don't they give us that option in
the beginning?"
In contrast, freshman Clarisse
Perrette said she "thinks it is good
because they give you the option
of refunding the money. It works
well because people who aren't
paying attention don't get their
money back."
The fee went up this year from
$21 per quarter to $24 as a result
of the spring election, said Inda.
The amount of the fee is deter
mined by how many groups are
given funding in the spring, and
how much money they will
receive. Potentially, the fee level
could fluctuate again this year.

money does not go into ASSU cof
fers to help run the student
ernment. "The money is not ours,
we don't use it in any way,"
Huang said.
Rather, the funds are allocated
to various student groups accord
ing to the guidelines established
in the spring student election.
Students have the option in the
election to approve or deny each
fee request made by specific
groups.
The process which culminates
in the election and eventual dis
tribution of money begins at this
time each year. According to
junior John Inda, chair of the
ASSU Senate Appropriations
Committee, groups must put to
gether a budget request and pres
ent it to the committee.
The group's representatives
then must be interviewed by the
committee, which makes recom
mendations to each on possible
changes in their proposals, and
then suggests whether or not the
senate should place the request
on the ballot.
The senate votes whether or

not the money request should ac
tually go on the ballot. This year's
vote will take place at the senate's
next meeting on Feb. 10.
According to Inda, 25 groups
have applied for funding this year.
Among them are the Program
Board, ASSU Legal Counseling,
The Daily, the Black Student Un
ion, the Quad t Stanford-in-
Government and SURE Escort
Service.
In the event that the senate
rejects the proposal, the group
does have the option to petition
students to have their request
considered in the spring. Inda said
students must put together a pe
tition of "20 percent of the stu
dent body by the end of February"
in order to land a spot on the
ballot.
If the senate so desires, it can
split a fee request into separate
parts on the ballot. According to
Inda, this usually happens when
the senate feels a portion of a
group's budget is worthwhile
while another is not. As an ex
ample, he described the Stanford
Band's fee request last year.
Funds for a planned trip to
Colorado were included in the
Band's budget. Inda said the fee
request was split with the feeling
that "the Band is worthwhile, but
the trip not necessarily so." The
students passed the non-trip re
quest, but decided not to fund the
trip.
Students have the option of
having up to $23.81 of the $24
returned each quarter. The errant
19 cents goes to the ASSU to
administer the disbursement of
the money and student refunds,
Huang said. At the start of each

quarter, the University sends the
ASSU a large check which is im
mediately disbursed to the appro
priate groups.
The process takes the "time of
at least one professional staff
member for at least two weeks,"
Huang said. Students can get
itemized refunds, so that they can
take back money from one organ
ization but not from others.
The student refunds are taken
into account by budgeting a
return rate of 25 percent. If more
than the budgeted amount is
returned to students, Huang said,
she technically has the authority
to take back money from the af
fected groups.
Student opinions concerning
the Special Fee System are ex
tremely varied. One student,

freshman Erica Webber, com
plained, "Since they take it [the
$24 fee] and go through all of the
red tape to give it back to us, why
don't they give us that option in
the beginning?"
In contrast, freshman Clarisse
Perrette said she "thinks it is good
because they give you the option
of refunding the money. It works
well because people who aren't
paying attention don't get their
money back."
The fee went up this year from
$21 per quarter to $24 as a result
of the spring election, said Inda.
The amount of the fee is deter
mined by how many groups are
given funding in the spring, and
how much money they will
receive. Potentially, the fee level
could fluctuate again this year.
