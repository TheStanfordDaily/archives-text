Black Athena: The Afroasiatic
Roots of Classical Civilization
by Martin Bernal
Rutgers University Press, 1987

Reviewed by lain Boal
The central argument of the
first volume of "Black Athena" is
that Classical civilization has deep
roots in Afroasiatic cultures, es
pecially Egypt and Phoenicia, and
that these roots have been sys
tematically suppressed since the
18th century for racist reasons.
Indeed, this case has been cir
culating in paratial forms for
some years in the work of a few
marginal intellectuals, chiefly
black or Jewish. Martin Bernal,
the author of "Black Athena," is
himself an outsider (sinologist,
radical, part-Jewish Celt) with in
sider credentials (J.D. Bernal's
son, longtime Fellow of King's
College, Cambridge, and now Pro
fessor of Government Studies at
Cornell).
Ironically, Bernal's iconoclastic
assertion of the Egyptian and
Levantine roots of Classical
civilization would have struck
Plato and Co. as a statement of
the obvious. Such was precisely
their own view of the matter.
Greek culture, they believed, was
an outgrowth of colonization by
Egyptians and Phoenicians. This
view — the "ancient model" in
Bernal's argot — prevailed right
through the 17th century; until,
that is, racism on the grounds of
skin color developed in England
in tandem with the colonial
policies of Native American
genocide and black slavery.
A new view of the Greeks began
to emerge at this time, supplant
ing the ancient model. The dis
course of "progress," which
naturally favored "young" Greece
over ancient Afroasiatic cultures
("later is better") and the Roman
tic admiration for invigorating
climates and Northern landscapes
contributed to this revisionism.
History began to be seen not as

the story of mankind but rather
as the biographies of "races,"
chronicalling the triumph of
"strong and vital peoples over
weak and feeble ones." The taint
ing of Arvans/Caucasians by
African and Semitic "blood" was
not tolerated by the new his
torians. Such is the setting for
the emergence of Classics as a
discipline.
The high tide of the Aryan
model, however, was reached only
in the 19205, coinciding with the
spread of Western Civilization
courses in American colleges.
Indeed, some of the Eurocentric
presuppositions of the Aryin
model lie deeply embedded in the
Western Culture Program at
Stanford.
Since the late 1960s the role of
the Levant in the formation of
ancient Greece has begun to be
conceded. However, the tradi
tional attribution of much of
Greek civilization to Egypt is still
denied. Moreover, says Bernal, "in
Greek language studies — the last
bunker of Romanticism and the
Extreme Aryan Model — any talk
of significant Afroasiatic influence
on Greek is ruled absurd." Ber
nal's researches have explored the
possibility of massive Semitic and
Egyptian components in the vo
cabulary of Greek, which would
suggest profound and long-term
linguistic and cultural contact.
Whatever the outcome of Ber
nal's philological hypotheses
(which will be explored in the later
volumes of "Black Athena") the
larger significance of this book lies
in its contribution to the sociology
of knowledge. Bernal mounts an
extraordinarily powerful case for
the social conditioning of human
inquiry. The rise and fall of the
Aryan model has had very little
to do with the internal merits or
deficiencies of the evidence and
almost everything to do with the
European worldview and sys
tematic racism.
Why were the two most impor
tant breakthroughs in Classical
studies — the excavation of Troy

by the German tycoon Heinrich
Schliemann and the decipherment
of Linear B by the architect Mi
chael Ventris — the work of
amateurs? Why has it taken a
historian who speicalizes in China
to overthrow some of the most
cherished assumptions about an
cient Greece and the foundations
of "Western civilization?" Once
more Thomas Kuhn's dictum,
that fundamental challenges to
disciplines come from outside the
field, is corroborated. The fact is
that a long introduction into a
discipline does not conduce to the
questioning of its basic premises.

This ought to give pause to all
those in the "Western Culture"
fracas — from Allan Bloom up —
who gather at the pure springs
of Greek rationality and science.
"Black Athens" — in Bernal's
clear, mordant prose — uncovers
the ideological construction of an
cient Greece. The first volume of
the trilogy alone is a monumental
achievement that is destined to
become, as it were, a classic.

Black Athena: The Afroasiatic
Roots of Classical Civilization
by Martin Bernal

Reviewed by lain Boal
The central argument of the
first volume of "Black Athena" is
that Classical civilization has deep
roots in Afroasiatic cultures, es
pecially Egypt and Phoenicia, and
that these roots have been sys
tematically suppressed since the
18th century for racist reasons.
Indeed, this case has been cir
culating in paratial forms for
some years in the work of a few
marginal intellectuals, chiefly
black or Jewish. Martin Bernal,
the author of "Black Athena," is
himself an outsider (sinologist,
radical, part-Jewish Celt) with in
sider credentials (J.D. Bernal's
son, longtime Fellow of King's
College, Cambridge, and now Pro
fessor of Government Studies at
Cornell).
Ironically, Bernal's iconoclastic
assertion of the Egyptian and
Levantine roots of Classical
civilization would have struck
Plato and Co. as a statement of
the obvious. Such was precisely
their own view of the matter.
Greek culture, they believed, was
an outgrowth of colonization by
Egyptians and Phoenicians. This
view — the "ancient model" in
Bernal's argot — prevailed right
through the 17th century; until,
that is, racism on the grounds of
skin color developed in England
in tandem with the colonial
policies of Native American
genocide and black slavery.
A new view of the Greeks began
to emerge at this time, supplant
ing the ancient model. The dis
course of "progress," which
naturally favored "young" Greece
over ancient Afroasiatic cultures
("later is better") and the Roman
tic admiration for invigorating
climates and Northern landscapes
contributed to this revisionism.
History began to be seen not as

the story of mankind but rather
as the biographies of "races,"
chronicalling the triumph of
"strong and vital peoples over
weak and feeble ones." The taint
ing of Arvans/Caucasians by
African and Semitic "blood" was
not tolerated by the new his
torians. Such is the setting for
the emergence of Classics as a
discipline.
