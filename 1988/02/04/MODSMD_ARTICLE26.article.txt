"If I am right ... it
will be necessary not
only to rethink the fun
damental basis of 'West
ern Civilization' but also
to recognize the
penetration of racism
and 'continental
chauvanism' into all our
historography, or philos
ophy of writing history.
The Ancient Model had
no major 'internal'
deficiencies, or weak
nesses in explanatory
power."
