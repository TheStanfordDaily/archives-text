## Card hopes to upset No. 1-ranked Wildcats 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
The barnstorming Arizona Wildcats
bring their perfect 9-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference show into a sold-out Maples
Pavilion tonight, and the scheduled
victim — er, host — is the Stanford
Cardinal.
And like every other team on the

Wildcats' 20-1, top-ranked tour, the Cardinal will
be breathing fire as it tries to knock off the top-Cats.
Add to all this the fact that Stanford has pounced
on Arizona the last three years at Maples, and,
well, this one could be a real barnburner.
Then again, this one could also be a real blowout.
The Wildcats average winning margin this year has
been 21.7 points, and they trounced Stanford 90-65
last month in Tuscon.
In that contest, Cardinal forward Howard Wright
was in early foul trouble, top-scorer Todd Lichti
was still recovering from the flu, freshman forward
Andrew Vlahov was injured and the Arizona crowd
propelled the Wildcats to a big early lead.
Today, all of those Cardinal misfortunes are mere
memories.
"A lot of people don't expect a lot from Stanford,
but I've never lost to these guys at home," Cardinal
center Greg Butler said. "They've got everything
to lose and we've got everything to gain."
Stanford (13-7 overall, 5-4 in the conference) has
defeated Arizona in Maples the past three years by
scores of 75-73, 62-56 and 55-51. During that time
span, however, Arizona rarely ever appeared in the
Top 20, let alone at no. 1.
"We have gone in there (Maples) and lost the
games at the wire," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said
yesterday. "We seem to have a lot of foul problems
up there, and they play a lot of teams tough there."
The Wildcats sport a couple of legitimate All-
America candidates along with one of the best start
ing line-ups in the country. Junior forward Sean
Elliott is simply a scoring machine — he's averaging
18.7 points per game and he does it in every way
imaginable. And because opponents collapse on him,
he feeds his inside teammates Anthony Cook and
Tom Tolbert for easy hoops.
Wildcat senior point guard Steve Kerr meanwhile
is the epitome of control. Kerr has 20 turnovers in
21 games. Wow.

Bye, Bye ...
As any basketball coach will gladly tell you, on defense one should
never give up the baseline, especially to Stanford power forward
Howard Wright. With most of his shots coming inside from moves
like this, it's little wonder that Wright is currently the Cardinal's
most accurate shooter with an astounding 63.6 field goal percentage
on the season.


"They're not physical, but they
make very few mistakes and play
together well," Cardinal Asst.
Coach Doug Oliver said yesterday.
"They have a lot of weapons. Cook
does not get enough recognition."
The 6-foot-9 Cook, who after
beefing up in the off-season no
longer literally stands in Elliot's
shadow, is averaging 12.4 points
per game and 7.3 rebounds. Many
of those points are on slam dunks.
Stanford is beginning to develop

its own set of twin towers. Butler,
who stands at 6-11, is on a five
game hot streak, and coupled with
Wright, who is shooting an
amazing 63.6 percent from the
field, the two are pouring in points
from the paint.
"They've got two big bodied
scorers on the inside with Butler
and Wright," Olson said. "And
Vlahov being back gives them an
other guy off the bench. I think
they ran out of gas last time be
cause they were short off the
bench."
When Arizona needs a bucket
in the crunch Elliott is the man,
and for Stanford, Lichti is the

one, although he has admittedly
been in a slump recently.
"I haven't been playing as well
as I can, and I'd like to turn it
around (against Arizona)," Lichti
said. "I think we have a legitimate
chance to knock them off."
First, the Cardinal will have to
knock off turning the ball over.
Stanford is shooting 52 percent
from the field on the year, but
the problem has been that the
team too often turns the ball over
before a shot is taken.
Against Arizona's pressure
defense in Tuscon, Stanford got
rattled early and the Wildcats cap
italized on Cardinal mistakes.

Wildcats' 20-1, top-ranked tour, the Cardinal will
be breathing fire as it tries to knock off the top-Cats.
Add to all this the fact that Stanford has pounced
on Arizona the last three years at Maples, and,
well, this one could be a real barnburner.
Then again, this one could also be a real blowout.
The Wildcats average winning margin this year has
been 21.7 points, and they trounced Stanford 90-65
last month in Tuscon.
In that contest, Cardinal forward Howard Wright
was in early foul trouble, top-scorer Todd Lichti
was still recovering from the flu, freshman forward
Andrew Vlahov was injured and the Arizona crowd
propelled the Wildcats to a big early lead.
Today, all of those Cardinal misfortunes are mere
memories.
"A lot of people don't expect a lot from Stanford,
but I've never lost to these guys at home," Cardinal
center Greg Butler said. "They've got everything
to lose and we've got everything to gain."
Stanford (13-7 overall, 5-4 in the conference) has
defeated Arizona in Maples the past three years by
scores of 75-73, 62-56 and 55-51. During that time
span, however, Arizona rarely ever appeared in the
Top 20, let alone at no. 1.
"We have gone in there (Maples) and lost the
games at the wire," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said
yesterday. "We seem to have a lot of foul problems
up there, and they play a lot of teams tough there."
The Wildcats sport a couple of legitimate All-
America candidates along with one of the best start
ing line-ups in the country. Junior forward Sean
Elliott is simply a scoring machine — he's averaging
18.7 points per game and he does it in every way
imaginable. And because opponents collapse on him,
he feeds his inside teammates Anthony Cook and
Tom Tolbert for easy hoops.
Wildcat senior point guard Steve Kerr meanwhile
is the epitome of control. Kerr has 20 turnovers in
21 games. Wow.

Bye, Bye ...
As any basketball coach will gladly tell you, on defense one should
never give up the baseline, especially to Stanford power forward
Howard Wright. With most of his shots coming inside from moves
like this, it's little wonder that Wright is currently the Cardinal's
most accurate shooter with an astounding 63.6 field goal percentage
on the season.


"They're not physical, but they
make very few mistakes and play
together well," Cardinal Asst.
Coach Doug Oliver said yesterday.
"They have a lot of weapons. Cook
does not get enough recognition."
The 6-foot-9 Cook, who after
beefing up in the off-season no
longer literally stands in Elliot's
shadow, is averaging 12.4 points
per game and 7.3 rebounds. Many
of those points are on slam dunks.
Stanford is beginning to develop

its own set of twin towers. Butler,
who stands at 6-11, is on a five
game hot streak, and coupled with
Wright, who is shooting an
amazing 63.6 percent from the
field, the two are pouring in points
from the paint.
"They've got two big bodied
scorers on the inside with Butler
and Wright," Olson said. "And
Vlahov being back gives them an
other guy off the bench. I think
they ran out of gas last time be
cause they were short off the
bench."
When Arizona needs a bucket
in the crunch Elliott is the man,
and for Stanford, Lichti is the

one, although he has admittedly
been in a slump recently.
"I haven't been playing as well
as I can, and I'd like to turn it
around (against Arizona)," Lichti
said. "I think we have a legitimate
chance to knock them off."
First, the Cardinal will have to
knock off turning the ball over.
Stanford is shooting 52 percent
from the field on the year, but
the problem has been that the
team too often turns the ball over
before a shot is taken.
Against Arizona's pressure
defense in Tuscon, Stanford got
rattled early and the Wildcats cap
italized on Cardinal mistakes.
