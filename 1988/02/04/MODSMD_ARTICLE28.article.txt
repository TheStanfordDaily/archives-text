# Hoops fans have to come alive

Tonight is the night.
If ever Maples Pavilion is
going to become a real home
court for Stanford, tonight is
the night it needs to happen.
If ever Cardinal basketball
fans are going to become fans,
if ever they are going to turn
into participants who affect the
outcome of the game, rather
than casual observers, tonight
is the night it needs to happen.

Tonight the no. 1 Arizona
Wildcats visit Maples, and
Stanford has a chance to topple
the 'Cats — if the fans work
as hard as the players.
Sure, the Cardinal crowd has
been louder this year than in
many years past. But it is the
timing that counts.
"The student section does a
good job when the team is
doing well," Cardinal elder
statesman Eric Reveno said
yesterday morning after his ac
counting class. "It's when
we're down by 10 points to
someone and we're not playing
well — that's when they could
get behind us more."
Indeed, the fans at Maples
Pavilion can be a valuable asset
when Stanford is on a roll.
When the Cardinal is strug
gling during a game, however,
and that deathly quiet mur
muring sound envelopes the
Pavilion, the crowd's silence
becomes a liability.
Real fans go bonkers trying

to bring their t(Jams back from
deficits. RoaWans realize their
noise and energy can ignite a
team that is beginning to sag.
"When you're behind or
things are in the balance, the
crowd can carry you through
the rough spots," Stanford As
st. Coach Barry Collier said.
"When it gets quiet our players
feel a little like they're out
there by themselves."
Stanford center Greg Butler,
who proudly states that in
three years he has never lost
to Arizona at home and doesn't
plan to this time, hopes the
crowd will help him out. "I
hope they get going, because
even if you're tired, when that
kind of noise hits you, you get
going."
Why, if the Stanford players
and coaches work hundreds of
hours, why can't the Stanford
fans work for two hours?
Many Stanford students
wear sweats to the game, and
yet they don't break a sweat
rooting for their team. Cardi
nal fans inexplicably sit during
the game and stand at
halftime. If you situate yourself
in the student section and try
to stand up during the game,
you hear people behind you
yelling "down in front."
It's sad, but true.
Remember that fan is short
for fanatic. The Stanford
players encounter real fans on
almost every road trip. Asst.
Coach Doug Oliver said they
visited McArthur Court in
Oregon to face the 9-9 Ducks
and "8,300 fans were going
crazy like it was the conference
championship."
Tonight's game is sold-out.
There are a lot of things 7,500
Cardinal fans could do.

"Hopefully our crowd will be a
factor and maybe get on their
players a little, just like we get it
on the road," Stanford guard
Todd Lichti said. "I'd like to get
(the fans) to bother the opposing
team more than they do."
For those fans who are sensi
tive, behavior need not be offen
sive to be effective.
"I don't know if you need that
name calling, but booing a guy
every time he gets the ball is all
in good fun," Reveno said.
"We'd love to generate an at
mosphere where the fans are en
joying an event because they are
involved and not simply
watching," Collier said.
Tonight could be fun.
