# Cardinal v-ball whips Loyola, 3-0
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
When Chris Young of Loyola
Marymount hit a kill long last night
to end an exciting first point, it set
the tone for the entire volleyball
match between the No. 12 Stanford
Cardinal and the No. 18 Lions.
Loyola never mustered quite enough

to counter Stanford's best performance of the year.
The Cardinal, now 3-8 overall and 1-2 in league
play, played an almost flawless match and was never
seriously threatened by the outmanned Lions, 6-5
and 0-3. Stanford won going away, 15-6, 15-5 and
15-8.
"I thought we played very well," Stanford Coach
Fred Sturm said. "It was a very complete game for
us in the sense that we didn't play badly in any
aspect of our game."
Sturm could not have been more accurate in his
assessment of his team's play. Stanford recorded a
season high 51 kills against a paltry 11 hitting
errors. The Cardinal was also able to successfully
block 15 hits coming from a normally potent Loyola
offense.
Sophomore Craig Forsyth led the Stanford
onslaught with 20 kills and an amazing .485 hitting
percentage. Sophomore Dan Hanan anchored the
defense with six blocks and four digs, including the
Cardinal's lone solo block of the match.
But amidst all the big stats, a relatively short
six-foot sophomore played one of the best games of
his career. Stanford setter Parker Blackman directed
the Cardinal offense beautifully, and still found
time to record three kills and six digs. Blackman's
.535 setting percentage easily outdistanced the .289
mark of his Loyola counterparts.
"I feel I'm successful when the guys have a good
night hitting," Blackman said. "The fact that they
did makes me feel like I did my job."
Sturm was quick to agree. "You've got to look
to the setter when we hit that well," he said. "Parker
had a tremendous game for us tonight."
Loyola, a better team than last night's perform
ance indicates, could never get it going against
Stanford after falling behind 11-3 in the first game.
Although the Cardinal had a little more trouble
scoring in the second game, their defensive play
allowed them to prevent the Lions from putting
points on the board. Stanford eventually closed out
the match with six straight points to complete the
convincing victory.
"They (Stanford) flat outplayed us," Loyola Coach
Rich Rosales said. "We certainly didn't play our
best volleyball, but I don't want to take anything

Playing as well as they have all season, John Alstrom and his Stanford teammates
had no problem beating Loyola Marymount last night as the Card won the match
in three straight games. The freshman outside hitter led the team In digs with 16.
