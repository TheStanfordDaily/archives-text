Scientists at the NASA Ames Research
Center in Mountain View are collaborat
ing with Stanford physicians to develop
a new, innovative technology that sim
ulates the "looks, sound and feel of a
three-dimensional reality," according to
Scott Fisher, a NASA researcher.
The new technology, called "virtual en
vironment," uses robots and computers
to allow a person to interact with
computer-generated objects. The key
components in creating "virtual reality"
are a helmet with a tracking sensor which
follows and records human head move
ments, and a hand device called the
Data Glove which follows and records
hand and finger movements.
The immediate goal of the research is

to meet the demands of a manned space
station planned for the mid- or late 19905.
Although the original purpose of the re
search was flight simulation, its obvious
applications in other aspects of science
led physicians at Stanford to become in
volved and attempt to apply the new
technology to other areas.
According to Fisher, the main obstacles
to this research are refining and devel
oping the sensory devices, as well as de
signing an effective method by which per
sons in the virtual environment can com
municate, issue instructions and receive
feedback from robots.
Fisher said the research will help
develop new devices to aid the person in
this environment, such as sound cueing,
voice commands, an eye-tracking appa
ratus and a tactile feedback device which
will monitor temperature, prensure and

even the texture of any virtual objects
touched by the robot.
An exciting spinoff of this technology
is "telesurgery," which would theoreti
cally enable a physician in a virtual en
vironment to operate on a patient
through a robot, "even millions of miles
away in space," Fisher said.
A physician equipped with special
monitors would be placed in the virtual
environment and then operate on a pa
tient by communicating with a robot
which performs the actual surgery.
A human would be present at the
robot's side during the procedure as a
safeguard.
Joseph Rosen, an assistant professor
of plastic surgery at the Medical School
and a NASA consultant on development
and applications of the technology, said
telesurgery is a concept which had been

developing in science research for medical
education as well as space exploration.
A medical student in a virtual envi
ronment, for example, could operate on
a virtual patient with a virtual scalpel
for practice. "If a mistake is made, noth
ing fatal has happened because it's all
virtual, not real," Rosen said.
According to Rosen, it will be another
10 to 20 years before the technology will
be advanced enough to accomodate these
developing ideas. "It's hard to predict
exactly how long it'll take because a lot
of it depends on the hardware — the
technological development for the devices
that we need, " Rosen said.
The existing devices also need refine
ment, according to Fisher. The helmet
with a monitor would allow the surgeon
to observe what the robot "sees and

does," and sensory feedback from the
glove would allow the surgeon to feel
what the robot touches.
"Evaluating hand function, for in
stance, can be much furthered with the
Data Glove," Rosen said. "Because of the
sensitivity of the device, we can experi
ment with different hand and finger
movements and discover a lot about just
exactly how our hands work — what
muscles are involved (and) how they work
together."
With the refined devices, the surgeon
would be provided with better sensory
feedback than his own. "For instance,
the glove could sense heat at a distance
that your hand couldn't," Rosen said.
"The glove could be better equipped and
smarter than your own hand. This will
help in virtual environment."
