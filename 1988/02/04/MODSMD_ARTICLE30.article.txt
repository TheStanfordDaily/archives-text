# Stanford sweeps Pacific to open season

### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
The smiles that the Stanford
women's tennis players wore
yesterday afternoon had some
thing to do with their season
opening 9-0 win over visiting
Pacific.
Rut the victorv onlv nartiallv

explained the joy in the Cardinal ranks. At
least equally gratifying was the fact that the
Cardinal disposed of the Tigers so quickly
that the players left the Stanford Tennis
Stadium earlier than they would have had
they just been practicing yesterday.
In fact, onlv a little over an hour after

Stanford's 1988 dual match season began yes
terday, the two-time defending NCAA cham
pion and top-ranked Cardinal clinched its first
victory of the season. The team plays at home
again today at 1:30 p.m. against Fresno State.
Playing without its top two players — junior
Kleni Rossides and freshman Tami Whitlinger,
who are in Minneapolis this weekend for the
Rolex National Indoor Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships — the Cardinal looked to its
two seniors to lead the way yesterday.
And Kay Tittle and Cari Hagey did just
that. Both were off the court in under an
hour to give Stanford a quick lead. Tittle had
arthroscopic surgery performed on both of
her knees in December, but she seemed un
affected yesterday as she pounded UOP's Tif

fany Lee 6-0, 6-1 in the No. 4 mntch.
Hagey has also been bothered by a knee
problem recently and has admittedly not been
playing well in the past couple of weeks.
Against UOP's Julie DeArmand, however,
Hagey had no trouble, scoring a 6-1, 6-0 vic
tory at No. 6 singles.
While victories have become commonplace
for Tittle and Hagey during their years at
Stanford, freshmen Teri Whitlinger and
Sandra Birch entered the dual-match win
column for the first time in their Cardinal
careers yesterday as they debuted auspicious
ly-
"They showed no nerves at all," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said.
