# Stanford sweeps Pacific to open season
## 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
The smiles that the Stanford
women's tennis players wore
yesterday afternoon had some
thing to do with their season
opening 9-0 win over visiting
Pacific.
Rut the victorv onlv nartiallv

explained the joy in the Cardinal ranks. At
least equally gratifying was the fact that the
Cardinal disposed of the Tigers so quickly
that the players left the Stanford Tennis
Stadium earlier than they would have had
they just been practicing yesterday.
In fact, onlv a little over an hour after

Stanford's 1988 dual match season began yes
terday, the two-time defending NCAA cham
pion and top-ranked Cardinal clinched its first
victory of the season. The team plays at home
again today at 1:30 p.m. against Fresno State.
Playing without its top two players — junior
Kleni Rossides and freshman Tami Whitlinger,
who are in Minneapolis this weekend for the
Rolex National Indoor Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships — the Cardinal looked to its
two seniors to lead the way yesterday.
And Kay Tittle and Cari Hagey did just
that. Both were off the court in under an
hour to give Stanford a quick lead. Tittle had
arthroscopic surgery performed on both of
her knees in December, but she seemed un
affected yesterday as she pounded UOP's Tif

fany Lee 6-0, 6-1 in the No. 4 mntch.
Hagey has also been bothered by a knee
problem recently and has admittedly not been
playing well in the past couple of weeks.
Against UOP's Julie DeArmand, however,
Hagey had no trouble, scoring a 6-1, 6-0 vic
tory at No. 6 singles.
While victories have become commonplace
for Tittle and Hagey during their years at
Stanford, freshmen Teri Whitlinger and
Sandra Birch entered the dual-match win
column for the first time in their Cardinal
careers yesterday as they debuted auspicious
ly-
"They showed no nerves at all," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said.

Whitlinger came out firing in
the No. 3 singles match and never
cooled off, winning by a 6-0, 6-2
score against UOP's Julie Fair
child. "Teri Whitlinger played al
most a near-perfect match," Bren
nan said.
Whitlinger said she had been
looking forward to playing her
first dual match. "This is a lot
better (than playing in tourna
ments) because you play with a
team," she said.
Birch used a variety of shots to
upend the Tigers' Leslie Powell
6-1, 6-0 in the No. 2 match. A
powerful forehand, aggressive vol
leying and a drop shot that an
noyed the slow-afoot Powell to no

end were all part of Birch's arse
nal yesterday.
Lisa Green was annoyed with
her performance in the early
stages of the first set of the No.
1 singles match. But the Cardinal
sophomore rallied from a 5-2 first
set deficit against Kristi Kern to
win 11 of the next 12 games and
the match, 7-5, 6-1.
Sophomore Valerie Wilson
rounded out the singles sweep
with a 6-2, 6-2 triumph at No. 5
singles against Debbie Rule.
The rout continued in the
doubles as the Cardinal once
again refused to drop a set to the
Tigers. Hagey and Birch defeated
Kern and Powell 6-1, 6-2 at first
doubles. Green and Whitlinger
scored a 6-1, 6-0 victory over Fair
child and Lee, and Tittle and Wil
son knocked off Rule and Lisa
Matsumura 6-3, 6-3.
