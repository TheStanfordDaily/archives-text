# Card tennis has talent to repeat

Stanford women's
ten nis Coach
Frank Brennan
never lets success
get too far away
from him. Adorn
ing his office walls

are photographs of the many Ail-
Americans he has coached and the
teams he has led to the NCAA
title.
The most recent addition to his
collection is a clock presented to
him by the members of last year's
national champion team. The in
scription reads, "No doubs" — al
luding to last May's NCAA team
tournament, when the Cardinal
overpowered the rest of the field,
clinching each of its four matches
before the doubles competition.
Brennan has some bad news for
his adversaries heading into the
1988 season. "I think we very pos
sibly could be as good as we were
last year at the NCAAs," he said
Tuesday. But after a brief pause
he added, "That may not be
enough."
Following what Brennan
termed a "down year" for
women's collegiate tennis, 1988
promises to showcase more talent.
A strong freshman class has con
tributed greatly to many pro

grams, including USC, UCLA and
California, all of whom Brennan
says have a legitimate shot at the
national title.
But no complaints will be heard
out of this neck of the woods.
Freshman production should be
at a maximum at Stanford. "I'll
take my three freshmen over all
the other freshmen out there,"
Brennan said.
The Cardinal's three freshmen
— Tami Whitlinger, Sandra Birch
and Teri Whitlinger — will start
the season at No. 2, No. 4 and
No. 5 in the lineup, respectively.
Tami Whitlinger has won
singles titles in two tournaments
already this season and has been
seeded No. 1 in three tourna
ments.
Birch struggled in the early
season tournaments but has
recently impressed her coach.
"She's exciting," Brennan said.
"She's probably the most aggres
sive player we have."
Teri Whitlinger is good enough
to play higher in the lineup, but
she realizes that the Cardinal is
loaded. "On any given day, the
top five can beat each other," she
said.
Stanford's abundance of talent
has been recognized as the Car
dinal is the preseason No. 1 team
in the nation, according to the
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches

Association.
Brennan, usually wary of the
rankings, agrees with the ITCA's
assessment. "I think we should
probably be at No. 1 'til someone
knocks us off," he said.
And Brennan's players are op
timistic also. "We feel real confi
dent that we have the capability
and potential to win it (the title)
again," Teri Whitlinger said.
"Hopefully we'll keep everybody
healthy."
Health is a familiar concern for
the Cardinal. Last year the team
recovered from a season full of
injuries just in time to capture
the championship.
Junior Eleni Rossides, who
missed over a year because of
stress fractures in both shins, is
back in action and appears to be
near the top of her game. After
returning to the lineup in May
last season, she played at No. 5
at the NCAA championships, but
this season she will start off at
No. 1.
Rossides earned the right to
replace two-time defending NCAA
singles champion Patty Fendick
at the top of the lineup by de
feating Tami Whitlinger in a chal
lenge match last week. "It (the
No. 1 spot) came down to the
challenge match," Brennan said.
"Tami beat Eleni (in the final of
the fall Rolex tournament), but

since then they've both done well."
Rossides has already won a
tournament this season, captur
ing the 1988 National Collegiate
Tennis Classic singles title.
Senior Cari Hagey, who missed
the second half of last season and
the NCAA championships, also
appears to be healthy again, al
though she currently finds herself
only listed in the doubles lineup.
Doubles is her forte, however, and
she and Birch could be the Car
dinal's top tandem.
Kay Tittle, the team's other
senior, has been ailed by bad
knees throughout her Stanford
career and recently had arthro
scopic surgery to clean out both
knees. Tittle has played well since
the surgery, but she is scheduled
to play only in the singles lineup
(at No. 6) at the outset of the
season.
"We can't count on her to play
two matches (singles and doubles
in the same day)," Brennan said
of Tittle, who in the past has been
one of the Cardinal's most accom
plished doubles performers. "She
can play every day. The problem
is two matches."
Lisa Green, who was a surpris
ing semifinalist at last year's
NCAA singles tournament, is one
of the best, if not the best, player
in the nation positioned in the
No. 3 spot in her team's lineup.

Along with her teammate Terl Whltlinger, Sandra Birch was one of
two freshmen who won their Stanford debuts yesterday against
Pacific. Today Birch will play the No. 2 spot for the Cardinal in a
1:30 p.m. home match against Fresno State.

Pacific. Today Birch will play the No. 2 spot for the Cardinal in a
1:30 p.m. home match against Fresno State.

Stanford women's
ten nis Coach
Frank Brennan
never lets success
get too far away
from him. Adorn
ing his office walls

are photographs of the many Ail-
Americans he has coached and the
teams he has led to the NCAA
title.
The most recent addition to his
collection is a clock presented to
him by the members of last year's
national champion team. The in
scription reads, "No doubs" — al
luding to last May's NCAA team
tournament, when the Cardinal
overpowered the rest of the field,
clinching each of its four matches
before the doubles competition.
Brennan has some bad news for
his adversaries heading into the
1988 season. "I think we very pos
sibly could be as good as we were
last year at the NCAAs," he said
Tuesday. But after a brief pause
he added, "That may not be
enough."
Following what Brennan
termed a "down year" for
women's collegiate tennis, 1988
promises to showcase more talent.
A strong freshman class has con
tributed greatly to many pro

grams, including USC, UCLA and
California, all of whom Brennan
says have a legitimate shot at the
national title.
But no complaints will be heard
out of this neck of the woods.
Freshman production should be
at a maximum at Stanford. "I'll
take my three freshmen over all
the other freshmen out there,"
Brennan said.
The Cardinal's three freshmen
— Tami Whitlinger, Sandra Birch
and Teri Whitlinger — will start
the season at No. 2, No. 4 and
No. 5 in the lineup, respectively.
Tami Whitlinger has won
singles titles in two tournaments
already this season and has been
seeded No. 1 in three tourna
ments.
Birch struggled in the early
season tournaments but has
recently impressed her coach.
"She's exciting," Brennan said.
"She's probably the most aggres
sive player we have."
Teri Whitlinger is good enough
to play higher in the lineup, but
she realizes that the Cardinal is
loaded. "On any given day, the
top five can beat each other," she
said.
Stanford's abundance of talent
has been recognized as the Car
dinal is the preseason No. 1 team
in the nation, according to the
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches

Association.
Brennan, usually wary of the
rankings, agrees with the ITCA's
assessment. "I think we should
probably be at No. 1 'til someone
knocks us off," he said.
And Brennan's players are op
timistic also. "We feel real confi
dent that we have the capability
and potential to win it (the title)
again," Teri Whitlinger said.
"Hopefully we'll keep everybody
healthy."
Health is a familiar concern for
the Cardinal. Last year the team
recovered from a season full of
injuries just in time to capture
the championship.
Junior Eleni Rossides, who
missed over a year because of
stress fractures in both shins, is
back in action and appears to be
near the top of her game. After
returning to the lineup in May
last season, she played at No. 5
at the NCAA championships, but
this season she will start off at
No. 1.
Rossides earned the right to
replace two-time defending NCAA
singles champion Patty Fendick
at the top of the lineup by de
feating Tami Whitlinger in a chal
lenge match last week. "It (the
No. 1 spot) came down to the
challenge match," Brennan said.
"Tami beat Eleni (in the final of
the fall Rolex tournament), but

since then they've both done well."
Rossides has already won a
tournament this season, captur
ing the 1988 National Collegiate
Tennis Classic singles title.
Senior Cari Hagey, who missed
the second half of last season and
the NCAA championships, also
appears to be healthy again, al
though she currently finds herself
only listed in the doubles lineup.
Doubles is her forte, however, and
she and Birch could be the Car
dinal's top tandem.
Kay Tittle, the team's other
senior, has been ailed by bad
knees throughout her Stanford
career and recently had arthro
scopic surgery to clean out both
knees. Tittle has played well since
the surgery, but she is scheduled
to play only in the singles lineup
(at No. 6) at the outset of the
season.
"We can't count on her to play
two matches (singles and doubles
in the same day)," Brennan said
of Tittle, who in the past has been
one of the Cardinal's most accom
plished doubles performers. "She
can play every day. The problem
is two matches."
Lisa Green, who was a surpris
ing semifinalist at last year's
NCAA singles tournament, is one
of the best, if not the best, player
in the nation positioned in the
No. 3 spot in her team's lineup.
