To the victors
belong the spoils.
The nation's
top five return
ing players, a
number of at
large selections

based on national rankings, and
the finalists of nine regional
qualifying tournaments this fall
have all been invited to partic
ipate in the men's tennis Rolex
National Indoor Intercollegiate
Tennis Championships today
through Sunday at 98th Street
Racquet Club in Minneapolis.

Stanford's David Wheaton,
JefT Tarango, Patrick McEnroe
and Curtis Dunn were picked
to compete in the outstanding
32-man field. Wheaton, who is
still hampered by an injured left
wrist, did not make the trip.
The Cardinal team of McEnroe-
Tarango will enter the doubles
competition.
Tarango, 19th-ranked nation
ally and currently 0-3 on the
season, faces Georgia's Chris
Garner in the opening round
today at 9 a.m.
"Jeffs had the misfortune of
playing against three players
that match up very well with
him," Stanford Coach Dick

Gould said. "This competition
is like a mini-NCAA tournament
and I look for him to play well.
The San Jose State match (a
three-set loss to Malcolm Allen)
got him back on the right
track."
McEnroe, who skipped the
San Jose State match and has
started the season 1-1 for the
Cardinal, takes on Michigan's
Malivai Washington in another
9 a.m. match.
Dunn, who won the NorCal
Rolex Regional National Indoor
qualifying tournament this fall,
tackles No. 7 seed Johan Donar
of Miami, Fla., at 1:30.
