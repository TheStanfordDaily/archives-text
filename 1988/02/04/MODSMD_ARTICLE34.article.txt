# Women's golf places eighth
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
Plagued by inexpe
rience and a very
trying course, the
Stanford women's
golf team finished
eighth out of 12
teams at this

week's Yamaha-USC Invitational
at the Industry Hills Resort Golf
Course in Los Angeles.
"It was a combination of the
most difficult course I've ever
seen and four inexperienced
players," Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin said of his team's un
characteristic performance.
The team's three-day total of
1,000 might seem high, but the
winning score, a 944 by defending
NCAA Champion San Jose State,
was a full 30 strokes above the
winning score at last fall's Stan
ford Intercollegiate, and, accord
ing to Baldwin, the Stanford
course is among the five toughest
collegiate courses in the country.
Tulsa was a close second to the

Spartans at 950, with Arizona
State in third another seven
strokes back. Texas, led by 1986
U.S. Amateur champion and
medalist Michiko Hattori,
finished fourth with 971, with
U.S. International a distant fifth
at 988.
New Mexico missed the top five
by one stroke, with USC in
seventh at 993. Stanford and New
Mexico State tied for eighth, and
SMU's 1018 rounded out the top
ten.
Baldwin, while a bit disap
pointed with his team's perform
ance, took this tournament as a
lesson and an opportunity for his
team to gain more experience
before the Pac-10 and NCAA
Championships in April and May.
"I think our young team learned
a lot on that course," he said.
Baldwin brought three fresh
men and one sophomore to com
plement senior Kay Cornelius on
the trip down south. But while
Cornelius struggled freshman
sensation Jodi Figley found a
groove and finished tenth with a

three-day total of 240. In each of
the three tournaments she has
played Figley has finished in the
top ten.
"I could've done better, but
overall I'm happy," she said.
Her scores Tuesday and yester
day (84 and 81, respectively) were
not quite the sizzling 75 she put
together on Monday, but she has
gone through some mtyor swing
changes over the past three
months and this was the first real
test of those changes. "Sometimes
I just didn't feel comfortable
standing over the ball," she said.
Her lOth-place 240 was 14
strokes behind Michiko Hattori of
Texas, who Baldwin calls "The
finest amateur in the world."
ASU's Pearl Sinn did her best to
keep pace with Hattori, but fell
two strokes short and took
second. Michelle Wooding of New
Mexico was a close third with 229,
and Dana Lofland of San Jose
State (232) and Tulsa's Melissa
McNamara (236) rounded out the
top five.
