The public's battle against the media's "mis
shaping of the news" will only be won with an
increase in public skepticism, according to Pro
gressive magazine Editor Erwin Knoll.
Knoll spoke last night to an audience at the
History Corner on the ability of the media to
manipulate individuals' opinions about important
issues. He said one of the main reasons the
reader is manipulated by the media is that the
media is a business pursuing maximum profit.
The commodity sold "is you (the reader) to
advertisers," Knoll said. If news attracts a
wealthy readership, then it will make larger prof
its.
"Everyone pursues self-interest," Knoll
stressed, "including the media." In this manner
the news engages in "surpression" of any infor
mation which might turn readers away.
"If you understand this (process), you won't
let the news wash over you in waves. You'll ask
who's telling you what, and why," he said. When

asked what specific advice he has for Stanford
students, Knoll replied, "Students shouldn't allow
themselves to get suckered."
As a young reporter in Washington D.C., Knoll
witnessed first-hand the "willing collaboration
between the media and government officials" on
what to print as well as what not to print.
He recalled how it often required only a simple
request by officials to keep information from
being printed. "I was shocked by it,"he added.
The notion of publicly accepted "secrecy and
suppression of information" Knoll said, "is a
fairly recent phenomenom." He said he believes
the present practice of secrecy grew out of the
Cold War when America expanded U.S. influence
around the world, and Sen. Joe McCarthy
generated hysteria over loss of secrecy to the
Soviets.
As editor of the Progressive for the past 14
years, Knoll stressed the publication's commit
ment to keeping the "native, radical American
tradition alive" and promoting social justice.
