# Profs, square off on Western Culture

Claiming that the core reading
list in Western Culture tracks has
become "an albatross around
Stanford's neck," Philosophy
Prof. John Perry said the proposal
by the Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies to drop the core list
and establish a new requirement
called "Culture, Ideas and Values"
will bring "fresh blood" to a pro
gram plagued by rigidity and im
mobility.
The discussion last night with
Perry and English Prof. William
Chace, sponsored jointly by Casa
Zapata and MEChA, the Chicano
student organization, reworked
much of the current debate about
Western Culture.
Though the issues might be
tired, interest was high, as the 80
member audience fired questions
for over two hours.
The talk focused mainly on the
question of the core list. Perry, a
member of the Western Culture
Task Force, claimed the list
fosters the opinion that works by
women and minorities are of no
consequence. "Some very intelli
gent students here honestly be
lieve that if a work on the core
list is replaced by a work by a
woman or a minority, then it is

'In 10 years there
hasn't been one
change (in the core
list), and there's
been constant carp
ing. This isn't
working.'

replaced by a work of in
ferior quality. It is making a state
ment I don't want to make," he
said.
Chace stuck by a counter
proposal that would retain the
idea of a core list in the Western
Culture requirement while allow
ing revision of the works included
in the list. This alternative pro
posal is strongly backed by many
members of the English depart
ment.
The task force proposal, with
its removal of the core list, does
not entail a scrapping of the cur
rent program, Perry claimed. "It
is a modification of the course in
ways that it needs to be modified.
The core list is only one list that
we could have come up with (in
1980 when the Western Culture
requirement was instituted). In
10 years there hasn't been one
change, and there's been constant
carping. This isn't working."
In contrast to Chace's concern
about the possible "atomization,"
or splitting, of the program if the
core list is lost, Perry's main
worry involved rigidity and im
mobility in the existing program.
"What it needs is some fresh blood
— get some new faculty in there,"
he said.
According to Chace, looking at
the course as filled with
"DWEMs," or dead, white,
European males, is not effective.
"Marx was not chosen because
Marx was white," he stated. Perry
concurred, saying that critical ex
amination of primary texts was
the main thrust of the original
program. "But there are many
roots of contemporary American
society, and we simply did not
face up to that fact in the
program's formation."
Chace said the present program
contains enough flexibility: Lec
turers are free to include works
they might see as important, but
the "spinal stability" of the core

list must be maintained if the
course is to preserve its coher
ence.
"It has a strong center, but
plenty of free running room," he
claimed, noting that he often in
cluded works by Ralph Ellison and
Virginia Woolf in his Western Cul
ture classes. "I think I've ob
served the spirit of including
works by ethnic minorities and
women."
The current structure of the
program also gives students a
common intellectual experience,
he said. "That's the reason there

is a core list." Without it, he
claimed the course would be
"ripped apart" with "faculty
members each following their fa
vorite line."
"I also value a common ex
perience," Perry said, "but there
isn't that common intellectual ex
perience now, it's an illusion."
Senior Rudy Fuentes agreed
and added that "bringing in new
works may bring about the dis
cussion we want. What's not being
dropped is the works, it's the
canon. The works can stand on
their own two feet."
