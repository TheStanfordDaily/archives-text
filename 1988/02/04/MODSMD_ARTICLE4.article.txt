# Profs, square off on Western Culture

Claiming that the core reading
list in Western Culture tracks has
become "an albatross around
Stanford's neck," Philosophy
Prof. John Perry said the proposal
by the Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies to drop the core list
and establish a new requirement
called "Culture, Ideas and Values"
will bring "fresh blood" to a pro
gram plagued by rigidity and im
mobility.
The discussion last night with
Perry and English Prof. William
Chace, sponsored jointly by Casa
Zapata and MEChA, the Chicano
student organization, reworked
much of the current debate about
Western Culture.
Though the issues might be
tired, interest was high, as the 80
member audience fired questions
for over two hours.
The talk focused mainly on the
question of the core list. Perry, a
member of the Western Culture
Task Force, claimed the list
fosters the opinion that works by
women and minorities are of no
consequence. "Some very intelli
gent students here honestly be
lieve that if a work on the core
list is replaced by a work by a
woman or a minority, then it is

'In 10 years there
hasn't been one
change (in the core
list), and there's
been constant carp
ing. This isn't
working.'

replaced by a work of in
ferior quality. It is making a state
ment I don't want to make," he
said.
Chace stuck by a counter
proposal that would retain the
idea of a core list in the Western
Culture requirement while allow
ing revision of the works included
in the list. This alternative pro
posal is strongly backed by many
members of the English depart
ment.
The task force proposal, with
its removal of the core list, does
not entail a scrapping of the cur
rent program, Perry claimed. "It
is a modification of the course in
ways that it needs to be modified.
