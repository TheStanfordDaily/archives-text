## Katchadourian kicks off winter Jing Lyman Lecture Series

"Sex for the young is like a four
wheel drive," according to Psychi
atry Prof. Herant Katchadourian.
"It goes anywhere, but you get a
humpy ride. [At an older age] it
becomes a smoother ride, but you
have to stay on the road."
Katchadourian spoke to a
capacity crowd of over 300 yes
terday at Fairchild Auditorium
about "Sex and Intimacy in Mid-
Life," launching the winter Jing
Lyman Lecture Series that will
explore "Love and Sex."
Katchadourian is considered
somewhat of a celebrity on
campus for his Human Biology
course, "Human Sexuality,"
which has attracted over 10,000
students in its 16-year history.
Last night's lecture jumped
from such diverse subjects as
marital relations to a slide show
which included a nude slide of
Raquel Welch. "If you want to
look like this at 42, you have to
start by looking like this at 20,"
he said.
Katchadourian, well-known for
his wit, kept the crowd laughing
throughout the hour-long speech.
He termed all the difficulties one

goes through just to arrive at
sexual intercourse as "a very long
climb for a very short slide."
He commented that women are
having more children before the
age of 15 and after the age of 35.
"We have grandparents now who
could be from 35 to 75," he said.
During the question and answer
period, he was asked about male
menopause. "There is no male
climacteric in the sense of a sharp
drop in hormones ... as a con
frontation with mid-life psycho
logical review, yes absolutely," he
answered.
There were very few students
in the crowd. Sherrie Matteo, as
sociate director of the Institute
for Research on Women and
Gender, which sponsored the
event, said that at most of the
series' lectures, about half of the
audience is made up of students.
She explained that because of the
location of the lecture and the
topic, students shied away.
The lecture series, which has
been running for 12 years, has a
budget of over $3,000 per quarter.
According to Matteo, the series is
named after former Stanford Uni
versity President Richard
Lyman's wife, who was a strong
supporter of the Institute for Re

search on Women and Gender.
One of the major questions
raised in the speech involved com
munication between couples.
When asked what he thought of
the recent increase of sex talk
shows, Katchadourian said he had
"mixed feelings."
"Programs like that put the
subject on people's agenda ... it
becomes the impetus to talk about
it,"he said.
