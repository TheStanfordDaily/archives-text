# Stanford stuns No. 1 Arizona
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
A loud, rollicking bomb ex
ploded on the Maples Pavilion
floor last night.
When the carnage was cleared,
the No. 1 Arizona Wildcats got
charred and the Stanford Cardi
nal stomped the previously 20-1
'Cats into a burial coffin right
there on the hardwood.
The upstart Stanford team took
control of a 74-74 ballgame with
five minutes left and slowly, nail
by excruciating nail, shut the door
on the Wildcats.
Yes, this is the correct score:
Stanford 82, Arizona 74.
Not since 1942, when Stanford
won the NCAA championship, has
the Cardinal seized the national
basketball limelight. But after a
stunning whitewash of the
Wildcats in the last 300 seconds
of the game, every television set
and radio in the nation is blaring
the words "Stanford" and "as
tounding upset" in the same sen
tence.
In front of a tremendously vocal
sell-out crowd of 7,500, the Car
dinal held a powerful Arizona of
fense without a point in the final
five minutes and used an electric
tip-in by center Greg Butler with
1:17 left in the game to slash only
the second blemish onto the
Wildcat record this season.
Arizona falls to 20-2 overall, 9-1
in the Pacific 10 conference, while
Stanford moves to 14-7, 6-4. The
Cardinal hosts Arizona State to
morrow at 3 p.m.
Fiery performances by Stan
ford's two clutch men, guard Todd
Lichti and Howard Wright, fueled
the Cardinal triumph. Lichti
poured in 23 points, including 15
take-charge points in the second
half, and Wright scored 22 and
yanked down nine rebounds.
"Wright and Lichti are our two
thoroughbreds," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said after the
game. "We look for them down
the stretch and they came
through tonight."
Swashbuckling buckets by
Lichti and offensive rebounds by
Wright kept Stanford in the game
down the stretch, but it was But
ler's tip-in that was the ultimate
blow.
Leading 75-74 with 1:38
remaining, Stanford worked their

offense until Lichti took an open
jumper which rimmed out. Wright
somehow got the offensive
rebound and put up a shot off
the glass.
And when the ball began mean
dering away from the hoop, But
ler's right hand nudged it back
onto a swishing path.
"All I saw was this big white
hand tip it in," Wright said.
When Arizona's all-world Sean
Elliott missed the front end of a
one-and-one free-throw situation
with 59 seconds left, doom des
cended on Wildcat country.
Stanford sank five out of six
free throws in the final minute
to seal the victory. And when the
scoreboard clock read :00, the en
tire student section swarmed and
stomped on the Maples floor in
celebration.
"I was just out of my mind
when I heard (the crowd count
down) three, two, one, and then
I just dropped the ball and hugged
Howard," a jubilant Lichti said
afterward. "Howard gave me a big
bear hug. It was near death down
there (in the celebration crowd)."
Stanford spent most of the
night trying to avoid death.
Arizona repeatedly opened up
four- to nine-point leads, but the
Cardinal players never let the
margin balloon up to double
digits.
"The thing I'm most proud of
is that the kids never backed off,"
Montgomery said. "We stayed
after it all night — we wanted to
give ourselves a chance to win it."
Montgomery and his players
repeatedly mentioned the
vociferous crowd as a big factor
in the game.
"The crowd came in and really
made a difference. They pushed
us over the edge," Montgomery
said.
"The crowd really picked us
up," Cardinal forward Bryan
McSweeney said. "We expect a lot
from ourselves, and to have the
crowd come out and do this for
two hours. ..."
McSweeney had the unenviable
task of guarding Elliott, who
doesn't yet have a nickname, but
certainly would be worthy of the
moniker "Cobra." Elliott
repeatedly got the ball about 18
feet from the hoop and swayed
hypnotically back and forth.
And then he struck, usually on

mind when I heard

down) three, two,
one, and then I just
dropped the ball and

gliding drives that ended in slams
or layups. Elliott had 14 points
at halftime and four assists to his
fellow big men Tom Tolbert and
Anthony Cook.
But the tag team of McSweeney
and freshman Andrew Vlahov
held Elliott to a 4-for-10 shooting
performance in the second half.
Without Elliott in the clutch,
Arizona looked lost.
"Usually at crunch time we
have five people we go to and this
time all five came up empty," El
liott said afterwards.
Perhaps Arizona knew they
were in for a rough night when
they picked up seven fouls in the
first eight minutes. Even though
the referees were calling the game
tight and the Arizona players
were the victims, the Wildcats
took a 24-15 lead midway through
the First half.
As they did several times
throughout the night, however,
Stanford responded with clutch
hoops that kept the contest within
reach. After Lichti hit two free
throws, Vlahov made a dazzling,
blind left-handed tip-in after a
missed Lichti layup to cut the
lead to 24-19.
Arizona made another run with
two minutes left when Elliott
sank a lean-in banker and point
guard Steve Kerr hit a long 3-
point shot to put the Wildcats on
top 41-35.
But before Arizona could sigh,
Cardinal point guard Terry Taylor
responded with a rainbow trifecta
of his own. The teams then traded
hoops and Arizona led at halftime
43-40.
Things stayed about even until
Elliott rattled the rim on a

baseline dunk, and then Mont

foul for arguing with the referees.
Steve Kerr hit both free throws,
Arizona led 58-52 and the mo
mentum was on the Wildcat side.
Stanford responded with great
passing that led to a Wright layup
and a half-hook by Butler plus a
free throw to cut the margin to
60-57 with 12 minutes left.

Arizona later had a chance to
build on a 67-62 lead but couldn't
capitalize. So Lichti and Wright
went to work. Wright scored on
a goaltending call by Elliott and
Lichti scored on a power baseline
move and was fouled. He hit the
free throw and the game was
deadlocked 67-67.
Stanford got a surprise clutch
effort with 6:40 remaining.
Reserve point guard Scott Meinert
traded a jumper and a gutsy 3-
pointer with Elliott and Kerr.
Lichti and Kerr then traded

jumpers to make the score 74-74
and set up the whitewash.
Even in the waning moments
of the contest, the Cardinal
players refused to let down their
guard.
"In practice we did a drill where
we were up by four points with
2 minutes left and it felt good,"
McSweeney said. "But it wasn't
until there was about 30 seconds
left and we were up by four with
Butler shooting (free throws) that
I said '.Jesus Christ, we're going
to win this.' "
