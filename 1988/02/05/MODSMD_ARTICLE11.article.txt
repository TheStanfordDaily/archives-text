Iraqi planes set tanker ablaze
MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) — Iraqi warplancs
set an Iraniun tanker ablaze in the Persian
Gulf, and a Greek-owned freighter crippled by
Iranian gunboats sank while under tow yes
terday in seas churned by a fierce sandstorm.
The 15,241-ton freighter Mare, registered
in Panama, went down in about 60 feet of
water off Jebel Ali in the United Arab
Emirates, salvage executives said. It had been
set afire in the attack Saturday in the northern
gulf, and the crew abandoned ship.
Iraq's raid on the tanker was its 18th on
Iranian shipping since Jan. 1 and the first
this month. More than 450 ships have been
attacked by both sides since the Iran-Iraq war
began in September 1980.
In London, Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence
Unit identified the target as the 25,651-ton
Mokran, owned by the Iranian government
tanker company.
It is one of the vessels that carry oil from
the huge Kharg Island oil terminal, which
Iraq bombs regularly, to makeshift terminals
in safer waters about 450 miles down the gulf.
N. Korea tied to jet bombing
WASHINGTON - U.S. officials unveiled
detailed evidence yesterday linking the bomb
ing of a South Korean airliner to North Korean
officials and told Congress they believe that
Kim Jong 11, the son and heir apparent of
North Korean President Kim II Sung, was
responsible.
At a House subcommittee hearing, State
Department officials said the United States
has confirmed the account of Kim Hyon Hui,
the North Korean woman who recently
confessed in Seoul that she had carried out
the terrorist action. They said Ms. Kim, 26,
had identified two men who helped her in the
bombing, and that both men were North
Korean agents.
In a separate interview, a U.S. official told
the Los Angeles Times that the November
bombing of a Korean Air Lines jetliner, which
killed 115 people, may have been"the luck-off
of a larger program of violent actions" through
which North Korea aims to undermine the
Summer Olympics in Seoul.
"They want to throw fear into people so
they won't go to South Korea," said this U.S.
official, a government analyst who spoke on
condition that he would not be identified.
Mecham impeachment likely
PHOENIX, Ariz. — As Gov. Evan Mecham
testified for a third day before an Arizona
House select committee considering his im
peachment, ranking House members said yes
terday that impeachment is almost a certainty.
Members estimated that about 41 represen
tatives will vote for impeachment. Only 31
votes are needed from the 60-member body
to force the governor to appear before the
state Senate for an impeachment trial.
"I don't have the exact count on the vote,
but my sense of walking down the halls is
that he's gone," said House Speaker Joe Lane
of Wilcox, who is a Republican, as is Mecham.
Lane said there were about 25 "no" votes
that wouldn't change if someone brought "a
dead body in here" but there was a clear
majority opposing the Republican governor.
If the governor is impeached, he will retain
his office but will be precluded from function
ing as the state's chief adminstrator.
The charges against him would go to the
Senate for trial where the 30 senators will
serve as the jury. A two-thirds vote is required
to remove Mecham from office.
House Majority Whip Jane Hull and
Majority Leader Jim Ratliff, also Republicans,
and Minority Leader Art Hamilton, a Demo
crat, agreed impeachment is pretty much as
sured.
