# Noriega indicted for drug trafficking
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Reagan ad
ministration has decided to go ahead
with drug indictments against
Panamanian military leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega despite concerns that
he might retaliate against U.S. inter
ests, officials said yesterday.
Administration officials considered
the possibility that Noriega, whose in
dictment is expected to be announced
in Florida today, might seek reprisals
but have concluded it is unlikely he
would make a major move against the
Panama Canal or other sensitive U.S.
facilities in Panama, they said.
Federal law enforcement officials
said Noriega was indicted yesterday
by federal grand juries in Miami and
Tampa, Fla., on charges of racketeer
ing, cocaine trafficking and money
laundering. The indictments, which
have been long expected, were sealed
by a federal magistrate, but the U.S.
attorneys in the two cities scheduled
announcements for today.

Officials said one of the indictments
focuses in part on Noriega's dealings
with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who
reportedly mediated a 1984 business
dispute between the Panamanian and
members of a Colombian drug cartel.
Noriega was quoted by CBS News
as dismissing the indictment as
"strictly political."
Noriega, who leads Panama's na
tional guard, has turned himself into
a virtual dictator in his strategic
country, which includes the 48-mile
long canal between the Atlantic and
Pacific.
In secret studies prepared before the
decision, the State Department and
CIA laid out a range of possible
Panamanian reactions to the indict
ments, from an anti-Noriega coup by
military dissidents to political reprisals
by Noriega against U.S. military and
diplomatic facilities in the nation.
But in the end, a knowledgeable in
telligence source said, the most likely

immediate reaction was judged to be:
"Nothing."
The U.S.-Panama extradition treaty
does not require Panama to arrest or
extradite Noriega, and the general
could simply defy the indictments and
attempt to hang onto power, officials
said.
The public charges against Noriega
are expected to intensify public senti
ment against the military strongman,
they said, but the main question —
as before — is whether other
Panamanian officers will decide "to
dump the guy," in the words of one
State Department official.
The Reagan administration has been
urging Noriega to quit for months, to
no avail. Secretary of State George
Shultz publicly called on the general
to "step back" from power, and a
senior Department of Defense official
told Noriega privately that the Penta
gon also wanted a new government.
But Noriega, who has been accused

of assassinating political opponents,
massive corruption and providing in
formation simultaneously to the CIA
and Communist Cuba, has stubbornly
refused to relinquish power. He has
denounced the U.S. pressure against
him as a "rightist plot" to prepare the
way for an American seizure of the
canal, which was turned over to
Panama in a treaty negotiated by Pres
ident Carter and ratified in 1978.
Under the treaty, Panama acquired
sovereignty over the canal, but the
United States retained rights to
manage and defend the waterway until
Dec. 31, 1999.
The United States has about 10,000
troops in Panama, primarily for the
defense of the canaj. Panama is also
the headquarters of the U.S. Southern
Command, which coordinates all U.S.
military activity in Latin America.
