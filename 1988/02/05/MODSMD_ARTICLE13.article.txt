# Dole confronts Bush on campaign charges
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The bitter cam
paign for the GOP presidential nom
ination moved from lowa to the floor
of the Senate yesterday where an
angry Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., con
fronted Vice President Bush over
charges made by Bush's lowa cam
paign chairman that the senator's
career showed a pattern of "mean
spiritedness" and "cronyism."
The unusual exchange of words on
the Senate floor, during a procedural
vote on aid to the Nicaraguan Contras,
was the third time in less than a day
that Dole, described by aides as
"steaming mad" over the charges, has
demanded that Bush disavow state
ments of his lowa chair and apologize.
The senator, in a news conference

after the confrontations, added a
charge of his own: that the Bush cam
paign was involved in publicizing a
House committee staff investigation
into the award of a controversial gov
ernment contract to a former Dole
aide. Bush spokesman Peter Teeley
denied that allegation, and Bush's
campaign director, Lee Atwater, said,
"(The day before) yesterday, the Dole
campaign was blaming The Washing
ton Post and the Democratic Party.
Now they have thrown us into the
mix. The fact of the matter is this
campaign had nothing to do with any
of this."
The Bush campaign's charges of
cronyism by Dole came a day after the
staff of the House Small Business

Committee issued a preliminary report
in which it cited numerous "appear
ances of improper activities" in a $26
million Army contract. Dole's office
worked to help a former aide, John
Palmer, obtain the contract through
the Small Business Administration
(SBA).

The committee recommended the
Justice Department investigate it. Dole
has denied any direct involvement, but
a former SBA official this week said
he had been told the senator had made
at least one phone call on behalf of
Palmer.
