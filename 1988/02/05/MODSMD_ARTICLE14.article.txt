# Attack kills 2 Israelis
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — In the second
such attack in two weeks, Pales
tinian guerrillas infiltrated Israeli
defenses on the Lebanese border
yesterday and killed two Israeli
soldiers. One of the guerrillas was
killed and another captured.
The border firefight came as
other Israeli troops struggled
through another day of trying to
keep order in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, an effort
that left at least four demonstra
tors wounded by gunfire, includ
ing a 10-year-old boy, and three
others hospitalized from rubber
bullets.
The attack, mounted from what
is supposed to be an Israeli
controlled "security zone" in
southern Lebanon, occurred just
before dawn near Yiftah, an
agricultural kibbutz just east of
the Lebanon border and about
five miles south of Kiryat
Shemona in the Galilee pan
handle.
According to an army spokes
woman, a paratrooper patrol de
tected a hole in the barbed-wire
topped electrified fence that
marks the frontier at about 4 a.m.
She said the guerrillas evidently
intended to attack a kibbutz and
take hostages.
As the soldiers checked the
area, a rocket from a shoulder
held missile launcher struck a
jeep, destroying the vehicle, kil
ling one trooper outright and

wounding two others, the spokes
woman said. A second Israeli died
later in a hospital.
Other soldiers searched the
area, she said, and wounded and
captured one of the guerrillas,
who quickly indicated that there
were others nearby. The spokes
woman said a second guerrilla was
chased down and, after an ex
change of grenades, was shot and
killed. A third raider evidently es
caped into Lebanon.
Another army spokesman said
a Russian-designed Katyusha
rocket was fired from the security
zone into Israel near Kiryat
Shemona.
Yesterday's fight was a near
replica of a Jan. 20 guerrilla effort
to raid across the border, when a
battle left three guerrillas and an
Israeli soldier dead.
An even earlier border raid in
the same area, on Nov. 25,
resulted in the deaths of six Israeli
soldiers and one Palestinian when
guerrillas using motorized hang
gliders crossed the fence and at
tacked an army base near Kiryat
Shemona.
All three incidents raised
several questions, including the
capability of the Israeli military
and its ally, the South Lebanon
Army — a Christian-dominated
but Israeli-financed and -trained
militia — to successfully police
the security zone.
