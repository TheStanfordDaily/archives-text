# MX budget cuts planned
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon's
original fiscal 1989 budget plan for the
MX missile, long a centerpiece of the
Reagan administration's strategic
modernization program, will be cut al
most in half under a proposal approved
by Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci,
Pentagon officials said yesterday.
The proposal will request funding for
12 MX missiles, instead of the 21
originally sought, as part of the Defense
Department's budget plan for next year,
which will be sent to the White House
today. The MX request represents a
savings of at least $400 million for the
Pentagon, which has come under in
creasing pressure to cut spending to
lower the federal deficit.
"The general assumption was that 12
missiles was about as much as we were
going to get from Congress," one Pen
tagon official said. "We're looking at
reality, and this is the first year that
the (Defense) Department has been
really closed in a vise."
Carlucci's pared-back MX plan reflects
a marked departure from the fiscal strat
egy employed by his predecessor, Caspar
Weinberger, who doggedly clung to the
administration's budgetary plans in the
face of strong congressional opposition.
Since 1983, when the Pentagon began
seeking funds to build the missile, Wein
berger's MX requests were consistently
slashed on Capitol Hill, sometimes in
half.
The administration is seeking an ul

timate arsenal of 100 MXs, which are
intercontinental ballistic missiles that
have pinpoint accuracy. The Air Force
already has deployed 33 missiles in silos
at Warren Air Force Base outside of
Cheyenne, Wyo., and plans to put an
other 17 in such dug-in shelters.
Congress, fearing that the silos leave
the missiles open to counterattack, has
told the Air Force that it would not
approve the deployment of more than
50 additional MXs until the Pentagon
finds an acceptable alternative to the
current basing system.
Monday, Cariucci said that he favors
a plan to base the entire 100-missile
force on railcars. The defense secretary
told the Senate Armed Services Com
mittee that the missiles "ought to be
taken out of fixed silos and put on a
mobile system," where he argued that
they would be less vulnerable to a Soviet
nuclear attack.
But Carlucci's remarks about a
revised basing plan for the MX, coupled
with the reduced budget request, could
backfire and serve only to harm the
missile program. Among some law
makers, these changes have raised
doubts about the general direction and
effectiveness of the weapons program.
Pentagon officials insist that Cariucci
and the administration remain commit
ted to fielding a system of 100 MX mis
siles.
