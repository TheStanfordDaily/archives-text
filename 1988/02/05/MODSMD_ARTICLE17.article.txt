## Rush needs limits 
### 
FOR TWO YEARS in a row,
fraternity Rush has resulted
in tragedy — a death last
year and a near death the year
before — both due to the influence
of alcohol. When the Interfrater
nity Council last week rejected a
dry Rush proposal, it showed a
refusal to recognize dangers
created by Rush. The University
must step in and mandate a dry
rush for all open Rush parties.
When a freshman suffered a col
lapsed lung in an alcohol-induced
fight at a Rush party two years
ago, the IFC set new guidelines
for last year's Rush. Rushees were
cautioned about alcohol abuse and
had to obtain Rush cards that were
to be checked upon entrance to
any Rush open house. Rush parties
were limited to fraternity mem
bers, rushees and Rush hostesses.
For the first and third weeks of
Rush, official parties were to run
no later than 11:30 p.m.
The guidelines also limited alco
holic beverages served during the
first week of Rush to beer and
wine, while the second week was
to be completely dry, and hard al
cohol could be served the third
week. These regulations seemed to
be reasonable, if not lenient, in
light of the proceeding year's
event.
Whatever high hopes the Uni
versity had for last year's Rush
were destroyed by the death of
David Dunshee, a junior and a
member of the now disbanded Zeta
Psi fraternity. Dunshee, under the
influence of alcohol, drowned in
Lake Lagunita.
While this event in itself consti
tutes a compelling argument for
Rush to be dry, the IFC showed
last year it could not enforce its
own regulations. Rush cards were
rarely, if ever, checked. All types
of alcohol flowed freely past 11:30
p.m.

The IFC had its chance. For two
years, fraternities have proved that
they are not dedicated or respon
sible enough to enforce their own
regulations.
Last week the IFC — at the
same meeting where it rejected a
dry Rush — abandoned its Rush
card policy. The willingness to
abandon the requirement so
readily showed a lack of dedication
on the part of the IFC to even
seek control over party attendance.
The University has a duty, as
an institution with a vested inter
est in the welfare of its students,
to mandate and enforce a dry Rush
for all open parties.
An alcohol-free atmosphere al
lows students to make informed
and rational choices about which
fraternity is right for them. If fra
ternities feel that they can per
suade a student to join only if the
student is intoxicated, then frater
nities need to reassess their role
at Stanford.
In addition, dry Rush parties
eliminate the legal liabilities fra
ternities face by serving alcohol to
minors. Because high school stu
dents and other outsiders will not
be attracted to the open houses,
parties will not get out of control
and create volatile situations.
Alcohol is, unfortunately, an in
tegral part of fraternity life, and
eliminating it from the Rush proc
ess altogether would be hypocriti
cal. If it has to be served, it should
be served only at closed, invitation
only parties, where people can
more closely monitor the actions
of one another.
Although the University places
a high priority on self-regulation,
the fraternal system has abused
the University's trust. The Uni
versity should impose a dry Rush
before another student is hurt —
or killed.
