## Commencement speaker unworthy for graduation 
### 
WHO THE HELL is Robert
Maynard? We are disappointed,
to say the least, with this
year's choice of commencement
speaker.
After witnessing the three previous
graduation speakers — Mario Cuomo,
Ted Koppel and Tip O'Neill — it
seems obvious that a university of
Stanford's caliber can easily obtain a
respected, distinguished, nationally
prominent figure.
Who the hell chose Robert Maynard?
It seems outrageous that in a com
mencement honoring graduating stu
dents, these very students had abso
lutely no serious input in the decision

process.
Had the seniors been given the
opportunity to vote or voice their
opinion, we doubt that Robert
Maynard would have even been consid
ered. Perhaps the issue of the decision
process should have been addressed
earlier, but who could have foreseen
such an unrepresentative, inappropriate
choice?
We do not feel that a candidate's
race, color, creed or gender should
have any impact on his probability of
being chosen. The speaker should serve
as a role model to all students, not
just a select minority. Whereas Cuomo,
Koppel, and O'Neill fulfilled this crite-

rion, Robert Maynard simply cannot.
Contrary to Biology Prof. Norman
Wessells' and the committee's findings,
the keynote speaker should be nation
ally renowned. Parents and family
from around the country will be flying
in to see the ceremony. They and we
deserve a speaker whose name we have
heard of.
While Robert Maynard may be a
"rising star" who is still "flourishing,"
we would prefer the wisdom and en
couragement of an already-established
personality. The list of names who
fulfill this requirement is virtually
endless: Mayor Tom Bradley, Sandra
Day O'Connor, William F. Buckley,

Senator Daniel Inouye, Secretary of
State George Schultz, Coretta Scott
King.
We cannot help but wonder who the
other five names on the list were that
compelled University President Donald
Kennedy to choose Robert Maynard.
While we congratulate him on
whatever his accomplishments may be,
we still ask you, President Kennedy,
who the hell is Robert Maynard?
