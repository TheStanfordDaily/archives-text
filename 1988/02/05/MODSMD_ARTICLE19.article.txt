# Non-Western area should be stronger

### 
WHY IS the Faculty Senate
disregarding the issue of the
non-Western Culture require
ment as they consider changing West
ern Culture?
People claim that improving the
requirement is not enough because this
implies that the one-quarter non-
Western Culture requirement deserves
only one-third of the attention that the
study of Western Culture deserves.
However, the present supporters of the
new program also claim that students
will continue to study such influential
works as the Bible and Plato.
At the Dec. 1 Western Culture
forum, advocates of the proposed
course Cultures, Ideas and Values
insisted that many of the subjects in
the present course would still be cov
ered. It appears that the proposed
changes would only be equal to five
units. Otherwise, how would there be
time for the fundamental Western
Culture concepts that allegedly are to

be included?
Of course, the proposal does not
answer this question because full
details of CIV are not provided within
it. The proposal's shunning of a core
list only increases its vagueness.
It would at least be helpful to have
a structure and a list of required
concepts, if not of books, for the
course. (Think about how little we
know about CIV: Is it to be taught
chronologically or thematically? Will it
be possible for a professor to ignore
Confucius, Baldwin or Marx?)
The real question is not of values
but of time. Due to the enormous
breadth of Western Culture itself, the
present course already demands a pace
that endangers the notion of thorough
comprehension. How will CIV educate
students about a number of societies in
the same amount of time?
There could be no value judgment in
the suggestion that a revised World,
Culture course last for four quarters.
It is no different to ask for a manda
tory, equally rigorous selection of
tracks to fulfill the non-Western Cul
ture requirement except that these
labels separate cultures which would

provide a more critical viewpoint if
taught together. I suggest scrapping
the non-Western Culture requirement
and replacing it with four units of
World Culture.
Any course following under such a
broad heading as "Civilization" should
have a regularly evaluated core list as
a core list prevents a professor from
neglecting all-important ideas.
The core list requires the professor
to approach these ideas in a variety of
ways as well. For example, even if a
particular history professor detests
20th century literature, he or she
cannot assign a book about the ideas
of the BloomsKiry group; in the pres
ent system we read Virginia Woolf
herself. We keep the attention of stu
dents whose interests lie in varied
disciplines by mandating the study of
both primary and secondary texts.
Finally, Columbia University has a
two-year (Western) Contemporary
Civilization and Humanities require
ment (as well as science, language and
writing requirements).
Stanford should not structure its
curriculum on an unrealistic schedule.
We should not pretend that Western

and non-Western values, with or with
out a core list, may receive anything
but a cursory, "MTV-style" treatment
if they are taught for only 15 units.
