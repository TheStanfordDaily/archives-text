# Area One debate is heating up
## 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
Stanford's "Great Debate" continued
quietly at yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting,
the second in three weeks with proposed
changes to the Area One requirement on the
agenda.
Both students and faculty debated two
proposals currently on the table: the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies' plan to
abolish the core list and create a broad new
"Cultures, Ideas and Values" track, and the
recent counterproposal, sponsored by English
Prof. William Chace, to retain the core list
but alter it to include more works by women
and minorities.

This week's meeting stood in sedate con
trast to the senate's last meeting in which
the Western Culture requirement was dis
cussed. At that meeting, held Jan. 21, more
than 100 students stood outside the meeting
to support the CUS proposal, and the Uni
versity provided an additional room for inter
ested students to listen to the proceedings.
The meeting also coincided with U.S. Sec
retary of Education William Bennett's com
ments today to the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities where
he referred to proposed changes of Stanford's
Western Culture track as "self-imposed cur
ricular debasement."
The Stanford meeting's most emotional mo
ment was Black Student Union Chair Bill

King's speech, in which he called for passage
of the CUS proposal. King said he spoke for
freshmen in the BSU, as well as women who
are insulted by a requirement that does not
recognize their contribution to Western cul
ture.
If the CUS plan is not implemented, King
said, "students will feel cheated, because they
will know that there is other research and
scholarship describing a broader West and a
broader world. But Stanford will not tell
them."
Further support of the CUS proposal came
from a prepared statement by Anthropology
Prof. Renato Rosaldo, which was read by Clas-
sics Prof. Gregson Davis. Rosaldo
said the proposal was important
in giving students the tools they
need to cope in an increasingly
"interdependant world."
But Chace argued for the pre
servation of the core list. That
list, according to Chace, does not
"exalt these works as right or
denigrate them as wrong; it says
simply that they have provided
some of the deep language ... on
which generations before us have
moved."
Additional support for Chace's
plan came from English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz, who called the
proposed legislation "deeply

flawed" and recommended its re
jection.
According to Rebholz, the core
list "has vital, pragmatic
functions." The list guarantees
that students in different tracks
study works prior to the Renais
sance while "creating the possi
bility of intellectual exchange
among students" from different
disciplines.
Philosophy Prof. Michael Brat
man, on the other hand, for
warded a compromise solution to
the problem "in the spirit of the
CUS." While arguing that the core
list is necessary, Bratman noted
that differences between the CUS
and Chace proposals do not run
deep.
In order to ensure that under
graduates develop a "common in
tellectual experience," Bratman
proposed that after implementing

changes recommended by the
CUS, the Area One Committee
report to the senate after three
years in order to ensure that stu
dents are developing a common
intellectual base.
Other professers offered differ
ent alternatives. English Prof.
George Dekker, a critic of the CUS
plan, said the most "fertile area
for development is in the ill
defined non-Western Culture Re
quirement."
History Prof. Carl Degler said
he is concerned that the core list
is "too narrow" since it concen
trates mainly on works by West
ern European white males. Degler
proposed a compromise between
the two proposals which has co
herence that derives "from the
historical development of Ameri
can culture out of Europe."
And in response to University

President Donald Kennedy's call
— at a previous meeting — for
faculty to see what is happening
"in the trenches," several
speakers offered their findings
from talking to freshmen about
their Western Culture experi
ences. All the findings did not
agree, however.
According to History Prof.
Judith Brown, student evalua
tions show that only 7 percent of
students polled discussed their
readings with people outside of
their track.
Junior Rudy Fuentes, a former
member of the Council of Presi
dents, explained that students
would not always be found en
gaged in intellectual conversation
about readings because they often
concerned themselves with press
ing matters of the day, such as
those in Latin America.
