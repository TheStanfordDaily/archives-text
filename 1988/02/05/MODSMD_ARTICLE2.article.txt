# Area One debate is heating up

Stanford's "Great Debate" continued
quietly at yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting,
the second in three weeks with proposed
changes to the Area One requirement on the
agenda.
Both students and faculty debated two
proposals currently on the table: the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies' plan to
abolish the core list and create a broad new
"Cultures, Ideas and Values" track, and the
recent counterproposal, sponsored by English
Prof. William Chace, to retain the core list
but alter it to include more works by women
and minorities.

This week's meeting stood in sedate con

the Western Culture requirement was dis
cussed. At that meeting, held Jan. 21, more
than 100 students stood outside the meeting
to support the CUS proposal, and the Uni
versity provided an additional room for inter

The meeting also coincided with U.S. Sec
retary of Education William Bennett's com

Independent Colleges and Universities where
he referred to proposed changes of Stanford's
Western Culture track as "self-imposed cur
ricular debasement."
The Stanford meeting's most emotional mo

King's speech, in which he called for passage
of the CUS proposal. King said he spoke for
freshmen in the BSU, as well as women who
are insulted by a requirement that does not
recognize their contribution to Western cul
ture.
If the CUS plan is not implemented, King
said, "students will feel cheated, because they
will know that there is other research and
scholarship describing a broader West and a
broader world. But Stanford will not tell
them."
Further support of the CUS proposal came
from a prepared statement by Anthropology
Prof. Renato Rosaldo, which was read by Clas-
