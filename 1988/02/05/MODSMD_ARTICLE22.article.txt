## And the winner is ...

BY NOW WE'VE HEARD plenty of
predictions about this November's
elections. You know: "Jackson's
unelectable." "Babbitt? Are you kidding?"
"Du Pont doesn't stand a chance." "A
Democrat win this Congressional district?
Maybe next decade."
A pattern has taken shape. Those po
litical pundits who have reputations to
protect will only hack away at those can
didates who seem safely out of conten
tion. Want to know why? Last summer
George Will bravely penned a Newsweek
column titled "President Nunn's Team."
Poor George. He even predicted that Sam
Nunn's first Supreme Court nominee
would be Joe Biden. No, George Will was
not joking.
Poor George.
No wonder his columnist colleagues
have hence decided to forgo such specific
political meteorology. But somebody has
to quench that read-Jeane-Dixon's-
E/igutrer-column-in-the-checkout-lane
thirst that dwells in us all, political
junkies in particular. Somebody has to
handicap the D.C. Derby, and not to tell
us who's going to lose, but to tell us
who's going to win.
What the hell.
The Democratic presidential ticket of
Michael Dukakis and AI Gore will squeak
past the GOP's George Bush and Jack
Kemp. Dukakis, that lifetime .270 hitter
of the Democrats, will finish second in
the Feb. 8 lowa caucuses and win the
Feb. 16 New Hampshire primary. Buoyed
by his behemoth organization and a flood
of contributions, Dukakis will split Dixie
with native son Al Gore.
Bruce Babbitt, the Jiminy Cricket con

science of the Democrats, will be chased
out after Super Tuesday, Mar. 8, and
Dick Gephardt will soon follow. Gary
Hart, Paul Simon, Gore, Jesse Jackson
and Dukakis will all remain for the Apr.
19 New York primary, which this time
around will prove decisive. Thanks to
Mario Cuomo's endorsement, Dukakis
will sweep New York and thereafter
cruise to the nomination.
You've heard talk of a possible deadlock
in Atlanta? A "brokered convention" with
Cuomo being selected as compromise can
didate? Baloney. Veterans of a three-year
campaign of debate after debate, glad
handing, fundraising and lost sleep won't
be willing to cheerily hand the nomina
tion over to anyone who hasn't paid his
dues.
Gore, at 39, won't want to leave his
Senate seat for VP but will do so none
theless out of fear that, without his
Southern vote-getting power on the
ticket, the Republicans will win the White
House. And he'll be right.
On the GOP side, Bush will ride out
the Iranamok affair and outpace Bob Dole
in nearly every primary after a Dole vic
tory in lowa. Bush has a clockwork cam
paign organization with probably more
money than it needs to win; Dole's cam
paign, on the other hand, is impoverished
by GOP standards and lies half paralyzed,
as US News puts it, due to having "a
lot of cooks but no busboys." Even if
Dole manages to jolt Bush by adding New
Hampshire to his lowa win, Bush's ma
chine and money will heal the Vice Pres
ident in time for Super Tuesday.
Rep. Jack Kemp will accept the VP
spot despite his distaste for the preppy

Bush. Lately Kemp has toned down his
attacks on the Vice President, preferring
instead to harrass Dole — perhaps an
ticipating Bush's eventual triumph.
Pete Du Pont and Alexander Haig?
Both will be gone after abysmal Super
Tuesday showings, if they even make it
that far.
The former Rev. Marion G. "Pat"
Robertson will be the joker in the GOP
deck. He has a well-financed and frighten
ingly loyal organization, and he should
place third consistently. But this will only
have the effect of fracturing party unity
and adding religious-smelling planks to
Bush's platform at the New Orleans con
vention — planks which will send inde
pendents nationwide into the Democratic
camp.
Hence Michael Dukakis.
Some parts of the outcome I like, some
I don't; some may be just dead wrong.
Right or wrong, though, I'll be tracking
the Washington races — including con
gressional contests — in each of the next
14 weeks, right up through the June 7
California primaries, all from a distinctly
campus viewpoint. Expect controversy,
centrism and cynicism.
Next week: Bruce Babbitt: All Truth,
No Beauty.

Some parts of the outcome I like, some
I don't; some may be just dead wrong.
Right or wrong, though, I'll be tracking
the Washington races — including con
gressional contests — in each of the next
14 weeks, right up through the June 7
California primaries, all from a distinctly
campus viewpoint. Expect controversy,
centrism and cynicism.

No Beauty.

BY NOW WE'VE HEARD plenty of
predictions about this November's
elections. You know: "Jackson's
unelectable." "Babbitt? Are you kidding?"
"Du Pont doesn't stand a chance." "A
Democrat win this Congressional district?
Maybe next decade."
A pattern has taken shape. Those po
litical pundits who have reputations to
protect will only hack away at those can
didates who seem safely out of conten
tion. Want to know why? Last summer
George Will bravely penned a Newsweek
column titled "President Nunn's Team."
Poor George. He even predicted that Sam
Nunn's first Supreme Court nominee
would be Joe Biden. No, George Will was
not joking.
Poor George.
No wonder his columnist colleagues
have hence decided to forgo such specific
political meteorology. But somebody has
to quench that read-Jeane-Dixon's-
E/igutrer-column-in-the-checkout-lane
thirst that dwells in us all, political
junkies in particular. Somebody has to
handicap the D.C. Derby, and not to tell
us who's going to lose, but to tell us
who's going to win.
What the hell.
The Democratic presidential ticket of
Michael Dukakis and AI Gore will squeak
past the GOP's George Bush and Jack
Kemp. Dukakis, that lifetime .270 hitter
of the Democrats, will finish second in
the Feb. 8 lowa caucuses and win the
Feb. 16 New Hampshire primary. Buoyed
by his behemoth organization and a flood
of contributions, Dukakis will split Dixie
with native son Al Gore.
Bruce Babbitt, the Jiminy Cricket con

science of the Democrats, will be chased
out after Super Tuesday, Mar. 8, and
Dick Gephardt will soon follow. Gary
Hart, Paul Simon, Gore, Jesse Jackson
and Dukakis will all remain for the Apr.
19 New York primary, which this time
around will prove decisive. Thanks to
Mario Cuomo's endorsement, Dukakis
will sweep New York and thereafter
cruise to the nomination.
You've heard talk of a possible deadlock
in Atlanta? A "brokered convention" with
Cuomo being selected as compromise can
didate? Baloney. Veterans of a three-year
campaign of debate after debate, glad
handing, fundraising and lost sleep won't
be willing to cheerily hand the nomina
tion over to anyone who hasn't paid his
dues.
Gore, at 39, won't want to leave his
Senate seat for VP but will do so none
theless out of fear that, without his
Southern vote-getting power on the
ticket, the Republicans will win the White
House. And he'll be right.
On the GOP side, Bush will ride out
the Iranamok affair and outpace Bob Dole
in nearly every primary after a Dole vic
tory in lowa. Bush has a clockwork cam
paign organization with probably more
money than it needs to win; Dole's cam
paign, on the other hand, is impoverished
by GOP standards and lies half paralyzed,
as US News puts it, due to having "a
lot of cooks but no busboys." Even if
Dole manages to jolt Bush by adding New
Hampshire to his lowa win, Bush's ma
chine and money will heal the Vice Pres
ident in time for Super Tuesday.
Rep. Jack Kemp will accept the VP
spot despite his distaste for the preppy

Bush. Lately Kemp has toned down his
attacks on the Vice President, preferring
instead to harrass Dole — perhaps an
ticipating Bush's eventual triumph.
Pete Du Pont and Alexander Haig?
Both will be gone after abysmal Super
Tuesday showings, if they even make it
that far.
The former Rev. Marion G. "Pat"
Robertson will be the joker in the GOP
deck. He has a well-financed and frighten
ingly loyal organization, and he should
place third consistently. But this will only
have the effect of fracturing party unity
and adding religious-smelling planks to
Bush's platform at the New Orleans con
vention — planks which will send inde
pendents nationwide into the Democratic
camp.
Hence Michael Dukakis.

I don't; some may be just dead wrong.

the Washington races — including con
