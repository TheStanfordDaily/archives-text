## Strength before peace 
### 
THE FEB. 2 VIEWPOINT by
Cathy Echols and Manuel Cis
neros is very one-sided in its
view of Central American peace.
By listening only to the Sandinistas'
arguments, its authors have managed
to reach conclusions which are inac
curate, culminating in the ultimate
conclusion that Contra aid must be
stopped.
The issue is not simply peace, but
peace with democracy.
I am in complete support of the
Esquipulas II accords and agree that
President Reagan's calloused attitude
toward the peace plan is unproductive
and that his talk of $270 million in
Contra aid was extremely untimely.
However, since the Sandinistas
continue to insist on maintaining their
private armed forces funded by $600
million worth of Soviet aid, and since
President Ortega continues to say that
no other party may share the power of
the government regardless of the
outcome of the next election, the
pressure of the civil war must not be
eliminated by the militant ruling party
if democracy is to have a chance.
The Sandinistas have had five
months to develop a plan for the
democratization of Nicaragua, but still
refuse, relying instead on the wishy
washiness of the American Congress to
end the regime's need for a Peace
Plan.
In her Jan. 13 report, "Evaluation of
the Central American Peace Plan,"
Susan Kaufman Purcell, director of the
Latin American Project of the Council
on Foreign Relations (which, I might
add, is considered to be a liberal think
tank), states, "Nicaragua is often given
a great deal of credit for making
changes that still fall far short of the
standards set by the accord," and,
"Nicaraguan compliance has been
measured against the agenda
Nicaragua has set for itself, not
against that established in the Central
American peace plan."
Purcell observes that though the
Sandinistas allowed one independent
radio station and one opposition news
paper to reopen early in the peace and
democratization process, this type of
press freedom does not compare with
the substantial freedom of the press
existing in the other Central American
states.
Likewise, while the democratic

countries released between zero and
450 prisoners covered by the amnesty
of the accords, Nicaragua released just
under 1,000 of its estimated 7,000 to
10,000 political prisoners.
Though no Central American
country can claim a perfect record
regarding the peace plan, a great deal
of progress has been made, and a
foundation for future progress has
been built.
Consequently, no Central American
president can afford to criticize the
Sandinista regime, unless he is willing
to carry the label of "spoiler."
It is no surprise that President Arias
asks the United States to end aid to
the Contras, since it is part of the
peace plan.
However, he has in the past stated
that the peace and democratization
plan must be implemented simultane
ously, and not, as the Sandinistas have
insisted, peace first, democracy later.
Without the Contras, the Sandinistas
would have no incentive to negotiate
with the civilian opposition; even the
Sandinistas admit that most of their
"democratization" has been aimed at
the coming vote in Congress.
Besides the political necessity of
supporting the Contras, there is also
considerable reason to believe that they
may represent as many Nicaraguans as
the Sandinistas do.
One must take into account the fact
that with at least 12,000 fighters, the
Contras are the largest guerilla move
ment in the history of modern Latin
America.
The claim made by Echols and
Cisneros that "the Contras have not
won the hearts and minds of the
Nicaraguan people," is apparently
inaccurate.
If Echols and Cisneros are referring
to the Sandinista conception of the
"people" as being those who are of the
"proletarian" mind-set, then they are
correct: Sandinista Party members do
not agree with the Contras.
However, the general populace is less
than supportive of the Sandinistas,
except when they are afraid that their
rations may be reduced by the Sandi
nista block coordinator or that their
children may be drafted by the Sandi
nista Party's armed forces (as has
happened to many who have spoken
out against the party.)
In fact, those who are in FDN terri-

Tory (the Contras do control some
territory, and half the country is con
tested) say the same things about the
Sandinistas that the Sandinistas say
about the Contras.
In other words, the vast mfyority of
Nicaraguans are "happy" with
whomever is in control of their part of
the country.
In all probability, they want to be
left alone by both sides, and would
gladly accept a democratic government
like the one envisioned in the
Esquipulas II accord.
Some of the actions of the United
States in Central America have not
served the interests of either Central
America or the United States: Echols
and Cisneros are right in condemning
the mining of Nicaraguan harbors.
However, the United States does
have a role to play, including both full
support of the peace plan and, for the
present, support of the revolutionary
forces fighting against the Sandinistas.
As Purcell reports, "Contrary to the
conventional wisdom, supporters of
peace with democracy in Central
America do not want the United States
to disengage from the region so that
Central America can solve its own
problem. Central Americans want to
set their own agenda and want the
United States to respect it."
In addition, "supporters of democ
racy in Central America much prefer a
larger U.S. role now, in support of a
peace plan that provides for increasing
democratization, to a large U.S. mili
tary role later, which they see as the
most probable alternative in the event
that the process fails."
