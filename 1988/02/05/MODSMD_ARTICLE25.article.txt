## PLO state isn't issue 
### 
TO ARGUE ABOUT the existence
of a Palestinian state is to
debate a non-issue. It is absurd
to place a terrorist organization on the
borders of Israel, adding yet another
enemy to her surroundings.
How can Israel be expected to accept
such a nation when none of the PLO's
many Arab brothers will support it? By
concerning ourselves with the es
tablishment of such a state, we are
avoiding the resolution of the true
conflict in the Middle East.
The real problem lies in the refusal
of the Palestinians and Arab nationals
to recognize the existence of Israel as
a state.
The surrounding Arab nations and
PLO guerrilla groups have plagued the

Israelis with persistent attacks since
the beginning of her statehood and
have forced her to relinquish land
which is rightfully her own. Israel has
been reduced to a ridiculous size in
relation to her neighboring enemies.
We fear that in dealing with the
Middle East crisis, the question of
Israel's survival has been neglected.
We hope in the future both that
Israel's importance as an ally and
democratic nation will be remembered
and that useless discussion about a
PLO state will not cloud the real
issues of this controversy.
