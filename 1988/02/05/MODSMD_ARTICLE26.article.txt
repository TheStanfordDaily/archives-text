# Iowans aren't bad

### 
Let's get one thing straight right
away. I really don't have time to
respond to Keith Nashawaty's almost
reasonable Feb. 3 column. Unfortu
nately, for the sake of all Stanford
lowans such as myself, I feel morally
inclined to take the time to retort
certain statements made by "Nash
awaty the Ignorant and Exceedingly
Annoying."
Nashawaty claims that lowa is a "a
very self-important state where
everyone's got a big mouth, a big gripe
and an even bigger John Deere trac
tor."
It is relatively common knowledge
that lowa, in keeping with every other
Midwestern state, is filled with some of
the most down-to-earth, modest and
honest people you'll find in the
country. Big mouths we are not.
Nashawaty's ignorant generalizations
do a discredit to all non-lowans, jour
nalists, political science majors, Bran
ner residents, Massachusetts residents,
seniors, people with dark hair and
even Republicans!
lowa may not come to a consensus
Monday night on who to put into the
White House, but I'm sure every
lowan could come to an agreement on
where Nashawaty can put his "even
bigger John Deere tractor."
