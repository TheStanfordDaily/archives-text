# Ujamaa standards put under scrutiny
## 
### 
I am writing because I am disturbed
at the attitudes and values that Club
Ujamaa, the annual party at Ujamaa
House, seems to represent. Several of
my friends and I went to the party in
semi-formal dress. One of my friends
dressed in a sport coat, dress shirt, tie,
penny loafers and jeans. Although he
had obviously gone to the trouble of
dressing nicely, in what he considered
"semi-formal" fashion, he was told to
leave by two different radio-headsetted
bouncers because he was wearing blue
jeans.
Stanford is a very egalitarian society,
certainly much more so than "the real
world," yet one of the worst examples
of elitism and discrimination, the
exclusive private club, is imitated and
idealized by the biggest party of the
year.
This is ironic, but it is made far
more so by the fact that Ujamaa spon
sors the party. It seems blind to the
principles involved that the theme
house for black people, the very people
who are most often discriminated
against by exclusive clubs, should
underwrite such an event.
