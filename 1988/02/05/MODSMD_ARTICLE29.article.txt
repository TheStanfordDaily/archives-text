## Locals greet foreign students 
### Marthe Lemut 
From basting birds to tutoring English,
members of the Community Committee for
International Students introduce Stanford's
foreign community to American culture.
"The very first thing I did in America was
stuff a turkey," boasted Dorothee Koch, a
graduate student from West Germany who
participated in a CCIS program for hosting
Stanford's foreigners.
Koch, along with 78 other foreign students
attending Stanford this year, spent her first
week in the United States living with an
American family that helped her adjust to
cultural differences.
"They made it so easy for me," she said.
"I was like their daughter."
With 400 volunteers from Palo Alto, Menlo
Park and Los Altos, CCIS works closely with
the Bechtel International Center, helping the
University's foreign students experience
American culture beyond the bounds of Stan
ford.
According to CCIS Business Affairs
Manager Alison Wells, the cooperation be
tween the I-Center and CCIS is unique —
few universities besides Stanford work with
volunteer community groups to accomodate
their international students.

"We work closely with the staff at the I-
Center, which makes us unique in the United
States," Wells said.
Since 1954, CCIS has invited the Univer
sity's foreign students to spend a week with
American families before they register for
classes.
The CCIS program helps students "bridge
the gap between jet lag and the adjustment
to the new community," according to Ann
Whitcomb, a CCIS officer.
The cultural exchange is "a two-way-street"
where both students and members of the com
muntiy benefit, Whitcomb said.
Over the last 16 years, Norah Bretall, one
CCIS volunteer, has hosted foreign students
from 28 different countries.
Bretall said that hosting such a wide variety
of foreign students has made her children
more internationally aware. Two of Bretall's
children are now traveling abroad.
Besides welcoming students into their
homes, CCIS volunteers also tutor students
and their spouses in English and help them
find permanent, off-campus housing as well.
A "hospitality network," recently estab
lished by CCIS, enables volunteers to "adopt"
foreign students for a year — giving the stu

dents a chance to enjoy picnics, ball games
and other American traditions.
Although an increasing number of foreign
students want to participate in the program,
CCIS officer Judi Keyani said there has been
a drop in the number of new volunteers that
worries her.
The CISS is working on recruitment and
publicity. We need "to have fresh blood,"
Keyani said.
The I-Center has its own network of vol
unteers who also help foreigners adjust to
Stanford — several I-Center workers work on
CISS programs.
Last quarter, volunteers from both groups
worked together organizing "Mornings
Around Town," a series of tours where local
residents acquaint foreign students and their
spouses with community resources.
One tour went to Foothill College so that
spouses of foreign students could learn about
academic resources in the area and how
California's education system works, accord
ing to Gwyn Dukes, a program coordinator.
Marie Bunn, an assistant director at the
I-Center, said she is impressed by the talent
and energy of all the volunteers.
" They show a great interest in improving
international relations," Bunn said. "We call
them citizen diplomats."
