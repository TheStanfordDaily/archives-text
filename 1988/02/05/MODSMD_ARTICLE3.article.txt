# Graduation speaker chosen for his many achievements
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Staff writer 
The selection of newspaper
editor Robert Maynard as this
year's featured Commencement
speaker is "a very progressive
move for Stanford," because the
choice was made more for
Maynard's personal and profes
sional achievements than for his
notoriety, according to Senior
Class President Liz Marks.
His selection also reflects a
growing concern among Stanford
students about the problems of
minority underrepresentation,
added Stacey Estrella, also a
senior class president.
Estrella said that more than 20
percent of the senior class ex
pressed a desire to have a female
or racial minority speaker for
Commencement in a poll taken
last October. About 500 seniors
participated in the survey.
Although several students
listed specific minority people,
most simply indicated their desire
to have a woman or racial
minority as speaker.
However, Marks added that
several students have expressed
disappointment because they
were hoping a better-known

speaker would be chosen.
Estrella, too, said some seniors
have voiced their disappointment
to her about Maynard's selection.
"After the article announcing
Maynard's selection came out,
people came up to me and told
me that they were upset because
they wanted a 'big-name*
speaker," Estrella said.
She noted, however, that once
students learned more about
Maynard, they were less mys
tified. "After they read the (Daily)
article, they gained respect for
Maynard, but they were still
curious about why he had been
selected."
Estrella cited Maynard's
credentials and his ability to speak
as major reasons for his selection.
She added that he represents the
kind of "ambition, will, integrity
and determination that will in
spire graduating students" at
Commencement.
"You cannot equate the speak
ing credibility of a person with
their notoriety," Estrella said.
But Estrella agreed the decision
breaks a tradition of having na
tionally renowned figures speak
In the past three years, the
Stanford Commencement has fea
tured such notables as retired

U.S. House Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill (1987), ABC-TV
"Nightline" host Ted Koppel
(1986) and New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo (1985).
Additionally, some may see
Maynard's selection as a
"surprise" because the selection
panel made a concerted effort to
keep its list of prospective
speakers secret.
"The members of the selection
panel made a conscious decision
not to release the names of the
people who were being con
sidered," said Special Assistant to
the President Marlene Wine, co
chair of the selection panel.
The roots of this decision can
be traced back to problems that
arose in 1986, when word that
comedian Bill Cosby was being
considered as a speaker leaked out
prematurely. A tenuous invitation
to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev was also extended that year.
When Ted Koppel, the selection
committee's second or third
choice, finally spoke at Com
mencement, he quipped "Presi
dent Kennedy, we could wait an
other five minutes or so; but per
sonally I don't think either Gor
bachev or Cosby is going to show
up."
