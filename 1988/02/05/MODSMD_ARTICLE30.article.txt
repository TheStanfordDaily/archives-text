# Mobius amazes with a twist
## 
### Paul Defigueiredo 
The Mobius band is not a
New Age rock group. It is not
New Age sushi either.
The Mobius band, first de
scribed by the German math
ematician and astronomer Au
gust Mobius in 1848, is a one
sided surface that is con
structed by taking a piece of
paper, giving it a half twist,
and pasting together the
twisted edges to form a circular
band.
You can construct a Mobius
band yourself out of this
column or out of your
Chemistry 172 notes.
Modern conveyor belts, for
example, use Mobius bands so
that one side of the belts will
not wear down faster than the
other side.
Photographic film and cas
sette tapes are also designed
with the Mobius band's inter
twining characteristics in
mind.
My roommate, who is a grad
uate student in chemistry, ex
plained to me that the Mobius
band plays an important part
in synthesizing various chemi
cal compounds.
He also tried to explain that
I am nothing but one big
chemical compound, and that
ultimately I can be reduced to
a series of Mobius bands. But
I did not buy that part of his
explanation.
Magicians also take advan
tage of the Mobius band's
amazing properties.
When they perform famous
tricks like separating big gold
loops that appear interlinked,
it seems magical.
But, in reality, the magicians
are using the Mobius band to
create the illusion.
Besides its practical and
magical characteristics, the
Mobius band has mathematical
properties:
Assume that two intelligent
two-dimensional bugs are
placed on a point in the
Euclidean plane — together

they designate a system of ori
entation. Then assume that
when the bugs turn right they
call the turn positive and nega
tive when they turn left.
If one of these bugs goes for
a long walk, regardless of the
path he takes, when he returns
to his point of departure, he
can confirm with the bug who
stays behind that his orienta
tion remains the same.
Mathematicians call surfaces
that have this property, like
the Euclidean plane, orient
able.
However, if the same bug
takes a long walk in the Mobius
band, the bug might take a
path that returns him to his
original point of departure —
but his orientation might not
agree with the bug's who
stayed behind. For this reason,
mathematicians call the
Mobius band "non-orientable."
The non-orientability of the
Mobius band is an important
property — topologists have
discovered that they can always
cut a Mobius band from any
non-orientable surface.
If you, my clever reader, can
think up a teaser that will fas
cinate me like the Mobius band
has, then send it to Brain
Teaser, Stanford Daily, Storke
Building, Stanford, CA. 94305.
The best brain teaser will
