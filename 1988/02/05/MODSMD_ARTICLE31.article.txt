# Stanford doctor helps musicians fight stage fright

Although most people associate
stage fright with actors, Stanford
Psychiatrist Duncan Clark is re
ceiving national attention for his
study on musicians plagued with
performance anxiety.
Although over 300 Bay Area
musicians have volunteered for
one of the 60 spots in Clark's
unusual study and CBS plans to
cover his research during a na
tional news broadcast, here at
Stanford few students have volun
teered for Duncan's study.
"I had originally intended to
start the program by seeing Stan
ford students and then going from
there . . . but I got so little

response [from them]," Clark
said.
Despite the lack of student par
ticipation, junior Chuck Seiber, a
violinist with the Stanford Sym
phony Orchestra, said he knows
that stage fright plagues many
Stanford musicians.
"Everybody feels nervous to a
certain extent," Seiber said.
"You feel jumpy and kind of
tense. It is just a question of who
can deal with it."
Clark, a drum player, became
interested in stage fright because
of personal problems with the ail
ment. Clark said the anxiety
musicians like himself experience
is no different from what actors
and public speakers undergo.

Anxiety before performing is
perfectly natural and even neces
sary. "Pre-show jitters" actually
fuel more energized perfor
mances, Clark said.
He explained that some of his
earlier research on stage fright
revealed that when heart rates
increased and musicians showed
other signs of anxiety they per
formed better than relaxed
musicians did.
Clark's present research
centers on musicians with stage
fright that far exceeds the normal,
necessary jitters.
He will study musicians who
are performing far below their po
tential and those who avoid per
formance situations all together

because of stage fright.
According to Clark, extreme
cases of stage fright are a type of
"cognitive disorder" that occurs
when performers irrationally be
lieve their skills are inadequate.
Musicians with extreme stage
fright are certain they will make
serious mistakes in performance
— even though they perform per
fectly well during rehearsal, Clark
explained.
Some of Clark's plans for treat
ing stage fright include group
counseling sessions for helping
uptight musicians recognize their
skills.
During the counseling sessions,
Clark will ask group participants
to perform in front of each other
in hopes that the musicians will
eventually become more comfort
able before "real" audiences.
Besides group counseling, Clark
said he plans to treat the members
of the study with Buspar, an anti
anxiety medication that has been
on the market since last year.
Before Buspar became avail
able, musicians calmed their pre
show fears with several other
medications, according to Clark.
These medications, including
sedatives like Valium, proved
problematic because they often
impaired coordination and be
came addictive.
Clark said he hopes that Buspar
will be more effective than the
other drugs because it does not
seem to cause unfavorable side
effects.
In the past, Bay Area musicians
plagued with stage fright found
counseling and support at semi
nars called "Performance Con
fidence."
Seminar organizer Mary
Dunkel, a Los Altos pianist, said
she developed the seminar after
several harrowing personal expe
riences with stage fright.
Dunkel, who works with
musicians, actors and corporate
executives, said she teaches them
to "greet anxiety with realism and
greet excitement with optimism."
According to Clark, seminars

like Dunkcl's are rare, and those
that do exist usually do not treat
musicians because the public does
not consider their careers
glamorous.
Most people believe that Joe
Montana's performance warrants
research because football stars are
important to them — but
musicians do not receive the same
attention, he said.
Clark said he hopes that his
research will remedy the im
balance and that musicians

plagued with nervous anxiety will
finally receive the attention t/hey
need.
Although few Stanford student
musicians have volunteered for
his study, Clark said he is amazed
by how much local and national
attention he has received.
Clark said he hoped that stu
dents here would still consider ap
plying for the study. He urges any
student musician interested to
call him at the Stanford Medical
Center.
