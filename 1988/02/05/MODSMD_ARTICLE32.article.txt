## Profane 'Patti' fails to rock 
### Reviewed by Jennifer Reese 
Billy and Eddy are blue collar
workers you don't want to know.
They act crude, they talk crude.
To them, women are nothing but
"chops" or "beef."
Billy has been cheating on his
wife and now his girlfriend is
pregnant. He and Eddy go to per
suade her to have an abortion;
this unsuccessful expedition is the
centerpiece of the odd and awful
movie "Patti Rocks."
The film can be split into two
segments: The first half of the
movie is dominated by Billy's
relentless, misogynous rap about
women. It's a long, brutal
monologue, like a jackhammer,
that exposes Billy's repulsive and
sexist views.
He's clearly meant to be a mon
ster, a gross exaggeration of the
archetypal male chauvinist. His
rap is so grotesque it's funny, but
it goes on for too long and be
comes tedious.

The second half of the movie
is about what happens when they
arrive at the apartment of Billy's
girlfriend Patti. She's a sensible,
sexy woman who presumably
knows what she wants, and what
she wants now is Billy's child.
When Billy fails to persuade her
to abort, he sends Eddy into her
bedroom to convince her. Eddy is
a quiet little man, and he hovers
at Patti's bedside, hesitantly
trying to converse with her.
She is touched by his sensitivity
and he is touched by her inde
pendence and dignity. They talk
for 10 minutes, grow "close" and
make love. This is an encounter
the movie suggests to be "special."
There's interesting material
here for a movie, but "Patti
Rocks" isn't that movie. This is
a dangerously simple-minded
treatment of the relations be
tween men and women. It has
nothing fresh to offer us.
To begin with, it is laughably
behind the times. It sets out to

explode the sexual double stan
dard: Patti gives a short speech
about her rights to sleep with
whomever she chooses without
being stigmatized. Patti is set up
as an independent heroine, a
woman who comes and goes as
she pleases.
Billy's sexism is shown to be
stupid machismo. None of this is
revolutionary anymore, it's old
hat. Women indeed feel free to be
as promiscuous as men; there's a
Patti Rocks in every apartment
building in America. What now?
Where do we go from here?
The film's vision is narrow and
impoverished. It's portrayal of an
"intimate" connection between a
man and a woman is woefully
skewed. Patti and Eddy have sex
after knowing each other for 10
minutes, and they are supposed
to have some bond after those 10
minutes. This imitation intimacy
mocks true intimacy and exposes
