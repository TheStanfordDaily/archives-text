# 'Sammy and Rosie' finds fun in chaos
## 
### Reviewed by Erik Hagestad 
It's true that you can't judge a
book by its cover, and no, "Sammy
and Rosie Get Laid" is not just
another juvenile sex-comedy. This
new film from director Stephen
Frears is instead a complex ex
amination of social decay and, on
a grander scale, a comment on
the subjectivity of truth.
"Sammy and Rosie" marks the
first reunion of Frears with
screenwriter Hanif Kureishi since
their success with "My Beautiful
Laundrette" in 1985. Like
"Laundrette," this film explores
with ample humor the complexity
of personal relations set against
the backdrop of riot-strewn Lon

Frears and Kureishi have
managed to package these dis

out of place.

of "Sammy and Rosie."
Such discrepencies, though, do
not detract strongly from the

managed to mix strong and dis

"Sammy and Rosie" marks the
first reunion of Frears with
screenwriter Hanif Kureishi since
their success with "My Beautiful
Laundrette" in 1985. Like
"Laundrette," this film explores
with ample humor the complexity
of personal relations set against
the backdrop of riot-strewn Lon

Finally, their indifference to the

Even the rioting itself, which
sets the mood for the film, is
shown to be both brutally tragic
and surrealistically comic. Rioters
are seen posing for photographers
as the dead are pulled off the
streets. This dark humor is typical
of the entire film, which con

omnipresent voyeur, witnessing
the chaos and yet passing no
judgement, taking no sides.
Victoria cannot be seen as the
film's hero, however, unless
Frears wishes to advocate aimless
retreat as a solution for the com
plexities of life. Instead, the char
acter seems to be a tool for
amplifying the contrasts that exist
throughout the film. It is this
duality that seems to be the mes
sage, the fact that everyone in
terprets the world in their own
manner, making objective truth
an impossibility.
Frears and Kureishi have
managed to package these dis

turbing topics in a film that is
wholly endearing. "Sammy and
Rosie" is far from a perfect film,
however. Its style is confused be
tween realism and a surreal sat
ire, resulting in some overly sym
bolic scenes which feel strangely
out of place.
A disfigured peasant who fades
magically in and out of scenes is
used to represent Rafi's unrellent
ing guilt. Such unreal images
might have functioned well in a
more expressionistic film, but is
simply blatant and alienating in
the more conventional framework
of "Sammy and Rosie."
Such discrepencies, though, do
not detract strongly from the
humor or emotional impact of the
film. Frears and Kureishi have
managed to mix strong and dis
turbing messages with a light
hearted good nature which to
gether make the film a highly
emotional pleasure.
