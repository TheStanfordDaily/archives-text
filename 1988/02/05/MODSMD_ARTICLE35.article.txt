# Poor acting drowns out 'Statements'

"Statements After An Arrest
Under the Immorality Act" is
written by South African
playwright Athol Fugard (best
known for "Master Harold .. . and
the Boys"). It's based on the true
story of the 1966 arrest of two
adulterous lovers, a white librar
ian (Gina Schmeling) and a
"colored" school principal (James
Gunn), for violation of South
Africa's Immorality Act, which
forbade sexual relations between
Afrikaaners and members of other
races.
The play begins with the two
lovers secretly meeting in the back
room of a community library in
rural South Africa. The play then
moves to their arrest and the in
troduction of a new character, a
South African police officer
(Thomas Knight Clyde).
It finally wraps up with a series
of "confessions" by each lover
during interrogation. The entire
play is set in the library.
Although "Statements" is
highly political, it is not pedantic.
Fugard has created characters,
not merely types or metaphors.
These are people who are more
concerned about their personal
lives than political agendas.
The school principal worries
more about his adultery and the
neglect of his work and family
than he does about breaking any
South African law. Fugard shows
that although the law equates
"immorality" with adultery, the
South African government sees it
as the mixing of races.
While listening to the dialogue,
you get the feeling that Fugard
is trying to reveal something
really deep (especially through the
expressionistic confessions), but
listening to Gina Schmeling and

James Gunn trying to deliver the
dialogue doesn't reveal very
much. Also, trying to follow the
direction of second-year doctoral
student Rob Baker reveals even
less.
Schmeling and Gunn have
about as much chemistry together
as Jimmy "The Greek"' Snyder
and Jesse Jackson. Before their
arrest, when they are alone, they
seem to be talking more at each
other than to each other.
Also, even though they are
alone and it's one of the few pre
cious moments they have to
gether, Baker has them
everywhere but in each other's
arms. There is no sense of pas
sion, or even love, between these
two characters. It leaves you won
dering why they're risking so
much for each other.
The production does pick up
after their arrest for two good
reasons. First, the South African
police officer tells us what's going
on (basically, how the lovers got
caught); and, second, Schmeling
and Gunn no longer have to ex
change dialogue.
Although the two lead actors
seem more comfortable apart,
they still have problems, particu
larly Schmeling. At one point, she
must play both the librarian and
her interrogator, and the distinc
tion becomes hazy.
Fortunately, Gunn doesn't have
to perform such a rigorous feat,
which is just as well since it prob
ably took a lot out of him to walk
across the stage naked at the be
ginning. (Don't expect anything
shocking, though. The lights are
very dim.)
Technically, the play does work.
Baker can thank production
manager Michael Ramsaur, tech
nical director Alexander Stewart,
scenic technicians Paul Mur

gatroyd and Paul Strayer, and
lighting man Allen J. Blue.
The single, sparsely decorated
set helps to focus the audience's
attention on what is being said.
The lighting is crucial for estab
lishing both mood and place.
Yet, no matter how good the
words or ideas of the playwright
are, or how good the stage looks,
or how nice the lights are, they
cannot bring this production to
life. Only the actors can do that.

Unfortunately, too much oi

der the Immorality Act" is left
unintelligible by poor perfor
mances. This is a shame consid
ering the importance of Athol
Fugard's insights into human re

sion, or even love, between these
two characters. It leaves you won
dering why they're risking so
much for each other.
The production does pick up
after their arrest for two good
reasons. First, the South African
police officer tells us what's going
on (basically, how the lovers got
caught); and, second, Schmeling
and Gunn no longer have to ex
change dialogue.
Although the two lead actors
seem more comfortable apart,
they still have problems, particu
larly Schmeling. At one point, she
must play both the librarian and
her interrogator, and the distinc
tion becomes hazy.
Fortunately, Gunn doesn't have
to perform such a rigorous feat,
which is just as well since it prob
ably took a lot out of him to walk
across the stage naked at the be
ginning. (Don't expect anything
shocking, though. The lights are
very dim.)
Technically, the play does work.
Baker can thank production
manager Michael Ramsaur, tech
nical director Alexander Stewart,
scenic technicians Paul Mur

gatroyd and Paul Strayer, and
lighting man Allen J. Blue.
The single, sparsely decorated
set helps to focus the audience's
attention on what is being said.
The lighting is crucial for estab
lishing both mood and place.
Yet, no matter how good the
words or ideas of the playwright
are, or how good the stage looks,
or how nice the lights are, they
cannot bring this production to
life. Only the actors can do that.

Unfortunately, too much oi
"Statements After An Arrest Un
der the Immorality Act" is left
unintelligible by poor perfor
mances. This is a shame consid
ering the importance of Athol
Fugard's insights into human re
lationships and emotions within
the horrifying, and perhaps not
so unique, system of apartheid.
The performances are at the
Nitery tonight and Saturday at 8
p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.
