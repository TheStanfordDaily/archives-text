## Maples rocks: Card No. 1 for a day Wildcats bitter over refs' calls 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
If you're the No. 1 ranked team in the country,
there are a lot of ways you could react to being
beaten by Stanford.
You couldn't, however, say that your team didn't
want last night's game. Early this week the Arizona
press reported that Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery had said that he didn't think the Wildcats
had improved since the two teams' last meeting on
Jan. 9.
Montgomery's remark made it a matter of pride.
"We really didn't want to lose this game," Arizona
forward Sean Elliott said. "We'd heard what their
coach had said."
But the Wildcats did lose, and with a flock of
hungry reporters circling the locker room, they had
to answer the inevitable "why."
For his part, Steve Kerr, the ice-veined Arizona
point guard, was a good sport. The senior team
leader opted for the honorable approach — he gave
the Cardinal credit. Kerr had a few gripes about
the game, but, he said, "They outplayed us — that's
the bottom line."
But Kerr's attitude was the exception and not
the rule. All told, the Wildcats were decidedly bitter
losers. Said Arizona center Tom Tolbert, "Stanford
can say it's great to beat the No. 1 team and all,
but as far as I'm concerned they're 6-4 and we're
9-1."
"Sure, we were planning on trying to go unde
feated in the Pac-10," forward Anthony Cook said.
Bitter is expected; no one, least of all the country's
No. 1 team, likes to lose. But after last night's
game, the Arizona players also couldn't stop crying
about the calls. To hear some of the Wildcats tell
it, you would think Arizona lost to Booker Turner,
Jerry White and Terry Christman, the trio that
refereed last night's game.
"The reason they beat us is they (the refs) didn't
really let us play our game," Arizona forward Joe
Turner said. "You just touched a guy and there
was a foul."

According to starting forward Anthony Cook, the
game didn't come "down to the last five minutes,
it was the first two," he said.
But a look at the statistics sheet shows that in
the first two minutes of the contest, Arizona was
whistled for a total of two fouls, both on strong
moves by Cardinal forward Howard Wright. In the
last 5:36, after being up 74-72, the Wildcats didn't
score a single point. Which stretch had more of an
impact you'll have to judge for yourself.
"I can understand to some extent that because
you're on the road you're not going to get the calls,"
Cook continued, "but there has to be a limit."
"I knew they were going to call a lot of fouls,"
Joe Turner said. "But tonight we couldn't get away
with anything. On the other end, on a lot of shots,
the guy was hanging on Tolbert's arm, and nothing
was called."
Well, let's be fair and take another look. Say
Cook and company are referring to the first eight
minutes of the game in which Arizona was called
for seven fouls and Stanford only two. At that point,
the Wildcats were up by five, 20-15. a margin they
would more or less keep until halftime.
When the first half buzzer sounded Arizona was
up by three; the Wildcats had been called for 13
fouls, the Cardinal 10. The final foul tally was
Stanford 18, Arizona 22.
The Cardinal did, however, score 22 from the
line, compared to only 11 for the Wildcats. But if
you take away the six Stanford got at the end when
Arizona was intentionally fouling, the margin isn't
so much. Looking at those figures, it's pretty hard
to believe the Wildcats' assertion that the referees
cost them the game. It sounds more like sour grapes.
The real story, as Eliott grudgingly admitted, was
that Wright and Greg Butler beat the Wildcats
inside. You can't attribute 22 points and 9 rebounds
by Wright and 14 and 10 by Butler simply to the
referees favoring the home team.
"The big men were taking it to us," Eliott said.
Tolbert added, "The big guys ate us up — there's
no excuse for that."
Hmmm, no excuses, you say.

Montgomery's remark made it a matter of pride.
"We really didn't want to lose this game," Arizona
forward Sean Elliott said. "We'd heard what their
coach had said."
But the Wildcats did lose, and with a flock of
hungry reporters circling the locker room, they had
to answer the inevitable "why."
For his part, Steve Kerr, the ice-veined Arizona
point guard, was a good sport. The senior team
leader opted for the honorable approach — he gave
the Cardinal credit. Kerr had a few gripes about
the game, but, he said, "They outplayed us — that's
the bottom line."
But Kerr's attitude was the exception and not
the rule. All told, the Wildcats were decidedly bitter
losers. Said Arizona center Tom Tolbert, "Stanford
can say it's great to beat the No. 1 team and all,
but as far as I'm concerned they're 6-4 and we're
9-1."
"Sure, we were planning on trying to go unde
feated in the Pac-10," forward Anthony Cook said.
Bitter is expected; no one, least of all the country's
No. 1 team, likes to lose. But after last night's
game, the Arizona players also couldn't stop crying
about the calls. To hear some of the Wildcats tell
it, you would think Arizona lost to Booker Turner,
Jerry White and Terry Christman, the trio that
refereed last night's game.
"The reason they beat us is they (the refs) didn't
really let us play our game," Arizona forward Joe
Turner said. "You just touched a guy and there
was a foul."

According to starting forward Anthony Cook, the
game didn't come "down to the last five minutes,
it was the first two," he said.
But a look at the statistics sheet shows that in
the first two minutes of the contest, Arizona was
whistled for a total of two fouls, both on strong
moves by Cardinal forward Howard Wright. In the
last 5:36, after being up 74-72, the Wildcats didn't
score a single point. Which stretch had more of an
impact you'll have to judge for yourself.
"I can understand to some extent that because
you're on the road you're not going to get the calls,"
Cook continued, "but there has to be a limit."
"I knew they were going to call a lot of fouls,"
Joe Turner said. "But tonight we couldn't get away
with anything. On the other end, on a lot of shots,
the guy was hanging on Tolbert's arm, and nothing
was called."
Well, let's be fair and take another look. Say
Cook and company are referring to the first eight
minutes of the game in which Arizona was called
for seven fouls and Stanford only two. At that point,
the Wildcats were up by five, 20-15. a margin they
would more or less keep until halftime.
When the first half buzzer sounded Arizona was
up by three; the Wildcats had been called for 13
fouls, the Cardinal 10. The final foul tally was
Stanford 18, Arizona 22.
The Cardinal did, however, score 22 from the
line, compared to only 11 for the Wildcats. But if
you take away the six Stanford got at the end when
Arizona was intentionally fouling, the margin isn't
so much. Looking at those figures, it's pretty hard
to believe the Wildcats' assertion that the referees
cost them the game. It sounds more like sour grapes.
The real story, as Eliott grudgingly admitted, was
that Wright and Greg Butler beat the Wildcats
inside. You can't attribute 22 points and 9 rebounds
by Wright and 14 and 10 by Butler simply to the
referees favoring the home team.
"The big men were taking it to us," Eliott said.
Tolbert added, "The big guys ate us up — there's
no excuse for that."
Hmmm, no excuses, you say.
