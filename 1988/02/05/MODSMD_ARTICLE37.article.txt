# High noon swimdown at deGuerre
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It is said that a collegiate
swimming team's dual meet
season means almost nothing
because the team spends its
whole season preparing only
for the NCAA champion
ships. Of course, the people

who say that haven't experienced a
Stanford-Texas dual meet.
The Cardinal women put their 6-0 record
on the line tomorrow when the four-time
defending national champion Longhorns,
also 6-0, come to deGuerre Pool for a show
down at high noon.
"It should probably be a pretty good
meet," according to Texas sophomore
Andrea Hayes, apparently one for under
statements. Texas and Stanford have been
ranked one and two all season long, and
after the Longhorns' 75-29 blowout of No.
3 Florida last week (only the sixth dual
meet loss in Gator history), it looks like a
two-team race for the national title.
The Cardinal comes in this year with per
haps its best team ever, and has the home
pool advantage to boot. The home squad
has won in the last five Stanford-Texas

meets, with Texas winning 92-46 in Austin
last year and the Cardinal triumphing 82-58
two years ago.
In a season that has seen Stanford already
destroy three top-10 teams (Arizona State,
USC and UCLA), no single swimmer has
emerged as a sole leader. Despite a relentless
training schedule that usually would cause
slower times, eight swimmers have already
posted NCAA-qualifying times.
On the other side of the pool, not to be
outdone, Texas has qualified 11 swimmers
for the NCAA meet. They are led by Hayes,
who has bested qualifying standards in five
events already this year.
Texas also has senior Betsy Mitchell, who
won three NCAA titles last season, two of
them in American record time. The Long
horns boast sophomore Carrie Steinseifer,
the gold-medalist in the 100 freestyle at
1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, and senior
Tracey McFarlane, who edged Rapp to win
the 100 breast stroke at NCAA last year.
"I think we have a great chance of beating
Texas, and Texas has a great chance of
beating us," Rapp said.
The meet could actually end up a blow-out
in either direction as each team has three
or more top swimmers in almost every event.

What that moans is that each event could
easily end in a Stanford sweep. Or a Texas
sweep.
The breast stroke will likely provide the
closest competition. Stanford has three-time
NCAA champion Susan Rapp, Susan Lenth,
Jill Johnson and Bethanne Lambert. Texas
will counter with McFarlane and freshman
Susan Johnson, the only person to beat
McFarlane in the breast stroke this year.
The sprint freestyle races will be similarly
competitive. The Cardinal is led by five-time
national titlist Jenna Johnson and junior
Aimee Berzins — who finished one-two in
the 100 at NCAAs — while Texas has three
Ail-Americans: Steinseifer, Jeanne Doolan,
Ann Drolsom and Courtney Madsen.
Steinseifer, from nearby Saratoga, is ex
cited about the challenge. "Swimming at
Stanford is a hype for both teams," she
said. "I'm excited to race those girls. I'm
excited about the competition."
Michelle Donahue leads five Stanford AII-
Americans in the backstroke, but again the
Longhorns are loaded too. In fact, the top
six finshers in the 200 backstroke at the
NCAA meet last year will be swimming here
tomorrow, including winner Mitchell and
runner-up Hayes.
