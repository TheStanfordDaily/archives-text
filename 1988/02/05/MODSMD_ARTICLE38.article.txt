# Card hosts Fullerton
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
There's no place
like home for the
Stanford baseball
team.
The Cardinal
comes into today's
2 p.m. game

against Fullerton State at Sunken
Diamond with a 17-game home
winning streak. The team hasn't
lost at home since last April 10,
when UCLA thumped the Cardi
nal 14-6, and has won 28 of its
last 30 home games.
The Fullerton State series,
which will continue with games
at noon tomorrow and at 1 p.m.
Sunday, is the first real test of
the season for the Cardinal.
In its first two games of the
season — a 3-2 loss Sunday and
a 3-2 win Monday, both against
Santa Clara — the No. 2 Cardinal
had excellent pitching. In its third
game of the season — a 13-8 win
over UC-Davis on Tuesday — the
team had excellent hitting.
The Cardinal will need both
against Fullerton State. The
Titans, defending champions of
the Pacific Coast Athletic Associ
ation, are ranked 10th nationally
in the ESPN/Collegiate Baseball
pre-season poll, and 17th in the
Baseball America poll. They are
2-3 so far in 1988, having beaten
Cal Poly-Pomona, lost two out of
three to Chapman College, and
lost another to USC.
After getting only six hits and
five runs in the first two games
of the season, the Cardinal ex
ploded for 14 hits — including six
doubles and a home run — against
UC-Davis. "That's huge," junior
Ed Sprague said. "It got things
going, and that's key before a
three-game series like Fullerton."
The Titans are led by right
handed pitchers Longo Garcia
(10-5 with a 3.88 ERA last year)
an ! Mark Beck (6-3, 3.12). Garcia
will start tomorrow's game and
Beck will get the nod on Sunday.
Paul Johnson will take the mound
for Fullerton State today.
The probable starters for Stan
ford are freshman Stan Spencer
today, freshman Mike Mussina to
morrow and senior Lee Plemel on
Sunday
Spencer, from Vancouver,
Wash., started Tuesday's game
against UC-Davis, going throe in
nings and giving up one run on
two hits to pick up the first win

of his Stanford career. He threw
only 34 pitches against the Aggies,
and should be fully rested today.
Mussina, the highly touted
right-hander from Montoursville,
Pa., will make his Sunken Dia
mond debut after going five
strong innings last Sunday
against Santa Clara. He gave up
two runs on six hits and struck
out three against the Broncos, but
took the loss to go 0-1 on the year.
Plemel is 1-0 on the year after
tossing a complete-game nine
hitter against Santa Clara in a
game that begar< last Friday, was
suspended because of rain in the
bottom of the third inning and
was completed Monday.
After the Cardinal's meager of
fensive production in the first two
games of the season, Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess juggled the
lineup for Tuesday's game against
UC-Davis. Junior second baseman
Frank Carey was moved into the
lead-off spot, and responded by
going two for four. Sophomore
Eric Cox was moved into the des
ignated hitter spot in place of
senior Jeff Saenger, and stroked
a big double. And freshman Mike
Eicher started his first game in
center field, and went two for four
with a double and three RBIs.
Marquess said he will continue
to shift the lineup. "I've got to
tinker with it a little bit," he said.
Center field — where Eicher,
junior Jack Hollis and junior Eric
DeGraw have all seen action —
is the position most clearly up for
grabs. Hollis will start there in
today's game, Marquess said.
Card notes
Former Stanford star Jack
McDowell is featured on the cover of
the February issue of Sport magazine.
McDowell, who was 13-5 for the Car
dinal last year, went 3-0 in four starts
for the Chicago White Sox after a
late-season call-up and is part of
Sport's article on major-league new
comers to watch. The Baltimore
Orioles' Pete Stanicek, an AU-
American second baseman for the
Cardinal in 1985, is also mentioned
in the article.
Stanford first baseman Ron Wit
meyer has four hits on the season,
three of which are doubles. All three
of his doubles were rockets down the
right field line. Witmeyer, a junior,
had 17 doubles last year, putting him
in a tie for fourth on Stanford's all
time single-season list. The Stanford
single-season record for doublet is 20,
set by Mike Toothman in 1981 and
tied by Paul Carey last year.
