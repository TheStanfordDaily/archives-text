While Stan
ford's Patrick
McEnroe and
Jeff Tarango
were quietly
winning their
first-round

matches yesterday at the men's
Rolex National Indoor Intercol
legiate Tennis Championships
at the 98th Street Racquet
Club in Minneapolis, Curtis
Dunn was busy making the big
gest splash of his three-year
Cardinal career.
Dunn, a junior who isn't in
Stanford's starting singles or
doubles lineup and was only
able to join the elite field by
winning a regional qualifying
tournament, stunned No. 7
seed Johan Donar of Miami
(Fla.) 6-4, 6-1. Donar is the
nation's eighth-ranked player.
"It's a great win for Curtis
because qualifying is one
thing," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said, "but he didn't play
great against San Jose State
(Tuesday). It's nice to see him
get the kinks out."
"He's improved a ton over
the course of the last two

years," Gould added. "He's
earned a chance to play and
he's taken advantage of it."
In a rare tournament devel
opment, Dunn will face one of
his teammates today in the
second round. McEnroe, cur
rently the Cardinal's No. 2
singles player, advanced by be
sting Michigan's Malivai Wash
ington yesterday 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
Gould was surprised that
tournament officials had sched
uled the draw so two team
mates are forced to play each
other.
"That should never happen,"
he said. "That's a gross
negligence on the tour
nament's part. They (Dunn
and McEnroe) should never
play until the last possible
time."
Tarango, benefiting from a
back injury to Georgia's Chris
Garner, was ahead 6-5 in the
first set before Garner
withdrew from the first-round
match. Garner is one of several
highly-touted Bulldog fresh
men.
In a match between two of
the nation's best, Tarango,
presently No. 1 on the Stanford
singles ladder, faces SMU's
Tim Trigueiro today.
