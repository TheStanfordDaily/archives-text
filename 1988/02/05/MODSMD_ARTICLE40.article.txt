# Women make short work of Fresno St.

Kay Tittle appears
to have found the

matches.

The Stanford senior was on and
off the court in about 45 minutes
yesterday as she defeated Fresno
State's Kelly Borich 6-0, 6-2 in
the No. 4 singles match. Tittle's
victory was the beginning of the
end for the Bulldogs, as the Car
dinal rattled off five straight-set
victories in succession, en route
to an 8-1 win at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium.
The top-ranked Cardinal im
proved to 2-0 on the season.
Fresno dropped to 1-4.
Stanford was also victorious on
the road yesterday, as junior Eleni
Rossides and freshman Tami
Whitlinger posted first-round vic
tories at the Rolex National In
door Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships. Rossides upset
fourth-seeded Ronni Reis of
Miami (Fla.) 6-3, 6-2 to advance
to today's second round, where
she will meet USC freshman
Stephanie London.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
was not at all surprised by Ros
sides' upset of Reis. "I had no
doubt Eleni was going to win,"
he said. "Ronni Reis is a good
tennis player, but Eleni is better."
Whitlinger was also victorious

by a 6-3, 6-2 score, besting
Trinity's Jane Holdren. Today she
meets Kelly Mulvihill of Indiana
in the second round.
At Stanford, the Cardinal's win
was once again fashioned by a
combination of the old and the
new. Just as they had Wednesday
against Pacific, seniors Tittle and
Cari Hagey, and freshmen Teri
Whitlinger and Sandra Birch
pounded out easy singles victories
yesterday against the Bulldogs.
Tittle's win may have been
easy, but her return from arthro
scopic surgery on both knees in
December has not been. Tittle
played both singles and doubles
yesterday, but she is not confident
that she could pull double duty
against a better team.
"At this point I'm not ready to
be playing higher than six (her
regular spot) against a good team
and then play doubles," Tittle
said. "I feel relatively solid, but
it gets sore, and the more you
move around against good players
the more fatigued you get."
Tittle has been a mainstay in
the Cardinal doubles lineup the
past three years, but at the outset
of this season she will play singles
exclusively when Rossides and
Tami Whitlinger return. Tittle
said that she may move back into
doubles later in the season "if it
looks like different combinations
would do better."
"Last year we changed (the
doubles lineup) a week before

nationals," she added, "but if they
(this year's teams) are playing
well we shouldn't change, because
they'll have more experience."
A lack of experience hasn't af
fected Birch or Teri Whitlinger in
their opening dual matches this

week. Whitlinger routed Fresno's
Valerie Stukovsky 6-1, 6-1 in the
No. 3 match, and Birch rolled to
a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Julia
Frasier in the No. 2 singles.
Stanford's other singles wins
came from sophomore Valerie
Wilson at No. 5 (6-4, 6-2 over
Jandrea Ouwendijk) and Hagey
at No. 6 (6-2, 6-2 over Tara Eden).
The Bulldogs' lone victory came
in the No. 1 singles match.
