# Women's hoops a Goliath in Arizona
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
When the Arizona men's bas
ketball team entered Maples
Pavilion last night, it came in
as the team to beat. The Stan
ford women's basketball team
can empathize with this posi
tion.

No. 10 Stanford is on the road to face
Arizona State tonight and Arizona on Satur
day, the squads holding down the bottom two
spots in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The Cardinal, on the other hand, currently
holds second place in the Pac-10 behind Wash
ington, the only team to defeat Stanford this

season. Nonetheless, Stanford's 18-1 record,
6-1 in league, keeps the Cardinal ahead of
the Huskies in the Associated Press poll by
one spot.
Thus, though the team leaves the Farm
this weekend as the clear favorite, it stands
to lose a great deal should it take the games
too lightly.
"Like the saying goes, on any given night
any team can beat any team," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "Every opponent on
our schedule presents a different challenge.
"Arizona and Arizona State are, on paper,
two of the seemingly weaker opponents and
we've beaten them, and that's the challenge.
They have the home-court advantage and the
revenge factor. These are the games that scare

me, because I hope our team knows they have
to work, not just show up."
Both the Sun Devils and the Wildcats could
put a lax Cardinal into dire straits quickly.
Arizona State is a small, fast, high-pressure
squad led by senior forward Shamona
Moseley's 15.5 points per game and 8.9
rebounds. However, if Stanford's inside game
remains as consistent as it has been in past
weeks, the Cardinal will be hard to stop.
"Arizona State is a really aggressive team,
a very physical team," VanDerveer said. "But
we have an advantage because Jill (Yanke),
Trisha (Stevens), Celeste (Lavoie) and Tammy
(Svoboda) are all scoring really well inside.

We have to take advantage of
that"
Arizona is proving to be little
competition for any of the Pac-10
schools, as is evidenced by the
Cardinal's 101-71 trouncing of
Arizona at Maples Pavilion one
month ago.
However, senior center Dana
Patterson — who led both teams
in that game with an impressive
28 points and 13 boards — could
make Stanford's life miserable in
side.
"She's a tough player inside,"

Lavoie recalled. "We have to play
really really strong (against her).
We have to go out in both games
and play really intense."
Motivation has yet to be a prob
lem for Stanford's starting
guards, sophomore Jennifer Azzi
and freshman Sonja Henning.
Henning has kept control of the
Cardinal's ever-improving half
court offense, while Azzi has ex
ploded outside to lead the team
in three-pont shots and steals
aJong with leading the Pac-10 in
assists.
If this level of play continues
into games 20 and 21, the
remainder of the year looks espe
cially fruitful for the Cardinal.
