They hardly
had time to
catch their
breath....
Right after
Stanford's
quickly improv-

ing men's volleyball team
thrashed Loyola-Marymount
on Wednesday for its first
league win of the season, the
Cardinal is making its final
preparations for a weekend of
play that will take the squad
to UC-Davis on Friday and
Chico State on Saturday.
Although the Cardinal is cer
tainly a heavy favorite in both
matches this weekend, Stan
ford Coach Fred Sturm is not
one to measure success by wins
and losses.
"Every time you take the
floor, it is an opportunity for
your team to improve," Sturm
said. "At this stage of the
season, that is all I am looking
for from the guys, especially in
non-league matches like the
two coming up."
Davis, ironically coached by
former Stanford standout
Jc nyth Gearhart, who played
under Sturm from 1979-1983,
will provide the Cardinal with
a good test. The Aggies, a club
team in pursuit of varsity
status, is a big, powerful team,
a la UCLA, although certainly

not as skillful as the No. 2
Bruins.
"We're big and young and
inexperienced," Gearhart said.
"We'll have to play the game
of our lives to upset the Car
dinal."
Davis, 4-0 in match play and
2-0 in the Northern California
Collegiate Volleyball League,
was defeated by Stanford ear
lier in the year. The Cardinal
beat the Aggies in the UC-
Santa Barbara tournament in
a match that Gearhart said
"wasn't as close as the scores
indicated."
But the Sacramento area is
certainly pumped up about its
volleyball, and that fan support
will be a tough enough
obsctacle for Stanford to over
come. "There's a hell of a lot
of volleyball interest around
here," Davis Club Sport Direc
tor Gary Kohlberg said.
Kohlberg is hoping his squad
will play competitively against
schools like Stanford, thereby
assisting his effort to bring var
sity recognition to his squad
and others like it around the
country.
Chico State, another club
team who plays in the NCCVL,
should not give the Cardinal
quite as much trouble as the
Aggies. The Wildcats, 1-1 in
league play, are a shorter team
still looking for consistent play
from the bulk of their team
members.
