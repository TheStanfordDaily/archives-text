# Men's gymnasts practice being perfect
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
It you rein the
stands, this is
where the fun
starts. For the
performers on the
floor, however, it's
time to get serious.

Since they first began preparing
for the 1988 season last summer,
the Stanford men's gymnasts
have been improvising, ex
perimenting and perfecting,
trying to achieve the "ultimate"
routines. This, after all, is ex
pected to be the best season in
the history of Cardinal gymnas
tics. A finish worse than third at
April's NCAA Championships will
be disappointing; only a first-place
trophy will be fully satisfying.
While the training was by no
means easy, it did not include the
pressure the rest of the season
will. The Cardinal (4-0) visits Cal
ifornia tonight at 7:30. Sunday at
2 p.m., Maples Pavilion will be
the site of the team's first home
meet of the season against San
Jose State.
This weekend's meets mark the
beginning of the Cardinal's full
fledged charge for a national title.
Despite the importance of the
competitions — and the pressure
involved in striving toward supe
rior performance — victory itself
will not be difficult. Already this
winter, Stanford has beaten Cal
once and San Jose State twice.
Next weekend, the Cardinal will
be in Los Angeles for the UCLA
Invitational. The meet will be a
mini-NCAA competition, with
most of the nation's finest com
peting. Despite the importance of
recording solid scores this
weekend, the Cardinal is setting
its sights on the Invitational.
"We're trying to examine our

team strength this weekend,"
Stanford Asst. Coach Ted Ed
wards said. "For the most part,
the routines are pretty well set.
It's time to look at consis
tency. . . . We want to see if the
lineup we have in mind is most
effective."
Whatever that lineup, senior

Randy Besosa will be a major part
of it. The nation's No. 1 collegian
for much of the 1986 season, Be
sosa redshirted last year. Earlier
this week, however, he sustained
a shoulder injury that may keep
him out of action this weekend.
According to sophomore Conrad
Voorsanger, the Cardinal is nearly

prepared to prove it is equal to
the difficult task it has set before
itself. "I'd say we're all ready,
we're all ripe. Adam (Forman)
needs a little bit more time, I
think, to put it all together and
Randy's got that shoulder. . . .
We're going to take both meets
very seriously."
