Local governments can
create effective foreign policies
that complement or circum
vent U.S. foreign policy, the
founder and president of the
Center for Innovative
Diplomacy said in a speech last
night at Synergy.
Michael Shuman, who grad
uated from Stanford in 1979
and from Stanford Law School
in 1982, founded CID in 1986.
Based in San Francisco, CID
provides information about in
volvement in foreign affairs to
city governments nationwide.
The organization also helps or
ganize offices for "foreign af
fairs" within city governments.
Shuman said recent foreign
policy decisions — notably Con
gress' rejection of President
Reagan's Contra aid package
and the president's support of
arms control — clearly show
the power of "municipal
foreign policy."
"I feel that the decision

Congress made Wednesday to
turn down President Reagan's
Contra aid package was just
the latest success story in the
history of municipal foreign
policy," he said.
Shuman also contended that
the passage of nuclear freeze
resolutions by 900 U.S.
municipalities, in addition to
lobbying pressure for arms con
trol in Washington, "forced
Reagan to go to Geneva to
negotiate on strategic weapons,
and ultimately to sign the
Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty."
Shuman also defended the
legality of municipal involve
ment in foreign affairs, noting
that "American cities have
been making treaties and trade
agreements with Canada for
200 years." Currently, he said,
200 cities have trade agree
ments with cities abroad.
Shuman was the fifth in
Synergy's Alternative Careers
speakers series.
