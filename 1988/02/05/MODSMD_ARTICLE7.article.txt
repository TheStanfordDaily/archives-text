smashes of violence introduced
Edward Said's keynote speech
at the opening of the "Talking
Terrorism" conference last
night in Cubberley
Auditorium. The intense mu
sical memorial for a victim of
terrorism set the tone for an
innovative look at terrorism
that will continue through Sat
urday.
More than 400 people packed
Cubberley to hear Said, a pro
fessor of English and Compar
ative Literature at Columbia
University and a prominent ex

pert on the Middle East. In a
speech titled "Identity, Nega
tion and Violence," Said ad
dressed the distortion of the
meaning of "terrorism" in the
media and government.
Outside the auditorium, 12
television screens broadcast
news clips and slides of terror
ist incidents. Additionally,
three computers featured pro
grams designed to illustrate
participants' preconceptions
about terrorism.
The purpose of this

violence," according to Italian
Prof. Beverly Allen, who convened
the conference.
Said, the well-known author of
"Orientalism" and other books
about stereotypes of the Middle
East, focused on the effect patri
otism has on Western views of
the Middle East.

"Terrorism in the West is sub
liminally associated with Islam â€”
images of bearded clerics, Iranian
mullahs and remorseless tur
baned crowds," he said. "Then
there is the string of Palestinian
terrorists who are mass killers
and who are assumed to have
started the problem."
Citing an "isolation of terrorism
from representations of most
other dysfunctions and maladies
of the contemporary world," Said
added that government officials

dismiss any explanation of terror
ism except for one that will help
defeat it.
Said claimed there are "few
ways of talking about terrorism
without ninning into propoganda.
. . . There is a process whereby
various identities merge with each
other. The terrorists are Islamic
and communist while the anti
communists fit around the term.
"There is a manifest difficulty
of escaping patriotism. We have
biases that permeate our core."

Referring to the works of Vico
and Foucault, Said described the
origin of terror as a "means to
quell the primal disorder of
human beings."
He also addressed the Western
Culture debate, saying that
"reclaiming our tradition" may
come at the expense of other cul
tures.
Said's speech was the keynote
address of the terrorism forum,
which will continue through Sat
urday.
