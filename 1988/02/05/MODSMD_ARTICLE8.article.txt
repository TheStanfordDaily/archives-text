# Grad students may lose housing
## Students fight co-op changes 
### James Mokhiber Staff writer 
Stanford co-op residents have joined
with graduate students to challenge a
recent University decision that would
reduce the number of graduate students
living in co-ops by more than a third
next year.
The letter-writing and petition
signing campaign asks the Office of Res
idential Education to reconsider its de
cision to convert 16 spots reserved for
graduate students in co-ops into under
graduate spaces.
"They should be encouraging us to
stay instead of taking away our spots,"
said Ashish Karamchandani, a fourth
year graduate student in engineering
and the financial manager at Theta Chi,
a co-op on Campus Drive. Because co
ops have no resident fellows, graduate
students are a main source of "mature
influence" there, Karamchandani said.
According to Rodger Whitney, assis
tant dean of Student Affairs and direc
tor of housing, the plan is part of an

"overall strategy to share the burden"
caused by the closing of Roble Hall.
Graduate housing spaces at Mirrielees
and Manzanita Park will also be subject
to "fair and equitable cuts" of a roughly
equal percentage, he said.
But while fewer graduate students
will be assigned to housing in co-ops as
long as Roble remains uninhabitable,
Whitney said the overall number of
graduate student spaces will increase
next year when the new graduate
housing complex between Mirrielees
and Bowdoin Street is opened.
While acknowledging that housing for
undergraduates must be found, those
opposed to the plan argue that the cuts
will hit co-ops harder than other
residences.
"Although the percentage cuts may
be roughly equal between Manzanita
Park, Mirrielees and the co-ops, other
alternatives exist for those graduate stu
dents who wish to live in apartments
such as Escondido Village and the new
graduate complex on Bowdoin Street,"

Karamchandani said. "For those who
wish to live with undergraduates there
is no alternative."
Other students oppose the plan be
cause they said it would make it more
difTficult for international students to
learn about college life in the United
States.
"Understanding Stanford means
knowing undergraduate life," said
Andreas Weigend, a second-year grad
uate student in physics from West Ger
many. "I didn't learn about Americans
through books but by living with them."
Weigend and others propose that four
additional trailers be reassigned to un
dergraduates in Manzanita Park, thus
maintaining the current ratio of
graduates to undergraduates within the
co-ops. In a letter to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson,
Weigend and two other graduate stu
dents call upon the University to dis
tribute the 16 spots between Mirrielees,
Crothers Memorial and Escondido Vil
lage.
