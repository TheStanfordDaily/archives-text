The "mission of a free press" in the
United States is to give "democracy the
facts that enable the people to control
those governing them," New York Times
columnist and two-time Pulitzer Prize
winner Anthony Lewis said here last
night.
In a speech titled "Our Revolutionary
First Amendment" at Kresge
Auditorium, Lewis defended the right
tc free speech against recent impinge
ments by the executive branch.
By contrasting American law with
recent British cases involving freedom
of speech, Lewis emphasized the impor
tance of the First Amendment in
shaping American society.
Quoting the opinion of former Su
preme Court Justice Hugo Black in a
freedom of speech case, Lewis read, "It
is a prized American privilege to speak
one's mind about all public institutions,

. . . government policies, and the people
who make them."
"With that," Lewis said, Black "cap
tured the instinctive quality of our cul
ture ... the unruly, unrestrained way
in which we examine the way American
policy is made, savaged and remade."
Lewis discussed several Supreme
Court decisions made during the past
20 years that have centered around the
battle between national security and free
speech interests. He concluded that
despite victories such as the famous Pen
tagon Papers case, in which the New
York Times was permitted to publish
stories that involved classified govern
ment information about Vietnam, jour
nalists should be worried as long as
executive branch claims of national se
curity interests continue to persuade the
Court.
"I think the American press should
not be complacent about its freedom to
report what the government is doing,"
said Lewis.
