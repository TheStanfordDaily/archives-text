# Stanford settles lawsuit
## 
### Glen Tripp Staff writer 
Stanford has agreed to pay
$50,000 to a former University of
Minnesota career testing consul
tant in an out-of-court settlement
that ends a four-year-old court
battle over the rights to a
University-published vocational
interest test.
Under the terms of the Jan. 28
agreement, David Campbell, a
testing consultant who directed
revisions of the Strong Vocational
Interest Blank test from 1966 to
1974, will receive the court settle
ment in lieu of future royalties
and all other University obliga
tions to him under four publish
ing contracts.
The agreement stems from a
1984 suit brought against Stan
ford by Campbell concerning a
"competing works" clause found
in a contract giving the University
rights to the test. The clause man
dates that Campbell not produce
a similar test competing with the
Strong test.
Such clauses are common, ac
cording to Grant Barnes, director
of Stanford University Press,
which publishes the test.
Campbell contended that the
clause prohibited him from prac
ticing his profession because he
wanted the freedom to publish a
similar test.
The settlement cancels this
clause, along with the rest of
Campbell's contracts, and all
copyrights remain with Stanford.
Iris Brest, a vice-president in
the office of the General Counsel,
said yesterday she was pleased
with the outcome. "We're very
happy," she said, adding that
Stanford did well with the com
promise.
Barnes pointed out that al
though the University had a po
tentially good case against
Campbell, continued legal fees
alone would have exceeded
$50,000. "I'm glad to get out of
this," he said.
Campbell could not be reached
for comment.
Working with Magistrate
Patricia Turnbull of the Federal
District Court in San Jose, both
sides agreed on Jan. 28 to cancel
existing contracts for the test and
an associated handbook and
manual. This allows Stanford
Univeristy Press to reinstate ar
rangements made in 1983 with
Consulting Psychologists Press of
Palo Alto for exclusive distribu
tion of the test.
