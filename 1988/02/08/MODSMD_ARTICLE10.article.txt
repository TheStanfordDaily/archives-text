# Terrorism conference attacks misconceptions
## 
### Jay Bhattacharya Staff writer 
The three-day "Talking Ter
rorism" conference closed Sat
urday with an anthropologist's
personal account of the "terror"
he felt living with the threat of
Columbian death squads, and a
defense attorney's analysis of
worldwide government policies
toward terrorist groups.
The presentations, held in
Cubberley Auditorium before a
100-member audience, capped a
program that strove to educate
about the motivations behind
terrorism and explore its differ
ent definitions.
ABC-TV's "Nightline" pro
gram and the Institute for the
Study of Social Change at UC-
Berkeley were among the spon
sors of the event.
Saturday's program was,
however, shortened by the ill
ness of two of the four scheduled
speakers.
The remaining speakers were
Ulrich Preuss, dean of the Uni
versity of Bremen Law School,
and Michael Taussig, professor
of anthropology at University of
Michigan.
Taussig recalled his experi
ence being linked to people in
cluded on a government death
list during the course of his
anthropological studies in Co
lumbia, and described the at
mosphere of "paranoid fear"
created by the death squads
there.

In Columbia "a state of emer
gency has become the norm,"
he said. People are forced to
treat terror as a usual oc
curence.
From a political standpoint,
Preuss defined terrorism as "a
strategy to exert influence
through violent coercion" and
create "public fear."
Modern states treat terrorism
as a "criminal act," according
to Preuss, who explained that
any other response would
threaten the government's

"moral justification for exis
tence (which is) . . preservation
of state order."
This definition allows govern
ments to dismiss potential po
litical opponents as mere "ter
rorists" and ignore the motiva
tions behind their actions, he
said.
Contrary to popular belief, in
ternational terrorists are nei
ther new nor as violent or out
rageous as their predecessors,
