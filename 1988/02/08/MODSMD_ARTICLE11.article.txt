# Band is planning trip Down Under
## 
### Eric Rosenfeld 
The Stanford Band may be
going under — Down Under, that
is. The Band has been invited to
represent California at the 1988
World Exposition in Brisbane,
Australia this summer.
Citing the Band's "unique pas
sion for California lifestyle,
jocularity and intellect," Alan
Goldstein, chief commissioner of
the California exhibit, extended
an invitation to the Band to per
form in the California Pavilion
July 15 and 16.
California is one of several
states planning to operate a sep
arate pavilion at the Expo.
About 70 to 80 band members,
plus this year's and next year's
Dollies and the tree mascot, could
make the July 7-22 journey, ac
cording to Phil Cline, fund-raising
coordinator for the trip.
"For two weeks the Band could
appear at Australian universities
and perform in various parades,"
explained Cline. "And during Cal
ifornia Week the Band would play
for two days at the California
Pavilion at a big beach party. Of
course, in Australia, this would
be in the middle of winter."
To cover expenses, the march
ing band must first raise roughly
$250,000. "We expect each band
member to foot $500 to $600;
we're working hard to reduce the
costs," Cline said.

"We're currently trying to raise
money from band alumni and also
working to get corporate sponsor
ships. I think the chances (of
going) are good," he added.
"The University has been ver
bally very supportive, but it hasn't
come forward with any money
yet," Cline said, noting that at
the moment fund raising is diffi
cult because of competition from
the Centennial Campaign and the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra,
which is also raising money for a
trip to the Far East.
The Band hopes to know by
March whether enough money
has been raised for the trip to be
feasible. "Band members need to
know if we are going before they
make final plans for summer
jobs," Cline said.
It appears unlikely that the
Band will be able to perform its
trademark football halftime show
at the California Pavilion. "We
would have to play like we were
at a basketball game — no chance
for political commentary or
satire," said Cline. "We haven't
committed yet, but this would be
an occasion to represent the Cal
ifornia spirit.
"I suppose our style would be
more in keeping with Australian
joviality. We'll play our regular
repertory of rock 'n' roll and Stan
ford fight songs," said Cline.
