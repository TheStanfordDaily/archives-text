# Campus thefts spark concern
## 
### Thomas Vajda Staff writer 
A recent increase in personal
computer theft on campus has
caught the attention of many stu
dents. However, such thefts ac
count for only a small percentage
of stolen property at Stanford, ac
cording to Stanford Police Cnief
Marvin Herrington.
Herrington said bicycles and ar
ticles in automobiles — including
stereos — often provide the
easiest targets for thieves on
campus. Since the beginning of
this year, for example, there have
been 37 bicycles reported stolen,
19 cases of theft from locked
automobiles, one automobile, one
motorcycle and two scooter thefts.
Seven computers have been re
ported stolen since the beginning
of this year.
Because there are usually only
three patrol cars on campus, spot
ting and apprehending individuals
during a crime is difficult with
such a large area to cover, accord
ing to Herrington.
In addition, many sections of
campus, such as dormitory areas,
are difficult to patrol and access
by automobile. Making an arrest
is also difficult once a crime has
been successfully committed and
the criminal has left the scene,
he said.
Students and other community

members may therefore be the
police department's most impor
tant source for tips on suspicious
activity, according to Herrington.
"Typically, if we get a break it's
because somebody saw something
and calls us," he said.
Unfortunately, according to
Herrington, only about 10 percent
of stolen items are recovered.
Criminals tend to dispose of stolen
goods very quickly, making them
difficult to trace.
Herrington added that even if
some stolen property is recovered,
the item may often not be
matched with the owner unless
the victim has written down or
engraved a serial number for iden
tification.
Students often fail to do this,
though. Herrington estimated
that half of all stolen bikes are
not licensed, further reducing the
chances of recovery.
Herrington said high school
students account for a large per
centage of bike thefts, especially
in warmer weather. However, "oc
casionally we will get what we
think is a professional, because
in one night we'll have a rash of
10 to 12 (expensive) bikes stolen,"
he said.
According to Herrington, "very
few" Stanford students are ever
involved in thefts of more expen
sive property such as stereos or
bikes.
