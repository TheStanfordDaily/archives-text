Arafat orders 2 hostages freed
SIDON, Lebanon — PLO guerrillas yester
day surrounded a house holding two kidnapped
Scandinavian United Nations employees and
their abductors, and PLO chief Yasser Arafat
ordered the hostages freed.
The Palestine Liberation Organization's
Sidon commander, Anwar Madi, who issued
the order in this southern Lebanese port city,
said his guerrillas might use force to release
the two captives.
Sources close to Madi said the two captives
— United Nations Relief and Works Agency
employees Jan Stening, 44, of Sweden, and
William Jorgensen, 58, of Norway — were
being held in a deserted house that had been
encircled by PLO guerrillas near Sidon's Ein
el-Hilweh refugee camp.
"We have clear orders from Arafat to storm
the hideout if the captors fail to free the two
captives peacefully," said one source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
Stening and Jorgensen were traveling in an
UNRWA car from their base in the southern
Lebanese port of Tyre to Beirut on Friday
when they were intercepted and kidnapped by
masked gunmen on Sidon's southern outskirts.
U.S. warns of troop removal
MUNICH, West Germany — U.S. Secretary
of Defense Frank Carlucci warned Western
Europeans here yesterday that America might
be forced to withdraw its troops from West
Germany if that country decided to ban nuclear
weapons from its territory.
His warning was implicitly supported by
several of the U.S. senators who also have
been attending the 25th annual Wehrkunde
(Defense Studies) conference, which brings to
gether nearly 200 defense and strategic-arms
experts from both sides of the Atlantic.
The theme of this year's conference was a
policy for the North Atlantic Treaty Organi
zation in the aftermath of December's signing
in Washington of a superpower treaty to
abolish all ground-launched medium- and
shorter-ranger nuclear weapons (those with
ranges from 300 to about 3,400 miles).
NATO's policy has been to seek a consensus
now to move ahead on reduction of conven
tional military hardware and manpower, while
at the same time retaining short-range nuclear
arms in Europe and also upgrading and moder
nizing them.
Such plans for the short-range weapons,
those with ranges below 300 miles, have en
countered resistance and apprehension in West
Germany, not only among the population, as
evidenced in public opinion polls, but within
the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Haiti leader vows democracy
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — In a subdued
ceremony that reflected public weariness after
months of bitter turmoil, Haiti yesterday in
augurated a new and controversial president
who pledged immediately to end 30 years of
totalitarianism with "a new era of democracy."
President Leslie Manigat, a 57-year-old po
litical scientist and winner of a flawed election
that most of his countrymen boycotted,
promised national reconciliation, liberty and
justice without vengeance to this poorest of
Western Hemisphere nations.
As Manigat recited his oath of office in
sweltering morning sunshine outside the
newly-revived Haitian Parliament, the military
officers who were widely accused of rigging
his election on Jan. 17 after aborting an earlier
election attempt amid bloodshed last Nov. 29,
saluted smartly and symbolically withdrew
from the presidential platform to demonstrate
what the new civilian leader called their return
to the barracks.
