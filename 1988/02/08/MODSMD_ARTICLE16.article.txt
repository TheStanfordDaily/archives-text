# Noriega recalls diplomats from U.S.
## 
### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama - React
ing to drug charges lodged against him
last week in the United States,
Panama's military ruler, Gen. Manuel
Noriega, took steps yesterday to dis
tance his government from Washing
ton and to squeeze his opponents at
home.
He recalled the three top U.S.-based
Panamanian diplomats, including his
ambassador to the United States, and
ordered Panamanian military students
in the United States to return home.
Noriega also called for a criminal probe
of Panamanians who accused him of
drug smuggling. In addition, police
shut down an opposition newspaper
that in recent days had roundly
criticized the military strongman.
The flurry of activity followed the
return of two federal indictments in
Florida last week that charged Noriega
with drug trafficking and money laun
dering. The Panamanian government
warned Friday that "unforeseen reac
tions" might result from the charges.
Taken as a whole, the diplomatic
and domestic moves suggested that
Noriega was preparing to fight hard
to retain his hold on power and that

relations between the United States
and this strategically situated tropical
nation would deteriorate further while
the battle wages.
For eight months, Noriega has been
resisting calls from opponents here
and abroad for him to step down.
Washington has cut off both military
and economic aid to this country while
pressing the Defense Forces, Panama's
sole military and police organization,
to give up its political power, permit
free elections and a return the country
to effective civilian rule.
Noriega recalled Juan Sosa, the
Panamanian ambassador to Washing
ton, as well as Roberto Leyton,
Panama's envoy to the Organization
of American States in Washington, and
Jorge Ritter, the country's ambassador
to the United Nations. It was not im
mediately clear how long Noriega
would keep them from their posts;
government radio reports said Sunday
that they were ordered back to
Panama for "consultations."
Diplomatic observers here suspected
that Noriega would instruct the OAS
and U.N. ambassadors to defend him
publicly in the forums of those inter

national organizations.
"It looks like the whole government
will be mobilized in his defense," one
Latin American diplomat said.
U.S. Embassy officials here said that
they were not told directly about the
recalls and had only read about them
in government newspapers.
The withdrawal of military students
from the United States was mainly
symbolic. Department of Defense
sources in Washington said that about
40 officers of the Defense Forces are
usually in the United States at a given
time attending officers' candidate
schools or receiving advanced training
at the Inter-American Defense College.
In a letter published in the
government-owned newspaper La
Republica, Noriega ordered Panama's
attorney general to find out who is
responsible for accusations made
against him in the United States and
to bring them to trial. Panamanian
observers speculated that the probe
would first target former Noriega as
sociates Jose Blandon, who testified
to a Miami grand jury last month.
In his letter, Noriega said that U.S.
Department of Justice prosecutors

have "made public an indictment
against me for false crimes" and he
ordered that those responsible for the
"slanderous imputations" be brought
to justice.
Neither Noriega nor the attorney
general, Carlos Villalaz, could be
reached for comment yesterday.
Notably absent from any mention in
the letter was President Eric Delvalle,
the country's nominal civilian chief of
state. Under Panamanian law, it would
be Delvalle, not Noriega, who would
ordinarily request the attorney general
to conduct an investigation.
Yesterday morning, plainclothes
police stormed and occupied the oppo
sition newspaper El Siglo, witnesses
and officials of the newspaper said. It
was the second closure of a news
medium within a week. On Friday,
Radio Continente was shut down after
broadcasting live an account of the
indictments from Washington.
"When the government feels weak,
it begins to act like this," said Mayin
Correa, an editor at El Siglo and a
commentator on Radio Continente.

the letter was President Eric Delvalle,
the country's nominal civilian chief of
state. Under Panamanian law, it would
be Delvalle, not Noriega, who would
ordinarily request the attorney general
to conduct an investigation.
Yesterday morning, plainclothes
police stormed and occupied the oppo
sition newspaper El Siglo, witnesses
and officials of the newspaper said. It
was the second closure of a news
medium within a week. On Friday,
Radio Continente was shut down after
broadcasting live an account of the
indictments from Washington.
"When the government feels weak,
it begins to act like this," said Mayin
Correa, an editor at El Siglo and a
commentator on Radio Continente.
