# West Bank erupts in violence; 3 Arabs killed

BEIT UMMAR, Occupied West
Bank — The southern half of the
Israeli-occupied West Bank, a region
that had been relatively quiet during
the two-month-long wave of Palestin
ian unrest, yesterday exploded in vio
lence that left at least three persons
dead and more than a dozen injured
in clashes with Israeli troops.
It was one of the worst days of
rioting since the disturbances began
in early December.
Two other Palestinians injured last
week died of their wounds yesterday,
bringing the Arab death toll to at least
49 over the past two months. No Is
raelis have been killed in the disturb
ances.
One of yesterday's dead, a 15-year
old resident of a Gaza Strip refugee
camp who was killed by a blow to the
head, may be the first fatality from
the Israeli army's policy of beating
alleged rioters.

At least four neighborhoods in
predominantly Arab East Jerusalem
also were hit by renewed violence. The
army, invoking seldom-used emer
gency powers for the second time in
16 days, imposed a curfew on a refugee
camp inside the city limits.
Tensions have been building in the
south since the middle of last week,
when some of the Jewish settlers who
live in the area began organized re
taliation against stone throwers in vil
lages along the main highway. Settler
vigilantes have invaded some Arab vil
lages, smashing car windows and
hauling off suspected assailants.
Then on Friday, the National Com
mittee for the Uprising in the Ter
ritories a clandestine steering group
led by the Palestine Liberation Organ
ization, which is outlawed by Israel,
and various nationalist factions, issued
its sixth leaflet calling for increased
rioting and for demonstrations yester

day. A radio station apparently broad
casting from Damascus chided Arabs
in the southern city of Hebron and
surrounding villages for not participat
ing in the uprising of recent weeks.
The combination of the two volatile
elements — the call for protests and
the panic touched off in many villages
by rumors of settler incursions — set
off the new round of violence that
began Saturday night, according to
army officers and some residents.
The worst incident was here in Beit
Ummar, a small village north of
Hebron, where three residents were
shot dead by soldiers in a clash yes
terday morning. Witnesses said the
trouble began when residents heard
rumors that settlers had fired shots
into the neighboring village of Arub
and were heading toward Beit Ummar,
12 miles south of Jerusalem.
Dozens of residents, urged on by

cries of "the Jews are attacking"
broadcast over a loudspeaker at the
local mosque, blocked the road into
town and threw rocks and bottles at
soldiers there, the army said. Rein
forcements arrived and tried to push
the mob back with tear gas and rubber
bullets. When the crowd surged again
toward the main Jerusalem-Hebron
highway, the troops opened fire.
The army put the total wounded at
six from all incidents yesterday, but
doctors at Makassed Hospital in East
Jerusalem said they alone had received
12 gunshot-wound victims yesterday,
seven of them from Beit Ummar, and
11 people suffering from severe
beatings.
Rami Akluq, 15, died in Gaza shortly
after he arrived at the hospital yes
terday afternoon with head wounds
he suffered Saturday at the Deir Balah
refugee camp in Gaza.
