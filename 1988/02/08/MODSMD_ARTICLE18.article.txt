# Labor unions march to end wage controls
## 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — At
least 4,000 workers marched
peacefully yesterday through the
streets of Managua demanding an
end to wage controls and discrim
ination against anti-Sandinista
trade unions.
It was the largest labor demon
stration against the revolutionary
government in eight years of San
dinista rule and the opening salvo
in a new opposition effort to ex
ploit popular discontent with
Nicaragua's war-battered eco
nomy.
Since the lifting of a wartime
state of emergency last month,
dissidents are freer to stage such
protests, and workers have
regained the right to strike. Yes
terday, the police listened pas
sively to militant anti-Sandinista
chants for two hours as marchers
snaked through working-class
neighborhoods near Managua's
Eastern Market.
"This rally bears witness to the
discontent of workers who are
supposedly the backbone of the

revolution," labor leader Alvin
Guthrie told the crowd. "The
workers have learned that the
revolution is the road to back
wardness and hunger."
The march was organized by
all four anti-Sandinista labor
federations, which are allied with
the Social Christian, Social Dem
ocratic, Socialist and Communist
parties. They claim to represent
a third of the country's 300,000
unionized workers.
Leaders of the coalition said
that they will send written
demands to government officials
this week. They seek the end of
government-imposed wage con
trols, the right to free collective
bargaining with employers, and
the protection of state employees
from arbitrary dismissal.
They also demand equal access
to special government stores
where workers belonging to the
ruling party's Sandinista Workers
Central now buy basic consumer
goods at huge discounts.
