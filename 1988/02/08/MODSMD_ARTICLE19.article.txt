# Candidates make final push
## 
### 
DES MOINES, lowa — With mount
ing expectations of record turnouts, 11
Democratic and Republican candidates
barnstormed from pep rallies to church
pulpits and from pancake breakfasts to
makeshift television studios in a frantic
final push to rally their troops before
tonight's first major test of the 1988
presidential campaign.
While the candidates led hordes of
reporters and camera crews around the
state, their field organizations reported
that "hard counts" — the number of
voters who say they definitely plan to
attend the caucuses — are rising dram
atically.
"We're busting our quotas all over
the state," said Jim Cunningham, a top
aide to the campaign of Rep. Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., "I didn't think we
were going to get a big turnout until
two weeks ago. Now, I think we are
going to set all kinds of records."
"The whole thing has grown exponen
tially — the amount of time candidates
have spent, the level of organization,
the media attention," said Steve
Murphy, Gephardt's lowa coordinator.
"I think we're going to get a lot of
walk-ins tomorrow night."

In caucus parlance, a "walk-in" is
someone not previously identified as a
likely caucus-goer. Given the hundreds
of thousands of telephone calls to voters
in recent weeks, it is hard to believe
there would be any walk-ins. But with
the unprecedented heavy use of paid
television advertising, the caucuses are
resembling what then-Republican can
didate Howard Baker called them during
the 1980 campaign: "the functional
equivalent of a primary."
Strategists for the major Democratic
competitors agree that Gephardt will
probably get the biggest boost from a
high turnout. Gephardt, well back in
the pack six weeks ago, goes into the
caucuses leading in all Democratic polls.
The biggest lowa turnouts to date
were in 1980, when 106,000 Republicans
and 100,000 Democrats attended
caucuses. Some Democrats estimate a
turnout as high as 125,000 to 150,000,
while on the Republican side, the infu
sions of tens of thousands of evangelicals
who have never before attended
caucuses should mean new records as
well.
