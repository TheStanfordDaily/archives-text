## Race hides issues 
### 
Racism is a very powerful
word. Unfortunately, it is
too often misused. The label
ing of people, actions and ideologies
as racist only serves to mask real
issues that need to be addressed
and resolved. Racism is properly
defined to be the belief that race
is the single determinant in human
traits and abilities.
But what whites and non-whites
commonly term as racism is
usually cultural discrimination.
Given that culture encompasses
the traditional beliefs, social struc
tures, material traits and history
of racial groups, cultural discrim
ination establishes that one culture
is more acceptable than another
simply because it is different.
Concrete examples of the confu
sion between culture and race can
be found in everyday racial inter
actions at Stanford. When a white
person says that their best friend
is black but different, how exactly
is that friend "different?"
The problem is one of culture.
How cultural identity is perceived,
identified and exhibited is the
heart of the issue in the above
examples and in the longstanding;
debates surrounding theme
houses, police harrassment here
and the Black Greek Letter Coun
cil. This year, the BSU and Club
Ujamaa have also come under fire.
This causes pressure to suppress
cultural identity, a pressure that
often manifests itself in criticisms
of the cross-cultural theme houses
and their roles at Stanford. Theme
houses are often wrongly viewed
as separatist, segregationist and
racist. They are even accused of
aggravating the problem of racism
by promoting anti-white ideas.
Views like these are rooted in ig
norance and prejudice.
Promoting an understanding of
cultural differences would help to
combat this problem. First, Resi
dential Education should provide

more support for cultural theme
houses and conduct public rela
tions activities, such as bringing
some theme programs to dorms on
opposite sides of campus. This way,
more students would get a glimpse
of what programming goes on in
theme houses.
Theme house residents are given
special priorities to live in the
houses and therefore have a re
sponsibility to educate others
about the cultures that are ex
plored in their houses. But the re
sponsibility is not theirs alone.
The great apathetic majority of
Stanford students have placed the
burden of proof on the theme
houses and their residents to dispel
negative misconceptions about the
role of theme houses. This is
clearly unfair. Students should
take Yolanda King's advice and get
off their apathy.
The function of cross-cultural
theme houses is to provide a cul
tural center where peoples of
African, Asian and Latino descent
can live together and share in the
exploration and celebration of their
cultures. At the same time, over
50 percent of all ethnic theme
house residents are not of these
three cultural groups. This is the
"cross" in cross-cultural.
Unfortunately, this ignorance,
apathy and inability to distinguish
between race and culture is shared
by students and administrators.
Once the difference between race
and culture is seen, the Western
Culture debate ceases to be a black
vs. white issue. The BSU, BGLC,
and cultural theme houses cease
to be segregationist, and the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Is
sues is allowed to address the real
problems in minority life. This dis
tinction needs to be recognized by
students, faculty and administra
tors so that the true functions of
ethnic organizations as cultural
diversifiers can be fully accepted.
