## Roble closure won't increase total student costs 
### 
A FEB. 3 STORY quoted Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons as
saying that the cost of repairs to
Roble Hall or the construction of new
housing to replace it would have to be
borne largely by students through an
increase in rental fees.
While that is not a false statement,
neither does it capture the whole
truth, which is that we don't expect
overall student charges to go up as a
result of these improvements.
The University does not run on
smoke â€” it requires real money for its
operation. Badly needed new housing
for students and the repair of Roble
will cost money.
Alumni and friends of Stanford will
help bear these costs, as they have in
the past, but it is unlikely that full
costs can be covered by gifts. The
balance will indeed be generated by

higher rental fees, as Dean Lyons
asserted, but that is not the end of the
story.
Room and board rates and tuition
charges are not set in isolation from
one another. Tuition is set with full
awareness of pending room and board
rates, and both are set with full atten
tion paid to the fairness of overall
costs to students and parents, to their
comparability to rates set by other
institutions and to the impact of rate
increases on financial aid.
Those setting charges also take into
account program improvements that
can be generated by increased funding
levels.
Important among those considera
tions is the comparison of Stanford's
overall charges to those of similar and
competitive institutions. Thus, it is not
an accident that, as room rents have

been driven up in recent years by the
need to finance the cost of Governor's
Corner, the graduate student housing
now under construction and improve
ments elsewhere among student
residences, increases in tuition rates
have been moderated.
Stanford's current undergraduate
tuition is 11th among major private
universities behind first place Har
vard's tuition, which is $1,000 higher.
Ten years ago, Stanford was third,
nearly $250 ahead of Harvard's eighth
position tuition charge.
During that same 10-year period,
Stanford's room and board rates
moved from ninth on the list to first.
Badly needed improvements in housing
at Stanford have been financed with
higher room rates, but the tuition
levels set have kept the overall level of

charges to students from rising in
proportion.
Ten years ago, Stanford was eighth
in overall charges; today it is 10th
behind Harvard, Dartmouth, Pennsyl
vania, Chicago, Yale, MIT, Brown,
Princeton and Columbia, in that order.
What is sacrificed in this process of
moderating total student charges when
housing improvements make large
demands on the University's budget
are other kinds of program improve
ments that Stanford would ordinarily
make.
Thus, the overall effect of making
necessary repairs to Roble will force
tough choices among competing pro
gram priorities but will probably not
cause students to pay higher combined
fees.
