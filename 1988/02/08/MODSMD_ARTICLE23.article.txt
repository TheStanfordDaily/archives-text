# Maynard is known as national figure
## 
### 
The content and tone of the Feb. 5
letter in The Daily blasting the choice
of Robert Maynard as commencement
speaker was both embarrassingly
juvenile and insulting.
Constant refrains of "who the hell"
is, chose or wanted Robert Maynard
are less an argument than self
incriminating narrowmindedness.
To begin, Robert Maynard is a noted
national figure: a syndicated columnist,
a major force in American journalism,
a commenator on important new
reviews, including the MacNeil/Lehrer
News Hour.
Any senior with even the slightest
appreciation of current events, politics,
regional affairs, the press — including,
we hope, political science, economics,
and international relations students —

would have had to be pretty insulated
not to have heard of Robert Maynard.
Where the hell have you guys been?
Secondly, the suggestion that
Maynard was chosen because he is
black is a gross insult to his stature,
importance and influence. It also
conies distressingly close to a racist
reaction, in our opinion.
One of us graduated in 1983. The
commencement speaker that year was
George Shultz, one of the "already
established personalities" that the
letter suggests would be more appro
priate than Maynard. Rather than
"wisdom and encouragement," the
speech that year gave us, instead, tired
platitudes, political cliches, little "en
couragement".
We are not Stanford seniors. There
fore we perhaps have less personal
interest in the choice of a commence
ment speaker. But on Commencement
Day, we would both be pleased to hear
a person of Robert Maynard's ac-

complishments speak to the Stanford
community.
