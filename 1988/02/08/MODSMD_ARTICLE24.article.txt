# Stop complaining about Maynard
## 
### 
The Feb. 5 letter from three seniors
criticizing the choice of Robert
Maynard as commencement speaker
was an interesting exercise in
petulance.
While it is understandable, after
three straight years of flashy
celebrities for commencement speakers,
that a fourth class would yearn for a
celebrity as well, the tone of the letter
suggested that Maynard should be
booted out on his face just because he
has no infamous deeds or notorious
characteristics in his portfolio.

I wonder who the three seniors
would have preferred to see. Gary
Hart? Mike Tyson? Why not go whole
hog and protest in front of University
President Donald Kennedy's office for
Bruce Springsteen (who, I'm sure,
would bring a particularly lyrical note
to the occasion, with his sundry
ruminations about the long and greasy
road ahead)?
There is nothing wrong with having
a man (or a woman) like Robert
Maynard speak at our commencement.
He might, in fact, be far more inter
esting because of his quiet movements
— beyond the glitz and glamour of
more stellar men like Ted Koppel —
than some glib, loud-mouthed People's
Choice candidate might be. (The com
parision here between, say, Mr. Mister
and the Replacements is an apt one.)
Let's stop whining and give the man
a chance.
