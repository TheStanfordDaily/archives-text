## Let students grow up 
### 
ARE STANFORD undergraduates
really the intellectual infants the
University makes them out to be?
By the age of 18, Stanford students have
the right to vote for this nation's leaders,
serve in its armed forces and drive on
its highways. While society in many ways
treats the average 18-year-old as an in
dependent adult, Stanford has chosen to
treat its alleged above-average 18-year
olds as infants.
Through its distribution requirements
and core reading list, Stanford presumes
that its undergraduates are unable to
determine what is in their best educa
tional interests, what classes to take and
what books to read.
The debate over changing the Western
Culture requirement has brought out this
unstated attitude toward the students.
While one set of professors argues for a
core reading list with some modifications
and another set contends that the core
list should be eradicated, the main prem
ise underlying arguments on both sides
is never discussed: should there be a
Western Culture requirement at all? On
a grander scale, should there be any dis
tribution requirements at all?
Imagine, if you will, entering your
freshman dorm room on your first day
and discovering a list on your desk. That
list, entitled "Regulations on the Farm,"
includes the following:
• All freshman must be in bed with the
lights out no later than 11 p.m., midnight
on weekends.
• All students will complete at least four
hours of studying per day.
• Dress for morning classes shall be semi
formal.
Stanford, of course, does not have these

social regulations, precisely because the
University believes that the people it ad
mits are fully competent and mature
enough to sleep, eat, clothe and study
without supervision. Through the Honor
Code, the administration evinces its trust
and respect for students' moral integrity.
Nevertheless, Stanford in its most im
portant relationship with the student
body — the educational relationship —
does not trust the competency, maturity
and integrity of its students to decide for
themselves what education will best suit
their needs. By establishing distribution
requirements and a core reading list, the
administration is telling students: Al
though we consider you wise and mature
enough to monitor your personal life
without our help, we will treat you as
mental minors in the selection of your
Stanford education.
If the administration or faculty does
not have the confidence that Stanford
students, with proper counseling, can
properly select their own educational
paths, then that lack of confidence leads
to three possible conclusions:
• Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter and the admissions commit
tee are selecting an intellectually imma
ture lot of people from the over 15,000
applications they receive each year.
• Stanford's academic counseling mech
anisms (faculty and student advisers) are
not sufficiently resourceful, competent or
interested to oversee the individualized
tailoring of a student's course load.
• The University's lack of confidence is
not justified since the students are ma
ture enough to make their own educa
tional decisions, and the counseling re
sources are in place to advise students

properly.
My proposal to rectify the current sit
uation is simple but will require a minor
revolution in attitudes for its implemen
tation:
• All distribution requirements will be
dropped. Students will be free to take
whatever classes they desire. Advanced
course can still require students to have
the proper prerequisites for enrollment.
• Departments will specify, as before,
what courses are needed to receive a
degree from that department.
• Academic advising will be improved.
• The required core list in Western Cul
ture will be abolished.
The most surprising aspect of this pro
posal is that the student body has not
already made it an important issue on
campus. Stanford undergrads have pas
sively accepted the University's intellec
tually disparaging attitude toward them
on the subject of their ability to choose
an educational program while they have
actively demanded that their views be
heard on matters like Stanford divest
ment, the Reagan Library and alcohol
consumption during fraternity Rush. It
is time for Stanford students to stop
depending on others to make their edu
cational decisions.
