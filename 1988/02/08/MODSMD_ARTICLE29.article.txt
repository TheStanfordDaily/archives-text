## Yoga exercises the mind, body 
### Rozanna Fiore 
While Stanford students are
jumping about in aerobics and jog
ging to exhaustion, Ragu Rag
hunath, an accountant at Stan
ford, meditates for a healthy body
— and a healthy mind.
"Sixty percent of all ailments
are caused by the mind," ex
plained Raghunath, a yoga in
structer who offers free medita
tion classes to Stanford students.
When stricken with a serious
illness at the age of 15 that forced
him to leave a reputable military
school in India, Raghunath
returned to his Indian village and
met a meditation instructor who
changed his life.
By studying with the instructor,
Raghunath said he learned the
art of yoga which helped heal him.
"(Learning yoga) was a turning
point in my life," Raghunath said.
"From then on I never had any
diseases."
Once he regained his health,
Ragunath left his Indian village
to resume his studies and later
received a master's degree in ac
counting. He came to Stanford
three years ago to work for the
accounts payable office in Encina
Hall.
"I have a body, but I am not
my body ... I am a center of
pure consciousness," are some
concepts that Raghunath urges
his students to concentrate on
during class.
According to Raghunath, the
mind is like a "wild horse" that
is difficult to control, but once his
students gain control of their
minds, they have mastered their

bodies as well. "Mind is greater
than body," he said.
If students seriously devote
themselves to yoga they can ex
pect greater confidence and
stamina, reduced stress and a
slower aging process, according to
Raghunath.
He warns that although these
benefits sound appealing, stu
dents should consider the time
commitment before they take the
yoga-robic plunge.
"It takes practice," Raghunath
explained.
Josey Samson, a chemical en
gineer and student of Ragunath,
spends up to one hour a day doing
yoga exercises and meditating.
"Anyone can benefit from
yoga," Samson said. "It is just a
relaxation technique that involves
diet, health and the whole human
being."
"The purpose of life is to realize
your own self," Raghunath said.
"We must each see that we all
have the essence of God within
us."
According to Raghunath,
proper meditation can expand
people's mental capacity, allowing
them to know"the present, past
and future."
There are 5,000 standard yoga
exercises. But 40 are considered
the "core exercises," he said.
Doing any of the 40 exercises
for 10 minutes a day, in the morn
ing and at noon, will improve
health, Raghunath explained.
"You can really feel a change,"
he said.
Raghunath is a member of
Ananda Marga, an international
yoga and meditation group that

sponsors several social service
projects throughout the world.
Each unit bases its philosophy
on the words of Shrii Shrii Anan
damurti, the guru who estab
lished the Ananda Marga in 1955.
Anandamurti "teaches a com
prehensive philosophy. It com
bines both the social and spiritual
way of life. He has not come just
for India, but for the whole
world," Raghunath explained.
Yoga is not a religion, but an
intuitional science, according to
Raghunath.
People do not need to subscribe
to Raghunath's philosophy to
practice yoga, he said. "Through
yoga all you are doing is just re
alizing your own spirituality."

Samson, a Christian, said he
sees no conflict between his reli
gion and meditation and stressed
that yoga is not a religious prac
tice.
Raghunath teaches his art to
Stanford students in yoga classes
held every Friday evening at Tres
idder Union.
According to Raghunath, he
does not charge for his yoga
classes because they are enjoyable
for both him and the students.
The classes "are my blood life,"
he said. "I want to help fellow
human beings."
When asked why people should
should pursue yoga, Raghunath
responded, "Why breathe?"

According to Raghunath, the
mind is like a "wild horse" that
is difficult to control, but once his
students gain control of their
minds, they have mastered their

bodies as well. "Mind is greater
than body," he said.
If students seriously devote
themselves to yoga they can ex
pect greater confidence and
stamina, reduced stress and a
slower aging process, according to
Raghunath.
He warns that although these
benefits sound appealing, stu
dents should consider the time
commitment before they take the
yoga-robic plunge.
"It takes practice," Raghunath
explained.
Josey Samson, a chemical en
gineer and student of Ragunath,
spends up to one hour a day doing
yoga exercises and meditating.
"Anyone can benefit from
yoga," Samson said. "It is just a
relaxation technique that involves
diet, health and the whole human
being."
"The purpose of life is to realize
your own self," Raghunath said.
"We must each see that we all
have the essence of God within
us."
According to Raghunath,
proper meditation can expand
people's mental capacity, allowing
them to know"the present, past
and future."
There are 5,000 standard yoga
exercises. But 40 are considered
the "core exercises," he said.
Doing any of the 40 exercises
for 10 minutes a day, in the morn
ing and at noon, will improve
health, Raghunath explained.
"You can really feel a change,"
he said.
Raghunath is a member of
Ananda Marga, an international
yoga and meditation group that

sponsors several social service
projects throughout the world.
Each unit bases its philosophy
on the words of Shrii Shrii Anan
damurti, the guru who estab
lished the Ananda Marga in 1955.
Anandamurti "teaches a com
prehensive philosophy. It com
bines both the social and spiritual
way of life. He has not come just
for India, but for the whole
world," Raghunath explained.
Yoga is not a religion, but an
intuitional science, according to
Raghunath.
People do not need to subscribe
to Raghunath's philosophy to
practice yoga, he said. "Through
yoga all you are doing is just re
alizing your own spirituality."

Samson, a Christian, said he
sees no conflict between his reli
gion and meditation and stressed
that yoga is not a religious prac
tice.
Raghunath teaches his art to
Stanford students in yoga classes
held every Friday evening at Tres
idder Union.
According to Raghunath, he
does not charge for his yoga
classes because they are enjoyable
for both him and the students.
The classes "are my blood life,"
he said. "I want to help fellow
human beings."
When asked why people should
should pursue yoga, Raghunath
responded, "Why breathe?"
