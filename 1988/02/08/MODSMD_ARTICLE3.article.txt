# Area One discussion focuses on core list
## 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy's
request that the Faculty Senate seek advice
from those who teach "in the trenches" of
the Western Culture Program has spawned
sharply different appraisals of the current
program's effectiveness, leading to confu
sion over the relative merits of the proposal
to overhaul the Area One requirement.

News analysis

Some faculty members have reported
that students are enthusiastic about the
program and regularly discuss common
readings in their free time. Others have
said program instructors are overly
restricted by the required core list and that
students rarely discuss their thoughts out
side the classroom.
As debate over whether to replace the
current program with a new course wears
on, the attitudes of students and faculty
with daily hands-on experience has become
the subject of much speculation and some
attempts at scientific study.
The two questions that have become
most central to recent debates over activity
"in the trenches" are: To what extent do
students discuss core list readings — texts
required in all tracks — outside of class?
To what extent does the core list inhibit
creativity among professors in designing
courses that are intellectually coherent?
The final vote on the proposed new
course, which will require study of non-
Western cultures and of more works by
women and minority writers, hinges in part
on the senate's answers to these questions.
If debaters can be shown that students
discuss the works outside class and that
Western Culture discussion leaders do not
feel constrained by the core, then the pro
posal, which abolishes the core, is more
likely to fail. If, on the other hand, it can
be shown that students do not discuss the

works and that faculty are constrained,
then the proposed course, "Cultures, Ideas
and Values," will more likely be approved.
The answers to the questions may prove
particularly influential in shaping the
opinions of many of the science, engineer
ing and professional school faculty, who
form a significant majority in the senate.
Apparently for this reason, much of last
week's senate meeting was devoted to ex
positions on activity in Western Culture's
"trenches."
VTSS Lecturer Barry Katz, an outspoken
supporter of the proposal, told the senate
that an incomplete survey he is conducting
of Western Culture discussion leaders in
dicates that they favor the CIV proposal
over an alternative, more conservative pro
posal by a margin of three to one. He said
the preliminary result is based on inter
views with slightly less than 60 percent of
the 41 lecturers.
"What this means is, that if it comes
down to core list or no core list, some of
the lecturers will find it conducive to their
classes and some will find it a detriment,"
Katz said last night. "But these people
realize that if we do away with the core
list, those who like it will be able to keep
it."
Katz downplayed the effect that his study
is likely to have on faculty members who
have already made up their minds on how
they will vote, but said that the section
leaders are the source of an important
point of view that should not be overlooked
in the debate.
"We are the only people who know what
it's like to have a core of angry minority
students sitting there with us in class," he
said.
English Profs. William Chace and Ronald
Rebholz, however, presented a radically dif
ferent picture of daily life in Western Cul
ture. They expressed support for the more
conservative proposal, arguing that stu
dents regularly discuss core-list books out-
side of class and that the curric
ulum is enhanced, not inhibited,
by the core.
This proposal, introduced by
Chace last month, calls for retain
ing the core list but adding works
by women and minority authors.
Remembering Kennedy's sug
gestion at the Jan. 21 senate
meeting, Rebholz said he asked a
group of Trancos freshmen
recently whether they ever dis
cussed core-list books outside
class. "The answer was a unani
mous and enthusiastic 'yes,' "
Rebholz said. "They took special
delight in debating the interpre
tation of works from the different
perspectives garnered from their
various tracks, and they criticized
each other's essays from those dif
fering perspectives.

"Having been a resident fellow
in Trancos from 1981 to 1984, I
would judge that there isn't any
thing unusual about these
students," he continued. "I sub
mit that we do not want to jeopar
dize that kind of intellectual ex
change (by abolishing the core
list)."
Chace challenged the position
that the core stands in the way
of intellectual creativity. Works
by women and minorities are al
ready taught in every track, he
said. "They are not artificially
grafted on," he added. "They are
there, organically part of the syl
labi. This kind of spinal stability
(the core) and flexibility (works
chosen by individual instructors)
represents the best kind of cur
ricular planning."
Those opposed to the CIV pro
posal have on their side the
results of two recent student sur

veys. One, which polled freshman
last spring, showed that 69 per
cent of respondents said they
received a "useful understanding
of the development of Western
culture" from the current require
ment. Slightly over of the respon
dents said they were glad they
had been required to take the
three-quarter sequence.
Results of the 1987 senior sur
vey also support those opposed to
the proposal. More than 60 per
cent of respondents said their
Western Culture track had made
a "great" or "very great" contri
bution to their knowledge and
skill level — by far the most fa
vorable response to an academic
requirement.
Among faculty in favor of
adopting CIV, which would re
quire the study of non-Western
cultures and works by minorities
and women, History Prof. Judith
Brown and Anthropology Prof.

Jane Collier said student attitudes
toward Western Culture support
the proposal.
Brown, speaking at Thursday's
senate meeting, said students'
course evaluations have shown
that only 7 percent answered
"yes" to the question: "Did you
talk with students in other tracks
about the ideas encountered in
the courses?" In contrast, Brown
said, 47 percent said they had
"never" or "almost never" dis
cussed ideas from their classes
with students in other tracks.
In addition to failing to produce
"common intellectual experience"
among freshman, Brown said, the
core list also stifles faculty
creativity. In the CIV program,
she said, "the reason for choosing
[particular] works will come from
the unfettered and creative explo
ration of ideas and from the inner
intellectual coherence of particu
lar courses."

Results of the 1987 senior sur
vey also support those opposed to
the proposal. More than 60 per
cent of respondents said their
Western Culture track had made
a "great" or "very great" contri
bution to their knowledge and
skill level — by far the most fa
vorable response to an academic
requirement.
Among faculty in favor of
adopting CIV, which would re
quire the study of non-Western
cultures and works by minorities
and women, History Prof. Judith
Brown and Anthropology Prof.

Jane Collier said student attitudes
toward Western Culture support
the proposal.
Brown, speaking at Thursday's
senate meeting, said students'
course evaluations have shown
that only 7 percent answered
"yes" to the question: "Did you
talk with students in other tracks
about the ideas encountered in
the courses?" In contrast, Brown
said, 47 percent said they had
"never" or "almost never" dis
cussed ideas from their classes
with students in other tracks.
In addition to failing to produce
"common intellectual experience"
among freshman, Brown said, the
core list also stifles faculty
creativity. In the CIV program,
she said, "the reason for choosing
[particular] works will come from
the unfettered and creative explo
ration of ideas and from the inner
intellectual coherence of particu
lar courses."
University President Donald Kennedy's
request that the Faculty Senate seek advice
from those who teach "in the trenches" of
the Western Culture Program has spawned
sharply different appraisals of the current
program's effectiveness, leading to confu
sion over the relative merits of the proposal
to overhaul the Area One requirement.

News analysis

Some faculty members have reported
that students are enthusiastic about the
program and regularly discuss common
readings in their free time. Others have
said program instructors are overly
restricted by the required core list and that
students rarely discuss their thoughts out
side the classroom.
As debate over whether to replace the
current program with a new course wears
on, the attitudes of students and faculty
with daily hands-on experience has become
the subject of much speculation and some
attempts at scientific study.
The two questions that have become
most central to recent debates over activity
"in the trenches" are: To what extent do
students discuss core list readings — texts
required in all tracks — outside of class?
To what extent does the core list inhibit
creativity among professors in designing
courses that are intellectually coherent?
The final vote on the proposed new
course, which will require study of non-
Western cultures and of more works by
women and minority writers, hinges in part
on the senate's answers to these questions.
If debaters can be shown that students
discuss the works outside class and that
Western Culture discussion leaders do not
feel constrained by the core, then the pro
posal, which abolishes the core, is more
likely to fail. If, on the other hand, it can
be shown that students do not discuss the

works and that faculty are constrained,
then the proposed course, "Cultures, Ideas
and Values," will more likely be approved.
The answers to the questions may prove
particularly influential in shaping the
opinions of many of the science, engineer
ing and professional school faculty, who
form a significant majority in the senate.
Apparently for this reason, much of last
week's senate meeting was devoted to ex
positions on activity in Western Culture's
"trenches."
VTSS Lecturer Barry Katz, an outspoken
supporter of the proposal, told the senate
that an incomplete survey he is conducting
of Western Culture discussion leaders in
dicates that they favor the CIV proposal
over an alternative, more conservative pro
posal by a margin of three to one. He said
the preliminary result is based on inter
views with slightly less than 60 percent of
the 41 lecturers.
"What this means is, that if it comes
down to core list or no core list, some of
the lecturers will find it conducive to their
classes and some will find it a detriment,"
Katz said last night. "But these people
realize that if we do away with the core
list, those who like it will be able to keep
it."
Katz downplayed the effect that his study
is likely to have on faculty members who
have already made up their minds on how
they will vote, but said that the section
leaders are the source of an important
point of view that should not be overlooked
in the debate.
"We are the only people who know what
it's like to have a core of angry minority
students sitting there with us in class," he
said.
English Profs. William Chace and Ronald
Rebholz, however, presented a radically dif
ferent picture of daily life in Western Cul
ture. They expressed support for the more
conservative proposal, arguing that stu
dents regularly discuss core-list books out-
side of class and that the curric
ulum is enhanced, not inhibited,
by the core.
This proposal, introduced by
Chace last month, calls for retain
ing the core list but adding works
by women and minority authors.
Remembering Kennedy's sug
gestion at the Jan. 21 senate
meeting, Rebholz said he asked a
group of Trancos freshmen
recently whether they ever dis
cussed core-list books outside
class. "The answer was a unani
mous and enthusiastic 'yes,' "
Rebholz said. "They took special
delight in debating the interpre
tation of works from the different
perspectives garnered from their
various tracks, and they criticized
each other's essays from those dif
fering perspectives.

"Having been a resident fellow
in Trancos from 1981 to 1984, I
would judge that there isn't any
thing unusual about these
students," he continued. "I sub
mit that we do not want to jeopar
dize that kind of intellectual ex
change (by abolishing the core
list)."
Chace challenged the position
that the core stands in the way
of intellectual creativity. Works
by women and minorities are al
ready taught in every track, he
said. "They are not artificially
grafted on," he added. "They are
there, organically part of the syl
labi. This kind of spinal stability
(the core) and flexibility (works
chosen by individual instructors)
represents the best kind of cur
ricular planning."
Those opposed to the CIV pro
posal have on their side the
results of two recent student sur

veys. One, which polled freshman
last spring, showed that 69 per
cent of respondents said they
received a "useful understanding
of the development of Western
culture" from the current require
ment. Slightly over of the respon
dents said they were glad they
had been required to take the
three-quarter sequence.
