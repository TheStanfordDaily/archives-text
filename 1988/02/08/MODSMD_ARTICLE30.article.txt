## Cardinal cagers crush Arizona State 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
All thoughts of a
letdown were
flushed down the
toilet Saturday af
ternoon when the
Stanford men's
basketball team

swamped the Arizona State Sun
Devils 96-63 in front of a Maples
Pavilion crowd of 6,516.
The Cardinal followed one of
its biggest victories in history,
Thursday night's win over No. 1
Arizona, with one of its most lop
sided triumphs in conference his
tory. The winning margin was the
largest since Stanford trounced
Washington State 84-48 during
the 1963-64 season.

Indeed, instead of a struggle to
come down to earth after the
Wildcat upset, Saturday's game
ended up as a festival featuring
all 15 Cardinal players and the
most Maples dunks in recent
memory.
Stanford reserves Scott Meinert
and Derek Bruton sparked a 10-2
run late in the first half which
turned a 28-21 Cardinal lead into
a 38-23 rout, and Howard Wright
scored 20 points in only 20
minutes for the victors.
The win earned Stanford sole
possession of second place in the
Pacific 10 Conference. The Car
dinal stands at 15-7 overall, 7-4
in the conference. Arizona State
fell to 13-8, 6-5.

"Obviously we were elated on
Friday, but we just buckled down
in practice," Wright said after
ward. "We wanted to establish
ourselves in the Pac-10."
What the Stanford players
didn't want was a repeat of the
turnover-plagued 104-80 loss to
the Sun Devils in Tempe last
month. But when Arizona State
jumped out to a 6-0 lead after
three Cardinal miscues, deja vu
was creeping in.
"I knew everyone in the stands
and everyone watching (on tele
vision) was wondering whether we
were just going to roll over," said
Stanford guard Todd Lichti, who
had 14 points. "But we kept at it
and came back."
Finally, at the 17:20 mark, Car
dinal center Greg Butler snared
an offensive rebound and laid it
back in for the first Stanford score
of the contest. After the ice was
broken, the Sun Devils fell in.
The Arizona State gunners shot
only 11 for-32 from the field in
the first half, while Stanford shot
a blistering 20-for-31.
"They were still living off the
upset (over Arizona)," ASU guard
Arthur Thomas said. "Hey, they
beat No. 1 and they got some
confidence from that. If they keep
playing like that they can go a
long way."
Probably the most bizarre and
enjoyable part of the game was
seeing the 6-foot-10, 240-pound
Bruton lumber all the way down
the court to fill the lane on several
Cardinal fast breaks. The sopho
more crowd favorite scored a
career-high 14 points.
"I knew it was a big game and
didn't want it to be the Stanford
of the past — win one night and
then lose the next," Bruton said.
"We don't like to lose here."
Not only did Stanford not lose,
the Cardinal also didn't lose a
step when the reserves took over
the court. With 10 minutes left
in the game and the score 72-45,
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery went to the lineup of
freshman Deshon Wingate, soph
omores Bruton, Oliver Cunning



Matt Bateman — Dally
Junior reserve center Derek Bruton jumped into the limelight Saturday by scoring
a career-high 14 points in just 12 minutes to secure the Stanford win.
