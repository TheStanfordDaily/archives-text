# Stanford swimming settles for second
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Sometimes good is just
not good enough.
The Stanford women's
swimming team swam its
fastest times of the year
Saturday, but even that
wasn't enough to beat

the top-ranked Texas Longhorns, the
four-time defending national champions.
In front of about 1,600 people at
deGuerre Pool, the Cardinal had 27
season-best efforts but seemed just a
hair slow time after time in falling to
the 8-0 Longhorns by a 90-50 score.
Stanford is now 5-1.

"We swam fast," junior Aimee Berzins
said. "Everyone swam faster than they
had last meet. It was hard (losing so
many close races), but we just kept
thinking 'we are improving still.' "
Stanford Coach George Haines agreed
with Berzins' analysis. "He (Texas
Coach Richard Quick) loves to go fast
early (in the season)," Haines explained.
"I know we're going to get a lot better.
The girls know we're going to get a lot
better."
The brightest spot for the Cardinal
was the swimming of junior Jenna
Johnson. Johnson won all three individ
ual events she entered, coming in under

the NCAA qualifying times in
each and setting two deGuerre
Pool records in the process.
Johnson began in the 50-yard
freestyle, posting a time of 23.39
seconds, breaking by .11 seconds
the record of current Texas assis
tant coach Jill Sterkel. Her next
event was the 100 free, in which
she beat Texas sophomore Carrie
Steinseifer — the 1984 Olympic
gold medalist in that event.
Johnson also won in the 100
butterfly, dominating from start
to finish. She swam a 54.12, .02
seconds faster than the old pool
record, and was more than two
seconds ahead of her closest com
petitor, senior teammate Susan
Rapp.
The fact that it was going to
be a fast meet was established in
the first event, the 400 medley
relay. Cardinal senior Jen Pok
luda opened by posting an NCAA

qualifying time on the backstroke
leg, but it was not fast enough.
The Longhorns' had senior Betsy
Mitchell swimming their opening
leg and she blazed to a new pool
record.
The other Longhorns continued
where Mitchell led off, winning
the event easily. Things didn't get
much better for Stanford as the
day went on, either.
Mitchell's new pool record in
the 100 back only lasted about 20
minutes, as the Texas senior re
broke it to win that event. She
also won the 200 back, making
her one of three Longhorn double
winners, along with Tracey
McFarlane (100 and 200 breast
stroke) and Kelley Davies (200 fly
and 400 individual medley).
The Cardinal won only four
events, with sophomore Katie
Connors' win in the one-meter
diving complementing Johnson's
triple.
Haines feels his team's empha
sis on long-term training has af
fected its short-term speed. "I

think we've been training harder
through the last two or three
meets than they have," he said.
"They're still the team to beat,
there's no doubt about that . . .
(but) we've got some improve
ments to make; we're right on
schedule."
The meet was very competitive
in every event — despite the lop
sided score — as several Cardinal
swimmers were scant hundredths
of a second slow. A great example
of this was the 500 free, where
senior Stacy Shupe swam for al
most five minutes to lose to An
nabelle Cripps by .20 second.
Shupe also scored a second in the
1000 free.
In other events, junior Michelle
Donahue took second in both
backstroke races and the 400 free
relay team of Johnson, freshman
Jody Smith, Rapp and Berzins
was edged by nine-hundredths of
a second.
"All we want to do is keep get
ting better every week," Haines
said. "I'm optimistic about that."

The brightest spot for the Cardinal
was the swimming of junior Jenna
Johnson. Johnson won all three individ
ual events she entered, coming in under

the NCAA qualifying times in
each and setting two deGuerre
Pool records in the process.
Johnson began in the 50-yard
freestyle, posting a time of 23.39
seconds, breaking by .11 seconds
the record of current Texas assis
tant coach Jill Sterkel. Her next
event was the 100 free, in which
she beat Texas sophomore Carrie
Steinseifer — the 1984 Olympic
gold medalist in that event.
Johnson also won in the 100
butterfly, dominating from start
to finish. She swam a 54.12, .02
seconds faster than the old pool
record, and was more than two
seconds ahead of her closest com
petitor, senior teammate Susan
Rapp.
The fact that it was going to
be a fast meet was established in
the first event, the 400 medley
relay. Cardinal senior Jen Pok
luda opened by posting an NCAA

qualifying time on the backstroke
leg, but it was not fast enough.
The Longhorns' had senior Betsy
Mitchell swimming their opening
leg and she blazed to a new pool
record.
The other Longhorns continued
where Mitchell led off, winning
the event easily. Things didn't get
much better for Stanford as the
day went on, either.
Mitchell's new pool record in
the 100 back only lasted about 20
minutes, as the Texas senior re
broke it to win that event. She
also won the 200 back, making
her one of three Longhorn double
winners, along with Tracey
McFarlane (100 and 200 breast
stroke) and Kelley Davies (200 fly
and 400 individual medley).
The Cardinal won only four
events, with sophomore Katie
Connors' win in the one-meter
diving complementing Johnson's
triple.
Haines feels his team's empha
sis on long-term training has af
fected its short-term speed. "I

think we've been training harder
through the last two or three
meets than they have," he said.
"They're still the team to beat,
there's no doubt about that . . .
(but) we've got some improve
ments to make; we're right on
schedule."
The meet was very competitive
in every event — despite the lop
sided score — as several Cardinal
swimmers were scant hundredths
of a second slow. A great example
of this was the 500 free, where
senior Stacy Shupe swam for al
most five minutes to lose to An
nabelle Cripps by .20 second.
Shupe also scored a second in the
1000 free.
In other events, junior Michelle
Donahue took second in both
backstroke races and the 400 free
relay team of Johnson, freshman
Jody Smith, Rapp and Berzins
was edged by nine-hundredths of
a second.
"All we want to do is keep get
ting better every week," Haines
said. "I'm optimistic about that."
