# Bruton at his best
## 
### Erik Sten Senior Staff writer 
Perhaps to the uninitiated it sounded like a chorus
of boos.
Why in the world, they wondered, as the Cardinal
rolled to a convincing win over Arizona State, would
the crowd be booing?
A fair, but mistaken question it was, for late in
the first half and again in the second, the sound
that reverberated through Maples wasn't "boo." No,
the sound was "Bru." (Wave your hands in the air
and pronounce it "Broooo .. .")
"Bru" is short for Bruton, as in Derek Bruton,
Stanford's 6-foot-ll reserve center who played the
best game of his collegiate career on Saturday and
brought the 6,500 fans at Maples to their feet.
For most of the season, the Cardinal fans have
had a love affair with Bruton. Whenever "Bru"
enters the game the familiar cheer goes up. Hands
can be heard slapping whenever he scores. But on
Saturday, Bru gave the crowd something special to
remember.
With a season- and career-high of nine points,
Bru came into Saturday's contest averaging three
points and nine minutes of playing time a game.
Against the Sun Devils, the redshirt sophomore
exploded for 14 points in 12 minutes on seven-for
eight shooting from the field. But even those im
pressive numbers don't tell the story.
What brought the crowd alive on Saturday was
Bruton's hustle. The big man ran the fast-break
like a guard, went to the floor for loose balls and
battled for rebounds inside. It was the kind of
performance you can't help but like.
"It was by far the most fun I've had so far,"
Bruton said. "I haven't seen double figures in
minutes, let alone points. I loved it."
Coming in with the Cardinal up by nine late in
the first half, Bruton scored eight points in the last
5:45 of the first half to spark a Cardinal run that
left Stanford comfortably up by 18, 49-31, at
halftime.
At 5:45, he threw down the patented Bruton
dunk off a pass from guard Scott Meinert. At 4:39,
it was a lay-in off a missed shot. Just 20 seconds
later, another bucket off a Meinert fast-break feed.
And at 2:25 he finished off the half with a tip-in.
Afterward, surrounded by reporters, Bruton
couldn't deny that he had indeed been watching
that afternoon's NBA Slam Dunk Contest. "I was
watching it, but I wasn't thinking about it. But,"
he continued, smiling, "maybe subconsciously .. ."
All in all, it was something any Stanford fan had
to love. "It's kind of different. It's not a natural
sight," Meinert said. "It's effective though. If he
can get up and down the court,
no one's going to take a charge."
Contrary to post-game
rumours, a joking Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said, "No,

we're not going to change our of
fense to get Bruton out on the
wing on the break."
Although he doesn't expect his
centers on the break too often,
the coach did like Bruton's style.
"Arizona State committed their
big men to the offenseive boards,
and he got out on some breaks.
He just hustled his big ol' body

down the floor. That's not some
thing you see too often," he said.
For Bruton's part, the game
was, more than anything else, a
confidence builder. "Every point
you score, every rebound you get,
you feel a lot more confident. I
have to establish that every time
I get the ball I'm going to score,"
he said.
