Stanford showed a lot of
depth but came away
with nary a title this
weekend at the men's
and women's Rolex Na
tional Indoor Intercol
legiate Tennis Cham-

pionships in Minneapolis.
On the men's side, senior Patrick
McEnroe and sophomore Jeff Tarango
reached the semifinals in singles and
as a team also made it to the semifinals
in doubles.
Eleni Rossides was the standout for
the Cardinal women. The unseeded
junior advanced to yesterday's final
before losing to unseeded freshman
Halle Cioffi of Florida 6-3, 6-2. Cioffi

had previously beaten Tami Whitlinger,
the third seed from Stanford, in a quar
terfinal match.
After beating teammate Curtis Dunn
4-6, 7-5, 6-1 in Friday's second round,
McEnroe easily upset top-seeded Scott
Melville of USC later in the day 6-2, 6-4.
In Saturday's semifinal match,
fourth-seeded Shelby Cannon of Ten
nessee topped McEnroe 6-4, 6-4.
Rebounding from three straight dual
match losses, Tarango topped SMU's
Tim Trigueiro 6-4, 7-6 in the second
round and upset Olivier Lorin, the No.
8 seed from Oklahoma, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 in
the quarterfinals.
Second-seeded Andrew Sznajder of
Pepperdine, the eventual champion,
ended Tarango's title hopes Saturday,
6-1, 6-4. "I thought I was in with him
close in the second set, and if I had
won a couple more key points I might

have pulled it out," Tarango said.
"I think he (Sznjyder) was the best
player in the tournament as of [Satur
day]."
After beating the fourth-seeded team
of Vince Van Gelderen and Kent Kin
near of Clemson in Thursday's opening
round, McEnroe and Tarango, who were
not seeded, defeated SMU's Alex Nizet
and Trigueiro 6-7, 6-1, 6-4 Saturday in
the quarterfinals.
Later in the day, however, the Stan
ford pair was bested by Melville and
Eric Amend of USC, 6-3, 6-4.
Stanford freshman David Wheaton,
who was a finalist this past fall in the
Volvo/ITCA All-America Champion
ships, was unable to compete this
weekend because of an injured left

wrist. He would have been the
No. 3 seed.
"We now have three players
(McEnroe, Tarango and Wheaton)
that have reached the semis at
the two major preseason tourna
ments (the Volvo and the Rolex),"
Stanford men's Coach Dick Gould
said. "All three of those guys are
capable of winning the NCAA in
dividual championships."
With preseason tournament vic
tories already to their name, Ros
sides and Whitlinger have also
proven they are capable of win
ning this spring's NCAA singles
title. But this weekend they ran
into a road block in the person
of Cioffi.
Both Rossides and Whitlinger
were winning easily until they

met the Florida freshman. Ros
sides advanced to the finals via
straight-set victories Friday over
USC's Stephanie London and
Pepperdine's Ginger Helgeson,
and Saturday against fifth-seeded
Sonia Hahn of Kentucky. Ros
sides routed Hahn, the tour
nament's defending champion, 6-
2, 6-4 in the semifinal round.
Whitlinger defeated Kelli Mul
vihill of Indiana 6-2, 6-1 Friday
in the second round before losing
in the quarterfinals to Cioffi 7-5,
6-3.
Like the Cardinal men, the
Stanford women were minus a
player who had been invited to
the tournament. Sophomore Lisa
Green was scheduled to play at
the Rolex tournament this
weekend but had to withdraw
when Stanford women's Coach
Frank Brennan needed her to play
in dual matches last Wednesday
and Thursday.
