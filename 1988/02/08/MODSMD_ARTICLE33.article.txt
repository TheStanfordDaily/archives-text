Stanford showed a lot of
depth but came away
with nary a title this
weekend at the men's
and women's Rolex Na
tional Indoor Intercol
legiate Tennis Cham-

pionships in Minneapolis.
On the men's side, senior Patrick
McEnroe and sophomore Jeff Tarango
reached the semifinals in singles and
as a team also made it to the semifinals
in doubles.
Eleni Rossides was the standout for
the Cardinal women. The unseeded
junior advanced to yesterday's final
before losing to unseeded freshman
Halle Cioffi of Florida 6-3, 6-2. Cioffi

had previously beaten Tami Whitlinger,
the third seed from Stanford, in a quar
terfinal match.
After beating teammate Curtis Dunn
4-6, 7-5, 6-1 in Friday's second round,
McEnroe easily upset top-seeded Scott
Melville of USC later in the day 6-2, 6-4.
In Saturday's semifinal match,
fourth-seeded Shelby Cannon of Ten
nessee topped McEnroe 6-4, 6-4.
Rebounding from three straight dual
match losses, Tarango topped SMU's
Tim Trigueiro 6-4, 7-6 in the second
round and upset Olivier Lorin, the No.
8 seed from Oklahoma, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 in
the quarterfinals.
Second-seeded Andrew Sznajder of
Pepperdine, the eventual champion,
ended Tarango's title hopes Saturday,
6-1, 6-4. "I thought I was in with him
close in the second set, and if I had
won a couple more key points I might

have pulled it out," Tarango said.
"I think he (Sznjyder) was the best
player in the tournament as of [Satur
day]."
After beating the fourth-seeded team
of Vince Van Gelderen and Kent Kin
near of Clemson in Thursday's opening
round, McEnroe and Tarango, who were
not seeded, defeated SMU's Alex Nizet
and Trigueiro 6-7, 6-1, 6-4 Saturday in
the quarterfinals.
Later in the day, however, the Stan
ford pair was bested by Melville and
Eric Amend of USC, 6-3, 6-4.
Stanford freshman David Wheaton,
who was a finalist this past fall in the
Volvo/ITCA All-America Champion
ships, was unable to compete this
weekend because of an injured left
