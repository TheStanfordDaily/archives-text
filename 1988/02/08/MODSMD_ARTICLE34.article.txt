# Card loses 2 in clash with Titans
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The Stanford base
ball team yester
day showed some
of the come-from
behind spark that
typified last year's
national champi-

onship squad. But all of the Car
dinal's rallies fell short and
Fullerton State prevailed 6-5 on
the strength of two home runs
and several eye-popping defensive
plays, handing the Cardinal its
first series loss at home since last
February.
The Titans won Friday's series
opener, 5-1, while the Cardinal
took Saturday's game, 9-4. With
the two losses and a win, Stan
ford, ranked No. 2 nationally in
both mi\jor preseason polls, goes
to 3-3 on the year. The Cardinal
plays next at 3 p.m. tomorrow at
the University of the Pacific in
Stockton.
Yesterday's game looked like a
rout through six innings: Going
into the seventh, Fullerton State
led 5-1, and Titan starter Mark
Beck had allowed only two hits
and had retired 16 Stanford bat
ters in a row. But Beck crumbled
in the seventh, surrenduring
singles to Jeff Saenger and Doug
Robbins and walking Brian
Johnson to load the bases with
no outs.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
inserted Eric DeGraw as a pinch

runner for Johnson. That turned
out to be a key move. When Troy
Paulsen hit a hard grounder to
third base, Titan third baseman
Ralph Ramirez had no choice but
to try to force the runner at
second. But DeGraw beat the
throw to the bag. One run was
in and the bases were still loaded
with no outs.
Beck then walked Mike Eicher
to make the score 5-3. Bases still
loaded, no outs. The game really
turned on the next play. With
Danny DeVille on in relief of Beck,
Frank Carey lashed a shot to
second. Second baseman Mike
Ross flipped to shortstop Ralph
Ramirez, who went back to first
to complete the double play.
But Carey appeared to beat the
throw to the bag. "I think he was
safe," Titan first baseman Rex
Peters said after the game. "It
was really close, but he was safe."
Although another run crossed the
plate on the play to make the
score 5-4, the questionable double
play effectively killed the rally.
The Titans tallied again in the
eighth to make it 6-4, and the
Cardinal answered in the eighth
to pull within one again and set
up a final Stanford rally. With
one out in the bottom of the
ninth, Eicher again drew a walk,
and Albert Richardson came on
as a pinch-runner.
Frank Carey flew out, then Ron
Witmeyer launched a slicing shot
toward the right-field corner.
With two outs, Richardson,

representing the tying run, was
oft at the crack of the bat, and
would have scored easily if the
ball had dropped. But right fielder
Jason Rolish hauled in Wit
meyer's blast on a dead run at
the warning track to end the
game.
"We were close to winning three
games this weekend," Plemel said.
"I think in the seventh, we woke
up and finally started to battle.
But we're going to have to start
battling for nine innings . . . when
we get to the point where we're
battling for nine innings, then
we'll start winning series."
The Titans built their lead on
the strength of two home runs —
a two-run shot in the first by
Ross and a solo homer by desig
nated hitter Shane Flores leading
off the sixth. Flores' homer barely
got over the left-field fence. "I
thought there was no way that
was out," Plemel said. "The ball
was just carrying real well for
them today."
On Saturday it was the Cardi
nal batters who were getting good
carry on the ball. Stanford took
advantage of all kinds of Titan
generosity — a wild pitch, three
errors and a bad fielder's choice
— to build a 5-1 lead after four.
Then senior designated hitter
Jeff Saenger, oh-for-the-season up
to that point, broke the game open
with a two-run home run to right
center.
"I didn't really expect that one
to go out," Saenger said. "I ex

pected it to go up the middle . . .
but it was nice to get a hit, and
it was nice for the first one to be
a home run."
Two innings later, Ed Sprague
bounced a two-run homer off the
scoreboard — his second home
run of the year — to make the
score 9-3.
That was more than enough
lead for freshman Mike Mussina,
who improved his record to 1-1
with a nifty complete-game nine
hitter in his Sunken Diamond
debut. Mussina began in rocky
fashion, giving up two doubles in
the first inning, but seemed to
get stronger as the game went
on, and gave up only two hits
over the last four innings. "That's
usually the way it goes," Mussina
said. "I tend to get better as I go
— more consistent, more ac
curate."
The 10-hit, nine-run outburst
by the Cardinal in support of Mus
sina was in marked contrast to
the team's performance Friday,
when Stanford out-hit the Titans
8-6, but got only singles while the
Titans smacked two home runs.
Freshman Stan Spencer had a
no-hitter going through four, but
was knocked out of the box in
the fifth after giving up a walk,
a double, a two-run homer and a
single in rapid succession. Soph
omore Mark Carper, who is com
ing off knee surgery looked strong
in relief, giving up only three hits
in four-and-two-thirds innings.

throw to the bag. "I think he was
safe," Titan first baseman Rex
Peters said after the game. "It
was really close, but he was safe."
Although another run crossed the
plate on the play to make the
score 5-4, the questionable double
play effectively killed the rally.
The Titans tallied again in the
eighth to make it 6-4, and the
Cardinal answered in the eighth
to pull within one again and set
up a final Stanford rally. With
one out in the bottom of the
ninth, Eicher again drew a walk,
and Albert Richardson came on
as a pinch-runner.
Frank Carey flew out, then Ron
Witmeyer launched a slicing shot
toward the right-field corner.
With two outs, Richardson,

representing the tying run, was
oft at the crack of the bat, and
would have scored easily if the
ball had dropped. But right fielder
Jason Rolish hauled in Wit
meyer's blast on a dead run at
the warning track to end the
game.
"We were close to winning three
games this weekend," Plemel said.
"I think in the seventh, we woke
up and finally started to battle.
But we're going to have to start
battling for nine innings . . . when
we get to the point where we're
battling for nine innings, then
we'll start winning series."
The Titans built their lead on
the strength of two home runs —
a two-run shot in the first by
Ross and a solo homer by desig
nated hitter Shane Flores leading
off the sixth. Flores' homer barely
got over the left-field fence. "I
thought there was no way that
was out," Plemel said. "The ball
was just carrying real well for
them today."
On Saturday it was the Cardi
nal batters who were getting good
carry on the ball. Stanford took
advantage of all kinds of Titan
generosity — a wild pitch, three
errors and a bad fielder's choice
— to build a 5-1 lead after four.
Then senior designated hitter
Jeff Saenger, oh-for-the-season up
to that point, broke the game open
with a two-run home run to right
center.
"I didn't really expect that one
to go out," Saenger said. "I ex

pected it to go up the middle . . .
but it was nice to get a hit, and
it was nice for the first one to be
a home run."
Two innings later, Ed Sprague
bounced a two-run homer off the
scoreboard — his second home
run of the year — to make the
score 9-3.
That was more than enough
lead for freshman Mike Mussina,
who improved his record to 1-1
with a nifty complete-game nine
hitter in his Sunken Diamond
debut. Mussina began in rocky
fashion, giving up two doubles in
the first inning, but seemed to
get stronger as the game went
on, and gave up only two hits
over the last four innings. "That's
usually the way it goes," Mussina
said. "I tend to get better as I go
— more consistent, more ac
curate."
The 10-hit, nine-run outburst
by the Cardinal in support of Mus
sina was in marked contrast to
the team's performance Friday,
when Stanford out-hit the Titans
8-6, but got only singles while the
Titans smacked two home runs.
Freshman Stan Spencer had a
no-hitter going through four, but
was knocked out of the box in
the fifth after giving up a walk,
a double, a two-run homer and a
single in rapid succession. Soph
omore Mark Carper, who is com
ing off knee surgery looked strong
in relief, giving up only three hits
in four-and-two-thirds innings.

Freshman Mike Mussina's performance Saturday was one of the
bright spots for Stanford, which lost two of three to Fullerton State.
The Stanford base
ball team yester
day showed some
of the come-from
behind spark that
typified last year's
national champi-

onship squad. But all of the Car
dinal's rallies fell short and
Fullerton State prevailed 6-5 on
the strength of two home runs
and several eye-popping defensive
plays, handing the Cardinal its
first series loss at home since last
February.
The Titans won Friday's series
opener, 5-1, while the Cardinal
took Saturday's game, 9-4. With
the two losses and a win, Stan
ford, ranked No. 2 nationally in
both mi\jor preseason polls, goes
to 3-3 on the year. The Cardinal
plays next at 3 p.m. tomorrow at
the University of the Pacific in
Stockton.
Yesterday's game looked like a
rout through six innings: Going
into the seventh, Fullerton State
led 5-1, and Titan starter Mark
Beck had allowed only two hits
and had retired 16 Stanford bat
ters in a row. But Beck crumbled
in the seventh, surrenduring
singles to Jeff Saenger and Doug
Robbins and walking Brian
Johnson to load the bases with
no outs.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
inserted Eric DeGraw as a pinch

runner for Johnson. That turned
out to be a key move. When Troy
Paulsen hit a hard grounder to
third base, Titan third baseman
Ralph Ramirez had no choice but
to try to force the runner at
second. But DeGraw beat the
throw to the bag. One run was
in and the bases were still loaded
with no outs.
Beck then walked Mike Eicher
to make the score 5-3. Bases still
loaded, no outs. The game really
turned on the next play. With
Danny DeVille on in relief of Beck,
Frank Carey lashed a shot to
second. Second baseman Mike
Ross flipped to shortstop Ralph
Ramirez, who went back to first
to complete the double play.
But Carey appeared to beat the
throw to the bag. "I think he was
safe," Titan first baseman Rex
Peters said after the game. "It
was really close, but he was safe."
Although another run crossed the
