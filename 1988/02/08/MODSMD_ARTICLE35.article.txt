Stanford's volleyball squad
didn't make it home until late
yesterday afternoon, despite
the fact that they finished
playing Chico State at about 9
p.m. Saturday. A celebration
was in order, and celebrate they

did.
The No. 12 Cardinal raised its record to 5-8
with victories over UC-Davis on Friday and
the Wildcats on Saturday. Stanford man
handled the Aggies, 15-5, 15-4, 15-6, and then
went on to edge Chico the next night, 4-15,
15-8, 15-12, 15-6.
"I think we did some good things, and we
found out some things we need to work on,"
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm said. "The bottom
line against Chico State is that we weren't
prepared to play mentally."
Indeed, the Cardinal struggled to beat an
outmanned Wildcat squad that played one ot
its best matches of the season. Stanford had
numerous hitting and passing errors, which
led to a below-average hitting percentage of
.265. Moreover, the Cardinal made a number
of mistakes blocking, allowing Chico to stay
in the match until midway through the third
game.
"We weren't ready to play," sophomore Dan
Hanan said. "We made too many hitting and
blocking errors, as well as not passing very
well."
Chico State, a club team that plays in the
Northern California Collegiate Volleyball
League, was psyched to play its best volleyball
against the Cardinal, which had to contend
with a very rowdy, sell-out crowd.
"I was happy that we didn't let the crowd
get to us," sophomore Parker Blackman said.
"They were loud and rambunctious, and we
had to show some stability. We didn't play
great, but we smoothed out as the match
progressed."
It was an entirely different story on Friday.
The Cardinal played well throughout the
match against a huge Davis club team that
plays in the same league as the Wildcats.
"I think the best thing about the match
(against Davis) is how well we played," Sturm
said simply. "Everyone who contributed played
really well."
