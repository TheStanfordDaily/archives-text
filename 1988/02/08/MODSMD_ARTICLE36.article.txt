continually outdo
itself. Com

the team has ever received, the
No. 10 Cardinal reached the 20-
win milestone this weekend by
defeating Arizona State 74-69 Fri
day night in Tempe and Arizona
64-49 Saturday in Tuscon.
Stanford is now 20-1 on the
year and 8-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference, good for second place
in the league behind Washington.
The Huskies are responsible for
the Cardinal's only loss and are
No. 11 on the Associated Press
poll, first in the Pac-10.
The Wildcats and the Sun
Devils, on the other hand, hold
the bottom two spots in the
league.
Stanford's romp down south
began with a close contest at
Arizona State, a small but phys
ical team that gave the Cardinal
a hard fight in Maples Pavilion
last month before buckling to
Stanford's strong offense. The
scene on Saturday was very
similar.
The Cardinal jumped out to a
19-point lead in the first half,
finishing the first period with an
11 point advantage. However, the
second stanza brought some prob
lems.
"In the second half, we got into
foul trouble and they made a real
run for it," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. The Sun Devils
closed within one while Stanford
center Jill Yanke and guard Jen
nifer Azzi, the team's two leading
two scorers, each bore the burden
of four fouls.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal held
on to claim its 19th win of the
season, thanks to guards Charli
Turner and Sonja Henning.

"Sonja and Charli hit some key
baskets," VanDerveer said.
With the exception of Hen
ning's consistent offensive or
chestrations, Saturday night was
a totally different ballgame.
Though physically fatigued, the
Cardinal cagers mustered enough
strength to outgun the lanky
Wildcats and post win number 20.
"We were tired from the pace
of the game Friday and the
travel," the Cardinal coach
conceded. "We were down by one
at halftime and having trouble
shooting. People had tired legs."
Forward Katy Steding seemed
immune to this misfortune, as she
lept to the boards to score 10
points and grab 12 rebounds.
Freshman forward Trisha
Stevens also enjoyed a good out
ing, amassing 11 points on the
evening.
"Katy didn't hit well outside,
but she made the difference,"
VanDerveer said. "Her rebound
ing is really critical to our success.
It's good to see her have a good
game and a good weekend."
But the player who registered
the best effort was Henning.
"Defensively she did a good job
and offensively she ran the team
well both nights," VanDerveer
said. "She hit some key baskets
at key times."
Defense was the real key to con
taining the Wildcats. In order to
accomodate the exhausted Cardi
nal, VanDerveer switched to a
zone defense in the second half
which proved potent enough to
stop Arizona while giving her
players some rest.
The strategy paid off, as the
squad exploded in the second half.
The Cardinal greatly improved on
its 27 percent shooting mark and
outrebounded the Wildcats by
nine.
"I think we were fired up, and
we'd like to keep it burning for
this weekend (against Was
hington),"the Cardinal coach con
cluded.
