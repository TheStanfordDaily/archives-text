# Gymnasts vault past Cal, SJSU

You can t outbid
good weather, no
matter what your
assets.
Several Ivy
League admissions
officers have prob-

ably muttered this at one time or
another and Siberia's Department
of Tourism may have a similar
lament, but yesterday it was the
Stanford men's gymnastics team
whose appeal went unnoticed.
However, despite the fact that
most potential spectators opted to
er\joy the sun, the Stanford squad
recorded 278.55 points, its top
score of the season, and improved
its record to 6-0.
For the third time this winter,
San Jose State (249.5) was the
unlucky victim of a Cardinal team
expecting to rank at worst among
the nation's top three by season's
end. The Spartans' Brian Heery,
a 1984 Irish Olympian, performed
best in the losing effort, winning
the meet's individual competition
with 56.35 points. The Cardinal
entered only two gymnasts in all
six events, with sophomore Con
rad Voorsanger's 54.75 leading
the way.
Friday night, the Cardinal
visited California, winning 275.15
to 270. Despite a minor ankle in
jury sustained by senior Chuck

Gerardo, the meet was a positive
step for Stanford as they added
four points to their previous team
best. By adding three more points
to that total yesterday, the squad
proved itself ready for next
weekend's pivotal UCLA Invita
tional.
"This whole- weekend, we
looked really good," Gerardo said,
"but both days the last event
brought our score down. We were
looking for a little higher score
towards the end ... I think it is
pretty evident from this that we
can go 280 (points) even without
me going on everything or Randy
(Besosa) going on everything."
Going into its final apparatus
Sunday, the parallel bars, the Car
dinal had over 233 points and a
score in the area of 47 on the
bars would not have been ex
traordinary; in fact, it would have
been ordinary for this year's gym
nasts. Conversely, Stanford did its
best work on its first event, the
pommel horse.
"I think if we work for a little
more consistency, we have the
routines to definitely go above
280.," Cardinal Coach Sadao
Hamada said. "On the last two
events, we missed a 10t.... We
showed a good quality today; we
had a lot of scores around 9.7,
which I didn't expect."
The 278.55 tally is especially

national team with a polished performance on the high bar.

heartening in light of Gerardo's
injury — which kept him off the
floor exercise and vault — and
considering that co-captain Be
sosa participated only on the pom
mel horse and vault, due to a
rotator cuff injury. The pair
averaged better than 9.6 on the
events they did participate in.

Co-captain Mike Matzek also
excelled individually, taking first
place on both the rings (9.75) and
the floor (9.7). Joining Gerardo,
Besosa and Matzek in the indi
vidual winner's circle was junior
Scott Schaffer, whose 9.65 vault
tied Besosa's effort. Heery took
the parallel bars and high bar
honors.
Because it was the season's first
Maples Pavilion meet, many new
acrobatics heretofore unseen by

the viewing public were revealed
to the crowd's delight and awe.
According to Hamada, there is
still some room for fine-tuning
certain tricks and said that
working out the kinks of each
routine is a question of repitition.
Hamada also said that he now
has a good idea of which gymnasts
are strongest on which apparati.
"We've done all the basic train
ing up to this point," Hamada
said. "Now I know which guys
are the best six on each event.
