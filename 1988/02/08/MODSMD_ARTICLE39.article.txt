# Stanford upsets Huskies, wins Hobee's Invitational
## 
### Karen Gryler Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gym
nastics team took the op
portunity Friday night to
show everyone just how far
it has come. In a stunning
display of talent, the Cardi
nal won the Hobee's Invita-

tional, upsetting eighth-ranked Washing
ton 181.75 to 180.40, and beating New
Mexico's 171.50 and UC-Davis' 157.60.
Not only did the team win the meet
hands down, but each individual event was
won by a Stanford gymnast. Furthermore,
the Cardinal's performance culminated in
a 1-2-3 all-around victory — Dina Amoroso
took third place with a 36.45, Jinny Rhee
second place with a 36.50 and Alison
McGann first place with a 36.60.
Maples Pavilion was alive with excite
ment as the crowd witnessed the most
impressive Stanford performance yet.
Amoroso expressed it best: "I feel different
about the team this year. We have energy!"
The Cardinal proved Amoroso's state
ment correct after the first performer on
the first event. The team's depth was ap
parent as the women turned in a 9.05 as
their lowest score for the vault. McGann
and Amoroso brought the house down with
9.50 scores; McGann with a clean full-on,
full-off twist and Amoroso exploding with
a lay-out Tsukahara. Their performances
won them first-place honors in the event.
"We can run with any team on bars,"
Stanford Coach Homer Sardina said. The
difficulty level was there for the Cardinal,
as Rhee came through with a clean 9.00
routine for third place. McGann made her
top-level tricks look easy, scoring a 9.35
to win first place on the event.
But uncertainty and doubt plagued the
Cardinal on beam. All was not lost as soph
omore Becky Ashton amazed everyone with
a superb 9.30 performance — attacking
her routine every step of the way and

showing off a great double full turn. Aside
from Ashton's first place performance, the
Cardinal suffered falls and nervous
wobbles.
Floor had only bright spots for the team.
Susan Banta hit her double back flip for
the first time in competition, Cheryl Doo
danced up a storm and McGann performed
a sky-high double full twist. But it was
Rhee and Amoroso who truly led the way.
Rhee's awesome double-piked back flip
earned her a 9.35. Once again Amoroso
exploded with power, filling the gym >vith
excitement and energy as she performed a
9.55 routine to give her the victory on floor.
When the dust had settled, there was
no doubt which team had performed the
best at the fourth annual Hobee's Invita
tional. Washington had proved to be fal
lible, especially on beam, and the Cardinal's
difficulty level exceeded the Huskies' on
both vault and floor.
The individuals put in top-notch perfor
mances, but it was the team that had won
the meet for the Cardinal. As Banta ex
plained, "We knew we could win, but we
also knew we had to stay together to do it."
However, the team score was not as
strong as Sardina would have wished, at
tributable to falls on beam and a few on
bars. But assistant coach Sam Shaw ex
plained, "This score is a base. We're going
to build from this score." Doo agreed,
noting that improving too fast could mean
burning out early.
This victory brings the Cardinal to a
very strong 6-2 record and also brightens
the outlook for the Cardinal's hopes of
breaking into NCAAs this year.
But Sardina emphasizes that the scoring
by the officials will have a great effect on
their chances. "In our region the scores
are very suppressed. We have to try and
make sure this doesn't keep us out," he
said.
The team seems to be doing everything
in its power to ensure it makes it to the
national championships, no matter what
the obstacles.
