# Advisers dispel the Rhodes 'mystique'
## 
### Leslie Hatamiya Staff writer 
Despite the "mystique" sur
rounding the Rhodes and Mar
shall Scholarships, Stanford pro
fessors and administrators are ad
vising students to have faith in
themselves and take the risk of
applying for these annual schol
arships.
According to Meredith John, as
sistant professor in population
studies at the Food Research In
stitute and chair of the Stanford
committee on Rhodes and Mar
shall Scholarships, many Stanford
students are intimidated by the
prestige and national attention
given to the scholarships, and as
a result, do not even consider ap

plying for them.
Stanford is one of few univer
sities in the nation that most al
ways garners at least one or two
Rhodes and Marshall scholars
each year, but the University "has
the potential to have even (more
scholars) here, should more stu
dents wish to apply," John said.
Although Stanford has had "a
terrific year" — with Stanford
students receiving two of the 32
U.S. Rhodes scholarships and
three of the 30 U.S. Marshall
scholarships offered each year —
"there's no intrinsic reason that
Stanford shouldn't be getting as
many Rhodes as Harvard," John
said. Harvard had an unprecented
10 Rhodes and five Marshall
scholars this year.

John Pearson, acting director
of Bechtel International Center,
said "it would be wonderful to get
more scholars, but there's noth
ing to be ashamed of with the
numbers of scholars we get. Other
than Harvard, we do better than
just about every other university
in the nation."
According to John, "There's a
mystique about (these scholar
ships) that the recipients are all
going to be supreme court justices
and senators, that they have to
be student body president or cap
tain of the varsity football team."
However, the average Rhodes
or Marshall scholar does not nec
essarily fit this "super student"
stereotype, according to senior
Jennifer Tucker, who was

recently named a Marshall
scholar.
Being selected as a Marshall
scholar "is not something that I
anticipated as a freshman or
sophomore," said Tucker, who
will pursue a master's degree in
philosophy at Cambridge Univer
sity next year. "[These scholar
ships] are very real opportunities
within reach," she said.
Rhodes scholar Stuart Patrick,
a spring graduate who is presently
the head teaching assistant for
the human biology core, admitted
that "at the outset, applying can
be little daunting, but you have
to keep telling yourself that you
can do it."
Though the ratio of applicants
to scholarships awarded is nearly

equal at Stanford and Harvard,
Harvard applicants for the schol
arships far outnumber Stanford
applicants, John said.
This year Harvard had over 120
applicants for the Rhodes Schol
arship, while Stanford only had
40.
John partially attributed Har
vard's success in the scholarship
competitions to a geographic fac
tor.
In the Rhodes Scholarship com
petition, for example, applicants
apply to one of the 50 states,
either their home state or their
college state, and after reviewing
its pool of applicants, each state
interviews about one dozen indi
viduals and then selects two stu
dents to represent the state in
the regional competition.
Since many Stanford applica
tions are submitted in California,
most Stanford students are forced
to compete against each other in
what John describes as "one of
the most competitive states."
While Nevada might have a pool
of only 12 to 15 candidates a year,
a state as large as California
might have over 200. "That
makes the competition much
more difficult for Stanford stu
dents, compared to students from
the Ivy League schools, which are
much more geographically di
verse," John said.
This geographic factor also af
fects large state universities, such
as the University of California
and the University of Texas,
which rarely have Rhodes or Mar
shall scholars, John said.
Pearson attributed the differ
ence in the numbers of Rhodes
and Marshall scholars between
Stanford and Harvard to "a dif
ference in the philosophies of the
two universities."
Stanford is "a very laid back
university," compared to Har
vard, he said.
Harvard's House system, a
group of 13 student residences,
places scholarship advisers in
every student residence to inform
students about scholarships and
grants. "The House system nur
tures Harvard students earlier
and gives them more help in ap
plying for the scholarships," Pear
son said.
Stanford "relies a lot more on

the students" to take the initiative
to apply, John said.
However, Kristine Forsgard, di
rector of fellowships at Harvard's
Office of Career Services, said
that Harvard does not actively
recruit individual students for any
fellowships or scholarships and
that it "is entirely the student's
own responsibility."
Forsgard could not pinpoint one
specific reason why Harvard al
ways receives a large number of
Rhodes and Marshall scholarships
each year. "A good part of it is
probably luck," she said.
The quarter system also ap
pears to be a disadvantage for
Stanford in the scholarship com
petitions, John said. Since Stan
ford does not begin autumn quar
ter until the last week in Septem
ber and the applications for both
scholarships are due the first
week of October, many students
who wait until the beginning of
their senior year to apply find
themselves with not enough time
to prepare all of their application
materials.
Patrick, who will be working
toward a master's degree in
human biology and a doctorate in
biological anthropology at Oxford
for the next two to three years,
emphasized the importance of
starting the application process —
which includes a transcript, let
ters of recommendation, a list of
activities and a personal state
ment — as early as the spring
quarter of a student's junior year.
The application process "is a
major commitment and takes a
lot of motivation and emotional
energy," he said. "But, the Over
seas Research Center at Bechtel
really helped me with my appli
cation and looked out for me."
