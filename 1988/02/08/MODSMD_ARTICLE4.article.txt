# Advisers dispel the Rhodes 'mystique'

Despite the "mystique" sur
rounding the Rhodes and Mar
shall Scholarships, Stanford pro
fessors and administrators are ad
vising students to have faith in
themselves and take the risk of
applying for these annual schol
arships.
According to Meredith John, as
sistant professor in population
studies at the Food Research In
stitute and chair of the Stanford
committee on Rhodes and Mar
shall Scholarships, many Stanford
students are intimidated by the
prestige and national attention
given to the scholarships, and as
a result, do not even consider ap

plying for them.
Stanford is one of few univer
sities in the nation that most al
ways garners at least one or two
Rhodes and Marshall scholars
each year, but the University "has
the potential to have even (more
scholars) here, should more stu
dents wish to apply," John said.
Although Stanford has had "a
terrific year" — with Stanford
students receiving two of the 32
U.S. Rhodes scholarships and
three of the 30 U.S. Marshall
scholarships offered each year —
"there's no intrinsic reason that
Stanford shouldn't be getting as
many Rhodes as Harvard," John
said. Harvard had an unprecented
10 Rhodes and five Marshall
scholars this year.

John Pearson, acting director
of Bechtel International Center,
said "it would be wonderful to get
more scholars, but there's noth
ing to be ashamed of with the
numbers of scholars we get. Other
than Harvard, we do better than
just about every other university
in the nation."
According to John, "There's a
mystique about (these scholar
ships) that the recipients are all
going to be supreme court justices
and senators, that they have to
be student body president or cap
tain of the varsity football team."
However, the average Rhodes
or Marshall scholar does not nec
essarily fit this "super student"
stereotype, according to senior
Jennifer Tucker, who was

recently named a Marshall
scholar.
Being selected as a Marshall
scholar "is not something that I
anticipated as a freshman or
sophomore," said Tucker, who
will pursue a master's degree in
philosophy at Cambridge Univer
sity next year. "[These scholar
ships] are very real opportunities
within reach," she said.
Rhodes scholar Stuart Patrick,
a spring graduate who is presently
the head teaching assistant for
the human biology core, admitted
that "at the outset, applying can
be little daunting, but you have
to keep telling yourself that you
can do it."
Though the ratio of applicants
to scholarships awarded is nearly

equal at Stanford and Harvard,
Harvard applicants for the schol
arships far outnumber Stanford
applicants, John said.
This year Harvard had over 120
applicants for the Rhodes Schol
arship, while Stanford only had
40.
John partially attributed Har
vard's success in the scholarship
competitions to a geographic fac
tor.
In the Rhodes Scholarship com
petition, for example, applicants
apply to one of the 50 states,
either their home state or their
college state, and after reviewing
its pool of applicants, each state
interviews about one dozen indi
