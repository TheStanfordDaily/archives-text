# Cardinal golfers tee off at Davis

Following a week of intense prepa
ration, the Stanford men's golf team
heads north today and tomorrow to
play in the UC-Davis Invitational.
The tournament, which will be
played at the nationally prominent
Silverado Country Club in Napa,

should be a good opportunity for the squad to
improve its standing in District 8, the western
region.
Coach Wally Goodwin is looking for the team to
finish at the top of a five-team field that includes
Sacramento State, California State-Northridge,
Stanislaus and UC-Davis.
While the field is not especially strong, Goodwin
feels that the tournament will give qualifiers John
Mahon, Brad Joondeph, Roger Miraglia, Josh
Zander, Mike Hubly and Mark Funseth a chance
to build up their confidence.
"Every team that we play doesn't have to be
ASU," he said, referring to the nationally ranked
Sun Devils.
Goodwin has started to focus the team's practices
on each player's particular strengths and weak
nesses. He says that he knows what each one is
capable of scoring, and will gradually put pressure
on the players to reach their potential.
Most of the coach's efforts have been spent on
resurrecting the old fourth hole at the Stanford
Golf Course. When Tom Watson played for the
Cardinal, it was his favorite hole.
Instead of doglegging left, as the current hole
does, the old one used to continue straight along
Sand Hill Road to an elevated green. Goodwin has
renovated that green and the area around it in
order to make a private practice area for the players.
The Cardinal did well in its last outing, finishing
fifth in a field of 18 teams at Santa Barbara. How
ever, Goodwin was slightly disappointed in the per
formance because the team was only one shot away
from the third- and fourth-place teams. "You should
never lose by one shot," the coach lamented.
Maybe practicing on Tom Watson's favorite hole
will inspire the team to play like the championship
golfer himself.
