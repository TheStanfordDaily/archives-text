YOUR REPLY.. ,8.8.

with lots of sprinklers on the
Row there lived a bunch of
beautiful women and some pretty
dopey guys, and they wrote
anonymous
letters (hardly poetic) to
each other and bitched and
screamed about food and tu's,
and then Howard, you know, he...
"How does it end?"
"Do you really want to know?"
"Yeah."
"OK And they lived happily
ever after...
To the Storey women,
You're a fairy tale come true.
Love, the Storey men

HEY SQID: Slide over to my universe!
That black hole's lonely— but fix your
suction cups to my asteroid belt, and

—Venus

To know another's beauty deep,
To share her joys, her burdens keep.
To let her know she's doing well
And go for walks to break the spell
Of pressures subtly building,
To walk together on the Way,
To seek our Lord and not to stray,
To help the other find one's best
To take the good and leave the rest,
We'll serve and love each other.
Some friends we'll have for life to
know
While others will more quickly go.
When with our Lord, new friends we'll
meet
And friendships there forever keep.
We'll hold our Savior dearest.

And friend oft made apart from friend,
But when, by grace, It comes to be
That two find joy in being "we,"
We'll treasure and be thankful.
