# Students get early Florence admission
## Special deadline given to SLE program 
### Brent Bigler 
Students in the Structured
Liberal Education Western Cul
ture track have been offered spe
cial early admittance to Overseas
Study's Florence program follow
ing the reinstatement of an in
tensive 9-unit Italian language
course that would prepare them
for overseas study earlier than
most students.
The Italian course will allow
students in any of the eight West
ern Culture tracks to meet the
Overseas Studies Italian language
requirement in a single quarter,
but only SLE students have been
offered a special application dead
line allowing them to be consid
ered for the program earlier than
other students. Overseas Studies
Academic Program Officer Janet
Schmidt said that despite the
early deadline, SLE students will
have to meet the same require
ments as other students admitted
to the Florence program.
Schmidt said SLE students will
not get preferential treatment in
admission to the program. "I
don't think that being in SLE is
an advantage or a disadvantage,"
she said.
Italian Literature Prof. John
Freccero, the organizer of the
course, said the new offering was
targeted to SLE students "be
cause (they are) the most distinct
group of people who have taken
the Western Civilization canon
seriously."
The Italian course, designed to
prepare students for study in

Florence next fall, is open to all
students, but a minimum of 10
students must enroll for it to be
given, according to Annamaria
Napolitano, Italian language co
ordinator.
The special early application
date for the Florence program is
Feb. 15, said Nancy Padgett, as
sistant director of Overseas
Studies. Padgett explained that
the early admission to the pro
gram is being offered so that stu
dents can know whether or not
to enroll in the intensive class
before registration spring quarter.
Schmidt said that although
SLE students will not be given
admission preference, their aca
demic preparation matches up
well with opportunities in
Florence.
"(The SLE] group of students
is the group of students that will
get the most out of IFlorencel.
They are self-selected humanities
(studentsl ... in a rich humani
ties environment," she said.
Freccero said the idea for the
intensive course came about when
"it occurred to me that there was
a marvelous opportunity to con
tinue Western culture (study) in
Florence." By sending SLE stu
dents to Florence in their sopho
more years, Freccero said he
hopes to build on the ideas taught
in SLE about Western culture.
Padgett said there is no special
program in Florence for SLE stu
dents, although Freccero said that
if enough sophomores were at
