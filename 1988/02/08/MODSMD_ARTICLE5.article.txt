# Students get early Florence admission
## Special deadline given to SLE program 
### Brent Bigler 
Students in the Structured
Liberal Education Western Cul
ture track have been offered spe
cial early admittance to Overseas
Study's Florence program follow
ing the reinstatement of an in
tensive 9-unit Italian language
course that would prepare them
for overseas study earlier than
most students.
The Italian course will allow
students in any of the eight West
ern Culture tracks to meet the
Overseas Studies Italian language
requirement in a single quarter,
but only SLE students have been
offered a special application dead
line allowing them to be consid
ered for the program earlier than
other students. Overseas Studies
Academic Program Officer Janet
Schmidt said that despite the
early deadline, SLE students will
have to meet the same require
ments as other students admitted
to the Florence program.
Schmidt said SLE students will
not get preferential treatment in
admission to the program. "I
don't think that being in SLE is
an advantage or a disadvantage,"
she said.
Italian Literature Prof. John
Freccero, the organizer of the
course, said the new offering was
targeted to SLE students "be
cause (they are) the most distinct
group of people who have taken
the Western Civilization canon
seriously."
The Italian course, designed to
prepare students for study in

Florence next fall, is open to all
students, but a minimum of 10
students must enroll for it to be
given, according to Annamaria
Napolitano, Italian language co
ordinator.
The special early application
date for the Florence program is
Feb. 15, said Nancy Padgett, as
sistant director of Overseas
Studies. Padgett explained that
the early admission to the pro
gram is being offered so that stu
dents can know whether or not
to enroll in the intensive class
before registration spring quarter.
Schmidt said that although
SLE students will not be given
admission preference, their aca
demic preparation matches up
well with opportunities in
Florence.
"(The SLE] group of students
is the group of students that will
get the most out of IFlorencel.
They are self-selected humanities
(studentsl ... in a rich humani
ties environment," she said.
Freccero said the idea for the
intensive course came about when
"it occurred to me that there was
a marvelous opportunity to con
tinue Western culture (study) in
Florence." By sending SLE stu
dents to Florence in their sopho
more years, Freccero said he
hopes to build on the ideas taught
in SLE about Western culture.
Padgett said there is no special
program in Florence for SLE stu
dents, although Freccero said that
if enough sophomores were at
tracted to Florence next fall, a
few of the professors there would
refocus their courses to look more
closely at Western civilization
with an emphasis on Italy.
Freccero said he would be
"delighted to have other students,
but I don't know how to go about
doing it (recruiting them)." He
added that he has thought about
going to other tracks and an
nouncing the new course, but has
so far targeted only SLE students

"because they are the most visible
personally to me," he said.
Freshman Lila Weiss, a SLE
student, said "I don't think they'd
exclude anyone else, but they
came and advertised it to SLE."
She added, "what they're trying
to do is to get some pretty dedi
cated people to go their sopho
more years."
Italian courses similar to the
special course were offered during
the regular academic year several
years ago, but were dropped due
to a lack of student interest. An
intensive Italian language course
is usually offered with other in
tensive language courses during
summer quarter.
