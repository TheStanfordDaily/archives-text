# Bush third in Iowa
## Dole, Gephardt win 
### Grace Ho With wire reports 
Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas scored
a convincing triumph in lowa's
Republican presidential caucuses
last night, while former television
evangelist Pat Robertson dropped
a faltering Vice President George
Bush into third place. Rep. Rich
ard Gephardt of Missouri edged
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon to win a
seven-man Democratic race.
The surprise Republican results
in particular prompted mixed
feelings from campus political ob
servers, who debated the impact
of Robertson's second-place finish
on the rest of the GOP race.
With 70 percent of the Demo
cratic caucuses reporting in the
first big test of the 1988 presi
dential campaign, Gephardt had
27 percent of the total and led in
the separate vote to apportion
lowa delegates to the national
nominating convention.
"People are worried about
regaining control of our economic
destiny," Gephardt remarked in
claiming victory.
Simon had 24 percent and Mas
sachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
had 21 percent. Jesse Jackson
bested a disappointed Bruce Bab
bitt for fourth place.
Even further back in the pack
was Gary Hart, his comeback bid
in shambles. He had scarcely one
percent of the total.
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.,
who abandoned his lowa cam
paign before the caucuses, was
running just ahead of non
candidate Mario Cuomo.
With 98 percent of the Repub
lican piecincta reporting, Dole had
40,471 votes, or 37 percent.
Robertson had 26,645 for 25 per
cent and Bush — the nationwide
front-runner who scored a dra
matic triumph in lowa's caucuses
in 1980 — had 20,112 or 19 per
cent.
The rest of the Republican field
trailed far behind — Jack Kemp
with 11 percent, Pete du Pont
with 7 percent and Alexander
Haig, who didn't compete, had a
smattering of support.
Last night, Bush conceded
defeat in the first big test of the
1988 presidential campaign but
vowed to work harder in the New
Hampshire primary next week.
"I'm a fighter ... I'm not going
to be slinking around," he said.
Robertson said his showing was
a victory for those voters "who
wanted us to restore the greatness
of America through moral
strength."
Junior Ken Rivera, president of
the Stanford College Republicans
and a Bush suppporter, said he
did not expect Robertson to do as
well as he did. "I thought that
Robertson would keep ahead of
Kemp, but not ahead of Bush,"
he said.
But junior Joe Bozada, a Dole
supporter, said he was not
suprised that Robertson placed
second at the caucus, considering
lowa's conservative nature.
Bozada said Robertson's victory
over Bush will hurt the vice
president's campaign.
"It will cause Bush supporters

to take a closer look at Bush and
realize that the country needs a
change. We don't need another
Reagan," Bozada said.
However, Rivera downplayed
the possible negative effects
Robertson's upset might have on
the Bush campaign. "I believe
that it helped Robertson a lot
more than it hurt Bush," he said.
Junior David Shuey, a Dole stu
dent coordinator here, said he was
ecstatic that Robertson beat
Bush. "Robertson will be a
blow to Bush. It proves that
Bush's organization was not as
strong as it seems," Shuey said.
Shuey said he is planning a
White Plaza rally in support of
Dole to garner support for the
Kansas senator in the California
Republican state convention,
which will take place Feb. 19.
