# Feminist seeks power for women

### Angie Kim Staff writer 
Women must fight to gain
equality and fair representation
in government by running for
powerful public offices, said noted
feminist Eleanor Smeal, who
received a standing ovation last
night at Kresge Auditorium.
Advocating the "feminization of
power," the former president of
the National Organization for
Women defined feminists as
"women and men alike who are
disgusted with what's going on,
who are committed to the feminist
agenda and who are essentially
working for a total turn of the
damages caused by the Reagan
years." Smeal is currently presi
dent of the Fund for the Feminist
Majority, a national lobby for
women's issues.
According to Smeal, the
feminist agenda includes, among
other things, government support
for: the equality of gender and
race, reproductive freedom, peace

and disarmament, civil rights, les
bian and gay rights, economic jus
tice, homemakers' rights and the
elimination of poverty.
"Gender really makes a differ
ence in politics, and women
feminists have to fight to gain
their place so that we can get
what we — 50 percent of the pop
ulation — want and deserve,"
Smeal said.
According to Smeal, national
polls show that more people iden
tify themselves as feminists or
women's rights supporters than
as Republicans, Democrats,
liberals or conservatives. But she
added that the solid majority of
both women and men who are in
favor of the feminist movement
are "stifled and restricted by the
choices they have in the public
office candidates."
Smeal said the current presi
dential race is a clear example of
the predicament many people fall
into when they must "choose the
lesser of the two evils [among can

didates], instead of choosing
someone they really want up
there."
She cited a USA Today poll
from last week, which indicated
that 48 percent of the public,
when asked to select their favorite
presidential candidate, marked
the box "none of the above."
Smeal said that if current elec
tion trends continue, it will take
345 years before numerical parity
with men can be achieved in
Congress. "People are telling me
to be patient, not to push, to play
savvy politics. I'm not going to
wait that long — and neither
should you," Smeal exclaimed.
According to Smeal, Reagan and
the conservative Republicans are
not the only ones to blame for
the lack of success of women's
"long, losing battle" to gain
equality and respect. Republicans
and Democrats are both at fault
for allowing "the [Supreme] Court
to be lost, the military spending
to be so outrageous, the AIDS

epidemic, which must be dealt
with, to become a homophobia,"
she said.
"Why were Scalia and Kennedy
confirmed to the Court unani
mously and Bork and Rehnquist
fought by so many lobbyists and
the public, when the four are es
sentially, ideologically, just about
the same?" Smeal asked. "The
only difference between Scalia and
Kennedy is that Kennedy is the
fifth vote against women's rights,
against affirmative action, against
everything I've been working for
most of my adult life."
On the legislative level, Smeal
advocated achieving feminist ob
jectives by electing more women
and feminist representatives.
"We're losing the battle because
we need more numbers out there
in the playing field who are not
just lip-pleasing but downright
dedicated to these significant,
prevalent issues which people
have conveniently been labelling
as 'women's issues,' " she said.
