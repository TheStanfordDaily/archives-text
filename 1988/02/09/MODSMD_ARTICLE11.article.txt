Star Wars testing begins
WASHINGTON — The Defense Depart ment
yesterday successfully lofted into orbit a major
Strategic Defense Initiative experiment, a $250
million test of hardware that is vital to the
early deployment of a missile defense system,
Pentagon officials said.
The Pentagon called the experiment, code
named Delta 181, "one of the most complex
unmanned Earth orbit space missions ever
attempted by the United States."
A Delta rocket lifted a 6,000-pound satellite
complex off a launch pad at Cape Canaveral
Air Force Station, Fla., at 5:07 p.m. EDT.
Within an hour, officials said they had received
early signs that the satellite's sensors had
begun to operate on schedule.
In 12 hours of intense space maneuvers to
follow the launch, the test was to gather crucial
data in the form of thousands of pictures. The
satellite complex will expel mock warheads
and photograph them in an effort to gather
information on what Soviet nuclear warheads
would look like as they hurtle through space.
European leaders blast Israel
BONN, West Germany — Foreign ministers
of the 12-nation European Community sharply
criticized Israel yesterday for what they de
scribed as "violations of international law and
human rights" in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
The statement was the toughest by the com
munity since violence in the occupied ter
ritories broke out last December. Following a
meeting here between the ministers and Jor
dan's King Hussein, it said that "repressive
measures" being used by Israel "must stop"
and called on "all parties to exercise maximum
restraint."
The community reaffirmed its belief that
the most promising framework for a long-term
solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is an in
ternational peace conference. In an address to
the EC ministers, Hussein said that the "Arab
nation" also supported an international con
ference, to be held under the auspices of the
five nations of the United Nations Security
Council.
Israel has rejected such a conference, and
it does not appear to be a component of a
newly launched U.S. initiative in the Middle
East.

Bork criticizes opponents
GROVE CITY, Pa. — Former federal appeals
judge Robert Bork struck back last night at
opponents who defeated his Supreme Court
nomination, accusing Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., of leading an attack that "even for
a political campaign set record lows for men
dacity, brutality and intellectual vulgarity."
Bork, in his first speech since leaving the
bench Friday, said he and the administration
were too slow in reacting to what he called a
"long-planned and carefully calculated assault
by a skillful politician."
Kennedy's claim that "I was hostile to black
civil rights was a lie," Bork said, adding that
that was the only part of a campaign of "fury,
reckless disregard for the facts and outright
falsehoods" that truly angered him.
Bork's comments were made to an over
whelmingly favorable, overflow crowd of 2,500
students and teachers at Grove City College,
an institution in northwestern Pennsylvania
with a reputation for being conservative.
