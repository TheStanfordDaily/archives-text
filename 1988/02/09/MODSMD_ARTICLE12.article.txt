# Soviets set date for Afghan pullout

MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev yesterday set May 15 as
a tentative date to start withdrawing
the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops
in Afghanistan. He said they could all
be out by March 1989.
Gorbachev said in a statement
issued by Tass, the official Soviet news
agency, that the timetable is based on
an assumption that accords to end the
eight-year-old civil war in Afghanistan
will be signed by March 15.
He expressed the hope that an end
to the war in Afghanistan might lead
to settlement of other "bleeding
wounds" — in the Middle East, Cen
tral America, Cambodia, the Persian
Gulf and southern Africa.
In Washington, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: "It
sounds like a positive step, and we

hope it is, but we need to see the fine
print. We've got to know what it
means."
Charles Redman, the State Depart
ment spokesman, said: "We welcome
Gorbachev's apparent willingness to
address this question. Naturally, we
want to see further details on Gorbac
hev's offer and consult with the Pakis
tanis."
On-again, off-again peace talks, un
der U.N. auspices, have been taking
place in Geneva for years between Af
ghanistan and Pakistan, where many
Afghans have taken refuge and where
much of the effort to supply the Af
ghan rebels is organized.
The Gorbachev statement appeared
to satisfy major U.S. concerns about
a peace settlement. For one thing, Gor
bachev said that the redeployment of

"our boys" would see the withdrawal
of considerable numbers in the first
few months.
U.S. officials have advocated the
removal of a large part of the Soviet
forces in the early stages of a general
withdrawal in order to show that the
process is irreversible.
They have also expressed concern
that the Soviet Union might wish to
establish a thinly disguised puppet
regime in Kabul by having the Afghan
president, Najibullah, retain control of
such important elements as the Min
istry of Defense and the secret police.
But Gorbachev said Monday that
the withdrawal will not be conditioned
on the formation of an Afghan gov
ernment satisfactory to Moscow.
"This is a purely internal Afghan
issue," he said. "It can only be resolved

by the Afghans themselves, although
they belong to different and even op
posing camps. ... It is none of our
business."
He said the Soviet Union will be
happy if Afghanistan becomes neutral
and non-aligned.
A Soviet withdrawal could begin
even earlier than May 15, he said, if
the agreements are signed before the
middle of March.
Gorbachev's seven-page statement,
issued on behalf of the Soviet leader
ship, came after months of signals that
Moscow was ready to pull its troops
out of an increasingly unpopular war
in which there was no sign that the
Souet-backed government could win
a military victory.
