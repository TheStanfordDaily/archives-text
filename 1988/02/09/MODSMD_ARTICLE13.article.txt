# Thais to refuse refugees
## 
### 
BANGKOK, Thailand - The Thai gov
ernment will turn back all future "illegal"
refugees from its Communist-ruled neigh
bor states, Interior Minister Prachuab Sun
tharangkul declared yesterday.
Proclaiming what Radio Thailand termed
a "prevent-and-deter action against all il
legal refugees," Prachuab, Thailand's top
law enforcement official, warned foreign
governments not to interfere with Thai
policy, and appeared to direct his remarks
at the United States.
Like the United States, Prachuab said,
Thailand prevents illegal immigrants from
crossing its borders. He insisted that the
Thais will treat humanely those refugees
already in Thailand, and will try to help
them find sanctuary in third countries.
But most Indochinese in camps here have
been designated by the Thais as displaced
persons, ineligible for resettlement abroad.
And according to Prachuab, no more out
siders will be allowed in unless they meet
the international test of a refugee: a person
fleeing persecution.
The vast majority of Indochinese held
in Thai border camps are Laotians and
Cambodians, but a renewed tide of Viet
namese "boat people" triggered Prachuab's

comments over Radio Thailand.
The subject is particularly sensitive since
a number of Thai officials have been im
plicated in a smuggling operation involving
boat people and contraband. The governor
of Trat, a coastal province on the Cam
bodian border, has been replaced. Another
25 officials of the province will be replaced,
according to the press reports.
The number of Vietnamese reaching
Thailand by sea has tripled in the past
year, according to the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner on Refugees,
which oversees the operation of many of
the camps. Refugee officials say that the
increase was spurred by improved Thai
policing of pirate attacks on refugee boats
and by a dispute, now resolved, that
reduced the flow of immigrants from Viet
nam to the West, primarily to the United
States, under the U.N.-sponsored Orderly
Departure Program.
But the key factor in increased boat ar
rivals has been the development of a
refugee pipeline from Vietnam, through
Cambodia to Thailand. Payoffs are made
to officials along the way, according to
refugee accounts.
