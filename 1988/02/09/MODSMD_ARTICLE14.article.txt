### 
VIENNA — The International Commis
sion of Historians investigating allegations
of war crimes by President Kurt Waldheim
of Austria submitted a report yesterday
that criticized his behavior during and after
World War II but cited no hard evidence
of guilt.
The historians said in their report, which
they submitted! to the Austrian govern
ment, that evidence gathered over a period
of nearly six months showed that
Waldheim, 69. the former secretary-general
of the United Nations, had lied about his
record as an officer in the German army.
Government sources close to Waldheim
said that in light of the report he fully
intends to serve the remaining four years
of his term as president.
Heribert Steinbauer, chief of staff in the
office of the vice chancellor, said: "Was he
a war criminal? The report says no. There's
no possibility that Waldheim will resign."
Publication of the 200-page report was
delayed by a computer failure, but members

of the commission of historians described
the contents to Chancellor Franz Vranitzky
and Vice Chancellor Alois Mock.
Vranitzky, leader of the Socialist
conservative People's Party coalition, told
a news conference later that he was dis
turbed by some of the material dealing
with Waldheim's career and statements
that WaJdheim has made.
Several ranking members of the Socialist
Party had called for Waldheim's resigna
tion on grounds that the allegations against
him had sullied Austria's reputation world
wide.
Rut Vice Chancellor Mock, a member of
the People's Party, said he believes that
Waldheim has been vindicated of serious
charges. He said the commission, which
was appointed by the government Sept. 1,
1987, has finished its work.
The historians said they plan a news
conference Tuesday to discuss their find
ings.
