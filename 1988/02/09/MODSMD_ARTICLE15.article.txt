# Noriega indictment called long overdue
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Panama
nian military ruler Gen.
Manuel A. Noriega has long
been deeply involved in inter
national crime and could have
been indicted years ago, but
the U.S. government would not
move against him, current and
former U.S. officials told a Sen
ate panel yesterday.
"... People in law enforce
ment have known Gen. Noriega
was corrupt for a long period
of time," said New York City
Dist. Atty. Robert Morgenthau,
who termed last week's indict
ment "long overdue." He said
the Panamanian leader had
been sheltered by "high people
in the U.S. government" who
used him to gather intelligence.
Retired Army Gen. Paul Gor
man, former commander of the
U.S. Southern Command based
in Panama, said drug traffic
from Central America was so
widespread during his tenure
from 1983 to 1985 that he took
the issue to the Joint Chiefs
of Staff but "couldn't get their
attention."
The testimony came before
the Senate Foreign Relations

Committee's subcommittee on
terrorism and narcotics as the
panel opened hearings on the
effect of narcotics trafficking
on U.S. foreign policy. Noriega
was indicted in Florida Friday
along with 16 associates on
charges of drug smuggling,
racketeering and money laun
dering.
Gorman portrayed Noriega
as a "venal" leader who "was
involved in a lot of very, very
shady kinds of undertakings."
The retired general, who com
manded 10,000 U.S. troops in
Panama, said Noriega had "sig
nificant power to harass, to in
timidate and to make life dif
ficult for the men and women
of my command. I would not
do anything to irritate him, lest
he indulge in one of his
picayune acts of retribution of
which we knew him to be fully
capable."
The general recalled that
Noriega's Panamanian Defense
Forces "laid down the rules"
U.S. forces had to follow in the
nation, including those govern
ing military uniforms.
