## Caucus overrated 
### 
THE lOWA CAUCUS system,
which was designed to be a
"grassroots" part of the po
litical process, has been magnified
and distorted into the first trial
by fire of any candidate who hopes
to become the Democratic or Re
publican nominee.
Most Americans would agree
that they want a president who
understands foreign and domestic
issues well and can effectively take
control of the incredibly complex
job that is the presidency. How
ever, these are not the skills that
have been tested in lowa of late.
Rep. Richard Gephardt of Mis
souri, who "won" the Democratic
caucuses, has spent 144 days in
lowa in the past three years.
Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Bab
bitt has spent 118. Approximately
3,000 media representatives have
descended upon the state to cover
candidates conversing with pig
farmers, holding their piglets and
confronting the members of the
numerous special-interest groups
that have taken advantage of the
proceedings to advance their
causes. Not surprisingly, 47 per
cent of Gephardt's support came
from rural lowans.
Many Stanford students may not
know exactly what a caucus entails
â€” in fact, Florence Moore Hall
held a mock caucus last night to
attempt to better inform students.
Contrary to popular belief, a
caucus is not identical to a pri
mary, although its results are
being widely interpreted by the
media as if it were.
The process is an arcane relic
that favors the old-boy network of
party pros over long-shots. Less
than 20 percent of lowa's eligible
voters take the time to participate
in the caucuses, and lowa is cer
tainly not representative of the
country at large in the first place.
Those who did come to the Dem
ocratic caucuses yesterday did not

vote by secret ballot, but instead
grouped themselves in various cor
ners of a room, according to which
candidate they supported. Un
decided voters wandered about the
room until they were swayed by
peer pressure to join one of the
groups. The votes were tallied, and
any candidate with less than 15
percent of the vote was out of the
running. Then the procedure was
repeated.
The outcome of this process will
obviously be influenced by which
voters are willing to spend an en
tire evening performing this
bizarre ritual. The Rev. Pat
Robertson's unexpected strong
second-place showing in the Re
publican caucuses has much to do
with his ability to draw out fun
damentalist voters who have not
participated in the past.
The Democratic caucus-goers
were actually voting for delegates
to 99 county conventions, which
will elect delegates to six regional
conventions that will in turn
choose 52 of lowa's 58 delegates
to the Democratic National Con
vention. The Republican process is
only slightly less complex.
The lowa caucuses began gath
ering momentum toward their
present exalted position during the
1976 elections, when they pro
pelled a relatively obscure candi
date named Jimmy Carter into the
national limelight. By virtue of
being the first litmus test of a can
didate's potential, lowa became the
most important.
Voters should recognize that the
results of the lowa caucus are not
representative and should not al
low yesterday's tallies to influence
them as they choose a candidate
to support. Serious consideration
should determine who becomes the
next president, not political cir
cuses.
