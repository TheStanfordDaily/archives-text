## Racism isn't limited 
### 
RECENTLY, I had the occasion to
catch up with an old acquaintance
of mine. We got to talking and the
subject turned to the fall quarter confer
ence on racism, on which she had worked.
I expressed to her some of the frustra
tions I'd felt about the conference. The
whole event alienated me, I said. You'd
think from the way people were talking
that only white people could be racist. It
always seemed to me that there is plenty
of hate, alienation and discrimination to
go around on all sides, even between the
minority groups themselves, and all this
was ignored at the conference.
She countered in the most remarkable
way. Only white people can be racist, she
said, because they control the institutions
of power and are in the position to
oppress other groups. People of color,
particularly black people because they
have been systematically denied positions
with power to enact change, can only be
prejudiced.
Since that time, to my dismay, I have
realized that this idea isn't peculiar to
my friend. It is a carefully constructed
rhetorical statement — not, I distinguish
here, a carefully thought-out concept —
that is gaining a reasonably large accept
ance on campus.
The implications of this statement are
grave. In modern parlance, racism clearly
has a stronger, more negative connota
tion than prejudice. The result of accept
ing the new rhetoric is to believe that
negative sentiments harbored by individ
ual whites have far-reaching and odious
consequences. While in contrast, the sig

nificance of hatred felt by peoples of color,
toward whites or each other, becomes
diminished, almost negated or justified.
However, it seems obvious to me that
all people, regardless of their race or
their relative positions of power in soci
ety, are capable of discrimination and
hate. This principle is illustrated time
and again in history, as it was last year
during the infamous Howard Beach case
and several events surrounding it. In the
highly publicized incident, four young
white men from Howard Beach, N.Y., set
upon two young black men who had wan
dered into their neighborhood, beating
one and driving another on to the high
way.
In the weeks following the Howard
Beach attack, on four separate occasions
— reported only in the local press —
groups of young blacks descended upon
whites with no connection to the Howard
Beach community and beat them, yelling
"revenge, revenge." In all five cases, the
attackers had no institutional power but
just their own ability to be violent — an
ability that we all unfortunately have.
And in all the cases, the attackers chose
their victims because of their skin color.
None of the acts were more justified than
the other; each was despicable and racist.
A more serious problem than the in
accuracy of the contention that only
white people are capable of racism is the
implied justification of the anger
minorities have toward white people. Yes,
I understand that the legacy of slavery
is bitter. That the oppression of peoples
of color is a very real part of American

history. But individual whites living
today are no more responsible for the
crimes of past generations than are their
contemporaries of different races.
What is more, even though Caucasians
were often referred to as "you white
people" during the conference, white
people are not a unified group. There is
obviously no decisive agenda among us
to alienate people of color from the core
of society. If an individal is racist, as
many tend to be, you should vent your
anger at them indue proportion. But
don't hate me because my skin tone
resembles someone who wronged you. It
is not justifiable, and I won't tolerate it.
Finally, this rhetorical description
should not be taken to heart because
racism is not exclusive to one race. It is
a human condition, so to speak. If we
are not to repeat the mistakes of the
past, each group in society must learn
that it too is capable of racism and that
it is not above judging people solely on
the basis of their skin. It will be possible,
of course, to deny that peoples of color
have hatred that is equal to that of
whites, but call it anger, or prejudice or
racism ... a hate by any other name is
still hate.

And in all the cases, the attackers chose
their victims because of their skin color.
None of the acts were more justified than
the other; each was despicable and racist.
A more serious problem than the in
accuracy of the contention that only
white people are capable of racism is the
implied justification of the anger
minorities have toward white people. Yes,
I understand that the legacy of slavery
is bitter. That the oppression of peoples
of color is a very real part of American

history. But individual whites living
today are no more responsible for the
crimes of past generations than are their
contemporaries of different races.
What is more, even though Caucasians
were often referred to as "you white
people" during the conference, white
people are not a unified group. There is
obviously no decisive agenda among us
to alienate people of color from the core
of society. If an individal is racist, as
many tend to be, you should vent your
anger at them indue proportion. But
don't hate me because my skin tone
resembles someone who wronged you. It
is not justifiable, and I won't tolerate it.
Finally, this rhetorical description
should not be taken to heart because
racism is not exclusive to one race. It is
a human condition, so to speak. If we
are not to repeat the mistakes of the
past, each group in society must learn
that it too is capable of racism and that
it is not above judging people solely on
the basis of their skin. It will be possible,
of course, to deny that peoples of color
have hatred that is equal to that of
whites, but call it anger, or prejudice or
racism ... a hate by any other name is
still hate.
