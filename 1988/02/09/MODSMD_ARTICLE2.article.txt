# Flo Mo re-enacts Iowa
## Simon, Dole on top after heated caucus debates 
### Glen Tripp Staff writer 
Popping flashbulbs, television crews, political
bickering and lots of shouting dominated Florence
Moore Hall last night as over 100 politically
minded students put on their own version of the
lowa presidential caucus.
The students, many of them fervent supporters
of various presidential candidates, came together
in an attempt to simulate the actual caucus
proceedings in lowa. When debate subsided, Flo
Mo's eight Democratic delegate votes were split
among Democrats Paul Simon (3) Michael
Dukalds (3), and Jesse Jackson (2). The Repub
lican votes were shared by Robert Dole (5) and
George Bush (3).
Ex-television evangelist Pat Robertson had no
Republican supporters at the mock caucus, in
contrast to his actual surprise second-place finish

in lowa. Congressman Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
who won the real test in lowa, also failed to pick
up votes at Flo Mo.
The mock caucus was staged to increase stu
dent awareness of the candidates, the issues and
the caucus process. Junior John Lee, the Gavilan
resident assistant who originated the idea, said
before the start of the caucus that the purpose
of the project was educational. He said it should
"encourage students to take an active interest
in the [presidential] campaign, inform them
selves, and experience firsthand what it feels like
to make a political choice in front of their
friends."
Lee said afterward he couldn't have asked for
better results. "There were definitely people get
ting into the issues."

six Republicans gathered together
with undecided students at 6 p.m.
in two Flo Mo lounges, it was
immediately apparent that the
evening would not be free from
emotion.
Republicans and Democrats
operated in two separate lounges.
In the first round of caucusing,
participants were told to stand by
the sign of the candidate they sup
ported. Undecided students went
"shopping" for a candidate, lis
tening to the the views of the
various candidates' supporters.
Simultaneously, campaigners
for each candidate circulated from
group to group, trying to persuade
delegates to change their minds.
This is where the hottest debates
took place.
The loudest contest occurred
between supporters of Democratic
candidates Simon and Dukakis.
At one point the two groups
started chanting their respective
candidates' names. Dukakis sup
porters like freshman Jon Aber
nethy were quick to point out the
Massachussetts governor's suc
cessful economic reforms in his
state.
"He's committed to providing
genuine economic opportunity for

the entire country," Abernethy
said.
Meanwhile, Simon supporters
reminded reporters and potential
voters of the Illinois senator's
honesty and commitment to edu
cational funding.
Jesse Jackson campaigners
urged voters to look at their can
didate's ability to handle foreign
policy.
The first round closed with
Simon receiving 29 votes, Dukakis
26, Jackson 14, former Arizona
Gov. Bruce Babbit 11, Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore 4, former
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart 2 and
Gephardt 1. Babbit, Gore, Hart
and Gephardt were eliminated be
cause they constituted less than
15 percent of the total Democrat
vote.
Under lowa caucus rules, can
didates who receive less than 15
percent of the votes are elimi
nated from consideration. A
second round of caucusing then
commenced.
Supporters scurried about,
relying on their best debate skills
to convert potential voters. Last
minute rallying yielded a final
result of 33 votes for Simon, 32
for Dukakis and 17 for Jackson.
On the Republican side,
vigorous debate ensued between
supporters of Bush, Dole and
former Secretary of State Alexan
der Haig.
