## Much work needed to erase institutional racism 
### 
There are not many who
question the presence of institu
tional racism at Stanford. The
leadership of the University has ac
knowledged its presence, and I applaud
their candor. What has eluded the
University community is where leader
ship has designated accountability to
be housed and how that designee's
programs are evaluated.
If economics is the engine of social
change, then the financial underpin
ning of institutional racism must be
identified and extracted. Therefore,
how and where the University spends
its funds, internally and externally,
become the proper foci.
I maintain that accountability falls
squarely in one office: Business and

Finance. There can be no real and
concerted effort to correct institutional
racism at Stanford until the spending
patterns authorized by this office are
meticulously reviewed. Reasonable
recommendations submitted to this
vice-presidential area have been un
reasonably rejected.
So much for accountability, and on
to responsibility. In his excellent ad
dress at the "You Can Make a Dif
ference" conference, Randall Robinson,
executive director of TransAfrica,
correctly stated that Third World
people should be in the rooms where
decisions are made.
Whereas Robinson was speaking of
national and foreign policy matters, the
same applies to Stanford. People of

color must be in the rooms where
decisions are made.
The point is that people of color
must not only be in the room, they
must not be in the corner. They must
be in primary and not support func
tions. Nevertheless, whether in the
corner or sitting at the table, people of
color must bring new values and per
spectives into the room. People of color
with the same values and perspectives
as their predecessors only help them
selves, not those outside the room.
But there is a more compelling
responsibility. Whether in the room or
out in the parking lot (where this
writer is), people of color have a re
sponsibility to recommend, challenge or

at least question practices of their
respective offices that finance institu
tional racism. All of us must be more
sensitive to these matters.
For example, I would suspect that
most holiday parties — financed with
University funds — will be at restau
rants that are non-minority owned or
that do not employ people of color in
reasonable numbers or positions.
Someone must be responsible for
bringing these "oversights" to the
attention of those in decision-making
positions. The University-level office
responsible for this oversight is busy
looking elsewhere.
