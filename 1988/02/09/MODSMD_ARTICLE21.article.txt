# Admissions office isn't doing its job
## 
### 
Why does everyone continue to miss
the point?
I am referring to the Jean Fetter
media blitz concerning minority
"recruitment" and the constant barrage
of remarks emanating from Admissions
defending their lack of action due to
budgetary restraints, miscommunica
tion and lack of manpower.
I am one of the students that has
spoken out regarding the lack of atten
tion paid to minorities by the admis
sions office here. I and others are
upset by all the recent hoopla
generated from a Jan. 27 article that
was, in the first place, inflammatory
and misdirected.
At any rate, I am more mystified by
Jean Fetter's responses to the allega
tions that I and other students had
made during the Otero forum.
I was very disappointed that Fetter

did not see fit to confront us directly,
either as individuals or as communi
ties. There is a considerable amount of
miscommunication, or lack of any
communication for that matter, be
tween Undergraduate Admissions and
the minority groups.
Undergraduate Admissions was quite
aware that the minority groups on
campus were very upset about the
European trip. Whether the European
trip cost $2,400 or $240, the point
made in the Otero forum was that the
trip put out a clear message to the
minority communities that recruitment
of European students is a priority
important enough to Admissions to
motivate them to seek and acquire
funds outside their budget to make
such recruitment possible.
Apparently, minority recruitment
does not motivate this same search for
adequate funds. The continued argu
ment over the last few days has only
served to clarify that there is an inscn
sitivity on the part of the Admissions
staff and Fetter as she continues to
belabor the point of specific monetary

values involved yet fails to see the
overall big picture: we are upset at the
lack of specified minority recruitment.
The Ambassadors Program is indeed
a beginning, but it is hardly enough
upon which to base any sort of pride. I
am sure that I am not the only stu
dent frustrated because I feel that I
should not have to do the job of the
Admissions staff.
I should not have to create scenes to
initiate some discussion on whether or
not there should be minority recruit
ment. There should be. This should
not be an issue subject to debate; it
should be a given.
Asst. Dean Chris Ponce suggested
that Undergraduate Admissions is not
complacent with the status of minority
recruitment as it is now, but why are
they not fighting for more money and
manpower to strengthen and expand
it? Dartmouth College has a specific
admissions officer that does nothing
but American Indian recruitment, and
she travels in very rural areas and to
high schools that have significantly
high Indian student populations.

I think I am representing a general
feeling among other minority students
here when I say that I am tired of
speaking out on issues that concern
me only to have administrators retort
my feelings by saying that they are
doing everything they can but are
restrained by budgets, or putting forth
small pittances which are supposed to
subdue us until finals come around,
and we are all too tired to fight.
If Fetter and the Admissions staff
are so committed to enticing minority
students here, why do we feel that we
have to fight them? Why aren't they
talking to us and asking our advice on
how to effectively recruit minority
students to Stanford? Why don't we
feel like they are in the fight with us
instead of against us? Why should we,
as students, be responsible for commu
nicating and doing the work that is
the responsibility of the Admissions
staff themselves?
