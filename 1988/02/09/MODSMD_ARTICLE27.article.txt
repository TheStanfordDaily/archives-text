## Card nine at UOP without ace Keyser 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Brian Keyser is
the missing
piece in the
Stanford base
ball team's
pitching puzzle.
As the team,

3-3 on the year, travels to
Stockton today for a 3 p.m.
game against Pacific and
prepares for a trip to Honolulu
for a three-game series with
Hawaii this weekend, senior
Lee Plemel and freshman Mike
Mussina have established
themselves as the top two
starters on the Cardinal staff.
The third spot in the rotation
is still up for grabs. At the
beginning of the season, it was
generally expected that Keyser
would fill that spot. The junior
right-hander was 4-1 in limited
appearances, most in relief, last
year, striking out 44 in 53 in
nings. Most importantly, he
turned in an excellent perform
ance in the College World Se
ries last June in Omaha, Neb.,
starting against Louisiana
State and giving up only one
run on four hits in five innings.
All signs seemed to indicate
that Keyser, a power pitcher
with a snappy fastball and good
breaking stuff, would step into
the starting rotation this year.
Then a week before this
season opened, Keyser walked
off the mound in an intrasquad
game, having torn muscle
fibers in his right elbow.
He hasn't pitched in a game
yet this season. Although Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess
calls Keyser's status "day to
day," it's more like week to
week right now.
"It was pretty bad timing,"
Keyser said of the injury.
"Yeah, it's really frustrating.
1 People] tell me to keep my

chin up, but it was really hard
at first. It seemed like at first
I'd never throw again this
season."
But now Keyser is confident
he'll be able to pitch by the
time Pac-10 Southern Division
play starts on Feb. 26 at USC.
"There's no question I'll be
ready for league," he said.
In the meantime, Keyser is
working out every day and
trying to get the arm back to
full strength. He has been
working out with weights and
throwing, but not at full speed.
"I'm still a little tentative, es
pecially with breaking pitches,"
he said. "Everybody tells me
not to push it, and I don't want
to push it, but I also don't want
to baby it. I want to get back
in there. ... I'm getting really
impatient."
And the team is getting im
patient to have Keyser back in
action.
"We could use Brian, and he
knows it," pitching coach Tom
Dunton said on Sunday. "But
we don't want to rush him .. .
the elbow's a really touchy
thing."
"We need Keyser," Marquess
said. "We'd be that much bet
ter with him back."
Card notes
Today's game at Billy Hebert
Field in Stockton is a homecoming
for Stanford third baseman Ed
Sprague and Marquess, both of
whom hail from Stockton. When
Stanford and Pacific met in Stock
ton last year, Sprague celebrated
the return home with a grand slam
as the Cardinal crushed the Tigers,
13-2.
Pacific, a member of the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association, comes
into the game with an 0-4 record.
Todd Deck, a junior right-hander
with an 0-0 record, will start for
the Tigers.

Sprague is leading Stanford in bat
ting this year with a .368 batting
average, two home runs, seven RBIs
and a hefty .684 slugging percentage.
Junior catcher Doug Robbins is also
hitting at a .368 clip.
After the Cardinal center field
looked like musical chairs for the first
three games of the season, freshman
Mike Eicher settled in and started
there in all three of last weekend's
games against Fullerton State. He was

one-for-eight in the series, but hit the
ball hard, drew two crucial walks in
Sunday's narrow loss to the Titans
and on defense ran down several balls
deep in the alleys.
Sophomore shortstop Troy Paulsen,
who underwent rnjyor surgery on his
left knee in March after tearing liga
ments and cartilage, is showing no ill
effects of the injury. Paulsen has
shown good movement to both his
right and his left and has committed
only one error in 21 chances. "My
knee's feeling really good," Paulsen
said, "but I still feel like my range is
a little inhibited."

Sophomore shortstop Troy Paulsen,
who underwent rnjyor surgery on his
left knee in March after tearing liga
ments and cartilage, is showing no ill
effects of the injury. Paulsen has
shown good movement to both his
right and his left and has committed
only one error in 21 chances. "My
knee's feeling really good," Paulsen
said, "but I still feel like my range is
a little inhibited."
Brian Keyser is
the missing
piece in the
Stanford base
ball team's
pitching puzzle.
As the team,

3-3 on the year, travels to
Stockton today for a 3 p.m.
game against Pacific and
prepares for a trip to Honolulu
for a three-game series with
Hawaii this weekend, senior
Lee Plemel and freshman Mike
Mussina have established
themselves as the top two
starters on the Cardinal staff.
The third spot in the rotation
is still up for grabs. At the
beginning of the season, it was
generally expected that Keyser
would fill that spot. The junior
right-hander was 4-1 in limited
appearances, most in relief, last
year, striking out 44 in 53 in
nings. Most importantly, he
turned in an excellent perform
ance in the College World Se
ries last June in Omaha, Neb.,
starting against Louisiana
State and giving up only one
run on four hits in five innings.
All signs seemed to indicate
that Keyser, a power pitcher
with a snappy fastball and good
breaking stuff, would step into
the starting rotation this year.
Then a week before this
season opened, Keyser walked
off the mound in an intrasquad
game, having torn muscle
fibers in his right elbow.
He hasn't pitched in a game
yet this season. Although Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess
calls Keyser's status "day to
day," it's more like week to
week right now.
"It was pretty bad timing,"
Keyser said of the injury.
"Yeah, it's really frustrating.
1 People] tell me to keep my

chin up, but it was really hard
at first. It seemed like at first
I'd never throw again this
season."
But now Keyser is confident
he'll be able to pitch by the
time Pac-10 Southern Division
play starts on Feb. 26 at USC.
"There's no question I'll be
ready for league," he said.
In the meantime, Keyser is
working out every day and
trying to get the arm back to
full strength. He has been
working out with weights and
throwing, but not at full speed.
"I'm still a little tentative, es
pecially with breaking pitches,"
he said. "Everybody tells me
not to push it, and I don't want
to push it, but I also don't want
to baby it. I want to get back
in there. ... I'm getting really
impatient."
And the team is getting im
patient to have Keyser back in
action.
"We could use Brian, and he
knows it," pitching coach Tom
Dunton said on Sunday. "But
we don't want to rush him .. .
the elbow's a really touchy
thing."
"We need Keyser," Marquess
said. "We'd be that much bet
ter with him back."
Card notes
Today's game at Billy Hebert
Field in Stockton is a homecoming
for Stanford third baseman Ed
Sprague and Marquess, both of
whom hail from Stockton. When
Stanford and Pacific met in Stock
ton last year, Sprague celebrated
the return home with a grand slam
as the Cardinal crushed the Tigers,
13-2.
Pacific, a member of the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association, comes
into the game with an 0-4 record.
Todd Deck, a junior right-hander
with an 0-0 record, will start for
the Tigers.

Sprague is leading Stanford in bat
ting this year with a .368 batting
average, two home runs, seven RBIs
and a hefty .684 slugging percentage.
Junior catcher Doug Robbins is also
hitting at a .368 clip.
After the Cardinal center field
looked like musical chairs for the first
three games of the season, freshman
Mike Eicher settled in and started
there in all three of last weekend's
games against Fullerton State. He was

one-for-eight in the series, but hit the
ball hard, drew two crucial walks in
Sunday's narrow loss to the Titans
and on defense ran down several balls
deep in the alleys.
Sophomore shortstop Troy Paulsen,
who underwent rnjyor surgery on his
left knee in March after tearing liga
ments and cartilage, is showing no ill
effects of the injury. Paulsen has
shown good movement to both his
right and his left and has committed
only one error in 21 chances. "My
knee's feeling really good," Paulsen
said, "but I still feel like my range is
a little inhibited."
