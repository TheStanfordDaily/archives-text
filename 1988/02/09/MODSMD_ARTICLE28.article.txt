The Stanford
men's tennis team
brings its tour de
force back to the
Farm today as the
team opens its
home slate with a

1:30 p.m. match against unranked
Hawaii.
After starting the season with
three impressive victories on the
road, the top-ranked Cardinal will
be looking to get the jump on a
Hawaii team that, according to
Stanford Coach Dick Gould, is to
tally unfamiliar.
"We don't really know what to
expect from them," Gould said.
"They're not ranked, but other
than that we don't know much
about them."
The Stanford lineup for today's
action may also seem a bit un
familiar. The Cardinal will once
again be without the services of
freshman David Wheaton, who is
still out with an injury. The lineup
will be further depleted today be
cause sophomore Jeff Tarango
and senior Patrick McEnroe will
also be on the sidelines.
Tarango and McEnroe, the top
two singles players for Stanford,
will be resting during today's
match in order to take a break
after competing in the Rolex Na
tional Indoor Tennis Champion
ships this past weekend.
Freshman Martin Blackman,
who started the season as the No.
3 singles player, moves into
Tarango's No. 1 slot, while soph
omore Jeff Cathrall will compete
at No. 2 singles. Both are 3-0 in
singles action on the season.
Cathrall will also team up with
sophomore Eric Peus on the Car
dinal's No. 1 doubles team.
Rounding out the singles action
will be freshman Glenn Solomon,
sophomore Barry Richards, junior
Curtis Dunn and Peus. Solomon
will join freshman Dan Turbow
for No. 2 doubles, while Dunn
and Richards will man the No. 3
spot.

Junior Eleni Ros
sides will get a
well-deserved rest
this afternoon,
which means that
the Stanford
women's tennis

team will be playing without its
full lineup for the third time in
three matches this season.
But as it did in its first two
matches, the No. 1-ranked Cardi
nal should win relatively easily
when it hosts the Rainbow
Wahines of Hawaii today at 1:30
p.m. at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
Rossides returned from Minne
sota Sunday following an impres
sive weekend at the Rolex Na
tional Indoor Intercollegiate Ten
nis Championships. Competing
against most of the best players
in the country, she had four
straight-set victories in a row —
including a 6-2, 6-4 semifinal win
against defending champion and
No. 5 seed Sonia Hahn of Ken
tucky — before losing 6-3, 6-2 in
Sunday's final against Florida
freshman Halle Cioffi.
"She (Rossides) was very
pleased she came back strong
after a disappointing tournament
at Riviera (two weeks ago when
she was upset in the first round),"
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "She was scared and so was
I that she had lost her con
centration."
With Rossides out of the lineup
this afternoon, freshman Tami
Whitlinger will step into the No.
1 singles spot. Sophomore Lisa
Green will play No. 2, and fresh
men Sandra Birch and Teri
Whitlinger will be in the third
and fourth singles positions.
In doubles, the Whitlingers will
play at No. 1, Birch and senior
Cari Hagey will be No. 2, and
Green and senior Kay Tittle will
be in the third spot.
Hawaii is a mystery team, ac-
