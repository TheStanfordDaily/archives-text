# Golfers take the lead at Davis Invite
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf team
started this week on a positive
note, standing first after 36
holes in the UC-Davis Invita
tional tournament. The 54-hole
event, which concludes tomor
row, could mark Stanford's

first outright victory in a tournament this
season.
Playing in near-perfect conditions at the

Silverado Country Club in Napa, the Cardinal
fired a 769, outdistancing second-place Cali
fornia State-Northridge by four shots. They
were followed by UC-Davis at 779, Stanislaus
at 780 and Sacramento State, which was out
classed at 812.
Stanford Coach Wally Goodwin said that
the team's average of 76.9 was "still average
for college golf. We have a long, long, long
way to go." He was pleased by sophomore
Mark Funsenth's rounds of 74-73 (147), which
were good enough to lead the Cardinal golfers.
Funseth stands in second place among all

golfers in the tournament.
Sophomore Mike Hubly was second for
Stanford with 154, followed by junior John
Mahon and sophomore Brad Joondeph at 157,
and sophomore Josh Zander and junior Roger
Miraglia at 160.
Funseth was pleased with his play on his
home course but was sometimes frustrated
at how slow the rounds went. "When you're
hitting the ball well, you don't want to be
waiting 10 minutes at the next tee," he said.

Today's round should be a little
more difficult for the golfers.
They will be playing a different

golf course, sight unseen. The
Kennedy Golf Course should pres
ent quite a test for the squad,
with its narrow fairways and
water on 16 of the 18 holes. If
they continue to outclass the rest
of the field, however, a first-place
finish should be no problem.
