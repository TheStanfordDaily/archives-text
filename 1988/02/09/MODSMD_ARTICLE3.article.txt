# STOP van meets budget snare
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior Staff writer 
The Safe Transportation Pro
gram, a student-run organization
established to halt drunk-driving
by providing safe rides for intox
icated students, ran into an un
expected roadblock earlier this
week when the ASSU Senate Ap
propriations Committee recom
mended that STOP'S funding re
quest be left off the ASSU spring
election ballot.
The full senate will decide
tonight which student organiza
tion fee requests will be placed
on the ballot.
Undergraduate Senator Brett
Mahoney, a member of the appro
priations committee, said yester
day the committee recommended
that the fee request be turned
down because unanswered ques
tions remain regarding the pur
chase of a van for STOP. The
organization seeks a fee request
of $24,447, of which $21,000
would pay for a van and accom
panying insurance.
According to Mahoney, STOP
has failed to adequately explain
where the van would be kept while
STOP was not using it, in whose
name the van would be purchased
and how ownership of the van
would be transferred after the
nominal owner graduated.
Arguing that the STOP service
is currently offered only Wednes
day through Saturday from 11
p.m. to 2 a.m., Appropriations
Committee Chair Jon Inda said
the proposed fee assessment was
"not a worthwhile use of student
funds."
Although STOP is a good pro
gram, Inda said, "there has got
to be a better way (to provide
rides) than buying a van."
However, according to juniors
Glen Rosenbaum and Andrew
Lawson, co-presidents of STOP,
a new van is essential to the ef

fective operation of STOP.
Last quaiter, STOP "averaged
over six calls per night and
transported an average of 10
people home per evening," Rosen
baum said in a letter he distrib
uted to senators earlier this week.
STOP's increasing popularity
over the past year has given it a
"bona fide" need to purchase a
van, Rosenbaum said yesterday.

In his letter, Rosenbaum cites
an incident last week in which 10
people needed a ride home from
a party. While five of the students
got into the STOP car, the other
five refused to wait for the STOP
driver to return and decided to
drive themselves home.
"It's hard trying to stop drunk
people from doing what they
want," Rosenbaum said.
"One van with a CB (radio) is
enough to pick up 10 to 15 people
at one shot, and no bar or party
will have more than that," Law
son said.
In a meeting with Rosenbaum
and Lawson last week, the appro
priations committee proposed
that STOP accept a modified
