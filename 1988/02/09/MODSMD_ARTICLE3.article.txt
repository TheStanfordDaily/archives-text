# STOP van meets budget snare
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior Staff writer 
The Safe Transportation Pro
gram, a student-run organization
established to halt drunk-driving
by providing safe rides for intox
icated students, ran into an un
expected roadblock earlier this
week when the ASSU Senate Ap
propriations Committee recom
mended that STOP'S funding re
quest be left off the ASSU spring
election ballot.
The full senate will decide
tonight which student organiza
tion fee requests will be placed
on the ballot.
Undergraduate Senator Brett
Mahoney, a member of the appro
priations committee, said yester
day the committee recommended
that the fee request be turned
down because unanswered ques
tions remain regarding the pur
chase of a van for STOP. The
organization seeks a fee request
of $24,447, of which $21,000
would pay for a van and accom
panying insurance.
According to Mahoney, STOP
has failed to adequately explain
where the van would be kept while
STOP was not using it, in whose
name the van would be purchased
and how ownership of the van
would be transferred after the
nominal owner graduated.
Arguing that the STOP service
is currently offered only Wednes
day through Saturday from 11
p.m. to 2 a.m., Appropriations
Committee Chair Jon Inda said
the proposed fee assessment was
"not a worthwhile use of student
funds."
Although STOP is a good pro
gram, Inda said, "there has got
to be a better way (to provide
rides) than buying a van."
However, according to juniors
Glen Rosenbaum and Andrew
Lawson, co-presidents of STOP,
a new van is essential to the ef

fective operation of STOP.
Last quaiter, STOP "averaged
over six calls per night and
transported an average of 10
people home per evening," Rosen
baum said in a letter he distrib
uted to senators earlier this week.
STOP's increasing popularity
over the past year has given it a
"bona fide" need to purchase a
van, Rosenbaum said yesterday.

In his letter, Rosenbaum cites
an incident last week in which 10
people needed a ride home from
a party. While five of the students
got into the STOP car, the other
five refused to wait for the STOP
driver to return and decided to
drive themselves home.
"It's hard trying to stop drunk
people from doing what they
want," Rosenbaum said.
"One van with a CB (radio) is
enough to pick up 10 to 15 people
at one shot, and no bar or party
will have more than that," Law
son said.
In a meeting with Rosenbaum
and Lawson last week, the appro
priations committee proposed
that STOP accept a modified


Glen Rosenbaum
budget request that would allo
cate $7,500 to rent a van, rather
than purchase one.
Rosenbaum and Lawson con
tend, however, that renting a van
would pose significant problems.
According to Rosenbaum, the
main problem with renting a van
is that the driver of a rented van
must legally be 21 years old. This
eligibility requirement would
reduce STOP's current pool of
250 drivers by about 75 percent,
he predicted.
Rosenbaum said he has met
with Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Jim Bouquin to discuss the pos
sibility of the University using the
STOP van during off-hours.
Because STOP would only need
the van 12 hours a week, Rosen
baum said he plans to make the
van available for use by other Uni
versity organizations.
He suggested, for example, that
the van might be used by the
Disability Resource Center to
transport disabled community

members, or by the Public Service
Center to drive tutors and stu
dents to and from East Palo Alto.
Bouquin, who runs the Dis
ability Resource Center, said he
would like to see University or
ganizations share their resources
more.
"If STOP does get its van, the
Disability Resource Center would
like to look into establishing a
dispatch service for handicapped
students," Bouquin said.
STOP was founded two years
ago by then-sophomore Charlie
Ahern, a member of the Sigma
Chi fraternity, and was originally
run by members of Sigma Chi.
STOP currently draws from a pool
of 250 volunteers, all of whom
are fraternity or sorority mem
bers.
Rosenbaum said there has been
no need to go outside of the Greek
system to get volunteers. He
added, however, that STOP serves
the entire University community.
"For example, on Senior Casino
Night 24 out of the 29 people who
called the STOP hotline (725-
STOP) were not members of fra
ternities or sororities," Rosen
baum said.
