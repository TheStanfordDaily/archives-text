## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
The Cardinal track
and field team
went down to
Louisiana State
University over
the weekend
hoping to gain

several early qualifiers for the
Pacific 10 Conference outdoor and
NCAA indoor championships.
Stanford did not field a full team
at this indoor competition, but

individual performance was em
phasized, and Stanford Coach
Brooks Johnson returned yester
day with five new Pac-10
qualifiers, bringing the team total
to eight.
In addition, 1987 NCAA indoor
high-jump champion junior Lisa
Bernhagen qualified for the
NCAA Indoor Championship
Meet with a winning jump of 6-
IV4.
Freshman David Strang also
qualified for the indoor nationals

by running 800 meters in 1:50.1.
Strang is coming on strong and
will be a freshman terror if he
can hold his early season form
and work toward the school fresh
man record of 1:48.3 by John
Schaer in 1979.
Seniors Brian Marshall and
John Gash and sophomore
Venessa Henlon were also early
qualifiers for the Pac-10 outdoor
championships. Marshall jumped
7-2V4, missing the NCAA outdoor
mark by a mere inch but winning
the competition. Gash also won,

going 16-11 in the pole vault. Hen
lon will make Pac-lOs by virtue
of her 38-4 triple jump.
Sophomore Erica Wheeler has
already qualified for the NCAA
indoor meet in the javelin throw,
and junior Glenn Schneider is in
the Pac-10's in the discus. Fifth
year senior Marc Olesen has also
qualified for Pac-lOs in the 1,500
meters. Recent Stanford graduate
Pam Dukes also competed at LSU,
setting a track record with a
throw of 58-6 in the women's shot
put.
