You could say
Stanford men's
fencing Coach
Zoran Tulum is
confident, or
maybe just
plain arrogant.

For example, consider this
weekend's meet against UC-
Santa Cruz. Not only had
Santa Cruz tested the men's
team in their first meet at
Roble Gym in November, but
the Banana Slugs featured one
of the hottest fencers on the
West Coast, Ted Lao.
Moreover, this meet was held
in Santa Cruz.
"I wasn't worried for a
second," said Tulum, in spite
of the fact that the final tally
favored the Cardinal fencers by
a single bout, 14-13.
Even though each team had

won nine bouts going into epee,
the deciding event, Tulum
maintained his confidence. "I
was very pleased with the way
we had fenced so far ," he said.
"The sabre team couldn't be
expected to do well because
they are inexperienced. Once
the foil team had won, I felt
we would probably win in the
epee event."
The Cardinal epee fencers
decided the meet by winning
their first five bouts, including
the decisive 14th bout. With
the outcome no longer in
doubt, the final four bouts were
won by Santa Cruz.
The women's team also faced
a challenge going into Satur
day's meet. Team captain
Alexandra Rankin was unable
to fence in this meet as she
continues to recover from a
broken ankle. Without Rankin,
the lady fencers fell to Santa
Cruz 9-7.
