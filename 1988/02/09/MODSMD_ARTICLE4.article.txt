# New phase begins in NCAA drug test trial
## 
### Bruce LeDcsma Staff writer 
Drug testing of college athletes is neces
sary to discourage drug use, a drug-testing
expert testified yesterday at the opening
of the final trial of the ongoing drug-testing
battle between the NCAA and two Stanford
student athletes.
Dr. Daniel Hanley, a physician from the
Olympic and NCAA Drug Testing Commit
tees, testified on behalf of the NCAA.
Originally, witnesses for student plaintiffs
senior Jennifer Hill and junior Barry
McKeever were scheduled to testify first,
but Santa Clara County Superior Judge
Conrad Rushing reversed the schedule last

Thursday. Men's basketball Coach Mike
Montgomery is now slated to testify next
week for the plaintiffs.
According to University attorney Debra
Zumwalt, who is representing the Stanford
as a third party in the case against the
NCAA, Hanley's testimony repeated the
NCAA's argument that "you need drug
testing to deter drug use."
However, Zumwalt said that during
cross-examination Hanley made several ad
missions which could strengthen the case
for Hill, a women's soccer player, and
McKeever, a linebacker on the football
team. "He admitted that college athletes
do not use drugs any more than regular
students, and that the vast majority of

college students do not use drugs," Zum
walt said.
Additionally, Zumwalt said Hanley stated
that the drugs "do not really enhance the
performance of the athletes."
In a key point during cross-examination,
Hanley was shown a lab report of some
drug tests performed by the NCAA. Con
fronted with the report, Hanley admitted
that the paperwork following the collection
of urine samples was confusing and could
potentially lead to inaccurate evaluations
by the NCAA labs.
"He testified that these were problems
(he was unaware of) and that the NCAA
should have advised him of these
problems," Zumwalt said.

Evaluating the overall effect Hanley's
testimony had on the case, Zumwalt said,
"Overall, his testimony was good [for the
plaintiffsl. The NCAA probably would
rather have heard something else."
Rushing will make his final ruling on
the case at the conclusion of the trial,
which will continue on Feb. 10, 17 and 19.
Because Rushing is currently involved in
another case, the trial will not be heard
on consecutive days.
Future witnesses for the NCAA include
a team doctor from UC-Berkeley and an
athletic trainer from Oregon State.
