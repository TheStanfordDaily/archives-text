# Campbell leads in funding
## Incumbent Konnyu downplays significance for race 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
Stanford Law Prof. Tom Camp
bell has raised $15,000 more than
U.S. Rep. Ernest Konnyu in his
bid to capture the Republican
nomination in the 12th Congres
sional District, but the Konnyu
campaign dismissed this figure as
unimportant.
According to Federal Election
Committee reports, Campbell
raised $126,000 and Konnyu
about $111,000 before Dec. 31,
1987, the most recent filing dead
line for campaign finances.
Representatives of both cam
paigns explained yesterday that
money raised since Dec. 31 has
not yet been totaled, but that com
plete figures will be available
before the next filing deadline in
March.
Charles Garland, Konnyu's
campaign treasurer, downplayed
Campbell's fundraising lead,
saying Konnyu's campaign, which
began last fall, is not yet in full
swing. He added that Konnyu's
campaign committee plans to step
up fundraising efforts.
Campbell's campaign manager,
Karin Miranda, said Campbell's
fundraising is going "very, very
well," and predicted that the cost
of the election may eventually
reach $500,000.
She said Campbell would raise
"whatever it takes" to defeat Kon
nyu in the June 7 primary.
But Garland predicted Camp
bell may run out of funds later
because he has already tapped his
most generous donors, such as

William Hewlett, David Packard
and Louise Davies, the noted San
F'rancisco arts patron.
Garland stressed the difference
in fundraising has not played a
big role in the race so far. He
said the contest could get much
more attention now, since it is an

election year and people are be
ginning to decide which candidate
to support.
-Miranda said there is no con
nection between Campbell's suc
cessful fundraising campaign and
any possible anti-Konnyu con
stituency in the district. She said
Campbell has been successful be

cause voters are impressed by his
credentials and by where he
stands on issues. She said
Campbell's campaign is "aggres
sively" Campbell, not "anti-"
anyone.
While Campbell and Konnjai
may spend as much as half a mil
lion dollars on their campaigns,
the closest Democratic candidate,
Mountain View businessman Jim
Garrison, reported donations of
just over $71,000 to the FEC.
San Mateo County Supervisor
Anna Eshoo, who announced her
candidacy for the Democratic
nomination last week, has collec
ted almost $50,000.
Senior Mark Lemley, member
of the Stanford Democrats and
the deputy campaign manager of
the Garrison campaign, said Gar
rison's fundraising is "about in
the area where we want to be."
He said Garrison expects to spend
between $200,000 and $250,000
on the campaign, noting that the
Republican candidates "will spend
two to three times" more.
According to Campbell, his cam
paign so far has been a grassroots
affair. He has gone to meet groups
of about 50 people in private
homes, as well as writing a weekly
newspaper column for local
papers in which he expresses his
views on various issues.
He said he is aided by student
volunteers on campus and in his
campaign office.
Garland says Konnyu's cam
paign strategy features direct mail
fundraising as well as other
events, such as meeting with
groups of supporters.
