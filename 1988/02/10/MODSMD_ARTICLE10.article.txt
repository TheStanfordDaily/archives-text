# Activists to meet this weekend
## Students will try to coordinate progressivism at colleges 
### Sean Kinch Senior staff writer 
Student activists from around the state will
gather here this weekend to discuss areas of
concern and coordinate the progressive move
ment on college campuses.
"One of the problems with the 1980s is that
students care about issues, but don't know where
to go," said Barb Voss, a planning committee
member for the upcoming California Alliance of
Progressive Student Activists conference.
"The student movement is ready for this (the
organization)," Voss said in an interview with
KZSU and The Daily last night.
The conference will include panel discussions
and caucuses on vital issues of national and
international interest, such as Central America,
women's rights, student government and CIA
recruitment on campus.
The group was formed in April 1987, at a
conference at UC-Davis, and now has 300 to 400
members, according to Voss.
She said the inspiration for the formation of
the alliance was the student activist groups of
the 1960s — like Students for a Democratic
Society — though the organization is largely a
"grass roots" movement. Voss said the Alliance
is the "first statewide group of its kind in the
country."
Group leaders will try to learn from the student
movements of the 19605, Voss said, by eliminat

ing racism and sexism from within the organi
zation as far as possible. She said the organization
does not tell individuals what to believe, but
rather provides a "forum for ideas."
Those attending the conference will meet in
general assembly to establish administrative
policies and to decide on specific proposals for
action, though Voss and Alliance member Chris
Balz, a sophomore, said it is unlikely that the
alliance will make any definitive political deci
sions.
Balz, who was also in the interview, said the
group is still trying "to get people to participate"
in the alliance and is not yet ready to form a
single political perspective.
Voss said it is "possible" that the organization
will make decisions on political issues or endorse
a presidential candidate, but added that "[The
organization] rarely ever takes a specific point
of view."
"We (the alliance) tend to be an organization
that has broad, general principles, like opposing
U.S. military intervention," Voss said. The group
allows "activists on each campus to decide what
they feel is right."
Balz echoed that sentiment: "We (the alliance)
feel the quality of each person makes the organ
ization, not our principles."
Though there has been no statewide coordina
tion for the goup since April, Voss is excited
about the attitude of the people now involved in
the organization.
