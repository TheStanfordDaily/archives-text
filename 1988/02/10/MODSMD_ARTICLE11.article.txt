# Measles outbreak hits Berkeley
## 
### Mary Elizabeth McNitt Staff writer 
A recent outbreak of red
measles at UC-Berkeley will have
"no effect at Stanford," according
to Dr. Paul Walters, director of
Cowell Student Health Center.
Stanford students must show
proof of measles immunization
before entering the University, ac
cording to Walters. He said Stan
ford was one of the first univer
sities to institute this require
ment.
Four cases of the disease have
been confirmed at Berkeley, ac
cording to Cara Vaughn, public
information manager for student
health services there.
Vaughn said the disease threat
ens about 10 to 15 percent of the
people on campus who are under
the age of 30.
The Berkeley health center iso
lated all four patients in an effort
to prevent the disease's spread.
"If students had to take two
weeks out at this time of the year
(midterm season), a few might
drop out," Vaughn said.

Vaughn added that most people
over 30 have already had the dis
ease and therefore do not risk
reinfection.
Until 1969, vaccinations either
didn't exist or "weren't that
good," Vaughn said. People under
the age of 30 who were never
immunized or who received the
less effective vaccines have the
greatest risk of contracting the
measles.
Berkeley does not require
measles immunizations, Vaughn
said, because "it (the disease) has
been a lot more minor than other
problems. We're not talking about
90 percent but 10 percent.
"Every requirement you put on
is another staffing/paperwork
process," Vaughn added. She said
Berkeley would prefer to use uni
versity resources in other more
crucial areas, including AIDS ed
ucation and the prevention and
treatment of drug and alcohol
abuse.
Early measles vaccinations used
the dead virus, according to
Vaughn, and"the live virus works
much better."

"The vaccine is essentially not
effective at all during the first
year" because of a temporary im
munity to the disease that is
transferred from mother to child
at birth, Vaughn said.
Berkeley's Student Health Ser
vices is offerring free vaccina
tions, particularly for those in one
of the high risk groups.
The red measles are not the
same as the more serious German
measles also known as rubella.
Early symptoms of the disease
resemble those of the common
cold. The symptoms are followed
by a red rash, watery eyes and
high fever.
The red measles are highly con
tagious and can be contracted just
by being in the same room as an
infected person.
The illness, which lasts about
two weeks, "is more serious in
adults than in children," Vaughn
said. About one in 20 adults con
tract pneumonia as a result of
having red measles. "There have
been adult deaths due to measles
even in our age," Vaughn added.
