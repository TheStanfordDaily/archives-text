PANAMA CITY, Panama â€” Reject
ing out of hand a proposal by middle
ranking officers in Panama's army
that U.S. troops be expelled from the
Panama Canal, U.S. officials here and
in Washington declared yesterday that
no pullout was planned and that the
presence of U.S. forces at the canal
was covered by a U.S.-Panamanian
treaty in effect until the end of 1999.
The issue erupted Monday when of
ficers read a statement to Gen. Manuel
Noriega, the de facto military ruler of
Panama, calling for the expulsion of
the U.S. Southern Command, which
supervises American troops stationed
at the Panama Canal.
The call by the Panamanian officers
clearly had Noriega's backing. In a
televised speech following their state
ment, the general said that he "rejec
ted" the presence of the Southern
Command, although he stopped short

of saying U.S. troops must go home.
At a Washington briefing, Pentagon
spokesman Dan Howard said: "We
have a treaty with the government of
Panama, which, as you know, has the
United States maintaining its forces
in Panama until December 31, 1999.
And even after that date, we are
charged with maintaining the
neutrality of the Canal."
William Ormsbee, a spokesman for
the Southern Command in Panama,
commented, "The U.S. has primary
responsibility to defend and protect
the canal, and the Southern Command
is related to that."
Despite the flap, U.S. forces at the
canal have not been put on alert, and
there are no plans to evacuate families
of troops stationed there, Ormsbee
said. There are 10,000 U.S. troops and
another 20,000 American dependants
in Panama.

The question over the continued
presence of the American military here
comes amid a spiraling feud between
Washington and Noriega.
Last week, the general was charged
by two Florida grand juries with drug
smuggling, racketeering and money
laundering. The United States has
been pressuring him to step down to
allow free presidential elections in
Panama.
Charges against Noriega continued
to emerge yesterday as a onetime as
sociate of Noriega told a Senate
hearing that his former boss had con
verted the Panamanian military into
an apparatus that made millions of
dollars in illicit enterprises.
Noriega has responded to U.S. pres
sure and reports of corruption by crit
icizing the American presence at the
Panama Canal and charging that
Washington is trying to renege on the

1977 Panama Canal Treaty, which will
give full control of the canal to Panama
by the century's end.
Under treaty provisions, the United
States and Panama are required to
jointly defend the canal through the
year 1999. Until then, American offi
cials say, the U.S. troop level at the
canal is to be determined by Washing
ton.
Monday, Noriega's officers chal
lenged that interpretation of the
treaty, saying that the document "does
not contemplate" the presence of the
Southern Command. Although read to
Noriega, the call for expulsion was
directed at Eric Arturo Delvalle,
Panama's figurehead president.
Devalle has not publicly commented
on the request.
