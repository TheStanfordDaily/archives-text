# Former Noriega aide testifies on corruption
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Panamanian strong
man Manuel Noriega heads "an evil empire,
one that moves faster than the United
States," that nets millions of dollars each
year from domestic graft, international
drug running and arms smuggling to leftist
guerrillas, his one-time adviser told a con
gressional panel Monday.
In sometimes impassioned testimony,
Jose Blandon warned that drug-financed
corruption, directed from Colombia and en
couraged by Panama and Cuba, has pen
etrated most Central American military
forces and threatens the region's political
stability.
He also described a Panamanian klep
tocracy in which Noriega and his aides
made secret profits from banks, airlines,
newspapers and television stations, cus
toms and immigration services and even
duty-free airport shops.
Panama officials who work with the Drug
Enforcement Administration secretly over
see movements within the nation by mem
bers of Colombia's infamous Medellin drug
cartel, Blandon said, and turn over to
American agents mostly those narcotics

traffickers who displease Noriega or the
Medellin group.
Blandon also accused U.S. agencies,
which he did not name, of providing
Noriega with sensitive and "classified" per
sonal and political data on U.S. senators
and their aides. The data, said to include
reports on Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and their staffs,
were supplied before trips by the law
makers to Panama, Blandon said.
A subcommittee aide said later that Blan
don was referring to documents prepared
by the National Security Council or the
CIA. He did not say when the documents
were provided.
The accusations, made in testimony
before the Senate Foreign Relations sub
committee on terrorism, narcotics and in
ternational operations, drew quick denials
from some Reagan administration officials.
A CIA spokesman flatly denied charges
that the agency had given the Panamanian
government any political information on
senators or their staffs, adding that such
action would violate federal law.
