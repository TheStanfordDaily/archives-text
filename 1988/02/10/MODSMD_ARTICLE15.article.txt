# Contra grenade kills 9

MANAGUA, Nicaragua â€” A hand
grenade apparently hurled by a rebel
fighter at a Sandinista street march
killed nine Nicaraguans and injured 32
in the northern mountain town of Wiwili
Saturday night, American observers at
the site and victims' relatives reported
yesterday.
The deaths brought to 28 the number
attributed to the rebels, known as Con
tras, in the embattled northern province
of Nueva Segovia during the last week.
Almost all were civilians.
The other 19 killed, including five
children, were near Wiwili's neighboring
town of Quilali on Thursday when uni
formed men believed to be Contras
blasted a brightly painted civilian pas
senger truck with rifle fire and a pow
erful shrapnel mine.
Townspeople, in interviews over the
weekend, said those deaths made them
recoil from the rebel cause and look

favorably on the Feb. 3 congressional
vote in Washington against military aid
for the Contras.
Quilali has been sharply divided be
tween those loyal to the government in
Managua and those favoring the Con
tras. Dozens of its youths are in the
Contras' ranks. Both sides followed the
extensive radio coverage from Managua
of the vote in Washington.
"It brought us a little bit of relief to
know that the U.S. Congress didn't ap
prove more funds for death," said Bap
tist Pastor Camilo Sevilla in Quilali, a
town of about 4,500.
The attacks also raised popular fears
in the northern mountain region that
disappointed Contra fighters may be
come less disciplined in their operations
and more violent toward civilians fol
lowing the cutoff of military aid.
