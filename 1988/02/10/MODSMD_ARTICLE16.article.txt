Afghan rebels seize relief group
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — In September, one
of the largest rebel groups in Afghanistan
hijacked a French medical relief mission
headed for Badakhshan province.
The group, known as the Hizb-i-Islami, held
seven French doctors and three relief workers
captive for 10 days and confiscated their pack
train and $70,000 worth of medicines con
signed to a clandestine French hospital in
Badakhshan province.
In October and December, two other French
aid missions were intercepted by the Hizb-i-
Islami. In one incident, near the village of
Kantiwah in the Nuristan district, the equiv
alent of more than $100,000 in Afghan cur
rency was taken from the French group.
In January, a British woman charged here
that her husband, a free-lance cameraman on
an assignment for the British Broadcasting
Corp., had been robbed and killed by the Hizb
i-Islami, also near Kantiwah.
Prosecutor condemns Nofziger
WASHINGTON — Independent counsel
James McKay, in his closing argument to the
jury, declared yesterday that there is "over
whelming" evidence that lobbying by former
White House aide Lyn Nofziger broke a federal
law meant to "prevent people from coming
out of the White House and attempting to
cash in on their influence."
Nofziger was a "man to be reckoned with"
in his lobbying of former White House col
leagues, McKay said, because he was "indis
putably a close friend and powerful adviser to
people in the administration, including the
president of the United States."
McKay noted that Nofziger was paid $90,000
by a labor union and $75,000 by an aircraft
company to make allegedly forbidden contacts
at the White House after he resigned in 1982
as President Reagan's political director. Nof
ziger also received $350,000 in stock from
Wedtech Corp. after providing similar help on
an Army contract for the scandal-torn corpo
ration.
In response to McKay, defense attorney E.
Lawrence Barcella vigorously maintained that
Nofziger's lobbying was not covered by the
federal Ethics in Government Act
SDI satellite passes first test
WASHINGTON — A three-ton U.S. military
satellite has released and electronically ob
served a series of mock Soviet missiles, war
heads and warhead decoys in space, completing
the most costly experiment yet by the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI) research program.
The satellite ejected the objects over several
hours as it orbited roughly 195 miles above
the Earth, shortly after launch from Capo
Canaveral, Fla., late Monday afternoon. The
satellite then slowly danced around the objects
to obtain different views through its sensors.
The goal of the $250 million experiment
was to try to track such objects and tell them
apart, an essential task of any space-based
"Star Wars" defense against Soviet ballistic
missiles.
"Right now, we believe we've got a very
successful mission," said Army Maj. Andrew
Green, who commanded the Delta 181 mission.
Green and others at a Florida news confer
ence yesterday said this assessment was based
on a quick review of 5 percent of the copious
data collected by the satellite.
