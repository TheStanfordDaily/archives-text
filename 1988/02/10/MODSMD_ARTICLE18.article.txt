## Starve apartheid 
### 
RECENTLY, the Commission
on Investment Responsibil
ity (CIR) recommended to
the Board of Trustees that Stan
ford vote in favor of shareholder
resolutions calling for a company's
disinvestment from South Africa.
The trustees will be discussing the
issue this month before making a
decision in March.
The ClR's arguments were
strong enough to suggest an even
tougher stand. Stanford should not
only support these resolutions but
initiate them. It should sell its
equity in (divest from) any com
pany that fails to implement them.
In addition, the trustees should
regularly inform the rest of the
Stanford community as to what
particular actions have been taken
to this effect.
South Africa is ruled by a small
white minority that denies blacks
their rights to human dignity and
political representation. The CIR
report points out that "the only
measures that can weaken [South
Africa's system of apartheid] are
those that increase white support
for ending it or decrease the power
of the whites to enforce it." The
presence of American companies
in South Africa legitimizes apart
heid in the eyes of the rest of the
world. Withdrawal by American
companies would hurt the
credibility of the South African
government and add pressure on
the whites to end racism.
A coordinated American disin
vestment would ultimately reduce
the power of the white minority.
American companies operating in
South Africa support apartheid by
paying taxes to the government.
Disinvestment alone would not
decrease the government's reve
nues, because the purchasers of
the American interests would con
tinue paying taxes. It would, how

ever, deprive South Africa of the
American technical and manager
ial support that is necessary for
the long-run growth of its eco
nomy. The affluent white popula
tion is more likely to feel the effects
of a financial strain than the
greatly impoverished blacks.
Unfortunately, the withdrawal
would also hurt the blacks. Cur
rently, American companies can al
leviate the effects of apartheid on
their black employees through
various welfare programs. But as
Archbishop Desmond Tutu has
said, "we do not want apartheid
to be made more comfortable. We
want it to be dismantled."
Stanford has already resolved to
fight apartheid through its invest
ment policy. It can divest from
companies that do business with
South Africa immediately or wait
until a final shareholders' decision
on withdrawal has been reached.
If Stanford sells its stock without
waiting, chances are that the stock
will end up in the hands of some
body indifferent to the conditions
in South Africa. In contrast, Stan
ford will have much more effect if
it uses its current stockholder
power to support or even propose
motions calling for disinvestment.
If the motions are turned down,
Stanford should (jlivest on the spot.
Otherwise, it should make sure
that the motions are implemented
before a deadline that is known to
all.
Stanford could thus use its full
leverage against apartheid if it
keeps its stock in companies that
disinvest from South Africa and
divests from those that do not.
The trustees should go beyond
what has already been recom
mended to them and actively tell
the companies that "either you dis
invest from South Africa or we
divest from you."
