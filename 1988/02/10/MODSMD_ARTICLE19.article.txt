## Selection process for speaker needs to be changed 
### 
WHO THE HELL is Bob
Maynard? This question ex
presses a common sentiment
on the Stanford campus. Many stu
dents, eager to hear a speaker with
international stature, were upset with
this year's selection for a commence
ment speaker. Such disappointment
will surely grow when Stanford's Ivy
League counterparts invite an Oscar
Arias or a Margaret Thatcher. Never
theless, Robert Maynard should not be
the focus of anyone's anger.
A respected editor, Maynard's enthu
siastic response to our invitation dem
onstrated more honor and character
than a previously invited "famous"
speaker for whom a simple invitation
was not enough. Maynard is already
working diligently on what should be

an excellent speech.
Students do have a right to be
frustrated, however. Eagerly anticipat
ing this once in a lifetime event, they
were denied active participation in the
selection of their commencement
speaker, having to submit to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's per
sonal decision.
The controversy of the selection
procedure began two years ago. Stan
ford was embarrassed when its first
two choices, Mikhail Gorbachev and
Bill Cosby, declined their invitations.
The University resolved to keep the
invitation process a private one. Un
fortunately, the administration did not
make a distinction between the issue
of public versus private disclosure and

the issue of student choice versus
presidential flat.
Allegedly, a small fraction of
graduating seniors were solicited for
their recommendations. If this consti
tutes "student influence," it leaves
much to be desired. Such recommenda
tions carried as much weight as those
left in a cafeteria suggestion box. If
these surveys were to be so indicative
of student opinion (presuming they
actually existed), why was their distri
bution so arbitrary and limited? Why
did only 12 percent (200 of 1,700) of
the graduating seniors receive them,
and how were these elite chosen? A
university that can afford postage to
herald every departmental wine and
cheese is certainly able to ensure

universal participation in such a major
decision.
There are plenty of ways to include
students in the decision without facing
a repeat of 1986. Why couldn't the
"student" committee or the administra
tion draft a list of candidates to be
submitted to a student vote? The
results could be tabulated privately,
and the winner could be invited with
out great public fanfare. The Univer
sity would be spared a public faux pas,
and we would have a speaker with
whom both Donald Kennedy and the
graduating students were happy. For
the Class of '88, however, such
reforms will come too late.
