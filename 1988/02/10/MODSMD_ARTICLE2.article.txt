# Freshman English to seek better cultural awareness
## Plan aims to aid those whose second language is English 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
The Freshman English pro
gram will become more accessible
to students with different cultural
backgrounds by actively recruit
ing minority tutors and training
the program's instructors in cul
tural understanding, participants
in a discussion about the issue
agreed yesterday.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow acquiesced to
changing the program yesterday
in a meeting with a variety of
staff and faculty representatives
who were concerned that plans to
create a separate writing class for
students whose second language
is English would lead to "de facto
segregationf" according to gradu
ate student Greg Sarris.
Sarris, a Freshman English in
structor, said a separate writing
class could become a "prison
camp" where minority students
would be stigmatized as less in
telligent or inferior. "This prob
lem requires sensitivity, not
separation," he said.
Sarris originated efforts for the

program to become more cul
turally aware as an alternative to
creating a separate writing class.
In addition to Sarris' sugges
tions that the freshman English
Department hire minority tutors
and add cultural training for in
structors, others proposed that
the Freshman English Depart
ment survey freshmen to deter
mine whether the writing prob
lems of students from diverse cul
tural backgrounds are adequately
addressed in Freshman English
classes. The survey will be con
ducted by the Freshman English
Department conjunction with the
University Committee on
Minority Issues.
Several people with concerns
similar to Sarris' attended the
meeting with Wasow, including
members of the Freshman Eng
lish Department, Linguistics De
partment, the Center for Teach
ing and Learning, the Undergrad
uate Advising Center, the Univer
sity Committee on Minority Is
sues and minority faculty and
staff members.
The changes to the program,
which deal with the broad issue

of minority concerns, seek to bet
ter address a more specific con
cern voiced by Director of the Un
dergraduate Advising Center
Audrey Bernfield last spring. In
advising students, Bernfield
realized that undergraduates
from foreign countries who were
having problems with the struc
ture of the English language were
not getting the help they needed
in writing and speaking.
Instead, students were made to
feel stupid or inadequate, and
some were embarrassed to seek
help in writing English papers.
"I am mostly concerned with
students being successful and
feeling good about themselves,"
Bernfield said at yesterday's
meeting.
She proposed last spring that a
class be created within the Eng
lish for Foreign Students program
that would address the needs of
students having trouble with
grammar and syntax. This class,
taught in the Linguistics Depart
ment, would have been a 3-unit
course offered as a supplement to
Freshman English for those stu
dents who feel they would benefit
from it.
Wasow last year gave his ap
proval for the class, which will be
offered spring quarter as Linguis
tics 697.
The addition of the class
sparked concern among some fac
ulty members, particularly Sarris.
"I objected hotly because [the pro
posal to create a separate class]
assumes that the student is the
problem," said Sarris.
Because the proposal for the
new class did not clearly define
how and which students would
be selected for the class, Sarris
opposed it, saying he felt that
many American-born minority
students who do not speak Eng
lish at home or who speak a dif
ferent dialect would be funneled
into this class.
"They haven't defined what
they mean by bilingual," Sarris
said. The needs and solutions to
the problems of native bilingual
students are different than those
of foreign bilingual students, Sar
ris said.
Native bilingual students may
have "culturally different re
sponses to texts, forms of writing
and literature," as well as lan
guage usage, Sarris said. However
foreign students may have trouble
with the mechanics of the lan
guage such as noun-verb agree
ment, articles and verb tenses, ac
cording to Director of Freshman
English Charles Fifer.

In addition, there is a certain
amount of cultural insensitivity
on the part of instructors, accord
ing to Sarris.
Wasow and Director of the Eng
lish for Foreign Students Pro
gram Berverly McChesney, with
input by Casa Zapata Resident
Fellow Cecilia Burciaga, UCMI
Vice Chair Faye McNair-Knox,
Asst. Dean of the Graduate Divi
sion Anne Ninham Medicine and

Sarris, decided at the meeting to
design the Linguistics 697 specif
ically for foreign students.
To address the needs of stu
dents of color who speak English
as a second dialect, Director of
the Center for Teaching and
Learning Michele Marincovich
said she plans to continue actively
recruiting minority students to
tutor members of their ethnic
communities.

The addition of the class
sparked concern among some fac
ulty members, particularly Sarris.
"I objected hotly because [the pro
posal to create a separate class]
assumes that the student is the
problem," said Sarris.
Because the proposal for the
new class did not clearly define
how and which students would
be selected for the class, Sarris
opposed it, saying he felt that
many American-born minority
students who do not speak Eng
lish at home or who speak a dif
ferent dialect would be funneled
into this class.
"They haven't defined what
they mean by bilingual," Sarris
said. The needs and solutions to
the problems of native bilingual
students are different than those
of foreign bilingual students, Sar
ris said.
Native bilingual students may
have "culturally different re
sponses to texts, forms of writing
and literature," as well as lan
guage usage, Sarris said. However
foreign students may have trouble
with the mechanics of the lan
guage such as noun-verb agree
ment, articles and verb tenses, ac
cording to Director of Freshman
English Charles Fifer.

In addition, there is a certain
amount of cultural insensitivity
on the part of instructors, accord
ing to Sarris.

To address the needs of stu
dents of color who speak English
as a second dialect, Director of
the Center for Teaching and
Learning Michele Marincovich
said she plans to continue actively
recruiting minority students to
tutor members of their ethnic
communities.
The Freshman English pro
gram will become more accessible
to students with different cultural
backgrounds by actively recruit
ing minority tutors and training
the program's instructors in cul
tural understanding, participants
in a discussion about the issue
agreed yesterday.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow acquiesced to
changing the program yesterday
in a meeting with a variety of
staff and faculty representatives
who were concerned that plans to
create a separate writing class for
students whose second language
is English would lead to "de facto
segregationf" according to gradu
ate student Greg Sarris.
Sarris, a Freshman English in
structor, said a separate writing
class could become a "prison
camp" where minority students
would be stigmatized as less in
telligent or inferior. "This prob
lem requires sensitivity, not
separation," he said.
Sarris originated efforts for the

program to become more cul
turally aware as an alternative to
creating a separate writing class.
In addition to Sarris' sugges
tions that the freshman English
Department hire minority tutors
and add cultural training for in
structors, others proposed that
the Freshman English Depart
ment survey freshmen to deter
mine whether the writing prob
lems of students from diverse cul
tural backgrounds are adequately
addressed in Freshman English
classes. The survey will be con
ducted by the Freshman English
Department conjunction with the
University Committee on
Minority Issues.
Several people with concerns
similar to Sarris' attended the
meeting with Wasow, including
members of the Freshman Eng
lish Department, Linguistics De
partment, the Center for Teach
ing and Learning, the Undergrad
uate Advising Center, the Univer
sity Committee on Minority Is
sues and minority faculty and
staff members.
The changes to the program,
which deal with the broad issue

of minority concerns, seek to bet
ter address a more specific con
cern voiced by Director of the Un
dergraduate Advising Center
Audrey Bernfield last spring. In
advising students, Bernfield
realized that undergraduates
from foreign countries who were
having problems with the struc
ture of the English language were
not getting the help they needed
in writing and speaking.
Instead, students were made to
feel stupid or inadequate, and
some were embarrassed to seek
help in writing English papers.
"I am mostly concerned with
students being successful and
feeling good about themselves,"
Bernfield said at yesterday's
meeting.
She proposed last spring that a
class be created within the Eng
lish for Foreign Students program
that would address the needs of
students having trouble with
grammar and syntax. This class,
taught in the Linguistics Depart
ment, would have been a 3-unit
course offered as a supplement to
Freshman English for those stu
dents who feel they would benefit
from it.
Wasow last year gave his ap
proval for the class, which will be
offered spring quarter as Linguis
tics 697.
The addition of the class
sparked concern among some fac
ulty members, particularly Sarris.
"I objected hotly because [the pro
posal to create a separate class]
