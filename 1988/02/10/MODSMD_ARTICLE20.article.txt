# Date rape occurs in various settings

Enough. I am tired of having my
integrity indirectly questioned several
times a week in a publication that is
read by the University community.
Reading a Feb. 4 letter to the Daily
authored by someone I know and
respect has driven me to respond.
At the end of my freshman year, I
chose to join a housed fraternity. I was
not coerced, drunk or under the influ
ence of any drug. The decision was
voluntary and made with a clear con
science.
I chose to live in a fraternity be
cause I knew and liked members in
the house. No other reasoning entered
into the decision. In retrospect, I guess
I should have taken into account the
extreme prejudice that I would be
subject to as a member of a fraternity.
I do not enjoy it. It is not representa

tive of who I am and what I represent,
and I'm tired of it.
Fraternities, being all male, are
unfortunately going to generate more
sexism than a coed living environment.
However, I and other members of the
house have confronted people directly
and questioned comments that we
considered to be uncalled for. They do
not have the luxury of being "rarely
challenged by the few who may dis
agree."
Date rape is a societal problem.
Some men feel that they have the
right to have sex with women without
their consent. They do not, but society
as a whole has yet to accept this. Rape
is one of the hardest crimes to prose
cute. The defense tries to make it look
like the woman's fault and the jury
often buys it. The jury is effectively
biased by what they have been taught
by the society we live in.
Women are used. They are objec
tified everyday on television, in
newspapers and in magazines. They

are taught to accept it. Women's
magazines such as Vogue go so far as
to make objectification fashionable.
Education is the only means to
change this. At Stanford, the Rape
Education Project shows films and
leads discussions. Nationally, organiza
tions like Media Watch question the
media material that we are subjected
to on a daily basis. How many people
in the Stanford community actually
know about these organizations? How
many of you choose to attend the
programs offered to us?
I have very strong feelings about
calling date rape "a fraternal problem."
It upsets me. Calling date rape a
fraternal problem is not effective. If
date rape occurred only in housed
fraternities, this would be valid. This
is not true. Date rape is a problem in
fraternities, but this is only the tip of
the iceberg. Date rape is a problem on
and off college campuses throughout
the country — in dorms, fraternities
and a variety of social situations.

Calling it a fraternal problem is all too
easy.
A woman has a one-in-four chance
of being raped in her life. Date rape is
the most common and underreported
form of rape. This will not change
until society as a whole refuses to
accept rape in any form. Both women
and men will have to learn to avoid
situations where "no means yes" or
inferring a "yes" when a negative
response is given. We must learn to
communicate openly about complex and
personal issues and accept one anot
her's views. This is what must change
to eliminate date rape. Closing every
fraternal house in the nation might
have some cffect, but it would be
avoiding the core of the problem.
We all have the responsibility as
individuals to educate ourselves so that
we will have the courage to confront
sexism whenever it occurs.
