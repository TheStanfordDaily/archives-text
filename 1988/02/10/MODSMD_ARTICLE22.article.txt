## Are we ready for Pat? 
### 
ON MONDAY NIGHT, lowa
Republicans gave legitimacy to
Pat Robertson, a man who used
to make me laugh. Now he makes me
cry.
Let's get to the bottom line: Pat
Robertson is a nut. He says he frequently
talks with God, and the Big Guy tells
him what to do. God told him to buy a
TV station. In fact, God told him to run
for President. What an endorsement!
Who cares about the AFL-CIO or the
United Auto Workers when God is on
your side? Unfortunately, too many mor
tals were on Robertson's side Monday
night in lowa.
Pat Robertson has changed the course
of hurricanes headed for his home in
Virginia. No, he has. Just ask him. (Now
I know where I'm living after graduation:
next door to Pat!) I don't know what
your God is telling you, but mine is
whispering that this guy isn't playing
with a full collection plate. (Maybe we
should call Pat and make sure it doesn't
rain on Robert Maynard at Commence
ment. Going skiing at Lake Tahoe this
weekend and need some fresh powder?
Call Pat!)
Seriously, Pat Robertson could not
have run viably in 1976, 1980 or 1984.
In those days, Ronald Reagan had the
fundamentalist vote under his right
thumb (all without God's endorsement,
mind you). By preaching (oops, bad
word!) basic family values, prayer in
school, a drug-free America and an end
to abortion, Reagan was able to wrap up

the very votes moderates George Bush
and Bob Dole can't capture today.
Robertson beat Bush in lowa Monday
night, a real political spitball you could
have seen coming. To be frank, Robertson
on the stump or talking about the issues
seems somewhat thoughtful. No doubt
he has some views about working women
(they should quit now) and religious
minorities (they aren't fit to govern) that
seem very strange, but he is an articulate
man, and he has an uncanny knack for
de-emphasizing his religious tenets and
teachings on the campaign trail. This is
frightening at best.
Just appearing on a debate stage with
George Bush or Bob Dole gives Robertson
lots of legitimacy, and to be blunt, he's
a "winner" in the debates each time he
doesn't try to heal A 1 Haig's hemorrhoids
by placing his hands on them. When he
remains in control he becomes viable as
a candidate, and from there you can
finish the script. People expect a fanatic
faith healer who speaks in tongues and
makes Tammy Faye Bakker seem sincere,
and instead they get a polished Yale law
graduate who has similar ideas to Bush
and Dole on trade and defense. He also
looks super on television. They respond
positively, thinking, "What was all the
fuss?"
Consequently, there's a hidden army
of Robertson supporters out there, and
they should frighten you. They adore this
man who advocates a much higher
birthrate to produce lots more taxpayers
who can solve the Social Security crunch,
and the worst part is that they are

staunch in their support. These are
zealous people who will brave the snow
to cast a vote. Also, Robertson's campaign
workers call these people on the phone
and tell them not to tell pollsters whom
they're voting for. That way, political
pundits vastly underestimate Robertson's
share of the vote, and on caucus or pri
mary night, his numbers seem
"surprisingly" high, producing lots of free
media and favorable coverage.
Ouch, I just had a horrid thought: I'm
in the checkout line at Safeway later this
week, and all I see is Pat Robertson's
giddy face on the covers of Time,
Newsweek and U.S. News. That really
smarts. Get ready, because it's coming.
By week's end, we'll know Pat
Robertson's favorite trade bill (courtesy
of Newsweek), his favorite game show
(courtesy of People magazine) and his
favorite power tool (courtesy of Popular
Mechanics). In fact, before very long,
we're going to know all there is to know
about Pat Robertson. Actually, as long
as the people of America haven't forgot
ten how to read, maybe that's the most
comforting news yet.

Robertson beat Bush in lowa Monday
night, a real political spitball you could
have seen coming. To be frank, Robertson
on the stump or talking about the issues
seems somewhat thoughtful. No doubt
he has some views about working women
(they should quit now) and religious
minorities (they aren't fit to govern) that
seem very strange, but he is an articulate
man, and he has an uncanny knack for
de-emphasizing his religious tenets and
teachings on the campaign trail. This is
frightening at best.
Just appearing on a debate stage with
George Bush or Bob Dole gives Robertson
lots of legitimacy, and to be blunt, he's
a "winner" in the debates each time he
doesn't try to heal A 1 Haig's hemorrhoids
by placing his hands on them. When he
remains in control he becomes viable as
a candidate, and from there you can
finish the script. People expect a fanatic
faith healer who speaks in tongues and
makes Tammy Faye Bakker seem sincere,
and instead they get a polished Yale law
graduate who has similar ideas to Bush
and Dole on trade and defense. He also
looks super on television. They respond
positively, thinking, "What was all the
fuss?"
Consequently, there's a hidden army
of Robertson supporters out there, and
they should frighten you. They adore this
man who advocates a much higher
birthrate to produce lots more taxpayers
who can solve the Social Security crunch,
and the worst part is that they are

staunch in their support. These are
zealous people who will brave the snow
to cast a vote. Also, Robertson's campaign
workers call these people on the phone
and tell them not to tell pollsters whom
they're voting for. That way, political
pundits vastly underestimate Robertson's
share of the vote, and on caucus or pri
mary night, his numbers seem
"surprisingly" high, producing lots of free
media and favorable coverage.
Ouch, I just had a horrid thought: I'm
in the checkout line at Safeway later this
week, and all I see is Pat Robertson's
giddy face on the covers of Time,
Newsweek and U.S. News. That really
smarts. Get ready, because it's coming.
By week's end, we'll know Pat
Robertson's favorite trade bill (courtesy
of Newsweek), his favorite game show
(courtesy of People magazine) and his
favorite power tool (courtesy of Popular
Mechanics). In fact, before very long,
we're going to know all there is to know
about Pat Robertson. Actually, as long
as the people of America haven't forgot
ten how to read, maybe that's the most
comforting news yet.
