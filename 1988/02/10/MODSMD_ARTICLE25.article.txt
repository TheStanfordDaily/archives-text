## Club team swings out winter slump 
### Dusan Djordjevich 
While some Stanford students let their
bodies deteriorate until the spring thaw, stu
dents seeking indoor exercise flock to the
deGuerre courts to play squash, handball and
racquetball.

Commitment and determina
tion will probably not mean
victory for the racquetball
team when they face the
colliegate powerhouses.

Not surprisingly, the Stanford racquetball
team shifts into high gear during the winter
quarter — with both men's and women's
teams beginning their seasons. The club sport
sponsors its annual all-University open tour
nament this quarter as well.
According to senior Suzanne Meier, a mem
ber of the women's team, "things are looking
good" for the Stanford racquetball team this

season. "We beat UC-Davis (in a fall preseason
match), and there's a lot of determination on
the team," she said.
Team captian Rakesh Anand, a junior, also
said he felt positive about this year's team.
"I'm really happy about the team. Everyone's
more committed this year," Anand said.
Both the men's and women's teams compete
in the Northern California Intercollegiate Rac
quetball League. The six player teams compete
in singles and doubles matches. However, the
team takes along extra players to compete in
non-scoring matches, allowing players to gain
competition experience, Anand said.
"We want the team to improve as a whole,"
he added.
According to Anand, the team has no formal
coach. Instead, members of the team "coach
each other."
To help with the team coaching, players
have recently begun videotaping their games
and analyzing each other's strengths and
weaknesses.
"The videotaping has really helped," Anand
said, and with everyone committed to enjoying
a successful season, "I believe that this team
can do well at nationals."

Despite Anand's positive outlook, "commit
ment" and "determination" will probably not
mean victory for the raquetball team when
they face the well-known powerhouses of col
legiate racquetball.
Sacramento State, the two-time defending
national champion, hosts this year's champi
onship tournament. Sacramento not only
recruits players but offers scholarships as well.
"They (Sacramento State) usually do not
even bother putting up a team against us in
regionals," because they can play more com
petitive matches in the open competitions,
Anand said.
While Sacramento has the financial backing
to create what Anand calls a "racquetball
dynasty," the Stanford Racquetball Club's
budget is modest. Team members pay $10 a
quarter in dues.
Like other club sports, the racquetball club
raises money by helping with ticket sales and
ushering at University sports events. The an
nual all-University weekend tournament run
by the club also helps with team funding.
Anand offers raquetball lessons during the
quarter to help meet the the team's financial
costs as well.
