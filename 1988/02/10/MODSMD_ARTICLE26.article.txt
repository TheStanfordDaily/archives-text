# Inquisitive bug investigates sperm bank
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
A lot of people have been asking
me lately what's the best thing
about being the Bug. I gotta say
that without question it's the
fame and admiration that I get
whenever I go out in public. Why
just last Saturday I was at a party
and almost immediately a whole
group of folks came and gathered
around and started smiling and
pointing at me. Of course, this
stopped when I finished dancing,
but it's the thought that counts.

Dear Bug,
What is the procedure for get
ting a sample from a Nobel
laureate sperm bank 1 ?
— Not Interested, Just Curious
It's the same as the procedure
for getting a sample from a Nobel
laureate — just ask.
Eight years ago retired entre
preneur Robert Graham, now 82,
established the Repository for
Germinal Choice in Escondido,
Calif. The Repository, as it is af
fectionately called by director
Dora Vaux, is a sperm bank which
solicits donations only from what
they perceive to be the strongest
genes in the nationwide gene pool
— not only Nobel Prize winners,
but also scientists and non
scientists who are the top men in
their fields. Men who are solicited
to donate are the most respected
among their peers. They are high
achievers; they have high IQs,
kind personalities, diverse inter
ests and good looks.
I don't know how they deter
mine who has good looks and who
doesn't. Remember, one woman's

Pierce Brosnan is another's Ozzie
Osbourne. (Obscure analogy of
the day.)
Futhermore, prospective do
nors are screened for any genet
ically inheritable traits: Mental ill
ness, alcoholism, diabetes and
more. Only when the physicians
on the board of the Repository
have identified someone who
seems to be a potentially potent
donor do they send that man a
letter asking him to spare some
semen.
And yes, these doctors do make
house calls. Employees of the
Repository will fly to wherever
the donor lives to make the pick
up. After they come, he does the
same, and the sperm is mixed with
a buffer agent and frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Then they go on their
merry way, sperm in hand.
Little vocal opposition to the
Repository is heard today, but
when founder Robert Graham
first established the exclusive
sperm bank in 1980, cries that
Graham was trying to revive Hit
ler's master race echoed through
out the country.
Graham, who financed the
Repository with his earnings from
the invention of shatterproof
lenses, is regarded as one of this
country's most vocal opponents
of dysgenics. Dysgenics is the the
ory that the genetically weak or
inferior are reproducing and
spreading bad genes. In his self
published book "The Future of
Man," Graham says that man is
"an evolutionary derelict," and
"only man is so ignorant as to
allow his worst animals to breed.
Seventy percent of the population
possesses mediocre intelligence or
less, all because huge masses of
those with ordinary minds have
been allowed to come into being
and then proliferate."
So Graham established the
Repository for Germinal Choice
in order to spread only the very
best genes that exist.
The qualifications for receiving
sperm from the Repository are
much less strict than to donate.
Women wishing to become im
planted with the sperm must fill
out a questionnaire, attesting to
the genetic background and his
tory of mental and physical health
of the wife and husband. Any

couple that shows no pre
vious flaws — and that can show
that they would be able to be good
parents to a child — can receive
sperm from the Repository. Ex
cept for a $50 processing fee and
a $10 monthly nitrogen freezing
fee, the sperm comes free of
charge. The Repository is, in fact,
a non-profit organization.
Once a couple is accepted to
receive sperm, they go through a
catalog of donors; there are 10
currently available. Each donor,
although remaining anonymous,
is described in intricate detail.
Their medical history, race, reli
gion, national origin, profession,
coloring and IQ are listed, as well
as physical appearance, personal
ity and interests. The couple then
chooses the donor from whom
they wish to receive frozen sperm,
and the rest is biological.
One minor problem is that
sperm which has been frozen is
40 percent less likely to impreg
nate women than sperm directly
from the tap. Sometimes the
woman's physician must admin
ister several samples of the sperm
until she is able to become preg
nant.

When founder Robert
Graham first estab
lished the exclusive
sperm bank in 1980
cries rang out that
he was trying to
revive Hitler's master
race.

It is imperative, however, that
the sperm be frozen, because tests
such as the one for AIDS take 90
days to complete, and sperm
doesn't keep for 90 days in the
fridge. Conveniently, the half-life
of sperm frozen in nitrogen is a
whopping 1,000 years. By com
parison, Uranium-230 has a half
life of 20.8 days. The implications
of this are horrible, not the least
of which is that after the nuclear
holocaust, the lingering radiation
will disappear, and the only things
left on earth will be frozen sperm,

individually-wrapped American
cheese slices and twinkies, fight
ing it out for world domination.
Forty-three babies have been
born of sperm from the
Repository, and there are 18 more
women who are pregnant. All of
the babies are allegedly "perfect,"
and, in fact, there exist far too
many nauseating magazine
profiles of couples who are con
vinced that little Billy began
walking earlier than the other
kids in preschool because his
father won a Nobel Prize for
physics. Yeah, tell me another
one.
So now we tackle the question
which is surely on all of your
minds: Have any of Stanford's
many Nobel prize recipients
donated to the Repository for Ger
minal Choice? Why don't we ask!
I called Nobel prize winner
Linus Pauling, who could almost
be given credit for inventing vi
tamin C, and asked him if he had
ever been asked to donate sperm
to a sperm bank. (I swear I really
did this. His phone number's in
the faculty/staff directory.) Ac
cording to Pauling, he had
received a letter asking him to
donate, but answered saying no.
Thanks Linus, and pass the
Chewable C's.
Prof. Kenneth Arrow, a Nobel
Prize winner in economics, replied
to the question of whether he had
ever been asked with, "Very
simple. No." Thanks Kenneth,
guess they must have asked Mil
ton instead, huh?

Prof. Emeritus of Electrical En
gineering William Shockley, who
received the 1956 Nobel Prize for
physics for his part in the inven
tion of the transistor, refused to
comment. In a 1980 article in The
New York Times, Shockley was
quoted as saying he had donated
to the Repository "more than on
_ _ »
ce.
Much of the furor over the crea
tion of the Repository in 1980
centered around Shockley's asso
ciation with the sperm bank.
Shockley is well-known for his
suggested voluntary sterilization
plan in which the genetically dis
advantaged would be offered in
centives not to reproduce. There
exist, however, a few disturbing
problems with his definition of
the genetically disadvantaged. For
example, he claims, according to
The New York Times article,
these voluntary sterilizations
would help remedy the fact that
the "lowest component of black
people are the ones that are
growing most rapidly."
In 1984, Shockley sued the At
lanta Constitution for a 1980
column by Roger Witherspoon
that likened his theories to the
Nazis' genetic experiments in
World War 11. In a deposition
taken for the libel case, Shockley
said that "the major cause of the
American Negro's intellectual and
social deficit is hereditary and ra
cially genetic in origin and not
remedial to a major degree by
practical improvements in en
vironment."

According to The New York
Times' account of the 1984 trial,
Shockley also argued that while
many blacks are superior to many
whites, in general blacks are in
ferior in intelligence as measured
by IQ tests.
On September 14, 1984 he won
the libel case and was awarded
the tidy sum of one dollar in dam
ages. And while I wouldn't risk
paying one dollar by calling his
views Hitlerian, I still must ask
the obvious question: Why is this
man at Stanford?
Founder Graham says, "We are,
I think, selective, but we're not
racist. We'll accept excellence in
any race." He claims to have ap
proached black men to be donors,
but said none have been receptive
to the idea.
Today the opposition to the
Repository has dwindled to a mere
whisper, and the number of
satisfied recipients and donors
continue to grow day by day. Most
of the customers of the bank are
couples whose male half is infer
tile either for biological reasons
or often because of a previous ir
reversible vasectomy. So, if you're
a married woman under 38 years
of age, with a stable genetic his
tory, in good mental and physical
health and with an infertile hus
band, you might consider trying
the Repository for Germinal
Choice in order to form a more
perfect child.
The rest of us will have to settle
for donating and receiving sam
ples on a more personal basis.

out the country.
Graham, who financed the
Repository with his earnings from
the invention of shatterproof
lenses, is regarded as one of this
country's most vocal opponents
of dysgenics. Dysgenics is the the
ory that the genetically weak or
inferior are reproducing and
spreading bad genes. In his self
published book "The Future of
Man," Graham says that man is
"an evolutionary derelict," and
"only man is so ignorant as to
allow his worst animals to breed.
Seventy percent of the population
possesses mediocre intelligence or
less, all because huge masses of
those with ordinary minds have
been allowed to come into being
and then proliferate."
So Graham established the
Repository for Germinal Choice
in order to spread only the very
best genes that exist.
The qualifications for receiving
sperm from the Repository are
much less strict than to donate.
Women wishing to become im
planted with the sperm must fill
out a questionnaire, attesting to
the genetic background and his
tory of mental and physical health
of the wife and husband. Any

couple that shows no pre
vious flaws — and that can show
that they would be able to be good
parents to a child — can receive
sperm from the Repository. Ex
cept for a $50 processing fee and
a $10 monthly nitrogen freezing
fee, the sperm comes free of
charge. The Repository is, in fact,
a non-profit organization.
Once a couple is accepted to
receive sperm, they go through a
catalog of donors; there are 10
currently available. Each donor,
although remaining anonymous,
is described in intricate detail.
Their medical history, race, reli
gion, national origin, profession,
coloring and IQ are listed, as well
as physical appearance, personal
ity and interests. The couple then
chooses the donor from whom
they wish to receive frozen sperm,
and the rest is biological.
One minor problem is that
sperm which has been frozen is
40 percent less likely to impreg
nate women than sperm directly
from the tap. Sometimes the
woman's physician must admin
ister several samples of the sperm
until she is able to become preg
nant.

When founder Robert
Graham first estab
lished the exclusive
sperm bank in 1980
cries rang out that
he was trying to
revive Hitler's master
race.

It is imperative, however, that
the sperm be frozen, because tests
such as the one for AIDS take 90
days to complete, and sperm
doesn't keep for 90 days in the
fridge. Conveniently, the half-life
of sperm frozen in nitrogen is a
whopping 1,000 years. By com
parison, Uranium-230 has a half
life of 20.8 days. The implications
of this are horrible, not the least
of which is that after the nuclear
holocaust, the lingering radiation
will disappear, and the only things
left on earth will be frozen sperm,

individually-wrapped American
cheese slices and twinkies, fight
ing it out for world domination.
Forty-three babies have been
born of sperm from the
Repository, and there are 18 more
women who are pregnant. All of
the babies are allegedly "perfect,"
and, in fact, there exist far too
many nauseating magazine
profiles of couples who are con
vinced that little Billy began
walking earlier than the other
kids in preschool because his
father won a Nobel Prize for
physics. Yeah, tell me another
one.
So now we tackle the question
which is surely on all of your
minds: Have any of Stanford's
many Nobel prize recipients
donated to the Repository for Ger
minal Choice? Why don't we ask!
I called Nobel prize winner
Linus Pauling, who could almost
be given credit for inventing vi
tamin C, and asked him if he had
ever been asked to donate sperm
to a sperm bank. (I swear I really
did this. His phone number's in
the faculty/staff directory.) Ac
cording to Pauling, he had
received a letter asking him to
donate, but answered saying no.
Thanks Linus, and pass the
Chewable C's.
Prof. Kenneth Arrow, a Nobel
Prize winner in economics, replied
to the question of whether he had
ever been asked with, "Very
simple. No." Thanks Kenneth,
guess they must have asked Mil
ton instead, huh?

Prof. Emeritus of Electrical En
gineering William Shockley, who
received the 1956 Nobel Prize for
physics for his part in the inven
tion of the transistor, refused to
comment. In a 1980 article in The
New York Times, Shockley was
quoted as saying he had donated
to the Repository "more than on
_ _ »
ce.
Much of the furor over the crea
tion of the Repository in 1980
centered around Shockley's asso
ciation with the sperm bank.
Shockley is well-known for his
suggested voluntary sterilization
plan in which the genetically dis
advantaged would be offered in
centives not to reproduce. There
exist, however, a few disturbing
problems with his definition of
the genetically disadvantaged. For
example, he claims, according to
The New York Times article,
these voluntary sterilizations
would help remedy the fact that
the "lowest component of black
people are the ones that are
growing most rapidly."
In 1984, Shockley sued the At
lanta Constitution for a 1980
column by Roger Witherspoon
that likened his theories to the
Nazis' genetic experiments in
World War 11. In a deposition
taken for the libel case, Shockley
said that "the major cause of the
American Negro's intellectual and
social deficit is hereditary and ra
cially genetic in origin and not
remedial to a major degree by
practical improvements in en
vironment."

According to The New York
Times' account of the 1984 trial,
Shockley also argued that while
many blacks are superior to many
whites, in general blacks are in
ferior in intelligence as measured
by IQ tests.
On September 14, 1984 he won
the libel case and was awarded
the tidy sum of one dollar in dam
ages. And while I wouldn't risk
paying one dollar by calling his
views Hitlerian, I still must ask
the obvious question: Why is this
man at Stanford?
Founder Graham says, "We are,
I think, selective, but we're not
racist. We'll accept excellence in
any race." He claims to have ap
proached black men to be donors,
but said none have been receptive
to the idea.
Today the opposition to the
Repository has dwindled to a mere
whisper, and the number of
satisfied recipients and donors
continue to grow day by day. Most
of the customers of the bank are
couples whose male half is infer
tile either for biological reasons
or often because of a previous ir
reversible vasectomy. So, if you're
a married woman under 38 years
of age, with a stable genetic his
tory, in good mental and physical
health and with an infertile hus
band, you might consider trying
the Repository for Germinal
Choice in order to form a more
perfect child.
The rest of us will have to settle
for donating and receiving sam
ples on a more personal basis.


BUG
ME

A lot of people have been asking
me lately what's the best thing
about being the Bug. I gotta say
that without question it's the
fame and admiration that I get
whenever I go out in public. Why
just last Saturday I was at a party
and almost immediately a whole
group of folks came and gathered
around and started smiling and
pointing at me. Of course, this
stopped when I finished dancing,
but it's the thought that counts.

Dear Bug,
What is the procedure for get
ting a sample from a Nobel
laureate sperm bank 1 ?
— Not Interested, Just Curious
It's the same as the procedure
for getting a sample from a Nobel
laureate — just ask.
Eight years ago retired entre
preneur Robert Graham, now 82,
established the Repository for
Germinal Choice in Escondido,
Calif. The Repository, as it is af
fectionately called by director
Dora Vaux, is a sperm bank which
solicits donations only from what
they perceive to be the strongest
genes in the nationwide gene pool
— not only Nobel Prize winners,
but also scientists and non
scientists who are the top men in
their fields. Men who are solicited
to donate are the most respected
among their peers. They are high
achievers; they have high IQs,
kind personalities, diverse inter
ests and good looks.
I don't know how they deter
mine who has good looks and who
doesn't. Remember, one woman's

Pierce Brosnan is another's Ozzie
Osbourne. (Obscure analogy of
the day.)
Futhermore, prospective do
nors are screened for any genet
ically inheritable traits: Mental ill
ness, alcoholism, diabetes and
more. Only when the physicians
on the board of the Repository
have identified someone who
seems to be a potentially potent
donor do they send that man a
letter asking him to spare some
semen.
And yes, these doctors do make
house calls. Employees of the
Repository will fly to wherever
the donor lives to make the pick
up. After they come, he does the
same, and the sperm is mixed with
a buffer agent and frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Then they go on their
merry way, sperm in hand.
Little vocal opposition to the
Repository is heard today, but
when founder Robert Graham
first established the exclusive
sperm bank in 1980, cries that
Graham was trying to revive Hit
ler's master race echoed through
out the country.

days to complete, and sperm
doesn't keep for 90 days in the
fridge. Conveniently, the half-life
of sperm frozen in nitrogen is a
whopping 1,000 years. By com
parison, Uranium-230 has a half
life of 20.8 days. The implications
of this are horrible, not the least
of which is that after the nuclear
holocaust, the lingering radiation
will disappear, and the only things
left on earth will be frozen sperm,

individually-wrapped American
cheese slices and twinkies, fight
ing it out for world domination.
Forty-three babies have been
born of sperm from the
Repository, and there are 18 more
women who are pregnant. All of
the babies are allegedly "perfect,"
and, in fact, there exist far too
many nauseating magazine
profiles of couples who are con
vinced that little Billy began
walking earlier than the other
kids in preschool because his
father won a Nobel Prize for
physics. Yeah, tell me another
one.
So now we tackle the question
which is surely on all of your
minds: Have any of Stanford's
many Nobel prize recipients
donated to the Repository for Ger
minal Choice? Why don't we ask!
I called Nobel prize winner
Linus Pauling, who could almost
be given credit for inventing vi
tamin C, and asked him if he had
ever been asked to donate sperm
to a sperm bank. (I swear I really
did this. His phone number's in
the faculty/staff directory.) Ac
cording to Pauling, he had
received a letter asking him to
donate, but answered saying no.
Thanks Linus, and pass the
Chewable C's.
Prof. Kenneth Arrow, a Nobel
Prize winner in economics, replied
to the question of whether he had
ever been asked with, "Very
simple. No." Thanks Kenneth,
guess they must have asked Mil
ton instead, huh?

Prof. Emeritus of Electrical En
gineering William Shockley, who
received the 1956 Nobel Prize for
physics for his part in the inven
tion of the transistor, refused to
comment. In a 1980 article in The
New York Times, Shockley was
quoted as saying he had donated
to the Repository "more than on
_ _ »
ce.
Much of the furor over the crea
tion of the Repository in 1980
centered around Shockley's asso
ciation with the sperm bank.
Shockley is well-known for his
suggested voluntary sterilization
plan in which the genetically dis
advantaged would be offered in
centives not to reproduce. There
exist, however, a few disturbing
problems with his definition of
the genetically disadvantaged. For
example, he claims, according to
The New York Times article,
these voluntary sterilizations
would help remedy the fact that
the "lowest component of black
people are the ones that are
growing most rapidly."
In 1984, Shockley sued the At
lanta Constitution for a 1980
column by Roger Witherspoon
that likened his theories to the
Nazis' genetic experiments in
World War 11. In a deposition
taken for the libel case, Shockley
said that "the major cause of the
American Negro's intellectual and
social deficit is hereditary and ra
cially genetic in origin and not
remedial to a major degree by
practical improvements in en
vironment."

According to The New York
Times' account of the 1984 trial,
Shockley also argued that while
many blacks are superior to many
whites, in general blacks are in
ferior in intelligence as measured
by IQ tests.
On September 14, 1984 he won
the libel case and was awarded
the tidy sum of one dollar in dam
ages. And while I wouldn't risk
paying one dollar by calling his
views Hitlerian, I still must ask
the obvious question: Why is this
man at Stanford?
Founder Graham says, "We are,
I think, selective, but we're not
racist. We'll accept excellence in
any race." He claims to have ap
proached black men to be donors,
but said none have been receptive
to the idea.
Today the opposition to the
Repository has dwindled to a mere
whisper, and the number of
satisfied recipients and donors
continue to grow day by day. Most
of the customers of the bank are
couples whose male half is infer
tile either for biological reasons
or often because of a previous ir
reversible vasectomy. So, if you're
a married woman under 38 years
of age, with a stable genetic his
tory, in good mental and physical
health and with an infertile hus
band, you might consider trying
the Repository for Germinal
Choice in order to form a more
perfect child.
The rest of us will have to settle
for donating and receiving sam
ples on a more personal basis.


BUG
ME

A lot of people have been asking
me lately what's the best thing
about being the Bug. I gotta say
that without question it's the
fame and admiration that I get
whenever I go out in public. Why
just last Saturday I was at a party
and almost immediately a whole
group of folks came and gathered
around and started smiling and
pointing at me. Of course, this
stopped when I finished dancing,
but it's the thought that counts.

Dear Bug,
What is the procedure for get
ting a sample from a Nobel
laureate sperm bank 1 ?
— Not Interested, Just Curious
It's the same as the procedure
for getting a sample from a Nobel
laureate — just ask.
Eight years ago retired entre
preneur Robert Graham, now 82,
established the Repository for
Germinal Choice in Escondido,
Calif. The Repository, as it is af
fectionately called by director
Dora Vaux, is a sperm bank which
solicits donations only from what
they perceive to be the strongest
genes in the nationwide gene pool
— not only Nobel Prize winners,
but also scientists and non
scientists who are the top men in
their fields. Men who are solicited
to donate are the most respected
among their peers. They are high
achievers; they have high IQs,
kind personalities, diverse inter
ests and good looks.
I don't know how they deter
mine who has good looks and who
doesn't. Remember, one woman's

Pierce Brosnan is another's Ozzie
Osbourne. (Obscure analogy of
the day.)
Futhermore, prospective do
nors are screened for any genet
ically inheritable traits: Mental ill
ness, alcoholism, diabetes and
more. Only when the physicians
on the board of the Repository
have identified someone who
seems to be a potentially potent
donor do they send that man a
letter asking him to spare some
semen.
And yes, these doctors do make
house calls. Employees of the
Repository will fly to wherever
the donor lives to make the pick
up. After they come, he does the
same, and the sperm is mixed with
a buffer agent and frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Then they go on their
merry way, sperm in hand.
Little vocal opposition to the
Repository is heard today, but
when founder Robert Graham
first established the exclusive
sperm bank in 1980, cries that
Graham was trying to revive Hit
ler's master race echoed through
out the country.
Graham, who financed the
Repository with his earnings from
the invention of shatterproof
lenses, is regarded as one of this
country's most vocal opponents
of dysgenics. Dysgenics is the the
ory that the genetically weak or
inferior are reproducing and
spreading bad genes. In his self
published book "The Future of
Man," Graham says that man is
"an evolutionary derelict," and
"only man is so ignorant as to
allow his worst animals to breed.
Seventy percent of the population
possesses mediocre intelligence or
less, all because huge masses of
those with ordinary minds have
been allowed to come into being
and then proliferate."
So Graham established the
Repository for Germinal Choice
in order to spread only the very
best genes that exist.
The qualifications for receiving
sperm from the Repository are
much less strict than to donate.
Women wishing to become im
planted with the sperm must fill
out a questionnaire, attesting to
the genetic background and his
tory of mental and physical health
of the wife and husband. Any

couple that shows no pre
vious flaws — and that can show
that they would be able to be good
parents to a child — can receive
sperm from the Repository. Ex
cept for a $50 processing fee and
a $10 monthly nitrogen freezing
fee, the sperm comes free of
charge. The Repository is, in fact,
a non-profit organization.
Once a couple is accepted to
receive sperm, they go through a
catalog of donors; there are 10
currently available. Each donor,
although remaining anonymous,
is described in intricate detail.
Their medical history, race, reli
gion, national origin, profession,
coloring and IQ are listed, as well
as physical appearance, personal
ity and interests. The couple then
chooses the donor from whom
they wish to receive frozen sperm,
and the rest is biological.
One minor problem is that
sperm which has been frozen is
40 percent less likely to impreg
nate women than sperm directly
from the tap. Sometimes the
woman's physician must admin
ister several samples of the sperm
until she is able to become preg
nant.

When founder Robert
Graham first estab
lished the exclusive
sperm bank in 1980
cries rang out that
he was trying to
revive Hitler's master
race.

It is imperative, however, that
the sperm be frozen, because tests
such as the one for AIDS take 90
days to complete, and sperm
doesn't keep for 90 days in the
fridge. Conveniently, the half-life
of sperm frozen in nitrogen is a
whopping 1,000 years. By com
parison, Uranium-230 has a half
life of 20.8 days. The implications
of this are horrible, not the least
of which is that after the nuclear
holocaust, the lingering radiation
will disappear, and the only things
left on earth will be frozen sperm,

individually-wrapped American
cheese slices and twinkies, fight
ing it out for world domination.

born of sperm from the
Repository, and there are 18 more
women who are pregnant. All of
the babies are allegedly "perfect,"
and, in fact, there exist far too
