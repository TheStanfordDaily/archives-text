## Winter One Acts: ambitious but dull 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
This year's edition of the
Original Winter One-Acts, unfor
tunately, is bogged down by three
dull scripts which, while ambi
tious, never quite achieve what
they set out to show. The end
result is three plays that don't
work individually and don't offer
any sort of contrast for the eve
ning of drama.
"The Sins of the Father," writ
ten by graduate student Lindsay
Mikolitch, explores how a young
father is unable to deal rationally
with his new baby or his wife,
mostly because of the relationship
he had with his own father as a
child.
There are a number of serious
problems with this play. First of
all, the characters are not
remotely believable, and it was
hard to imagine that the mother
and father were married at all,
much less for the four years as
claimed in the play.
Besides that, there is virtually
no dramatic tension in this sup
posed drama. The climactic scene,
if you can call it that, came across
as no big surprise and was com
pletely inevitable.
The second play, and clearly the
best, is "Allyson's Dance" by
senior Juan Chanco. This play
also has its problems but is pulled
together nicely with a wonderful
performance by One-Acts veteran
senior John Johnston.

Allyson (sophomore Kristin
Jordahl) is a bitingly acrid girl
who is — or at least thinks she
is — dying. There are a lot of
metaphors floating eerily around
in this one, but more or less we
are charged with the task of de
termining whether or not Allyson
is dying — physically, spirtually
or emotionally.
There's no telling what this
play actually means, if anything,
and even the playwright's notes
make some kind of vague claim
about the play being difficult to
understand.
Jordahl's Allyson is definitely
sarcastic, probably too much so.
She recites her lines with brilliant
intonation but forgets that she is
supposed to be interacting with
the other characters. Johnston
steals the show playing the male
characters, while senior Megan
Henney's female characters are
quite delightful.
"Allyson's Dance" is a little
long, and it hungers for a clear
plot, but some strong perform
ances make it the best of the three
One-Acts.
If "Allyson's Dance" hungers
for a clear plot, then Gina
Schmeling's "Strands" died of
starvation months ago. This
odious ode to obscurity is a laugh
ably bad attempt at being deep
and meaningful. Folks, you've
gotta do more than string to
gether a series of non-sequiturs
spoken by characterless charac
ters to have drama.

"Strands" is an attempt at
something — maybe surrealism,
maybe existentialism, maybe
cubism, I don't know — but it
comes off as a ridiculous embar
rassment.
Here's what happens: Penelope
(sophomore Ann Podlozny) and
Paul (sophomore Marc Katz) are
in bed together (and going at it
pretty hot and heavy, I might
add). Meanwhile, Greg (junior Bill
Burnside) is slowly walking
around their bed.
The dialogue consists of
seemingly random sentences
begun by one character and
finished by the other. Somewhere
in the middle there are some
vague references to Homer's
"Odyssey" (get it, Penelope?), and
frankly I wouldn't have minded
if Odysseus had come in and slain

them all.
Understandably, young direc
tors and producers want to select
plays that will allow them to prac
tice their interpretive skills. Un
fortunately, they don't realize
that it is not required to exercise
those skills on vague, confusing
dramas.
I wonder why there is such
aversion on campus to producing
plays with straightforward plots
and characters. Why do all the
plays have to be so "artistic"and
profound?
What really drags these One-
Acts down is that there is no con
trast between them. We go from
straight-serious to experimental
serious to obscure-serious.
The One-Acts will be running
tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m.
at the Elliot Program Center.

no dramatic tension in this sup
posed drama. The climactic scene,
if you can call it that, came across
as no big surprise and was com
pletely inevitable.
The second play, and clearly the
best, is "Allyson's Dance" by
senior Juan Chanco. This play
also has its problems but is pulled
together nicely with a wonderful
performance by One-Acts veteran
senior John Johnston.

Allyson (sophomore Kristin
Jordahl) is a bitingly acrid girl
who is — or at least thinks she
is — dying. There are a lot of
metaphors floating eerily around
in this one, but more or less we
are charged with the task of de
termining whether or not Allyson
is dying — physically, spirtually
or emotionally.
There's no telling what this
play actually means, if anything,
and even the playwright's notes
make some kind of vague claim
about the play being difficult to
understand.
Jordahl's Allyson is definitely
sarcastic, probably too much so.
She recites her lines with brilliant
intonation but forgets that she is
supposed to be interacting with
the other characters. Johnston
steals the show playing the male
characters, while senior Megan
Henney's female characters are
quite delightful.
"Allyson's Dance" is a little
long, and it hungers for a clear
plot, but some strong perform
ances make it the best of the three
One-Acts.
If "Allyson's Dance" hungers
for a clear plot, then Gina
Schmeling's "Strands" died of
starvation months ago. This
odious ode to obscurity is a laugh
ably bad attempt at being deep
and meaningful. Folks, you've
gotta do more than string to
gether a series of non-sequiturs
spoken by characterless charac
ters to have drama.

"Strands" is an attempt at
something — maybe surrealism,
maybe existentialism, maybe
cubism, I don't know — but it
comes off as a ridiculous embar
rassment.
Here's what happens: Penelope
(sophomore Ann Podlozny) and
Paul (sophomore Marc Katz) are
in bed together (and going at it
pretty hot and heavy, I might
add). Meanwhile, Greg (junior Bill
Burnside) is slowly walking
around their bed.
The dialogue consists of
seemingly random sentences
begun by one character and
finished by the other. Somewhere
in the middle there are some
vague references to Homer's
"Odyssey" (get it, Penelope?), and
frankly I wouldn't have minded
if Odysseus had come in and slain

them all.
Understandably, young direc
tors and producers want to select
plays that will allow them to prac
tice their interpretive skills. Un
fortunately, they don't realize
that it is not required to exercise
those skills on vague, confusing
dramas.
I wonder why there is such
aversion on campus to producing
plays with straightforward plots
and characters. Why do all the
plays have to be so "artistic"and
profound?
What really drags these One-
Acts down is that there is no con
trast between them. We go from
straight-serious to experimental
serious to obscure-serious.
The One-Acts will be running
tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m.
at the Elliot Program Center.
