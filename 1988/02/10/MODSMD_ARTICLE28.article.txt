# 1930s come alive at Stanford Theater
## 
### Luisa F. Ribeiro 
For just a moment last Fri
day night, at the Stanford
Theater's Classic Movie
Premiere, the 1930s were alive
again. The evening sky was
filled with bright lights and top
hats bobbed along, paired off
with glittering pearls and even
a few ostrich feathers.
Parked at the curb in front
of the theater, in all their glory,
were a '39 Cadillac, a '25 Lin
coln, a '34 Buick, even a '35
Studebaker and the gem of
them all â€” a '29 Dusenberg.
It is to the credit of the Pack
ard Foundation that they wish
to preserve the art, glory and
glamour of that period by
buying and refurbishing the
Stanford Theater (221 Univer
sity Ave. in downtown Palo
Alto). Friday night opened a
five-week classic movie extrav
aganza that will be a treat for
any film buff.
With the cooperation of the
UCLA Film Archives, the
theater is presenting an array
of films featuring the work of
three directors: Ernst
Lubitsch, Rouben Mamoulian
and Josef von Sternberg.
The foundation hopes to
have the Theater completely
restored and plans include
having a Mighty Wurlitzer in
stalled by this time next year,
completing the restoration of

not only a building, but an era.
The festival began with a
brief synopsis of the plans for
the theater, with promises that
this five-week festival will be
"the first of many." The audi
ence was then given a visual
example of the importance of
the work being done at the
UCLA archives.
A brief clip from an early
Lillian Gish classic brought a
collective moan as the effects
of time have caused the film
to corrode and bubble, making
it beyond even the Archive's
ability to repair. A burst of ap
plause followed a restored clip
of George Burns and Gracie
Allen soft-shoeing and trading
quips.
All the clips were shown on
35mm prints with carbon arc
projectors, highlighting the
grand opulence for which films
of that era were known.
The festival will continue
with a "new" old film almost
every day. This weekend fea
tures several of von
Sternberg's films with Marlene
Dietrich, including "Morocco,"
"Blonde Venus" and"The
Scarlet Empress."
With screenings such as this,
in a setting that enhances the
enjoyment of real cinema as it
was always meant to be, it is
with a terrific sigh of relief that
one can relax knowing that al
though the 1930s may be gone,
they will never be dead.
