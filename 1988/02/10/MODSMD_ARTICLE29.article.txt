# Marinovich won't hear Stanford cheer for him
## 
### 
While it hasn't been publicly
announced, word is out that
superstar prep quarterback
Todd Marinovich has already
verbally committed to USC and
will sign a letter of intent.

Marinovich is delaying the
official announcement until a
Sports Illustrated writer who
is doing a story on football
recruiting joins him.
Marinovich holds the na
tional high school career pass
ing yardage record and had
been the object of a heated
recruiting battle that saw Stan
ford go down to the wire with
USC, ahead of Miami (Fla.) and
UCLA. His father was said to
have favored Stanford, but his
mother, with whom he lives,
has several relatives at USC,
including Asst. Athletic Direc
tor Craig Fertig.
While Marinovich'B decision
nullifies several years of Stan
ford recruiting efforts, the Car
dinal is still expected to sign
one or two top quarterback
prospects. The Times Tribune
reported that quarterback
Steve Smith from Folsom, La.,
has already committed to Stan
ford, and several other quar
terbacks have been accepted.
On the basketball front, the
news is obviously much better.
The Cardinal is winning, and
the fans are getting enthusias
tic, yet I'm still not used to
the idea of Stanford cheer
leaders.
I tried to defend them, and
I still admire their initiative
and gumption, but I'm not sure
the cheerleaders belong at
Stanford games.
Stanford's cheerleaders have
proven to be a third wheel at
athletic events, and that was
nowhere more apparent than
at Thursday night's upset win
over Arizona.
Maples Pavilion was sold out,
strictly standing room only,
and the crowd whipped itself
into an almost Big-Tenish
frenzy. However, the Maples
noise level reached DC-10 pro

portions almost in spite of the
cheerleaders.
Several times the cheer
leaders would take the floor
during a break in the action
while the crowd, particularly
the students, were on their feet
and cheering. The cheerleaders
would then launch into one of
their cute but unspectacular
tricks or give a verbal cheer
that was all but inaudible
beyond the third row, and
everyone would settle back into
their seats.
The cheerleaders would then
leave the floor to a few tepid,
halfhearted, polite cheers, and
it would be up to Todd Lichti
and Co. to get the crowd back
into the game.
The cheerleaders were more
like cheersquelchers.
Why does Stanford need
cheerleaders anyway? Some
how it seems somewhat insult
ing to the Stanford intellect
that we need people to teach
us how and what to cheer.
Stanford people are not sheep
or lemmings. Granted, some
times Stanford students could
be more vocal, but generally
fine play is rewarded with the
appropriate cheers.
The Dollies make no preten
sions about being cheerleaders.
They are a dancing group. They
work with the Band to enter
tain the crowd, and they do it
well.
Lest I seem too harsh on the
cheerleaders, I must reiterate
my respect for their trailblaz
ing action and the guts it took
to do it. It required a lot of
bravery for the cheerleaders to
stand in front of 86,000 fans
at Big Game in their initial
performance. No one knew how
the crowd would react. The
cheerleaders could have been
booed off the field, yet they
took that chance and went
ahead with their plan to make
Big Game their first public ap
pearance.
They've also undoubtedly
put a lot of hard work into
creating a cheerleading squad
from scratch.
The cheerleaders should
finish out the season and then
think seriously about whether
or not they want to continue
next year. On some fronts their
effort has been successful, but
the crowd doesn't seem to be
getting behind them. And isn't
that what being a cheerleader
is all about?
