# South Africa education programs to be expanded
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
The University will, in the next two
years, expand its educational programs to
aid black South Africans, officials said yes
terday.
The new initaitives, announced by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Rosse, will cost $180,000
over the next two years. Three committees
will be charged with overseeing programs
designed to train black South African pro
fessionals, to develop new courses and re
search projects, and to educate the Stanford
community about South Africa.
"If we can help supply to South Africans,
particularly black South Africans, the in
tellectual resources necessary to build a
new society, then we will have generated
perhaps the greatest legacy it is within our
power to create — a legacy of knowledge,
talent and hope," said Kennedy and Rosse
in a joint statement.
But senior Stacey Leyton of Stanford
Out of South Africa downplayed the sig
nificance of the announcement. The pro
grams "are great, but basically the reason
we need Ithe programs] is because of apar
theid," she said. University officials are
trying to "direct attention away from Stan
ford's investment policies."
According to Rosse, the University's in
vestments in South Africa and the new
intiatives are "quite unrelated. Disinvest-
has to do with investments," he said,

while these initiatives are "kinds of edu
cational programs. ... It is an issue of how
we can make a contribution ... by
[providing] better information about South
Africa."
The programs were initially proposed by
the Commission on Investment Responsi
bility last June. Linda Yates, student rep
resentative on the CIR, said the "goal of
the commission was to move away from
disinvestment as the only issue." She said
the commission was concerned with engag
ing in more "pro-active" measures to help
black South Africans.
The University's program has three com
ponents — one of which, the Committee
on Educational Initiatives for Black South
Africans, is already in existence.
That committee has so far brought three
mid-career professionals to campus for six
to nine months of study, and is presently
recruiting black South African students to
attend Stanford.
Political Science Prof. Richard Brody,
who heads the committee, said it will con
tinue to bring mid-career professionals to
study at Stanford as well as provide for
"focused workshops" for black South
Africans. The committee will receive
$50,000 a year for the next two years from
the University.
The other two committees will each
receive $20 000 per year. One committee
will be headed by Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy and will develop
proposals for new courses, do re
search and recruit faculty with
expertise in Southern Africa.
The other committee will be
headed by Assoc. History Prof.
Kennell Jackson and will sponsor
projects such as residential semi
nars to educate the Stanford com
munity about South Africa.
Business School Prof. James

Patell will head an executive com
mittee to oversee the three
seperate committees. Patell said
the three committees "may not
all end up with the same life
span." He said the University has
expressed a "firm committment"
to fund the projects for two years
but "has not said 'yes' or 'no' "
to fund beyond that time.
After two years, the executive
committee will review each
seperate program to determine
whether the University should
continue to fund it.
