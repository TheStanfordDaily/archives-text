# Men's tennis politely romps

### Cameron Macky Staff writer 
In what could only
politely be called a
blowout, the Stan
ford men's tennis
team got its home
schedule off to a
flying start yester-

day by cruising past an unranked
and outmatched Hawaii team at
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The top-ranked Cardinal, now
4-0 on the season, walloped the
Rainbows by a score of 8-1, drop
ping only two sets along the way.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould
downplayed the severity of the
score, however. "Obviously,
they're not a great team," Gould
said, "but this was a good chance
to show off some of our depth."

'Playing No. 1 was
really no big deal. 1

Martin Blackman

Even without regulars Jeff
Tnrango and Patrick McEnroe,
who wcr? resting, the Cardinal
ended the match almost before it
had started, putting Hawaii away
early by sweeping to two-set vic
tories in all six singles matches.
Freshman Martin Blackman led
the attack for Stanford, racing by
Hawaii's Peter Cannon 6-2, 6-2
at No. 1 singles. Blackman,
playing at the No. 1 spot for the
first time, broke Cannon's serve
early in each set and never looked
back, running his season record
to 4-0 in the process.
The freshman downplayed the
pressure of playing in the top spot
for the first time.
"Playing No. 1 was really no
big deal. I was more nervous be
cause it was our first home
match," Blackman said. "I started
out tight, and I never really
loosened up. Overall, I don't think
I played very well, but I played
well when I had to."

Coach Gould agreed, while
pointing out that Blackman's best
performances are still down the
road.
"Martin was a little tight today,
but that's probably because it was
his first home match," Gould said.
"He's got a lot of talent. He's just

going to improve so much in the
time ahead."
At No. 2 singles, sophomore Jeff
Cathrall downed Steve Casey 6-2,
6-1 to up his perfect log to 4-0.

a win at No. 1 doubles.
