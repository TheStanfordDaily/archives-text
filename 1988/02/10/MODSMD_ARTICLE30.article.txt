# Men's tennis politely romps
## 
### Cameron Macky Staff writer 
In what could only
politely be called a
blowout, the Stan
ford men's tennis
team got its home
schedule off to a
flying start yester-

day by cruising past an unranked
and outmatched Hawaii team at
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The top-ranked Cardinal, now
4-0 on the season, walloped the
Rainbows by a score of 8-1, drop
ping only two sets along the way.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould
downplayed the severity of the
score, however. "Obviously,
they're not a great team," Gould
said, "but this was a good chance
to show off some of our depth."

'Playing No. 1 was
really no big deal. 1

Martin Blackman

Even without regulars Jeff
Tnrango and Patrick McEnroe,
who wcr? resting, the Cardinal
ended the match almost before it
had started, putting Hawaii away
early by sweeping to two-set vic
tories in all six singles matches.
Freshman Martin Blackman led
the attack for Stanford, racing by
Hawaii's Peter Cannon 6-2, 6-2
at No. 1 singles. Blackman,
playing at the No. 1 spot for the
first time, broke Cannon's serve
early in each set and never looked
back, running his season record
to 4-0 in the process.
The freshman downplayed the
pressure of playing in the top spot
for the first time.
"Playing No. 1 was really no
big deal. I was more nervous be
cause it was our first home
match," Blackman said. "I started
out tight, and I never really
loosened up. Overall, I don't think
I played very well, but I played
well when I had to."

Coach Gould agreed, while
pointing out that Blackman's best
performances are still down the
road.
"Martin was a little tight today,
but that's probably because it was
his first home match," Gould said.
"He's got a lot of talent. He's just

going to improve so much in the
time ahead."
At No. 2 singles, sophomore Jeff
Cathrall downed Steve Casey 6-2,
6-1 to up his perfect log to 4-0.
Freshman Glenn Solomon, also 4-



Ken Beer — Dally
Dan Turbow came in unexpectedly to team up with Glenn Solomon for
a win at No. 1 doubles.
0 after his 6-3, 6-2 win over Jim
Murray, echoed Blackman's com
ments on the pressure of moving
up from the fifth spot to No. 3.
"I felt the same pressure I
would have felt playing at four or
five," Solomon said. "You always
feel the same amount of pressure
because you want the team to do
well."
Barry Richards, a sophomore
playing at the No. 4 spot, won
the closest singles match of the
day by defeating Yuri Sohn 6-4,
7-5. Junior Curtis Dunn joined
the parade with a 6-3, 6-0 victory
against Mike Doerr at No. 5, while
sophomore Eric Peus rounded out
the singles whitewash with a 6-3,
6-4 win over Lawrence Lowe.
With the win already clinched,
Gould juggled his doubles lineup,
pulling his first team of Cathrall
and Peus in favor of Solomon and
freshman Dan Turbow. After
flying to a 6-1 win in the first
set, the pair found themselves
down a break at 1-4 to Hawaii's
Cannon and Casey, but broke
right back and eventually won 6-
1, 7-5.
Dunn and Richards teamed up
to take the second doubles match
6-4, 6-1 over Murray and Doerr,
but the final Stanford doubles
team of sophomores Jon Kahn
and John Connolly dropped a
hard-fought 5-7, 7-5, 6-2 match
to Sohn and Lowe.
Gould was quite pleased with
his team's performance, even
against inferior competition.
"It was nice to see some of the
guys down the lino get to play,
and for the most part, do well."
