## Stanford two-hits Pacific, 4-1 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
STOCKTON -
Stanford pitching
coach Tom Dunton
had a big grin on
his face after the
Cardinal's 4-1 win
over Pacific at

Billy Hebert Field yesterday.
"That's my kind of game," he
said.
Dunton had every right to be
happy. Three of the guns in his
arsenal all fired very well against
the Tigers.
Sophomore Mark Carper,
making his first collegiate start,
went four innings and gave up
only two hits. Freshman Stan
Spencer, making his first col
legiate relief appearance after
starting two games last week,
went four innings and retired all
11 batters he faced (one of the
runners he inherited from Carper
was caught stealing for the 12th
out of the four innings). And
junior fireman Steve Chitren took
over in the ninth and struck out
the side.
Final line score for the Tigers:
one unearned run on two hits and
one Cardinal error.
The win improves Stanford's
record to 4-3 going into a big
three-game series at Hawaii this
weekend. The Tigers, members of
the Pacific Coast Athletic Associ
ation, remain winless in five
games.
The pitching performance
wasn't the only encouraging thing
about the Cardinal's performance.
The defense was excellent and the
Stanford batsmen got 10 hits,
though they were stymied by four
Tiger double plays.
"We hit the ball as well as we
have all year," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "If we
hadn't had so many double plays,
we'd have scored a lot of runs."
Stanford's scoring began right
away. Leadoff batter Mike Eicher
drew a walk, went to second on
a single by Troy Paulsen, moved
to third on a passed ball and came
home on a sharp single into center
by Ron Witmeyer. After a double
steal, Paul Carey brought Paulsen
and Witmeyer in with a single up
the middle.
Carper, working with a 3-0 lead,
cruised through three innings,
then got in a bit of trouble in the
fourth. JefT Jones led off the in
ning with a walk, Robert Flippo
followed with a single, and after
shortstop Paulsen bobbled a
grounder from Deryk Gross, the
bases were loaded with no outs.
But the Cardinal turned a double

play in its own favor to get out
of the inning with only one run
of damage done.
Carper walked the first two bat
ters in the fifth and gave way to
Spencer.
"I felt pretty bad today," Carper
said. "I started getting tired be
cause I'm pretty sick."
But the fact that Carper is
pitching at all is a pleasant
surprise for the Cardinal. The big
sophomore, who threw only 25
1/3 innings last season, under
went surgery last July to repair
ligament and cartilage damage in
his left knee. He originally wasn't
expected to pitch until March at
the earliest.
"What I was shooting for was
to be ready for the Pac (Pac 10
Southern Divsion play beginning
Feb. 26)," Carper said.
But already he has thrown 11
2/3 innings in three appearances
this season, and looks stronger
every time out.
"I'm just happy to be out
there," he said. "But I've still got
a little ways to go. If I just get
some more innings, that will help
a lot."
Spencer, a freshman from Van
couver, Wash., also continues to
improve. He was especially sharp
yesterday, as he threw more than
four pitches to only two batters,
struck out four and walked none.
He recorded the win to improve
his record to 2-1.
"I felt like I had my good
fastball today," Spencer said.
"That was as good as it's been
(at Stanford)."
Spencer said yesterday's outing
was the first time he had pitched
in relief since he played in Babe
Ruth league.
"It didn't really feel any differ
ent (from starting)," he said. "You
pitch the same no matter what."
Nursing a 3-1 lead, Spencer
received a little more support in
the sixth. With one out, desig
nated hitter Jeff Saenger, not
known for his fleetness afoot,
lined one into the right-center
hole and turned on the
afterburners for a triple.
"Well, you saw the way their
outfield was playing in,"he said.
"It was only a matter of time
(before someone hit a triple). I
had a triple last year, so it's noth
ing new . .. it's been seen before."
Brian Johnson scored Saenger
with a long double off the left-field
fence to make the score 4-1.
Tiger reliever Brent Sackett
shut down the Cardinal through
the last three innings. But Pacific
couldn't get anything started of
fensively against Spencer, and
Chitren mowed down the middle

three batters in the Tiger batting
order in the ninth to wrap up the
game.
The combination of good pitch
ing performances and a consistent
offensive attack in yesterday's
game bodes well for this
weekend's series at Hawaii.
"The bats are starting to im
prove, and the pitching is doing
pretty well now, too, although it's
not as good as it could be," Carper
said.
Card notes
Stanford turned one double play to
the Tigers' four. For the season, the
Cardinal has turned four double plays

to its opponents' nine. All four of the
Tigers' double plays began with either
the second baseman or shortstop.
That may be a result of an increased
emphasis by Stanford on hitting the
ball up the middle, or "up the gut,"
as Marquess says.
"Early on (in the season), there was
too much emphasis on hitting the ball
hard," Saenger said, "and you end up
pulling the ball to first or third. Now
we're concentrating more on base hits
than home runs — trying to hit the
ball up the middle . . . we're hitting
more balls to the middle pie."
Indeed: of the Cardinal's 10 hits
yesterday, six were to center field or
up the middle.

ball up the middle, or "up the gut,"
as Marquess says.
"Early on (in the season), there was
too much emphasis on hitting the ball
hard," Saenger said, "and you end up
pulling the ball to first or third. Now
we're concentrating more on base hits
than home runs — trying to hit the
ball up the middle . . . we're hitting
more balls to the middle pie."
Indeed: of the Cardinal's 10 hits
yesterday, six were to center field or
up the middle.

STOCKTON -
Stanford pitching
coach Tom Dunton
had a big grin on
his face after the
Cardinal's 4-1 win
over Pacific at

Billy Hebert Field yesterday.
"That's my kind of game," he
said.
Dunton had every right to be
happy. Three of the guns in his
arsenal all fired very well against
the Tigers.
Sophomore Mark Carper,
making his first collegiate start,
went four innings and gave up
only two hits. Freshman Stan
Spencer, making his first col
legiate relief appearance after
starting two games last week,
went four innings and retired all
11 batters he faced (one of the
runners he inherited from Carper
was caught stealing for the 12th
out of the four innings). And
junior fireman Steve Chitren took
over in the ninth and struck out
the side.
Final line score for the Tigers:
one unearned run on two hits and
one Cardinal error.
The win improves Stanford's
record to 4-3 going into a big
three-game series at Hawaii this
weekend. The Tigers, members of
the Pacific Coast Athletic Associ
ation, remain winless in five
games.
The pitching performance
wasn't the only encouraging thing
about the Cardinal's performance.
The defense was excellent and the
Stanford batsmen got 10 hits,
though they were stymied by four
Tiger double plays.
"We hit the ball as well as we
have all year," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "If we
hadn't had so many double plays,
we'd have scored a lot of runs."
Stanford's scoring began right
away. Leadoff batter Mike Eicher
drew a walk, went to second on
a single by Troy Paulsen, moved
to third on a passed ball and came
home on a sharp single into center
by Ron Witmeyer. After a double
steal, Paul Carey brought Paulsen
and Witmeyer in with a single up
the middle.
Carper, working with a 3-0 lead,
cruised through three innings,
then got in a bit of trouble in the
fourth. JefT Jones led off the in
ning with a walk, Robert Flippo
followed with a single, and after
shortstop Paulsen bobbled a
grounder from Deryk Gross, the
bases were loaded with no outs.
But the Cardinal turned a double

play in its own favor to get out
of the inning with only one run
of damage done.
Carper walked the first two bat
ters in the fifth and gave way to
Spencer.
"I felt pretty bad today," Carper
said. "I started getting tired be
cause I'm pretty sick."
But the fact that Carper is
pitching at all is a pleasant
surprise for the Cardinal. The big
sophomore, who threw only 25
1/3 innings last season, under
went surgery last July to repair
ligament and cartilage damage in
his left knee. He originally wasn't
expected to pitch until March at
the earliest.
"What I was shooting for was
to be ready for the Pac (Pac 10
Southern Divsion play beginning
Feb. 26)," Carper said.
But already he has thrown 11
2/3 innings in three appearances
this season, and looks stronger
every time out.
"I'm just happy to be out
there," he said. "But I've still got
a little ways to go. If I just get
some more innings, that will help
a lot."
Spencer, a freshman from Van
couver, Wash., also continues to
improve. He was especially sharp
yesterday, as he threw more than
four pitches to only two batters,
struck out four and walked none.
He recorded the win to improve
his record to 2-1.
"I felt like I had my good
fastball today," Spencer said.
"That was as good as it's been
(at Stanford)."
Spencer said yesterday's outing
was the first time he had pitched
in relief since he played in Babe
Ruth league.
"It didn't really feel any differ
ent (from starting)," he said. "You
pitch the same no matter what."
Nursing a 3-1 lead, Spencer
received a little more support in
the sixth. With one out, desig
nated hitter Jeff Saenger, not
known for his fleetness afoot,
lined one into the right-center
hole and turned on the
afterburners for a triple.
"Well, you saw the way their
outfield was playing in,"he said.
"It was only a matter of time
(before someone hit a triple). I
had a triple last year, so it's noth
ing new . .. it's been seen before."
Brian Johnson scored Saenger
with a long double off the left-field
fence to make the score 4-1.
Tiger reliever Brent Sackett
shut down the Cardinal through
the last three innings. But Pacific
couldn't get anything started of
fensively against Spencer, and
Chitren mowed down the middle

three batters in the Tiger batting
order in the ninth to wrap up the
game.
The combination of good pitch
ing performances and a consistent
offensive attack in yesterday's
game bodes well for this
weekend's series at Hawaii.
"The bats are starting to im
prove, and the pitching is doing
pretty well now, too, although it's
not as good as it could be," Carper
said.
Card notes
Stanford turned one double play to
the Tigers' four. For the season, the
Cardinal has turned four double plays

to its opponents' nine. All four of the
Tigers' double plays began with either
the second baseman or shortstop.
That may be a result of an increased
emphasis by Stanford on hitting the
ball up the middle, or "up the gut,"
as Marquess says.
"Early on (in the season), there was
too much emphasis on hitting the ball
hard," Saenger said, "and you end up
pulling the ball to first or third. Now
