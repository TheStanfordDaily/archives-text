# Women sweep past Hawaii
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
The action in the
Stanford Tennis
Stadium yester
day afternoon
seemed more like
a 50-yard dash
than a dual

match. Enjoying the pleasant
weather, the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team raced off
to an easy 9-0 win over un
ranked Hawaii yesterday with
out even dropping a set.
"I don't think we've ever won
a match this easily before,"
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "I was a little embarrassed,
because I thought they'd be a
little bit better.
"With only nine members on
our team, it's a little bit difficult
to water down our line-up. This
is basically our number-one
lineup we had to go with today

because of injuries. You don't
want to beat anyone this easily,
because it wasn't that com
petitive."
The sprint began with fresh
man Teri Whitlinger's
whirlwind win over Lori Okuda
at the No. 4 spot. Just 41
minutes after the pair began
warmups, Whitlinger dashed off
a 6-0, 6-1 victory to put Stanford
ahead 1-0.
Fellow freshman Sandra
Birch was quick to follow, easily
defeating Natalie Mackintosh 6-
0, 6-1 at No. 3.
"I think I played pretty well,"
Birch said. "She was a little bit
inconsistent. . . . and I kept
working on shots. The coach
wanted us to work on things
we were working on in practice."
Sophomore Valerie Wilson
also enjoyed a relatively pain
free match, garnering an easy
6-1, 6-0 win at the No. 5 position
against Helena Mansson.

Quickly after, sophomore Lisa
Green upped the Cardinal's
team score to 4-0 by besting
Mina Hall in the No. 2 contest.
Green, who made it to the semi
finals of the NCAA Champion
ships last spring, bested
Hawaii's second-best by a 6-0,
6-1 margin.

cult to water down

"I played really well," Green
said. "I was more consistent
than I was last week. She was
a good player, but she made a

lot of errors."
Two matches remained un
decided after Green's win, but not
for long. Senior Cari Hagey, out
fitted with a overbearing knee
brace, was unhampered by the ap
paratus and defeated Elizabeth
Rocha 6-1, 6-1 in the No. 6 spot
to secure the Cardinal win.
Tami Whitlinger's victory at the
No. 1 spot made the singles a
Stanford sweep. Hawaii's Karen
Felicilda gave the sophomore a
challenge with her speed, but
proved no match for Whitlinger
and fell 6-1, 6-2.
Enjoying a 6-0 advantage, Stan
ford confidently raced into
doubles. In the most exciting
match of the day, the animated
team of Whitlinger and
Whitlinger easily oustered
Felicilda-Bordeaux 6-1, 6-0.
Hagey and Birch followed with
a 6-1, 6-1 victory over
Mackintosh-Hall in the No. 2 spot,

and lobs with Birch's skilled
shots.
All eyes shifted to the doubles
duel in the No. 3 match-up. Green
and senior Kay Tittle had little
problem taking the first set off of
Mansson-Rocha 6-1, but were
hard pressed to put the Hawaiian
pair away. However, after both
sides repeatedly exchanged
games, the Cardinal duo prevailed
7-5 to make the match a Stanford
shut-out.
"One of your challenges on a
day like this is to concentrate
really well and try to go through
your match not a sloppy 6-3, 6-3
but a smooth 6-0, 6-1 and get off
the court as fast as you can, which
I think most of our players did,"
Brennan said. "I had them ready
for a pretty tough match and they
weren't that tough, so we conse
quently blew them away."
The next two matches for the
Cardinal will be at home. Friday,
Stanford hosts San Diego State
at 1:30 p.m., and Tuesday it's op
ponent will be San Jose State.

out even dropping a set.
"I don't think we've ever won
a match this easily before,"
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "I was a little embarrassed,
because I thought they'd be a
little bit better.
"With only nine members on
our team, it's a little bit difficult
to water down our line-up. This
is basically our number-one
lineup we had to go with today

because of injuries. You don't
want to beat anyone this easily,
because it wasn't that com
petitive."
The sprint began with fresh
man Teri Whitlinger's
whirlwind win over Lori Okuda
at the No. 4 spot. Just 41
minutes after the pair began
warmups, Whitlinger dashed off
a 6-0, 6-1 victory to put Stanford
ahead 1-0.
Fellow freshman Sandra
Birch was quick to follow, easily
defeating Natalie Mackintosh 6-
0, 6-1 at No. 3.
"I think I played pretty well,"
Birch said. "She was a little bit
inconsistent. . . . and I kept
working on shots. The coach
wanted us to work on things
we were working on in practice."
Sophomore Valerie Wilson
also enjoyed a relatively pain
free match, garnering an easy
6-1, 6-0 win at the No. 5 position
against Helena Mansson.

Quickly after, sophomore Lisa
Green upped the Cardinal's
team score to 4-0 by besting
Mina Hall in the No. 2 contest.
Green, who made it to the semi
finals of the NCAA Champion
ships last spring, bested
Hawaii's second-best by a 6-0,
6-1 margin.

'With only nine
members on our
team, it's a bit diffi
cult to water down
our lineup.'
— Frank Brennan

"I played really well," Green
said. "I was more consistent
than I was last week. She was
a good player, but she made a

lot of errors."
Two matches remained un
decided after Green's win, but not
for long. Senior Cari Hagey, out
fitted with a overbearing knee
brace, was unhampered by the ap
paratus and defeated Elizabeth
Rocha 6-1, 6-1 in the No. 6 spot
to secure the Cardinal win.
Tami Whitlinger's victory at the
No. 1 spot made the singles a
Stanford sweep. Hawaii's Karen
Felicilda gave the sophomore a
challenge with her speed, but
proved no match for Whitlinger
and fell 6-1, 6-2.
Enjoying a 6-0 advantage, Stan
ford confidently raced into
doubles. In the most exciting
match of the day, the animated
team of Whitlinger and
Whitlinger easily oustered
Felicilda-Bordeaux 6-1, 6-0.
Hagey and Birch followed with
a 6-1, 6-1 victory over
Mackintosh-Hall in the No. 2 spot,

and lobs with Birch's skilled
shots.
All eyes shifted to the doubles
duel in the No. 3 match-up. Green
and senior Kay Tittle had little
problem taking the first set off of
Mansson-Rocha 6-1, but were
hard pressed to put the Hawaiian
pair away. However, after both
sides repeatedly exchanged
games, the Cardinal duo prevailed
7-5 to make the match a Stanford
shut-out.
"One of your challenges on a
day like this is to concentrate
really well and try to go through
your match not a sloppy 6-3, 6-3
but a smooth 6-0, 6-1 and get off
the court as fast as you can, which
I think most of our players did,"
Brennan said. "I had them ready
for a pretty tough match and they
weren't that tough, so we conse
quently blew them away."
The next two matches for the
Cardinal will be at home. Friday,
Stanford hosts San Diego State
at 1:30 p.m., and Tuesday it's op
ponent will be San Jose State.
