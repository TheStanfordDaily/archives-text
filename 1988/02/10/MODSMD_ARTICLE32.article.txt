# Women sweep past Hawaii
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
The action in the
Stanford Tennis
Stadium yester
day afternoon
seemed more like
a 50-yard dash
than a dual

match. Enjoying the pleasant
weather, the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team raced off
to an easy 9-0 win over un
ranked Hawaii yesterday with
out even dropping a set.
"I don't think we've ever won
a match this easily before,"
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "I was a little embarrassed,
because I thought they'd be a
little bit better.
"With only nine members on
our team, it's a little bit difficult
to water down our line-up. This
is basically our number-one
lineup we had to go with today

because of injuries. You don't
want to beat anyone this easily,
because it wasn't that com

The sprint began with fresh
man Teri Whitlinger's
whirlwind win over Lori Okuda
at the No. 4 spot. Just 41
minutes after the pair began
warmups, Whitlinger dashed off
a 6-0, 6-1 victory to put Stanford
ahead 1-0.
Fellow freshman Sandra
Birch was quick to follow, easily
defeating Natalie Mackintosh 6-
0, 6-1 at No. 3.
"I think I played pretty well,"
Birch said. "She was a little bit
inconsistent. . . . and I kept
working on shots. The coach
wanted us to work on things
we were working on in practice."
Sophomore Valerie Wilson
also enjoyed a relatively pain
free match, garnering an easy
6-1, 6-0 win at the No. 5 position
against Helena Mansson.

Quickly after, sophomore Lisa
Green upped the Cardinal's
team score to 4-0 by besting
Mina Hall in the No. 2 contest.
Green, who made it to the semi
finals of the NCAA Champion
ships last spring, bested
Hawaii's second-best by a 6-0,
6-1 margin.

'With only nine
members on our
team, it's a bit diffi
cult to water down
our lineup.'

"I played really well," Green
said. "I was more consistent
than I was last week. She was
a good player, but she made a
