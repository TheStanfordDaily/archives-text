Tuesday saw the end of a long
drought for the Stanford men's golf
team.
The Cardinal captured its first out
right tournament victory in two
years, the UC-Davis Invitational in
Napa, with a team score of 1,143 for

54 holes. Stanislaus State roared back into conten

Another sophomore, Mike Hubly, was second for
the team with a final round 76 and total of 230.

Roger Miraglia, who carded a blistering 73 (233),
and sophomore Josh Zander, who fired a 78 (238).
Hubly, however, carried over his surprisingly good
performance from the last tournament. He had not

Miraglia, and fired an unexpected 75 in the final
