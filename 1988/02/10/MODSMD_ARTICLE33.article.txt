# Golf wins first in two years
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
Tuesday saw the end of a long
drought for the Stanford men's golf
team.
The Cardinal captured its first out
right tournament victory in two
years, the UC-Davis Invitational in
Napa, with a team score of 1,143 for

54 holes. Stanislaus State roared back into conten
tion but fell short at 1,146.
They were followed by Cal State-Northridge at
1147, UC-Davis with 1,155 and Sacramento State,
which lagged behind the field at 1,199.
Since he went into the tournament looking for a
win, Wally Goodwin was not surprised at the team's
performance. In addition, he was very pleased at
the promise this victory holds for the future.
"The guys looked relaxed; they were con
centrating," Goodwin said. "They did a great job
of hanging in there for the win today," he said,
adding that the team has come a long way in terms
of competitiveness since the beginning of the season
in September.

Sophomore Mark Funseth continued his fine per
formance, firing a 75 to win the tournament overall
with a three-round total of 222.
Funseth is no stranger to the medalist spot, but
he had an advantage in the tournament, since it
was played in his own backyard.
"Mark had local course knowledge," Goodwin said,
"so he should have been a medalist. I would have
been disappointed if he hadn't won the tour
nament."
Another sophomore, Mike Hubly, was second for
the team with a final round 76 and total of 230.
He was followed by junior John Mahon with 75
(232), sophomore Brad Joondeph at 75 (232), junior
Roger Miraglia, who carded a blistering 73 (233),
and sophomore Josh Zander, who fired a 78 (238).
Hubly, however, carried over his surprisingly good
performance from the last tournament. He had not
even qualified for the tournament in Santa Rarbara.
but was inserted as a last-minute replacement for
Miraglia, and fired an unexpected 75 in the final
round of that contest.
"He deserves a lot of credit because he has worked

hurdei than anybody," Goodwin
said.
Goodwin did a good deal to help
out his players in Tuesday's
round. Because they played the
Kennedy Golf Course without a
practice round, the golfers were
not able to trace out yardages on
the holes. Goodwin alleviated this
problem for them somewhat by
pacing out the back nine while

his players were on the first nine
holes.
Coach Goodwin thinks the team
is "making gradual progress"
toward the NCAA championships
in late May. At their next tour
nament in Hawaii at the end of
the month, the Cardinal will face
a little more of a challenge from
a larger and more diverse field of
Division I teams. If their perform
ance this week is any indication
of what the golfers are capable of
doing, Cardinal golf fans have a
lot to look forward to in the com
ing months.
