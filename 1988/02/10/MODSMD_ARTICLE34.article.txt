# NCAA fever strikes Cardinal swimmers early
## Murphy eyes '88 Seoul bid 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
In the pool, three-tenths of a
second can mean the difference
between sinking or victory.
For Cardinal backstroker Sean
Murphy, it meant watching the
1984 Summer Olympics on tele
vision from his hometown of
Toronto.
But the near-misses in the 100-
and 200-meter back the summer
before his arrival at Stanford were
to be some of the last for Murphy.
During the past three years,
Murphy has been one of the Car
dinal's most consistent scorers,
winning three NCAA gold medals
and seven All-America titles,
while also contributing to Stan
ford's three national champion
ship crowns.
And the senior tri-captain is
well on his way to garnering yet
another national victory in the
200-yard back. Less than halfway
through the season, Murphy has
already posted NCAA qualifying
times in both the 100- and 200-
back events, swimming 1.48.94 in
the 200 and in 50.12 the 100
against Arizona State Jan. 23.
But Murphy almost did not
make it to competing on the col
legiate and international levels.
Having begun swimming at age
six, he excelled in age group com
petition while in grammar school
and really enjoyed competing. But
as a teenager Murphy was slow
to mature, and found it difficult
to keep up with his larger,
stronger opponents.
"When I turned 15 I seriously
thought about quitting because
the others were bigger and faster,
and I got discouraged," Murphy
said.
Luckily for Stanford he decided
to keep at it, and neither he nor
the swim team has regretted the
decision. For as soon as he caught
up with the others in physique
and started to drown the compe
tition, Murphy says he "became
hooked."
While still in high school, he
not only qualified for the
Canadian National team, but also
began an impressive portfolio of
strong performances in interna
tional meets, with a first in the
200 back at the 1983 Pan Pacific
Games.
"At this point I had decided to
definitely continue swimming
after high school in a university,"
Murphy said, "but I never even
thought about going to the U.S.
until my senior year in high
school, when a coach suggested I
take a look at schools for both
swimming and academics."
The internationally renowned
swimmer "loved Stanford at first
sight," and fit in at first sight as
well. During his freshman year,
Murphy won the 200 back at the
NCAA Championships, and
reached the finals in the 100 back,
greatly aiding Stanford's team vic
tory effort.
"Going to NCAA's and winning
my first year was fantastic," he
said. "In terms of excitement,

competing in the national cham
pionships has to be comparable
to swimming in the Olympics."
Murphy's sophomore year was
even more of a success story. He
not only repeated as NCAA 200-
back champion, but placed fourth
in the 100 back and swam a leg
on the victorious medley relay
team at the finals as well. Mean
while, the Cardinal was going un
defeated in its dual-meet season
on the way to its second consecu
tive NCAA championship.
"As far as swimming goes, my
sophomore year was even more
exciting than my freshman,"
Murphy said. "It was a great
season."
Murphy is not super-human,
however, and his vulnerability
appeared last year. Stricken with
what turned out to be a sinus
infection, he was unable to swim
dual-meet times equal to those of
the previous two seasons. Al
though he was victorious in the
200 at the Pacific-10 Champion
ship meet, he was unable to win
a third straight 200-back title, set
tling for a fourth in the 200 and
an eighth in the 100. Yet he still
contributed to the Cardinal's
third consecutive national title.
"The competition got heavier
and I was sick," Murphy said. "It
was defintely disappointing, but
winning the NCAA's as a team
lessened the pain."
What stands out in Murphy's
mind, however, is not the national
victories or losing his title, but
swimming with the team. "Swim
ming at home was more in
dividual," he said. "I really picked
up a whole new view of swimming
at Stanford. It's really nice to be
able to share a winning tradition
with a team."
The Cardinal has been glad that
Murphy has wanted to share the
winning tradition. But in addition

to his race performances, Mur
phy's coaches and teammates
value him for his dedication, will
ingness to work hard and upbeat
attitude.
"He's a coach's dream. He was
born ready to work hard," Coach
Skip Kenney said. "He feels
working hard is the way to get
ahead, and his combination of
natural talent and great work eth
ics make him a great swimmer."
"Sean's probably the hardest
worker on the team. He's a great
workout swimmer and is always
training hard," fellow backstroker
Rick Gould said.
In addition, Murphy has had to
fill the fins of All-Everything
swimmers Pablo Morales and Jeff
Kostoff as captain and spiritual
leader of the squad.
"He's someone to look up to,
and has been really helpful in
keeping up the team's attitude
during our losses this year," said
Gould. "When I came here one of
the things I looked forward to
was working with Sean. He's al
ways willing to take time out after
practice to help any of us with
starts or strokes. He's just a great
all-around guy."
The Canadian is not yet
satisfied with his American ac
complishments. Recapturing the
200 title at NCAA's still awaits
him. Although Murphy faces the
same field as last season, the back
stroker feels he not only has the
ability to be victorious, but to
break his persnal best of 1.45.9
and possibly even the American
record of 1.44.4.
He is also counting on being in
Seoul, South Korea in September.
After the NCAA Championships,
he will return to Toronto to train
for the Summer Olympics.
Los Angeles eluded Murphy,
but he does not plan on letting
the Orient get away.

"He's someone to look up to,

keeping up the team's attitude
during our losses this year," said
Gould. "When I came here one of
the things I looked forward to
was working with Sean. He's al
ways willing to take time out after
practice to help any of us with
starts or strokes. He's just a great
all-around guy."
The Canadian is not yet
satisfied with his American ac
complishments. Recapturing the
200 title at NCAA's still awaits
him. Although Murphy faces the
same field as last season, the back
stroker feels he not only has the
ability to be victorious, but to
break his persnal best of 1.45.9
and possibly even the American
record of 1.44.4.
He is also counting on being in
Seoul, South Korea in September.
After the NCAA Championships,
he will return to Toronto to train
for the Summer Olympics.

Canadian native Sean Murphy has already qualified for the NCAA
Championships.
In the pool, three-tenths of a
second can mean the difference
between sinking or victory.
For Cardinal backstroker Sean
Murphy, it meant watching the
1984 Summer Olympics on tele
vision from his hometown of
Toronto.
But the near-misses in the 100-
and 200-meter back the summer
before his arrival at Stanford were
to be some of the last for Murphy.
During the past three years,
Murphy has been one of the Car
dinal's most consistent scorers,
winning three NCAA gold medals
and seven All-America titles,
while also contributing to Stan
ford's three national champion
ship crowns.
And the senior tri-captain is
well on his way to garnering yet
another national victory in the
200-yard back. Less than halfway
through the season, Murphy has
already posted NCAA qualifying
times in both the 100- and 200-
back events, swimming 1.48.94 in
the 200 and in 50.12 the 100
against Arizona State Jan. 23.
But Murphy almost did not
make it to competing on the col
legiate and international levels.
Having begun swimming at age
six, he excelled in age group com
petition while in grammar school
and really enjoyed competing. But
as a teenager Murphy was slow
to mature, and found it difficult
to keep up with his larger,
stronger opponents.
"When I turned 15 I seriously
thought about quitting because
the others were bigger and faster,
and I got discouraged," Murphy
said.
Luckily for Stanford he decided
to keep at it, and neither he nor
the swim team has regretted the
decision. For as soon as he caught
up with the others in physique
and started to drown the compe
tition, Murphy says he "became
hooked."
While still in high school, he
not only qualified for the
Canadian National team, but also
began an impressive portfolio of
strong performances in interna
tional meets, with a first in the
200 back at the 1983 Pan Pacific
Games.
"At this point I had decided to
definitely continue swimming
after high school in a university,"
Murphy said, "but I never even
thought about going to the U.S.
until my senior year in high
school, when a coach suggested I
take a look at schools for both
swimming and academics."
The internationally renowned
swimmer "loved Stanford at first
sight," and fit in at first sight as
well. During his freshman year,
Murphy won the 200 back at the
NCAA Championships, and
reached the finals in the 100 back,
greatly aiding Stanford's team vic
tory effort.
"Going to NCAA's and winning
my first year was fantastic," he
said. "In terms of excitement,

competing in the national cham
pionships has to be comparable
to swimming in the Olympics."
Murphy's sophomore year was
even more of a success story. He
not only repeated as NCAA 200-
back champion, but placed fourth
in the 100 back and swam a leg
on the victorious medley relay
team at the finals as well. Mean
while, the Cardinal was going un
defeated in its dual-meet season
on the way to its second consecu
tive NCAA championship.
"As far as swimming goes, my
sophomore year was even more
exciting than my freshman,"
Murphy said. "It was a great
season."
Murphy is not super-human,
however, and his vulnerability
appeared last year. Stricken with
what turned out to be a sinus
infection, he was unable to swim
dual-meet times equal to those of
the previous two seasons. Al
though he was victorious in the
200 at the Pacific-10 Champion
ship meet, he was unable to win
a third straight 200-back title, set
tling for a fourth in the 200 and
an eighth in the 100. Yet he still
contributed to the Cardinal's
third consecutive national title.
"The competition got heavier
and I was sick," Murphy said. "It
was defintely disappointing, but
winning the NCAA's as a team
lessened the pain."
What stands out in Murphy's
mind, however, is not the national
victories or losing his title, but
swimming with the team. "Swim
ming at home was more in
dividual," he said. "I really picked
up a whole new view of swimming
at Stanford. It's really nice to be
able to share a winning tradition
with a team."
The Cardinal has been glad that
Murphy has wanted to share the
winning tradition. But in addition

to his race performances, Mur
phy's coaches and teammates
value him for his dedication, will
ingness to work hard and upbeat
attitude.
"He's a coach's dream. He was
born ready to work hard," Coach
Skip Kenney said. "He feels
working hard is the way to get
ahead, and his combination of
natural talent and great work eth
ics make him a great swimmer."
"Sean's probably the hardest
worker on the team. He's a great
workout swimmer and is always
training hard," fellow backstroker
Rick Gould said.
In addition, Murphy has had to
fill the fins of All-Everything
swimmers Pablo Morales and Jeff
Kostoff as captain and spiritual
leader of the squad.
"He's someone to look up to,
and has been really helpful in
keeping up the team's attitude
during our losses this year," said
Gould. "When I came here one of
the things I looked forward to
was working with Sean. He's al
