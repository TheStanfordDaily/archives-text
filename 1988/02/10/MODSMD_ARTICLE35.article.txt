# Rapp undaunted by injuries
## 
### David Hirning Staff Writer 
For standout Stanford swim
mer Susan Rapp, there is no more
"next year." The fifth-year senior
is not only currently training and
working for what will be her last
NCAA swim championships this
March, but hopefully a last hur
rah at the 1988 Summer Olympic
Games as well.
In the 1984 Olympics, Rapp
won a gold medal in the medley
relay and a silver in the breast
stroke. She qualified for the 1980
Games in Moscow which were
boycotted by the United States.
A world-class breaststroker who
has been to eight consecutive na
tional championships, Rapp will
wind up her competitive swim
ming career at the end of this
summer. Rather than being down
about her upcoming retirement,
however, Rapp right now is happy
that she is going to have a "this
year."
Rapp has been plagued with
knee problems throughout her
career that finally led to her un
dergoing arthroscopic surgery fol
lowing the the 1984 Olympics.
After sitting out the 1985 season,
she came back to regain top form.
Last year she won the NCAA 200-
meter breaststroke title in record
time.
Then, last spring, a severely
sprained ankle that wouldn't heal
forced her to stop competing most
of last summer and curtailed her
breaststroke training throughout
this year. Just qualifying for the
NCAAs and going to the Olympic
trials this summer were in doubt
for Rapp only one month ago.
"I hadn't done the breaststroke
(competitively) for so long that I
wasn't sure it was going to come
back," Rapp said. "I hadn't done
the 200-meter breaststroke since
the last NCAAs (in March of
1987) and that's a long time."
So when doctors gave her the
go-ahead recently with the reas
surance that she couldn't damage
her ankle any further, Rapp began
to swim again. On Jan. 29, in
Stanford's meet against Arizona
State, she qualified for the NCAAs
in the breaststroke. In the proc
ess, she gave notice to her team
and to the rest of the nation that
Susan Rapp is back.
Still, she is behind the other
swimmers in her events right now
because while people like Texas'
Tracey McFarlane were doing
2,500 breaststrokes a week or
more, Rapp has only been able to
do 5,000 the entire year.
Often, her injuries necessitate
that she only pull (swim without
kicking) in practice or even cut
down her workout significantly.
"She comes in everyday," senior
teammate Jennifer Pokluda said.
"Some days she can't kick . . .
well, she'll do everything else
twice as hard."
That means swimming with
pain, something Rapp does often.
"I think she always feels it (the
pain)," Pokluda said. "She just
keeps going."
"Most everyone becomes
amazed at how she can continue

to perform the way she does with
all the injuries she's had," Stan
ford Coach George Haines said.
"She's able to swim with pain and
she knows her body just about as
well as anyone I've ever coached."
Haines also said that Rapp has
done less pulling and a lot more
swimming recently.
This is good news for the Stan
ford team, which can use her lead
ership. As a fifth-year Stanford
swimmer, Rapp is an important
team leader along with co
captains Stacy Shupe and Pok
luda.
"It's great working with some
one like her," Pokluda said.
"She's a very positive person. .. .
When she gets up on the blocks
she's confident, and that rubs off
on the team."
Haines stated unequivocally
that her leadership qualities were
her most valuable asset. Citing
her injury-plagued past and how
she swims hurt, Haines added, "If
that can't inspire (a team), I don't
know what does."
Rapp also exudes that attitude
and leadership outside swimming.
She is volunteers her time ai a
youth-group counselor for Penin
sula Covenant Church in Red
wood City. It helps her to get
away from swimming and to meet
people outside the Stanford com
munity.
She hopes to get a job working
with high school kids after she
finishes her co-terminal degree in
psychology. Although Rapp works
extremely hard and is very com
petitive, she said that swimming
is not a life-and-death matter with
her.
Her swimming was put in per
spective with the rest of her life,
and she now has the advantage
of having already had to deal with
a career-threatening injury. "I
count my knee surgery as a bless
ing now," Rapp said.
She also puts the team ahead
of her personal goals. She wants

an NCAA title for Stanford more
that anything else.
"The NCAA is the most exciting
thing swimming for me," Rapp
said. "It's the hardest meet men
tally and physically, and it in
volves the whole team. When you
win, everyone wins. Winning for
your country is more impersonal,
more like winning for yourself."
She credits Stanford's very
close second-place finish at last
year's NCAAs to strong team uni
ty. She also counts her part in
Stanford's upset of Texas in the
medley relay at the 1987 NCAAs
as the highlight of her career, a
thrill topping her two Olympic
medals.
Being a three-time Olympian,
a rarity in women's swimming,
would be a very nice ending to
Rapp's career. But she sees other
international teams as being just
as tough to make and just as
meaningful.
"It's a shame when [com
petitors] put that much emphasis
on the Olympics because it's not
really a big deal. I'm going to try
my hardest to make it this sum
mer, and if I don't, I'm not going
to die," Rapp concluded.
However she does this summer,
Rapp is sure that this is it. Her
last chance to reach all her un
accomplished goals: an NCAA title
(to go with the one her sister won
as a Stanford team memeber in
1983) and a gold in the breast
stroke in the Olympics. Every
thing means more because it's her
senior year.
"When it's your last year, it
makes you want to go out in
style," Pokluda said. "For Susan,
the injuries . . . kind of make her
want to do well that much more."
The outlook is good. Pokluda
said Rapp has improved every
year and, despite her injuries,
"she will probably get back to the
level she was at before. In fact,
she will most likely surpass it."

captains Stacy Shupe and Pok
luda.
"It's great working with some
one like her," Pokluda said.
"She's a very positive person. .. .
When she gets up on the blocks
she's confident, and that rubs off
on the team."
Haines stated unequivocally
that her leadership qualities were
her most valuable asset. Citing
her injury-plagued past and how
she swims hurt, Haines added, "If
that can't inspire (a team), I don't
know what does."
Rapp also exudes that attitude
and leadership outside swimming.
She is volunteers her time ai a
youth-group counselor for Penin
sula Covenant Church in Red
wood City. It helps her to get
away from swimming and to meet
people outside the Stanford com
munity.
She hopes to get a job working
with high school kids after she
finishes her co-terminal degree in
psychology. Although Rapp works
extremely hard and is very com
petitive, she said that swimming
is not a life-and-death matter with
her.
Her swimming was put in per
spective with the rest of her life,
and she now has the advantage
of having already had to deal with
a career-threatening injury. "I
count my knee surgery as a bless
ing now," Rapp said.
She also puts the team ahead
of her personal goals. She wants

an NCAA title for Stanford more
that anything else.
"The NCAA is the most exciting
thing swimming for me," Rapp
said. "It's the hardest meet men
tally and physically, and it in
volves the whole team. When you
win, everyone wins. Winning for
your country is more impersonal,
more like winning for yourself."
She credits Stanford's very
close second-place finish at last
year's NCAAs to strong team uni
ty. She also counts her part in
Stanford's upset of Texas in the
medley relay at the 1987 NCAAs
as the highlight of her career, a
thrill topping her two Olympic
medals.
Being a three-time Olympian,
a rarity in women's swimming,
would be a very nice ending to
Rapp's career. But she sees other
international teams as being just
as tough to make and just as
meaningful.
"It's a shame when [com
petitors] put that much emphasis
on the Olympics because it's not
really a big deal. I'm going to try
my hardest to make it this sum
mer, and if I don't, I'm not going
to die," Rapp concluded.
However she does this summer,
Rapp is sure that this is it. Her
last chance to reach all her un
accomplished goals: an NCAA title
(to go with the one her sister won
as a Stanford team memeber in
1983) and a gold in the breast
stroke in the Olympics. Every
thing means more because it's her
senior year.
"When it's your last year, it
makes you want to go out in
style," Pokluda said. "For Susan,
the injuries . . . kind of make her
want to do well that much more."
The outlook is good. Pokluda
said Rapp has improved every
year and, despite her injuries,
"she will probably get back to the
level she was at before. In fact,
she will most likely surpass it."

Susan Rapp won a silver medal in the 200-meter breaststroke at the
1984 Summer Olympics.
For standout Stanford swim
mer Susan Rapp, there is no more
"next year." The fifth-year senior
is not only currently training and
working for what will be her last
NCAA swim championships this
March, but hopefully a last hur
rah at the 1988 Summer Olympic
Games as well.
In the 1984 Olympics, Rapp
won a gold medal in the medley
relay and a silver in the breast
stroke. She qualified for the 1980
Games in Moscow which were
boycotted by the United States.
A world-class breaststroker who
has been to eight consecutive na
tional championships, Rapp will
wind up her competitive swim
ming career at the end of this
summer. Rather than being down
about her upcoming retirement,
however, Rapp right now is happy
that she is going to have a "this
year."
Rapp has been plagued with
knee problems throughout her
career that finally led to her un
dergoing arthroscopic surgery fol
lowing the the 1984 Olympics.
After sitting out the 1985 season,
she came back to regain top form.
Last year she won the NCAA 200-
meter breaststroke title in record
time.
Then, last spring, a severely
sprained ankle that wouldn't heal
forced her to stop competing most
of last summer and curtailed her
breaststroke training throughout
this year. Just qualifying for the
NCAAs and going to the Olympic
trials this summer were in doubt
for Rapp only one month ago.
"I hadn't done the breaststroke
(competitively) for so long that I
wasn't sure it was going to come
back," Rapp said. "I hadn't done
the 200-meter breaststroke since
the last NCAAs (in March of
1987) and that's a long time."
So when doctors gave her the
go-ahead recently with the reas
surance that she couldn't damage
her ankle any further, Rapp began
to swim again. On Jan. 29, in
Stanford's meet against Arizona
State, she qualified for the NCAAs
in the breaststroke. In the proc
ess, she gave notice to her team
and to the rest of the nation that
Susan Rapp is back.
Still, she is behind the other
swimmers in her events right now
because while people like Texas'
Tracey McFarlane were doing
2,500 breaststrokes a week or
more, Rapp has only been able to
do 5,000 the entire year.
Often, her injuries necessitate
that she only pull (swim without
kicking) in practice or even cut
down her workout significantly.
"She comes in everyday," senior
teammate Jennifer Pokluda said.
"Some days she can't kick . . .
well, she'll do everything else
twice as hard."
That means swimming with
pain, something Rapp does often.
"I think she always feels it (the
pain)," Pokluda said. "She just
keeps going."
"Most everyone becomes
amazed at how she can continue

to perform the way she does with
all the injuries she's had," Stan
ford Coach George Haines said.
"She's able to swim with pain and
she knows her body just about as
well as anyone I've ever coached."
Haines also said that Rapp has
done less pulling and a lot more
swimming recently.
This is good news for the Stan
ford team, which can use her lead
ership. As a fifth-year Stanford
swimmer, Rapp is an important
team leader along with co
captains Stacy Shupe and Pok
luda.
"It's great working with some
one like her," Pokluda said.
