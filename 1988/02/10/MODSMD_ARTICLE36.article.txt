# Grade-A Farm memories

### 
Last Thursday's upset win over No. 1-ranked
Arizona and the raucous celebration that followed
took me back in time to my senior year of high
school and my AP English class.
My teacher had made the mistake of assigning
an open-ended comparison/contrast paper, and
being the total sports fan that I was, I of course
had the nerve to write my paper on Magic
Johnson and Larry Bird (I'm a Laker fan, so
you can guess who was depicted more favorably
in the paper).

In high school, as I'm sure you remember,
most of your papers were given two grades: one
for style and the other for content. Now, my
style grade for this paper was fine. But I can
still remember the confused look on my teacher's
face when he handed back the paper to me. I
could have sworn he was saying, "Magic Johnson?
Larry Bird? Who are they? Why couldn't you
have written about something more substantial
— Hemingway and Fitzgerald, perhaps, or the
U.S. and the Soviet Union?"
I didn't foel the least bit guilty then, but I
have to admit that many times since I have asked
myself the same question that my teacher seemed
to be asking. Why do I spend so much time
thinking about and watching sports when so
many other things go on in the world every day
that are more important? In other words, why
do I search every corner of my dorm lounge each
morning for the sports page, when I often don't
even bother to look at the front page?

Well, events like last Thursday's go a long way
in explaining the attraction of sports. The energy
and jubilation that the Stanford basketball team
created in Maples were truly unbelievable. The
feeling of witnessing the upset was comparable
to nothing I can remember.
Two things seem to make sports addictive:
uniqueness — seeing some person or team of
people do the unexpected or watching in awe as
somebody does something that you know you
never could do in your wildest dreams; and emo
tion — following a person or team and experi
encing vicariously the challenges, the feelings of
accomplishment and the disappointments they
encounter.
Sports is watching the real Todd Lichti reap
pear in the second half of last Thursday's game
to lead the Cardinal to an unthinkable, stunning
upset of Arizona.
Sports is watching the Stanford baseball team
stave off elimination by an eyelash last year in
Omaha as Paul Carey hits a dramatic opposite
field lOth-inning grand slam to give Stanford a
come-from-behind 6-5 victory over LSU.
Not all sporting events are this memorable,
but there is always the chance.
These are the memories that I (and I suspect
others) will retain for years to come. When I'm
70 years old, long after I forget the details 'of
the Iran-Contra fiasco, I'm certain that I'll be
able to sit back and remember as if it were
happening right before my eyes Greg Butler's
hand rise above a sea of flesh to softly tip in an
errant Howard Wright shot and give the Cardinal
a 77-74 lead with just over a minute to go against
the No. 1 Wildcats.
Or Lichti leaping triumphantly into Wright's
outstretched arms as the student section literally
spills onto the court to join them in celebration.
In comparison to everything else that happens
in the world, sports ultimately may be of little
importance. But sports are often captivating, fre
quently exciting and always unpredictable.
Therein lies the attraction.
