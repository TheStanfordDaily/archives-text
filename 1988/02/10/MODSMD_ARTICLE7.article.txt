# STOP request for van will appear on ballot
## ASSU also approves 24 other fee requests 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
The ASSU overturned last
night, in its longest meeting of
the year, the appropriations com
mittee "no vote" on the Safe
Transportation Program fee as
sessment and voted to support
STOP's request for funds to buy
a van to provide safe rides home
for intoxicated students.
The senate also confirmed the
budgets of 24 other student or
ganizations that will be included
on the special fee assessment bal
lot this spring.
Yesterday's senate vote was the
final step in the spring ballot
preparation process. Last week,
the senate appropriations com
mittee interviewed representa
tives from student organizations
seeking a place on the ballot.
Members of the committee
grilled representatives about their
organizations' budgets and then
decided which budget proposals
they would recommend to the sen

ate. These recommendations were
presented to the full senate last
night.
The senate voted to include all
25 of the organizations on the
ballot after closely scrutinizing
the budgets for the ASSU Course
Guide, Stanford Action, club
sports, the Concert Network, The
Daily, Public Access Television,
STOP and XTV, the student chan
nel.
STOP's fee assessment pro
posal was one of the most con
troversial issues facing the senate
because the organization's budget
was not supported by the mem
bers of the appropriations com
mittee. During open forum, STOP
presidents Glen Rosenbaum and
Andrew Lawson argued that the
organization needed funds to pur
chase a new van. This part of the
STOP budget proposal was the
main reason behind the appropri
ations committee's "no" recom
mendation.
Appropriations committee chair
Jon Inda proposed that STOP's

request for funds to purchase the
van be separated out from the
STOP budget and voted on at a
later date. Graduate senator Scott
Doering, however, pointed out
that plans for such a political ma
neuver need to be announced at
least seven days before the senate
meeting.
After more discussion, the
senators agreed to place the
original STOP budget (including
the fee assessment for the van
purchase) on the ballot.
ASSU administrative manager
Jack Ottoway proposed that the
salaries for ASSU Course Guide
coordinators be increased. This
amendment to the ASSU Course
Guide budget failed to gain ap
proval, however, and the original
fee assessment will appear on the
ballot.
Representatives from club
sports and XTV appealed to the
senate for support of their
budgets which were also quickly
given approval.
In contrast, the fee request for
the ASSU News will not appear
on the spring ballot because the
ASSU decided to pay for the bi
weekly news bulletin with their
own funds instead of student
money. The senate passed a bill
mandating that the ASSU Budget
and Finance Committee fund the
ASSU News from the 1988-89 op
erating budget.
The full senate decided to
change the appropriations com
mitee recommendations for five
of the student organization fee
assessments. The senate voted to
recommend the fee assessments
for club sports, STOP, the Stan
ford American Indian Organiza
tion and XTV, even though the
appropriations committee had
either given "neutral" or "no" rec
ommendations.
The senate also voted to adopt
a neutral stance toward the Public
Access Television fee assessment
which the appropriations commit
tee had opposed.
Another heated issue before the
senate last night was a bill to
support the Culture, Ideas and
Values proposal for the Area One
requirement. The bill, introduced
by Senators Lucky Gutierrez and
Stacey Leyton, suggested that the
senate reaffirm its support of the
CIV proposal in light of the al
ternative proposal that was
drafted by English Prof. William
Chace and other supporters of the
core reading list.
