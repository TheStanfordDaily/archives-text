# Trustees consider CIR plan
## Final decision on disinvestment policy due in March 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
In a preliminary discussion
Monday, the University Board of
Trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility (SCIR)
began consideration of a report
by the Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR) that urges
Stanford to abandon its long
standing policy of "selective dis
investment" toward business in
terests in South Africa.
"The report was taken very
seriously by the SCIR," said CIR
co-chair Kirk Hanson, a lecturer
at the Graduate School of Busi
ness. "I was reasonably pleased."
Also — in their meeting yester
day — the trustees approved the
expansion of the Stanford-in-
Berlin program and plans to open
Stanford's center in Kyoto, Japan.
And after the meeting, one trustee
predicted the closing of Roble Hall
would have little effect on room
and board rates for next year.
In order to "take a stronger
stand on apartheid," the ClR's
report recommends a blanket dis
investment policy whereby the
University would vote in favor of
any shareholder proposal to with
draw from South Africa. The Uni
versity currently holds stock in
about 40 companies that conduct
business in South Africa.
Approving the policy would rep
resent a major shift from the cur
rent policy of selective disinvest
ment, which involves case-by-case
consideration of shareholder
resolutions proposing disinvest
ment.
After conducting lengthy re

search, the CIR must now con
vince the SCIR that the recom
mended policy shift is the best
approach toward quickening the
end of apartheid.
Operations Research Prof.
Frederick Hillier, who is also co
chair of the CIR, said he expects
the SCIR to make a final decision
by March 7, when the trustees
convene again.
According to SCIR chair Ted
Mitchell, there is "no battle be
tween the SCIR and CIR. We are
working on the same beliefs and
principles."
Describing the CIR report as
"well-researched and well
documented," Mitchell called the
ClR's analysis "on-target. It
agrees with the best work to
date."
But Mitchell expressed concern
about the CIR stance that "Amer
ican companies can do no good in
South Africa." To date, he said,
"we have been operating and
thinking on the premise that a
company can do good."
U.S. firms in South Africa have
provided blacks with jobs and
funding for social programs. But
the report states these measures
"simply alleviate the effects of
apartheid instead of accelerating
its demise."
Mitchell also said that an "au
tomatic blanket policy doesn't al
low companies to make their case"
for involvement in South Africa,
whereas the present selective dis
investment policy maintains a
kind of "due process."
"If we were to adopt a blanket
policy, it would be a 'washing of
hands.' The University would be

arguments used
provoked serious
thinking and re
thinking. I find that
to be a good sign. 1

saying (to businesses), 'We want
you to get out of South Africa,
and we won't talk to you until
you do,' " Mitchell said.
Nevertheless, he said he was
optimistic about holding "infor
mal, collegial meetings" with the
CIR throughout the month, which
would lead to a consensus before
early March.
"By then we will all have
grappled with the issues fully,"
Mitchell said.
Hanson said the CIR held 13
two-hour meetings before making
their recommendations.
"So far the SCIR has met twice
for two hours. They'll need time
to work through the same things
it took us 13 meetings to work
through," Hanson said.
Concerning Monday's meeting,
Hanson said, "It was clear that
the arguments provoked serious
thinking and re-thinking. I find
that to be a good sign."
Hillier was also encouraged that
the "SCIR recognized that we had
done a very good job in presenting
our case."
With two new members on the
six-member SCIR, Hillier
predicted a "greater chance of
change from past policy" because
the new members would have "no
permanent stance or established
viewpoint" on University policy
toward disinvestment.
Hanson agreed. "It's always
good to have people looking at
[the issue] afresh," he said.
The renovations of Stanford-in-
Berlin will cost $1.3 million. They
involve adding classrooms, ex
panding the library and comput
ing tacUities and constructing a
larger seminar room at the
Stanford-in-Berlin house, the
Villa Muthesius. Funding for the
project is expected to come en
tirely from German donors.
The trustees yesterday also ap

proved plans to lease a facility for
the University's new programs in
Kyoto, Japan, which will enroll
at least 35 students annually.
The proposed building, which
the University would lease for 20
years, will be a two-and-one-half
story facility with classrooms, a
library, computing facilities, ad
ministrative offices, a language
lab and teacher consultation
room.
After the meeting yesterday,
Mitchell, who is also a member
of the Budget Committee, said the
trustees will consider raising stu
dent room and board expenses one
quarter to one half a percent
above normal room and board ex
pense increases over 20 years to
account for the Roble reconstruc
tion.
Last year the trustees approved
a 5.4 percent increase in room
and board expenses.
University officials refrained
from commenting on a rise in stu
dent expenses until the trustees
approve their budget recommen
dations in March.
