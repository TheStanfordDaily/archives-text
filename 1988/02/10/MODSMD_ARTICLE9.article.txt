# Bucking Overseas Studies brings bureaucratic hassle
## Stanford reluctant to recognize outside programs

"I got the education of my life" with
Oregon State University's program in
Beijing, said Julia Sze, a junior majoring
in Asian Studies and Economics. Sze
recently returned from studying the lan
guage and history of China — a country
where Stanford does not have an overseas
campus.
But when Sze returned to Stanford, bu
reaucratic entanglements overwhelmed
her. Sze said the University spoiled what
had been a very positive learning experi
ence for her.
"It seems like the University goes out
of its way to make things difficult for people
who don't go on Stanford programs," Sze
said.
Sze pointed out that when students go
abroad on programs that are not affiliated
with Stanford, the University does not pro
vide them with storage space while they
are away.
According to Sze, last spring a woman
in charge of storage room al
lowed Sze to store her belongings in the
room because she mistakingly thought that
Sze was going overseas with a Stanford
program.
When Sze went to reclaim her luggage
this fall, the woman in charge of storage
asked Sze which overseas campus she at
tended.
Sze explained to the woman storage

that she had been overseas — but not with
a Stanford program.
"[She] got really angry with me. She
said that I had stored my things illegally,
that the space was only for people going
abroad with Stanford and that they could
fine me $50 per box," Sze said.
Sze pled her case to the University,
claiming that there was no way for her to
have known that she was storing boxes
illegally.
The University did not charge her the
storage fee.
Sze, and students like her, have sought
international experiences beyond the scope
of Stanford's offerings but return facing
frustrating bureaucracy.
Besides storage problems, students who
study abroad on non-Stanford programs
face difficulties transferring credits as well.
Senior Michelle Leighton said she is un
sure if she will have enough credits to
graduate this spring because the University
might not accept all the units for the
courses she took on the Semester at Sea
Program, offered to college students who
want to study a variety of countries in
cluding China, Yugoslavia and the Soviet
Union.
Hoping to avoid a credit transfer prob
lem, Leighton said she met with a credit
evaluator before going abroad to discuss
her study list.
