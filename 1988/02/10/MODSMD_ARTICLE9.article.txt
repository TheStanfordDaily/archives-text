# Bucking Overseas Studies brings bureaucratic hassle
## Stanford reluctant to recognize outside programs 
### Brooke Harrington 
"I got the education of my life" with
Oregon State University's program in
Beijing, said Julia Sze, a junior majoring
in Asian Studies and Economics. Sze
recently returned from studying the lan
guage and history of China — a country
where Stanford does not have an overseas
campus.
But when Sze returned to Stanford, bu
reaucratic entanglements overwhelmed
her. Sze said the University spoiled what
had been a very positive learning experi
ence for her.
"It seems like the University goes out
of its way to make things difficult for people
who don't go on Stanford programs," Sze
said.
Sze pointed out that when students go
abroad on programs that are not affiliated
with Stanford, the University does not pro
vide them with storage space while they
are away.
According to Sze, last spring a woman
in charge of storage room al
lowed Sze to store her belongings in the
room because she mistakingly thought that
Sze was going overseas with a Stanford
program.
When Sze went to reclaim her luggage
this fall, the woman in charge of storage
asked Sze which overseas campus she at
tended.
Sze explained to the woman storage

that she had been overseas — but not with
a Stanford program.
"[She] got really angry with me. She
said that I had stored my things illegally,
that the space was only for people going
abroad with Stanford and that they could
fine me $50 per box," Sze said.
Sze pled her case to the University,
claiming that there was no way for her to
have known that she was storing boxes
illegally.
The University did not charge her the
storage fee.
Sze, and students like her, have sought
international experiences beyond the scope
of Stanford's offerings but return facing
frustrating bureaucracy.
Besides storage problems, students who
study abroad on non-Stanford programs
face difficulties transferring credits as well.
Senior Michelle Leighton said she is un
sure if she will have enough credits to
graduate this spring because the University
might not accept all the units for the
courses she took on the Semester at Sea
Program, offered to college students who
want to study a variety of countries in
cluding China, Yugoslavia and the Soviet
Union.
Hoping to avoid a credit transfer prob
lem, Leighton said she met with a credit
evaluator before going abroad to discuss
her study list.
She was disappointed to learn
that the University would not
credit her for an honors seminar
in political theory that was highly
recommended by her Stanford ad
visor.
"I really missed a great oppor
tunity," she said.
Junior Laura Stepp, who also
participated in the Semester at
Sea program this fall, faced credit
transfer problems as well.
Stepp said that a Semester at
Sea class on Ghandi and eastern
religions was "one of the best clas
ses" she has taken in college.
According to Stepp, the class
should have fulfilled her Area
Three religious studies require
ment at Stanford.
But Stepp said that since the
course did not "exactly match a
Stanford course," the University
would not exempt her from the
Area Three requirement.
"So far as distribution require
ments are concerned, it was just
time and money wasted," she said.
According to Registrar Sally
Mahoney, faculty committees
from relevant departments decide
how many units a course not
taken at Stanford deserves.
"They (the faculty committees)
look at the reading list, the syl
labus ... we act on their decisions
and the precedents they set,"
Mahoney explained.
Stepp, however, said she does
not think that the committees'
desicions are always fair.
"I think they have the right to
discriminate on the basis of
quality, but I know I worked just
as hard on Semester at Sea as I
do at Stanford, and they need to
take that seriously," she said.
"They want you to take courses
that are exactly like ones at Stan
ford," she added. "But then
what's the point of going abroad?"
Senior Laura Burtness, who

recently returned from Stanford's
campus in Oxford, England, ex
plained that becuase she partici
pated in the Stanford Overseas
Program, she was kept well
informed before she left.
"(There were) meetings every
where ... reminders telling you
where to go, where to get things,
when to get them in by."
Upon her return to Stanford,
Overseas Studies arranged a
reunion for the students who
went to Oxford. Students
reminisced and helped each other
cope with culture shock, according
to Burtness.
We prepare all participants in
Stanford programs carefully so
they will receive the maximum
benefit from their experience, said
Overseas Studies Director Nancy
Padgett.
According to Padgett, Overseas
Studies offers various seminars,
giving students a chance to dis
cuss contemporary European is
sues. Overseas Studies also leads
an "arriving and surviving" sem
inar for students planning to go
overseas. From filling out inter
national arrival cards to using lo
cal telephones, students who leave
for one of Stanford's overseas
campuses are well-briefed, accord
ing to Padgett.
Overseas Studies has recently
started a workshop encouraging
students to reflect on what made
them angriest when they were
abroad and how they felt as for
eigners.
When she returned from Se
mester at Sea, Leighton said she
was bothered by the lack of sup
port systems for students who
choose overseas study programs
that are not based at Stanford
campuses. "I was in India and
Third World countries ... but I
didn't have anyone to talk to who
would understand what it meant
to come back to Stanford. I had
to deal with it alone," Leighton
said.
"I just stood in White Plaza and
stared at the people."

Mahoney explained.
Stepp, however, said she does
not think that the committees'
desicions are always fair.
"I think they have the right to
discriminate on the basis of
quality, but I know I worked just
as hard on Semester at Sea as I
do at Stanford, and they need to
take that seriously," she said.
"They want you to take courses
that are exactly like ones at Stan
ford," she added. "But then
what's the point of going abroad?"
Senior Laura Burtness, who

recently returned from Stanford's
campus in Oxford, England, ex
plained that becuase she partici
pated in the Stanford Overseas
Program, she was kept well
informed before she left.
"(There were) meetings every
where ... reminders telling you
where to go, where to get things,
when to get them in by."
Upon her return to Stanford,
Overseas Studies arranged a
reunion for the students who
went to Oxford. Students
reminisced and helped each other
cope with culture shock, according
to Burtness.
We prepare all participants in
Stanford programs carefully so
they will receive the maximum
benefit from their experience, said
Overseas Studies Director Nancy
Padgett.
According to Padgett, Overseas
Studies offers various seminars,
giving students a chance to dis
cuss contemporary European is
sues. Overseas Studies also leads
an "arriving and surviving" sem
inar for students planning to go
overseas. From filling out inter
national arrival cards to using lo
cal telephones, students who leave
for one of Stanford's overseas
campuses are well-briefed, accord
ing to Padgett.
Overseas Studies has recently
started a workshop encouraging
students to reflect on what made
them angriest when they were
abroad and how they felt as for
eigners.
When she returned from Se
mester at Sea, Leighton said she
was bothered by the lack of sup
port systems for students who
choose overseas study programs
that are not based at Stanford
campuses. "I was in India and
Third World countries ... but I
didn't have anyone to talk to who
would understand what it meant
to come back to Stanford. I had
to deal with it alone," Leighton
said.
"I just stood in White Plaza and
stared at the people."
"I got the education of my life" with
Oregon State University's program in
Beijing, said Julia Sze, a junior majoring
in Asian Studies and Economics. Sze
recently returned from studying the lan
guage and history of China — a country
where Stanford does not have an overseas
campus.
But when Sze returned to Stanford, bu
reaucratic entanglements overwhelmed
her. Sze said the University spoiled what
had been a very positive learning experi
ence for her.
"It seems like the University goes out
of its way to make things difficult for people
who don't go on Stanford programs," Sze
said.
Sze pointed out that when students go
abroad on programs that are not affiliated
with Stanford, the University does not pro
vide them with storage space while they
are away.
According to Sze, last spring a woman
in charge of storage room al
lowed Sze to store her belongings in the
room because she mistakingly thought that
Sze was going overseas with a Stanford
program.
When Sze went to reclaim her luggage
this fall, the woman in charge of storage
asked Sze which overseas campus she at
tended.
Sze explained to the woman storage

that she had been overseas — but not with
a Stanford program.
"[She] got really angry with me. She
said that I had stored my things illegally,
that the space was only for people going
abroad with Stanford and that they could
fine me $50 per box," Sze said.
Sze pled her case to the University,
claiming that there was no way for her to
have known that she was storing boxes
illegally.
The University did not charge her the
storage fee.
Sze, and students like her, have sought
international experiences beyond the scope
of Stanford's offerings but return facing
frustrating bureaucracy.
Besides storage problems, students who
study abroad on non-Stanford programs
face difficulties transferring credits as well.
Senior Michelle Leighton said she is un
sure if she will have enough credits to
graduate this spring because the University
might not accept all the units for the
courses she took on the Semester at Sea
Program, offered to college students who
want to study a variety of countries in
cluding China, Yugoslavia and the Soviet
Union.
Hoping to avoid a credit transfer prob
lem, Leighton said she met with a credit
evaluator before going abroad to discuss
her study list.
She was disappointed to learn
that the University would not
credit her for an honors seminar
in political theory that was highly
recommended by her Stanford ad
visor.
"I really missed a great oppor
tunity," she said.
Junior Laura Stepp, who also
participated in the Semester at
Sea program this fall, faced credit
transfer problems as well.
Stepp said that a Semester at
Sea class on Ghandi and eastern
religions was "one of the best clas
ses" she has taken in college.
According to Stepp, the class
should have fulfilled her Area
Three religious studies require
ment at Stanford.
But Stepp said that since the
course did not "exactly match a
Stanford course," the University
would not exempt her from the
Area Three requirement.
"So far as distribution require
ments are concerned, it was just
time and money wasted," she said.
According to Registrar Sally
Mahoney, faculty committees
from relevant departments decide
how many units a course not
taken at Stanford deserves.
"They (the faculty committees)
look at the reading list, the syl
labus ... we act on their decisions
and the precedents they set,"
Mahoney explained.
Stepp, however, said she does
not think that the committees'
desicions are always fair.
"I think they have the right to
discriminate on the basis of
quality, but I know I worked just
as hard on Semester at Sea as I
do at Stanford, and they need to
