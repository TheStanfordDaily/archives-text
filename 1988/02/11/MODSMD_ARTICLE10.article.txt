# Experts defend drug testing
## Steroids a serious problem, NCAA witnesses contend 
### Bruce LeDesma Staff writer 
The final trial in the ongoing NCAA drug-testing
case involving two Stanford students entered its
second day yesterday as two expert witnesses tes
tified that drug testing deters substance abuse by
college athletes.
Both Ken Kladnik, head athletic trainer at Oregon
State University, and Dr. Jerome Patmont, team
doctor of men's athletics at UC-Berkeley, also tes
tified that steroid use by football players was the
most common form of drug abuse in intercollegiate
athletics.
"Kladnik testified that athletes had told him they
had used drugs, and in most instances it was steroids
by football players," said University attorney Debra
Zumwalt, who is representing Stanford as a third
party in the case. The suit was filed last year by
women's soccer player Jennifer Hill and football
player Barry McKeever.
Patmont also named a few specific instances of
drug use by athletes, Zumwalt said.
Both witnesses admitted, however, that the vast
majority of college athletes did not use drugs, Zum
walt said.
"Neither of them had personal knowledge of drug
use," Zumwalt said. She added that Patmont also
said college athletes used drugs less than other
college students.
Both Oregon State and Berkeley have in the past
had their own drug-testing programs in addition to
the NCAA program. In both instances, however,
the programs were abolished for legal reasons, Zum-

Walt said. In the case of Oregon State, the state
attorney general declared the program illegal, she
said.
In testimony, Patmont also complained about
some of the procedures used by the NCAA in its
testing. For instance, he said the NCAA should test
football players the night before an athletic event
in order to ensure accuracy, not two weeks before.
Similar problems were cited in court Monday
when drug-testing expert Dr. Daniel Hanley testified
that the paperwork following the collection of urine
samples was confusing and could potentially lead
to inaccurate evaluations by the NCAA labs.
The next day of testimony is scheduled for Feb.
17. The NCAA intends to call several more witnesses
to testify in favor of drug testing. Robert Van Nest,
who is representing Hill and McKeever on behalf
of the American Civil Liberties Union, plans to
bring two expert witnesses, Zumwalt said.
Zumwalt said she plans to call Stanford Men's
Basketball Coach Mike Montgomery as a witness.
Montgomery is expected to testify that there are
no drugs that can enhance his players' performance.
