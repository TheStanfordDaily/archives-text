"Sexuality is socially con
structed .... There is nothing
natural or innate about our
current sexual behavior,"
sociologist Tomas Almaguer
said here yesterday.
The lecture, titled "Towards
a Sociology of Sexuality: Gay
and Lesbian Inequality," was
part of the Jing Lyman lecture
series, which focuses this quar
ter on "Love and Sex."
Almaguer, an assistant pro
fessor of sociology at UC-
Berkeley, said there is
"growing public concern with
issues of sexuality," including
the "basic right of individuals
to control their own bodies."
As examples of this trend, he
cited the the abortion debate
and a recent U.S. Supreme
Court decision upholding a
Georgia law prohibiting
sodomy between consenting
adults.

Almaguer went on to say
that although our society
primarily has a "hydraulic
model" of sexuality, it is actu
ally "mostly between the ears."
Although various forms of
"non-procreative sexuality"
have been "viewed in a negative
light," Almaguer said society
should "approach sexual diver
sity with the same respect we
give other products of culture."
Using cuisine as an analogy,
he pointed out that although
eating is a natural need, like
sexuality, "what people choose
to put in their mouths varies
widely."
Almaguer, who has written
on the impact of race, gender
and ethnicity on social
stratification patterns, said
that while there may be ten
sions between oppressed
groups like women, ethnic
minorities, gays and lesbians,
"Our struggles are the same."
