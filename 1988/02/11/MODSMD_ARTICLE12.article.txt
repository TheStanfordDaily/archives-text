Ship damaged in Iranian attack
BAGHDAD, Iraq — A Liberian tanker
loaded with Saudi Arabian petroleum sailed
to the United Arab Emirates port of Dubai
for repairs yesterday after it was struck by
rocket fired by an Iranian helicopter late Tues
day.
The attack was the first by an Iranian
helicopter on shipping since April 20, 1987,
and the buildup of U.S. and Western naval
forces in the Persian Gulf in July.
Gulf press reports, meanwhile, said that four
U.S. frigates were homeward-bound and were
to be followed later this month by the bat
tleship lowa, the amphibious helicopter carrier
J Okinawa and two other vessels.
4 In Muscat, the government newspaper
Oman quoted reliable British sources as saying
that America's European allies had also
decided to reduce their gulf fleets to half the
present strength.
Army faces deep personnel cuts
WASHINGTON — The Army will shrink
to a 10-year low of 772,600 soldiers this budget
year and may drop to pre-Korean War levels
to free money needed to pay for weaponry it
ordered during the boom days of President
Reagan's defense buildup, Army leaders said
yesterday.
James Ambrose, who leaves his post as un
dersecretary of the Army this month, told The
Washington Post that if zero-growth defense
budgets continue, as seems likely, he would
rather let the Army have as few as 521,000
soldiers than try to field a large force without
arms needed to combat the Soviet threat.
The current Army of 781,000 compares with
the Vietnam War peak of 1.57 million in 1968,
the Korean War high of 1.59 million in 1952
and the World War II high of 5.98 million in
1945.
The proposed reduction this year to 772,600
active-duty men and women would bring the
Army to its lowest strength since the 758,000
under arms in 1979.
