# Treaty dispute widens debate on INF
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The struggle of
Senate Democrats and the Reagan ad
ministration for the last word in
treaty-making has unexpectedly
widened the debate over the new U.S.-
Soviet nuclear arms accord into a con
tentious confrontation that is sending
tremors through both parties.
The tussle has caused cleavages
within Democratic and Republican
ranks and caught the administration
in a difficult squeeze, attempting to
placate powerful Democratic leaders
without offending its most loyal con
servative Republican adherents.
Senate Armed Services Committee
Chair Sam Nunn, D-Ga., has thrust
himself once again to the forefront of
arms-control maneuvering, leaving the
administration and Democratic
majority on the Foreign Relations
Committee in disarray.
The controversy raises anew a pos

sible outpouring of amendments,
reservations and other conditions that
could delay and complicate Senate ap
proval of the treaty to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear forces
(INF), some senators warn.
A prolonged treaty debate could cut
into other Senate business, hurting
the Democratic-controlled Congress'
hopes of showing voters in this fall's
elections what a Democratic govern
ment would give the country.
Republicans are angry with the ad
ministration over its moves to com
promise with the Democrats; some
suggest the administration may be
sorry the next time it counts on them
to "fall on our swords" for the White
House on the Senate floor.
The State Department, said a Senate
Republican leadership aide, has
"seized the opportunity to anger every
one . .. and has taken us back to

Square One without really resolving
anything."
The dispute dates to 1985 when the
administration, attempting to re
interpret the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Mis
sile (ABM) Treaty to allow advanced
testing of its controversial "Star Wars"
missile defense system, asserted that
administration testimony at ratifica
tion hearings may not reflect a treaty's
true meaning.
Democrats contended this would
enable presidents to reinterpret
treaties to suit their purposes without
Senate consent, and now are trying to
use the INF debate to resolve the
treaty-interpretation issue in the
Senate's favor.
But there are splits. While Nunn
tries to extract concessions from the
administration, Sen. Joseph Biden Jr.,
D-Del., second-ranking Democrat on
the Foreign Relations Committee,

wants to attach conditions to the INF
Treaty that would, in effect, write into
law what Democrats regard as the
Senate's historic powers in treaty
making.
Secretary of State George Shultz has
sent a letter to Nunn and Majority
Leader Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., ad
dressing their concerns, but neither
the letter nor Biden's proposal scores
a direct hit on the administration's
"broad" ABM treaty reading, which is
what most Republicans and Democrats
care most about. But, because both
could give Democrats ammunition for
that fight, Republicans worked Wed
nesday to get a Shultz letter of their
own to foreswear any implications for
future debates over ABM and the "Star
Wars" Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI). They are also laying longer
range plans to fend off Biden.
