### 
CAPE TOWN, South Africa - An
attempted military takeover of Bophut
hatswana, one of South Africa's
nominally independent tribal
homelands, was crushed quickly yester
day when South Africa sent in its own
troops to rescue the president and res
tore his government to power.
Backed by hundreds of heavily armed
troops in armored cars and helicopter
gunships, South African police com
mandos stormed a sports stadium at
Mmabatho, the homeland capital, to
free President Lucas Mangope and other
Bophuthatswana officials held there
since the predawn coup d'etat by army
officers who accused the government of
corruption and election fraud.
At least four people were killed in
clashes through the day, including a
Bophuthatswana soldier shot to death

during the South African rescue effort.
Several others, including a senior South
African security official working for the
Bophuthatswana government, were
wounded.
When order was restored late yester
day evening, President Pieter Botha and
three of his top ministers flew to
Mmabatho, about 200 miles northwest
of Johannesburg, to demonstrate South
Africa's support for Mangope.
"The South African government is
opposed in principle to obtaining polit
ical power by violence," Botha told Par
liament here yesterday afternoon.
South Africa's state security council
had met through the morning, Botha
said, and had decided to respond to an
appeal from several Bophuthatswana
ministers for help because their govern
ment had been legally and constitution

ally elected and was recognized by
Pretoria.
Jubilant over the success of the op
eration, Botha warmly congratulated
the South African police and troops
after meeting with Mangope for 90
minutes yesterday night at the heavily
guarded South African Embassy in
Mmabatho.
The events in Bophuthatswana, long
regarded as the model homeland be
cause of its political stability and rela
tive prosperity, nonetheless clearly em
barrassed Botha. His critics on the left
again ridiculed the controversial
homelands, which only South Africa
recognizes, and those on the right ques
tioned his ability to govern since
Pretoria was caught unaware by the
coup attempt.
