### 
NASHUA, N.H. - Vice Presi
dent Bush hurried back to Now
Hampshire yesterday for an all
out effort to reverse a political
slide that has moved Sen. Robert
Dole, R-Kan., to within striking
distance of him in the nation's
first presidential primary here
next week.
Overnight polling Tuesday by
The Washington Post and ABC
News showed Dole closing the gap
between him and Bush to four
percentage points, with Bush
clinging to a 33-to-29 percent lead.
The results represent a net gain
of six points for Dole in the first
24 hours after he had won the
lowa Republican caucuses and
Bush had finished third behind
former television evangelist Pat
Robertson.
Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., with
12 percent, was a distant third in

the overnight tracking poll, which
showed Robertson's support
growing from six percent to nine
percent.
While Robertson is not thought
to pose a direct threat to Bush
or Dole here, there is a growing
consensus among political opera
tives in the state that he could
overtake Kemp and finish third
in Tuesday's primary. Such a
result would effectively end
Kemp's campaign, which is al
ready reeling, and give Robertson
another boost before the
southern-dominated March 8
"Super Tuesday" contests.
Former Delaware governor
Pierre "Pete" du Pont IV had
slipped to seven percent support
and former secretary of state Al
exander Haig to two percent, ac
cording to the poll.
