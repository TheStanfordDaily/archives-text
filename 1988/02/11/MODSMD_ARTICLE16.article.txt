# Court rules against Army
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES — In a potentially
far-reaching decision praised by gay
rights activists, a federal appeals court
ruled yesterday that Army regulations
barring military service by homosexuals
are unconstitutional.
"We hold that the Army's regulations
violate the constitutional guarantee of
equal protection of the laws because they
discriminate against persons of
homosexual orientation . . . and because
the regulations are not necessary to
promote a legitimate compelling
governmental interest," the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeal said in a 2-1
ruling.
The opinion, written by Judge William
Norris, reversed a lower court ruling
that had upheld a 1982 decision by the
Army to bar the re-enlistment of Sgt.
Perry Watkins, 39, of Tacoma, Wash.,
because of his homosexuality. Watkins,
who received exemplary performance

ratings throughout his 14-year military
career, had admitted his sexual prefer
ence before he first enlisted in August
1967.
The appellate ruling, announced at
the court's offices in Los Angeles and
San Francisco, does not prohibit the
Army or other branches of the military
from forbidding certain types of sexual
conduct, such as sodomy or oral copula
tion, as long as the prohibition applies
to both heterosexuals and homosexuals.
"This is the most important judicial
victory for gay rights ever issued by a
court in the United States," said Thomas
Stoddard, executive director of the
Lambda Legal Defense and Education
Fund, a gay-rights organization.
"This is a major victory," added Jeff
Levi, executive director of the National
Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
