## Applaud Maynard 
### 
Robert maynard was
chosen last week to speak
at this year's Commence
ment. While many applauded the
decision to invite Maynard, the
nation's first black editor and pub
lisher of a major metropolitan
newspaper, some questioned
whether he was an appropriate
choice to speak at Stanford, a uni
versity with so many pretensions
to national and world-wide re
spectability.
"W,ho the hell is Robert
Maynard?" â€” so the argument
goes. Some students apparently
wanted someone of more "stature"
to address the graduating class, as
opposed to a mere "rising star."
Such an argument is arrogant
and elitist, and unfortunately begs
the question: What are the proper
selection criteria for a graduation
speaker?
National or international
celebrity should not be the criter
ion. Tip O'Neill, Ted Koppel and
Mario Cuomo, all Commencement
luminaries from recent years, were
certainly well-known, but the ques
tion remains open whether their
speeches in fact addressed the con
cerns of the Stanford community.
In choosing Maynard, a nation
ally respected analyst of educa
tional issues with a reputation for
eloquence, the Commencement
speaker selection committee has
found someone who should have
something substantial to say to the
University about its educational
mission.
That, perhaps, is the most im
portant criterion of all.
Besides, Maynard already has a
prodigious resume. When Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
tapped him to speak, it was hardly
the first such honor extended to
Maynard, who serves as a member
of the board of directors on the
Pulitzer Prize Board and the As
sociated Press.

Maynard didn't reach the top of
The Tribune in Oakland through
cronyism, by gliding through the
journalism world with establish
ment credentials.
The strongest credential
Maynard has going for him is, in
fact, his non-establishment back
ground. Maynard doesn't have a
university education, and he
smashed a racial barrier in a field
that was long overdue for strong
minority leadership.
Those who say race was an over
riding factor in the choice are
wrong. Maynard's example is ad
mirable both for what he has ac
complished and for the barriers he
has overcome along the way. To
say that Maynard would not have
been chosen if he were white is a
narrow view of racial discrimina
tion.
Some confusion in the matter
could have been avoided if the
senior class presidents had made
a more concerted, systematic effort
to determine the opinions of the
class. The relatively unscientific
poll conducted last fall did, how
ever, show that many seniors were
strongly interested in selecting a
minority or woman to speak on
education, and Maynard fits the
bill.
In the future, every senior
should be contacted, although the
selection process needs to remain
confidential to ensure that the per
son ultimately selected is not un
dermined by rumors that he or
she may have been the second,
third or fourth choice of the panel.
Regardless, however, Maynard
has set an inspiring example as a
self-made, independent, gutsy suc
cess story, and the Commencement
speaker selection panel should be
lauded for its progressive-minded
decision. Not only can Maynard be
proud to address Stanford, but the
University community can, and
should, be proud to hear him.
