# COP vetoes senate bill
## Fee appropriation recommendations rejected 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
The Council of Presidents late
Tuesday night vetoed the ASSU
Senate's recommendations for fee
appropriations to various campus
organizations, COP member Jim
Durkin said yesteray.
Earlier Tuesday the senate
placed 25 appropriations requests
on the ballot and then voted
whether or not to endorse the
requests in the ASSU Spring Elec
tion Handbook.
The senate gave endorsements
without having complete informa
tion, Durkin contended, because
its appropriations committee
made recommendations about
whether the senate should en
dorse the requests but did not
provide written details on the
reasons for its evaluations.
Durkin said he hopes the veto
"will make an example" to the
senate to take more care in pre
paring bills.
But senior Brett Mahoney, an
appropriations committee mem
ber, said the committee is not re

quired to write out its reasoning
because it is best suited to make
the evaluations.
According to Durkin, the appro
priations committee presented a
list of "yes" and "no" recommen
dations as to whether the full sen
ate should endorse particular
funding requests that will be
voted on in the ASSU's spring
election. But Durkin said the com
mittee neglected to explain its
reasoning in writing, which he
said is not standard practice.
"For the senate to recommend
that the student body vote in a
particular way about a student
group's funding, fairness
demands that the senate at least
know wny the recommendation is
being made," according to an of
ficial statement issued by the COP
yesterday. "To blindly vote to ap
prove many of the measures
denies both the student groups
and the students, whom we rep
resent, justice," the statement
said.
"We agree with many of the
recommendations," Durkin said.
"But it is for the students' benefit

to be told why (the recommenda
tions are made)." Durkin also said
the senate did not inform many
campus organizations requesting
funding about the recommenda
tion process and therefore did not
allow them an opportunity to ar

space and to determine where the
groups will be placed.
The offices that are available
are often less than desirable. Ac
cording to the committee's pre
liminary report, a total of
$148,760 in repairs is needed on
existing student office facilities.
The Old Firehouse is in the worst
condition, with $72,860 in recom
mended repairs.
AIESEC, the international stu
dent economic organization, has
had security problems at its of
fices in the Old Firehouse. Ac
cording to senior Maher Al-
Jubeir, president of AIESEC, two
answering machines were stolen
from its original office.
Though the group has since
moved to a new space across the
hall, it doesn't have a key to the
door and has to be left unlocked.
Even if it could be locked, the
door doesn't reach down to the
ground, allowing intruders to slip
underneath.
