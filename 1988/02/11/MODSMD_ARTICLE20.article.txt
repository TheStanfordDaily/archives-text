## Surrogacy is a right 
### 
TO SELL YOUR BABY or not to
sell your baby. That is the ques
tion.
A crude question, but nonetheless, a
question that raises important issues re
garding the surrogate baby controversy.
Last week's ruling by New Jersey's Su
preme Court found "the payment of
money to a 'surrogate' mother illegal,
perhaps criminal, and potentially degrad
ing to women."
By ruling against the validity of a con
tractual agreement between two consent
ing and benefitting parties, the court has
undermined the spirit of free enterprise
and humanitarianism which is character
istic of the surrogacy business.
While the decision primarily affects
surrogacy agreements in New Jersey, it
is destined to become a landmark ruling
or at least a guideline for similar decisions
across the country. It is sad to note that
once again, the nation's courts are
seeking to prohibit, regulate and legislate
an issue that should be a very personal
and individual decision.
Perhaps the biggest controversy in sur
rogacy surrounds the concept of "baby
selling." Most every culture agrees that
life is an invaluable commodity. Money
can never be an adequate compensation
for a gift as unique as life.
Yet it is both immature and naive to
take the concept of life and idealize it
until it can only be revered. While it
seems callous to say so, in the everyday
world, life is given a dollar value. Sur
rogacy should not be the exception.
The New Jersey court stated that sur
rogacy is "the sale of a child or, at the

very least, the sale of a mother's right
to her child, the only mitigating factor
being that one of the purchasers is the
father." It is this aspect of surrogacy,
the "baby selling," that has caused the
court to deem surrogacy illegal.
What can possibly be wrong with the
fact that a transaction takes place, that
money changes hands? Hospitals refuse
to treat terminally ill patients who lack
insurance, doctors charge fees that ex
clude many sick people from beneficial
health services, and surgeons postpone
vital organ transplant surgeries until
funds can be found to cover their ex
penses. Certainly life is invaluable, but
when resources are limited, allocation by
dollars is not only practical but essential.
The New Jersey court's decision could
have legal ramifications on the operations
of many commercialized surrogacy clinics
throughout the country, but most clinics
don't feel that the demand or use of
surrogates will be jeopardized.
In most cases when the government
tries to intervene in private sector deci
sions people inevitably find ways to get
around the rules. Childless couples will
continue to seek surrogates to aid them
in their search for babies. If monetary
compensation is ruled out and considered
illegal, then other forms of compensation
will be found. Surrogate mothers will be
bestowed with expensive gifts. Houses or
cars will take the place of checks.
It seems particulary unfair that the
court's decision to prohibit the payment
of money to surrogates was based on
exceptional cases where the contracted
agreements failed. According to New

York City's Infertility Center, there have
already been 200 successfully carried sur
rogate babies. Forty-seven more babies
are on the way, and 150 additional sur
rogacy contracts have already been
signed. Clearly, surrogacy works for
many people. To say that voluntary sur
rogacy is legal but compensation is not,
would certainly discourage many women
who have considered the rewards of
giving a young life to a childless couple.
Surrogacy is a freedom of choice issue.
Women arid parents, who are carefully
screened and found physiologically and
psychologically capable of undergoing the
procedure, should be free to do so and
should be compensated as well. If a
woman makes the informed decision to
sign a surrogacy contract and agrees to
give up her child at birth, she should be
committed to that decision.
Surrogacy is an invaluable resource for
women who are unable to bear children.
As this issue reaches the higher courts
of other states in the nation, hopefully
more realistic and fair decisions will be
reached. While the courts cannot contract
for love and emotion, they have a re
sponsibility to enforce contracts.

surrogates will be jeopardized.
In most cases when the government
tries to intervene in private sector deci
sions people inevitably find ways to get
around the rules. Childless couples will
continue to seek surrogates to aid them
in their search for babies. If monetary
compensation is ruled out and considered
illegal, then other forms of compensation
will be found. Surrogate mothers will be
bestowed with expensive gifts. Houses or
cars will take the place of checks.
It seems particulary unfair that the
court's decision to prohibit the payment
of money to surrogates was based on
exceptional cases where the contracted
agreements failed. According to New

York City's Infertility Center, there have
already been 200 successfully carried sur
rogate babies. Forty-seven more babies
are on the way, and 150 additional sur
rogacy contracts have already been
signed. Clearly, surrogacy works for
many people. To say that voluntary sur
rogacy is legal but compensation is not,
would certainly discourage many women
who have considered the rewards of
giving a young life to a childless couple.
Surrogacy is a freedom of choice issue.
Women arid parents, who are carefully
screened and found physiologically and
psychologically capable of undergoing the
procedure, should be free to do so and
should be compensated as well. If a
woman makes the informed decision to
sign a surrogacy contract and agrees to
give up her child at birth, she should be
committed to that decision.
Surrogacy is an invaluable resource for
women who are unable to bear children.
As this issue reaches the higher courts
of other states in the nation, hopefully
more realistic and fair decisions will be
reached. While the courts cannot contract
for love and emotion, they have a re
sponsibility to enforce contracts.
