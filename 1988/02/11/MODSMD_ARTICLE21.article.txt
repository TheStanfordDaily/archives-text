# Point/Counterpoint
## Research dangers Will animal research facility pose health risks? 
### 
ffl

Risks are not confined to
labs or incinerators; what
goes on underground and
behind closed doors affects
the health of every one on
or near the Stanford
campus.

The University seeks to prevent public
scrutiny of animal use, toxics and pollu
tion. Safety is to be provided by a system
of internal loops — with the public out
of the loop. Inspections by outside
agencies are almost non-existent. Only
radiation is checked regularly, and that
once every two years.
Inspection under the federal Animal
Welfare Act (the only law applying to lab
animals in California, research institu
tions being exempt from state anti
cruelty laws) is so underfunded that a
1985 Government Office of Accounting
report found that half the research
facilities in California were never in
spected. The other half were inspected
on the average of once a year with viola
tion follow-ups erratic.
Research institutions are required by
law to make yearly reports of numbers
and species of animals. Stanford has told
the press that it holds about 90,000
animals, but its reports to the Depart
ment of Agriculture, obtained under the
Freedom of Information Act, seem to
show only new animals. In 1984 the num
ber of primates claimed was 1,257, for
example; in 1985, 128; and in 1986 only
56. Why the discrepancy?
Stanford has also failed to report, as
required by law, painful procedures on
fully conscious animals. We find from
the journals that many experiments have
little if anything to do with improving
human health.
The dean of the School of Medicine
last June urged associates to lobby the
USDA to weaken proposed regulations
under the Dole/Brown Bill, recently
enacted to give further protection to lab
animals.

Regulations cited as too stringent deal
with access to and inspection of records
and property, procurement of companion
animals from pounds, well-being of dogs
and primates, setting categories of animal
use based on levels of pain and distress,
and euthanasia.
Research Animal Facility 11, connected
by underground passages to RAF I and
the new Center for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine, would serve to hold animals
for research done primarily at CMGM.
The draft Environmental Impact Report
on RAF II fails to consider cumulative
impacts of these facilities on public health
and the environment as required by the
California Environmental Quality Act.
On inadequate evidence, it asserts there
would be no unmitigated effects from
radiation or biohazardous materials.
It states there are no potential hazards
from rDNA research for example, but
does not offer, as required by CEQA,
contrary expert opinion. It describes a
system of internal review panels for re
search procedures with infectious and
mutagenic agents without specifying the
agents concerned. The guidelines for such
panels are themselves badly out of date
and unenforceable. There are no outside
inspections.
At Stanford there has been research
for the Biological Warfare Defense pro
gram on pathogenic agents, including the
plague. Pathogens may be put down the
drains, be released in spore form into
the air or may be carried into the com
munity all of which are hazards of stag
gering scope and severity.
The research race rewards the Univer
sity with massive funding, tax-exempt
donations and patent licensing. Research
ers become paid advisors to biotech com
panies. And the public? The public has
the right to know just what is going on
next door.

An appeal of the county
use permit for Stanford's
Research Animal Facility
II filed by the Palo Alto
Humane Society last
spring has now blossomed
into a monstrously time

and money-consuming exercise in manip
ulation of California environmental law.
RAF II has been delayed approximately
10 months by an unnecessary Environ
mental Impact Report that will ulti
mately cost the University something in
excess of $700,000. The process involves
public hearings and document reviews,
carrying a hefty price tag for Santa Clara
County and the taxpayer.
Far outweighing all this is the ines
timable price of delayed medical research
and, one can reasonably assume, human
lives. Does the Humane Society represent
the interest of the "concerned" citizen
as they claim? Is their approach
reasonable? No.
On the contrary, I believe that the
Humane Society and others behind the
scene are abusing the system, causing
unwarranted, dangerous delays and mis
representing the case to the county and
to the public.
As project manager for Stanford on
this project, I have followed RAF II from
the early stagea of planning through the
various approval and appeal steps, and I
have seen the evolution of the Humane
Society position as it has opportunisti
cally adapted to suit the political climate.
The original "concerns" voiced by the
Humane Society had to do with the care
and treatment of research animals to be
housed in RAF 11. After much public
discussion, the animal care issue virtually
dropped out of the rhetoric because, I
suspect, it became clear that Stanford
does an exemplary job of caring for and
managing research animals, and RAF II
will only improve existing conditions.
Next, in a transparent but cleverly
timed change of tactic, the PAHS began

listing unspecified research-related
dangers emanating from within the build
ing. The right buzz words delivered with
the proper tone of alarm at a pivotal
public hearing led the county Board of
Supervisors to require an EIR.
Now, six months into the EIR process,
the public has the draft report which
clearly demonstrates what was obvious
to begin with — that RAF II has no
negative environmental impact what
soever.
The project will be a thoroughly in
nocuous holding facility with very little
research actually conducted in the build
ing. Predictably, the Humane Society
view has changed again in response to
this reality.
By stretching an interpretation of the
California Environmental Quality Act to
the point of abuse, they now claim that
the scope of the EIR is inadequate since
it does not fully study adjacent buildings.
Meanwhile, the stage is apparently
being set for the next wave of political
maneuvering. The Humane Society has
announced that they have enlisted
Jeremy Rifkin for outside coaching in
preparation of their review of the draft
EIR.
Rifkin, who heads the Foundation on
Economic Trends in Washington, D.C.,
has gained a reputation as a prophet of
doom with visions of technology-gone
haywire.
The University has been open and co
operative at every turn in pursuing this
much-needed and harmless project while
the PAHS continues to be manipulative
and calculating in its goal of subverting
medical research by any available means.
The public and the County must realize
that RAF II is being held hostage in an
ever-expanding and counterproductive
political game.

The original "concerns" voiced by the
Humane Society had to do with the care
and treatment of research animals to be
housed in RAF 11. After much public
discussion, the animal care issue virtually
dropped out of the rhetoric because, I
suspect, it became clear that Stanford
does an exemplary job of caring for and
managing research animals, and RAF II
will only improve existing conditions.
Next, in a transparent but cleverly
timed change of tactic, the PAHS began

listing unspecified research-related
dangers emanating from within the build
ing. The right buzz words delivered with
the proper tone of alarm at a pivotal
public hearing led the county Board of
Supervisors to require an EIR.
Now, six months into the EIR process,
the public has the draft report which
clearly demonstrates what was obvious
to begin with — that RAF II has no
negative environmental impact what
soever.
The project will be a thoroughly in
nocuous holding facility with very little
research actually conducted in the build
ing. Predictably, the Humane Society
view has changed again in response to
this reality.
By stretching an interpretation of the
California Environmental Quality Act to
the point of abuse, they now claim that
the scope of the EIR is inadequate since
it does not fully study adjacent buildings.
Meanwhile, the stage is apparently
being set for the next wave of political
maneuvering. The Humane Society has
announced that they have enlisted
Jeremy Rifkin for outside coaching in
preparation of their review of the draft
EIR.
Rifkin, who heads the Foundation on
Economic Trends in Washington, D.C.,
has gained a reputation as a prophet of
doom with visions of technology-gone
haywire.
The University has been open and co
operative at every turn in pursuing this
much-needed and harmless project while
the PAHS continues to be manipulative
and calculating in its goal of subverting
medical research by any available means.
The public and the County must realize
that RAF II is being held hostage in an
ever-expanding and counterproductive
political game.

Risks are not confined to
labs or incinerators; what
goes on underground and
behind closed doors affects
the health of every one on
or near the Stanford
campus.

The University seeks to prevent public
scrutiny of animal use, toxics and pollu
tion. Safety is to be provided by a system
of internal loops — with the public out
of the loop. Inspections by outside
agencies are almost non-existent. Only
radiation is checked regularly, and that
once every two years.
Inspection under the federal Animal
Welfare Act (the only law applying to lab
animals in California, research institu
tions being exempt from state anti
cruelty laws) is so underfunded that a
1985 Government Office of Accounting
report found that half the research
facilities in California were never in
spected. The other half were inspected
on the average of once a year with viola
tion follow-ups erratic.
Research institutions are required by
law to make yearly reports of numbers
and species of animals. Stanford has told
the press that it holds about 90,000
animals, but its reports to the Depart
ment of Agriculture, obtained under the
Freedom of Information Act, seem to
show only new animals. In 1984 the num
ber of primates claimed was 1,257, for
example; in 1985, 128; and in 1986 only
56. Why the discrepancy?
Stanford has also failed to report, as
required by law, painful procedures on
fully conscious animals. We find from
the journals that many experiments have
little if anything to do with improving
human health.
The dean of the School of Medicine
last June urged associates to lobby the
USDA to weaken proposed regulations
under the Dole/Brown Bill, recently
enacted to give further protection to lab
animals.

Regulations cited as too stringent deal
with access to and inspection of records
and property, procurement of companion
animals from pounds, well-being of dogs
and primates, setting categories of animal
use based on levels of pain and distress,
and euthanasia.
Research Animal Facility 11, connected
by underground passages to RAF I and
the new Center for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine, would serve to hold animals
for research done primarily at CMGM.
The draft Environmental Impact Report
on RAF II fails to consider cumulative
impacts of these facilities on public health
and the environment as required by the
California Environmental Quality Act.
On inadequate evidence, it asserts there
would be no unmitigated effects from
radiation or biohazardous materials.
It states there are no potential hazards
from rDNA research for example, but
does not offer, as required by CEQA,
contrary expert opinion. It describes a
system of internal review panels for re
search procedures with infectious and
mutagenic agents without specifying the
agents concerned. The guidelines for such
panels are themselves badly out of date
and unenforceable. There are no outside
inspections.
At Stanford there has been research
for the Biological Warfare Defense pro
gram on pathogenic agents, including the
plague. Pathogens may be put down the
drains, be released in spore form into
the air or may be carried into the com
munity all of which are hazards of stag
gering scope and severity.
The research race rewards the Univer
sity with massive funding, tax-exempt
donations and patent licensing. Research
ers become paid advisors to biotech com
panies. And the public? The public has
the right to know just what is going on
next door.

An appeal of the county
use permit for Stanford's
Research Animal Facility
II filed by the Palo Alto
Humane Society last
spring has now blossomed
into a monstrously time

and money-consuming exercise in manip
ulation of California environmental law.
RAF II has been delayed approximately
10 months by an unnecessary Environ
mental Impact Report that will ulti
mately cost the University something in
excess of $700,000. The process involves
public hearings and document reviews,
carrying a hefty price tag for Santa Clara
County and the taxpayer.
Far outweighing all this is the ines
timable price of delayed medical research
and, one can reasonably assume, human
lives. Does the Humane Society represent
the interest of the "concerned" citizen
as they claim? Is their approach
reasonable? No.
On the contrary, I believe that the
Humane Society and others behind the
scene are abusing the system, causing
unwarranted, dangerous delays and mis
representing the case to the county and
to the public.
As project manager for Stanford on
this project, I have followed RAF II from
the early stagea of planning through the
various approval and appeal steps, and I
have seen the evolution of the Humane
Society position as it has opportunisti
cally adapted to suit the political climate.
