## High schools deficient

IN HIS FEB. 8 column, "Let stu
dents grow up," Nathan Hochman
is correct in trying to steer the
debate away from the question of how
to change the Western Culture require
ment to why the requirement, of any
of the distribution requirements, exists
at all.
But in focusing on the simple idea
that 18-year-olds are old enough to
choose their own courses, he ignores a
fundamental problem underlying the
existence of the requirements: the
failure of the American primary and
secondary educational system to
produce "educated" 18-year-olds.
It should not be the task of a uni
versity to provide a basic overview of
the great works and momentous events
of our history, that of Western Europe
or of any other part of the world.
And it should certainly not presume
to accomplish this in one course over
one year.
Only over the previous 12 years of
education can a student really acquire
the basis for his knowledge of his
nation's history and culture and of
Western and non-Western cultures.
The self-important tone of the
debate over the Western Culture re
quirements attests to the fact that
students are entering Stanford inade
quately educated.
Even to imply that Stanford stu
dents obtain much of their view of the
world from a one-year course here is
presumptuous; but more fundamental
ly, the fact that Stanford feels it needs
to provide such a course, and that
"Stanford undergrads have passively
accepted the University's intellectually
disparaging attitude" points to a kind
of unstated recognition, by both ad
ministration and students, that some
thing was lacking in what we were
taught prior to Stanford.

One civics course or survey of U.S.
history, one class in "world studies,"
no geography, pathetically little empha
sis on foreign languages — true, some
students take a few more classes than
this in high school.
But with requirements like these, it
is no wonder that the vast mcyority of
American 18-year-olds (Stanford fresh
men included) emerge from high school
sadly ignorant both of their own and
of others' cultures.
Yes, at 18 we have "the right to
vote for this nation's leaders, serve in
its armed forces and drive on its high
ways."
Yet also at 18 students should not
have to be introduced to Plato, Aris
totle and the French Revolution.
And the whole idea of needing some
kind of required course at a university
on "Cultures, Ideas and Values" to let
students know of the importance and
contributions of other cultures would
be ridiculous if students had already
been taught about the history of the
various regions of the world and the
contributions to American history of so
many different peoples.
Am I asking too much of the Ameri
can public education system? I don't
think so.
I'm not talking about churning out
brilliant historians and philosophers.
What I am talking about is what most
other industrialized nations consider an
"adequate" education.
We all have heard the stories of
foreign students who know U.S. his
tory better than American students, of
high schoolers turning to the wrong
side of the globe in search of Pakistan
or Chile (or France or Kansas).
The bottom line is that these other
nations, none of which have perfect
school systems, feel confident that by
the age of 18 or after 12 or so years

of schooling, their citizens are well
educated enough in a variety of differ
ent areas that those who go on to
universities can devote their time to
pursuits other than completing their
"general education."
Given that our elementary and high
schools do not instill us with this kind
of confidence, should Stanford require
that students devote some of their
time here to certain courses, in an
effort to make up for a few of the
missing elements in their earlier
schooling?
I have mixed feelings on the amount
that can actually be accomplished this
way, but it is a good question.
My point is that Stanford is not
asking it.
If Stanford is really concerned about
the quality of education its students
are receiving about their culture and
about a broad range of subjects, then
just a little of the enormous amount of
energy being devoted in its preoccupa
tion with its "Great Debate" should be
shifted toward the ultimately much
more important issue of the failings of
the American primary and secondary
educational system: of what Stanford
freshmen should know but don't, and
why they don't know it.

at all.
But in focusing on the simple idea
that 18-year-olds are old enough to
choose their own courses, he ignores a
fundamental problem underlying the
existence of the requirements: the
failure of the American primary and
secondary educational system to
produce "educated" 18-year-olds.
It should not be the task of a uni
versity to provide a basic overview of
the great works and momentous events
of our history, that of Western Europe
or of any other part of the world.
And it should certainly not presume
to accomplish this in one course over
one year.
Only over the previous 12 years of
education can a student really acquire
the basis for his knowledge of his
nation's history and culture and of
Western and non-Western cultures.
The self-important tone of the
debate over the Western Culture re
quirements attests to the fact that
students are entering Stanford inade
quately educated.
Even to imply that Stanford stu
dents obtain much of their view of the
world from a one-year course here is
presumptuous; but more fundamental
ly, the fact that Stanford feels it needs
to provide such a course, and that
"Stanford undergrads have passively
accepted the University's intellectually
disparaging attitude" points to a kind
of unstated recognition, by both ad
ministration and students, that some
thing was lacking in what we were
taught prior to Stanford.

One civics course or survey of U.S.
history, one class in "world studies,"
no geography, pathetically little empha
sis on foreign languages — true, some
students take a few more classes than
this in high school.
But with requirements like these, it
is no wonder that the vast mcyority of
American 18-year-olds (Stanford fresh
men included) emerge from high school
sadly ignorant both of their own and
of others' cultures.
Yes, at 18 we have "the right to
vote for this nation's leaders, serve in
its armed forces and drive on its high
ways."
Yet also at 18 students should not
have to be introduced to Plato, Aris
totle and the French Revolution.
And the whole idea of needing some
kind of required course at a university
on "Cultures, Ideas and Values" to let
students know of the importance and
contributions of other cultures would
be ridiculous if students had already
been taught about the history of the
various regions of the world and the
contributions to American history of so
many different peoples.
Am I asking too much of the Ameri
can public education system? I don't
think so.
I'm not talking about churning out
brilliant historians and philosophers.
What I am talking about is what most
other industrialized nations consider an
"adequate" education.
We all have heard the stories of
foreign students who know U.S. his
tory better than American students, of
high schoolers turning to the wrong
side of the globe in search of Pakistan
or Chile (or France or Kansas).
The bottom line is that these other
nations, none of which have perfect
school systems, feel confident that by
the age of 18 or after 12 or so years

of schooling, their citizens are well
educated enough in a variety of differ
ent areas that those who go on to
universities can devote their time to
pursuits other than completing their
"general education."
Given that our elementary and high
schools do not instill us with this kind
of confidence, should Stanford require
that students devote some of their
time here to certain courses, in an
effort to make up for a few of the
missing elements in their earlier
schooling?
I have mixed feelings on the amount
that can actually be accomplished this
way, but it is a good question.
My point is that Stanford is not
asking it.
If Stanford is really concerned about
the quality of education its students
are receiving about their culture and
about a broad range of subjects, then
just a little of the enormous amount of
energy being devoted in its preoccupa
tion with its "Great Debate" should be
shifted toward the ultimately much
more important issue of the failings of
the American primary and secondary
educational system: of what Stanford
freshmen should know but don't, and
why they don't know it.
