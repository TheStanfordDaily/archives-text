## Wisdom eclipses fame 
### 
WHO THE HELL are Scott
Garner, Mark Mulkerin and
Raj Pruthi? Obviously they
think they are somebody to believe
that they can question the worth of
another human being.
Who the hell are they to tell me
that I cannot admire or respect an
individual simply because he or she is
not as nationally reknown as past
Commencement speakers at Stanford?
Who the hell are they to tell me
that Robert Maynard, because he is
black, is not qualified to serve as a t
role model for all Stanford seniors?
Oh, I understand. Whites can serve as
role models for people of color, but
people of color cannot serve as ex
emplars of excellence for whites. Hell,
if that happened, racism just might
deteriorate.
Who the hell are they to tell me
that Maynard would not have the
"wisdom and encouragement" required
to be an effective speaker?
Is not a Commencement speaker

someone who can draw upon life ex
perience to share with graduating
seniors what they need to be conscious
of when they leave school and continue
the process of creating and defining
themselves? Or do we honestly believe
that a Commencement speaker is
simply the most nationally prominent
figure?
As editor and publisher of a major
metropolitan paper, Maynard can
certainly share valuable insights with
graduating seniors. And obviously that
is why he was chosen by University
President Donald Kennedy and the
selection committee.
I recommend that you listen care
fully to Maynard's Commencement
address. Perhaps after you learn who
the hell he is, when you are absolved
of some of your ignorance, it will not
be so discomforting to you that an
"unknown" black was selected to speak
at your graduation.
