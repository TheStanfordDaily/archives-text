# 'Parafaculty' degrading to lecturers
## 
### 
I am writing to say that I am down
right sick of being referred to as
"parafaculty" by Dean of Undergradu
ate Studies Norman Wessels and now,
it seems, by The Daily itself. I refer
specifically to a Feb. 2 article on West
ern Culture.
A paramedic does not have a medical
degree; a paralegal does not have a law
degree; but we in the Western Culture
program have the same level of train
ing and the same degree as any other
member of the Stanford faculty.
In the history track, teaching duties
include leading four two-hour discus
sion sections a week, in which we
teach an average of 16 students each.

That means over 60 papers, exams and
other assignments to grade each quar
ter.
Few people have more direct and
intensive contact with the undergradu
ates than the people who teach in the
Western Culture program.
Furthermore, most of us are in
volved with this University in count
less ways, either through freshman
advising or numerous other activities
to which we willingly give our time
and energy.
The label "parafaculty" is denigrat
ing and inappropriate.
