## Basketball guest entertainer tells 'my life as a tree' 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
The call came at one in the
afternoon.
"Hi, this is Brendan Kelly, the
Stanford Tree. How would you
like to be the Tree at halftime of
today's basketball game?"
"The Tree?" My heart raced.
Sure I'd seen the Tree before —
seen it chase Dollies and little kids
at basketball games, seen it dance
crazily on the sidelines during
football season. But to be the
Tree? I'd never even tried being
shrubbery. Was I ready to don a
nine-foot tree costume and repre
sent our school as a mascot? "I'd
love to," I said.
"Great," said Kelly. "Meet me
at 2:15 today A.T.S."
"A.T.S?"
"Sorry," he said, "Band lingo:
At the Shak."
Which is how I came to be sit
ting on a broken-down couch in
the middle of the Band Shak on
Saturday afternoon, waiting for
Kelly to come and teach me how
to be the Tree.
The Band Shak is a homey
place, carefully trashed for a quar
ter century by generations of
Stanford Bands. The Shak stands
across from Encina Gym — the
sign that says "Child Develop
ment and Mental Retardation
Center" over the door and a paint
ing of a horn are the only clues
that this is not any typical build
ing.
Inside the Shak, the former
home of Stanford's ROTC, many
of the Band members have begun
to assemble haphazardly. Open
instrument cases line the floor;
tubas hang on the wall. In a side
room — the drum room — lies a
pile of drums and drumsticks just
waiting to be played.
Most striking are the signs
nailed to the walls, stolen from
roads, factories, colleges,
landmarks and every other strata
of society by years of Band mem
bers. "Gerald R. Ford Birthplace,"
proclaims one road sign (he was
born in Omaha!); "Clean Dirt
Wanted," says another. A large
blue sign says: "Stop! If you have

sick pigs at home or brought sick
or dead pigs for disease diagnosis
please do not enter this swine
barn." The walls are literally cov
ered with dozens of signs — in
cluding many from UC-Berkeley.
At 2:20 p.m., Kelly shows up.
He doesn't look very tree-like, and
he doesn't seem nearly as carefree
and goofy as the Tree's on-court
persona. Kelly, a senior civil en
gineering major, tried out to be
come the Tree last year on a dare.
"I went to tryouts at the Shak
and basically went crazy. I jumped
on furniture, ran outside, ran
back inside — they finally just
told me to calm down. That night
at 2 a.m. the Band showed up at
my door playing 'All I Ever
Wanted Was to Be With You,' and
I said 'Uh oh.' "

Moments later,
however, he has
been ... trans
formed into the 9-
foot wisecracking
timber we know
so well.

"Let's go," he says. Climbing a
ladder, he brings down the Tree
costume from a loft. The costume
is limp and doesn't look like the
Tree I'm used to. Moments later,
however, he has slipped into the
costume, and the mild-mannered
senior who was standing before
me has been transformed into the
nine-foot wisecracking timber
mascot we know so well.
After I don the trademark white
hat of the Band and pick up a
pair of drumsticks, we head out
for the five-minute stroll to the
game. Walking along, I am Filled
with questions I want to ask Kelly
— questions about being the Tree
— but somehow I feel silly talking

to foliage. We are walking in the
middle of the street. "I think
we're about to be run over," I
offer. Who knows how much
visibility he's got in that costume?
"When you're nine feet tall, cars
stop for you," he says. And they
do. He waves an arm at the driver
of the car, and the man waves
back amicably. I cross two more
streets with this walking police
barricade, still getting smiles and
waves from all the drivers.
We enter Maples Pavilion. (A
white hat and drumsticks will get
you in for free when you're
walking next to the Tree.) Kelly
goes off to perform his Tree-like
duties. I stand with the Band.
By the time the game starts, I
am a bundle of nerves. Kelly is a
great Tree, gliding easily around
Maples to entertain the afternoon
crowd. What will I do when I get
inside the Tree? Will I be stupid?
Will they boo me? Will they throw
things? I am shaking.
Soon after the opening tip-off
Kelly comes and sits with me in
the stands. He has removed the
costume and is covered with
sweat. "Long pre-game," he mut
ters while he drinks a soda. Stan
ford starts out the game poorly,
but by the middle of the first half
leads by 10 points. Below us
stands the Arizona State band.
Dressed in school yellow, they
play boring songs and chant "You
you" whenever a Stanford player
commits a foul or a turnover.
"Let's go over some of the finer
points of being the Tree," says
Kelly. "First of all, have fun. Re
member, nobody will know that
it's you in there. Second, don't
let anyone give you any crap.
You're nine-feet tall and don't
have to be intimidated by anyone.
Sometimes obnoxious 12-year
olds will come over and start tug
ging on your costume."
What about the students?
"The students will largely ig
nore the Tree," he says, "although
they don't boo me anymore. It's
the little kids and old folks who'll
be your best bet."
"There're a couple of don'ts,"
he continues, "Don't touch any
police officers. Don't touch any of

the players. And don't touch the
Dollies. They move fast and kick
a lot — you're liable to get hurt."
With seven minutes left in the
first half, we go into a back room
to get me into the Tree costume.
First I put on the pants, which
are made of cloth and foam and
look tangentially like bark. They
are very baggy, and are cinched
around my waist with a small
nylon belt which is pulled way
too tight.
The top half of the Tree is made
of soft foam rubber supported by
a long plastic tube. I get on my
knees and wriggle into the top of
the Tree. There are two arm holes
with sleeves that I barely manage
to find.
I stand up. The costume is top
heavy and seems to sway danger
ously back and forth. Kelly pulls
the Tree's shorts up over the
middle of the costume. I don't
feel like a tree. I feel like a dork.
Kelly is giggling at me. "I've
never seen the Tree from this
point of view," he says. "Let's go
outside so you can get a feel for
the costume." We go up the stairs
and out the door behind Maples.
I keep forgetting to duck down
and hit the top of my costume
against the ceiling. I'm not used
to being nine-feet tall. Standing
alone outside I see my reflection
in the window. For the first time,
I realize that I am wearing the
Tree costume. I begin dancing
around; I am about to go out and
make a fool of myself in front of
five thousand people. I want to
go home.
Kelly comes back and watches
me dance around. "You look
great," he says. I am sure he's
just saying that to make me feel
good. Uncoordinated people
should not be allowed to wear tall,
bulky tree costumes. "There's one
minute left in the half," he says.
"Stanford is up by 20 points. Go
down the stairs and stand behind
the drummer. When the first half
ends ... go crazy." He leaves me
alone inside the Tree costume to
face five thousand crazy fans. I
want my mother.
