Stanford is very fortunate that
Chinua Achebe is speaking here
tomorrow. He has been a prolific
writer over the last 30 years, and
an active and outspoken partici
pant in Nigeria's political life. For
newcomers to his work, his first
novel, "Things Fall Apart," is a
fine introduction.
"Things Fall Apart" is a classic
that rewards and grows richer
with rereading and time. Set in
the land of Igbo (to which group
Achebe was born), the first par
agraph introduces a complex
world, about to be sundered by
the interplay of its own charac
teristics and those of the vastly
different European society.
Achebe understands and ap
preciates the traditional world too
much to idealize it. Stress and
strains exist among both social
groups and individuals. Indeed,
the novel centers on generational
conflict. Okonkwo, the main char
acter, who comes from the Igbo
village of Umuofia, is ashamed of
his gentle father, a failure in Igbo
terms. Okonkwo's entire life is
driven by the desire to overcome
this family stigma.
His friend Obierika tries to tell
Okonkwo that the essence of any
social order is to achieve balance,
not always to excel. Okonkwo's
failure to understand this advice
distorts his relationship with his
own son, leading him into viola
tions of Igbo custom as well as
to great success. Ultimately, in
attempting to defend his society
against the European invader,
this failure pushes Okonkwo into
an act that tragically condemns
him, according to his own
society's code, to sepnrntion from
that which his life has been lived
— and lost — in an effort to
attain.
Yet Obierika, who warned
Okonkwo, in pronouncing his

epitaph condemns the uncom
prehending brutality of the
European invader and recognizes
Okonkwo's great worth even in
final exile. As he says to the
Englishman: "That man
(Okonkwo) was one of the
greatest men of Umuofia."
Achebe's novel is a fascinating
view of a society different from
our own and provokes reflection
upon such accepted categories as
"politics," "the state" and
"religion." Through Achebe's fic
tion, the reader realizes that
societies with very different un
derstandings of these basic terms
have worked very well. Yet such
a cultural appreciation should not
overshadow Achebe's literary
achievement. From the first par
agraph, this novel is written with
a descriptive simplicity of lan
guage. Achebe's narrative style in
terweaves parables and tales, and
it moves deftly back and forth in
tense to represent a sense of time
that is fragmented in a way to
which we are accustomed while
being more closed and more free
than the linear.
Achebe's achievement is both

testament and tribute to the ar
tistic strengths of an oral culture
that did not write down the word
but understood it thoroughly as
an artistic medium. This book
remains a superb example of the
transmutation of the strengths of
oral art into the written form of
the novel at the hands of a fine
artist rooted in both traditions.
Artistically, "Things Fall
Apart" depicts not only the dis
integration of the old ways, as the
title, taken from Yeats, suggests.
More strikingly, it represents
Africa's enormous strength and
resilience. This novel demon
strates that the societies of Africa,
transmuted and often distorted by
the experience and legacy of
foreign invasion and domination,
have nevertheless not been fun
damentally defeated.
After all, its traditional
strengths and more recent history
have produced an artist like
Chinua Achebe.
