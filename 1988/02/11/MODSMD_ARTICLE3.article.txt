# Student groups criticize lack of office spaces
## 
### Matthew Poppe 
Despite the constant construction
taking place on the Stanford campus,
voluntary student organizations still have
to fight for space.
According to Michael Jackson, associ
ate dean for campus affairs, only one
sixth of the 288 student groups currently
registered with Student Organization
Services have office space, and the office
spaces that are available are often inad
equate.
The Stanford Debate Team, for exam
ple, shares a small office with the Stan
ford Macintosh Users Group in the Knoll
Annex. According to Mark Lemley, cap
tain of the debate team, it is "impossible"
to hold meetings in the office because of

its size and poor location. He said the
team uses it "mainly for storage."
Prompted by student complaints, a spe
cial committee has been formed to rec
ommend changes in the allocation of of
fice spaces in a report to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons later this year.
Michael Ramsey-Perez, SOS coordina
tor, laughed when asked about the lack
of office space. "[The lack of student
office space] isn't news!" he said.
"There's always been a problem."
SOS provides offices for about 40
groups in the Old Firehouse and the
Knoll Annex. Some organizations find
office space elsewhere — such as in the
Old Union Clubhouse or at the Public
Service Center — while others work
through the ethnic activity centers. Most

organizations, though, remain unhoused.
Jackson explained that while the Uni
versity recognizes that student groups
need more office space, concrete recom
mendations have not yet been drafted.
"Right now we're trying to get a better
understanding of what our needs are,"
Jackson said.
Before any recommendations can be
made, said Jackson, the University needs
to further determine the extent of the
problem.
"How much individual office space do
we need? How much generic office space?
How much is that going to cost? How
are we going to provide it?" asked Jack
son.
To answer these questions and others,
Lyons formed the Committee on Student

Organization Spaces, co-chaired by
Ramsey-Perez and Jackson.
The committee presented a report to
Lyons in January, reviewing the available
spaces, assessing necessary repairs and
renovations and making recommenda
tions for uses of the existing student
activity spaces. Lyons rejected the report,
however, for reasons of "clarity," accord
ing to Jackson.
Jackson said the committee needs to
"try to develop . .. the information so
that it's in the best form possible" for
presentation to higher level administra
tors.
Junior Leonard Adler, a member of
the Council of Presidents and the Com
mittee on Student Organization Spaces,
met with Lyons Tuesday and said that

Lyons is committed to solving the prob
lem and has asked that the report be
completed "by the end of the year."
Specifically, the report will make rec
ommendations about the distribution of
student offices throughout the campus.
For example, "the Women's Center
should not be located in the Toyon Eating
Clubs, Adler said. "It should be closer
to the center of campus."
Adler said the report is supposed to
set guidelines for the use of all student
office space "for the next seven or eight
years," but the report in its present form
is not adequate for such long-term use.
In April the ASSU will set up a com
mittee to accept group requests for office
gue their cause in the senate.
Although the senate can over
turn the COP veto with a two
thirds vote, Durkin said the sen
ate will probably accept the COP
order to provide reasons for the
recommendations at the next sen
ate meeting Feb. 23.
"Every item cannot go through
the senate," Mahoney said, adding
that the recommendations are
sound because the committee has
interviewed students and the
decision-making process was open
to suggestions.
Senator Miguel Marquez, a
junior, said that although written
reasons "would have been
helpful," they are "out of
tradition" and would make senate
meetings too long.
The Tuesday night meeting
took three hours, Marquez said,
and the senate only debated eight
budget items.
"Somebody has to take a close
look at the recommendations,"
Marquez said. "We neglect other
issues by debating (the appropri
ations) too long. We have to trust
somebody (to make recommenda
tions), and the appropriations
committee did their work."

Before any recommendations can be
made, said Jackson, the University needs
to further determine the extent of the
problem.
"How much individual office space do
we need? How much generic office space?
How much is that going to cost? How
are we going to provide it?" asked Jack
son.
To answer these questions and others,
Lyons formed the Committee on Student

Organization Spaces, co-chaired by
Ramsey-Perez and Jackson.
The committee presented a report to
Lyons in January, reviewing the available
spaces, assessing necessary repairs and
renovations and making recommenda
tions for uses of the existing student
activity spaces. Lyons rejected the report,
however, for reasons of "clarity," accord
ing to Jackson.
Jackson said the committee needs to
"try to develop . .. the information so
that it's in the best form possible" for
presentation to higher level administra
tors.
Junior Leonard Adler, a member of
the Council of Presidents and the Com
mittee on Student Organization Spaces,
met with Lyons Tuesday and said that

Lyons is committed to solving the prob
lem and has asked that the report be
completed "by the end of the year."
Specifically, the report will make rec
ommendations about the distribution of
student offices throughout the campus.
For example, "the Women's Center
should not be located in the Toyon Eating
Clubs, Adler said. "It should be closer
to the center of campus."
Adler said the report is supposed to
set guidelines for the use of all student
office space "for the next seven or eight
years," but the report in its present form
is not adequate for such long-term use.
In April the ASSU will set up a com
mittee to accept group requests for office
gue their cause in the senate.
Although the senate can over
turn the COP veto with a two
thirds vote, Durkin said the sen
ate will probably accept the COP
order to provide reasons for the
recommendations at the next sen
ate meeting Feb. 23.
"Every item cannot go through
the senate," Mahoney said, adding
that the recommendations are
sound because the committee has
interviewed students and the
decision-making process was open
to suggestions.
Senator Miguel Marquez, a
junior, said that although written
reasons "would have been
helpful," they are "out of
tradition" and would make senate
meetings too long.
The Tuesday night meeting
took three hours, Marquez said,
and the senate only debated eight
budget items.
"Somebody has to take a close
look at the recommendations,"
Marquez said. "We neglect other
issues by debating (the appropri
ations) too long. We have to trust
somebody (to make recommenda
tions), and the appropriations
committee did their work."
