# Africa: continent of rich talent

"Who knows? Africa may yet
have something to teach us all."
— Geoffrey Wheatcroft
Thanks to writers like-Chinua
Achebe, Americans and Europe
ans are begining to recognize that
Africa does indeed have some
thing to teach us all.
But we cannot genuinely appre
ciate the African artists who are
slowly finding Western audiences
without first re-evaluating most
of our present "knowledge" about
Africa, gleaned from racist fables
and half-truths. Jablow and Ham
mond remark that "Western
literature" concerning Africa
"provides the record of the (Eu
ropean) fantasy, and because it is
a lurid fantasy, it has resulted in
a sensational literature." Non-
African readers share the blame
for the immense diffusion of
misinformation. We have believed
much and investigated little. On
occasion, we have deliberately
misread texts to maintain a se
cure, Eurocentric view of the
world. "Heart of Darkness,"
though plainly about a strange
and dangerous European lust, is
too easily (and too often) taken
to be an illustration of African
savagery.
Our preconceptions make
reading literature by Africans a
surprising as well as enlightening
oxperience. These writers chal
lenge our assumptions and disap
point our expectations. They
depict no savages. They set "un
civilized" African behavior in logi
cal and historical contexts. They
present "heroic" white figures —
missionaries, explorers, etc. — in
a new light, or omit them altoget
her. "Tarzan?" they say. "Never
heard of him."
Of course, Chinua Achebe, Wole
Soyinka, Yambo Ouloguem and
others do not present Africa as a
Utopia. They write honestly and
poignantly about what one critic

calls the "identity crisis and
alienation" afflicting Africans
who must incorporate a legacy of
racial discrimination, colonialism,
and rapid urbanization and indus
trialization into a sense of self.
Achebe's "No Longer at Ease"
and "Things Fall Apart" are clas
sic statements of the difficulty,
perhaps impossibility, of choosing
between old ways and new. Femi
Osofisan's play, "Farewell to a
Cannibal Rage," given its world
premiere at Stanford last year, is
another moving story of coping
with divisions in contemporary
Africa: village or city, tradition or
individuality, love or honor.
Critic Nalova Lyonga praises
playwright A.A. Aidoo for giving
voice to African women. Aidoo's
"Anowa" explores issues through
the perspective of a "woman
centered vision." Her "particular
achievement (in "Anowa") is to
bring to the forefront both the
passionate disorder of the
household and the passionate dis
order in the body politic."
Ultimately, the two disorders
are united in the nearly un
bearable memory of the theft of
generations during the trans-
Atlantic slave trade. Lyonga tells
us that for Aidoo the African
tragedy is "the sense of horror in
the violation of the body and of
the womb of a woman." Aidoo

writes simply, "Of course she suf
fered, the African mother. Allah,
how she has suffered. How much,
and for how long."
Nadine Gordimer and Athol
Fugard head another group of
African writers who are surely en
during feelings of "identity crisis
and alienation." Their use of
literature in the struggle against
apartheid is courageous and ad
mirable. How to assess their work
as African literature, however, is
problematic. It requires another
time and another place and, per
haps, another Africa.
The best of African literature,
like the best of any literature,
introduces us to new people and
situations and reaquaints us with
the universal pains and small
pleasures that are part of being
human. Through it we can touch
the old wound of the slave trade
and feel the sense of loss as if it
were still, physically, fresh. We
can understand the valor of fight
ing against colonialism and the
confusion of independence. We see
again the effects of rapid change
on domestic and social relation
ships. Tracing this literature back
to its roots in the African oral
tradition, we see the spjne rich
ness of thought applied to other
issues.
Africa has always taught us. We
have only recently begun to listen.
