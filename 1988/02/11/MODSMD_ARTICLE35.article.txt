## Sailors down south 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
Always in search of
sunshine and
tough competition,
the Stanford
sailing team drove
to San Diego last
weekend to find

fine sailing conditions and a pair
of sixth place finishes at the first
two regattas of the Southern Cal
ifornia Collegiate Sailing Series.
In many respects, this
weekend's event was like a non
league game for the Cardinal
sailors. Because the series is sailed
to select a champion from South
ern California, Stanford traveled
south primarily to practice for the
upcoming Northern Series while
enjoying the sunshine and ocean
breeze.
With that in mind, Stanford
sent three younger teams to San
Diego and gave its senior sailors
the weekend off. For the sailors
who will lead the Cardinal next
year, this weekend provided a first
taste of competition against some
of the best teams in California.
In the end, UC-Irvine came out
of the series ahead, with Orange
Coast and San Diego State sailing
close behind. Six more regattas
will be held before a Southern
champion is determined.
With steady breezes and easy
courses, Stanford's biggest prob
lem at the regatta was inconsis

tency. Between appearances at
the front of the pack, Stanford
scored several disappointing
finishes which brought their over
all scores below those of the ex
perienced southern teams.
In Saturday's races, Stanford's
varsity boat was sailed by sopho
more Alvin Sargent and freshman
Sharon Flom, who finished eighth
in A-Division, and by junior Ev
Rend and freshman Sarah Gan
nett, who ended up third in B-
Division. Sophomore Robert
Brown and Heidi Park sailed a
second boat to 10th place in A-
Division.
On Sunday, Rend and Gannett
sailed the varsity boat to sixth
place in A-Division, while Brown
and Park took it to fifth place in
B-Division. Sargent and Flom
took second place in the junior
varsity fleet.
"Overall, I was pleased with the
regatta results," Stanford Coach
Blake Middleton said. "We did
well in some races, and terribly
in others, but most of all, our
up-and-coming teams learned a
lot about varsity racing. I think
we're in good shape for next
year."
In the coming months, the en
tire Stanford team will be fighting
it out in the Northern Series that
begins when Stanford hosts the
first two regattas during the
weekend after next.
"This weekend was great prac
tice," Gannett said.
