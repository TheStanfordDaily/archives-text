# Hoops looks to slay Cougars

### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
MOSCOW, Idaho — It's cold and
bleak, and there are remnants of
snow on the ground here. Normally,
these circumstances, combined with
a streaky Washington State basket
ball team, might be enough to cool
off the Stanford Cardinal.

But tonight the surging Cardinal team has that
good old incentive behind it: revenge.
The Cougars (10-9 overall, 5-5 in the Pacific 10
Conference) are the only Pac-10 team to have
defeated Stanford at home this season, and the
Cardinal players would like to get that win back.
"They definitely took a game away that we
thought we had won," said Stanford center Greg
Butler. "That's a game we have to get back on the
road."
It is also a game that could determine whether
Stanford (15-7, 7-4) simply had a career week last
week, or whether the Cardinal is actually a con
tender. Coach Mike Montgomery's team, which up
set then-No. 1 Arizona last Thursday and trounced
Arizona State Saturday, is currently all alone in
second place in the Pac-10.
"The position we're in now is that we have control
of our own destiny," said Cardinal point guard
Terry Taylor. "We don't have to worry about what
any other team does; we just have to take care of
ourselves."
In order to win tonight's game, however, Taylor
and company first have to take care of Cougar
guard David Sanders. The 6-foot-2 Sanders had a
spectacular game in Washington State's 70-68 over
time victory at Maples Pavilion Jan. 16. He played
43 of 45 minutes and scored 32 points to bring the
Cougars back from a 12-point deficit midway
through the second half.
"We know he's a real streaky shooter," Taylor
said. "When he starts to hit a few, he'll put up
anything he gets his hands on."
And Sanders will put those shots up from any
distance. He made seven out of 11 three-pointers
against Stanford and had another hot game Satur
day when he scored 26 against Washington.
Stanford has had a couple of hot players of its
own lately. Cardinal center Howard Wright was
named Pac-10 Player of the Week for his stellar
efforts against Arizona and Arizona State. The 6-
foot-8 San Diego native asserted himself as one of
the premier big men in the Pac-10 by scoring 42
points and pulling down 19 rebounds in the two
Stanford victories.
In addition, Cardinal guard Todd Lichti came out
of a self-professed slump at just the right time.
Lichti scored 15 second half points in the Arizona
upset and sparked the 96-63 blowout of Arizona
State.
Lichti will move into fourth place on the Stanford
all-time-scoring List -tonight-with his first point. He
is tied with Tom Dose (1962-64) at 1,441 points.
