# Road to NCAAs is via Moscow

MOSCOW, Idaho — On Tuesday
Cardinal center Greg Butler said, "We
have a legitimate chance to win 20
games and make it to the NCAAs."
He said it with a straight face.

Yesterday, Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery was accosted by a local
television station reporter as soon as
he got off the plane in Spokane, Wash.
Yesterday CBS Sports filmed a
short segment about Stanford's upset
of Arizona.
The Cardinal men's basketball pro
gram is boldly going where it has
rarely gone before.
In order to get there, however, the
Cardinal will have to win on the road.
Five of Stanford's remaining seven

Pacific 10 Conference games are in
opposing teams' gyms. So far this
season, the Cardinal is 1-3 on the
road in conference play. Last year its
conference away record was 2-7. So
before Stanford fans get too excited,
they should remember history.
Of course, unlike last year's 15-13
team, the Cardinal already has 15
wins, with at least eight games left
to play (including the Pac-10 tourna
ment).
Throughout this season Mont
gomery has stressed extension to his
players. When Stanford gets a lead,
Montgomery doesn't want his players
to think about keeping it, he wants
them to extend it.
Now that his players have earned
second place in the Pac-10 and media
exposure, they need to extend it. Win
ning on the road would do it.

Collegiate athletics takes young
men and women to such exciting
places. Like Pullman, Wash. And it's
so much fun getting here.

First, we wait at the airport. The
soap opera in the lounge features a
young tart wearing a Stanford Uni
versity sweatshirt. Hmmmm.
Next, we wait on the plane. An un
furled Time magazine features a Stan
ford student on skates on the cover.
After a two-hour plane ride, the
Cardinal players board the team bus
singing "It's the end of the world as
we know it, Pullman, Washington."
Unfortunately, Pullman is still a
two-hour drive away. But we do get
to go through some very inspiring
towns, like Steptoe and Colfax.
And instead of pulling into Pullman
we pull into Moscow, Idaho. That's
where the hotel is. The best part is
watching Moscow folk react to mul
tiple 6-foot-8 persons.
As Adam Fogelson, the voice of
KZSU says, "They react like nobody's
ever ordered a Big Mac in that manner
before."
Yes, at least there is a McDonald's
here. Even better, there's a joint called
Karl Marx Pizza. In Moscow, get it?
It's 10:45 p.m. now, and Mac's
closes soon.
