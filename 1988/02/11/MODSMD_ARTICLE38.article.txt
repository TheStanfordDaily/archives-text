# Football signs 23 recruits
## RB Milburn heads list for upcoming season 
### Scott Roth Staff writer 
Stanford football scored a major victory
in the national recruiting war yesterday as
tailback Glyn Milburn announced he is
headed for the Farm.
Milburn was one of 23 players signed
yesterday by Stanford as prep stars all over
America were finally allowed to sign letters
of intent. Milburn, a 5-foot-9, 170-pound
runner from Santa Monica, Calif., topped
a class that coach Jack Elway called "a
tribute to the Stanford family" and "a per
fect complement to last year's nationally
ranked class."
Milburn, whose uncle is Olympic gold
medalist Rod Milburn, is already being
likened to former Stanford All-American
and Minnesota Vikings star Darrin Nelson.
Milburn rolled up impressive statistics in
his last season at Santa Monica High
School. This season, the speedster rushed
for 2,178 yards and 39 touchdowns. Both
numbers led the state, and the 39 touch
downs placed him seventh in the country
for touchdowns scored.
This season, Milburn had nine consecu
tive games in which he rushed for over
200 yards, including a stunning 367-yard

effort against Edison High in Huntington
Beach.
"Everything fits into place," Milburn told
the Times Tribune Monday night. "The
academics are great, the football program
is competitive, and there is a great social;
life there."
Milburn, who chose the Cardinal over
Oklahoma and Notre Dame, is considered:
by numerous high school recruiting experts:
to be a bona fide star. USA Today named:
him a second-team Ail-American, and.'
Super Prep All-Far West named him their
offensive player of the year.
Despite his small size, Stanford coaches
say that Milburn is an excellent inside'
runner and a superb receiver. In 352 rush
ing attempts this year, Milburn ran inside
65 percent of the time. He also plans to
compete on the Stanford track team.
Milburn is joined by several other notable
recruits. Among others, the Cardinal
landed quarterback Steve Smith of Folsom,
La., and defensive back Jason Atwood of
Lander, Wyo. Both Smith and Atwood were
named to USA Today's honorable mention
All-America squad, and Atwood, a 6-foot-2,
222-pounder was named Player of the Year
in Wyoming.
