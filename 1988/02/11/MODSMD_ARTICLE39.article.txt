fencing, even though the men's and
women's teams will not be compet

members of the teams will be fencing
for spots on the American Junior

Olympics team.

many of the nation's top high school fencers. Men's
coach Zoran Tulum and women's coach Sherry Pos

hopes of recruiting new talent for Stanford's pro
gram.
Representing the men's team will be freshman
Stan Brobston and sophomores Jim Farrell and
Rich Reader. The women's team plans to send fresh
man Olivia Judson and sophomore Elisabeth Spil
