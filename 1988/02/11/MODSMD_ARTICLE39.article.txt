# Fencers vie for Junior Olympics spots
## 
### David Earnest Staff writer 
This weekend will be one of the most
important of the year for Stanford
fencing, even though the men's and
women's teams will not be compet
ing. Starting this Saturday, five
members of the teams will be fencing
for spots on the American Junior

Olympics team.
The competition, being held in Cleveland, features
many of the nation's top high school fencers. Men's
coach Zoran Tulum and women's coach Sherry Pos
thumus are both traveling to the tournament with
hopes of recruiting new talent for Stanford's pro
gram.
Representing the men's team will be freshman
Stan Brobston and sophomores Jim Farrell and
Rich Reader. The women's team plans to send fresh
man Olivia Judson and sophomore Elisabeth Spil
man.
In order to qualify for the Junior Olympics, an
individual must be under age 20. As a result, many
high school athletes participate in the qualifying
tournament, giving college coaches an unequaled
opportunity to scout prospective talent.
Brobston will fence in the foil event. In his first
year at Stnnford, Brobston has spent most of the
season trading off bouts in the third slot on the

foil team with senior Craig Ring.
But Brobston is one of the most
experienced fencers on the team,
having fenced since eighth grade.
Last year, Brobston competed in
the Junior Olympics. He is the'
only one of this year's fencers to
have done so.
Farrell qualified for the sabre
event, in spite of the fact that he
has only sLx months experience
fencing in that event. Reader also
qualified despite a lack of exper
ience. He started fencing with the
epee last fall.
Both coaches and fencers
remain cautious about this
weekend's competition.
"It's hard for us to judge the
competition, simply because we
have never fenced against them,"
Reader said. "We're not sure what
to expect."
Tulum said: "Our fencers are
not in contention. Most of our
fencers do not have the years of
experience it takes to be compet

itive in the national tournaments.
But it's a good experience for
them to fence against the best
fencers from the East."
Both Tulum and Posthumus
view this weekend as an impor
tant step in the process of rebuild
ing Stanford's fencing program.
Tulum, a first-year coach coming
off two succesful seasons as an
assistant at Harvard, views this
recruiting season as vital for in
creasing the number of experi
enced fencers on the team. With
more experienced fencers, he said
he feels he can build a team ca
pable of competing with the
powers of the East Coast.
Both coaches are faced with the
added complication of trying to
recruit without offering scholar
ships. Many experienced fencers
choose the Eastern schools over
Stanford because of their finan
cially sound fencing programs.
"The alumni support of those
fencing programs is enough to
support their recruiting efforts
without scholarships," said
Tulum. "All we can offer a pro
spective team member is good

weather."
While the coaches may be
looking for fresh talent for their
teams, the weekend's focus will
be the fencing. Both Tulum and
Posthumus see the tournament
as a primer for the Western
Regional Championships, to be
held the first and second
weekends of March.
"I feel more comfortable this
year with Zoran being available
to help me," Brobston said. "Both
coaches are really encouraging. I
feel that now that I am relaxed,
I'll be able to concentrate entirely
on my fencing."
Farrell echoes Brobston's praise
of Coach Tulum. "It's going to be
a long weekend for us, but I feel
more confident because Zoran is
a fantastic coach."
The competition begins on Sat
urday with the foil event. Satur
day will also feature the sabre
event, and Sunday the epee. Fenc
ers and coaches will return on
Tuesday in order to prepare for
the final home meet of the year
against San Jose State.
