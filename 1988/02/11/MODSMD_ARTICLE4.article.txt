# Frats urge minority interaction
## 
### Glen Tripp Staff writer 
Members of the Interfraternity
Council last night urged fraterni
ties to make a viable effort to
interact with campus minority
groups.
At their biweekly meeting, IFC
representatives also reaffirmed
their Jan. 27 decision to hold a
wet Rush this spring.
The IFC Committee on Cul
tural Relations issued a letter to
the 25 representatives present ur
ging fraternities to get involved
with minority groups. According
to the letter, the committee was
formed last year because "a lack
of awareness of culturally differ
ent world views, attitudes and
beliefs held by other groups that
make up the Stanford com
munity" exists within the frater
nal system.

The letter states that fraterni
ties should "begin by planning an
activity with one of the cultural
or minority groups at Stanford."
In the letter, the committee sug
gests that fraternities initiate
small parties, panel discussions
and fraternal aid to minority
group projects.
IFC Vice President Stuart Levy,
one of three members of the com
mittee, said that although the
committee "came to an unfortun
ately late start," signs of progress
will soon be visible.
"We want fraternities to inter
act with the minority groups on
campus," Levy told representa
tives at the meeting.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano added that he thought
such an effort would be a "good
opportunity to both break down
stereotypes and to meet new
people."

Levy said he hoped fraternity
members would attend minority
group functions in addition to "in
viting them up" to residences.
Also introduced at the meeting
was a letter from the Stanford
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Speakers' Bureau offering to pro
vide a panel of speakers to inter
ested fraternities. According to
the letter, the panels would at
tempt "to address student ques
tions and openly discuss feelings
and attitudes toward gay people,
issues facing the lesbian, gay and
bisexual community, and rela
tions between gay and non-gay
people."
The letter adds that the bureau
has fraternity alumni available to
speak if a fraternity wishes to host
them.
The Rush alcohol policy will
remain identical to last year's un
less it is brought before the IFC

for reconsideration, Levy said.
The IFC voted down dry Rush
by a margin of 15-4 at its last
meeting. This year's Rush calen
dar will be the same as last year,
with only beer, wine and non
alcoholic beverages allowed
during the first week of Rush.
The second week will be dry, and
any beverage will be allowed
during the third week.
Three ASSU senators last week
drafted a bill urging the IFC to
reconsider its decision to hold a
wet Rush. According to Council
of Presidents member Jim
Durkin, the bill was dropped be
cause the writers had not looked
into the issue enough.
Levy said that although a recon
sideration of the wet Rush policy
by the IFC was "still possible,"
the current position is "what fra
ternities want."
