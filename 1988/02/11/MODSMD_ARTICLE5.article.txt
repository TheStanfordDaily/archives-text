# Kosher kitchen to open soon

A kosher kitchen for Jewish students will begin
operating on campus this spring, Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson announced yester
day.
Currently, students who want kosher food must
go off campus because University Food Service does
not meet preparation requirements. "If students
are strictly observant of the kosher dietary laws,"
Robinson said, "they can't eat in the dorms."
In order to accommodate the needs of those
Jewish students who wish to adhere to a kosher
diet, the University plans to establish a small co
operative kitchen run by students. Elliot Program
Center is the planned site for the kitchen next
quarter, Robinson said. Heginning next fall, the
kitchen will probably be moved to "an upstairs room
in the Wilbur administration office," Robinson said
Sophomore Jessica Mahlab contacted Robinson
two weeks ago to express a need for a kosher kitchen
for the University Jewish community. Mahlab said
that 14 undergraduates have already committed
themselves to the project and that the group is
contacting graduate students who might be inter
ested in participating
Robinson explained that a cooperative would be
the most effective format for the kosher service.
"In order for [Jewish students] to have (kosher)
meals," he said, "they would need a place where
they can cook and control the kitchen."
Mahlab said the group plans to provide coopera
tive dinners, while lunch and breakfast would be
made by individual students.
The University has not yet determined how much
funding wi'l be set aside for the kitchen because a
budget has not yet been proposed. "We have to get
together as a collective to decide what we want,"
Mahlab said, Robinson speculated that students

would be expected to cover costs for food, supplies
and other preparation needs.
Robinson speculated that participating students
might be "exempt" from paying their University
board bills, but "there would be some charge or
adjustment for the use of the facilities."
Membership in the co-op would be limited only
by the size of the kitchen accommodations, Mahlab
said. In addition to those already committed, others
would be allowed to join by signing up. "We don't
want to exclude anyone, but we might be limited
by space," Mahlab said.
Assoc. Dean of Undergraduate Admissions John
Bunnell estimated that the existence of a kosher
kitchen would have a positive effect on Jewish stu
dents accepting admission, although he said he could
not speculate about the extent of such an effect.
"The fact that the opportunity now exists certainly
cannot hurt," he said.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean Fetter
said the absence of a kosher kitchen has had a
somewhat negative impact on acceptance rates in
the past. "I received a letter from a student this
quarter who said that he knew of some students
who did not accept admission because of the
problem," Fetter said.
Robinson said that in the future the University
would consider requests by other groups for special
eating privileges on a case-by-case basis. "If someone
comes in with something, we'll just have to look
at it and see whether we can respond," Robinson
said. "It would depend on what they want," he
added. "We have limited resources."
Fetter added that questions about a kosher
kitchen generally arise during visits to high schools,
especially those with large Jewish populations. "Now
we will be able to give a more positive response,"
she said.
