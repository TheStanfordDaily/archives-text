# Florence administrator:
## Students happy in Italian homes 
### Melissa Beacham 
Controversy about the
remodeled Stanford-in-
Florence program brought
Maria Grazia Passini, assistant
to the director of the program,
to Stanford last week to explain
planned changes to one of
Stanford's most popular over
seas programs.
According to Passir.i, a Jan.
11 Daily article — which
detailed student concerns
about the program's move out
of its beloved Villa to down
town Florence — was the
source of misconceptions about
the quality of life for Stanford
students in"the new Florence
program."
The article included com
ments about students living
with Italian families and prob
lems that could result from
that arrangement.
Eight Stanford students in
Florence living with Italian
families this quarter felt the
fears expressed were unwar
ranted and spontaneously
wrote letters for Passini to
bring with her to Stanford to
ease the climate of uncertainty
reflected in the article.
The letters explained that
living with Italian families did
not mean, as was maintained
by concerned students in the
Daily, being isolated or over
whelmed during their time in
Florence. Instead, these stu
dents described how living with
Italian families, although a cul
tural adjustment at first,
opened a wide range of pos
sible ways to get to know
Florence — possibilities not
available at the Villa.
"Have no fear! Living with
a family is challenging, en
lightening, frustrating, encour
aging and, above all, fun," said
junior Wendy Whitehill in her
letter. "Live in the city — ex
perience the bus, the rhythms
of Florence, the people, the
shops, the customs — it's all
wrapped up in the package if
you live with a family."
Whitehill was not alone in
her praise of the move out of

the Villa into Florence. Junior
Linly Ferris explained that in
itially she was apprehensive
about living with a family,
fearing that her new parents
would be strict and that her
relationship with them would
be limited to that of a boarder.
In her letters she explained
that now she "wouldn't want
to be anywhere other than with
a family. It's the only way to
learn Italian and really get a
feel for how people live here."
Senior Eric Williams assured
students that "living 'scattered
throughout the city' (reference
to the Daily article) doesn't
separate you from your Stan
ford friends."
Williams, who was not profi
cient in Italian when he arrived
in Florence, offered encourage
ment for students uncertain of
their language ability. "I've
had only two quarters of Ital
ian, and I am getting along
well. At first it was very diffi
cult and frustrating listening
to native speakers, but the
worst of that was over within
two weeks."
Passini, who has been
working with Stanford stu
dents in Florence since 1973,
offered insight and concrete
details that have been missing
so far from the discussion
about the controversial deci
sion to move the program.
This quarter, 12 students are
living with Italian families, 11
of whom are in Florence for
their first quarter. Passini said
that they are *11 very happy
with their families. She said
she has given all these students
the option to switch families
or move into the Villa next
quarter if they are not
satisfied, but all have told her
they want to remain living with
families.
Passini explained the
rigorous, painstaking process
she uses to hand pick families
for the Stanford program. "I*Ve
seen about 18 or 20 families
and talked to them before I
selected the 12 families where
these students are now," she
said.
To ensure that Italian
families for Stanford students
are not simply families looking
for extra money and a boarder,
Passini refuses to use newspa
per advertisements to seek and
select potential homes. Instead,
she relies on personal refer
ences from trusted friends and
families with whom Stanford
students have lived in past
years. In addition, she always
visits homes to talk to the
woman of the house at length
and to meet the entire family
when possible.
"There are not going to be
that many changes (in the
program)," explained Passini.
The program will still have an
Italian language requirement.
A majority of courses will be
taught in English. Professors
will still visit from Stanford,
and group field trips to Siena,
Rome and Venice will still take
place.
The primary change, which
will take place this spring, is
the move from the outskirts of
the city, where the Villa is lo
cated, to a palazzo in downtown
Florence. According to Passini,

classes and lunch will be held
downtown, and the Villa will
serve as a residence for those
who choose not to live with
families.
Beginning next fall quarter,
all students will live with
families. Passini outlined a typ
ical day, beginning at breakfast
with the families and followed
by classes and lunch at the
Palazzo, afternoons exploring
Florence or socializing with
other students at the palazzo,
and dinner with the families.
The Palazzo, which will be
open from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m.,
is located near the Ponte Vec
chio with a "beautiful view of
the Arno river and the Uffizzi
Gallery," said Passini. She
added that gym facilities will
be available in the building.
Students will also be able to
join the Florentine rowing club
across the Arno.
In addition, on the day stu
dents arrive at the palazzo,
there will be a group of Italian
university students to "meet
Stanford students and help
them integrate into Italian cul
ture," she said.
Although Stanford-in-
Florence is changing its loca
tion, "There shouldn't be that
much difference," Passini said.

ian, and I am getting along
well. At first it was very diffi
cult and frustrating listening
to native speakers, but the
worst of that was over within
two weeks."
Passini, who has been
working with Stanford stu
dents in Florence since 1973,
offered insight and concrete
details that have been missing
so far from the discussion
about the controversial deci
sion to move the program.
This quarter, 12 students are
living with Italian families, 11
of whom are in Florence for
their first quarter. Passini said
that they are *11 very happy
with their families. She said
she has given all these students
the option to switch families
or move into the Villa next
quarter if they are not
satisfied, but all have told her
they want to remain living with
families.
Passini explained the
rigorous, painstaking process
she uses to hand pick families
for the Stanford program. "I*Ve
seen about 18 or 20 families
and talked to them before I
selected the 12 families where
these students are now," she
said.
To ensure that Italian
families for Stanford students
are not simply families looking
for extra money and a boarder,
Passini refuses to use newspa
per advertisements to seek and
select potential homes. Instead,
she relies on personal refer
ences from trusted friends and
families with whom Stanford
students have lived in past
years. In addition, she always
visits homes to talk to the
woman of the house at length
and to meet the entire family
when possible.
"There are not going to be
that many changes (in the
program)," explained Passini.
The program will still have an
Italian language requirement.
A majority of courses will be
taught in English. Professors
will still visit from Stanford,
and group field trips to Siena,
Rome and Venice will still take
place.
The primary change, which
will take place this spring, is
the move from the outskirts of
the city, where the Villa is lo
cated, to a palazzo in downtown
Florence. According to Passini,

classes and lunch will be held
downtown, and the Villa will
serve as a residence for those
who choose not to live with
families.
Beginning next fall quarter,
all students will live with
families. Passini outlined a typ
ical day, beginning at breakfast
with the families and followed
by classes and lunch at the
Palazzo, afternoons exploring
Florence or socializing with
other students at the palazzo,
and dinner with the families.
The Palazzo, which will be
open from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m.,
is located near the Ponte Vec
chio with a "beautiful view of
the Arno river and the Uffizzi
Gallery," said Passini. She
added that gym facilities will
be available in the building.
Students will also be able to
join the Florentine rowing club
across the Arno.
In addition, on the day stu
dents arrive at the palazzo,
there will be a group of Italian
university students to "meet
Stanford students and help
them integrate into Italian cul
ture," she said.
Although Stanford-in-
Florence is changing its loca
tion, "There shouldn't be that
much difference," Passini said.
Controversy about the
remodeled Stanford-in-
Florence program brought
Maria Grazia Passini, assistant
to the director of the program,
to Stanford last week to explain
planned changes to one of
Stanford's most popular over
seas programs.
According to Passir.i, a Jan.
11 Daily article — which
detailed student concerns
about the program's move out
of its beloved Villa to down
town Florence — was the
source of misconceptions about
the quality of life for Stanford
students in"the new Florence
program."
The article included com
ments about students living
with Italian families and prob
lems that could result from
that arrangement.
Eight Stanford students in
Florence living with Italian
families this quarter felt the
fears expressed were unwar
ranted and spontaneously
wrote letters for Passini to
bring with her to Stanford to
ease the climate of uncertainty
reflected in the article.
The letters explained that
living with Italian families did
not mean, as was maintained
by concerned students in the
Daily, being isolated or over
whelmed during their time in
Florence. Instead, these stu
dents described how living with
Italian families, although a cul
tural adjustment at first,
opened a wide range of pos
sible ways to get to know
Florence — possibilities not
available at the Villa.
"Have no fear! Living with
a family is challenging, en
lightening, frustrating, encour
aging and, above all, fun," said
junior Wendy Whitehill in her
letter. "Live in the city — ex
perience the bus, the rhythms
of Florence, the people, the
shops, the customs — it's all
wrapped up in the package if
you live with a family."
Whitehill was not alone in
her praise of the move out of

the Villa into Florence. Junior
Linly Ferris explained that in
itially she was apprehensive
about living with a family,
fearing that her new parents
would be strict and that her
relationship with them would
be limited to that of a boarder.
In her letters she explained
that now she "wouldn't want
to be anywhere other than with
a family. It's the only way to
learn Italian and really get a
feel for how people live here."
Senior Eric Williams assured
students that "living 'scattered
throughout the city' (reference
to the Daily article) doesn't
separate you from your Stan
ford friends."
Williams, who was not profi
cient in Italian when he arrived
in Florence, offered encourage
ment for students uncertain of
their language ability. "I've
had only two quarters of Ital
ian, and I am getting along
well. At first it was very diffi
cult and frustrating listening
to native speakers, but the
worst of that was over within
two weeks."
