# Scholars convene to tackle time
## 
### Angie Kim Staff writer 
Leading scholars from all over the world
will gather here this weekend to discuss
"chronotypes," or how man has historically
constructed time to fit into society. The three
day conference is one of a series of Stanford
Centennial Celebration events.
According to Prof. David Wellbery, co-chair
of the Comparative Literature Department
and one of the organizers of this first U.S.
conference on time, many problems of time
will be examined by experts from different
fields in an attempt to inform the public and
to encourage more research on the different
origins, uses and concepts of time.
Wellbery said that this weekend will draw
much international attention to Stanford be
cause of the diversity of the speakers involved.
"The Centennial generally produces various
kinds of activities that call attention to Stan
ford," he said. "This conference will gather
many internationally well-known leading
scholars from different disciplines and
nations."
Wellbery said he also hopes the uniqueness
of the subject will spark interest from scholars
in different academic fields. "Time is an item
of nature, but it is experienced differently by

people in different cultures," he said.
"There are so many paradoxes which need
to be explored. [Time] is natural but it's par
tially constructed by mankind," he said.
According to Wellbery, to thoroughly
analyze the role of time in society, the subject
must be approached in many different ways:
socially, philosophically, psychologically, reli
giously and scientifically.
"Time has implications in every field," he
said. "It's important even in fields such as
artificial intelligence in dealing with the proc
essing of information because our brain works
within temporal constraints. So it's a relevant
topic for virtually all majors at Stanford."
Prof. Jack Goody, a cultural anthropologist
at Cambridge University who has specialized
in the study of time, emphasized the impor
tance of the interaction between different
scholars on this matter.
"It's extremely important to bring people
in humanities and social sciences and technical
sciences together," Goody said. "Time matters
to our life, personally and academically. Time
is changing our views of reality, and it needs
to be explored."
"This is an interdisciplinary subject that is
being sponsored by interdisciplinary depart
ments and being dealt with in that manner,"
Wellbery added.

'There are so many
paradoxes which need to
be explored.'

A highlight of the program will be the
opening remarks on "Time and Creation" by
Cornelius Castoriadis of L'Ecole des Hautes
Etudes in Paris, Wellbery said. He called Cas
toriadis "one of the most internationally dis
tinguished political philosophers of our time."
The conference was organized by the De
partment of Comparative Literature, the Hu
manities Center, and the Modern Thought
and Literature Program; it was sponsored by
the Mellon Foundation, the Stanford Dean of
Graduate Studies and the Stanford Centennial
Campaign Fund.
Wellbery estimated the total cost of the
conference would total approximately $25,000.
"I think this will be stimulating for all
intelligent undergrads at Stanford," Wellbery
said. "It's an excellent opportunity for Stan
ford students in every field to see leading
international scholars."
