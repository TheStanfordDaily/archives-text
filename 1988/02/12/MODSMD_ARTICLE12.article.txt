Shultz plans Mideast visit
WASHINGTON - Secretary of State
George Shultz tentatively plans to visit Egypt,
Jordan and Israel beginning Feb. 25 to push
American proposals for reactivating the Middle
East peace process, U.S. officials and
diplomatic sources said yesterday.
Officially, State Department spokesmen said
Shultz would decide about the trip after he
conferred with Richard Murphy, assistant sec
retary for Mideast affairs, who returned here
Thursday from consultations in Saudi Arabia,
Syria and Israel.
However, the sources said, Shultz already
has concluded that the violence sweeping the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
leaves the United States no choice except to
make a new try at resolving the Arab-Israeli
conflict. A hastily assembled new administra
tion peace-talks initiative has encountered
reservations from both sides, and the sources
said Shultz feels that only his personal, on
scene involvement will convince Arab and Is
raeli leaders of a high-priority U.S. commit
ment to help resolve the problems.
New space policy announced
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion unveiled a long-awaited new national
space policy yesterday that includes a 15-point
plan to encourage private investment and a
$100 million fund for development of "path
finder" technologies necessary to expand
manned exploration of the solar system.
The plan, following a high-level, five-month
study, calls for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration to support development
of a privately owned orbiting industrial facility
and to spend $140 million annually over the
next five years, leasing space aboard it as the
government's principal "anchor tenant."
The private mini-station, the size of a bus,
had been the most controversial element of
the Reagan administration study, but NASA
Administrator James C. Fletcher endorsed it
yesterday and said that the space agency would
put the procurement on an accelerated track
leading to selection of a contractor in 150 days.
A budget of $100 million was considered a
strikingly modest amount for the "pathfinder"
technologies, given the lofty objectives laid out
by the White House and administration offi
cials.
PLO "refugee ship" delayed
ATHENS, Greece — A Palestine Liberation
Organization plan to sail a ship filled with
people deported from the occupied territories
to Israel, much as Jewish war refugees did in
1947 aboard the Exodus, has been stalled by
a "secret" Israeli dissuasion campaign aimed
at Greek merchant shipping, PLO officials
charged yesterday. Israel denied the charge.
While hundreds of deported Palestinians,
international observers and reporters milled
around hotels here where they had assembled
for the voyage to Israel, PLO spokesman Bas
sam Abu Sherif announced a delay in depar
ture for the second day in a row because of
the cancellation again of a previously arranged
charter.
"We are sorry for the delay," Abu Sherif
told a news conference attended by journalists,
Palestinian exiles, supporters and observers,
"but it has been caused by Israel's secret war
against us.
