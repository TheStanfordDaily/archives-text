# Quake hits L.A., causes minor damage
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES — A moderately
strong earthquake, an aftershock of
the Oct. 1 temblor, shook the Los An
geles area yesterday morning, sending
at least 31 people to hospitals with
mainly minor injuries.
Nerves were jangled throughout the
metropolitan area, but physical
damage was slight. Skyscrapers and
lesser structures swayed, but only a
few windows shattered.
Authorities attributed no fatalities
to yesterday's quake, which struck at
7:25 a.m and was centered about 10
miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
Hut they noted that a 57-year-old
Hacienda Heights man suffered a fatal
heart attack during the quake.
The quake was measured at 5.0 on
the Richter scale at the California In
stitute of Technology's seismology lab,
and at 4.7 at the U.S. Geological Sur
vey's earthquake center at Golden,
Colo. Such differences are often at

tributed to distance from the quake
and to varying interpretations of pre
liminary readings.
The readings mean that yesterday's
quake was about 10 times less pow
erful than the Oct. 1 shaker, which
measured 5.9 on the Richter scale.
That quake claimed three lives and
caused more than $350 million in
property damage.
Since the bigger quake jolted the
Los Angeles Basin more than four
months ago, there have been hundreds
of aftershocks attributed to it — most
of them too small to feel. Yesterday's
was the second largest — one of a
group of 35 aftershocks to register
more than 3.0 on the Richter scale.
The largest aftershock, which mea
sured 5.3, was recorded three days
after the original quake, and its
epicenter was very close to the
epicenter of yesterday's quake, said
Cal Tech spokesman Hall Daily.

The quake was mea
sured at 5.0 on the
Richter scale at the Cal
ifornia Institute of Tech
nology's seismology
lab.

No significant structural damage
was reported in yesterday's quake, said
James Alexander of the state office of
emergency services. Minor damage —
chiefly broken windows, objects falling
off shelves, and cracked chimneys —
was concentrated in eastern Los An
geles and Orange counties.
The only damage reported to offi
cials in the city of Los Angeles was
one broken water main and one

cracked chimney.
But the quake, which lasted at least
15 seconds, was strong enough to set
off burglar and car alarms and sway
buildings through much of the
metropolitan area.
It was felt as far south as San Diego
and as far east as Palm Springs.
At Presbyterian Intercommunity
Hospital in Whittier where 21 people
were treated, spokeswoman Maria
Adams reported that a majority were
"injured by their own response to the
earthquake rather that by the earth
quake itself."
"They panicked," Adams said.
She said some ran and tripped,
spraining ankles. Others suffered cuts
from broken glass.
Nerves seemed particularly frayed
in the business district of Whittier,
the area hardest hit by the Oct. 1
quake.
