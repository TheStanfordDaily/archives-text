# Nofziger convicted of illegal lobbying
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Lyn Nofziger, a
savvy, wisecracking confidant of Presi
dent Reagan for more than 20 years,
was convicted yesterday of illegally lob
bying former White House colleagues
on behalf of a labor union and two
defense contractors, including scandal
plagued Wedtech Corp.
A federal court jury took less than
eight hours to find Nofziger guilty on
three of four felony counts prosecuted
by independent counsel James McKay
in the first major test of the 1978 Ethics
in Government Act. He faces up to six
years in prison and $30,000 in fines.
The conviction prompted expressions
of sympathy across the political com
munity, even from Democrats who had
engaged Nofziger in partisan warfare.
Although he was one of the most ag
gressive defenders of the conservative
administration, he was widely popular
for his candor and humor.

"I believe with all my heart that he
didn't knowingly violate this ethics
law," said former Democratic Party
Chair John White, who had been sched
uled to testify as a character witness
for Nofziger.
At a press conference following the
verdict, Nofziger blasted the statute,
which restricts lobbying by former ex
ecutive branch officials at their old
agencies.
Nofziger, who resigned as Reagan's
political director in 1982 to become a
lobbyist, called the law "lousy" and "un
fair" because it does not apply to mem
bers of Congress, judges or lower-level
executives.
Sporting a tie from his Mickey Mouse
collection, but eschewing the jauntiness
he maintained at the month-long trial,
Nofziger contended that his crime was
"kind of like running a stop sign." He
predicted vindication on appeal.

Moments later, juror Herbert Robin
son — saying that he was outraged that
Nofziger had lobbied former White
House colleague Edwin Meese 111 on a
$32 million Army contract for Wedtech
in 1982 — emphatically termed the eth
ics law "not unfair" when he was in
formed of Nofziger's comments.
"Would I go back to former officials
I know and make connections that
might involve the security of the United
States? To make a buck? No good," said
Robinson, a postal worker.
Although he prevailed, special prose
cutor McKay spoke somberly in the af
termath of the verdict.
McKay, disagreeing with criticism
that the ethics law is vague, called it
"pretty straightforward." But he said
he would be recommending ways to im
prove it.
