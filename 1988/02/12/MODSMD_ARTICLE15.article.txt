### 
WASHINGTON - Vice
President George Bush was
briefed at two key points in
the White House's arms-for
hostages venture with Iran, in
cluding a December 1985 ses
sion where he was told that
"we would probably never see
our hostages" if the United
States ended secret talks with
Iran, according to newly declas
sified testimony from last
year's Iran-Contra hearings.
The testimony, by former
White House Chief of Staff
Donald Regan, also indicates
that Hush attended a summer
1986 White House session in
which President Reagan ap
proved direct talks with the
nephew of Hashemi Rafsan
jani, speaker of the Iranian par
liament. Rafsanjani was ap
proached after a year of arms
sales brokered by Iranian go

between Manucher Ghor
banifar had failed to free all of
the hostages.
The new statements are con
tained in some 200 pages of
private depositions that Regan
gave last March and July to
lawyers for the Senate Iran-
Contra investigating commit
tee.
Like some committee docu
ments released earlier, they
suggest that the vice president
was told earlier than he has
admitted that the release of
U.S. hostages was a vital com
ponent of American overtures
to the Iranians.
In defending himself against
the backlash from the dis
astrous initiative, Bush has
maintained he was
"deliberately excluded" from
important White House
meetings on the subject.
