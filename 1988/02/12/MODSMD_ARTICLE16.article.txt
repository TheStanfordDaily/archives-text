# Rail drug tests struck down
## 
### 
Federal regulations requiring drug and
alcohol testing for railroad workers follow
ing major accidents, adopted in response
to a wave of drug-related accidents on the
nation's railways, were declared uncon
stitutional yesterday by a federal appeals
court.
Backing a challenge from a coalition of
railroad worker unions, the U.S. 9th Cir
cuit Court of Appeals struck down Federal
Railroad Administration regulations re
quiring all crew members of a train in
volved in a serious accident to submit im
mediate blood and urine samples for test
ing
â€¢ The court, breaking step with other ap
peals courts on the issue, also rejected reg
ulations authorizing railroads to require
their employees to submit to breath or
urine tests when a supervisor has reason
to suspect drug use and, in two related
cases, held that private railroad companies
must negotiate with their employees before
adopting drug testing or detection pro
grams.
"Accidents, incidents or rule violations,
by themselves, do not create reasonable
grounds for suspecting that tests will dem
onstrate alcohol or drug impairment in any
one railroad employee, much less an entire
train crew," Judge Thomas Tang wrote for

the court majority in a 2-1 opinion.
Federal Railroad Administrator John
Riley predicted that the decision, if not
reversed, "will effectively end drug testing
in the railroad industry." The two-year-old
regulations govern an estimated 200,000
railway workers across the nation.
The decision was believed to be the first
appellate court ruling in the country to
overturn drug testing in the workplace.
While a variety of lower courts have
rejected random drug testing programs, the
appeals courts have until now endorsed a
variety of drug testing requirements for
occupations ranging from U.S. Customs
workers to prison guards, bus drivers and
horse racing jockeys.
It will now be up to the U.S. Supreme
Court to resolve the conflicting appeals
court rulings in an area of law that has,
with yesterday's decision, become increas
ingly murky.
In many of the past cases, courts have
held that public safety interests outweigh
the intrusiveness of a drug test, or that
some employees, like jockeys, are person
ally subject to government regulation; in
those cases, drug testing can be compared
to random government inspections of reg
ulated industries, courts have ruled.
