## Co-ops need grads 
### 
LAST WEEK, the Office of
Residential Education
decided to eliminate more
than one-third of the living spaces
available to graduate students in
campus co-ops. The decision
prompted several graduate and un
dergraduate students who live in
co-ops to mount a letter-writing
campaign to urge Residential Ed
ucation to reverse its decision.
Responding Wednesday, Resi
dential Education cut the number
of spaces that will be reduced next
year by one half, from 16 to eight.
The decison is a sound one and
demonstrates that Residential Ed
ucation is clearly listening to stu
dent concerns.
After Roble Hall was closed be
cause it is seismically unsafe, more
spaces were needed for undergrad
uate housing next year. Residential
Education decided that the co-ops
would "share the burden" with
other housing complexes where
both graduate and undergraduate
students live, including the Man
zanita trailers and Mirrielees
apartments.
But the across-the-board cuts
would have had a disparate impact
on the co-ops, where graduate stu
dents actually live with undergrad
uates. Neither Mirrielees nor Man
zanita encourages interaction
among residents, but co-ops stand
in sharp contrast: there, under
graduate and graduate students of
ten share rooms in addition to
cooking and working together to
run the house.
Undergraduates benefit greatly
by interacting with graduate stu
dents, who can explain the realities
of graduate school, tutor in their
area of specialty and offer advice
based on the experiences of their
undergraduate years.
While there are a variety of other
opportunities for undergraduate
and graduate students to interact

at Stanford, the experience of
living together is unmatched in
that it allows for open, casual com
munication.
It is therefore important that as
many graduate student spaces be
retained as possible. In eliminating
only eight spots in co-ops, Resi
dential Education has shown un
derstanding in this respect.
When the original decision to
eliminate 16 spots was made, some
students argued that four addi
tional trailers in Manzanita — each
with space for four people — be
converted to undergraduate
housing.
Residential Education followed
that recommendation as far as it
could, taking two trailers and
making them availiable to under
graduates.
But it would have seemed unfair
to limit the graduate population
in Manzanita or Mirrielees more.
Many graduate students want to
be able to to live in these complexes
and want their friends to have op
portunities to live there as well.
Residential Education recog
nized that different interests
needed to be balanced and did a
fine job doing so in face of the
difficulties it has had to face in
relation to the Roble closure.
Each of the six co-ops will have
one space reclassified as an under
graduate spot for next year except
the largest co-ops — Synergy and
Terra — which will each have two
spaces redesignated. The distribu
tion of the spots will mean that
there will be little impact on indi
vidual houses.
The fact remains that graduate
student spaces in co-ops will be
reduced, and that's extremely un
fortunate. But Residential Educa
tion has done its job by listening
to students and coming up with a
reasonable solution to the problem.
