## Cultural theme houses don't benefit all residents 
### 
THIS LETTER is in response to
the Feb. 8 editorial "Race hides
issues." I agree with the views
expressed in the editorial in the sense
that many people do have erroneous
ideas when referring to the distinction
between race and culture. Although
there are those whose views are
"rooted in ignorance and prejudice,"
the reality of the situation must not
be avoided.
I have lived in Lagunita Court,
where the effects of Ujamaa are
strongly felt. As a black student, I am
very much aware of the many
prejudices that exist on this campus,
and I feel compelled to respond to the
editorial mentioned above.
Unfortunately, the prejudices which
are present on this campus originate

not only within the so-called "white"
population, but are very much alive
among those who claim to be victims
of this discrimination.
I firmly believe in the existence of
ethnic theme houses. Many students
entering Stanford have not been ex
posed to different cultures, and theme
houses promote more awareness, as
well as provide support for those in
volved. The editorial claimed that
theme houses are "wrongly viewed as
separatists, segregationist and racist." I
cannot comment on other theme
houses because I have not been ex
posed to them, but as far as Ujamaa is
concerned, I think that more time
should have been taken in researching
the complex issues and occurrences
discussed in the editorial.

I definitely believe that a certain
element of separatism and reverse
racism characterizes this house. I am
considered an "outsider" because of my
views â€” views which The Daily claims
are "rooted in ignorance and
prejudice." I hardly believe that I am
ignorant of the problems faced by
members of my race; in fact, I find it
very offensive when I'm told that I'm
not "furthering the goals of the black
community." I come from one of the
poorest black neighborhoods in the
country, and I haven't worked my way
to this point so that a small group of
middle class blacks can dictate to me
the best interests of the "black com
munity."
It may be very impressive to say
that 50 percent of the ethnic theme

house occupants are of other cultural
backgrounds, but I believe in dealing
with the reality of the situation.
Having equal representation definitely
does not equate a viable "cross
cultural" situation, especially if the
other groups are made to feel as un
welcomed intruders upon the theme.
It has always been my understanding
that the goal of Residential Education
is to create a feeling of community,
not dissension. When a resident assis
tant tells a student that she is not
welcome in the house because she isn't
part of the theme, that goal is
defeated, and it is time to re-evaluate
the direction in which our theme
houses are headed.
