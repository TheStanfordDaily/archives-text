# Service conference targets apathy
## 
### Michael Lenz 
A national conference this
weekend sponsored by the
Campus Outreach Opportunity
League will bring together Stan
ford students and university ad
ministrators from across the
country to discuss community ser
vice issues, including AIDS, the
homeless and illiteracy.
According to Chris Rubacky, an
organizer of the conference and
a member of the Stanford chapter
of COOL, the purpose of the gath
ering is to increase student aware
ness of public service opportuni
ties.
"We want [students] to hear
about these issues and get
psyched up to do community
work," Rubacky said.
The conference will also address

organizational aspects of commu
nity service, such as fund raising,
volunteer training and increasing
student involvement.
A discussion, titled "Articulat
ing a Vision of Student Action,"
will open the conference today at
7 p.m. Larry McNeil, a member
of the Industrial Arias Founda
tion and a chief organizer of the
movement to raise the California
minimum wage, will deliver the
conference's keynote address to
morrow at 9 a.m. in Kresge
Auditorium.
This will be followed by panel
discussions on issues such as
hunger, youth and the environ
ment, and by workshops on or
ganizing community service ef
forts; all of these events will be
held in Law School classrooms.

This year marks the fourth an
nual meeting of the conference,
which was held last year at
Georgetown University. Housing
for the over 250 students and ad
ministrators in attendance will be
provided in part by Stanford stu
dents who have volunteered to
share their rooms.
Stanford was chosen as the site
for this year's conference because
University President Donald Ken
nedy is a member of Campus
Compact, a community issues
panel of university presidents that
works closely with COOL. "Ken
nedy is committed" to community
service, Rubacky said, "and was
willing to host [the conference]."
Stanford students are encour
aged to attend any of the discus
sions or workshops, Rubacky said.

Those who attend the entire con
ference will be asked to donate
$5 for meals, he said.
Anne O'Leary of the Palo Alto
Ecumenical Hunger Program and
one of tomorrow's panelists said
she feels that students have im
portant "skills and resources" to
share with community organiza
tions. The conference, she said,
will be helpful in increasing stu
dent awareness of ways they can
serve their communities. Many
students "think they don't have
a contribution to make when they
really do."
Based at the University of Min
nesota, COOL is a non-profit or
ganization consisting of over 350
member colleges and universities.
COOL programs range from
adopting grandparents to tutoring
adults learning how to read.
