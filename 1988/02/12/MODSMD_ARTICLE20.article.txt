# Action being taken against date rape
## 
### 
The Jan. 25 article, "The hidden
threat: date rape is all too common,"
was timely, well-written and welcome.
I applaud The Daily for writing so
forthrightly yet sensitively about a
subject that so many would rather
forget than face. The article had its
effect; it has caused many groups and
individuals here to address the issue.
My colleagues and I are grateful for
that.
Rape and other kinds of violence do
happen here and are subjects that
should never be far from our minds.
What can Stanford do to try to
prevent such incidents? When we fail,
how do we attend to the needs of
victims?
Several programs are in place and
most of them involve students in very
key ways. Examples include the volun
teers of the Rap* 1 Education Project,

the training of resident assistants and
the crisis intervention activities of both
the residential deans and the Rape
Crisis Response Group, a 10-member
group formed and trained last year by
Asst. Dean of Residential Education
Patricia Polhemus.
In addition, the nationally recognized
film "Rethinking Rape," produced by
Stanford graduate student Jeanne
LePage in collaboration with REP, is
regularly shown here as well as by
schools throughout the country.
But violence — especially between
men and women — continues to be a
subject that is difficult to bring out of
the shadows of secrecy. Sexuality is
hard enough to talk about, but when
potential or actual violence is a factor,
the conversation is that much more
difficult. As we learned from the arti
cle, matters are often aggravated when
alcohol is a factor.
The circumstances of the event on
which "Susan's story" was based are
not without ambiguity. The women
quoted in the article have not come

forward to talk with a University
representative; reticence in matters like
this is understandable and common.
Through the writer of the article and
with consideration for anonymity, each
woman has been offered assistance by
a representative of my office.
The leadership of the Interfraternity
Council, already working this year to
address other important issues (i.e.,
relations between predominantly white
fraternal groups and students of color),
has taken the lead in planning and
carrying out a series of programs
seeking to get at issues such as the
following:
• Sexual consent versus coercion,
• Communicating about sexual
preferences (speaking clearly and lis
tening with understanding),
• Societal attitudes and pressures that
complicate sexuality,
• Individual differences in sexual ethics
and behavior as compared with com
munity standards,
• Respecting others and insisting on

their respect,
• The impact of alcohol on rational
decision making, and
• How and where to seek help with
problems.
Violence is not an absolute concept;
rather, it occurs along a continuum
that starts with a lack of empathy for
one's fellow human being. In any form
and at any point on the continuum,
however, violence is utterly unaccepta
ble in a community like ours that
values human dignity and respect for
the rights of others.
Sexual violence is especially difficult
to confront and talk about because it
occurs in the most intimate and vul
nerable of contexts. As individuals and
as a community, we must refuse to
allow embarrassment, confusion, shame
or secrecy to prevent our working to
address the problem. I thank The
Daily for their contribution to that
effort.
