UJ T'S KIND OF SAD," reflected
I former Arizona Gov. Bruce Bab-
J-bitt, bidding a bittersweet Mon
day night farewell to a state in which he
spent more than 100 days campaigning.
"It's kind of like graduating from col
lege." But the profs at Caucus University
graded on more than effort. To pass lowa
with honors, a Democratic candidate
needed some things Babbitt lacked: a win
ning smile, a great barber, top-notch
speaking ability, and a throng of volun
teers.
Especially the barber.
Okay, so Babbitt talks like Ichabod
Crane on speed. But did anyone in lowa
listen to the words behind the Bullwinkle
basso? On the issues of education and,
more importantly, budget-balancing,
Babbitt's the only candidate who avoids
the popular waffling and actually says
something concrete.
Education, for most liberals, is like
defense for conservatives: There's no
problem that can't be solved by simply
injecting more money. Babbitt's the only
exception in the Democratic field. A
debate late last year in North Carolina
stumped all the rest by asking what they
would do to improve education if they
couldn't spend more. Gov. Michael
Dukakis perkily offered to spend $250
million more. Sen. Paul Simon rejected
the premise. Rep. Dick Gephardt sput
tered about seeking "more research" on
merit pay. Babbitt broadsided them.
"What we need," he said, "is the guts
and the creativity to say we're going to
pay the best teachers more, and teachers
will accept it if we involve them in the
process." And he should know. As gover

nor of Arizona he rammed an improved
pay-scale, career-ladder teaching system
— and a tax increase to fund it — through
the miserly, heavily GOP state Assembly
and Senate. Says House Majority Whip
and conservative Republican Jane Hull,
"I guess he did drag us kicking and
screaming into the 20th century."
On the larger issue of balancing the
federal budget, Babbitt alone offers func
tional, number-specific solutions.
Dukakis, when he's not promising to pull
$110 billion in back taxes out of a hat,
likes to make homey references to his
"Massachusetts Miracle" — the mid-80s
economic upswing — and says he can
"do for America what he did for Massac
husetts." But (1) much of the "miracle"
was due to a multi-billion-dollar influx
of research capital for SDI and to passage
of a property tax cut that Dukakis op
posed; and (2) just for comparison's sake,
Inc. magazine just rated Massachusetts'
economy as ninth best in the nation —
eight behind Arizona.
Simon supports a balanced budget
amendment, yet he opposes new taxes
while advocating new entitlements cos
ting billions more than his budget cuts
would save. That's sort of a left-wing
Reagan-math. "He's out of touch with
reality," says Gephardt of Simon. True
enough. But Gephardt's only real idea
for raising revenue (he too fails to propose
meaningful cuts) is an inflationary and
regressive $5 oil import "fee." None of
these clowns says how he'd balance the
budget. They don't seem to understand
that we can't sustain long-term economic
growth without slashing the deficit.
Babbitt understands. He offers a

twofold solution. One: Unentitle the un
needy. Right now, much of the mortgage
interest on the second homes of the af
fluent is tax-deductible. Right now, big,
profitable agri-businesses receive two
thirds of all farm support payments.
Right now, well-to-do retirees' Social Se
curity benefits are mostly tax-free. Bab
bitt would kick these and other free
riders off the bus, saving billions.
Two: Impose a five percent Consump
tion Tax, or VAT. It's not as bad as it
looks. Ordinarily VATs are regressive,
hitting the poor the hardest, but Babbitt
would exempt food, housing, utilities,
medical costs and other basic necessities,
removing most of the regressivity. This
measure alone would reduce the deficit
by $50-$6O billion annually and, com
bined with Babbitt's cuts, can balance
the budget in four years.
But when all the issues are considered,
Babbitt's awkwardness on camera
remains a legitimate objection to his can
didacy. Nowadays, skill in swaying
Congress or in choosing appointments
just isn't enough. The modern president
must be telegenic as well. Flash, teeth,
hair, speaking ability and handsomeness
have now assumed the same importance
as the issues.
It's kind of sad.
