## Brown abuses his power in the state legislature 
### 
WANTED: a new California
State Assembly speaker.
Speaker Willie Brown is on his
way out. At least he deserves to be.
First, a brief recap of recent events
at the state capital. State lawmakers
returned to Sacramento earlier this
year for the second half of the 1987-88
legislative session. The capitol air, not
unexpectedly, was already full of
rumors.
As the end of 1987 neared, rumors
were that a leadership coup in the
Assembly was imminent. And as the
year began, rumors were rampant that
1988 would bring changes in commit
tee memberships. The rumors have
ended and the outcome has become
known as the battle of the Speaker vs.
the Gang of Five.
The first casualties became apparent
only a week into the session. Removed
from powerful committees were Demo
cratic Assemblymen Charles Calderon,
Gary Condit and Steve Peace, who
along with Gerald Eaves and Rusty
Areias make up what is also known as
the "Five Amigos." Perhaps the biggest
loser in the battle was Calderon, who
lost his seats in the Finance and In
surance and Ways and Means commit
tees as well as his position as majority
whip. The following week Areias was
stripped of his chairmanship of the
Government Efficiency and Consumer
Protection Committee. Eaves is still
waiting for the next round but has
thus far escaped injury.
Political observers were quick to
describe the shuffling of assignments
as a purge, retribution or punishment
for the Gang's dissident views in the
last year. Not to be left behind, the
speaker noted that his actions simply
constituted a reorganization. Crafty as
he is with words, the Speaker called it
an effort to "streamline" the operation
of the Assembly. Call it what you will,
it simply is an abuse of power. It is
further a sign that the Speaker's
leadership is on the wane.
What sins, what crimes even, have
these fine legislators committed to
deserve the wrath of Brown? The
Gang's mistake was to engage in politi
cal maneuvering independent of the
Assembly's Democratic caucus. Their

fault was being young and aggressive
political mavericks. Their moderate to
conservative philosophical bent led
them to stray from the liberal-
Democratic agenda. Last year their
dissent allowed the Republicans to
block a key insurance bill and to pass
a controversial teen abortion bill re
quiring parental consent — legislation
which would have failed if everyone
had engaged in voting the party line.
The move proved embarrassing to
several Democratic leaders including
Brown.
For whatever the merits of the
legislation, there is much to be said for
voting one's mind and voting in ac
cordance with the views of one's con
stituents. The speaker may vote the
liberal Democratic stance 100 percent
of the time. His views, moreover, may
be in line with those of his con
stituency, and that is all well and
good.
But other legislators may not enjoy
such comfort. Some lawmakers are
often caught between a rock and a
hard place. Democrats from the more
moderate districts or from districts
swinging to the conservative view on
some social issues find themselves in a
dilemma. They face an allegiance to
their own party and a commitment to
those they serve. When confronted
with such a dilemma, our lawmakers
should defer to the views of their
constituency. After all, elected officials
are in power to serve not the party
leadership but rather the will of the
people. But the speaker has come to
forget that.
That is not to say that it is outside
the speaker's prerogative to manage
the Assembly as he sees fit. In fact,
his power to organize committees and
define their membership is outlined in
the Assembly Rules. The purpose of
the powers granted to the speaker
under the Rules, however, is to organ
ize an effective legislative process. To
use them for any other purpose consti
tutes a misuse of power.
Brown's shakedown of committees
points to an insecurity which has been
almost non-existent in his seven-year
grip of the speakership. For once,
members of his own party are

seriously challenging his tight control
of committees and of legislation.
Recently, a measure to pull a bill from
committee for a vote in the full As
sembly nearly succeeded. The deciding
vote against the measure was cast by
Republican Stan Statham, who two
weeks earlier had been awarded a
committee chairmanship by the
speaker.
Putting aside for the moment the
speaker's wheeling and dealing to
protect his post, the procedure to
withdraw the bill from committee is in
itself an act of revolt against the
speaker. The rebels garnered 40 votes.
It takes 41 to elect a new speaker.
Now to the wheeling and dealing.
Brown last year was upset by the
Gang's (plus one, Assemblyman Jim
Costa) endorsement of Republican state
Sen. Ken Maddy for the vacant seat of
state treasurer. In contrast, the
Speaker apparently wants to cut some
sort of deal with Gov. George Deuk
mejian, who has nominated Republican
Rep. Dan Lungren to succeed the late
Jesse Unruh as treasurer. It seems
Brown is not about to be left out of
the political game surrounding
Lungren's confirmation. Granted,
Brown is a leader in the Assembly, but
he is not guaranteed the right to be
the sole player.
Voters prefer a rational, pragmatic
approach to the state's problems. The
Speaker's pompous antics and flam
boyant style are now too old to be
entertaining, but none too old to merit
a change in leadership.
The change unfortunately will not
come soon. Democrats will likely retain
their slight mfy'ority in the Assembly
after the November election. But by
this time next year, Brown should
likely be known simply as the As
semblyman from the 17th District.

be in line with those of his con
stituency, and that is all well and
good.
But other legislators may not enjoy
such comfort. Some lawmakers are
often caught between a rock and a
hard place. Democrats from the more
moderate districts or from districts
swinging to the conservative view on
some social issues find themselves in a
dilemma. They face an allegiance to
their own party and a commitment to
those they serve. When confronted
with such a dilemma, our lawmakers
should defer to the views of their
constituency. After all, elected officials
are in power to serve not the party
leadership but rather the will of the
people. But the speaker has come to
forget that.
That is not to say that it is outside
the speaker's prerogative to manage
the Assembly as he sees fit. In fact,
his power to organize committees and
define their membership is outlined in
the Assembly Rules. The purpose of
the powers granted to the speaker
under the Rules, however, is to organ
ize an effective legislative process. To
use them for any other purpose consti
tutes a misuse of power.
Brown's shakedown of committees
points to an insecurity which has been
almost non-existent in his seven-year
grip of the speakership. For once,
members of his own party are

seriously challenging his tight control
of committees and of legislation.
Recently, a measure to pull a bill from
committee for a vote in the full As
sembly nearly succeeded. The deciding
vote against the measure was cast by
Republican Stan Statham, who two
weeks earlier had been awarded a
committee chairmanship by the
speaker.
Putting aside for the moment the
speaker's wheeling and dealing to
protect his post, the procedure to
withdraw the bill from committee is in
itself an act of revolt against the
speaker. The rebels garnered 40 votes.
It takes 41 to elect a new speaker.
Now to the wheeling and dealing.
Brown last year was upset by the
Gang's (plus one, Assemblyman Jim
Costa) endorsement of Republican state
Sen. Ken Maddy for the vacant seat of
state treasurer. In contrast, the
Speaker apparently wants to cut some
sort of deal with Gov. George Deuk
mejian, who has nominated Republican
Rep. Dan Lungren to succeed the late
Jesse Unruh as treasurer. It seems
Brown is not about to be left out of
the political game surrounding
Lungren's confirmation. Granted,
Brown is a leader in the Assembly, but
he is not guaranteed the right to be
the sole player.
Voters prefer a rational, pragmatic
approach to the state's problems. The
Speaker's pompous antics and flam
boyant style are now too old to be
entertaining, but none too old to merit
a change in leadership.
The change unfortunately will not
come soon. Democrats will likely retain
their slight mfy'ority in the Assembly
after the November election. But by
this time next year, Brown should
likely be known simply as the As
semblyman from the 17th District.

WANTED: a new California
State Assembly speaker.
Speaker Willie Brown is on his
way out. At least he deserves to be.
First, a brief recap of recent events
at the state capital. State lawmakers
returned to Sacramento earlier this
year for the second half of the 1987-88
legislative session. The capitol air, not
unexpectedly, was already full of
rumors.
As the end of 1987 neared, rumors
were that a leadership coup in the
Assembly was imminent. And as the
year began, rumors were rampant that
1988 would bring changes in commit
tee memberships. The rumors have
ended and the outcome has become
known as the battle of the Speaker vs.
the Gang of Five.
The first casualties became apparent
only a week into the session. Removed
from powerful committees were Demo
cratic Assemblymen Charles Calderon,
Gary Condit and Steve Peace, who
along with Gerald Eaves and Rusty
Areias make up what is also known as
the "Five Amigos." Perhaps the biggest
loser in the battle was Calderon, who
lost his seats in the Finance and In
surance and Ways and Means commit
tees as well as his position as majority
whip. The following week Areias was
stripped of his chairmanship of the
Government Efficiency and Consumer
Protection Committee. Eaves is still
waiting for the next round but has
thus far escaped injury.
Political observers were quick to
describe the shuffling of assignments
as a purge, retribution or punishment
for the Gang's dissident views in the
last year. Not to be left behind, the
speaker noted that his actions simply
constituted a reorganization. Crafty as
he is with words, the Speaker called it
an effort to "streamline" the operation
of the Assembly. Call it what you will,
it simply is an abuse of power. It is
further a sign that the Speaker's
leadership is on the wane.
What sins, what crimes even, have
these fine legislators committed to
deserve the wrath of Brown? The
Gang's mistake was to engage in politi
cal maneuvering independent of the
Assembly's Democratic caucus. Their

fault was being young and aggressive
political mavericks. Their moderate to
conservative philosophical bent led
them to stray from the liberal-
Democratic agenda. Last year their
dissent allowed the Republicans to
block a key insurance bill and to pass
a controversial teen abortion bill re
quiring parental consent — legislation
which would have failed if everyone
had engaged in voting the party line.
The move proved embarrassing to
several Democratic leaders including
Brown.
For whatever the merits of the
legislation, there is much to be said for
voting one's mind and voting in ac
cordance with the views of one's con
stituents. The speaker may vote the
liberal Democratic stance 100 percent
of the time. His views, moreover, may
be in line with those of his con
stituency, and that is all well and
good.

such comfort. Some lawmakers are
