## Developments are costly 
### 
AS A STUDENT in an urban
planning class, I have recently
become aware of issues regarding
planned site development on the Uni
versity campus which could have a
new impact on the future cost of a
Stanford education.
My impression after reading the Feb.
8 letter by Provost James Rosse was
that the need to finance projects such
as Governor's Corner, graduate student
housing and the Roble reparation has
indeed "made large demands on the
University's budget."
And beneath these "tip-of-the
iceberg" financial burdens lie stagger
ing multi-million dollar planned
developments of the Near West
campus, plans for an athletics east and
west quadrangle and six artist studios
near the Stanford Golf Course! The
projected costs alone for the athletics
east and west quadrangles together
total more than $37 million!
The plan for the Athletic East Quad
project consists of a renovated Old
Pavilion and a partially renovated
Encina Gymnasium, which would
include refurbishings, a new gym
nasium, locker rooms and offices; and

a sports courtyard which would accom
odate "several hundred people for
various activities." Total projected cost:
$19.3 million.
The development site for the Athletic
West Quad project is planned opposite
the intersection of Santa Teresa and
Campus Drive West. The plan com
prises an organized group of athletic
facilities and supporting play fields.
Total projected cost: $18.1 million.
I am personally not against building
some of these facilities; my question is:
Will students, the potential beats of
the financial burden, be allowed a
voice in projects which will directly
affect them and those that follow?
In addition, will students help decide
the limits to our University's expan
sionist policies? Will we allow any site
development near our much treasured
Dish (as proposed by the Foothills
Region Plan, Phase 1) or the historical
landmark of the Stanford Barn? I care
about what is happening to the Farm
and would like for students to share a
part in the planning of its future
growth.
