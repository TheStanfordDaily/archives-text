# Western Culture contaminates
## 
### 
The rise of Western Culture has
been accompanied by accelerated deple
tion of virtually all known earth re
sources, by proliferation of diverse and
potent hazard unprecedented in earth
history and by increase of human
population to unsustainable levels.
In Western Culture we find a
blueprint for ecological malpractice and
the eradication of species and indeed
whole biomes at a heretofore unseen
pace, and for imposition of suffering
on a grand scale (there are more sick,
starving and crazy than ever before),
for the elevation of greed, smallness,
and short-sightedness to cardinal
virtues and the wholesale enlistment of
the gifted to sustaining a reign of
terror and pandering to the decadent
fetishes of its prime organizers.
Who dare claim that the completion
of a Western Culture requirement
results in Stanford graduates deviating
from this pattern?
Why do we hesitate for one moment
in recognizing the bulk of Western

Culture as a plague upon human
consciousness, a repository of values by
which the plunder the a planet and
the life upon it are rationalize, even
made heroic?
Why do we insist upon indoctrinat
ing youth with the same misinforma
tion by which we have arrived at our
current state?
Why is the core of a Stanford educa
tion focused upon a handful of "great
works" by a handful of "great men,"
rather than upon illumination of ques
tions like "To what purposes shall we
live?" "By what means?" and "How do
we know?" by whatever means from
whatever source?
Those who are caught up in a justi
fication of some part of their cultural
heritage in a world already made less
hospitable to all life by their own
misguided acts condemn the young to
extend the sad record of human adap
tive failure.
