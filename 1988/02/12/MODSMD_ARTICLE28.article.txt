## Feisty freshman skates her way into Olympics 
### Dee Dee Weale 
Marking a historic first for
Taiwan, freshman Pauline Lee
leaves Stanford today to represent
the country in figure skating at
the Winter Olympics.
Taiwan first competed in the
Olympics in 1980. Now in 1988,
Lee is the first of two figure
skaters representatrng the
country in the Games. Because
Lee and David Liu, a college stu
dent in Ohio, can claim dual
citizenship in the United States
and Taiwan, both decided to rep
resent the Asian country at this
year's games held in Calgary,
Canada.

But because of long-standing
political problems between China
and Taiwan, both skaters will
compete under Taiwan's althletic
flag rather than the country's na
tional flag.
By downplaying the nationality
issue, the Taiwanese government
hopes to avoid the problems that
arose at the 1980 Olympics when
the Peking and Chinese Taipei
flags were both flown. The
Chinese communist government
still regards Taiwan as part of
China.
Lee said her skating career
began by chance when her
babysitter took her skating
several times. Lee began taking

private lessons and was competing
locally when she was only 8-years
old.
On weekends Lee attended a
Chinese school where she learned
about the country's culture and
language. After watching Lee
skate, the president of the school
wrote to the skating association
in Taiwan. Hp also encouraged
Lee to send videotapes of her
skating to the Taiwanese associ
ation.
After viewing the video tapes,
the Taiwanese association asked
Lee to represent the country in
the Olympics. She accepted.
"It gave me a chance to compete
because I couldn't realistically
represent the United States," she
said.
According to Lee, the United
States and the Soviet Union sport
the two most competitive figure
skating teams in the world and
she could not have qualified for
the U.S. team.
Lee has competed in the inter
national circuit for over four
years. She has skated in the
Grand Prix Championship in
Oberstorf, Germany, the Junior
World Championships in Colorado
and two world championships
held in Geneva and Cincinnati.
Looking to the Olympic Games,
Lee said that she will give her
best in the competition because
it will probably be her last.
"I usually skate for myself . . .
but this time, I want to skate for
my parents, too, because they
have always been there for me,"
she said.
"Pauline realizes that she is not
the top skater in the world," said
dormmate Marnie Kingery, a
freshman in Rinconada. "But
she's going to show the entire
world exactly what. . . she can
do."
Here at Stanford, Lee said she
must get up at 4 a.m. four times
a week for practice. Every Mon
day, Tuesday and Wednesday she
skates from 5 a.m. until 9 a.m in
San Mateo and then rushes back
to Stanford to make her 10 a.m.
class. On Thursdays and Fridays,
Lee skates from 7 a.m. until noon.

At practice, Lee alternates cum
pulsory skating figures and free
style routines every hour. Accord
ing to Lee, it is important to prac
tice technique while maintaining
conditioning.
Coach Christy Kjarsgaard said
Lee's levelheadedness, willingness
to work and pride help her
tremendously on the ice.
"You don't see Pauline
pouting," Kjarsgaard said. "She
accepts her limitations. She
doesn't beat herself for what she
can't do. Instead, she works on
improving."
Lee's strongest assest on the
ice is her grace. "She really enjoys
interpreting music," Kjarsgaard
said.
Despite Lee's graceful style,
Kjarsgaard explained that Lee's
inability to perform triple axles
weakens her performance because
technique is becoming increas
ingly more important for compet
itive skaters.
But, Kjarsgaard said, "Pauline
seems to go along her merry way.
She's self-motivated and does the
best she can do."
When asked if she had a "Debi
Thomas-complex," Lee said that
seeing Thomas in action
motivated her.
"Debi has guts," she said, "and
she knows exactly what she
wants."
Lee added that she especially
admires Thomas' jumping ability.
Lee said that she sees skating
as both an art and a sport, but
added that she is more partial to
the artistic aspect. Lee studied
ballet until she began competing
internationally.
"I love interpreting the music,"
Lee said. ""When I skate, I feel
like giving something to the
audience."
Lee is as determined in the
classroom as she is on the ice.
"She optionally revised several
of her essays which many regular
students don't bother to do," ac
cording to Richard Holton, Lee's
Freshman English instructor.
Holton said he was impressed
with her "attractive, quiet dig
nity."

"She certainly doesn't go
around with a banner saying 'I'm
a world-class athlete,' " said Hol
ton, who learned that Lee is a
skater only two weeks ago.
"A lot of varsity athletes will
complain about their work load,
other papers and adjustment to
the work schedule, but Pauline
never made these remarks," Hol
ton said.
"Maybe she doesn't want any
favors," he speculated.
"Pauline does more in one day

than most of us do in two or
three," according to freshman
Libby Wertin, Lee's roommate in
Rinconada.
"It's really incredible how she's
able to balance her rigorous train
ing schedule with daily life," said
dormmate Kingery.
Holton added that Lee seems
friendly, personable — but shy.
"She's unassuming and reserved
— not aggressive or forward with
her exploits. She quietly gets her
work done."

the Olympics. She accepted.
"It gave me a chance to compete
because I couldn't realistically
represent the United States," she
said.
According to Lee, the United
States and the Soviet Union sport
the two most competitive figure
skating teams in the world and
she could not have qualified for
the U.S. team.
Lee has competed in the inter
national circuit for over four
years. She has skated in the
Grand Prix Championship in
Oberstorf, Germany, the Junior
World Championships in Colorado
and two world championships
held in Geneva and Cincinnati.
Looking to the Olympic Games,
Lee said that she will give her
best in the competition because
it will probably be her last.
"I usually skate for myself . . .
but this time, I want to skate for
my parents, too, because they
have always been there for me,"
she said.
"Pauline realizes that she is not
the top skater in the world," said
dormmate Marnie Kingery, a
freshman in Rinconada. "But
she's going to show the entire
world exactly what. . . she can
do."
Here at Stanford, Lee said she
must get up at 4 a.m. four times
a week for practice. Every Mon
day, Tuesday and Wednesday she
skates from 5 a.m. until 9 a.m in
San Mateo and then rushes back
to Stanford to make her 10 a.m.
class. On Thursdays and Fridays,
Lee skates from 7 a.m. until noon.

At practice, Lee alternates cum
pulsory skating figures and free
style routines every hour. Accord
ing to Lee, it is important to prac
tice technique while maintaining
conditioning.
Coach Christy Kjarsgaard said
Lee's levelheadedness, willingness
to work and pride help her
tremendously on the ice.
"You don't see Pauline
pouting," Kjarsgaard said. "She
accepts her limitations. She
doesn't beat herself for what she
can't do. Instead, she works on
improving."
Lee's strongest assest on the
ice is her grace. "She really enjoys
interpreting music," Kjarsgaard
said.
Despite Lee's graceful style,
Kjarsgaard explained that Lee's
inability to perform triple axles
weakens her performance because
technique is becoming increas
ingly more important for compet
itive skaters.
But, Kjarsgaard said, "Pauline
seems to go along her merry way.
She's self-motivated and does the
best she can do."
When asked if she had a "Debi
Thomas-complex," Lee said that
seeing Thomas in action
motivated her.
"Debi has guts," she said, "and
she knows exactly what she
wants."
Lee added that she especially
admires Thomas' jumping ability.
Lee said that she sees skating
as both an art and a sport, but
added that she is more partial to
the artistic aspect. Lee studied
ballet until she began competing
internationally.
"I love interpreting the music,"
Lee said. ""When I skate, I feel
like giving something to the
audience."
Lee is as determined in the
classroom as she is on the ice.
"She optionally revised several
of her essays which many regular
students don't bother to do," ac
cording to Richard Holton, Lee's
Freshman English instructor.
Holton said he was impressed
with her "attractive, quiet dig
nity."

"She certainly doesn't go
around with a banner saying 'I'm
a world-class athlete,' " said Hol
ton, who learned that Lee is a
skater only two weeks ago.
"A lot of varsity athletes will
complain about their work load,
other papers and adjustment to
the work schedule, but Pauline
never made these remarks," Hol
ton said.
"Maybe she doesn't want any
favors," he speculated.
"Pauline does more in one day

than most of us do in two or
three," according to freshman
Libby Wertin, Lee's roommate in
Rinconada.
"It's really incredible how she's
able to balance her rigorous train
ing schedule with daily life," said
dormmate Kingery.
Holton added that Lee seems
friendly, personable — but shy.
"She's unassuming and reserved
— not aggressive or forward with
her exploits. She quietly gets her
work done."

A determined student and ice skater, freshman Pauline Lee will
compete for Taiwan in the Olympic Games next week.
Marking a historic first for
Taiwan, freshman Pauline Lee
leaves Stanford today to represent
the country in figure skating at
the Winter Olympics.
Taiwan first competed in the
Olympics in 1980. Now in 1988,
Lee is the first of two figure
skaters representatrng the
country in the Games. Because
Lee and David Liu, a college stu
dent in Ohio, can claim dual
citizenship in the United States
and Taiwan, both decided to rep
resent the Asian country at this
year's games held in Calgary,
Canada.

But because of long-standing
political problems between China
and Taiwan, both skaters will
compete under Taiwan's althletic
flag rather than the country's na
tional flag.
By downplaying the nationality
issue, the Taiwanese government
hopes to avoid the problems that
arose at the 1980 Olympics when
the Peking and Chinese Taipei
flags were both flown. The
Chinese communist government
still regards Taiwan as part of
China.
Lee said her skating career
began by chance when her
babysitter took her skating
several times. Lee began taking

private lessons and was competing
locally when she was only 8-years
old.
On weekends Lee attended a
Chinese school where she learned
about the country's culture and
language. After watching Lee
skate, the president of the school
wrote to the skating association
in Taiwan. Hp also encouraged
Lee to send videotapes of her
skating to the Taiwanese associ
ation.
After viewing the video tapes,
the Taiwanese association asked
Lee to represent the country in
the Olympics. She accepted.
"It gave me a chance to compete
because I couldn't realistically
