# Cupid aims at campus apathy

Valentine's Day offers Stan
ford romantics, wherever they
may be hiding, a chance to for
get about midterm pressure
and escape for the holiday.
"Flowers are Valentine's
Day," said Larry Tarquinio,
owner of the Tutti Fiori flower
stand located in White Plaza.
"If something lasts forever, it
is mundane and ordinary. If it
is only for the moment, it is
to be cherished."
Along with cards and candy,
the red rose epitomizes the
holiday, according to Tarquino.
"If you love somebody, you
give them flowers," he said.
Tarquino said he will be
stocking extra roses for the
holiday, his busiest time of the
year, and extending his hours
through the weekend. He pur
chases his flowers from the San
Francisco Flower Market, and
expects to sell a majority of
roses this weekend. Tarquino's
prices range from $10 to $16
for a dozen roses.
At the other end of White
Plaza is the Bookstore, decked
out with hearts and cupids,
which currently offers 30 per
cent savings on selected books
as part of a "heartbreaker
sale."
The Bookstore is also
specializing in cards, toys and
heart-shaped boxes of delec
table chocolates designed to aid
in communicating some of
those precarious Valentine sen
timents.

But student sentiments
about Valentine's Day are not
always favorable.
"Actually, I always thought
Valentine's Day was kind of
stupid, sentimental and sap
py," said junior Peter Nadan.
"I think Valentine's Day is
a conspiracy by Hallmark to
raise their revenues," said
junior John Pacheco, one
holiday skeptic.
In a historical look at the
heartfelt holiday, it turns out
that St. Valentine's Day may
have received its name purely
by coincidence. The holiday
first came to be celebrated on
Feb. 14 in 13th-century Europe
because of the medieval belief
that birds begin to mate on
that date.
St. Valentine's name was
used only because the date fell
on his official saint's day.
There is some confusion
about who the original St.
Valentine was. Legend tells
that there may have been up
to seven St. Valentines, but
most sources report a scanty
history of Father Valentine of
Rome and Bishop Valentine of
Terni, who were supposedly be
headed on the same day.
Today, St. Valentine is com
monly regarded as the patron
saint of lovers, and the Catholic
church no longer observes his
feast day.
The holiday is hardly a day
that allows post offices across
the country to close their doors.
In fact, it seems that many of
fices will be overrun with the
season's greetings.
"My Mom sends me a Valen
tine, then I send her a Valen
tine . . . that is pretty much
how it works out," said junior
Kurt Hofgard.
Other ideas bound to woo a
lover include Baker Street's
eight-ounce heart-shaped choc
olate chip cookies, delivered
with a personal message, a gift
card and balloons.
