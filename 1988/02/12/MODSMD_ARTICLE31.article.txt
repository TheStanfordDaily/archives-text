# Monopoly play is here to stay

### Paul de Figueiredo 
Before the Great Depression, Charles Dar
row, a salesman from Germantown, Pennsyl
vania, used to take his family to Atlantic City
for summer vacation.
But when the Depression hit, Darrow lost
his job and could not afford the trip. Instead,
he tinkered around the house, remembering
those fine summer days on the boardwalk.
During these lazy days, Darrow invented
what was to become the most popular "proper
tied" board game in the United States,
Monopoly.
I say "propertied" because the rights to
board games that might seem more popular
— games like chess, backgammon or checkers
— are not owned by any corporation or in
dividual.
Using a pencil and a piece of oil paper,
Darrow sketched out the first version of the
game on his dining room table. He used the
names of railroads, streets, places and utilities
from the Atlantic City he so fondly remem
bered for the spaces on his board. However,
there were two exceptions to his name usages.
Marvin Gardens, a name he chose for one
of his properties, was not a name from Atlantic
City, but was from a neighborhood in Dar
row's hometown.
Darrow choose for his board the Pacific,
Pennsylvania and Baltimore & Ohio, railroads
— three railroads that took vacationers from
surrounding cities to Atlantic City.
But Darrow wanted a fourth railroad to
give the board symmetry. He chose the name
Short Line, even though Short Line was not
a railroad but a bus company that carried
freight to Atlantic City.
Working at home, Darrow constructed by
hand the first versions of his game. He then
sold them to friends for only $4 a set. Through
word of mouth, the game slowly gained
popularity.
By 1934 demand for Monopoly was so great
that Darrow took the game to Parker Broth
ers, already an established games seller,
hoping they would agree to manufacture and
market his game.
At the time, Parker Brothers was a very
conservative firm, preferring not to acquire
games from inventors outside the company.
Parker Brothers also refused to accept games
that operated on principles that seemed to
work against proven market strategies.
Darrow submitted his game to Parker
Brothers for review. After a few hours of
testing, corporate game "experts" rejected
Monopoly because they said it contained "52
fundamental errors."
Parker Brothers executives pointed out that
the game board did not contain an "End"
position — players just went around in circles.
According to the executives, the maximum

playing time for any board game should be
45 minutes, but Monopoly play could continue
for hours.
Darrow returned home disapointed — but
not discouraged. In the next year, the
popularity of Monopoly steadily increased and
Darrow started receiving orders from large
department stores.
Parker Brothers was astonished to discover
that their products were being displaced for
a new game called Monopoly, a game they
had deemed unmarketable.
Realizing they might have passed up a po
tential gold mine, Parker Brothers approached
Darrow to talk about acquiring the game. In
1935, Darrow sold the game to Parker Broth
ers, settling on a royalty for each game sold.
At age 46, Darrow retired a millionaire and
never once regretted selling his brainchild.
Today Monopoly is played worldwide. The
game uses different currency, depending on
where the game is being played.
Deutschemarks are used in Germany and
francs in France.
Similarly, properties on the game board are
named after famous streets and places for the
country where the game is sold. Boardwalk
is called Mayfair in the British version, Schlos
salle in the German version, Rue de la Paix
in the French version and Paseo del Prado
in the Spanish version.
The popularity of Monopoly is mind bog
gling — take a look at some of the statistics:
• Since 1935, Parker Brothers has manufac
tured over 2 billion of those little green houses.
• Over one trillion dollars in Monopoly
money has been produced.
• About $50 billion in Monopoly money is
produced every year.
• Over 80 million Monopoly sets have been
sold.
