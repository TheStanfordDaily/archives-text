Thank God for President's Day:
Last time I checked my social calendar, I
couldn't help but notice (and give thanks) that
we're about to encounter another three-day
weekend. Sure, it's right smack in the middle
of midterms, but there's no denying that an
extra day is . . . well, an extra day.
After a hectic week of classes, why not relax
and unwind while enjoying the Winter One
Acts? It's still not too late to catch these
original plays written, directed and performed
by students. Tickets are available in White
Plaza. The production begins at 8 p.m. at the
Elliot Program Center and will run until Sun
day, Feb. 14.
For those of you with musical interests, the
Lively Arts is presenting balalaika and man
dolin virtuoso Emanuil Sheynkman, who will
perform tonight, at 8 p.m. in Dinklespiel. Tick
ets are available at the Tresidder Ticket Office.
For all you romantics out there, Sunday
happens to be Valentine's Day. No school on
Monday means no excuses for missing the
flick on Sunday, "Pink Floyd: The Wall," which
can be seen at 7 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. at Memorial
Auditorium.
Casting call:
The Drama Department is readying up its
spring quarter schedule by holding auditions
for two forthcoming productions. Auditions
for "The Taste of Murder," a "mystery thriller
in two acts," will be held Monday and Tuesday,
Feb. 15 and 16, at 7 p.m. in Room 205,
Memorial Auditorium.
Auditions for "The Shadow," a "most un
usual fairy tale," will be held Tuesday and
Wednesday, Feb. 16 and 17, at 7 p.m. in the
Little Theater. Scripts for both plays are avail
able at the Drama Department office.
"I'd like to thank the Academy:"
Congratulations to graduate Kincaid Jones
for winning a first-place award in the Enter
tainment Division from the Academy of Tele
vision Arts and Sciences' college awards for
her drama, "The Red Wagon."
Jones made the 30-minute Film as part of
her graduate work in the graduate film pro
gram here at Stanford. The winning students
will be honored at an awards ceremony on
March 6 in Los Angeles.
