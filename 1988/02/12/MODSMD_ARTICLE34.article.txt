## Movie Review 'School' gets a passing grade 
### Erik Hagestad 
One can't help but admire Spike
Lee. He shocked the film world
with the success of his low
budgeted wonder of a film, "She's
Gotta Have It,"and now he's
back, the full force of Hollywood
behind him, as writer, producer
and director of "School Daze."
Lee has blended several genres
of film into a melting pot and the
result is what seems to be a hybrid
of "West Side Story" and "Animal
House."
Like "She's Gotta have It,"
Lee's new film grounds itself iri
American black culture while
portraying issues important to all
of society. "School Daze" centers
on the disputes between
nationalistic activists and the
mainstream, "whitified" Gamma
Phi Gamma fraternity members
at the all-black Mission College.
The story focuses on the con
flict between the "Jigaboos" and
the "Wannabees," dark-skinned
and light-skinned blacks. Such a

portrayal of divisions within the
Black community is a controver
sial subject, and Lee received
much criticism for not portraying
a unified movement.
Nonetheless, the film effectively
conveys the dominating tensions
which Lee feels to be subverting
the progress of the black people,
and the final message of the film
is a call for awareness of the
dangers such conflicts pose.
It is obvious where Lee's sym
pathy lies in the dispute. The fra
ternities are shown to be de
individualizing, and their black
and red uniforms and trooper
boots provide the perfect Nazi
esque image. The Gamma's thrive
on the world of image and sen
suality, and have little tolerance
for others who may want to
pursue higher ideals.
Despite the intriguing nature
of Lee's ideas, however, "School
Daze" itself is a disappointment
as a film. Gone are the wonder
fully inventive New Wave style
images and editing which made

"She's Gotta Have It" so inter
esting. The small blemishes which
added a rough and endearing
character to that film can still be
seen in "School Daze," but they
seem out of place and distracting
in its upscale environment.
Perhaps Spike Lee's attempt to
write, produce and direct was just
a bit too much on such an ex
travagant production. The film
suffers from stagnation; its jokes
are predictable, some lines feel
shallow, and the story flops from
scene to scene without much to
pull it along.
Any auteur working exclusively
may suffer a lack of objective in
sight, or of revitalizing new points
of view, and these may well be
the reasons for the stale nature
of "School Daze." It is amazing
that Lee has accomplished what
he has, and his integrity of
thought and expression must be
commended, but unfortunately,
this time the maverick filmmaker
seems to have stumbled over his
own independence.
