# Director hopes 'School' will promote unity
## 
### Erik Hagestad 
Spike Lee is an artist with a goal.
Working within an industry dominated
by mainstream entertainment, the
young, black filmmaker has main
tained his independence and ideology
through films such as "She's Gotta
Have It"and the new "School Daze"
that bring into prominence issues of
the black community.
"The black people are the most un
unified race on the face of the earth,"
said Lee at a recent press conference
promoting his new film. "School Daze"
portrays the conflicts between the
Jigaboo activists and Wannabee fra
ternity and sorority members at an
all-black college.
"Hopefully by putting this (disunity)
in my film," Lee continued, "I'll point
out the petty, cosmetic — and what I
feel to superficial — differences which
keep us apart as a people."
Lee blames much of the elitism
within the black community on the
media. "Much of the disunity is im
posed upon us to keep us down," he
said. "When you grow up black, you
rarely see dark-skinned personalities
in the media. When all you see is the

Lisa Bonet type, then you're not going
to want a dark sister."
The film has received criticism from
the black establishment for displaying
such conflicts, which it is argued
makes divisions even more pronoun
ced. Lee contends, however, that
"School Daze" depicts serious prob
lems "that have never been in any
film before," and hopefully, by point
ing out the pettiness of the conflicts,
he can start the black community
working together on more serious mat
ters.
"School Daze" is based upon Lee's
own experiences at Morehouse College,
where he majored in mass communi
cation. "There's a nurturing you get
at a black college that you don't
anywhere else," said Lee. "A lot of
times going to a white school you're
in a hostile environment, and I think
it's no coincidence that almost every
black leader has come from a black
college."
Ironically, Morehouse would not al
low Lee to film "School Daze" on its
campus, a situation that Lee blames
on the "overly conservative nature of
the Black establishment." He further
observed that "black people spend too

much time worrying about what white
people think. That's why they're upset
with my putting this (controversial)
stuff in my film."
The writer/producer/director also
addressed the complaint that his film
provides no resolutions to the prob
lems examined. "How can I give
answers to racial problems which
haven't been solved for hundreds of
years?" he stated, referring to prob
lems within the black race as well as
institutionalized racism such as Apart
heid. "All I'm trying to do is get us
thinking as a more unified body."
Asked about whether he approached
"School Daze" differently than his first
film, given it's $6 million budget from
Columbia Pictures ("She's Gotta Have
It" was privately financed for
$175,000), Lee claimed that there was
no difference, since the earlier film
was small and needed very little
money. "Making a musical like 'School
Daze' is expensive," he emphasized,
"and a musical for only $6 million is
a steal."
The real difference, according to
Lee, was having to deal with Holly
wood. "The big problem with Hol
lywood," he said, "is that they see you

as a black filmmaker; they ghetto-ize
you, make you a second-class citizen."
Referring specifically to a request
from Columbia Pictures to push back
the release of "School Daze" because
a black-oriented action film, "Action
Jackson," was opening the same day,
Lee said, "I think it's an insult to the
black movie-going audience to say that
we're not as diverse as white
audiences. You wouldn't postpone a
Woody Allen film because a Chuck
Norris film was opening the same
weekend."
Despite the pressures of Hollywood
and the possibility of a collaboration
with Eddie Murphy, Lee insists that
he will continue to make his own films.
"I feel I was born to make films, and
the films I'm going to make will be
about black people and for black
people."
Lee summed up by admitting that
he hopes to establish himself as a role
model for blacks. "I don't think of
myself as a pioneer," he explained,
"but I do hope to make it easier for
the next generation to do what I'm
doing, and hopefully to go beyond
that."
