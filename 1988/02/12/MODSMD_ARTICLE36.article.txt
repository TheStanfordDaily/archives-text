## Stanford avenges with a vengeance 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
PULLMAN, Wash. - The
review from last night's
Stanford-Washington
State game at the Beasley
Performing Arts Coliseum
is in. ...
Despite some rather

ugly shooting performances, it was a grip
ping drama that had everyone on their
feet until the final buzzer.
The Cardinal ensemble overcame a
shooting stretch that was colder than
Joan Collins, a timekeeper that was
slower than a Bartles and Jaymes com
mercial and a pack of pesky perimeter
players to edge the Cougars 51-50 (and
avenge a 70-68 loss last month at Maples
Pavillion) in front of a Beasley audience
of 4,052.
Cougar John Hodges front-rimmed a
potential game-winning 17-foot jump

shot with four seconds left in the game
to draw the curtain on the strange con
test.
"We'll just take this one and get out
of here," a relieved Cardinal Head Coach
Mike Montgomery said afterward.
The victory boosts Stanford record to
16-7 overall, 8-4 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. Washington State falls to 10-10,
5-6.
Cardinal forward Howard Wright
flipped in a left-handed layup and was
fouled with 30 seconds left in the game
to put Stanford ahead 51-50. Wright then
missed the free throw and the Cougars
set out on a 30-second quest for the
winning hoop which actually took 10
minutes.
At that point Stanford had three fouls
to give before the Cougars would be put
in the free-throw bonus situation. So the
Cardinal players began fouling, and the
Cougars kept calling time out.
After Stanford had fouled twice to cut

the time left to 11 seconds, Washington
State guard David Sanders took an in
bounds pass at half court and dribbled
to the foul line where he was fouled by
Bryan McSweeney.
The timekeeper, however, had been
late starting the clock â€” it read : 10.
Finally, after a Cougar time-out and a
referee conference, the clock was put at
eight seconds, and the last gasp was on
its way. Sanders, who beat Stanford at
Maples with a 24-foot shot in overtime,
got the inbounds pass but was bottled
up by two Cardinal defenders. He passed
it off to Hodges, who missed, and Stan
ford was victorious.
"I don't think [the clock controversy]
made any difference," Montgomery said.
"Basically I wanted to see [the refs] run
the whole thing over so we could take
more time off the clock with our sixth
[team] foul."
"We knew they wanted to get the ball
to Sanders," Stanford guard Terry Taylor

said. "The difference between him and
Hodges is that Hodges isn't used to hit
ting that shot."
In the first half, hardly anybody hit
any shots. Both teams shot dismally, and
Stanford went into the locker room with
a 19-18 lead.
Washington State started the cold spell
and the Cardinal led 7-0 with 16:12
remaining in the half. Stanford then pro
ceeded to go on a Bering Strait stretch
which lasted almost 10 minutes.
"I think we had 19 possessions (in the
first half) where we didn't get a shot to
go in," Montgomery said. "I don't know
if we can shoot any worse than that."
In that 10-minute stretch the Cardinal
went 0-for-10 from the field and 0-for-3
from the foul line.
Luckily for Stanford, the Cougars went
only 5-for-13 in that span, and when
Cardinal guard Todd Lichti finally broke
the cold-spell with a layup, Washington
State only led by three, 12-9.

"It's kind of strange shooting out there.
The depth perception is weird and the
rims are old or something," Taylor said.
"Sometimes it's contagious. One guys
starts missing, then we all miss and we
start thinking about it."
Nevertheless, Stanford had the lead at
halftime, and came out in the second
half working the ball inside and canning
3-pointers.
Two treys by Lichti and one by Taylor,
along with a couple inside hoops by
Wright, put the Cardinal back on a even
shooting keel, but the Cougars matched
those buckets all the way.
"Stanford played an awfully smart
game," Cougar Head Coach Kelvin
Sampson said. "We're not a good post
defending team, and they exploited that.
I'm not so sure Wright's not the best
player on that team right now."
Stanford travels to Seattle tomorrow
for a 2 p.m. contest against the Wash
ington Huskies.
