# Women's hoops plays for Pac-10 lead
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Last week at Maples Pavilion, the
then-No. 1 Arizona basketball team
discovered how vulnerable a visiting
team can be no matter how highly
it rates.
The Stanford women's basketball
team hopes to give Washington the

same lesson tonight as the No. 10 Cardinal seeks
to avenge its only loss of the season at 7:30 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion. KZSU-FM 90.1 will broadcast
the action.
The Huskies, ranked 12th on the Associated Press
poll, holds the top spot in the Pacific 10 Conference
with an 8-0 league record, 16-2 overall. Stanford
holds second place with an 8-1 mark, 20-1 overall,
making this contest a game of championship pro
portions.
"I hope we play the way we're capable of playing,
because then we'll have a really good game," Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "They're a really
good team; they haven't lost a game in the Pac-10,
and we'd be happy to be the spoiler by really taking
it to them."
This will be no easy feat for the Cardinal, as
Stanford learned in Seattle last month in front of
4,300 screaming fans. Now, with the home court
advantage, Stanford hopes to turn the tide.
"We're really fired up," sophomore forward Katy
Steding said. "We want a rematch bad. It's a revenge
game; people will deny that, but that's what it is.
They're our only loss of the season, and we want
it back.
"1 think that their home court advantage really
helped for them, like it will for us. Having a big
crowd will help us all of the time, but especially in
a game of this magnitude."
In any case, the Cardinal's challenge is formidable.
Next to Washington has the most balanced
team in the league. The Huskies are strong in all
aspects of the game.
"They have a good outside game, they have a
good inside game, they run well and they play good
defense," the Cardinal coach said. "We're going to
have to play a lot better than we did the first time."
In that contest, the Huskies held the Cardinal
to a mere 19 points in the first half to roll off a
77-59 win. Though Steding had a good game, ac
cruing 14 points and 10 rebounds, the rest of the
team struggled to match the inspired play of the
host team.
The secret to the Huskies' Seattle success lay in
the hands of a talented quartet. Senior forward
Lisa Oriard has been a perennial problem for the
Cardinal and other opponents, evidenced by her
team-high 11.8 points per game and 7.8 rebound
average. Fellow forward Traci Thirdgill and center
Karen Deden have also caused some offensive
damage this year.
Washington's biggest weapon, however, is guard
Yvette Cole. The junior is second on the team in

scoring with an average of 11.6
ppg and is currently third in the
Pac-10 in assists.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
the player who rates second in
this category is Stanford sopho
more guard Jennifer Azzi. Azzi
leads the team with 13.3 ppg, 131
total assists and 72 steals, and
could be the solution to the of
fensive problem that hindered
Stanford in the last meeting with
the Huskies.
"The biggest thing is confiden
ce," Azzi said. "I think we've built
up a lot since the Washington

game. The last time we played
them there were little spurts of
good play, team play, but I think
we got more together after the
loss."
The mtyor adjustment will be
a shift to the post players. "We'll
have to get inside," Azzi said.
"Last game, I don't think we got
inside nearly as much, but the
post and perimeter people are
communicating much better."
Saturday, Washington State
comes to the Farm at 7:30 p.m.
hoping to avenge its loss to the
Cardinal at Pullman. The
Cougars, who will battle with Cal
ifornia on Friday night to secure
fifth place in the Pac-10, are cur
rently 3-5 in league, 8-10 overall.

same lesson tonight as the No. 10 Cardinal seeks
to avenge its only loss of the season at 7:30 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion. KZSU-FM 90.1 will broadcast
the action.
The Huskies, ranked 12th on the Associated Press
poll, holds the top spot in the Pacific 10 Conference
with an 8-0 league record, 16-2 overall. Stanford
holds second place with an 8-1 mark, 20-1 overall,
making this contest a game of championship pro
portions.
"I hope we play the way we're capable of playing,
because then we'll have a really good game," Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "They're a really
good team; they haven't lost a game in the Pac-10,
and we'd be happy to be the spoiler by really taking
it to them."
This will be no easy feat for the Cardinal, as
Stanford learned in Seattle last month in front of
4,300 screaming fans. Now, with the home court
advantage, Stanford hopes to turn the tide.
"We're really fired up," sophomore forward Katy
Steding said. "We want a rematch bad. It's a revenge
game; people will deny that, but that's what it is.
They're our only loss of the season, and we want
it back.
"1 think that their home court advantage really
helped for them, like it will for us. Having a big
crowd will help us all of the time, but especially in
a game of this magnitude."
In any case, the Cardinal's challenge is formidable.
Next to Washington has the most balanced
team in the league. The Huskies are strong in all
aspects of the game.
"They have a good outside game, they have a
good inside game, they run well and they play good
defense," the Cardinal coach said. "We're going to
have to play a lot better than we did the first time."
In that contest, the Huskies held the Cardinal
to a mere 19 points in the first half to roll off a
77-59 win. Though Steding had a good game, ac
cruing 14 points and 10 rebounds, the rest of the
team struggled to match the inspired play of the
host team.
The secret to the Huskies' Seattle success lay in
the hands of a talented quartet. Senior forward
Lisa Oriard has been a perennial problem for the
Cardinal and other opponents, evidenced by her
team-high 11.8 points per game and 7.8 rebound
average. Fellow forward Traci Thirdgill and center
Karen Deden have also caused some offensive
damage this year.
Washington's biggest weapon, however, is guard
Yvette Cole. The junior is second on the team in

scoring with an average of 11.6
ppg and is currently third in the
Pac-10 in assists.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
the player who rates second in
this category is Stanford sopho
more guard Jennifer Azzi. Azzi
leads the team with 13.3 ppg, 131
total assists and 72 steals, and
could be the solution to the of
fensive problem that hindered
Stanford in the last meeting with
the Huskies.
"The biggest thing is confiden
ce," Azzi said. "I think we've built
up a lot since the Washington

game. The last time we played
them there were little spurts of
good play, team play, but I think
we got more together after the
loss."
The mtyor adjustment will be
a shift to the post players. "We'll
have to get inside," Azzi said.
"Last game, I don't think we got
inside nearly as much, but the
post and perimeter people are
communicating much better."
Saturday, Washington State
comes to the Farm at 7:30 p.m.
hoping to avenge its loss to the
Cardinal at Pullman. The
Cougars, who will battle with Cal
ifornia on Friday night to secure
fifth place in the Pac-10, are cur
rently 3-5 in league, 8-10 overall.
