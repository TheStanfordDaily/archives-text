# Card nine in 'ugly' Hawaii
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The weather in Hawaii is beau
tiful, but the baseball fans
aren't.
In fact, the 4,000 vocal locals
who turn out for every Univer
sity of Hawaii home game at
Rainbow Stadium in Honolulu

can get downright ugly at times.
But the Stanford baseball team, which opens
a three-game series at Hawaii tonight at 9
p.m. PST, is used to rowdy fans and got some
exposure to the Rainbow fans on a trip two
years ago.
"They definitely didn't take a liking to us,"
junior third baseman Ed Sprague said. "But
you have to expect that from any home fans
— they just love to rag you. ... It doesn't
affect us too much.
"They get obnoxious, but that's part of base
ball everywhere. ... If we let that affect us,
then we're not going to be very good," he said.
"Yeah, they're a boisterous bunch," senior
catcher Doug Robbins said. "I'd rate them
secfttid only to the people in Tucson, at
[Arizona]. They're a lot of fun."
Regardless of the crowd factor, the series
with the Rainbows will be a tough one for the

Cardinal. Stanford is 4-3 on the
season after a 4-1 defeat of Pacific
Tuesday in Stockton, and is
ranked second nationally in both
the Baseball America and
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball
preseason polls. The Rainbows,
members of the Western Athletic
Conference, are unbeaten in four
games. They are ranked No. 22
in the ESPN/Collegiate Baseball
poll and are unranked in the Base
ball America poll.
The Rainbows traditionally
tailor their team to the expanse
and artificial turf of Rainbow
Stadium. This weekend's series
should be a study in contrasts —
between the swift Rainbows and
the powerful Cardinal.
And after an up-and-down
start, Stanford will be looking to
get some momentum as Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
play approaches.
"We're very excited about it,"
Robbins said. "It's a preseason

series against a very quality team.
We're looking to win the series,
because we're looking down the
road, and these non-league series
become very important later on
in determining whether you get
an at-large berth in the NCAAs."
"We feel very confident going
up against Hawaii," senior desig
nated hitter Jeff Saenger said.
"We're not down on ourselves. We
know we have the tools to get
better.
There are distractions inherent
in any trip to Hawaii, but the
players left Wednesday so that
they'd have a chance to relax yes
terday before gearing up for the
game tonight.
"We're going there to play
baseball," Sprague said. "We're
not going there to lay out in the
sun. Getting there early gives us
a chance to have some fun, but
come Friday, it's game time. . . .
I think the guys on our team are
smart enough not to lay out in
the sun and turn into lobsters."
The series continues with
games at 9 p.m. PST tomorrow
and 7 p.m. PST Sunday.
