# NorCal invite at Stanford
## 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
In a tournament marked by the
return of Cardinal freshman
phenom David Wheaton, the
Stanford men's tennis team will
host the Hobee's 41st Annual
Northern California Intercol
legiate Tennis Championships

at Stanford Tennis Stadium tomorrow through
Tuesday.
Wheaton, who was the nation's top recruit
last season, was a finalist at the Volvo/ITCA
All America Championships this fall and is
the third-rated player in the country. However,
Wheaton injured his left wrist in December,
and has not played in the Cardinal's first four
dual matches.
Although Wheaton is still unable to hit his
two-handed backhand, he will enter the
doubles field this weekend with sophomore
Jeff Tarango. Tarango and Wheaton were one
of the top U.S. junior teams two years ago
and are the tournament's top seed.
"I can do everything completely normal ex
cept the two-handed backhand," Wheaton said.
"But that shouldn't affect me too much in
doubles. Playing doubles will be a good way
to ease into my first home match."
Seventy-five singles entries and 37 doubles
tandems make this year's tournament the big
gest draw ever. Players come from 13 schools
in Northern California, including California
and San Jose State. Play starts early each
morning and continues all day, beginnning at
8 a.m. tomorrow, 9 a.m. Sunday and 9:30 a.m.
Monday. If an extra day is needed, the tour
nament final will be played Tuesday at 1:30
p.m.
Past tournament singles champions include
Stanford grads John Whitlinger (1974-75),wh0
is the current Stanford assistant coach, Tim
Mayotte (1980), Roscoe Tanner (1970) and
Dan Goldie (1984). Last year's surprise winner
was Cal freshman Kurt Streeter.
"We're proud to be hosting the tournament,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said. "We're
looking at this tournament as a chance to give
us some input to solidify our lineup for the
team indoors (National Team Indoors in Ixniis
ville Feb. 17-21)."
Stanford has four of the eight seeded singles
players, including top-seed Patrick McEnroe.
Tarango, freshman Martin Blackman, and
sophomore Jeff Cathrall are the other Cardinal
seeds. Cal's Woody Hunt, Ted Scherman and
Streeter and San Jose's Malcolm Allen are
also singles seeds.
