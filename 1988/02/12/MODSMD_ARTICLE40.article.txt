# Men's swimmers face midterm exams
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Midterms are not
yet over for all
Stanford students.
This weekend,
the men's swim
ming team faces its
toughest test

before finals — the NCAAs —
when it takes on Pacific 10 Con
ference rivals USC and UCLA.
And if it passes, the Cardinal
could well be on its way to a
fourth consecutive NCAA crown.
This season's meet against USC
not only pits the traditional con
ference rivals, but the 1987 NCAA
champions and runners-up. And
with emotions always running
high in the annual clash, the meet
promises to be close.
Although it is defending na
tional champion, the fourth
ranked Cardinal is going in as the
underdog when it battles the No.
1 Trojans at 2 p.m. in Los Angeles.
USC boasts an unblemished 6-0
dual meet record, and with five
NCAA individual champions, is
the favorite for the NCAA title.
The Trojans hope to knock off
the Cardinal with the talents of
freshman David Wharton, the
current American and past world
record holder in the 400-meter

individual medley. Also leading
the attack will be freestyler Mike
O'Brian, 1984 Olympic gold
medalist in the 1500 free, current
200-breaststroke record holder
Steve Bentley and defending
NCAA 500-free champion Dan
Jorgensen.
"On paper we have no right
winning this meet," Coach Skip
Kenney said. "If we do it will be
an upset."
However, the Cardinal is know
for pulling off the unexpected, and
with three NCAA champions of
its own and a talent for coming
from behind, it will not give in
easily.
"The guys on the team believe
without a doubt that we can win,"
tri-Captain (and 1984 Olympian)
Anthony Mosse said.
According to Kenney, the key
to the meet will be the sprint and
breaststroke events. In addition,
he is counting heavily on Stan
ford's divers, Matt Frawley and
Mike Burton. "If we can go one
two on both boards (the one and
three meter competitions) and
win the medley relay it might be
too much for USC to overcome."
Stanford's Saturday meet will
not be a walkover either. Al
though the Bruins have not tradi-

qualify for NCAAs. H M
tionally been a problem for the Cardinal,
the ninth-ranked team boasts several
superstars of its own and is coming off
big wins over Arizona and Arizona
State. The undefeated squad is spear
headed by world-ranked Giovanni
Minervini, NCAA 100-breast champion,

and freestyler Craig Oppel.
The opening event, the medley relay,
could again set the tone of the contest.
According to Kenney, the distance
events will be of much importance to
the Cardinal's chances, and the diving
competitions could affect the outcome
of this meet as well.
Times should be blistering at both
the USC and UCLA competitions. Not
only are some of the top swimmers in
the nation squaring off, but the three

squads have rested for the first time
this year.
Three Cardinal swimmers have al
ready qualified for the NCAA cham
pionships: butterflier Mosse and back
strokers Sean Murphy and Jay Morten
son. Kenney feels at least five more
swimmers (freestyler John Witchel,
backstrokers Matt Nance, Rickty Gould
and Kurt Kroesche, and breaststroker
Matt Rodgers) should post qualifying
times in Los Angeles.
