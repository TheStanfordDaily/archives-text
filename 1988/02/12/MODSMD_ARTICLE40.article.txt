Midterms are not
yet over for all
Stanford students.
This weekend,
the men's swim
ming team faces its
toughest test

before finals — the NCAAs —
when it takes on Pacific 10 Con
ference rivals USC and UCLA.
And if it passes, the Cardinal
could well be on its way to a
fourth consecutive NCAA crown.
This season's meet against USC
not only pits the traditional con
ference rivals, but the 1987 NCAA
champions and runners-up. And
with emotions always running
high in the annual clash, the meet
promises to be close.
Although it is defending na
tional champion, the fourth
ranked Cardinal is going in as the
underdog when it battles the No.
1 Trojans at 2 p.m. in Los Angeles.
USC boasts an unblemished 6-0
dual meet record, and with five
NCAA individual champions, is
the favorite for the NCAA title.
The Trojans hope to knock off
the Cardinal with the talents of
freshman David Wharton, the
current American and past world
record holder in the 400-meter

individual medley. Also leading
the attack will be freestyler Mike
O'Brian, 1984 Olympic gold
medalist in the 1500 free, current
200-breaststroke record holder
Steve Bentley and defending
NCAA 500-free champion Dan
Jorgensen.
"On paper we have no right
winning this meet," Coach Skip
Kenney said. "If we do it will be
an upset."
However, the Cardinal is know
for pulling off the unexpected, and
with three NCAA champions of
its own and a talent for coming
from behind, it will not give in
easily.
"The guys on the team believe
without a doubt that we can win,"
tri-Captain (and 1984 Olympian)
Anthony Mosse said.
According to Kenney, the key
to the meet will be the sprint and
breaststroke events. In addition,
he is counting heavily on Stan
ford's divers, Matt Frawley and
Mike Burton. "If we can go one
two on both boards (the one and
three meter competitions) and
win the medley relay it might be
too much for USC to overcome."
Stanford's Saturday meet will
not be a walkover either. Al
