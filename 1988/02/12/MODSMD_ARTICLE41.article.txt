# Wily wrestlers face 'Dogs, Roadrunners

### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
Vacations never
seem quite long
enough.
Stanford's
wrestling team
heads south
today for a

weekend road trip which in
cludes stops at Fresno State
and Cal State-Bakersfield.
These dual meets will be the
first action that the Cardinal
has seen since the Jan. 30 All-
Cal tournament.
Two weeks of rest, however,
has done little to improve the
health of several members of
the squad. Freshman Loren
Vigil, who ruptured a bursa in
his knee, will be unable to com
pete in his 126-pound bracket,
and sophomore Ron Perry, at
177 pounds, will be hampered
by an injury to his ribs.
Tonight against FSU, Stan
ford faces a strong Bulldog
team which placed second in
the All-Cal competition. After
forfeiting at 118 and 126
pounds, it will be up to the
remaining eight members of
the Cardinal squad to make up
the deficit.
"We're definitely the under
dogs," Stanford Coach Chris
Horpel said. "But if everyone

who's healthy wrestles well,
we've got a chance to win as
a team."
Perry will wrestle tonight,
but is still questionable for
Saturday's meet at Bakersfield.
Depending on how he feels, he
may or may not compete in the
second dual competition. With
the Pacific 10 Conference and
NCAA qualifying meet only
two weeks away, Horpel wants
to keep his wrestlers healthy.
"These meets are important,
but what really matters is the
Pac-10 tournament," said Hor
pel. "We need to be ready for
that."
The biggest dual-meet chal
lenge of the season will take
place at 5 p.m. Saturday, when
the Cardinal takes the mat
against the Roadrunners.
Bakersfield took first at the All-
Cal and should prove to be a
strong contender for the Pac
-10 title.
"If Perry's ready on Satur
day, we could conceivably win
five matches and take the
meet," said Horpel. "They
should be a good test for us."
Stanford's final home meet
of the season will take place
on February 20 at 7:30 p.m.
when the Cardinal hosts San
Jose State.
