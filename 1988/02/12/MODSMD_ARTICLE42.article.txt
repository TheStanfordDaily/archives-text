# Netters not hoping for the best

Something about
the Stanford
women's tennis
team traditionally
brings out the best
in San Diego State,
but the Aztecs'

best this season is not as good as
it has been in the past.
Two years ago San Diego State
gave the then-No. 1 Cardinal a
mighty scare in San Diego, but
since that time the Aztecs have
seen several good players depart
from the scene.
As a result, today's 1:30 p.m.
match here between the top
ranked Cardinal and the No. 18
Aztecs may not be as close as the
two teams have come to expect.
"We normally wouldn't like to
play a team that good this early
in the season, but they may not
be as good (as usual)," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said. "I
think we might get lucky and have
a little easier match. .. . They're
in a little of a down year."
Despite having played a number
of close matches against Stanford,
the Aztecs have never conquered
the Cardinal. They may, however,
be aided this afternoon by the
absence of one of Stanford's top
guns.
Sophomore Lisa Green is at
tempting to qualify today for the
Virginia Slims of Oakland tour
nament, and depending upon
when her qualifying match ends,

she may not make it back to Stan
ford in time to play singles in the
dual match.
"It's an unusual opportunity
for Lisa. She's sort of the local
wild card," Brennan said, refer
ring to the fact that Green hails
from San Jose. "(By letting Green
play in Oakland), I'm taking a
little bit of a gamble, but I think
we'll be all right."

Trn taking a little bit
of a gamble, but I
think we'll be all
right.'

The Aztecs are 1-0 on the
season, having defeated Nevada-
Las Vegas 6-3. The Cardinal, com
ing off of a 9-0 drubbing of
Hawaii, is 3-0.
San Diego is led by freshman
Julie Tullberg. Junior Sondra
Mitchell played No. 1 singles
against UNLV, but Tullberg is
considered the best player on the
squad and is ranked 40th in the
ITCA preseason singles rankings.
Tullberg has not fared well
recently, however. She lost at No.
2 singles against UNLV and
dropped two matches at last
weekend's Rolex National Indoor
Intercollegiate Tennis Champion
ships in Minneapolis.
Eleni Rossides — Stanford's top

singles player — will play in her
first dual match of the season
today, but she may not play No.
1. The Cardinal junior has a slight
muscle pull, and Brennan said he
would decide where to play her
after watching yesterday's prac
tice.
The only thing certain about

the Cardinal doubles teams is that
Green and Rossides will play No.
3. The team of Tami and Teri
Whitlinger and the duo of Cari
Hagey and Sandra Birch are in
terchangeable at this point, ac
cording to Brennan. As of yester
day, he was not certain which
would play No. 1 in today's match.

Stanford freshman sensation Tami Whitlinger lunges for a backhand
volley. She and her sister Teri will team up for doubles today.
