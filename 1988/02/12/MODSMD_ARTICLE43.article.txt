# Card ends dual meet season
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
While most Stanford stu
dents now can only see
the end of midterms dis
tantly through a haze,
the women's swimming
team has already
reached that point.

The squad's meet against California
at deGuerre Pool at noon tomorrow
marks the end of the 1987-88 dual meet
season and should provide the second
ranked Cardinal with one last test
before the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships, Feb. 25-27.
Stanford comes in with a 5-1 mark
after a tough loss to four-time defending
national champion Texas last weekend,
and the team will face a severe challenge
from the fourth-ranked Golden Bears.
"They're going to be really tough,"
according to senior Jen Pokluda. "I
know we can win, but ... we definitely
are not taking them lightly."
The Stanford-California rivalry in
women's swimming has not really ex
isted lately as the Cardinal has been
perennially stronger overall than the

Bears, but Pokluda thinks this will serve
as motivation for one of the best Cal
teams in memory.
"Because of the Stanford-Cal rivalry
. . . they really want to beat us, and
they mean business. They'll probably
be pretty rested, too," she added.
Stanford, on the other hand, will not
be resting much for the meet as the
team continues training with the NCAA
Championships in mind. The Cardinal
is coming off by far its fastest meet of
the season in last week's Texas meet,
and expects even faster times this week.
"We were really happy with the way
we swam (last week) for how rested we
were," sophomore Amy Jo Reinhold
said. "(But) we still have some big (time)
drops left in us. That's been our goal
all season, trying to keep our times
descending."
The team has met that goal with
success so far this season, and despite
the tiring training schedule, nine swim
mers have already hit NCAA qualifying
times.
The breaststroke has been Stanford's
best event all year (four different swim
mers have already qualified for NCAAs

in that event), but the Cardinal will be
hard-pressed to come up with a win
tomorrow as the Bears boa9t the
nation's top breaststroker in Hiroko
Nagasaki.
The California freshman beat Tracey
McFarlane in both the 100- and 200-
yard events in the Texas-California dual
meet last Sunday. McFarlane only hap
pens to be the American record-holder
in the 100, and won both breaststroke
events in the Cardinal's clash with
Texas last Saturday.
"She's been on the national scene for
years," Reinhold said of Nagasaki. "It's
more a case of who's going to get the
other points (for second through fifth).
She's about three seconds faster than
their other swimmers, so our job is to
get in between (Nagasaki and the other
Bears). The trick is to have a lot of
people (finish well)."
The scoring system for the meet
rewards having depth more than having
one or two outstanding swimmers. This
should play into the Cardinal's hand,
especially in the breast and backstroke
events, where Stanford is as deep as
any team in the country.
