# Gymnasts seek mettle
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
If there's one question on
the minds of all red-blooded
Americans, it probably has
nothing to do with men's
gymnastics at Stanford Uni
versity. But if it did, that
question would be, "We

know they have the physical ability, but
are they mentally tough enough?"
With a 6-0 record and a top team score
of 278.55, it might seem at first that the
question is a stupid one. However, tomor
row, at the UCLA Invitational, the Cardinal
will be facing by far its toughest competi
tion of the season until the NCAA Cham
pionships in April.
After the recent meets, in which they
competed only against themselves, the
Stanford gymnasts now enter competition
where slight errors will not be forgiven in
the final team standings.
"The routines we have are quality," soph
omore Charles Loop said, "(but) whether
we're mentally tough, we'll see. I think
after this week of practice we are."
Challenging Stanford's strength will be
the strength of last year's No. 1 and No.
2 teams, UCLA and Nebraska, and this
season's No. 1 team, Illinois. Minnesota
and Ohio State round out as competitive
a meet as could be imagined. Individually,
the meet will be a showcase of U.S. Na
tional Team members as well as over 10
gymnasts who have a fighting chance to
make the 1988 U.S. Olympic Team.
"UCLA at home is the team to beat,"
Loop said, while simultaneously emphasiz
ing the meet's parity. "I think we have a
chance to take first or sixth."
After two strong meets last weekend,
despite injuries to two of its top three
gymnasts, the Cardinal has proven it has

reached a skill level that could bring the
team a score near 285 if everything goes
right.
Recovering from injuries sustained last
week, senior Randy Besosa will be perform
ing on all events at the Invitational. Class
mate Chuck Gerardo, however, is question
able for the vault and floor exercise. In
the events the two did compete in last
Sunday, their performances were superior.
Gerardo's 56.20 all-around score last Fri
day night is the team best since the holiday
recess.
Senior Mike Matzek's overall perform
ance last Sunday suffered due to falls off
both the pommel horse and parallel bars.
On the other apparati, Matzek excelled,
including performances of 9.75 and 9.7, on
the rings and floor exercise, respectively.
The expectation of a command performance
from Matzek is another reason for the
team's optimism.
Besides the return of Besosa from a red
shirt season last year, this season's Cardi
nal is especially improved in terms of depth.
According to junior Scott Schaffer, there
has been a great amount of fierce, but
friendly, intrasquad competition. Only six
gymnasts can compete on any one event.
"It makes us all work a lot harder,"
Schaffer said, after last Sunday's meet.
"We all want to compete and be part of
the team as much as possible, and this
year we have so many good people. . . .
Even Randy and Chuck and Mike are
having to fight off the rest of us to keep
their positions on the events."
This is truly a meet highlighting the
best of collegiate gymnastics in recent
years. Nebraska, Stanford, and UCLA
finished second, third, and fourth, respec
tively, at the 1986 NCAA Championships.
Amazingly, the three teams are essentially
identical in membership to their 1986
teams.
