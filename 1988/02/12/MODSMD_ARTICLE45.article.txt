# Storm warnings ahead for women
## 
### Chris Kendrick Staff writer 
A storm is im
minent for the
Stanford women's
gymnastics team.
But for the mo
ment, the Cardinal
has the relative

calm of facing 15th-ranked Fuller
ton State.
This weekend's meet launches
the team into the most intense
period of its season. After
tonight's meet, the team returns
home to face Fullerton State
ngain next Friday and then travels
to Tempe, Ariz., for the South
west Cup, starting a pattern of
two meets per weekend. Each of
the upcoming opponents —
UCLA, Arizona State, Nebraska
and Oklahoma — is presently in
the top 10 in the nation.
"We're going into the lion's
teeth," Stanford Coach Homer
Sardina said. "We're really
meeting with the very best."
Traveling down south adds
some difficulty to the competition
because the judging is partial to
the home teams, according to Sar
dina.
Generally, it is tough to score
high at Fuilerton because most of
the judges favor UCIJ\, according
to Stanford Asst. Coach Sam
Shaw.
Sardina plans to focus on the
quality and the easo of the
performances to de-emphasize
any possible scoring d is -
crepancies.
"We're going to avoid looking

at the scores and we're going to
look at hit routines — how many
routines we hit in a row and how
many routines we hit on each
event,"he said. "That's how we'll
determine our progress."
Sardina has entered a young
team, and five of the seven gym
nasts in the lineup (freshmen
Julie Dunhill and Christie
Volastro, sophomores Dina
Amoroso and Becky Ashton, and
junior Laurence George) are com
peting in the all-around.
Senior Cindy Boyd and sopho
more Marietta Frey will perform
in a duet as the sixth all-around
entrant. Boyd is competing in the
vault, the balance beam and the
floor exercise while Frey is han
dling the bar routine.
Entering such a youthful team
serves a dual purpose for Sardina.
"We want to improve our depth,"
he said. "There are some people
competing that can impact our
program at the end of the season
and they have to be seasoned and
get into some competitions."
Confidence and consistency
gained in these early competitions
will give the young gymnasts the
experience they will need to have
an impact on the Cardinal's post
season bid.
The veteran members of the
team will be strengthened by the
break from competition.
"We're resting some of our
weary bodies because the hard
part of the season starts next
week," Sardina said.
"The girls are on a good, solid,
positive run right now," Cook
said.



Christie Volastro holds a fine line off the vault.
