Attempting to
pick up where
the men's bas
ketball team left
off, the Stan
ford women's
golf team will

enter next week's Arizona In
tercollegiate looking to bounce
back from a subpar perform
ance.
After last week's debacle in
the freezing rain at the
Yamaha-USC Invitational,
where the Cardinal fininshed
eighth out of 12 teams, the
team is looking forward to
Monday's opening round at
Randolph Park Golf Club in
Tuscon. The par-72, 6,100-yard
course is t he former site of the
PGA Tucson Open and the cur
rent location of the LPGA Tuc
son Circle-K Match Play Cham
pionships.
"It was a rough outing for
us last week," said an optimis
tic Coach Tim Baldwin. The
team has been working hard
all week and is eager to begin
the drive toward NCAAs, ac
cording to him.
Baldwin anticipates a great
tournament as five of the
nation's top 10 teams —
Arizona State, USC, New

Mexico, Arizona, and Texas —
will participate. Last year the
Cardinal made a strong
showing, finishing third to
ASU and USC.
"It's going to be basically the
same set of characters (as last
year)," Baldwin said.
"This is going to be a
fabulous tournament," said
freshman Michele Lyford, who
feels that she has finally gotten
on track after a final-round 77
at last week's tourney.
"I've been playing well all
week," she said, "and I have a
feeling I'm going to do well."
While Baldwin will be
looking for Lyford and fellow
freshman Kristin Ryan to
lower their scores, the spotlight
will be on senior Kay Cornelius
and freshman Jodi Figley.
Cornelius, a preseason All-
American, is hoping to improve
her driving. "I'm looking to
generally hit the ball more
solidly, particularly off the
tee," she said.
Figley, who opened last week
with a blistering 75 and
finished in the top 10 in her
third consecutive tournament,
has been working on her men
tal preparation and her short
game. "I hope I keep playing
the way I have been," she said.
