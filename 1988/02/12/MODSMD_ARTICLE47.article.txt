# If it's Saturday, it must be Chico St.

### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
In preparation for
tomorrow's 3 p.m.
match with Chico
State, Stanford
Men's Volleyball
Coach Fred Sturm
decided to do

something unique in practice yes
terday.
The Wildcats, who lost to the
12th-ranked Cardinal last Satur
day 4-15, 15-8, 15-12, 15-6, come
into the game as big underdogs,
but Sturm remains somewhat
concerned.
"Chico is a scrappy team that
will really hustle hard," Sturm
said, "but they are certainly vul
nerable in some spots, most spe
cifically at outside blocking."
So, after starting practice with
the typical passing and setting
drills, Sturm decided to run a
three-man tournament last night.
Although the scene at Maples
didn't compare with the NCAA
finals, the adrenalin pumped
faster and faster as the evening
wore on.
In the end, it was the team of
senior Darryl Rouse and freshmen
Jay Ogas and John Alstrom which
outdistanced the rest of the four
team field. They defeated the
squad of sophomore Parker Black
man, junior Dave Johnson, and
sophomore Scott Pederson in the
final game by the score of 8-3.
"We were finally able to get it
together after our opening loss,"
Rouse said. "In the opening game
we were a little slow and I was
setting too high, but from then
on out we played real tough."
"I picked that team from the
outset," Sturm said. "Although

they started slow, they were able
to come on and prove their su
periority."
Beyond giving the players an
opportunity to work on every
facet of the game, the three-man
drill gave everyone a chance at a
little friendly competition in a
non-competitive setting. The
mental aspect of preparing for a
match was stressed as each team
member was asked to get psyched
for some games that really don't
matter in the long haul. And that
should be the key tomorrow.
"It really doesn't matter who
we're against." Sturm said. "We
have to be ready to play, especially
in the first game."
Stanford (5-8) wasn't ready the
last time they played Chico St.
The Wildcats bit them by the
score of 15-4 in the opening game.
Fortunately, the bite wasn't fatal.
The Cardinal needs to be espe
cially careful from here on out,
but not just about wins and losses.
Stanford had to face the news
that talented freshman Ryan
O'Hara would have to redshirt
this season. That leaves Blackman
as the lone Stanford setter, and
any injury to him would
seemingly be devestating.
As a result of the news, Rouse,
who has never played setter
before in organized competition,
is beginning to get some work in
that area.
"I've got to get those fingers
ready," he said. "You never know
what might happen."
Stanford fans might get a taste
of a Rouse-directed Cardinal of
fense tomorrow night. It's a non
conference contest that poses no
great challenge for Stanford, so
Sturm could certainly be willing
to try anything.
