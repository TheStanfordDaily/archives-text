# Film seeks SDI awareness
## Student-produced video explores researcher's dilemma 
### Eric Rosenfeld 
Individual students, working with the University,
have created a film designed to educate undergrad
uates about the dilemma Strategic Defense Initiative
research poses to the Stanford community.
Sponsored by the ASSU, the Office of Residential
Education and Physicians for Social Responsibility,
"Star Wars Research: A University Perspective," a
student-produced documentary, contains interviews
with administrators, graduate students and profes
sors.
The 39-minute film, which will be shown in 12
dorms spring quarter, took 10 months to make and
had a production budget of $1,800, according to
producer Diane Honigberg, a graduate student in
Education. "The film is an intellectual experience.
It's intended to teach, to raise consciousness and
to foster community debate," she said.
Honigberg, who opposes SI)I research at Stanford,
invited Electrical Engineering graduate student
Rose Ritts, a proponent of such research, to join
her as associate producer of the project.
"Our approach was like collecting data; we didn't
know how it would turn out," Honigberg said. "Like
an experiment, we leave the analysis to the viewer."
"SDI is esoteric, but very real," Honigberg said.
"I was concerned that undergraduates learn more
about Stanford's role and the complex issues invol
ved."
In 1987, funds for Strategic Funds Initiative re
search at Stanford ran in excess of $27 million.
Given that many University research opportunities
are now sponsored by and dependent upon SDI,
some Stanford faculty and graduate students face
moral dilemnas when selecting which research proj
ects to undertake.

"The University's policy on classified research is
very simple," says Kennedy in the film, "It doesn't
have any. That decision was reached ... on the
basis of faculty conviction that it wasn't possible
to have two research ventures at Stanford co
existing in a way that they would tangle each other
up — one venture being open and dependent on
normal routes of scientific publication and the open
ness of inquiry, the other venture being in effect
closed."
In the film, Kennedy comments that the Univer
sity can play its best role as an "effective encourager
of the research work that the members of its faculty
decide to do." Believing that most faculty "decide
these questions on the basis of their own interests
. . . and where the highest and best use of their
own time and energy lie," Kennedy argues for a
"light regulatory touch."
Electrical Engineering Prof. Joseph Goodman, in
ventor of the free electron laser and recipient of
SDI funding, argues in the film that "externally
supported research (at Stanford) has to have the
following attributes: You have to be able to say
who your sponsor is, the results have to be open
and publishable, and we cannot have the principal
investigator or anyone associated with the project
required to have a security clearance."
"The particular work that is being supported is
exceedingly broad in its applicability," Goodman
continues. "If we were to say that because the SDI
needs high-performance computers we will no longer
work on techniques for generating high-performance
computers, we would be cutting off our toes for no
reason.... I think there's sufficient justification to
do the work."
Offering a different opinion,
Electrical Engineering graduate
student Kurt Weber laments in
the video that every individual
who wishes to do engineering re
search must make a choice be

tween his moral feelings and his
need to get funding.
"The University is at the mercy
of the market," agrees Computer
Science Assoc. Prof. Terry
Winograd, who is national presi
dent of Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility. "If the
money is from SDI, there's no
choice about taking it,"he argues
in the documentary. "We need to
examine how the overall structure

pressures people into taking
funds.
"Students who wish to avoid
SDI-funded projects are limited
to more mathematical theory
areas sponsored by National Sci
ence Foundation grants,"
Winograd says. "Areas such as ar
tificial intelligence and operations
systems are unavailable" to those
who refuse military-sponsored
funding.
