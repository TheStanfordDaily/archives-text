# Western Culture tracks disregard core readings
## Although 'required,' core list is not enforced 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Although discussion of the future of the Univer
sity's Western Culture requirement has narrowed
to a debate over the fate of the required core list,
few of the Western Culture tracks actually assign
all of these required readings, according to instruc
tors in the program.
Barry Katz, a lecturer in the Values in Technol
ogy, Science and Society course and a strong sup
porter of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies
proposal that would abolish the core list, admitted
that his track does not follow the core "precisely
— but we never have." He added that "virtually
all of the tracks regard the core as people regard
the 55-mph speed limit."
Of the 15 selections on the required core list, the
only books assigned by all eight tracks this year
were the Bible and Machiavelli's "The Prince."
However, the level of compliance varies greatly
from track to track. Only the Humanities track
assigns all of the 15 books. Structured Liberal Ed
ucation requires 14, Conflict and Change covers
nine, and the History track requires seven.
According to Katz, the fact that so many tracks
are disregarding core requirements is evidence that
the idea of a core list is inherently flawed. "I would
say, that if people are already doing it (violating
the core), that there is something wrong," he said.
"There is no doubt that this raises an interesting
and difficult problem," said English Prof. William
Chace, author of a senate counterproposal to retain
the core list.
The core list specifies 15 required works students
in all tracks are supposed to read. According to a
description of the Western Culture program in
"Courses and Degrees," all tracks "share a core of
readings, insuring that all students will be exposed
to certain great works."
Assoc. History Prof. Judith Brown, who taught
the History track fall quarter, acknowledged that
"we are supposed to read all of the required works,
but there wasn't any problem" with not reading
some of the works.
The Faculty Senate's Western Culture Program
Committee "authorize(s) tracks, (but) it does not
review the syllabi," according to History Prof. Paul
Robinson, the committee's chair.
But Thomas Wasow, dean of Undergraduate
Studies and an ex officio member of the committee,
said it is his understanding that the Western Culture
Program Committee is responsible for enforcing
adherence to the core list. "I don't know how it

has happened in the past that courses were certified
whose syllabi don't include all of the core readings."
Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Hester Gelber, also
a committee member, noted that enforcement of
the core list is "done informally. ... If there is great
departure (from the core), then the system has
broken down."
The core is not strictly enforced, according to
Robinson, because "universities, at least this one,
just don't run that way. We work on a basis of trust.
"Members of the faculty are responsible, and want
to teach a course in the best light of the assumptions
of the legislation," he said.
