# Kennedy assails media distortion
## 
### John Pollack Senior staff writer 
Concerned with possible public misperceptions of
Stanford's Western Culture debate, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy released a letter yesterday
criticizing distorted and oversimplified national
press accounts of the controversy here.
In a letter sent to more than 900 alumni and
University supporters, Kennedy disputed accounts
in the national press and comments by U.S. Sec
retary of Education William Bennett alleging that
the proposed Western Culture modification
represents a surrender on the part of Stanford
faculty to the "noisiest" elements of the Stanford
community, namely feminists and minority stu
dents.
Kennedy called such allegations "a cynical and
irresponsible form of simplification. . . . and patently
wrong."
He added that such mischaracterization of the
issues in the Western Culture debate "conjures up
the worst sort of visions, ones that play to that
same dark side of human nature that we aim to
eradicate by offering — indeed requiring — a
broadened cultural and intellectual education."
Kennedy said last night the letter was aimed
primarily at people "outside the immediate range
of the thoughtful debate here at Stanford." He
added that the letter will probably
be sent to certain press organiza
tions, as well as to other univer
sity presidents around the
country. Kennedy said he hoped
the letter would give them a "bet
ter idea of what is going on here."
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow also expressed
concern about the national
media's coverage of the debate
here. He praised Kennedy's letter,
as well as a similar letter by Uni
versity Provost James Rosse
released Monday. "I think both
Kennedy and Rosse's responses
are extremely balanced and ac
curate," he said.
Wasow called a Jan. 18 New
York Times article on Stanford's
Western Culture debate "quite in
accurate" and said he was "espe
cially unhappy" with National
Public Radio's treatment of the
issue last Saturday on its
"Weekend Edition" program.
Mary Pratt, associate professor
of Comparative Literature,
praised the "strong language" of
Kennedy's letter and faulted
much of the national press

coverage of the debate, calling it
"very distorted."
Pratt was one of three authors
of a recent letter signed by over
70 faculty members supporting
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies' proposal to modify the
Western Culture requirement.

According to Ken
nedy, the proposed
modifications are
hardly a 'self
imposed curricular
debasement,' as Ben
nett alleged.

In his letter, Kennedy
downplayed faculty differences
over the proposed elimination of
the core list of required readings.
He emphasized instead that most
faculty members agree that the
Western Culture requirement
must be modified to more ade
quately address the contributions
of women and minorities to the
development of contemporary
American culture.

"The essential point is that we
have reached something close to
fundamental consensus on the
merits of broadening what Stan
ford offers its freshmen by way
of a common intellectual experien
ce," Kennedy wrote in the letter.
Pratt, however, said the divi
sion between those who want to
retain the core list and those who
want to abolish it should not be
dismissed lightly. "Whatever de
cision the senate makes is one
that will have a great outcome
for faculty and students."
Kennedy reiterated that the
current debate is part of an on
going process of review that began
with the establishment of the
Western Culture requirement in
1980.
"The proposals now incor
porated in the Area One (Western
Culture) modification are there
fore the culmination of an appro
priate dialogue among scholars
that extends from November
1979," the letter reads.
According to Kennedy, the pro
posed modifications are "hardly a
'self-imposed curricular
debasement,' " as Bennett al
leged.
"We're proud of [the debate],"
Kennedy said.
