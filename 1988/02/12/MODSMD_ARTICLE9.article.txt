Pledging a policy of non
intervention in economic, per
sonal and foreign affairs, lib
ertarian presidential candidate
Ron Paul brought his fiery con
demnation of big government
to a crowd of almost 200 in
Cubberley Auditorium last
night.
Speaking at Stanford as part
of a week-long college tour that
has included MIT, the Univer
sity of Virginia, William &
Mary and UC-Berkeley, Paul
stressed that he shares the Lib
ertarian Party's commitment
to protection of personal
liberties. He also emphasized
the need for a smaller, less
wasteful goverment.
"A leadership has developed

that requires innovation in
thinking up programs to waste
money," said Paul, who is a
four-term Republican con
gressman from Houston,
Texas. In a speech that focused
largely on economic problems,
Paul advocated several
reforms, including abolishing
income tax, establishing a gold
standard and eliminating the
Federal Reserve.
"Has it ever occured to you
that the Federal Reserve are
actual counterfeiters?" Paul
asked. Instead of allowing the
Federal Reserve to weaken the
dollar, Paul said that the role
of goverment would be to use
standard to guarantee
the tfatjue of money.
"It be no coincidence

that the Libertarian Party came
into existence in 1971, the same
year that the Federal Reserve was
established," he said.
He also stressed .that eliminat
ing federal income tax would not
only limit government's rampant
spending, but more importantly
would guarantee personal
freedom from government med
dling.
"Will government be for the
guarantee of personal freedom or
for redistributing wealth?" he
asked.
Paul pointed out that during
his time as a Congressman he
consistently voted against waste
ful or deficit goverment spending,
even when the spending would
benefit his district.
Although Paul's speech focused
largely on economic issues, he did
reserve part of his talk to spread
the Libertarians' better-known
position on personal liberties.
"There are always those of us
who want to be left alone," he
said. "The government should
have a tremendous amount of
tolerance. People should be able
to read what they want, drink
what they want, smoke what they
want."

Paul said the Libertarian ideal
would allow people to be their
own protectors, and it would be
the role of government only to
protect people from others.
Paul advocated pulling U.S.
troops out of countries where the
United States is trying to regulate
other governments and getting its
own soldiers killed.
He said his original strong sup
port for the Reagan ad
ministration's Strategic Defense
Initiative has waned, but he added
that he is still in favor of the plan
as a defensive weapon.
Although Paul admitted he
probably will not be elected pres
ident, he said he hopes the
country will soon discover Liber
tarianism. "A lot of it hinges on
whether or not I get in the
debates."
According to Paul, the Demo
crats would like him to participate
in the national debates after the
major party primaries because as
an ex-Republican he has scathing
things to say about the Reagan
years and the Republican party.
"It's just like the Republicans
wanted (independent presidential
candidate) John Anderson in the
debates in 1980," he said.
Right now Paul is on the ballot
in only 25 states, but he said he
anticipates the Libertarian ticket
will be on all 50 states ballots by
November.
