Ron Paul brought his fiery con
demnation of big government
to a crowd of almost 200 in
Cubberley Auditorium last
night.
Speaking at Stanford as part
of a week-long college tour that
has included MIT, the Univer
sity of Virginia, William &
Mary and UC-Berkeley, Paul
stressed that he shares the Lib
ertarian Party's commitment
to protection of personal

the need for a smaller, less
wasteful goverment.
"A leadership has developed

that requires innovation in
thinking up programs to waste

four-term Republican con

Texas. In a speech that focused
largely on economic problems,
Paul advocated several
reforms, including abolishing
income tax, establishing a gold
standard and eliminating the
Federal Reserve.
"Has it ever occured to you
that the Federal Reserve are
actual counterfeiters?" Paul
asked. Instead of allowing the
Federal Reserve to weaken the
dollar, Paul said that the role

standard to guarantee
the tfatjue of money.
