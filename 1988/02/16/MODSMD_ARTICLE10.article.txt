A protest against racial violence and discrim
ination at the University of Massachusetts-
Amherst is entering its fifth day today as an
estimated 200 black students continue to occupy
a university building in defiance of school ad
ministrators.
Friday, the students took over the university's
New Africa House — a classroom and cultural
center run by the humanities department — and
say they will refuse to budge until the adminis
tration meets a list of demands.
There has been no police intervention in the
protest.
The protest was sparked by two recent racial
incidents. On Feb. 5, two black students and a
white girlfriend of one of the students claimed
they were victims of racially motivated assault
and battery by six white students.
In an interview with The Daily last night, one
of the protesters, Theress Jones, accused the
police of releasing the alleged attackers for one

day, thereby allowing the white students time to
regroup and "fix their story."
The six face disciplinary hearings before a uni
versity committee and possible expulsion, but
protesters are demanding that the students be
expelled immediately.
In a second incident Feb. 7, Amherst police
are said to have gone through a student dormitory
to randomly select seven black males for a lineup,
following a complaint by a white student that
she had been sexually harassed in the dormitory
by a black man.
According to Jones, "Those involved in the
lineup were not read their rights."
The demands presented to University Chan
cellor Joseph Dulley include expulsion of the
white students accused of the beating, adoption
of a general civility statute that would prescribe
the manner of dealing with racial offenders, and
the keys to New Africa House.
According to Jones, the original purpose of the
house has been undermined by the University.
Instruction today in some regularly scheduled
classes wall be obstructed because of the sit-in.
