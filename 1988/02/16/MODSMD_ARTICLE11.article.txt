# CIA threatens democracy
## Former agent urges opposition to covert activities 
### Jinny Huang 
The CIA is the ultimate threat
to democracy and a major cause
of the world's movement toward
nuclear extinction, a former CIA
agent told a convention of pro
gressive students Saturday at a
packed Cubberley Auditorium.
John Stockwell, former CIA sta
tion chief in Africa and Vietnam,
commander of the covert war in
Angola and adviser to the Na
tional Security Council under
Henry Kissinger, addressed the
second annual conference of the
California Alliance of Progressive
Student Activists. Since leaving
the CIA in 1977, Stockwell has
been an outspoken critic of the
agency.
Stockwell congratulated the
modern student generation for
the opportunities it has to under
stand its world, and the initiatives
it has taken toward that goal. He
then explained how he reached

his anti-CIA stance.
"Being in something doesn't
mean that you understand it,"
Stockwell said. After the covert
war in Angola, Stockwell claimed
he felt "like an Oliver North" be
cause he realized that the Angola
operation had not adhered to any
moral laws.
Because he sees the Iran-
Contra affair is the pressing issue
of the moment, Stockwell at
tempted to describe the CIA op
erations in Nicaragua based on
his similar experiences in Angola.
Stockwell charged that these
operations aim at destabilizing
Nicaragua's economy by blocking
farmers from getting their
produce into the markets, burning
down granaries and paralyzing
the railroad and other means of
transportation.
Further CIA atrocities, which
Stockwell alleged are characteris
tic of the agency's posture toward
Third World countries, include in

stances of gratuitous rape and
castration in front of Nicaraguan
children.
Stockwell warned the audience
about what he said are the many
ways that the CIA is making the
world less stable. From 1961-
1975, a 14-year period, the CIA
executed 900 mtyor cover opera
tions and several thousand minor
ones, Stockwell said, including as
sassinations of heads of state. In
addition, the CIA used drug deals
with established channels as a
source of its funding.
In conclusion, Stockwell urged
students to oppose the CIA. He
said CIA propaganda has per
meated society to the extent that
it is now a part of the news media.
The New York Times and the
Washington Post, he claimed, are
closely affiliated with the CIA.
Propaganda can even be found
in the libraries of university cam
puses, Stockwell warned,
