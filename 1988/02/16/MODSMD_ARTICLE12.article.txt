VIENNA, Austria â€” Embattled Aus
trian President Kurt Waldheim, in a
nationwide broadcast yesterday, pledged
not to bow to calls for his resignation,
saying, "I have a clean conscience."
Waldheim's address to the nation,
broadcast by Austrian Orf television and
radio, came a week after a panel of
historians investigating Waldheim's role
in the German army in World War II
issued its findings that Waldheim was
not directly involved in Nazi war crimes,
but that he knew about atrocities and
did nothing to stop them.
Waldheim, a former United Nations
secretary-general, accused his critics at
home and abroad of "not shying away
from anything. There were manipula
tions, lies and forgeries against me," he
said without elaboration.
He said that a head of state "must
not bow to slander, malicious demon
strations and blanket condemnation."

Such methods could then also be used
against other democratic institutions,
he said.
Waldheim, who, because of questions
about his Nazi past, has been shunned
by most governments around the world
since his election as president in 1986,
has come under mounting pressure to
resign since the report was issued.
He reiterated his stance that it was
"a fundamental principle of our democ
racy that election results cannot be al
tered later."
His task was to ensure the function
ing of the fabric and institutions of the
Austrian republic, he said, and warned
that his resignation could plunge the
country into "new and much more
serious difficulties."
Waldheim said parts of the report "do
not correspond to the facts, but are
based on assumptions and sup
positions," and its conclusions, there

fore, were not valid.
"I do have great respect for the heroes
and martyrs" who resisted the Nazi dic
tatorship, he said. "But they were, as
always in history, only a few. All the
others of my generation, angst-ridden
and trying to survive, got drowned in
the war machinery."
Waldheim appealed to his fellow
countrymen not to undermine the self
respect and the self-confidence of the
state and added, "The faith in our Fa
therland is at stake."
Earlier yesterday, a close Waldheim
aide and former Austrian foreign min
ister, Karl Gruber, reiterated his con
troversial remarks that the panel was
biased.
Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky
officially apologized "on behalf of the
republic" to the panel for Gruber's
remarks.
