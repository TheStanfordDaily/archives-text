## 
### 
MANCHESTER, N.H. - Vice
President Bush and Senate Mi
nority Leader Robert Dole, R-
Kan., made their final campaign
appeals yesterday before a critical
showdown that is likely to shape
the tone and content of the Re
publican presidential contest from
now until the GOP national con
vention in New Orleans in Au
gust.
On the eve of today's New
Hampshire primary, public opin
ion polls and the assessments of
campaign professionals had the
race a virtual dead heat. In seven
days of campaigning since Dole
won the lowa caucuses and Bush
finished third behind former tele

vision evangelist Pat Robertson,
the vice president's once
substantial lead here has van
ished, putting Dole within grasp
— but not certainty — of victory.
Tracking polls by The Washing
ton Post and ABC News of 402
likely Republican primary voters
Sunday gave Dole 33 percent of
the electorate and Bush 32 per
cent, a statistically insignificant
difference.
The same survey showed Rep.
Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., the choice of
14 percent of likely primary voters
and Robertson tied with former
Delaware Gov. Pierre "Pete" du
Pont IV at 8 percent.
