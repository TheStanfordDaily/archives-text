# Dukakis holds big lead

MANCHESTER, N.H. - The seven
Democratic presidential contenders
wound up their campaigning for today's
New Hampshire primary last night, with
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, D-
Mass., anticipating a big victory and
several of the others wondering if this
is the end of their 1988 road.
Sunday night phone interviews with
402 likely voters by The Washington
Post and ABC News continued to show
an extremely tight race for second place
between Rep. Richard Gephardt of Mis
souri, the winner of last week's lowa
caucuses, and Sen. Paul Simon of Illi
nois, who finished a step behind there.
The survey numbers gave Dukakis 41
percent, Simon 16, Gephardt 15, Jesse
Jackson 8, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Ten

nessee 7, former Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt 6 and former Colorado Sen.
Gary Hart 5, with 2 percent undecided.
As he made a last sweep through the
state, Dukakis warned his supporters
against overconfidence. "In the closing
days of the campaign," he said in
Claremont, "things always tighten up.
I'm sure they will in this one."
But there was no visible chink in
Dukakis' armor. After 10 years as gover
nor, he is a familiar figure in the four
of every five New Hampshire homes that
receive Boston television. And his lead
ership in the fight to block a start-up
of the Seabrook nuclear power plant has
made him a hero for many liberals and
environmentalists in this state.
