# Shamir reportedly rejects Reagan peace plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir has sent an
envoy here to tell Secretary of State
George Shultz that President Reagan's
"territory for peace" principle cannot
serve as the basis for Israel's entering
new peace negotiations on the fate of
the strife-torn occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
The envoy, Ehud Olmert, a member
of Shamir's Likud coalition in the
Knesset, met Sunday with Shultz's ex
ecutive assistant, Charles Hill, to dis
cuss the proposed new American ap
proach to the Middle East peace proc
ess.
The approach envisages initial Arab-
Israeli talks on limited autonomy for
the occupied territories and then ne

gotiations on their final status, start
ing within six months, based on the
"territory for peace" principle con
tained in President Reagan's Septem
ber 1982 speech on the Middle East.
Radio Israel reported that Olmert
told Hill that Shamir would "never"
agree to negotiate a final settlement
for the territories on the basis of this
formula and warned that if Shultz con
tinues with this approach, the new
American peace initiative is doomed
to failure.
Shultz recently told visitors to the
State Department that all parties must
clearly understand that the new U.S.
peace initiative will go forward only
on the basis of the "territory for peace"
formula and U.N. Resolution 242

guaranteeing peace and security for
all Middle Eastern nations.
An Israeli Embassy spokesman con
firmed that Olmert met Hill Sunday
"for a discussion of the American in
itiative." He described it as "an im
partant meeting," but said it was "not
ftfound-breaking."
The spokesman, Yossi Gal, said Ol
mert had been in Palm Beach, Fla.,
for a meeting of the B'nai B'rith Anti-
Defamation League, where Shultz was
the guest speaker Friday. Olmert re
portedly met Shultz briefly there but,
because he did not have time to discuss
the new American initiative, Olmert
came here Sunday to see Hill.
Yesterday Shamir, leaving Israel for
a visit to Italy, publicly stated his op

position to any negotiations based on
the "territories for peace" formula. A
State Department official said there
would be no comment on Shamir's
statements or the visit of his latest
envoy.
More than 50 Palestinians have been
killed and thousands arrested by Is
raeli authorities in the territories in
the past two months. The violence has
spurred the Reagan administration
after months of diplomatic inactivity
to search for ways to revive the long
stalled peace process.
Shamir appears to be hardening his
position on the issue of peace talks in
preparation for Shultz's visit to the
region starting Feb. 24.
