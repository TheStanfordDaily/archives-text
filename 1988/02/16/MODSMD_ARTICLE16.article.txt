Israeli army arrests 2 soldiers
SALIM, Israeli-occupied West Bank — The
Israeli army yesterday announced the arrest
of two soldiers, one of them a master sergeant,
for allegedly burying alive four young Pales
tinians with a military bulldozer in this West
Bank village 10 days ago, and a military
spokesman said more arrests were likely.
Witnesses said that after the bulldozer
dumped a full load of earth on the four while
they lay, as ordered, face down in a muddy
road — and a Jewish settler shouted "Weil
done" to the soldiers — the sergeant ordered
the driver to run over them, but he refused.
The soldiers left about 15 minutes later,
and residents pulled the four men, uncon
scious, from under a 30-inch-high mound of
dirt. All survived, according to residents, al
though two remain bed-ridden with injuries.
The other two have recovered completely.
Timetable reached on trade bill
BAL HARBOUR, Fla. — House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Tex., said yesterday that he has

settle their portion of the legislation no later
than March 23.
He said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., and Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Tex., also have
agreed to the timetable.

work out the differences between them.
