## Rape study weak 
### 
WHILE INCREASED dis
cussion of date rape has
had the positive effect of
heightening awareness, much of
the essence of the problem has be
come lost due to the focus that
has been placed on fraternities. Al
though many who deal with college
rape victims agree that a large
number of incidents do occur in
fraternities, the source of the prob
lem itself is hardly exclusive to
fraternities.
Despite the low number of
sexual assaults reported by the
police each year, it is estimated
that only one in 10 actual incidents
is reported. This is based on com
paring the official records with the
tallies kept by organizations that
operate rape hot-line numbers.
Other studies indicate that one in
three women will be sexually as
saulted before reaching 18 years
of age. Clearly, then, the problem
is a widespread one, particularly
for students here.
And although many agree that
a large number of incidents do oc
cur in fraternities, these institu
tions themselves are making ef
forts to remedy the problem. The
Interfraternity Council has initi
ated a variety of programs this
year that deal with attitudes on
sexuality and how alcohol exacer
bates the problem.
Commendable efforts have also
been made by students and the
University to support victims of
sexual assault. The Rape Educa
tion Project is a student-run group
that sponsors several programs to
educate students on the problem
of rape, and Cowell provides coun
seling for students through the
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS).
Residential Education has also
addressed the problem by estab
lishing the Crisis Response Group,

10 University representatives that
are referred to assault victims by
the police or medical authorities.
Resident assistants are also specif
ically trained to deal with the prob
lem before assuming an RA role.
And the Women's Center
recently distributed flyers solicit
ing students to write of any expe
riences of sexual harassment by
professors or TAs to research the
extent of harassment on campus.
But no formal surveys or studies
have been done to actually deter
mine the extent of the problem. A
health survey done by Cowell last
year barely approached the topic
in one question dealing with the
general problem of sexual abuse in
a lifetime, but no statistics are
available regarding the scope of the
problem on campus.
While the Women's Center sur
vey should be applauded, it is im
portant to recognize that it is
strictly a voluntary, unscientific
approach to a problem that war
rants more serious attention on
the part of the University.
It is evident, then, that despite
the earnest efforts of both students
and administration alike, there is
a great need for further research
and examination of the problem.
Ted des Maisons of the Rape Ed
ucation project hinted at the pos
sibility of such a survey later this
year. The University should have
assumed the responsibility for this
first study, and it is unfortunate
that such a basic step must be
initiated by the students them
selves. The step needs to be sup
ported and encouraged by the ad
ministration. Until the elementary
questions of how extensive the
problem is and exactly in what sit
uations it occurs are answered, the
Stanford community will be lim
ited in its effectiveness in dealing
with the problem.
