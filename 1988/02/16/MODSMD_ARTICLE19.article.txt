## All students deserve equal chance to go overseas 
### 
THE FEB. 8 ARTICLE concerning
early admission to the Overseas
Studies Program in Florence
perpetuates the myths that lead to the
Structured Liberal Education track's
social and educational segregation from
students in other Western Culture
tracks.
The story reports that "only SLE
students have been offered a special
application deadline allowing them to
be considered for the program earlier
than other students." Italian and
Comparative Literature Prof, and SLE
lecturer John Freccero, the program
or'ganizer, rationalizes his bias toward
SLE through the preferential deadline
by generalizing SLE students as "the
most distinct group of people who have

taken the Western Civilization canon
seriously."
Who is Freccero to judge the resolu
tion and diligence in study of 1,400
students about whom he knows noth
ing? Those students take their studies
just as seriously as the SLE students
and deserve the respect due to any
Stanford student regardless of which
track they checked in June.
Some applicants to SLE who were
not selected and varsity athletes with
conflicting practice schedules have
similar interests, but are prejudicially
regarded by Freccero as taking the
Western Culture canon less seriously.
Any program, such as this early
admission, that expedites or simplifies

participation in Overseas Study experi
ences for Stanford students, is wel
come. If this is "a marvelous opportu
nity to continue Western Culture
(study) in Florence," as Freccero
claims, why is it not "a marvelous
opportunity" for non-SLE students as
well?
Unnecessary discrimination like this
leads to a segregation of SLE from
other freshmen and myths of SLE
students as being different. Elitism,
such as that created by labeling one
group more prepared than another,
just contributes to the division. What
makes SLE students any more
prepared for the Overseas Studies
Program in Florence than any other
student of Western Culture (which

does include Florence) who has fulfilled
the language requirement?
Freccero said he would be "delighted
to have other students, but I don't
know how to go about doing it
(recruiting them)," and said he has
targeted SLE ahead of other tracks
because they are the most accessible to
him. SLE students happen to be more
convenient and require less effort for
Freccero. Who more than the program
organizer is responsible for making the
effort to contact possible participants?
Personal biases, egos and indolence
should become secondary to the
recruitment of the most qualified
applicants for the program.
