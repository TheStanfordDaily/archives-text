# Teller accused of SDI deception campaign

Editor's note: This is the first of
a two-part story based on inter
views by The Daily with top sci
entists involved in SDI research.

Edward Teller, father of the hy
drogen bomb and a strong
proponent of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, deliberately
misled the Reagan administration
about SDl's feasibility, according
to scientists closely associated
with the project.
Ray Kidder, a senior physicist
at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, said last week that
Teller — a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution — ig
nored unfavorable scientific
reports on SDI weapons research
when he encouraged high-ranking
government officials to increase
funding of the "Star Wars" project
in 1984.

Kidder said Teller
gave top Reagan
administration
information
about an SDl
related X-ray
laser that was
"misleading and
unjustifiably
optimistic."
Teller, a co
rtn a i r

founder of the Livermore labora
tory, is still a consultant there.
According to Jim Kane, the Uni
versity of California's liason to
the research center, Teller spends
about one day a week there.
"He never quits; he does a lot
of thinking about physics and
defense," Kane said, noting that
Teller no longer conducts labora
tory reseach at the facility.
Teller was unavailable for com
ment last week.
Hugh Dewitt, another Liver
more physicist, said Teller's opti
mistic predictions strengthened

the Reagan administration's com
mitment to SDI.
"The X-ray laser was one of the
primary things that convinced the
Reagan administration to go
ahead with Star Wars," Dewitt
said.
Roy Woodruff, former head of
nuclear weapons research at
Livermore, said he knew in 1982
that Teller was exaggerating the
controversial system's feasibility.
Woodruff resigned from his posi
tion at Livermore in 1985 because
he felt Teller and his protege,
Lowell Wood, misrepresented the
results of his research with X-ray
lasers.
Woodruff further claimed that
because of Teller's overly optimis
tic predictions, unreasonable ex
pectations developed concerning
the results of his research.
Without Woodruffs approval,
Teller and Wood — neither of
whom were directly or closely re
sponsible for the research —
paraded the laser case before
several high-level policy makers,
misleading them in their decisions
on Star Wars policy and budget
ing, according to Woodruff and
Kidder.
Woodruff wrote numerous
private letters faulting Teller's
description of the laser to mem
bers of the nation's scientific and
academic communities. But his
concerns only became public this
fall, when a letter written to the
president of the University of Cal
ifornia was accidentally leaked to
the Southern California Federa
tion of Scientists.
The new information led Rep.
George Brown, D-Calif., along
with other members of Congress,
to initiate an investigation into
the controversy. The investigation
will be completed this month.
Last month Kidder sent a letter
to Brown supporting Woodruffs
allegations. According to Kidder,
the central issue in the contro

versy is "the integrity of the
Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in terms of its report
ing and responsibility to the
country."
Kane and Kidder agreed that
Teller, a long-time friend of
Reagan, has "enormous clout"
among policy-makers.
Since the early 1980s, according
to Kidder, Teller has "had
Reagan's ear and confidence,"
which put him in an "exception
ally powerful position to increase
the amount of funding for pro
grams he happened to like."
Kidder added that with this
"enormous amount of influence"
Teller had a "corresponding re
sponsibility to give balanced and
weighed advice."
The present controversy over
the "nuclear-boosted" X-ray laser
dates from February 1981, when
the results of a partially success
ful underground test of the X-ray
laser in November 1980 were pur
posely leaked to Aviation Week
and Space Technology magazine.
According to Dewitt, leakage of
classified information is not un
usual and is used to reveal secret
information that might, if made
public, encourage more congres
sional funding. If the information
had not been divulged, it would
have remained highly classified,
accessible only to high govern
ment officials and scientists.
On the basis of the X-ray laser
developments, Teller met with
Reagan in September 1982 to dis
cuss recent findings, according to
Brown's press representative on
scientific issues, Josie Stein.
Stein said since then Teller and
Wood have allegedly been offering
overly optimistic counsel to high
level officials to solicit funding for
the X-ray laser and other SDI
weaponry.
In December 1983, Teller re-
