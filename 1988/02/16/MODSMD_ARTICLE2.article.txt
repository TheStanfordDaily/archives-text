# Teller accused of SDI deception campaign
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first of
a two-part story based on inter
views by The Daily with top sci
entists involved in SDI research.

Edward Teller, father of the hy
drogen bomb and a strong
proponent of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, deliberately
misled the Reagan administration
about SDl's feasibility, according
to scientists closely associated
with the project.
Ray Kidder, a senior physicist
at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, said last week that
Teller — a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution — ig
nored unfavorable scientific
reports on SDI weapons research
when he encouraged high-ranking
government officials to increase
funding of the "Star Wars" project
in 1984.

Kidder said Teller
gave top Reagan
administration
information
about an SDl
related X-ray
laser that was
"misleading and
unjustifiably
optimistic."
Teller, a co
rtn a i r

founder of the Livermore labora
tory, is still a consultant there.
According to Jim Kane, the Uni
versity of California's liason to
the research center, Teller spends
about one day a week there.
"He never quits; he does a lot
of thinking about physics and
defense," Kane said, noting that
Teller no longer conducts labora
tory reseach at the facility.
Teller was unavailable for com
ment last week.
Hugh Dewitt, another Liver
more physicist, said Teller's opti
mistic predictions strengthened

the Reagan administration's com
mitment to SDI.
"The X-ray laser was one of the
primary things that convinced the
Reagan administration to go
ahead with Star Wars," Dewitt
said.
Roy Woodruff, former head of
nuclear weapons research at
Livermore, said he knew in 1982
that Teller was exaggerating the
controversial system's feasibility.
Woodruff resigned from his posi
tion at Livermore in 1985 because
he felt Teller and his protege,
Lowell Wood, misrepresented the
results of his research with X-ray
lasers.
Woodruff further claimed that
because of Teller's overly optimis
tic predictions, unreasonable ex
pectations developed concerning
the results of his research.
Without Woodruffs approval,
Teller and Wood — neither of
whom were directly or closely re
sponsible for the research —
paraded the laser case before
several high-level policy makers,
misleading them in their decisions
on Star Wars policy and budget
ing, according to Woodruff and
Kidder.
Woodruff wrote numerous
private letters faulting Teller's
description of the laser to mem
bers of the nation's scientific and
academic communities. But his
concerns only became public this
fall, when a letter written to the
president of the University of Cal
ifornia was accidentally leaked to
the Southern California Federa
tion of Scientists.
The new information led Rep.
George Brown, D-Calif., along
with other members of Congress,
to initiate an investigation into
the controversy. The investigation
will be completed this month.
Last month Kidder sent a letter
to Brown supporting Woodruffs
allegations. According to Kidder,
the central issue in the contro

versy is "the integrity of the
Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in terms of its report
ing and responsibility to the
country."
Kane and Kidder agreed that
Teller, a long-time friend of
Reagan, has "enormous clout"
among policy-makers.
Since the early 1980s, according
to Kidder, Teller has "had
Reagan's ear and confidence,"
which put him in an "exception
ally powerful position to increase
the amount of funding for pro
grams he happened to like."
Kidder added that with this
"enormous amount of influence"
Teller had a "corresponding re
sponsibility to give balanced and
weighed advice."
The present controversy over
the "nuclear-boosted" X-ray laser
dates from February 1981, when
the results of a partially success
ful underground test of the X-ray
laser in November 1980 were pur
posely leaked to Aviation Week
and Space Technology magazine.
According to Dewitt, leakage of
classified information is not un
usual and is used to reveal secret
information that might, if made
public, encourage more congres
sional funding. If the information
had not been divulged, it would
have remained highly classified,
accessible only to high govern
ment officials and scientists.
On the basis of the X-ray laser
developments, Teller met with
Reagan in September 1982 to dis
cuss recent findings, according to
Brown's press representative on
scientific issues, Josie Stein.
Stein said since then Teller and
Wood have allegedly been offering
overly optimistic counsel to high
level officials to solicit funding for
the X-ray laser and other SDI
weaponry.
In December 1983, Teller re-


Teller
quested such funding in a letter
to former White House Science
Adviser George Keyworth, claim
ing that the X-ray laser wjas en
tering the "engineering pnase"
and was ready for development
as a weapon capable of shooting
down a fleet of attacking Soviet
missiles.
Yet, Kidder argued the term
"engineering phase" implies "that
the scientific unknowns have been
resolved and the technology (is
ready to be) made into an oper
ating device." In fact, many sci
entists agree the X-ray laser is
not ready for development, but
remains in the research stage.
However, when Woodruff tried
to correct the false information
circulating about the laser, Roger
Batzel, director of the Livermore
lab, forbade him to send a letter
of rebuttal to Keyworth, which
was "carefully written and
respectful of Teller," Dewitt said.
The letter stated that work on
the X-ray laser program was "re

search, not development," and it
was not yet near the "engineering
phase."
Kidder said last week that "if
anyone had asked me if the laser
was in the 'engineering phase' at
that point, after I stopped laugh
ing I would have said 'no.' "
Kidder said it will take several
more years before it is even
known if there is potential for
military applications of the laser.
In 1983, Teller asked Kidder to
analyze the possible uses of an
X-ray laser for a nuclear defense.
In February 1984 Kidder wrote a
13-page memo concluding that
the projected minimum perform
ance of the X-ray laser would "be
very difficult to achieve."
"Basic questions of physics
remained to be answered before
one could be confident that the
X-ray laser would have any utility
at all," Kidder wrote.
Woodruff and Kidder both
claimed Teller and Wood ignored
Kidder's analysis and in Decem
ber 1984 continued to send mis
leading letters about the laser's
future to Paul Nitze, one of
Reagan's top arms negotiators,
and Robert McFarlane, then head

of the National Security Council.
In his letter to Brown, Kidder
wrote: "I regarded their state
ments (in the letters of December
1984) concerning the status and
prospects of the X-ray laser as
misleading and unjustifiably opti
mistic. I was particularly unhappy
because I knew they knew better."
Kidder argued that "the lab
gave Teller and Wood a special
position to represent the position
of the lab while Woodruff had the
real responsibility."
Dewitt said that by not allowing
Woodruff to correct the misin
formation, Batzel allowed Teller
to speak for the lab, although he
was not an employee or an au
thority on the laser.
While officials from Livermore
and the University of California
contend that Woodruff made fre
quent trips to Washington to pres
ent his point of view, Woodruff
argues that he did not have access
to the officials powerful enough
to affect mqjor policy change.
However, George Chapline, an
other Livermore physicist, said
Woodruff was "no less enthusias
tic and optimistic" about the fu
ture of the laser than Teller or

Wood when Woodruff briefed the
White House Science Council in
February 1983.
While Dewitt admitted that
Woodruff was initially optimistic
about the X-ray laser's potential,
he said Woodruff later became
cautious and suspicious of Teller's
and Wood's claims when they
began to go beyond optimism.
"When their promises became
specific, and he realized, as head
of the program, he could not make
these things," Woodruff retreated
from his earlier optimism, Dewitt
said.
Woodruff's continued dis
couragement with his inability to
effectively present his case led
him to resign his post in 1985.
In July 1987, he wrote to the
head of the Scientific and Aca
demic Advisory Committee that
he "resigned from a position that
was the most satisfying of my pro
fessional career, out of a deep con
cern for my country and the
damage to national security that
I believe was — and is — occuring
from the misrepresentation of the
laboratory's X-ray laser and other
SDI-related research to the high
est policy-makers of our country."
