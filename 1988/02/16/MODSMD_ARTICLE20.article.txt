# ASSU doing its job

### 
Council of Presidents member Jim
Durkin's Feb. 11 explanation of the
reasons for the COP's veto of the
ASSU senate's recommendations on
special fee assessments is an excep
tional piece of political obfuscation and
has only a remotely tenuous connec
tion with reality.
In making its final recommendations,
the senate did not principally rely
upon the recommendations of the
Appropriations Committee as Durkin
charges. Many of us put more reliance
upon the voluminous packet of infor
mation we received detailing the or
ganizations' budgets and the or
ganizations' own reasons for requesting
these funds from the students of Stan
ford via a special fee, as well as relying
on our own experiences with many of
these organizations.
It should also be noted that the
senate did not return an unfavorable
recommendation where the committee
had suggested a positive recommenda

tion, and that the senate voted to
change several organizations' recom
mendations from a neutral or a nega
tive recommendation to a positive
recommendation.
The record shows that we debated
the budgets and the recommendations
for over two hours, and for Durkin to
suggest that this was somehow inade
quate attention by the senate borders
on the inexplicable.
Members of the senate can neverthe
less understand why Durkin and his
co-conspirators in the COP have cho
sen to try to damage the finances of
several meritorious student groups by
attacking the senate's recommendation
process. The senate has repeatedly
refused to increase the appropriations
and approve the funding recommenda
tions of organizations closely tied to
the current COP.
Apparently in a fit of pique over
having failed to increase the funding of
organizations of dubious value but
close to the members of the COP, the
COP has chosen to mount an attack
on all other campus organizations in

the guise of attacking the senate. It
may be an excellent political tactic to
try and extort support from these
other political organizations through
the use of the COP's veto power, but
it is a tactic which is not in the best
interests of the ASSU or the Stanford
student body.
I would hope that the COP shows
some signs of maturity by withdrawing
this veto before a special meeting of
the senate becomes necessary.
