Keith Nashnwaty'a political opinion
of Pat Robertson in his Feb. 10
column was incompetently based on
superficial media scope and therefore
was deprived of any logical fluidity.
Nashawaty attempted to satirize
Robertson's political and religious
beliefs in a cutesy manner, but unfor-

tunately, he failed. Robertson's surpris
ing second-place triumph in lowa
proves that a Christian ex-broadcaster
can be a good moral leader, despite the
nauseous criticism of biblically ignorant
secular humanists.
Robertson's "uncanny knack for
de-emphasizing his religious tenets and
teachings on the campaign trail," the
columnist claimed, "is frightening at
best." This could only mean that
Robertson is sensitive about other
people's beliefs and needs apart from
his own.
Before presenting his views on
Robertson, Nashawaty should have
absorbed all of the New Testament,
watched two weeks of the 700 Club
and made friends with practicing
Christians. He suggested that readers
should be frightened by "a hidden
army of Robertson supporters." The
only person who is scared of virtue
and re-establishing the moral fiber of
this country is, obviously, the real nut.
