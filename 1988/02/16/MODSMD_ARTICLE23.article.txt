## NOW agenda too big 
### 
ELENORE SMEAL, the former
president of the National Organi
zation for Women, was on campus
last week. I'll admit up front that I didn't
go see her. I've heard her speak before
and found her views and the tone of her
delivery too militant to relate to. The
article in The Daily the next day con
firmed my suspicions that Smeal hadn't
mellowed out.
In an hour of spleen-letting, she bit
terly protested the thwarting of the
feminist agenda — which she defines as
including peace and disarmament, lesbian
and gay rights and the elimination of
poverty. Smeal got a standing ovation,
but I wasn't suprised when numerous
people mentioned feeling turned-off, even
antagonistic, to Smeal and her causes.
As one female dormmate said to me,
"How can she assume all females support
her causes, and would she support a
woman (who was running for office) who
didn't?"
NOW was founded by Betty Friedan
in 1966, the heyday of the women's move
ment, to be the first organization to deal
specifically with the furthering of
women's issues through the political
arena. As Dorothy Wickenden, the
managing editor of The New Republic,
commented in a 1986 article on the or
ganization, "NOW's intention never was
to subvert male bastions of power, but
to work through the legislature,
Congress, courts and grass-roots organ
izations to enable women to work
alongside men in education, employment
and politics."

Working toward this original goal of
equal opportunites for women, NOW has
been very effective. Thanks to it, and the
variety of women's organizations it in
spired, new laws and the courts ade
quately protect women's equal access to
the job market. We also have much more
reproductive freedom under the law than
ever before.
But, ironically, partly because of these
successes NOW is floundering. The Equal
Rights Amendment, until its defeat, was
the main issue around which NOW was
able to rally supporters. Today, despite
arguments by Smeal to the contrary, the
fight for the amendment cannot be
revived, essentially because many of
ERA's original supporters don't think
equal rights for women is an issue but
a fact.
When NOW became unable to generate
widespread enthusiasm for the equality
issue, the organization compensated by
embracing a range of left-wing humanist
issues — most notably defending of gay
and lesbian rights. While this strategy
has served to give NOW the high media
profile it desired, the cost in membership
has been dear — in 1986 NOW had
250,00 members but today claims only
150,000.
It's time NOW narrowed the list of
causes it supports. With limited resources
and political clout it can't afford to play
a role in all the issues it does now, and
it can't afford to be losing members. It's
not that these left-wing humanist issues
aren't worthwhile (in my opinion they
are), but let's separate the apples from
the oranges so that women who want to

join the movement don't feel their mem
bership in NOW is an implicit acceptance
of an unrelated agenda. Where NOW's
interests coincide with those of others,
like opposing the nomination of a Su
preme Court Justice, it can form al
liances.
In the meantime, NOW has got to give
up its focus on equal rights and start a
full-fledged push for social feminist is
sues. Adopting social feminism means ad
mitting women aren't equal to men but
are different with different needs. Men,
after all, can never be made to equally
share the biological disadvantages of
having children (When I say children are
a disadvantage I mean it in the job sense
only). Yet most women want children
and need jobs to support their families.
Wickenden concludes her article by ur
ging NOW to "use its political power to
launch a major offensive for a series of
concrete social reforms and changes in
the workplace — beginning with afford
able, widely available, licensed day-care."
In my opinion, this is definitely what
NOW should be concentrating on. And
if the organization narrows its focus to
these issues, it can get things done. It
will win more members and again become
a valid voice for the constituency it
claims.
