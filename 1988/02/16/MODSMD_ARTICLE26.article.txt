## Peace Corps partial to Stanford students 
### Ted Lieu Staff writer 
Imagine yourself in an exotic faraway
land, where the people, norms and habits
are drastically different from your own.
Imagine the sun beating down your neck
as you try to explain, in Sinhalese, what
the English word "hamburger" means to
a person in Sri Lanka. For several Stan
ford students, the Peace Corps turns
these images into reality.
The opportunities to enter the Peace
Corps have never been better, according
to Peace Corps Public Affairs Manager
Suzanne Cowan.
"Last June, Congress approved a Peace
Corps budget increase" that will "double"
the number of volunteers "from 5,000 to
10,000 by the year 1993," Cowan said.
Moreover, the Peace Corps tends to
accept a high percentage of Stanford stu
dents.
"Stanford students are highly quali
fied. We place almost everybody who ap
plies," according to Libby Blackwell,
recruitment specialist for the Peace
Corps.
"It has been my experience that Stan
ford students who stick with the appli
cation process very often make [the final
cuts]," Cowan added.
In 1987, for example, out of 36 Stan
ford applicants, 20 were nominated and
13 were placed with the Peace Corps.
Why are students at Stanford regarded
highly by the Peace Corps?
According to Cowan, "Stanford
strongly encourages volunteer activity,
and the students seem to have a certain
openness about them."
The qualities the Peace Corps looks
for — education, experience, a commit

to work in places of poverty and depriva

tion — are often found in Stanford stu
dents, she said.
Despite the past success of Peace Corp
recruiting on campus, there has been a
"decided decline" in the number of Stan
ford applicants in the last few years,
Blackwell said.
"There seems to be a general lessening
of interest on campus, and some students
opt for other overseas programs such as
Volunteers in Asia, a Stanford-based
program," Blackwell said.
Because the application process takes
from five to nine months, Blackwell
pointed out that students have time to
change their minds about joining the
group. "Changes happen; some decide to
go on to graduate school, others find a
job," she said.
But people who enter the Peace Corps
often regard it as "one of the most im
pactful and significant experiences in
their lives," she said.
"The Peace Corps is a very significant
career step, especially for those interested
in the international arena," Blackwell
added.
She pointed out that often the first
question an overseas employer asks is
whether students have overseas experi
ence. When students are not experienced,
many employers "recommend that you
join the Peace Corps first and then come

back and apply," she explained.
Furthermore, both American and over
seas employers often "request returned
Peace Corps volunteers," Blackwell said.
In a 1987 study conducted by the Psy
chology Department at Mercy College in
New York, former volunteers reported
salary gains in government, health serv
ices and teaching that exceeded those of
workers who had not served in the Peace
Corps.
Cathy Altrocchi, who is currently
pursuing a teaching career through the
Stanford Teacher Education Program,
was a Peace Corps volunteer in Sri Lanka
from 1984 to 1986. Altrocchi said the
Peace Corps offered a mixture of negative
and positive experiences for her.
"The Peace Corps was a strengthening
and enriching experience, and teaching
the highly motivated people was a
pleasure," Altrocchi said.
However, Altrocchi said that because
she was a foreigner she felt like "a magnet
that attracted both good and bad situa
tions."
"Pickpockets would automatically
come to me just because I was of a dif
ferent color," she said.
Acccording to Altrocchi, the civil war
in Sri Lanka made life very difficult for
her. The war provoked a lot of "hatred"

between the people involved. There was
a "nasty undercurrent present," she said.
Freshman Andrea Crane, who said she
is undaunted by the potential hazards
associated with the Peace Corps, plans
to enter the ranks after her senior year.
According to Crane, the Peace Corps
represents "a great opportunity to do
volunteer work while submerged in a
foreign culture."
"There is a sense of adventure in the
undertaking of such a challenging en
terprise," she added.

While some people contend that vol
unteer work should start at home, Crane
noted, there "should not be a line drawn"
that separates one person in need from
another.
"The person who comes back from the
Peace Corps applies the skills and knowl
edge that they have gained into their
community at home," she explained.
Looking back on her own experience
in Sri Lanka, Altrocchi said, "I wouldn't
recommend the Peace Corps for everyone,
but I would do it again."
