# Card baseball has trouble in paradise
## 
### Robert Portnoy Editorial staff 
If you were
waiting to hear
about the resur
gence of the
Stanford bats
last weekend in
Hawaii, you'll

have to wait longer. If you are
confident that the Cardinal will
come around at the plate and
are more concerned over the
void created by departed pitch
ing ace Jack McDowell, then
the answers are coming fast
and furious in the form of two
freshmen, Mike Mussina and
Stan Spencer.
In a series that saw Stanford
drop to 5-5 on the season by
losing two of three to the Rain
bows (6-1) — 5-4 in 10 innings
on Saturday and 4-3 in 14 in
nings on Sunday — Mussina
and Spencer surrendered just
two runs over a combined total
of 15% innings.
In Stanford's 5-0 victory Fri
day, Mussina, who moved to
2-1 with a 1.96 ERA, notched
his second straight complete
game, throwing a two-hit
shutout at the befuddled Rain
bows. Using mostly fastballs in
the high 80s and low 90s, Mus
sina faced just two batters over
the minimum while fanning
four and walking two. He gave
up a single in the third and
one in the seventh. One Hawaii
runner advanced as far as
second. Mussina was totally
dominant.
"Stan (Spencer) and Mike
(Mussina) have been the bright
spots. Mike threw really well,
but the scary thing is I still
don't think we've seen his best
stuff," said Stanford catcher
Doug Robbins, whose solo
homer Friday was his first of
the season.
Spencer was impressive in
his own right, giving up just
two runs and seven hits over
6% innings of work in Sun
day's four-hour and 20-minute
marathon.
"We got some great perform
ances from the freshmen. If the
freshmen keep pitching like
that, we'll win a lot of series."

said pitcher Lee Plemel, the
starter in Saturday's loss. "It
was a shame that Stan didn't
get a win because that was the
best he has pitched all year."
"Stan has a great attitude
out there. He likes to bear
down and do what he has to
do to win — he's a great com
petitor," Robbins added, com
paring Spencer's attitude to
that of McDowell.
Plemel, a senior, humbly
stated he was probably the
worst of the three pitchers last
weekend, but Stanford's No. 1
starter may have been a winner
himself on Saturday were it not
for two gaffs which led to
Hawaii runs.
In the Hawaii first, a two-out
throwing error by Cardinal
shortstop Troy Paulsen, a
sophomore, allowed Ross
Kagawa to score on a ground
ball by Larry Gonzales, and in
the bottom of the third, Plemel
hurt his own cause with a two
out wild pitch that again scored
Kagawa. Plemel fanned the
next batter to strike out the
side, but the game was dead
locked at 2-2.
Walks killed the Cardinal at
the end of both losses. In the
10th inning of Saturday's
game, junior Steve Chitren
issued three walks (one of
which was intentional), with
the last forcing in the winning
run. In the bottom of the 14th
Sunday, sophomore Mark Car
per walked four batters, push
ing across the winning run in
the process.
Despite these struggles by
the Stanford pitchers to find
home plate, the real story again
was the dormancy of the Car
dinal bats. Other than Paul
sen's three-for-four, 2-RBI per
formance in Friday's romp, the
Cardinal lacked any stellar of
fensive performances. Though
the tendency is to put aside
Stanford's season-long batting
slump as an aberration, the
lack of run-production is no
longer simply a novelty.
"We're still not getting the
offensive production we an
ticipate will come. It really
breaks your back to lose two
like that," Robbins said.
