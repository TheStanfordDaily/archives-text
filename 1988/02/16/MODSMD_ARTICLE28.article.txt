## Women cagers grab Pac-10 lead Van Derveer gets 200th win 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Three years of
hard work have fi
nally paid off for
Coach Tara Van-
Derveer and the
Stanford women's
basketball team.

Friday night at Maples Pavilion,
the Cardinal knocked Washington
from the top spot in the Pacific
10 Conference with an inspired
70-66 victory, virtually assuring
Stanford its first NCAA tourna
ment berth in six years and put
ting the program's first league
title well within reach.
The win also marked VanDer
veer's 200 th win as a head coach,
spanning the 10 years of her
career.
The No. 12 Huskies fall to 17-3
after this weekend's action, 9-1
in the Pac-10. With Stanford's
defeat of Washington State on
Saturday by a 66-53 margin, the
No. 10 Cardinal boasts an un
precedented 22-1 record overall
and a 10-1 mark in the confer
ence.
The one loss came at the hands
of the Huskies last month in
Seattle, where a 77-60 win before
4,300 vociferous fans launched
Washington into first place in the
Pac-10. For the Cardinal, as for
the school-record 3,254 screaming
spectators, Friday's revenge was
sweet indeed.
"First, I thought the crowd was
great," VanDerveer said. "I think
it inspired our team to play even
harder than they played. I mean,
they were going to play hard
anyway, but people on our team
really appreciated the support of
the students and the community."
At the outset, both teams
seemed tense as well as intense.
Washington took possession at
the tip-off, but an errant pass
floated out of bounds and gave
the ball to Stanford. Junior center
Jill Yanke scored with a sky-hook
to put the Cardinal on the board.
The next three minutes were a
defensive battle riddled with turn
overs, but by the 11-minute mark
the Cardinal had chalked up a
13-10 advantage. Though Stan
ford widened the gap on several
occasions, Washington managed
to rally back until the halftime
buzzer left Stanford with a 26-24

lead.
The second half was far more
pleasant for the faithful on the
Farm, thanks in part to the foul
trouble the Huskies incurred. The
biggest loss was junior guard
Yvette Cole, the main instrument
of Washington's fast break, who
rode the bench for much of the
game and fouled out with 7:24
left in the game after accruing 12
points.
"You don't need to look any
farther than the fact that one of
our best players spent most of
the game on the bench," Wash
ington Coach Chris Gobrecht la
mented. "I mean the entire game.
She might as well have not suited
up."
The Huskies also lost freshman
center Karen Deden and senior
forward Lisa Oriard in the last
30 seconds, squashing any hope
of a last-minute comeback.
Washington's foul trouble, how
ever, did not lose the game for
the Huskies, as sophomore guard
Jackie Myers' game-high total of
18 points was more than Deden
and Oriard's scoring combined.
Rather, some tough playing and
junior guard Emily Wagner se
cured Stanford's success.
The Cardinal inbounded after
halftime, and six minutes later
enjoyed a 38-30 lead. The Huskies
began to close the gap, and with
11:45 remaining were only down
42-38.
Enter Wagner, Stanford's
"sixth man" on Friday. At 10:45,
the junior sank Stanford's only
three-pointer with a stunning
baseline shot, and on the very
next possession drove inside for
a layup.
All told, the junior tallied nine
points, four rebounds, four steals
and three assists, all career highs.
"It was a really good team win,
too," Wagner said. "We have been
working very hard for that, keying
on that game for the past two
weeks, getting ready and playing
tough defense in practice. Every
one was really concentrating on
the effort; no one was an excep
tion from first to last."
Yanke was no exception. The
junior logged a team-high 16
points and 10 rebounds, pouring
on the power in the second half
to keep the Cardinal ahead.


Junior guard Emily Wagner played the best ball of her college
career in Friday night's win over Washington.

The final 10 minutes of the
game saw Stanford maintain at
least a six-point lead over the
Huskies until an inside shot by
Myers narrowed the margin to
four with 1:27 to play. But her
efforts were unable to restrain the
Cardinal juggernaut, and Was
hington's lock on the Pac-10 title
was broken with the game's final
buzzer.
The win over Washington State,
though anticlimactic in light of
Friday's performance, was equally
satisfying for the Cardinal. Com
batting a never-ending string of
junk defenses designed to clog up
Stanford's inside shooters, the
Cardinal bombed away from the
perimeter to post the victory.
In particular, freshman guard
Sonja Henning and junior forward
Kami Anderson were given free
rein by the Cougars to take out
side shots at will. Henning
responded with a game-high and
career-best 27 points, while An
derson contributed 16 in her best
game of the year.
"Last time we played WSU,
Kami shot one-for-seven and
Sonja shot three-for-11, and they
didn't guard those two people
(Saturday)," VanDerveer noted.
"Tonight, Sonja was 12-for-18 and
Kami was 8-for-16. Basically that
was the bottom line — people
came through.
"They left people open and they
took their shots. As far as I'm
concerned, they left the wrong
people open."
Sophomore guard Jennifer Az
zi, who is the team's high scorer
overall but was only allowed one
point by the Cougar defenders
who double-teamed her, was also
surprised by the strategy. "They
keyed in on the high scorers from
the last game, and I don't know
if IWSU Coach Harold Rhodes]
holds a grudge, but Sonja was
open the entire game and she hit.
She's got a great shot, and I'm
clueless as to why they left her
open."
"When we played them there,
they did the exact same thing,
but I didn't shoot very well at
all," Henning explained. "I didn't
shoot very well, so they tried the
same tactic, which was smart
coming down here — but they
stuck with it a little too long."
