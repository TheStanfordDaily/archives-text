# Stanford loses Husky heartbreaker in double OT
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE, Wash. - The Stanford
men's basketball team couldn't quite
find a handle on the broom Saturday
afternoon.
The Cardinal was aiming for its
first road sweep of the Washington
schools since 1960, but in the end

ran out of escapes as the Washington Huskies pulled
out an 84-82 double overtime victory at Hec Ed
monson Pavilion.
The cardiac Cardinal postponed imminent defeat
twice before finally succumbing to the aggressive
Huskies. With no time left on the clock at the end
of regulation and Washington leading 71-70, fresh
man Andrew Vlahov made one of two free throws
to send the game into extra time.
Then at the end of the first overtime, junior
guard Todd Lichti hit a 19-foot jumper from the
corner with two seconds left to tie the game at
77-77 and give Stanford its second life.
Finally, in the second stanza of suspense, Wash
ington's sophomore guard Eldridge Recasner proved
to be too much for the Cardinal. Recasner scored

two buckets and fed backcourt mate Troy Morrel
for the winning score. Stanford failed to get off a
last shot as time ran out.
"It didn't seem to be in the cards for us," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said after the game. "The
kids don't think they prepared as well as they could
have."
Stanford's record dropped to 16-8 overall, 8-5 in
the Pac-10. The Huskies, who had lost four straight
and eight of their last 10, improved to 7-14, 3-9.
For Washington, the victory was especially sweet
after losing to California in overtime on Thursday
night.
"It's incredible the things we had to overcome to
win today," Husky Coach Andy Russo said. "We
were saying to ourselves 'The worst thing that can
happen is that we lose, and we've already done that
before.' "
Recasner was unstoppable nearly all afternoon.
The Huskies executed a deliberate offense that used
up at least 30 seconds almost every possession. And
more often than not the ball ended up in Recasner's
hands. The sophomore would juke, drive or spin
and then float the ball through the hoop.
Recasner scored 28 points, going 11-for-16 from
the field and 4-for-5 from the free throw line.

The Huskies, who led by four with under 40
seconds to go in regulation to California and even
tually lost, almost repeated that performance.
Against Stanford, Washington led 71-68 with 38
seconds left in the second half.
Stanford began its first escape when center Greg
Butler, a senior, came right back with a layup from
a Lichti pass to make it 71-70 with 29 seconds left.
Then the Huskies choked. Center Mark West over
threw Morrell against the Stanford press and Stan
ford had the ball and a chance to win with 15
seconds left.
"It looked to me like he hooked (the pass) and
it faded away," Russo said. "Troy (Morrel) made a
banana cut to get there — he didn't take a direct
route."
After a time out, the ball ended up in Vlahov's
hands. The freshman from Australia couldn't find
an open man so he took a fade-away jumper from
the right corner and was fouled by Husky Jeff
Sanor. The clock read double zeros, and Vlahov was
at the line with a chance to win it.
The Aussie's first shot rattled both sides of the
rim and fell out. He then swished his second attempt
to tie the score.
"That was really a tough one. I've never been in

that situation before," Vlahov said. "The crowd all
descended and a ton of things went through my
mind. After the first one I thought, shit, I better
make this one or things will be bad."
Things started off well for Stanford in the first
OT. Butler had a layup, and after a Washington
turnover, forward junior Howard Wright went to
the line to shoot two free throws.
The momentum turned, however, when he
clanged the first one off the front of the rim and
the second one off the back, and things were now
going badly for Stanford.
Washington took a 76-75 lead on free throws by
West and a 3-pointer by Sanor, but Jenkins made
only one of two free thows with 14 seconds left,
and Stanford had a chance to win or tie.
Lichti's first try almost ended in disaster. He
drove the lane and was tied up by Todd Lautenbach
for a jump ball. Luckily for the Stanford team, the
possession arrow was pointing its way.
Only three seconds remained, but somehow Lichti
got free and took the inbounds pass in the left
corner. He squared to the hoop and let fly a shot
which swished. For a moment the crowd thought
it was a 3-pointer for a Stanford win, but Lichti
was clearly over the line and a second OT ensued.

The Huskies, who led by four with under 40
seconds to go in regulation to California and even
tually lost, almost repeated that performance.
Against Stanford, Washington led 71-68 with 38
seconds left in the second half.
Stanford began its first escape when center Greg
Butler, a senior, came right back with a layup from
a Lichti pass to make it 71-70 with 29 seconds left.
Then the Huskies choked. Center Mark West over
threw Morrell against the Stanford press and Stan
ford had the ball and a chance to win with 15
seconds left.
"It looked to me like he hooked (the pass) and
it faded away," Russo said. "Troy (Morrel) made a
banana cut to get there — he didn't take a direct
route."
After a time out, the ball ended up in Vlahov's
hands. The freshman from Australia couldn't find
an open man so he took a fade-away jumper from
the right corner and was fouled by Husky Jeff
Sanor. The clock read double zeros, and Vlahov was
at the line with a chance to win it.
The Aussie's first shot rattled both sides of the
rim and fell out. He then swished his second attempt
to tie the score.
"That was really a tough one. I've never been in

that situation before," Vlahov said. "The crowd all
descended and a ton of things went through my
mind. After the first one I thought, shit, I better
make this one or things will be bad."
Things started off well for Stanford in the first
OT. Butler had a layup, and after a Washington
turnover, forward junior Howard Wright went to
the line to shoot two free throws.
The momentum turned, however, when he
clanged the first one off the front of the rim and
the second one off the back, and things were now
going badly for Stanford.
Washington took a 76-75 lead on free throws by
West and a 3-pointer by Sanor, but Jenkins made
only one of two free thows with 14 seconds left,
and Stanford had a chance to win or tie.
Lichti's first try almost ended in disaster. He
drove the lane and was tied up by Todd Lautenbach
for a jump ball. Luckily for the Stanford team, the
possession arrow was pointing its way.
Only three seconds remained, but somehow Lichti
got free and took the inbounds pass in the left
corner. He squared to the hoop and let fly a shot
which swished. For a moment the crowd thought
it was a 3-pointer for a Stanford win, but Lichti
was clearly over the line and a second OT ensued.

SEATTLE, Wash. - The Stanford
men's basketball team couldn't quite
find a handle on the broom Saturday
afternoon.
The Cardinal was aiming for its
first road sweep of the Washington
schools since 1960, but in the end

ran out of escapes as the Washington Huskies pulled
out an 84-82 double overtime victory at Hec Ed
monson Pavilion.
The cardiac Cardinal postponed imminent defeat
twice before finally succumbing to the aggressive
Huskies. With no time left on the clock at the end
of regulation and Washington leading 71-70, fresh
man Andrew Vlahov made one of two free throws
to send the game into extra time.
Then at the end of the first overtime, junior
guard Todd Lichti hit a 19-foot jumper from the
corner with two seconds left to tie the game at
77-77 and give Stanford its second life.
Finally, in the second stanza of suspense, Wash
ington's sophomore guard Eldridge Recasner proved
to be too much for the Cardinal. Recasner scored

two buckets and fed backcourt mate Troy Morrel
for the winning score. Stanford failed to get off a
last shot as time ran out.
"It didn't seem to be in the cards for us," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said after the game. "The
kids don't think they prepared as well as they could
have."
Stanford's record dropped to 16-8 overall, 8-5 in
the Pac-10. The Huskies, who had lost four straight
and eight of their last 10, improved to 7-14, 3-9.
For Washington, the victory was especially sweet
after losing to California in overtime on Thursday
night.
"It's incredible the things we had to overcome to
win today," Husky Coach Andy Russo said. "We
were saying to ourselves 'The worst thing that can
happen is that we lose, and we've already done that
before.' "
Recasner was unstoppable nearly all afternoon.
The Huskies executed a deliberate offense that used
up at least 30 seconds almost every possession. And
more often than not the ball ended up in Recasner's
hands. The sophomore would juke, drive or spin
and then float the ball through the hoop.
Recasner scored 28 points, going 11-for-16 from
the field and 4-for-5 from the free throw line.
