# Efforts to educate students about grape boycott begin
## 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
In an effort to educate Stanford students
about the United Farm Workers boycott of
table grapes, MEChA and the Office of Stu
dent Affairs today will begin their two-week
informational campaign about grapes and pes
ticides.
The campaign, which is designed to present
both the UFW's position calling for the boycott
and the Grape Workers and Farmers Coalition
opposing it, will culminate in a campus vote
on the issue in each of the University
residences at house meetings from Feb. 29 to
March 4.
The vote will allow each residence to decide
if it wants to boycott grapes. University Food
Service officials have said that grapes will not
be served in the dining halls of residences
that have voted to ban grapes.
The impetus behind the education campaign
and dorm vote comes from MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group that has worked
since last spring to get a University-wide grape
boycott. According to MEChA member and

campaign coordinator Marc Pizarro, MEChA
wanted "to give people the opportunity to
boycott and give the UP'W the support they
need."
Last spring, Food Service decided to ignore
an ASSU Senate resolution to ban grapes,
arguing for the individual's right of choice.
Despite student complaints, Food Service con
tinued to uphold its policy and not support
the boycott. However, Food Service did stop
serving grapes in late spring saying that the
rising price made it economically impractical,
and resumed serving them during the sum
mer.
This fall, the senate again voted to support
the boycott, but Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and Director of Housing and
Food Service Keith Guy responded with ar
guments that students should be able to
choose for themselves. Currently, Food Serv
ice says it will continue serving grapes as long
as students continue to eat them.
MEChA later decided that by educating stu
dents about the boycott, students could make
a more informed decision about the boycott.
MEChA asked the University to pay for efforts

to inform students on the issue, and the Uni
versity agreed to pay for educational materials
that present both sides of the issue.
"We want (the growers) to have their in
formation out," said Pizarro, a junior. "We
feel their angle in the debate is pretty easily
refuted."
This week the Office of Student Affairs and
MEChA will distribute flyers to each of the
residences outlining arguments for and
against the grape boycott. MEChA members
will be available to answer questions about
the boycott in White Plaza from 11 a.m. to
1 p.m., Tuesday through Friday, and during
regular office hours at El Centro.
Resident assistant education will take place
on Wednesday and Thursday with the showing
of the UFW's movie "The Wrath of Grapes"
and the Grape Workers and Farmers
Coalition's movie "Grape Boycott Behind the
Smoke and Mirrors."
In addition, the films will be shown at Bran
ner Hall, Florence Moore Hall, Governor's
Corner, Lagunita Court, Stern Hall and Wil
bur Hall on Feb. 22 and 23.
