Match by match,

tournament, Jeff
Tarango, Patrick
McEnroe and the
Stanford men's
tennis team grow

stronger.
Following lukewarm Cardinal
team performances against Ten
nessee (Jan. 23), Georgia Tech
(Jan. 24) and San Jose State (Feb.
2), Tarango and McEnroe got into
high gear by making the semi
finals of the Rolex National In
door Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships in Minneapolis
last weekend.
And yesterday Tarango and
McEnroe continued where they
left off in Minneapolis, leading an
impressive Stanford showing
against high-caliher opponents in
reaching the finals of the Hobee's
Northern California Intercol
legiate Tennis Championships at
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Five Cardinal singles players,
including Jeff Cathrall and Barry
Richards, reached the quarter
finals, while two Stanford doubles
teams made the semifinals. Only

an upstart California doubles
team spoiled a Stanford sweep in
both the singles and doubles final.
The singles final between the
Cardinal's top two players starts
at 1:30 p.m. today at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium.
"I think the guys are getting
real tournament-tough," Stanford
Asst. Coach John Whitlinger said.
"It seems to me our team — a
team with a lot of talent — will
get better with each match."
Tarango, the third seed, had a
surprisingly easy time yesterday
in the semifinals against second
seeded Woody Hunt of Cal. The
Stanford sophomore led from
start to finish against Hunt, clob
bering the nation's No. 15 player
6-2, 6-4. Hunt had defeated
Cathrall in straight sets Sunday
in the quarterfinals.
"Jeff (Tarango) is hitting the
ball a lot harder," Hunt said. "On
a couple of big points he came up
with some amazing shots. He had
the momentum the whole way; I
never had a chance to get any
confidence during the match."
McEnroe capped five singles
wins since the tournament began
Saturday by upending his doubles

partner Martin Blackman yesterday in
the semifinals 7-5, 6-3. Blackman upset
fourth-seeded Malcolm Allen of San
Jose State Sunday to reach the semis.
Though Blackman repeatedly crushed
his serves, backhands and forehands

yesterday, the steadier McEnroe wore
the Cardinal freshman down in the end.
In doubles competition yesterday,
McEnroe and Blackman paired to stifle
fourth-seeded Allen and Roberto
Diguilio of San Jose in the semifinals
6-4, 6-3.
"Our games complement each other
well," McEnroe said about himself and
Blackman. "I think we have a lot of

potential to be a real tough team."
The lone blemish for Stanford yes
terday was in the other doubles semi
final. Tarango and freshman David
Wheaton, the nation's No. 2-ranked
doubles team and the tournament's top
seed, bowed to Cal's Eisenman-
Sherman pair 6-0, 7-5. The Tarango-
Wheaton tandem could hold serve only
once in the match.
