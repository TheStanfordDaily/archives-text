### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
In a matter of
months, Sandra
Birch went from
being one of the
top juniors in the
world to being the
No. 4 player on the

Stanford women's tennis team.
But this seems to be bad news
only for the other No. 4 players
across the nation.
"I realized that coming here,"
said the freshman from Hunting
ton Bay, N.Y., commenting on the
possibility of having to play in the
bottom half of the Cardinal
lineup. "I think it's the price you
pay for such a great tennis school.
And I don't know that it's a price.
I guess it's really just prestige —
the number."
Regardless of where she plays
in the lineup, prestige will come
easily to Birch if she continues to
play the way she did Friday, when
she whitewashed San Diego
State's Julie Tullberg — ranked
40th in the preseason singles poll
— 6-0, 6-0 to set the tone for the
Cardinal's 9-0 victory over the
visiting Aztecs.
Top-ranked Stanford improved
its record to 4-0. San Diego State,
which also lost 8-1 Saturday at
California, is now 1-2. The Car
dinal returns to action today at
1:30 p.m. at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium against San Jose State.
The match against the Spartans
was originally slated for Jan. 29
but had to be rescheduled due to
rain.
Birch struggled through most
of the preseason tournaments,
but she has come out smoking in
the first two weeks of dual-match
play, winning each of her first
four matches in straight sets.
"I had a difficult time adjusting
here — being far away from home
and (with) the work load," she
said. "I wasn't pleased at all with
my performance in the fall. But
I feel better with my game (now)."
Birch moved up a notch to play
No. 3 Friday because of the ab
sence of junior Eleni Rossides,
who was forced to sit out the
match with a pulled muscle. Ros
sides, who will play No. 1 for the
Cardinal, has yet to see action in
a dual match this season.

With Rossides out of the lineup,
freshman Tami Whitlinger occu
pied the top spot and made quick
work of Aztec junior Sondra
Mitchell. Whitlinger lost just 15
points in the match and rolled to
a 6-1, 6-0 victory.
The Cardinal won three other
singles matches in straight sets:
sophomore Lisa Green (No. 2)
bested Kristen Hill 6-1, 6-3; fresh
man Teri Whitlinger (No. 4)
defeated Michelle Apra 7-6, 6-1;
and sophomore Valerie Wilson
(No. 6) breezed past Karen Cooper
6-2, 6-0.
Senior Kay Tittle rallied in the
No. 5 match to complete the Stan
ford singles sweep. Tittle trailed
4-1 in the third set against Aztec
freshman Dorey Brandt but won
the next five games to post a 4-6,
7-5, 6-4 victory.
In doubles, Birch and senior
Cari Hagey, who are vying to be
the Cardinal's No. 1 team this
season, got a chance to play in
the top spot Friday and made the
most of the opportunity, defeating
Brandt and Tullberg 6-1, 6-3.
The Whitlingers, who played
No. 1 in Stanford's previous dual
match, beat Mitchell and Hill in
the No. 2 contest by a 6-2, 6-4
score. Tittle and Green rounded
out the doubles with a 6-2, 6-3
victory at No. 3.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said last week that he is still un
decided as to which team will oc
cupy the No. 1 doubles spot on a
regular basis. "I'm still looking
for one of those teams to dominate
a little bit. ... I'd like to see
[them] start to show me some
more stuff," Brennan said.
"I'm trying to get them to close
into the net more, to poach, to
hit the overhead," he added. "The
Whitlingers are good at staying
in there (at the net), but they
don't put it away. Hagey and
Birch can put it away, but they
don't stay in there."
Despite de-emphasizing the im
portance of the positions in the
lineup, Birch said, "Of course, I'd
like to play No. 1 (doubles)." She
added that she and Hagey com
plement each other well on the
court."I love playing with Cari
Hagey. Not only is she a great
player, but she's a great person.
It's a real pleasure to play with
her."

With Rossides out of the lineup,
freshman Tami Whitlinger occu
pied the top spot and made quick
work of Aztec junior Sondra
Mitchell. Whitlinger lost just 15
points in the match and rolled to
a 6-1, 6-0 victory.
The Cardinal won three other
singles matches in straight sets:
sophomore Lisa Green (No. 2)
bested Kristen Hill 6-1, 6-3; fresh
man Teri Whitlinger (No. 4)
defeated Michelle Apra 7-6, 6-1;
and sophomore Valerie Wilson
(No. 6) breezed past Karen Cooper
6-2, 6-0.
Senior Kay Tittle rallied in the
No. 5 match to complete the Stan
ford singles sweep. Tittle trailed
4-1 in the third set against Aztec
freshman Dorey Brandt but won
the next five games to post a 4-6,
7-5, 6-4 victory.
In doubles, Birch and senior
Cari Hagey, who are vying to be
the Cardinal's No. 1 team this
season, got a chance to play in
the top spot Friday and made the
most of the opportunity, defeating
Brandt and Tullberg 6-1, 6-3.
The Whitlingers, who played
No. 1 in Stanford's previous dual
match, beat Mitchell and Hill in
the No. 2 contest by a 6-2, 6-4
score. Tittle and Green rounded
out the doubles with a 6-2, 6-3
victory at No. 3.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said last week that he is still un
decided as to which team will oc
cupy the No. 1 doubles spot on a
regular basis. "I'm still looking
for one of those teams to dominate
a little bit. ... I'd like to see
[them] start to show me some
more stuff," Brennan said.
"I'm trying to get them to close
into the net more, to poach, to
hit the overhead," he added. "The
Whitlingers are good at staying
in there (at the net), but they
don't put it away. Hagey and
Birch can put it away, but they
don't stay in there."
Despite de-emphasizing the im
portance of the positions in the
lineup, Birch said, "Of course, I'd
like to play No. 1 (doubles)." She
added that she and Hagey com
plement each other well on the
court."I love playing with Cari
Hagey. Not only is she a great
player, but she's a great person.
It's a real pleasure to play with
her."

In a matter of
months, Sandra
Birch went from
being one of the
top juniors in the
world to being the
No. 4 player on the

Stanford women's tennis team.
But this seems to be bad news
only for the other No. 4 players
across the nation.
"I realized that coming here,"
said the freshman from Hunting
ton Bay, N.Y., commenting on the
possibility of having to play in the
bottom half of the Cardinal
lineup. "I think it's the price you
pay for such a great tennis school.
And I don't know that it's a price.
I guess it's really just prestige —
the number."
Regardless of where she plays
in the lineup, prestige will come
easily to Birch if she continues to
play the way she did Friday, when
she whitewashed San Diego
State's Julie Tullberg — ranked
40th in the preseason singles poll
— 6-0, 6-0 to set the tone for the
Cardinal's 9-0 victory over the
visiting Aztecs.
Top-ranked Stanford improved
its record to 4-0. San Diego State,
which also lost 8-1 Saturday at
California, is now 1-2. The Car
dinal returns to action today at
1:30 p.m. at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium against San Jose State.
The match against the Spartans
was originally slated for Jan. 29
but had to be rescheduled due to
rain.
Birch struggled through most
of the preseason tournaments,
but she has come out smoking in
the first two weeks of dual-match
play, winning each of her first
four matches in straight sets.
"I had a difficult time adjusting
here — being far away from home
and (with) the work load," she
said. "I wasn't pleased at all with
my performance in the fall. But
I feel better with my game (now)."
Birch moved up a notch to play
No. 3 Friday because of the ab
sence of junior Eleni Rossides,
who was forced to sit out the
match with a pulled muscle. Ros
sides, who will play No. 1 for the
Cardinal, has yet to see action in
a dual match this season.

With Rossides out of the lineup,
freshman Tami Whitlinger occu
pied the top spot and made quick
work of Aztec junior Sondra
Mitchell. Whitlinger lost just 15
points in the match and rolled to
a 6-1, 6-0 victory.
