# Cal left in Cardinal wake
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
A sunny day, a three-day weekend
and a Stanford victory over Cali
fornia. What more could one
want?
The Cardinal women's swim
ming team helped make Saturday
a near-perfect day, ending its dual-

meet season by burying the Golden Bears 149-119
at deGuerre Pool. The Cardinal ends the regular
season with a 6-1 record, including a 5-0 mark
against Pacific 10 Conference foes. The Bears
are 8-2, 4-1 in the Pac-10.
"I thought (the meet) went pretty well," soph
omore Susannah Miller said. "People got up and
swam well when they had to."
In addition to winning the meet, the Cardinal
also qualified two relay teams for the NCAA
championships. Seniors Jen Pokluda and Susan
Rapp and juniors Jenna Johnson and Aimee Ber
zins started off the meet by winning the 200-yard
medley relay in an NCAA-qualifying time, and
freshman Jody Smith, Rapp, sophomore Laurie
McLean and Berzins qualified the 200 freestyle
relay team in a deGuerre Pool-record time of
1:34.98, winning that event in the process.
Johnson also won the three individual events
she swam, taking honors in the 100. and 200
free and the 100 butterfly. "Jenna had a good
triple," Stanford Coach George Haines said.
Other winners included junior Michelle
Donahue in the 100 back, Miller in the 200 back,
Berzins in the 50 free and senior Leslie Klein
heksel in both the one- and three-meter diving
competitions.

The meet also marked the return to competi
tion of junior Dana Anderson, who scored for
the Cardinal in the 1,000 free. Anderson, who
won All-America honors in both the 200 and 500
free events last year, competed for the first time
since she broke her wrist four weeks ago.
"I was really glad to get back with the team,"
she said. "In two weeks of swimming without
my cast, I'll get my stroke back."
Next up for the Cardinal is the Pac-10 Cham
pionships Feb. 25-27. The Cardinal expects to
get a stern test there from Cal. "We're going to
have a hard time beating them (at Pac-10s),"
Haines said. "Arizona State is going to be tough
(too). It'll be tough to win. We won't be shaving
many girls; they'll shave almost everybody."
Anderson is confident about the way she and
her teammates have been swimming. "We've
swum well," she said. "Even with all that (various
injuries and illness striking team members) . . .
we're still swimming pretty fast. We just need a
good conference (meet)."
Only 17 swimmers per team can travel to the
NCAA meet, and Anderson thinks Stanford has
a chance at having more than that many
qualifiers. "Everyone's going to pull together.
That (the competition to make the NCAA trav
eling team) is really going to push a lot of people
to do well at conference."
Stanford is still training almost exclusively for
the NCAA championships, Mar. 17-19 in Austin,
Tex., and only the swimmers who need to make
NCAA cuts will be rested for Pac-lOs.
Miller, who said she "was really happy" after
posting season-best times in all three events she
swam, thinks the two weeks off from meets will
help a lot. "We'll be able to get more work in
over the next two weeks ... to peak for.NCAAs."
