This weekend, the 1988
NCAA men's gymnastics
war staged its first great
battle. Defending cham
pion UCIJV won. Stan
ford lost.
For the 8-3 Cardinal,

though, there are four more battles left.
Of their six remaining meets, including
April's NCAA Championships, four will
include at least one of the few squads
considered its major competition for the
collegiate title.
At the UCLA Invitational on Satur
day, the Cardinal scored 277.75 points,
taking fourth place behind three of these
rivals. The Bruins, in front of a partisan
crowd of approximately 5,000, took first
ahead of top-ranked Illinois and last

season's NCAA runner-up, Nebraska.
Finishing behind Stanford were Arizona
State, Minnesota and New Mexico.
According to junior Scott Schaffer, a
knee injury sustained in warm-ups by
senior co-captain Randy Besosa esc
alated into a general team demise.
"It caused a palpable difference of en
ergy level in the team," Schaffer said.
"We were basically counting on him for
the big scores, along with the other two
seniors (co-captain Mike Matzek and
Chuck Gerardo)."
In contrast to last weekend, when
scores better than 9.6 abounded, the
best Cardinal showing was Matzek's
9.65 rings routine. A testimony to the
meet's tough judging is the fact that
Conrad Voorsanger's 9.45 on the parallel
bars was a meet best, as the sophomore
took Stanford's only individual meet
honor.
