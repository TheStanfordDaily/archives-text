# Card falls in Fullerton

Winning isn't everything.
This weekend, the Stan
ford women's gymnastics
team proved that gaining
experience is often more
valuable than chalking
up a victory.

The final team totals — Cal State-
Fullerton 185.15, Stanford 173.8 — do
not reflect the quality of the gymnasts'
performances throughout the meet. "We
did what we set out to do," asserted
Stanford Coach Homer Sardina. The

meet "was very positive in that respect,"
he said.
Sardina attributed the low team score
to what he called biased Southern Cal
ifornia judging. "The scoring was two
to three-tenths low on our team; the
head judge was consistently low for us
and consistently high for them," he said.
Hopefully, the apathy displayed in this
meet will have vanished when the Car
dinal faces Fullerton St. again this Fri
day at Maples Pavilion. Sardina is con
fidently anticipating this second
meeting. "There's nothing I'd rather do
right now than beat Cal State-
Fullerton," he said.
