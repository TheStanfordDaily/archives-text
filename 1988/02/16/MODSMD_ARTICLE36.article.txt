The No. 12
Stanford volleyball
team (6-6) upped
its 1988 home
record to 2-0 with

a convincing 15-5, 15-11, 13-15,
15-4 win against Chico State Sat
urday afternoon. The victory was
the fourth consecutive for the
Cardinal, which defeated the
Wildcats the Saturday before in
Chico.
"We played a solid match, if not
a spectacular match," Stanford
Coach Fred Sturm said. "I was
especially pleased with our per
formance in the final game."
And well he should be. The Car
dinal rode a .538 hitting percent
age to an easy victory in the final
game, while limiting Chico to a
paltry seven kills. The Wildcats
could never really get themselves
in sync all afternoon, finishing
with a very poor .138 hitting per
centage. Their problems at the
net were only compounded by a
mediocre setting effort, as they
finished with a .347 setting per
centage.
The Cardinal, however, seemed
invincible when they were able to
get the ball cleanly to their setter.
Stanford hit at a tremendous .419
clip for the match, led by fresh
man John Alstrom's 15 kills and
.609 hitting percentage. The Car
dinal hitters had a lot of help
from their setters who set at an

excellent .537 mark for the match.
"We sided out extremely well,"
Sturm said. "We were able to hit
well enough to keep them from
scoring, even when we were
having trouble scoring ourselves."
The one negative that must
have stuck in the minds of Stan
ford fans at the conclusion of the
match was the team's inability to
consistently score. Although the
team dug reasonably well, finish
ing with 50 digs (led by Alstrom's
17), the Cardinal had a lot of
trouble blocking and serving. The
squad, despite 11 successful
blocks, finished with seven block
ing errors and 14 service miscues.
"No, we didn't block really
well," Sturm said. "That is an
area of our game we certainly
need to work on if we are to be
competitive in the tough league
we play in."
Sophomore Dan Hanan, who
led the team with five block as
sists and one solo effort, con
curred. "I thought we could have
blocked better," he said. "At times
our communication in that area
wasn't very strong."
Overall, though, it was a very
good match for the Cardinal. Not
only did Stanford come away with
a win, but the team was able to
work on a lot of its problem areas.
Most importantly, senior Darryl
Rouse, who has abruptly become
the Cardinal's second setter, was
able to set the entire third game
for Stanford. Although Stanford
lost that game, Sturm was happy
with Rouse's performance.
"Darryl played well," he said.
