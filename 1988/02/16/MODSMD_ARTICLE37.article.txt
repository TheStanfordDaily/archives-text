# Swimmers drop 2 in L.A.

It's too bad they weren't
playing horseshoes.
The Stanford men's
swimming team scored a
lot of points this weekend
but came up just short
twice, losing at USC Fri-

day 58-55, and at UCLA Saturday, by
an even smaller margin: 57-56.
The two losses bring the fourth
ranked Cardinal's dual meet record to
5-4, 2-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Unlike Saturday's meet, the contest
against the top-ranked Trojans was not
as close as the score indicated. "We
didn't swim well at all against USC,"
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney said. "It
was not a good team performance at all."
Stanford opened the meet by winning
the medley relay, but then things went
downhill from there. The high point was
the diving competition, where junior
Matt Frawley and freshman Mike Bur
ton went one-two off both the one- and
three-meter boards.

In the pool, however, Stanford won
only three events. Sophomore John
Witchel won the 200-yard freestyle,
senior Anthony Mosse won the 200 but
terfly and senior Sean Murphy took the
200 backstroke.
The following day's meet in Westwood
was considerably closer. Stanford lost
the medley relay by .01 second to open
the meet and could never make up the
difference.
"We lost that meet by one one
hundredth of a second," Kenney said.
The relay was marred by some shady
Bruin tactics that likely won them the
race. The UCLA B team stopped in the
middle of the pool, waiting for Stanford
to turn and come back the other way.
UCLA then swam as hard as they could
opposite the Stanford team in an ad
joining lane so their wake created a cur
rent that slightly slowed the Cardinal.
"When you train athletes as hard as
these kids work, it's really disheartening
to see that happen," Kenney said.
The Cardinal's next, and final, dual
meet is Feb. 27, when California comes
to deGuerre Pool.
