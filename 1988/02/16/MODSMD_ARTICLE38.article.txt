# Cornelius ill, golfers suffering

### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
Forced to compete with
out the services of its
number one player, the
Stanford women's golf
team struggled to 12th
place after the first
round of the Arizona In-

tercollegiate tournament in Tucson
Monday.
Senior Kay Cornelius, a preseason
All-American and the team's most con
sistent performer this year, had to be
taken to the hospital early Monday
morning with a severe case of the flu
and will be unable to compete in this

week's tournament.
The four remaining Stanford players,
Jodi Figley, Stephanie Parel, Kristin
Ryan and Michele Lyford, are first-year
players without much experience. With
out the presence of the experienced
senior Cornelius, none of them can af
ford to have a bad round.
The Stanford golfers carded 321 Mon
day, well behind first place Arizona,
USC and Texas, who each fired 300s
to tie for the lead.
Figley was the individual star for
Stanford. She managed a 76 at the
6,100-yard, par-72 Randolph Park Golf
Club, good enough for 15th place in a
field of 75 golfers. Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin was very happy with the fresh

man's play, but he expects her to do
even better in the next two rounds.
If she can improve her putting,
Baldwin believes Figley will "contend
for one of the top finishes." Unfortu
nately, her teammates did not fare as
well, with Parel shooting 80, Ryan 82
and Lyford 83.
Optimistic about the team's prospects
for the final two rounds, Baldwin said
he "expects the team to improve quite
a bit in the next few days, especially
Michelle (Lyford)."
Baldwin attributed the golfers' less
than-stellar play to their inexperience,
indicating they can only score better as
the tournament wears on.
