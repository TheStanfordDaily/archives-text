Artists carry a heavy responsi
bility for maintaining their cul
tural identity in the face of polit
ical and economic adversity, dis
tinguished Nigerian author
Chinua Achebe said Friday night
as he read from his latest novel
before a crowded audience at the
Branner Dining Hall.
Assoc. History Prof. Kennell
Jackson, resident fellow in Bran
ner, introduced Achebe, compar
ing him to black American poet
Langston Hughes. "(Achebel is a
writer for the public ... a writer
for all people," Jackson said.
Greeted by a standing ovation,
Achebe read from his works and
answered questions from the au
dience. Barry Katz, a lecturer in
Values, Technology, Science and
Society, asked Achebe whether he
considered himself a Western
writer in light of the fact that his
work has been placed on tha
reading lists of certain Western
Culture syllabi. "No, since I'm not
a Westerner, I can't be a Western
writer by definition," Achebe
replied.
He explained that he wrote in
English because "more English is

spoken in Africa than in Eu
rope. ... I don't like it, but that
is reality."
Achebe spoke on the "uneasy
relationship that often exists be
tween the artist and authority."
In order to shed light on this prob
lem, Achebe read from his latest
novel, "Anthills of the Savannah."
Achebe also read from his
poems. One, "Remembrance
Day," reflects upon Achebe's view
of the "hypocrisy" of saluting
those who died while at war. Ac
hebe said his native Igbo people
"did not pretend those who were
killed were happy about it." He
said the dead were viewed as being
"very angry in the spirit world"
and would "come back, looking
for their age-mates who are still
alive."
His poem calls people to flee
their town from fear of the "war
dead."
"Beware, Soul Brother" tells of
a black family living away from
its homeland and addresses the
need to stay in touch with one's
heritage. Achebe recalled a time
when Queen Elizabeth II read the
poem with the intent of reading
it as a parable for the Common
wealth community. "That is not
what I had in mind," he said.
