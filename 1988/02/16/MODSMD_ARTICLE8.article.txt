# Farm union leader decries poverty, working conditions

Chicano and Latino farm
workers in the United States
must endure both poverty and
deplorable working conditions,
the national vice president of
the United Farm Workers As
sociation said in a speech here
Saturday.
Dolores Huerta, participat
ing in the second annual con
ference of the California Alli
ance of Progressive Student
Activists, attributed the prob
lems of the workers to several
factors.
One problem, according to

Huerta, is the "low wages"
farm workers receive.
Workers now earn $3.30 per
hour, she said, charging that
the wage is causing an increase
in the number of Chicanos and
Latinos who live below the
poverty level.
Another problem is a govern
ment labor program that al
lows grape growers to bring
workers from Latin American
countries into the United
States on a temporary basis,
she said.
Huerta said many of these
temporary workers — who are in
the United States for less than a
year — do not understand the
dangers of working with several
of the widely used agricultural
pesticides.
Blasting the policy, Huerta
called it "a slave labor pro
gram. ... The growers can keep
bringing in new workers who do
not know of the problems with
the pesticides."
Huerta alleged that many of
these pesticides cause cancer
among workers on grape farms
and contaminate agricultural
towns' drinking water.
Huerta claimed that because of
such pesticides, agricultural work
is now the second most dangerous
occupation in the United States.
She said there have been
thousands of reported incidents
of pesticide-related health prob
lems among farm workers.
"Those are just the reported in
cidents," she said, adding "That
is probably only half of what it

really is."
Huerta related one recent case
in which 52 workers were
poisoned on the H.P. Metzler
Ranch near Del Rey, Calif., a
grape farm owned by
Metropolitan Life Corp. When
workers protested the accident,
they were locked out of their jobs,
Huerta alleged.
According to Huerta, the ranch
was fined "only $50" for the in
cident.
Huerta claimed that only 46 of
the millions of bunches of grapes
shipped from California every
year are tested for pesticides. She
maintained that the equipment
that is used to perform the tests
does not necessarily check for the
harmful pesticides.
Huerta said such pesticide
residues, which sometimes
remain after washing, have been
found on randomly tested grapes.
Despite the dangers associated
with carcinogenic pesticides,
Huerta said their use is not illegal.
"We can't even say that it is illegal
use of pesticides," she said. "The
pesticides are legal, but they are
known carcinogens."
