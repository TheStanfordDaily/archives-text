# Campbell calls praise 'overdone'
## But Hoover head is pleased by recognition from President Reagan 
### Angie Kim Staff writer 
Calling President Reagan's recent lavish praise
of the Hoover Institution "a bit overdone with a
little too much credit for [Hooverl," W. Glenn Camp
bell, the director of Hoover, said last night that he
was nonetheless "pleased" that Hoover scholars had
been recognized for their contributions to public
policy.
Speaking at a White House reception last month
for Hoover's scholars and its Board of Overseers,
Reagan said the Institution has served his admin
istration by contributing to policy discussions with
ideas of "fundamental importance."
He specifically commended Campbell for providing
the "vision and institutional guidance" that make
those contributions possible for the scholars.
Reagan singled out a Hoover public policy guide
titled "The United States in the 1980s," produced
under Campbell's direction, as influencing and even
originating many of the policies of his presidency.
"Not only did I and my administration study it,
but so did Secretary General Gorbachev," Reagan
said. He quoted the Soviet leader as saying, "We
have read this book and have watched all of its
programs become adopted by the Reagan ad
ministration."
Political Science Prof. John Manley said last night
that Reagan's speech is "disturbing evidence" of
the political activities of Hoover. "What's most dis
turbing is that Reagan talks about Hoover's political
role in shaping the agenda for the 19905, even after
he [will be| gone," he said.
According to Campbell, Hoover will soon produce
another major work called "Thinking About

America: The United States in the 19905," that will
analyze current public policy, predict which areas
will be contested in the U.S. political arena and
make recommendations on important issues.
Campbell said the "foremost important issue" in
the upcoming publication is to "make certain that
we maintain peace by doing research and work on
deployment of Strategic Defense Initiative and make
sure this process doesn't get sabotaged."
He classified "stopping the increase on taxes on
the young folks to support us old folks" as the
second top priority, calling the recent increase in
social security taxes and benefits "a terrible error."
"There's good scholarship available to anyone
with wit to use it, including the Democrats, if one
becomes the next president," Campbell said.
Manley said he was "alarmed" by Campbell's
comments, which "show that when Reagan and
Campbell are gone, Hoover will continue to be the
leading conservative think tank."
He also said that Hoover's "main problem lies in
that it is a politically involved think tank pushing
its ideas aided by the good name of our University
— whose commitment is to be non-political and
non-partisan."
Responding to Campbell's claim that Hoover is
a non-political institution and that "if there is any
politicization, it's from Stanford, not Hoover," Man
ley argued that Reagan's comments regarding
Hoover's influence on his policies — and Campbell's
own statements — constitute evidence that "it does
advance a politically conservative agenda and is
definitely politically involved, which raises problems
for Stanford."
Reagan was named an honorary fellow at the
Hoover Institution in 1975.
