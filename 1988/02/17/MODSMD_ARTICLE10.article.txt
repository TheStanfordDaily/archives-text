## 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
The chief economic adviser of the Soviet Union,
Abel Aganbegyan, will make a stop at Stanford
during his upcoming visit to the United States,
according to Jim Garrison, executive director of
the Esalen Institute's U.S.-Soviet Exchange Pro
gram, the group organizing the trip.
Aganbegyan, considered the chief architect of
economic reform in the USSR, will arrive in New
York Feb. 21 to begin a three-week tour to learn
about the U.S. economy.
According to Garrison, "Aganbegyan is proba
bly having more influence on the restructuring
of the Soviet economy and the political system
than anyone outside of the general secretary in
the history of the Soviet Union."
Aganbegyan, who is officially known as the
secretary of the Economics Department of the
Academy of Sciences in the Soviet Union, is
scheduled to lecture here March 10 on
"perestroika," or economic restructuring, at 8:00
p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
According to Esalen press represenative Ted
Stokes, "The main thrust of his visit is twofold.
The first thing he's looking at is the humaniza

tion of technology. How do you motivate people
to a given goal? ... The second thing he's looking
at are joint-venture opportunities with the Soviet
Union and some of the companies here in the
United States."
Garrison described the possibilities for in
creased cooperation between the United States
and the Soviet Union as "incredible," ranging
from the sale of Soviet automobiles in the United
States to the export of American personal com
puters to the Soviet Union.
Garrison, who is a Democratic candidate in
the race for the 12th Congressional District, ex
plained that his platform stresses the need for
increased East-West trade.
According to Garrison, "one of the things I
think [Aganbegyan] is going to argue strongly in
all his speeches ... is that the time has come
to shift the level of interaction between our two
countries away from a military competition to
an economic competition and cooperation."
Garrison added: "In my congressional cam
paign this is very much what I'm running on."
Although Aganbegyan's visit may reflect posi
tively on his campaign, Garrison said, "This trip
is bigger than my campaign. This is history."
