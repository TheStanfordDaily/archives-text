U.S. to reduce Gulf naval force
WASHINGTON — The United States, citing
increased success in combating Iranian mines
and greater cooperation in the region between
Washington and its allies, will reduce by at
least three the number of Navy ships in the
Persian Gulf, a senior Pentagon official said
yesterday.
The decrease in the Mideast naval force
signals no change in the U.S. commitment to
protect U.S.-flagged ships, said Richard Ar
mitage, assistant secretary of defense for in
ternational security affairs.
"We're able to provide the same level of
protection with a smaller number of ships,"
he said, adding that the redeployment has
begun with the departures of the battleship
lowa and two escorts from the Arabian Sea.
Armitage said the planned reductions of
ships in the Mideast, as well as men and
helicopters, had "nothing to do with budget
squeezes."
5 killed in Sri Lankan violence
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — In a day of political
and sectarian violence, at least four people
were killed and more than 50 injured yesterday
by two bombs in a Hindu temple and a leading
opposition politician was slain outside his
home.
Police said thousands of Hindu Tamil
devotees had gathered for a religious festival
at the temple at Wellamatta, south of Colombo.
Witnesses said they heard two large explo
sions late yesterday, one inside the temple and
the other just outside near a banana stall.
Earlier yesterday, gunmen believed to belong
to an outlawed subversive group gunned down
the leader of the left-wing Sri Lankan People's
Party Vijaya Kumaranatunge outside his home
in a Colombo suburb.
Police said Kumaranatunge was shot by two
motorcyclists who blocked his car as he was
about to leave his home. Two others in the
car were injured.
Soviets block demonstrations
MOSCOW — Demonstrations planned in
Lithuania yesterday to commemorate a two
decade period of independence were blocked
by a heavy Soviet police presence and harsh
warnings from local Communist authorities,
according to Lithuanian dissident sources
reached by telephone.
Patrols of uniformed policemen and civilian
auxiliaries have been circulating in the Lit
huanian capital Vilnius since the weekend,
stifling any spontaneous protests, said the
sources, who asked not to be identified for
fear they would be punished.
The sources said the mood in Vilnius was
calm, however, with no visible scufiles or con
flicts in the streets.
Nationalist activists had urged Lithuanians
to place flowers in several places to mark the
small Baltic republic's independence from Rus
sia, which was declared 70 years ago and main
tained until the Soviet Union occupied and
annexed it in 1939 and 1940.
