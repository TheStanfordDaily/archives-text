# Dukakis wins big in New Hampshire

### 
MANCHESTER, N.H - Massachu
setts Gov. Michael Dukakis coasted to
an easy victory in the Democratic pres
idential primary in this neighboring
New England state Tuesday while Mis
souri Rep. Richard Gephardt appeared
to have edged out Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon in a strategically crucial battle
for runner-up.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, demonstrat
ing as he did in last week's lowa
caucuses his ability to pull votes outside
his base of black support, finished in
fourth place. Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr., Former Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt and former Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart brought up the rear in that order.
With 99 percent of the precincts
reporting, these were the results:
Dukakis, 37 percent; Gephardt, 20 per
cent; Simon 17 percent; Jackson 8 per
cent; Gore, 7 percent; Babbitt, 5 per
cent; Hart, 4 percent, and other, 2 per
cent.
"I love the people of New Hampshire,"
Dukakis told a cheering crowd of sup

porters at a victory rally here. "Last
week in lowa our message started to
shine through, and we won a bronze.
Tonight, here in New Hampshire, our
message came through loud and clear,
We went for the gold and we won it."
In comments to his supporters, Gep
hardt reflected the optimism among his
advisers that his apparent second-place
finish here would provide an important
boost to his fund-raising efforts before
the Super Tuesday primary.
Asserting that he had been warned
on arriving in New Hampshire last week
after his victory in lowa that voters
here were too comfortable to respond
to the issues he emphasized in econom
ically distressed lowa, Gephardt said:
"We proved this is one nation and one
country and we proved that the people
of New Hampshire care about the eco
nomy and care about the country and
care about this cause."
For his part Simon, in the face of his
third-place finish, was more subdued,
but he vowed to continue his campaign.

"The returns tonight are not what
we had hoped for," Simon told cheering
supporters at a rally after the returns
came in. "But the most important thing
is what we stand for ... a nation that
cares again.... So we go on tomorrow
to Minnesota and South Dakota."
Dukakis' victory here bolstered the
notion that he was the closest thing to
a front-runner to emerge in the 1988
Democratic race. He entered the New
Hampshire contest with a huge financial
advantage over his adversaries and the
success here is certain to keep the funds
rolling in and assure him of continued
media attention.
Gephardt's apparent second-place
finish means that he will be able to
pose a strong challenge to Dukakis in
the South, where many believe that
Gephardt has more potential appeal
than the New England governor.
Indeed, the Gephardt forces are al
ready primed for their next clash with
Dukakis in the South Dakota primary.
