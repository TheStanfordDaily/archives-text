# Bush defeats Dole in GOP primary
## 
### 
MANCHESTER, N.H. - Vice Presi
dent Bush, battered by a third-place
finish in the lowa precinct caucuses a
week ago, dramatically revived his pres
idential campaign yesterday night with
a convincing victory over Sen. Robert
Dole, R-Kan., in the New Hampshire
Republican primary.
But Bush fought back, unveiling a
new campaign stump speech with
retooled rhetoric, threw up a new, nega
tive television commercial that accused
Dole of "straddling" on issues such as
the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty with the Soviet Union and an
oil import fee and turned to folksy cam
paign events designed to appeal to the
cameras. Finally, on the eve of the
voting, he brought in former senator
Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., the 1964 Re
publican presidential nominee, for an
endorsement.

Bush also benefited from his close
identification with President Reagan in
this conservative state and a strong field
organization that was put together by
his New Hampshire campaign chair,
Gov. John Sununu.
Yesterday night, a jubilant Bush told
supporters, "I have a lot in common
with Mark Twain; reports of my death
were greatly exaggerated."
Referring to his defeat in lowa, Bush
told his New Hampshire supporters, "I
think you just don't like being told what
to do."
Dole and his aides bitterly assailed
the negative Bush commercials for first
blunting his momentum from lowa and
eventually turning the tide into a clear
cut Bush victory.
In the NBC interview, Dole said the
Bush ads were "fiat-out distortions" of
hi record. "I'm not for raising taxes

and he knows it," Dole said.
Earlier yesterday night, Dole
conceded that Bush's victory here
"keeps him the front-runner." Conced
ing defeat before his supporters, Dole
said, "I can stand here with my head
held high because I know my messagp
. . . is going to sell in the South just as
it did in New Hampshire and the state
of lowa."
But clearly stung by the size of his
defeat, Dole could not resist jabbing at
Bush. "Note that I didn't leave early
when I thought I might be losing," he
said, a reference to Bush's decision to
leave lowa last week before Dole's vic
tory.
Almost all the candidates immediately
turned their attention to the South, the
next major battleground in the March
8 "Super Tuesday" contests.
