# PLO threatens reprisals over deaths, boat bomb

NICOSIA, Cyprus — The Palestine
Liberation Organization threatened
yesterday to retaliate against Israel
for the killing of three officials of the
guerrilla organization and the bomb
ing of a PLO-chartered vessel on this
Mediterranean island.
The Cypriot government denounced
the two attacks as "unacceptable and
impermissible." It said that it will in
vestigate to determine who was behind
them.
The vessel, the ferryboat Sol
Phryne, had been acquired by the PLO
as its much-publicized "ship of
return." The organization plans to
transport 130 Palestinians, who were
deported in recent years by the Israeli
government, to the Israeli port of
Haifa. The Israelis have said that they
will not allow the ship to land.
The undisguised aim of the voyage,
complete with foreign dignitaries and

about 200 journalists, was to capitalize
on the current uprising in the Israeli
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
by evoking the image of the ship Ex
odus, which attempted to carry Jewish
refugees to Palestine after World War
II but was turned back by the British.
The three PLO officials who were
killed Saturday in the Cypriot port of
Limassol are believed to have arranged
the sale of the ferryboat to a PLO
affiliated organization. The PLO ac
quired the ship after failing repeatedly
to charter a vessel in Greece.
The PLO has accused Israel of car
rying out the attacks. Israeli officials
would not comment on the charge.
Anonymous telephone callers saying
that they spoke for the Jewish Defense
League and for Kach, a militant Israeli
organization, claimed responsibility
for the ferryboat bombing, but official

spokesmen for both groups would not
acknowledge the attack.
"Israel knows that the PLO is not
handcuffed," the PLO said in a state
ment issued here in Nicosia and at its
headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia. "The
blood of our martyrs will not go un
avenged."
"The Israelis should know the Cairo
Declaration is not a commitment from
one side only, and they must under
stand that terrorism is a double-edged
sword and that patience has its limits,"
Yasir Arafat said at a news conference.
Arafat asserted that an Israeli frog
man had been brought to Limassol
harbor by an Israeli warship and that
the frogman had planted the charge
against the hull of the Sol Phryne.
Referring to the deaths of the three
PLO officials, who were killed by a
car bomb shortly after the ferryboat
purchase, Arafat blamed the Israeli

security service, the Mossad.
"If Mossad thinks it can at any mo
ment assassinate some of our heroes,"
Arafat said, "they should not thirik
our hand is short. They know moft
than others that we can gpt, them i»
any place or at any time."
Arafat maintained that the "ship of
return" will sail despite the bombing,
which effectively rendered the vessel
unseaworthy for several months.
Ironically, the closest dry dock for re
pairs is in Haifa, the ferry's intended
destination.
Neither the PLO statement nor
Arafat gave any indication of what
type of action the guerrillas might be
contemplating against Israel. While
the Cairo Declaration rules out attacks
outside Israeli territory, raids on
facilities within Israel are regarded as
acceptable.
