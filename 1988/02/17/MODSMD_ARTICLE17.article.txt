## Avoid 'groupthink' 
### 
EVERY ONCE in a while a
decision is rendered in which
everyone wins and no one
loses. Last week's modifications to
the Freshman English program are
just such a decision.
Originally, the plan was to offer
a special class to students whose
first language was not English as
an adjunct to their regular Fresh
man English classes.
The idea, proposed by Audrey
Bernfield, the director of the Un
dergraduate Advising Center, was
that students who had trouble with
grammar and syntax would be
aided by this program.
Several groups raised objections
to the proposal on the grounds that
it could create "de facto seg
regation" of minority students.
Clearly, segregation was not
what Bernfield had in mind when
she made the proposal; and there
is little doubt she never would have
made it had she realized the con
sequences.
Instead, the process was opened
to discussion, and all the relevant
actors were given the chance to
meet with Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Thomas Wasow, who has
final authority on any changes in
the program.
The end result of their discus
sion was a proposal wholly differ
ent from the original plan.
In addition to creating a new
course for foreign students as an
add-on, changes were made within
the existing program to improve it
without dividing minority students
out of the mainstream.
Efforts will be made to actively
recruit minority tutors and to train
the program's instructors in cul
tured understanding. There will
also be a survey taken of students
in the program to determine
whether the writing problems of
students from diverse cultural
backgrounds are being adequately
addressed.

The best thing about the
decision-making process, though,
was not the decision itself but the
manner in which it was arrived at.
Often, in a large, bureaucratic
environment like a university it is
easy for bad ideas to be turned
into policy through a "groupthink"
process. One person will come up
with what they perceive to be a
good idea idea and then pass it on
to someone else.
That second person often will be
able to view the proposal only
through the lens provided by the
first. They often will get caught
up in the excitement of the idea
without examining it carefully.
The distortion that this creates
leads to a feeling of infallibility in
the idea and, before long, everyone
feels like they have built a better
mousetrap.
Of course, the process is quite
insular and exposes the plan to
precious little scrutiny. When an
idea is not open to criticism, it is
unlikely anyone will have a chance
to find any flaws the plan might
harbor.
This time, however, the bureau
cracy did not blindly railroad the
plan into effect.
At the urgings of graduate stu
dent Greg Sarris and Asst. Dean
of Student Affairs Faye McNair-
Knox, Wasow called last week's in
formal meeting at which the ideas
were hashed out and the decisions
were made.
Hopefully, when an issue that
affects so many undergraduates
needs to be worked on in the fu
ture, other University administra
tors will follow the Wasow model.
All those concerned should be
invited to sit down together and
explain the decisions. When that
route is taken, the resulting deci
sion is most likely to be the best
one â€” for everyone involved.
