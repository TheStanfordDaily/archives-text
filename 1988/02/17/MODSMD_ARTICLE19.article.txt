## Flip-flops fool voters 
### 
POLITICIANS PANDER. It's al
literative, sure, but it's also true.
Last week provided some extremely
nauseating vote-grubbing in New
Hampshire, and what was most interest
ing was seeing candidates who looked so
liberal in lowa trying to tailor their po
sitions on the issues to a much more
conservative New Hampshire electorate.
However, one politician (and I use that
term pejoratively) has been especially un
chaste and deceitful in his presentation
of himself, and his record merits extra
scrutiny.
Richard Gephardt is a Democrat who
is against abortion, against forced busing,
in favor of the MX missile and in favor
of the Reagan tax cut of 1981. Whoops,
I'm sorry! Those were his positions before
he decided to run for president.
Now he takes the exact opposite posi
tions on each of these weighty issues.
(When was the epiphany, Dick? Why have
you done more 180-degree spins than
Debi Thomas? You said you had an "un
wavering opposition to abortion" a few
years ago. Now you're vehemently pro
choice. Hello?) This is disgusting. Even
the usually mild-mannered Bruce Babbitt
takes shots at Gephardt's "versatility of
conviction." Ouch!
Richard Gephardt, a protectionist
populist because it plays so well, also
loves to slam "The Establishment." You
know who they are — they write
editorials for The Wall Street Journal
and The New York Times, they live in
the "power alley" between Boston and
Washington, and congressmen are

definitely charter members of this elite
corps. In fact, you can't get much more
"Establishment" than the congressional
leadership.
Folks, let's be clear: Richard Gephardt,
the number four man in the Democratic
leadership, is The Establishment. Close
examination of Gephardt's voting record
yields even more "flip-flops."
Gephardt spent over 200 days in lowa
in pursuit of the presidency, and until
three weeks before the caucus his support
level never eclipsed single digits. Then
came a "new" Dick Gephardt, one who
made a point of repeatedly slamming big
corporations. lowans loved it!
Oddly, Gephardt has voted in favor of
every corporate tax cut ever introduced.
His voting record portrays a friend of
corporate America and belies his current
speeches. What gives?
Richard Gephardt is a political
chameleon, a Gatsbyesque man of clay
who thinks he can mold, alter and res
hape positions that no longer fly with
the electorate and in essence "invent"
the ideal candidate — himself. But really,
what is Dick Gephardt? (Chopped di . . .?
Never mind!)
He's the quintessential slippery
politician. He deserves no votes, no sup
port and no seat in the House of Repre
sentatives (where he made only 18 per
cent of the roll call votes last year, by
far the worst record in Congress). On
behalf of America, Dick, get out of the
race and take your political wind vane
with you.

Unfortunately for Gephardt (but luck
ily for us), most votes in Congress are
recorded. Therefore, it comes as a
surprise that someone could be so bold
(or stupid!) as to wholeheartedly support
one position while voting for the opposite
position on the floor of Congress. Well,
Congressmen do that all the time, But
Gephardt's the only congressman run
ning for president.
Simply put then, Richard Gephardt is
either A) very confused about taxes, cor
porations, abortion, busing and defense,
or B) blindly ambitious in pursuit of the
presidency and very contemptuous of the
intelligence of Americans. I choose C) all
of the above.
What does Richard Gephardt stand for?
Of course he wants to be elected, and of
course all candidates stress different
aspects of their record in different parts
of the country. That's politics.
But if voters are faced with a political
Jay Gatsby, a man who will do whatever
is necessary to win his ultimate prize,
what are we to do? We are to be skeptical,
informed and alert. Once that happens,
Dick Gephardt is gone.
