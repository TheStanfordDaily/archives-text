# Fraternities taken to task
## Long-awaited report calls for modified selection process 
### Glen Tripp Eric Young Staff writers 
After four years of work, the final report
of the Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities was released to the public yesterday
by Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons. The
report recommends that the University con
tinue to recognize fraternities but reconsider
providing them with housing unless they
adopt more objective selection processes for
their membership.
The report, which the task force presented
Jan. 26 to Lyons, was written by five former
students and nine faculty members.
The task force decided 9-5 that assignment
of student housing may not be denied on the
basis of the subjective judgements of current
or former residents of any given house.
But the task force protected theme houses
and co-ops — which employ subjective selec
tion processes such as judging whether pro
spective residents have fulfilled particular re
quirements — by voting 9-6 in favor of al
lowing subjectivity that the University deems
fair. In both theme houses and co-ops, resi
dents are chosen through the Draw.
"The majority of the task force was not
opposed to the principle of subjective selec
tivity, but only to its use (by students) in
allocation of a valuable resource such as
housing," the 200-page report explained.
If the recommendations take force, tradi
tional fraternal organizations could continue
to exist as social groups, although the 11
residential fraternities would no longer to be
allowed to invite members to live with them
based solely on the judgments of the current
residents.
It is now up to Lyons whether to implement
the controversial proposals. He said he hopes
to issue a policy statement within two months,

after which time discussion will ensue regard
ing possible policy changes.
"This is a subject about which thoughtful
people disagree and have disagreed for a long
time," Lyons said. "No matter what position
is taken here, there's going to be debate and
dispute."
Although the report does not offer sugges
tions on how to implement its proposals,
Lyons said one way to achieve the report's
call for fairer assignment of fraternity housing
would be for housed fraternities to choose
members more as theme houses or co-ops do,
with priorities for students willing to abide
by certain rules or standards.
"Housing is an educational resource which
has to be open to all students," Lyons said.
Fraternity houses need to develop policies that
explain the type of life a pledge can expect,
he added.
Lyons conceded, however, that objective se
lection for fraternities may not be possible.
"It's not clear to me exactly how they can do
this," Lyons said, citing possible problems
with national fraternal charters.
Many fraternal representatives agreed that
the proposal is not feasible. "To make the
selection process objective is impossible,"
Kappa Sigma President Rich Kushel said.
"The basis of our judgment cannot be ex
plained by a checklist," he said. "It's too bad
that those people can't understand what goes
into the fraternal selection process. They've
kind of missed the boat."
Sigma Chi President Charlie Ahem said
that Sigma Chi's selection process is not un
like the process used by the University to
admit freshmen. "Our selection process is
based on who will get the most out of and
who will put the most into our fraternity,"
Ahern said, explaining that objective informa
tion is not indicative of these traits. "We're
looking for people who are enthusiastic and

reliable," he said.
Ahern added that if fraternities' houses
were to be taken away from them, the organ
izations would likely disappear from Stanford.
"I don't think you could change [things] with
out destroying the fraternal system here," he

said.
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Vinnie Frost said he "dis
agreed" with the task force pro
posal. "The special thing about
fraternities," Frost said, "is the
brotherhood created" through
living together.
Assistant to the President
Robert Hamrdla was on of the
nine task force members to vote
in favor of fraternal housing. Al
though "fraternities are not free
from blame, subjective selection
is not reason enough to take away
their housing," he said.
However, Hamrdla admitted
that unhoused fraternities thrive
all over the country. He added
that the task force members who
voted against housing for groups
that are subjectively selective felt
that it was unfair that certain
students get more control over
their place of residence than
others.
The task force also voted to pass
four other recommendations. The

third recommendation of the pro
posal states that all fraternal
groups should be given equal
access to University resources, al
though it does not specify whether
"equal access" would include
housing.
The fourth recommendation
suggests that the University ac
knowledge the value provided by
fraternal organizations and
should afford them University
support and guidance.
The fifth recommendation ac
knowledges alumni support to fra
ternities by stating that all actions
dealing with these groups should
take into consideration that com
mitment and support.
The last of the six recommen
dations gives housed fraternal
groups a three-year transition pe
riod to carry out any changes that
may be necessary.
The task force was appointed
by Lyons in the autumn of 1983.
Recommendations similar to the
ones now being considered were
first made to Lyons in the fall of

though it does not specify whether
"equal access" would include
housing.
The fourth recommendation
suggests that the University ac
knowledge the value provided by
fraternal organizations and
should afford them University
support and guidance.
The fifth recommendation ac
knowledges alumni support to fra
ternities by stating that all actions
dealing with these groups should
take into consideration that com
mitment and support.
The last of the six recommen
dations gives housed fraternal
groups a three-year transition pe
riod to carry out any changes that
may be necessary.
The task force was appointed
by Lyons in the autumn of 1983.
Recommendations similar to the
ones now being considered were
first made to Lyons in the fall of
1984.
After four years of work, the final report
of the Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities was released to the public yesterday
by Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons. The
report recommends that the University con
tinue to recognize fraternities but reconsider
providing them with housing unless they
adopt more objective selection processes for
their membership.
The report, which the task force presented
Jan. 26 to Lyons, was written by five former
students and nine faculty members.
The task force decided 9-5 that assignment
of student housing may not be denied on the
basis of the subjective judgements of current
or former residents of any given house.
But the task force protected theme houses
and co-ops — which employ subjective selec
tion processes such as judging whether pro
spective residents have fulfilled particular re
quirements — by voting 9-6 in favor of al
lowing subjectivity that the University deems
fair. In both theme houses and co-ops, resi
dents are chosen through the Draw.
"The majority of the task force was not
opposed to the principle of subjective selec
tivity, but only to its use (by students) in
allocation of a valuable resource such as
housing," the 200-page report explained.
If the recommendations take force, tradi
tional fraternal organizations could continue
to exist as social groups, although the 11
residential fraternities would no longer to be
allowed to invite members to live with them
based solely on the judgments of the current
residents.
It is now up to Lyons whether to implement
the controversial proposals. He said he hopes
to issue a policy statement within two months,

after which time discussion will ensue regard
ing possible policy changes.
"This is a subject about which thoughtful
people disagree and have disagreed for a long
time," Lyons said. "No matter what position
is taken here, there's going to be debate and
dispute."
Although the report does not offer sugges
tions on how to implement its proposals,
Lyons said one way to achieve the report's
call for fairer assignment of fraternity housing
would be for housed fraternities to choose
members more as theme houses or co-ops do,
with priorities for students willing to abide
by certain rules or standards.
"Housing is an educational resource which
has to be open to all students," Lyons said.
Fraternity houses need to develop policies that
explain the type of life a pledge can expect,
he added.
Lyons conceded, however, that objective se
lection for fraternities may not be possible.
"It's not clear to me exactly how they can do
this," Lyons said, citing possible problems
with national fraternal charters.
Many fraternal representatives agreed that
the proposal is not feasible. "To make the
selection process objective is impossible,"
Kappa Sigma President Rich Kushel said.
"The basis of our judgment cannot be ex
plained by a checklist," he said. "It's too bad
that those people can't understand what goes
into the fraternal selection process. They've
kind of missed the boat."
Sigma Chi President Charlie Ahem said
that Sigma Chi's selection process is not un
like the process used by the University to
admit freshmen. "Our selection process is
based on who will get the most out of and
who will put the most into our fraternity,"
Ahern said, explaining that objective informa
tion is not indicative of these traits. "We're
looking for people who are enthusiastic and

reliable," he said.
Ahern added that if fraternities' houses
were to be taken away from them, the organ
izations would likely disappear from Stanford.
"I don't think you could change [things] with
out destroying the fraternal system here," he

said.
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Vinnie Frost said he "dis
agreed" with the task force pro
posal. "The special thing about
fraternities," Frost said, "is the
brotherhood created" through
living together.
Assistant to the President
Robert Hamrdla was on of the
nine task force members to vote
in favor of fraternal housing. Al
though "fraternities are not free
from blame, subjective selection
is not reason enough to take away
their housing," he said.
However, Hamrdla admitted
that unhoused fraternities thrive
all over the country. He added
that the task force members who
voted against housing for groups
that are subjectively selective felt
that it was unfair that certain
students get more control over
their place of residence than
others.
The task force also voted to pass
four other recommendations. The

third recommendation of the pro
posal states that all fraternal
groups should be given equal
access to University resources, al
though it does not specify whether
"equal access" would include
housing.
The fourth recommendation
suggests that the University ac
