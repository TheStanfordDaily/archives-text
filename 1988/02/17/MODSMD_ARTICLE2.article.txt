# Fraternities taken to task
## Long-awaited report calls for modified selection process 
### Glen Tripp Eric Young Staff writers 
After four years of work, the final report
of the Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities was released to the public yesterday
by Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons. The
report recommends that the University con
tinue to recognize fraternities but reconsider
providing them with housing unless they
adopt more objective selection processes for
their membership.
The report, which the task force presented
Jan. 26 to Lyons, was written by five former
students and nine faculty members.
The task force decided 9-5 that assignment
of student housing may not be denied on the
basis of the subjective judgements of current
or former residents of any given house.
But the task force protected theme houses
and co-ops — which employ subjective selec
tion processes such as judging whether pro
spective residents have fulfilled particular re
quirements — by voting 9-6 in favor of al
lowing subjectivity that the University deems
fair. In both theme houses and co-ops, resi
dents are chosen through the Draw.
"The majority of the task force was not
opposed to the principle of subjective selec
tivity, but only to its use (by students) in
allocation of a valuable resource such as
housing," the 200-page report explained.
If the recommendations take force, tradi
tional fraternal organizations could continue
to exist as social groups, although the 11
residential fraternities would no longer to be
allowed to invite members to live with them
based solely on the judgments of the current
residents.
It is now up to Lyons whether to implement
the controversial proposals. He said he hopes
to issue a policy statement within two months,

after which time discussion will ensue regard
ing possible policy changes.
"This is a subject about which thoughtful
people disagree and have disagreed for a long
time," Lyons said. "No matter what position
is taken here, there's going to be debate and
dispute."
Although the report does not offer sugges
tions on how to implement its proposals,
Lyons said one way to achieve the report's
call for fairer assignment of fraternity housing
would be for housed fraternities to choose
members more as theme houses or co-ops do,
with priorities for students willing to abide
by certain rules or standards.
"Housing is an educational resource which
has to be open to all students," Lyons said.
Fraternity houses need to develop policies that
explain the type of life a pledge can expect,
he added.
Lyons conceded, however, that objective se
lection for fraternities may not be possible.
"It's not clear to me exactly how they can do
this," Lyons said, citing possible problems
with national fraternal charters.
Many fraternal representatives agreed that
the proposal is not feasible. "To make the
selection process objective is impossible,"
Kappa Sigma President Rich Kushel said.
"The basis of our judgment cannot be ex
plained by a checklist," he said. "It's too bad
that those people can't understand what goes
into the fraternal selection process. They've
kind of missed the boat."
Sigma Chi President Charlie Ahem said
that Sigma Chi's selection process is not un
like the process used by the University to
admit freshmen. "Our selection process is
based on who will get the most out of and
who will put the most into our fraternity,"
Ahern said, explaining that objective informa
tion is not indicative of these traits. "We're
looking for people who are enthusiastic and

reliable," he said.
Ahern added that if fraternities' houses
were to be taken away from them, the organ
izations would likely disappear from Stanford.
"I don't think you could change [things] with
out destroying the fraternal system here," he
