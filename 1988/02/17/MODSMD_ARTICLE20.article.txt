## ASSU fee collection is coercive and extortionary 
### 
I'VE BEEN ATTENDING Stanford
since the fall of 1986 and noticed
right away that my tuition bill
includes an ASSU fee. I believe the
method used by the ASSU to collect
its fees is both unfair and unreasona
ble.
My first observation concerns the
way information about the ASSU is
not disseminated. I found out that I
had to pay the ASSU fee before I
could be registered only by reading my
tuition bill. These bills are sent by the
University before each quarter begins.
No information is sent by anyone at
any time about the ASSU.
The situation then is that students
must involuntarily pay to join a volun
tary organization; further, they know

nothing about this organization nor
have they received an invitation to
join.
For those who do not mind support
ing organizations without knowing
exactly what they are supporting, this
is fine. However, I believe quite
strongly that a voluntary organization
that wants my financial support bears
the burden of justifying that support.
Second, the collection of ASSU fees
is extortionary. If students don't pay
their ASSU fees in full by the dead
line, they are not registered at Stan
ford. While not everyone may agree
with me that this rabidly efficient
method of collecting membership fees
fits the definition of extortion, it does
seem to be unnecessarily coercive.

When you get the bill for the ASSU
fee, there is no notification of how to
get a refund or more basically, that a
refund is available. With all due
respect, I do not count advertisements
in The Daily as a notification. If the
bill can be mailed directly to me at my
home address then so can the refund
or at least the schedule for refunds.
Another piece of information not
available is that you must vote in the
ASSU election to be eligible to get a
refund.
I realize that most students probably
find out all about the ASSU rules in
their dormitories. However, students
who live off-campus are left out of
such "information orgies." And the fact
remains: If the ASSU can bill me

directly, the ASSU can send me a
refund directly.
In closing, I'd like to make clear
that my objections lie with the coercive
and unfair way the ASSU collects its
fees, not with the amount of the fee or
even the uses of the fee.
But is it fair for the ASSU to bill
me without first asking me to join and
then providing me with information
about itself? Can it possibly be legal to
deny me a refund of ASSU fees be
cause I didn't vote in a student elec
tion? And why does the ASSU use
such a "strong-arm" method of collect
ing fees anyway?
