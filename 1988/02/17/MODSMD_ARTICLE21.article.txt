# COP veto unfair to student groups
## 
### 
I take exception to the Council of
Presidents' veto of the ASSU Senate's
recommendations for fee assessments
to student groups, upon which stu
dents will vote this spring.
COP member Jim Durkin has at
tacked the senate as being cavalier and
uninformed in its consideration of
these fee assessment recommendations
and with being "unjust" to student
groups.
If Durkin were merely misguided, his
unfounded conduct and statements
wouldn't merit a reply in these pages.
However, it is Durkin and the COP
who are being unjust to the student
body, and the students deserve to be
made aware of this fact.
Student organizations whose budgets
will appear on the spring election
ballots are the ones who will be hurt
by the COP election, not ASSU
senators. The veto (unless overriden by

the senate) will deprive these groups of
their hard-earned "yes" recomendations
and will also deprive voting students of
any guidance in their votes.
The senate's recommendations were
not unjust to any of these groups.
Every group appearing on the ballot
received either a "yes" or a "neutral"
recommandation. Each group had its
preliminary appropriations committee
recommendation either upgraded or
maintained. For example, STOP's
initial "no" recomendation was
upgraded to a "yes" after senate
debate.
The process was not "blind" or
cavalier. The appropriations committee
conducted interviews with the various
groups and subjected their budgets to
a line-by-line analysis. Thereafter, the
senate spent two-and-a-half hours
reviewing the results and in a number
of cases altering the recommendations.
The student organizations affected
by this process aren't complaining;
they have no reason to. What should
concern them, however, is the propen
sity of the COP to disregard their

interests in order to turn a political
power play by "making an example" of
the senate.
