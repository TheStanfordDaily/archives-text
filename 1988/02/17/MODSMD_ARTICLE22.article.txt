# Racism, alienation exists in Ujamaa
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the Feb.
8 editorial, "Race hides issues," and
Socrates Jiminez's Feb. 12 letter.
As a current resident of Ujamaa, I
agree that "the function of cross
cultural theme houses is to provide a
cultural center where peoples of
African, Asian and Latino descent can
live together and share in the explora
tion and celebration of their cultures."
However, it is also true "that a
certain element of separatism and
reverse racism characterizes [Ujamaa]
house."
Ujamaa serves the black community
extremely well; however, it also serves
to alienate the non-blacks. Just a short

time ago some reading was
anonymously slipped under the doors
of some Ujamaa residents. The mate
rial ended with the following lines:
"all that is evil in the world is white
all that is death in the world is white
when you see people who are white
know that they are evil
and death is not far behind."
This is the most extreme example of
what I have experienced living in
Ujamaa, but it is not the only one.
Jimenez is certainly correct. Ujamaa
does not fully serve its purpose to
bring people of different cultures to
gether and perhaps Residential Educa
tion should re-evaluate the situation.
