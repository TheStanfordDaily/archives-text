## Musicians fume over gas 
### Marthe Lemut 
Preparing to blast out a musical storm on his
trombone, Bobby, a jazz musician, sucks in a
lung-full of air. Instead of a harmonious tune,
the only sounds emanating from Bobby are gasps
and coughs. Bobby has been practicing in the
Braun Music Center.
Car fumes are feeding into the air conditioning
system of Braun, creating headaches and com
plaints from faculty members and students at
the Music Department.
Graduate student Annette Richards, an or
ganist, has a class that meets daily in one of the
rooms affected by the fumes.
"After one hour in that room we are suffocating
â€” coughing and spluttering," Richards said.
During class, students must open the door to let
in fresh air from the corridor, she said.
John Planting, administrator at Braun, said
he receives faculty complaints about gassing prob
lems two to three times a week.
Located at ground level on the east side of the
building next to a road that runs behind the
post office, Braun's heating and ventilation sys
tem takes in the fumes from vehicles traveling
to and from the post office.
Considering the heavy traffic on this road, the
air conditioning system of Braun is regularly fed
with car fumes.
"It is not totally intolerable," Music Prof.
William Mahrt said in reference to the bad air.
But Mahrt added that the air has "a very
strong diesel smell . . . lots of people find it dif
ficult. They think it is going to ruin their health."
But according to Alain Decleve, director of
health and safety, the situation at the Music
Center "is not top priority in the list of toxic
exposure on campus" because the exposure to
fumes has not reached a dangerous level accord
ing to law. Decleve, however, said he strongly
believes that the ventilation problem needs sol
ving.
The ventilation problem "is a matter of com
fort," he said. "Those people have not chosen to
be exposed to fumes. Their choice is music."
According to Planting, the Music Department
hopes that modifications in traffic regulations,

which aim at lessening the traffic flow by Braun,
will solve the fumigation problem.
Bod Segar, a planner for the University's traffic
policy, said that there is a long-term plan for
restricting vehicle access to the post office and
the Bookstore with an electronic gate. Because
the policy requires meeting with representatives
from the different buildings affected by the new
traffic regualtions, Segar explained that the reg
ulations could not be implemented for two years.
"We hope to have a new gate system in two
years," he said. According to Segar, the new gate
system is part of an all campus plan for con
trolling trafffic. If the traffic problem at Braun
were to become a more pressing issue, then the
gates could be installed sooner, he said.
Air conditioning problems are not new to
Braun. Built in 1983, Braun had a partial air
conditioning system that was unsatisfactory. In
1985 a complete air conditioning system was
installed.
David Cooper, an engineer who directed the
project, said the"the air-balancing job" seemed
to have corrected problems with Braun's air con
ditioning. Apparently, the air conditioning did
work better after Cooper's repairs.
"It (the air conditioning) was much better than
three years ago," Judith Bettina, a voice teacher,
said. But Bettina added that there are still ir
ritating gas fumes in the air.
According to Cooper, the most recent com
plaints about Braun's air conditioning have not
been brought to his attention, so he has not
attempted any repairs.
"If there is a problem, there are solutions,"
Cooper added.
In a letter the Music Department sent to the
Provost Office over the summer, the gas fumes
are not mentioned as one of Braun's problems
needing money for repair.
Judi Chan, associate director at the Planning
Office, suggested that police officers limit traffic
behind the building by ticketing more. "This is
the quickest way to solve [the problem]," she said.
But for the present, the Music Department
plans to wait for the University to redirect or
limit the traffic on the road behind the post office.
