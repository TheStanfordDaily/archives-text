Sisters of Mercy — "Floodland"
Set your phasers on stun and
your stereo on bass — it's time
to explore "Floodland," the second
LP release from Sisters of Mercy.
The group's name may be mis
leading because this band is
hardly effeminate or forgiving.
Led by baritone vocalist/
songwriter Andrew Eldritch, the
group weaves an oblique and dark
tapestry in the vein of its splendid
debut album, "First and Last and
Always," which challenges the
mind with ornate imagery and the
stereo with rich bass tones.
For the masses who missed the
band's first outing, Sister of Mer
cy's music resembles the work of
post-punk powerhouse Siouxie
and the Banshees, but is really a
breed unto itself. The melodies

The melodies are at
times upbeat, at
times haunting, but
always punctuated
by deep and
resounding vocals.

are at times upbeat, at times
haunting, but always punctuated
by Eldritch's deep and resounding
vocals spouting a critical view of
life and love.
"Floodland" sets this tone at
the outset with the album's most
powerful cut, "Dominion/Mother
Russia." Backed by the majesty
of a full choral group, Eldritch
and company perform an an
thematic introspection-turned
manifesto that is simultaneously

infectious and awestriking.
This album has problems sep
arate from the issues it explores,
specifically the conclusion of side
one. "1959" is billed on the wrap
per as one of the featured hits,
but halfway through the first
stanza the listener realizes it is
more of a miss.
The bonus track "Torch,"
mercifully featured only on the
cassette and compact disc re
leases, is another weak effort.
However, with a quick push of
the fast-forward button, the prob
lem is immediately remedied and
this otherwise outstanding effort
remains unspoiled.
As should now be painfully ob
vious, Sisters of Mercy is not the
band for suicidal people or folks
enjoying their gilded cage. How
ever, for those willing to take the
plunge into the depths of the
"Floodlands," they will find them
selves pleasantly rewarded.
