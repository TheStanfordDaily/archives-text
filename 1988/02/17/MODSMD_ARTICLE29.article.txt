There are a few rules that everyone
should follow when dining at a Chinese
restaurant. I have outlined them here
for the dining impaired:
1. Don't bring along someone who is
studying Chinese. They will insist upon
trying to order in their broken first-year
Chinese, which will result in a major
breakdown in communication, and ul
timately a baked yak will be brought
to your table.
2. Don't order anything that is listed
on the menu with the phrase, "Order
at least one day in advance." That is a
big tip-off that the particular menu item
is flown in directly from Beijing in a
Federal Express Overnight Mailer at a

cost approximating that of a four
bedroom home.
3. Eat the meal with a fork. For some
bizarre reason it is considered socially
acceptable at a Chinese meal to reach
across onto someone else's plate and
remove large amounts of their food,
saying "I thought I'd try some of your
beef." Using a fork allows you to shovel
in your food faster and get to work on
your companion's plate of food, as well
as providing self-defense against anyone
trying to make a move on your meal.
Being an Experienced Chinese
Cuisine Diner, I had no problem eating
at King Chuan, which offers good, in
expensive Chinese food, conveniently
close to campus.
We tried the wonton soup, northern
style vegetables, sliced scallops with gar
lic sauce, almond chicken, twice cooked
pork and, as a control dish, beef with
broccoli.
Beef with Broccoli is like the most
basic dish you can order at a Chinese
restaurant, so it's a good portent of the

quality of the food. And let me tell you,
the Beef with Broccoli was delicious.
The beef was tender and lean, far better
than the undercooked fatty beef one
sometimes finds at Chinese restaurants.
Furthermore, the broccoli was well
cooked so it was still crunchy but not
tough, and the slices of broccoli were
small enough to fit conveniently in the
mouth.
The rest of the dishes were delicious
as well. Again, the pork was lean and
flavorful, and the chicken and seafood
were cooked perfectly. My only real
qualm was with the rice, which was a
little soft for my taste.
The prices are rock-bottom: Most
dishes are less than six bucks. (Except
seafood, but who eats seafood at a
Chinese restaurant?) The service is
great, and they've got a full compliment
of wine and beer. They're open for lunch
and dinner and have food to go if you
like to eat elsewhere. Cheap, close and
delicious.
