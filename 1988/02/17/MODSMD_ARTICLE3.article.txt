Senior Hoover Fellow Edward Teller's
misrepresentations about SDI research
have had serious implications for national
policy and have strained relations be
tween the federal government and the
academic community, some scientists and
politicians say.
According to some scientists at the
Lawrence Livermore National Labora
tory, Teller deliberately misled the
Reagan administration about the
feasibility of the Strategic Defense Initi
ative. Ray Kidder, a senior physicist
there, said Teller gave federal officials
advice about SDI that was "misleading
and unjustifiably optimistic."

When Roy Woodruff, former head of
nuclear weapons research at Livermore,
protested Teller's findings to UC-
Berkeley — which oversees Livermore
Labs — his letters were ignored.
According to U.S. Rep. George Brown,
D-Calif., such ignorance has national con
sequences. "By failing to act, these people
(Berkeley officials) have failed the
nation."
Brown has initiated an investigation
of the whole affair, and says its findings
will be released by the end of the month.
Central to the controversy is the issue
of the relevance and utility of the X-ray
laser to SDI and the substantial monetary
and ideological support the administra
tion has given it.
According to supporters of the project,
the X-ray laser is a "cornerstone" of the
SDI program. But some scientists and
political observers disagree.

Political Science Prof. David Bernstein
said the laser is at best "a shaky cor
nerstone." And in the Jan. 1986 Bulletin
of the Atomic Scientists, the editors called
the laser a "pet project of Edward Teller"
and said that it "now appears to be more
a figment of the imagination than even
the critics of Star Wars have supposed."
And even if the technology can be
developed, some scientists say, it would
be counterproductive.
Kidder said that if the X-ray laser is
found to work it would "probably signal
the end of SDI."
"The least demanding application of
the X-ray laser would be an anti-satellite
application that could, in Soviet hands,
be used to defeat SDI," he said.
Since even plans for non-space based
"Star Wars" technology depend on satel
lite capabilities, Bernstein said, laser
technology could effectively render such
plans useless.

Teller, who was unavailable for com
ment, would probably discount such
criticism from respected scientists, ac
cording to Hugh Dewitt, also a physicist
at Livermore. "Teller would never admit
to the ending of SDI by the success of
the X-ray laser," he said.
The Department of Energy also deflects
the criticism, saying its purpose in
researching laser technology is to "un
derstand the Soviet capability to design
and deploy similar weapons which would
put the U.S. strategic deterrent force or
a future defensive system at risk."
According to Josie Stein, Brown's press
representative on scientific issues, U.S.
work on the laser is based on a theory
developed in the Soviet Union, which was
published openly, which indicated that
at the time Soviet officials had not at
tached military significance to the X-ray
laser.
The assumption now, Stein said, is that

the Soviets are developing the laser for
defense purposes. This is one of the main
reasons the government continues to
spend millions on the premature tech
nology.
The misrepresentation of the laser re
search has also had impact on U.S.
foreign policy. According to Woodruff,
President Reagan went to the 1986 U.S.-
U.S.S.R. summit in Reykjavik armed with
erroneous advice from Teller.
The only advice to Reagan from Liver
more was through Teller, although Teller
was not in charge of the program or even
speaking as a lab employee, Woodruff
said.
The summit fell apart largely because
of Reagan's refusal to limit SDI testing
and his confidence that space weapons
could be deployed by the mid-19905. This
stance reflects optimism instilled by Tel
ler, which Woodruff and other Livermore
scientists assert is exaggerated
and premature.
Additionally, according to the
Jan. 1986 Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, "The need for contin
ued development and testing of
this nuclear-driven laser has been
used as an argument against a
comprehensive test-ban treaty."
U.S. Rep. Edward Markey, D-
Mass., also criticized the ad
ministration's testing of a "Star
Wars" weapon system and
claimed the weapons will not ul
timately be used as part of
Reagan's "nonnuclear" SDI. He
called the administration's justi
fication for testing "a
smokescreen the Pentagon and
the weapons labs have developed
to try to defuse the growing public
clamor for a test ban."
In his May 1986 report con
cerning a test ban proposal,
Markey also wrote that opponents
of the administration's SDI pro
gram are at an inherent disad
vantage when giving policy advice.

The testimony of administra
tion and national laboratory wit
nesses is received well by
policy-makers responsible for de
ciding on nuclear systems, accord
ing to Markey. "Their assertions
are uncritically accepted without
any attempts to correct for the
obvious element of career and in
stitutional bias involved in their
testimony," he wrote.
In contrast, Markey wrote, out
side witnesses withstand close
scrutiny — an assertion that
echoes Woodruffs claims.
In addition, the X-ray laser af
fair "illustrates the political use
and abuse of the secrecy system,"
according to the Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists of Jan. 1986.
In an article in the same issue,
Dane Archer — a professor at UC-
Santa Cruz — noted that labora
tories are dependent on
"identification, development and
testing of new weapons systems"
for their funding and preserva
tion. "Although secrecy usually
conceals this vested interest,
recent disclosures on the X-ray
laser reveal how overwhelming
fiscal self-interest taints scientific
objectivity and biases judgement,"

he wrote.
The editors concurred, pointing
out that that after a March 1985
X-ray laser test, "the flaws in the
X-ray laser tests were well hidden
by the government's secrecy sys
tem." Only the "right" informa
tion was freely leaked by
proponents of SDI and the laser
in order to support the program
and influence funding decisions.
The silence of Roger Batzel
(head of Livermore Labs), Teller
and other key players in this con
troversy has impeded the "quest
for objective truth," as Kane put
it.
Stein agreed, adding, "There is
no way to find out exactly what
was told to anyone."
In addition to its national and
international implications, the
case has also aroused concern
about the policies of officials at
Berkeley and Livermore Labs.
Woodruff sent Berkeley officials
numerous letters decrying
Teller's alleged misrepresenta
tions. He eventually resigned over
the incident in 1985.
According to Jim Kane,
Berkeley's liaison with Livermore,
the personnel turmoil had "noth

ing to do with the misrepresen
tation" and"the grievance was
resolved."
Yet to be resolved, however, are
the questions of why actions were
taken and how the laboratory and
the government should properly
interact. In his letter last month
to Brown, Kidder wrote, "It is sad
indeed when scientific integrity at
a National Scientific Laboratory
is stifled in favor of politically
motivated exaggeration, mis
representation and hype."
In the Dec. 10, 1987 Congres
sional Record, Brown wrote,
"Beyond the question of scientific
integrity is the question of
credible and timely information
for the purpose of sound policy
making."
Brown said he initiated the in
vestigation into the situation be
cause "the very future of our
society depends upon the availa
bility of adequate and accurate
information to policymakers."
The investigation is being con
ducted by the General Accounting
Office.
In March and April of last year,

the DOE conducted a private in
vestigation of the affair, headed
by two high level executives in
the defense industry. The full text
of their findings, however, was
not published and remains clas
sified.
But last October, Under
secretary of Energy Joseph Sal
gado issued a one-sentence
statement concerning the investi
gation and the allegations at
Livermore: "There was no
misrepresentation to officials of
the U.S. government concerning
the X-ray laser program at the
Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory."
Brown, in his proposal for the
GAO investigation, called this in
vestigation "cursory" and ques
tioned why the DOE failed to
release the full report.
The main problem of the affair
— technical integrity — raised
first by Woodruff and now echoed
by Kidder and other scientists,
was emphasized by Woodruff in
a Nov. 5 letter to UC President
David Gardener. "The problem
remains with us today," Woodruff
wrote.

fication for testing "a
smokescreen the Pentagon and
the weapons labs have developed
to try to defuse the growing public
clamor for a test ban."
In his May 1986 report con
cerning a test ban proposal,
Markey also wrote that opponents
of the administration's SDI pro
gram are at an inherent disad
vantage when giving policy advice.

The testimony of administra
tion and national laboratory wit
nesses is received well by
policy-makers responsible for de
ciding on nuclear systems, accord
ing to Markey. "Their assertions
are uncritically accepted without
any attempts to correct for the
obvious element of career and in
stitutional bias involved in their
testimony," he wrote.
In contrast, Markey wrote, out
side witnesses withstand close
scrutiny — an assertion that
echoes Woodruffs claims.
In addition, the X-ray laser af
fair "illustrates the political use
and abuse of the secrecy system,"
according to the Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists of Jan. 1986.
In an article in the same issue,
Dane Archer — a professor at UC-
Santa Cruz — noted that labora
tories are dependent on
"identification, development and
testing of new weapons systems"
for their funding and preserva
tion. "Although secrecy usually
conceals this vested interest,
recent disclosures on the X-ray
laser reveal how overwhelming
fiscal self-interest taints scientific
objectivity and biases judgement,"

he wrote.
The editors concurred, pointing
out that that after a March 1985
X-ray laser test, "the flaws in the
X-ray laser tests were well hidden
by the government's secrecy sys
tem." Only the "right" informa

proponents of SDI and the laser
in order to support the program
and influence funding decisions.
The silence of Roger Batzel
(head of Livermore Labs), Teller
and other key players in this con
troversy has impeded the "quest
for objective truth," as Kane put
it.
Stein agreed, adding, "There is
no way to find out exactly what
was told to anyone."
In addition to its national and
international implications, the
case has also aroused concern
about the policies of officials at
Berkeley and Livermore Labs.
Woodruff sent Berkeley officials
numerous letters decrying
Teller's alleged misrepresenta
tions. He eventually resigned over
the incident in 1985.
According to Jim Kane,
Berkeley's liaison with Livermore,
the personnel turmoil had "noth

ing to do with the misrepresen
tation" and"the grievance was
resolved."
Yet to be resolved, however, are
the questions of why actions were
taken and how the laboratory and
the government should properly
interact. In his letter last month
to Brown, Kidder wrote, "It is sad
indeed when scientific integrity at
a National Scientific Laboratory
is stifled in favor of politically
motivated exaggeration, mis
representation and hype."
In the Dec. 10, 1987 Congres
sional Record, Brown wrote,
"Beyond the question of scientific
integrity is the question of
credible and timely information
for the purpose of sound policy
making."
Brown said he initiated the in
vestigation into the situation be
cause "the very future of our
society depends upon the availa
bility of adequate and accurate
information to policymakers."
The investigation is being con
ducted by the General Accounting
Office.
In March and April of last year,

the DOE conducted a private in
vestigation of the affair, headed
by two high level executives in
the defense industry. The full text
of their findings, however, was
not published and remains clas
sified.
But last October, Under
secretary of Energy Joseph Sal

statement concerning the investi

Livermore: "There was no
misrepresentation to officials of
the U.S. government concerning
the X-ray laser program at the
Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory."
Brown, in his proposal for the
GAO investigation, called this in

release the full report.
The main problem of the affair

Senior Hoover Fellow Edward Teller's
misrepresentations about SDI research
have had serious implications for national
policy and have strained relations be
tween the federal government and the
academic community, some scientists and
politicians say.
According to some scientists at the
Lawrence Livermore National Labora
tory, Teller deliberately misled the
Reagan administration about the
feasibility of the Strategic Defense Initi
ative. Ray Kidder, a senior physicist
there, said Teller gave federal officials
advice about SDI that was "misleading
and unjustifiably optimistic."

When Roy Woodruff, former head of
nuclear weapons research at Livermore,
protested Teller's findings to UC-
Berkeley — which oversees Livermore
Labs — his letters were ignored.
According to U.S. Rep. George Brown,
D-Calif., such ignorance has national con
sequences. "By failing to act, these people
(Berkeley officials) have failed the
nation."
Brown has initiated an investigation
of the whole affair, and says its findings
will be released by the end of the month.
Central to the controversy is the issue
of the relevance and utility of the X-ray
laser to SDI and the substantial monetary
and ideological support the administra
tion has given it.
According to supporters of the project,
the X-ray laser is a "cornerstone" of the
SDI program. But some scientists and
political observers disagree.

Political Science Prof. David Bernstein
said the laser is at best "a shaky cor
nerstone." And in the Jan. 1986 Bulletin
of the Atomic Scientists, the editors called
the laser a "pet project of Edward Teller"
and said that it "now appears to be more
a figment of the imagination than even
the critics of Star Wars have supposed."
And even if the technology can be
developed, some scientists say, it would
be counterproductive.
Kidder said that if the X-ray laser is
found to work it would "probably signal
the end of SDI."
"The least demanding application of
the X-ray laser would be an anti-satellite
application that could, in Soviet hands,
be used to defeat SDI," he said.
Since even plans for non-space based
"Star Wars" technology depend on satel
lite capabilities, Bernstein said, laser
technology could effectively render such
plans useless.

Teller, who was unavailable for com
ment, would probably discount such
criticism from respected scientists, ac
cording to Hugh Dewitt, also a physicist
at Livermore. "Teller would never admit
to the ending of SDI by the success of
the X-ray laser," he said.
The Department of Energy also deflects
the criticism, saying its purpose in
researching laser technology is to "un
derstand the Soviet capability to design
and deploy similar weapons which would
put the U.S. strategic deterrent force or
a future defensive system at risk."
According to Josie Stein, Brown's press
representative on scientific issues, U.S.
work on the laser is based on a theory
developed in the Soviet Union, which was
published openly, which indicated that
at the time Soviet officials had not at
tached military significance to the X-ray
laser.
The assumption now, Stein said, is that

the Soviets are developing the laser for
defense purposes. This is one of the main
reasons the government continues to
spend millions on the premature tech
nology.
The misrepresentation of the laser re
search has also had impact on U.S.
foreign policy. According to Woodruff,
President Reagan went to the 1986 U.S.-
U.S.S.R. summit in Reykjavik armed with
erroneous advice from Teller.
The only advice to Reagan from Liver
more was through Teller, although Teller
was not in charge of the program or even
speaking as a lab employee, Woodruff
said.
The summit fell apart largely because
of Reagan's refusal to limit SDI testing
and his confidence that space weapons
could be deployed by the mid-19905. This
stance reflects optimism instilled by Tel
ler, which Woodruff and other Livermore
scientists assert is exaggerated
and premature.
Additionally, according to the
Jan. 1986 Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, "The need for contin
ued development and testing of
this nuclear-driven laser has been
used as an argument against a
comprehensive test-ban treaty."
U.S. Rep. Edward Markey, D-
Mass., also criticized the ad
ministration's testing of a "Star
Wars" weapon system and
claimed the weapons will not ul
timately be used as part of
Reagan's "nonnuclear" SDI. He
called the administration's justi
fication for testing "a
smokescreen the Pentagon and
the weapons labs have developed
to try to defuse the growing public
clamor for a test ban."
In his May 1986 report con
cerning a test ban proposal,
Markey also wrote that opponents
of the administration's SDI pro
gram are at an inherent disad

have had serious implications for national
policy and have strained relations be
tween the federal government and the
academic community, some scientists and
politicians say.
According to some scientists at the
Lawrence Livermore National Labora
tory, Teller deliberately misled the
Reagan administration about the
feasibility of the Strategic Defense Initi
ative. Ray Kidder, a senior physicist
there, said Teller gave federal officials
advice about SDI that was "misleading
and unjustifiably optimistic."

When Roy Woodruff, former head of
nuclear weapons research at Livermore,
protested Teller's findings to UC-
Berkeley — which oversees Livermore
Labs — his letters were ignored.
According to U.S. Rep. George Brown,
D-Calif., such ignorance has national con
sequences. "By failing to act, these people
(Berkeley officials) have failed the
nation."
Brown has initiated an investigation
of the whole affair, and says its findings
will be released by the end of the month.
Central to the controversy is the issue
of the relevance and utility of the X-ray
laser to SDI and the substantial monetary
and ideological support the administra
tion has given it.
According to supporters of the project,
the X-ray laser is a "cornerstone" of the
SDI program. But some scientists and
political observers disagree.

Political Science Prof. David Bernstein
said the laser is at best "a shaky cor
nerstone." And in the Jan. 1986 Bulletin
of the Atomic Scientists, the editors called
the laser a "pet project of Edward Teller"
and said that it "now appears to be more
a figment of the imagination than even
the critics of Star Wars have supposed."
And even if the technology can be
developed, some scientists say, it would
be counterproductive.
Kidder said that if the X-ray laser is
found to work it would "probably signal
the end of SDI."
"The least demanding application of
the X-ray laser would be an anti-satellite
application that could, in Soviet hands,
be used to defeat SDI," he said.
Since even plans for non-space based
"Star Wars" technology depend on satel
lite capabilities, Bernstein said, laser
technology could effectively render such
plans useless.

Teller, who was unavailable for com
ment, would probably discount such
criticism from respected scientists, ac
cording to Hugh Dewitt, also a physicist
at Livermore. "Teller would never admit
to the ending of SDI by the success of
the X-ray laser," he said.
The Department of Energy also deflects
the criticism, saying its purpose in
researching laser technology is to "un
derstand the Soviet capability to design
and deploy similar weapons which would
put the U.S. strategic deterrent force or
a future defensive system at risk."
According to Josie Stein, Brown's press
representative on scientific issues, U.S.
work on the laser is based on a theory
developed in the Soviet Union, which was
published openly, which indicated that
at the time Soviet officials had not at
tached military significance to the X-ray
laser.
The assumption now, Stein said, is that

the Soviets are developing the laser for
defense purposes. This is one of the main
reasons the government continues to
spend millions on the premature tech
nology.
The misrepresentation of the laser re
search has also had impact on U.S.
foreign policy. According to Woodruff,
President Reagan went to the 1986 U.S.-
U.S.S.R. summit in Reykjavik armed with
erroneous advice from Teller.
The only advice to Reagan from Liver
more was through Teller, although Teller
was not in charge of the program or even
speaking as a lab employee, Woodruff
said.
The summit fell apart largely because
of Reagan's refusal to limit SDI testing
and his confidence that space weapons
could be deployed by the mid-19905. This
stance reflects optimism instilled by Tel
ler, which Woodruff and other Livermore
scientists assert is exaggerated
and premature.
Additionally, according to the
Jan. 1986 Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, "The need for contin
ued development and testing of
this nuclear-driven laser has been
used as an argument against a
comprehensive test-ban treaty."
U.S. Rep. Edward Markey, D-
Mass., also criticized the ad
ministration's testing of a "Star
Wars" weapon system and
claimed the weapons will not ul
timately be used as part of
Reagan's "nonnuclear" SDI. He
called the administration's justi
fication for testing "a
smokescreen the Pentagon and
the weapons labs have developed
to try to defuse the growing public
clamor for a test ban."
In his May 1986 report con
cerning a test ban proposal,
Markey also wrote that opponents
of the administration's SDI pro
gram are at an inherent disad
vantage when giving policy advice.

The testimony of administra
tion and national laboratory wit
nesses is received well by
policy-makers responsible for de
ciding on nuclear systems, accord
ing to Markey. "Their assertions
are uncritically accepted without
any attempts to correct for the
obvious element of career and in
stitutional bias involved in their
testimony," he wrote.
In contrast, Markey wrote, out
side witnesses withstand close
scrutiny — an assertion that
echoes Woodruffs claims.
In addition, the X-ray laser af
fair "illustrates the political use
and abuse of the secrecy system,"
according to the Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists of Jan. 1986.
In an article in the same issue,
Dane Archer — a professor at UC-
Santa Cruz — noted that labora
tories are dependent on
"identification, development and
testing of new weapons systems"
for their funding and preserva
tion. "Although secrecy usually
conceals this vested interest,
recent disclosures on the X-ray
laser reveal how overwhelming
fiscal self-interest taints scientific
objectivity and biases judgement,"

he wrote.
The editors concurred, pointing
out that that after a March 1985
X-ray laser test, "the flaws in the
X-ray laser tests were well hidden
by the government's secrecy sys
tem." Only the "right" informa
tion was freely leaked by
proponents of SDI and the laser
in order to support the program
and influence funding decisions.
The silence of Roger Batzel
(head of Livermore Labs), Teller
and other key players in this con
troversy has impeded the "quest
for objective truth," as Kane put
it.
Stein agreed, adding, "There is
no way to find out exactly what
was told to anyone."
In addition to its national and
international implications, the
case has also aroused concern
about the policies of officials at
Berkeley and Livermore Labs.
Woodruff sent Berkeley officials
numerous letters decrying
Teller's alleged misrepresenta
tions. He eventually resigned over
the incident in 1985.
According to Jim Kane,
Berkeley's liaison with Livermore,
the personnel turmoil had "noth

ing to do with the misrepresen
tation" and"the grievance was
resolved."
Yet to be resolved, however, are
the questions of why actions were
taken and how the laboratory and
the government should properly
interact. In his letter last month
to Brown, Kidder wrote, "It is sad
indeed when scientific integrity at
a National Scientific Laboratory
is stifled in favor of politically
motivated exaggeration, mis
representation and hype."
In the Dec. 10, 1987 Congres
sional Record, Brown wrote,
"Beyond the question of scientific
integrity is the question of
credible and timely information
for the purpose of sound policy
making."
Brown said he initiated the in
vestigation into the situation be
cause "the very future of our
society depends upon the availa
bility of adequate and accurate
information to policymakers."
The investigation is being con
ducted by the General Accounting
Office.
In March and April of last year,

the DOE conducted a private in
vestigation of the affair, headed
by two high level executives in
the defense industry. The full text
of their findings, however, was
not published and remains clas
sified.
But last October, Under
secretary of Energy Joseph Sal
gado issued a one-sentence
statement concerning the investi
gation and the allegations at
Livermore: "There was no
misrepresentation to officials of
the U.S. government concerning
the X-ray laser program at the
Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory."
Brown, in his proposal for the
GAO investigation, called this in
vestigation "cursory" and ques
tioned why the DOE failed to
release the full report.
The main problem of the affair
— technical integrity — raised
first by Woodruff and now echoed
by Kidder and other scientists,
was emphasized by Woodruff in
a Nov. 5 letter to UC President
David Gardener. "The problem
remains with us today," Woodruff
wrote.
