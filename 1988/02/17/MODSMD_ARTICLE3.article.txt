Senior Hoover Fellow Edward Teller's
misrepresentations about SDI research
have had serious implications for national
policy and have strained relations be
tween the federal government and the
academic community, some scientists and
politicians say.
According to some scientists at the
Lawrence Livermore National Labora
tory, Teller deliberately misled the
Reagan administration about the
feasibility of the Strategic Defense Initi
ative. Ray Kidder, a senior physicist
there, said Teller gave federal officials
advice about SDI that was "misleading
and unjustifiably optimistic."

When Roy Woodruff, former head of
nuclear weapons research at Livermore,
protested Teller's findings to UC-
Berkeley — which oversees Livermore
Labs — his letters were ignored.
According to U.S. Rep. George Brown,
D-Calif., such ignorance has national con
sequences. "By failing to act, these people
(Berkeley officials) have failed the
nation."
Brown has initiated an investigation
of the whole affair, and says its findings
will be released by the end of the month.
Central to the controversy is the issue
of the relevance and utility of the X-ray
laser to SDI and the substantial monetary
and ideological support the administra
tion has given it.
According to supporters of the project,
the X-ray laser is a "cornerstone" of the
SDI program. But some scientists and
political observers disagree.

Political Science Prof. David Bernstein
said the laser is at best "a shaky cor
nerstone." And in the Jan. 1986 Bulletin
of the Atomic Scientists, the editors called
the laser a "pet project of Edward Teller"
and said that it "now appears to be more
a figment of the imagination than even
the critics of Star Wars have supposed."
And even if the technology can be
developed, some scientists say, it would
be counterproductive.
Kidder said that if the X-ray laser is
found to work it would "probably signal
the end of SDI."
"The least demanding application of
the X-ray laser would be an anti-satellite
application that could, in Soviet hands,
be used to defeat SDI," he said.
Since even plans for non-space based
"Star Wars" technology depend on satel
lite capabilities, Bernstein said, laser
technology could effectively render such
plans useless.

Teller, who was unavailable for com
ment, would probably discount such
criticism from respected scientists, ac
cording to Hugh Dewitt, also a physicist
at Livermore. "Teller would never admit
to the ending of SDI by the success of
the X-ray laser," he said.
The Department of Energy also deflects
the criticism, saying its purpose in
researching laser technology is to "un
derstand the Soviet capability to design
and deploy similar weapons which would
put the U.S. strategic deterrent force or
a future defensive system at risk."
According to Josie Stein, Brown's press
representative on scientific issues, U.S.
work on the laser is based on a theory
developed in the Soviet Union, which was
published openly, which indicated that
at the time Soviet officials had not at
tached military significance to the X-ray
laser.
The assumption now, Stein said, is that

the Soviets are developing the laser for
defense purposes. This is one of the main
reasons the government continues to
spend millions on the premature tech
nology.
The misrepresentation of the laser re
search has also had impact on U.S.
foreign policy. According to Woodruff,
President Reagan went to the 1986 U.S.-
U.S.S.R. summit in Reykjavik armed with
erroneous advice from Teller.
The only advice to Reagan from Liver
more was through Teller, although Teller
was not in charge of the program or even
speaking as a lab employee, Woodruff
said.
The summit fell apart largely because
of Reagan's refusal to limit SDI testing
and his confidence that space weapons
could be deployed by the mid-19905. This
stance reflects optimism instilled by Tel
ler, which Woodruff and other Livermore
