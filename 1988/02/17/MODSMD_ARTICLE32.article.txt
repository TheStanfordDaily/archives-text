## ABC spells BAD 
### 
Well, it's Winter Olympics
time, and if you're like me,
you're spending a good three
hours a weeknight and at least
twice that on weekends watch
ing the Games.
Unfortunately, ABC is doing
the coverage.

This wouldn't be so bad if
the network made better use
of its talent. The two Als (Mic
haels and Trautwig) are two of
the better commentators in the
business, and Michaels is, of
course, a natural for hockey.
("Do you believe in miracles?
Yes!")
Trautwig, however, is stuck
with alpine skiing — a great
sport, but not the spot for
Trautwig, a good, hard-hitting
journalist who is not afraid to
give criticism where it is due.
Trautwig is best in the studio
and conducting interviews, but
his airtime at the Games has
been limited to incisive com
ments such as "Boy, is he going
fast, Bob!"
Meanwhile, ABC has dusted
off Jim McKay for the Olym
pics and plonked him back in
the studio. He's worse than
ever. He stumbles over words,
he doesn't seem sure of what
he's saying, and he looks dis
tracted. I heard someone
describe McKay as "doddering"
the other night, and that
doesn't sound too far off.
On top of those fundamental
on-air problems, McKay con
tinues his age-old habit of over
sentimentalizing and over
dramatizing everything. The
man is a geyser of hyperbole.
Every event is the most impor
tant, most exciting occurance
ever in history. Every athlete
is heroic, and a darned nice
person too, with a wonderful
family life in an idyllic town.
This kind of unfettered

praise and sentiment is fine for
those fluffy little features ABC
is running on just about every
athlete in Calgary, and, in fact,
that's exactly the job best
suited for McKay — really, the
only one.
The worst place to put some
one who over-sentimentalizes
everything is near a real-life
tragedy. U.S. speed skater Dan
Jansen's sister died of leu
kemia Sunday morning, and
later that afternoon, Jansen
first false started and then fell
in the 500-meter race — in
which he was favored.
McKay, of course, turned the
event into a for
sentimentality. "What a
tragedy," he repeated endless
ly. "The Olympics represent
the way we would like the
world to be," he philosophized,
"but they also represent the
way the world really is." Oh.
Then, of course, there are
the times McKay tries to speak
directly to the audience. This
is always a complete failure be
cause of his hesitant, stilted
delivery, but McKay persists
anyway. Monday night, faced
with showing either live U.S.
hockey action or taped down
hill skiing, McKay asked us,
"Which would you like to see?
I think alpine skiing, don't
you?" Nice try Jim, but I think
millions of hockey fans were
chucking their beer cans at the
set over the choice of taped
skiing.
When it did show hockey, in
its anxiousness to get in com
mercials, ABC managed to miss
not one but two of the U.S.
goals against Czechoslovakia.
Good timing — but hey, at least
we got those features in, right?
At least Michaels is doing
hockey; he's a wonderful an
nouncer. And in general, ABC
has done a competent job of
covering the various events —
it's a pretty tough job to handle
so much in so little time. But
the network could improve its
broadcasts immeasurably by
doing one little thing:
Banish syrupy Jim McKay to
player profile-land and get the
informative and entertaining
Trautwig off the slopes and
into the studio.
