### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
Jeff Tarango was just a smidgen bet
ter than Patrick McEnroe yesterday
at Stanford Tennis Stadium, but that
little extra something was good
enough to catapult him to the
Hobee's Northern California Inter
collegate Tennis Championship and

secure his No. 1 spot on the Stanford men's tennis
team singles ladder.
In a battle between two of the nation's titans,
Tarango, ranked 19th nationally, edged McEnroe,
currently 12th, 6-2, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5). Rebounding from
a 4-2 deficit in the third-set tiebreaker, the Cardinal
sophomore won the final three points of the two
hour, 35-minute match.
Tarango was the tournament's second seed and
McEnroe was the top seed. To reach the final match,
Tarango defeated California's Woody Hunt 6-2, 6-4
in one semifinal Monday, while McEnroe upended
the Cardinal's Martin Blackman 7-5, 6-4 in the
other semifinal match.
"I think the guys are legitimately that even,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said. "This match means
that when we go to the indoors (National Indoor
Team Championships today through Sunday), Jeff
will play No. 1, and Patrick No. 2. That's what
this match means. This may change in four days
or four weeks or not at all."
Both players each had one bad set and one good

one. Tarango dominated a sluggish McEnroe in the
first set, while McEnroe returned the favor in the
second. Throughout the first two sets, neither
Tarango nor McEnroe could consistently hold their
serve.
"I think in the first set I kind of overpowered
him," Tarango said. "In the second set, he jumped
on me like I did to him when the match started."
But during crunch time in the third set, each
player pulled out all the stops. Tarango was getting
excellent depth on his groundstrokes, while
McEnroe repeatedly passed his teammate at the
net. McEnroe, down two match points at 4-5, rallied
to knot the match at 5-5 as each player held serve
for the entire set.
In the tiebreaker, the see-saw battle continued.
Tarango shot out to a 2-0 lead only to see McEnroe
claw back to take a 4-2 advantage. Ultimately, put
ting pressure on his teammate finally paid off for
Tarango as he forced three straight errant McEnroe
shots to clinch the victory.
"In the third set, we both hit out," Tarango said.
"There was a lot of pressure out there. It came
down to who was going to win the big points in
the breaker."
