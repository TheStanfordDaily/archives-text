# Golf tries to pick up slack
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
While the Stanford
women's golf team
is struggling in the
team standings,
freshman Jodi
Figley is proving
her preseason rat-

ing as the No. 2 recruit in the
country.
Her 73 yesterday moved her up
into eighth place with a two-day
total of 149, only four strokes out
of the individual lead. With a solid
final round today, she will have
finished in the top 10 in all four
collegiate tournaments in which
she has played.
"I could've putted better," she
said, "but I'm pleased with where
I am."
The team, however, was unable
to improve upon its current 12th
place standing even though they

lowered their score by four
strokes yesterday. Their total of
638 is two strokes behind Brig
ham Young.
Texas appears to be pulling
away from the rest of the field
with a solid 594. U.S. Interna
tional is a full seven strokes back
in second, with five teams within
three strokes of them: New
Mexico and San Diego State at
603, and New Mexico State, USC,
and the Arizona "A" team at 604.
While the Cardinal appears to
be making a poor showing,
Baldwin in fact is pleased with
his team's play. Without the serv
ices of senior Kay Cornelius, each
of the four remaining players'
scores automatically counts
towards the team score.
"It's disappointing (to lose Cor
nelius)," said Baldwin. "We're
seeing just how well each of (the
other four players) can play."
Each of the other 14 teams can

discard its highest scorer. Cor
nelius, a preseason All-American,
was certain to count among the
top four, and consequently her
absence has put added pressure
on the remaining players.
The other players have
responded well. Sophomore
Stephanie Parel (80-81) was the
only player not to lower her score
yesterday. Figley dropped hers by
three strokes, while freshmen
Michele Lyford (83-82) and Kris
tin Ryan (82-81) each lowered
theirs by one.
Figley's eighth-place standing is
very strong, with numerous
Ereseason All-Americans playing,
lartina Koch of Arizona is tied
with her, and three players, Sue
Ginter of Texas, USC's Tracy
Nakamura and USIU's Susan
Shapcott are all one stroke ahead.
Nakamura finished second at last
fall's Stanford Intercollegiate.
