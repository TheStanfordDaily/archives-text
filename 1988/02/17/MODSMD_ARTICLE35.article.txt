# Baseball plunks Hayward, 12-6
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
It was a long time
between pitching
appearances for
Robbie Kamer
schen.
The last time he
pitched for Stan-

ford was Feb. 16, 1987, when he
was a freshman. He went two
thirds of an inning against Fresno
State, giving up two runs, one hit
and four walks and striking out
one.
He didn't take the mound again
until yesterday — exactly one year
later. But this time he fared much
better, going IVz and giving up
two runs on nine hits to chalk up
his first collegiate win as the Car
dinal collected 12 hits and bashed
Hayward State 12-6 at Sunken
Diamond.
The win improves the up-and
down Cardinal's record to 6-5,
while the Pioneers drop to 1-7 on
the year. Stanford takes the field
at Sunken Diamond again today
for a 2 p.m. game against USF.
Kamerschen was scheduled to
split the pitching duties yester
day, but "I got my chance a little
earlier than I expected," he said.
Cardinal starter Jim Price was
in trouble right away, surrender
ing three straight singles to load
the bases with one out in the top
of the first. Price got another out,

then gave up another single to
make the score 4-0 with two outs.
Kamerschen came on and
struck out Matt Knudson to end
the inning without further ado.
Strikeouts are nothing new to
Kamerschen. During his senior
year at Clarke Central High
School in Athens, Ga., he whiffed
162 batters in 71 innings.
Kamerschen was 10-0 that year
with an otherworldly 0.49 earned
run average.
But everything changed when
he came to Stanford. He found
he had to adjust to a new caliber
of competition.
"They don't play baseball in
Georgia like they do in Califor
nia," he said. "Coming out of high
school, everybody thinks they can
strike out the world, and I was
certainly one of those people."
It didn't help that Kamerschen,
also an all-state quarterback in
Georgia, was on the Stanford foot
ball team in the fall of his fresh
man year. "I came out really late
for baseball," he said.
Then, near the beginning of last
season, he underwent a hernia
operation that effectively
sidelined him for the year. "It was
really frustrating," he said. "But
I came back this year, and
thought I had a chance to play."
Kamerschen had warmed up in
the bullpen innumerable times
during the Cardinal's first 10
games of the season, but finally

got his chance yesterday.
"I felt really good about my per
formance," he said. "I feel that,
if given the opportunity on a con
sistent basis, I can throw effec
tively."
Junior Eric DeGraw also pro

vided an unexpected source of
help yesterday. Making only his
second start of the year in center
field after getting 12 at-bats last
year, DeGraw was two-for-two
with a double, a walk, four RBI
and two runs scored.

Frank Carey went 2-for-4 with a walk, a stolen base and two runs
scored in the leadoff spot yesterday.
