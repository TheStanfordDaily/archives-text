# Prize recruit Milburn reverses field
## 
### Cameron Macky Staff writer 
One of the Stanford football team's prize
recruiting catches has gotten away. Tailback
Glyn Milburn, considered by many to be the
crown jewel of this season's recruiting class,
has reversed his decision to come to Stanford
in the fall, opting instead to spend his col
legiate career at Oklahoma.
Milburn had signed a national letter-of
intent to matriculate at Stanford on the first
day recruits were permitted to sign with col
leges, Feb. 10. Stanford announced that he
had made the decision to play football for the
Cardinal, turning down offers from Oklahoma
and Notre Dame. However, because Milburn
has not yet turned 18, the letter was not valid
without the signature of one of his parents.
The letter was never co-signed. Two days
after making his choice, the 5-foot-9, 170-
pound tailback reversed his field, signing a

binding letter to attend Oklahoma.
A Stanford Athletic Department statement
released late yesterday offered no clear reasons
for the switch, but implied that Milburn's
stepfather might have pressured the star into
changing his mind.
"Milburn willingly signed a letter of intent
to attend Stanford," the statement read. "It
was clear, however, that the stepfather
(Robert Hammock) was not happy with that
decision."
Milburn, a Second-Team USA Today Ail-
American, refuted the view that his parents
had pressured him, saying instead that he
had merely needed enough time to sort out
his thoughts.
"Between Wednesday and Friday, my par
ents made it clear that I should explore all
the options open to me," Milburn said in a
telephone interview last night. "I think Stan
ford has an excellent program, but Oklahoma
is what's best for Glyn Milburn," he contin

ued, adding that his parents had not been in
favor of any one institution.
When asked why his parents had not given
him their advice before he signed the Stanford
letter, Milburn said, "There was a lack of
communication here . . . there was a lot of
pressure coming on me from all areas. I think
my parents look out for what's best for me,"
he added, eventually terming his Stanford
signing "a hasty decision."
When asked if there had been excessive
pressure on Milburn to sign, Stanford Recruit
ing Coordinator Dick James had no comment,
although he echoed the Athletic Department
statement by saying ''We wish Glyn well, he's
a super athlete and he's got a terrific future
ahead of him."
Milburn also viewed the parting with no
animosity. "I really respect Stanford," he said.
"It's a great university and they've got a great
program, but I feel I made the right decision.
Of course, only time will tell."
