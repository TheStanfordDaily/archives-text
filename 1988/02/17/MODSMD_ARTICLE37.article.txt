Filling an 8-month-old void in the Stanford Ath
letic Department, Cheryl Levick was named asso
ciate director of athletics and primary women's
administrator, effective May 9.
Levick, 36, was appointed by Stanford Athletic
Director Andy Geiger. An assistant commissioner

of the Pacific 10 Conference since
April, 1986, Levick is succeeding Pam
Strathairn, who died last June.
"(Strathairn) was a strong leader
and mentor for many of us," Levick
said. "Although I will have different
responsibilities within this reor
ganized position, I feel honored to
follow in her path."
Supervising over half of Stanford's
29 intercollegiate varsity sports will

be only part of Levick's tasks. In addition, she will
oversee academic advising, summer programs, the
dance division and the office of financial aid and
student affairs.
"She is a proven administrator on every level
imaginable," Geiger said, "and obviously familiar
with conference procedures as well as the Stanford
athletic program."
Before taking her job with the Pac-10, Levick
was employed at the NCAA office in Mission, Kan.
As the asst. director of women's programs, she was
a driving force.
