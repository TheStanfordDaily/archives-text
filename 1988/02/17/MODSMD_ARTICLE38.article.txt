Playing in the
shadow of a
major tourna
ment like the
Hobee's NorCal
Intercollegiate
would be dis-

heartening for most teams, but
not for the Stanford women's
tennis team. Finishing its dual
match well before the conclu
sion of Jeff Tarango vs. Patrick
McEnroe, the No. 1 Cardinal
easily disposed of San Jose State
in a 9-0 sweep.
In fact, it was almost too easy.
Stanford only gave up six games
in singles and four in doubles.
Moreover, all six singles
matches were finished in less
than an hour, some in half-an

hour.
"This match was the make-up
of a rain-out from a couple
weeks ago, back when we used
to have rain around here," Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan said.
"We played it off today, which
is a little unfortunate because
we're trying to get ready for a
big match on Friday and Sat
urday.
"It was better than a prac
tice," he added. "With this
(Tarango-McEnroe) match
going on, we probably couldn't
do much else in the way of prac
tice anyway. All in all, it worked
out pretty well."
Pretty well is a modest as
sessment. The Cardinal out
gunned the Spartans through
out the contest, giving the Stan
ford faithful little to fret over.
Freshman Tami Whitlinger

had little trouble with SJSU ace
Kelly Ryan, winning the No. 1
match 6-0, 6-0. The No. 2 con
test was also no contest, with
sophomore Lisa Green blowing
past Pat Vultee 6-0, 6-1.
The No. 1 doubles was the
highlight of the afternoon.
Hagey-Birch handily defeated
Ryan-Glass by a comfortable 6-
1,6-1 margin with an aggressive
and polished style of play,
showing that they belong in the
No. 1 spot over the top-rated
team of Whitlinger-Whitlinger.
"We had a challenge match
on Monday for that No. 1 spot,"
Brennan said. "In my mind they
were pretty equal, I couldn't
decide who should be one and
who should be two, so we let
them play it out. Hagey and
Birch won 6-4 in the third set.
