# Originator says core list purpose misunderstood
## 
### Jennifer Jenkins Staff writer 
Like the albatross that hung
from the Ancient Mariner's neck,
the Western culture core reading
list hovers over Philosophy Prof.
John Perry.
When the Faculty Senate
decided to implement a Western
Culture program in 1976, Perry
was a member of the first task
force that formulated the program
from 1976 to 1978, and chair of
the core list committee from 1978
to 1980.

According to Perry, the pur
poses of the first Western Culture
Task Force have been skewed and
misunderstood amidst the present
heated controversy.
The core list has been "per
ceived as making a statement that
we did not intend to make," Perry
said.
"It has been seen as a conser
vative statement, as a type of
canon of great works that the
Stanford faculty have decided
amongst themselves are the im
portant topics to teach freshmen."
According to Perry, the task

force did not see the core list as
an indisputable canon, but as a
vehicle for creating a shared ed
ucational experience.
The core list was "a means and
not an end," he said.
"It was intended to be some
thing that changes," Perry said.
He anticipated core list revisions
occuring about every two years
— as new faculty members came
to the University and student in
terests changed. Core list origina
tors felt relieved to get their pro
gram off the ground and that
there was room for experimenta
tion down the road. But that was
a "pretty naive" belief, he said.
There have been no changes in
the core list in the eight years of
the program.
Looking back on the Western
Culture program, Perry said he
believed the core list "has done a
lot of good," because it made the
freshmen requirement a reality.
But now Perry said he feels that
the University is "paying a larger
and larger price" by keeping the
core list.
Because the core list fosters a
misconception of the program as
a "great works course," it
alienates faculty and minority
students. He also pointed out that
the confusion surrounding the
core list has led to "the miseduca
tion of non-minority students"
who now think that replacing core
list readings with works by
women or people of color means
a drop in the quality of the pro
gram.
"Minority students say we are
conveying this message, and we

do not mean to but it is being
conveyed." he said. "It is very
hard for us to get across the mes
sage that this is not a great books
course."
"Freshman education is well
served by bringing them into con
tact with the great works" he said,
but the course from its inception
was never meant to follow the
concept of a "great works educa
tion" which several other univer
sities pursued at the time.
According to Perry, the task
force wanted to encourage
noteworthy faculty members to
become involved with freshman
education by creating a well
defined program. Without an or
ganized program, the task force
feared that faculty members
might not want to teach freshman
survery courses because Stanford
is a "research university," Perry
explained.
"They (the faculty) have to be
motivated. They have got to have
some feeling that the course is a
recognized thing and that the stu
dents will be there."
A main goal of the task force
was to involve students with "in
tellectually complex" and "histor

ically significant works," he said.
The task force wanted students
"to see ideas and values in a new
way, to critically analyze the ideas
and know that there are alter
natives" to ideas including Amer
ican conceptions of success and
democracy, he said.
Another goal of the Western
Culture program was "self
knowledge" through studying an
intellectual tradition, Perry said.
The Western Culture program
would also curtail students from
making embarrassing historical
blunders in upper-division classes
as well.
"Students should not think
Descartes was a pre-Christian
philosopher," Perry explained.
The task force hoped to create
a basis for intellectual interaction
in and out of class.
"It was thought that the way
to get that (interaction) was the
core list," he said.
Hoping to convey these aca
demic goals to the Faculty Senate
for approval, the originators saw
the core list as "a solution to
defining what the actual content
of the new program would be . . .
the core list became the vehicle
of (a) shared experience," said
Perry.
"At the time I thought it was
brilliant," he added. "It did not
force us to answer unanswerable
questions."
But once the core list "was used
to define the content of the
course, it became impossible to
regard as a flexible, pragmatic
pedogogical instrument."
Although Perry supported the
core list at the start, he said the
title "Western Culture" did not
clearly convey what the origina
tors envisioned the program to
be. "I never thought it (the title)
was a clear concept," he said.
Looking back on the planning
stages of Western Culture, Perry
said "we did something good for
freshman education, and it is too
bad we did it in a way that caused
so much pain. We should improve
the [ core list].
"It looks like I have changed
my mind about something basic,
but I have not changed my mind.
What is basic is the idea of analyz
ing the ideas and values with
which we live and their alterna
tives. We have had the course and
we can continue to have the
course."
