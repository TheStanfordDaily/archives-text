# Former Israeli secretary general:
## Mideast must live with conflict 
### Amy Rosenfeld 
Mutual acceptance between Israelis and Arabs is
essential for peace in the Middle East, said a former
Israeli government official yesterday in a speech
about Arab-Israeli relations in the Middle East.
"We are destined to live side by side with each
other in that part of the world," said Natanel Lorch,
former secretary general of the Knesset, Israel's
parliament, to a crowd of about 40 students and
faculty members at the Faculty Club.
Lorch said he sees no definitive solution to Arab-
Israeli conflict. Previously proposed solutions —
ranging from complete elimination of Israel to com
plete elimination of Arabs in Israeli territory and
several in between — have all proved unworkable,
he said. "There will always be someone who will
dissent," Ix>rch said.
Consequently, Arabs and Israelis must "learn to
live knowing no solution exists," he said. But rather
than accepting the status quo, Lorch proposed find
ing alternate methods for solving some problems.
Lorch's main proposal consists of what he calls
"open disagreements, secretly arrived at." Arabs
and Israelis could disagree in public but agree
privately, "keeping up appearances" to the rest of
the world, he said.

Lorch pointed to the recent violence between Is
raelis and Palestinians in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip as one notable public disagreement and
called the clashes "new, but symptomatic of a sit
uation which is not new."
These riots by Palestinians, said Lorch, are not
directed by outside figures such as Yasir Arafat,
though the Palestinian leader has recently claimed
as such. Arafat, who "certainly does not represent
the sentiment of all the Arabs on the West Bank,"
has simply "jumped on the bandwagon," Lorch said.
Lorch also said the Israeli government's specific
policy toward its neighbors is to have "as few di
mensions of friction with the Arabs as possible."
He said main objectives include keeping main ar
teries and roadways open and maintaining a curfew.
The Israeli government is prepared to use force
to achieve these objectives when necessary, Lorch
said, such as when a soldier's life is directly threat
ened.
Beatings, said Lorch, are not a specific part of
the policy. "I wouldn't promise that nobody got
beat up or that all those who got beat up were in
hot pursuit," he said, "but there is no specific
policy" about beatings.
