# Board delays vote on Olympics ban

### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
The San Francisco Board of Su
pervisors delayed its vote yester
day on a resolution that might
keep the 1996 Olympics away
from Stanford and the Bay Area.
According to officials from the
clerk's office of the Board of Su
pervisors, the vote on the contro
versial issue, which was originally
scheduled for Feb. 4 and then
moved to yesterday, has been
delayed again until Feb. 29.
The resolution, authored by
City Supervisor Harry Britt,
proposes that San Francisco City
and County "decline participation
in any efforts to secure the 1996
Olympics until the International
and United States Olympic Com
mittees allow the use of the name
'Olympics' by the Gay Games."
The Bay Area, including Stan
ford, is one of four sites being
considered for the United States
entry bid to host the 1996 Games.
Britt's resolution has the sup
port of San Francisco Mayor Art
Agnos and seven out of 11 city
supervisors, according to his of
fice.
The U.S. Olympic Committee
gained the exclusive right to use
the word "Olympics" and the
trademark five rings that sym
bolize the games in the United
States in 1978, when Congress
passed the Amateur Athletic Act.
The committee subsequently
won a lawsuit against the Gay
Games for infringing on that
right. The Gay Games is an event
similar to the Olympics held every
four years for members of the gay
community.
Britt proposed the resolution
because, according to Board offi
cials, he feels that participating
in the Olympics would dis

criminate against the gay commu
nity.
Britt's resolution does not seek
to ban the Olympics from the Bay
Area, but instead seeks to make
acceptance of an Olympic offer
conditional on the right of the
Gay Games to change its name
back to Gay Olympics, according
to Cindy Myers, aide to City Su
pervisor Tom Hsieh.
Myers said that although Hsieh
supports the Gay Games' right to
use the word "Olympics," he has
sponsored a counter resolution
that would not make acceptance
of an Olympic bid contingent on
a change in the Olympic Commit
tee's previous ruling.
Myers explained that Hsieh
believes Britt's proposal would
"penalize" the people of San Fran
cisco by not allowing the Olympics
to come to the Bay Area.
Myers noted that Mayor Agnos
may play "a critical role" in
working out a compromise be
tween the two proposals.
State Sen. Quentin Kopp said
if the resolution passes, "it will
hurt the chances" for the Bay
Area to win its bid to host the
Games. Kopp is chair of the Bay
Area Sports Organizing Commit
tee, which put together a bid for
the Olympics.
Kopp said voting on the reso
lution was postponed partly be
cause two members of the board
were absent from hearings today,
and partly because "both sides are
hoping that some sort of compro
mise can be worked out."
In addition, Kopp said he
advised Britt to postpone the vote
before the meeting yesterday
morning.
However, the strongest reason
for the delay is that "there is over-
