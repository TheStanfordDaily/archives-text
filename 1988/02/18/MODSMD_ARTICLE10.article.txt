# Patents bring record profits

Stanford received over $6
million from patent royalties
during the 1986-87 fiscal year,
setting a University record and
making it one of the highest
earners among U.S. univer
sities.
According to Katharine Ku,
associate director of the Office
of Technical Licensing, the fig
ure shows Stanford does "a
pretty good job of transferring
basic research to practical ap
plication."
This year's profit, generated
from 116 technologies, is 18
percent higher than last year's,
and is more than all patent
money received by the Univer
sity of California's nine cam
puses last year.
The licensing office pays all
"out of pocket" expenses of ob
taining patents such as appli
cation fees and receives 15 per
cent of net royalties, Ku said.
The remaining revenue is
divided among the inventor,
the department and the Uni
versity.
The year's biggest earnings,
$1.7 million, were generated by
a joint Stanford-UC patent on
recombinant DNA. Music Prof.

John Chowning's patent on
synthesis techniques for sound
raised the second largest
amount.
Chowning, who now has two
patents to his name, credits the
licensing office for being a
"sensitive group" and a major
reason why the University
received the record amount of
revenue.
"The [licensing office],"
Chowning said, "does an ex
traordinary job of bridging the
gap between academic research
and the larger question of im
plementation for the public
good."
According to Chowning,
many researchers know much
more about the theory behind
a project than they do about
its design for practical use.
Ku said the process of re
ceiving a patent can continue
for anywhere from two to five
years. Arguments "go back and
forth" between the licensing of
fice and the patent office before
a patent is granted or denied.
The licensing office receives
about three patent proposals
each day and — on average —
approves only one out of four.
Only proposals approved by the
licensing office are sent to the
patent office for consideration.
