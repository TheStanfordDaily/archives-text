# Medical Center will test for asbestos

The Medical Center is undergoing tests to
evaluate its asbestos conditions, according to
an official at the Stanford Hospital.
Ruben Perez, manager of the Hospital's
Environmental Health and Safety Depart
ment, said testing at the Edwards and Lane
Buildings has already been completed. No
evidence of a hazardous level of asbestos was
found.
Perez said the investigations should be com
pleted by August. Hospital facilities as yet
unexamined include parts of the Core, sections
of the East and West wings of the Hospital

and Hoover Pavilion.
The comprehensive survey currently under
way requires visual inspection of each office
within the Medical Center complex and lab
analysis of air samples and construction ma
terials. Jeffrey Narita, a safety specialist hired
last April, is conducting most of the investi
gations.
The Hospital's survey was prompted by a
separate asbestos investigation that is being
conducted by the University Environmental
Health and Safety department. That survey
began in 1985.
According to Perez, an in-house survey is
more thorough and cost-effective than hiring

outside consultants, as was done in the cam
puswide project. He stressed, however, that
if hazardous conditions were found, the hospi
tal would hire consultants to conduct second
ary tests.
In the event that a risk exists, affected
areas would be immediately evacuated until
the source of the problem is identified and
action is taken to abate the hazard, Perez said.
Test results will be used to facilitate budget
ing projections of future construction projects,
Perez said, adding that he does not expect to
uncover any risk conditions since the opera
tions and maintainence crews regularly in
spect the buildings.
