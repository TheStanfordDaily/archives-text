# Ecologist discouraged by future for wildlife
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
A noted ecologist painted a
bleak picture of world conserva
tion movements in a lecture in
Kresge Auditorium last night.
"Clearly we can see the end of
wildlife in this world outside of
national parks," Georg Treichel
said.
Treichel, a professor in the Ge
ography and Environmental
Studies Department at San Fran
cisco State University, has visited
129 nations and 400 of the world's
600 national parks. He spoke
mainly about African conserva
tion movements in an effort to
highlight the broader problem of
world wildlife preservation.
"By the year 2000," he declared,
"almost all large animals will be
eradicated" in Africa outside of
national parks.

Treichel cited colonial Lurope's
failure to instill the values of
"ecosystem worship and open
space" in native Africans as a
major cause of the decline in
African wildlife.
He said that African concern
about conservation is primarily
limited to efforts that will attract
European tourists and their cur
rency.
"Ninety-eight percent of the
people living in Nigeria have
never seen big animals like elep
hants and giraffes because they've
disappeared from the area."
Treichel also blamed coloniza
tion and the subsequent develop
ment of roads and railroads in
the late 19th century as contri
buting to the loss of African
wildlife. He drew a parallel to
American expansion of the same
period that eradicated the bison.

eradicated' in Africa.

their independence from colonial
powers, the result was a decline
in conservation efforts, Treichel
said. "Areas set aside as natural
preserves by European colonists
were ravaged (by Africans) for
protein (food sources)," he said.
"In the late '60s you could see
4,400 elephants in one spot in the
Congo. Now there are less than
100 in the area. There is only one
place in Africa where you can see
more than 1,000 black rhinoc
eroses," Treichel added.
He also cited public health ef
forts for humans, which he de

scribed as "death control," as a
meyor cause of the conservation
problem. Advances in health care
and a high birthrate increase the
population and further the deple
tion of resources that animals also
need.
In the past, he continued, areas
with no other use were set aside
for natural parks. Because of the
degeneration of other land due to
an increased human population,
these natural park lands are now
"superior" to other African land.
Treichel spoke to an audience
of 50 as part of the Conservation
and Sustainability Lecture Series
sponsored by the Program in
Human Biology, Students for En
vironmental Action at Stanford
(SEAS), and the Antaeus Group.
He replaced scheduled lecturer
Raymond Dasmann, Environmen
tal Studies Professor at UC-Santa
Cruz, who canceled Tuesday.
