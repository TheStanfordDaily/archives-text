Police tear gas protesters
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Police
backed by army troops fired tear gas at blacks
protesting the eviction of rent strikers in
Soweto township yesterday, according to res
idents and anti-apartheid activists who work
in the township.
The authorities confirmed that clashes oc
curred and that tear gas had been used, but
denied reports by residents that police had
fired birdshot into a crowd, wounding three
persons.
Witnesses to the police action said some
fleeing youths were chased and beaten with
"sjamboks," or rubber whips commonly used
by the security forces, after tear gas was fired
into a crowd of about 1,000 people who gath
ered early this morning outside the local
municipal office in the White City neighbor
hood to protest the evictions.
It was described as one of the most serious
confrontations in Soweto between black resi
dents and the authorities since August 1986,
when about 30 residents in White City and
adjoining Jabavu were shot and killed in
clashes that followed rent evictions.
Soweto, a sprawling black township of 2.5
million residents was reported tense as soldiers
and police in armored personnel carriers ringed
White City, which is so named because its
tiny brick houses are uniformly painted white.
Democrats discuss contra aid
WASHINGTON - House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, said yesterday that House
Democrats are near agreement on a package
of humanitarian aid for the Nicaraguan Con
tras that could contain incentives for the San
dinistas to cooperate in a cease-fire — perhaps
including an end to U.S. trade sanctions on
Nicaragua.
But Wright said "the enthusiastic coopera
tion of the administration" would be necessary
before such a "balanced" peace package could
be considered, and there was no sign that
Wright would gain the cooperation of House
Republicans, much less the White House.
"He's (Wright) just blowing smoke," said
Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., a leader of the
pro-Contra forces in the House, who said
Republicans will not cooperate in any Demo
cratic bill-drafting process.
With no cooperation likely, it appeared that
each side would concentrate on what amounts
to a public-relations campaign as they move
toward a vote on humanitarian aid.
The final money value of the package is
uncertain, although it is almost certain to be
less than the $36.2 million package — includ
ing $3.6 million in lethal aid — that was
defeated 219 to 211 on Feb. 4.
Fire burns U.S. embassy room
MOSCOW — A fire at the U.S. Embassy
burned for 45 minutes yesterday before Mos
cow firefighters brought it under control.
The fire on the fifth floor of the "old" em
bassy building came in the midst of the staffs
preparations for Secretary of State George
Shultz's visit Sunday.
No one was hurt and the fire was limited
to a single unoccupied room, one of many
under renovation, in part for fire-prevention
purposes. Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert
said the construction might be to blame but
that "it will take a full investigation to be
sure."
