# U.S. Marine kidnapped in Lebanon
## 
### 
NICOSIA, Cyprus — A U.S. Marine of
ficer serving with a United Nations
peacekeeping force was abducted yesterday
in southern Lebanon.
A Pentagon official in Washington iden
tified the officer as Lt. Col. William Hig
gins, 43, of Danville, Ky. He said that
Higgins was on temporary duty as chief of
the U.N. Truce Supervisory Organization
in Lebanon, a 75-man observer force es
tablished in 1948 to monitor the cease-fire
that went into effect at the end of the
Israeli War of Independence.
There was no immediate claim of respon
sibility for the abduction.
A U.N. spokesman, Timur Goksel, said
that Higgins was abducted Wednesday af
ternoon as he drove along the coastal high
way from Tyre toward Naqoura, a town
just north of the Israeli border that is the
center of U.N. peacekeeping operations in
southern Lebanon. Naqoura is headquar
ters for the nine-nation, 5,800-man U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNI
FIL, which was set up in 1978 to restore
peace and security in the nation after the
1975-76 civil war.
Goksel said that Higgins was in a U.N.
station wagcn, traveling behind a similar
vehicle that was carrying two other U.N.
observers. He said the lead station wagon
rounded a bend in the road and, when its
passengers noticed that Higgins' car was
not following, they doubled back and found
his car abandoned.
Goksel said that U.N. troops supported
by helicopters were searching the area.
An official of the Department of Defense

in Washington gave a similar account of
the abduction. He said 16 Americans were
assigned to the observer group but that
not all were necessarily in Lebanon at the
same time. Goksel, the U.N. spokesman,
said that six Americans were with the
group.
Although UNIFIL troops, who have oc
casionally clashed with Palestinian guer
rillas, Lebanese militiamen and Israeli
troops, are heavily armed, those attached
to the supervisory organization normally
carry only side arms.
The area where Higgins was kidnapped
is close to the Rashidiyeh Palestinian
refugee camp and to several towns popu
lated by Shia Moslems who have recently
shown increasing loyalty to Hezbollah
(Party of God), a radical Shia militia that
is financed and directed by Iran and
believed responsible for several terrorist
acts against Westerners.
Richard Sybert, a Los Angeles lawyer
who served as special assistant to Secretary
of Defense Caspar Weinberger in 1985-86,
when Higgins was one of Weinberger's two
military assistants, described the Marine
as having "one of the most cheerful per
sonalities I've known." When assigned to
the U.N. unit in Lebanon, Sybert said,
Higgins "knew he was going into a dan
gerous situation" but was eager for the
duty.
Eight other Americans are held hostage
in Lebanon, and most of them are believed
to be in the hands of Hezbollah.
