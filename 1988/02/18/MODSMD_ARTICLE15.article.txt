# PLO abandons plan to ship deportees
## 
### 
ATHENS, Greece — The Pales
tine Liberation Organization said
yesterday that following the
bombing of the ferry Sol Phryne
earlier in the week, it was
"postponing" plans to transport
Palestinian deportees back to Is
rael by ship.
The decision left four men who
were exiled during the worst wave
of unrest in Israel's occupied ter
ritories since their 1967 capture
at a loss as to where to go.
Speaking at a news conference
here yesterday, Sheikh Abdul
Hamid El-Sayeh, chair of the Pal
estinian National Council, blamed
Israel for blocking the "peaceful
mission" and gave no details as
to when, if ever, another boat
would sail.
El-Sayeh's carefully chosen
words were devoid of any threat
to retaliate for Israel's alleged
bombing of the "Ship of Return"
and the killing of three PLO men
reportedly involved in making ar
rangements for the trip; instead,
he focused on Israeli "terrorism"
against Arab peace efforts.
"Israel has damaged the ship
on which we wished to embark.
Israel had earlier used tactics of
threats and intimidation against
companies to pressure them from
providing us with a boat," El-
Sayeh said.
"We have now decided to tem
porarily postpone the date of
sailing. However, we wish to
declare that none of the obstacles
which have confronted us will

steer us from achieving . . . this
peaceful journey."
The PLO's "Ship of Return"
was intended to draw world at
tention to Israel's policy of deport
ing residents in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip by imitating the
journey of Jews fleeing Europe
41 years ago on the Exodus. About
130 people — foreign observers,
Palestinians and deportees — had
gathered to make the trip, as well
as about 100 journalists.
While most of the intended pas
sengers were disappointed at the
"postponement," many also ex
pressed relief that, after a week
of uncertainty, a decision had
been reached and that the cam
paign still had succeeded in focus
ing attention on the plight of
those who had been deported.
The PLO initially had planned
to sail Feb. 10 from Athens, but
the journey was delayed when
PLO organizers, because of what
they said were Israeli death
threats, had trouble finding a ship
owner willing to lease a vessel.
Then Monday an underwater
explosion ripped a 6-foot hole in
a ferry boat at Limassol, Cyprus,
that had been bought for the trip.
Israel, which branded the PLO
plan a "propaganda" stunt, denied
attacking the boat — even though
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
had warned that Israel would
prevent the ship from reaching
its shores.
