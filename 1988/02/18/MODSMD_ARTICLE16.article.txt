# Salvador rebels kill 17

### 
USULUTAN, El Salvador — Leftist
guerrillas assaulted an army base and
a cotton farming cooperative in
Usulutan in a series of attacks yesterday
that left at least 17 people dead, includ
ing seven civilians in a house leveled by
mortar fire.
Salvadoran army officials said another
13 soldiers and a civilian were wounded
during 2U hours of fighting at the ar
my's 6th Infantry Brigade in this town,
capital of the eastern province of
Usulutan. Two U.S. military advisers at
the base during the attack were not
injured.
Guerrillas from the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, also
destroyed two bridges and five power
posts and damaged a cotton-seed oil fac
tory near Usulutan, about 70 miles east
of San Salvador, the nation's capital. At
the same time, the rebels launched
minor attacks on military positions in
five other provinces.
The rebel offensive came as foreign
ministers from five Central American
nations, including El Salvador, gathered
in San Salvador to set up a commission
to verify their governments' compliance
with a regional peace plan. The accord,
signed by the five nations' presidents
last August, has had little effect on El
Salvador's eight-year civil war.
Gen. Adolfo Blandon, head of the Sal
vadoran joint chiefs of staff, flew to the
Usulutan garrison by helicopter to
review the damage Wednesday and
called the assault a failure because the
rebels did not penetrate the installation.
The damage and casualties were far
less than in last year's rebel assault on
the 4th Infantry Brigade at El Paraiso
in the northern province of

Chalatenango. A U.S. military adviser,
Staff Sgt. Gregory Fronius of
Greensburg, Pa., died in the March 31
attack, and the Salvadoran army suf
fered about 200 casualties. The rebels
destroyed a major portion of the gar
rison.
Five weeks later, guerrillas attacked
the base of the 4th Military Detachment
in San Francisco Gotera, the capital of
eastern Morazan province. An estimated
18 people were killed in that attack,
including a civilian woman.
Like the base in San Francisco Gotera,
the Usulutan garrison is in the center
of a densely populated town and thus
is a more difficult target than the El
Paraiso base.
A half-dozen houses across a dirt road
from the garrison here were heavily
damaged, apparently by rebel mortars
that fell short of their mark. An uni
dentified family, including four children,
died in one of the houses, according to
military and civilian sources.
Lt. Rene Armando Brenes of the 6th
Brigade said the attack began shortly
after midnight. He said the rebels were
within 500 feet of the heavily guarded
garrison and attacked from three direc
tions.
The guerrillas used machine guns,
grenades and mortars, Brenes said. He
attributed the relatively light damage to
the fact that the army had some warn
ing. Shortly before the attack, five guer
rillas were detected less than a mile
north of the garrison, and the army
began to prepare for action. In addition,
the air force sent aircraft aloft to light
the area with flares.
