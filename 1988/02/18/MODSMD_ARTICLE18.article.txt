## Bennett blunders 
### 
ON MORE THAN ONE oc
casion in the past month,
U.S. Secretary of Education
William Bennett has seen fit to
pronounce judgment on Stanford's
Western Culture debate. Each
time, Bennett's unfounded, rash
opinions have perpetuated a
skewed view of the debate in the
national arena.
Bennett claims Stanford is
"trashing," "dropping," and
"smashing" Western Culture, and
that the Faculty Senate is giving
in to "academic policy by in
timidation." Thanks to "a very vo
cal minority," Bennett says, Stan
ford is marching "straight into the
'605."
The secretary's rhetorical reper
toire is certainly well-developed,
but his understanding of the real
issues at hand leaves much to be
desired. His reductionist views,
however, have an accomplice: the
national media.
Headline articles in The New
York Times, the Los Angeles Times
and Newsweek, as well as national
television and radio reports, have
seized upon our "Great Debate" as
the re-enactment of the death of
Socrates. Reading these articles,
one is led to believe that the Fac
ulty Senate is on the verge of
voting whether or not to ban Plato
forever.
This is simply untrue, and most
players in the drama agree that
"Western Culture" as such is in
no immediate danger of extinction.
Socrates can rest easily.
The crux of the issue is not re
taining or dropping the program,
but rather how best to modify the
program to achieve the common
goal of integrating works by
women and minorities, and
whether a core list of readings im
pedes that effort.
Unfortunately, the intricacies of
the core list argument — essen
tially an argument of means rather

than ends — don't necessarily
make good copy for the national
press.
Especially with books like "The
Closing of the American Mind" by
Allan Bloom riding the top of the
bestseller lists for weeks, the media
is eager to latch onto any intellec
tual debate that seems destructive
to the "back to basics" educational
philosophy propounded by Bennett
and like conservative thinkers.
Stanford students, in many ways
the instigators of the debate, are
also misrepresented in print. One
quick quote from the Black Stu
dent Union and one from a con
servative student, both easily
taken out of context, and the press
has in hand the requisite polar
opposites of opinion.
University President Donald
Kennedy should be commended for
taking the lead in dispelling the
media's mythical polarizations and
rebutting the secretary's dire view
of the consequences of the Western
Culture debate.
In a letter last week to alumni
and University supporters, Ken
nedy played a conciliatory role,
noting that "much too much has
been made of the differences, and
too little of the similarities" of the
competing proposals to modify the
program.
Kennedy is right. With the Fac
ulty Senate vote on the issue soon
to come, it is important to remem
ber how much common ground and
compromise has already been
achieved.
Before he makes another ludi
crous assessment of the state of
education at Stanford, Secretary
Bennett certainly ought to take the
time to seriously consider the is
sues of the Western Culture
debate. As a national leader in ed
ucation, his words carry too much
weight to be thrown about ir
responsibly.
