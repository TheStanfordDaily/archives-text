# Fraternity leaders call new report outdated
## 
### Glen Tripp Staff writer 
Although members of the Task
Force on Fraternities and
Sororities contend that its newly
released report can provide a
framework for future policy deci
sions, fraternity leaders argued
yesterday that the document, four
years in the making, may be out
dated already.
The recommendations released
yesterday by the task force, which
did not incorporate any new data
or student opinion from 1984 to
the present, correspond exactly to
preliminary results reached in
1984.
In addition to doubting whether
the recommendations can be ap
plied at all to the current frater
nity and sorority situation, some
fraternity and sorority leaders
question the feasibility of the task
force suggestion to allow un
housed fraternities and sororities
an equal opportunity to gain

campus housing.
Another issue in the report con
tested by Greek leaders yesterday
and task force members during
their deliberation was the recom
mendation to alter the housed
fraternities' subjective selection
criteria.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said yesterday that the
greatest value of the report will
be to help fraternities and uni
versity officials "think through
policy."
However, some fraternity mem
bers criticized the report as being
outdated.
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Vinny Frost said he "did not
want to discredit the report," but
felt that it might no longer be
current.
The final report comes after
four years of work by the task
force, which was appointed by
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons in 1983 after the number
of fraternities on campus doubled

the 1977 figure. The original
charge of the task force was to
address "to what degree should
fraternal organizations at Stan


Joe Pisano
ford be encouraged or dis
couraged."
The task force issued six rec
ommendations in June 1984. But
because the recommendations
were inadequately documented,
the task force was told to research
the issues again and come back
with a more detailed report, Lyons
said.
Four years later, the only ad
dition to the 1984 report is the
written inclusion of pre-1984 data
used to make the task force's
original recommendations.
English Lecturer Kathleen
Namphy, a member of the task
force, admitted that four years
was "an undue amount of time
for such a report." But, she added,
"it did take time to revise a report
that everyone could finally ap
prove.
"The task force members felt
that it was necessary that the
body of the report reflect ac
curately the discussion and the
emphasis of the members, and it
took a lot of time to make revi
sions that were agreeable to
everyone," Namphy said. The
report met final approval last
summer and was adequately cur
rent, she said.
Registrar Sally Mahoney, who

also sat on the task force, agreed
that the report is valuable today.
"The report refers more to mat
ters of principle than to data,"
Mahoney said. "I believe we have
done what we have been asked to
do."
Task force member Robert
Hamrdla, assistant to the presi
dent, said although he would have
liked the report to come out
sooner, "the principles are still
the same."
However, Frost argued that
Stanford's fraternal system has
changed markedly in the last four
years. He pointed out that there
are fewer behavioral problems
now than in 1984. Frost also said
fraternity government runs more
smoothly today and fraternities
are doing more community work
than ever.
Former Theta Delta Chi Pres
ident Robin Vasan did not think
the task force did its job. "My
biggest complaint is that the
report is not timely," he said. "Ap
parently the chairman was very
picky, and I think the size of the
task force was a problem."
Besides the report's timeliness,
the Greek leaders questioned its
third recommendation, which
states that all groups — including
sororities, coed fraternities and
black fraternities — should have
equal access to University re

sources. These resources include
housing, according to Lyons.
In order to take advantage of
this opportunity, however, these
groups would have to alter their
selection process to one that is
objective instead of subjective.
Intersorority Council President
Carol DeMattei said sororities are
happy where they are. "Housing
is not an issue for sororities right
now," she said.
Mark Garner, president of the
Black Greek Letter Council, said
it would be unlikely that black
fraternities or sororities make the
changes needed in order to receive
housing, "112 don't think the selec
tion process would be changed for
housing," he said. "The process
we've adopted is one we're com
fortable with."
