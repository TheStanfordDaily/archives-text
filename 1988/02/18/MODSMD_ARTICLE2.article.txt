# Fraternity leaders call new report outdated

Although members of the Task
Force on Fraternities and
Sororities contend that its newly
released report can provide a
framework for future policy deci

an equal opportunity to gain

campus housing.

their deliberation was the recom

fraternities' subjective selection

Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said yesterday that the
greatest value of the report will
be to help fraternities and uni

outdated.
Interfraternity Council Presi

want to discredit the report," but
felt that it might no longer be
current.
The final report comes after
four years of work by the task
force, which was appointed by
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons in 1983 after the number
of fraternities on campus doubled

the 1977 figure. The original
charge of the task force was to
address "to what degree should
