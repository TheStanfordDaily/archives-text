## LOTS lacks privacy 
### 
IMAGINE RETURNING to your
dorm room one day to find a deadbolt
lock on your door along with a letter
of notification stating that your residence
privileges have been frozen. When the
situation is explained to you, you learn
that due to suspicions of impropriety,
officials have taken the liberty of search
ing through your personal belongings,
without your knowledge and without fol
lowing any official procedures.
This scenario isn't a typical occurrence
at Stanford, at least with respect to
housing policies. Rut it is analagous to
the sort of violations of privacy that have
occurred at LOTS, Stanford's "low over
head time sharing" computer network.
LOTS, now known as AIR (Academic
Information Resources), is used by most
students and many faculty members at
some time. But most members of the
Stanford community who make use of
the facilities at LOTS never realize the
extent to which their privacy can be over
stepped.
While it seems unbelievable, it is true
that computing officials are capable of
reading any piece of private mail or in
formation sent through the computer
network. Perhaps most appalling though,
is the fact that a LOTS user will never
know when, why or by whom their
privacy has been violated.
Programs that enable LOTS officials
to watch every keystroke typed by a com
puter user and any output displayed on
his screen (all without the knowledge of
the user) are readily available to LOTS

supervisors.
Some of the more blatantly under
handed programs, the so-called "spy
programs," allow those administrators
with access to them to covertly enter
someone's account, watch their commu
nications and read their personal mes
sages and files.
While it is true that LOTS privacy
policies clearly "reserve the right to in
spect and/or record any files stored in
the computers and any communications
that pass through these computers," it
is both unfair and deceptive that we as
computer users are not made more clearly
aware of these policies.
When you go to open an account at
LOTS, you are given a brief introduction
to LOTS and the rules of LOTS, but it
is not until the account has been perma
nently created that you are asked to read
the LOTS/AIR policy statement. Opening
an account at LOTS is comparable to
signing a contract with the fine print
covered up.
If you do take the time to discover
exactly what the LOTS/AIR policy state
ments say, you find that LOTS' on-line
policy statements reflect sentiments al
most exactly opposite to their written
policy statements.
The written policies of LOTS/AIR insist
that computer users have limited privacy
and are subject to invasions of privacy
at the discretion of administrators.
However, the on-line policy statement
makes it clear that "snooping is highly
inappropriate .. . and a violation of the
trust ... of the user community." It

states that "snooping, even for the pur
pose of maintaining good order, is an
invasion of privacy."
Students are stuck with an unclear
policy that states that snooping is neces
sary but inappropriate. In other words:
It is an evil, but a necessary evil.
These policies are inconsistent, both
with each other and with the ideals of
the University. While LOTS has the re
sponsibility to monitor the use of com
puting facilities and intercept attempts
at fraudulent computer use, it is not
apparent that such monitoring is being
done in a regulated and reliable manner.
While it is true that most users' ex
perience with LOTS is positive and free
of troubles, the occurrence of any misuse
of administrative power indicates that
more stringent guidelines for mainte
nance and monitoring of the system are
required.
Clearly, LOTS' policy is inconsistent
for a school that bases its educational
policies on standards of trust between
students, faculty and administrators
alike.
