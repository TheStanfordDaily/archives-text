## Dry Rush Should alcohol be served during fraternity Rush? 
### 
PRO

It is the consensus among
fraternity leaders that the
presence of alcohol, which
is served at two of the
three weekly Rush activi
ties, has not adversely af
fected the overall condi

tions under which the important deci
sions of fraternity membership are made.
The purpose of Rush is to foster an
environment in which rushees and fra
ternities can make the most informed
decisions regarding membership selec
tion.
While several members of the Inter
fraternity Council argued that alcohol in
terfered with this mutual selection proc
ess, the majority believed it did not.
The two weekly parties are only a small
part of Rush. That is, rushees are in
cluded in other activities where alcohol
is not present. Hence, they get to know
members well outside of the party at
mosphere.
A few fraternity presidents opposed a
dry Rush because they said some people
who are not initially interested in Rush
come for the parties, where they meet
members, learn about the fraternity and
eventually decide to join.
The process toward a policy has been
thoughtful and realistic, particularly be
cause fraternity members recognize the
dangers of a "wet" rush: liability risks,
serving alcohol to minors, the potential
for disturbances in the community and,
for some, allowing the consumption of
alcohol to interfere with meeting and get
ting to know others.
Fraternity members believe that last
year's policy worked well in minimizing
these risks. Members of the dean of stu
dent affair's staff publicly remarked that
Rush had gone well, with one exception.
The tragic death of a fraternity mem
ber during Rush last spring reminds us
of the tremendous danger of alcohol and
the collective responsibility we must all
assume when alcohol is present.

Such a tragic incident compels us to
reconsider our attitudes toward drinking,
but it is not an indictment of the Rush
process; such was the conclusion of the
report prepared by the Office of Student
Affairs.
However, excessive drinking and
related incidents of misconduct disturb
the IFC greatly.
The system in place last year attempted
to minimize these incidents and did so
successfully.
I am confident that the trend toward
increasingly more responsible Rush
events will continue because of more ef
fective IFC guideline enforcement, a
growing emphasis on collective responsi
bility and greater sensitivity for others
on campus affected by Rush.
The University encourages students to
make their own decisions provided that
those students assume responsibility for
their behavior.
The IFC has made its decision, and we
expect to be held accountable for it.
I would like to note that an important
change in IFC Rush policy has gone un
noticed. In December, the IFC required
statements from each fraternal group
that described their fraternal purpose,
their goals within the context of the Stan
ford community and the obligations of
membership.
These statements, along with sections
which discuss overall fraternity scholar
ship, athletics and public service will be
included in the 1988 IFC Rush Book.
We hope that, as a result of that in
formation, more men will be attracted to
fraternites, that they will be attracted
for the right reasons, that men and
women outside the system will know bet
ter the positive qualities of fraternities
and that rushees can have a better un
derstanding before the start of Rush.

CON

Fraternities (and really
only the residential ones)
are significantly hurt by a
"wet rush." Rushing with
booze perpetuates some of
their worst stereotypes,
masks some of their

strengths and subjects fraternities to
risks that they should try to avoid.
A rush that is, or appears to be, or
ganized around alcohol perpetuates un
wanted stereotypes about residential fra
ternities. Whether deserved or not, fra
ternities are perceived by many to be
"drinking clubs," groups organized
around parties and alcohol.
I often hear statements like, "Because
of the constant noise, partying, drinking
and drunkenness, fraternities are anti
intellectual. They detract from, rather
than add to, the intellectual and academic
life of the university."
Fraternities quite understandably
assert that a good fraternal organization
is a helpful and good learning experience.
But can that argument be heard if Rush
continues to be organized around alcohol?
Won't Rush discourage students who
don't make a fetish of the keg, but who
otherwise might be interested in all that
a fraternal organization has to offer? Do
open parties where alcohol is served pro
vide an atmosphere that encourages an
honest exchange of information and
thoughtful decision-making? Are residen
tial fraternities more than drinking
clubs? If so, how does that message get
across in a rush laced with alcohol?
There is another stereotype that resi
dential fraternities have to contend with:
"Fraternities are for the rich." It may
not be a stereotype that is fully deserved.
Yet, it is an inescapable fact that buying
booze for Rush is expensive. This costs
money, and the money comes from the
members.
Won't a "wet rush" put off potential
members who have tight budgets or who
don't wish to see their discretionary

money used to supply alcohol for them
selves or others? Won't the prospect of
big social dues detract from efforts to
ensure that fraternity membership is as
diverse as the student body generally?
These are times when the laws about
serving of alcohol to minors are enforced.
When will fraternities catch on?
Sure, one can ask, "Why does the Uni
versity pick on fraternities and not other
groups?" The University doesn't. It does
not enforce the law â€” law enforcement
agencies do, and they do not distinguish
between fraternities and other residen
ces. The University cannot and docs not
wish to afford students sanctuary from
the public laws. Why do the residential
fraternities knowingly place themselves
publicly in conflict with the law?
Serving alcohol at Rush parties exacer
bates the disruption of academic and res
idential life that is already an unfortun
ate by-product of the Rush process. Stu
dents who are interested in several fra
ternities must attend several parties.
That often means having several drinks
at each party. It is clear that this hinders
good study habits but the rushee may
feel that he has little choice.
Why do the residential fraternities
refuse to heed the thoughtful advice of
their nationals and alumni? Fraternities
nationally have been very clear in their
counsel about the civil risks involved in
serving of alcohol during Rush.
In fact, it is imprudent to serve alcohol
at any time without very sophisticated
precautions that prevent fellow students
from injuring themselves and others. The
stakes are big; bigger than any one chap
ter can insure itself against.
Even if the money stakes are dis
counted for a moment, who wants the
death or iryury of another student on
their conscience? Can it happen here? It
has!
