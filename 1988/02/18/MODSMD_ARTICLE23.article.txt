## Choose CIV proposal 
### 
WE, THE MEMBERS of the
Issues Committee of the Asian
American Students Association,
support the "Cultures, Ideas, and
Values" proposal of the Area One Task
Force and urge the Faculty Senate to
pass this proposal.
Education must reflect and criticize
both the current experiences of society
and the past experiences and perspec
tives which create it.
Education cannot and must not exist
in a vacuum; institutions such as
Stanford have the responsibility of
offering to their students an education
which will allow us to understand and
function in our present American
society.
This society is characterized by racial
and ethnic diversity and differences in
gender and class. It is neither the
embodiment nor the culmination of an
intellectual tradition in which only
elite white males participate.
We believe that CIV — legislation
which was the product of many quar
ters of discussion and compromise
among student groups, faculty and
administration — is the only proposal
currently available which significantly
addresses racial, ethnic, gender and
class diversities.
It is the only structure for a re
quired three-quarter sequence which
adequately recognizes not only the
contributions of women and people of
color to the creation of "Western
culture" but also the unique perspec
tive on this culture that women and
people of color have.
The counterproposal, sponsored by
English Prof. William Chace and other
members of the humanities faculty, to
amend the existing Western Culture
program, falls short of truly eliminat
ing gender-bias and ethnocentrism.
It retains a core list and merely adds
to it works by women and people of
color.
Retention of the core list implies
that there is only one frame of refer
ence through which we can evaluate
the development and present condition
of American society. The core list
would appear to represent all that
students need to know to understand
and critique our complex society.
On the other hand, changing the
"core list" approach to the understand
ing and criticism of our society is the
whole point of CIV.
No list of "great books" can truth
fully represent the development of

American culture. This culture was not
simply created by these books or the
"great thinkers" who wrote them, but
rather by the interaction of a whole
host of "great thinkers", and social,
economic and political experiences
which cannot be embodied in a list of
books.
For example, it is truly an inade
quate education that teaches us how
the ideas and benevolence of Leland
Stanford created this university, with
out juxtaposing these with the Chinese
railroad labor that made him rich and
placed him in a position to found this
university.
Neither does the retention of a core
list guarantee a "common intellectual
experience" for Stanford undergradu
ates. Merely reading the same works
by no means mandates discussion of
them or any level of intellectual ex
change.
CIV, by emphasizing the interaction
of experiences and perspectives and
how they came to shape American
culture, provides a better basis for
creating a common intellectual experi
ence.
By studying ideas, issues and experi
ences that relate to American culture
today and have some ties to students'
actual realities, we would want to
further explore these issues and seek
out other students, thereby truly creat
ing a "common intellectual experience."
It is a common misconception that
CIV, by abolishing the core list, will
disregard the works currently on it. In
fact, CIV will enrich the reading of
these works by approaching them from
diverse perspectives.
CIV does not "abolish" any texts; it
abolishes the notion that a list of these
texts forms the basis from which all
strands of our culture are built.
Freshmen will continue to read
Plato, Dante and Marx because these
authors have contributed substantially
to our culture.
In CIV, however, freshmen will
appreciate the fuller contexts in which
the ideas of Plato, Dante and Marx
developed.
As members of the Asian-American
community at Stanford, we see CIV as
one step in the continuing evolution
towards a more accurate and truthful
education.
We see many avenues of change that
Stanford can take; CIV, as a product
of long debate and compromise, is one
such avenue. Establishing Asian-

American Studies courses is another; it
would provide an integral piece to the
education we envision.
If this university is to fulfill its
obligation as an educational institution,
the Faculty Senate must spur this
evolution onward and legislate CIV.

American culture. This culture was not
simply created by these books or the
"great thinkers" who wrote them, but
rather by the interaction of a whole
host of "great thinkers", and social,
economic and political experiences
which cannot be embodied in a list of
books.
For example, it is truly an inade
quate education that teaches us how
the ideas and benevolence of Leland
Stanford created this university, with
out juxtaposing these with the Chinese
railroad labor that made him rich and
placed him in a position to found this
university.
Neither does the retention of a core
list guarantee a "common intellectual
experience" for Stanford undergradu
ates. Merely reading the same works
by no means mandates discussion of
them or any level of intellectual ex
change.
CIV, by emphasizing the interaction
of experiences and perspectives and
how they came to shape American
culture, provides a better basis for
creating a common intellectual experi
ence.
By studying ideas, issues and experi
ences that relate to American culture
today and have some ties to students'
actual realities, we would want to
further explore these issues and seek
out other students, thereby truly creat
ing a "common intellectual experience."
It is a common misconception that
CIV, by abolishing the core list, will
disregard the works currently on it. In
fact, CIV will enrich the reading of
these works by approaching them from
diverse perspectives.
CIV does not "abolish" any texts; it
abolishes the notion that a list of these
texts forms the basis from which all
strands of our culture are built.
Freshmen will continue to read
Plato, Dante and Marx because these
authors have contributed substantially
to our culture.
In CIV, however, freshmen will
appreciate the fuller contexts in which
the ideas of Plato, Dante and Marx
developed.
As members of the Asian-American
community at Stanford, we see CIV as
one step in the continuing evolution
towards a more accurate and truthful
education.
We see many avenues of change that
Stanford can take; CIV, as a product
of long debate and compromise, is one
such avenue. Establishing Asian-

American Studies courses is another; it
would provide an integral piece to the
education we envision.
If this university is to fulfill its
obligation as an educational institution,
the Faculty Senate must spur this
evolution onward and legislate CIV.

WE, THE MEMBERS of the
Issues Committee of the Asian
American Students Association,
support the "Cultures, Ideas, and
Values" proposal of the Area One Task
Force and urge the Faculty Senate to
pass this proposal.
Education must reflect and criticize
both the current experiences of society
and the past experiences and perspec
tives which create it.
Education cannot and must not exist
in a vacuum; institutions such as
Stanford have the responsibility of
offering to their students an education
which will allow us to understand and
function in our present American
society.
This society is characterized by racial
and ethnic diversity and differences in
gender and class. It is neither the
embodiment nor the culmination of an
intellectual tradition in which only
elite white males participate.
We believe that CIV — legislation
which was the product of many quar
ters of discussion and compromise
among student groups, faculty and
administration — is the only proposal
currently available which significantly
addresses racial, ethnic, gender and
class diversities.
It is the only structure for a re
quired three-quarter sequence which
adequately recognizes not only the
contributions of women and people of
color to the creation of "Western
culture" but also the unique perspec
tive on this culture that women and
people of color have.
The counterproposal, sponsored by
English Prof. William Chace and other
members of the humanities faculty, to
amend the existing Western Culture
program, falls short of truly eliminat
ing gender-bias and ethnocentrism.
It retains a core list and merely adds
to it works by women and people of
color.
Retention of the core list implies
that there is only one frame of refer
ence through which we can evaluate
the development and present condition
of American society. The core list
would appear to represent all that
students need to know to understand
and critique our complex society.
On the other hand, changing the
"core list" approach to the understand
ing and criticism of our society is the
whole point of CIV.
