## NOW focus is diverse 
### 
Leslie Kaufman's feb. 16
COLUMN on the National Organi
zation for Women's agenda was an
exercise in regressive thinking. Accord
ing to Kaufman, NOW has lost member
ship by "embracing a range of left-wing
humanist issues â€” most notably gay and
lesbian rights."
"It's not that these left-wing
humanist issues aren't worthwhile,"
says Kaufman, . . but let's separate
apples from oranges so that women
who want to join the movement don't
feel their membership in NOW is an
implicit acceptance of an unrelated
agenda."
Why beat around the bush? What's
really being said here is: Let's turn
NOW into an organization women can
join without fear of being labeled
lesbians.
In my opinion, we don't need to
narrow the NOW agenda. We need to
get rid of those kind of fears, the same
ones that kept women out of the
women's rights movement 30 years ago
and for some reason seem to be resur
facing.
The NOW agenda is broad to sup-

port a wide range of interests and
concerns. It's an organization for
women, and we certainly are a diverse
group.
You don't have to agree with it all,
you don't have to be a lesbian and you
don't have to be anywhere near as
militant as Elenore Smeal (I admit,
she's a bit much for me, too).
Some women just aren't interested;
others choose to expend their energies
in other areas. But for those who are
so inclined, the mechanisms are in
place to work for the "social feminist
issues" (such as affordable and avail
able licensed day-care) Kaufman sup
ports.
NOW doesn't need to narrow its
focus to win members and get things
done. It needs women who are inter
ested in women's rights to join and
stop worrying about what people will
think.
"Admitting women aren't equal to
men but are different with different
needs" does not sound like a step in
the right direction to me.
