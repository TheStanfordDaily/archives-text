On behalf of the entire Stanford
basketball program, I would like to
thank the student body for its enthusi
astic support at the last home games
against Arizona and Arizona State.
It was quite an effort on everybody's
part and your support cannot be over
emphasized. We could not have done it
without the crowd.
The "sixth man," the student body,
didn't appear in the boxscore, but the
team knows you deserve a lot of the
credit. That is exactly the atmosphere
we would like to develop all the time
at Maples.
We have two more home games,
both on television — Oregon at 8:30
p.m. Thursday, Feb. 25 (on ESPN) and
Oregon State at 3 p.m. on Saturday,
Feb. 27 (on regionally). Plan now, get
out your Cardinal colors, and show the
nation what Stanford is all about!
Thanks again!
