# Rifkin is used by the humane society
## 
### 
My "Point / Counterpoint" article on
the Research Animal Facility II project
appeared in the Feb. 11 after editing
and significant deletions done without
consulting me. I would like to clarify
one point which was most undermined
by the editing.
The Palo Alto Humane Society, in a
diversionary tactic which has little to
do with concern for animal welfare,
has now tagged medical recombinant-
DNA research as a potential environ
mental hazard and has enlisted Jeremy
Rifkin to lead this charge. It is impor
tant to note that, within the scientific
community, Rifkin's musings are
widely considered to be far-fetched and
not well-grounded in scientific fact.
I can only assume that Patricia
Elsen's opposing viewpoint suffered the
same fate and would have been more
coherent had it been published intact.
