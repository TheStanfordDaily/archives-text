## Space SURFER on frontier

SURFER. "It's not your typical
engineering project," said gradu
ate student Burt Lee, one of the
project's organizers. The goal of
the SURFER project is to design
and prototype a 120-pound satel
lite to be launched from the NASA
Space Shuttle in 1991.

The Stanford University Radio
Frequency Emissions Receiver, or
SURFER is the combined effort
of graduate and undergraduate
engineering students to send into
space a satellite designed com
pletely by students. If SURFER
succeeds, it will be the first satel
lite built at Stanford.
"This project is not part of any
class," said George Chen, a grad
uate student working on SUR
FER. Chen said the project runs
on donated time and equipment.
During the past two years, more
than 70 students from the Engi
neering Department have partic
ipated in the project, according to
Dave Lauben, head of SURFER's
science team.
The satellite, which is now al
most through the design phase,
is a part of the Tethered Satellite
System 1 experiment. TSS-1 is
being conducted jointly by NASA
and the Italian space agency,

Aeritalia, and will cost $4.4 mil
lion.
The TSS-1 scientists hope to
discover if a copper wire being
pulled through the Earth's mag
netic field can generate enough
electricity to power a small satel
lite. NASA expects the process to
generate approximately 5,000
watts of power, which may be
enough to accomplish that task.
In a 1991 shuttle mission,
NASA will unreel a 12-mile copper
wire coated with Teflon insulation
from the payload of the spacecraft
that will measure the potential
electrical power. This tether will
connect the shuttle to an Italian
built satellite and will be used to
collect electrical power. The
designers hope that the tether will
indicate whether usable electricity
can be generated in the Earth's
invisible magnetic field.
According to Lee, if enough
electricity can be generated, "the
tether will provide an alternative
way of powering satellites. They
can drop down a tether to sup
plement the use of solar panels
for power."
The SURFER satellite is shaped
like an octagonal cylinder with six
long metal sensory arms. Lauben
said these sensors will provide in
formation about the Earth's mag
netic and electrical fields that
"you cannot get here on Earth."
The students working on SUR
FER will complete the design,
build the prototype and integrate
the satellite on board the shuttle.
The team has already constructed
several mock-ups of SURFER's
interior components and systems.
SURFER began in January
1986 after Electrical Engineering
Prof. Peter Banks proposed the
idea of a free-flying satellite for
the tether experiment to his space
systems engineering class. Banks
is also the director of the Univer
sity's Space, Telecommunications

and Radio Science Laboratory.
Banks, who was on NASA's
Space and Earth Science Advisory
Committee, had helped make the
initial proposal for the TSS-1 ex
periment to NASA. That proposal
included funding for several satel
lites similar to SURFER.
NASA agreed to do the project
but would not fund the extra
satellites, so Banks suggested it
to his class as a possible project.
Lauben, who was in the class,
said the students were "very en
thusiastic" about the project but
did not know how to pursue it
after the course was over.
The students decided to form a
research group and apply for
NASA funding on their own.
NASA has granted them about
$50,000 to date, and the group
has received donations and equip
ment from IBM and other private
companies. To complete the proj
ect, the team estimates they will
need $1 million.
SURFER still must gain ap
proval from NASA to place SUR
FER on the shuttle, but the team
feels the chances are good that
the satellite will be included in
the TSS-1 experiment.
Despite all the difficulties, the
SURFER group hopes to have the
satellite completed by February
1991, the project launch date for
TSS-1. "We want it to coincide
with [Stanford's] Centennial
Celebration in 1991. Stanford in
space!" Lee said.
The SURFER project is part of
an attempt by Lee and Lauben to
establish a permanent small satel
lite research and design operation
at the University.
"There is a general need for
this type of project to educate stu
dents. We want to use SURFER
as a springboard for future space
projects. The (space) program
should be part of academics and
research at Stanford," Lee said.
