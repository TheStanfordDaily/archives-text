Studies"

Critical Legal Studies is a
peculiar offspring of the 19605.
Most CLS members, although
never having stormed Berkeley's
Sproul Hall nor burned a ROTC
building, grew up in the '60s and
were shaped by the political up
heaval of the time.
The result for legal academia
is a radical school of thought that
is often characterized as Marxist.
That is a misnomer. Its ideological
progenitor, the New Left, was
neo-Marxist, and CLS has grafted
yet another level of innovation on
standard Marxist thought, bor
rowing and transforming ideas for
its own particular uses.
Adherents of CLS, often called
"Crits," have tended to view the
law as intrinsic to the shape of
society. They dispute the main
stream view that law is a "distinct
sphere" from the larger society;
that it is merely instrumental, a
"handmaiden" to non-legal inter
ests.
"We can no longer speak

coherently of law responding to
distinct pre-legal interests once
we see how much those interests
are defined by law," writes author
Mark Kelman, who teaches
courses in property, criminal law
and legal theory at Stanford Law
School.
Law, Kelman says, describes
and legitimates the existing social
structure: "Law and society can
not be unbound." Crits therefore
look to the law and its develop
ment in order to intellectually dis
sect ("deconstruct") the larger so
ciety.
Direct association with CLS is
a relative concept. Movement
members aren't exactly card
carrying. However, perhaps for
the benefit of would-be McCar
thyites, the Yale Law Journal in
1984 published a comprehensive
bibliography of CLS work-to-date.
The list of scholars is intrigu
ing. Unsuprisingly, there's Kel
man himself, a confessed Crit.
There's Harvard's Duncan Ken
nedy — the popular guru of the
movement — a Timothy Leary
whose scathing attack on tradi
tional legal training has captured
and contributed to the disengage
ment of thousands of tuned out
law students confronted with an
intellectually empty education.
There's Robin West, who has

critiqued other Crits (such as
Kennedy) for sexism, and who,
refreshingly, makes legal argu
ments by reference to Kafka. And
there's Marc Galanter, who ex
plains why the legal system in
variably screws the "have-nots"
(deconstructionist lingo for per
sons defined by having been
screwed over). But there are also
several others, solid left-liberals
who nevertheless might not be so
comfortable at a CLS be-in.
Because of the varied intellec
tual strains that have been placed
under the CLS umbrella, it is ter
ribly hard to pin down exactly
what critical legal theory stands
for. Kelman sets out in his guide
to summarize, and also critique,
the CLS world view, and thereby
bring a semblance of order to
what is perceived by some main
stream legal scholars as a dispirit
ingly nihilistic theoretical school.
Critical legal theory is defined
to a large extent, according to Kel
man, by distinguishing itself from
"liberalism." What Kelman means
by liberalism, though, is much
broader than commonly under
stood, even by other Crits. It com
prises "the dominant post-feudal
beliefs held across all but the .. .
fringes of the political spectrum."
Liberals thus include both tradi
tional left-liberals and right-wing
libertarians. Indeed, Kelman says,
liberalism is "intellectually self
confident only in its right-wing
libertarian form."
These semantics aside, the Crits
are decidedly to the left of main
stream legal scholarship. Crits are
in fact often counterposed against
the Law and Economics school of
thought, currently in vogue
amongst mostly right-of-center
(Kelman says "liberal") scholars.
Putting the two camps under the
same roof can be dangerous: Their
debates have caused a celebrated
schism in the Harvard Law School
faculty, for example.
Law and Economics types favor
certainty-oriented formality in
the law, which they believe
promotes their overriding aim of
economic efficiency. In other

words, they support enabling
people, and especially businesses,
to rely on a straightforward and
foreseeable legal outcome so that
they can plan their prospective
economic activity.
The Crits, on the other hand,
are less concerned with building
a coherent legal infrastructure
than they are with deconstructing
and inspecting the current system
for contradictions. They believe
the form of a legal system is
related to the substance of its out
comes. Moreover, Kelman
stresses, the Crits are concerned
with what these outcomes ought
to look like.
One area in which the division
of thought is played out is deter
mining whether to prefer a "rule"
or a "standard" as a mode of law.
Take the law of statutory rape,
for example. A rule would state
that there is a certain, specific
age before which a girl can not
consent to intercourse. A stan
dard, on the other hand, would
weigh the merits of the specific
case, asking if the girl was suffi
ciently mature to consent. Crits
tend to favor standards, which are
more contextual and flexible than
mechanically applied rules.
Another area of theoretical di
vision concerns the "subjectivity
of values." Liberals, whether
rights-based theorists or Law and
Economics advocates weaned on
the idolatry of transaction costs
inquiry, are moral relativists who
attempt to divorce subjective
values from objective reasoning.
Crits, such as Roberto Unger, ar
gue that values should be objec
tified, even while recognizing that
this can only be done on an "his
torically contingent, non
universal" basis. Kelman is un
satisfied with Unger's formula
tion, but is sympathetic to the
underlying critique.
Critical legal scholars also reject
liberal "intentionalism" — the ex
tent to which liberal rules empha
size human free will and its corol
lary ethical duties. In considering,
for example, whether to attach
blame to criminal conduct or to

attribute crime to "anthropomor
phized background conditions,"
Crits are more likely to embrace
the latter, "determinist" ap
proach.
This determinism leads CLS
theorists to the conclusion that
"What people choose need not be
what they want." This is because
market system choice is inher
ently not free choice due to subtle
but pervasive coercion underlying
both public and private relation
ships. Crits try to uncover real
choice, Kelman explains, by per
forming "deconstruction of the
self." Kelman considers this ex
ercise futile and can not under
stand why many Crits find it im
portant.
Such "deconstruction" is im
portant, though, because it ex
plains the CLS skepticism of legal
institutions. Kelman laments the
"deification of profess" engaged
in by certain liberal scholars, by
which he means an over-placed
faith in a msyoritarian, democratic
system with calibrated checks and
balances to assure proper legal
outcomes.
The Crits, "being more tradi
tionally Marxist in this regard
than any other," stress "disem
powerment" instead. Crits believe
that the masses of people who
don't participate in the political

process cannot be deemed to ac
quiesce in decisions made on their
behalf; they are rather "discour
aged, disengaged .. . withdrawn
because they are aware that they
would be unable to bring their
distinct agendas to fruition."
As for the Crits themselves,
they do not seem to have their
own specific agenda, nor do they
appear to mind that they don't.
Deconstruction (or "trashing," as
Kelman puts it) is their forte and
primary concern. Consequently,
CLS has been lampooned by some
traditional leftist lawyers as an
ivory-tower movement of elite law
professors entirely preoccupied
with incestuous theoretical dis
course to the exclusion of "dirty"
pragmatic work.
They may have a point. Kel
man's book advertises itself as a
guide to CLS. However, it is clear
that its intended audience is the
already-initiated; the book is in
sular and inaccessible to non
academics. The prose, although
frequently lively, is usually dense,
obtuse and jargon-filled, and at
times is simply impenetrable.
Kelman's mind is clearly in
cisive, so perhaps it's that he's
operating on his own strato
spheric intellectual plane. But
guides are supposed to be practi
cal, and this one just isn't.

theorists to the conclusion that

Such "deconstruction" is im

"A Guide to Critical Legal
Studies"

Critical Legal Studies is a
peculiar offspring of the 19605.
Most CLS members, although
never having stormed Berkeley's
Sproul Hall nor burned a ROTC
building, grew up in the '60s and
were shaped by the political up
heaval of the time.
The result for legal academia
is a radical school of thought that
is often characterized as Marxist.
That is a misnomer. Its ideological
progenitor, the New Left, was
neo-Marxist, and CLS has grafted
yet another level of innovation on
standard Marxist thought, bor
rowing and transforming ideas for
its own particular uses.
Adherents of CLS, often called
"Crits," have tended to view the
law as intrinsic to the shape of
society. They dispute the main
stream view that law is a "distinct
sphere" from the larger society;
that it is merely instrumental, a
"handmaiden" to non-legal inter
ests.
"We can no longer speak

coherently of law responding to
distinct pre-legal interests once
we see how much those interests
are defined by law," writes author
Mark Kelman, who teaches
courses in property, criminal law
and legal theory at Stanford Law
School.
Law, Kelman says, describes
and legitimates the existing social
structure: "Law and society can
not be unbound." Crits therefore
look to the law and its develop
ment in order to intellectually dis
sect ("deconstruct") the larger so
ciety.
Direct association with CLS is
a relative concept. Movement
members aren't exactly card
carrying. However, perhaps for
the benefit of would-be McCar
thyites, the Yale Law Journal in
1984 published a comprehensive
bibliography of CLS work-to-date.
The list of scholars is intrigu
ing. Unsuprisingly, there's Kel
man himself, a confessed Crit.
There's Harvard's Duncan Ken
nedy — the popular guru of the
movement — a Timothy Leary
whose scathing attack on tradi
tional legal training has captured
and contributed to the disengage
ment of thousands of tuned out
law students confronted with an
intellectually empty education.
There's Robin West, who has

critiqued other Crits (such as
Kennedy) for sexism, and who,
refreshingly, makes legal argu
ments by reference to Kafka. And
there's Marc Galanter, who ex
plains why the legal system in
variably screws the "have-nots"
(deconstructionist lingo for per
sons defined by having been
screwed over). But there are also
several others, solid left-liberals
who nevertheless might not be so
comfortable at a CLS be-in.
Because of the varied intellec
tual strains that have been placed
under the CLS umbrella, it is ter
ribly hard to pin down exactly
what critical legal theory stands
for. Kelman sets out in his guide
to summarize, and also critique,
the CLS world view, and thereby
bring a semblance of order to
what is perceived by some main
stream legal scholars as a dispirit
ingly nihilistic theoretical school.
Critical legal theory is defined
to a large extent, according to Kel
man, by distinguishing itself from
"liberalism." What Kelman means
by liberalism, though, is much
broader than commonly under
stood, even by other Crits. It com
prises "the dominant post-feudal
beliefs held across all but the .. .
fringes of the political spectrum."
Liberals thus include both tradi
tional left-liberals and right-wing
libertarians. Indeed, Kelman says,
liberalism is "intellectually self
confident only in its right-wing
libertarian form."
These semantics aside, the Crits
are decidedly to the left of main
stream legal scholarship. Crits are
in fact often counterposed against
the Law and Economics school of
thought, currently in vogue
amongst mostly right-of-center
(Kelman says "liberal") scholars.
Putting the two camps under the
same roof can be dangerous: Their
debates have caused a celebrated
schism in the Harvard Law School
faculty, for example.
Law and Economics types favor
certainty-oriented formality in
the law, which they believe
promotes their overriding aim of
economic efficiency. In other

words, they support enabling
people, and especially businesses,
to rely on a straightforward and
foreseeable legal outcome so that
they can plan their prospective
economic activity.
The Crits, on the other hand,
are less concerned with building
a coherent legal infrastructure
than they are with deconstructing
and inspecting the current system
for contradictions. They believe
the form of a legal system is
related to the substance of its out
comes. Moreover, Kelman
stresses, the Crits are concerned
with what these outcomes ought
to look like.
One area in which the division
of thought is played out is deter
mining whether to prefer a "rule"
or a "standard" as a mode of law.
Take the law of statutory rape,
for example. A rule would state
that there is a certain, specific
age before which a girl can not
consent to intercourse. A stan
dard, on the other hand, would
weigh the merits of the specific
case, asking if the girl was suffi
ciently mature to consent. Crits
tend to favor standards, which are
more contextual and flexible than
mechanically applied rules.
Another area of theoretical di
vision concerns the "subjectivity
of values." Liberals, whether
rights-based theorists or Law and
Economics advocates weaned on
the idolatry of transaction costs
inquiry, are moral relativists who
attempt to divorce subjective
values from objective reasoning.
Crits, such as Roberto Unger, ar

this can only be done on an "his

and contributed to the disengage
ment of thousands of tuned out
law students confronted with an
intellectually empty education.
There's Robin West, who has

critiqued other Crits (such as
Kennedy) for sexism, and who,
refreshingly, makes legal argu
ments by reference to Kafka. And
there's Marc Galanter, who ex
plains why the legal system in
variably screws the "have-nots"
(deconstructionist lingo for per
sons defined by having been
screwed over). But there are also
several others, solid left-liberals
who nevertheless might not be so
comfortable at a CLS be-in.
Because of the varied intellec
tual strains that have been placed
under the CLS umbrella, it is ter
ribly hard to pin down exactly
what critical legal theory stands
for. Kelman sets out in his guide
to summarize, and also critique,
the CLS world view, and thereby
bring a semblance of order to
what is perceived by some main
stream legal scholars as a dispirit
ingly nihilistic theoretical school.
Critical legal theory is defined
to a large extent, according to Kel
man, by distinguishing itself from
"liberalism." What Kelman means
by liberalism, though, is much
broader than commonly under
stood, even by other Crits. It com
prises "the dominant post-feudal
beliefs held across all but the .. .
fringes of the political spectrum."
Liberals thus include both tradi
tional left-liberals and right-wing
libertarians. Indeed, Kelman says,
liberalism is "intellectually self
confident only in its right-wing
libertarian form."
These semantics aside, the Crits
are decidedly to the left of main
stream legal scholarship. Crits are
in fact often counterposed against
the Law and Economics school of
thought, currently in vogue
amongst mostly right-of-center
(Kelman says "liberal") scholars.
Putting the two camps under the
same roof can be dangerous: Their
debates have caused a celebrated
schism in the Harvard Law School
faculty, for example.
Law and Economics types favor
certainty-oriented formality in
the law, which they believe
promotes their overriding aim of
economic efficiency. In other

words, they support enabling
people, and especially businesses,
to rely on a straightforward and
foreseeable legal outcome so that
they can plan their prospective
economic activity.
The Crits, on the other hand,
are less concerned with building
a coherent legal infrastructure
than they are with deconstructing
and inspecting the current system
for contradictions. They believe
the form of a legal system is
related to the substance of its out
comes. Moreover, Kelman
stresses, the Crits are concerned
with what these outcomes ought
to look like.
One area in which the division
of thought is played out is deter
mining whether to prefer a "rule"
or a "standard" as a mode of law.
Take the law of statutory rape,
for example. A rule would state
that there is a certain, specific
age before which a girl can not
consent to intercourse. A stan
dard, on the other hand, would
weigh the merits of the specific
case, asking if the girl was suffi
ciently mature to consent. Crits
tend to favor standards, which are
more contextual and flexible than
mechanically applied rules.
Another area of theoretical di
vision concerns the "subjectivity
of values." Liberals, whether
rights-based theorists or Law and
Economics advocates weaned on
the idolatry of transaction costs
inquiry, are moral relativists who
attempt to divorce subjective
values from objective reasoning.
Crits, such as Roberto Unger, ar
gue that values should be objec
tified, even while recognizing that
this can only be done on an "his
torically contingent, non
universal" basis. Kelman is un
satisfied with Unger's formula
tion, but is sympathetic to the
underlying critique.
Critical legal scholars also reject
liberal "intentionalism" — the ex
tent to which liberal rules empha
size human free will and its corol
lary ethical duties. In considering,
for example, whether to attach
blame to criminal conduct or to

attribute crime to "anthropomor
phized background conditions,"
Crits are more likely to embrace
the latter, "determinist" ap
proach.
This determinism leads CLS
theorists to the conclusion that
"What people choose need not be
what they want." This is because
market system choice is inher
ently not free choice due to subtle
but pervasive coercion underlying
both public and private relation
ships. Crits try to uncover real
choice, Kelman explains, by per
forming "deconstruction of the
self." Kelman considers this ex
ercise futile and can not under
stand why many Crits find it im
portant.
Such "deconstruction" is im
portant, though, because it ex
plains the CLS skepticism of legal
institutions. Kelman laments the
"deification of profess" engaged
in by certain liberal scholars, by
which he means an over-placed
faith in a msyoritarian, democratic
system with calibrated checks and
balances to assure proper legal
outcomes.
The Crits, "being more tradi
tionally Marxist in this regard
than any other," stress "disem
powerment" instead. Crits believe
that the masses of people who
don't participate in the political

process cannot be deemed to ac
quiesce in decisions made on their
behalf; they are rather "discour
aged, disengaged .. . withdrawn
because they are aware that they
would be unable to bring their
distinct agendas to fruition."
As for the Crits themselves,
they do not seem to have their
own specific agenda, nor do they
appear to mind that they don't.
Deconstruction (or "trashing," as
Kelman puts it) is their forte and
primary concern. Consequently,
CLS has been lampooned by some
traditional leftist lawyers as an
ivory-tower movement of elite law
professors entirely preoccupied
with incestuous theoretical dis
course to the exclusion of "dirty"
pragmatic work.
They may have a point. Kel
man's book advertises itself as a
guide to CLS. However, it is clear
that its intended audience is the
already-initiated; the book is in
sular and inaccessible to non
academics. The prose, although
frequently lively, is usually dense,
obtuse and jargon-filled, and at
times is simply impenetrable.
Kelman's mind is clearly in
cisive, so perhaps it's that he's
operating on his own strato
spheric intellectual plane. But
guides are supposed to be practi
cal, and this one just isn't.
