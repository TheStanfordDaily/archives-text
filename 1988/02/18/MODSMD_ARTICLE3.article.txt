# Western Culture debate set to enter final phase
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
With meyor issues still unresolved, the
Faculty Senate will continue to debate
the Western Culture requirement today
but is unlikely to take a final vote, ac
cording to sources close to the issue.
There are three points of contention.
• First, should the program require a
core list of readings, and, if so, what
readings should the list include?
• Second, should the course be histori
cally comprehensive? That is, should the
program focus on the last 600 to 800
years, or should the ancient period be
included as well?
• Third, should the study of a non-
Western culture be included in there

quirement?
Classics and Comparative Literature
Prof. Gregson Davis, a member of the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
said a number of amendments are being
worked on thpt are "friendly" to the CUS
proposal. He said the amendments "add
a sentence or two (to the proposal) which
may lead to further compromise," but
that the CUS has "incorporated a number
of changes in the spirit of compromise"
already.
In a similar vein, Barry Katz, a lecturer
in Values, Technology, Science and So
ciety, said he had a "very strong feeiing
[that people] want to avoid a cliffhanger
vote." Attempts will be made to "make
everyone feel that they won."
To that end, Philosophy Prof. Michael

Bratman and English and Comparative
Literature Prof. Herbert Lindenberger
will attempt to placate opponents of the
CUS plan. They will submit an amend
ment today that calls for a review of the
Cultures, Ideas and Values program —
the proposed replacement for Western
Culture — in three years.
The review will attempt to make sure
that the absence of a core list has not
led to "disintegration [of the program]
into eight or 10 separate courses," Katz
said.
In addition, English Prof. William
Chace predicted at a debate last night
that the senate will amend the proposal
to ensure historical comprehensiveness.
But, there is little chance for compro
mise on the question of the core list.

"Frankly I fail to see what further com
promise is necessary," Davis said. He
noted that the Bratman-Lindenberger
amendment provides for a review to de
termine whether the elimination of the
core will prevent freshmen from sharing
a "common intellectual experience."
If a review comes to that conclusion,
the senate "may [then] amend (the pro
gram) to restore the core list."
Senate Chair Gerald Leiberman also
noted that two minor issues remain un
resolved at this point. The first is the
issue of governance: Who will sit on the
committee that will oversee the new re
quirement?
Second is a question still at issue,
whether the course should focus on the
roots of American culture or on Western

culture in its entirety.
The first stage of today's meeting will
be a continuation of the last meeting,
two weeks ago. Various members of the
faculty will be given a chance to voice
their opinions on the issues.
Then, according to Leiberman, the sen
ate will enter into a "committee of the
whole" in order to discuss specific aspects
of the CUS proposal. In a "committee of
the whole," the entire legislative body —
in this case all members of the Faculty
Senate — considers whether to add any
amendments to legislation before calling
a vote.
In committee, Leiberman said, the
members of the senate will discuss seven
pre-prepared questions covering the con
tentious issues.
