## Winter IM teams geared for playoffs 
### 
Coming around the last turn,
it looks like Smith-Barney, fol
lowed by Seniority Rule 3 and
Blue Bomber Again on the out
side ....

No, it's not a horse race, but
rather the winter intramural
leagues heating up. With only
one regular season game left
for some teams, and the
playoffs looming, The Daily
takes a look at the champion
ship contenders.
In the glamour sport of win
ter IMs, A-league basketball,
Smith-Barney looks like a
strong bet to defend the title.
Last year the investors were
freshmen from Otero and
Madera. And in a game where
freshmen don't usually belong,
they defeated a team called
Credulence (reportedly a group
of old Sigma Chi's) for the
trophy.
"They thoroughly de
molished a frat team in the
final," intramural office guru
Dave Shuey said.
One of the players on that
"frat" team was former Cardi
nal quarterback John Paye.
"We actually expected him to
be better than he was," Smith-
Barney member Matt Walker
said yesterday.
"I don't think we were the
most talented team out there,"
Walker said. "We just play very
well together."
Hence the team name. They
win the old fashioned way ....
Shuey and intramural chief

Charlie Montoya expect
Seniority Rules (whose only
loss was by three points to
Smith-Barney) and Blue
Bomber Again to provide the
main competition for the A
league crown. Last year Blue
Bomber won the B-league title.
With the departure of its
defending champ, B-league is
wide open this year. According
to Montoya, the teams SBS and
ZAP, who played once already
with SBS winning in overtime,
are the co-favorites. If you are
wondering what SBS stands
for, concentrate hard for a mo
ment.
Yup, it's probably a clever
attempt to disguise the fact
that these guys are from the
business school. Boy, those biz
school athletes are ingenious.
Anyway, X-factor, 8-Ways
and Suite Stuff will also chal
lenge, says Shuey, who hap
pens to spearhead the Suite
Stuff attack with his rim
rattling dunks.
"It's tough to call B-league,
but this is the stiffest compe
tition in a while," Shuey said.
Moving to a different type of
ballgame, Sam's Scrubs are
seeded No. 1 in the A-league
soccer playoffs, which were
posted yesterday. Biz 1-A is
seeded second, and through a
stroke of creative scheduling,
Biz Killers (the defending A
champions) will play in the A
league playoffs even though
they played the regular season
in the B-league.
The top four B-league seeds
are Scrubs 84, Lipman Bears,
Toyon 87 and Lambda Nu. And
in coed soccer, Toyon 87, Biz
Killers, Whitless and Robinson
Reunited are the cream of the
crop.
Finally, the intramural cur
ling tourney was postponed due
to clement weather.
