Big Game fever
returns to the
Farm tomorrow
night, and the
Stanford women's
basketball team
couldn't be hap-

pier.
Coming off last week's victory
over the then-Pacific 10 Confer
ence leader Washington — the
biggest win in team history — the
Cardinal faces California tonight
at 7:30 in Maples Pavilion. X-TV
will cover the action live with a
simulcast on KZSU FM 90.1, and

Pac-10
School Record Overall
Stanford 10-1 22- 1
Washington 9-1 17- 3
USC 8-2 14- 5
UCLA 6-4 13- 9
Oregon 5-7 12-10
Oregon State 5-7 10-12
California 4-7 8-12
Washington St. 3-7 7-13
Arizona State 2-9 7-13
Arizona 2-9 5-16

Stanford currently enjoys its
first single-digit ranking at No. 9
on the Associated Press poll with
an incredible 22-1 record and an
eight-game winning streak. In ad
dition, the Cardinal holds the top
spot in the Pac-10 with a 10-1
mark and is virtually assured of
an NCAA tournament bid.
The Golden Bears are not that
fortunate, stuck in the bottom
half of the league with a 4-7
record, 13-10 overall. However,
Cal is far from impotent.
"They're not that big, but they
play very hard and very scrappy,"
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "I don't think they're in a

position to win the Pac-10 —
they've lost too many games —
but they're definitely a spoiler
type team.
"Cal plays an aggressive,
scrappy style of basketball, and I
think that people would enjoy
watching the game. We'll look to
run and beat them on the boards.
I expect a really tough game, a
good game."
Cal freshman center Teresa
Palmisano, who scored 22 points
when Stanford beat the Bears 95-
71 in Berkeley last month, could
quickly rain on a complacent Car
dinal's parade. Behind senior for
ward Amanda Ray, Palmisano is
one of Cal's biggest guns.
"We're going to have to shut
her down, stop her driving," soph
omore forward Katy Steding said.
"She drives left and then she
takes a little hook shot, so I'll
just keep her on the other side
of the court."
Cal junior guard Meme Fanner
could also give Stanford trouble,
especially sophomore guard Jen
nifer Azzi. In the last contest,
Fanner stuck to Azzi like glue,
fouling out of the game in the
process.
"She was kind of a gnat," Van-
Derveer said. "She puts good pres
sure on the ball, and she was up
all over Jennifer. I think we're
ready for that more."
After last weekend's contest
with Washington State, the Car
dinal is also ready for the junk
defenses that Cal will probably
employ. "They threw us a junk
defense last time with a chaser
and a triangle-and-two on (fresh
man guard) Sonja (Henning) and
Jennifer," the Cardinal coach
recalled. "We need to counter that
type of defense.
"I think the keys will be hard
defense, rebounding and our tran
sition game. I think those things
spell exciting basketball.
"Student support meant so
much to us against Washington,
and I hope we get some students
who are rowdy," VanDerveer said.

The Pac-10-leading women's basketball team this season has
catapulted to No. 9 In the country, the highest ranking in Cardinal
history, and freshman guard Sonja Henning, who scored a career
high 27 points last Saturday against Washington State, is one big
reason Stanford is almost assured an NCAA bid.

type team.
"Cal plays an aggressive,
scrappy style of basketball, and I
think that people would enjoy
watching the game. We'll look to
run and beat them on the boards.
I expect a really tough game, a
good game."
Cal freshman center Teresa
Palmisano, who scored 22 points
when Stanford beat the Bears 95-
71 in Berkeley last month, could
quickly rain on a complacent Car
dinal's parade. Behind senior for
ward Amanda Ray, Palmisano is
one of Cal's biggest guns.
"We're going to have to shut
her down, stop her driving," soph
omore forward Katy Steding said.
"She drives left and then she
takes a little hook shot, so I'll
just keep her on the other side
of the court."
Cal junior guard Meme Fanner
could also give Stanford trouble,
especially sophomore guard Jen
nifer Azzi. In the last contest,
Fanner stuck to Azzi like glue,
fouling out of the game in the
process.
"She was kind of a gnat," Van-
Derveer said. "She puts good pres
sure on the ball, and she was up
all over Jennifer. I think we're
ready for that more."
After last weekend's contest
with Washington State, the Car
dinal is also ready for the junk
defenses that Cal will probably
employ. "They threw us a junk
defense last time with a chaser
and a triangle-and-two on (fresh
man guard) Sonja (Henning) and
Jennifer," the Cardinal coach
recalled. "We need to counter that
type of defense.
"I think the keys will be hard
defense, rebounding and our tran
sition game. I think those things
spell exciting basketball.
"Student support meant so
much to us against Washington,
and I hope we get some students
who are rowdy," VanDerveer said.

The Pac-10-leading women's basketball team this season has
catapulted to No. 9 In the country, the highest ranking in Cardinal
history, and freshman guard Sonja Henning, who scored a career
high 27 points last Saturday against Washington State, is one big
reason Stanford is almost assured an NCAA bid.
