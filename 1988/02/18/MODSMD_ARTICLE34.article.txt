Jodi Figley con
tinued her assault
on collegiate golf
this past week,
shooting an

amazing final-round 72 to move
from eighth into second place at
the Arizona Intercollegiate in
Tucson.
Had she made the four or five
putts she felt she could have
made, she would have won. "I
figured I'd have to shoot a 69 (to
win)," she said. "I had nothing to
lose, so I went for it."

Her prediction was right on the
nose. Her three-day total of 221
was three strokes behind Texas'
Michiko Hattori, whom most
regard as the top amateur in the
world. Hattori also won her last
tournament, played two weeks
ago at USC.
"Jodi birdied the ninth and
18th holes — the two toughest
holes on the course," an enthusi
astic Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin
said. "For 54 holes she shot some
terrific golf."
"It feels good," Figley said of
her "surprise" finish.
"I am so proud of her (Figley),"
Baldwin said. "Everything about
her is terrific."
Tied with Figley for second

were Tracy Nakamura of USC
and New Mexico's Tara Fleming.
Jeanne Walker of San Diego State
and Allison and Susan Shapcott
of U.S. International all shot 223.
Allison Shapcott is the defending
British Amateur Champion.
Rounding out the top 10 were
Cece Styder of New Mexico State,
Wendy Modick of SDSU, and
Texas' Sue Ginter, who tied for
eighth at 224.
Texas, with two top-10 finish
ers, including the tournament
medalist, won the team title going
away at 895, 10 strokes ahead of
New Mexico and New Mexico
State.
San Diego State, also with two
top-10 scorers, was another

suprise, finishing fourth at 909.
Arizona's "A" team was a stroke
back at 910, and led by the Shap
cott sisters USIU just missed the
top five with a 911. USC's
seventh-place 914 rounded out
the top group.
The next two teams, UCLA and
Arizona "B," finished a full 18
strokes behind USC, with Wash
ington in 10th at 935.
Stanford's final-round 301 was
the lowest round of the day, and
moved them past Brigham Young
and into 11th place with a three
day total of 939.
The team can feel very good
about its last day in particular.
Senior and team leader Kay Cor
nelius was forced to withdraw

from the tournament due to ill
ness on Monday.
But the players responded well,
especially on the final round,
which generally features the
toughest pin placements and puts
the tee blocks as far back as they
can go.
"I think it was a real confidence
builder for them (the players),"
Baldwin said. "From a very dis
appointing trip, we made a pretty
good finish."
"We were pretty down about
Kay (Cornelius) being sick," said
freshman Kristin Ryan, who shot
77 on the final day to finish at
240.
According to Ryan and Baldwin,
Cornelius' absence probably cost

the team 20 strokes.
"Everyone played well today,"
Ryan said. "Today was the first
round where I think I played
well."
"Stephanie (Parel) showed
some good stuff today, despite a
cold putter," Baldwin said. She
carded a final round 75 to go with
80 and 81 on the previous two
days to finish at a strong 236.
Michele Lyford (83-82-77) also
played well yesterday. She shot
significantly better in her final
round for the second straight
tournament, and according to
Baldwin it is just a matter of time
before her confidence in her swing
will lower her scores.

good finish."
"We were pretty down about
Kay (Cornelius) being sick," said
freshman Kristin Ryan, who shot
77 on the final day to finish at
240.
According to Ryan and Baldwin,
Cornelius' absence probably cost

the team 20 strokes.
"Everyone played well today,"
Ryan said. "Today was the first
round where I think I played
well."
"Stephanie (Parel) showed
some good stuff today, despite a
cold putter," Baldwin said. She
carded a final round 75 to go with
80 and 81 on the previous two
days to finish at a strong 236.
Michele Lyford (83-82-77) also
played well yesterday. She shot
significantly better in her final
round for the second straight
tournament, and according to
Baldwin it is just a matter of time
before her confidence in her swing
will lower her scores.
