# Men's tennis leaves for National Indoors
## 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
After four easy dual-match
wins against mediocre com
petition, it's evaluation time
for the Stanford men's ten
nis team.
The Cardinal, top-ranked
with Georgia with an un-

tested 4-0 season record to its credit, starts
the talent-laden National Indoor Team
Championships today against Kentucky at
8 p.m. in Louisville in a measure of where
it stacks up against the rest of the nation.
With a field mirroring the NCAAs, the
tournament runs through Sunday and in
cludes each of the nation's top-10 teams,
including top seed and defending national
champion Georgia. Stanford is the second
seed.
Although the Cardinal isn't seeded No.
1, if last weekend's Northern California
Intercollegiate Championships were any in
dication, Stanford could well be the team
to beat. Jeff Tarango, Patrick McEnroe,
Martin Blackman, Jeff Cathrall and Barry
Richards all reached the quarterfinals in
the singles draw, with Tarango nabbing
the title.
"With the exception of a couple matches,
we had a very good NorCal tournament,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said. "My goal
in this weekend's tournament is for us to
compete well as a team — to think on the
court and get better each time we play."
The host team Kentucky, ranked 14th
nationally, will pose a strong threat to the
Cardinal, led by the nation's No. 16 singles
player, Greg Van Emburgh, and the fourth
rated doubles tandem in Emburgh and
Richard Benson. Kentucky also owns a
recent win over ninth-rated Clemson.

'We all think we can win It
(the title). I think it will be
tougher to get to the
finals than it will be to
beat Georgia. Looking
down the lineup, I think
we'll annihiliate Georgia.'

To advance past the first round, the
Wildcats defeated Oklahoma State yester
day 5-3. Stanford had a first-round bye.
Peering ahead in the indoor field,
seventh-rated South Carolina, No. 10 Ten
nessee, No. 6 UCLA and No. 3 USC loom
for the Cardinal in its half of the draw.
"I think everyone is playing real well,"
McEnroe said. "We have a pretty tough
draw but I think everyone is looking ahead
to this."
Based on his three-set squeaker over
McEnroe in the NorCal finals Tuesday,
Tarango will assume the No. 1 singles po
sition. McEnroe, Blackman, Cathrall,
freshman Glenn Solomon and Richards fol
low Tarango in singles.
In doubles action, Gould will send the
McEnroe-Blackman pair out at No. 1,
Tarango and freshman David Wheaton at
No. 2 and Cathrall and Eric Peus at third
doubles.
"We all think we can win it (the title),"
Tarango said. "I think it will be tougher
to get to the finals than it will be to beat
Georgia. Looking down the lineup, I think
we'll annihilate Georgia."

If the results of the Hobee's Northern California Intercollegiate Tournament are any
indication, freshman Martin Blackman and his Cardinal teammates will go a long
way this year.
