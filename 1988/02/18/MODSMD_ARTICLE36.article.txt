When the sailing
team takes to the
waters of Redwood
City this weekend
for the first two
regattas of the
Northern Sailing

__ n
Series, each race will count
toward a number of the team's
goals.
In the short run, Stanford is
after a pair of victories at the first
two events of the nine-regatta se
ries that will determine the top
Northern California sailing team.
Twelve skipper and crew combi
nations will be sailing for the Car
dinal, including the team's stand
out seniors who won regatta after
regatta last fall. With that many
sailors competing on their home
waters, Stanford is confident that
it can at least keep up with any
challenger.
"We do the best when he have
the whole team out competing at
once. The support we give each
other makes it easier to sail fast,"
said Stanford crew Kathleen
Mallery, a senior.
Looking further ahead, the Car
dinal hopes that a strong perform
ance in this weekend's regattas

will get it started toward an over
all win in the Northern Series,
which will stretch on over the
next two months. Each of the
series' nine regattas counts in de
termining the Northern Califor
nian champion, and, in the past,
the competition has been close
enough that each regatta made a
difference. Remembering last
year, when they let California get
an early jump and a substantial
early lead in the series, the Stan
ford team is determined to lead

right from the start.
"We're determined to get this
North Series. We've narrowed our
focus and we've decided that this
is what we want. Now we have
to sail well enough to get it,"
senior co-captain Gina Ottoboni
said.
In the very long run, Stanford
knows that the fight for this
year's national championship
begins this weekend when the top
Californian teams begin to battle
for recognition as the No. 1 west
coast team. In a sport that is as
psychological as it is physical, a
team's image is vitally important.
The Cardinal wants to establish
itself as the team to beat, and it

knows that to do that it must sail
especially well in this season's
early regattas.
"We have to show the other
teams that we deserve their
respect," said Stanford Coach
Blake Middleton.
This year, the Cardinal is
paying more attention than usual
to the national championships be
cause, for the first time, Stanford
will be hosting that end-of-the
season event. In conjunction with
the Richmond Yacht Club, the
Cardinal will be staging two
weeks' worth of races to deter
mine the best team and individual
sailors from across the United
States.
