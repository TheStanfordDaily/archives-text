# Stanford nine outruns San Francisco, 5-3
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The Stanford base
ball team contin
ues to stockpile
arms.
After dusting off
sophomore Robbie
Kamerschen for

his first appearance of the season
Tuesday against Hayward State,
the Cardinal brought out Bryan
Keyser for the first time yesterday
against the University of San
Francisco.
The junior right-hander, com
ing off an elbow injury suffered
just before the season began,
started and went four innings,
combining with Mark Carper and
Steve Chitren to six-hit the Dons
as Stanford snuck to a 5-3 win
at Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal's season record
goes to 7-5 as the team readies
for a big series with UC-Santa
Barbara this weekend.
Keyser's showing was good
news for the Cardinal, which is
still seeking to solidify the third
spot in its starting rotation before
Pacific 10 Southern Division play
begins next Friday at USC.

"We're real happy to have him
back," pitching coach Tom Dun
ton said. "The big thing is that
he threw pain-free. Naturally he
was a little rusty, and a little tired,
but he's well on the way back."
"I felt pretty good," Keyser said.
"I'm still not at full pitching
strength ... I started to tire in
the third and fourth. ... I was
nervous at first — I wasn't sure
how my elbow was going to react
to throwing in live competition."
Keyser held the Dons scoreless
for two, and got a one-run cushion
when designated hitter Jeff
Saenger unloaded his second
home run of the year, a shot over
the right-field fence. The Dons
pulled even in the third on a rare
fielding error by first baseman
Ron Witmeyer and two wild
pitches by Keyser.
Stanford took the lead back in
the bottom of the inning. Frank
Carey led off with an infield single
and ended up on second when
Don shortstop Ernie Heath un
corked a throw in the general di
rection of the recently completed
Bud D. Klein Varsity Clubhouse.
Troy Paulsen advanced Carey to
third with a groundout to second,
and when Ron Witmeyer ripped

a shot to third, Carey cruised
home on the throw to first.
Nursing a 2-1 lead, Keyser
began to show signs of fatigue in
the fourth. Arnie Sambel led off
with a long drive to left that
looked like it would curve harm
lessly foul. But the ball, as if held
aloft by a charmed wind, contin
ued to carry and hooked just in
side the foul pole for a home run
that tied the game.
"I threw kind of a lazy slider,"
Keyser said. "But I couldn't be
lieve that ball went out."
The Dons continued their as
sault on the left-field foul line,
with Dean Jeffries squirting a ball
over third base for a double. When
Heath lined a single into center,
Jeffries came around to score and
put USF up 3-2.
Keyser helped his own cause by
picking Heath off first for the
second out of the inning, then
induced Dan Barbara to pop up
weakly to stem any further
damage.
The pick-off was the second of
the game for Keyser, who also
caught Mike Campas straying to
far off first in the third inning.
Keyser picked off three runners
while pitching for the Cardinal in

the Taipei International Tourna
ment in Taiwan last December.
If his pitching was at all rusty
yesterday, his move to first cer
tainly wasn't.
Carper came on in the fifth and
shut out the Dons for four in
nings, giving up only two hits.
The Cardinal offense, mean
while, started scraping for runs

off Dons starter Duffy Aceret.
Centerfielder Eric DeGraw led off
the bottom of the fifth with a
squibber to second and dove head
first into first for an infield single.
Frank Carey took DeGraw's place
on a fielder's choice, and after
two walks the bases were packed
with one out. Carey came home
on a hard grounder to short by

junior Ed Sprague to tie the game
at 3-3, but that was all the Car
dinal could get out of the inning.
Stanford manufactured two
more runs in the seventh on an
infield single by Saenger, an error,
a single by Eric Cox, a sacrifice
bunt by DeGraw and a sacrifice
fly by Frank Carey, to make the
score 5-3.

Frank Carey took DeGraw's place
on a fielder's choice, and after
two walks the bases were packed
with one out. Carey came home
on a hard grounder to short by

junior Ed Sprague to tie the game
at 3-3, but that was all the Car
dinal could get out of the inning.
Stanford manufactured two
more runs in the seventh on an
infield single by Saenger, an error,
a single by Eric Cox, a sacrifice
bunt by DeGraw and a sacrifice
fly by Frank Carey, to make the
score 5-3.

After dusting off
sophomore Robbie
Kamerschen for

his first appearance of the season
Tuesday against Hayward State,
the Cardinal brought out Bryan
Keyser for the first time yesterday
against the University of San
Francisco.
The junior right-hander, com
ing off an elbow injury suffered
just before the season began,
started and went four innings,
combining with Mark Carper and
Steve Chitren to six-hit the Dons
as Stanford snuck to a 5-3 win
at Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal's season record
goes to 7-5 as the team readies
for a big series with UC-Santa
Barbara this weekend.
Keyser's showing was good
news for the Cardinal, which is
still seeking to solidify the third
spot in its starting rotation before
Pacific 10 Southern Division play
begins next Friday at USC.

"We're real happy to have him
back," pitching coach Tom Dun
ton said. "The big thing is that
he threw pain-free. Naturally he
was a little rusty, and a little tired,
but he's well on the way back."
"I felt pretty good," Keyser said.
"I'm still not at full pitching
strength ... I started to tire in
the third and fourth. ... I was
nervous at first — I wasn't sure
how my elbow was going to react
to throwing in live competition."
Keyser held the Dons scoreless
for two, and got a one-run cushion
when designated hitter Jeff
Saenger unloaded his second
home run of the year, a shot over
the right-field fence. The Dons
pulled even in the third on a rare
fielding error by first baseman
Ron Witmeyer and two wild
pitches by Keyser.
Stanford took the lead back in
the bottom of the inning. Frank
Carey led off with an infield single
and ended up on second when
Don shortstop Ernie Heath un
corked a throw in the general di
rection of the recently completed
Bud D. Klein Varsity Clubhouse.
Troy Paulsen advanced Carey to
third with a groundout to second,
and when Ron Witmeyer ripped

a shot to third, Carey cruised
home on the throw to first.
Nursing a 2-1 lead, Keyser
began to show signs of fatigue in
the fourth. Arnie Sambel led off
with a long drive to left that
looked like it would curve harm
lessly foul. But the ball, as if held
aloft by a charmed wind, contin
ued to carry and hooked just in
side the foul pole for a home run
that tied the game.
"I threw kind of a lazy slider,"
Keyser said. "But I couldn't be
lieve that ball went out."
The Dons continued their as
sault on the left-field foul line,
with Dean Jeffries squirting a ball
over third base for a double. When
Heath lined a single into center,
Jeffries came around to score and
put USF up 3-2.
Keyser helped his own cause by
picking Heath off first for the
second out of the inning, then
induced Dan Barbara to pop up
weakly to stem any further
damage.
The pick-off was the second of
the game for Keyser, who also
caught Mike Campas straying to
far off first in the third inning.
Keyser picked off three runners
while pitching for the Cardinal in

the Taipei International Tourna
ment in Taiwan last December.
If his pitching was at all rusty
yesterday, his move to first cer
tainly wasn't.
Carper came on in the fifth and
shut out the Dons for four in
nings, giving up only two hits.
The Cardinal offense, mean
while, started scraping for runs

off Dons starter Duffy Aceret.
Centerfielder Eric DeGraw led off
the bottom of the fifth with a
squibber to second and dove head
first into first for an infield single.
Frank Carey took DeGraw's place
on a fielder's choice, and after
two walks the bases were packed
with one out. Carey came home
on a hard grounder to short by

junior Ed Sprague to tie the game
at 3-3, but that was all the Car
dinal could get out of the inning.
Stanford manufactured two
more runs in the seventh on an
infield single by Saenger, an error,
a single by Eric Cox, a sacrifice
bunt by DeGraw and a sacrifice
fly by Frank Carey, to make the
score 5-3.
