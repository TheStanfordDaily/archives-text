Ultimate Frisbee
The Stanford men's ultimate
frisbee team has gone on a tear
the past two weeks, cruising
past some of the top ultimate
teams on the west coast.
The Cardinal first served
notice that this could be their
year two weekends ago, when
the team hosted California,
UC-Santa Cruz, and defending
national champion Chabot Col
lege, Stanford's primary com
petition in the Northern Cali
fornia section.
In the first game, Stanford
jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead
over Cal and never looked hack,
sailing to an impressive 15-6
victory. After a slower start in
the next game against Chabot,
the Cardinal solved their initial
offensive problems and pulled
away with a convincing 15-8
win.
"Last year when Chabot won
Nationals they beat us pretty
badly several times," Stanford
co-captain Keith Sarkisian
said. "It was nice to return the
favor."
Stanford then avenged a 14-
13 January loss to Santa Cruz
with a 15-9 win in the day's
final game. After Santa Cruz
scored first, the Cardinal tied
the game at 1-1 and never

relinquished the lead as it went
on to beat a team that was
considered by many to be the
best in the Northern section.
"I was very pleased with the
way our team played today, es
pecially the rookies," co
captain Steve Weilbach said.
"We didn't turn the disc over
much and sustained our inten
sity level throughout the entire
day."
The next weekend the team
travelled to San Diego to com
pete in the All-California Col
legiate Tournament, held at
UC-San Digo. The team went
undefeated for the second
straight week to extend its cur
rent winning streak to 16
games, establishing Stanford
as the team to beat on the west
coast.
Stanford was seeded first in
its pool of eight teams and
rolled to easy victories over the
weak sisters of the pool in the
first day of play. Starting with
a 13-3 romp over Santa Cruz,
Stanford went on to beat Oc
cidental College 13-2, San
Diego State 13-2, and finished
the day with a 13-5 win over
UC-Irvine.
The team finished pool play
Sunday with a 13-0 whitewash
over host UC-San Diego. The
team then took on UC-Santa Bar
bara, the pool's second seed, in a
match to determine the pairings
for the semifinals. Stanford's
defense crushed the UCSB offense
and the team flew to a 13-6 win.
In the semifinals the team took
on Cal in a game to 15. In its
toughest game of the tournament,
the Cardinal once again utilized
its tenacious zone defense to turn
a 7-7 stalemate into a 15-9 victory.
In the final, Stanford again met

Santa Barbara, which had upset
previously undefeated Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo in the semis. The
Cardinal jumped out to early leads
of 4-1 and 10-5 before holding off
a late Mustang rally to win 15-11.
Men's Rugby
The Stanford Men's Rugby
Club recorded its first league win
by thoroughly defeating
Sacramento State 32-9 on
February 6. Urged on by a large
crowd and a special appearance
by the Band, the Cardinal ruggers
dominated every phase of the
game.
J.P. Whelan scored the first try
(4 points) as the Cardinal for

wards bowled over the opposition.
J.C. Schmeil then scored from a
pushover scrum led by the team's
powerful front row. John
Fitzpatrick added another try and
a drop-kick field goal (3 points),
and rookie Blair Jeffris scored the
fourth try on a 50-yard run. Andy
MacTavish kicked for a total of
13 points on the day, including a
48-yard field goal which bounced
off both an upright and the cros
sbar before going over.
Stanford's B team also beat
Sacramento State, posting a 22-4
win. The Cardinal's Tim Williams,
Rob Miller, and Sean Dahlen all
scored tries.

The next weekend the team
travelled to San Diego to com
pete in the All-California Col
legiate Tournament, held at
UC-San Digo. The team went
undefeated for the second
straight week to extend its cur
rent winning streak to 16
games, establishing Stanford
as the team to beat on the west
coast.
Stanford was seeded first in
its pool of eight teams and
rolled to easy victories over the
weak sisters of the pool in the
first day of play. Starting with
a 13-3 romp over Santa Cruz,
Stanford went on to beat Oc
cidental College 13-2, San
Diego State 13-2, and finished
the day with a 13-5 win over
UC-Irvine.
The team finished pool play
Sunday with a 13-0 whitewash
over host UC-San Diego. The
team then took on UC-Santa Bar
bara, the pool's second seed, in a
match to determine the pairings
for the semifinals. Stanford's
defense crushed the UCSB offense
and the team flew to a 13-6 win.
In the semifinals the team took
on Cal in a game to 15. In its
toughest game of the tournament,
the Cardinal once again utilized
its tenacious zone defense to turn
a 7-7 stalemate into a 15-9 victory.
In the final, Stanford again met

Santa Barbara, which had upset
previously undefeated Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo in the semis. The
Cardinal jumped out to early leads
of 4-1 and 10-5 before holding off
a late Mustang rally to win 15-11.
Men's Rugby
The Stanford Men's Rugby
Club recorded its first league win
by thoroughly defeating
Sacramento State 32-9 on
February 6. Urged on by a large
crowd and a special appearance
by the Band, the Cardinal ruggers
dominated every phase of the
game.
J.P. Whelan scored the first try
(4 points) as the Cardinal for

wards bowled over the opposition.
J.C. Schmeil then scored from a
pushover scrum led by the team's
powerful front row. John
Fitzpatrick added another try and
a drop-kick field goal (3 points),
and rookie Blair Jeffris scored the
fourth try on a 50-yard run. Andy
MacTavish kicked for a total of
13 points on the day, including a
48-yard field goal which bounced
off both an upright and the cros
sbar before going over.
Stanford's B team also beat
Sacramento State, posting a 22-4
win. The Cardinal's Tim Williams,
Rob Miller, and Sean Dahlen all
scored tries.
