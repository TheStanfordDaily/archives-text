# National team flips for Matzek
## 
### Myriam B. Perez 
If a gymnast s per
formance in the
first meet of the
year hints at the
outcome of the rest
of the season, then
Mike Matzek has

quite a promising year ahead of
him. This season opened with a
bang for Matzek at the Winter
National Competition in Nebras
ka. His dazzling performance
qualified him for a place on the
U.S. National Team.
According to Matzek, his suc
cess at the Winter Championship
was a combination of luck and
about six months of intense prep
aration. "It was a long-awaited
comeback for me after a frustrat
ing season last year," Matzek said.
Because of an injury incurred
while coming off the high bar in
a double lay-out at the Summer
National Competition last June,
the disappointed Matzek dropped
from sixth to 69th place. Cur
rently, he is ranked 12th in the
nation.
This dramatic leap can be at
tributed to the fact that the ded
icated athlete practices religiously
three times a day. He begins at
7 a.m. doing a special strength
workout that includes techniques
and exercises from the Soviet Uni
on's gymnastic team.
"After my roommate trained
with the Russian team last sum
mer, he came back and taught me
the program," explained Matzek.
"My upper body strength has im
proved tremendously from doing
these exercises daily."

The training not only improved
him physically, it also invigorated
him mentally. "I felt like I had
new life in me," he said. "I was
really motivated for the new
season." His new outlook has
given him the confidence to be
lieve going to Seoul for this sum
mer's Olympics is a tangible goal.
With this in mind he returns
to the gym in the afternoon to
practice with the Stanford team
for about three hours. After din
ner, he practices basic routines
and works on problem areas un
der the supervision of his coach
Sadao Hamada. His frequent
workouts have greatly aided Mat
zek in improving.
What sets him apart from other
gymnasts is that two weeks of
following this regimented routine
is equivalent to doing about a
month-and-a-half of normal daily
practice.
'"He recognizes his weaknes
ses," Hamada said, "and his so
lution is to work twice or three
times harder than the competi
tion. He is a very self-disciplined
individual."
Matzek boasts an impressive
15-year gymnastic career. Al
though he did not have a team
to practice with in high school —
he was the only pupil of his high
school coach — he still managed
to capture his state title.
As a freshman in college, he
won the junior national compe
tion and qualified for the senior
national developmental team. In
both his sophomore and junior
years he competed in the senior
national meet; however, his

performances were discouraging.
"My sophomore and junior
years of competition were not as
good as I hoped," the senior said.
"It seemed like I kept getting
worse, no matter how hard I
tried."
Despite this minor slump, Mat
zek's gymnastic career is on the
upswing once again. Both
Hamada and Matzek believe that
earning a spot on the 1988 U.S.

Olympic team is clearly an at
tainable goal for the Stanford
senior. In any case, the No. 4
Stanford men's gymanstics squad
will be very competitive in the
NCAA Championship meet this
year.
After the close of the college
season in April, the top twenty
four gymnasts from the regional
competitions will progress to the
U.S. Championships.
