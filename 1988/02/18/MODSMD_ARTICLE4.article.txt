# Shultz donates papers to Hoover

George Shultz will donate the papers he
has gathered during his tenure as secretary
of state to the Hoover Institution when he
leaves his position next year, according to
Hoover Head Archivist Charles Palm.
Shultz, who was named an honorary fellow
of Hoover last month, has already deposited
at Hoover the papers he collected while serving
as secretary of labor, director of the Office of
Management and Budget, and secretary of
the treasury during the Nixon administration.
He has also donated records he accumulated
as president of Bechtel Corp.
Shultz has served as secretary of state since
1982.
Palm, who is also associate director of
Hoover, called Shultz' papers "the most im
portant body of records generated during the
Reagan administration."
When he archives his most recent papers
at Hoover, Shultz will become the first sec
retary of state to place his documents in a
California library, according to Palm. Most
secretaries have deposited their files at the

Library of Congress.
A longtime Stanford resident, Shultz
remains on leave from professorship at the
Graduate School of Business.
Palm said the papers from Shultz's admin
istration as Secretary of State are organized
into two parts.
One section is composed of classified, inter
nal State Department files. These include cor
respondence with President Reagan, the
secretary's speeches, memorandums of
meetings with heads of state, policy docu
ments and instructions to ambassadors. These
records are currently stored by the govern
ment on a computer-generated disk.
The second part of the Shultz collection
consists of the secretary's personal papers.
Before Hoover can gain access to Shultz'
official papers, the institution must convince
State Department lawyers that security re
quirements for classified materials will be met.
Palm said he will travel to Washington, D.C.,
next week to "work out the details" of the
transfer, and that he expects "no difficulties."
Like other classified documents deposited
at Hoover in the past, Shultz's papers "will
take a while before they are declassified,"

Palm said. Until and after declassification of
the papers, the institution will meet the State
Department's security requirements, he
added.
Although the amount of time before declas
sification varies from document to document,
Palm said he expects "a good percentage of
the documents will be open after six years."
He explained that decisions about when the
papers will be declassified are made by the
State Department, not by Hoover.
In the declassification process, information
previously considered secret or classified will
become available for public scrutiny.
While Palm presently does not know what
information is included in Shultz's personal
papers, he said will work out the access policy
for those papers with Shultz' aides next week
in Washington.
The papers "will be a very important schol
arly resource for anyone doing research into
international policy in the years since 1982,"
Palm said.
Palm said Hoover has an "equal access
policy": all materials available to professors
and Hoover scholars are also open to students.
