# Amoroso the gem in Cardinal crown

"Dina Amoroso
has her two feet
securely on the
ground."
Anyone who has
seen this outstand
ing gymnast com-

pete would tend to disagree with
this claim. Her high-flying
Tsukahara vaults and energetic
flips on the floor exercise would
convince nearly anyone that this
girl can fly.

What Coach Homer Sardina
was talking about, of course, is
Amoroso's mental attitude toward
the sport. "She doesn't consider
herself a superstar," he contin
ued. "Everyone on this team is
making sacrifices for the good of
the team, and Dina epitomizes
that attitude."
"She's always really pulling for
the team," sophomore teammate
Susan Banta added.
As Amoroso talks, this attitude
becomes obvious. "I'm not putting
too many expectations on myself;

I just want to hit routines, have
clean routines, help the team any
way I can. More than anything,
I want the team to make it to
nationals."
She adds that college gymnas
tics is more enjoyable for her than
club gymnastics for one reason:
It is more team-oriented.
Gymnastics is, however, judged
on individual performances that
are then combined to get the total
team score, and Amoroso has
some impressive numbers to con
tribute to the team effort. Last

year, she broke individual school
records in vault, with a 9.65; vault
average, 9.52; floor exercise, 9.70;
floor exercise average, 9.50; and
all-around, 37.6. Moreover, these
individual performances helped
the team break 12 additional
school records.
Her perfomances this year seem
to be headed in the same direc
tion. She has already received
team-high scores of 9.55 on floor
and 9.5 on vault. She is also cur
rently third on the team with a
36.45 all-around to her credit.
All of these scores were
achieved without the use of her
two most powerful elements,
which have been omitted from her
routines while she recovers from
a minor leg injury suffered in the
first meet. On the floor, she
usually includes an explosive
piked double-back flip. On vault,
her specialty is a full-twisting
Tsukahara, currently the most
difficult vault performed — or
even allowed — at the collegiate
level.
"Dina is not the most talented
athlete I have ever worked with,
but she works closer to her
human potential than anyone I
have ever worked with," Sardina
said. "She has achieved a level of
performance that defies her ath
letic ability. To see her do what
she does (in spite of her limita
tions) is really remarkable."
Her success mainly stems from
her desire to succeed. "Superstars
are usually people who match
hunger with their talent to rise
to the top. Dina has hunger which
is far superior to that of most
superstars," her coach added.
This desire to succeed, however,
can be a stumbling block in some
cases, especially on beam, where
falls often lead to frustration and

The Cardinal will need the help of Dina Amoroso tomorrow night when it tries to avenge a loss to
Fullerton State.
