# Fencers to clash with San Jose State
## 
### David Earnest Staff writer 
After a successful
weekend in
Cleveland, the
Stanford men's
and women's fenc
ing teams return
home Saturday to

take on San Jose State. The Spar
tans visit Roble Gym at 1 p.m. in
the final home meet this sea-on
for the Cardinal fencers.
Five members of the men's and
women's teams spent last
weekend in Cleveland trying to
qualify for the American Junior
Olympics fencing team. Stanford
Coaches Zoran Tulum and Sherry
Posthumus were also in Cleveland
seeking to recruit talented fencers
in their continuing efforts to build
a program that can compete with
the east coast's best.
Sophomore Rich Reader led the
men, advancing to the second
round of competition before
bowing out. Reader took second
place in his first round draw of
six fencers with a record of 3-2.

His two losses were each by a
single touch, 5-4.
In the second round, Reader
lost three bouts, again by a single
touch each time. He was then
eliminated from the competition.
Freshman Stan Brobston
missed advancing to the second
round when he was eliminated
"on indicators." When two fencers
have the same record, the one
who gave up fewer touches ad
vances to the next round.
Brobston had several close bouts
and was eliminated because he
gave up more touches than an
other fencer with the same record.
Sophomore Jim Farrell also lost
in the first round.
On the women's side, sopho
more Elisabeth Spilman and
freshman Olivia Judson were both
successful in their efforts this
weekend. On Saturday the
women's epee event was held.
Judson took 19th overall and Spil
man finished 15th.
On Sunday the two fenced the
foil event. Both had difficulties
adjusting to the tempo of the foil
after the epee event and were

eliminated in the first round. Spil
man also had the disadvantage of
an injured hand, causing her dif
ficulties in holding her weapon
during the foil event.
Tulum was pleased with the
performance of all the fencers.
"They looked very good against
some tough competition. Olivia,
Elisabeth and Stan all lost several
very close bouts," he said.
This weekend was also the first
of many efforts to construct a vi
able, nationally competitive team
for Stanford. Both Posthumus
and Tulum spent this weekend
watching and talking to talented
high school fencers as the coaches
try to bring experience and depth
to the team.
"I am looking for a very strong
team next year," Tulum said. "If
our efforts continue to be success
ful we will have the strongest pro
gram in the West next year and
a strong national team in two
years."
The contest against San Jose
State Saturday is the last home
match for the Stanford seniors.
The Spartans, currently a club

program, are a strong team with
a history of performing well. In
the past, San Jose State has
produced nationally recognized
fencers, including several men's
fencers who made the 1984 U.S.
Olympic Team. The program
declined several years ago, how
ever, when a new athletic director
decided to discontinue the team's
funding and their varsity status.
"We enjoy fencing against them
and hope that it helps their pro
gram regain varsity status," Pos
thumus said. "They have a very
strong club program and are ca
pable of being a force in fencing
in the West."
Tulum said that "we will do
anything we can to make fencing
in the West a stronger sport. If
we are able to fence against better
teams, we improve and and they
improve. It's good for the sport
in general."
Next Saturday the team con
cludes its regular season when it
travels to Berkeley to face Cali
fornia. The Western Regionals for
women will be held the first
weekend in March.
