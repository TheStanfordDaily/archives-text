# Professor coping with AIDS
## Colleague describes optimistic outlook as heroic 
### Ann Marsh Editorial Staff 
Editor's note: This is the first ar
ticle in a series on AIDS and its
effects on the Stanford communi
ty.

When he was 26 years old, Clas
sics Prof. John Winkler "came
out" and admitted to himself and
others that he was gay.
Joining in the growing gay
liberation movement, Winkler
desribed the period after this rev
elation as "a decade of great
liberation of activity."
"We (the gay community) felt
that sexual liberation was the or
der of the day. Nobody knew in
that decade that the (AIDS) virus
was starting to go around," he
said.
Today, at 43, Winkler said he
believes that he must have con
tracted the aquired immune
deficiency syndrome virus, which
has a 7- to 10-year incubation
period, during that time of libera
tion.
Winkler, the first openly gay*
professor to receive tenure at
Stanford, is now the first member
of the Stanford community to
freely admit he has AIDS.
Yet the stereotype picture
painted of so many members of

the gny community who were in
fected during this period — ter
minally ill and bedridden — does
not describe Winkler. Winkler,
who was diagnosed as having
AIDS in August and has not yet
experienced any physical effects
of the disease, better characteri
zes a new generation of people
with AIDS: the survivors.
"He's absolutely wonderful and
in his own way quite heroic," said
longtime colleague David Hal
perin, an external fellow of the
Stanford Humanities Center.
"His attitude seems to be that
this is something to live with.
John has taken a lot of the fear
out of it for me because of the
forthright and practical attitude
he takes in dealing with it," Hal
perin said.
"He has such incredible
serenity" said senior Daniel Bao,
one of the directors of the Stan
ford AIDS education project.
Indeed, Winkler discusses his
disease calmly and avoids specula
tion beyond the close future.
He focuses on everyday details
of his treatment, describir u the
Pentamidine he breathes into his
lungs once a month to combat his
pneumonia and the pocket
electronic pillbox that buzzes
every four hours — day and night
— to remind him to take his

medication.
"My initial impulse to tell
people (about the disease) is
slowly fading," Winkler said. "At
times I feel like dramatizing it —
like this is my death bed — but
really I prefer to forget it,"
Winkler said.
However, "there's nothing like
the thought of death to make you
sit down and do the things you
want to do," Winkler said, ex
plaining that while he tries to put
the disease out of his mind, one
result of his infection is that he
is constantly inspired to complete
the different books he is writing.
Halperin agreed that Winkler
has been "working very inten
sively" since his diagnosis.
Winkler said that he and other
people recently infected with
AIDS have good reason to be more
optimistic about their futures
than people who were getting the
disease when it was first discov
ered in 1981,
Since that time, the life expec
tancy after diagnosis has grown
from 18 to 24 months, he said,
adding that more and more long
term survivors, people who live
for several years with the disease,
are appearing.
"People are hoping that AIDS
is becoming a manageable disease
like diabetes," Winkler said. If
AIDS becomes "a disease people
could live with, I would settle for
that," he added laughing.
However, because of his illness,
Winkler said he might be tempted
to return to the gay activist role
he played at Yale when he was a
professor there.
Although he tries not to think
about AIDS in his personal life,
Winkler explained that because of
"the politics of AIDS, I'm willing
to talk about it."
The social problem of AIDS
stem from people who regard the
disease "as a plague or taboo"
that only touches the gay com
munity, according to Winkler.
"This problem is the most impor
tant to look at," he added.
Winkler, who taught the Con
flict and Change course in the
Western Culture tract this quar
ter, may exert a great positive
effect on student opinion regard
ing AIDS, Bao said.
According to Bao, a resident
SLE tutor in an all-freshman
dorm, "A number of the freshmen
think [Winkler] is the best pro
fessor they have had." Bao added
that people will be especially con
cerned about Winkler's illness be
cause he is so well-respected.
Winkler said that he "thought
about telling his (undergraduate
students that he has AIDS), but
there didn't seem to be a time
that was opportune." Yet, when
he is needed to speak about his
experience with AIDS, "I'll be
there," he said, adding "It's good
to have a living, talking, breathing
person" to humanize the disease.
Since learning that he had the
virus, Winkler said he has
received an overwhelming amount
of support from friends and col
leagues. The office of the dean of
humanities is paying for some of

'At times I feel like
dramatizing it — like
this is my death bed
— but really I prefer
to forget it.'

the medical costs not covered by
Winkler's insurance.
Although many people with
AIDS — including an unquantifi
able number in the Stanford com
munity — choose to die in isola
tion, it's a disease that tends to
draw communities together,
Winkler said. According to
Winkler, AIDS is a disease that
has been a unifying force in the
gay community.
According to Halperin, "People
somehow assume from new 3
reports that people with AIDS are
going to look like they have been
struck with a lightning rod." This
is somehow comforting because it
sets them apart from the mass of
humanity, he added.
Although "many people see

AIDS as marking people as dif
ferent from others, in fact it
doesn't separate you in any pal
pable way from your community."
Donald Howard, a Stanford
English professor, died last spring
of AIDS. But Howard did not tell
anyone he was sick, according to
Winkler.
"Everyone at his memorial ser
vice felt so sorry that they
couldn't say 'good-bye' to him,"
Winkler said, adding that "every
one who wants to will have the
chance to say what they need to
me.
Members of the Stanford com
munity who have died because of
AIDS will be honored when a por
tion of the Names Quilt bearing
their names comes to Memorial
Auditorium noon today until 7:00
p.m. tomorrow.
The Names Project, a Palo Alto
based group, created a quilt made
of patches dedicated to individual
AIDS victims around the country.
The quilt was displayed in Wash
ington, D.C., in October and sub
sequently at other locations
around the country.
According to Winkler, every
thing about the concept of the
Names Quilt is moving. Taking
such a personalized memorial "in
which the people are all stitched
together as if they were holding
hands" is a powerful symbol, he
said.
Thinking about his own future,
Winkler said living with "what
may be a terminal disease . .. just
makes me a little more conscious
of the need to be as good as I can
be. He added that he feels "in
credibly lucky to be in an envi
ronment which is so supportive."
"I count on John being able to
take care of himself for quite some
time," Halperin said, adding that
"If there comes a time when he's
not able to, then we'll do what
we need to."
"If the time comes," Winkler
said, "I have hundreds of people
who I know I can count on."
