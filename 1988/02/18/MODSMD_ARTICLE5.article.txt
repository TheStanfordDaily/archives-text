# Professor coping with AIDS
## Colleague describes optimistic outlook as heroic 
### Ann Marsh Editorial Staff 
Editor's note: This is the first ar
ticle in a series on AIDS and its
effects on the Stanford communi
ty.

When he was 26 years old, Clas
sics Prof. John Winkler "came
out" and admitted to himself and
others that he was gay.
Joining in the growing gay
liberation movement, Winkler
desribed the period after this rev
elation as "a decade of great
liberation of activity."
"We (the gay community) felt
that sexual liberation was the or
der of the day. Nobody knew in
that decade that the (AIDS) virus
was starting to go around," he
said.
Today, at 43, Winkler said he
believes that he must have con
tracted the aquired immune
deficiency syndrome virus, which
has a 7- to 10-year incubation
period, during that time of libera
tion.
Winkler, the first openly gay*
professor to receive tenure at
Stanford, is now the first member
of the Stanford community to
freely admit he has AIDS.
Yet the stereotype picture
painted of so many members of

the gny community who were in
fected during this period — ter
minally ill and bedridden — does
not describe Winkler. Winkler,
who was diagnosed as having
AIDS in August and has not yet
experienced any physical effects
of the disease, better characteri
zes a new generation of people
with AIDS: the survivors.
"He's absolutely wonderful and
in his own way quite heroic," said
longtime colleague David Hal
perin, an external fellow of the
Stanford Humanities Center.
"His attitude seems to be that
this is something to live with.
John has taken a lot of the fear
out of it for me because of the
forthright and practical attitude
he takes in dealing with it," Hal
perin said.
"He has such incredible
serenity" said senior Daniel Bao,
one of the directors of the Stan
ford AIDS education project.
Indeed, Winkler discusses his
disease calmly and avoids specula
tion beyond the close future.
He focuses on everyday details
of his treatment, describir u the
Pentamidine he breathes into his
lungs once a month to combat his
pneumonia and the pocket
electronic pillbox that buzzes
every four hours — day and night
— to remind him to take his

medication.
"My initial impulse to tell
people (about the disease) is
slowly fading," Winkler said. "At
times I feel like dramatizing it —
like this is my death bed — but
really I prefer to forget it,"
Winkler said.
However, "there's nothing like
the thought of death to make you
sit down and do the things you
want to do," Winkler said, ex
plaining that while he tries to put
the disease out of his mind, one
result of his infection is that he
is constantly inspired to complete
the different books he is writing.
Halperin agreed that Winkler
has been "working very inten
sively" since his diagnosis.
Winkler said that he and other
people recently infected with
AIDS have good reason to be more
optimistic about their futures
than people who were getting the
disease when it was first discov
ered in 1981,
Since that time, the life expec
tancy after diagnosis has grown
from 18 to 24 months, he said,
adding that more and more long
term survivors, people who live
for several years with the disease,
are appearing.
"People are hoping that AIDS
