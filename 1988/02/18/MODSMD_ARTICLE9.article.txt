# Business School alums reach out
## Offer assists non-profit groups

Extending a project that
originated in the Graduate
School of Business, two alumni
from the school have set up a
program volunteering the man
agement skills of 30 former
business students to aid non
profit and public service organ
izations.
Organized by Debbie Cohen
Pine and Alison Elliott, the
Alumni Consulting Team
launched its initial five projects
last November, to be completed
next month. For each project,
several volunteers work four or
five months, serving as con
sultants to help an organiza
tion reach a specific goal.
ACT's current volunteer
projects include market re
search and finance for the In
stitute on Aging at Mt. Zion
Hospital in San Francisco,
long-term strategic planning
for the Palo Alto Peninsula
Center for the Blind, studying
organizational behavior and in
formation flow for the San
Francisco Boys and Girls Club,
recruiting volunteers for Big
Brothers/Big Sisters of Santa
Clara County and working with
the city of South San Francisco
to boost its sales tax base.
ACT helps the organizations
develop projects that meet
their most critical needs, then
matches them with Business
School alumni who have the
necessary skills. Each volun
teer spends up to 10 hours a
month on a project.
"The basic idea (of ACT) is
social service and giving back
to the community . . . not
donating money, but service
and skills," said Pine, a 1987
Stanford MBA graduate.
Pine, ACT's executive direc
tor, said the idea to involve her
classmates in helping non-
Krofit organizations came to
er a year-and-a-half ago. She
originally conceived ACT as a
Business School class project,
then teamed up with Elliott, a
1984 Business School gradu
ate, who had an idea for a
similar program.
Pine said similar groups exist

at other schools, but ACT is
unique because of its team ap
proach. "We match a team of
four to five volunteers with a
specific project," she said, add
ing that ACT chooses alumni
whose skills best suit the needs
of the particular organization.
Jim Dern, a 1978 Business
School graduate and a member
of ACT's Executive Committee,
is a volunteer in the South San
Francisco project. Dern and
four other alumni help the city
develop strategies to attract
businesses, in order to raise
revenue through sales tax. "It
is similar to developing a mar
keting strategy for a product,"
he said. "In this case, the prod
uct is South San Francisco."
Dern said ACT performs a
valuable function by aiding
alumni who want to help non
profit groups but lack the time
to find one which needs their
specific skills.
"It gives people a way to get
involved on a project which an
organization clearly needs help
on, and they can spend three,
four or five months helping,"
Dern said. "Maybe that will
lead to something more per
manent."
Following the completion of
its current projects, ACT plans
to launch another set of six to
eight projects involving new
volunteers. These will include
work with an environmental
group and a local school dis
trict, Pine said.
Pine said she hopes that in
the future ACT will continue
to increase the number of proj
ects it undertakes and possibly
recruit volunteers from other
graduate schools at Stanford.
