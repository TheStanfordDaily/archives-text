THE EAST PALO ALTO/STANFORD SUMMER ACADEMY

students to be daytime counselors/instructors for a group of middle

experience working with youth is a plus, but not necessary.
Room and board on campus are provided PLUS a stipend.
SOUND GOOD? Then pick up an application NOW at the Public
Service Center in Owen House (next to the Campus Bike Shop).
Application deadline: Wednesday, February 24
