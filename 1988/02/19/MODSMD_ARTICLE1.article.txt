# University remembers AIDS victims
## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Stanford paid tribute to community members
who have died of AIDS at a service held yesterday
in Memorial Auditorium. Accompanying the cer
emony, attended by almost 200 people, were por
tions of a quilt assembled by the San Francisco
based Names Project commemorating AIDS vic
tims.
Senior Daniel Bao, a co-organizer of Stanford's
Lesbian and Gay Archives Project, estimates that
25 people with a Stanford connection are included
in the Names Quilt.
One of the quilt's 2,176 panels commemorating
loved ones lost to the acquired immune deficiency
syndrome honored seven University students, fac
ulty and staff members. The panel reads "Stan
ford University — In memory of students, staff
and faculty. Farewell our colleagues and friends."
According to Michael Ramsey-Perez, director
of Student Organization Services and organizer
of the campus Names Project effort, the memorial
and quilt are designed to "bring home" AIDS
deaths. Each 12 by 12 foot panel was constructed
by friends or relatives of an AIDS victim.
Bao added that the service was "to grieve
publicly, and turn that grief into something con
structive."
University President Donald Kennedy, who
gave a welcoming speech, said the occasion was
both "commemorative and celebratory. . . .
Celebratory because we cherish these people
(AIDS victims)."
The service continued with short eulogies of
some of the victims by those close to them. The
emotional addresses often expressed sentiments
such as "how wonderful that I got to know you,"
Ramsey-Perez said.
Dick Greenamyre, president of a San Francisco
chapter of Stanford gay alumni, read a touching
anonymous letter addressed to "Duffy." The let
ter described the relationship between "Duffy"
and the nameless writer and was read to recognize
the "many anonymous remem
brances received by the project,"
Greenamyre said.
To close the ceremony, Dean of
the Chapel at Memorial Church
Robert Gregg read a list of AIDS
victims who had been involved
with Stanford, punctuated by a
long pause between each name.
The list included many addressed
only by their first names, and
some only by title. "A professor
.. . a professor ... a professor,"
Gregg read, indicating the AlDS
related deaths of three unnamed
professors.
The list of names also included
former English Prof. Donald
Howard, a leading Chaucer
scholar who died last spring, staff
member David Thompson, who
worked in Green Library and a
number of alumni, including
Steven Block, Gerald Martin, Jay

Spears, John Trowbridge and
Mark Zambrano.
According to Bao, it was diffi
cult to find the names of campus
AIDS victims. "It's safe to say
that the number of people being
honored were less than half of
the people at Stanford who have
died of AIDS," Bao said.
Bao said part of the problem
stems from widespread sentiment
that dying from AIDS is "still a
stigma." Part of the function of
yesterday's memorial was to
remove this stigma.
The event was followed by an
evening benefit concert to raise
money for local AIDS service or
ganizations. Bao said the two
functions marked a "development
in how Stanford deals with
AIDS." Specifically, the focus on
helping people to deal with AIDS
once they are diagnosed as having
the disease.
Panels of the quilt will be dis
played in Memorial Auditorium
today from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
