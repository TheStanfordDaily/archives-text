# No vote taken on Area One plan
## Faculty Senate Chair gives '50-50' chance of March 3 decision 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Although yesterday's Faculty
Senate meeting marked the end
of the first stage of debate over
the future of the Area One re
quirement, the date when a de
ciding vote will be cast in the
matter has been pushed farther
into the future.
Faculty Senate Chair Gerald
Lieberman said there is a "50-50"
chance the senate will vote on
March 3 whether to change the
current Western Culture require
ment offering to a broader course
entitled "Cultures, Ideas, and
Values."
The senate is currently consid
ering six questions posed by the
Steering Committee about the dif
ferences between the existing
Western Culture requirement and
the CIV proposal, offered by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
Today's debate ended discus
sion on the first two questions:
1) whether the requirement
should include treatment of an
cient and medieval cultures and
2) whether the course should
focus on the roots of American
culture. Upcoming meetings wili
deal with the four subsequent
questions.
Lieberman said the questions
are designed to allow the senators
to "get a feel" for the issues in
the debate and decide if they wish
to accept, reject or amend the pro

posal.
At yesterday's meeting, the last
of a long list of faculty expressed
their views on the Area One
debate.
Speakers addressed the issue of
keeping the core reading list for
all eight Western Culture tracks.
Though the current core list is
designed to provide a common in

tellectual experience for all fresh
man, critics say it does not contain
enough works by minorities and
women. The CIV proposal would
abolish the core list and let indi
vidual instructors choose the cur
riculum for future courses.
