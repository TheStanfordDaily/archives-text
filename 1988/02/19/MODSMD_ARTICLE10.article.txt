# No vote taken on Area One plan
## Faculty Senate Chair gives '50-50' chance of March 3 decision 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Although yesterday's Faculty
Senate meeting marked the end
of the first stage of debate over
the future of the Area One re
quirement, the date when a de
ciding vote will be cast in the
matter has been pushed farther
into the future.
Faculty Senate Chair Gerald
Lieberman said there is a "50-50"
chance the senate will vote on
March 3 whether to change the
current Western Culture require
ment offering to a broader course
entitled "Cultures, Ideas, and
Values."
The senate is currently consid
ering six questions posed by the
Steering Committee about the dif
ferences between the existing
Western Culture requirement and
the CIV proposal, offered by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
Today's debate ended discus
sion on the first two questions:
1) whether the requirement
should include treatment of an
cient and medieval cultures and
2) whether the course should
focus on the roots of American
culture. Upcoming meetings wili
deal with the four subsequent
questions.
Lieberman said the questions
are designed to allow the senators
to "get a feel" for the issues in
the debate and decide if they wish
to accept, reject or amend the pro

posal.
At yesterday's meeting, the last
of a long list of faculty expressed
their views on the Area One
debate.
Speakers addressed the issue of
keeping the core reading list for
all eight Western Culture tracks.
Though the current core list is
designed to provide a common in

tellectual experience for all fresh
man, critics say it does not contain
enough works by minorities and
women. The CIV proposal would
abolish the core list and let indi
vidual instructors choose the cur
riculum for future courses.

University President Donald Kennedy offers an opinion on the
Western Culture debate at the Faculty Senate meeting.
and Classics Prof. Gregson Davis,
one of the authors of a faculty
letter in favor of the CUS pro
posal, agreed any core list should
be organized thematically instead
of chronologically. With a
thematic organization, Kennedy
said instructors could easily in
corporate works by minorities and
women to introduce students to
the perspectives of non-western
cultures.
"We should choose texts by spe
cific concepts and not visa-versa,"
Davis said.
English Prof. Diane Mid
dlebrook said the core list cur
rently divides works into "great
works" and "unnecessary works,"
or those left off the list. She said
the CIV proposal would change
the core list so it "evolves with
the fields of knowlege and attracts
as teachers those who are eager
to incorporate different ways of
thinking about difference."
Others favored what they called
a compromise between the cur
rent Western Culture curriculum
and the proposed changes.
Music Prof. William Mahrt
spoke in favor of the Chace pro
posal, a plan authored by English
Prof. William Chase to retain the
core list and add works by women
and people of color. Mahrt said
the Area One requirement is
about intellectual inheritance and
not ethnic inheritance. "The
strongest works of the common
intellectual heritage should
remain the basis for the course,"
he said.
Mahrt said a common core list
provides students with a basic un
derstanding of western culture
and provides a focal point to begin
study of the humanities. The core
list "was meant to provide an in
tellectual literacy learned through

study of common questions and
works, upon which a diverse array
of distribution courses could then
follow," he said.
Education Prof. Denis Phillips
said he would support a core list
if it accurately encompassed all
of the proposals before the senate.
Phillips said he believes the sen
ate is essentially arguing three
issues. These include whether the
core list: should be retained with
some modifications, deal prima
rily with the dynamics of change
in culture or trace the roots of
some of the mcyor groups in con
temporary American culture.
Phillips said he favors a uni
fication of the three issues so that
all groups are satisfied and be
cause they are "pertinent to
everyone's identity."
Another important point of con
tention is whether to incorporate
the works of other cultures into
the Area One requirement.
Kennedy said western and non
western culture studies are two
different issues, and western cul
ture should take precedence.
"Western culture is the culture
that has formed the ideational
and institutional framework in
which we live," he said. "That
simple fact of life ... is the most
powerful justification for believ
ing that the study of western cul
ture has priority over, and should
be antecedent to, the highly de
sirable study of other cultures."
Kennedy also said the current
Area One curriculum is too over
burdened to take on the study of
other cultures that should be
studied separately.
Davis countered by warning
against "Eurocentrism," what he
called the false belief that Western
Culture evolved solely from Eu
ropean culture. This distortion,
he said, gives people the incorrect
feeling that their culture is the
mainstream, and this mindset
"should be dropped," he said.

culture. Upcoming meetings wili
deal with the four subsequent
questions.
Lieberman said the questions
are designed to allow the senators
to "get a feel" for the issues in
the debate and decide if they wish
to accept, reject or amend the pro

posal.
At yesterday's meeting, the last
of a long list of faculty expressed
their views on the Area One
debate.
Speakers addressed the issue of
keeping the core reading list for
all eight Western Culture tracks.
Though the current core list is
designed to provide a common in

tellectual experience for all fresh
man, critics say it does not contain
enough works by minorities and
women. The CIV proposal would
abolish the core list and let indi
vidual instructors choose the cur
riculum for future courses.

University President Donald Kennedy offers an opinion on the
Western Culture debate at the Faculty Senate meeting.
and Classics Prof. Gregson Davis,
one of the authors of a faculty
letter in favor of the CUS pro
posal, agreed any core list should
be organized thematically instead
of chronologically. With a
thematic organization, Kennedy
said instructors could easily in
corporate works by minorities and
women to introduce students to
the perspectives of non-western
cultures.
"We should choose texts by spe
cific concepts and not visa-versa,"
Davis said.
English Prof. Diane Mid
dlebrook said the core list cur
rently divides works into "great
works" and "unnecessary works,"
or those left off the list. She said
the CIV proposal would change
the core list so it "evolves with
the fields of knowlege and attracts
as teachers those who are eager
to incorporate different ways of
thinking about difference."
Others favored what they called
a compromise between the cur
rent Western Culture curriculum
and the proposed changes.
Music Prof. William Mahrt
spoke in favor of the Chace pro
posal, a plan authored by English
Prof. William Chase to retain the
core list and add works by women
and people of color. Mahrt said
the Area One requirement is
about intellectual inheritance and
not ethnic inheritance. "The
strongest works of the common
intellectual heritage should
remain the basis for the course,"
he said.
Mahrt said a common core list
provides students with a basic un
derstanding of western culture
and provides a focal point to begin
study of the humanities. The core
list "was meant to provide an in
tellectual literacy learned through

study of common questions and
works, upon which a diverse array
of distribution courses could then
follow," he said.
Education Prof. Denis Phillips
said he would support a core list
if it accurately encompassed all
of the proposals before the senate.
Phillips said he believes the sen
ate is essentially arguing three
issues. These include whether the
core list: should be retained with
some modifications, deal prima
rily with the dynamics of change
in culture or trace the roots of
some of the mcyor groups in con
temporary American culture.
Phillips said he favors a uni
fication of the three issues so that
all groups are satisfied and be
cause they are "pertinent to
everyone's identity."
Another important point of con
tention is whether to incorporate
the works of other cultures into
the Area One requirement.
Kennedy said western and non
western culture studies are two
different issues, and western cul
ture should take precedence.
"Western culture is the culture
that has formed the ideational
and institutional framework in
which we live," he said. "That
simple fact of life ... is the most
powerful justification for believ
ing that the study of western cul
ture has priority over, and should
be antecedent to, the highly de
sirable study of other cultures."
Kennedy also said the current
Area One curriculum is too over
burdened to take on the study of
other cultures that should be
studied separately.
Davis countered by warning
against "Eurocentrism," what he
called the false belief that Western
Culture evolved solely from Eu
ropean culture. This distortion,
he said, gives people the incorrect
feeling that their culture is the
mainstream, and this mindset
"should be dropped," he said.
Although yesterday's Faculty
Senate meeting marked the end
of the first stage of debate over
the future of the Area One re
quirement, the date when a de
ciding vote will be cast in the
matter has been pushed farther
into the future.
Faculty Senate Chair Gerald
Lieberman said there is a "50-50"
chance the senate will vote on
March 3 whether to change the
current Western Culture require
ment offering to a broader course
entitled "Cultures, Ideas, and
Values."
The senate is currently consid
ering six questions posed by the
Steering Committee about the dif
ferences between the existing
Western Culture requirement and
the CIV proposal, offered by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
Today's debate ended discus
sion on the first two questions:
1) whether the requirement
should include treatment of an
cient and medieval cultures and
2) whether the course should
focus on the roots of American
culture. Upcoming meetings wili
deal with the four subsequent
questions.
Lieberman said the questions
are designed to allow the senators
to "get a feel" for the issues in
the debate and decide if they wish
to accept, reject or amend the pro
