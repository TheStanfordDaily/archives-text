# Panel accuses Tresidder of racism
## Committee on Minority Issues claims union alienates students 
### Matthew Poppe 
Members of the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues yesterday said
Tresidder Union alienates minority stu
dents at Stanford. Committee members
made the charges when they met with
Tresidder representatives at El Centro
to discuss how Tresidder can address
minority community needs.
"It seems like people don't really want
(minority students) to be there," said
David Porter, a graduate student mem
ber of the UCMI.
Yet, despite the criticism, the overall
tone of the discussion was positive, and
both sides sought each others' counsel
in how to approach the problem.
The meeting was part of the UCMI's
process to determine the quality of
minority life at Stanford. The commit
tee was created soon after the Univer
sity Centennial Celebration, when mem
bers of the ethnic and minority student
groups protested against institutional
racism and called for examination of
the problem.
The committee is composed of faculty,
staff and students, as well as four ex
ternal and two ex-officio members.
"Tresidder has the unique opportu
nity to be the central student hangout,"
according to Faye McNair-Knox, the
UCMI vice-chair and director of re
search for the committee. However,
Tresidder has a "legacy" of poor service

to minorities, she said.
"As far as minority students are con
cerned, ITresidderl is not considered the
place to go," Porter added.
McNair-Knox said evidence of insti
tutional racism is spread throughout
the student union. She cited as exam
ples the low level of minority employ
ment at Tresidder, the treatment of
union workers and the "interpersonal
relations" between minority students

and Tresidder employees.
According to McNair-Knox, Tresidder
Catering has been a particular problem.
She described the quality of service at
the Black Baccalaureate, an annual
event which used to be held at Tresid
der, as horrible and getting worse each
year.

ception (minorities get) is a dif
ference in the quality of ser
vice. ... I don't have to do the
same for black people as I do for
someone else."
One area targeted for improve
ment was advertising. According
to Porter, minority students need
to be informed when jobs at Tres
idder are available. "Advertising
in The Daily is not enough," he
said, saying students generally
don't look at all the ads.
Porter also said that since
"there are more productive places
where (minorities) can see them
selves putting in time," they need
to be convinced that their role at

Tresidder is important.
Porter added that once minority
students are motivated to apply,
Tresidder needs to follow up by
offering them jobs. He said that,
in contrast to Tresidder, Residen
tial Education advertises well.
However, most minority students
who apply for jobs there are
rejected.
Tresidder's entertainment has
also been a problem, according to
the UCMI members. The weekly
Noon Concerts sponsored by Tres
idder have been a point of con
tention because of the lack of
minority performers. Coffee
House entertainment has suffered
from that same shortage, commit
tee members claimed.
Before any significant changes
can be made, Tresidder needs to
"get a clarification of (its) own
image," McNair-Knox said.
