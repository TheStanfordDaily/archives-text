# Historian emphasizes value of rock 'n' roll
## 
### Scott Lyon 
According to archivist and historian
Paul Grushkin, who spoke at Branner
Lounge last night on the art of rock 'n'
roll, the best part of his undergraduate
years at Stanford were not spent in the
classroom, but exploring the history of
rock and roll.
Looking back, Grushkin described his
Stanford years as "wild times. People
were breaking windows and getting ar
rested. You had a choice between classes
and Fleetwood Mac at the Fillmore. . . .
I chose Fleetwood Mac!"
Today, Grushkin, who is a 1974 grad
uate in Afro-American studies, has
turned his hobby into a writing profes
sion and has recently published "The
Art of Rock," which contains 1,700 color
plates of what he considers "the best
rock art from the '60s, '70s and '80s."
Grushkin also published a book in
1983 titled "the Official Book of the
Deadheads" about the Grateful Dead.
"The Art of Rock," published in the
fall of 1987, received national acclaim
and sold 20,000 copies in just six weeks.
It is the result of four years of inter
views, which include conversations with
art collectors.
Grushkin called his book an "oral his
tory" of rock 'n' roll. "Rock 'n' roll art

is not just the graphics. Rock and roll
is what happened to us. We got together,
bought tickets, listened to the music and
celebrated the whole experience."
During his time at Stanford, Grushkin
said he looked back at all different types
of rock music, from bebop to rhythm
and blues, calling it "great stuff."
Grushkin explained that he was "very
influenced" by Emeritus Prof, of An
thropology and Sociology St. Claire
Drake, who was travelling around the
country in search of "the essence of
black culture." Yet, Drake found it dif
ficult to pin down any universal trends
because each city he visited was unique,
according to Grushkin.
Grushkin said he found a natural con
nection between Drake's research and
his own.
"You can start anywhere you want.
But you can't say the old stuff is worse
than the new stuff. That's what's so
great about groups like the Grateful
Dead. . . . There's no one reason which
explains their success. . . . There are
literally 100 different reasons."
Grushkin said that the best thing
about writing this book was that it al
lowed him to go "time-tripping," reading
old articles in newspapers and
magazines, collecting posters and talking
to people about the great concerts.
