Gorbachev defends reforms
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev yesterday issued a strong defense of his
plans to overhaul the nation's political system,
und he said that a major Communist Party
conference in June will be asked to endorse
those plans.
Declaring that preparations should begin
now to revamp the system of government in
advance of the party conference, the Kremlin
leader said that such moves are necessary if
his attempts to revive the stagnant economy
are to succeed.
Efforts to improve living conditions for So
viet citizens and raise the quality of consumer
goods still leave a lot to be desired, Gorbachev
said in a speech concluding a two-day plenum
of the Communist Party Central Committee.
Gorbachev did not suggest reducing the
leading role of the Communist Party in na
tional life. "We are not retreating even one
step from socialism," he said, "from Marxism-
Leninism, from everything that has been
gained and created by the people."
Nicaragua peace talks resume
GUATEMALA CITY — Nicaragua's Sandi
nista government and the U.S.-backed Contras
yesterday resumed direct cease-fire negotia
tions begun last month before Congress
rejected further military aid for the rebels.
Both sides said they would be "flexible"
during the three days of scheduled talks, but
neither appeared to have altered its sharply
divergent negotiating position.
It was not immediately clear how the cutoffs
in American military aid for the rebels or a
pending congressional vote on so-called non
lethal aid would affect the negotiation. Contra
leaders have maintained that the aid cutoff
did not weaken their position at the bargaining
table because their forces are still in place and
fighting.
The Contras and the Reagan administration
insist that only military pressure will force
the leftist Sandinista government to make po
litical concessions.
"The objective of our struggle, the
democratization of Nicaragua, has not been
achieved, and therefore there is no danger of
the combatants abandoning their terrain," said
Contra leader Azucena Ferrey.
Employers endorse AIDS code
NEW YORK — Thirty major employers and
unions have endorsed a new 10-point AIDS
"bill of rights" that bars discrimination against
afflicted workers and commits its signers to
combat employee fears about contracting the
disease at work.
The code of principles also rejects mandatory
testing of job applicants or employees for an
tibodies to the virus that is believed to cause
AIDS, and stresses the need for strict con
fidentiality of employee medical records.
"We believe the AIDS Workplace Principles
can provide leadership in this complex and
emotionally charged arena in much the same
manner that the Sullivan Principles offered
guidance regarding investment policies in
South Africa," said John Zuccotti, co-chair of
the Citizens Commission on AIDS, the
privately funded group that came up with the
guidelines.
The code was endorsed by such major cor
porations as IBM, AT&T, ITT, Chemical Bank,
Johnson & Johnson, Warner-Lambert, Time,
Dow Jones and Times Mirror, publisher of
the Los Angeles Times.
