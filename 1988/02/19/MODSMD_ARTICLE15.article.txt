# Reagan unveils $1.1 trillion budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - President
Reagan, leaving to his successor
many of the harsh choices re
quired to put the federal
government's budgetary house in
order, yesterday unveiled a $1.1
trillion spending blueprint that
calls for a wide variety of politi
cally sensitive defense cuts but
increases outlays for education,
scientific research and the battle
against AIDS.
If the economy remains in
healthy shape, Reagan predicted
that his budget would reduce the
federal deficit to $129.5 billion in
the fiscal year that begins next
Oct. 1, down modestly from an
estimated $146.7 billion for the
current fiscal year.
Abandoning his confrontational
approach with Congress, Reagan's
budget for fiscal year 1989 con
forms to a broad agreement on
government priorities that was
forged by the White House and

lawmakers last November in the
wake of the stock market crash.
Reagan acknowledged that his
budget, which includes some
minor tax increases that Congress
has already enacted, "does not
fully reflect my priorities" but
represents "give and take on all
sides."
"In presenting this budget, I
am keeping my end of the bar
gain," Reagan said in submitting
what, for all practical purposes,
is his last budget."I call upon
Congress to uphold its end."
By the time Reagan leaves office
next January, the national debt
will have soared from about $1
trillion in 1980 to almost $2.6
trillion.
Under the tax and spending
policies proposed by Reagan, the
budget would still be $23 billion
in deficit in 1993. And even that
deficit reduction requires that the
nation's economic expansion last

an unprecedented 11 years.
The administration proudly
points to the annual 2.6 percent
economic growth rate since 1980
and a five-year economic expan
sion that already is the longest of
any in peacetime. Yet it is relying
on another six years of economic
growth averaging more than 3
percent a year just to reach a $23
billion deficit in 1993.
"The underlying problem is
that neither the president's
budget nor (the White House-
Congress) summit agreement di
rectly confronts the deficit issue,"
said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
who is expected to take over as
chairman of the House Budget
Committee next year.
"But the next president and the
next Congress will have no choice
but to act," Panetta said. "With
out action, continuing deficits will
deplete the resources we need to
take on national priorities."
