# Marine officer still missing in Lebanon

TYRE, Lebanon — Around-the
clock searches by U.N. peace-keeping
troops and Shiite Moslem militiamen
in the muddy countryside of southern
Lebanon turned up no sign yesterday
of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Wiliiam Hig
gins, the head of a U.N. observer group
who was kidnapped by gunmen near
here Wednesday.
An anonymous caller in Beirut
claimed responsibility for the kidnap
ping on behalf of a previously un
known group called the Islamic
Revolutionary Brigades, but authori
ties were unsure of its authenticity
and most suspicions pointed toward
one of the area's many militant, pro-
Iranian factions.
The caller, in a telephone conversa
tion with an international news agency
in Beirut, accused Higgins of being
"one of the directors of the CIA in
southern Lebanon." He said the

"hostage will not be freed until after
his trial," and said the captors would
follow up with another statement ac
companied by a picture of the missing
American — the method other groups
have used - to prove that they are hold
ing a captive.
Higgins, 43, who heads the 75-man
Lebanon Group of the U.N. Truce Su
pervision Organization, was seized by
gunmen and taken to an unknown
destination Wednesday as he was
driving by himself, behind another
U.N. car, enroute from Tyre to U.N.
troop headquarters in Naqurah, near
the Israeli border.
Abdel Majeed Saleh, the political
commander of the Shiite Amal move
ment in southern Lebanon, who had
met here with Higgins and his aides
for 15 hours just before he was inter
cepted, said the American was proba
bly "the captive of the same people

holding other foreign hostages in
Lebanon." Most are being held by pro-

Iranian factions.
Speaking at his home
here, four miles north
of Ras Ain, where Hig
gins was ambushed,
Saleh said that there
appeared to be a "de
termination to destroy
an international sphere
of influence in Lebanon
and its humanitarian
organizations for the

sake of swapping any foreigner within
reach for prisoners abroad."
Although he did not name the
Iranian-sponsored Hezbollah, Saleh
clearly was referring to their hostage
taking strategy in Lebanon.
Hezbollah's clergy and followers ap
peared nervous and edgy in the Tyre
area Thursday and largely kept a low

profile. Some were seen racing through
U.N. checkpoints on the coastal road
just north of Tyre, refusing to stop.
Timor Goksel, spokesman for the
U.N. peace-keeping force, said in a
telephone interview that there were
no leads as to where Higgins had been
taken.
Shiite Amal militiamen, in coordina
tion with U.N. troops, checked cars
and expanded a 24-hour hunt for Hig
gins in rural villages. Amal fighters
said they were under "strict orders"
to find Higgins and not to sleep before
locating him.
Amal officials said fog, rain and poor
visibility had helped the kidnappers
and prevented effective searches by
U.N. helicopters.
U.N. Undersecretary General Mar
rack Goulding cut short a visit to
Damascus and flew back to Beirut.
