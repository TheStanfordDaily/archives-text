# Babbit, du Pont quit
## 
### 
Democrat Bruce Babbitt and Repub
lican Pierre "Pete" du Pont IV, two
former governors who campaigned as
outsiders willing to challenge their par
ties' orthodoxies, dropped out of the
presidential race yesterday.
In analyzing his defeat, Babbitt pro
vided an epitaph that could apply to
either campaign. "It's asking an awful
lot (of voters) to say: 'Consider both a
new messenger and a challenging and
difficult message,' " he said at the Wash
ington news conference where he an
nounced his withdrawal from the race.
"There's a little bit of lag time, ac
ceptance time, in American politics."
Both men, newcomers to the national
stage, took on powerful traditions and
constituencies: Babbitt, for example,
called for a means test that would limit
Social Security benefits for the wealthy,
while du Pont proposed an end to federal
farm subsidies and a plan to phase in
a private system of retirement benefits
that could replace Social Security.
In ending their campaigns, both in

sisted that while they had lost, their
crusades had changed the race â€” and
both hinted that they might try again
in the future. "The fascinating thing
about American democracy is we tend,
historically, to postpone coming to grips
with change," said Babbitt, 49, the
former governor of Arizona. "What I've
been trying to do in the last five or six
months is drive the other candidates
toward the water hole."
Du Pont, 53, a former Delaware gover
nor and congressman, noted the contro
versial positions he had taken and said:
"We have moved those challenges for
ward to the center of the debate; they
are urgent, they are real, they will not
disappear."
Babbitt is the first of the Democratic
candidates to withdraw from the race.
Du Pont is the second GOP candidate
to withdraw from the race, following
former Secretary of State Alexander
Haig Jr., who pulled out Friday.
