## ASSU power play 
### 
LAST WEEK, the ASSU Sen
ate and the COP forgot they
were at Stanford. Perhaps
the senate and the COP thought
they were on Capitol Hill: Vetoes
were signed and special fees were
tabled as emotions flared.
The senate publishes an elec
tions handbook in which it recom
mends how students should vote
on the spring ballot's special fee
requests by student groups. After
the senate decided what its recom
mendations would be this year, the
COP vetoed its decision.
The veto was on target. The sen
ate made its decisions based on
the advice of the Senate Appropri
ations Committee, which reviewed
the budgets and interviewed the
representatives of each group that
is seeking special fees. But the
committee never provided the sen
ate with good reasons for following
its advice, and the senate decided
without asking for detailed, writ
ten justifications from the commit
tee.
In not providing explanations of
its recommendations, the commit
tee was simply following proce
dures that had been adhered to
for two years. The COP's veto was
based on dissatisfaction with those
procedures.
But if the COP had made its
expectations clear, the entire mess
could have been avoided. From the
beginning of the process, the COP
failed to communicate with the ap

propriations committee.
The COP had plenty of oppor
tunity to make it clear to the com
mittee and the senate that it
wanted procedures to change. A
member of the COP is present
throughout the entire special fee
requests process. A COP member
participates in the committee's
proceedings, and all four COP
members are present when the
committee makes its recommenda
tions to the senate.
There is no excuse for misun
derstandings over format, proce
dure or expectations between the
COP and the senate. Without any
warning or indication of impending
COP disapproval, the veto was a
literal bolt from the blue.
The veto came at the end of
weeks of work by the committee
and the senate. Instead of allowing
the process to run its course to
completion, the COP should have
warned senators that it would veto
any senate action unaccompanied
by written explication.
Hopefully, the senate and the
COP will learn something from all
this. Namely, this is Stanford,
Calif., and not Washington, D.C.
The ASSU is a body of which the
COP and the senate are crucial
parts. They should work together
rather than wasting time and en
tertaining thoughts of making ex
amples of each other or playing
power games.
