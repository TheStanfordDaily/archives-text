## Surrogacy contracts aren't mechanically enforced 
### 
IT IS ALWAYS SAD when people
toss off moral assumptions without
a thought, as if they were
"natural" or "obvious." The result is
that kind of little knowledge which is
a dangerous thing.
Take columnist Kay Devgan's Feb.
11 column, "Surrogacy is a Right."
Whose right? The man's or the
woman's? Devgan would say both: If
both parties are competent ("carefully
screened and found physiologically and
psychologically capable of undergoing
the procedure"), then whatever they
agree to ("Surrogacy is a freedom of
choice issue") should be enforced by
the courts ("they have a responsibility
to enforce contracts").
Why? Because, Devgan argues, "baby

selling" isn't such a bad thing after
all, and people are always going to find
ways to circumvent rules against sur
rogacy contracts, and very few sur
rogacy agreements generate dispute,
and there's nothing wrong with afford
ing women who cannot conceive an
opportunity to have a child though a
surrogate.
But Devgan has missed a vital dis
tinction here. It is true that if sur
rogacy contracts are "baby selling,"
then those contracts are illegal. But it
does not follow that if surrogacy con
tracts are not "baby selling," then such
contracts should be strictly enforced.
All illegal contracts are unenforceable;
but not all (or even many) unenforce
able contracts are illegal.

Devgan'B arguments against the
illegality of surrogacy contracts are
reasonably sensible. There is no reason
why a carefully regulated surrogacy
industry ought not exist. But her
assumption that she has also made the
case for strictly enforcing surrogacy
contracts rests on a dubious (or at
least controversial) moral assumption.
Devgan thinks that "a deal's a deal."
If a person knows what she is doing,
she ought to be held to the conse
quences. But how is it possible that a
woman entering into a surrogacy
contract ever really knows what she is
doing? How is it possible for her to
accurately anticipate the moral conse
quences of giving up her baby?
Carrying a child to term is simply

unlike calculating future production
schedules or warehouse stock. There is
no defendable way of assimilating the
surrogacy contract to, for instance, a
long-term sales contract.
If Devgan entered into a long-term
employment contract with me and
later changed her mind, I would not
be able to have a court force her to
work for me (although I might be able
to get money damages). Slavery is
unconstitutional; her labor is hers, and
I cannot legally force her to give it up.
Why should I be able to force her to
give up the fruits of a very different
kind of labor?
