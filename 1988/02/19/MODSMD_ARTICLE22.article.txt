# Idea of Robertson is a frightening one
## 
### 
Shame on Rafael Delfin, who in a
Feb. 16 letter broke the famed 11th
Commandment, "Thou shalt not attack
a fellow Republican." I am referring to
Delfin's vitriolic response to Keith
Nashawaty's column on presidential
candidate Pat Robertson.
Whatever faults Delfin thinks Nas
hawaty's comment had, it was none
theless indisputably on the mark about
Robertson, the Attila of the current
presidential sweepstakes.
Bluster and brouhaha about "moral
fiber" notwithstanding, Robertson is
not electable — and thank God for
small favors. (Pass the ammunition
while you're at it, bub.)
Robertson won the caucus in Hawaii,
granted. There is some dispute about
whether he should have won Michigan,
but I'll even grant him that victory.
There is also no question that his
second-place showing in lowa was a

coup de grace. But the media blew it
all out of proportion.
The support of 25,000 lowans is now
considered some sort of mandate (just
as 27 percent of the electorate turning
out in 1980 was a Reagan "landslide"),
and Dole and Gephardt, who finished
first on their respective sides, are left
to languish in the interior of the news
section while Robertson dominates the
front page with his saintly smile and
his protestations that he's not, by
golly, a "televangelist."
What an insult, Tom Brokaw.
Robertson now disavows that he ever
had anything to do with the An
tichrist, and his many celebrated faith
healing voodoo sessions on the 700
Club, I suppose, are water under the
bridge. Fine.
And now he's saying he's victim of
the same "religious bigotry" that
plagued John F. Kennedy in 1960.
Terrific.
All this would be reason to laugh if
it were not for the fact that Robertson
has significant support, as I'm sure
Delfin can attest. Robertson apparently

taps a right-and-wrong vein in a great
many people, people who need to be
mollified that ambiguity is just another
name for deceit.
Robertson wants to head off the
naysayers who predict this country is
headed the way of Spain in the 1700s
and Britain in this century.
But we have to ask ourselves: At
what cost, this "moral fiber"? A diet of
tree bark and Puritanical homily,
perhaps?
All this mobilization and organiza
tion means, at the minimum, that
Robertson could whap several of his
fundamentalist planks down on the
New Orleans convention table come
summer and scare mainstream
Republicans out of their heads with
demands for a militant social agenda
— like pro-life and pro-school prayer
planks — that most Republicans are
wary about siding with in an election
year.
But nonetheless, I think we're all
safe from the type of "virtue" Delfin
espouses. Like they say, this election
will probably, like most elections, be

decided on the economy, and since
Robertson's economic ideas (despite his
impressive entrepreneurial resume) are
at best unoriginal, there is no reason
to think he'll be nominated.
Delfin'a attack on Nashawaty
reminds me of Voltaire's nice quip that
you can kill a flock of sheep with
curses as long as you give them
enough arsenic at the same time.
Remember the 11th Commandment,
Monsieur Delfin?
