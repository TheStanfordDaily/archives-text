## Ernie can't Konn me 
### 
THE 12TH CONGRESSIONAL dis
trict of California — Stanford's dis
trict — has a history of electing
some the House of Representatives'
brightest stars: Ed Zschau, Paul N.
"Pete" McCloskey. And why not the best?
The 12th is the seat of a mayor university
and the home to the brainy, hi-tech,
entrepreneurial population of Silicon Val
ley.
But when Ed Zschau vacated the 12th
to campaign for Alan Cranston's Senate
seat, our tradition of excellence came to
an abrupt halt with the election of one
Ernie Konnyu, an obscure state as
semblyman from Saratoga.
You know: Ernie! That triple-chinned
fighter of government waste who regu
larly stuffs your mailbox with those blue
pieces of toilet paper masquerading as
"Constituent Newsletters," which always
end up littered in huge drifting piles on
the post office pavement. All of that Kon
nyu t.p., incidentally, is printed and
mailed at taxpayer expense. Some Re
publican.
At least Ernie won't be back in 1989.
Come January we'll have a new Con
gressman, Stanford Law professor and
rival Republican Tom Campbell. Here's
why.
Konnyu's burned his bridges with the
House GOP leadership. Early last year,
after being denied a seat on the oh-so
crucial District of Columbia Committee,
he accused his senior Republicans of forg
ing "an unholy alliance" with the Dem
ocrats. A bigger mistake was his blasting
high-ranking Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass.,
— on the very floor of the House, no

less — for disloyalty to the party. Such
things, to coin a phrase, are simply not
done by freshman Congressmen. But
Konnyu has other troubles.
Ernie's a ladies man — sort of. During
the past session, according to the San
Jose Mercury News, Konnyu accused
staffer Michele Morse of wearing outfits
he deemed too masculine and asked in
stead to see her in some frilly frocks and
high heels. He even asked her to turn
around so he could "see what you look
like." But wait, there's more. At a sem
inar last spring, Konnyu approached an
other female aide and asked her to move
her nametag. Why? Because, he told a
Mercury News reporter, the tag was
"right over her boobs." Oh dear. "She is
not exactly stacked, OK?" So what did
you tell her, Ernie? "[l] told her to move
the darn tag off her boobs." Both women
have since resigned.
Jeesh. These and other "incidents"
make it no wonder that recent Konnyu
toilet paper mailings have featured
photos of Ernie looking various women
in the eye, stressing his deep and newly
found commitment to "women's issues."
Konnyu makes Dabney Coleman's
Franklin Hart, Jr. character in the com
edy "9 to 5" look like Alan Alda.
Konnyu even (in a move destined to
crush the Red Menace once and for all)
passed around a memo prohibiting Coca-
Cola products in his office, because, read
the memo, Coke "is the only brand of
soft drink sold in Communist China."
Wrong: Pepsi sells there too. But
enough's enough. Ernie's an embarrass
ment.

Tom Campbell, at 35 the youngest
tenured professor at Stanford Law
School, seems to possess the energy, ex
perience, and horse sense to win the
voters' confidence. He's already stripped
from Konnyu the priceless backing of
moguls William Hewlett and David Pack
ard, plus Ed Zschau and Pete McCloskey.
Like McCloskey and Zschau, Campbell is
a centrist: moderate to conservative on
economic issues, downright progressive
on social policy and reluctant to let the
United States play world policeman in
foreign policy. Konnyu snipes that such
positions prove that Campbell & Co. are
fake Republicans. He'll be changing his
tune after he loses the June 7 primary.
And the Democrats? Well, the 12th
was gerrymandered in 1980 to go GOP,
but a well-known local figure with the
ability to raise lots of cash could buck
the trend. (Are you listening, Don Ken
nedy?) As usual, however, none of the
several Democrats running, including the
capable and eloquent Jim Garrison, has
either the recognition or the money. As
a result, the only real race for the 12th
will take place in the GOP.
Hence Tom Campbell.

tune after he loses the June 7 primary.
And the Democrats? Well, the 12th
was gerrymandered in 1980 to go GOP,
but a well-known local figure with the
ability to raise lots of cash could buck
the trend. (Are you listening, Don Ken
nedy?) As usual, however, none of the
several Democrats running, including the
capable and eloquent Jim Garrison, has
either the recognition or the money. As
a result, the only real race for the 12th
will take place in the GOP.
Hence Tom Campbell.

THE 12TH CONGRESSIONAL dis
trict of California — Stanford's dis
trict — has a history of electing
some the House of Representatives'
brightest stars: Ed Zschau, Paul N.
"Pete" McCloskey. And why not the best?
The 12th is the seat of a mayor university
and the home to the brainy, hi-tech,
entrepreneurial population of Silicon Val
ley.
But when Ed Zschau vacated the 12th
to campaign for Alan Cranston's Senate
seat, our tradition of excellence came to
an abrupt halt with the election of one
Ernie Konnyu, an obscure state as
semblyman from Saratoga.
You know: Ernie! That triple-chinned
fighter of government waste who regu
larly stuffs your mailbox with those blue
pieces of toilet paper masquerading as
"Constituent Newsletters," which always
end up littered in huge drifting piles on
the post office pavement. All of that Kon
nyu t.p., incidentally, is printed and
mailed at taxpayer expense. Some Re
publican.
At least Ernie won't be back in 1989.
Come January we'll have a new Con
gressman, Stanford Law professor and
rival Republican Tom Campbell. Here's
why.
Konnyu's burned his bridges with the
House GOP leadership. Early last year,
after being denied a seat on the oh-so
crucial District of Columbia Committee,
he accused his senior Republicans of forg
ing "an unholy alliance" with the Dem
ocrats. A bigger mistake was his blasting
high-ranking Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass.,
— on the very floor of the House, no

less — for disloyalty to the party. Such
things, to coin a phrase, are simply not
done by freshman Congressmen. But
Konnyu has other troubles.
Ernie's a ladies man — sort of. During
the past session, according to the San
Jose Mercury News, Konnyu accused
staffer Michele Morse of wearing outfits
he deemed too masculine and asked in
stead to see her in some frilly frocks and
high heels. He even asked her to turn
around so he could "see what you look
like." But wait, there's more. At a sem
inar last spring, Konnyu approached an
other female aide and asked her to move
her nametag. Why? Because, he told a
Mercury News reporter, the tag was
"right over her boobs." Oh dear. "She is
not exactly stacked, OK?" So what did
you tell her, Ernie? "[l] told her to move
the darn tag off her boobs." Both women
have since resigned.
Jeesh. These and other "incidents"
make it no wonder that recent Konnyu
toilet paper mailings have featured
photos of Ernie looking various women
in the eye, stressing his deep and newly
found commitment to "women's issues."
Konnyu makes Dabney Coleman's
Franklin Hart, Jr. character in the com
edy "9 to 5" look like Alan Alda.
Konnyu even (in a move destined to
crush the Red Menace once and for all)
passed around a memo prohibiting Coca-
Cola products in his office, because, read
the memo, Coke "is the only brand of
soft drink sold in Communist China."
Wrong: Pepsi sells there too. But
enough's enough. Ernie's an embarrass
ment.

Tom Campbell, at 35 the youngest
tenured professor at Stanford Law
School, seems to possess the energy, ex
perience, and horse sense to win the
voters' confidence. He's already stripped
from Konnyu the priceless backing of
moguls William Hewlett and David Pack
ard, plus Ed Zschau and Pete McCloskey.
Like McCloskey and Zschau, Campbell is
a centrist: moderate to conservative on
economic issues, downright progressive
on social policy and reluctant to let the
United States play world policeman in
foreign policy. Konnyu snipes that such
positions prove that Campbell & Co. are
fake Republicans. He'll be changing his
tune after he loses the June 7 primary.
And the Democrats? Well, the 12th
was gerrymandered in 1980 to go GOP,
but a well-known local figure with the
ability to raise lots of cash could buck
the trend. (Are you listening, Don Ken
nedy?) As usual, however, none of the
several Democrats running, including the
capable and eloquent Jim Garrison, has
either the recognition or the money. As
a result, the only real race for the 12th
will take place in the GOP.
