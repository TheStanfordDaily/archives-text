## Cheerleaders are OK 
### 
Brendan healevs Feb. 10
column about the Stanford
cheerleaders was a poor example
of journalism.
Healey's criticism of the cheerleaders
is his personal right, but to print such
a column in the campus newspaper is
wrong, especially since it is apparent
that he knows little about collegiate
cheerleading. Unfortunately, this is not
the first time The Daily has put down
the new squad and not given them a
fair chance.
In defense of the cheerleaders, the
squad deserves credit for putting an
attractive, ethnically diverse group in
front of Stanford crowds. Factions of
such crowds are quite obnoxious and,
in demonstrating "Stanford intellect,"
threw water balloons at the feet of our
own squad at Big Game.
It takes quite some time to master
the skills and techniques of modern
collegiate cheerleading.
While our squad is not at the level
of being invited to the Collegiate
Cheerleading Championship, held
annually in San Diego (no Pac-10
squads have ever been invited), they
are doing well for a squad that has
been practicing for only six months
with little student support at first.
It takes a great deal of conditioning
and time to reach the level of squads
from such schools as Kentucky, Ohio
State and North Carolina State. The
Stanford squad is improving with each
performance.
At the Arizona game, the crowd
responded well to the cheerleaders'
chants and cheers, despite what Healey
stated.
Cheerleaders help to unify the crowd
in its vocal support for the team,
thereby making us a stronger "sixth
man" for the basketball team.
In past years, before the cheer
leaders, half of the student section
would start a cheer, while the other
half would start a different cheer, thus
creating a mumbled noise of indistin
guishable babble.
Credit should also go to the cheer
leaders for starting new traditions such
as the Stanford "spell-out" while a
cheerleader is tossed from side-to-side
by the others.
They also have given us an enter
taining dance routine to "All Right
Now," which is an appreciated alterna
tive to what was previously offered.
As for the Dollies, not only do they
"make no pretensions about being

cheerleaders," as Healey stated, they
seemingly make no pretensions about
being a dance squad.
The Dollies have been around for
years, and have never qualified to
compete in the Collegiate Dance Team
Championship of the Collegiate Cheer
leading Championship (note that the
two categories are intertwined).
Judging from the performances of the
squads that continue to turn up an
nually, they never will.
This year's squad dressed up at Big
Game like "second rate Vegas show
girls," according to the San Jose Mer
cury News, performs "sychronized
swim movements," according to the
San Francisco Examiner and skillfully
rode scooters around the track at
football games like true Stanford intel
lectuals.
Though they have had a few good
moments, there is a limit to the
amount of tired sequential movements,
silly facial expressions and simple,
boring "dance" moves (devoid of any
gymnastics) that a person can stand.
After a while, it becomes funny to see
the Dollies go on as they do in front
of crowds.
Healey failed to note in his column
that at the Arizona State game the
ASU female cheerleaders performed a
dance-pompon routine during a time
out and received a good ovation from
the Stanford crowd.
The Dollies took the floor at the
next time-out, looking wilder and
decidedly heavier than the neater ASU
squad, and received no ovation.
The student section was quiet at
that particular time-out because it is
not possible to cheer to the Band's
sometimes dated rock songs of the
1970s and tired routine.
There is nothing wrong with a dance
squad or pompon squad (whatever you
prefer to call them) helping to lead
cheers with the cheerleaders and to
effectively support the team.
UCLA's dance/pompon squad cheers
collectively with their cheerleaders.
The famous Memphis State dance/pom
pon squad (it has never lost the Col
legiate Dance Team Championship and
is regularly invited to perform at many
professional games and events) is also
humble and earthly enough to help
lead sideline cheers with their cheer
leaders.
One can only imagine the reception
a squad such as Memphis State's
would receive at Maples.

I am sure the Dollie's form of "en
tertainment" would be considered
interesting to others across the
country, to say the least.
Furthermore, I find it amazing that
the University permits the sexist and
somewhat selectively discriminatory
Dollie-selection process to continue.
No, I am not advocating the selec
tion of male Dollies. Rather, it is
difficult to believe that prospective
Stanford Dollies, intelligent Stanford
students mind you, tolerate being told
to show "T and A" by the Band, when
dance ability should be considered
solely, though it does not seem to be
the top priority.
The ones who are scrutinized by the
Band are the "lucky" ones who pass
the first round judging by the alumnae
Dollies from the '60s and '70s. Rarely,
it seems, does a female without a
frizzy, flying permed hairstyle and with
skin color darker than a nice tanned
hue advance past the first round.
From this process, mediocre squads
are annually produced under the delu
sioned thoughts that they are cute,
talented and unique, mainly because
that is what the Band tells them.
The cheerleaders should be com
mended for fighting the adversity they
have faced from factions of the Stan
ford community and for showing prog
ress in their first-year performances.
I am sure that those same factions
of the Stanford crowds can rid them
selves of the obnoxious "we're too
intellectual, we're above this" attitude.
If we lived with the Band and Dollies
after all these years, we can accept
anything.
Hopefully the cheerleading squads
and the Dollies can become more
cohesive and work together to add
another exciting element to collegiate
athletic events and to better represent
the name of Stanford when they take
to the field or to the court.
