## Boycott needs attention 
### 
DURING THE NEXT few weeks I
and others will be urging atten
tion to a proposal that students
in each residence decide whether
grapes should be served in their dining
service. Some might ask, "Why do the
issues surrounding the proposed
boycott merit such attention?" Fur
thermore, "If they are so darn impor
tant, why doesn't the University just
decide the matter for us and either
serve grapes or not?"
Although all may not find the issues
important, I do. We are being asked by
some members of the Stanford commu
nity to confront at least two questions
that they regard as socially, politically
and morally compelling. Do grape and
other growers use pesticides and her
bicides in ways that endanger the
health, well-being and even lives of
farm workers? Of consumers? Are farm
workers improperly restrained, through
intimidation and violence, from organ
izing to bargain collectively about such
matters with the growers as is their
lawful right?
If the answer to one or both of the
questions is "yes," the United Farm
Workers and their supporters would
have us boycott grapes as a means to
express our disapproval and to enhance
their powers to bring about changes.
If the answer to one or both of
those questions is "no," the growers
would have us buy and eat grapes —
or at least stay out of the fray.
We cannot turn the other way and
say that these are problems that really
don't touch us. I believe that the
questions are significant and worthy of
our attention. If people are being killed
or maimed by the careless use of
pesticides, how can we afford to sit

idly by when a simple act on our part
might make a difference?
If, on the other hand, there is the
crying of "wolf' for ulterior reasons —
then we have other choices to make.
So let's pay close attention when the
arguments are set forth in the weeks
ahead and make the best choices we
can.
You may ask, "Why doesn't Stanford
decide for me? Why not just impose a
boycott centrally and just tell the food
services to lay off grapes and buy
other fruits?" That question touches
on one of the important missions of a
free university: to help students learn
to make free, responsible and informed
choices.
It is right for Stanford to protect
and encourage ideological exploration
and debate. It is wrong for the Univer
sity to make policies or to take actions
that bind the inquiring minds and
spirits of those of us who work, teach
and study here.
Wouldn't the rightful and dutiful
choice of individuals be pre-empted if
the University centrally decided this
matter for the students? I think so.
These are issues that are quite prop
erly decided by individual residences to
be implemented by their respective
dining rooms. Those are the venues
where the University and MEChA have
invited the UFW and the growers to
make their cases and where students
can make their choices.
I hope that students will take advan
tage of the forum and the many other
forthcoming efforts to make informa
tion available about these issues. Then
they can make, and not avoid, in
formed choices.
