# Hoover chief was describing candidate
## 
### 
W. Glenn Campbell, director of the
Hoover Institution, has asked me to
write and inform The Daily that in an
otherwise excellent Feb. 16 article, The
Daily stated, or perhaps did not under
stand, that his remarks in terms of
the two most important issues —
namely, to "make certain that we
maintain peace by doing research and
work on deployment of the Strategic
Defense Initiative and make sure this
process doesn't get sabotaged;" and
"stopping the increase on taxes on the
young folks to support us old folks" —

were personal statements in terms of
what a candidate, either Democrat or
Republican, would have to do in 1988
in order to get his support.
They were not statements concerning
the relative importance of the 40 or
more important subjects that will be
addressed in "Thinking About America:
The United States in the 19905." So
far, no announced candidate has met
his conditions.
