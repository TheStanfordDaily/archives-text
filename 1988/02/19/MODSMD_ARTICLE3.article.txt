# Kennedy, Rosse address demands
## Respond to minority concerns 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
University President Kennedy
and Provost James Rosse strove
to clarify the University's position
on various minority issues in a
recently released letter in
response to minority community
demands, according to former
BSU Chair Steve Phillips.
According to Rosse, the 25 de
mands released by minority stu
dents in a Third World Agenda
last May, "were not easy to
answer."
Phillips said the letter serves
more as a clarification of the is
sues rather than as a "show of
policy."
For instance, in response to the
Agenda's demand that the Uni
versity allocate $5,000 to fund up
coming You Can Make a Differ
ence Conferences, Rosse and Ken
nedy explain how funds for the
event are secured from various
departments on campus.
Responding to demands that de
facto ceilings on minority staff ad
vancement be removed, Kennedy
and Rosse argue that no such
ceilings "intentional or otherwise"
exist, while they admit that
minority representation on upper
management levels is "insuf
ficient."
Phillips agreed but argued that
the fact that no minority deans
exist at Stanford "does not reflect
the fact that there is not talent,
but simply the highest level you
can rise to is the level of assistant
dean."
Kennedy and Rosse wrote that
"the University is troubled by this
disparity and has asked the
Human Resource Council" to ex

amine the problem in the coming
year.
In some cases, the two admin
istrators reject the Agenda's de
mands as not feasible.
They argue, for example, that
the establishment of a provost for
minority issues is less important
than focusing on increasing
decentralized recruitment of
minority staff members.
Working to increase minority
faculty representation in honor of
the Stanford Centennial Cam
paign is also not necessary, Ken
nedy and Rosse argue, because
increased minority recruitment
efforts are already taking place
on a University-wide level.
However, Phillips replied that
"to say that a program exists
when you have one or two percent
of minority faculty is a condemna
tion of the program."
To improve the situation, the
two administrators wrote that "a
revitalization of these programs"
is a "priority" for the coming year.
In the nine months since the
demands were made, Kennedy
and Rosse assert that the Univer
sity has already responded to a
number of the Agenda's demands.
For instance, the University es
tablished a Committee on Minor
ity Issues in response to demands
that a commission be set up "to
study and report on the institu
tional environment for minority
students."
A demand specifying that "cul
tural diversity" become a major
focus of freshman orientation was
also answered when this year's
orientation activities introduced
several programs emphasizing
communication and cultural
awareness.
