# The
						curious Bug uncovers covert yogurt

Dear Bug,
And what kind of bug are you supposed
to be? Exactly what species of the class
Insecta has six legs, a stinger, a double
chin and antennae that look like cross
sections of Hostess Ho-Ho's ? Who are you
trying to kid, and just what proof is there
that this type of insect has a greater
capacity for wisdom than the average
dung beetle?
-S & M
The average dung beetle lives in dung;
I live in University housing. Is there any
question about my capacity for wisdom?

Dear Bug,
Why does White Plaza smell like raw
sewage?
— Who nose
Dear Bug,
Why does Tresidder smell like vomit?
— Scott Free
Thanks to the dozen or so of you who
wrote in asking about the smells emanat
ing from (pick one) Tresidder, White
Plaza, Dinkelspiel, Old Union, the Book

store and the Post Office. These smells
have been described as (pick one) raw
sewage, vomit, rotting bodies and rotten
eggs. So it should come as no surprise
to learn that several rotting bodies in
the sewers have been eating raw eggs
and subsequently vomitting.
No, not really. It just smells that way.
I think most people figured the smell
was raw sewage and that we were all
breathing in copious amounts of the stuff
while biking between Tresidder and Old
Union. Death was to be expected.
The sewage people, however, were
pretty certain that the smells were not
sewage. According to them, there had
been a sewage line in the past that was
a problem, but it has long since been
fixed and the sewage lines are leak free.
Nice folks that they are, however, they
promised to go right out and check the
lines again. The next day they called back
to say that all the sewage lines were
intact and deodorized, and that I would
have to find a new source for the smells.
They suggested I call the Tresidder man
agement.
And Tresidder had the answer. Forget
the corpses, eggs, sewage — the whole
nine yards. The solution to this smelly
question is far more yucky than any of
those odorous items. Can you say .. .
yogurt!
That's right, yogurt. We all know that
the Corner Pocket has delicious sweet
tasty frozen yogurt; the staple snack food
for a great percentage of the Stanford
community. As a food establishment, the
Co Po is equipped with a specially de
signed disposal mechanism known in
layman's terms as a sink. The excess
yogurt is supposed to be disposed of by
placing it in the said receptacle. However,
for reasons which are not at all clear,
some employee(s) of the Corner Pocket
saw fit a few weeks ago to dispose of the
yogurt by pouring it down the grate of
one of Stanford's steam tunnels.
Why would somebody pour yogurt into
a steam tunnel? Did they think it was a

storm drain? This is a plausible expla
nation. Are they communist miscreants?
Another plausible explanation. All we
know is that somebody poured yogurt
where no yogurt has gone before.
For those of you unfamiliar with Stan
ford's heating system, be aware that the
campus is linked by a series of subter
ranean tunnels through which hot steam
(As opposed to what? Cold steam?) is
pumped. This means that when some
thing gross gets into a steam tunnel the
wonderful odor is able to travel all over
campus. Certainly you've had the unfor
gettable experience of walking past a
steam grate and getting a blast of
whatever has died down there in the last
few months.
Naturally, as soon as the fro yo hit
the steam tunnel it was fro no mo. This
unfro yo soon became gro to the nose.
Yogurt, as everybody knows, is made out
of milk fermented with bacterium.
Nobody in their right mind would think
of smelling this stuff, much less eating
it, unless it was loaded with apples, sugar
and cinammon to disguise its true nature.
My mother, of course, does eat yogurt
in all of its natural fermentedness, but
of course she lost her taste buds years
ago through repeated ingesting of such
disgusting foodstuffs as kim chee (rotten
cabbage), snails and cherry-flavored Pez.
When cooked with steam the yogurt
achieves that marvelously pungent odor

which we had the pleasure of experienc
ing in the past weeks. Luckily, the Tres
idder people opened the steam grate and
cleaned out the yogurt. They also hung
up a giant air block (a Stick-Up the size
of New Hampshire).
The end result is that the greater White
Plaza vicinity should have ceased to
smell. (Don't tell me it's smelled for five
years; I don't want to hear it.) Remember
that filling the steam tunnels with yo
gurt, candy, slime with eyeballs or Cheese
Whiz will cause new and amazing smells
to pop up. Send your nominations for

Dear Bug,
Why are there A parking lots and C
parking lots but no B parking lots?
- VW Bug
Long ago (when dinosaurs roamed the
earth and Western Culture was a Los
Angeles yogurt company) there were A,
Band C parking lots. A parking lots were
for close, convenient parking. B parking
lots were for medium, semi-convenient
parking. C parking lots were for parking
in the boonies.
As Stanford began to expand in the
sixties and seventies, many buildings
such as the Law School, Terman Engi

neering Center, Hoover and the library
expansion were built on old parking lots.
Because of this reorganization of
campus buildings they found that some
of the B parking lots were just as close
to main buildings as A or C parking lots.
To solve this inequity they decided they
would simply eliminate B parking lots
and reassign them as A or C parking lots.
So now we have A parking lots and C
parking lots. Parking permits for A lots
cost $120 and guarantee close parking
with plenty of vacancies. Parking permits
for C lots cost $24 and guarantee that
you will be the proud owner of a pretty
sticker.
The reason they didn't change the
names to A and B or Close and Far is
because it was just cheaper to take out
the B signs than replace them all.
Dear Bug Me,
Can chickens swim?
Ya know, you'd think that if the density
of a bird is such that it can fly, it ought
to be able to float. But supposing it can
float but it can't swim, what happens?
Does it just kind of tip over and drown
because its head stays underwater, or
does it sit in the middle of the lake and
paddle as hard as it can but not move
because its feet aren't webbed?
— The Colonel Sanders Nautical Team
Why if I had a nickel for every stupid
question I get .. .
As a matter of fact, Colonel, you've
done a fine job of analyzing this question.
Chickens are not, by general consensus,
the Esther Williams of fowl.
When thrown into water a chicken's
first instinct is to panic like crazy. Come
to think of it, that's my first instinct
too. Chickens do float, but they generally
flop about and panic so much that they
end up drowning themselves. In fact, the
number one cause of death among active
chickens is standing up in a canoe when
they have been specifically told not to do
so.
