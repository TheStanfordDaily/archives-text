"Good Morning, Vietnam" isn't
as much of a movie as it is a
showcase for Robin Williams. Wil
liams gives a great performance
and he deserves his Academy
Award nomination, but there just
isn't much of a movie here.
It's loosely based on the life of
Adrian Cronauer, a disc jockey
with Armed Forces radio who was
a pain in the neck to his superiors
during the Vietnam war.
The backdrop of Vietnam isn't
important to the movie. In fact,
it's almost totally ignored. It's like
a concert film that just happens
to be set in Vietnam, 1965.
Director Barry Levinson lets
Williams improvise during his
broadcast scenes which results in
some funny moments but a very
unorganized movie with a strung
together feeling.
Levinson's usually smooth
touch ("Diner," "Tin Men") seems
hardly evident here — a lot of
the shots are shaky, out of focus
and sloppily set up.
Although there are a lot of
laughs, there really isn't any more
substance than there is to a Robin
Williams concert. In fact, a Robin
Williams concert would have been
better.

Nepotism has its rewards.
Writer-director David Mamet has
packed "House of Games" with
his wife, his poker buddies,
friends from the theater and
former students to create the best

American-made film noir since
"Body Heat."
This is a film about risk. The
lush, romantic cinematography
continually draws the eye to
things of red and black — roulette
colors. The heroine, a psychia
trist, dares to get directly involved
in the lives of her patients.
Lindsay Crouse (Mamet's wife,
and a veteran of stage and screen)
plays it cool as the psychiatrist.
"Psychiatry is just a con game,"
the doctor admits.
If Crouse is a con artist, she
meets more than her match in
Joe Mantegna, proprietor of the
House of Games, a sleazy bar and
pool room with a little illegal gam
bling going on in back. It is filled
with uneasy silence and stark
lighting lifted right from an Ed
ward Hopper canvas.
Mantegna's Mike has all the

dangerous charm of Bogart, and
a brooding sexual presence that
creates riveting chemistry be
tween him and the frosty doctor.
He makes you believe that Mike
could seduce anyone into any
thing.
Even after he tries to cheat her,
Crouse remains magnetized by
him. It is truly frightening to
watch her descend from the world
of clinical certainty into the world
of the con, where nothing is what
it seems and the only rule is
"don't trust nobody."
The further she delves into this
netherworld, the more she begins
to resemble her patients. The line
between normal and pathologic
becomes increasingly unclear. Ul
timately, she falls into theft, mur
der and a trap that will leave you
gasping with its diabolical bril
liance.

The film's only major flaw must
be laid at the feet of David Mamet.
A renowned playwright, author of
"Glengarry Glen Ross" and
"Sexual Perversity in Chicago,"
his dialogue and direction at times
seem stiff and "stagey."
On the other hand, its theatri
cal attention to detail is what
makes it so satisfying, visually
and intellectually. The five dollars
you put on a ticket is one of the
safest bets around. Trust me.

Take the popular genre of hor
ror movies, add a touch of

academics, and the outcome is
"The Serpent and the Rainbow."
Dr. Dennis Alan (Bill Pullman)
is sent by a medical company to
search for a "zombie powder" that
they believe will be the super an
esthetic of the future.
Alan arrives in Haiti and
quickly gets involved with not
only with his mission but also the
beautiful and politically radical
doctor, Marielle (Cathy Tyson).
Together, they search for the se
cret of zombies and fight against
the evil, powerful black magician
Peytraud (Zakes Mokae), who is
also the head of the secret police
in Haiti.
Inspired by the non-fiction book
written by Wade Davis, a
Harvard-trained anthropologist,
"The Serpent and the Rainbow"
tries to be different from regular
zombie flicks.
It still has all the indispensible
elements of horror movies: dark
graveyards, lots of blood, explicit
sex, suggestive torture, rotten
corpses and zombies.
Set in the heat of pre-revolution
Haiti, the movie does poorly in
transmitting the political turmoil;
but it is successful in depicting
some of the peculiar cultural and
religious aspects of Haitian soci
ety.
Wes Craven, who also directed
"A Nightmare on Elm Street,"
once again illustrates his ability
of molding reality and fantasy to
gether; the smooth transition
from one to the other is almost
imperceptible.
"She's Having a Baby"

"She's Having a Baby," the
latest John Hughes film, is about

marriage and domesticity in the
1980's. Kevin Bacon and
Elizabeth McGovern are the
young couple, and the movie puts
them through the "traditional"
antics of early marriage: bad
cooking (hers!), job trouble (his!),
flirtations, infertility problems,
pregnancy.
We've seen it all before; it's the
stuff sitcoms are made of, only
here it's packed into one movie.
There's no big climax, but a series
of mini-climaxes. Imagine six
episodes of "Family Ties" seam
lessly merged.
Alas, this movie isn't as funny
as "Family Ties." Despite a few
great moments, the gags and jokes
aren't fresh. What comedy there
is comes from Bacon's lively per
formance as the bewildered hus
band; he's surprisingly funny and
likeable.
Both he and McGovern are ex
ceptionally talented performers
and they do their best with these
narrow roles. McGovern's part in
the film is sociologically interest
ing: In several years of marriage
she apparently never initiates sex
until she decides to trick Bacon
into getting her pregnant.
This has implications which are
never explored. Why hasn't this
woman ever initiated sex? Why
does she have to trick her hus
band into starting a family? These
strange facts are passed ofT good
humoredly as the norm.
The film seems to be poking
fun at the sexes; but what exactly
is it saying about the sexes? Do
we buy it? Do we like it? The
movie has a very strange sen
sibility that is subtly disturbing.
The good laughs in this film
are interspersed with some
tedious scenes. There are some
moments here that really sparkle,
but "She's Having a Baby" is on
the whole a stale show. Don't go
in expecting too much; you'd
probably be better off watching
some sitcom re-runs.
