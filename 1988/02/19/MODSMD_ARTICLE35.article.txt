# Oscar nominations reflect Academy's changing tastes
## 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
For a change, the Academy has passed over such
pictures which it would have normally chosen and
opted for a more mainstream, commercial field of
nominees.
One would expect the Academy to nominate such
films as "Empire of the Sun" and "Cry Freedom,"
opulently produced films of high ideals and noble
intentions. Instead, the Academy has totally gone
against the grain by honoring mainstream films
like "Fatal Attraction" and even comedies like "Hope
and Glory," "Broadcast News" and "Moonstruck."

It seems as if the Academy has
made a deliberate attempt to
break out of its stodgy past, but
its choices seem more schizo
phrenic than open-minded.

It seems as if the Academy has made a deliberate
attempt to break out of its stodgy past, but its
choices seem more schizophrenic than open-minded.
On one extreme, the Academy is recognizing the
type of grand, ambitious movie it usually notices,
like "The Last Emperor." On the other hand, the
Academy seems to be pandering to box office hits
like "Fatal Attraction" in order to purposely modify
its old-fashioned image.
Out of all the best picture nominees, the inclusion
of "Fatal Attraction" is the biggest surprise, since
it had more impact as a social statement than it
did as a movie. As always, many of the other
surprises are not what was nominated but what
wasn't nominated.
For instance, Steven Spielberg's epic "Empire of
the Sun," named by the National Board of Review
as best picture, was ignored. John Huston's critically
acclaimed swan song, "The Dead," honored as best
picture by the National Society of Film Critics, was
also passed over.
Other critically touted films such as "Matewan,"
"Jean de Florette" and "Prick Up Your Ears" were

also forgotten in the best picture category.
My personal choice for best film of the year,
Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket," was also
shut out except for a screenplay adaptation nod.
This isn't really a big surprise, since other great
Kubrick movies like "2001: A Space Odyssey" have
also been shut out.
This year's unprecedented dominance of comedy
nominations was strongly felt in the best actor
category where Robin Williams scooped up his first
nomination for his funny performance in "Good
Morning, Vietnam." Somewhat of a suprise, albeit
a pleasant one, was William Hurt's nod for "Broad
cast News."
The Academy voters must have felt that nominat
ing Robin Williams was enough as far as recognizing
comedians goes. This is evident in the fact that
Steve Martin, who won best acting honors from
the Los Angeles and national film critics associations
for his work in "Roxanne," was conspicuously absent
from the Oscar list.
Other more predictable choices in the best actor
category are Michael Douglas for "Wall Street,"
who also won best actor from the National Board
of Review; Jack Nicholson for "Ironweed," who was
also honored by the Los Angeles and New York
film critics; and Marcello Mastroianni for "Dark
Eyes," who won the best actor award at Cannes.
There aren't any mgyor revelations in the best
actress category. Cher and Glenn Close are riding
on the coattails of the nominations received for
their respective films, "Moonstruck" and "Fatal At
traction."
Holly Hunter ("Broadcast News") is fueled by
her best actress victories from the National Board
of Review and the Los Angeles and New York film
critics as is Sally Kirkland ("Anne") with her awards
from the Hollywood Foreign Press (Golden Globes)
and the Los Angleles Critics Circle.
Meryl Streep, who has picked up her seventh
nomination in 14 films, is actually the dark horse
this time around for her performance in "Ironweed."
Likely candidates who didn't make the list this
year were Barbra Streisand ("Nuts"), Faye Dunaway
("Barfly"), Lillian Gish and Bette Davis ("The
Whales of August").
The big news in the best director category is that

not one American was nominated this year. This
means that James Brooks (once a winner for "Terms
of Endearment") was shut out for "Broadcast
News."
This also means that Steven Spielberg was over
looked for "Empire of the Sun" despite the fact
that he was recognized by the Director's Guild. If
you remember, something like this happened before
when Spielberg was ignored by the Academy for
"The Color Purple," yet went on to win the Direc
tor's Guild award for the same movie.
Directors fortunate enough to be on both the
Academy's and the Director's Guild lists are Ber
nardo Bertolucci ("The Last Emperor"), Adrian
Lyne ("Fatal Attraction") and the longshot Lasse
Hallstrom ("My Life as a Dog").
The other Oscar nominees for best director are
John Boorman ("Hope and Glory") who was also
honored by the National Society of Film Critics and

the Los Angeles film critics; and Norman Jewison
("Moonstruck"), whose nomination is significant not
because he deserved it but because he blocked out
a bunch of other more deserving directors, like
Brooks.
Other directors omitted from the pool of nominees
are John Huston ("The Dead"), Stanley Kubrick
("Full Metal Jacket") and Sir Richard Attenborough
("Cry Freedom.")
Who will win? Since James Brooks didn't get
nominated for best director, "Broadcast News"
doesn't stand a chance. Comedies don't usually win,
anyway. "Moonstruck" and "Hope and Glory" are
comedies, too, so they won't win.
"Fatal Attraction," as I mentioned before, was
only nominated to satisfy the mainstream mentality.
"The Last Emperor" falls into the big scale, epic-type
category of films the Academy loves to honor, so
it will probabaly win, and I think it deserves to win.

her best actress victories from the National Board
of Review and the Los Angeles and New York film
critics as is Sally Kirkland ("Anne") with her awards
from the Hollywood Foreign Press (Golden Globes)
and the Los Angleles Critics Circle.
Meryl Streep, who has picked up her seventh
nomination in 14 films, is actually the dark horse
this time around for her performance in "Ironweed."
Likely candidates who didn't make the list this
year were Barbra Streisand ("Nuts"), Faye Dunaway
("Barfly"), Lillian Gish and Bette Davis ("The
Whales of August").
The big news in the best director category is that

not one American was nominated this year. This
means that James Brooks (once a winner for "Terms
of Endearment") was shut out for "Broadcast
News."
This also means that Steven Spielberg was over
looked for "Empire of the Sun" despite the fact
that he was recognized by the Director's Guild. If
you remember, something like this happened before
when Spielberg was ignored by the Academy for
"The Color Purple," yet went on to win the Direc
tor's Guild award for the same movie.
Directors fortunate enough to be on both the
Academy's and the Director's Guild lists are Ber
nardo Bertolucci ("The Last Emperor"), Adrian
Lyne ("Fatal Attraction") and the longshot Lasse
Hallstrom ("My Life as a Dog").
The other Oscar nominees for best director are
John Boorman ("Hope and Glory") who was also
honored by the National Society of Film Critics and

the Los Angeles film critics; and Norman Jewison
("Moonstruck"), whose nomination is significant not
because he deserved it but because he blocked out
a bunch of other more deserving directors, like
Brooks.
Other directors omitted from the pool of nominees
are John Huston ("The Dead"), Stanley Kubrick
("Full Metal Jacket") and Sir Richard Attenborough
("Cry Freedom.")
Who will win? Since James Brooks didn't get
nominated for best director, "Broadcast News"
doesn't stand a chance. Comedies don't usually win,
anyway. "Moonstruck" and "Hope and Glory" are
comedies, too, so they won't win.
"Fatal Attraction," as I mentioned before, was
only nominated to satisfy the mainstream mentality.
"The Last Emperor" falls into the big scale, epic-type
category of films the Academy loves to honor, so
it will probabaly win, and I think it deserves to win.

John Lone and Joan Chen star in"The Last Emperor," the epic Bernardo Bertolucci film that picked
up nine Oscar nominations and stands the best chance of winning the award for best picture.
For a change, the Academy has passed over such
pictures which it would have normally chosen and
opted for a more mainstream, commercial field of
nominees.
One would expect the Academy to nominate such
films as "Empire of the Sun" and "Cry Freedom,"
opulently produced films of high ideals and noble
intentions. Instead, the Academy has totally gone
against the grain by honoring mainstream films
like "Fatal Attraction" and even comedies like "Hope
and Glory," "Broadcast News" and "Moonstruck."

It seems as if the Academy has
made a deliberate attempt to
break out of its stodgy past, but
its choices seem more schizo
phrenic than open-minded.

It seems as if the Academy has made a deliberate
attempt to break out of its stodgy past, but its
choices seem more schizophrenic than open-minded.
On one extreme, the Academy is recognizing the
type of grand, ambitious movie it usually notices,
like "The Last Emperor." On the other hand, the
Academy seems to be pandering to box office hits
like "Fatal Attraction" in order to purposely modify
its old-fashioned image.
Out of all the best picture nominees, the inclusion
of "Fatal Attraction" is the biggest surprise, since
it had more impact as a social statement than it
did as a movie. As always, many of the other
surprises are not what was nominated but what
wasn't nominated.
For instance, Steven Spielberg's epic "Empire of
the Sun," named by the National Board of Review
as best picture, was ignored. John Huston's critically
acclaimed swan song, "The Dead," honored as best
picture by the National Society of Film Critics, was
also passed over.
Other critically touted films such as "Matewan,"
"Jean de Florette" and "Prick Up Your Ears" were

also forgotten in the best picture category.
My personal choice for best film of the year,
Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket," was also
shut out except for a screenplay adaptation nod.
This isn't really a big surprise, since other great
Kubrick movies like "2001: A Space Odyssey" have
also been shut out.
This year's unprecedented dominance of comedy
nominations was strongly felt in the best actor
category where Robin Williams scooped up his first
nomination for his funny performance in "Good
Morning, Vietnam." Somewhat of a suprise, albeit
a pleasant one, was William Hurt's nod for "Broad
cast News."
The Academy voters must have felt that nominat
ing Robin Williams was enough as far as recognizing
comedians goes. This is evident in the fact that
Steve Martin, who won best acting honors from
the Los Angeles and national film critics associations
for his work in "Roxanne," was conspicuously absent
from the Oscar list.
Other more predictable choices in the best actor
category are Michael Douglas for "Wall Street,"
who also won best actor from the National Board
of Review; Jack Nicholson for "Ironweed," who was
also honored by the Los Angeles and New York
film critics; and Marcello Mastroianni for "Dark
Eyes," who won the best actor award at Cannes.
There aren't any mgyor revelations in the best
actress category. Cher and Glenn Close are riding
on the coattails of the nominations received for
their respective films, "Moonstruck" and "Fatal At
traction."
