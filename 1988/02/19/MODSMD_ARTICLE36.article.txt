## Cardinal baseball can't make errors 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Make no mistake
about it: the Stan
ford baseball
team's series with
UC-Santa Barbara
this weekend is
big.

"We have to win this series —
there's no question about that,"
senior Jeff Saenger said. "We've
already lost two series, and those
will be crucial later in the season
(when NCAA playoff berths are
chosen)."
The Cardinal, 7-5 on the season
and ranked eighth in the Baseball
America poll and 16th in the
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball poll,
hosts UC-Santa Barbara at 2 p.m.
today at Sunken Diamond. The
series continues with games at 1
p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Cal
State-Los Angeles comes to
Sunken Diamond at 2 p.m. Mon
day.
The Gauchos, who opened the
season with six straight losses and
won one of their first nine games,
have rallied in the past week to
bring their record to 9-10. They
have always been tough on Stan
ford, winning seven of the teams'
last 12 meetings.
"They've played well against
us," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "They're a quality
team."
And UC-Santa Barbara does
what the Cardinal has been un
able to do this season: it scores
runs in bundles. If Stanford is
going to win, it will have to make
like Motown and start producing
hits.
"We're trying to get over this
malaise, I guess you'd call it,"
Saenger said. "We've started to
meet the ball better . . . but we
haven't hit with men on. We
haven't put pressure on people.
We want to try to put a run up
every inning.
"Eventually the gates are going
to open."
"We need to score some runs
and get some confidence,"
Marquess said. "We don't have a
lot of confidence, and rightfully

so, because we haven't done
much."
The Cardinal especially needs
production from the middle of its
order. Ron Witmeyer, Ed Sprague
and Paul Carey — the third,
fourth and fifth batters in the
order — are batting ,217, .289
and .222, respectively, with three
homers (all by Sprague) between
them.
"Obviously, our problem is in
the middle of the order,"
Marquess said. "I'm sure they'll
come around, though. It's con
tagious — once one of them
breaks out, it'll take the pressure
off the rest of them."
In the meantime, Stanford will
continue to rely on its pitching
staff and defense. The staff has
a combined ERA of 3.46, com
pared to 4.38 for its opponents.
Senior Lee Plemel, 1-1 on the year
with a 4.18 ERA, will start today,
with freshman Mike Mussina (2-
1, 1.96 ERA) going tomorrow and
freshman Stan Spencer (2-1, 3.00
ERA) getting the call Sunday.
The return of Brian Keyser,
who was sidelined with an elbow
injury and made his first start of
the season on Wednesday, will
ease the pressure on the bullpen,
especially during busy weekends
like this one.
The defense continues to
sparkle. The team has a .981 com
bined fielding percentage and has
made a lot of plays that don't
show up in statistics. In Wednes
day's 5-3 win over the University
of San Francisco, both rightfielder
Paul Carey and leftfielder Brian
Johnson made crucial running
catches to stem Dons rallies.
"I haven't had a team play this
well defensively," said Marquess,
who is in his 11th year as Stan
ford's coach.
The musical chairs in center
field continues. Junior Eric
DeGraw started both games this
week, and will start today's game
against the Gauchos. He is the
fourth player — joining freshmen
Mike Eicher and Albert Richard
son and junior Jack Hollis — to
start in that position for the Car
dinal this season.
