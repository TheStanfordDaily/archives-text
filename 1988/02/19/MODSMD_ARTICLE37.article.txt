# Hoops battles Harmon crowd
## California had been down on its luck but is up for Stanford 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
On January 23, just minutes before
the tip-off, the California marching
band obnoxiously strode across Stan
ford's Maples Pavilion floor, effec
tively interrupting the Cardinal's
warm-ups. Stanford trounced the
Golden Bears 70-54.

On Sunday, however, the Cardinal (16-8 overall,
8-5 in the Pacific 10 Conference) will have to deal
with that band and a ruffian crowd all afternoon.
"Cal at home is a totally different thing," Stanford
center Greg Butler said yesterday. "On the road
you can push them around and intimidate them,
but with the crowd at home they play more aggres
sively and with more confidence."
In front of nothing but sellout crowds at Harmon
Gym, the Bears are 5-6 this year. Overall, Coach
Lou Campanelli's squad is 8-13, 5-8 in the Pac-10,
and has been coming on strong.
Last weekend California garnered a rare sweep
of the Washington schools, defeating Washington
84-82 in overtime and Washington State 82-76.
Until then, the Golden Bears had spent much of
the season trying to determine the answer to the
proverbial question, "Who's on first?" Now they
know.
"They're starting (John) Carty now, which must
mean they like him better than (Hartmut) Ortmann,"
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said. "And of
course (freshman Roy) Fisher is playing now and
he's a much more active player. Depth-wise they
are a lot better, and with that they feel they can
play more physical."
Before this renaissance, the Bears were basically
a one-man show. That one man was Notre Dame
transfer Matt Beeuwsaert, but when the Cardinal
mugged and muffled him, the Bears were rendered
helpless. Times have changed.
"I don't think Cal is relying on Beeuwsaert as
much — they have more weapons now," Mont
gomery said.

Washington 3-10 7-15

Those weapons include the bomber Ryan Drew,
who periodically bullseyes from three-point range
for upwards of 30 points, and Fisher, who had 18
points against Stanford in January. Drew was
named the Pac-10 Player of the Week last week.
Whenever the Cardinal has let an opposing player
go bonkers, the odds of a loss have been greater.
Washington's Eldridge Recasner, Washington
State's David Sanders and Oregon's Anthony Taylor
all drained the nets and left Stanford in the losing
locker room this season.
"Anytime anybody's had a big game it has spelled
trouble for us," Montgomery said. "Drew is a streaky
shooter, and that concerns us."
Meanwhile, the Bears will have to be concerned
with the inside game of Stanford. Butler and
Howard Wright have both blossomed over the season
to provide a strong presence in the paint. Wright,
who was Player of the Week two weeks ago, is
second in the conference in scoring with an 18.9
mark, and is averaging 7.6 rebounds a game.
Butler, who will be playing in his last Big Game
rivalry, scores 13.9 and bounds 6.2 per game.
Sunday's game will be broadcast live at 3 p.m.
