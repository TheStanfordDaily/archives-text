# Cardinal spanks Bears, 94-79
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Last night, Maples Pavilion seemed
more like a gunnery range than an
athletic arena, as the Pacific 10
Conference-leading Stanford
women's basketball team outshot
California 94-79 to secure the squad's
'23rd win of the season.

The Cardinal is now 23-1 overall, 11-1 in the
Pac-10 and ranked No. 9 on the Associated Press
poll. The unranked Golden Bears drop to 13-11,
4-8 in league.
The win also marked the first time that Stanford
has swept Cal on the road and at home, as well as
taking a dent out of the Bears' 9-3 series lead.
"I was pleased with the general team intensity,"
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I just felt
we could play a lot of people and keep going at
them with bodies and really try to wear them down
a bit.
"I don't want to say it was a typical Stanford
game, but I hope this becomes kind of typical, that
we can get out on people and maintain our lead."
Defending its lead occupied almost all of the Car
dinal's time in this contest, as Stanford managed
to outscore Cal almost immediately after the tip-off.
Golden Bear guard Meme Fanner drove inside to
chalk up the game's first pair of points, but Stanford
sophomore forward Katy Steding quickly responded
with a bucket and free-throw at 19:30 to put the
Cardinal up for good.
Then Stanford really began to roll, accumulating
a 12-4 lead on sophomore guard Jennifer Azzi's
49th three-point basket of the season. Azzi, the
team's leading scorer overall and the 15th-most
prolific three-point shooter in the country, scored
her 51st three-pointer and 9 more points to lead
the Cardinal at the final buzzer with 18, her largest

total in two weeks.
In addition, the sophomore dished out a game
high nine assists with no turnovers to move into
third on the Stanford career assist list.
"There's been a lot of things I've been working
on in the past couple of weeks in practice, getting
confidence back," Azzi said. "It's kind of hard when
you have a triangle-and-two — somebody's always
on you. It gets kind of frustrating, but once you
get over the frustration it gets easier to play.
"It's not because they played a different defense
that I played better. I just think that I took my
time more. Instead of worrying about mistakes, I
tried to do other things."
"I think she really got her shot going, especially
in the second half," junior center and fellow starter
Jill Yanke said. "She ran the court well, really got
people moving. She had a good game."
In the two teams' last meeting in Berkeley, Azzi
was the main victim of Cal's junk defenses that
kept Fanner and freshman Laura Baker on her at
all times, forcing her to uncork outside shots and
three-pointers. Though Cal abandoned this failed
strategy. Coach Gooch Foster couldn't seem to find
a bettenHefense.
"Their defense honestly didn't impress me that
much," VanDerveer said. "Any time you score 57
points in the first half, you aren't talking defense.
"They pressed, and Jennifer killed their press;
they zoned, and we shot well from outside; they
manned, and we got the ball inside. Their offense
impressed me more than their defense."
Both teams' offensive play was impressive, potent
and dynamic throughout the entire game. At the
9:57 mark in the first half, Stanford had amassed
a respectable 27-13 lead, but Cal began to match
the Cardinal basket-for-basket for the next three
minutes until a Stanford streak extended the score
to 39-22.
With just 5:40 to go, freshman center Tammy

Svoboda and junior guard Emily Wagner came alive.
Azzi connected with Svoboda on several scores,
bolstering the freshman's 10-point first-half per
formance.
Wagner picked up right where she left off last
weekend, when she played the best basketball of
her college career to lead Stanford's victorious effort
against the then-Pac-10-leading Washington.
Against Cal, the junior reeled off six points in the
last seven minutes of the first stanza, including a
spectacular 8-foot off-the-glass pull-up shot.
At the half, Stanford enjoyed a 57-42 advantage.
Freshman forward Trisha Stevens led the Cardinal
with 12 points, while Yanke — who at 6-foot-5 was
the tallest player on cither bench — pulled down
a team high four rebounds.
"The smaller they are the quicker they are, so I
really need to work on my defense," Yanke said.
"Rut it is nice to have that height advantage for
my shots and rebounding."
The second half was essentially the same, with
Cal trying to close the scoring gap but only coming
within 10 of the Cardinal cache. When it was all
over, Bear freshman forward Teresa Palmisano had
scored 24 points and senior forward Amanda Hay
20, impressive totals but not enough for the win.
Azzi led the Cardinal effort with her 18 points,
followed closely by Stevens' 16. Yanke ended the
game with 12 points and seven rebounds, while
freshman forward Ann Adkins contributed a valu
able eight points.
"I think we were really ready to play, really fired
up to play." Azzi said. "We have better communi
cation post-to-guards. It's not just an inside game
or an outside game but a combination, and that's
winning.
"We were all playing well together, and that's a
great feeling."

get over the frustration it gets easier to play.
"It's not because they played a different defense
that I played better. I just think that I took my
time more. Instead of worrying about mistakes, I
tried to do other things."
"I think she really got her shot going, especially
in the second half," junior center and fellow starter
Jill Yanke said. "She ran the court well, really got
people moving. She had a good game."
In the two teams' last meeting in Berkeley, Azzi
was the main victim of Cal's junk defenses that
kept Fanner and freshman Laura Baker on her at
all times, forcing her to uncork outside shots and
three-pointers. Though Cal abandoned this failed
strategy. Coach Gooch Foster couldn't seem to find
a bettenHefense.
"Their defense honestly didn't impress me that
much," VanDerveer said. "Any time you score 57
points in the first half, you aren't talking defense.
"They pressed, and Jennifer killed their press;
they zoned, and we shot well from outside; they
manned, and we got the ball inside. Their offense
impressed me more than their defense."
Both teams' offensive play was impressive, potent
and dynamic throughout the entire game. At the
9:57 mark in the first half, Stanford had amassed
a respectable 27-13 lead, but Cal began to match
the Cardinal basket-for-basket for the next three
minutes until a Stanford streak extended the score
to 39-22.
With just 5:40 to go, freshman center Tammy

Svoboda and junior guard Emily Wagner came alive.
Azzi connected with Svoboda on several scores,
bolstering the freshman's 10-point first-half per
formance.
Wagner picked up right where she left off last
weekend, when she played the best basketball of
her college career to lead Stanford's victorious effort
against the then-Pac-10-leading Washington.
Against Cal, the junior reeled off six points in the
last seven minutes of the first stanza, including a
spectacular 8-foot off-the-glass pull-up shot.
At the half, Stanford enjoyed a 57-42 advantage.
Freshman forward Trisha Stevens led the Cardinal
with 12 points, while Yanke — who at 6-foot-5 was
the tallest player on cither bench — pulled down
a team high four rebounds.
"The smaller they are the quicker they are, so I
really need to work on my defense," Yanke said.
"Rut it is nice to have that height advantage for
my shots and rebounding."
The second half was essentially the same, with
Cal trying to close the scoring gap but only coming
within 10 of the Cardinal cache. When it was all
over, Bear freshman forward Teresa Palmisano had
scored 24 points and senior forward Amanda Hay
20, impressive totals but not enough for the win.
Azzi led the Cardinal effort with her 18 points,
followed closely by Stevens' 16. Yanke ended the
game with 12 points and seven rebounds, while
freshman forward Ann Adkins contributed a valu
able eight points.
"I think we were really ready to play, really fired
up to play." Azzi said. "We have better communi
cation post-to-guards. It's not just an inside game
or an outside game but a combination, and that's
winning.
"We were all playing well together, and that's a
great feeling."

Sophomore guard Jonnlfer Azzi, who upped her
season total to 51 three-point field goals with
three last night, scored a team-high 18 points.

Last night, Maples Pavilion seemed
more like a gunnery range than an
athletic arena, as the Pacific 10
Conference-leading Stanford
women's basketball team outshot
California 94-79 to secure the squad's
'23rd win of the season.

The Cardinal is now 23-1 overall, 11-1 in the
Pac-10 and ranked No. 9 on the Associated Press
poll. The unranked Golden Bears drop to 13-11,
4-8 in league.
The win also marked the first time that Stanford
has swept Cal on the road and at home, as well as
taking a dent out of the Bears' 9-3 series lead.
"I was pleased with the general team intensity,"
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I just felt
we could play a lot of people and keep going at
them with bodies and really try to wear them down
a bit.
"I don't want to say it was a typical Stanford
game, but I hope this becomes kind of typical, that
we can get out on people and maintain our lead."
Defending its lead occupied almost all of the Car
dinal's time in this contest, as Stanford managed
to outscore Cal almost immediately after the tip-off.
Golden Bear guard Meme Fanner drove inside to
chalk up the game's first pair of points, but Stanford
sophomore forward Katy Steding quickly responded
with a bucket and free-throw at 19:30 to put the
Cardinal up for good.
Then Stanford really began to roll, accumulating
a 12-4 lead on sophomore guard Jennifer Azzi's
49th three-point basket of the season. Azzi, the
team's leading scorer overall and the 15th-most
prolific three-point shooter in the country, scored
her 51st three-pointer and 9 more points to lead
the Cardinal at the final buzzer with 18, her largest

total in two weeks.
In addition, the sophomore dished out a game
high nine assists with no turnovers to move into
third on the Stanford career assist list.
"There's been a lot of things I've been working
on in the past couple of weeks in practice, getting
confidence back," Azzi said. "It's kind of hard when
you have a triangle-and-two — somebody's always
on you. It gets kind of frustrating, but once you
get over the frustration it gets easier to play.
"It's not because they played a different defense
that I played better. I just think that I took my
