# Spikers beat SDSU; face Loyola tonight

This is the one
they needed.
Stanford's
men's volleyball
team, winner of
five straight, fi
nally got a win

over a team that really mattered
by beating No. 6 San Diego State
12-15, 15-10, 15-5, 19-17 on Wed
nesday night in San Diegu. Stan
ford continues its travels down
south this weekend as it faces
Loyola-Marymount tonight and
USC Saturday.
Not to belittle any of the Car
dinal's (7-6 overall, 2-2 in league)
other victories, but this was cer
tainly the team's biggest win of
the year. The Aztecs' league
record fell to 2-2, as they dropped
into a sixth-place tie with the No.
12 Cardinal.
Stanford won the match at the
net, scoring with big hits and mas
terful blocks all evening long.
Sophomores Dan Hanan and
Craig Forsyth and freshman John
Alstrom led the Cardinal attack
with 21, 20 and 20 kills respec
tively. Stanford also received a
very strong effort from freshman
Mike Lowe, who started in place
of the injured Jay Ogas. Lowe
recorded five blocks and hit at a
solid .381 clip for the match.
"Mike turned in a very solid
performance," Stanford Asst.
Coach Ruben Nieves said. "He
came through when we really
needed him."
Senior outside hitter Brad Nel
son was also able to give the Car
dinal an unexpected boost off the
bench, hitting .467 for the match.
"[Nelson] helped us pull through
when things got tight," Nieves
said.
But perhaps the key to the
match was the Cardinal's ability
to contain San Diego State's all
world middle blocker Hugh
Foster. Foster, who leads the

Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association with over 5.5 kills per
game, wasn't ever able to get un
tracked against a stingy Cardinal
defense. Foster finished with 19
kills, but was never as big of a
factor as he had to be for the
Aztecs to win.
"I was especially pleased with
our blocking," Nieves said. "We
had to contain their big guys and
we did. That was the most im
portant aspect of our game."

'We can go into the
match as the under
dogs and play as
hard as we can with
nothing to lose.'
— Dan Hanan

Stanford is hoping the win over
the Aztecs will set the tone for
the rest of the Cardinal's road
trip through southern California.
Sophomore Dan Hanan com
mented hopefully before the team
left on Wednesday that "the
match against San Diego (State)
is the big one. We need to start
the road trip out right." And they
did.
The Cardinal is now in the proc
ess of making final preparations
for tonight's game with Loyola-
Maramount. The Lions (8-7) have
already been defeated handily
once this year by Stanford, which
cruised to a three-game victory
on Feb. 3 in Maples Pavilion. The
Cardinal was able to easily con
tain a Loyola attack that can, at
times, be surprisingly potent. Fur
thermore, Stanford hit very well
in that match, recording a hitting
percentage of well over .400.
"We can't be overconfident with
the Loyola match," Stanford
Coach Fred Sturm said. "We need
