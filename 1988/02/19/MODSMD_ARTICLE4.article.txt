# Drell argues for INF treaty approval in Senate testimony
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Sidney Drell, co-director of the Center
for International Security and Arms Con
trol at Stanford, "strongly urged" the
Senate yesterday to support the ratifica
tion of the arms control treaty between
the United States and the Soviet Union
signed at the Washington summit in De
cember.
The agreement, generally called the In
termediate Nuclear Forces treaty,
eliminates land-based intermediate range
missiles from Europe and marks the first
time the superpowers have agreed to dis
mantle and destroy an entire class of
weapons.
Drell, who is also deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator, testified
yesterday before the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee, which has primary
responsibility for the treaty and will pre
sent the agreement before the full Senate
when it comes up for a vote, probably
in early April.

Although both President Reagan and
General Secretary Gorbachev already
signed the treaty, two-thirds of the Sen
ate must consent to all treaties before
the president can put it into effect.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., has said he is "optimistic" about
ratification, but that the treaty will un
dergo "intense scrutiny" before the Sen
ate vote.
In Drell's testimony, requested by the
committee, he called for the ratification
of the INF treaty on the basis of three
arguments.
First, he said that the reductions in
numbers of missiles are "in our strategic
interest" and will "remove one rung in
the escalation ladder of nuclear war in
NATO."
Second, he argued that the verification
provisions of the treaty "are fully ade
quate and constitute valuable and un
precedented progress in instituting coop
erative measures of verification."
He said the measures "provide the
groundwork for progress toward a firmer

base for verifying future treaties," and
that the provisions, which enumerate the
facilities acceptable for inspection on each
side, meet U.S. verification needs "with
out exposing us to the danger of 'intel
ligence fishing expeditions.' "
Third, Drell asserted that ratification,
"will give concrete evidence that the two
superpowers, . . . working together, can
resume progress toward reducing the
threat of nuclear conflict."
Drell also addressed treaty critics who
say its scope is too limited and its reduc
tions militarily insignificant. He argued,
"Even a limited step in reducing nuclear
weapons can assume much greater im
portance if it portends continuing inter
actions and dialogue between the par
ties," and if it directs "progress toward
still more valuable agreements."
Drell emphasized that his endorsement
represented his "own personal views and
not those of any organization."
George Bunn, a CISAC fellow and an
ambassador to the Geneva Conference of
1961-1968, said that within this ratifica

tion procedure the executive branch often
makes promises to senators "that you'll
build, research, and test new weapons"
in order to get their votes, sometimes
leading to "excessive" spending and con
struction He said this process produces
"all kinds of terrible bargains," both in
ternationally and at home.
Nonetheless, Bunn, like Drell, empha
sized the critical importance of ratifying
the treaty. He said that because arms
control negotiations have become "the
single most important measure of
relations" between the United States and
the U.S.S.R., there will be a "major im
pact" on relations if the INF pact is not
approved.
Bunn said the "potential poles" of
results of the Senate debate are "a bi
partisan consensus for a positive future
of arms control negotiations, including
strategic reductions, or a total frustration
of the arms control process and a signif
icant worsening of relations."
Regardless of the general optimism and
crucial importance attached to the treaty,

Bunn outlined three obstacles the treaty
must hurdle before it is ratified.
The first stumbling block is the broad
institutional issue of how treaties are
made and interpreted, a question that
influential senators "will squeeze the last
ounce of flesh out of the Administration"
in order to resolve, according to Bunn.
The issue has been raised in response to
recent debate over the interpretation of
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,
which limits testing of weapons in space
and calls into question Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative.
The debate hinges on whether tes
timony about the meaning of a treaty,
made at the time of its ratification, binds
future administrations to the same in
terpretation. A movement headed by Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chair of the Armed
Services Committee, has linked the res
olution of this issue to the ratification
of the INF treaty.
A joint letter from Nunn and Foreign
Relations Committee Chair
Claiborne Pell, D-R.1., warned
that if the Reagan ad
ministration's practice of broadly
reinterpreting the ABM treaty
was upheld and applied to the
new treaty, it would greatly com
plicate the approval of the INF
pact.
Another obstacle to ratification
involves political maneuvering
and attaching ammendments that
would either change the meaning
of the treaty, possibly requiring
its renegotiation, or effectively
"kill" it by making it unacceptable
to more than one-third of the Sen
ate.

Conservatives in the Senate
want to "slow down the ad
ministration's progress" towards
a substantial strategic arms
agreement, Bunn said. This can
be done by changing the language
in the treaty in order to "limit
what administrations can do in
future arms control negotiations,"
he said.
A third tactic that threatens the
treaty is "the killer am
mendment." The Senate could
adopt changes in the language of
the treaty, and thus approve the
treaty on an understanding incon
sistent with the original intent.
The president would probably not
ratify a reinterpreted treaty, and
the Soviets would likely reject it
as a new "counter-proposal," ac
cording to Bunn.
