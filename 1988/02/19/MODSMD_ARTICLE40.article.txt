# Tennis sweeps
## Kentucky falls

What a difference
a year makes.
Last year in the
National Indoor
Team Champion
ships in Louisville,
an injury-riddled

Stanford men's tennis
bowed 5-4 to Kentucky. Yesterday
in the second round of this year's
tournament, however, the top
ranked Cardinal (with Georgia)
dusted off the 14th-rated Wildcats
6-0 in its first singles sweep of
the season.
No Stanford player even needed
three sets in his match. With the
win, the Cardinal upped its dual
match record to 5-0.
In the quarterfinals today at 4
p.m., Stanford faces No. 10 Ten
nessee, which upset seventh
seeded South Carolina yesterday
5-0. Stanford defeated the Volun
teers 5-3 in Atlanta Jan. 23,
despite Shelby Cannon's 6-1, 6-1
victory over the Cardinal's Jeff
Tarango at No. 1 singles.
Tarango led the charge yester
day against the host school,
edging highly-rated Greg Van Em
burgh 7-5, 7-6. Patrick McEnroe
cruised past Richard Benson 6-2,
6-1, while Martin Blackman
needed two tiebreakers to best
Kentucky's Adam Malik 7-6, 7-6.
At fourth singles, the Cardinal's
Jeff Cathrall breezed past Mario
Rincon 6-3, 6-1. Glenn Solomon,
raising his dual-match record to
5-0, slammed the door on Willy
Laban by a 6-2, 6-2 score.
Barry Richards closed out the
Stanford romp by disposing of
Kentucky's Sammy Stinnett 6-3,
6-4.
