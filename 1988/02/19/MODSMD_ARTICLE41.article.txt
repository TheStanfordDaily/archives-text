# Foes get tougher for women

This weekend at
Berkeley the No. 1
Stanford women's
tennis team will
encounter its first
top-flight competi
tion of the season.

It won't be second-ranked Florida,
however, even though the Cardi
nal will be playing in the same
round-robin tournament as its co
favorite to win this year's NCAA
title.
Stanford, 5-0 in dual matches
this season, will only play fifth
ranked Miami (Fla.) today at 9
a.m. and No. 19 Clemson tomor
row at the same time.
The gathering in Berkeley in
cludes three Southern schools
(Florida, Miami and Clemson) and
three West Coast schools (Stan
ford, California and San Diego
State). The original intention of
the organizers was for each of the
Southern teams to play each of
the California teams, with the
matches taking place yesterday,
today and tomorrow.
However, the Southern schools
wanted the West Coast schools to
sign an agreement saying they
would go to Florida next year for
the same type of tournament. "I
wasn't willing to enter into that
arrangement," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said, explaining
that he couldn't be sure that the
Cardinal would be able to fund
the trip.

return trip, the Gators decided
not to play the Cardinal this
weekend. Thus, while Cal, San
Diego State, Miami and Clemson
were busy playing in Berkeley yes
terday, the Stanford team was in

active and Florida was playing in
Southern California.
"We always like to play the best
teams in the country," Brennan
said, "but I can't get involved in
these politics. I say, 'We'll see you
in the NCAAs.' "
Brennan said the cancellation
of the match will hurt Florida
more in the long run, because the
Gators in the past have entered

the NCAAs without having seen
a lot of the stronger teams during
the regular season.
"It's to their disadvantage, be
cause we have such a strong
schedule anyway," he said.
The strong portion of Stan
ford's schedule begins this morn
ing when the Cardinal takes to
the courts against Miami. Other
than perennial singles standout

Ronni Reis, the Hurricanes have
no real stars.
The Cardinal will also be with
out senior Kay Tittle tomorrow
against CJemson. Tittle will play
today against Miami, but she is
taking the LSAT exam tomorrow.
Senior Cari Hagey, who along
with freshman Sandra Birch
forms Stanford's No. 1 doubles
team, will step in.
