# Women's gymnasts seek revenge
## 
### Karen Gryler Staff writer 
The Cardinal has the
look of revenge in its
eyes.
After losing to Fuller
ton State last weekend,
the Stanford women's
gymnastics team hopes

to turn the tables tonight at 7:30 p.m.
and beat Fullerton at its own game. As
far as Stanford Coach Homer Sardina
is concerned, there's no reason to think
that the team won't do exactly that.
"We're a better team than 14th
rankad Fullerton," he said.
However, Sardina also knows that the
tough Fullerton team will leave the Car
dinal little margin for error. Tonight's
competition will come down to a matter
of hit routines — no falls, no wobbles
and no bobbles. This means the gym
nasts will have to improve their consis
tency on both bars and beam, ironing
out the kinks that have haunted them
in meets past.
Sardina geared this week's practice
with this in mind. "I've kept the bar
team very focused because if we do well
on bars, then we can carry that positive

energy over to beam," he said.
Fortunately, the Cardinal women
have never been in better shape to meet
the challenge of hitting 24 out of 24
routines. Again Sardina looks to his
impact players — Dina Amoroso, Jinny
Rhee and Alison McGann — for lead
ership.
"I think Dina can get a 9.7 on vault,"
Sardina said. "Jinny has been doing
incredibly high tumbling all week in
practice, and Alison has been looking
really good on beam," Sardina said.
In addition, he sees the steadiness
and consistency of Cheryl Doo and
Susan Banta also helping the Cardinal
effort. This team depth is allowing the
team to increase its difficulty without
compromising hit routines. Sardina
hopes this will lead to a 186.0 team
score and to individual all-around scores
for Amoroso, Rhee and McGann around
37.0.
If everything goes as Sardina plans
and the Cardinal wins tonight's meet,
the gymnasts will only have a day to
rest on their laurels. Sunday the team
meets their toughest opponents yet —
top-ranked UCLA, fourth-ranked
Arizona State, and No. 8 Oklahoma —
in the Southwest Cup.

Competing twice in one weekend
should be an advantage for Stanford.
In previous meets this has proven to
be the case; the team usually scores
higher in the second meet. Sardina ex
plained his strategy in terms of the
energy the gymnasts have in the second
meet.
"We're not going to have nervous en
ergy. Instead, we're going to be more
collected, more focused with our ener
gy," he said.
This meet also offers another exciting
opportunity for the women as they get
the chance to compete in conjunction
with the Stanford men's gymnastics
team. With this combined meet format,
the men's and women's team scores
will be added together to give a Stanford
gymnastics team score.
Though this may add a bit of fun to
the meet for the women, they cannot
slack off. Sardina is staking a lot on
these next few meets as the team enters
the critical stages of the season. "We've
got to start hitting our peak for the
next three weeks," he explained. "All
indications show we're ready to do this."
Tonight the Cardinal hopes to begin its
quest by boosting its ego with a clean
victory against Fullerton.
