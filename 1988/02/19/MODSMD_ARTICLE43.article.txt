# Boitano shines; U.S. struggles
## 
### 
CALGARY, Alberta - Dan
Jansen fell again in his last
chance to win a medal in his
sister's memory, and, with
America's medal chances fall
ing too, Brian Boitano brought
new hope of gold Thursday
night at the Winter Olympics.
Jansen fell in the 1,000-
meter speed skating race, four
days after his first fall and the
death of his sister, Jane, to
whom he had dedicated these
Olympics.
"It was very disappointing,"
Jansen said. "But what hap
pened in the past week has just
put things in an absolutely dif
ferent perspective. I don't feel
as bad as I could."
Boitano overtook Soviet Al
exander Fadecv, the leader
after compulsory figures, with
his short program Thursday
night. He finished the program,
looked up and mouthed the
words "Thank you, God," then
bowed to the crowd.
"With all the pressure going
on out there, I can t be hap
pier," said Boitano, 1986 world
champion from Sunnyvale.
Through six days of the
Olympics, the U.S. has just one
medal, a bronze in pairs figure
skating. Boitano can add to
that Saturday night in the
men's freestyle, and it could
well be gold.
After the short program,
Boitano was first, followed by
world champion Brian Orser of
Canada, who actually won the
short program. Fadeev blew
the lead when he hobbled a
combination triple axel-doublo
loop jump.
It was a bizarre day in many
ways, and not just for

Americans. Pam Fletcher,
America's best hope in the
downhill, broke her leg when
she ran into a volunteer during
warmups. An ABC-TV camer
aman was injured when a
forerunner at the ski jump hit
him in the finish area. Winds
that reached 72 mph blew a
Swiss skier right off the course
and forced postponement of the
women's downhill.
The same winds that forced
cancellation of the downhill
also caused the 90-meter team
ski jumping event to be
postponed to next Wednesday.
Stanford alumna Bonny
Warner had the best finish of
any American luger in an
Olympics, but she was sixth,
1.875 seconds away from the
bronze and 2.083 seconds be
hind Steffi Walter, who led the
East German women's second
straight Olympic luge sweep.
Fletcher broke the small
bone in the lower part of her
right leg when she collided with
a volunteer during training,
and now she's out of the
Games.
"I came down the training
hill, and you have to cut over
a cat-crossing to meet up with
the chair lift," Fletcher said.
"A man came across the exit.
We tried to avoid each other.
He went one way. I went one
way. He went the other way.
I went the other way.
"It was like hitting a tree."
The women's downhill was
postponed until Friday by wind
and blowing snow that chased
Swiss skier Brigitte Oertli, the
only starter, right off the
mountain.
