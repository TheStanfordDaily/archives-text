# Card track warms up
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Due to good early-season
preparation, the Stanford
track and field team will
be fielding its largest
team ever at Washington
Sunday. Like the Florida
Grapefruit League in

baseball, it will not count in the season
standings, but could serve as an in
dicator of the season to come. This in
door meet will be the first of the year
for many athletes, especially the distance
runners.
Several Cardinal athletes have already
qualified for the Pacific 10 Conference
outdoor championships in May and the
NCAA indoor championships in March.
Leading the field events team in Wash
ington are Pac-10 qualifiers sophomore
Erica Wheeler (who is competing in the
discus but has already qualified in the
javelin), senior John Gash (pole vault)
and sophomore Venessa Henlon (triple
jump). Sophomore Patty Purpur will
also be strong in the shot put, as well
as junior Andy Papathanassiou.
Leading the men in the distance races
is senior Steve Schadler in the 3000

meters and two-mile relay. Sophomore
Carol Gray is the meet record holder
among women in the two mile and mile
from last year, when she ran a stellar
10:24 in the two mile and 4:56 in the
mile on a slow track. Both distance
teams are predominantly underclas
smen, as Schadler is the only senior
among them.
The shorter distances are mostly filled
with freshmen. Freshman David Strang
has qualified for the NCAA indoor cham
pionships in the 800 meters with a time
of 1:50.1, while freshmen Melanie Bloch
and Jamie Fallon will run for the wom
en. High school standout James Cram
ton will have a good chance to beat the
47.84 Pac-10 400-meter qualifying time,
even on a slow track. Sophomore Chris
Barlow will also have a chance to qualify
in the 400.
Other strong competitors include
sophomore Peter Kolotouros, last year's
meet winner in the 55-meter hurdles
and Henry Green in the long jump.
This meet will be the final indoor
contest before the outdoor season begins
with the San Jose relays in two weeks.
The Cardinal hope to build momentum
with early season races and gain Pac-10
qualifying marks that they can bank on
later this year.
