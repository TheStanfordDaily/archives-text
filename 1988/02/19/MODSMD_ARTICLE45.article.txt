# Gymnastics faces rest of the best
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
The Stanford
men's gymnastics
team travels to
Tempe, Arizona
this weekend for
the Southwest
Cup. There, as it

did at the UCLA Invitational*last
weekend, and as it will in three
of its remaining six meets this
season, the Cardinal will face the

nation's best.
At UCLA, No. 4 Stanford (8-3)
placed fourth out of seven teams,
finishing behind the nation's first-,
second- and third-ranked teams
(the Bruins, Illinois and Nebras
ka). The makeup of that top four
may very well be identical to the
makeup of the top four at April's
national championships. But, if
there are to be any imposters,
they could be among the compe
tition Stanford will meet Sunday
at Arizona State.

No. 1 UCLA, which Stanford
will host next weekend in Maples
Pavilion, will again be a Cardinal
nemesis on Sunday. Also present
at the Southwest Cup, besides the
host Sun Devils, will be Oklahoma
and Michigan. Oklahoma is
ranked seventh in the nation be
hind Ohio State and Houston
Baptist, neither of whom the Car
dinal will face until the NCAAs.
Despite Stanford's inability to
crack the top three last Saturday,
junior Scott Schaffer was optimis
tic after the meet. The team's
277.75 score came despite injuries
to two of the Cardinal's top three
gymnasts, Randy Besosa and
Chuck Gerardo.
"I'd say a 277.75 is a pretty
good score, considering what we
did," SchafTer said. "We looked so
bad on high bar; we could have
at least made up two points there,
and that would have put us up
to 280 just from one event alone."
Cardinal Head Coach Sadao
Hamada said he knows his team
is capable of a team total of 280,
but that disappointing scores on
the high bar last weekend and on
the last two events of the two
previous meets, have led to scores
below Stanford's potential.
Hamada isn't sure the team is
not still susceptible to similar
lapses.
"We are still sloppy in practice
and the concentration is not that
great yet," Hamada said. "Also,
(the gymnasts) are not that con
fident on (the most difficult)
tricks yet."
This weekend, the Cardinal will
again be hampered by minor in
juries that are too close to being
major to allow any carelessness.
Hamada, therefore, will not de
termine the meet lineup until
Sunday and probably will not en
ter a full-strength team.
"I don't think I'm going to be
pushing the kids even if I have
to sacrifice a couple of points on

the team score," Hamada said. "If
I did put them on all the events,
I could aggravate the injuries."
The Cardinal's main enemies
presently come in the form of in
juries to Besosa's rotator cuff,
Gerardo's ankles, and to various
and sundry joints and muscles
belonging to sophomore Conrad
Voorsanger, who Hamada said
"was a little sore, here and there."
"Sore" in gymnastics argot can
be translated to "serious dis
abilities" in the vernacular of the
usual college student, who would
likely treat him or herself to a
day of television in self-pity.
Meanwhile, the minority of the
team is nearing peak condition,
and even with the above injuries,
Stanford is expected to score
around 280. According to
Hamada, the team is now "con
centrating more on quality and
consistency" as the actual content
of each routine is fairly well es
tablished.
Despite its reputation as an in
dividual sport, the mental side of
gymnastics competition is so sig
nificant that each gymnast works
off the intensity and confidence
of his teammates, and one bad
routine can lead to an overall
demise. The mental side is so
proportionally great because it is
a sport of precision and, like ice
skating, the excellence of a per
formance is actually judged by
officials rather than regulated by
officials as in most sports.
According to Schaffer, the Car
dinal lost its mental strength
quickly last weekend after Besosa
suffered an iryury in warm-up.
The knowledge that it has been
just an event or two away from
superior scoring in the past three
weeks boosta Stanford'a confi
dence going into Sunday's com
petition. However, the gymnasta
must overcome any doubt that a
more flawless meet is possible.

likely treat him or herself to a
day of television in self-pity.
Meanwhile, the minority of the
team is nearing peak condition,
and even with the above injuries,
Stanford is expected to score
around 280. According to
Hamada, the team is now "con
centrating more on quality and
consistency" as the actual content
of each routine is fairly well es
tablished.
Despite its reputation as an in

gymnastics competition is so sig
nificant that each gymnast works
off the intensity and confidence
of his teammates, and one bad
routine can lead to an overall
demise. The mental side is so
proportionally great because it is
a sport of precision and, like ice
skating, the excellence of a per
formance is actually judged by
officials rather than regulated by
officials as in most sports.
According to Schaffer, the Car
dinal lost its mental strength
quickly last weekend after Besosa
suffered an iryury in warm-up.
The knowledge that it has been
just an event or two away from
superior scoring in the past three
weeks boosta Stanford'a confi

petition. However, the gymnasta
must overcome any doubt that a
more flawless meet is possible.

Despite nagging Injuries to sophomore Conrad Voorsanger (shown
here on the rings) and two other gymnasts, Stanford expects to
finish In the top two In the Southwest Cup Sunday.
The Stanford
men's gymnastics
team travels to
Tempe, Arizona
this weekend for
the Southwest
Cup. There, as it

did at the UCLA Invitational*last
weekend, and as it will in three
of its remaining six meets this
season, the Cardinal will face the

nation's best.
At UCLA, No. 4 Stanford (8-3)
placed fourth out of seven teams,
finishing behind the nation's first-,
second- and third-ranked teams
(the Bruins, Illinois and Nebras
ka). The makeup of that top four
may very well be identical to the
makeup of the top four at April's
national championships. But, if
there are to be any imposters,
they could be among the compe
tition Stanford will meet Sunday
at Arizona State.

No. 1 UCLA, which Stanford
will host next weekend in Maples
Pavilion, will again be a Cardinal
nemesis on Sunday. Also present
at the Southwest Cup, besides the
host Sun Devils, will be Oklahoma
and Michigan. Oklahoma is
ranked seventh in the nation be
hind Ohio State and Houston
Baptist, neither of whom the Car
dinal will face until the NCAAs.
Despite Stanford's inability to
crack the top three last Saturday,
junior Scott Schaffer was optimis
tic after the meet. The team's
277.75 score came despite injuries
to two of the Cardinal's top three
gymnasts, Randy Besosa and
Chuck Gerardo.
"I'd say a 277.75 is a pretty
good score, considering what we
did," SchafTer said. "We looked so
bad on high bar; we could have
at least made up two points there,
and that would have put us up
to 280 just from one event alone."
Cardinal Head Coach Sadao
Hamada said he knows his team
is capable of a team total of 280,
but that disappointing scores on
the high bar last weekend and on
the last two events of the two
previous meets, have led to scores
below Stanford's potential.
Hamada isn't sure the team is
not still susceptible to similar
lapses.
"We are still sloppy in practice
and the concentration is not that
great yet," Hamada said. "Also,
(the gymnasts) are not that con
fident on (the most difficult)
tricks yet."
This weekend, the Cardinal will
again be hampered by minor in
juries that are too close to being
major to allow any carelessness.
Hamada, therefore, will not de
termine the meet lineup until
Sunday and probably will not en
ter a full-strength team.
"I don't think I'm going to be
pushing the kids even if I have
to sacrifice a couple of points on

the team score," Hamada said. "If
I did put them on all the events,
I could aggravate the injuries."
The Cardinal's main enemies
presently come in the form of in
juries to Besosa's rotator cuff,
Gerardo's ankles, and to various
and sundry joints and muscles
belonging to sophomore Conrad
Voorsanger, who Hamada said
"was a little sore, here and there."
"Sore" in gymnastics argot can
be translated to "serious dis
abilities" in the vernacular of the
usual college student, who would
likely treat him or herself to a
day of television in self-pity.
