# Wrestlers wound up for windup
## 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
Stanford's wrestling
team finishes its regular
season tomorrow night
with its second meet of
the year against San Jose
State.
Saturday is also the

last time senior captain Terry Mclntyre
will wrestle on his home mats, but
before the 190-pounder hangs up his
singlet, he and his cohorts intend to
vindicate a season-opening loss to this
same Spartan squad.
In that competition, which was held
at San Jose State, the Cardinal lost
some close matches to drop the meet,
23-15. Tomorrow could be a different
story.
"We should have beaten them last

time," Stanford Coach Chris Horpel said
at the end of yesterday's practice. "Let's
do it this time."
The Cardinal was not at full strength
during its last encounter with the Spar
tans. Steve Yarbrough, a 158-pound
sophomore who was undefeated and
untied in dual-meet competition going
into last weekend's road trip to Fresno
State and Cal State-Bakersfield, didn't
wrestle in the first matchup with SJSU
due to a knee injury. Current starters
Steve Buddie (177 pounds) and Geoff
Baum (150 pounds) were also unavail
able for the season opener.
Unfortunately for the Spartans, all
three wrestlers are ready for tomorrow's
meet, although several other members
of Stanford's team are nursing injuries.
Freshman Loren Vigil, who will com
pete with a ruptured bursa in his right
knee, faces San Jose's Joel Chew in the

126-pound bracket. Vigil lost to Chew
in their first meeting, but has beaten
him twice since then in tournament
competition. Ron Perry, who has had
problems with a rib injury in recent
weeks, takes the mat at 177 pounds.
"I think that we have a good chance
to win close to seven of our nine
matches," Horpel predicted. "But, as
always, it will take a great performance
from everyone to come out on top in
the end."
Mclntyre, the only senior on the start
ing lineup, rounds out his Stanford
dual-meet career with a match against
San Jose's Scott Gustafson, whom
Mclntyre pinned in their first meeting
this year. Mclntyre, who is a four-year
letterman, qualified for the NCAA tour
nament last season. He currently leads
the team in pins (with eight) and in
team-point accumulation.
