# Language teaching hurt by lack of funds
##

Charging that the University is
not giving adequate financial sup
port to its foreign language de
partments, several foreign lan
guage professors said their de
partments cannot fulfill their ed
ucational goals because of a lack
of funding.
According to figures from the
Registrar's office, over 20 percent
of Stanford's undergraduates will
take foreign language classes this
year, and the number is likely to

continue rising, according to
several foreign language profes
sors.
Despite the rising popularity of
foreign language classes, last year
the School of Humanities and
Sciences cut its budget for this
year's lecturer salaries, recom
mending that departments raise
the enrollments in each section.
The Provost's Office asks each
school and department to make
cuts or find new sources of income
every year, according to Tim
Warner, the director of University
Budgets. Each department must
decide where the budgetary cuts
can be made. Because some de
partments do not have the fund
ing for more lecturers, their lan
guage classes may have as many
as 25 students.
Beverley McChesney, director
of English for Foreign Students,
said that overcrowded classes are
creating bad teaching situations.
"Our primary defense for the
need of small classes is that you
cannot achieve your objectives
without them," she said.
"There is a lack of understand
ing of what the objectives for
foreign language programs are.
Undergraduates want more from
foreign language departments
than just going overseas — they
want to achieve oral proficiency,"
McChesney said. "You cannot do
that with large classes."
Susan Schofield, an associate
dean for Humanities and
Sciences, agreed that some foreign
language classes are overcrowded
but said that the cuts were ne
cessary.
"We've tried to attune (the
cuts) to enrollment data,"
Schofield explained.
"We told departments they had
to do a better job of getting stu
dents into other time slots (when
there was overcrowding) or turn
students away . . . My sense is
that it's created somewhat diffi
cult, but not terribly bad
situations," Schofield said.
But according to Ralph Hester,
coordinator of the French Depart
ment, "there is enough empirical
evidence in research to indicate
that proficiency is most efficiently
reached in classes of about a
dozen."
Senior Lecturer Hiroshi
Sakamoto of the Japanese Depart
ment also stressed the need for
small language classes. Sakamoto
came to Stanford 20 years ago to
teach a class of 10 students, and
he said all of them learned the
language well.
This year, Sakamoto and his
colleagues faced 170 people trying

to get into 100 spaces offered for
Japanese language sections. Al
though many students dropped of
their own accord, the department
gave a test after a couple of classes
to determine who would remain
in the course.
Those remaining in the pro
gram are good students, but
Sakamoto said that students' test
scores have dropped in the last
few years. He attributed lower
test scores in part to lack of stu
dent motivation because classes
are discouragingly large. "Motiva
tion is very weak with large clas
ses," Sakamoto said.
Despite Stanford's difficulties,
some of the Ivy League schools
are finding solutions to over
crowding. Peter Patrikis, execu
tive director of the Consortium
for Language Teaching and
Learning, said that Ivy enroll
ments hover between 12 and 20
people per section.
Cornell limits language classes
to 12 people. Harvard's sections
range from 12 to 14 students, and
there are about 15 students in
many of Brown's classes, Patrikis
said.
Lecturer Pilar Soler teaches

two Spanish classes this quarter.
There are 25 students in one sec
tion and 24 in the other.
"It's hard for us to give in
dividualized instruction to
students," Soler said. "Last quar
ter one of my students asked how
I thought he talked and I was
embarrassed because I couldn't
tell him," Soler said about a stu
dent she had in a conversation
class that had 22 people.
Freshman Andrea Torres said
she was frustrated with having
25 students in her Spanish class.
"I need more conversation time
and it's hard when you have a
big group of people," Torres said.
"I thought classes would be
smaller than the ones I had in
high school, but they're the same
size," she said.
Torres said she would like to
go to Salamanca but said she was
concerned that she will not be
prepared because class sizes im
pede her chances of becoming
fluent.
Although the hiring of extra lec
tures and graduate students
seems the most obvious solution
to the overcrowding problem, ac
cording to Maria Paz-Haro, direc

tor of the Spanish Language Pro
gram, this is not possible.
The School of Humanities and
Sciences clamped down on the
hiring of "pinch hitters," or out
side lecturers who are hired on a
quarterly basis if the need arises,
she said. The situation may be
come critical this spring because
the Spanish department only has
14 graduate students to teach its
20 classes and needs to hire 6
lecturers or cancel those classes.
"I was told that the dean's office
said we had used up our quota
of lecturers for the year," Paz-
Haro said.
"What can we do?" she asked.
"The enrollments are there, the
classes are crowded, and we can't
get the funding," Paz-Haro said.
"If I have to I will try to get
undergraduate students from
Hispanic countries to teach con
versation classes so I don't have
to cancel as many."
John Wang, chair of the Asian
Languages Department is facing
a similar instructor shortage. "I
hope the University will pay more
attention to foreign language in
struction. We really need more
monev for instructors," he said.
