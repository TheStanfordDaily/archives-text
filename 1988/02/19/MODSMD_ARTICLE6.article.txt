# Stanford prepares for new toxics guidelines
## 
### Jeff Album 
The University Department of
Health and Safety is gearing up
to comply with regulations issued
Tuesday for the enforcement of
Proposition 65, the 1986 Safe
Drinking and Toxic Enforcement
Act approved by California voters.
The regulations, contained in
an inch-thick document released
by the Doukmiyian administra
tion, will go into effect Feb. 27.
The department will direct ef
forts on the Stanford campus to
identify and warn students, fac
ulty and employees who are ex

posed to any one of 27 hazardous
materials identified in the new
regulations, according to Pro
grams Manager Peter Burns.
"We have plans to address that
on several levels," Burns said. The
department plans to post warning
signs on buildings and other sites
determined to contain any of the
toxic materials specified by the
regulations, according to Burns.
The sites could include build
ings at the Medical Center or
other laboratories on campus.
Meanwhile, environmentalists
and sponsors of the Toxics Act
claim that the regulations being
implemented at Stanford and
around the state will actually fail
to protect anyone from toxic pol
lution. They argue that the
regulations' minimum acceptable
levels of carcinogenic risk are dan
gerously low.
The controversial rules state
that the Toxics Act will only con
trol chemicals causing one addi
tional case of cancer in a popula
tion of 100,000. Environmen
talists and Proposition 65 adv
ocates maintain that this stan
dard is not sufficient.
Palo Alto toxicologist Dr. Inge
Harding-Barlow disputed the
validity of data used to arrive at
the one in 100,000 standard. "I
just threw up my head in horror,"
she said, referring to her prelim
inary inspection of the regula
tions.

"I have a real problem with the
data on which the standards are
being based," she said.
Burns, who will manage a
Health and Safety team imple
menting the regulations at Stan
ford, agreed that the "risk stan
dard" being used is questionable.
"I think the most interesting
feature of the standard is that it
is as much a political determina
tion as it is a scientific one," he
said. Business and industry lob
byists have campaigned for the
lower standards because they are
less costly to comply with.
James Morgan, deputy secre
tary of the California State Health
and Welfare Agency, called these
criticisms of the regulations,
"dead wrong."
"What this set of regulations
does is provide a roadmap of
predictability," Morgan said. Ac
cording to Morgan, formulas used
to determine which chemicals
pose significant risks can range
from one in 10,000 to one in 1
million.
