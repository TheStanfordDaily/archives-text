# Exiled South African:
## Sanctions necessary 
### Glen Tripp Staff writer 
An exiled South African journalist last
night urged countries and institutions
to use economic sanctions and divest
ment to combat apartheid.
But Donald Woods, journalist and au
thor of the well-known book "Biko," met
with criticism from a senior research
fellow at the Center for International
Security and Arms Control while speak
ing before an audience of 200 at Kresge
Auditorium.
Woods said the apartheid regime is
"in every way the opposite of democ
racy," and that the United States is a
central target of South African govern
ment propaganda.
The South African government im
plants the idea in the United States that
divestment will hurt blacks more than
whites, Woods said. He argued that
South African blacks are "asking us to
stop supporting their oppressors" and
impose economic sanctions.
But a debate erupted after the speech
when Former Dean of the Chapel Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, who is now a re

searcher at the arms control center,
stood up and calmly told the audience
that he had been scheduled to appear
on stage with Woods but was informed
at the last minute he would not be al
lowed to.
He explained that there was concern
with having two white panelists address
apartheid. Nevertheless, he said, he had
arranged with presentation organizers
to speak for five minutes.
Hamerton-Kelly criticized the presen
tation, saying "It seems unfair to be so
critical of South African propaganda
when what has happened here tonight
is propaganda." He then argued that
divestment was not a viable solution to
apartheid, saying economic sanctions
would only bring more bloodshed.
Hamerton-Kelly's statement brought
hisses and shouts from an audience that
clearly supported Woods' views.
The South African government
banned Woods in 1978 after the news
paper he edited protested the arrest and
murder of civil rights leader Steven
Biko. One result of his book was the
movie "Cry Freedom."
