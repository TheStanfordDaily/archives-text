# Quake shakes Bay
## Epicenter far away, Roble remains OK 
### Amy Rosenfeld 
Although Roble Hall looks none the
worse for wear, a moderate earthquake
shook the Bay Area early Saturday.
At 12:40 a.m. a tremor registering 5.2
on the Richter scale hit the area, ac
cording to Robert Urhammer, senior
seismologist at the Berkeley Seismologi
cal Laboratory. The Richter Scale is a
relative measure of the amount of en
ergy released by an earthquake.
Nothing was damaged at Stanford, in
cluding Roble, which was closed in De
cember after the dormitory was declared
seismically unsound.
The quake's epicenter was about
seven miles southeast of the Calaveras
Fault in downtown Hollister, 100 miles
southeast of Stanford, Urhammer said.
The tremor was reported as far north
as San Francisco and as far south as
Monterey.
Because of Stanford's distance from
the epicenter, few people on campus
knew the quake had occurred. Anne
Kiremidjian, associate professor of civil
engineering and co-director of Stanford's
Blume Earthquake Engineering Center,
said the relative intensity of the quake
in the Stanford area was probably no

more than one or two on the Richter
scale.
Both Urhammer and Kiremidjian said
that while people in California should
always be concerned about the possibil
ity of earthquakes, there is no reason
for undue alarm from this weekend's
quake.
Small earthquakes occur every four
or five months in this area, Kiremidjian
said, and Saturday's quake does not nec
essarily mean "the big one" is on the
way. "None of us knows when, where
or how large that will be," she said.
Most seismologists agi\je that an
earthquake of magnitude 7 or 8 on the
Richter scale — at least 100 times
stronger than this weekend's quake —
will hit the San Andreas fault in the
''near future. The San Andreas fault runs
north to south and lies a few miles west
of the Stanford campus.
Earthquakes are very difficult to
predict, Kiremidjian said, noting that
seismologists must predict the magni
tude, location and time of a quake. "We
can only say that there is a 10 percent
chance of an earthquake of magnitude
seven or eight in the next 10 years,"
she said. "That's about as close as we
can get."
