# Will receive Law School award
## Nobel winner Arias to visit 
### Dean Chisiu 
President Oscar Arias Sanchez of
Costa Rica, winner of the 1987 Nobel
Peace Prize, will visit Stanford during
the next school year to receive the Law
School's 1988 Jackson H. Ralston Prize
and give a public lecture, University
President Donald Kennedy announced
last week.
The prize was founded to honor
Ralston, a prominent U.S. international
lawyer, by his widow. According to the
terms of the grant, the prize, which
includes a $30,000 award, is to be given
not annually, but "only when especially
merited" to individuals who have made
an "original and distinguished contri
bution to the development of the role
of law in international relations."
In this context, law is defined as "all
human efforts to regulate man's ac
tions" and includes "arbitration,
diplomacy and the other means used
for the settlement of disputes."
In a Jan. 22 letter to Arias, Kennedy
wrote that members of the official se
lection panel "agree enthusiastically
that your initiative to restore peace in
Central America epitomizes the stan
dards for Ralston Prize recipients."
Arias is the architect of a Central
American peace plan which, according
to Deane Hinton, U.S. ambassador to

Costa Rica, "has changed the situation
from one of stalemate to one of new
opportunities."
The Arias plan led to the unprece
dented Esquipulas I and II agreements,
signed Aug. 7, 1987 and Jan. 15, 1988
by the presidents of all five Central
American countries. The provisions of
the two agreements are designed to pro
vide the framework for a lasting peace
in the region and include calls for cease
fire, steps toward democratization, free
elections, and cooperation for peace and
development.
"Given the historic oppression of Cen
tral America by the U.S., his contribu
tion is so important because it involves
an attempt by these countries to shape
their own destinies," said Law Prof.
William Gould, chair of the special com
mittee that recommended Arias for the
prize.
According to Gould, it is especially
important that Stanford honor Arias
now, because at the present time "our
country seems not to have much inter
est in its obligations under international
law."
The most recent selection process
began last summer when Law School
Dean Paul Brest appointed a special
committee to recommend a recipient.
The committee was chaired by Gould
and included Law Profs. Lawrence

Friedman, John Barton, Tom Campbell
and Mauro Cappelletti.
According to Gould, the committee
deliberated in September and October,
considering many prestigious names. In
October they handed Brest "a list of
names, with a recommendation for
Arias."
Brest then informed the official se
lection panel, which, in accordance with
the terms of the grant, consists of the
University president, the chief justice
of the California Supreme Court, and
the secretary general of the United Na
tions. Although they are not active in
the selection process and "only consider
a single nominee, the panel does have
the power to say no," Brest said.
In the case of Arias, "the panel
decided relatively quickly to approve the
nominee," Brest said.
Until this year only three individuals
had been chosen for the honor: Swedish
Prime Minister Olaf Palme in 1977,
Ambassador Tommy Koh of Singapore
in 1985 and former President Jimmy
Carter in 1987.
According to Gould, Palme was cho
sen "for his work on behalf of interna
tional cooperation and human rights,"
Koh, "for his contribution to the law
of the sea," and Carter, "for his role
in shaping the Panama Canal Treaty
and the Camp David agreements."
