Popular evangelist Jimmy Swaggart,
under church investigation reportedly
for adultery, tearfully confessed yes
terday that he had sinned and said
that he will leave the pulpit for an
indefinite period — marking the
second major blow to television evan
gelism within a year.
"I beg your forgiveness," Swaggart
beseeched 7,000 worshipers at his
World Faith Center in Baton Rouge,
La. Embraced by his wife, Frances,
and applaudgd frequently by his faith
ful, Swaggart heard a sympathetic
statement from an Assemblies of God
state official, who said that the fire
and-brimstone minister had confessed
with "true humility" to "specific inci
dents of moral failure."
Without naming his offenses or
denying news reports that he was seen
leaving a motel room with a prostitute,
Swaggart spoke only of his contrite
ness: "I am not going to whitewash
my sin. It was not a mistake. It was
a sin."
"I will step out of this pulpit for an
indeterminate period of time, and we
will leave that in the hands of the
Lord," Swaggart said.
Swaggart, who has alternated for
years with the Crystal Cathedral's
Robert Schuller for the largest reli
gious TV audiences, said that his
Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries,
which has a $11.5 million payroll,
would continue under the leadership

of the Louisiana District Council of
the Assemblies denomination.
Ironically, it was Swaggart who had
urged the Springfield, Mo.-based
denomination to investigate charges
of sexual immorality by fellow Assem
blies minister Jim Bakker, the
founder-president of the PTL (Praise
the Lord) television ministry and
resort park in Fort Mill, S.C.
Swaggart's role in Bakker's downfall
was not generally known, however, un

til after Bakker suddenly announced
last March 19 that he was resigning
his PTL posts, claiming he was
"betrayed" by friends into a sexual
encounter seven years earlier and that
he had "succumbed to blackmail" to
keep the incident quiet.
Bakker attempted to resign from the
Assemblies, but church officials
refused to accept his resignation. Last
May, they stripped him of his mini
sterial credentials for the sexual inci
dent with Jessica Hahn, his attempted
cover-up and "alleged misconduct in
volving bisexual activities."
Swaggart, 52, who has been quick
to chastise other preachers for straying
in doctrine or behavior, told a Los
Angeles news conference eight days
after the Bakker resignation that the
PTL scandal was a "cancer" that had
to be cut out of the church.
That night before an audience
nearly 15,000, he lashed out against
"hypocrites" and "false prophets."
Swaggart asked to be saved "from
pompadoured pretty-boys with their
hair done and their nails done who
call themselves preachers," suggesting
that "millions are deceived" and
"duped" by such people.
The Washington Post said Saturday
that Assemblies of God elders were
trying to determine whether Swaggart
had committed adultery. It quoted a
source close to the church as saying
the investigation focused on "sexual

moral charges .. . with other women."
ABC News reported Friday that New
Orleans minister Marvin Gorman was
believed to have told church leaders
that he had photographs showing that
Swaggart had visited a prostitute at
a motel room.
Gorman, defrocked by the Assem
blies for immorality, filed a $90 million
suit against Swaggart last March, al
leging that Swaggart had conducted a
defamation campaign against him.
Gorman admitted to one affair but
said that God forgave him for it. The
suit was dismissed a few months later
by a civil district judge.
Swaggart met with the Assemblies'
Executive Presbytery Thursday in
Springfield, but denominational
spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said
that she could not divulge any details,
including whether Gorman had any
thing to do with the investigation.
Swaggart was "cooperating fully," she
said.
Turnage said that if the Lousiana
district church officials decide to lift
Swaggart's credentials, denomina
tional rules permit a minister to enter
a rehabilitation program — "almost
always a two-year program." The cler
gyman seeking restoration is
prohibited from preaching the first
year and may engage in a limited min
istry the second year, she said.
