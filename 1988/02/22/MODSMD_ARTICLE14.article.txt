### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon — An Israeli
army unit with five tanks and an
armored personnel carrier raided
the Lebanese village of Beit es-
Siyad yesterday in an apparent
effort to locate kidnapped Marine
Lt. Col. William Higgins, security
sources in the area said.
The Israelis rounded up three
members of the Shia Moslem ex
tremist group Hezbollah ("Party
of God") before returning to their
base inside Israel, the sources
said.
The move came less than a day
after U.S. Secretary of Defense
Frank Carlucci said that Israel
had offered to help in the search
for the missing Marine officer.
U.N. troops, meanwhile, used
police dogs as they escalated their
search for Higgins, who was kid
napped Wednesday in southern
Lebanon, U.N. sources said.
More than 50 soldiers from the
United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon combed the hills and
groves of Ramadiyeh, Ein Baal
and Aitiet near the area where
Higgins was abducted, the sources
said.
Higgins, 43, head of a United
Nations Truce Supervision Or
ganization unit, was abducted by
unidentified gunmen as he was
leaving the southern port city of

Tyre.
In Tyre, the Shia Moslem group
Amal issued a harsh warning yes
terday against a Moslem fun
damentalist group that has
claimed responsibility for Higgins'
abduction.
"Those who executed and
planned the abduction, and whom
we know very well, must assume
their responsibilities," the Amal
leadership in southern Lebanon
said in a statement released in
Tyre.
The clandestine fundamentalist
group "Organization of the Op
pressed on Earth" Friday claimed
responsibility for kidnapping Hig
gins, saying he was a CIA spy.
The group, which has been
linked to the radical pro-Iranian
group Hezbollah, said Higgins
would be released only after the
United States stops intervening
in the Middle East, Israel
withdraws from Lebanon and re
leases the Lebanese and Palestin
ian prisoners it holds.
Amal controls the Tyre district
where Higgins was abducted. The
militia has been conducting a
massive hunt for his kidnappers
and has said it had detained eight
members of Hezbollah in connec
tion with the kidnapping.
