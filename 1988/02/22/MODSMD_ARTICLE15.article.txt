# Peres links Meese, pipeline

### 
WASHINGTON â€” Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres, confirming that
he wrote a handwritten letter to Attor
ney General Edwin Meese 111 about a
controversial Iraqi pipeline project in
1985, said yesterday that he used this
highly unusual diplomatic channel "be
cause I was approached by people who
told me that the attorney general will
deal with it."
The remarks by Peres, who was prime
minister at the time of the correspond
ence, marked the first time that he has
publicly acknowledged writing the now
classified letter, which sources say could
seriously undermine his political stand
ing if it is disclosed along with other
documents related to the proposed
pipeline.
The correspondence has raised ques
tions about why Meese, the nation's
ranking domestic law-enforcement offi
cer, was dealing directly with a foreign
head of state on an international matter
of importance to U.S. foreign and na
tional security policy.
Peres said that Meese, in response to
his letter, told him to deal with then
national security adviser Robert McFar
lane on the pipeline plan. He said Meese
told him that Secretary of State George
Shultz could not be involved because
the pipeline was to be built by Bechtel
Corp., a company that Shultz had
worked for before joining the Reagan
administration.
But Peres, in an interview with ABC's

"This Week with David Brinkley," did
not disclose who referred him to Meese
in the first place in the pipeline dealings,
which have become a primary focus of
an independent counsel's investigation
of the attorney general.
Peres denied that he knew of any
proposals to pay him or the Israeli Labor
Party for a guarantee that Israel would
not interfere with the $1 billion pipeline
to be built in Iraq, its enemy of four
decades.
Proposals for such payments were
cited in a memo to Meese from his
longtime friend E. Robert Wallach, a
private attorney involved in the project.
But it appears that no payments were
actually made, and it is not known who
else had knowledge of the plan.
Peres said he supported the pipeline
for economic and national security
reasons. "I was told about the idea of
laying a pipeline from Iraq through Jor
dan up to Elat which will add, in my
judgment, more security to the whole
region and that Israel could have enjoyed
oil for a lesser price," he said.
"I wrote to Meese and I said that, if
this is the case, I would like to meet
Secretary Shultz, a man for whom I
have the highest regard, in order to
discuss it and talk it over. That was the
content of my letter," said Peres, who
had previously denied through spokes
men that he wrote to the attorney gen
eral on the matter.
