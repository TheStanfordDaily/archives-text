2 killed in West Bank protest
JERUSALEM — Two Palestinians were shot
to death and at least seven others were
wounded yesterday as residents of the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip stepped up their
anti-Israeli protests in connection with the
planned visit to the region this week by Sec
retary of State George Shultz.
Israel Radio reported that hundreds of police
reinforcements continued to stream into the
Jerusalem area to try and head off demon
strations among Arab residents of the city and
of the surrounding villages and refugee camps
during Shultz's visit.
The American official is tentatively sched
uled to arrive here Thursday to begin a visit
of at least five days to the region, during
which he hopes to achieve a breakthrough in
the search for Middle East peace. Shultz is
expected to make day trips to Syria, Jordan,
Egypt an d Saudi Arabia while maintaining a
peace shuttle headquarters here in Jerusalem.
Shultz's initiative is in response to rioting
that has rocked the occupied territories since
early December, leaving at least 59 Pales
tinians dead, hundreds wounded by gunfire,
and hundreds of others imprisoned or hospi
talized with injuries from army beatings.
Waite recovers from injuries
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Anglican Church en
voy Terry Waite has recovered from serious
injuries sustained during his detention in in
Beirut's southern suburbs, a senior security
official at a leftist militia said yesterday.
Waite, according to the official, suffered from
wounds his kidnappers inflicted when they
mistook his pacemaker for a secret transmit
ter.
He added that Waite's captors had "allowed
a doctor to visit him and provide him with
the necessary medical care."
The official, who requested anonymity, said
that contacts were under way between Waite's
abductors and his former protectors, the Druse
Progressive Socialist Party.
The official said that Waite was being held
in "a six-story building in Haret Hraik," a
suburb of southern Beirut.
Deficits may force new talks
WASHINGTON — Even though they want
to avoid making politically painful budget cuts
just before the November election, Congres
sional and White House fiscal experts said
yesterday that they might have to reopen last
year's budget agreement and consider new
cutbacks if the deficit grows larger than ex
pected.
"We might have to face up to doing some
further deficit reductions . .. and obviously
you can't do it without the president's sup
port," warned Rep. William Gray III, D-Pa.,
chairman of the House Budget Committee.
White House budget chief James Miller III
tried to offer a rosier picture, noting that
current economic forecasts suggested that the
nation would meet the target of a $146 billion
deficit set by negotiators last year and that
further budget cuts might not be necessary
this year.
