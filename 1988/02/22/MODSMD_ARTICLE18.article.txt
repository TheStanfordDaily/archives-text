IN THEIR ATTEMPT to
strengthen the Stanford-in-
Florence Program, Overseas
Studies and the Italian Department
erred when they neglected to inform
the entire freshman class of its oppor
tunity to continue the Western Cul
ture learning experience in Florence
during fall quarter of next year.
The administrators had a good idea
when they thought of linking the study
of Western Culture at Stanford with
study in Florence. They were also cor
rect in assuming that students would
want to know whether they had been
accepted into the Florence program
before committing 10 units of their
spring quarter schedule to an intensive
Italian language course designed to
prepare them for that program.
It was this assumption that led to
the establishment of an early deadline
for students who wanted to take ad
vantage of the program. No special
preference would be given to the early
applicants, Overseas Studies said, but
they would find out whether they had
been admitted before the beginning of
spring quarter.
But by announcing the early dead
line only to students in the Structured
Liberal Education track of Western
Culture, Italian Literature Prof. John
Freccero and the other organizers of
the program effectively limited this
opportunity to a pool of about 70 stu
dents, since without a special an
nouncement, few students are likely
to plan to study abroad their sopho
more year. In attempting to ensure
high-caliber student participation, the
organizers may have decreased the
chances of the program proceeding as
planned.

Limiting the applicant pool has
made it unlikely that the intensive
Italian course will take place, since at
least 10 people must register for the
course for it to be taught. The appli
cation deadline has passed, and fewer
than five people have submitted ap
plications and expressed interest in the
Italian course. If the course is not
offered, freshmen who wish to go to
Florence will have to take intensive
Italian during summer quarter.
In addition, Freccero's characteriza
tion of SLE students as "the most
distinct group of people who have
taken the Western Civilization canon
seriously" is inaccurate and disturbing
to freshmen in all of the Western Cul
ture tracks.
Students in the other tracks may
resent being classified as less dedicated
or serious, especially when it results
in their being denied a valuable edu
cational opportunity.
Additionally, students in the SLE
program have long been stereotyped
as members of an elite group isolated
from the rest of the freshman class.
Statements like Freccero's and actions
like limiting publicity of the Florence
deadline only perpetuate these
stereotypes.
Overseas Studies and the Italian De
partment have established an unfor
tunate precedent in treating students
in one Western Culture track as in
herently superior to others. One of
the ideas embodied in the Western
Culture program is that it should pro
vide a common educational experience
for all recipients of a Stanford educa
tion. It is counterproductive for all
concerned to give preferential treat
ment to students in one track.
