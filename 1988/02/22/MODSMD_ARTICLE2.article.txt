# Boycott education postponed
## Pro-boycott papers distributed; growers' material omitted

A mix-up in the mails last week has
forced organizers of the campuswide
Grape Boycott Educational Program to
postpone the project, as flyers from the
United Farm Workers supporting the

Program events, including a campus
wide forum, residence-based films and
discussions and in-house votes on the
issue, will be delayed until spring quar

effort by the Office of Student Affairs
and MECIiA, a Chicano/Latino student
group, to inform students about the
United Farm Workers grape boycott and
about pesticide use in the grape indus
try.
After receiving the educational infor
mation, each residence will vote
whether to support the boycott. Uni
versity Food Service has agreed to follow
the decision made by each living group
whether grapes will be available in that
residence.
The information defending the grape
growers arrived at the Student Affairs
Office one day too late to be distributed

simultaneously with the pro-boycott
leaflets, according to Jackson.
Jackson would not speculate why the
materials were late arriving to Stanford,
but he said he did not fault the grape
growers.
Roy Hickock, staff representative for
the Grape Workers and Farmers Coa
lition, said Friday they sent the flyers
two weeks ago.
Jackson admitted that presenting the
information from only one side of the
issue "was poor planning on our part."
Jackson explained that his office decided
to release the pro-boycott flyers on time
with the intention of distributing the
