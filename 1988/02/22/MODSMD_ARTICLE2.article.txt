# Boycott education postponed
## Pro-boycott papers distributed; growers' material omitted 
### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
A mix-up in the mails last week has
forced organizers of the campuswide
Grape Boycott Educational Program to
postpone the project, as flyers from the
United Farm Workers supporting the
boycott were passed out on schedule in
student residences Wednesday, but ac
companying flyers explaining the anti
boycott position of grape farmers ar
rived too late for distribution.
Program events, including a campus
wide forum, residence-based films and
discussions and in-house votes on the
issue, will be delayed until spring quar
ter, according to Assoc. Dean of Campus

Affairs Michael Jackson.
The educational program is a joint
effort by the Office of Student Affairs
and MECIiA, a Chicano/Latino student
group, to inform students about the
United Farm Workers grape boycott and
about pesticide use in the grape indus
try.
After receiving the educational infor
mation, each residence will vote
whether to support the boycott. Uni
versity Food Service has agreed to follow
the decision made by each living group
whether grapes will be available in that
residence.
The information defending the grape
growers arrived at the Student Affairs
Office one day too late to be distributed

simultaneously with the pro-boycott
leaflets, according to Jackson.
Jackson would not speculate why the
materials were late arriving to Stanford,
but he said he did not fault the grape
growers.
Roy Hickock, staff representative for
the Grape Workers and Farmers Coa
lition, said Friday they sent the flyers
two weeks ago.
Jackson admitted that presenting the
information from only one side of the
issue "was poor planning on our part."
Jackson explained that his office decided
to release the pro-boycott flyers on time
with the intention of distributing the
other viewpoint as soon as it was
available. "We got ahead of our
selves in a dumb fashion," he said.
"We had planned to release it
all at the same time," Jackson
said, adding that program organ
izers are "not trying to push one
side or the other." Jackson ex
plained that the grape growers'
flyers will be distributed in the
residences some time this week.
MEChA member Julie Mar
tinez, a junior, expressed concern
that the campus community may
have a "misunderstanding why
only one side was presented"in
last Wednesday's flyers. "I heard
some people saying we wanted to
bias the debate with our own
view," she said, calling such a mis
conception "totally untrue."
"The people of MEChA were
disappointed that the grape
growers' information hadn't come
earlier," she added. Martinez
stressed that MEChA wants to
have both sides presented to im
prove the decision-making process
in each residence. The release of
only one viewpoint "wasn't con
tributing to the intellectual dis
cussion we wanted to happen,"
she said.
