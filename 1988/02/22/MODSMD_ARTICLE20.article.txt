## Resident assistant job not all it's cracked up to be 
### 
IN MAY, I was accepted to be a
resident assistant — a sinecure
bestowed upon an elite few here at
the Farm. To say I was "psyched" is
an understatement. I decided in May
that I would prefer the cozy, though
loud, abode of Donner House to the
raunchy streets of Paris. The choice
was tough at some superficial level,
but there was really no competition. I
wanted to help people — to be there
when they needed me, to be used and
relied upon.
Driving my decision to remain here
was the idealistic belief that I could
make a difference. As a black man who
is also a feminist, I felt I could open
some eyes, broaden minds and attack
some "isms." What more could Res Ed
ask for?

Well, prospective black male feminist
RA applicants (I'm also a communist)
beware. On one hand, some young,
virgin freshmen minds were thirsting
to examine new ideas, re-evaluate old
ones and argue about them all.
But others were ready to demand
justification for the offense I felt from
some statements, actions or advertise
ments that I found racist or sexist.
They demanded to know why I was
hurt, why I felt disempowered and
why I feared for my tenuous position
in American society. What the hell was
my problem?? Obviously, I was hyper
sensitive and I was trying to cram
liberal, moralistic ideology down their
throats.
So, the debates went on. How do
you explain to a white male who has

never looked racism or sexism in the
face — not to mention in every other
body part — that his refusal to ac
knowledge your feelings as valid could
be the end of reform? That as a group
they have enough power in America to
do almost anything, including ignore
the feelings of those of us on the
fringes?
Moreover, how do you explain to a
woman who sees a statement or an
action as nothing more than good,
clean fun that it is actually exploita
tion and that it is dangerous?
The fight becomes more tiring each
day as the battlements of the defensive
become more and more enforced.
Repulsed in my quest to broaden
minds, and attack "isms" by peoples'

determination not to be told anything
that conflicts with what they believe, I
am left exhausted.
To be fair, this is the greatest job
I've ever had. It is usually rewarding,
intensely satisfying and a lot of fun.
But it is also the most frustrating job
I've ever had. Particularly because the
same "liberalism" that leads me to be
vocal about things I see as sexist or
racist, also tells me that it is "self
righteous" to say that I have cornered
the market on "social consciousness,"
despite the fact that each time I feel
they have sided with racism or sexism,
something in me gets spiritually ill and
dies temporarily.
