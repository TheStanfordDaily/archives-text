# SLE students want equal consideration

### 
As students in the Structured
Liberal Education program, we would
like to dismiss several misconceptions.
Comments in the Feb. 8 article regard
ing the early application deadline for
the Florence program reflected un
founded elitist attitudes.
SLE Prof. John Freccero's statement
that SLE students represent "the most
distinct group of people who have
taken the Western civilization canon
seriously" does not reflect our senti
ments.
Furthermore, there is no validity to
Janet Schmidt's assessment that SLE
students "will get more out of [Floren
ce]." SLE is only one of eight unique
approaches to Western Culture, each of
which represents an equally "serious"
study of the subject matter.
Our commitment should not be
distinguished as superior. We do not

deserve special attention and are of
fended by this favoritism.
Concentrating recruitment efforts on
a small segment of the freshman class
is counterproductive. By excluding the
other seven tracks from the early
application deadline, the Florence
program misses many potential partici
pants who would greatly contribute to
the program.
Thanks but no thanks Florence, we'd
rather be treated like everyone else.
