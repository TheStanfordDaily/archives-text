# Preserve cultures

As it stands, Stanford University
actively brings a diverse student body
together to learn, without teaching
them in such a way that they may
develop in their education a sincere
respect for one another and them
selves. People, regardless of ethnic or

national origin, gender or sexual pref
erence, need to be shown unequivocally
that that which is different is not
necessarily wrong.
The United States today has progres
sively become a microcosm of the
world population. It is not the "mel
ting pot" that it has long been pur
ported to be — a homogenous stew,
overcooked by heated xenophobia and
assimilation pressures.
Due to the surviving ideological
remnants of the civil rights movement,
many of this country's immigrants and
emigres — of first- and American-born
generations — are abandoning the
sense that their different racial and
cultural heritage is something to be
ashamed of.
Thus, a more appropriate metaphor
for our society would be that of a
tossed salad, which though marinated
throughout in the dressing of Western
culture(s), possesses a cornucopia of
ingredient cultures which retain their
own distinct flavors.
Situated in the intensely multicul-

tural San Francisco Bay Area, it seems
unthinkable to deny that an institution
which claims to be training future
world leaders would neglect to teach
these pre-eminents of the diversity
that is the world. It has in this time
become increasingly obvious that com
merce, technology, jurisprudence,
politics and many other disciplines in
the United States at once influence
and rely upon the international com
munity. How can we expect these
women and men as leaders to change
for the better a world which they do
not deeply understand or respect?
