THE INVITATION READ: "You are
cordially invited in 1987 to the U.S.
Constitution's 200 th Birthday
Party. Please join in the parades,
speeches and essay contests. Dress: Red,
White and Blue."
While most of us responded positively
to this invitation, one Supreme Court
justice chose not to attend the celebra
tion. Thurgood Marshall, the only black
justice ever to have sat on the court, did
not feel like rejoicing over the memory
of the Founding Fathers and the docu
ment they drafted in Philadelphia.
Instead, he elected to reflect over the
"suffering, struggle and sacrifice that has
triumphed over much of what was wrong
with the original document."
To Justice Marshall, the founders did
not exhibit a profound sense of wisdom,
justice or foresight in crafting the Con
stitution. On the contrary, they devised
a defective government that required a
Bill of Rights, a civil war and a momen
tous social transformation "to attain the
system of constitutional government, and
its respect for individual freedoms and
human rights, that we hold as funda
mental today."
Like the U.S. Constitution, Stanford
University has begun sending out its
birthday invitations to celebrate the an
niversary of its founding. Fireworks, fa
mous speakers, big bands, rock bands
and black tie affairs mark the Centennial
festivities that began last May with the
Cornerstone Centennial and will last
through October, 1991 with the Univer
sity's Opening Centennial. Organizers
have planned National Centennial
Celebrations in 11 major U.S. cities over
the next two years while the Stanford

Centennial Campaign aims to raise $1.1
billion.
Standing under this upcoming shower
of Centennial praise and flattery, the
Stanford community is likely to get
drenched in the self-congratulation and
back-slapping inherent in such an occa
sion. While Stanford has much to cele
brate, Justice Marshall's approach must
be heeded. What gives cause for celebra
tion is Stanford's evolution over the last
100 years and its potential for growth
over the next 100 years, rather than the
actual founding itself.
Stanford of 1891 should not be con
fused with Stanford of 1991. Although
Leland Stanford sought to establish a
university where "all may have a chance
to secure an education," Stanford's "all"
was manifestly limited to members of
the white race. The "NOT WELCOME"
mat was laid out on Palm Drive for Asians
(the "inferior race," according to Sen.
Stanford) and all minorities.
Stanford University's discrimination
has only slowly eroded in the decades
since its founding. As late as 1960, only
six blacks had applied for the freshman
class — three were admitted and two
enrolled. And by 1968, black enrollment
had crept up to 2.9 percent, but Hispanics
and Native Americans represented a com
bined total of only one percent of the
University's undergraduates.
Today Stanford can claim that it has
assembled a more diverse student body
— minorities constitute about 28 percent
of the University's undergraduate popu
lation. Assembling diversity, however, is
only the first step. The University must
properly service its diverse population,
and the Stanford students themselves

must become more intellectually and so
cially diverse.
To promote this new phase of diversity,
the University should:
• Increase minority faculty recruitment
and hiring beyond the 7.3 percent that
exists today.
• Create ethnic studies departments for
Afro-Americans, Chicanos, Asian-
Americans and Native Americans.
• Strengthen the non-Western Culture
requirement by making it an Area Nine
requirement.
• Institute a Community Service require
ment so that Stanford undergrads be
come more integrated with the local com
munity and broaden their educational ex
periences.
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's first
president, stated in his 1891 opening cer
emony address that "ours is the youngest
of the universities, but it is heir to the
wisdom of all the ages." As Stanford Uni
versity approaches its 100 th birthday, it
is no longer an institutional infant. We
should not, then, celebrate Stanford's
narrow-minded infancy, but rather its
growth into adolescent diversity.
Our invitations should read: "You are
cordially invited to celebrate Stanford's
Next 100 Years. Dress: Cardinal."

human rights, that we hold as funda
mental today."
Like the U.S. Constitution, Stanford
University has begun sending out its
birthday invitations to celebrate the an
niversary of its founding. Fireworks, fa
mous speakers, big bands, rock bands
and black tie affairs mark the Centennial
festivities that began last May with the
Cornerstone Centennial and will last
through October, 1991 with the Univer
sity's Opening Centennial. Organizers
have planned National Centennial
Celebrations in 11 major U.S. cities over
the next two years while the Stanford

Centennial Campaign aims to raise $1.1
billion.
Standing under this upcoming shower
of Centennial praise and flattery, the
Stanford community is likely to get
drenched in the self-congratulation and
back-slapping inherent in such an occa
sion. While Stanford has much to cele
brate, Justice Marshall's approach must
be heeded. What gives cause for celebra
tion is Stanford's evolution over the last
100 years and its potential for growth
over the next 100 years, rather than the
actual founding itself.
Stanford of 1891 should not be con
fused with Stanford of 1991. Although
Leland Stanford sought to establish a
university where "all may have a chance
to secure an education," Stanford's "all"
was manifestly limited to members of
the white race. The "NOT WELCOME"
mat was laid out on Palm Drive for Asians
(the "inferior race," according to Sen.
Stanford) and all minorities.
Stanford University's discrimination
has only slowly eroded in the decades
since its founding. As late as 1960, only
six blacks had applied for the freshman
class — three were admitted and two
enrolled. And by 1968, black enrollment
had crept up to 2.9 percent, but Hispanics
and Native Americans represented a com
bined total of only one percent of the
University's undergraduates.
Today Stanford can claim that it has
assembled a more diverse student body
— minorities constitute about 28 percent
of the University's undergraduate popu
lation. Assembling diversity, however, is
only the first step. The University must
properly service its diverse population,
and the Stanford students themselves

must become more intellectually and so
cially diverse.
To promote this new phase of diversity,
the University should:
• Increase minority faculty recruitment
and hiring beyond the 7.3 percent that
exists today.
• Create ethnic studies departments for
Afro-Americans, Chicanos, Asian-
Americans and Native Americans.
• Strengthen the non-Western Culture
requirement by making it an Area Nine
requirement.
• Institute a Community Service require
ment so that Stanford undergrads be
come more integrated with the local com
munity and broaden their educational ex
periences.
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's first
president, stated in his 1891 opening cer
emony address that "ours is the youngest
of the universities, but it is heir to the
wisdom of all the ages." As Stanford Uni
versity approaches its 100 th birthday, it
is no longer an institutional infant. We
should not, then, celebrate Stanford's
narrow-minded infancy, but rather its
growth into adolescent diversity.
Our invitations should read: "You are
cordially invited to celebrate Stanford's
Next 100 Years. Dress: Cardinal."
