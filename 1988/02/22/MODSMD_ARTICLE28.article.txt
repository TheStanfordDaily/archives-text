## Cagers clobber Cal 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery
was more subdued in victory than
Wright. "Basically to be down only six
points at half after the mess we made
was encouraging," Montgomery said.
"This was a big win that kind of made
up for last week."
At first, however, the hoop seemed
two sizes too small for Stanford, as the
Cardinal players missed their first 10
shots. Nothing was going right for Stan
ford — six minutes into the game ref
eree Bob Garibaldi called a technical
foul on Montgomery for the second con
secutive game.
Montgomery may have been
frustrated by the poor offensive execu
tion of his players up to that point.
"We got out of sorts early in the game
and tried to improvise and it got us in
trouble," Montgomery said.
Stanford finally got on track when
Butler finally got the ball. The senior,
playing in his rivalry finale, scored six
straight to keep the Cardinal within
nine points and get the offense clicking.
"I knew I was playing really hesitant
until then, so the first three or four
times I caught it I decided I was going
to put it up," Butler said. "In the first
half I did it and in the second half,
Todd did it."
Lichti certainly did. After Stanford
cut the Cal lead to 37-31 at halftime,
Lichti came out blazing. The 6-foot-4
junior drained two three-pointers, the
first a swish and the second a rattler
from the corner, and the score was soon
tied at 39-39.
"Those two three-point field goals
were important," Montgomery said.
"Cal was playing with an awful lot of
emotion, and once they burned that off
and we got to play ball, then we were
OK."
Stanford wasn't quite A-OK until
about eight minutes after Lichti's
hoops. With the score tied 51-51 and
11:28 left in the game, Meinert began
to make things happen.

BERKELEY - The
Stanford men's basket
ball team threw in the
towel yesterday — the
towel into which the Car
dinal players might have
in past years buried their

heads in despair as the California
Golden Bears rolled to another rout in
Harmon Gym.
In fact, the temptations to fold were
many in the opening minutes of yes
terday's game. Stanford fell behind 11-1
and 29-15 in the first half, could not
execute its half-court offense and didn't
get a field goal until almost eight
minutes had elapsed.
Meanwhile, the Berkeley crowd was
roaring and the Bear guards were on
fire. In short, soon doom awaited the
Cardinal.
So what happened? Stanford bit the
bullet instead of the towel and won
convincingly, 71-61.
Three separate charges led by Cardi
nal players Greg Butler, Todd Lichti
and Scott Meinert propelled Stanford
to the victory and its first season sweep
of California since the 1978-79 season.
Stanford improved to 16-8 overall, 9-5
in the Pacific 10 Conference and thus
remains in a second place tie with
Oregon State and a game ahead,, of
Oregon and UCLA.
The Cardinal come-from-behind vic
tory was especially notable because of
the Bay Area rivalry and Stanford's dis
appointing overtime loss to Washington
last weekend.
"At one point it's 11-1, we're at Har
mon, no shots are going down and we're
getting no (referees') calls. Those are
the kind of things that lead to
blowouts," Stanford forward Howard
Wright said. "I'm proud that we didn't
fold like we've done before. Nothing can
be sweeter than to beat Cal at Cal."

Twice Meinert ran a misdirection play
where he drove left and then whirled
passes back against the grain to team
mates Derek Bruton and Wright.
Bruton laid his open shot in gently and
Wright slammed his with authority.
The Cardinal continued its crisp pass
ing when Wright found Lichti going
through the back door. Lichti first tried
to dunk the ball, but then settled for
putting it through the hoop in the same
manner someone places a crown on a
head.
Finally, Wright, Lichti and Meinert
combined on a fast break which cul
minated with a Wright dunk and Stan
ford led 59-51.
"The guys were open and I just had
to have enough confidence to throw
them the ball," Meinert said. "Geez, I
mean Howard and Bru couldn't have
gotten any more open than that. It
would have been hard to miss them."
Actually, Meinert's passes walked a
thinner line than he admits.
"Scott Meinert did an exceptional job
for us passing the ball in that one
stretch," Montgomery affirmed.
Montgomery's troops held on to the
eight-point lead until the 4:47 mark
when Cardinal forward Bryan
McSweeney pulled down an offensive
rebound, laid it in and was fouled. He
made the free throw and Stanford led
65-54.
Forty seconds later Wright skated
past three defenders and converted a
reverse layup to put Stanford ahead
67-54 and all but seal the victory.
"This is the first time in a long time
that I saw a Stanford team say, 'the
hell with it. We're a better team and
we're going to come back and win this
one,' " said Meinert, who finished the
game with eight points and four assists.
Lichti topped all scorers with 20
points, while Butler had 14 and Wright
had 13. For the Golden Bears, who
dropped to 8-15, 5-9, Keith Smith had
15 points and Matt Beeuwsaert had 14.

11:28 left in the game, Meinert began
to make things happen.

BERKELEY - The
Stanford men's basket
ball team threw in the
towel yesterday — the
towel into which the Car
dinal players might have
in past years buried their

heads in despair as the California
Golden Bears rolled to another rout in
Harmon Gym.
In fact, the temptations to fold were
many in the opening minutes of yes
terday's game. Stanford fell behind 11-1
and 29-15 in the first half, could not
execute its half-court offense and didn't
get a field goal until almost eight
minutes had elapsed.
Meanwhile, the Berkeley crowd was
roaring and the Bear guards were on
fire. In short, soon doom awaited the
Cardinal.
So what happened? Stanford bit the
bullet instead of the towel and won
convincingly, 71-61.
Three separate charges led by Cardi
nal players Greg Butler, Todd Lichti
and Scott Meinert propelled Stanford
to the victory and its first season sweep
of California since the 1978-79 season.
Stanford improved to 16-8 overall, 9-5
in the Pacific 10 Conference and thus
remains in a second place tie with
Oregon State and a game ahead,, of
Oregon and UCLA.
The Cardinal come-from-behind vic
tory was especially notable because of
the Bay Area rivalry and Stanford's dis
appointing overtime loss to Washington
last weekend.
"At one point it's 11-1, we're at Har
mon, no shots are going down and we're
getting no (referees') calls. Those are
the kind of things that lead to
blowouts," Stanford forward Howard
Wright said. "I'm proud that we didn't
fold like we've done before. Nothing can
be sweeter than to beat Cal at Cal."

Twice Meinert ran a misdirection play
where he drove left and then whirled
passes back against the grain to team
mates Derek Bruton and Wright.
Bruton laid his open shot in gently and
Wright slammed his with authority.
The Cardinal continued its crisp pass
ing when Wright found Lichti going
through the back door. Lichti first tried
to dunk the ball, but then settled for
putting it through the hoop in the same
manner someone places a crown on a
head.
Finally, Wright, Lichti and Meinert
combined on a fast break which cul
minated with a Wright dunk and Stan
ford led 59-51.
"The guys were open and I just had
to have enough confidence to throw
them the ball," Meinert said. "Geez, I
mean Howard and Bru couldn't have
gotten any more open than that. It
would have been hard to miss them."
Actually, Meinert's passes walked a
thinner line than he admits.
"Scott Meinert did an exceptional job
for us passing the ball in that one
stretch," Montgomery affirmed.
Montgomery's troops held on to the
eight-point lead until the 4:47 mark
when Cardinal forward Bryan
McSweeney pulled down an offensive
rebound, laid it in and was fouled. He
made the free throw and Stanford led
65-54.
Forty seconds later Wright skated
past three defenders and converted a
reverse layup to put Stanford ahead
67-54 and all but seal the victory.
"This is the first time in a long time
that I saw a Stanford team say, 'the
hell with it. We're a better team and
we're going to come back and win this
one,' " said Meinert, who finished the
game with eight points and four assists.
Lichti topped all scorers with 20
points, while Butler had 14 and Wright
had 13. For the Golden Bears, who
dropped to 8-15, 5-9, Keith Smith had
15 points and Matt Beeuwsaert had 14.

Junior guard Todd Lichti came alive in the second half in yesterday's 71-61 win at
California. Lichti had 20 points as the Cardinal completed its first season sweep of
the Bears in nine years.
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery
was more subdued in victory than
Wright. "Basically to be down only six
points at half after the mess we made
was encouraging," Montgomery said.
"This was a big win that kind of made
up for last week."
At first, however, the hoop seemed
two sizes too small for Stanford, as the
Cardinal players missed their first 10
shots. Nothing was going right for Stan
ford — six minutes into the game ref
eree Bob Garibaldi called a technical
foul on Montgomery for the second con
secutive game.
Montgomery may have been
frustrated by the poor offensive execu
tion of his players up to that point.
"We got out of sorts early in the game
and tried to improvise and it got us in
trouble," Montgomery said.
Stanford finally got on track when
Butler finally got the ball. The senior,
playing in his rivalry finale, scored six
straight to keep the Cardinal within
nine points and get the offense clicking.
"I knew I was playing really hesitant
until then, so the first three or four
times I caught it I decided I was going
to put it up," Butler said. "In the first
half I did it and in the second half,
Todd did it."
Lichti certainly did. After Stanford
cut the Cal lead to 37-31 at halftime,
Lichti came out blazing. The 6-foot-4
junior drained two three-pointers, the
first a swish and the second a rattler
from the corner, and the score was soon
tied at 39-39.
"Those two three-point field goals
were important," Montgomery said.
"Cal was playing with an awful lot of
emotion, and once they burned that off
and we got to play ball, then we were
OK."
Stanford wasn't quite A-OK until
about eight minutes after Lichti's
hoops. With the score tied 51-51 and
11:28 left in the game, Meinert began
to make things happen.
