# Baseball sweeps Gauchos
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
After being stymied by
highly touted Stanford
starters Lee Plemel on
Friday and Mike Mus
sina on Saturday, the
UC-Santa Barbara
Gauchos had to be ex-

pecting a break yesterday against un
heralded Cardinal freshman Stan Spen
cer.
Stan was the man, throwing a
complete-game six-hitter as the Cardi
nal romped 13-2 to complete a three
game sweep of the visitors.
Stanford also won 15-4 Friday and
9-8 Saturday. The sweep improves the
Cardinal's season record to 10-5 and
extends its winning streak to five games.
Stanford hosts Cal State-Los Angeles
at 2 p.m. today at Sunken Diamond,
then opens Pacific 10 Southern Division
action Friday at USC.
The weekend's wins put the team in
a good position for the opening of con
ference play. "It's a good feeling that
everything's starting to gel together,"
sophomore rightfielder Paul Carey said.
"Pitching, hitting, defense — it's all
coming together. . . . We're not going to
win the Pac-10 or the national cham
pionship playing the way we are, but
it's a step in the right direction."
"I'm very pleased," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "We're playing
with a lot more confidence, and that
will relax us a bit."
There was nothing particularly sur
prising about the excellent perform
ances by starters Plemel, Mussina and
Spencer — they've been doing well all
season. The real revelation of the
weekend was that the Cardinal finally
had its power-hitting offense running

on all cylinders.
The Stanford batters cranked out 14
hits yesterday, 16 Saturday and 14 Fri
day. "We're really hitting the ball well,"
Carey said. "It feels good to be up by
five or six runs instead of being up by
one or two and having to scratch for a
run."
Meanwhile, Spencer was shutting
down the Gauchos, giving up only four
hits and no runs over the last seven
innings.
"I felt I like I had good pop on my
fastball, and my cut fastball (a fastball
thrown with an off-center grip that
gives it movement similar to a slider)
had good action," Spencer said. "I felt
in control.... I never felt like it was
time to panic."
The Gauchos did threaten a few
times, particularly in the seventh. With
men on first and third and two outs,
designated hitter Ed Landphere, who
had two home runs on Saturday, came
to bat. He got around on a Spencer
fastball and launched a drive to deep
centerfield.
Stanford centerfielder Eric DeGraw,
playing somewhat shallow, broke at the
sound of the bat, turned his back fully
to the plate and took off. He looked
back at the last possible moment,
reached out to his right and gloved the
ball about two steps short of the warn
ing track in front of the 400 sign.
It was an amazing catch, and snuffed
the last of UCSB's hopes.
"I just turned my back and went —
just tried to beat the ball to the spot,"
DeGraw said.
Spencer gave up six hits, one earned
run and three walks and struck out five
to improve his record to 3-1 on the year.
It looked Saturday as though Mussina
would get his third win of the year,
too. He was in control the whole game

and took a commanding 8-3 lead, cour
tesy of two home runs by catcher Doug
Robbins, into the ninth inning.
After surrendering a lead-off single
to Tim Edmonds, Mussina gave way to
bullpen ace Steve Chitren. Presumably,
Chitren would mop up and Mussina
would notch a well-earned third win.
Well, maybe not. Chitren walked
Kenny Genilla, got an out, then walked
Steve Pratt to load the bases with one
out. Landphere, who had hit a home
run off Mussina in the second, delivered
a grand-slam wake-up call over the left
field fence to make the score 8-7. The
remaining spectators settled back into
their seat cushions.
After another walk, a stolen base and
a single, the game was tied 8-8. Chitren
issued another walk, and was replaced
by sophomore Mark Carper. Carper
threw four straight balls to Edmonds
to load the bases.
Sophomore Robbie Kamerschen
replaced Carper. By this time, Ginella
was up again. Kamerschen, making only
his second appearance of the season,
went to 3-1 on Ginella, grooved a strike,
then induced Ginella to ground out to
shortstop Troy Paulsen to end the in
ning.
In the bottom of the ninth, DeGraw
led off with a walk and went to second
on a sacrifice bunt by Eric Cox. Frank
Carey, up next, drilled a line drive right
at Gaucho second baseman Rex
Tagliaferri. Trying to double DeGraw
off second, Tagliaferri threw the ball to
the HCSB bullpen, and DeGraw scam
pered to third.
Paulsen, the next batter, worked the
count to 2-2, then stroked a single into
right field to bring DeGraw in with the
winning run.
Kamerschen picked up the win to go
2-0 on the year.
