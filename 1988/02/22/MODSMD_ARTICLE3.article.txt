# Emissions information defended by officials
## 
### Todd Pierce Senior staff writer 
The director of Stanford's controversial
Environmental Safety Facility and officials
from the Bay Area Air Quality Manage
ment District last week refuted claims
made by a local neighborhood association
that the University is hiding data about
emissions from the ESF incinerator.
But a Palo Alto neighborhood group, the
Barron Park Association, insists that data
on the facility's performance has been kept,
secret by the California State Resource
Board, a state agency that conducted tests
on the incinerator last August. John Joynt,
president of the group, said he is not calmed
by reassurances from Stanford and the
management district that emissions from
the incinerator are at a safe level.
"I think Stanford is doing a poor job —
an 'F'job — in terms of keeping community
fears at a low level," Joynt said Thursday.
The incinerator burns hospital and lab
oratory waste from the Medical Center and
research labs. Earlier this year Stanford
applied for and received a variance from
the management district to temporarily op
erate without a scrubber that filters the
fumes of burned waste. The scrubber was
replaced two weeks ago, before the variance
expired on Feb. 12.
Joynt said he is dissatisfied with Stan
ford's removal and subsequent reinstate
ment of the scrubber without releasing any

data on emissions, and he is seeking the
information under the Freedom of Infor
mation Act. But management district offi
cials have said that the organization "would
be glad to talk to the public" about the
incinerator.
The California Air Resource Board is the
only group known to have gathered data
at the incinerator. Bill Sessa, a press rep
resentative for the board, said the inspec
tion was one of several in California and
"was only for research."
"It wasn't intended to measure all levels
of all pollutants," he added.
Director of Health and Safety Alain
Decleve and management district officials
expressed frustration over the air resoure
board's refusal to release its findings except
in a preliminary and confidential form.
Earlier management district statements
have said the district is "upset" that the
air resource board does not release the
data. The district has received a "prelim
inary, very incomplete" draft of the board's
findings.
Decleve said the University is concerned
with the safe burning of biological and
infectious waste. He pointed to the replace
ment of two outdated incinerators by the
more modern ESF aa evidence of Stanford's
good intentions on air quality. The man
agement district corroborated Decleve's
claim, saying that with reference to safety,
Stanford's facility is in the top 10 percent
in the state.
