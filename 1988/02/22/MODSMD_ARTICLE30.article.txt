# Tennis passes southern test
## 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
After breezing
through its first
five matches this
season, the top
ranked Stanford
women's tennis
team suddenly

found itself in the middle of a
hurricane Friday morning in
Berkeley.
But after fifth-ranked Miami
(Fla.) won four of the six first
sets in the singles competition
Friday, the Hurricanes died down,
and the Cardinal survived its first
challenge of the season to post a
7-2 victory.
Saturday marked the return of
the easy competition, as the Car
dinal trounced No. 19 Clemson
8-1 to finish the Winter Invita
tional at Berkeley with a 2-0
record. The two-time defending
NCAA champions are now 7-0 on
the season.
Playing without top singles per
former Eleni Rossides once again.

Stanford struggled at the top of
the lineup Friday. Miami's steady
southpaw Ronni Reis upended
Cardinal freshman Tami
Whitlinger 6-4, 6-4 in the No. 1
contest, and Miami's Jennifer
Young swept past freshman
Sandra Birch 6-1, 6-3 in the No.
3 singles.
The Cardinal had a couple
players of its own that were hot,
however. Sophomore Lisa Green
(No. 2) and senior Kay Tittle (No.
5) matched Miami's pair of
straight-set victories. Green
bounced Miami's Paula Iversen 6-
2, 6-0, and Tittle disposed of Rona
Daniels 6-3, 6-2.
The singles came down to a pair
of three-set contests, both of
which the Cardinal won to take
control of the match. Freshman
Teri Whitlinger (No. 4) and soph
omore Valerie Wilson (No. 6) both
lost the first set of their matches.
Whitlinger, who was not feeling
100 percent, gutted out a 5-7, 6-2,
6-3 victory over Jami Yonekura.
"Teri was OK once she got the
first set under her belt," Stanford

Coach Frank Brennan said. "That
first set was sort of a shakedown
set. She had to decide if she was
going to live or die. She decided
to live."
Wilson barely survived her
match with Erika Winston. After
dropping the first set, Wilson
edged Winston in a second-set tie
breaker and then took control in
the third set for a 3-6, 7-6, 6-3
victory.
The Cardinal needed just one
doubles win to clinch the match,
but the team made a clean sweep.
Saturday, Stanford swept the
singles against Clemson without
dropping a set in the process. The
easy victory came despite the fact
that the Cardinal was playing
without both Rossides and Tittle,
who was taking the LSAT exam.
The Cardinal returns to action
tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium against
the Gauchos of UC-Santa Bar
bara. Rossides, who has not
played in a dual match yet this
season, is unlikely to return to
morrow.
