increase in
quality across
the board in col
legiate men's
tennis this
season, neither

of the top two teams in the
nation even reached the final
of the National Indoor Team
Championships at Louisville
over the weekend.
The anticipated confronta
tion between Stanford and
Georgia, each tied for the No.
1 spot in the national rankings,
never materialized, as third
rated USC stunned the Cardi
nal 5-1 and No. 4 Louisiana
State upset the Bulldogs 6-2
Saturday in the tournament
semifinals.
The Trojans went on to
defeat LSU 5-3 yesterday to
win the title.

nessee in the quarterfinals and
the defeat to the Trojans, the
Cardinal fell to 6-1 on the
season.

Irvine 5-2 in the quarterfinals,

Stanford winner on the day
was freshman Martin Black
man at No. 3 singles, who
bested Byron Black 7-6, 6-2.

confrontation be
tween Stanford and

USC's Eric Amend continued
the surprising Trojan singles
