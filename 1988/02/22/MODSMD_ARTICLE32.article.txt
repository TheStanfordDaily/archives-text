# Gymnasts hit the big time
## 
### Karen Gryler Staff writer 
Victory — how
sweet it is, espe
cially when you
beat the team that
trounced you just
the week before.
The Stanford

women's gymnastics team can at
test to this after beating Cal
State-Fullerton in Friday's dual
meet 185.10-184.55.
The Cardinal also earned a 1-
2-3 seating in the individual all
around, with sophomore Jinny
Rhee and senior Alison McGann
tying for second with a score of
37.30 and sophomore Dina
Amoroso breaking all previous
records for Stanford's highest all
around with a 38.25.
"We've almost been there all
year," junior balance beam spe
cialist Laurence George said.
"Tonight, we finally came
through with this meet to prove
to ourselves we can beat a top
ranked team and score a 185,"
she said.
This season-high win against
Fullerton didn't come easily, how
ever. The Cardinal was pulling
from the beginning with top vault
scores from Amoroso and Rhee,
powerful 9.5 and 9.6 vaults,
respectively, to place Rhee in first
place on the apparatus.
On bars, McGann increased the
difficulty level of her return to
score her season goal of 9.55.
Amoroso also performed a great
set, with her score of 9.6 attesting
to the quality of her routine.
In addition, freshmen Christie
Volastro and Julie Dunhill got a
chance to bolster the team effort
with respectable 9.7 scores.

The Cardinal hit more beam
routines Friday night than in any
other meet this season, as five
out of six routines were unmarred
by falls. George came through in
the clutch to start the team off
with a solid 9.0 before Rhee did
an exceptional 9.35 routine with
a dazzling round-off lay-out tum
bling pass.
But Amoroso stole first place
with an incredible set and a new
Stanford record of 9.7.
Moving on to the last event, a
clean and exact Fullerton was still
one-tenth ahead, but the Cardinal
quickly made up the difference
with sophomore Susan Banta's
best routine of the year, earning
a 9.4. McGann, Rhee and
Amoroso delivered a 1-2-3 punch
with 9.25, 9.4 and 9.45 marks
respectively.
When it was all over, the Car
dinal had upset the Titans by two
tenths. More importantly, the
gymnasts had achieved a signifi
cant goal of breaking 185 as a
team; Stanford Coach Homer Sar
dina postulates it will take a 186
average to qualify for nationals.
"Now we know we can break
185 and we have no excuse not
to do it again," Rhee said.
The individual achievements of
McGann, Amoroso and Rhee were
also important, since breaking a
37 all-around score has been a
long-standing aspiration of the
three gymnasts and a first in
McGann's gymnastics career.
"I shocked myself with this
score," Amoroso said. "But I still
feel my performance could be bet
ter, which is encouraging."
"Dina broke into the big league
with style," Stanford Asst. Coach
Sam Shaw added.
