# Volleyball splits in So Cal

Nothing out of the ordinary
happened.
Stanford's up-and-coming
men's volleyball team, fresh off
a big win over San Diego State
Wednesday, finished its road
trip through Southern Califor-

nia with a victory over Loyola Marymount
Friday night, followed by a loss at the hands
of the mighty USC Trojans Saturday.
The Cardinal played a very consistent match
in defeating the Lions 15-5, 7-15, 15-5, 15-12,
and then competed well throughout before
falling to league leading USC in three straight
games, 16-14, 15-9, 15-3.
"We're getting better and better each time
we take the floor," Stanford Coach Fred Sturm
said. "I'm really pleased with the improvement
the guys are making."
Indeed, the No. 12 Cardinal, winner of six
of its last seven matches, has really come on
in a season that began with little promise.
Stanford is now in the middle of the Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association stand
ings with a 3-3 mark. The No. 2-ranked
Trojans upped their conference mark to 8-0.

Against Loyola, the Cardinal had another
big match at the net, using powerful kills and
timely blocks to defeat the outmanned Lions.
Stanford, led by sophomore Craig Forsyth's
22 kills, was able to keep the Loyola defense
on its heels the entire match. The Cardinal
hit at a tremendous .421 clip for the match.
"I was very happy with our play against
Loyola," Sturm said. "They are a better team
than their record indicates, and they were on
their home floor."
But Stanford, despite a brief letdown in the
second game, had little trouble with a Loyola
team that hasn't played its best volleyball
either time it has faced the Cardinal this
season. Not only did Stanford hit extremely
well, the team was also able to block very
effectively against the Lions, now 1-5 in league
play. The Cardinal recorded 21 blocks on the
match.
"I think our net play was really good,"
junior Dave Johnson said. "I know I had one
of my best matches of the season."
It was a different story against the Trojans,
however. Although USC's Mike Lauterman,
the team's usual starting setter, was unable
to play, freshman Dan Greenbaum came in
and did the job for the Trojans. Moreover,

juniors Tom Duke and Chris Martz were their
usual stellar selves at the net. USC hit at a
.431 percentage for the match.
"We had our chances in the first two
games," Sturm said, "but we did ourselves in
with our own mistakes."
Although sophomore Dan Hanan and fresh
man John Alstrom had big nights hitting, the
rest of the Cardinal team seemed to be in a
daze. USC, which leads the conference by
limiting its opponents to a .191 hitting per
centage, held the Stanford at bay as well. The
Cardinal was only able to muster a .185 mark
for the match.
"USC played well when they had to," Sturm
said. "They got on a roll in the third game
and just steamrolled us."
Despite the loss, the Cardinal had a lot of
bright spots against the Trojans. Freshman
Mike Lowe, who played the entire roadtrip in
place of injured freshman Jay Ogas, had an
other solid match against USC. According to
Sturm, Lowe played extremely well against
both the Aztecs and the Lions earlier in the
trip.
"Mike did a great job on the entire trip,"
Sturm said. "It's a pleasure to know I can
have faith in all the guys on any given night."
