# Track's long day produces big wins
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
The Stanford
track and field
team starred in
a remake of
"The Longest
Day"yesterday.
After a pre-

dawn wakeup to catch their
flight to Seattle, the team was
delayed by fog for several
hours. The indoor track meet,
the last of the year for those
not competing the NCAA in
door championships, started
late with the running events
beginning in the afternoon and
the field events dragged into
the evening hours.
The runners were able to
compete successfully against
three other scheduled teams
despite the late arrival. Carol
Gray won the women's mile
for the second straight year in
4:54.6, taking two seconds off
her time in this meet last year
as a freshman. She also won
the 3,000 meters, taking the
distance run for the second
time as well. Junior Kim
Stevens took third behind Gray
in the mile.
Senior Steve Schadler also
captured the men's 3,000 for
the Cardinal. Schadler was en
gaged in a duel until the closing
laps, winning in an impressive
time of 8:16.7. Freshman David
Strang also took his race with
a strong kick, picking up the
pace in the last 400 meters of
the 800 meter race until he

was all alone, finishing in
1:52.9.
Sophomore Peter Kolotouros
represented the Cardinal well
in the 55-meter sprint hurdles,
an indoor track hybrid of the
110- (men) or 100- (women)
meter hurdles. Kolotouros won
last year in a time of 7.71, and
took more than a tenth of a
second off his time to win again
this year. Among the women,
freshman Jennifer Jauquet
placed fourth.
Junior Andy Papathanassiou
took second in the shot put
with a throw of 53-IV4, with
sophomore teammate Brian
Boggess third. The results for
the long, triple and high jumps,
the pole vault and the women's
shot put were not available at
press time due to the meet
delay.
Freshmen Jamie Fallon and
Jim Cramton both nailed down
second-place finishes in the
running competition. Fallon
ran 2:16.5 in the women's 800
meters, while Cramton ran
50.6 in the men's 400. Fresh
man Walter Batson placed in
the 55-meter sprint, and soph
omore Bill Crowley placed third
in the mile.
The Cardinal team fared bet
ter than it has in the past few
years, according to Stanford
Asst. Coach Scott Chisam.
Times were slowed by the in
door track, but the chaotic na
ture of trip did not seem to
faze the team, which had a corp
of repeat winners surrounded
by new talent.
