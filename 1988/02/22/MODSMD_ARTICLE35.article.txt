# Card put on hold
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
A gymnast is
swinging around
the high bar in one
arm giants, pre
paring for a diffi
cult release move
where he will let

go of the bar, perform one-and
a-half somersaults with a full
twist and recatch the bar. Just
as he releases from over 10 feet
off the floor, the lights in the
arena go out and he is left to
perform his feat in total darkness.
Sound like a scene from the
most horrifying slasher film you
can imagine? Probably not, but
it's not a scene from the "Sound
of Music" either. With a little bit
of bad luck, it coflld have occurred
last night at Arizona State during
the Southwest Cup. The Univer
sity Activity Center blacked out
after the meet's first event.
Although the gymnastics would
have been more exciting than
ever, the spectators would not
have exactly gotten the most for

their dollar, and the competition
was postponed for tonight, when
light is in the forecast. The five
team meet will lose top-ranked
UCLA, leaving No. 4 Stanford as
the top team. Besides impolite
host Arizona State, No. 7 Okla
homa and Michigan will also com
pete.
Stanford is 8-3, with five meets
remaining in its season until
April's NCAA Championships in
Lincoln, Neb. All three of its
losses came last weekend at the
seven-team UCLA Invitational
where it finished fourth, behind
the nation's current top three:
UCLA, Nebraska and Illinois.
The Cardinal hopes to eclipse
its season best, 278.55, by two
points tonight. Minor injuries to
three Stanford gymnasts are
being watched closely by Coach
Sadao Hamada who said he will
sacrifice team points now, rather
than risk aggravating the injuries
and hurting the team later in the
season. In the end, however, this
meet's outcome may be deter
mined by which squad has the
best night vision.

Chuck Gerardo and his fourth-ranked Cardinal teammates were left
in the dark at the Southwest Cup yesterday when the arena lighting
gave out. The meet has been rescheduled for today.
