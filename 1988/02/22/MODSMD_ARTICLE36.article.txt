SAN JOSE — This time of year Stanford
students start to notice something different
about their senior friends. They're wearing
things like suits, ties and even socks. Yes, it's
time again to fly all over the country for job
interviews.
Nancy Reno and Wendi Rush have it easy.
The two seniors, a big part of the Stanford
women's volleyball team's second place na
tional finish this season, already have jobs
lined up. They began their new jobs Saturday
night, taking the court for the San Jose

Golddiggers professional volleyball team and
once again, Reno plus Rush equals a win.
The two Stanford stars started the match
for the Golddiggers, and while the team got
off to a slow start in its first match of the
season, in the end it was too much of Reno,
Rush, Vicki Cantrell, Laurie Corbelli, Julie
Maginot and Eileen Dempster for the Arizona
Blaze to handle. The final score was 14-16,
9-15, 15-12, 15-11, 11-6.
San Jose returned almost its entire roster
from the team that took second place in the
inaugural season of League Volleyball
last year, losing onl> setter Teri Deßusk from
the starting six. But with San Jose State

All-America Lisa Ice not yet recovered from
knee surgery, new Golddigger Coach Dave
DeGroot needed to find two new starters.
He didn't need to look any farther than
Stanford.
Rush stepped in to fill the role of Deßusk
— who returned to San Jose as the Blaze's
starting setter — and Reno eased the loss of
Ice. In fact, with the addition of Reno in the
middle, DeGroot moved Dempster, a middle
blocker on the U.S. National Team in 1985,
to an outside hitter spot.
Rush led a deadly well-balanced attack and
Reno had a match-high .400 hitting percent
age and a team-leading 26 digs.
