# Minority studies to expand
## Committee proposes program to fill gap in curriculum 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Heralding an increased academic con
centration on ethnic issues, a new in
troductory survey course in ethnic
studies will be introduced in the 1989-90
academic year, according to a member
of the administrative committee for
American Studies, which will direct the
new program.
The new course is part of a larger
proposal to expand the study of ethnic
minorities at Stanford, said History
Prof. Jack Rakove, chair of the Amer
ican Studies administrative committee.
Ethnic studies is planned to serve as
an additional "subconcentration," or
emphasis in which to earn a degree in
American Studies, an existing interdis
ciplinary program.
The proposal was made by a year-old
ad-hoc committee charged with devel
oping an ethnic studies curriculum.

Committee Chair Albert Camarillo, pro
fessor of history, said the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies decided in
January 1987 to form the ad-hoc com
mittee to assess a perceived need for
additional courses in ethnic studies.
Camarillo said the group found very
few courses at Stanford that address
ethnic minority issues. The committee's
report found Native American and
Asian American studies to be particu
larly scarce, and the new program is
expected to help redress the problem
with additional courses in those areas
in the future.
The introductory course will be open
to all undergraduates and will be a gen
eral survey of American ethnic
minorities with an emphasis on racial
minorities, Camarillo said. A small com
mittee of faculty will meet next fall to
develop the specifics of the course, he
said.
In addition to the survey course, the
proposal also calls for other courses in

ethnic studies to be offered by i.he Amer
ican Studies program, as well as the
recruitment of new faculty and lectur
ers.
There are also plans to develop exist
ing ethnic studies programs, such as
the African and Afro-American Studies
program and the Chicano Fellows Pro
gram. Assoc. History Prof. Kennell
Jackson, chair of African and Afro-
American Studies, said that at present
his program has "reasonable funding,
but it is not adequate to the task of
Stanford's having a number one Afro-
American studies program."
Jackson said he expects the establish
ment of a new ethnic studies program
will help alleviate the funding problems
his own program faces.
However, Rakove said the implemen
tation of these other proposals "remains
to be seen." For now, the survey course
will be the first step toward the expan
sion of ethnic studies, he said.
