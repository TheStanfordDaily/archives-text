# Date rape
## awareness growing Efforts to address sexual harassment reflect national trend 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
When sex educator Dr. Ruth Wes
theimer argued to a Stanford audience
in November 1986 that "it is not fair
and is not right" for a woman to engage
in foreplay if she is not willing to go
beyond it, Assoc. Dean of Residential
Education Alice Supton, students and
staff objected strongly.
Controversy v/as also sparked by Wes
theimer's additional remark that stu
dents "not jump on the bandwagon" of
concern about date rape.
Since Westheimer's "Sex on the
Farm" speech, the University has ad
mitted that Stanford does have a prob
lem with date and gang rape. In a Feb.
3 interview with KZSU and The Daily,
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said that because there is a "hidden"
problem with rape on campus, Res Ed
needs to more actively educate students
about rape.
Currently the Rape Education Proj
ect, run through Stanford's Women's
Center, provides student-run programs
and discussions for fraternities,

sororities and dormitories. Res Ed en
courages resident assistants to hold one
Rape Education Project program in each
student house every year.
Some women at Stanford have
decided to take their fight to the public,
with a "Take Back the Night" march,
slated for March 3, that is intended to
show a combined spirit of protest
against sexual violence.
Campuses across the nation, includ
ing UC-Berkeley, UCLA and
Dartmouth, make similar efforts to con
front issues of sexual coercion, cultural
gender roles, sexual expectations, mixed
communication and peer pressure, while
campuses such as the University of
Pennsylvania make a minimal effort,
presenting only one program about rape
to incoming freshman.
Still others, such as Boston College,
leave the responsibility of rape educa
tion to health services or campus secu
rity; many do not have any formal rape
education at all.
The difficulty in confronting date and
gang rape lies in the fact that few cases
are actually reported. At Bentley College
in Massachusetts, however, officials are

investigating charges that five freshmen
gang-raped a freshman woman visiting
from Framingham State College.
The 18-year-old woman filed charges
of aggravated rape on Jan. 28, claiming
that the five men raped her after at
tending two parties in the dormitories
on the night of Jan. 23. At this point
in the college's efforts to discover
whether school policy was violated, of
ficials say they will take disciplinary
action against the men, but have
declined to elaborate on the actions to
be taken.
Ellen Hurley, a press representative
for the college, said the incident has
raised awareness about the issue of ac
quaintance rape, but at this point, there
are no plans to increase rape education
efforts. Currently, the college sponsors
a rape eduaction program similiar to
Stanford's, in which counselors can re
quest programs to be run in the dor
mitories.
Some campuses, however, have
planned awareness-raising events catch
ing the attention of students, media,
school officials, acquaintance rape
victims and aggressors.
For example, a month of activ
ities and education at Carleton
College in Minnesota began with
a mock-trial held Jan. 14.
A group of 40 students calling
itself SMASH (Student Movement
Against Sexual Harassment)
raised money to inform students
about the problem of sexual coer
cion, according to Laura Williams,
a Carleton senior.
Over 300 students from the
mid-western college attended the
four-hour mock trial, which was
intended to demonstrate the dif
ferent definitions, legal complica
tions and magnitudes of rape.
After selecting a jury of 12 from
the audience, students, along with
two practicing lawyers, a police
officer, a professor as a character
witness, a doctor providing an ex
pert's opinion and a judge from
Hennepin County, acted out the
case of State vs. Stevens, which
was based upon a script written
by Mankato State University and
modified to fit Carleton's circum
stances.
In three hours of unrehearsed
testimony, witnesses revealed the
events of the night. The defendant
claimed Lisa Stratler, a college
woman, was drunk and came on

to him, saying "I'll be at home
and waiting for you in bed."
Stratler claimed she was drunk
and didn't want to have sex with
him, but was forced to. She
claimed that she screamed, but
her neighbor testified that he
never heard the screams. Both the
police officer and the doctor stated
that the bruises on her arm,
evidence of pillow-smothering and
the general trauma that Stratler
exhibited the night in question
indicated she had been forced to
have sex without consent.
The jury was then sent to
deliberate, although both lawyers
were quick to point out that in
an actual court hearing, a case
such as this one would last at
least three full days. During the
time of deliberation, the doctor,
police officer, judge and lawyers
answered questions from the au
dience. The jury returned with a
vote of seven not guilty and five
guilty.
"What we perceive to be rape
is this ugly stranger jumping out
of the bushes and attacking you,"
said Williams, co-coordinator of
the mock trial. "But if it's some
one you know, what can you do
about it? The last thing you want
to do is alienate your friends by
making a big deal about it."
After the initial eye-opening
mock trial, SMASH organized
several events on issues of
sexuality and violence with a se
ries of events. "We didn't want

to leave people at the point of
confrontation with [date rape],"
Williams said. "People also need
other ways of reacting to it."
SMASH addressed the issues by
hosting speakers, showing films,
engaging in discussions and
leading self-defense workshops. In
addition, the group held a "victim
support" forum, ran a workshop
for men that addressed pornogra
phy, covered the campus with in
formational flyers and set up a
bulletin board for victims.
"[These programs were] not to
preach, but to raise awareness,"
Williams said."Raise the issue and
then you will get more people in
terested."
Yale University has just
finished a rape awareness week,
which took place Feb. 1-7.
Response, Yale's student-run
sexual assault counseling service
operating through the New Haven
Rape Crisis Center, planned a
week of activities including a
movie, support groups for rape
survivors and their friends, a
guest speaker and a three-hour
self-defense workshop for women.
Lisa Evanson, a member of the
group, said Yale students have
also organized telephone hotlines
for rape victims.
But at Brown University three
years ago, students and victims
reacted much more aggresively at
a demonstration. Over 300
women marched into the center
of a quad surrounded by frater

'What we perceive to
be rape is this ugly
stranger jumping out
of the bushes and at
tacking you. But if it's
someone you know,
what can you do
about it? The last
thing you want to do
is alienate your
friends by making a
big deal about it.'

nity houses. The group, an infor
mal coalition of black, white and
Asian women, protested for five
hours what thev said was con
stant verbal harassment from
several of the fraternities.
The coalition followed up the
demonstration with several de
mands to the university, including
the adoption of a policy stating
that Brown will not discriminate
on the basis of sexual orientation
and the adoption of a permanent
escort service, similar to one here
run by SURE.

Other demands were for verbal
and physical self-defense courses,
increased security officers — es
pecially female officers — review
of a report recommending that no
new single-sex fraternal organiza
tions be recognized at Brown and
the revocation of the charters of
two fraternities whose members
had been charged with sexual
crimes.
The fraternities reacted angrily,
according to Colette Matvzie, then
a freshman. For weeks after the
demonstration, she said, frater
nity members threw bottles and
yelled at women walking through
the quad.
Matvzie, now the coordinator
of resources on racial issues at
Brown's women's center, said,
however, that the speak-out was
rewarding and "extremely produc
tive" for the women involved.
The event was not only
therapeutic for rape victims, but
also stimulated general student
interest, Matvzie said. "I wouldn't
say that all of date rape ended,
but it was a good experience for
the women," she said. In addition,
the university responded posi
tively to many of the demands.
Currently, Brown students
have organized a "Green Light
Network" in Providence. Houses
with green lights in the windows
and stickers at the door are des
ignated "safe houses," for women
who feel harassed or threatened
when walking in the city streets.
