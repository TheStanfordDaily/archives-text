# Date rape
## awareness growing Efforts to address sexual harassment reflect national trend 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
When sex educator Dr. Ruth Wes
theimer argued to a Stanford audience
in November 1986 that "it is not fair
and is not right" for a woman to engage
in foreplay if she is not willing to go
beyond it, Assoc. Dean of Residential
Education Alice Supton, students and
staff objected strongly.
Controversy v/as also sparked by Wes
theimer's additional remark that stu
dents "not jump on the bandwagon" of
concern about date rape.
Since Westheimer's "Sex on the
Farm" speech, the University has ad
mitted that Stanford does have a prob
lem with date and gang rape. In a Feb.
3 interview with KZSU and The Daily,
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said that because there is a "hidden"
problem with rape on campus, Res Ed
needs to more actively educate students
about rape.
Currently the Rape Education Proj
ect, run through Stanford's Women's
Center, provides student-run programs
and discussions for fraternities,

sororities and dormitories. Res Ed en
courages resident assistants to hold one
Rape Education Project program in each
student house every year.
Some women at Stanford have
decided to take their fight to the public,
with a "Take Back the Night" march,
slated for March 3, that is intended to
show a combined spirit of protest
against sexual violence.
Campuses across the nation, includ
ing UC-Berkeley, UCLA and
Dartmouth, make similar efforts to con
front issues of sexual coercion, cultural
gender roles, sexual expectations, mixed
communication and peer pressure, while
campuses such as the University of
Pennsylvania make a minimal effort,
presenting only one program about rape
to incoming freshman.
Still others, such as Boston College,
leave the responsibility of rape educa
tion to health services or campus secu
rity; many do not have any formal rape
education at all.
The difficulty in confronting date and
gang rape lies in the fact that few cases
are actually reported. At Bentley College
in Massachusetts, however, officials are

investigating charges that five freshmen
gang-raped a freshman woman visiting
from Framingham State College.
The 18-year-old woman filed charges
of aggravated rape on Jan. 28, claiming
that the five men raped her after at
tending two parties in the dormitories
on the night of Jan. 23. At this point
in the college's efforts to discover
whether school policy was violated, of
ficials say they will take disciplinary
action against the men, but have
declined to elaborate on the actions to
be taken.
Ellen Hurley, a press representative
for the college, said the incident has
raised awareness about the issue of ac
quaintance rape, but at this point, there
are no plans to increase rape education
efforts. Currently, the college sponsors
a rape eduaction program similiar to
Stanford's, in which counselors can re
quest programs to be run in the dor
mitories.
Some campuses, however, have
planned awareness-raising events catch
ing the attention of students, media,
