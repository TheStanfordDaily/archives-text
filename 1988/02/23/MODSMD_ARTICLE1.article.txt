# RFs question Draw priority for returnees

Returning residence priority is unfair and should
be abolished, several resident fellows decided
Thursday at a meeting with the staff of the
Residence Office. Their opinion, however, does not
constitute University policy on the matter.
The returning residence priority is a system by
which a student's Draw number in the spring
housing lottery is specially weighted to improve that
student's chances of getting back into a residence
they have lived in before.
In theory, this is intended to foster some conti
nuity of residents in a given house from year to
year. However, critics of the program claim that
the returning residence priority system unfairly
penalizes students who draw poorly after their fresh
man year.
Director of Housing Rodger Whitney said the
Housing Operations Advising Committee might
make a decision about the controversial policy some
time during spring quarter.
He predicted that if the policy of granting students
returning residence priority is dropped, there would
be a grandfather clause to protect those who are
currently eligible for the priority.
Twain RF Denis Phillips criticized the current
returning residence priority system. "The bulk of
resident fellows don't think that the system is
working to produce what it is supposed to produce:
a continuity of leadership [in houses]."
Expressing hope that the University will drop the
policy, Phillips said RFs should be quite influential
in the decision. "We are one fairly influential pres
sure group, but not the only one."
Roble RF Anne Porteus noted that the decision
will probably not be made "without a lot of student
input," and added that "people know it's an unfair
system."
Debbie Williams, a resident assistant at Toyon,
explained that the policy is effective in maintaining
continuity of residents, but "at a very high cost. It
is very unfair."
Toyon RF Kathy Durham said there was "a strong
consensus [at the meeting] that there are better
ways [to maintain continuity]."
One such alternative method would be to exempt
advising associates and theme associates from The
Draw* instead giving them the option to remain in
houses they currently live in, Durham explained.
Porteus said the current reconsideration of the
policy is "not really" due to Roble's recent closing,
