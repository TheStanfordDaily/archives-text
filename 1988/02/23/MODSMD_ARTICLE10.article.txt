# Kitchen plans half-baked
## Robinson says kosher dining facility not yet ready 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
Plans to establish a kosher kitchen on campus
this spring are not as clearly developed as earlier
reported, according to Assoc. Dean of Student Af
fairs Norm Robinson.
Contrary to reports in a Feb. 11 article, Robinson
said he has not chosen Elliot Program Center as a
site for the kitchen but rather is only "looking at"
the possibility.
"The headline [in the article]] was a little mis
leading. I hadn't approved the site. I hadn't even
looked at any details," he said. However, he added,
"I'm optimistic about the prospects of getting a
kosher kitchen, but I haven't made any firm com
mitments yet."
A kosher kitchen would be used by some conser
vative and orthodox Jews who follow strict religious
dietary laws in preparing meals.
Hillel representative Jessica Mahlab, believing
that plans for the kosher kitchen were more firm,
said Robinson's most recent comments are "a large
setback."
Mahlab, a sophomore, said Robinson told her in
a meeting yesterday that "he was only 'researching
the possibility of such a kitchen.'" At the meeting,
Robinson also discussed possible student usage of
the kitchen.
Junior Daniella Evans, who attended yesterday's
meeting with Robinson and Mahlab, said Robinson
had not then reached a certain decision.
Evans, though disappointed with Robinson's
remarks, put the project in a larger context. "This
project is something that people have been working
on for decades, and regardless of whether there are
firm plans or not, we're still one step ahead of the
grouD," Evans said.
Rotrinson denied rumors that the Admissions of
fice had prompted plans for the kitchen, though a
student wrote a letter to Admissions about the
possibility that a number of Jewish students had
declined admission as a result of the lack of a kosher
kitchen. "Admissions wrote back that they were

interested [in the issue], but it didn't affect our
desire to get the kitchen," he said.
Robinson explained that the central problem is
that certain religious dietary needs are not being
met for on-campus students. "We are eager to do
something to accommodate these students," he
added.
Stanford Rabbi Ari Cartun said it was "purely
coincidental" that Robinson's announcement of the
commitment to the kitchen coincided roughly with
upcoming admissions decisions.
Students have been working on the kitchen idea
since early last year and began to lobby strongly
for it last quarter, Cartun said. "They talked with
food service and went to [Residential Education].
Then, fairly quickly, Robinson went ahead with his
commitment to the project."
