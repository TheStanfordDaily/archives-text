# Star of 'Mandela':
## Leaders need sincerity 
### Michael Lenz 
The star of the movie "Mandela" told
an audience of 200 in Kresge Auditorium
last night that the United States needs
to strengthen its efforts to end South
Africa's racist policies.
Danny Glover, who played Nelson
Mandela in the film about the black
revolutionary leader's struggle against
apartheid, said President Reagan and
other world leaders "give the impression
that they're on the side of the South
African people, but they're not."
In their statements of support for end
ing apartheid, world leaders are as in
sincere as the South African gov
ernment, Glover said.
The government is making only "cos
metic changes" such as "allowing
Africans to open up McDonald's," Glover
said. "I think the eradication of the sys
tem has to happen."
In a question and answer session fol
lowing last night's screening of the

movie, Glover discussed a range of topics
that included his own background and
the continuing struggle of black actors
for equality.
The "struggle never ceases" for blacks
in the United States, Glover said, citing
"cuts in affirmative action, cuts in ed
ucation, (and increases in) the unem
ployment level of blacks" as evidence
that the government has failed to ad
dress racial issues.
"I remember crying when I saw black
people being beat up when I was seven,
eight years old during the Civil Rights
movement," Glover said. "I began to
know which side I was on at that point."
Glover was a student activist at San
Francisco State University, where he be
came chair of the school's Black Student
Union. Later, he took up acting "as a
political expression," he said.
Despite his success, Glover said that
blacks in the movie industry continue
to face prejudice and racial stereotypes.
