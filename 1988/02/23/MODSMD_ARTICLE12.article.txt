# Drug-testing trial continues
## Judge rejects NCAA testimony 
### Bruce LeDesma Staff writer 
In the continuing battle between the
NCAA and two Stanford students over
mandatory drug testing, recent tes
timony by two NCAA witnesses have
been largely rejected by a Santa Clara
County Superior Court judge.
In yesterday's trial the NCAA tried
to call Gail Olinekova, who earned a
bachelor's degree in nutrition from Bur
nadean College in Florida, as an expert
witness. However, presiding Judge Con
rad Rushing disqualified her after
repeated objections by Stanford attor
ney Debra Zumwalt that Olinekova does
not qualify as an "expert."
According to Zumwalt, Olinekova was
only allowed to testify as an expert on
steroids, and her testimony on personal
knowledge of drug use was stricken
from the court's record.
Burnadean College — which, accord
ing to Zumwalt, has no classrooms —
recently lost its accredited status. Zum
walt described the college as a "diploma

mill." Olinekova became a popular
media figure in 1981 when an article
about her appeared in Sports Il
lustrated.
Last Wednesday the NCAA called
Carelton Nordschow, director of the
NCAA drug-testing lab in Indiana, to
testify about the results of drug tests
he conducted for organizations other
than the NCAA. However, Rushing
rejected his testimony.
Nordschow "was allowed to testify
about one lab report on the results of
a drug test," Zumwalt said. However,
even this testimony may be stricken
from the record if Rushing upholds pos
sible objections made by Zumwalt once
she has a chance to review a copy of
the underlying data behind the test.
Zumwalt noted that some dis
crepancies in that test included being
unable "to tell from the statistics
whether positive tests were actually the
same athlete tested on different oc
casions," which could potentially bloat
the numbers of drug abuse. The testing
was not conducted on a random basis,

but of those athletes considered suspi
cious of substance abuse — a fact that
Zumwalt contends may distort statisti
cal conclusions.
Asked what these testimonies have
revealed in the ongoing trial, Zumwalt
replied that it demonstrated the NCAA
"is sort of scraping the bottom of the
barrel looking for evidence of drug use."
However, Jack Kitchen, assistant to
general counsel for the NCAA, disputed
Zumwalt's argument. Referring to tes
timony of other NCAA witnesses,
Kitchen said "witnesses have indicated
their knowledge of drug usage and why
there should be a drug testing
program."
"Basically, the purpose of all this is
for all sides to put in evidence concern
ing the propriety of the drug-testing
program and the need of such a
program," Kitchen said.
According to Zumwalt, the trial will
continue with more NCAA witnesses
testifying today and Wednesday. Wit
nesses for the Stanford student plain
tiffs are scheduled to testify in March.
