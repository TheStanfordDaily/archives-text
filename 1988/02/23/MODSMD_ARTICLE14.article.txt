Court refuses textbook case
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court
refused yesterday to hear an attack on al
legedly "godless" school textbooks, dealing an
other setback to religious fundamentalists who
had hoped the Reagan revolution would foster
a return of religion to the schools.
Without a registered dissent, the justices
said they would not tamper with an appeals
court ruling that the Hawkins County, Ten
nessee, schools need not set up special reading
sessions for children of fundamentalists.
Plaintiffs in the highly publicized case had
complained that students were required to
read stories such as "The Wizard of Oz," "Cin
derella," "The Diapr of Anne Frank" and
others dealing with "occultism, secular
humanism, evolution, disobedience to parents,
pacifism and feminism."
"A dark cloud of religious oppression looms
over America's schoolhouse today," Beverly
LaHaye, president of Concerned Women for
America, said after the court's action. "All
children have lost their First Amendment right
to attend school without having their religious
beliefs attacked, ridiculed and undermined."
Officials for People for the American Way,
which helped fund the opposition to the fun
damentalists' case, hailed the Supreme Court
action as foiling an effort to hold public schools
"accountable to a rigid standard of sectarian
religious dogma."
S. Africa, Angola in combat
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A South
African warplane was shot down and three
soldiers were killed in an artillery bombard
ment, according to South African military
headquarters in Pretoria, as fighting intensi
fied between South African and Angolan forces
over the weekend in southern Angola.
After initially denying Angolan claims of
heavy combat, South Africa acknowledged yes
terday that its troops were deeply deployed in
southern Angola in pursuit of guerrillas of the
South-West Africa People's Organization,
known from its initials as SWAPO, and in
support of anti-government forces belonging
to UNITA, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
In Luanda, an Angolan government spokes
man said that South Africa now has more
than 9,000 troops in southern Angola in a
dual effort to prevent SWAPO guerrillas, who
are fighting for the independence of v «"iibia,
or South-West Africa, which South Africa
administers in defiance of the Uniited Nations,
from infiltrating that region from Angola and
to support UNITA in its latest offensive in a
13-year civil war against the country's Marxist
government.
A South African military spokesman said
later in Pretoria that a fighter-bomber had
been shot down by ground fire Saturday while
attacking Angolan units around the town of
Cuito Cuanavale in southeastern Angola in
support of UNITA.
Israel orders end to beatings
JERUSALEM — Israeli Attorney General
Yosef Harish, responding to widespread alle
gations of beatings of Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
has instructed Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
to issue strict written guidelines prohibiting
soldiers from using physical force except when
dispersing riots or making arrests.
In a highly unusual letter dated Friday and
released by his office yesterday, Harish told
Rabin he had received "numerous complaints
of cruel treatment to the inhabitants" of the
territories in recent weeks and said he feared
the numbers involved were so high that
Rabin's claim that such acts were "irregular
deeds no longer properly reflects reality."
Harish said army rules "allow for the use
of force to disperse protesters and to carry
out the arrest of suspects who resist arrest.
But the use of force must be within a
reasonable measure to reach the aim for which
it is used. It ceases when the aim is reached
— with the dispersal of the protest or the
capture of the suspected protester."
