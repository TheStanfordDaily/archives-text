# Memo links Meese to pipeline payoffs
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — A newly declas
sified 1985 memo to Attorney General
Edwin Meese 111 confirms that Israel's
Labor Party was to receive part of as
much as $700 million in proceeds from
a controversial Iraqi pipeline project
being promoted by a longtime friend of
Meese.
The memo, which is central to an
independent counsel's investigation of
the attorney general, cited a plan to
provide the money to nail down a com
mitment by Israel not to attack the $1
billion pipeline. Iraq has been Israel's
enemy for four decades.
Release of the Sept. 25, 1985, memo
marked the first official disclosure that
Israel was to have shared in the pipeline
revenues. Headed "PERSONAL &
CONFIDENTIAL - FOR YOUR EYES,
ONLY," the document said that the
arrangement for channeling some of the

funds to the Labor Party "would be
denied everywhere."
It was written by San Francisco
lawyer E. Robert Wallach, a long-time
Meese associate, at a time when he was
seeking the attorney general's help in
obtaining a U.S. stamp of political and
financial stability for the pipeline proj
ect. Wallach had been hired as a private
attorney in the project.
The proposed payments to Israel are
being investigated by independent coun
sel James McKay, who is looking into
possible violations of the Foreign Cor
rupt Practices Act. The federal law
prohibits U.S. citizens from bribing
foreign officials and specifically requires
the attorney general to take legal action
to prevent a violation if one appears
imminent.
In his memo, Wallach said that the
information about the payment plan

was provided by "8.R.," initials that
Meese's lawyers said referred to Bruce
Rappaport, a Swiss oilman and friend
of then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres, who had retained Wallach in the
venture. Rappaport has strongly denied
knowing about or suggesting any plan
to bribe Peres or his Labor Party.
The two-page memo and other docu
ments were declassified Friday and
made public yesterday by Meese's
lawyers to counter what they called "in
cendiary allegations" that have ap
peared in the press about the attorney
general and the pipeline project.
In addition to the 1985 document,
Meese attorney Nathan Lewin released
another memo to the attorney general
dated on the same day, a handwritten
letter from Peres to Meese, and Meese's
handwritten response.
