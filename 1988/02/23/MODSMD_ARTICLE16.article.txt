# Navy Sec. Webb resigns over budget cuts

### 
WASHINGTON â€” Navy Secretary
James Webb Jr. announced yesterday
that he will resign in protest over the
Pentagon's scaled-down fiscal 1989
budget request, saying that he could
neither defend the spending plan before
Congress nor support Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci, who overruled him
recently in ordering the decommission
ing of 16 Navy ships.
"Since I became Navy secretary last
year, I have stated . .. frequently my
belief that the force levels of our sea
services remain minimal and must not
be reduced," Webb said in his resigna
tion letter to President Reagan.
"Since recommendations to that ef
fect were rejected by your secretary of
defense, I am unable to support him
personally or to defend this amended
budget,"he added.
Webb's angry departure follows

nearly 10 weeks of wrangling between
Carlucci and the Navy over how to cut
about $12.3 billion from the service's
original spending blueprint. Under a
compromise worked out between the
White House and Congress during their
budget summit last fall, the Pentagon
was to cut about $33 billion from its
proposed fiscal 1989 budget.
The budget request, which Carlucci
presented to Congress on Thursday,
would mothball 16 of the Navy's older
frigates, a plan that would derail the
service's long-stated drive to build a
600-ship fleet by next year.
At the White House, where Webb's
resignation was greeted with barely dis
guised anger, officials expressed support
for Carlucci. "At this time of budget
problems, all agencies have to make
hard decisions and choices. Frank Car
lucci is making realistic decisions on a

range of budget problems," said a White
House spokesman who declined to be
identified.
Meeting with reporters yesterday
before Webb's dramatic resignation,
Carlucci defended his willingness to ac
cept a declining defense budget in the
Reagan administration's final year.
He said the Pentagon's $299.5 billion
request for fiscal 1989 avoids "politically
expedient" choices that would have been
"much more palatable" to Congress but
would have dangerously eroded the
nation's defenses.
"I want to leave my successor and
the next president with the best possible
ramp for defense spending, even though
that means taking a considerable
amount of political flak this year," Car
lucci said.
