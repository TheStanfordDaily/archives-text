# U.S., Soviets to push forward on arms treaty
## 
### 
MOSCOW — At the end of a two-day
meeting, the United States and the
Soviet Union agreed yesterday to work
out within the month ahead the
verification provisions of an accord on
reducing strategic weapons.
The move signaled the start of a
crash effort to complete such an ac
cord, which Soviet officials called the
pivot of superpower relations, in time
for it to be signed at a summit meeting
here in May or June.
Secretary of State George Shultz
characterized his 20 hours of talks
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
and Foreign Minister Eduard Shev
ardnadze as "generally positive across
the board."
Both sides hinted at modest progress
on the questions of Afghanistan and
the Persian Gulf, but provided no
details. Neither said there had been

any narrowing of differences on the
Middle East, although Shevardnadze
spoke warmly of Shultz's planned
peace trip to the area beginning
Thursday.
On regional issues in general, Shev
ardnadze told a press conference that
the superpowers have "more differ
ences than convergences." But he
added that "never were discussions so
protracted and substantive" as during
the meeting with Shultz, and this, he
said, "may provide the future basis
for joint and parallel actions in
regional conflicts."
Shultz said, at a separate news con
ference, that the two sides achieved
"important and timely" progress on
human rights issues.
The Soviets, he said, have promised
to interpret more flexibly some regu
lations on Jewish emigration, and joint

American-Soviet groups of experts will
be set up to discuss particular issues,
such as Soviet use of psychiatry
against dissidents.
Senior U.S. officials said later that
no breakthroughs were achieved, but
none had been predicted. Still, these
officials expressed considerable satis
faction with the results of the meeting.
They noted in particular the decision
to attack intensively the arms verifica
tion issue.
"Verification is the name of the
game now," one official said.
This move, another said, makes
chances of achieving an agreement to
halve offensive nuclear arms "more
probable than I thought would be the
case before this meeting."
He explained that the key remaining
problems connected with a new stra
tegic arms agreement — problems on

sea- and air-launched cruise missiles
and on mobile intercontinental ballis
tic missiles — involve disputes over
verifying limits for these weapons. In
stead of approaching these problems
separately as ceilings are negotiated,
they will now be considered within a
general verification framework.
To create such a framework, the
two sides in their joint statement "di
rected their negotiators to develop"
three documents by the time Shultz
and Shevardnadze meet again March
22-23 in Washington.
One document will deal with inspec
tion and another with provisions for
converting or eliminating the excessive
weapons, and the third will provide
for the exchange of a variety of infor
mation on the strategic weapons cov
ered by the treaty.
