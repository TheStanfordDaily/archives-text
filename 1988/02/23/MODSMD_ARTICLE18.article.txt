# Rebels release Higgins video

### 
NICOSIA, Cyprus — The ab
ductors of a U.S. Marine Corps
officer released a videotape in
Lebanon yesterday in which the
officer was depicted criticizing
U.S. policy in the Middle East and
listing his captors' demands for
his release.
In the videotape, delivered to a
Western news agency in Beirut,
the officer, Lt. Col. William Hig
gins, appears to be unharmed.
Higgins, who was seized Wed
nesday on the coastal highway
near the southern Lebanon city
of Tyre, appeared to be reading
a prepared statement. In the past,
other American hostages have
said they were forced to make
similar recordings by gunmen
standing off-camera.
The statement said that Presi

dent Reagan "has to take respon
sibilities for the crimes he has
committed against the oppressed
people in the region."
Among the demands his captors
have set for his release, Higgins'
statement said, are the with
drawal of all Israeli troops from
southern Lebanon and the release
from detention of Lebanese and
Palestinians held by the Israelis.
They also demand a halt, he
said, to U.S. "intervention" in
Lebanon and an end to visits by
"delegations to the Middle East
area in order to surround the
gains of the Islamic revolution in
occupied Palestine."
That appeared to be a reference
to the forthcoming visit to the
region of Secretary of State
George Schultz. Shultz reportedly

will visit Israel, Egypt and Jordan
this week in an bid to revive the
Middle East peace process after
two months of Palestinian unrest
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
of the Jordan river and the Gaza
Strip.
Higgins, commander of the
U.N. Truce Supervisory Organi
zation, a 75-member group of mil
itary observers created in 1948 to
patrol the Israeli-Lebanese bor
der, was abducted outside Tyre
while driving a U.N. vehicle.
A group calling itself the Or
ganization of the Oppressed of the
Earth took responsibility for his
seizure. The group is believed to
be composed mainly of Shia Mos
lems with close ties to the revolu
tionary government in Iran.
