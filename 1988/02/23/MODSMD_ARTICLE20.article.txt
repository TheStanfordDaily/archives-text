## Keep eye on Teller 
### 
Recently, it has come to
light that Edward Teller's
misrepresentation of the ca
pabilities of the Strategic Defensei
Initiative may have been a key fac
tor in President Reagan's decision
to press for SDI in the first place.
It is certainly a frightening
prospect that government bureau
cracy threatens to leave the public
in the dark about an issue with
tremendous implications for the
nation and the world.
Earlier this month, scientists at
the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory charged Teller — a
consultant at the laboratory who
is also a senior research fellow at
the Hoover Institution — with
deliberately misleading the White
House about SDl's feasibility.
The scientists speculated that
Teller's exaggeration of SDl's
progress — specifically of his pet
X-ray laser project — strengthened
the Reagan administration's com
mitment to Star Wars.
Though Teller has not re
sponded directly to the allegations,
aides say he is cooperating with
an investigation requested by Rep.
George Brown, D-Calif., and other
members of Congress, which Teller
expects will refute the charges.
But, the bureacratic tangle of
the General Accounting Office and
the House Armed Services Com
mittee, the bodies in charge of the
investigation, quells any hopes
that the public will ever know the
true story.
Much of the information sur
rounding SDI is classified, and any
information garnered during the
investigation is unlikely to be
released to the public without
being heavily censored.
The findings of the investigation
will first be made known confiden
tially to Brown in an oral briefing
Thursday. But what Brown
chooses to tell the public relies
largely upon the nature of those

findings, according to one of
Brown's aides, and it seems un
likely that much light will be shed
on the issue.
Additionally, because the ex
pected report is strictly oral, the
release of a written, declassified
version — if one is done at all —
will take at least three months,
according to the GAO.
So, official exoneration of Teller
is not likely in the near future —
if ever. Unless Teller consents to
publicly defend his credibility, the
public can only know one side of
the issue: that of the Livermore
scientists who have gone on the
record with their views.
It is disturbing to think that fun
damental disagreement exists
among the community most
knowledgeable on the subject. But
because it does exist, it is imper
ative that the scientific community
on both sides engage in open dis
cussion of the project.
Because the SDI issue is so im
portant, investigators are correct
in paying careful attention to the
release of their findings. But it is
precisely because of the importance
of the issue that the public must
be kept abreast of the manner in
which SDI decision-making is con
ducted.
After Brown hears his oral brief
ing, he should inform the public
of the findings in a written report.
It is crucial that the public receives
the full story soon, before the issue
gets lost in a bureaucratic maze.
Since the information the
Reagan administration receives
has a great effect on how it con
ducts its foreign policy — and on
how much money Congress decides
to allocate to the project — Teller
should quickly and clearly explain
his role in the decision-making
process.
In that way, he — and advisers
like him — can be held accountable
for their actions.
