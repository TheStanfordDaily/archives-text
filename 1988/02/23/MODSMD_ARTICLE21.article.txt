## Fraternities dependent upon subjective selection 
### 
AS A MEMBER of the senior
class, I find myself continually
appalled at the lack of common
sense employed by the so-called offi
cials of this university.
The student/faculty Task Force on
Fraternities and Sororities, as well as
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons,
made several statements in a Feb. 17
article regarding fraternal organiza
tions, subjective selection and housing
that neither make sense nor are use
ful.
The task force, after four years of
work, has recommended that the Uni
versity "continue to recognize fraterni
ties but reconsider providing them
with housing" unless they make their
membership selection processes more
objective. This makes no sense what
soever to anyone who even has the

slightest concept of a what a fraternal
organization is.
A fraternity is a group of people whc
join together to pursue common ideas,
ideals and interests. How on earth can
this ever be something decided upon
objectively? To even suggest that
fraternal organizations abandon their
membership practices is ridiculous.
Subjective selection is the only
method to ensure that future members
of any organization will be dedicated
and valuable assets to that organiza
tion, be it fraternal or not.
Additionally, the task force has
decided that "assignment of student
housing may not be denied on the
basis of the subjective judgments of
current or former residents of any
given house." Sure, this sounds like it
makes sense, but the task force goes

further to say they do not believe that
"subjective selection" by members of
theme houses or co-ops is a negative
thing.
There is no logic in this. Since when
is discrimination a positive thing in
some areas and not in others? If the
task force is insisting that subjective
selection is negative for fraternities,
then the theory should apply to it in
all situations.
Contrary to what was written in the
article, residents of theme houses are
not chosen completely through the
annual housing draw. Students are not
only judged subjectively by other resi
dents on whether they have completed
a theme requirement once they are in
a house, but the students must prove
themselves worthy of joining that
house prior to the Draw.

Students are given a priority to a
residence based on applications that
are subjectively judged by current
residents. What makes this different
from a fraternity? Students are still
judging other students to allocate
housing.
If the University ever wants itself to
be taken seriously, it should at least
attempt to maintain some semblance of
continuity in its policy-making. Lyons
hopes to issue a policy statement
within two months.
Let us hope that he will see the task
force findings as truly unreasonable
and will make a policy statement that
is fair and that applies to all situations
equally.
