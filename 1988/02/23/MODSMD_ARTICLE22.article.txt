# Students will hear grape growers' side
## 
### 
As The Daily's readership should
know, the Office of Student Affairs,
with the support of the President's
Office, has agreed to sponsor educa
tional programs to help students who
live in residences with University Food
Service learn more about the use of
pesticides in the grape industry and
the United Farm Workers Grape
Boycott.
This commitment is in response to a
request by MEChA (a Chicano student
organization) and the ASSU Senate.
Student Affairs has also agreed that
after educational programs and house
discussions take place in the residen
ces, a vote will take place to determine
whether or not each residence will
honor the grape boycott.
Unfortunately, due to postal delays,
the Grape Growers and Farmers

Coalition's educational materials did
not arrive until February 18. In col
laboration with MEChA, Student Af
fairs is in the process of reconfiguring
the calendar of activities.
We realize that this may present
some inconvenience. However, the
University and MEChA are committed
to providing a truly balanced educa
tional campaign so that the views of
both the UFW and the Grape Workers
and Farmers Coalition are adequately
presented so that students can make a
fully educated choice on the boycott.
We will be forwarding the additional
information to the dorms soon and will
inform your readership via ads in The
Daily of the new times and dates of
the educational activities as they are
confirmed.
We thank the Stanford community
for its patience.
