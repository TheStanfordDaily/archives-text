# Selective abortions are morally wrong
## 
### 
The Feb. 4 article on advanced
abortion techniques is misleading.
The issue is that of selective abor
tion for women who are pregnant with
multiple fetuses.
The article states that "The argu
ments for selective abortion, in many
cases, are compelling enough to make
the most avid anti-abortionist stutter."
In fact, the moral dilemmas presented
by selective abortion are the same as
the abortion of a single fetus.
Though defendents of the right-to
life may stutter at the article's subtle
argumentation, it would be inconsis
tent with their beliefs to condone
selective abortion.
The main argument in favor of
selective abortion is that it "allows a
woman to preserve the life of one or
two fetuses ... [thus avoiding the]

high risk of miscarriage ... or of
giving birth to premature fetuses,
which may not survive or may develop
neurological defects."
The ethical issues of selective abor
tion are also present in the abortion of
a single fetus.
A consensus of people agrees that
the right-to-life is based on two simple
principles, both of which can be ap
plied to the above: the human fetus is
a person, and no one has the right to
kill an innocent person for the good of
another person; in fact, not even for
the life of another person.
We've had enough bad experiences of
people being killed for the welfare of
other people, the common "good" of
societv or the "purity" of a race.
Call it "pregnancy reductions" or
anything else, if one believes in the
basic principles of the right-to-life,
then selective abortion is one more
such instance.
