## Politics sustain frats 
### 
LAST WEEK WAS an interesting
week to watch the politics of the
University in play. The Office of
Student Affairs acknowledged the release
of the report by the Task Force on Fra
ternities and Sororities (it was an unbe
lievable four years in the making), and
announced it would sit on the report for
another two months before making some
"policy decisions" (displaying its normal
amount of expediency and resolve in act
ing on such matters.)
The report's main complaint about fra
ternities concerned their policies for
choosing new members — selectively
instead of objectively. On first appraisal
the report appears to be a m£yor bureau
cratic blunder. Why did it take four years
to conclude selection is the problem? It's
hardly a subtle issue.
In looking for reasons for this other
than the incompetence of the task force
group, one might postulate that the Uni
versity went to some length to scuttle
the issue and make the report as mild
as possible.
Whatever the intentions behind it
were, the report has effectively turned a
campus discussion on the merits of
having housed fraternities at all, to the
less relevant matter of the criteria fra
ternities use to choose their members.
Fraternity members on this campus
have been known to complain that their
behavior is more closely scrutinized and
unfairly criticized than any other resi
dential group.
If the fraternities bear the burden of

unusually heavy criticism, they have
brought it upon themselves. Not unfairly,
it comes with the tremendous privileges
they have. Fraternity members have
guaranteed housing in prime campus lo
cations, while the rest of us live in
housing based on the random chance of
a draw number.
Further, since they control who is ad
mitted to their houses, they really can
be held accountable for the actions of
their members.
Considering the privileges they have
been given, it shouldn't even be beyond
the rights of the University and the stu
dent community to demand superlative
behavior of the fraternities, instead of
the often questionable behavior that
these groups are constantly defending as
being "no worse" than the dorms.
It might help to frame the debate on
the housing (or unhousing) of fraternities
in this way: None of the benefits these
houses claim they can give to the com
munity — everything from sponsoring
charitable events and drinking awareness
programs to weekly bar nights and stable
social groups — couldn't be done just as
well by a similar organization that was
unhoused (as can be witnessed through
the currently existing unhoused frater
nities and sororities).
However, there are political reasons
that keep the University from tackling
the fraternity housing question in a
straightforward manner.
Most of the fraternity houses were built
from money contributed by their alumni

members. The University owns a con
trolling percentage of the houses, but the
understood agreement is that the houses
were built for future generations of
Kappa Sigmas, Phi Delta Thetas, Theta
Delta Chis, etc.
As binding as this type of agreement
might seem to be, other universities with
similar arrangements have escaped them.
They justify the breach of contract with
the basic tenet that the university's ed
ucational mission is supreme over its
other commitments, and the fraternities
are anathema to current expectations of
race and gender interactions.
Yet, Stanford has consciously chosen
to avoid making sweeping decisions to
remove the fraternities. Perhaps it is the
ever-calling need for donations that
makes the administration fearful of of
fending possible alumni contributors.
Perhaps they are just looking for a
suitable justification.
And, perhaps they don't care about the
inequitable distribution of housing and
are making and delaying reports to dif
fuse student anger when it arises and to
generally obfuscate the issue.
