## Cut ties with Hoover 
### 
IMAGINE THAT affluent Democrats
offer a university $100 million for
a Franklin Delano Roosevelt Insti
tution for Social Justice." All the
university has to do for the money is
look the other way while the institu
tion promotes liberal causes.
No self-respecting university would
accept such money, but over the past
25 years just such an institution has
been created at Stanford. True, the
Hoover Institution is widely perceived
as a conservative think tank, but the
direction of Hoover's bias does not
matter.
No university can tolerate within.its
midst a highly autonomous, politically
active think tank, whether that think
tank espouses the values of Adam
Smith or Karl Marx.
When Stanford faculty, students and
The Daily first publicized Hoover's
political activities in 1983, there was
an understandable outcry from people
who care about the integrity of the
University.
The Hoover Institution, by its own
admission, helps advance particular
programs and political candidates,
finances extensive efforts to influence
public opinion and claims resources
making it one of the best-endowed
(conservative) research facilities in the
country. Given Hoover's open political
activities, many people at Stanford
questioned the propriety of having
such an institution on a university
campus.
At first, University President Donald
Kennedy and the Chair of Stanford's

Board of Trustees promised an inde
pendent study of the Hoover-Stanford
connection, but then they banded
behind Hoover. This touched off a
conflict at Stanford that must and will
continue until some future president of
Stanford faces up to Hoover's political
activities and does something about
them.
When controversy arises, the Hoover
Institution has numerous ways of
attempting to deflect public attention
from its political activities. A recent
effort, by Hoover Fellow George Marot
ta, has received wide press attention.
Marotta reiterates claims that
Hoover's academic freedom is being
violated by liberals at Stanford, but
the newsworthy part of his study is
his "proof of an overwhelming liberal
bias among Stanford faculty: of 218
professors in nine departments, 80
percent of those registered are Demo
crats and only 10 percent are
Republicans.
Marotta's numbers draw attention
from Hoover's political activities to the
party affiliation of Stanford faculty,
but because the problem of the Hoover
Institution has never been its conserva
tive bias — an FDR institute would be
as objectionable — the policy or party
inclinations of Stanford faculty are
simply beside the point.
Moreover, the political views of the
faculty are supposed to be irrelevant in
deciding whom to hire. Because a large
part of Hoover seems to be in the
business of supplying ideas for conser
vatives, people here wonder if Hoover's

conservative reputation is an accidental
or intended consequence of its hiring
practices.
Not long ago, Georgetown Universi
ty, frequently described as a conserva
tive institution, severed connections
with its independent (conservative)
strategic studies center. Stanford
should do the same with Hoover.
Finally, Marotta appeals to the
public's sense of fear play by claiming
that liberals at Stanford are violating
the academic freedom of Hoover
scholars. No one should be deceived by
such arguments.
As long as the Hoover Institution is
at Stanford, its right to free speech is
safe. What is being questioned is not
Hoover's op-ed program, but whether
such an institution as Hoover should
be here at all.
Severing connections with Hoover
will not silence anyone; it will merely
make it easier for the public to distin
guish what Hoover says and does from
the University as a whole.
