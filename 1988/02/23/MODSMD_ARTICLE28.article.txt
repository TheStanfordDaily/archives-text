## COP had right to veto 
### 
I WOULD LIKE to share with you
a few of my thoughts on the recent
developments surrounding the
Council of Presidents' veto of two bills
passed by the ASSU Senate at our
Feb. 9 meeting. The situation is nei
ther as dire nor as dramatic as many
would have you believe.
The COP vetoed the two bills for
legitimate reasons. In the first case,
they felt that the appropriations com
mittee should have supplied the senate
with the text of their recommendations
for groups requesting special fees.
Instead, the appropriations committee
only reported yes, no or neutral recom
mendations.
The COP's reponse was understanda
ble, since they felt, as any member of
the senate should, that since the text
of these recommendations would reflect
on the whole senate, then the senate
should have been able to peruse the
recommendations before they were
made public.
In the case of the veto of the Budget
and Finance Committee's bill transfer
ring funds from the contingency ac
count to the discretionary account, the
COP simply felt there was not enough
debate on the issue.
Granted, both of these bills passed
the senate with an overwhelming
majority, but it is fully within the
COP's power to veto them. That is the
beauty of the checks and balances
system built into most representative
democratic systems.
A veto is a parliamentary tool at the
disposal of the executive branch, to be

used when all other means of express
ing its views have failed. This is true
in all democratic governments â€”
whether they are located in Stanford,
Sacramento or Washington, D.C. is
irrelevant.
No student groups were hurt by
these vetos. No services to students
were cut. The only immediate conse
quence was a flurry of articles and
letters in The Daily.
It is time now to deal with the
matter at hand. The appropriations
committee will be reporting the text of
the recommendations at this week's
senate meeting. The Budget and
Finance Committee is going to report
on the transfer of funds, and there
will be more debate on the issue.
There is no question in my mind
that both vetos will be overridden. It
is, therefore, a waste of time for
senators, Daily reporters and the stu
dents of Stanford to get worked up
about the vetoes.
Let us concentrate instead on our
continuing efforts to improve the
services we provide to students.
It has been a learning experience for
all of us. Unfortunately, as we know
from the whole Western Culture
debate being raged in the Faculty
Senate, learning experiences are often
clouded by emotion, inaccuracies and
sensationalism.
I wish this were not so, but it is not
in my power to change it.
David Smolen
Chair of the ASSU Senate
