# BSU celebrates 20th anniversary

### Gaby Banks Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first of a two-part
article in celebration of the 20th anniversary
of Stanford's Black Student Union.

On April 5, 1968, Stanford's black students
ignited a fire that would burn relentlessly
through two decades of shifting public senti
ment.
Following the shocking assassination of civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., the
newly established Black Student Union held
a rally in White Plaza. As then-BSU co-chair
Kenny Washington spoke, 40 black students

banded together on stage and set fire to an
American flag.
Washington explained to the racially mixed
crowd, "This burning flag may mean a lot to
you, but it doesn't mean much to us. The
fact that we are Americans is only incidental
to us. The burning flag is incidental to us.
We are primarily human beings."
Nearly 20 years after Martin Luther King's
death, the fire burns strong for Stanford's
BSU. Through times of civil unrest, legal con
servatism and widespread apathy, the BSU
has maintained its boldness and its dream.
"We are here to continue the unfinished
business of the 19605," said Steve Phillips,

1984-86 BSU chair. "We stand on that history,
we learn from it, and we're inspired by it."
Amanda Kemp, last year's BSU chair, said
that unlike many similar institutions in the
country, Stanford's BSU has "an uninter
rupted history of 20 years of struggle" against
the status quo.
The BSU first introduced itself to the Stan
ford community in October 1967. Ted Spear
man, senior press representative for the
group, explained in an Oct. 19 Daily article
that the BSU planned to focus its attention
on countering apathy. "Stanford is just as
hostile to black people as the rest of the
country, perhaps more hostile be
cause of its apathy. Apathy is the
worst form of hostility," he said.
Six months later, student be
havior in response to King's death
illustrated the extent of such ap
athy. Although many students
mourned King, others expressed
indifference. An April 5, 1968,
Daily article reported: "One fellow
at Kappa Alpha, where drinks and
music created a lively atmosphere,
said, 'I'm not concerned at all.
I'm never upset at anything, and
why should I worry? I live in Mon
tana.' "
The BSU, however, answered
apathy with activism. Just hours
after the flag-burning rally at
White Plaza, 70 members of the
BSU stormed onto the stage of
Memorial Auditorium and sur
rounded then-Provost Richard
Lyman, demanding 10 points of
specific reform on minority ad
missions and employment at
Stanford and funding for the
BSU.

'It isn't just a fight
for black people.
The BSU is a
catalyst for justice
overall on this
campus.'
— Amanda Kemp

The BSU "never made an ex
plicit threat of direct action but
it was clear that ... they were in
a position to create a lot of up
heaval," said Lyman, who is cur
rently president of the Rockefeller
Foundation and was Stanford
president from 1970-80.
Seven hours later, after the ad
ministration responded in an open
meeting at Tresidder Union,
Washington shouted to the as
sembled crowd, "All our demands
have been met!"
"The BSU showed a very astute
sense of how to play their cards
and just how far to go in support
of these demands," Lyman
reflected. "Almost overnight, [the
BSU] became a very prominent
part of the campus action."
Leo Bazile, 1968-70 BSU co
chair and now an Oakland city
councilmember, described the
climate of the Stanford black stu
dent movement during his lead
ership as a "very volatile environ
ment. Everybody was questioning
tradition and values. People coin
cided in many cases and diverged

The 1970s were a
time of 'backward
political motion.
People got afraid
and people got
comfortable...'
— Keith Archuleta

in others."
"The primary point of coming
together was around questioning
of institutional racism," Bazile
said.
One of the 1968 demands called
for the admission of 10 minority
students who do not meet the
minimal academic requirements.
As promised, this demand was ful
filled, and by 1971, nine of these
10 students were enrolled and in
good academic standing, accord
ing to a Febuary 1971 Daily ar
ticle.
Improvement of minority en
rollment has remained a vital
issue for the BSU. "For 80 years,
Stanford did not admit students
of color to the University," Phil
lips said. "It took the assassina
tion of King and the uproar that
followed to change the situation."
In 1964, before establishment
of the BSU, 10 black freshmen
were enrolled at Stanford. By
1967, the number of freshmen
had risen to 37, making the total
number of black students at Stan
ford less than 100. By 1973, the
black student population at Stan
ford reached 5 percent, where it
remained for over a decade. This
year, blacks compose 8.4 percent
of the freshman class and 7.8 per
cent of the undergraduate popu
lation.
"As a population we were cer
tain that [in 1967] more than 1
percent (of black applicants)
should be capable of getting in,"
said Kemp, last year's BSU chair.
Kemp said she believed the black
student population at Stanford
should proportionally match the
national black population.
After the initial progress of the
late '60s, attitudes during the '70s
threatened the survival and the
voice of the BSU.
With the change in the political
climate, the government began to
challenge the progress of the civil
rights movement, according to
1977-78 BSU Chair Keith Archu
leta.
Archuleta said the challenge in
cluded the National Guard's at
tack at Kent State and increased
intelligence gathering on black
liberation organizations by J.
Edgar Hoover's FBI and the CIA.
Another obstacle, according to Ar
chuleta, was the Supreme Court's
ruling in Bakke v. University of
California that nationally in
stituted what he calls "reverse
racism."
This "conservative backlash"
induced a retreat from the pro
gressive rights movement both at

Stanford and across the nation,
he argued.
Quietly resisting conformity,
Stanford's BSU nearly slipped
away into non-existence, accord
ing to Archuleta. Archuleta de
scribed the era of his leadership
as a time of "backward political
motion. People got afraid and
people got comfortable — blacks
included."
According to Phillips, the BSU
probably would not have survived
"if it hadn't been for Keith (Ar
chuleta) in '75."
Archuleta continues to be an
active voice at Stanford. He is
currently director of Black Com
munity Services Center, assistant
dean of Student Affairs and a res
ident fellow at Mirrielees House.
Concerns of the BSU during the
70s included divestment in South
Africa, development of an Afro-
American studies department, the
establishment of a black theme
house and learning assistance
center and revising the Western
Civilization requirement which,
as Archuleta described, came back
in 1980 under the disguise of
Western Culture.
Since its inception, the BSU has
also been a source of cultural and
community outreach programs.
Poet Amiri Baraka was one of
many speakers brought to Stan
ford by the BSU in the early
19705, Kemp said. She cited tu
toring, talent shows and the 1970
founding of a black student news
paper, The Colonist, (which later
became the The Real News) as
further cultural structures fos
tered by the BSU.
Many of the programs for which
the BSU fought over the years
have benefited other minority
groups and the campus at large.
The learning assistance center,
housed in Sweet Hall, for exam
ple, came about because of the
BSU demands, Archuleta said.
The BSU was also instrumental
in last spring's formation of the
Rainbow Agenda, a coalition of
people of color committed to the
fight against institutional racism,
according to Kemp.
"It isn't just a fight for black
people," she said. "The BSU is a
catalyst for justice overall on this
campus."
"Just about every aspect of this
campus related or committed to
diversity is linked in some way to
the BSU," Phillips said.
The progress of the BSU had
come full circle as the "conser
vative" flickering fire of the '70s
sparked new rage in the early '80s.

in others."
"The primary point of coming
together was around questioning
of institutional racism," Bazile
said.
One of the 1968 demands called
for the admission of 10 minority
students who do not meet the
minimal academic requirements.
As promised, this demand was ful
filled, and by 1971, nine of these
10 students were enrolled and in
good academic standing, accord
ing to a Febuary 1971 Daily ar
ticle.
Improvement of minority en
rollment has remained a vital
issue for the BSU. "For 80 years,
Stanford did not admit students
of color to the University," Phil
lips said. "It took the assassina
tion of King and the uproar that
followed to change the situation."
In 1964, before establishment
of the BSU, 10 black freshmen
were enrolled at Stanford. By
1967, the number of freshmen
had risen to 37, making the total
number of black students at Stan
ford less than 100. By 1973, the
black student population at Stan
ford reached 5 percent, where it
remained for over a decade. This
year, blacks compose 8.4 percent
of the freshman class and 7.8 per
cent of the undergraduate popu
lation.
"As a population we were cer
tain that [in 1967] more than 1
percent (of black applicants)
should be capable of getting in,"
said Kemp, last year's BSU chair.
Kemp said she believed the black
student population at Stanford
should proportionally match the
national black population.
After the initial progress of the
late '60s, attitudes during the '70s
threatened the survival and the
voice of the BSU.
With the change in the political
climate, the government began to
challenge the progress of the civil
rights movement, according to
1977-78 BSU Chair Keith Archu
leta.
Archuleta said the challenge in
cluded the National Guard's at
tack at Kent State and increased
intelligence gathering on black
liberation organizations by J.
Edgar Hoover's FBI and the CIA.
Another obstacle, according to Ar
chuleta, was the Supreme Court's
ruling in Bakke v. University of
California that nationally in
stituted what he calls "reverse
racism."
This "conservative backlash"
induced a retreat from the pro
gressive rights movement both at

Stanford and across the nation,
he argued.
Quietly resisting conformity,
Stanford's BSU nearly slipped
away into non-existence, accord
ing to Archuleta. Archuleta de
scribed the era of his leadership
as a time of "backward political
motion. People got afraid and
people got comfortable — blacks
included."
According to Phillips, the BSU
probably would not have survived
"if it hadn't been for Keith (Ar
chuleta) in '75."
Archuleta continues to be an
active voice at Stanford. He is
currently director of Black Com
munity Services Center, assistant
dean of Student Affairs and a res
ident fellow at Mirrielees House.
Concerns of the BSU during the
70s included divestment in South
Africa, development of an Afro-
American studies department, the
establishment of a black theme
house and learning assistance
center and revising the Western
Civilization requirement which,
as Archuleta described, came back
in 1980 under the disguise of
Western Culture.
Since its inception, the BSU has
also been a source of cultural and
community outreach programs.
Poet Amiri Baraka was one of
many speakers brought to Stan
ford by the BSU in the early
19705, Kemp said. She cited tu
toring, talent shows and the 1970
founding of a black student news
paper, The Colonist, (which later
became the The Real News) as
further cultural structures fos
tered by the BSU.
Many of the programs for which
the BSU fought over the years
have benefited other minority
groups and the campus at large.
The learning assistance center,
housed in Sweet Hall, for exam
ple, came about because of the
BSU demands, Archuleta said.
The BSU was also instrumental
in last spring's formation of the
Rainbow Agenda, a coalition of
people of color committed to the
fight against institutional racism,
according to Kemp.
"It isn't just a fight for black
people," she said. "The BSU is a
catalyst for justice overall on this
campus."
"Just about every aspect of this
campus related or committed to
diversity is linked in some way to
the BSU," Phillips said.
The progress of the BSU had
come full circle as the "conser
vative" flickering fire of the '70s
sparked new rage in the early '80s.

The BSU has frequently demonstrated to denounce institutional
racism, Including this protest at last spring's Centennial Celebration.
Editor's note: This is the first of a two-part
article in celebration of the 20th anniversary
of Stanford's Black Student Union.

On April 5, 1968, Stanford's black students
ignited a fire that would burn relentlessly
through two decades of shifting public senti
ment.
Following the shocking assassination of civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., the
newly established Black Student Union held
a rally in White Plaza. As then-BSU co-chair
Kenny Washington spoke, 40 black students

banded together on stage and set fire to an
American flag.
Washington explained to the racially mixed
crowd, "This burning flag may mean a lot to
you, but it doesn't mean much to us. The
fact that we are Americans is only incidental
to us. The burning flag is incidental to us.
We are primarily human beings."
Nearly 20 years after Martin Luther King's
death, the fire burns strong for Stanford's
BSU. Through times of civil unrest, legal con
servatism and widespread apathy, the BSU
has maintained its boldness and its dream.
"We are here to continue the unfinished
business of the 19605," said Steve Phillips,

1984-86 BSU chair. "We stand on that history,
we learn from it, and we're inspired by it."
Amanda Kemp, last year's BSU chair, said
that unlike many similar institutions in the
country, Stanford's BSU has "an uninter
rupted history of 20 years of struggle" against
the status quo.
The BSU first introduced itself to the Stan
ford community in October 1967. Ted Spear
man, senior press representative for the
group, explained in an Oct. 19 Daily article
that the BSU planned to focus its attention
on countering apathy. "Stanford is just as
hostile to black people as the rest of the
country, perhaps more hostile be
cause of its apathy. Apathy is the
worst form of hostility," he said.
Six months later, student be
havior in response to King's death
illustrated the extent of such ap
athy. Although many students
mourned King, others expressed
indifference. An April 5, 1968,
Daily article reported: "One fellow
at Kappa Alpha, where drinks and
music created a lively atmosphere,
said, 'I'm not concerned at all.
I'm never upset at anything, and
why should I worry? I live in Mon
tana.' "
The BSU, however, answered
apathy with activism. Just hours
after the flag-burning rally at
White Plaza, 70 members of the
BSU stormed onto the stage of
Memorial Auditorium and sur
rounded then-Provost Richard
Lyman, demanding 10 points of
specific reform on minority ad
missions and employment at
Stanford and funding for the
BSU.

'It isn't just a fight
for black people.
The BSU is a
catalyst for justice
overall on this
campus.'
— Amanda Kemp

The BSU "never made an ex
plicit threat of direct action but
it was clear that ... they were in
a position to create a lot of up
heaval," said Lyman, who is cur
rently president of the Rockefeller
Foundation and was Stanford
president from 1970-80.
Seven hours later, after the ad
ministration responded in an open
meeting at Tresidder Union,
Washington shouted to the as
sembled crowd, "All our demands
have been met!"
"The BSU showed a very astute
sense of how to play their cards
and just how far to go in support
of these demands," Lyman
reflected. "Almost overnight, [the
BSU] became a very prominent
part of the campus action."
Leo Bazile, 1968-70 BSU co
chair and now an Oakland city
councilmember, described the
climate of the Stanford black stu
dent movement during his lead
ership as a "very volatile environ
ment. Everybody was questioning
tradition and values. People coin
cided in many cases and diverged

Many of the programs for which
the BSU fought over the years
have benefited other minority
groups and the campus at large.
The learning assistance center,
housed in Sweet Hall, for exam
ple, came about because of the
BSU demands, Archuleta said.
The BSU was also instrumental
in last spring's formation of the
Rainbow Agenda, a coalition of
people of color committed to the
fight against institutional racism,
according to Kemp.
"It isn't just a fight for black
people," she said. "The BSU is a
catalyst for justice overall on this
campus."
"Just about every aspect of this
campus related or committed to
diversity is linked in some way to
the BSU," Phillips said.
The progress of the BSU had
come full circle as the "conser
vative" flickering fire of the '70s
sparked new rage in the early '80s.

Editor's note: This is the first of a two-part
article in celebration of the 20th anniversary
of Stanford's Black Student Union.

On April 5, 1968, Stanford's black students
ignited a fire that would burn relentlessly
through two decades of shifting public senti
ment.
Following the shocking assassination of civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., the
newly established Black Student Union held
a rally in White Plaza. As then-BSU co-chair
Kenny Washington spoke, 40 black students

banded together on stage and set fire to an
American flag.
Washington explained to the racially mixed
crowd, "This burning flag may mean a lot to
you, but it doesn't mean much to us. The
fact that we are Americans is only incidental
to us. The burning flag is incidental to us.
We are primarily human beings."
Nearly 20 years after Martin Luther King's
death, the fire burns strong for Stanford's
BSU. Through times of civil unrest, legal con
servatism and widespread apathy, the BSU
has maintained its boldness and its dream.
"We are here to continue the unfinished
business of the 19605," said Steve Phillips,

1984-86 BSU chair. "We stand on that history,
we learn from it, and we're inspired by it."
Amanda Kemp, last year's BSU chair, said
that unlike many similar institutions in the
country, Stanford's BSU has "an uninter
rupted history of 20 years of struggle" against
the status quo.
The BSU first introduced itself to the Stan
ford community in October 1967. Ted Spear
man, senior press representative for the
group, explained in an Oct. 19 Daily article
that the BSU planned to focus its attention
on countering apathy. "Stanford is just as
hostile to black people as the rest of the
country, perhaps more hostile be
cause of its apathy. Apathy is the
worst form of hostility," he said.
Six months later, student be
havior in response to King's death
illustrated the extent of such ap
athy. Although many students
mourned King, others expressed
indifference. An April 5, 1968,
Daily article reported: "One fellow
at Kappa Alpha, where drinks and
music created a lively atmosphere,
said, 'I'm not concerned at all.
I'm never upset at anything, and
why should I worry? I live in Mon
tana.' "
The BSU, however, answered
apathy with activism. Just hours
after the flag-burning rally at
White Plaza, 70 members of the
BSU stormed onto the stage of
Memorial Auditorium and sur
rounded then-Provost Richard
Lyman, demanding 10 points of
specific reform on minority ad
missions and employment at
Stanford and funding for the
BSU.

'It isn't just a fight
for black people.
The BSU is a
catalyst for justice
overall on this
campus.'
— Amanda Kemp

The BSU "never made an ex
plicit threat of direct action but
it was clear that ... they were in
a position to create a lot of up
heaval," said Lyman, who is cur
rently president of the Rockefeller
Foundation and was Stanford
president from 1970-80.
Seven hours later, after the ad
ministration responded in an open
meeting at Tresidder Union,
Washington shouted to the as
sembled crowd, "All our demands
have been met!"
"The BSU showed a very astute
sense of how to play their cards
and just how far to go in support
of these demands," Lyman
reflected. "Almost overnight, [the
BSU] became a very prominent
part of the campus action."
Leo Bazile, 1968-70 BSU co
chair and now an Oakland city
councilmember, described the
climate of the Stanford black stu
dent movement during his lead
ership as a "very volatile environ
ment. Everybody was questioning
tradition and values. People coin
cided in many cases and diverged

The 1970s were a
time of 'backward
political motion.
People got afraid
and people got
comfortable...'
— Keith Archuleta

in others."
"The primary point of coming
together was around questioning
of institutional racism," Bazile
said.
One of the 1968 demands called
for the admission of 10 minority
students who do not meet the
minimal academic requirements.
As promised, this demand was ful
filled, and by 1971, nine of these
10 students were enrolled and in
good academic standing, accord
ing to a Febuary 1971 Daily ar
ticle.
Improvement of minority en
rollment has remained a vital
issue for the BSU. "For 80 years,
Stanford did not admit students
of color to the University," Phil
lips said. "It took the assassina
tion of King and the uproar that
followed to change the situation."
In 1964, before establishment
of the BSU, 10 black freshmen
were enrolled at Stanford. By
1967, the number of freshmen
had risen to 37, making the total
number of black students at Stan
ford less than 100. By 1973, the
black student population at Stan
ford reached 5 percent, where it
remained for over a decade. This
year, blacks compose 8.4 percent
of the freshman class and 7.8 per
cent of the undergraduate popu
lation.
"As a population we were cer
tain that [in 1967] more than 1
percent (of black applicants)
should be capable of getting in,"
said Kemp, last year's BSU chair.
Kemp said she believed the black
student population at Stanford
should proportionally match the
national black population.
After the initial progress of the
late '60s, attitudes during the '70s
threatened the survival and the
voice of the BSU.
With the change in the political
climate, the government began to
challenge the progress of the civil
rights movement, according to
1977-78 BSU Chair Keith Archu
leta.
Archuleta said the challenge in
cluded the National Guard's at
tack at Kent State and increased
intelligence gathering on black
liberation organizations by J.
Edgar Hoover's FBI and the CIA.
Another obstacle, according to Ar
chuleta, was the Supreme Court's
ruling in Bakke v. University of
California that nationally in
stituted what he calls "reverse
racism."
This "conservative backlash"
induced a retreat from the pro
gressive rights movement both at

Stanford and across the nation,
he argued.
Quietly resisting conformity,
Stanford's BSU nearly slipped
away into non-existence, accord
ing to Archuleta. Archuleta de
scribed the era of his leadership
as a time of "backward political
motion. People got afraid and
people got comfortable — blacks
included."
According to Phillips, the BSU
probably would not have survived
"if it hadn't been for Keith (Ar
chuleta) in '75."
Archuleta continues to be an
active voice at Stanford. He is
currently director of Black Com
munity Services Center, assistant
dean of Student Affairs and a res
ident fellow at Mirrielees House.
Concerns of the BSU during the
70s included divestment in South
Africa, development of an Afro-
American studies department, the
establishment of a black theme
house and learning assistance
center and revising the Western
Civilization requirement which,
as Archuleta described, came back
in 1980 under the disguise of
Western Culture.
Since its inception, the BSU has
also been a source of cultural and
community outreach programs.
Poet Amiri Baraka was one of
many speakers brought to Stan
ford by the BSU in the early
19705, Kemp said. She cited tu
toring, talent shows and the 1970
founding of a black student news
paper, The Colonist, (which later
became the The Real News) as
further cultural structures fos
tered by the BSU.
Many of the programs for which
the BSU fought over the years
have benefited other minority
groups and the campus at large.
The learning assistance center,
housed in Sweet Hall, for exam
ple, came about because of the
BSU demands, Archuleta said.
The BSU was also instrumental
in last spring's formation of the
Rainbow Agenda, a coalition of
people of color committed to the
fight against institutional racism,
according to Kemp.
"It isn't just a fight for black
people," she said. "The BSU is a
catalyst for justice overall on this
campus."
"Just about every aspect of this
campus related or committed to
diversity is linked in some way to
the BSU," Phillips said.
The progress of the BSU had
come full circle as the "conser
vative" flickering fire of the '70s
sparked new rage in the early '80s.
