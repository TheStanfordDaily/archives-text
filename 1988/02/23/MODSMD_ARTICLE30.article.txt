## Bug does Dear Abby imitation 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
Dear Bug,
I know that you are not an ad
vice columnist, but I read your
column faithfully every week and
I know that you can help me out.
I'm a neat-looking, all-around
groovy guy, a grad student in com
puter science here at Stanford.
Normally, this would be enough
to have chicks flocking over me,
but mysteriously not (sic). How
ever, I know what the problem is;
there (sic) just shy and waiting
for me. This is where I need help.

Let's take this evening for exam
ple. I was sitting at a Mac in the
Terman Library typing up
(looking way-rockin' cool) my op
erating systems paper. Mean
while, there was this hot-looking
undergrad (just a guess) sitting
at a terminal across from me. Now
get this: She was pretending that
she didn't notice that guy sitting
across from her, who was very
suavely staring at her at every
chance (sic). I, of course, handled
this like I always do. I finished
working on my paper, got a print
out and. left. Now Bug, I'm sure
I could do all right, but I just
need some kind of opening line
or something. 1 am certain that
if there's one guy on campus who
can help me, it's my hero the Bug.
So, please, what do I say in sit
uations like that? Any advice
would be greatly appreciated.

Gee, Rick, it's hard to believe
a literate, exciting kind of guy like
you is having trouble getting
dates. Especially since you hang
out at that well-known pickup
joint, Terman library. Have you
tried some of the other popular
on-campus "meat markets" like
the Math and Computer Science
Library or the Physics Tank?
But I know, it's tough for en
gineering grad students like you.
You're witty, good-looking, and
still, it's hard to meet women.
Let's examine the primary prob
lems engineering grad students
have meeting women:
Male-female ratio. Face it,
there are five men for every
woman in the School of Engineer
ing. What makes you think the
particular woman you have your

eye on is going to pick you when
she has four other dudes to choose
from? At least Stanford has a
flexible major program; at
Berkeley a woman studying engi
neering is required to select her
five guys as soon as she matric
ulates.
At this stage you might want
to consider changing your studies
to French, a program that
has three women for every guy.
Plus, French is simply a far more
sexy subject than engineering.
Women would much rather be
swept off their feet by a civilian
Parisian than, by a civil engineer.
Escondido Village. Too many
grad students are required to live
in Escondido Village. I mean, it's
not a bad place to live, but it ain't
particularly conducive to finding
dates. What the hell is a "village"
anyway? As far as I can tell, a
village is something in literature
that gets destroyed by a giant
ogre. (As in:"The Giant came
down from the hills one day and
terrorized the village.") Why don't
they rename the place something
like Escondido Place or The Vor
tex?
The Great Hair Shift. A large
number of graduate engineering
students experience this physical
phenomenon. Within days of their
matriculation in the graduate pro
gram, the hair on a student's head
slowly begins to recede like an
Alaskan glacier. Soon, however,
the hair reappears in a slightly
more bushy form on the student's
face. I wouldn't say women find
this look unappealing, but then
again, you never saw Chewbacca
surrounded by "hot-looking un
dergrads" either.
So, to combat these problems
you are going to have to learn to
be more aggresive in your ap
proach to women. This does not
mean smacking them around or
chaining them to your Macintosh,
but rather learning the proper
opening lines to convince them
that you are a suave, caring guy.
Simply follow these guidelines
and you're home free.
Your appcarance: You should
wear casual clothes; the kind of
stuff you'd wear around the
house, unless that would be un
derwear. If you must wear socks,
make sure they are not black.
Black socks should be worn only
at state funerals.
You should shave, if possible.
Bic makes an inexpensive line of
shavers, which, with any luck, you
won't confuse with their inexpen
sive line of ball-point pens. Also
be sure to comb your hair. A comb
is that plastic item with lots of
little teeth. If you own a small
plastic Godzilla that matches this
description, do not attempt to
comb your hair with it!!
Your approach: Don't approach
the woman from the front; she
might be startled by your appear

ance and try to swallow a cyanide
capsule. Don't approach from be
hind,, either, because women have
a sixth sense that protects them
from creeping rapists, insurance
salesmen and sexually oppressed
grad students on the prowl.
The only proper approach is
from the side. You should casually
move sideways toward the female
until you are close enough to look
at her computer screen. At that
point you should make an appro
priate comment about whatever
she is doing on the computer, such
as, "That's a very nice letter
you're writing to your husband
there."
The pickup line: Once you have
broken the ice with your opening
comment, you are ready to deliver
the pickup line, which will cause
the female to either melt lustily
into your arms or fetch the au
thorities. Here are a few sure-fire
ones for engineering types:
1. "Hey gorgeous, I'd love to
double-click you."
2. "Wanna test some coeffi
cients of friction together?"
3. "Let's go back to my place.
I'll pull down my menus, you open
up your icons, and together we'll
lay on the desktop."
Dear Bug,
Somehow my friends and I got
on the subject of bras. Why, you
ask? Because we are genuinely
concerned about the proper fit and
support that a bra provides a
woman. Our question is: What ex
actly makes an 18-hour bra an

18-hour bra? And what happens
after 18 hours?
- General SUPPORTERS of
Women

You see, guys, before the new
innovative microchip bra technol
ogy was invented in the 19705,
American-made bras were large
bulky thingß that were about as
comfortable to wear as armor.
Sure, you could wear imported
foreign bras which were made out
of lacy, softer fabrics, but hey,
that would be as un-American as
voting for Pat Robertson.
Those early American bras were
supported with a combination of
elastic, wires and special stitching,
which gave lots of support and
generally gave all women the Lt.
Uhura look.
But with the new bra technol
ogy came a revolution in bras.
They were smaller, offered com
fortable support and looked
smooth for the whole day. Wel
come into the 20th century of
women's undergarments; wel
come to the 18-hour bra.
However, this whole 18-hour
deal is simply a gimmick to
remind women that the bras will
be (theoretically) comfortable for
the whole day — assuming, of
course, that you rise each day at
six and sleep at midnight. Should
you wish to have more sleep it is
necessary to purchase the 14- to
16-hour bra.
As for the second part of your
question, after 18 hours the bra
turns into a pumpkin, which
usually impresses the hell out of
those who like full-figured gals.
