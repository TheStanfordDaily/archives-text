# Stanford dropout spreads pacifism
##

"Twenty-four hours a day,
the radio would tell us to hate
the Japs. A few of us tried to
stop the internment of the
Japanese, but at Stanford there
was no response," said ex-
Stanford student and pacifist
Ira Sandperl to a group of stu
dents at Columbae recently. "It
was my first failure but not
my last."
Sandperl has spent his life
learning, teaching and writing
about non-violence. He trav
eled and spoke with Martin
Luther King Jr. and Joan Baez
during the 1960s and now
resides in Palo Alto. Sandperl
works at Kepler's Bookstore
and is occasionally asked to
host seminars on pacifism with
students at the University.
A freshman at Stanford
when Pearl Harbor was at
tacked, Sandperl soon left the
University in order to "pursue
an education" without the con
fines of an institution. He says
he realized that students were
too "wrapped up in their own
lives" to see the brutality in
the world. Despite pleas from
Sandperl and a group of
Quaker students to ignite
protest, professors as well as
students ignored the efforts to
stop the Japanese internment,
Sandpearl said.
A pacifist since his early
childhood, Sandperl first be
lieved that someone serious
about non-violence would be a
hypocrite to participate in
politics. After reading Gandhi's
autobiography, however, Sand
perl was spurred to action.
Gandhi's opinion that non
violent views are not valid un
less actively practiced con
vinced Sandperl to leave his
quiet existence at Stanford and
join the struggle to protect civil
rights.
"Gandhi, the rat!" he said.
"He ruined my life!"
Since then, Sandperl has
demonstrated with King, Baez
and countless other friends in
order to teach non-violence to
those who would listen and
sometimes to those who would

not. This "mission" has taken
Baez and Sandperl to many
parts of the world, including
an ineffectual trip to Palestine.
"I was trying to show the
Palestinians a new way to fight
Israel without having to throw
stones when I was in the West
Bank, but they didn't believe
that non-violence could work,"
Sandperl said.
Baez deascribed the close
ness that is felt between
protesters in the introduction
to a book Sandperl wrote in
1974: "We travel together,
teach together, march to
gether, laugh and cry together,
sit-in together and go to jail
together."
Once when he was in jail,
Sandperl convinced a prison
guard to quit his job. "He
wanted to grow plants and
work in a nursery, but he
thought people might think he
was a sissy," Sandperl ex
plained. He convinced the
guard to do what he wants in
life and not fear the judgement
of others.
Sandperl has read extensive
ly, a dedication he says has
helped him understand the
origins of violence in the world.
"Fear is the real villain," ac
cording to Sandperl. During
one of his seminars, he asked
the students to list the activi
ties they did that day under
one of two columns, the first
for activities you enjoyed and
the second for "things you did
out of fear ftr necessity." Ifor
most sudents, ftielirsE column
was almost empty, he said.
Fear forces us to sacrifice
others so that we feel no pain,
according to Sandperl. He said
he believes people must live
their lives like Jesus Christ or
Gandhi, men who "were artists
because of the way they lived
their lives. They were not
afraid of dying."
Mousumi Roy, a junior, was
one of Sandperl's students
when he lead a seminar at
Branner during her freshman
year.
"He really is a great
speaker," Roy said. "I believe
I learned more about myself
by being his friend."
