## Cardinal shoots down Golden Eagles 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
After a long and successful weekend,
the Stanford baseball team's bats
took a rest yesterday.
The Cardinal, which pounded out
44 hits in three wins over UC-Santa
Barbara over the weekend, managed
only four hits yesterday. But Stan-

ford starter Brian Keyser and reliever Steve Chitren,
both juniors, combined to hold Cal State-Los Angeles
to three hits, and the Cardinal rolled to a 4-1 victory
at Sunken Diamond.
The win was the sixth in a row for Stanford,
now 11-5 on the year and ranked sixth nationally
in the weekly Baseball America poll.
The Cardinal travels to USC this weekend to
open Pacific 10 Southern Division play with a three
game series against the undefeated and 17th-ranked
Trojans.
After dropping two series early in the season,
Stanford seems to have developed a winning habit.
"Sure, we didn't get a lot of hits today, but we
got a victory," junior third baseman Ed Sprague
said. "We're learning to win a little more, and that's
what's important with a team like this."
Equally as important, the Cardinal got strong
outings from both Keyser and Chitren. Keyser,
making only his second appearance of the year as
he returns to full strength after an elbuw injury,
threw six shutout innings, giving up only two hits
and a walk and striking out five.
Keyser's return to active duty gives the team
more flexibility in the starting rotation and in the
bullpen.

Keyser's return "is a big bonus for us," Chitren
said. "It gives us another starter or long reliever
— whatever role he's in, he'll be effective."
Chitren, for his part, came back from a disastrous
outing Saturday against UCSB to clean up for
Keyser and record his fourth save of the season.
On Saturday, Chitren, Stanford's ace fireman,
could do no right, coming on in the ninth inning
and giving up two hits, including a grand-slam home
run, and walking four.
"In the role I play, when something like that
happens, you just have to forget about it," Chitren
said yesterday. "Something like that's going to hap
pen at least one time a season — though usually
not to that extreme."
It looked like Saturday's scene might replay itself
yesterday, though, as Chitren, pitching with a 4-0
lead, gave up a solo home run to the first batter
he faced, Greg Reid.
"I was a little frustrated (at that point)," Chitren
said. "It was an 0-2, pitch and I didn't spot the
ball where I wanted to."
But Chitren struck out the next batter, Jim
Lynch. "After I struck that guy out, I got in a
really good groove," Chitren said. "I had pretty
good command of all my pitches."
Chitren wasn't in serious trouble the rest of the
way, and struck out the side in the ninth to wrap
up the game. He finished with five strikeouts, a
walk, one hit and a run in three innings.
"Today might be the best I've thrown (this
season)," he said. "It's always good to have a strong
performance going into conference play because I
have to be effective going in there ... it's a big
boost for me right now."

The Cardinal offense never really got in gear
against Golden Eagle starter Art Salas, who whiffed
eight in 4 1/3 innings. Sprague provided a little
spark in the second inning with his fourth home
run of the year, a monumental drive that cleared

the 400 sign in dead center field.
Designated hitter senior Jeff Saenger, hitting at
a blistering .441 pace coming into the game, ex
tended his hitting streak to five games with a long
double into the left-center gap in the fifth.
