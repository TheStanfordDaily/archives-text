# NCAA titles are still a rare prize
## 
### 
While Olympic athletes go
for the gold in Calgary, many
Stanford teams are gearing up
for their NCAA stretch runs
or beginning seasons they hope
will culminate in national
titles.
During the past two years
Stanford has copped eight
NCAA team championships,
four each year, but the Cardi
nal will be hard-pressed to
match that total this season.

Roughly seven Stanford
teams could be said to have
realistic shots at NCAA cham
pionships, and women's tennis
looks like the best bet.
Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan is building a dynasty, After
losing two-time NCAA cham
pion Patty Fendick, he didn't
rebuild — he just reloaded.
This year's team is built
around the oft-injured but
marvelously talented junior
Eleni Rossides and a handful
of precociously good freshmen.
Such is the depth of Bren
nan's squad that Lisa Green,
a semifinalist in last year's
NCAA singles tournament as
a freshman, will likely play No.
3. She should be unbeatable in
that spot, and if Rossides stays
healthy, any loss for the No.
1-ranked Cardinal would be a
mtyor upset.
While the women are looking
to defend their title, the men's
tennis team is shooting for vin
dication after a rare year in
which it didn't make the
NCAAs. Stanford Coach Dick
Gould has combined two excel
lent back-to-back recruiting
classes with veteran Patrick
McEnroe, a senior, to build a
team that's deep and talented.
The Cardinal is currently
tied for first in the tennis poll
and, despite a recent upset loss
to USC, remains the class of
the West Coast. However, the
other No. 1 team, Georgia
presents a tremendous hurdle.
The Bulldogs won the NCAA
title last year and added several
outstanding recruits to a
strong nucleus of returnees.
A 1 Parker, a freshman, is al
ready at the top of the Georgia
singles lineup, and it won't
hurt the Bulldogs to host the
NCAAs at Athens.
Stanford's women's swim
ming team will also have to
face its main competition in its
home town. Texas has won the
last four NCAA champion
ships, and this year when it
looked like the Longhorns'
string might be broken, they
gained the advantage of hold
ing the NCAAs in Austin.
Texas recently pounded
Stanford, 90-50, in a deGuerre
dual meet, but the Cardinal
will be much closer at the na

tionals. Whether they can
break through to the champi
onship or not is another mat
ter.
Texas boasts the top col
legiate swimmer in the nation
in backstroker Betsy Mitchell,
but Stanford returns all but
one member of last year's
second-place squad and should
challenge the Longhorns.
Last year the men's swim
ming team won the NCAAs at
Texas, but the wolves are yap
ping at the door this season.
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney
waved a sad goodbye to Pablo
Morales and Jeff Kostoff at
graduation, and their depar
ture has left a gaping hole on
the squad. Perhaps just as im
portant as the five individual
titles Morales and Kostoff won
last year was the leadership
they provided.
The team has struggled a bit
throughout the regular season,
but like their female counter
parts, the Stanford men can be
expected to be much stronger
at the NCAAs. The cupboard
is also far from bare, as Kenney
still has bellwethers like
seniors Anthony Mosse and
Sean Murphy, but depth may
be a problem. USC is favored
this year although they only
beat Stanford 58-55 in their
recent dual meet in Los An
geles.
The men's gymnastics team
also visited Los Angeles
recently and found out that it
has some improving to do if it
hopes to meet its goal of an
NCAA championship. Illinois,
UCLA and Nebraska are con
sidered the top teams in the
country, and all three topped
the Cardinal in the UCLA In
vitational.
Stanford, however, was
handicapped by a knee injury
suffered by senior Randy Be
sosa in warm-ups. At one point
two years ago, Besosa was the
top-ranked collegiate gymnast
in the country, and after red
shirting last season, he has yet
to regain that lofty status.
Stanford Coach Sadao
Hamada has been marshalling
his forces for an all-out cham
pionship push this year, and
the rest of the squad, like Be
sosa, will have to live up to
their potential to make that
dream a reality.
Two other teams with out
side shots at NCAA rings are
baseball and women's basket
ball. Baseball won last year
with a phenomenal stretch run
built on timely hitting, strong
defense, good pitching and, yes,
a bit of luck.
So far this season offensive
firepower has been sporadic as
the Cardinal has struggled out
of the gate with a 11-5 record.
The championship squad foun
dered in the early going too,
though, and things don't start
to get serious until the Pacific
10 Southern Division season
begins.
The best Stanford women's
basketball team ever has run
roughshod over its opponents


BRENDAN HEALEY
in compiling a 23-1 record and
has climbed into the top 10 in
the polls. A Pacific 10 Conference
title is beckoning as is an NCAA
berth.
However, this team is probably
a year away from contending for
the title. When Cheryl Miller
graduated from USC, the power
center in women's basketball
shifted from the West Coast to
the South. Teams like Texas, Ten
nessee and Virginia dominate the
polls, and the young Stanford
squad has yet to face that caliber
of competition.

One or two champion
ships is an incredible
accomplishment.

So the end result is that while
Stanford will be in the running
for several NCAA championships,
the Cardinal will probably only
cop one, and two would be a
surprise.
A key for teams like men's and
women's tennis is combining
talented youth with a core of vet
erans; while baseball, men's gym
nastics and men's swimming are
struggling to find their identities
as teams.
Still, one or two championships
is an incredible accomplishment.
Stanford fans have been spoiled
by the success of the past few
years, but NCAA titles remain a
rare commodity.

title is beckoning as is an NCAA
berth.
However, this team is probably
a year away from contending for
the title. When Cheryl Miller
graduated from USC, the power
center in women's basketball
shifted from the West Coast to
the South. Teams like Texas, Ten
nessee and Virginia dominate the
polls, and the young Stanford
squad has yet to face that caliber
of competition.

One or two champion
ships is an incredible
accomplishment.

So the end result is that while
Stanford will be in the running
for several NCAA championships,
the Cardinal will probably only
cop one, and two would be a
surprise.
A key for teams like men's and
women's tennis is combining
talented youth with a core of vet
erans; while baseball, men's gym
nastics and men's swimming are
struggling to find their identities
as teams.
Still, one or two championships
is an incredible accomplishment.
Stanford fans have been spoiled
by the success of the past few
years, but NCAA titles remain a
rare commodity.
While Olympic athletes go
for the gold in Calgary, many
Stanford teams are gearing up
for their NCAA stretch runs
or beginning seasons they hope
will culminate in national
titles.
During the past two years
Stanford has copped eight
NCAA team championships,
four each year, but the Cardi
nal will be hard-pressed to
match that total this season.

Roughly seven Stanford
teams could be said to have
realistic shots at NCAA cham
pionships, and women's tennis
looks like the best bet.
Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan is building a dynasty, After
losing two-time NCAA cham
pion Patty Fendick, he didn't
rebuild — he just reloaded.
This year's team is built
around the oft-injured but
marvelously talented junior
Eleni Rossides and a handful
of precociously good freshmen.
Such is the depth of Bren
nan's squad that Lisa Green,
a semifinalist in last year's
NCAA singles tournament as
a freshman, will likely play No.
3. She should be unbeatable in
that spot, and if Rossides stays
healthy, any loss for the No.
1-ranked Cardinal would be a
mtyor upset.
While the women are looking
to defend their title, the men's
tennis team is shooting for vin
dication after a rare year in
which it didn't make the
NCAAs. Stanford Coach Dick
Gould has combined two excel
lent back-to-back recruiting
classes with veteran Patrick
McEnroe, a senior, to build a
team that's deep and talented.
The Cardinal is currently
tied for first in the tennis poll
and, despite a recent upset loss
to USC, remains the class of
the West Coast. However, the
other No. 1 team, Georgia
presents a tremendous hurdle.
The Bulldogs won the NCAA
title last year and added several
outstanding recruits to a
strong nucleus of returnees.
A 1 Parker, a freshman, is al
ready at the top of the Georgia
singles lineup, and it won't
hurt the Bulldogs to host the
NCAAs at Athens.
Stanford's women's swim
ming team will also have to
face its main competition in its
home town. Texas has won the
last four NCAA champion
ships, and this year when it
looked like the Longhorns'
string might be broken, they
gained the advantage of hold
ing the NCAAs in Austin.
Texas recently pounded
Stanford, 90-50, in a deGuerre
dual meet, but the Cardinal
will be much closer at the na

tionals. Whether they can
break through to the champi
onship or not is another mat
ter.
Texas boasts the top col
legiate swimmer in the nation
in backstroker Betsy Mitchell,
but Stanford returns all but
one member of last year's
second-place squad and should
challenge the Longhorns.
Last year the men's swim
ming team won the NCAAs at
Texas, but the wolves are yap
ping at the door this season.
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney
waved a sad goodbye to Pablo
Morales and Jeff Kostoff at
graduation, and their depar
ture has left a gaping hole on
the squad. Perhaps just as im
portant as the five individual
titles Morales and Kostoff won
last year was the leadership
they provided.
The team has struggled a bit
throughout the regular season,
but like their female counter
parts, the Stanford men can be
expected to be much stronger
at the NCAAs. The cupboard
is also far from bare, as Kenney
still has bellwethers like
seniors Anthony Mosse and
Sean Murphy, but depth may
be a problem. USC is favored
this year although they only
beat Stanford 58-55 in their
recent dual meet in Los An
geles.
The men's gymnastics team
also visited Los Angeles
recently and found out that it
has some improving to do if it
hopes to meet its goal of an
NCAA championship. Illinois,
UCLA and Nebraska are con
sidered the top teams in the
country, and all three topped
the Cardinal in the UCLA In
vitational.
Stanford, however, was
handicapped by a knee injury
suffered by senior Randy Be
sosa in warm-ups. At one point
two years ago, Besosa was the
top-ranked collegiate gymnast
in the country, and after red
shirting last season, he has yet
to regain that lofty status.
Stanford Coach Sadao
Hamada has been marshalling
his forces for an all-out cham
pionship push this year, and
the rest of the squad, like Be
sosa, will have to live up to
their potential to make that
dream a reality.
Two other teams with out
side shots at NCAA rings are
baseball and women's basket
ball. Baseball won last year
with a phenomenal stretch run
built on timely hitting, strong
defense, good pitching and, yes,
a bit of luck.
So far this season offensive
firepower has been sporadic as
the Cardinal has struggled out
of the gate with a 11-5 record.
The championship squad foun
dered in the early going too,
though, and things don't start
to get serious until the Pacific
10 Southern Division season
begins.

basketball team ever has run
