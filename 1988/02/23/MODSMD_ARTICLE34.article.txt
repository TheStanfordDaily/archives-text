# Fencers flawless on the Farm

### David Earnest Staff writer 
If Saturday's meet
was any indication
of the years to
come, fencing on
the West Coast is
only going to get
better. While the

women's team cruised to a 14-2
victory over their rivals from San
Jose State, the men battled to
gain a narrow 15-12 victory over
the Spartans. The fencing teams
finish with a perfect record at
home this season.
Led by an impressive perform
ance from the men's foil team,
the men fencers upped their
record to 10-6 this season. The
women's team now stands at 7-9.
The two teams travel to California
on Saturday to close out the reg
ular season with the Golden
Bears.
The first event of Saturday's
meet, foil, was dominated by the
Cardinal fencers. Senior Chris
Gillen and sophomore Duncan
Bell each won all three of their
bouts, while senior Craig Ring
dropped two bouts in the third
position before being pulled in fa-

'All of the women
fenced very well.
They kept their
style simple and
stuck to the fun
damentals.'

vor of freshman Stan Brobston.
Brobston won his sole bout as the
foil team easily won 7-2.
In the epee event, the Card
fencers fell victim to an experi
enced Spartan team, losing the
event 6-3. Each of the epee fencers
went 1-2 for the weapon. The
event was highlighted by a close
seventh bout in which sophomore
Peter Duimstra won 6-5. The final
point of the bout was won by
Duimstra in a rapid exchange of
thrusts from both fencers.
Duimstra finally touched Spartan
epee fencer Kurt Ikerd for the
meet's final victory.
The meet was decided in the
saber event, won by the Cardinal

on the final bout. The event began
as Spartan fencers Chris Warlick
and Dan Tibbetts defeated their
Stanford opponents by a single
touch in each bout. The next four
bouts were won by the Stanford
fencers, before San Jose State
won the seventh and eighth bouts.
With the event scored four bouts
for each team, and with Stanford
on the verge of winning the meet
at 12-9, sophomore Jim Farrell
dominated his final opponent,
winning the bout 5-0, and clinch
ing the meet for the Cardinal with
the team's 13th victory.
The women's meet was not as
close, as the fencers rolled over
the Spartans, dropping only two
of 16 bouts. Each of the women
fencers saw action in Saturday's
meet.
In her first performance with
the team since she broke her
ankle last fall, team captain
Alexandra Rankin, a senior, lost
her first bout before winning her
next three. Junior Juliet Johnson
and senior Tracy Schmidt each
won two bouts as the team
coasted to a final tally of 14-2.
Stanford men's Coach Zoran
Tulum and women's Coach
Sherry Posthumus were both

pleased with the results of the
meet. "We won, but I was not too
satisfied with the quality of our
fencing," said Tulum. "Some of
the guys fenced better than they
should have, but some did not
fence as well as they have in the
past."
Posthumus positively appraised
the women's team's impressive
performance. "All of the women
fenced very well. They kept their
style simple and stuck to the fun
damentals. I'm very pleased and
optimistic about this year's
regionals."
Both teams will try to nurse
their injured fencers back to
health before their final meet of
the season at Cal. Four of the
men fencers competed on Satur
day with various injuries, while
sophomore Elisabeth Spilman sat
out of the women's competition
with an injured wrist.
The coming meet with Cal
represents the teams' last oppor
tunity to refine their technique
before the Western Regionals. In
their first meeting this year, the
Cardinal downed the Golden
Bears at Roble Gym in November.
The meet will begin Saturday at
1 p.m.

winning the bout 5-0, and clinch
ing the meet for the Cardinal with
the team's 13th victory.
The women's meet was not as
close, as the fencers rolled over
the Spartans, dropping only two
of 16 bouts. Each of the women
fencers saw action in Saturday's
meet.
In her first performance with
the team since she broke her
ankle last fall, team captain
Alexandra Rankin, a senior, lost
her first bout before winning her
next three. Junior Juliet Johnson
and senior Tracy Schmidt each
won two bouts as the team
coasted to a final tally of 14-2.
Stanford men's Coach Zoran
Tulum and women's Coach
Sherry Posthumus were both

pleased with the results of the
meet. "We won, but I was not too
satisfied with the quality of our
fencing," said Tulum. "Some of
the guys fenced better than they
should have, but some did not
fence as well as they have in the
past."
Posthumus positively appraised
the women's team's impressive
performance. "All of the women
fenced very well. They kept their
style simple and stuck to the fun
damentals. I'm very pleased and
optimistic about this year's
regionals."
Both teams will try to nurse
their injured fencers back to
health before their final meet of
the season at Cal. Four of the
men fencers competed on Satur
day with various injuries, while
sophomore Elisabeth Spilman sat
out of the women's competition
with an injured wrist.
The coming meet with Cal
represents the teams' last oppor
tunity to refine their technique
before the Western Regionals. In
their first meeting this year, the
Cardinal downed the Golden
Bears at Roble Gym in November.
The meet will begin Saturday at
1 p.m.
