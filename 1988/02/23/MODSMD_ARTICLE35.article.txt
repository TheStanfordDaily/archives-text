# Tennis hosts San Jose State

The Stanford men's tennis team
hopes history doesn't repeat itself
today at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Last season, in the match after it
lost three times at the National In
door Team Championships in Louis
ville, Ky., the Cardinal bowed to the

University of San Diego 6-3. At 1:30 p.m. today in
the match immediately following the same tourna
ment — this year a semifinal loss to USC — Stanford
faces a similar underdog in San Jose State.
"On paper, we're a better team," Stanford Coach
Dick Gould said. "San Jose is a good team, not a
great team. But it's hard to play coming off three
matches in three days against three of the top teams
in the country. If any guy isn't ready to play, we'll
be in a dogfight."
Against third-rated USC in Louisville, the top
ranked Cardinal (with Georgia) suffered a sound
beating. Surprisingly, despite Gould sending out his
full lineup save freshman David Wheaton, the con
test ended after the singles competition, 5-1.
"I think the big point is they beat us fair and
square, and they beat us well," Gould said. "We
competed fairly well, but I expect us to play better.
We just go on from there."
Today against the Spartans, Stanford should have
an easier road to hoe. San Jose's No. 1 player
Malcolm Allen presents the stiffest challenge.
Despite Allen's three-set victory over sophomore
Jeff Tarango, the Cardinal defeated the Spartans
Feb. 2 in San Jose 5-2 without its full starting
lineup.
The most interesting matchup promises to be in
the No. 1 singles slot. Allen has beaten Tarango
three of the last four times they have played.
"Their strengths match up well; they bring out
the best in each other," San Jose State Coach John
Hubbell said. "Both rely on passing shots and return
of serve. Malcolm has a little more to gain. He is
always excited to play against Jeff."
Senior Patrick McEnroe, who won the sports
manship award at the National Indoor Team Cham
pionships and defeated Tennesse's highly-touted
Byron Talbot for the second time this year over
the weekend, follows Tarango in the singles draw.
Freshman Martin Blackman — the only Cardinal
member still undefeated in dual-match play — fresh
man Glenn Solomon, junior Curtis Dunn and soph
omore Barry Richards round out the singles con
tingent.
Sophomore Jeff Cathrall, normally the No. 4
singles player, will sit out today's contest because
of a minor ii\jury.
