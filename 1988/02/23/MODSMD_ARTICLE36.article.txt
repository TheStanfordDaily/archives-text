# Gauchos face No. 1 netters
## 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
With the Pacific 10
Conference season
beginning this
weekend and the
National Indoor
Team Champion
ships just over a

week away, the top-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team is

looking at some stiff competition
in the very near future.
Today, however, the Cardinal
will enjoy its final preseason tune
up as the Gauchos of UC-Santa
Barbara come to the Stanford
Tennis Stadium for a 1:30 p.m.
match. UCSB, 5-4, fell to the Car
dinal 8-1 last year.
Stanford, 7-0, has been tested
just once this season, but Cardinal
Coach Frank Brennan does not

think that his team will be un
prepared for the difficult matches
that lie ahead. "We had a pretty
good test this weekend (at the
Winter Invitational in Berkeley),"
he said. "We had some pressure
doubles. They (the Cardinal
players) were a little nervous."
The Cardinal's challenge in
Berkeley came from fifth-ranked
Miami (Fla.). The Hurricanes
threatened to win four of the six

singles matches, but Stanford
rallied to take a 4-2 lead after the
singles. The Cardinal then swept
the 'Canes in doubles to post a
7-2 victory.
The play of the doubles teams
last weekend against Miami and
Clemson was particularly encour
aging. Freshmen Tami and Teri
Whitlinger recorded two easy vic
tories at No. 2 doubles, and senior
Cari Hagey and freshman Sandra
Birch won two hard-fought three
set matches at the No. 1 position.
"Hagey and Birch had some
shaky moments, but they look like
they're going to be a good No. 1
team," Brennan said.
With the exception of the Miami
contest, Stanford has won each
of its matches by a 9-0 or 8-1
score. The Cardinal has
dominated even without the serv
ices of junior Eleni Rossides, who
is slated to play No. 1 singles
upon her return to the lineup.
Rossides, who has a pulled groin
muscle, has not played in a dual
match this season and is not ex
pected to be in action today. Bren
nan said that he is hopeful she
will be ready for the Arizona and
Arizona State matches Friday and
Saturday.
Teri Whitlinger and sophomore
Valerie Wilson top the Cardinal
with 7-0 singles records in dual
match play this season. Senior
Kay Tittle is also undefeated at
6-0. Birch and sophomore Lisa
Green are 6-1, and Tami
Whitlinger has a 4-1 mark.
The Cardinal doubles teams are
a collective 20-1 on the season,
with Hagey and Birch leading the
way at 7-0. Stanford's only
doubles loss of the season came
Saturday against Clemson, when
Green and Wilson were upended
in a third-set tiebreaker.
