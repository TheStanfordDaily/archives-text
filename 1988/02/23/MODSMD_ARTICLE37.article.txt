## 
### 
CALGARY, Alberta — Speed
skater Bonnie Blair won
America's second gold medal in
world-record time at the Win
ter Olympics, where the West
put a stop to the gold train
East yesterday.
Blair added a victory in the
500 meters to Brian Boitano's
figure skating gold by beating
Christa Rothenburger of East
Germany by .02 seconds.
Sigrid Wolf gave Austria its
third gold medal, setting up a
Rocky Mountain duel with
Switzerland for Alpine su
premacy.
The sorry Swedes finally won
a cross-country race, the 40-
kilometer relay, and the only
eastbound gold of the day went
to the Soviets, who won the
two-man bobsled.
Still, the Soviets lead the
medal standings with 18 total,
seven gold. East Germany,
which took 2-3 in both the
bobsled and speed skating 500,
have 14 medals, six gold.
Of 26 gold medals awarded
at the Games so far, the Soviets
and East Germans have 13.
The Soviets also have one of
two triple medal winners,
Vladimir Smirnov, who skied
the first leg of the silver-medal
cross-country relay team.
Blair did to Rothenburger on
Monday what East German
Andre Hoffmann did to Amer
ican silver medalist Eric Flaim
two days earlier in the men's
1,500.
Rothenburger lowered her
own world record by .27

seconds, skating in the second
pair in the women's 500 meters
and finishing in 39.12. Two
pairs later, Blair, of Cham
paign, 111., trimmed another .02
off the mark, winning the gold
in 39.10. Karin Kania of East
Germany won the bronze, her
sixth Olympic medal since
1980.
Flaim had lowered the 1,500-
meter men's world mark,
skating in the first pair on Sat
urday, before Hoffmann skated
two pairs later to a time that
was .06 better.
"I think I just got it on guts,"
Blair said.
Standing on the medals
podium, Blair sang along with
the national anthem, her eyes
red from crying. When the an
them was over, she cried again.
"All of my family is here,"
she said, "and I couldn't ask
for a better fan club."
"This past week, I had gone
a lap that I knew would be
good enough to beat her," Blair
said. "That's what I kept tell
ing myself, that I could go
faster. When I opened up faster
than she did, I almost knew
there that I had it."
Cold, biting winds up to 35
mph forced the second delay of
the 90-meter ski jump. Matti
Nykanen of Finland, who won
at 70 meters, will have to wait
until Tuesday to try to become
the Winter Games' first double
jumping gold medalist. He's
been waiting since last Wed
nesday.
