# When the lights go on, Stanford settles for second
## Sooners beat No. 4 Cardinal for Southwest Cup 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
After opening their
Southwest Cup
performance Sun
day afternoon with
a disappointingly
low 44.9 point
score on the paral-

lel bars, the Stanford men's gym
nastics team was more than
happy when the arena lights went
out and the meet was postponed
until yesterday, when the compe
tition was restarted from scratch.
Last night in Tempe, Ariz., the
No. 4 Cardinal reversed the trend
it had started in the aborted meet
Sunday by turning in a season
best parallel bars performance on
the way to a second-place finish
in the four-team meet. No. 7 Okla
homa took First place with a 280.1
team total. Stanford's 278.15 beat
host Arizona State and Michigan.
According to Stanford Coach
Sadao Hamada, the Cardinal lost
the meet when it scored only 45.1
on the floor exercise, over two
points worse than the Sooners'
performance on that event. That
one especially poor event score
dropped Stanford down con
siderably was not a novel exper
ience for this season's Cardinal
squad, which has seen poor
performances on one or two
events scar otherwise satisfactory

overall meets for the past three
weeks.
Ir\juries to seniors Randy Be
sosa and Chuck Gerardo have
been plaguing the Cardinal for the
past few weeks. Sophomore Con
rad Voorsanger also performed
despite various aches and pains.
"We have a few minor ankle and
knee injuries," Hamada said. "Be
cause of the injuries, we didn't
do very well on floor."

'The key is to get the
key guys healthy and
in the meantime I'll try
to get the other gym
nasts into top form.'

How the injury situation
changes over the next few weeks
is of paramount importance to the
team's chances for a superior
NCAA showing at April's national
championships. "The key is to get
the key guys healthy and in the
meantime I'll try to get the other
gymnasts into top form," Hamada
said. "The question is how many
events Randy can go and how
healthy Chuck's anldes will be."
Gerardo overcame any pain to
finish third in the meet's individ

ual competition with a score of
56.25, a team best for the season.
Senior Mike Matzek did not per
form on the pommel horse, but
led the Cardinal through the
other events, averaging 9.5 on the
five apparati.
Individual event honors went
to a number of Stanford per
formers. Gerardo and Matzek tied
for first on the rings (9.65), Be
sosa — who was able to perform
on only three events — took first
on the pommel horse (9.65), and
junior Scott SchafTer's 9.55 on the
vault was also good for a first
place trophy. Gerardo also
finished second on the pommel
(9.55), and third on the vault
(9.55) and parallel bars (9.55).
Matzek tied Gerardo on the vault
and also got third on the high
bar (9.5).
Freshman Tim Wang made his
first big splash with a fourth on
the high bar (9.4). Hamada also
noted the performance of redshirt
freshman Adam Forman, who
scored 9.4 on the rings and is
expected to begin to figure greatly
in upcoming meets.
Next weekend, Stanford hosts
No. 1 UCLA in Maples. Hamada
said he will begin to enter
stronger rosters on each event
even if it means gymnasts will
have to ignore injuries that would
otherwise be given more healing
time.
