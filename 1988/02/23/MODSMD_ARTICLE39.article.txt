# Stanford sailing splits with Cal
## 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
In a pair of regattas that
hinted at how the rest
of the season will prob
ably progress, the Stan
ford sailing team split
with rival California at
Redwood City this week-

end, finishing second on Saturday and
first on Sunday.
With moderate but unpredictable
winds challenging all 11 teams at the
regattas, Stanford and Cal were con
stantly battling for the lead in both
individual races and the overall scoring.
After having each won one regatta
and placed second in the other, the two
teams are now tied in the Northern
Sailing Series that, after seven more
regattas, will determine the Northern
California champion.
Because of the unexpectedly high
turnout at the regatta, the fleet of 31
boats was split into two fleets Saturday
morning, so that two Stanford boats
competed in the varsity division while
four other boats were sailed by the Car
dinal in the junior varsity division.
In the varsity fleet, senior Tom
Kuhnle and junior Rita Snape paired

up with senior Drew Gashler and fresh
man Kevin Hagan to start, with the
foursome ending up in second place. On
Sunday, Stanford's top varsity boat got
into high gear, winning the second
regatta by a wide margin over Cal.
Other schools in the top five during
both days were Washington, San Fran
cisco State and UCLA.
In the junior varsity fleet, the Car
dinal turned in an even better perform
ance, with Stanford boats taking three
of the top four spots on Saturday and
each of the top three on Sunday.
Freshman Dave Dowd and senior
Gina Ottoboni teamed up with junior
Ev Rend and freshman Sarah Gannett
to take first on Saturday, as both pairs
won their division. On Sunday, the over
all win went to freshman Rick Rosen
and senior Courtney Biggert, who joined
with freshman Scott Dale and sopho
more Robin Powers to finish just ahead
of two other Cardinal teams.
Overall, the Stanford team seemed
pleased with their performance during
the first regattas of the spring season.
"We expected, and we got, good com
petition from Cal's top sailors," Stan
ford sailing Coach Blake Middleton said.
"They have a few very good sailors who
will challenge us whenever we race

against them.
"What was nice to see was the way
the rest of our team matched up against
the rest of Cal's squad. I think the JV
results really indicate the depth of tal
ent on our team right now."

The two teams are now
tied in the Northern
Sailing Series that will de
termine the Northern Cali
fornia champion.

After a weekend off, the Cardinal will
return to battle Cal again in the third
and fourth regattas of the Northern
Series, hosted by the College of Marin.
By all accounts, the fierce competition
should continue on throughout the rest
of the season.
"It won't let up. Because the national
championships are in Richmond this
year, both teams are gunning for the
Northern Californian berths. That
means that we'll be fighting tooth and
nail for the Northern Series that leads
up to the qualifiers," Powers said.
