# NASA reenergizes
## Ride makes first speech since return 
### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
Making her first public speak
ing appearance since returning to
Stanford last October, Sally Ride,
the first American woman in
space, depicted a United States
space program that is alive and
well with a shuttle launch sched
uled for August.
Ride spoke about her involve
ment with the shuttle program
yesterday afternoon to a capacity
crowd at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center auditorium. She
has been on campus for the past
four months working as a member
of the Center for International
Security and Arms Control. Ride
gradated from Stanford in 1978
with a doctorate in physics.
Despite the setbacks created by
the explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger two years ago, Ride
said NASA has set itself on a
course to revive the shuttle pro
gram and follow up on earlier
plans to build a space station.
Construction of the space station
is scheduled to begin in approxi
mately 1996.
Ride said the new space policy,
signed by President Reagan last
week, was "not a mtyor depar
ture" from past NASA goals. She
added that the program is "diffi
cult to characterize as having one
specific thrust."
A crew has already been an
nounced for the next shuttle
flight, the 26th launch of a space
shuttle. Ride said the August date
appears "reasonable, assuming no
more problems." Ride added that

NASA plans to carry a tracking
system and relay satellite as cargo
in the shuttle's payload bay.
Although the original shuttle
program expected 30 to 40 shuttle
flights per year, the revitalized
program has more conservative
plans "honing in on 12 to 14
launches" per year. After the Au
gust flight, Ride said NASA will
"wait to get all the data back"
before it finalizes plans for
remaining flights. The flight
schedule goal will be reached in
1991 or 1992, as soon as Congress
provides enough funds to build a
new shuttle to replace Challenger.
Although some people ques
tioned the used of manned
shuttles after the Challenger ac
cident, Ride expressed a need to
have astronauts on board the
spacecraft.
Other designs have been con
sidered for the shuttle, according
to Ride, including redesign of the
two solid rocket boosters which
split from the aircraft two
minutes after liftoff. However, be
cause of the time involved in
making a completely new design,
Ride said "the shuttle will stay
basically in its same form for at
least a decade."
Other future NASA projects in
clude an unmanned spacecraft
which will visit Mars around
1992, another cooperative effort
with the Soviet space program,
and a possible permanent moon
base which Ride hopes to see be
come a reality. "If our goal is a
permanent presence in space, (a
moon-base) would make a useful
extension of ourselves on earth."
