# SJSU falls to grapplers

If it's really true that a team
is only as good as its last
game, then this year's Stan
ford wrestling team will be
remembered as a power
house squad.
Winning seven of its nine

matches, the Cardinal grapplers pummeled
San Jose State on Saturday night in their
final meet of the regular season, 23-13, in
front of an unusually vocal Maples Pavilion
crowd. The Stanford wrestlers avenged
their season opening 23-15 loss to the Spar
tans to finish their dual meet season with
a 5-8-0 record.
"It was an excellent effort all around,"
team captain Terry Mclntyre, a senior,
said. "Everyone wrestled really hard."
After giving up six points with a forfeit
at 118 pounds, which has been the starting
deficit for the Cardinal for all but one meet
this season, freshman Loren Vigil took the
mat against San Jose's Joel Chew for the
126-pound match. Seven minutes later,
Vigil emerged as the victor with a score
of 3-0. It was the fourth time the wrestlers
have met this season; after losing their
first match, Vigil has had three straight
victories.
At 134 pounds, sophomore Josh Lisle
dropped a close match to San Jose's Greg
Eissner, 6-8. Stanford's short slump con
tinued through the 142-pound bracket, as
freshman James Dinette lost 4-12 to Joel
Zamlich. Zamlich took first place in last
month's All-Cal tournament and had
defeated Dinette 16-8 in their only previous
meeting.
From then on, it was no looking back
for Stanford as the final six Cardinal grap
plers posted victories in their matches.
Junior Geoff Baum, at 150 pounds,

dominated San Jose's Jim Saberi to finish
his match with a 9-6 victory. Sophomore
Steve Yarbrough posted his 20th win of
the season at 158 pounds with a 19-6
demolition of Spartan JefT Profio, whom
Yarbrough had beaten twice earlier in the
season.
At 167 pounds Stanford's "freshman sen
sation," Steve Buddie, continued his win
ning ways with a 10-4 romp over his Spar
tan opponent. That victory gave Buddie
his 21st win of the year and bettered his
dual-meet record to 10-1-1.
With blood flowing from his nose, 177-
pound sophomore Ron Perry, rallied to a
7-5 victory against nemesis Scott Bensen.
Saturday's conquest gave Perry a 2-1 edge
in his series with Bensen this year.
Mclntyre, at 190 pounds, came onto the
mat for the final home match of his col
legiate career to face San Jose's Jeff Macias.
After maneuvering Macias into a front
headlock, Mclntyre rolled his opponent
over and onto his back.
"I was sure he was pinned. His back
looked pretty flat," Mclntyre said.
The hold was eventually ruled "poten
tially dangerous" by the referee and Macias
was released, but Mclntyre kept up the
pressure to win by an 18-4 margin.
With the meet out of reach of the Spar
tans, Stanford's Trent Smith came out to
compete in the heavyweight division.
Smith, at 195 pounds, competed against
San Jose's 260-pound Brent Smith and
survived the encounter to emerge with a
3-1 win.
"I was really happy with the outcome,"
Stanford coach Chris Horpel said. "That
meet was a good symbol of the team's
progress. They beat us last time, but we
spanked 'em this time around."
Postseason competition will begin next
weekend for the Cardinal wrestlers at the
Pacific 10 Conference tournament.
