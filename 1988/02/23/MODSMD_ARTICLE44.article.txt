# Native Americans seek SAT reform

Native American educators
called for the reform of stan
dardized testing and the revi
sion of existing teaching mate
rials at a conference hosted by
Stanford at Bechtel Interna
tional Center Thursday and
Friday.
Other recommendations at
the conference, called the Great
Basin Dialogue, included the
creation of a national data bank
to share education information
as well as increased teacher
training in Native American
studies.
Co-sponsored by the College
Board and the American Indian
Science and Engineering Soci
ety, the meeting was part of a
national effort "to take a new
look at Indian education in
America," according to Ann
Medicine, assistant dean of
graduate studies and regional
coordinator of the conference.
Other regional dialogues are
planned for Albuquerque, Den
ver and New Orleans, and a

report due in late October will
summarize the findings of the
series.
According to Dolores Huff,
professor of American Indian
Studies at Fresno State Uni
versity, Native Americans are
at a disadvantage because tests
like the Scholastic Aptitude
Test and high school education
texts do not include material
relevant to Native Americans.
"It isn't just Beethoven or
Steinbeck that is important,"
she said. "The tests should
reflect a multicultural society."
Junior Justin Jones, a con
ference participant, said that
while such alterations might
raise test scores for Native
Americans, he would still
prefer to take the test as it
stands. "We shouldn't be
making any exceptions for Na
tive Americans.... If you chal
lenge them some more they'll
do better."
According to HufT, however,
the goal is not to make an "In
dian test," but rather to "cue
school systems to start looking
at Indian history."
