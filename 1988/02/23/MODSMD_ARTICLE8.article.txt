# Campus suffers major blackout
## Most power restored in two hours 
### John Pollack Kathy Lachenauer Senior staff writers 
A power outage last night
plunged much of the campus into
darkness, but University tech
nicians were able to isolate the
problem within two hours and
restore electricity to most of the
affected buildings.
Late last night power was still
out near Stanford Stadium but
had been restored to Toyon Hall,
Branner Hall, Wilbur Hall, the
Cowell Cluster, Meyer Library
and Storke Publications Building,
according to Jeff Sultan, Univer
sity electricity distribution and
systems manager.
Sultan said the power outage
probably resulted from faulty in
sulation around one of the under
ground power cables running
beneath campus.
When the problem was isolated,

technicians were able to reroute
electric current around the
damaged stretch of cable using a
series of electronic switches. The
damaged cable will probably cost
$5,000 to $10,000 to replace, ac
cording to Sultan.
Stanford police turned out to
direct traffic at the corner of Palm
Drive and Arboretum Road,
where a traffic signal went out
due to the lack of power.
Power went out at about 8:30
p.m., and over 400 students
poured from Meyer into Green
Library, according to a Green li
brary portal monitor. "I don't
know if everybody is going to get
a seat — it is so crowded," the
monitor said.
According to sophomore Doug
Luden — who was studying on
the fourth floor of Meyer when
the blackout struck —"there was
about half a minute of silence and
then everyone started laughing."
"One guy sitting next to us said
there was a nuclear war," soph
omore Shih-Wei Peng said. "We
thought a rat bit into the electric
wire." After the outage, a back-up
lighting system provided enough
light for Peng to return from the
south stacks to the library's
ground floor.
Those most affected by the
power outage in Meyer were stu
dents working on computers,
Macintosh consultant Tom Bar

tett said. He explained that com
puter users who did not save their
files before the blackout lost their
work.
"People were pretty bummed
but took it well enough. One guy
was taking a nap under the prin
ter," Bartett said.
Students working on computers
in their dorms faced disaster as
well. According to residents in
Madera, 20-page research papers
for Freshman English courses
were due today. Freshman Ravi
DeSai, who lost half of her work,
predicted "It's going to be an all
nighter."
Some students welcomed the
blackout as respite from their

studies and shot off bottle rockets,
howled to the moon and engaged
in shaving cream fights.
"We're telling ghost stories and
roasting marsh mallows," shouted
sophomore Steve Tannen from
Toyon Hall's second floor terrace,
where dorm residents camped out.
Tannen said he spotted one stu
dent studying under a streetlight
by the roadside.
Although several students spec
ulated that an earthquake caused
the blackout, freshman Gianna
Bosko attributed the shortage to
a more local cause.
"[The blackout] must be a new
ASSU project to conserve energy,"
she said.
