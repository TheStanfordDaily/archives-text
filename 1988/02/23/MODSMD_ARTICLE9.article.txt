# Computer thefts still on the rise

Thieves hit campus again last
week, stealing yet another com
puter from the Varian Physics
Laboratory, bringing Stanford's
total loss of computer equipment
in the last 14 months to nearly
a quarter of a million dollars.
The Monday theft of the Apple
Macintosh SE is the latest in a
series of personal computer thefts
here, according to Stanford Police
Captain Raoul Niemeyer.
"We have noted a steady rise
in personal computer thefts oc
curing primarily in the academic
office areas and laboratories since
September 1987," Niemeyer said.
Police have no tangible leads in
the case, he said, adding that se
curity systems are now being in
stalled in several campus build
ings.
According to Niemeyer, there
have been 66 computer burglaries
reported here since last year,
leading police to believe that the
same thief or thieves are respon
sible for the crime spree.
"We have reason to suspect that
the same person or some sort of
network of criminals is responsi
ble for these incidents because the
method of operation is similar in
most of the cases," he said.
Droni Chiu, business manager
of the Varian Physics Laboratory,
agreed. "This was the second theft
from the same room, and it's be
cause we are physically located

close to the inner quadrangle,
which is where the thieves seem
to have targeted their efforts,"
Chiu said.
The same thieves are believed
to be responsible for similar
break-ins at the Psychology, An
thropology, Political Science and
Engineering departments, as well
as the Ginzton Laboratory.
Three laser-writer printers
were stolen from the Psychology
Department during one weekend
last quarter, according to Peter
Smith, a systems manager in the
department. "I think it was a pro
fessional team who knew exactly
which offices had personal com
puters and who had the equip
ment and manpower to break the
cables and remove the heavy units
out of the building," Smith said.
Thieves also stole $10,000
worth of Apple and IBM comput
ers from the History Department
earlier this year, according to ad
ministrator Nan Bentley. "We had
three attempted break-ins and
then one clean sweep," said
Bentley, adding that "whoever is
doing this obviously knows ex
actly which systems are good to
take for the resale value."
To combat the rash of burgla
ries, police have met with office
managers to discuss crime pre
vention. Police give managers
"general crime prevention tips,
such as hiring security guards,
initiating the use of various lock
down devices and using deadbolt
locks on the office doors," accord
ing to Niemeyer.
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
warned people not to challenge
suspected thieves. "We certainly
do not want anyone to confront
someone whom they suspect is
stealing a computer. We simply
want license plate numbers and
clear descriptions," Herrington
said.
"The main thing is to lock all
doors — even temporarily in be
tween breaks — because a per
sonal computer can be stolen
within minutes. People should not
rely on outer doors being locked,"
he added.
According to Bob Beth, director
of the Risk Management Office,
each University department is
looking into the "most ap
propriate" method of security for
its needs.
