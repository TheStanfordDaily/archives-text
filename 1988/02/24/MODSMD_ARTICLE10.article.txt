# Democrats hope to grab 12th District
## 
### Scott Lyon 
For local Democrats, the
feeling is this: 1988 is the year,
and the 12th Congressional
District is the place.
There is a widespread senti
ment among political observers
that the Democrats are finally
going to oust the Republicans
from the 12th District, tradi
tionally a GOP "stronghold."
The reasons are many. There
is a weak incumbent, a divisive
GOP primary and a good slate
of Democratic candidates.
All this, said Lance Weil —
who ran against current in
cumbent Ernie Konnyu in 1986
— means the 12th District is
"Democratic do-able."
To "do" the 12th, though,
the Democrats will need to
buck almost 30 years of his
tory. Traditionally, the district
has voted Republican with a
vengeance. Although neither
party can claim a majority of
voters (.43.3 percent are Dem
ocrats, 43.2 percent Repub
licans), party loyalty favors the
Republicans.
Conventional wisdom holds
that if Democratic registration
is below 50 percent, the district
leans toward the Republicans.
And Democratic registration of
under 45 percent is considered
a "lock" for the Republicans.
Since 1974, when the 12th
District was first established,
Democrats have fared poorly.
In 1974, Pete McCloskey beat
his Democratic challenger by a
more than a 2-1 margin. In
1978, he won 75 percent of the
vote.
In 1982, Ed Zschau won a
lopsided victory over Democrat
Emmet Lynch, 80,829 to
43,330. In 1984, the gap nar
rowed, with Zschau beating
Martin Carnoy 121,900 to
74,269.
However, 1986 was some
what of a turning point. In that
year, Ernie Konnyu defeated
Lance Weil 86,813 to 55,952.
Senior Subodh Chandra, pres
ident of the Stanford Demo
crats, said that election was dif
ferent because Konnyu was "an
anomaly."
"The types of Republicans
previously elected (had) been
moderate, pragmatic, caring

people ... Until Konnyu," he
said. According to Chandra,
Konnyu "is an extreme
ideologue and the people in this
district expect more from their
representatives."
How much more voters ex
pect is open to question. Kon
nyu's controversial behavior —
he allegedly harrassed some
female aides — has gained him
some negative publicity, but ac
cording to Weil, it may actually
help the incumbent.
"The average voter scans the
paper very quickly," Weil said.
"People see Konnyu's name
repetitively but they miss the
criticisms. He's built a career
on portraying himself as the
effective legislator, the man
shaking hands with the presi
dent or the pope."
But even if Konnyu manages
to deflect the criticisms, he
faces a tough challenger in the
person of Stanford Law Prof.
Tom Campbell. Campbell is
bright, articulate and increas
ingly well-known — in short,
the type of moderate Republi
can the 12th has voted for in
the past.
Yet, the prospect of a bitter
GOP primary, yielding an em
battled, weakened nominee,
cheers 12th District Demo
crats. The Democrats have
qualified candidates, any one
of which would be a "tremen
dous asset" to the district,
Chandra said.
Although a late entry could
alter the dynamics of the race,
the field now stands at four:
Gary Bond, Anna Eshoo, Jim
Garrison and Sylvia Simmons,
Eshoo, San Mateo County
supervisor, is the odds-on fa
vorite. She has a long history
of activism in Democratic
politics that includes serving as
a delegate to the Democratic
National Conventions of 1980
and 1984 and as a worker on
the presidential campaign
steering committee for Massa
chusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy
in 1980. She is also former
chair of the San Mateo County
Democratic Party.
Eshoo, who has raised about
$50,000 thus far, has "the
backing of the party," according
to Chandra. In fact, she barely
missed winning the state's Dem
ocratic endorsement at the party's
convention last Saturday.
But that endorsement process
was plagued by "irregularities,"
said senior Mark Lemley, deputy
manager of Garrison's campaign.
Garrison "is a 'new-generation'
Democrat," Lemley said.
Garrison, an international busi
ness consultant, is Eshoo's
strongest challenger. He is former
executive director of the Esalen
Institute and boasts extensive in
ternational experience and has a
message tailor-made for the 12th
District.
"Silicon Valley businesses,
which face increasing foreign
competition, will need govern
ment assistance in the 1990s that
only a Democrat will provide,"
Garrison said.
Although Garrison lacks the
party support of Eshoo, he appar
ently made a big impact on the
crowd at a recent debate held at

Stanford. He is also an effective
fund-raiser with contributions
totaling more than $70,000, the
most of any Democrat.
But "money can't always buy
you an election," said Sylvia Sim
mons, an attorney and a former
newscaster for KICU-TV 11 in
San Jose. Simmons, who has
raised about $40,000, describes
herself as fiscally conservative
and socially liberal.
Simmons said her candidacy ap
peals more to Republicans and in
dependents, as well as "mod
erate Democrats." She is gener
ally considered a longshot for the
nomination.
Gary Bond, a Mountain View
small-business consultant, states
in his campaign literature that
Konnyu is "not listening." The
theme of his campaign is "A Time
To Listen."
As an example, Bond cites Kon
nyu's stand on the Contra-aid
issue. "Despite thousands of
phone calls and letters asking him
to vote against Contra aid, he will
back Reagan and vote for more
aid." Bond is running a relatively
low-profile, "grass-roots" cam
paign.

Konnyu is "not listening." The
theme of his campaign is "A Time
To Listen."
As an example, Bond cites Kon
nyu's stand on the Contra-aid
issue. "Despite thousands of
phone calls and letters asking him
to vote against Contra aid, he will
back Reagan and vote for more
aid." Bond is running a relatively
low-profile, "grass-roots" cam
paign.
For local Democrats, the
feeling is this: 1988 is the year,
and the 12th Congressional
District is the place.
There is a widespread senti
ment among political observers
that the Democrats are finally
going to oust the Republicans
from the 12th District, tradi
tionally a GOP "stronghold."
The reasons are many. There
is a weak incumbent, a divisive
GOP primary and a good slate
of Democratic candidates.
All this, said Lance Weil —
who ran against current in
cumbent Ernie Konnyu in 1986
— means the 12th District is
"Democratic do-able."
To "do" the 12th, though,
the Democrats will need to
buck almost 30 years of his
tory. Traditionally, the district
has voted Republican with a
vengeance. Although neither
party can claim a majority of
voters (.43.3 percent are Dem
ocrats, 43.2 percent Repub
licans), party loyalty favors the
Republicans.
Conventional wisdom holds
that if Democratic registration
is below 50 percent, the district
leans toward the Republicans.
And Democratic registration of
under 45 percent is considered
a "lock" for the Republicans.
Since 1974, when the 12th
District was first established,
Democrats have fared poorly.
In 1974, Pete McCloskey beat
his Democratic challenger by a
more than a 2-1 margin. In
1978, he won 75 percent of the
vote.
In 1982, Ed Zschau won a
lopsided victory over Democrat
Emmet Lynch, 80,829 to
43,330. In 1984, the gap nar
rowed, with Zschau beating
Martin Carnoy 121,900 to
74,269.
However, 1986 was some
what of a turning point. In that
year, Ernie Konnyu defeated
Lance Weil 86,813 to 55,952.
Senior Subodh Chandra, pres
ident of the Stanford Demo
crats, said that election was dif
ferent because Konnyu was "an
anomaly."
"The types of Republicans
previously elected (had) been
moderate, pragmatic, caring

people ... Until Konnyu," he
said. According to Chandra,
Konnyu "is an extreme
ideologue and the people in this
district expect more from their
representatives."
How much more voters ex
pect is open to question. Kon
nyu's controversial behavior —
he allegedly harrassed some
female aides — has gained him
some negative publicity, but ac
cording to Weil, it may actually
help the incumbent.
"The average voter scans the
paper very quickly," Weil said.
"People see Konnyu's name
repetitively but they miss the
criticisms. He's built a career
on portraying himself as the
effective legislator, the man
shaking hands with the presi
dent or the pope."
But even if Konnyu manages
to deflect the criticisms, he
faces a tough challenger in the
person of Stanford Law Prof.
Tom Campbell. Campbell is
bright, articulate and increas
ingly well-known — in short,
the type of moderate Republi
can the 12th has voted for in
the past.
Yet, the prospect of a bitter
GOP primary, yielding an em
battled, weakened nominee,
cheers 12th District Demo
crats. The Democrats have
qualified candidates, any one
of which would be a "tremen
dous asset" to the district,
Chandra said.
Although a late entry could
alter the dynamics of the race,
the field now stands at four:
Gary Bond, Anna Eshoo, Jim
Garrison and Sylvia Simmons,
Eshoo, San Mateo County
supervisor, is the odds-on fa
vorite. She has a long history
of activism in Democratic
politics that includes serving as
a delegate to the Democratic
National Conventions of 1980
and 1984 and as a worker on
the presidential campaign
steering committee for Massa
chusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy
in 1980. She is also former
chair of the San Mateo County
Democratic Party.
Eshoo, who has raised about
$50,000 thus far, has "the
backing of the party," according
to Chandra. In fact, she barely
missed winning the state's Dem
ocratic endorsement at the party's
convention last Saturday.
But that endorsement process
was plagued by "irregularities,"
said senior Mark Lemley, deputy
manager of Garrison's campaign.
Garrison "is a 'new-generation'
Democrat," Lemley said.
Garrison, an international busi
ness consultant, is Eshoo's
strongest challenger. He is former
executive director of the Esalen
Institute and boasts extensive in
ternational experience and has a
message tailor-made for the 12th
District.
"Silicon Valley businesses,
which face increasing foreign
competition, will need govern
ment assistance in the 1990s that
only a Democrat will provide,"
Garrison said.
Although Garrison lacks the
party support of Eshoo, he appar
ently made a big impact on the
crowd at a recent debate held at

Stanford. He is also an effective
fund-raiser with contributions
totaling more than $70,000, the
most of any Democrat.
But "money can't always buy
you an election," said Sylvia Sim
mons, an attorney and a former
newscaster for KICU-TV 11 in
San Jose. Simmons, who has
raised about $40,000, describes
herself as fiscally conservative
and socially liberal.
Simmons said her candidacy ap
peals more to Republicans and in
dependents, as well as "mod
erate Democrats." She is gener
ally considered a longshot for the
nomination.
Gary Bond, a Mountain View
small-business consultant, states
in his campaign literature that
Konnyu is "not listening." The
