# Doctor questions racial stereotypes on TV
## 
### Eric Rosenfeld 
Until the advent of "The Cosby
Show," the portrayal of blacks in
television both reflected and rein
forced racial stereotypes in soci
ety, a script adviser for the
popular prime-time show said last
night at Annenberg Auditorium.
Addressing a crowd of 200 at
an event sponsored by the ASSU
Speaker's Bureau and the Black
Student Union, Dr. Alvin Pous
saint described the problems black
writers face trying to enter the
television industry, and the diffi
culties that "The Cosby Show"
encounters in its portrayal of a
middle-class black family.
Poussaint, who is an associate
professor of psychiatry at Har
vard, also listed examples of how
the media unconsciously pro
motes racial stereotypes. For in
stance, Poussaint suggested that
black females have a much better
chance of obtaining a role if they
are overweight. "Can you name
two heavy-set white women on
TV?" he asked the audience.
In another example, Poussaint
described one episode of "The
Cosby Show," in which an
"Abolish Apartheid" sign was dis
played on the set. According to
Poussaint, the president of NBC
asked Cosby to remove the sign,

claiming it was too controversial.
Cosby replied, "An "Abolish Apar
theid" sign is not a controversial
issue in a black family."
"If Cosby had not been direc
tor," Poussaint said, "the sign
would've come down."
Ironically, "The Cosby Show"
is currently the most-watched
show in South Africa, Poussaint
said. Cosby originally desired to
avoid doing business with South
Africa, according to Poussaint.
But after discussing the matter
with anti-apartheid activist
Winnie Mandela, he decided that
the show could be a good role
model for blacks and might raise
their social expectations.
"At the same time," Poussaint
said, "the South African govern
ment allowed the show to be aired
with the thought that it would
appease the black population."
It was Cosby's idea to have
Poussaint review the sitcom's
script each week. "He wanted me
to review every single script to
make sure there wasn't stereo
typical, demeaning humor involv
ing not just black people but
anyone," Poussaint said.
"When 'The Cosby Show' first
went on the air, there was a lot
of criticism from well-meaning
black reporters that it was a
'white' show," Poussaint said.

"They claimed that it did not
depict the black experience at all,"
he said.
Poussaint attributed this to the
inaccurate, prejudicial stereotype
of the black family presented in
such television shows as "Good

Times," "What's Happenin' " and
"The Jeffersons."
"When you think 'all-black' on
TV, you think comedy," Poussaint
said. "There are no all-black,
weekly dramas — "Roots" was a
mini-series."
