# Next teacher in space defends the program
## 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
Barbara Morgan, a Stanford
alumna scheduled to be the
next teacher in space, defended
civilian involvement in the
space program last night in a
speech at Skilling Auditorium.
In particular, Morgan ex
pressed her confidence in the
teaching profession. "If you
want a job done well, ask a
teacher," she said.
Morgan also refuted claims,
made after the 1986 shuttle
disaster, that teachers "didn't
belong" in space. "We did know
what we were getting in to,"
she said, noting that she had
to go through rigorous train
ing.
Three years ago, Morgan —
along with the late Christa
McAuliffe — was selected from
among 112 teachers to become
a space flight observer on the
NASA shuttle. Morgan, cur
rently a second-grade teacher
near Boise, Idaho, was a stu
dent once again as she took
classes on the technical aspects

of space flight and underwent
rigorous training to prepare
her to work in space.
As a flight observer, her
responsibilites will include par
ticipation in scientific demon
strations, taking lessons in
space, "getting up and looking
out the window" and keeping
her "hands off the buttons."
After her mission, she will
be an earthbound "space am
bassador," helping to raise
people's knowledge of the
NASA program by touring and
speaking about her experience.
Morgan said her training
time among the astronauts
helped her trust in their abil
ities and taught her how to
become a better instructor.
Morgan predicted she will go
up "a couple years from now"
when NASA decides to send a
teacher once again. Preparing
for the next flight will mean
she will undergo training a
second time, a task she readily
accepts because it helps her
sharpen her problem-solving
and cooperation skills.
