WASHINGTON - After weeks of
often tense negotiations, House Dem
ocrats last night agreed on a plan for
non-military aid to the Contra rebels
in Nicaragua.
The plan, which will go to a vote
tomorrow, would give the Pentagon
$16 million over the next four months
to purchase and deliver food, clothing,
medicine and shelter for the Contras.
The CIA, whose authorization to
deliver military and non-military aid
to the Contras expires next Tuesday,
would be barred from any role in the
program, which also would supply $14
million to help injured children.
The plan, the product of delicate
negotiations among Democrats, was
designed to provide enough aid to
satisfy conservatives within the party
but not so much as to frighten liberals.

Democratic leaders said yesterday that
they believe they have the votes to
approve the plan but they conceded
that the outcome could be close and
immediately began strong lobbying for
it.
The plan is essential "if members
truly want to provide humanitarian
aid and encourage both sides to
negotiate in good faith," said House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
At the White House, spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater declined to comment
on whether the Reagan administration
would support the new plan, saying
that the aid package is still under
review. Republican leaders in Congress
also were reviewing the plan last night
and had not taken a firm position.
Producing an aid plan has become
a major test for Wright and the rest

of the congressional Democratic lead
ership. The House defeated Reagan's
Contra aid plan, which included $3.6
million in military aid, on Feb. 3, but
failure to pass the Democratic plan
could give the administration the op
portunity to regain the initiative.
That prospect now has become a
key argument for Democratic liberals,
who are being asked to support a plan
that would help keep alive a rebel force
that they have denounced.
The new package would halt U.S.
military support for the Contras but
maintain the flow of non-military aid
through June 30. If the Contras and
the Sandinistas agree on a cease-fire
before then, aid would continue "in a
manner compatible with the cease-fire
agreement."
The $16 million in aid, including $1

million for Nicaragua's Miskito Indi
ans, would be delivered by the Penta
gon and subject to inspection by Con
gress' auditing agency, the General Ac
counting Office. The $14 million in
humanitarian aid to injured children
on both sides of the Nicaraguan con
flict would be handled by international
relief agencies such as the Red Cross.
To make the package more accept
able to the administration, the plan
provides an expedited vote on reviving
military aid to the Contras if a cease
fire in Nicaragua breaks down or the
Sandinista government reneges on its
promises to institute democratic
reforms.
The ability to get a quick vote on
military aid has been a key point for
administration officials.
