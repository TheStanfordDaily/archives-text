# Court throws out FBI evidence on terrorist
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The federal
judge presiding over the hijacking case
of alleged Lebanese terrorist Fawaz
Yunis yesterday threw out a written
confession and all other statements
Yunis made to FBI agents shortly after
his afrest, ruling that during their
"relentless questioning" the agents
had violated Yunis' constitutional
rights.
"These constitutional principles
should not be cast aside nor minimized
merely by invoking 'national security'
or 'the fight against terrorism,' " U.S.
District Court Judge Barrington
Parker said. His strongly worded 47-
page opinion repeatedly rebuked FBI
officials for the way Yunis was treated
after he was arrested last September

in international waters off Cyprus.
Parker said Yunis was not properly
advised of his rights in a way he could
understand; did not receive adequate
medical treatment for the broken
wrists he sustained while being ar
rested; was questioned for more than
nine hours without the knowledge or
approval of doctors treating him for
seasickness and was not provided an
attorney during questioning.
Parker was especially critical of the
delay between Yunis' arrest and his
arraignment here before U.S.
Magistrate Jean Dwyer, ruling that it
"appeared to serve only the govern
ment's purposes â€” ample time to
educe a confession."
An FBI spokesman said yesterday

that the bureau would not comment
on Parker's ruling or Yunis' arrest on
Sept. 13.
Yunis, 28, was wanted in connection
with the 1985 hijacking of a Royal
Jordanian jetliner from Beirut Inter
national Airport. The plane was blown
up after passengers and crew were
taken off. Yunis, at the time of the
hijacking a member of the Amal
militia, was arrested at sea after he
was lured by a former associate onto
the "Skunk Kilo," an FBI-operated
yacht, with promises of a lucrative
drug deal.
The FBI operation was planned and
carried out under the direct supervi
sion of Oliver Revell, the bureau's ex
ecutive assistant director of investiga

tion. Parker based his opinion on a
description of the arrest provided by
Reveli during earlier testimony, but
did not name Reveli in his criticisms.
It was unclear yesterday if Parker's
ruling will delay Yunis' trial, set for
March 22. The government, which has
a wealth of other evidence that Yunis
was the ringleader of the hijackers,
can appeal Parker's decision only if
prosecutors can show that exclusion
of the statements and confession
cripples their case.
A press representative for the U.S.
attorney's office said prosecutors and
Justice Department officials are
reviewing the ruling.
