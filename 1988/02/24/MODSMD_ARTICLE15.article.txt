# Dukakis wins Minn.; Gephardt takes S.D.
## Dole wins Republican race in both states 
### 
Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan.,
outpolled the entire Republican
field in yesterday's South
Dakota primary and appeared
to be headed for another win
in the Minnesota precinct
caucuses as he recharged his
bid for the Republican presi
dential nomination in his Mid
western home base.
South Dakota gave Rep.
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., a
comeback win over Massachu
setts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
but Dukakis led in early
returns from the Minnesota
caucuses.
Dole, who was angry at his
surprise loss to Vice President
Bush on Feb. 16 in New
Hampshire, found quick solace
as the action returned to
familiar rural environs. The
Senate minority leader had led
the GOP field in the lowa
caucuses on Feb. 8.
Former television evangelist
Pat Robertson was running
second in both states, gaining
fresh credibility for his effort.
The two states delivered bad

news to Rep. Jack Kemp, R-
N.Y., who had harbored par
ticularly high hopes in Minne
sota until Robertson became a
factor.
With 85 percent of the South
Dakota precincts reported, it
was Dole with 56 percent;
Robertson 19; Bush 18; Kemp
5 and 1 percent uncommitted.
In the Democratic race, Gep
hardt had 45 percent; Dukakis
30; Sen. Albert Gore Jr., Tenn.,
9; former Sen. Gary Hart,
Colo., 6, and Jesse Jackson and
Sen. Paul Simon, 111., 5 percent
each.
In Minnesota, with 56 per
cent of the precincts reported,
Dole had 42 percent in the Re
publican straw poll, Robertson
30; Kemp 15; Bush 10, with 3
percent uncommitted.
With 25 percent of the Dem
ocratic precincts tallied,
Dukakis had 34 percent; Simon
19; Jackson 18; Gephardt 8;
Gore and Hart, 1 percent each,
with 18 percent uncommitted
