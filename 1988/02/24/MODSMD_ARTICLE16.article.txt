# Robertson blasts Bush

### 
COLUMBIA, S.C. — Pat Robertson
again suggested yesterday that he thought
the disclosure of the sex scandal involving
television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart
might be part of a continuing plot to dis
credit his presidential candidacy.
In making this assertion, Robertson, a
former TV evangelist himself, made his
most bitter attack to date on Republican
front-runner George Bush, calling the vice
president "weak" and stopping just short
of accusing Bush's campaign of engineering
the revelation of Swaggart's meeting or
meetings with a prostitute at a hotel in
New Orleans.
Swaggart's encounter or encounters with
the prostitute reportedly took place months
ago, but were not publicly disclosed until
last weekend. Robertson said that calling
the disclosure's timing accidental — so
soon before South Carolina's March 5 GOP
primary and the "Super Tuesday" prima
ries on March 8 — "would stretch the
credulity of almost anybody."
"Knowing the quality of the people sur
rounding George Bush," Robertson said,
"there is nothing that I would not believe
that they would do sleazy. I have never
seen anjlhing like it."
Robertson contended that he had learned
that the Bush campaign is planning tele
vision ads "dealing with religious bigotry,"
set to run just before the primary.
"I just want to alert the voters of South
Carolina that we're not dealing with nice
people," Robertson said at a news confer
ence.
Robertson's comments amplified those

he had made about the Swaggart episode
Monday night, when he asserted that
"somebody planned 'it'." His comments
also represented the second day in a row
that Robertson harshly attacked the vice
president.
Bush, asked about Robertson's asser
tions while campaigning in Kentucky, said
that if his rival was suggesting that the
Bush campaign had orchestrated the report
about Swaggart, "that obviously isn't true."
The vice president made the remarks
during a brief encounter with reporters in
a hamlet named Bush, Ky. — named after
a George A. Bush, a storeowner and
postmaster there in the late 1800s.
Earlier yesterday, at a campaign appear
ance at a community college near St. Louis,
Mo., he responded to a reporter's shouted
question about the Robertson allegations:
"Oh, come on. It's crazy. It's an absurd
charge."
