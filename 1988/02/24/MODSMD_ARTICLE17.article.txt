Big protests erupt in Armenia
MOSCOW — Mass demonstrations report
edly involving more than 100,000 people have
erupted in the Soviet republic of Armenia,
providing dramatic evidence of ethnic tension
in the Soviet Union.
The disorder in Armenia was reported yes
terday by dissident sources in Moscow. The
official Soviet press took the unusual step of
confirming it but without specifying the num
ber of people involved.
The dissident sources said the Armenians
were demonstrating in support of a demand
for the return to Armenia of a region deeded
in 1923 to the neighboring Soviet republic of
Azerbaijan, even though more than 90 percent
of the people in the region are Armenian. The
region, situated in the Caucasus mountains,
is known as Nagorno-Karabakh.
The sources said that thousands of people
had crowded into the streets around the opera
house in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, a city
of some 650,000 about 1,100 miles southeast
of Moscow. Many of the demonstrators report
edly carried signs bearing the words "One
People, One Republic."
Kidnappers of Marine arrested
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Local security officials
and independent military observers in south
ern Lebanon said yesterday that three men
involved in the kidnapping of U.S. Marine Lt.
Col. William Higgins have been arrested, but
gave no encouragement that it might lead to
the officer's release.
Daoud Daoud, a commander of the Shiite
Amal militia, confirmed that two participants
in the abduction, as well as a third man who
was carrying a letter from Beirut to the kid
nappers with orders to bring Higgins to the
Lebanese capital, all were arrested by Amal
last Wednesday, the same day the abduction
took place near the southern port city of Tyre.
The Amal commander said his militia knew
the name of the mastermind of the kidnapping,
but had been unable to locate him. He declined
to identify the suspect or the three men being
held.
Amal security sources said they suspected
Higgins was being held in the village of Jib
sheet, about 15 miles northeast of Tyre. Hez
bollah gunmen have fanned out in a cordon
around the village, where there is heavy
Iranian influence and a fervently religious pop
ulation.
Reagan aide to succeed Webb
WASHINGTON — Moving quickly, Presi
dent Reagan nominated White House aide
William Ball yesterday to replace James Webb
Jr., who resigned angrily Monday as secretary
of the Navy in protest against budget cuts
and the mothballing of ships.
Ball, now Reagan's chief congressional lob
byist, worked closely with Secretary of Defense
Frank Carlucci when Carlucci was the
president's national security adviser.
He was chosen for the Navy post largely
because of his reputation as a team player —
in sharp contrast with the rebellious Webb,
who clashed frequently with Carlucci, accord
ing to White House and congressional sources.
"He approaches the job as serving his boss,
not pushing his own agenda," said Jim Whit
tinghill, deputy chief of staff to Senate Mi
nority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
