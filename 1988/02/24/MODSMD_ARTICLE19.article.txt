## Frat report vague 
### 
THE TASK FORCE on Fra
ternities and Sororities has
made several thoughtful but
controversial recommendations in
its final report, released after more
than four years of fact-finding and
deliberation. However, it is unclear
how these recommendations will
be implemented, if at all. These
uncertainties, combined with the
unusually long delay in completing
the report, call into question the
administration's intent in commis
sioning the report.
The task force report recom
mends that subjectively selective
student groups should continue to
be recognized, supported and
guided by the University, but that
"assignment of student housing
may not be denied based on the
subjective judgements of current
or former residents." However, the
report itself concedes that it "does
not specify the various alternatives
to subjective selection, nor does it
state which one might be best."
In other words, in order to retain
their housing, the housed frater
nities must revise their housing
criteria within the next three
years, but have not been given any
guidance whatsoever as to how
they are expected to do so.
In addition, the report recom
mends that each fraternal organi
zation, including all-male, all
female, coed, and both the predom
inantly white and predominantly
black organizations, "should have
equal access to University re
sources, provided that the group
complies with all relevant Univer
sity policies." Apparently, this in
cludes the valuable resource of
housing â€” but which are the "rel
evant policies"?
And if more fraternal organiza
tions comply with the policies,
presumably including objective se
lection procedures, how will the
University decide to allocate

housing for those groups? Will it
rededicate additional housing to
fraternal organizations to permit
all the complying groups equal
access, or will it divide the existing
11 houses among those groups?
Will groups that refuse to change
their procedures be evicted from
their housing? Can the University
itself find a way to objectively dis
tribute the housing?
There are some who argue that
the University is avoiding the real
issues by focusing on the housing
criteria and not confronting more
directly the charges that housed
fraternities perpetuate elitism,
sexism, alcohol abuse, racism and
homophobia.
Others feel that eliminating the
subjective selection criteria will ef
fectively end housed fraternities as
they exist now, and argue that the
focus on housing criteria is simply
a veil for that objective.
Still others wonder whether the
delay in issuing the final report
has been a tactic to avoid angering
fraternity alumni during the cen
tennial fund-raising campaign.
Indeed, one of the recommenda
tions seems to point toward con
ciliation in dealing with alumni
"who have been active and gener
ous in their support of fraternal
groups at Stanford." The report
has also been criticized for being
out-of-date.
These discrepancies and uncer
tainties threaten the credibility of
the report and, by extension, the
administration. Instead of commis
sioning yet another report to make
this one complete and specific,
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons should take responsibility
by acting decisively. He has said
that he hopes to issue a policy
statement within a few months.
He should do so as quickly as pos
sible to prevent further confusion
about where the University stands.
