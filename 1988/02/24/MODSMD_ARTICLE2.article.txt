### Jay Bhattacharya Staff writer 
John Ford has been named Stanford's new
vice president for development and head of
the Centennial fund-raising campaign, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy announced
yesterday. Ford will replace Henry Kiggs, who
will become president of Harvey Mudd College
next fall.
As vice president for development, Ford will
lead the University's five-year, $1.1 billion
Centennial drive, which began last year. The
fund-raising drive is running "above expecta
tions on its first anniversary . . . and has
terrific momentum going into next year,'" Ford
said yesterday.
Ford said the first year of campaigning had
yielded $200 million, in addition to some $300
million donated before the official kick-off last

year, bringing a current total of $508 million
to date.
Ford, 38, was previously associate vice pres
ident for development. Although he said he
will start some of his duties almost immedi
ately, he will not officially step into his new
position until June.
Riggs, a professor of industrial engineering,
will become president of Harvey Mudd —
located in Claremont, Calif. — next August.
"Hank has done a great job for Stanford in
preparing us for the Centennial," Kennedy
said.
Ford said he forsees no changes in Centen
nial policy as a result of his promotion to vice
president. "I have been working closely with
(Riggs) ... in mapping out the campaign, so
there will be no fundamental change in
strategy," Ford said.

In fact, one of the main reasons for Ford's
selection was to "keep the continuity of leader
ship" in the campaign, Ford said.
"The campaign is now entering its second
phase," Ford said. "The goal now is to get
more alumni and parents involved."

Toward this end, several "na
tional Centennial celebrations"
will be held across the country,
Ford said, with the first slated
for March 4-5 in San Francisco.
According to Ford, the four
mzyor areas, or "featured ob
jectives. to which a potential
donor may contribute include
money earmarked for under
graduate education, commu-

nity of scholarship, construction in the Near
West campus and an unrestricted category
for discretionary spending.
