## The
						Dollies are not trying to be like cheerleaders 
### 
I WOULD LIKE to address the Feb.
19 Viewpoint, "Cheerleaders are
OK." First, let me say that I was
pleased by the opening thoughts. The
writer clearly has a point that groups
who work hard to support Stanford,
such as the cheerleaders, deserve our
recognition and our wholehearted
support as well.
The cheerleaders have made excellent
progress for a squad that is hardly a
year old and they are filling a void
that the Dollies have never intended to
fill — that of leading the crowd in
cheers and vocal support. But beyond
this, the letter deteriorates to needless,
accusatory drivel. It moves from
"cheerleaders are OK" to "Dollies are
not OK." What happened to the prem

ise that we should stand behind our
support groups who work so hard for
us?
First, the implication that the Dollie
selection process is racist is completely
unfounded. The writer notes that
prospective Dollies of color never seem
to move beyond the first round of the
tryouts. Why is it then that two out of
the five present and three out of last
year's five Dollies hail from minority
groups?
When compared to the overall stu
dent body minority ratio, that is a
healthy percentage. The color of one's
skin is certainly not a factor in Dollie
selection.
Further, the criteria by which the
writer judges the Dollie's talent is

absurd. He notes the fact that "the
Dollies have been around for years and
have never qualified to compete in the
Collegiate Dance Team Champion
ship. . . " It is not so much that the
Dollies have never qualified to com
pete; it is that they would not think to
enter such a competition.
Present and past groups have not
felt is necessary to prove their worth
through some arbitrary, self-serving
national "rah-rah" competition and
have chosen to spend their time per
fecting routines for the Stanford
crowd, not for competition judges.
As for the plethora of quotes which
deride the Dollies' talent, there are an
equal number which have praised the

group's style and uniqueness. And for
the past two years, the Dollies have
been specially requested along with the
Arizona State squad (whom the writer
cites as an example of a fine college
dance and cheer squad) to perform
throughout Japan and Korea. Obvious
ly, there are many who eryoy their
work.
No, the Dollies do not do gymnastics
and they don't cheer. It is not that
they consider themselves above this, as
was implied, but that they are what
they are — a dance group, a visual
part of the Band and a Stanford tradi
tion which just as much as the cheer
leaders deserves our support.
