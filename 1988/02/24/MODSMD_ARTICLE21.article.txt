# Language plays a large cultural role
## 
### 
The Feb. 10 article on "Freshman
English to seek better cultural
awareness," which presented a contro
versy over whether special writing
courses for undergraduate students
from foreign countries should be
created, is a perfect example of how a
discourse on Western hegemony asserts
itself in the name of "enlightenment."
It seems to me somewhat ironic to
talk about "cultural awareness" when
the assumptions behind this issue are
being solely made at the expense of
the foreign students.
I seriously wonder whose "cultural
awareness" should be in question —
certainly not only that of the foreign
student whose grammatical mistakes
are quite frequently accompanied by
comments from her English writing
tutor which often go like "that doesn't
sound like English" or "you can't say
it like this in English."

What is at stake in these remarks is
not only the linguistic difference but
also the persistence of cultural differ
ence that is inscribed in language
itself.
In a recent writing workshop I
attended, this issue was brought up by
a Japanese student in the course of
discussing the writing style in an
opening paragraph of a paper. Accord
ing to him, Japanese scholars conven
tionally start the opening passage of a
paper with very general remarks as
opposed to writing practices here.
Obviously, what then runs the dan
ger of being rejected as "poor" writing
skills in an Anglo-American linguistic
community is not merely a question of
style but rather of "cultural difference"
which needs to be erased for the sake
of a "successful" academic career.
Do I need to re-state here the obvi
ous — that writing is never simply
just a stream-of-ink, that its effect is
never simply just linguistic but rather
ideologically saturated?
As I keep thinking about these
issues, I can't help but recall the

laudable attempts of a recent confer
ence on terrorism held at Stanford to
precisely remind us of the "terror" of
a presumably value-free language and
narrative in compounding stereotypical
cliches of terrorism.
If the intentions that motivated this
conference, which was convened on
behalf of the Stanford Humanities
Center, are to be taken seriously, then
shouldn't we acknowledge the fact that
terrorism exists in more than one form
and that ideological terrorism is
manifested in the form of "legitimate"
intervention which is, nevertheless, as
destructive as any material form of
aggression?
It would be naive to assume that as
foreign students studying at an Ameri
can university, we merely acquire some
"tools" which equip us well upon
return to our countries in order to
"enlighten" the natives' minds. What
we are taught reaches far beyond a
simple acquisition of those tools: We
are taught to speak the language that
created those tools. Shall we call it

"Western Humanism?"
The recent developments concerning
the Western Culture core-reading list
attest to that same kind of double
standard underlying the "cultural
awareness" as reflected in the discus
sion of special freshman writing
classes.
What is needed is not a segregation
of foreign students into special writing
classes that would stream them as
"inferior" or "second class English
speakers," but rather a revision of
some assumptions about writing, lan
guage and "cultural awareness."
This should not be made, however,
at the expense of the ones who are in
the fortunate position to raise such
questions. I cannot agree more with
Greg Sarris that a first step toward
this problem would certainly consist of
hiring minority tutors and offering
cultural training for instructors if this
issue is going "to make a difference"
at all.
