## Frats need subjectivity 
### 
WHEN Dean of Admissions Jean
Fetter and her staff sit down to
decide who should be admitted
to Stanford, what do they base their de
cision on? Do they look solely at SAT
scores and high school grades, the objec
tive criteria? Of course not. Fetter and
her staff should (and do) look at subjec
tive criteria in making admissions deci
sions. They try and "get a feel" for
whether an applicant could be especially
successful here: In short, they select
those who they think could make the
most of the many opportunities Stanford
presents.
Well, fraternities should be allowed to
use the same criteria in selecting'their
membership, contrary to what the Task
Force on Fraternities and Sororities
thinks. The task force finally issued its
report last week, and the recommenda
tions regarding member selection are ri
diculous and hopelessly naive at worst,
unworkable and ill-conceived at best. We
all know frats aren't about to be
abolished, but they are still held to a
ridiculously high standard no other living
group is held to.
According to the report's recommen
dations (and by a 9-5 vote), fraternities
may not deny anyone housing "on the
basis of the subjective judgments of cur
rent or former house residents." Excuse
me?
Each spring, hundreds of students go
through fraternity Rush. I've been
through Rush, and contrary to what
many in Old Union may think, much

serious interaction takes place at the
events. Just as students are evaluating
each individual fraternity (its living ar
rangements, friendship network, social
life and general attitude towards brot
herhood and fraternal life), fraternity
members are necessarily evaluating the
students who show up at the functions
(their demeanor, attitude, outlook, ac
complishments and future promise for
success within that particular fraternal
environment). Dean Jean would be
proud.
She'd also be proud (or at least respect
ful) of the basis on which potential mem
bers are chosen. Let's face it: When there
are more "applicants" than spaces avail
able, some tough choices need to be made.
They're never fun, but they are neces
sary. The central issue here is, should
fraternities have the right to select their
own membership, or should all students
who meet the "objective criteria" have
an equal shot at house membership, like
is currently the case in theme houses
and co-ops (which the task force approves
of)?
If the task force recommendations are
adopted, trouble looms ahead. What
would be the eventual difference between
the Sigma Chis, the Phi Delts and the
Kappa Sigs? All would be drawing mem
bers from the same pool, and assignment
from within that pool would be random
("objective"). What a cruel joke!
Stanford prides itself on diversity of
students and diversity of living arrange

ments. For many individuals, fraternity
life is the desired path. Within that group,
many choose a particular fraternity be
cause it alone best captures what the
student wants in a fraternity experience.
The task force recommendations, taken
to their logical conculsion, rob students
of choice by stripping fraternities of the
individuality gained through self
selection of new members.
When fraternity members collectively
evaluate a potential bid, they must ask
some tough questions: Will this person
do well in the house? Will he act in
accordance with the rules, and in general
be an asset to the house? Will he uphold
our standards and represent us well? And
finally, will he make the most of the
opportunities we offer? In short, they
ask the same questions Fetter must ask,
for both seek quality, subjectively
defined.
I know the task force report is three
years late, but it seems to me that their
selection recommendation is a bad idea
whose time has never come.
