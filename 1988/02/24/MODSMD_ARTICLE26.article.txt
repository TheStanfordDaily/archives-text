"Young people tend to take
sex and sexual freedom for
granted, but at the same time
(they) are becoming more
aware of the costs of sex. Young
people today face a dilemma:
how can you still have a satis
fying sex life without killing
yourself," said Dr. Bernie Zil
bergeld, psychologist and
former professor at the UC-San
Francisco Medical School.
Zilbergeld will be one of the
speakers at a colloquium on sex
and relationships in the '80s
here this week.
What effect the AIDS crisis
is having on sex and relation
ships is a question that is be
coming increasingly important
to college students. This wll be
one of the issues covered at
the colloquium, which is called
"Difficult Choices, Dangerous
Times: Relationships and
Sexuality in the '80s."
According to A 1 Cooper, a
psychologist at the University,
one out of every seven adoles
cents will contract some form
of venereal disease other than
AIDS before the age of twenty.
Cooper said four million cases
of chlamydia are diagnosed
every year, and four out of
every ten women will become
preagnant before the age of
twenty.
"College-age students typi
cally have feelings of immor
tality. They have an 'it can't
happen to me' attitude. College
students are a difficult popu
lation to get through to. They
have to realize that no one is
immune," Cooper said.
Education about the dangers
of AIDS and how to practice
safe sex has increased greatly
on college campuses recently.
Literature on these subjects
can be found everywhere and
condom machines are being in
stalled on campuses across the
country. The week of Valen
tines Day was also "National
Condom Week."
Today, most college-age
adults know what AIDS is and
have at least a vague idea of
what is meant by safe sex, but
simply supplying the facts
about AIDS is not enough, Zil
bergeld said. Despite the

proliferation of sex education
materials, sales of condoms
have not increased greatly, and
the incidences of all types of
venereal disease are still on the
rise in the United States.
Zilbergeld said "behavior
hasn't changed because people
are embarrassed to bring up
the subject of safe sex in a
social situation. It is very easy
to have sex, but very difficult
to talk about it."
Zilbergeld and the other
speaker at the colloquium, Dr.
Lonnie Barbach, hope to teach
Stanford students how to bet
ter talk about these sensitive
issues. Barbach is also a psy
chologist.
Because people do not know
how to raise such issues as per
sonal sexual history, AIDS and
the use of condoms, these is
sues are being ignored, Zilber
geld said.
"People are having sex and
entering into relationships
without discussing (safe sex).
People have to learn to talk
about sex. Communication can
solve most of the problems we
are facing," Zilbergeld said.
Zilbergeld said he is con
cerned that many people will
ignore the opportunity the col
loquium presents. "People who
feel there is no danger won't
come to this, but those who
feel there is no danger could
be the ones most at risk. People
have very little to lose by being
safer and smarter, but a great
deal to gain," said Zilbergeld.
