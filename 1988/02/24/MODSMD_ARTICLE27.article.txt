## Profile Director goes 'Downtown' 
### Debbie Frockt Staff writer 
This week there will be a change of pace
from the standard theatrical fare found on
campus. Opening tonight and playing
through Sunday in the Christine Ricker
Dining and Performance Center in Sterling
Quad is Marc Borsak's original musical
revue, "Downtown."
Borsak orignally conceived, produced and
directed his cabaret-style piece as an un
dergraduate at Brandeis University in Bos
ton. He is currently a master's student in
the School of Communication's journalism
program and is interested in a career in
theater criticism.
Borsak said his strong interest in musical
productions and available performance
space at the Brandeis student-run coffee
house are the mt\jor impetus for his crea
tion of this type of entertainment.
Billed as "Four for a Dollar"— because
of his work with three friends on the project
and the admission price of one dollar —
on the East Coast, "Downtown" has made
its westward migration with some major
revisions in content but has kept its basic
format intact. The two-act production con
sists of 25 songs, nine of which have been
changed since the original production. Bor
sak said that "Downtown" is "simple and
streamlined, relying on the talent of the
performers and the emotion of the songs."

The talented cast of Liz O'Prey, Brooke
Ramel and Eric Ranelletti performs all the
numbers. Some of the songs include danc
ing and others are staged with the
performers just sitting on rehearsal stools.
There is no story-line running through
out the program, so an abnormally large
burden rests on the performers to generate
audience enthusiasm.
"Downtown" is being produced as a
Ram's Head special project, the last of
which was "What the Butler Saw" in 1985.
Borsak presented the proposal to the Ram's
Head Board of Directors in the fall and
says he is happy to have a sponsor for
what was an independently produced proj
ect.
The support of a larger organization has
allowed for a more elaborate production in
terms of lighting and staging.
Borsak praises the actors in "Downtown"
and describes choreographer Gene Colon
as being "a creative powerhouse." Borsak
said he hopes that the audience will "walk
out with smiles on their faces. This is just
real entertainment . . . there is a lot of
artistic merit in it. The cast is very talented,
and I hope people will find it really fun."

"Downtown" will be playing tonight
through Sunday at the Christine Ricker
Dining and Performance Center at Sterling
Quad at 8:30 p.m. Tickets are $3 and can
be purchased in White Plaza.
