Josephs and Michael Thomas), whose credits
include the Royal Shakespeare Company, the
National Theater of Great Britain and the
BBC Shakespeare series.
Thursday and Friday, "A Midsummer's
Night's Dream" will be performed in Dinkel
spiel at 8 p.m. and "Throwing Stones at
Shakespeare" will be taking place Saturday at
8 p.m., also in Dinkelspiel.
Hosting the Shakespeare program on Sat
urday will be English Prof. Larry Friedlander
as George Bernard Shaw.
Tickets for both performances are available
at Tresidder Ticket Office for $14 or $12.50.
For those of you on a budget, you can wait
15 minutes before the curtain and leftover
tickets will go to students for $4.

gram is also presenting a reading by Elizabeth
Estensen today at noon in the Oak Lounge
