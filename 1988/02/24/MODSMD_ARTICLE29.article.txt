# Dance Review
## ABT looks good but needs improvement 
### Christina Lepnis 
Expectations are always high
when the American Ballet
Theater comes to San Fran
cisco on its annual tour. This
company rarely delivers less
than its stellar reputation
would demand — but it does
happen.
Fine technique and good en
semble dancing were not what
was missing last Wednesday
evening at the Opera House in
the first week of the company's
San Francisco engagement.
Rather, it was the absence of
contemporary zest in classical
revivals that was so con
spicuous, especially since
breathing new life into old bal
lets and carefully interpreting
them have always been two of
ABT's principal strengths.
Fortunately, the middle piece
on this mixed program, "Gala
Performance" (1938) by An
tony Tudor, managed to save
the evening from total disap
pointment with its character
flourishes and colorful presen
tation.
Three renowned ballerinas,
each with peculiar mannerisms
and self-importance, exhibited
themselves to music by
Prokofiev with a classic turn
of-the-century gala perform
ance.
Leslie Browne as the ex
uberantly eccentric Russian
ballerina and Susan Jaffe as
the deliciously pompous Italian
ballerina were especially regal
ing as they paraded the stage
in their plumed headdresses
and try to outshine one an
other.
The evening began with
George Balanchine's "Ballet
Imperial" (1941), a large-scale
work in homage to the grand

19th-century Rusian ballet.
The choreography was faith
fully executed but the piece
came across strangely dull and
uncommitted. The formality
and imperial rigidity inherent
in the ballet need an artistic
director's stylization to effec
tively capture the majestic
quality Balanchine intended to
project.
The impressive scenic design
by Rouben Ter-Arutunian
showing the Neva and the
Peter-Paul fortree of St.
Petersburg succeeded far more
than the cast to this end.
Harold Lander's "Etudes"
(1948), which closed the pro
gram, depicts the progression
of ballet training from elemen
tary barre exercises to techni
cal and artistic accomplish
ment.
Yet, as well conceived as the
work was, it suffered from ex
cessive length.
"Etudes" could have bene
fited from a good editor and
placement on an entirely dif
ferent program composed of
maximally contrasting pieces.
The American Ballet Theater
will present two more mixed
programs tonight and
Thursday night both featuring
Leonide Massine's splashy
"Gaite Parisienne" (1938).
Thursday's program will in
clude Antony Tudor's excep
tional dramatic narrative "Pil
lar of Fire" (1942).
The company concludes its
final week at the Opera House
with five performances of the
full-length ballet "Giselle,"
newly staged by Mikhail
Baryshnikov, beginning Friday
and continuing through the
weekend.
