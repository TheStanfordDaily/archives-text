## Though the tactics have changed, the battle still rages on Features

Editor's note: This is the second
of a two-part article in celebration
of the 20th anniversary of Stan
ford's Black Student Union.

Since the radical 19605, the
focus, tactics and profile of Stan
ford's Black Student Union have
changed along with the political
climate of the University. The
continuing goal of the BSU, as in
the past, is to combat institutional
racism.
"Racism is not just a burning
cross anymore," said Keith Ar
chuleta, 1977-78 BSU chair and
present assistant dean of Student
Affairs. "You have to be able to
see beneath what's ingrained in
our system."
Some think negative public sen
timents have slowed the momen
tum of the BSU in the '80s.
"People have backtracked, mem
ories have faded, and some of the
old racial antagonisms have reap
peared," said Kennell Jackson, as
sociate professor of History since
1969.
"We're starting to change cer
tain wrongs and a lot of people
resent that," said freshman Nomi
Martin, a BSU member.
However, other factors show
that a majority of students believe
the BSU is an important campus
organization. As evidenced by
ASSU fee assessment statistics,
campus support of the BSU has
grown from refusal of financial
support in 1983, to 67 percent
acceptance in 1987.

"Over the past three years, the
mt\jority of this campus has come
to respect and approve of the
BSU," said Amanda Kemp, 1986-
87 BSU chair.
Lucky Gutierrez, a member of
MEChA, a Chicano-Latino stu
dent organization, said "a lot of

people have trust and confidence
in the BSU."

Assoc. History Prof. Kennell Jackson said the BSU "opens up the
way for debate ... it tells us we can disagree without falling apart."
Shockley, a so-called "race
ologist," to speak at freshman ori
entation as part of a Nobel
Laureate speaker series. Although
his discovery of transistors won
him the award in 1956, the Stan
ford professor is also well-known
for his theory that blacks have
inferior genetic compositions. A
number of angry black and white
students joined the BSU and
vehemently protested the presen
tation.
Although alternative programs
were offered, Shockley spoke at
orientation despite BSU efforts,
Kemp said.
Some people feel actions such
as these reflect an attitude that
has thwarted the progress of the
BSU in the '80s. Lloyd Metz, trea
surer of this year's BSU, acknowl
edged that apathy exists in both
the black and white communities
at Stanford.
In 1986, the BSU expressed its
view of South African apartheid
by building a symbolic shan
tytown in White Plaza as a
reminder of living conditions of
black South Africans. The subse
quent vandalization of the struc
ture on Feb. 9 disappointed mem
bers of the BSU, who saw the act
as a setback for black liberation.
Steve Phillips, 1984-86 BSU
chair, said, "There's an element
of this campus that's opposed to
what we stand for, and an element
in favor, and the largest element
on campus doesn't understand
that much."
The central issue concerning
the BSU now is the Western Cul
ture, or Area One, requirement.
The BSU supports measures that
call for a more diverse curriculum
in that program.
In reference to the BSU's active
role in the Western Culture
debate, Martin said Stanford's
BSU is one of the first black stu
dent organizations to wage a
major battle against university
curriculum. "We are setting a
precedent for challenging the Uni
versity and its perceptions," she
said.
In a May 14, 1986 Campus
Report article, BSU member Da
vid Troutt summarized the argu
ment about Western Culture: "In
(the existing) conception, we are
to believe that Judeo-Christian
culture gave birth to itself without

influences from Asia, from Islam,
from Africa, from Latin America.
Western culture, we are to believe,
had no mother, its few women
didn't write, and what little they
said is not worth repeating."
Phillips added that it "is im
possible to understand this
country as it is without under
standing the experience" of non-
Western cultures.
The BSU has reached a point
where the administration does not
ignore its needs, Martin said. "In
the past, protests have been made,
but the University has taken
them lightly. Now the faculty sen
ate has to vote. It is an issue that
cannot be overlooked," she said.
Although the vote has not been
taken, many are certain that the
requirement will change. Jackson
said, "The first year curriculum
for freshmen students will never
be the same."
However The BSU is not solely
a protest organization. "The BSU
is always viewed as militant,
militant, militant, and that's not
even the case," he said. According
to Metz, the majority of BSU
policy is enacted diplomatically
through quarterly meetings with
University President President
Kennedy, letters to the faculty
senate and petitions.
Kennedy agreed, saying the
BSU has achieved the majority of
its progress "through keeping in
close touch with others and per
suading, rather than through
demonstrations."
Only after these means do not
work does the BSU hold protests,
rallies and sit-ins, Metz said.
Though the BSU has empha
sized political issues this quarter,
it has also provided a variety of
cultural programs. A few of its
yearly events include Kwanzaa, a
fall harvest celebration; Soul Food
Dinners, to be held this year on
Feb. 27; Martin Luther King
week; The Malcolm X Rally May
15; Black Liberation Month in
February; and co-sponsorship of
the ASSU Speaker's Bureau.
According to some BSU mem
bers, those who write off the or
ganization for its all-black student
membership do not understand
the history of oppression of the
black liberation movement. "The
BSU is a watchdog organization
of the black community," ex
plained Kemp. "The black com
munity is organized to fight for

equality and the interests of black
people on this campus. It should
be composed of black students on
ly."
This exclusivity, however, does
not mean that non-blacks are
barred from participating in the
struggle for black equality. "BSU
programs are open to anyone and
can serve the purpose of combit
ing certain ignorance," Phillips
said.
Crucial to the philosophy of the
BSU is the maintenance of a
strong black community and sup
port system to address the con
cerns of its members. "We are
about to reaffirm our goal of

building a greater sense of com
munity within the black com
munity," Metz said. "Mutual sup
port is first and foremost within
the black community."
BSU member Canetta Ivy said
the BSU has "given black stu
dents a more positive view of
themselves."
"Stanford is best when it is ex
pected that we will disagree,"
Jackson said. "The BSU opens up
the way for debate. ... It tells us
we can disagree without falling
apart," he said.
Ivy said, "[The BSU] has shown
me that anything is possible if
you think it is worth fighting for."

Not only a political organization, the BSU also sponsors cultural
programs that are open to the entire campus.
