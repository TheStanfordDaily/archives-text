Editor's note: This is the second
of a two-part article in celebration
of the 20th anniversary of Stan
ford's Black Student Union.

Since the radical 19605, the
focus, tactics and profile of Stan
ford's Black Student Union have
changed along with the political
climate of the University. The
continuing goal of the BSU, as in
the past, is to combat institutional
racism.
"Racism is not just a burning
cross anymore," said Keith Ar
chuleta, 1977-78 BSU chair and
present assistant dean of Student
Affairs. "You have to be able to
see beneath what's ingrained in
our system."
Some think negative public sen
timents have slowed the momen
tum of the BSU in the '80s.
"People have backtracked, mem
ories have faded, and some of the
old racial antagonisms have reap
peared," said Kennell Jackson, as
sociate professor of History since
1969.
"We're starting to change cer
tain wrongs and a lot of people
resent that," said freshman Nomi
Martin, a BSU member.
However, other factors show
that a majority of students believe
the BSU is an important campus
organization. As evidenced by
ASSU fee assessment statistics,
campus support of the BSU has
grown from refusal of financial
support in 1983, to 67 percent
acceptance in 1987.

"Over the past three years, the
mt\jority of this campus has come
to respect and approve of the
BSU," said Amanda Kemp, 1986-
87 BSU chair.
Lucky Gutierrez, a member of
MEChA, a Chicano-Latino stu
dent organization, said "a lot of

people have trust and confidence
in the BSU."

Assoc. History Prof. Kennell Jackson said the BSU "opens up the
way for debate ... it tells us we can disagree without falling apart."
