## Actor throws 'Echoes' for Honors Drama program 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
Senior Michael Alves is one of the
first students to emerge from the Stan
ford Honors Program in Acting, and he
displays his talents and Honors project
starting tonight in a play called "Ec
hoes."
If a student is nominated by the
Drama Department staff for the Honors
in Acting program, he or she is given
two options: either take a main role in
a play on the Drama Department
schedule or select and put together an
original production. Alves chose the lat
ter.
When plans for the Drama Depart
ment play, "Cymbeline," were canceled,
Alves took advantage of the opening in
the schedule and decided to put together
his own production by choosing the play,
the director and most of the people with
whom he would work.

Alves is not only one of the first can
didates to emerge from the young
Honors in Acting program, introduced
by the Drama Department in 1985, but
"Echoes" is the first play to be produced
specifically for an Honors in Acting stu
dent.
"Echoes," written by Richard Nash,
takes place in an asylum where two
men sort through the mysteries of life.
Acting alongside Alves in the play are
senior Albert Oaten and junior
Elizabeth Paris.
"It's interesting because it deals with
the concepts of sanity and insanity,"
Alves said of the play. "It asks what's
the difference between reality and fan
tasy, illusion and delusion. It comments
on how we perceive the world. Do we
daydream all the time? Is it wrong to
live in a dream world?"
For this production, the script has
been adapted by director Andrew Lisac,
who heads Meyer Library's Language

Lab, to include observations on media
images and mortality.
Despite being placed in the potentially
difficult dual role of producer and actor,
Alves said things have gone rather
smoothly.
"I've enjoyed the production end," he
said. "I think one of the things I've
done is to decentralize duties so I can
concentrate more on acting."
Alves will be evaluated by the Drama
Department for his work, but he said
most of the evaluation has taken place
during the pre-production phase so that
everyone can concentrate on giving a
good performance.

"Echoes" will have a preview tonight
at Sp.m. at the Little Theater. Opening
night will be tomorrow and perform
ances will continue at 8 p.m. at the
Little Theater through Saturday. On
Sunday, there will be a 2 p.m. matinee.
Admission is free.
