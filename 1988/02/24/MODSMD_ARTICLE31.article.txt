# Blowing whistle on hoop referees
## 
### 
To T or not to T: that is the
question.
In the Stanford-California
basketball game last Sunday,
two technical fouls were called
on the Cardinal. Coach Mike
Montgomery was whistled for
a T early in the first half, and
Greg Butler was penalized in
the second half for hanging on
the rim after a missed dunk.

Now, technicals have their
time and place. Referees take
enough abuse from college
coaches that they should, at
least, have the technical at
their defense. In fact, there is
nothing quite as crowd
pleasing as an official silencing
Syracuse's Jim Boeheim (or
some equally annoying coach)
with a big T right in his face.
On the other hand, there is
nothing less crowd-pleasing
than a referee stopping the ac
tion to call a technical on a
player for hanging on the rim.

The slam dunk is probably the
single most exciting play in bas
ketball, and the technical has
the effect of prematurely hal
ting this excitement.
Often it is necessary for a
player to grab the rim to regain
his balance. When Sean Elliott
takes off 10 feet from the bas
ket, he is apt to stick his feet
in somebody's throat on the
other side of the basket if he
is not allowed to hang on the
rim to halt his momentum.
Granted, more often than
not the player does not need
to hang on to the rim. But
more often than not he doesn't
need to dunk the ball in the
first place. The point is that
both add to the excitement of
the game. When a player grabs
on to the rim, he is able to flex
his entire body and show the
strength that went into the
slam. In addition, he is able to
extend his moment of glory and
freeze the image of the dunk
in the fans' minds.
The rule is intended to keep
today's bigger and stronger
players from shattering back
boards a la Darryl Dawkins.
However, this is the wrong ap
proach. Why not create an in
destructable backboard? Surely
in this technological age this
could be done.

An interesting sidelight is that,
despite the rule, players appear
to be hanging on the rim more
than ever. And, Butler's infrac
tion not withstanding, they are
getting away with it.
The technical foul for hanging
on the rim has been largely ig
nored much like several other
rules. Seemingly the more players
violate certain rules, the less often
refs make the calls. The most ob
vious example is carrying the ball
over, which, rumor has it, used
to be called back in the Mesozoic
era.
In professional basketball, trav
eling has become the dinosaur of
violations. As one announcer said,
there's so much traveling in the
NBA, they ought to use suitcases
instead of basketballs.
Is basketball moving into an era
where the number of times a call
is made is inversely proportional
to how many times the rule is
violated? If so, just think about
the possibilities. If throwing
chairs becomes fashionable
among coaches, Bobby Knight
may never be whistled for another
T.
