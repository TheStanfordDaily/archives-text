# Card hosts UCSB
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
Certain matches
take on a special
meaning. Often
times those
matches come in
the middle of the
season when a

team that is just starting to meet
its potential is asked to prove it
self against a consistent winner.
Tonight at 6:30 p.m. Stanford vol
leyball fans will have the oppor
tunity to see just such a match
when No. 4 UC-Santa Barbara
rolls into Maples Pavilion to take
on the No. 13 Cardinal.
"This is a match we really want
to win," Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm said. "We're going have to
beat some teams like Santa Bar
bara sometime along the way."
Stanford comes into tonight's
match with a 3-3 record in West
ern Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation play, good enough for
sixth place in the conference. The

Gauchos are tied for third place
with a 4-2 league mark. The top
five WIVA teams will advance to
the Western Regional at the end
of the season, with a chance to
play in the NCAA finals hanging
in the balance.
"Sure, the fact that we're right
on the edge of a postseason berth
is on our minds now and again,"
Sturm said, "but we have to try
and take the matches one at a
time. We are still operating under
the premise of just trying to im
prove our game each time we take
the court."
Stanford comes into the game
having won six of its last seven
matches, with the only loss during
that stretch being a very compet
itive defeat at the hands of league
leading, and second-ranked, USC.
Despite the loss to the Trojans,
the Cardinal has played very good
volleyball over the past three
weeks. The squad has upped its
overall record to 8-9 and solidified
its position in the conference
standings.
