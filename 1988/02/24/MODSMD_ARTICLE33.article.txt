# Men's tennis speeds past San Jose St.
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
What threatened to be a long, drawn
out match was over in seconds yes
terday for the nation's No. 1 ranked
men's tennis team.
Stanford edged San Jose State 8-1
at Stanford Tennis Stadium. The
first three matches Finished (in the

fourth, fifth and sixth slots) went to the Cardinal,
but the other three matches each began with first
set victories for the Spartans. To varying degrees,

the top three Stanford players recovered to win
their matches and help Stanford blank SJSU 6-0
in the singles bracket.
The day's longest and most exciting matches, and
the ones which would determine how pivotal the
doubles play would be, ended within 10 seconds of
each other, when Jeff Tarango served at match
point and won at No. 1 just as the applause for
Patrick McEnroe's win at No. 2 had died down.
"It was looking kind of shaky for a while,"
McEnroe said. "Martin (Blackman) won his second
set pretty easily; it looked like he was kind of
coasting, but Jeff and I both had tough second sets,

too.
Thanks to the performances of the lower three
Cardinal players, a Spartan upset victory never
seemed likely. Barry Richards was the first Cardinal
off the court as he trounced Jeff Peterson 6-3, 6-0.
At No. 4, Glenn Solomon fought off Paul Carbone
6-3, 6-4 in a match of passing shots. Meanwhile,
No. 5 Curtis Dunn found himself in a contest of
groundstrokes with fellow baseliner Gary Peralta.
Dunn almost always took the last shot, though,
winning 6-1, 6-3.
The Tarango-Malcolm Allen match was a heated
affair in which hard-hitting tennis launched infre
quent insurrections and controversy reigned su
preme. Questioned line calls, dropped racquets, cur
sing (in more than one language), and a lot of
discontent all were sprinkled throughout the com
petition (not to mention the high-pitched yelp-grunt
which one of the UC-Santa Barbara women's players
emitted with each shot).

content all were sprinkled

Down 4-1 in the second set, Tar an go came out
of a meditative court change ready to go. The set
reached a tie-breaker, during which Tarango was
up 5-1 before Allen scurried back to 6-6. Tarango
then pounded out two forehands and the set.
In the end, Tarango said, he was able to win the
important points, including the defense of a couple
match point 9.
Meanwhile, Blackman remained undefeated in
dual matches, winning 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 at No. 3. For
McEnroe, his 6-7, 7-5, 6-3 win was not so much a
question of single points, as much as just bringing
his game closer to its potential than it was early
in the match.
I started to play a little bit better towards the
end of the second set," McEnroe said. "I started to
move a little better, but it took me a while to get
going. He played a good match so I'm just happy
that I pulled it out."
