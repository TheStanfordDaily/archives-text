## Step right up for the... Greg Butler Farewell Tour 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Alas, with a mixture of sadness,
pride and goofiness, the Greg But
ler Farewell Tour makes its final
appearances at Stanford this
weekend.
The Force, as his teammates
call him, will pull his careening
caravan of chuckles into Maples
Pavilion for the final two regular
season games of his storied career.

And then Butler, the only
graduating senior on the Stanford
team, will move on to future en
deavors, either in the NBA, the
World Wrestling Federation, or
possibly as Larry "Bud" Melman's
replacement on the David Letter
man Show.
But seriously f01k5....
Indeed, it was often hard to
take Greg Butler seriously during
his first few years on the Farm.
Befuddled Stanford fans won

dered why the gangly 6-foot-11
blond tower shunned the inside
game and instead fired 15- to 18-
foot jump shots with all the arc
of someone spitting gum.
The answer, of course, was that
more often than not Butler made
those shots. And now that during
his senior year the Force has
moved inside and added a jump
hook to his arsenal, everyone is
taking him seriously.
"We've gotten to where on the
bench we look for certain plays
which will make certain Greg
touches the ball," Stanford Asst.
Coach Doug Oliver said. "He has
confidence in himself and now so
do the team and the coaches."
Butler is currently averaging
12.7 points per game and 5.5
rebounds, and although most
media attention is focused on But
ler's teammates Howard Wright
and Todd Lichti, opposing coaches
invariably are concerned about
Butler.
Even before Butler's metamor
phosis was complete, however, his
tour was an institution. Whenever
the team bus pulls into or out of
a city for the last time, one of
Greg's teammates requests a mo
ment of silence to commemorate
this leg of the tour.
"I guess the tour idea started
at halfltime of the Arizona State
game (at Arizona) when Greg al
ready had 22 points and was just
going off," teammate Scott
Meinert said. "Somebody said
that Greg was starting his final
tour with a vengeance."
The happy-go-lucky Butler
doesn't mind the attention. "We
compare it to the Dr. J farewell
tour (last year)," Butler said. "In
every town we wonder what
ceremonies they'll have, whether
they'll give me a rocking chair or
something. I'm still waiting."
The Force's storied career is
made up of, well, stories. During
his tours, Butler has certainly
amassed anecdotes. The one his
teammates automatically remem
ber was not a road trip tale, but
rather a freshman stroll through
Meyer Library.
It seems Butler's frosh buddies
dared him (for an unconfirmed
monetary sum) to do his best im
itation of E.T. as a bookworm. So
Greg donned an extraterrestrial
mask and one other article of
clothing and romped through the
stacks. He collected his dough.
More recently, Butler and team
mate Stuart Thomas, whom But
ler says he is grooming to be the
next Force, wrought destruction
on an Arizona hotel bed.
"Being the big fan of pro wres
tling that I am, well, one time I
was resting when Stu dedided to
perform a flying reverse elbow to
the head," Butler, choosing his

words carefully, said. "At the last
minute I moved and Stu came
down and broke the bed in two.
I pinned him for three."
One other time Butler scared
his teammates when they were
walking through an airport by
suddenly screaming "Sheikh,
Sheikh." The wrestler the Iron
Sheikh happened to be in the
same place, and Butler was lucky
enough to get some grappling tips.
Those wrestling moves may
have helped Butler in his trans
formation from bomber to
bruiser. After two years under ex-
Cardinal Coach Tom Davis, But
ler was forced to move inside last
season by new Head Coach Mike
Montgomery and his staff.

'We compare it to the
Dr. J farewell tour.'

"I wasn't thrilled with (the
move). My production really fell
off, and this year could have been
a disaster," Butler said. "But it
has turned out well. I think in
the end I'm better off having
played inside too."
Butler still thinks of himself as
primarily an outside shooter.
Every day after practice he spends
20 minutes practicing his outside
shot. It may look like a line-drive,
but when you're 6-11, you don't
need to put much arc on your
shot.
"Greg's ability to shoot the ball
away from the hoop allowed him
to play outside like he wanted,"
Stanford Asst. Coach Denny
Houston said. "But you don't
have very many 6-11 guys, and
we needed him to play inside."
So Butler buckled down and
learned how to play with his back
to the basket. Eric Reveno, who
is also a senior but is redshirting
because of back problems and is
a natural inside player, had to go
through the transition to the new
coaching system with Butler.
"It was much harder for Greg.
He had to improve his weaknesses
while I just had to improve my
strengths," Reveno said. "I really
respect what he has done because
it probably wasn't as fun for him."
Fun is one of Butler's favorite
pastimes. Thomas describes him
as a "fun-loving guy" and Reveno
adds that "away from practice
Greg can be the life of the party
— he doesn't mind the attention
he gets from being 6-11."
True to form, the Force, who
reportedly got the nickname be
cause Coach Davis was always
yelling "Don't force it, Greg,"

career this weekend, has mixed strong outside shooting with an
improved inside game this season.
showed off one of his many talents
at the Apple Invitational banquet
in December.
"It was probably one of the
greatest moments of live enter
tainment in Stanford University
history," teammate Scott Meinert
said. "Somebody yelled for Greg
to sing, and (emcee) Bob Murphy
made the mistake of handing Greg
the mike. He reeled off a couple
stanzas of 'You Ain't Nothing But
a Hound Dog.' It was incredible."
Even when Butler's asleep, he
is a threat to leave you in stitches.
"I walk in my sleep some, and
on one road trip I woke up in the
morning and saw the headboard
off the wall," Butler said.
According to legend, Butler
woke up in the middle of the night
and ripped the headboard off the
wall. He then lifted it over his
head and threw it at his room
mate, Andy Fischer.
"If he hadn't been awake and
dodged it, I would have killed
him," Butler said. "You might
want to take some insurance out
when you room with me."
You also might want to hide
any food you have. The Force,
whose other nicknames include
GB, Gree, G-Force, Gorgeous and
G-Bow (for his lethal elbows), can

definitely force down the chow.
"He used to be better, but he's
still quite an eater," Wright said.
The story goes that in one res
taurant on a road trip in Austin,
Texas, the waiter brought the raw
steaks out for the patrons to
choose. Butler chose a two
pounder. He did finish it, but he
may still be digesting it.
Once GB takes his final farewell
bows and finishes eating, he
would like to move on to a more
professional tour, either in Eu
rope or preferably in the NBA.
"I guess Marty Blake (NBA su
perscout) is pretty high on my
future in the NBA," Butler said.
"That's nice to hear, but I'm just
going to go to camps and work
hard this summer."
Butler's chances may be better
than some people think. There
are not many 6-11 players who
can shoot that well from the
perimeter.
"That's why I originally fought
the idea of playing inside," Butler
said. "Playing outside was the one
thing that set me apart."
Wright thinks the Force can do
it. "You look at some of the pros
in the NBA and compare, and
with the right coach at the right
time with the right team, Greg
can make it."
Seriously, folks, Greg Butler in
the NBA. Now that would be a
tour.
