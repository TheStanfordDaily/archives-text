# Golfers ditch for Hawaii

### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
Pity the Stanford men's golf team.
While most students will enjoy a
week of classes here on campus,
Wally Goodwin's squad will trudge
across the Pacific to compete in
the 12th-annual John Burns invi
tational. The three-day, 54-hole

tournament will be played at the Kaneohe Klipper
Golf Course on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.
The team will have its work cut out for it
coming off its first victory in two years. Coach
Goodwin called this week's field "by far the tough
est we have played all year." Of 26 teams par
ticipating in the tournament, seven are nationally
ranked, including defending national champion
Oklahoma.
Individually, the field contains some of the
nation's top collegiate golfers. With stars such
as Arizona State's Bill Mayfair, the current U.S.
Amateur champion, the five Stanford golfers will
have to play great golf to stay in the running.
It may not be easy for the Cardinal to do so.
The tournament comes at a bad time for the
team, which had to practice and qualify in the
midst of midterms. As a result, many of the
players could not devote enough time to the game
and qualifying scores were high. The five players
that emerged from the exhausting 54-hole
qualifier were sophomores Mark Funseth, Mike

Hubly, Brad Joondeph, and Chris Weyand and
junior John Mahon.
Funseth and Hubly have emerged as the hot
golfers for Stanford. Both fired an even-par 71
at the Stanford Golf Course Saturday to qualify
for the tournament. Funseth is coming off an
individual victory in the UC-Davis Invitational
two weeks ago in Napa, while Hubly continues
to delight Goodwin with his fine play and hard
work in practice. After finishing second among
Stanford golfers in the Napa tournament, Good
win expects Hubly to continue to contend for a
top spot.
Goodwin does not expect the Cardinal to be
among the top finishers in Hawaii. "If we finish
anywhere between 12th and 15th (in a field of
26) I'll be thrilled," he said last week. His goal
is to beat teams such as Fresno State and San
Jose State, which the Cardinal will have to do
in order to reach the NCAA championships in
May. The last time Stanford and Fresno State
faced each other in Santa Barbara, the Cardinal
golfers were beaten by a single, heartbreaking
stroke.
To make sure his players will be in top form,
Goodwin took them to Honolulu on Sunday so
they could recover from jet lag and play two
practice rounds before the tournament begins on
Wednesday. If they can continue their winning
ways from the last tournament, the golfers could
enjoy a good finish in the tournament as well
as a Hawaiian vacation.
