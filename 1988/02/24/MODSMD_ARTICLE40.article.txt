# Arabs, Israelis at 'turning point'
## Reserve colonel says there is great opportunity for negotiation 
### Amy Rosenfeld 
Arabs and Israelis in the
Middle East are at "a new turn
ing point" in their relationship
and should seize the opportunity
to negotiate, according to an Is
raeli reserve soldier recently
returned from fighting in the
Gaza Strip.
Roni Trainin, a reserve
colonel, spoke to a group of 30
students and faculty yesterday
at Alpha Sigma House about the
current Middle East situation.
Trainin is also director of Is
rael's Givat Haviva Institute, an
educational organization dedi
cated to the teaching and study
of Middle East history, culture
and politics.
The fighting this time is "not
the same as it has happened in
the past," Trainin said. For the
first time, he said, Israel is fight
ing Palestinian civilians in the
Gaza Strip rather than a specific
Arab State. "It is a civil war, I
don't know what else to call it."
Discussing recent actions by
Israeli soldiers in both the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank,
Trainin called the situation
"very complicated," basing the
observation on his experiences
as a battalion commander in
Gaza last December.
For example, Trainin said, sol
diers often have to enter an Arab

house where three large families
are sharing one small room
(60,000 people live in less than
one square mile in Jibalia, the
largest refugee camp in Gaza).
If the inhabitants grab him, "I
have to give the soldier orders
(so) that he can survive (and)
defend himself," he said.
There is "not any military so
lution for the whole situation in
the Middle East or the situation
in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip," Trainin said, stressing
the highly political nature of the
conflict. Rather, Israelis and
Arabs should begin negotiations
to establish a "new framework
in the Middle East."
Such negotiations could begin
with the Camp David agreement,
which Trainin called "very
logical."
Trainin said he was hopeful
an agreement could be reached
even with the new, younger Pal
estinian leadership. "If you're
beginning any political negotia
tions, it will change the atmos
phere," reduce tensions and give
a "hint of hope to the Pales
tinians," he said.
As part of his role at the Givat
Haviva Institute, Trainin is
working on a program designed
to bring Arab and Jewish
teenagers together in order to
"create a framework of coexist

ence among Israeli citizens,"
Trainin said. "They are not
going to convince each other, but
they are going to listen, to un
derstand."
The program has been highly
successful, Trainin said. Only
three weeks ago, some Israeli-
Jewish teenagers went to visit
Arab teens in Arab territories.

Bringing the young people to
gether is a good start, he said
adding that "If we want to
change, we have to use educa
tion, or the first time an Israeli
teenager meets an Arab one will
be in the battlefield, with a gun."
Trainin's visit was part of an
ongoing series of programs spon
sored by Hillel.
