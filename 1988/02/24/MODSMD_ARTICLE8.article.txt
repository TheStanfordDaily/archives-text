# Lyons slams residential frats
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
Residential fraternity members are
damaging themselves by projecting the
image that fraternities are clubs for
white rich kids, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons told the ASSU Senate last
night.
As he outlined issues raised by the
recently released task force report on
fraternities and sororities, Lyons en
couraged senators to find out how their
constituents feel about the issues raised
by the report.
In other business, the senate voted
unanimously to override the Council of
Presidents' veto two weeks ago of the
senate's ASSU fee assessment recom
mendations bill — at the request of
COP member Jim Durkin, who had
originally prompted the veto.
The senate also approved 18-1 a pro
posal to place a commencement pledge
on the spring ballot for student consid
eration. The pledge asks that graduating

students consider environmental and
social concerns when evaluating job of
fers.
Addressing fraternity issues, Lyons
said he hoped students and administra
tion would work together to establish
a definitive fraternity policy by the end
of spring quarter.
Responding to a question from
Durkin, Lyons called wet Rush "the
height of stupidity." He said the Inter
fraternity Council will certainly patrol
this spring's Rush, but he cautioned
that Stanford needs to develop a sense
of collective responsibility.
Lyons pointed out that Cowell Stu
dent Health Center is developing an
alcohol education program, and he
predicted it would be "the best in the
country."
Addressing a familiar concern, Lyons
acknowledged that there is a crunch in
student office space, but offered no con
crete suggestions to solve the Droblem.
In its session, the senate voted to
override two COP vetoes: one the special

fee assessment recommendations; and
another of the transfer of $500 to the
senate's discretionary fund.
Durkin called the vetoes "a learning
process for the COP." He said the COP
members should have communicated
better among themselves and to the
senate as a whole.
Durkin added, though, that future
senate bills should be well-researched
and well-presented. At the last meeting,
the COP had vetoed the special fee rec
ommendations bill because the Appro
priations Committee did not spell out
in writing the reasoning behind
its recommendations.
A bill introduced by graduate
Senator Richard Vaughan propos
ing to eliminate spring campaign
publicity funds from the budgets

of the Stanford Latino Student
Alliance, the Black Student Union
and the Graduate Student Asso
ciation was withdrawn.
Many senators argued that
other organizations used their
general publicity funds for the
spring campaign and that SaLSA,
the BSU and the GSA should not
be penalized just because they
outlined their budgets in greater
detail.
