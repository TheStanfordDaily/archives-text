# Students to vote on job pledge
## Graduating seniors may scrutinize employment opportunities 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
"I pledge to investigate the environ
mental and social consequences of any
job opportunity that I consider."
So reads the pledge of the non
partisan Graduate Pledge Alliance, a co
alition of 18 Stanford-area groups,
among them Stanford Action for Nu
clear Disarmament, Beyond War, the
Graduate Student Association and Stu
dents United for a Democratic Educa
tion. The coalition hopes students will
sign the pledge before they leave Stan
ford for the "real world."
Last night, the ASSU Senate voted
to place on the spring ballot a resolution
giving seniors the opportunity to sign
the pledge sometime during Commence
ment weekend, which begins June 11.
"The coalition would like to see the
pledge institutionalized as part of the
graduation ceremony," said Diane

Honigberg, organizational coordinator
of the group.
Honigberg said she hopes other stu
dent groups will join the coalition.
In a report to the senate, Honigberg,
a coterminal student in psychology and
education, called the pledge an "oath
of conscience." The pledge is personal
and voluntary, Honigberg said. "What
is good or bad is left for the individual
to decide."
According to Honigberg, the main
purpose of the pledge is to raise
students' awareness about the need for
social responsibility.
The pledge mirrors an action by stu
dents last year at Humboldt State Uni
versity, the first U.S. university to offer
students the opportunity to sign a social
and environmental pledge.
Stanford alumnus Matthew
Nicodemus, who taught at Humboldt
State last year, was one of the driving
forces behind the pledge effort there.

Nicodemus graduated from Stanford
with a bachelor's in philosphy in 1982
and developed a SWOPSI course the
next year called "Military Funding for
Research at Stanford." He said he talked
with students about the idea of institut
ing such a pledge even then.
Nicodemus' course covered a variety
of topics, including the need for social
responsibility among scientists. In 1986,
Nicodemus moved to Humboldt State
and taught a similar course.
At Humboldt State, some students
expressed interest in drafting a student
pledge for social responsibility,
Nicodemus said. An "ad-hoc" group
formed, a pledge was drafted and, in
April 1987, students at Humboldt State
voted in favor of the making the pledge
part of their commencement ceremo
nies.
Humboldt's pledge grew out of these
events, and Nicodemus said 50 other
schools are considering instituting a so
cial responsibility pledge.
