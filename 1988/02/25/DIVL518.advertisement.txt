Hey Hey, Ho Ho,
Western Culture's Gotta Go
I Icy I Icy. ho ho. Western culture's gotta go." they're chanting
out at Stanford, where leftist protestors are intent on replacing the
university's required course in Western Culture. The course
introduces freshmen to 15 acknowledged classics of Western
thought from Plato to Mill, but ... yes ... is saturated with
"European-Western and male bias" and "sexist and racist
stereotypes." The protestors want to substitute another course
that would include a non Western culture and "works by women,
minorities, and persons of color."
Talk about cmdc stereotyping. To see in the Bible. Dante, and
Nietzsche nothing but a single perspective—filed under White
Male—is about as far as you can go in coarse rcductlonism. The
comical piirt Is that the purge is being conducted in the name of
"diversity" —a monotonous slogan for current leftist
provincialism. The protestors haven't even found the authors
they're going to replace Augustine and the boys with, all they
know Is that they'll Include lots of women and minorities. That's
reall intellectual catholicity, man.
Actually. Stanford seems to be groaning under the Intellectual
tyranny of one overrepresented white male: Karl Marx. The
genuine diversity of the Western Culture course Is apparently
more than the Left can handle.
