# Decision on frat housing due soon
## 
### Glen Tripp Staff writer 
The University will decide
before the end of the year
whether subjective selection for
membership in housed fraterni
ties will continue, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons said
last night.
Attending a meeting of the In
terfraternity Council to address
fraternity concerns regarding
the recently released task force
report on fraternities, Lyons
said, "I don't want to go through
this every year. I want to get
this solved before the end of this
year."
The report, released Feb. 16
by a task force Lyons appointed
four years ago, calls for an end
to allowing housed fraternities
subjective control over who lives
in fraternal housing.
In an effort to ensure dialogue
between his office and the IFC,
Lyons told the 30 fraternity rep
resentatives present that he
wants discussion over the issue
to be "friendly."
"The worst thing that can
happen is for the debate to be

come too polarized," Lyons said.
Several IFC members said
they oppose making the frater
nal selection process objective.
One fraternity member stated
that subjective selection is ne
cessary, saying the system "finds
people who get along and who
will contribute" to their respec
tive fraternities.
Lyons said he is unsure
whether an objective process
could be implemented. "I have
an honest question in how far

a fraternal organization can go
in becoming objective," he said,
stressing that the question will
be addressed in forthcoming
policy discussions.
At the meeting, Lyons also
urged the IFC to reconsider
having a dry rush, saying that
serving alcohol during Rush is
"stupid" and "risky." After
Lyons made his point, IFC Pres
ident Vinny Frost said the IFC
would reopen the issue at its
meeting next Wednesday, but it

is unlikely to reverse its decision
against a dry rush.
The IFC soundly defeated a
proposal by one of its subcom
mittees to ban alcohol from
Rush in a 15-4 vote Jan. 27.
Lyons announced the next day
that the University might inter
vene and require a dry
nevertheless. But xast night,
Lyons said he would accept the
IFC's decision.
Still, Lyons said, "My opinion
is no secret.

should remain friendly at last night's IFC meeting.
