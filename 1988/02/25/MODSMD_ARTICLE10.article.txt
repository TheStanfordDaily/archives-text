# Expert on agriculture:
## World needs farming system 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
Creating a self-sustaining
world agricultural system is so
vital that "if we fail, then we
perish," an agriculture expert
said here last night.
Jerry Moles, director of the
NeoSynthesis Research Centre
in Mirahawatte, Sri Lanka, ad
dressing a small audience in
Kresge Auditorium, advocated
the creation of self-sufficient
agricultural systems worldwide.
Moles, who received a Stan
ford doctorate in 1972, defines
sustainable agriculture as "cre
ating an agricultural system
using local resources and solar
energy."
He criticized industrialized
nations' aid to underdevelpoed
countries, saying, "We have to
ask ourselves, is it not a disser
vice to give them a technologi
cally based system which they
can't afford?"
Instead he suggested teaching
those nations how to export the
exotic foods they could get "piles
of money for." He listed the pos

sible "yuppie" foods of the near
future. Delicacies such as man
gostein, rambutan and fishtail
palm tree sugar could command
a high price here, he said.
Perhaps even more important
are medicinal plants, he said.
Sometimes they work just as
well as synthetic medicines "and
with far fewer side effects," he
said.
The Sri Lankan center has
had great success in cultivating
a plant called vincarosea, which
has been shown effective in
combatting childhood leukemia.
Currently, he explained,
much fossil fuel is wasted in
transporting and managing
agriculture. "Just how expen
sive is our agriculture in terms
of energy? ... An estimated 16.5
percent of the fossil fuels used
in the United States goes di
rectly to our food system," he
said.
Topsoil erosion is the
problem plaguing the country
agriculturally, due to the razing
of traditional vegetation in favor
of tea plantations and other
crops.

Moles began work in Sri
Lanka in 1981 to help the
country recover from soil dev
astation incurred by British
teagrowers and to do research
there on agricultural systems.
Moles' talk was part of the
lecture series "Conservation
and Sustainability," sponsored
by Students for Environmental
Awareness and Sustainability, a
new organization on campus.
The group was formed, accord
ing to treasurer Robert Abrams,
"to make Stanford an ecologi
cally viable place to live."
"If we control our own
resource use, then that will have
a substantial impact beyond the
campus," he said.
Abrams said some of the up
coming events sponsored by the
group include a "Resource
Month" in April, an ecological
pen-pal program and the plant
ing of oak trees in the Foothills.
He also said that due to suc
cessful lobbying by the organi
zation, next year's "You Can
Make a Difference" program
will focus on ecology.
