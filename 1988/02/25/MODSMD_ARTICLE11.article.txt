Court ruling protects satire
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court
ruled unanimously yesterday that public fig
ures who are the victims of a satirical attack
— even one that is pornographic and "outra
geous" — may not sue for damages, and it
rejected a $200,000 judgment won by the Rev.
Jerry Falwell against Hustler magazine.
Satire and parodies of public figures are
protected by the free speech provisions of the
First Amendment, the court declared, bolster
ing other court precedents that severely limit
legal action by well-known figures over public
criticism.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, writing for
the court, cited the nation's long tradition of
permitting critics to lampoon politicians in
print and in speech without fear of legal
reprisals.
"Were we to hold otherwise (in this case),
there can be little doubt that political car
toonists and satirists would be subjected to
damage awards without any showing that their
work falsely defamed its subject," Rehnquist
said.
The decision threw out a lower court ruling
that had upheld damages for the religious
leader based on the "emotional distress" that
he said he had suffered from a sexually graphic
satire of him in the magazine.
Anti-drug program called for
WASHINGTON — In the first of a series
of recommendations for building a national
AIDS strategy, the chairman of the presiden
tial AIDS commission yesterday proposed a
dramatic expansion of drug abuse programs
to provide anti-drug addiction treatment to all
intravenous users who seek it.
Saying that intravenous drug users pose
"the greatest long-term potential for spreading
the AIDS virus," Adm. James Watkins called
for a 10-year program starting with an annual
minimum increase of $2 billion to establish a
system that "can accommodate a treatment-on
demand-response" for them.
"The future course of the (AIDS) epidemic
depends greatly on the effectiveness of our
nation's ability to address IV drug abuse," he
said.
Currently, many intravenous drug addicts
do not receive help in breaking their habits
because of overcrowding and inadequate fund
ing of drug treatment programs. Sharing of
contaminated needles is among the forma of
transmission of the AIDS virus.
Watkins also called for increased AIDS ed
ucation for health care providers, more funding
for community-based health care services for
AIDS patients, and an acceleration in certain
areas of basic research and drug development.
Watkins dismissed expected criticism of the
proposals, saying: "It really is not in our
charter to worry about the political impact."
Korean president takes office
SEOUL, South Korea — Taking over in the
first peaceful and democratic transfer of power
in Korean history, President Roh Tae Woo
assured his citizens yesterday that economic
growth and military security would no longer
be used as excuses to thwart democracy in
South Korea.
"The day when freedoms and human rights
could be slighted in the name of economic
growth and national security has ended. The
day when repressive force and torture in secret
chambers were tolerated is over," the new
president declared at his inauguration for a
five-year term.
Roh, 55, spoke in often inspirational terms,
painting a picture of more prosperity and full
democracy for a nation "which grew up in
poverty and war." South Korea, he said, is
now preparing to join "the ranks of the ad
vanced democratic countries before the 20th
century is over."
He spoke outdoors, in front of the National
Assembly building, before a crowd of 24,000
invited guests, including Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita of Japan and U.S. Secretary
of Treasury James Baker 111.
