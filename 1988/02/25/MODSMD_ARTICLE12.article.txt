# Reagan defends his administration

WASHINGTON - President
Reagan struck back yesterday at critics
who say an influence-peddling inves
tigation centering on Attorney General
Edwin Meese 111 underscores lax eth
ical standards in the White House,
saying his administration has been
"been smeared nationwide" by un
founded charges and "guilt by accusa
tion."
The president, speaking at his first
news conference in four months, said
he has "every confidence" in the in
tegrity of Meese, now the subject of
at least three separate independent
counsel investigations in the last seven
years.
"There is a kind of lynch mob at
mosphere," Reagan said, in which ac
cusations against government officials
are widely reported but are without
substantiation.

Meese, the nation's ranking law en
forcement officer, has been investi
gated for his financial dealings and
for his role in the award of a Pentagon
contract to scandal-ridden Wedtech
Corp., a small Bronx defense company.
His involvement in a controversial
Iraqi pipeline project, however, has led
to the most serious probe of the at
torney general thus far.
In other press conference highlights,
Reagan:
• Maintained that rioting by Pales
tinians in the Israeli-occuped West
Bank and Gaza Strip over the past
two months was instigated by "out
siders," whom he declined to name.
"We have had intimations that there
have been certain people suspected of
being terrorists, outsiders, coming in,
not only with weapons, but stirring
up and encouraging in those areas."

• Insisted that the austere fiscal
1989 defense budget that he submitted
to Congress earlier this month does
not pose a threat to the national se
curity.
• Offered the opinion that South
Africa's policy of racial apartheid "is
a tribal policy more than it is a racial
policy."
In defending the ethical conduct by
officials of his administration, Reagan
said: "No attention is paid to the fact
of how many of them, when it actually
came to trial, are found to be totally
innocent."
He cited the cases of former Secre
tary of Labor Raymond Donovan and
former NASA Administrator James
Beggs, both of whom were acquitted
of criminal charges.
Reagan made no mention of his
former close aides Michael Deaver and

Lynn Nofziger, who were more re
cently convicted on criminal charges.
Asked about another administration
scandal, Reagan insisted that Vice
President George Bush did express
reservations about the adminis
tration's secret arms sales to Iran in
1985 and 1986, but he refused to pro
vide any details.
"Yes, there were reservations, but
I'm not going to go into them, just as
he wouldn't go into the private dis
cussions that we may have had,"
Reagan said.
Bush has said that he expressed un
specified "reservations" about the
deals, but other officials, including
Secretary of State George Shultz, have
said that the vice president argued in
favor of the arms sales.
