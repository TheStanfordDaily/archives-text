# House Democrats delay Contra aid vote
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Faced with a
growing rebellion by party liberals,
Democratic congressional leaders yes
terday abruptly postponed a show
down vote scheduled for today on their
plan to provide humanitarian aid, but
no further military support, for the
Nicaraguan Contras.
While party leaders predicted victory
for their proposal when it does come
up for a vote — presumably next week
— the decision to delay represents at
least a temporary political setback to
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas,
who has sought to play an unusually
aggressive role in shaping U.S. policy
in Central America.
Democrats conceded that, despite in
tensive efforts by Wright and his
lieutenants to put together a majority,
they do not now have enough support
to ensure passage of the controversial

plan, which would distribute $30 mil
lion in food, medicine and clothing to
the rebels.
"We have a lot of members who felt
that we were forcing this to a vote
. . . they felt this was unfair, that we
were ramming it too much," said Rep.
Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the House
Majority Whip.
"There's been no erosion, but people
feel they need more time to study this
issue," he said. Wright has staked
much of his prestige on the plan, which
he has argued would further the peace
process in Central America.
President Reagan, meanwhile, said
in his news conference Wednesday
night that he would accept the Wright
plan for non-military aid because it
will keep the Contras in the battlefield,
and give the administration an oppor
tunity seek renewed military aid from

Congress later.
"Anything that will keep the
freedom fighters as a pressure on the
Sandinistas is worth doing," Reagan
said.
"When we tried to pass our own bill
and narrowly failed, you could see that
the military aid was down the road a
ways — it was not necessary right
now," he said. "The other aid, human
itarian aid is more imminent. And so
if we can get that, that's fine, and
we'll take our chances on the other,
trying to get it."
He added that the Contras still have
military supplies "for a limited period
of time."
Reagan said that he has noted some
progress toward democracy in
Nicaragua, but credited the Contras
for pressuring the leftist Managua
regime into reform.

"In the past several months there
have been some limited steps taken
by the communist regime in Nicaragua
toward reform," he said. "Now is not
the time to reverse that process."
The Democrats' bombshell-decision
to back away from an immediate vote
capped a day in which Reagan and
Republicans unveiled their own plan
to provide non-lethal aid to the Con
tras, and both sides mounted furious,
last-minute lobbying campaigns to
round up votes.
Earlier in the day, Democratic
leaders had confidently said that they
had enough support to win, certainly
by more than the 219-211 margin by
which they defeated Reagan's bid for
military aid to the rebels on Feb. 3.
