# Senator arrested in filibuster squabble
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Sen. Bob Packwood,
R-Ore., was arrested by Senate police in
the wee hours of yesterday morning to
force him to attend a Senate session, but
he was in good humor after the incident,
joking: "I rather enjoyed it. I instructed
four of my staff to get a sedan chair."
Other Republicans, however, bridled at
the arrest, which took place as Democratic
and Republican lawmakers staged a lengthy
fight over legislation that would limit
spending on congressional elections. Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said that the action
made the chamber look like "a banana
republic."
The incident — during which Packwood
was actually carried into the Senate cham
ber by Sergeant-at-Arms Henry Giugni —
highlighted the unusual intensity of the
fight over the bill. Although Senate rules
allow the sergeant-at-arms to compel ab
sent members to attend sessions, it was

the first time the procedure had been used
since a 1942 filibuster over civil rights.
Senate leaders plan to vote Friday in an
attempt to end Republican stalling tactics,
but their strategists concede that campaign
finance reform is probably dead for the
rest of the year. Supporters of the bill
vowed yesterday to try to make it an elec
tion issue in the fall.
As Senate aides began bringing cots into
the cloakrooms behind the chamber late
Tuesday night, Republicans walked out in
an attempt to deprive the Senate of a
quorum and thereby shut down the cham
ber for the night. Democrats responded by
voting, 45-3, to order the Senate police to
search out missing members and compel
them to attend.
Armed with arrest warrants for all 46
Republicans, Giugni and his men began to
search the corridors of the Capitol.
