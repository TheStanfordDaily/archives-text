# Arabs lynch villager
## Man was suspected Israeli collaborator 
### 
JERUSALEM â€” Palestinian
villagers in the occupied West
Bank yesterday lynched an Arab
man accused of collaborating with
Israeli security forces after he
shot dead a 4-year-old boy and
wounded at least 13 others when
he came under attack for trying
to break up an anti-Israeli protest.
The incident, which took place
in Qabatiya, 15 miles north of
Nablus, marked the first killing
of an alleged "traitor" since the
Palestinian uprising began in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip 11
weeks ago. Israeli military sources
said they feared the death could
open a new phase of "settling ac
counts" against Palestinians who
either cooperate with Israel or

refuse to honor the strikes and
boycotts ordered by leaders of the
uprising.
Details of the incident were still
sketchy last night, but the Army
confirmed the killings of both the
child and the alleged collaborator,
identified by news services as
Mohammed Ayad.
Army and Palestinian sources
agreed that the incident began
yesterday morning when hun
dreds of Palestinians began a
protest march through the village,
scene of several violent clashes
between soldiers and stone
throwers in recent weeks.
Witnesses said the crowd
chased the man back to his house.
