JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -
The South African government, taking
steps yesterday that are among the
toughest yet against opponents of
minority white rule, prohibited political
activity by the United Democratic Front,
the country's largest anti-apartheid
group, and the Congress of South
African Trade Unions, the biggest labor
federation.
Adriaan Vlok, the minister of law and
order, acting with greatly increased au
thority under the country's state of
emergency, also forbade such activities
by 16 other groups and banned at least
18 leading black activists from par
ticipating in any political activity and
placed them under effective house ar
rest.
Among those affected are the United

Democratic Front's two co-presidents,
Archie Gumede and Albertina Sisulu,
both veterans of the anti-apartheid
movement with close ties to the out
lawed African National Congress.
"The government, as far as we are
concerned, is declaring war on the people
of South Africa," Sisulu said. "The UDF
and its affiliates ... will definitely chal
lenge this ban with all our political and
legal resources. . . . Nothing is going to
stop the people. Nothing is going to stop
the struggle against apartheid. The gov
ernment should know that by now. The
struggle is on."
The anti-apartheid opposition has con
tinued to grow despite the state of emer
gency, Vlok said.
