## Fund languages 
### 
THE UNIVERSITY'S CUT of
foreign language department
funds reinforces many un
dergraduates' belief here that they
are at the bottom of a long list of
priorities.
Despite an increase in demand
for foreign language classes, this
year the budget for lecturer
salaries was cut and the number
of students in each section was
increased.
To learn any language properly,
students must be able to actively
participate in classroom conversa
tion. Most educators agree that
language proficiency is most effi
ciently reached in classes of about
a dozen students.
However, some University lan
guage departments are offering
classes of up to 25 students —
double the desired number. Several
foreign language professors here
have said on the record that in
classes of this size they are inca
pable of adequately evaluating stu
dents' speaking capabilities and
therefore are not meeting their ob
jectives as teachers. There is
definitely a problem.
According to the figures from
the Registrar's Office, over 20 per
cent of Stanford's undergraduates
will take foreign language classes
this year. That number is likely to
continue to rise.
Far more students are required
to take foreign language classes
than just those majoring in a
foreign language. International re
lations majors, for example, are re
quired to take two years of a

foreign language. Those seeking
history or English degrees are re
quired to take four quarters.
The popularity of some of these
majors is going up. For example,
only four years ago there were 134
students majoring in IR; this year
there are 260 — double and still
growing. Consequently, the num
ber of students required to take
foreign language classes is rising.
In addition, the University is ac
tively pushing and expanding its
overseas campuses, which also
equates to more students wanting
to learn foreign languages.
If the Provost's Office does not
care about broadening students'
educations, let's re-evaluate the
Provost's poor judgment call in a
language it understands well —
money. All those students planning
careers in international business,
law, education and health, for ex
ample, know that their success in
ternationally requires good com
munication skills. And doesn't
Stanford want its students to be
successful?
It's horrible to argue that
foreign language classes should be
smaller because alumni donations
to the University will be larger.
But if that's the argument it takes
to get more funding for foreign
language departments, so be it.
The demand for foreign lan
guage classes has increased and
the supply has decreased. Faculty
members are not happy and stu
dents are not learning. What lan
guage must be used for the Uni
versity to understand that some
thing is very wrong?
