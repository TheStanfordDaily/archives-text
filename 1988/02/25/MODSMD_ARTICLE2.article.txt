# Uncertain future of Arias plan may have hastened law award
## 
### Brooke Harrington Staff writer 
The expected breakdown of the
Arias Central American peace
plan may have precipitated the
Law School's decision to award
the Ralston Prize to Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias Sanchez
this year, said the coordinator of
the Latin American Studies pro
gram yesterday.
Upon hearing of Arias' Ralston
Prize nomination, Latin American
Studies Coordinator Sharon Phil
lipps said she believed the Law
School "would have to give it to"
him soon, because the chances of
his peace plan succeeding are min
imal as long as the Contras know
that they will continue to receive
support."
Members of the Ralston Prize
selection committee, however,
stood behind their decision to
honor Arias in spite of the diffi
culties his plan faces.
Law Prof. William Gould, who
chaired the award committee, said
the committee was under no time
constraints because of the rapid
deterioration of peace prospects
in the region.
"Whether the plan works or
not, Arias made a substantial con
tribution to the rule of law,"
Gould said.
Trustee Melvin Lane, who
carried the news of the nomina

tion to Arias, also focused on
Arias' well-intentioned effort
rather than the actual outcome
of the peace plan.
A panel of Law School profes
sors awarded the 1987 Nobel
Peace Prize recipient the Ralston
Prize on Feb. 16. The Ralston
Prize, unlike the annually
awarded Nobel, is only bestowed
in cases of special merit.
The prize, which constitutes a
$30,000 grant in return for a
public lecture at Stanford some
time during the 1988-89 academic
year, recognizes "original and dis
tinguished contribution by a man
or woman to the development of
the role of law in international
relations."
The Arias peace plan for Cen
tral America was the first such
agreement to be accepted by all
five heads of state in the region,
including Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega Saavedra. The plan
was initially hailed for its efforts
to bring peace to the troubled
region through a cease-fire, free
elections and steps toward
cooperation and development.
Reports from the region, how
ever, suggest that the success of
the plan is in jeopardy. The New
York Times reported recently a
breakdown of negotiations be
tween the Sandinista government,
led by Ortega, and the U.S.-
backed Contras.
