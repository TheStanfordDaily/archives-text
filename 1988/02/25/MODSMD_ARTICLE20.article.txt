## Olympics find Farm 
### 
WITH ALL THE UPROAR about
the winter Olympics it seems
only fitting for all of us at Stan
ford to join in the five ring festivities.
After all, what better way for intellectual
giants on the Farm to demonstrate their
Olympian stature than to participate in
these events peculiar, and I do mean
peculiar, to Stanford.
Picture the opening ceremonies of
Stanford's Olympics. With XTV covering
the most colorful event of the season,
we'd naturally see the illustrious Band
with their pants up for the occasion, ac
companying University President Donald
Kennedy's opening speech. Thoughts of
world peace and happiness would pervade
the atmosphere, and thousands of Car
dinal coated fans would for at least a
moment feel compassion for the Weenies,
their pathetic comrades in arms,.
After much spectacle, spectators would
be treated to the following events:
Defensive Biking Event. Participants
don their safety helmets (brass knuckles
optional) for one hellish experience. This
event can only be held during heavy rains
and high winds. For maximum biking
exhilaration, it is scheduled to begin at
the "Intersection of Death" by the clock
tower, during peak traffic. Manholes, bol
lards, newspaper reading pedestrians and
palm trees are among the highest point
value targets.
Midterm Marathon. No pre-requisites
are necessary for this one — everyone
participates. Points are awarded not for

performance, but survival. After five days
of intense cerebration, participants who
look and feel most like sunken-eyed, an
tisocial zombies win — the Jordan
Scholar Distinction. And don't worry, if
you fail this event, the Registrar simply
wipes it off your scoreboard.
Hoover Tower Parachute Jumping.
This event, sponsored by the campus
right wing contingency, involves leaping
from the heights of Hoo-Tow. Partici
pants play a dual role — not only do
they test their wind-borne capabilities,
they also serve as practice detection tar
gets for Edward Teller's Star Wars toys.
Weight Lifting Competition. It takes
place at the Bookstore. Contestants are
given little red baskets as lifting aids.
Winners are those with circulation in
their arms when they reach the checkout
counter with the quarter's textbooks. Ex
tra points awarded for a Western Culture
or human biology courseload.
Flicks Shotput. Prizes awarded for
largest paper wad/airplane thrown onto
Memorial Auditorium stage.
Claw Climbing. First person to impale
a stuffed bear on the top of the Claw
wins a genuine life sized Weenie.
The All-Nighter. Skill measured by
weeks of notes studied per pizza and
heart palpitations due to caffeine con
sumed. This event is to be held in con
junction with it's antithesis — The Sleep
Marathon. It's open to undergrads and
grads alike and will be held in Green
library. Contestants must supply their

own sleep aids: studying materials.
The Library Dash. This 100 yard dash
from street lamp to street lamp is open
to all women returning from Meyer after
midnight.
Food Service Relay. Team members
race for spots in the lunch line, attempt
to exit kitchen with as many plates as
possible and tackle diners to find places
to sit. Extra points for escaping from the
line with two or more entrees and eating
either of them.
Publish or Perish. This event is open
to Stanford faculty. Professors must
publish in the academic journal of their
field. Winners are awarded tenure; others
leave for Berkeley.
The Dating Game. Event cancelled due
to lack of participation.
So much for a sampling of the Stanford
Games. While we can't all be like Debi
Thomas and participate in this year's
Olympics, considering the showing that
the United States is making, it's probably
more interesting to imagine Olympics on
the Farm anyway.
