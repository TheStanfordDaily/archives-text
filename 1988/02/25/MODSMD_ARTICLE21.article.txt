## Grape boycott Should Stanford play a role in the grape boycott? 
###

Writing in favor of the
boycott, I urge you to re
member the focus of the
issue.
In the farming indus
try today, millions of
pounds of pesticides are

used to increase productivity. At first,
these pesticides were thought of as a
miracle of science.
Today, they are responsible for the
unexplainably high rates of cancer and
birth defects in several farming com
munities.
Farmworkers are among those with
the lowest life expectancy rates in this
nation. Moreover, their average income
is far less than what is required today
for a comfortable living.
The powers' information packet
brags about some farm workers who
make $5 to $7 per hour. Working full
time to put food on your table, a lucky
farmworker laboring in the hot sun,
surrounded by dangerous chemicals
and living in cancer clusters can earn,
in the top ranges, $10,000 to $14,000
per year.
This certainly is not fair compensa
tion for the high risk of being a
farmworker. The boycott involves
growers, farmworkers, pesticides and
most importantly, you, the consumer.
The growers are trying to cloud up
the real issue by making the entire
movement a political one. For example,
when reading the grower information,
students should be careful when they
see the growers say that Fortune mag
azine says that UFW President Cesar
Chavez says that pesticides cause
AIDS.
I point out this example because it
is a veir blatant way in which growers
are shifting the focus of the issue from
pesticides to AIDS. Although AIDS
merits much discussion, it bears not
relevance to the grape boycott.

This particular example is very easy
to spot. Most others, however, are very
subtle. It takes a very critical reader
to catch all of the politics involved in
the issue.
Again, I urge you to remember the
real issue when reading all of the litera
ture and when discussing the issue with
others you and pesticide use.
If pesticides are the real issue and
they are used on most fruits and
vegetables, why pick on grapes?
There are two reasons for singling
out table grapes. For obvious reasons,
a boycott on all fruits and vegetables
would not work for either the consumer
or the producer. Imagine boycotting all
meat or dairy products!
Under such circumstances, one fruit
or vegetable had to be chosen. Table
grapes were chosen because the table
grape industry uses the most pesticides
of any farming industry.
Since the boycott was called, growers
have stopped the use of some of the
pesticides. The goal is to stop the use
of all dangerous pesticides in our food
supply.
Tne auestion concerning Stanford's
role in tne boycott also arises. Stanford
is a highly respected institution, and
its actions carry a lot of weight.
Although the University may some
times seem separate from reality, it is
not. We at Stanford are not above our
social responsibility.
In fact, as an intellectual institution,
Stanford should be a leader in such
responsibility. Unfortunately, no stand
is a stand supporting dangerous pes
ticides in our society.
It is time to put pesticides use on
the stand and let grape growers know
the verdict. If you would like more

I must say from the outset
that I support neither the
grape growers nor the
United Farm Workers in
the grape boycott. My op
position is not directed at
the boycott per se, but

rather at the University's participation
in promoting the boycott.
What I find objectionable is the Uni
versity's collaboration with MEChA in
taking the boycott to the dorms. It is
not that the University has endorsed one
side or the other. The problem lies in
the University's using its considerable
resources to give a student group the
opportunity to further its political cause.
The Office of Student Affairs, Univer
sity Food Service, Residential Education
and the President's Office have given
themselves over to this effort in one way
or another.
Food Service and Student Affairs have
helped fund the educational materials
which have been sent out and Res Ed
has asked residential assisants to dis
tribute fliers in the dorms, to show films
and to attend training sessions on the
issues.
In addition, Student Affairs has re
quested that each dorm take a binding
vote on participation in the boycott
The University says that all this is
being done so that the students can make
a more informed decision about whether
or not their dorms should support the
boycott. This seems to me a secondary
issue. The real question for us is not
whether or not to support the boycott.
We can and should make that decision
as individuals and do not require the
acquiescence of our dorms to do so.
The question is whether or not we
want Stanford to set a precedent of serv
ing as the administrative apparatus for
promoting the political causes of its stu
dents.
The University's collaboration has
been made all the more unacceptable by

its failure to provide adequate safeguards
against being seen to take a position on
the boycott.
Though apologies have been forthcom
ing, how could the organizers of the ed
ucational campaign not have realized the
effect created by distributing four con
secutive fliers from MEChA without a
single answering flier from the grape
growers?
If this were not enough to bring into
question the University's equanimity in
promoting both sides of the issue, what
were we to make of the green flier, dis
tributed by RAs on Feb. 16, which in
cluded the following: "MEChA, along
with Dean of Student Affairs, are [sic]
providing information about the issue so
that you will understand why you should
BOYCOTT GRAPES," (my emphasis
added).
The University's carelessness with
respect to education on the boycott is
not of great consequence compared to
the broader principle at stake: No de
partment or office of the University
should serve as a vehicle for the expres
sion of any political position, regardless
of the sentiments of the students, ad
ministrators or faculty involved.
The University is not a democracy or
some kind of referendum-driven political
action committee. The University's mis
sion with respect to politics is to incubate
leadership and thought for the political
arena, not to act politically on its own.
Make no mistake about it: Stanford
has the potential, as an institution, to
be a tremendous political force. It should
be understood, however, that the costs
of realizing that potential are consider
able. We should be wary of those who
would undermine the delicate niche
which the University occupies in society
in order to serve their own political pur
poses.
