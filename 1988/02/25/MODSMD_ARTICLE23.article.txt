## Ujamaa's role positive 
### 
I AM WRITING THIS in response
to the Feb. 12 letter by Socrates
Jimeniz and the Feb. 17 letter by
Tom Carter about Ujamaa and reverse
racism.
I am white. I live in Ujamaa. And I
love it.
I live two doors down from Carter
and I have spoken with him about my
views on this subject and therefore see
no need for a "Daily war."
However, the reason I am writing
this letter is because I have noticed
that many people outside Ujamaa
suspect that the house is a bastion of
anti-white sentiments and some of
those people are willing to attack it
when given any occasion.
I do not want these recent letters to
spur on such attacks. It seems to me
that the black community has to
defend itself enough from asinine
charges.
I have seen people compare being
escorted from semi-formal Club
Ujamaa for wearing blue jeans to
racial discrimination.
I have seen people claim that this
year's commencement speaker, Robert
Maynard, cannot serve as a universal
role model, but that Tip O'Neill and
Ted Koppel can.
I have seen the Black Student Union
criticized for not catering to a certain
non-black student who expressed a
fabricated desire to join that Union
only as a test to see if he could.
Witnessing this continual string of
explicit and implicit indictments
against the black community and
realizing that Ujamaa represents a
prime target for such insinuations, I
decided that it was worth an effort to
do something about it.
Therefore, here I will attempt to
mitigate some of the negative effects of

these recent letters and will maybe
even dispel some of the festering mis
conceptions that might otherwise
develop into another launch pad for
further dissemination of twisted logic.
Carter's letter seemed to imply that
the anti-white article that had been
anonymously slipped under most
Ujamaa residents' doors was condoned
by the mfyority of those residents.
But everyone with whom I've spoken
concerning the article not only dis
agreed with its contents, but found
them to be appalling. For me, it ex
pressed a view that was totally unchar
acteristic of both the atmosphere and
ideology of the house.
Jimeniz's implication that Ujamaa is
"segregationalist" is sensationalist at
best.
Ujamaa is the black ethnic theme
house.
With that in mind, its emphasis is
obviously placed on learning about and
building up a rich culture that has
been denigrated all too often.
To students who are not black, this
culture is frequently alien in many
ways, ranging from musical tastes to
outlooks on the American experience.
Various differences in culture lead to
initial uneasiness and even defensive
ness, but there is no reason why these
feelings should persist.
I have found that trying to under
stand and appreciate differences brings
not only acceptance of, but esteem for,
those differences.
I feel that I have put forth some
effort to do just that at Ujamaa, and I
have never felt unwanted nor have my
attempts been looked down upon in
any way.
On the contrary, the house does an
excellent job of encouraging all of its
residents to explore its theme as much

as possible. And even more important
ly, I feel that I have been accepted for
who I am â€” even with all of my
differences.
I would like to suggest that others
put forth a similar effort before they
deem themselves ready to criticize.
