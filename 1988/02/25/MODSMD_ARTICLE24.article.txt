WE ARRIVED AT THE
Stanford-California men's
basketball game to find the
UC-Berkeley athletic department had
seated us in the rafters, as we had
expected. We weren't the only ones
disappointed with our seats, however.
As we sat down, the Stanford Axe
Committee was involved in a debate
with Berkeley's Axe Committee over
their seating arrangements. The
Berkeley representative told the red
shirted Axe Committee that they could
remain where they were or sit in
better seats in the middle of the
Berkeley rooting section.
Did they stay with the Cardinal
fans? No!! The Axe committee deserted
the Stanford section for a better view
from the Berkeley side.
As if that wasn't bad enough, in
response to the obnoxious Berkeley
cheer of "take off that red shirt," one
committee member actually discarded
the Cardinal red and put on the blue
and gold!

When the Cardinal took their first
big lead with 9:16 left to go, the Axe
Committee decided their original seats
weren't so bad after all and returned
to the Stanford section.
Could someone please define "fair
weather fan?" The Axe Committee's
behavior not only showed a lack of
pride and dignity, but irresponsibly as
well.
By choosing to watch the game from
a better vantage point rather than
from the Stanford section, the Axe
Committee failed to do the job that
our ASSU money entrusts them to do.
Sad but true, the Stanford Axe
Committee members were the big
Weenies at Berkeley.
