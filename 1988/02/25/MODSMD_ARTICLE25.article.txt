# Grape growers' argument inaccurate
## 
### 
As participants in the National
March on Washington for Lesbian and
Gay Rights in 1987, we are disturbed
by the California grape growers' claim
that "in 1987 . . . UFW President
Cesar Chavez declared at the March
for Gay and Lesbian Rights that
grapes can lead to AIDS." This ap
peared in a flyer distributed to Stan
ford residences.
We do not recall any such statement
by Cesar Chavez at the march.
Chavez indicated his support for the
fight r gainst AIDS and expressed
simila.- concern about other health
crises in the United States, such as

pollution of food and water supplies by
insecticides.
This misrepresentation of Chavez's
support of the gay and lesbian commu
nity calls into question the reliability
of the grape growers' information.
We hope that Stanford students will
read the distributed flyer with a criti
cal eye for other such misinformation
and demand that the grape growers
back their claims with accurate facts.
