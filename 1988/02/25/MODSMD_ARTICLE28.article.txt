# English prof. and Hoover critic goes on sabbatical
## The 						Rebholz roar is quelled for two quarters 
### Kristen Lee 
According to Rebholz, the senate
should do much more than simply "talk"
about University policies. If possible, he
would like to make Kennedy's adminis
trative committees directly responsible to
the senate.
Political Science Prof. John Manley,
who frequently joins Rebholz in protest,
said he is also frustrated with the senate.
"To allow Ron to speak is not [effective]
if you stonewall everything he says,"
Manley said.
Despite his warfare with the senate,
Rebholz will return to the floor in the
fall, which comes as a relief to some of
his colleagues.
"Thank God for Ron. He is the only
one with the guts to stand up and say:
The emperor has no clothes," Manley
said.
"It is only in the senate that you can
keep the top administrators on their toes
by asking questions," Rebholz said.
"You can sometimes bring out some
very startling revelations, making admin
istrators aware that they can't exercise
their power without scrutiny."
Rebholz learned what he described as
"the willingness to take on authority"
from his father, a blue collar worker who
tried forming a labor union in 1946. From
his father, he also learned the conse
quences of being defeated by the author
ity.
"My father never got another raise"
for the remaining 19 years he spent with
his company, Rebholz said.
Rebholz said that had he began his
teaching career at Stanford in the '80s
instead of the '60s, he would have fol-

The Faculty Senate may seem quieter
this quarter — Prof. Ronald Rebholz is
on sabbatical.
Known not only as a Shakespeare
scholar but also as the man who fires
difficult questions at University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy on the senate floor,
Rebholz said he has "always been a
protestor."
Now on sabbatical for this quarter and
the next, Rebholz is writing a book on
Shakespeare's philosophy of history —
and storing up ammunition for when he
returns to teaching and protesting next
fall.
According to Economics Prof. Kenneth
Arrow, a former senate chair, "Rebholz
played a constructive role (in the Senate).
He was always asking difficult questions,
which he had researched and carefully
prepared."
Although in the past Rebholz attacked
the administration on issues including
the Hoover Institute and the Reagan Li
brary, he has found another target —
the senate itself.
Since the beginning of the anti-
Vietnam protests 20 years ago, Rebholz
has been firing questions on the senate
floor. Despite this long-term relationship,
Rebholz predicted the demise of the sen
ate because the adminstration will not
act on senate recommendations.
"The senate is a dying body and should
be put to death," he charged. "The Fac
ulty Senate might just self-destruct out
of the incredible boredom and powerless
ness that they feel."

be put to death. [The members] might just self

powerlessness that they feel.'

lowed in his father footsteps and would
not have received the recognition he
deserved. "I would hardly have received
tenure," he said.
But the father-son comparison stops
there. While his father met with financial
setbacks because of his reputation as a
rebel, Rebholz would not have received
tenure because of his passion for teach
ing, he explained.
"Given the choice between an hour of
study and an hour of teaching, I would
definitely choose to teach," he added.
Major research universities like Stan
ford often do not give professors this
choice, according to Rebholz, who com
plained that a "publish or perish" policy
has led to poorer teaching.
Although Rebholz is presently hard at
work on his book, quarters devoted
wholly to research are a rarity for him.
He prefers to devote most of his time to
his students.
Much of his protest revolves around
his belief that teaching students should
always have first priority at a university.
Pointing to the Hoover Institution, he
said, "biased institutions . . . are not

related to a university's goal — the ed
ucation of students."
But along with teaching, Rebholz said
his greatest passion is Shakespeare. Be
sides studying the playwrite and his crit
ics extensively, Rebholz said he attends
"every performance of Shakespeare in
the area" as well.
His passions for teaching and for
Shakespeare make a powerful combina
tion, according to several students.
"Rebholz was one of the most energetic
and dynamic lecturers that I have ever
had," junior Lloyd Kreiger said.
"He was really vibrant and really got
into what he was teaching. Everyone
knew that Shakespeare was his specialty
but he was still very focused," according
to junior Sharon Gwyn who took a survey
class in poetry with Rebholz. "I learned
a lot," Gwyn said.
Teaching is "a process of mutual learn
ing," not a one-sided venture, according
to Rebholz.
"He was very receptive to student par
ticipation," Kreiger added.
Whether he is in the classroom or on

the senate floor, Rebholz cannot tolerate
passivity.
"I love . . . [the] sense of enthusiasm,
energy and genuine intellectual
curiousity of some students," Rebholz
said.

class in poetry with Rebholz. "I learned
a lot," Gwyn said.
Teaching is "a process of mutual learn
ing," not a one-sided venture, according
to Rebholz.
"He was very receptive to student par
ticipation," Kreiger added.
Whether he is in the classroom or on

the senate floor, Rebholz cannot tolerate
passivity.
"I love . . . [the] sense of enthusiasm,
energy and genuine intellectual
curiousity of some students," Rebholz
said.

Despite his calm demeanor, English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz stirs up a storm
in the classroom and on the floor of
the Faculty Senate.
According to Rebholz, the senate
should do much more than simply "talk"
about University policies. If possible, he
would like to make Kennedy's adminis
trative committees directly responsible to
the senate.
Political Science Prof. John Manley,
who frequently joins Rebholz in protest,
said he is also frustrated with the senate.
"To allow Ron to speak is not [effective]
if you stonewall everything he says,"
Manley said.
Despite his warfare with the senate,
Rebholz will return to the floor in the
fall, which comes as a relief to some of
his colleagues.
"Thank God for Ron. He is the only
one with the guts to stand up and say:
The emperor has no clothes," Manley
said.
"It is only in the senate that you can
keep the top administrators on their toes
by asking questions," Rebholz said.
"You can sometimes bring out some
very startling revelations, making admin
istrators aware that they can't exercise
their power without scrutiny."
Rebholz learned what he described as
"the willingness to take on authority"
from his father, a blue collar worker who
tried forming a labor union in 1946. From
his father, he also learned the conse
quences of being defeated by the author
ity.
"My father never got another raise"
for the remaining 19 years he spent with
his company, Rebholz said.
Rebholz said that had he began his
teaching career at Stanford in the '80s
instead of the '60s, he would have fol-

The Faculty Senate may seem quieter
this quarter — Prof. Ronald Rebholz is
on sabbatical.
Known not only as a Shakespeare
scholar but also as the man who fires
difficult questions at University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy on the senate floor,
Rebholz said he has "always been a
protestor."
Now on sabbatical for this quarter and
the next, Rebholz is writing a book on
Shakespeare's philosophy of history —
and storing up ammunition for when he
returns to teaching and protesting next
fall.
According to Economics Prof. Kenneth
Arrow, a former senate chair, "Rebholz
played a constructive role (in the Senate).
He was always asking difficult questions,
which he had researched and carefully
prepared."
Although in the past Rebholz attacked
the administration on issues including
the Hoover Institute and the Reagan Li
brary, he has found another target —
the senate itself.
Since the beginning of the anti-
Vietnam protests 20 years ago, Rebholz
has been firing questions on the senate
floor. Despite this long-term relationship,
Rebholz predicted the demise of the sen
ate because the adminstration will not
act on senate recommendations.
"The senate is a dying body and should
be put to death," he charged. "The Fac
ulty Senate might just self-destruct out
of the incredible boredom and powerless
ness that they feel."

lowed in his father footsteps and would
not have received the recognition he
deserved. "I would hardly have received
tenure," he said.
But the father-son comparison stops
there. While his father met with financial
setbacks because of his reputation as a
rebel, Rebholz would not have received
tenure because of his passion for teach
ing, he explained.
"Given the choice between an hour of
study and an hour of teaching, I would
definitely choose to teach," he added.
Major research universities like Stan
ford often do not give professors this
choice, according to Rebholz, who com
plained that a "publish or perish" policy
has led to poorer teaching.
Although Rebholz is presently hard at
work on his book, quarters devoted
wholly to research are a rarity for him.
He prefers to devote most of his time to
his students.
Much of his protest revolves around
his belief that teaching students should
always have first priority at a university.
Pointing to the Hoover Institution, he
said, "biased institutions . . . are not

related to a university's goal — the ed
ucation of students."
But along with teaching, Rebholz said
his greatest passion is Shakespeare. Be
sides studying the playwrite and his crit
ics extensively, Rebholz said he attends
"every performance of Shakespeare in
the area" as well.
His passions for teaching and for
Shakespeare make a powerful combina
tion, according to several students.
"Rebholz was one of the most energetic
and dynamic lecturers that I have ever
had," junior Lloyd Kreiger said.
"He was really vibrant and really got
into what he was teaching. Everyone
knew that Shakespeare was his specialty
but he was still very focused," according
to junior Sharon Gwyn who took a survey
class in poetry with Rebholz. "I learned
a lot," Gwyn said.
