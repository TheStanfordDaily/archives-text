As the 1960s retreat further
and further into the past, it be
comes more and more difficult for
today's student to find an intel
lectually honest history of the pe
riod. Fortunately, such students
now have Todd Gitlin's book,
"The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days
of Rage."
Indeed, for American students,
1988 ought to be a year of reflec
tion. In the coming months, many
of us will come to understand that
we are a generation uniquely in
fluenced by history. We will un
derstand the extent to which we
stand on the shoulders, and in
the shadow, of the 19605.
In fact, we now observe an aus
picious anniversary: Twenty years

have passed since 1968, a critical
period not only of the '60s, but
of post-war America. In that 12-
month period, the hippie move
ment was at its height, Richard
Nixon become president, the
Democratic National Convention
gathered in Mayor Daley's
Chicago, Martin Luther King Jr.
and Robert Kennedy were shot
dead, and American military lead
ership was stunned by the Tet
Offensive.
It is not without reason that
Time magazine editors and other,
more respectable cultural observ
ers call 1968 "the year that
shaped a generation." But as more
students will come to realize, the
generation that 1968 truly shaped
is our own.
Given our present political con
dition, we are compelled to learn
from the '60s and the events that
lead to the explosion of 1968. If
students are to regain once again
their distinct political and cultural
voice, then we ought to under
stand how the last generation

gave us the world in which we
operate today. And although
many students place the '60s
safely within the realm of history,
where it is only a source of endless
camp, now is an ideal time to gain
wisdom from the past. We now
have the temporal distance from
those years that makes serious
exploration possible.
Indeed, in recent months,
scholars, writers, cultural critics,
musicians and virtually those who
lived through the '60s have
flooded the market with recollec
tions and interpretations of the
decade. Some, the PBS television
series "Eyes on the Prize" for in
stance, have been outstanding.
Others, such as David Miller's his
tory of Students for a Democratic
Society, "Democracy in the
Streets," are equally excellent in
their own way.
Still others, most of which have
appeared in the popular press and
on prime-time TV, are unworthy
of note if not downright perni
cious. Such "histories" tend to be
glorified montages, intellectually
useless or, at their worst, politi
cally opportunistic. Students who
study the '60s must chose their
sources with great care.
Such students would do well to
choose "The Sixties." Gitlin's
book is in no way a definitive
account of the decade. It will not
replace books such as Gerald
Howard's "The Sixties," Milton
Viorst's "Fire in the Streets,"
more specific histories of the
Black Liberation Movement and
the Women's Movement, or in
particular, Kirkpatrik Sale's
"SDS."
But such was certainly not the
author's intention. Instead, Gitlin
offers a history of white unrest
in the '60s that is admirably
situated in historical context, and
he does so with personal anec
dotes that are political revelations
in and of themselves. As individ
ual and national biography, "The
Sixties" deserves very serious
reading.
Such praise, though, should not
mask some of the book's
shortcomings. The historical nar
rative of the book, for instance,
is not particularly new. Gitlin
describes the development of a
revolutionary, millenialist con
sciousness among white youth
and follows the movement of this

consciousness from its beginnings
in the 1950s to its fragmented,
violent, generally self-deceiving
end.
Gitlin attempts to portray the
development of an "as if" concep
tion of political change, according
to which a more humane future
can be wrestled into existence
through its willed embodiment in
present-day political actors. (For
example, acting "as if' the United
States were a desegregated na
tion, "as if' the world were "light
and pretty," or "as if" a revolution
were underway to make that fu
ture come — through constant
application of the will — into ex
istence.
During his narrative, Gitlin
portrays the mood of the 1950s
and how oppositional forces
within it (sociologist C. Wright
Mills, poets Allen Ginsberg and
Jack Keroac, pop icons James
Dean and Mad magazine, rock
music) layed the groundwork for
this millenialist consciousness).
Behind this analysis — con
stantly and admirably — is a cru
cial awareness (often absent in
many works on the period) of the
critical influence of black protest
on white political commitment.
Gitlin fellows the history of this
commitment through the
landmark student group SDS, the
national student organization
that worked to end racism,
poverty and the war in Vietnam.
Although the view is comprehen
sive, it is, as noted, not particu
larly new, and Gitlin's mo.st ar
resting insights are certainly
those that are driven by the force
of his personal experience.
Gitlin is at his best, for in
stance, when writing about his
personal memories of the 19505,
his activities in Tocsin (Harvard's
peace organization), the years in
which he served as president of
SDS, and in part four of the book,
"Forcing the Revolution." Gitlin's
descriptions are even-handed,
serious, and often exciting. At
times they are so vivid, so inter
esting, that they are truly mag
nificent, if only because the per
sonal and the specific are inher
ently attractive.
Gitlin's analysis sags, though,
(but not much) when he writes
about the counter-culture, the
Women's Movement, and early
SDS (for instance, he surprisingly

fails to mention the early Haber-
Hayden debates). His analysis also
lacks a deep explication of how
the protests of the 1960s were
particularly American, how
Thomas Jefferson, Ralph Waldo
Emerson, William James and Al
len Ginsberg are part of the same
cultural continuum.
Such shortcomings, though,
ought to be overlooked. And in
general, "The Sixties" suceeds
most, not because of its analysis
per se, but because it is Gitlin's
analysis, and everywhere it is
graced by his very unique — and
at the same time very represen
tative — perspective.
Indeed, it will be years until
someone writes a truly excellent
and definitive history of the

American '60s, and such an un
dertaking will require extensive
analysis of cultural, intellectual
and social history, a deep political
understanding, both eclectic and
scholarly knowledge, and vicious
avoidance of romanticization.
But Gitlin's book provides a
brief vision of how such an anal
ysis might appear, and any stu
dent of the period would do well
to take Gitlin very seriously. With
his help, and the help of many
other historians, critics and writ
ers, we will come to understand
an extremely complicated decade
and how, in many ways, we still
live in it.

As the 1960s retreat further
and further into the past, it be
comes more and more difficult for
today's student to find an intel
lectually honest history of the pe
riod. Fortunately, such students
now have Todd Gitlin's book,
"The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days
of Rage."
Indeed, for American students,
1988 ought to be a year of reflec
tion. In the coming months, many
of us will come to understand that
we are a generation uniquely in
fluenced by history. We will un
derstand the extent to which we
stand on the shoulders, and in
the shadow, of the 19605.
In fact, we now observe an aus
picious anniversary: Twenty years

have passed since 1968, a critical
period not only of the '60s, but
of post-war America. In that 12-
month period, the hippie move
ment was at its height, Richard
Nixon become president, the
Democratic National Convention
gathered in Mayor Daley's
Chicago, Martin Luther King Jr.
and Robert Kennedy were shot
dead, and American military lead
ership was stunned by the Tet
Offensive.
It is not without reason that
Time magazine editors and other,
more respectable cultural observ
ers call 1968 "the year that
shaped a generation." But as more
students will come to realize, the
generation that 1968 truly shaped
is our own.
Given our present political con
dition, we are compelled to learn
from the '60s and the events that
lead to the explosion of 1968. If
students are to regain once again
their distinct political and cultural
voice, then we ought to under
stand how the last generation

gave us the world in which we
operate today. And although
many students place the '60s
safely within the realm of history,
where it is only a source of endless
camp, now is an ideal time to gain
wisdom from the past. We now
have the temporal distance from
those years that makes serious
exploration possible.
Indeed, in recent months,
scholars, writers, cultural critics,
musicians and virtually those who
lived through the '60s have
flooded the market with recollec
tions and interpretations of the
decade. Some, the PBS television
series "Eyes on the Prize" for in
stance, have been outstanding.
Others, such as David Miller's his
tory of Students for a Democratic
Society, "Democracy in the
Streets," are equally excellent in
their own way.
Still others, most of which have
appeared in the popular press and
on prime-time TV, are unworthy
of note if not downright perni
cious. Such "histories" tend to be
glorified montages, intellectually
useless or, at their worst, politi
cally opportunistic. Students who
study the '60s must chose their
sources with great care.
Such students would do well to
choose "The Sixties." Gitlin's
book is in no way a definitive
account of the decade. It will not
replace books such as Gerald
Howard's "The Sixties," Milton
Viorst's "Fire in the Streets,"
more specific histories of the
Black Liberation Movement and
the Women's Movement, or in
particular, Kirkpatrik Sale's
"SDS."
But such was certainly not the
author's intention. Instead, Gitlin
offers a history of white unrest
in the '60s that is admirably
situated in historical context, and
he does so with personal anec
dotes that are political revelations
in and of themselves. As individ
ual and national biography, "The
Sixties" deserves very serious
reading.
Such praise, though, should not
mask some of the book's
shortcomings. The historical nar
rative of the book, for instance,
is not particularly new. Gitlin
describes the development of a
revolutionary, millenialist con
sciousness among white youth
and follows the movement of this

consciousness from its beginnings
in the 1950s to its fragmented,
violent, generally self-deceiving
end.
Gitlin attempts to portray the
development of an "as if" concep
tion of political change, according
to which a more humane future
can be wrestled into existence
through its willed embodiment in
present-day political actors. (For
example, acting "as if' the United
States were a desegregated na
tion, "as if' the world were "light
and pretty," or "as if" a revolution
were underway to make that fu
ture come — through constant
application of the will — into ex
istence.
During his narrative, Gitlin
portrays the mood of the 1950s
and how oppositional forces
within it (sociologist C. Wright
Mills, poets Allen Ginsberg and
Jack Keroac, pop icons James
Dean and Mad magazine, rock
music) layed the groundwork for
this millenialist consciousness).
Behind this analysis — con
stantly and admirably — is a cru
cial awareness (often absent in
many works on the period) of the
critical influence of black protest
on white political commitment.
Gitlin fellows the history of this
commitment through the
landmark student group SDS, the
national student organization
that worked to end racism,
poverty and the war in Vietnam.
Although the view is comprehen
sive, it is, as noted, not particu
larly new, and Gitlin's mo.st ar
resting insights are certainly
those that are driven by the force
of his personal experience.
Gitlin is at his best, for in
stance, when writing about his
personal memories of the 19505,
his activities in Tocsin (Harvard's
peace organization), the years in
which he served as president of
SDS, and in part four of the book,
"Forcing the Revolution." Gitlin's
descriptions are even-handed,
serious, and often exciting. At
times they are so vivid, so inter
esting, that they are truly mag
nificent, if only because the per
sonal and the specific are inher
ently attractive.
Gitlin's analysis sags, though,
(but not much) when he writes
about the counter-culture, the
Women's Movement, and early
SDS (for instance, he surprisingly

fails to mention the early Haber-
Hayden debates). His analysis also
lacks a deep explication of how
the protests of the 1960s were
particularly American, how
Thomas Jefferson, Ralph Waldo
Emerson, William James and Al
len Ginsberg are part of the same
cultural continuum.
Such shortcomings, though,
ought to be overlooked. And in
general, "The Sixties" suceeds
most, not because of its analysis
per se, but because it is Gitlin's
analysis, and everywhere it is
graced by his very unique — and
at the same time very represen
tative — perspective.
Indeed, it will be years until
someone writes a truly excellent
and definitive history of the

American '60s, and such an un
dertaking will require extensive
analysis of cultural, intellectual
and social history, a deep political
understanding, both eclectic and
scholarly knowledge, and vicious
avoidance of romanticization.
But Gitlin's book provides a
brief vision of how such an anal
ysis might appear, and any stu
dent of the period would do well
to take Gitlin very seriously. With
his help, and the help of many
other historians, critics and writ

an extremely complicated decade
and how, in many ways, we still
