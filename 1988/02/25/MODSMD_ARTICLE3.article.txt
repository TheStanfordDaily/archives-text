# Lab demolition to make way for new faculty housing
## 
### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
The construction of 26 new units of
additional faculty housing will force the
destruction of an old University labora
tory, once the site of electronics research
and now described as an "eyesore" by
one area resident.
At its last meeting, the University
Board of Trustees approved a $7.6-
million budget to build 13 duplexes for
new faculty members on Stanford land
south of campus. The land is now the
site of the Ryan Building, which was
constructed in the 19205.
The site is located just north of the
intersection of Junipero Serra Boulevard
and Page Mill Road.
Neighbors of the Ryan Lab building
were originally concerned about the size
of the construction project and the loss

of open space near their homes, according
to Managing Director of University Real
Estate and Lands Management Jeff
Wachtel.
Communications Prof. Henry
Breitrose, a resident of the Frenchman's
Hill neighborhood that borders the pro
posed construction site, said the Univer
sity has been "reasonably responsive" to
community concerns.
Breitrose said it was "basically a matter
of kicking and screaming early on," but
that the University cooperated with res
idents after they expressed their con
cerns. "Finally, the University has got a
reasonable process of consultation
going," Breitrose remarked.
Wachtel explained that the University
worked with a group of faculty members
who live in the area to plan a development
that would "fit nicely in the site but still
meet the programmatic demands" of the

project. "The duplex idea was actually
suggested by the group," he said.
Even though neighbors expressed con
cern about the housing project, they said
they are not sorry to see the Ryan Lab
building disappear. "It would be hard to
start a Save-the-Ryan group out here,"
Breitrose said. "The building is a kind
of eyesore, sort of like an ugly child. You
learn to ignore it."
Wachtel said the new duplexes will be
either two- or three-bedroom units.
Design details are still being worked out
as local contractors make bids on building
the project. Wachtel said each unit will
be leased for between $300,000 and
$350,000.
New faculty members who have been
at Stanford less than three years will be
given the first chances to lease the
duplexes, Wachtel said.
"We have already had people contact

us who are interested," Wachtel said.
"During the first two years, the
duplexes will be limited to faculty who
have been here less than three years."
At the end of this two-year period, Wach
tel said, any unsold duplexes will be avail
able for facility purchase.
"Generally, there's a shortage of
housing for new faculty," Wachtel
pointed out. The new duplex units will
"allow deans and department chairmen
to help recruit new faculty," he said.
Current faculty housing on campus
consists of approximately 600 single
family homes and 222 condominium
units. Wachtel said duplexes fill the gap
between small, inexpensive con
dominiums and larger, expensive homes.
"They fill a different segment of the mar
ket," he said. Only nine of the Univer
sity's existing condominiums remain va
cant.

According to Wachtel, construction of
the duplexes will probably begin this
summer, and is slated for completion in
September 1989. Wachtel said the start
of construction is contingent upon
tearing down the Ryan Building.
Although the Ryan facilities have not
been used since the 19605, two art pro
fessors presently use the building to
house their art studios. Art Prof. Nathan
Oliveira moved his studio there 10 years
ago and Asst. Art Prof. Greg Lynch
moved in five years ago.
"The artists have to be relocated"
before construction of the duplexes can
begin, Wachtel said. He said the studios
would probably be moved to the new art
studio facilities planned for the Foothills.
The Ryan Building was the site of
several famous experiments, including
the invention of the klystron tube by
Russell and Sigurd Varian.
