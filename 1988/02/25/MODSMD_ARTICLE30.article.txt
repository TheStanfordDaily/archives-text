'One day Waskow and I
went to the Pentagon and
made our way through
the tangle of corridors to
interview Adam Yar
molinsky, McNamara's
special assistant for civil
defense. To my horror,
there was a child's
drawing of a battleship
taped to the glass in Yar
molinsky's bookcase. A
small thing, no doubt nor
mal in a capitol obsessed
with the mystique of P7-
109, yet it meant to me,
somehow, that clever ar
guments were beside the
point, that the people in

power really took their
games for granted. No
matter if they spoke with
rigor and erudition. No
matter if they were
blessed — like Adam Yar
molinsky, the son of two
eminent writers — with
impeccable liberal creden
tials. As the diminutive
Yarmolinsky stood behind
his desk and defended
the administration's civil
defense program, the
world went obvious on
me. Men such as this
were not going to be per
suaded to be sensible.'
