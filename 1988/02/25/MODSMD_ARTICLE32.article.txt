## Women swimming for NCAAs at Pac-10s 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Few people think of Oregon as the
ideal vacation site, especially when
one travels there from sunny Cali
fornia, but a few Stanford students
can't wait to go.
Beginning today and continuing
through Saturday, the Cardinal

women's swimming squad competes in the Pacific
10 Conference Championships in Tualatin Hills,
Oregon. For most members of the team, this meet
is a great chance to qualify for the NCAA Cham
pionships. The meet is one of the swimmers' last
chances to qualify, as only the Stanford and Cali
fornia Invitationals next weekend remain for the
team before NCAAs start March 17.
The Pac-10 diving championships are being held
concurrently at McKale Pool at the University of
Arizona.
"I'm expecting to win (the team competition),"
senior Jen Pokluda said. "Of course, you've got to
go in with that attitude."
The Cardinal has already qualified nine swimmers
for the NCAA meet, but the team will need more
swimmers than that to unseat four-time defending
national champion Texas. The maximum number
of swimmers any team can send is 17, and Stanford
hopes to use this weekend to qualify as many more
competitors as possible.
According to senior tri-captain Pokluda, "we need
to get some (NCAA) cuts. Getting people to make
cuts is (our top goal)."
Second-ranked Stanford expects to be sternly
tested, especially by California and Arizona State,
because the top Cardinal swimmers won't be rested

for this meet. The swimmers that have already
qualified for NCAAs are training right through Pac
10s to make them as fast as possible for the NCAA
championships.
"The competition is definitely going to be there,"
Pokluda said, "It's going to be redly fast. Hopefully
that'll inspire us to do well."
Five events will be contested today and Stanford
has favorites in at least three of them. The first
final will be the 200-yard medley relay where Stan
ford's overall strength will be demonstrated. The
Cardinal could conceivably field a lineup of four
swimmers who combined to win seven Pac-10 in
dividual titles last year.
The next event, the 500 freestyle, may not go as
well for the Cardinal. Cal's Lisa Meyers has posted
the nation's best time in this event this season,
and the Stanford distance freestyle contingent —
senior Stacy Shupe, junior Dana Anderson and
freshman Barb Metz — will be hard-pressed to beat
Meyers, the obvious favorite in a fast field. Anderson
won this event last year, but last week's Cal meet
was her first since breaking her wrist in mid-
January.
In the 200 individual medley, junior Monica
Nielebeck and sophomores Laurie McLean and Jill
Johnson have posted the Cardinal's best times this
year, but UCLA's Catherine Capriles has the best
shot at this one.
Next up on this evening's program is the bet
the-Farm-on-this-one event for the day — the 50
free. Stanford junior Jenna Johnson won this event
at last year's Pac-10 championships and is the two
time defending NCAA champ as well. Johnson likely
won't be well-rested for the race — she has already

Championship meet.

qualified for NCAAs — and will
be challenged by junior teammate
Aimee Berzins and ASU's Mi
chelle Thompson, but Johnson
has won all 15 races she has swum
this year and hasn't lost in a
college-level 50-free race in over
a year.
The 800-free relay, the last
event for Thursday, is another
key event for the Cardinal, since
the team still needs an NCAA
qualifying time in that relay. Of
course, Stanford has not yet com
peted this year in that event. ...
The Sun Devils will again pose a
challenge, and the Golden Bears
— led by Meyers, Sarah Anderson
and Cheryl Kriegsman — are very
strong. Stanford has Jenna
Johnson, Berzins, freshman Jody
Smith and senior Susan Rapp to
lead its attack.
Stanford also expects to gain
some valuable points from the
diving competition. Although the
Cardinal's diving roster only con
tains three names, senior Leslie

Kleinheksel, junior Amy Biehl and
sophomore Katie Connors have all
performed well this season.
The Pac-10 meet uses the same
three-day format as the NCAA
championships, and the experi
ence gained in this meet will help
the Cardinal in its goal to upend
the Longhorns in three weeks.

'(Now we) don't walk
into NCAAs not
knowing what it's like.'

"It's a good rehearsal for the
intensity level at NCAAs," soph
omore Susannah Miller aaid. "It's
good to experience the format . ..
and swim against good competi
tion."
"I think it's a great experience,"
Pokluda concurred. "It's the same
format as NCAAs. We're not used
to swimming three days ... swim
ming your hardest every time. . ..
(Now we) don't walk into NCAAs
not knowing what it's like. When
you swim well here, it makes you
more confident going into
NCAAs."
