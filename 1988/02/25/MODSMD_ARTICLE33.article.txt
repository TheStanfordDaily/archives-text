# Golfers 14th after 18 holes

Setting realistic goals seems to
have worked for Coach Wally
Goodwin and the Stanford
men's golf team. After the first
round of the 54-hole John
Burns Invitational in Oahu,
Hawaii, the Cardinal stands

tied for 14th in a field of 26 teams.
Before the tournament, Goodwin said he
would be delighted to finish between 12th and
15th in the field of 26 teams. If the team
continues to score as well as it did in the first
round, that modest goal may indeed be at
tainable.
Arizona State, USC, and Nihon University
of Japan are knotted for the lead at 282
strokes. Hawaii, which according to Goodwin
played an uncharacteristically fine round,
stands second at 283. Stanford fired a respect
able 294 and is tied with Washington, 11 back
of the leaders.
Individually, Nihon's Ryoken Kawagishi
leads the pack with a 6-under-par 66. ASU's
Tom Stankowski is close behind with 67, and
teammate Bill Mayfair, the defending U.S.
Amateur champion, stands third with a 3-
under-par 69.
For the Cardinal golfers, the news was all
good. Sophomore Mark Funseth continues to
shine for the Cardinal; he fired a 1-under 71.
Chris Weyand surprised the team with a fine
73. Junior John Mahon was third on the team
with a 74, followed by sophomores Brad Joon
deph and Mike Hubly, who carded 76 and 80,
respectively.
Weyand's play was a very pleasant surprise
for Goodwin. Wednesday's round was the first
collegiate match for the sophomore, who was
a walk-on to the team in the fall. Weyand
attributed his fine golf to "a good start" and
ability to "scramble well by making a lot of
chips and putts."
Goodwin was much less modest. "I'm just
thrilled that a kid like Chris Weyand comes
out of golf class, walks on, qualifies and plays
wonderfully," an ebullient Goodwin said.
But the coach's praise was not limited to
Weyand. "Mark Funseth did a great job today,"
Goodwin remarked, adding that the sophomore
finished with an eagle, a birdie, and a par on
the last three holes.
