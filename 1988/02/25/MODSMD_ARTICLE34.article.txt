# Hoops battles for second at Maples
## Oregon one game behind Card in third place; Oregon St. tied 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
The Ducks and
Beavers visit the
Farm starting
tonight, and the
results of both
teams' games with
the homestanding

Stanford men's basketball team
could determine who stays afloat
in the race for second place in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
The Oregon Ducks (13-10 over
all, 8-6 in the Pac-10), who are
one game behind Stanford in the
conference, will be trying for a
season sweep of the Cardinal in
tonight's 8:30 p.m. contest. The
game will be broadcast live on
ESPN.
Oregon defeated Stanford 80-66
in Eugene last month behind
senior guard Anthony Taylor's 26
points, and the surging Ducks are
on a three-game winning streak.
After this evening's late start
ing contest, the Cardinal (17-8,
9-5) will host the Beavers of
Oregon State on Saturday after
noon at 3 p.m. The Beavers are
also 9-5 in the conference, are
15-8 overall and have won six of
of their last seven contests.
First things first, however, and
that's the Ducks. Oregon smoth
ered Stanford in the second half
of the two teams' last meeting,
outscoring the Cardinal 50-32.
The Ducks held Stanford to a
season-low 36.5 percent shooting
percentage from the field and out
rebounded the Cardinal 52-38.
"Since they beat us, they've
been playing very good ball,"
Stanford Asst. Coach Doug Oliver
said. "They've won three in a row
and could have beaten UCLA at
home."
Most of the hoopla for the
Ducks centers around Taylor, who
is averaging 20.9 points per game
and is eighth on the Pac-10 all

time scoring list with 1,782
points.
A big part of the Ducks' surge,
however, has been the improved
play of point guard Frank
Johnson. A junior-college trans
fer, Johnson took some time get
ting used to the Pac-10, but now
he has found his scoring touch.
He tallied 18 points in the 73-66
Oregon victory over Washington
State last week.
Stanford, meanwhile, is on a
streak of its own. The Cardinal
has won four of its last five games,
and the only loss was in double
overtime to Washington. Junior
guard Todd Lichti led a Cardinal
comeback last Sunday against
California, and is right behind
Taylor in the Pac-10 scoring
hierarchy this season, averaging
19.3 points per game.
Stanford big men Howard
Wright (15.9 ppg, 8.3 rebounds)
and Greg Butler (12.7, 5.5) con
tinue to provide the inside one
two punch for Head Coach Mike
Montgomery.
Wright and Butler will have to
deal with Oregon's paint bullwark
Randy Grant, who at 6-foot-6,
220-pounds (at least) can take up
the space inside.
"He's not tall, but he's big and
strong. We've got to be able to
contain him around the hoop,"
Oliver said.
Grant and teammate Keith Bal
derston hurt Stanford in the last
game with 11 rebounds each.
Over the past few weeks Mont
gomery has received increased
support from his bench. The Car
dinal starters, Terry Taylor,
Lichti, Bryan McSweeney, Wright
and Butler are shooting a collec
tive .539 from the floor. But the
increased quality contributions
from reserves Scott Meinert,
Derek Bruton and Andrew Vlahov
have been a key to Stanford's
recent success.

off the bench for Stanford.
