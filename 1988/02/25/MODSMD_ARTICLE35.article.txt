# Help cage recruiting: Go bonkers
## 
### 
Apologies for the potpourri nature of today's
comments, but after watching too much ice
dancing, coherent thought for more than 10
consecutive minutes is beyond hope.
THOUGHT #1. A national television audi
ence visits Stanford's own Maples Pavilion
tonight, courtesy of ESPN. This is an impor
tant thing.

Television exposure can not only help a
team in the polls, more importantly it can
help recruiting. We read about all sorts of
Los Angeles high school stars signing up at
Michigan, Syracuse, North Carolina, Ken
tucky, etc.
One reason is that during their prep years
they tune in and see all those teams on tele
vision every other week. Not only does it help
familiarize the kids with the school, but those
kids (if only in the back of their minds) may
be thinking, "If I go there I'll be on television
a lot."

Furthermore it helps if the crowd on the
televised game is enthusiastic, or just plain
bonkers. It's more exciting to play in front
of a crazy crowd. It's more fun. It also makes
for a better television broadcast if the an
nouncers need to shout above the crowd.
Who knows, maybe some hoop star in West
Virginia will tune in tonight and say, "Holy
smokes, a great crowd and great weather."
THOUGHT #2. Stanford tennis coaches
Frank Brennan and Dick Gould, who are
looking for the final few hundred thousand
dollars to fund a new Stanford tennis stadium,
are presenting a netter extravaganza this
weekend.
Gould describes the five matches in three
days on the Cardinal courts as "chaos," but
that translates into "heaven" for tennis fans.
The top-ranked women's team hosts Pacific
10 Conference rivals Arizona and Arizona
State on Friday and Saturday, while the
preseason No. 1 men host No. 22 San Diego,
No. 8 Michigan, and No. 10 UC-Irvine on
Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
Don't miss Michigan's quirky and unortho
dox star Dan Goldberg. And where else can
you see over a dozen of the top players in
the nation and get a tan to boot?
THOUGHT #3. The Stanford women's bas
ketball team isn't getting enough attention.
Think about it: the team is 23-1. Four years
ago those were the odds that the Cardinal

would be over .500.
The Lady Cards head up to Oregon this
weekend and should return 25-1. Twenty-five
and one.
THOUGHT #4. Comes from a clever reader:

Men in Idaho can't grow to be
6-8 ... they would have too far
to bend over to pick potatoes.'

Editor,
As a native Idahoan, I would like to con
gratulate senior staff writer Chris Fialko on
his amazing insight into the character and
sophistication of my fellow statespeople (Road
to NCAAs is via Moscow, Feb. 11).
Given the depth of knowledge and under
standing about the Iniermountain West that
Fialko displayed, 1 was, however, surprised
at his inability to understand the reaction of
Muscovites (in Moscow, get it?) to multiple
6-8 males. The cultural explanation is quite
simple.
Men in Idaho can't grow to be 6-8 because
they would have too far to bend over to pick
potatoes.
—Wendy Olson, first-year law student
Thanks, Ms. Olson. I swear I would have
figured it out eventually.
