# Fencers vie against Cal
## 
### David Earnest Staff writer 
Preparing for the Western
Regionals in March, Stanford's
men's and women's fencing
teams visit California Saturday
at 1 p.m. for their final regular
season meet of the year. The
Cardinal is looking forward to

Saturday's action as a final chance to refine
their skills before the regional tournaments.
The two teams last met on Nov. 20 as part
of Big Game festivities. The men won easily
18-9, while the women coasted to an 11-5
victory.
Men's Coach Zoran Tulum, however,
remains unshaken by the rumors of vengeance.
"Last time we were just plain better," he said.
"They are a little bit slower, and have a little
less experience than we do."
Injuries to the men's and women's teams
this season have slowed the Cardinal fencers.
Currently men's epee fencer Peter Duimstra
and team captain Dave Russ are recovering
from injuries. Duimstra has tendonitis in his
foot, while Russ has an injured ankle.
On the women's team, the return of captain
Alexandra Rankin from a broken ankle has
helped, but several injuries still slow the team.
Sophomore Elisabeth Spilman suffered a frac
tured wrist in a fall during the tryouts for
the Junior Olympics, but may be ready to
fence a couple of bouts this weekend. Junior
Juliet Johnson has been slowed by a cold and
will sit out this meet.
While both coaches are confident of victory
this weekend, they are not dismissing the im
portance of this meet. With only two weeks
to go until the Western Regionals for the
women, and three weeks to go for the men,
this meet will be used to prepare for the
tougher teams Stanford will face in the March
regionals.
