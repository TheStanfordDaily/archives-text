# UCSB spikers down Stanford in five
## Cardinal gets Rottman treatment 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
As senior David Rottman
goes, so goes UC-Santa Bar
bara volleyball. Rottman
had it going really well for
just enough time last night
to enable the Gauchos to get
out of town with a hard-

fought victory over the pesky Stanford
men's team. The score tells all: 4-15, 15-12,
15-9, 7-15, 15-11. And it was at least that
close.
Stanford was able to shut down Rottman
and his powerful cohorts in game one, limit
ing the Gauchos to a feeble .216 hitting
percentage in winning the game easily. But
then Rottman, a sure All-America bet, took
control.
He recorded a total of 14 kills in games
two and three while leading UCSB to a
2-1 edge in games. The Cardinal, however,
had enough savvy left to make a great
match out of it. Stanford scored the last
six points of the fourth game to force a
fifth and deciding game.
The Cardinal jumped out to a 9-5 lead,
and at this point, Rottman left the game
in shambles. Stanford seemed to have its
biggest win of the year sewn up. But it
only took the big senior a few minutes to
gather himself. Rottman's return, with the
Cardinal leading 10-6, ignited the listless
Gauchos. They scored nine of the next 10
points, including four Rottman kills, to
shatter Stanford's hopes of an upset.
"It's just something that can't be ex
plained," Cardinal senior Mark Amstutz
said. "We're really disappointed about the
loss, but (we're) very pleased with the way
we played."
Amstutz can be especially pleased with
the way he played individually. The outside
hitter from Pacific Palisades entered the
match during the third game and never

exited. Amstutz finished with 13 kills and
10 digs, while hitting at an excellent .417
clip. Most importantly, though, the scrappy
senior was able to almost single-handedly
lead the Cardinal back from a 12-5 deficit
in the third game.
Unfortunately, however, the dream had
to end. If indeed it was a dream. A better
explanation would be that Stanford is be
coming the type of team that can compete
consistently with the likes of the No. 4
Gauchos.
"Stanford plays very good up here (in
Maples Pavilion)," Rottman said. "They've
got a lot of hecklers that can really begin
to bother you."
The crowd at last night's game was the
rowdiest to be seen at a home Cardinal
volleyball match thus far in the season,
and it seemed to give the team some in
centive to play better. But, in the end,
even the pumped-up Stanford crowd could
not help the home team escape from the
quagmire of their own mistakes.
"We just made a few too many mistakes,"
junior Dave Johnson said, "but we'll clean
up those errors as time goes on."
Echoing the improvement theme Stan
ford Coach Fred Sturm has expressed all
season, Johnson pointed to the fact that
the squad remains confident. But with al
most half of the conference season over
and a 3-4 league mark, the Cardinal has
to act quickly.
"This would have been a great victory,"
a dejected Sturm said. "What else is there
to say?"
As for the Gauchos, they improved their
record in Western Collegiate Volleyball As
sociation play to 5-2, while securing their
hold on second place in the conference. "It
was a big, big win for us," Rottman said.
"Stanford played an extremely good match,
and we're real fortunate to come away with
the win."
