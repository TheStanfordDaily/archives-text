# Warning: Jodi Figley has arrived
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
It's been a while since a fresh
man blasted onto the collegiate
women's golf circuit the way Stan
ford's Jodi Figley has.
In all four tournaments in
which she has played, Figley has
finished in the top 10. Her latest

victim was the Arizona Intercol
legiate, played at the Randolph
Park Golf Course in Tucson,
where her final round, even-par
72 vaulted her into second place,
tied with two preseason All-
Americans and three strokes be
hind Texas' Michiko Hattori, the
top amateur in the world.
"I am so proud of her," Stan

ford Coach Tim Baldwin said of
his freshman wonder after her
final round in Tucson. "Every
thing about her is terrific."
In her very first tournament
last fall at the Washington Inter
collegiate, Figley served her first
warning to her fellow competitors,
tying for 10th. Later that month
she showed that Washington was
not a fluke, finishing 10th at the
Stanford Intercollegiate in a field
that included more than 15
preseason All-Americans.
"There's nobody on our team
that works harder," said Baldwin.
"She's out there every day bang
ing balls."

'She used to play (her
slice) with tremen
dous inspiration and
heart. Now she's got
a lot more swing to
go along with that.'
— Tim Baldwin

"She's an intense competitor
and a great sportsman," team
mate Stephanie Parel said. "A
good example of a prime athlete."
"She's a really hard worker,"
freshman Kristin Ryan said, "and
her great attitude rubs off on
everyone else."
Figley, who hails from Aliquip
pa, Penn., was the No. 2 recruit
in the country behind her team
mate, freshman Michele Lyford.
She attributes most of her recent
success to the American Junior
Golf Association. "I don't think
I'd be at Stanford if it wasn't for
the AJGA," she said. "They give
you the exposure and it's where
college coaches go to look for
recruits."
Behind these great results,
however, is a lot of hard work.

When she arrived on the Farm,
Baldwin's first move was to
change her slice into a draw: "a
swing change," he said.
"She used to play (her slice) with
tremendous inspiration and
heart. Now she's got a lot more
swing to go along with that."
The main reason for the swing
change was to increase her hitting
distance. "The courses she played
(as a junior golfer) were much
shorter," said Baldwin.
"Her guts and determination,"
according to Baldwin, and an
above-average short game made
her the No. 2 recruit in the nation,
despite her slice.
With her new swing, Figley now
feels that she can go out and at
tack courses. "Now I can play the
course instead of it playing me,"
she said. "Tim has been wonderful
helping me out. I'm learning to
be a better ball-striker and I'm
looking forward to the next three
years with him."
However, she also feels that she
has spent too much time on her
swing changes and not enough
time on her short game. She felt
that poor putting kept her from
winning in Arizona last week. "On
each of the last two rounds (in
Tucson) I missed about four or
five putts I should have made,"
she said. "Had I made half of
those I would have won."
Figley chose Stanford not only
for its golf program, which has
produced great players like three
time All-American Kathleen
McCarthy, but for its education.
"Being given an opportunity to
get a Stanford education and play
in a great program can't be beat."
While during the fall she was
less sure of her new swing, she
now has full confidence in it, and
hopes that this new confidence
and a more consistent short game
will enable her to help Stanford
qualify for the NCAA Champion
ships in May.

swing change," he said.
"She used to play (her slice) with
tremendous inspiration and
heart. Now she's got a lot more
swing to go along with that."
The main reason for the swing
change was to increase her hitting
distance. "The courses she played
(as a junior golfer) were much
shorter," said Baldwin.
"Her guts and determination,"
according to Baldwin, and an
above-average short game made
her the No. 2 recruit in the nation,
despite her slice.
With her new swing, Figley now
feels that she can go out and at
tack courses. "Now I can play the
course instead of it playing me,"
she said. "Tim has been wonderful
helping me out. I'm learning to
be a better ball-striker and I'm
looking forward to the next three
years with him."
However, she also feels that she
has spent too much time on her
swing changes and not enough
time on her short game. She felt
that poor putting kept her from
winning in Arizona last week. "On
each of the last two rounds (in
Tucson) I missed about four or
five putts I should have made,"
she said. "Had I made half of
those I would have won."
Figley chose Stanford not only
for its golf program, which has
produced great players like three
time All-American Kathleen
McCarthy, but for its education.
"Being given an opportunity to
get a Stanford education and play
in a great program can't be beat."
While during the fall she was
less sure of her new swing, she
now has full confidence in it, and
hopes that this new confidence
and a more consistent short game
will enable her to help Stanford
qualify for the NCAA Champion
ships in May.
