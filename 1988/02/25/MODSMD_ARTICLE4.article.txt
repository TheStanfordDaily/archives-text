# Prof. defends Dukakis
## Candidate's education record called strong 
### Brent Bigler 
Responding to a recent letter attacking
Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis' commitment to higher education,
a Stanford education professor who advises
Dukakis strongly defended the Massachu
setts governor's record.
Education Prof. Michael Kirst, who
works with Dukakis in developing elemen
tary and secondary school education policy,
called the governor's support for education
in recent years "strong" and said he was
"shocked" by allegations to the contrary.
The criticism comes from a letter circu
lated among college officials in Massachu
setts and Connecticut by Robert Wood,
former president of the University of Mas-

sachusetts at Amherst.
"To the question, 'Is
Dukakis a friend of educa
tion?' the short answer,
based on the Massachusetts
record, is regrettably 'No,' "
Wood wrote in the letter
that focused on higher ed
ucation.
Nick Paleologos, chair of
the Legislative Committee
on Education in Massachu-

setts, substantiated Kirst's opinion. Refer
ring to the letter, he said, "I personally
think it's totally without merit. Dukakis'
record is unbelievably good."
Paleologos said that Massachusetts is
first in the nation in increased support of
higher education and is 10th in the United
States in per-student spending.
Wood's letter does not dispute Massa
chusetts' commitment to educational
spending but gives credit to the state
legislature, not Dukakis.
The figures provided in his letter show
that Dukakis proposed a $2,207 billion
budget for higher education in the last
four years, but the legislature voted to
raise that to $2,252 billion.
Kirst, who worked with Wood in Wash
ington, said that he did not know why
Wood had made the allegations. "He's a
m*\jor figure — certainly a strong Demo
crat. It doesn't sound like the Bob Wood
I know."
"Frankly, I'm very confused," he added.

The concern over Dukakis record comes
as no suprise in this election year when
education has become a national
issue. Vice President George Bush, Repub
lican candidate for president, has said he
wants to be remembered as the "education
president."
In addition, national bestselling books,
including E.D. Hirsch's "Cultural Literacy"
and Allan Bloom's "The Closing of the
American Mind," have turned education
into an increasingly controversial issue.
Stanford Freshman Jonathan Aber
nethy, who worked in the Massachusetts
Governor's Office of Educational Affairs
last summer, said Dukakis has done much
to benefit education. Dukakis "has in
creased funding for fellowships for teach
ers, and scholarship has increased four
fold," he said.
Junior Subodh Chandra, chair of the
Stanford Democrats, agreed. Dukakis has
a "strong record of higher education as far
as I know, especially given the kind of
financial and fiscal mess in Massachusetts
when he went into office," he said.
Paleologos said Wood is a respected voice
in education but that his letter was a
"poison pen." Calling the election-year
criticism "suspect," he said that Dukakis
and Wood had parted ways in 1978 and
their relationship since then has not been
friendly.
"The Governor has bent over backwards
to cooperate with the legislature, (but) sud
denly he's being tagged behind a tree,"
Paleologos added.
Wood defended his position, denying that
personal animosities motivated him to
write the letter. "I don't care what Mike
(Dukakis) thinks of me, the real question
is that there is a record. The governor's
cuts get increasingly severe, and the legisla
ture has to increase the budget. Nobody
has questioned the figures I spelled out in
the letter."
The student senate at University of Mas
sachusetts has publicly sided with Wood.
It unanimously passed a resolution "con
demning Dukakis for disyuncture between
his rhetoric and record on higher educa
tion," said student Paul Wingle, one of the
resolution's drafters.
