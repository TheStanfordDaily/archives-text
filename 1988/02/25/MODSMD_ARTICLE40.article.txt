Despite several crashes and
some unexpected misfortune,
the Stanford cycling team
managed to place well in its
first two races of the season
last weekend at San Diego
State University.
Saturday's race, a circuit
race held on a 2.5-mile loop
course, brought both excellent
results and spectacular
wipeouts. The Cardinal's Mike
Fadich and Coulter Richardson
managed to place in the top 10
in Saturday's A race, despite
the loss of two other Stanford
riders to painful crashes.
In the B category, Dave
Louden and Scott Evans placed
high for the Cardinal, with
teammate Vit Henisz winning
a prime, a valuable prize of
points. Stanford's C riders did
well in their first collegiate
races, as Eric Stiles and Greg
Nakamoto sprinted to second
and fourth place, respectively,
with Larry Galka taking an
other prime.
In the women's circuit race,
Pam Stevenson took second for
the Cardinal and Alex Weiher
placed in the top 12.
Sunday's race was a criteri
um, a short and fast-paced loop
approximately two-thirds of a
mile long. With the A team
hampered by the loss of two
riders to crashes, only Stan
ford's Richardson placed in the
top 10. Teammate Fadich held
a 15-second lead over the rest
of the field at one point but
was caught by the pack at the
end. Louden placed in the top
12 for the B team, while Henisz
once again won a prime. Stiles,
with a sixth-place finish, was
the only C rider to take a top
spot.

Stanford's Stevenson did
spectacularly in Sunday's
women's criterium. She
sprinted to second place in
every prime and finished
second overall once again.
Women's Polo
The Stanford women's polo
team clinched a spot in the Na
tional Intercollegiate Champi
onship by defeating USC in the
first round of regional compe
tition in San Diego last Friday.
In the saddle for Stanford
were captain and center Annie
Kreyenberg, forward Ann
Wimmer, and back Celia Saino.
At the end of the first of four
chukkers (seven and a half
minute periods) Stanford was
behind 3-2, but rallied in the
second to take charge 5-3 and
never looked back, cruising to
a 10-5 win.
Unfortunately, Stanford did
not fare as well against a tough
UC-Davis squad on Saturday.
Stanford's women threw a
fierce defense at Davis but
could not hold off the accurate
scoring drives of the Aggies,
who entered the match ranked
second in the nation.
Scoring for the Cardinal
were Kreyenberg and Summer
Lopez, who entered play in the
third chukker. The remainder
of the starting lineup was
relieved in the third and fourth
chukkers by forwards
Courtney Clements and Pam
Weisz, who were competing in
their first intercollegiate meet.
"The team on the whole
played well," Stanford Asst.
Coach Arturo Farias said.
"This is the best women's team
we've ever had."
