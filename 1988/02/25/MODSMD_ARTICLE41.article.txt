CALGARY, Alberta â€” Debi Thomas and
Katarina Witt got off to a flying start Wed
nesday in the women's figure skating compe
tition at the Winter Olympics.
Thomas, the U.S. figure skating champion,
tuned up for her duel with Witt, East Ger
many's defending Olympic champion, by
finishing second after the compulsory figures.
Witt, who usually has little patience with
school figures, was within easy striking dis
tance in third.
"I was hoping to be first, but I won two
figures, so I'm happy," Thomas said.
Witt was thrilled to be third. "I'm in much
better position than I was last year at Cin
cinnati," she said, referring to last year's world
championships.
The U.S. Olympic Committee, meanwhile,
said it wants to find out what's wrong with
its team. So, it asked George Steinbrenner to
do the same thing for the Olympic Yankees
that he did for his New York Yankees: make
them win.
Steinbrenner will be the head of a blue
ribbon panel charged with reviewing the U.S.
effort.
"We can do better," Steinbrenner said.
