The Stanford women's
volleyball program, a fixture
in the Final Four six years
running, has guaranteed it
self a good shot at trip No.

classes in the nation.
The Cardinal, national runners-up at the
NCAA championships in December, loses
three of the top players in school history
to graduation next year, but Stanford
Coach Don Shaw has thrown the concept
of a "rebuilding year" out the window.
"We got four of our top five (recruits),"
Shaw said. "We couldn't have done much
better."
The new additions to the Cardinal squad
are: Nicole Appleman, a 6-footer from El
Toro; 5-9 Jodi Birk of Los Altos; 6-0 Amy
Cooper of Aurora, 111.; Jennifer Jackson, a
5-9 San Jose native; and Pacific Palisades'

Kristin Klein (6-0). This class, called "as
good a recruiting class as we've ever had"
by Shaw, will ease the loss of Nancy Reno,
Wendi Rush and Teresa Smith, all of whom
won first-team All-America honors on the
Farm.
"It's going to add depth," Shaw
predicted. "It's going to be real competitive
for spots. There'll be ... (real battles) for
playing time — I like that."
All of the recruits can play both middle
blocker and outside hitter, giving the Car
dinal great depth at both positions.
"This class, along with the continued
development of our returning players,
could give us the best combination of depth,
balance and versatility that we've had since
I've been at Stanford," Shaw added.
Klein and Cooper were both rated among
the top five recruits in the country by the
Spoilers Scouting Service, and Appleman
won California all-state honors and was
named her team's MVP.
Jackson is n first-team All-Do Anza
League pick while Birk, a walk-on, was
named the De Anza League MVP.
