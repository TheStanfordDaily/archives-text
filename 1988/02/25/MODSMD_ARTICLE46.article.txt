# Stanford Post Office cuts morning business hours
## 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Post Office has shor
tened its window service hours to ac
commodate federal deficit reduction
measures, but the new hours, which
took effect Feb. 16, have not hindered
customer service so far, Post Office Sta
tion Manager Mike Perret said last week.
The post office now serves customers
at its windows from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
a 30-minute reduction from the previous
hours of 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Perret said the Stanford branch will
"make sure the reduced (hours) do not
impact service to customers." He added
that most of the post office's "lobby
traffic" comes between 11 a.m. and 3
p.m. anyway.
Calling the change in hours a "minor
shift," Palo Alto Head Postmaster John
Maeda said, "We (wouldn't) want to do
anything that would affect our relations
with the public."
The shortened window hours follow
federal deficit reduction efforts, which
include a nationwide $160 million cut
in post office window service. The dif
ferent postal functions — such as
delivery, sorting and window service —

are "coded" and budgeted separately,
Maeda said.
While postal employees will receive
reduced wages for hours of window ser
vice, their overall wages will not change.
According to Maeda, reducing post office
operations costs will ultimately involve
cutting the hours of part-time
employees.
Perret said the Stanford branch
employs no part-time workers, so the
new window hours will have no effect
on employees "guaranteed eight hours
of work a day."
During the half hour previously al
lotted to customer service at windows,
employees will assume other duties,
such as sorting and "boxing" mail.
He added that this year's zip code
change for Stanford post office boxes,
from 94305 to 94309, will also help
employees meet the daily 12 p.m. pro
jection for boxing mail.
When the White Plaza post office
added 2,160 more boxes iast September,
Maeda, along with postal service officials
in San Francisco, decided to introduce
the new zip code for easier sorting and
improved efficiency.
The new zip code will take "a couple
years to get used to," Perret said.
