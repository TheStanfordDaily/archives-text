# New award recognizes mediators
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
To encourage new research in conflict
resolution, a unique annual award has
been established that will recognize in
novative student work on the settlement
of disputes without long and costly legal
battles.
The award was founded in memory
of Richard Goldsmith, former chief
magistrate of the U.S. District Court
for Northern California and a Stanford
graduate.
It will be given to any student in the
University for research or writing on
conflict resolution, according to Paul
Brest, dean of the Stanford Law School.
It grants $1,000 "to be used as the
recipient wishes," he said, and will first
be presented in June.
Law School Prof. Robert Mnookin,
chair of the award committee, said "re
search concerning how conflicts might
be resolved more fairly and efficiently
is a matter of highest priority and
serious concern in many departments
and schools at Stanford."
"This award should both encourage
work in this field and publicly acknowl
edge outstanding student achievement,"
he said.
According to Brest, lawsuits, strikes
and other forms of confrontation are
often the most costly and least effective

way of handling differences between
parties.
"We hope, through this award, to en
courage exploration of alternative meth
ods, such as negotiation and arbitra
tion" to resolve such disputes, he said.
Applicants will be evaluated by a
three-member committee composed of
Mnookin, Paul Goldsmith, the son of
the late Robert Goldsmith and an at
torney in San Francisco, and Chief
Judge Robert Peckham of the U.S. Dis
trict Court for Northern California.
Because of the small amount of re
search currently being done on conflict
resolution, this year's award will be
given only for a paper written on the
subject, according to Paul Goldsmith.
In the future the award will be
granted either for a paper, or to reward
research done on the subject, he said.
Mnookin said that this year appli
cants should send him a copy of any
essay concerning conflict resolution by
May 15, and he added that and added
that the committee is working with a
broad definition of conflict resolution
and the topics that could be addressed
in the papers.
According to Brest, the establishment
of the award comes at a time when the
University is "on the verge of establish
ing a mÂ£yor program of interdisciplinary
dispute resolution." The program could
combine elements of law, psychology,

business and economics, he said.
The award "fits in wonderfully at the
time when this (program) is taking off,
and he hopes the award will "stimulate
student interest."
Goldsmith, who died in a car accident
in 1984, was known professionally "as
remarkably able and effective in helping
parties reach settlements," according to
Edward Howden, a long-time friend and
colleague of Goldsmith's who is now
retired from civil rights mediation and
Justice Department work.
Paul Goldsmith said his father "loved
resolving disputes" and was "very good
at it. He stood for the principle of settle
ment."
Paul Goldsmith said his father felt it
was "very important to be a humanist,
to see through disputes and anger and
reach a rational resolution." He "was
looked on with a lot of affection by a
Jot of people."
