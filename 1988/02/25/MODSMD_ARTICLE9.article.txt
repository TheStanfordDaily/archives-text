# Overseas campuses get e-mail
## Computer communications help students solve problems 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
A electronic mail system in
stalled early last fall for Stan
ford's Overseas Studies program
has proven to be an effective time
and money-saver, according to
University Student Services Co
ordinator Charles Spolyar.
Overseas Studies Director
Thomas Heller called the
electronic mail system a "tremen
dous thing from a management
standpoint." Noting that the sys
tem makes it possible for infor
mation to be sent to or from the
home campus instantaneously,
Heller said projects such as fund
raising have become much easier.
The system is now in place at
the University's campuses in Ber
lin, Florence, Tours, Oxford and
Paris.
Students can now solve admin
istrative problems within a matter
of days, rather than weeks or
months, Heller said. He pointed
out that the new system enables
students to find out quickly about
things such as housing assign
ments.
According to Spolyar, the sys
tem is paying off so far. He said
the cost of sending electronic mail

to Stanford from one of the the
European campuses each month
is less than $30.
This figure, he said, is con
siderably lower than the amount
Overseas Studies used to pay for
Express Mail or long-distance
phone calls.
An electronic mail message can
be sent to an oversells campus
from any personal computer con
nected to BITNET, a computer
network linking many U.S. uni
versities.
Once the message travels over
seas it is received by a mainframe
computer and stored in an
electronic mailbox.
Spolyar said that within the
next year the electronic mail ser
vice will probably be extended to
Stanford's campus in Rome. Al
though he said no dates have been
set, Spolyar said the system will
probably also be installed at the
Stanford-in-Washinton program
and at the new Kyoto, Japan
campus.
Stanford does not plan to use
the electronic mail system in
Salamanca, Spain because only a
relatively small number of stu
dents are sent there, Spolyar said.
He added that implementation in
Krakow, Poland, is doubtful be-

cause the Polish government
probably would not allow a U.S.
university to set up a computer
link.
Overseas Studies eventually
plans to extend the electronic mail
service to individual students here
and overseas, Spolyar said. He
added, however, that this is not
a realistic possibility in the near
future because Stanford would
have to purchase additional ac
counts on the European Academic
Research Network, an equivalent
of BITNET.
Working over the summer with
the University's Academic Infor
mation Resources, Overseas
Studies had the electronic mail
service ready for use at the be
ginning of fall quarter.
During the summer Spolyar
visited the Stanford campuses in
Berlin, Oxford, Paris, Tours and
