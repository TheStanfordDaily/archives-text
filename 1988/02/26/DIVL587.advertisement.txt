That was always the response to grade school friends who said or
claimed unbelievable things. Remember? You might still be asking for
| proof on bigger topics —like how to deal with grief over a friend's death, or
where to find a more permanent source of happiness and fulfillment. Even
how to be healed of a sickness. And asking for proof—for a solution is a

A magazine called the Christian Science Sentinel has articles and testi

solves problems and permanently heals sickness. "Prove it," you sav? The
I proof is there, page after page.
