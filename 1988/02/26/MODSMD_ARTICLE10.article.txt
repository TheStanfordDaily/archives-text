College students should not un
derestimate the risks of practicing
unprotected sex, Bernie Zilber
geld, the author of a book on male
sexuality, said here last night. Zil
bergeld stressed that "College stu
dents seem to believe that bad
things can't happen to them."
Nonetheless, "Passionate, fun
filled, exciting sex" is still possible
despite the danger of contracting
sexually transmitted diseases, Bay
Area psychologist and author
Lonnie Barbach added.
Stressing that the danger of
contracting a sexually transmitted
disease is greater now than during
the sexual revolution of the 19605,
Zilbergeld said the "sex we helped
bring in is not appropriate for
today."
Barbach echoed Zilbergeld's
concerns. She emphasized that

while the sexual revolution helped
reduce women's inhibitions about
sex, the resulting increase in
sexual activity is dangerous in a
world of rapidly spreading dis
eases such as AIDS. Barbach is
the author of a book on sex titled
"Sharing Intimacies."
"We have to cut down on the
numbers of partners, and we have
to use condoms every time we
have intercourse," Barbach said.
Acknowledging that it is often
difficult for people to raise the
subject of safe sex, both speakers
said it is essential to talk about
sex and contraception with poten
tial sexual partners.
They advised people to raise the
issue early in their relationships,
emphasizing that people need to

they are comfortable with before
a sexual encounter occurs. Both
suggested that people set limits

trying a variety of colors. She also
said that by offering to help a
partner put the condom on, a per
son can reduce the awkwardness
of the moment. People can prac

condoms on zuccinis, she added.
Warning of AIDS, the speakers
strongly cautioned against having
anal sex, and said the risks of
oral sex should also be carefully
considered.
Although people cannot be sure
about their partner's sexual his

evaluate their [partner's] com
mittment to practicing safe sex."

Cowell Student Health Center,
said the purpose of the presenta
tion was to "address safe sex and
smart sex at a little different level
â€” with some practical informa
tion about what to say and when
to say it."
Last night's event at Kresge
Auditorium was titled "Difficult
Choices, Dangerous Times: Rela
tionships and Sexuality in the
'80s," and was sponsored by the
Cowell's contraceptive counselors
and the Women's Health Care
Clinic there.
