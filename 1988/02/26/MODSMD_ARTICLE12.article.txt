Northrop charged with fraud
WASHINGTON — Northrop Corp., already
facing investigations by at least two federal
grand juries over its handling of rmyor Air
Force weapons programs, is under new
scrutiny as a result of allegations that it over
billed the Pentagon by hundreds of millions
of dollars on its largest and most sensitive
program, the top-secret Stealth bomber.
The allegations, contained in a $2 billion
false claims lawsuit filed by four current and
former Northrop employees in Los Angeles,
include charges that the Los Angeles-based
aerospace firm destroyed internal evidence
documenting at least $400 million in overbill
ings, falsified documents submitted to con
gressional investigators and paid high-priced
engineers to do little or no work.
While the Air Force confirmed yesterday
that it has launched an investigation into the
charges, many Wall Street analysts questioned
whether such large-scale fraud could have
taken place. Nevertheless, some said, the
charges represent a new blow to the company,
fueling public perception that Northrop may
be on the verge of becoming what General
Dynamics Corp. was several years ago — the
defense contractor everyone likes to beat up on.
The perception of Northrop as a company
in trouble stems in part from highly publicized
charges that company officials falsified test
data relating to the internal guidance systems
of the MX missile. Evidence of defective
Northrop guidance systems has prompted the
Air Force to withhold $130 million in progress
payments to the company and has triggered
a criminal investigation by the Justice Depart
ment.
Subject in Iran probe quits
WASHINGTON — Alan Fiers, a subject in
an independent counsel's probe of the Iran-
Contra affair, resigned this week as chief of
the Central Intelligence Agency's Central
America Task Force, the intelligence body that
oversees covert U.S. support for Nicaragua
rebels, government sources said yesterday.
Fiers quit the agency, giving little more than
a week's notice, in apparent frustration over
the impact of the White House scandal on his
own career and on the ClA's operational
freedom, according to knowledgeable sources
who asked not to be named.
The 20-year veteran undercover agent re
portedly was offered an "attractive" intelli
gence assignment in Europe but refused it,
deciding instead to leave. Said one source: "He
told them to shove it."
Fiers could not be reached for comment.
Fiers, 48, was one of six agency employees
that CIA Director William Webster disciplined
or fired in December for their involvement in
the Iran-Contra affair. The reason for the mild
sanction levied against him — a reprimand,
which would have been expunged within a few
years — was not made public.
Finance bill appears doomed
WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats yes
terday abandoned get-tough tactics intended
to wear down a Republican filibuster against
campaign-financing legislation but balked at
a GOP effort to overhaul rules that led to the
Tuesday night arrest of Sen. Bob Packwood,
R-Ore., as a fugitive from a quorum call.
After more than 50 hours of continuous
session, enforced by Democrats to end GOP
stalling tactics, the Senate recessed last night.
It is to vote this morning on a final attempt
to curtail debate and force a vote on the bill.
In what appeared to be a death knell for
the legislation this year, Majority Leader
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told the Senate late
Wednesday that he would shelve the bill if,
as expected, he falls short today of the 60
votes necessary to impose cloture on the GOP
filibuster. However, Byrd told the Senate he
may "revisit the issue in some form" before
the year is out.
Democrats have more than enough votes to
pass the bill but concede they probably have
no more than 55 votes to end debate and force
a vote.
In a desultory wind-up of debate, Sen. David
Boren, D-Okla., who co-sponsored the bill with
Byrd, made a last-ditch appeal for compromise
but conceded that negotiations have foundered
on the issue of spending limits for senatorial
campaigns.
The Byrd-Boren bill seeks to limit campaign
spending in a variety of ways, including use
of public funds to help a candidate offset any
spending by an opponent that exceeds volun
tary limits set by the legislation. It also sets
aggregate limits for contributions by political
action committees.
