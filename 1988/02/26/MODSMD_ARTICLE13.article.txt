# Civilian leader fails to oust Noriega
## 
### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama — Presi
dent Eric Delvalle, Panama's nominal
civilian chief of state, tried and failed
yesterday to fire controversial military
strongman Manuel Noriega from his
post as commander of the Defense
Forces of Panama.
In a nationally televised announce
ment, Delvalle said that he had
removed Gen. Noriega and replaced
him with Col. Marcos Justine, chief
of staff and Noriega's second in com
mand of the Defense Forces, this
country's sole military and police or
ganization.
But the military establishment
quickly closed ranks around Noriega,
defying Delvalle's order, and Justine
himself announced that he had
rejected a request by Delvalle that he
take over the military in Noriega's
place.
Still later in the day, Alberto Aleman
Boyd, president of the National As
sembly, ordered legislators to convene
at the legislative Palace to deal with
the crisis. Political observers inter
preted this to mean that the assembly,
dominated by the pro-military Revolu
tionary Democratic Party, would be
asked to remove Delvalle from the of
fice of president.
Unconfirmed reports said that
Defense Forces troops surrounded Del
valle's home here last night.
Delvalle's sharp break with Noriega
came in a taped television appearance
in which the president said that earlier
this week, he had asked Noriega to

"voluntarily" step aside.
"I have not had evidence that my
suggestion has been accepted," the
president said, adding, "I don't have
any choice but to separate Gen.
Noriega from his high post and name
Col. Marcos Justine to replace him."
Delvalle said that he based his de
cision on a combination of factors,
mainly the economic deterioration ex
perienced by Panama during the past
several months and the criminal ac
cusations made against Noriega in the
United States by federal grand juries
that have indicted the strongman for
drug trafficking and related offenses.
"Nothing or no one is above the
well being of Panama," Delvalle
declared.
Saying that this country "is living
the most difficult and dangerous mo
ment in its history," Delvalle listed
the problems confronting this tiny na
tion that is home of the strategic
Panama Canal. These included unem
ployment, inability to pay off foreign
debts, continual street disturbances
and "damage to the image of Panama."
Not long after Delvalle's announce
ment, however, Panama National
Radio, a government-owned station,
broadcast a message that "the entire
command" of the Defense Forces rec
ognize Noriega as "the sole com
mander of the armed institution."
Justine appeared last night on Chan
nel 2, a military-owned television sta
tion, and declared that he had rebuffed
Delvalle's attempt to place him in

charge of the armed forces.
"The president called me ... and told
me he was going to dismiss Gen.
Noriega" and offered the job to the
chief of state, Justine said. "I rejected
the offer," he declared. "We have a
commander who is Gen. Noriega."
Justine asserted that Delvalle had
decided to try to fire Noriega "under
United States pressure."
Soon after Delvalle's announcement
was broadcast in late afternoon, small
crowds gathered in the streets of
Panama City's financial district,
waving white handkerchiefs, a gesture

that has been a symbol of civilian resis
tance to Noriega's rule.
As night fell, however, the streets
of the city appeared to be emptying.
At the Panama Chamber of Com
merce, headquarters of the stiffest civil
opposition to Noriega for the past eight
months, members hurriedly locked
their desks and streamed to their cars
parked outside.
"There is going to be trouble. We
have to go," one of them shouted to
a reporter.
