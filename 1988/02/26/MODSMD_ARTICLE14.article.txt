JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa — Angered by the South
African government's new crack
down on the anti-apartheid move
ment, black church leaders yes
terday called on "the oppressed
to intensify the struggle for justice
and peace." They also pledged to
step up their own protests.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, ur
ging churches to assume the in
terim leadership of the anti
apartheid movement, pledged to
continue the political activities
that the United Democratic
Front, the Congress of South
African Trade Unions and 16
other groups have been prohibited
from taking part in under a state
of emergency.
"We urge the oppressed to in
tensify the struggle for justice and

laration by 12 leading black
churchmen. "For our part, we
commit ourselves to exploring
every possible avenue for continu
ing the activities that have been
banned insofar as we believe they
are mandated by the gospel."
The statement, signed by
leaders of the Anglican, Catholic,
Methodist and Lutheran
churches, along with leaders of
several independent churches and
the South African Council of
Churches, described the new
measures as "a desperate attempt

by weak people to hold onto power
in the face of an ever-increasing
determination by the oppressed
of our country to bring justice,
democracy and peace."
"The government's drastic and
brutal action removes nearly all
effective means open to our people
of working for true change by
peaceful means," the church
leaders said, "and if there is vio
lent reaction, this government
must take the responsibility."
Tutu, the Anglican archbishop
of Cape Town and the 1984 win
ner of the Nobel Peace Prize,
added, "We have nothing to show
for our non-violent approaches. If
violence erupts, what will be sur
prising is that it has taken so
long."
Wednesday, the government
outlawed political activity by the
United Democratic Front, a coa
lition of 750 anti-apartheid groups
with 3 million members, and the
Congress of South African Trade
Unions, the country's largest

members in 13 affiliated unions.
Sixteen other anti-apartheid
and human rights groups, youth
and local civic organizations were
