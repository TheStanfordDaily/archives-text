# Soviets send army units to curb Armenian riots

MOSCOW — Soviet troops have been
sent into the Armenian capital, Yerevan,
to calm a massive nationalist-inspired
demonstration there, according to wit
nesses, but the crowds and the protests
have shown no signs of subsiding as
they begin their second week.
Armen Karen, an Armenian activist,
said in a telephone call from Yerevan
yesterday that Soviet soldiers had been
dispatched to scattered parts of the city
to supplement the local militia deployed
throughout the capital to control the
protests. But neither the urmed militia
nor the military has used violence
against the demonstrators, Karen said.
Two other Armenians arriving here from
Yerevan confirmed the accounts.
The use of Soviet military units and
the presence of four members of the
Soviet leadership in the area indicated
that the demonstrations are occupying
the attention of the key party officials
in Moscow.
The demonstrators formed a commit
tee Wednesday to negotiate with Soviet
authorities and continued to give
speeches in the streets of Yerevan all
day yesterday, Karen said, spurning ap
peals by Kremlin leaders for calm.
Since Armenians in Yerevan first took
to the streets to back an appeal for the

heavily Armenian region of Nagorno-
Karabakh, located in the neighboring
republic of Azerbaijan, to be made part
of Armenia, the city's streets have filled
with growing crowds, Karen and other
Armenian activists said.
Estimates of the number of demon
strators ranged widely, with some as
low as 25,000 and others as high as
200,000. Soviet Foreign Ministry spokes
man Gennady Gerasimov confirmed in
a briefing Wednesday that some dem
onstrations had taken place, but he
declined to give an official estimate of
the number of participants.
Yerevan has been temporarily closed
to foreign journalists, making an inde
pendent estimate impossible.
The protest by Armenian nationalists,
now said to be taking place in several
cities, broke out earlier this month when
Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh took
to the streets to demand that the pre
dominantly Armenian region, incor
porated into the republic of Azerbaijan
by a 1923 Kremlin decision, be reunited
with Armenia.
The protest is a climax of longstanding
tensions between Azerbaijanis and Ar
menians in Nagorno-Karabakh.
