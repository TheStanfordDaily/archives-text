# Bitter internal debate scorches Dole campaign
## 
### 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A bitter
internal dispute in the presidential
campaign of Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan.,
burst into the open yesterday after
campaign chairman William Brock 111
abruptly fired two senior political con
sultants and ordered them off the cam
paign plane.
The consultants, David Keene and
Donald Devine, were fired by Brock
at a private session in a restaurant in
Orlando yesterday morning and were
ordered off the Dole campaign plane
when it reached here a few hours later.
The two immediately summoned
reporters to an airline terminal where
they blasted Brock. Keene described
Brock as "petty" and said his dramatic
action was meant "not just to get rid
of us but to humiliate us." Devine
accused Brock of "a power play" de
signed to show "that he's in charge."
Both men, known as no-holds
barred political infighters, defended
Dole, whom they said had "no choice"
but to accede to Brock's demand that
they be fired, and both said they would
continue to support his candidacy. But
the episode, the latest and most vivid
example of the continuing chaos and
internal turmoil surrounding the Dole

campaign, renewed questions about
Dole's ability to put together a
coherent national organization or a
White House operation if he is elected
in November.
Keene quoted Dole as telling him as
he left the plane this morning, " 'I'll
see you back in Washington. I guess
that's how it has to be. I need your
help.' "
At a news conference, Dole said he
was not aware of the details of the
firings of his two longtime political
associates. "I wasn't part of the con
versation," he said.
Dole described Keene and Devine as
"still friends of mine." Asked what the
episode said about his candidacy, he
replied, "I don't think it says a great
deal."
Brock, a former senator from Ten
nessee and Labor secretary in the
Reagan administration, would not dis
cuss details of his action. Informed of
Keene's comments, he said: "I didn't
do anything to humiliate anyone. I do
intend to run this campaign. I expect
it to be coherent and constructive and
non-divisive."
Brock, who said there will be other
personnel changes, added, "I wish I

could keep the focus on the issues,
but that's hard to do when people hold
their own press conferences. I don't
see how that serves the candidate they
profess to support."
The firing incident climaxed a
tumultuous week for Dole that in
cluded the low point of his campaign
following his loss to Vice President
Bush in the Feb. 8 New Hampshire
primary and the revival of his Jfcirits
with his victories Tuesday in South
Dakota and Minnesota. It also marked
the latest chapter in a running battle
between Brock, who was named cam
paign chairman in November and
brought in his own team of political
operatives, and holdover aides such as
Keene and Devine, who were with Dole
earlier.
Keene, the chairman of the Ameri
can Conservative Union, and Devine,
a former head of the Office of Per
sonnel Management, have strong ties
to the most conservative wing of the
Republican party. Both joined the trav
eling campaign entourage, at Dole's
personal request, last Saturday after
several days in which the gloomy can
didate traveled without the company
of a single senior political adviser and

frequently displayed his anger over the
New Hampshire results.
Keene said Brock's action was ap
parently triggered by a report Tuesday
on the Cable News Network by con
servative columnist Robert Novak,
who described an enlarged role for
Keene and Devine and said they had
"taken over the plane." Arriving that
night in Minneapolis, Keene said he
was called by Brock, who told him:
'"I like the results in South Dakota
and Minnesota and nothing else.
You've done this and I'm going to fix
you.'"
Brock joined the traveling party
Wednesday night in Charlotte, N.C.,
and, according to Keene, refused to
speak to him or Devine. But this morn
ing, while Dole addressed a business
group at Ronnie's Restaurant in Or
lando, Keene said Brock told him,
"'l'm pulling the string. You're
finished.'"
He said Devine then joined them at
a table in the restaurant and was told
by Brock, "'I might as well deal with
both of >ou. This is not going to work.
You are off the payroll as of Thursday.
You're off the plane in Jacksonville."'

campaign chairman William Brock 111
abruptly fired two senior political con
sultants and ordered them off the cam
paign plane.
The consultants, David Keene and
Donald Devine, were fired by Brock
at a private session in a restaurant in
Orlando yesterday morning and were
ordered off the Dole campaign plane
when it reached here a few hours later.
The two immediately summoned
reporters to an airline terminal where
they blasted Brock. Keene described
Brock as "petty" and said his dramatic
action was meant "not just to get rid
of us but to humiliate us." Devine
accused Brock of "a power play" de
signed to show "that he's in charge."
Both men, known as no-holds
barred political infighters, defended
Dole, whom they said had "no choice"
but to accede to Brock's demand that
they be fired, and both said they would
continue to support his candidacy. But
the episode, the latest and most vivid
example of the continuing chaos and
internal turmoil surrounding the Dole

campaign, renewed questions about
Dole's ability to put together a
coherent national organization or a
White House operation if he is elected
in November.
Keene quoted Dole as telling him as
he left the plane this morning, " 'I'll
see you back in Washington. I guess
that's how it has to be. I need your
help.' "
At a news conference, Dole said he
was not aware of the details of the
firings of his two longtime political
associates. "I wasn't part of the con
versation," he said.
Dole described Keene and Devine as
"still friends of mine." Asked what the
episode said about his candidacy, he
replied, "I don't think it says a great
deal."
Brock, a former senator from Ten
nessee and Labor secretary in the
Reagan administration, would not dis
cuss details of his action. Informed of
Keene's comments, he said: "I didn't
do anything to humiliate anyone. I do
intend to run this campaign. I expect
it to be coherent and constructive and
non-divisive."
Brock, who said there will be other
personnel changes, added, "I wish I

could keep the focus on the issues,
but that's hard to do when people hold
their own press conferences. I don't
see how that serves the candidate they
profess to support."
The firing incident climaxed a
tumultuous week for Dole that in
cluded the low point of his campaign
following his loss to Vice President
Bush in the Feb. 8 New Hampshire
primary and the revival of his Jfcirits
with his victories Tuesday in South
Dakota and Minnesota. It also marked
the latest chapter in a running battle
between Brock, who was named cam
paign chairman in November and
brought in his own team of political
operatives, and holdover aides such as
Keene and Devine, who were with Dole
earlier.
Keene, the chairman of the Ameri
can Conservative Union, and Devine,
a former head of the Office of Per
sonnel Management, have strong ties
to the most conservative wing of the
Republican party. Both joined the trav
eling campaign entourage, at Dole's
personal request, last Saturday after
several days in which the gloomy can
didate traveled without the company
of a single senior political adviser and

frequently displayed his anger over the
New Hampshire results.
Keene said Brock's action was ap
parently triggered by a report Tuesday
on the Cable News Network by con
servative columnist Robert Novak,
who described an enlarged role for
Keene and Devine and said they had
"taken over the plane." Arriving that
night in Minneapolis, Keene said he
was called by Brock, who told him:
'"I like the results in South Dakota
and Minnesota and nothing else.
You've done this and I'm going to fix
you.'"
Brock joined the traveling party
Wednesday night in Charlotte, N.C.,
and, according to Keene, refused to
speak to him or Devine. But this morn
ing, while Dole addressed a business
group at Ronnie's Restaurant in Or
lando, Keene said Brock told him,
"'l'm pulling the string. You're
finished.'"
He said Devine then joined them at
a table in the restaurant and was told
by Brock, "'I might as well deal with
both of >ou. This is not going to work.
You are off the payroll as of Thursday.
You're off the plane in Jacksonville."'
