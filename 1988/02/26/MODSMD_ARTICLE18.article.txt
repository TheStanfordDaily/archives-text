## Redo Dead Week 
### 
UNDER the University's cur
rent practice, Dead Week
would more appropriately
be named "Catch-up Week." Cur
rently, professors use the week to
force-feed students all the material
that didn't get covered during the
quarter. Instead, professors should
support the week's true purpose:
to allow students time for serious
review of course materials.
Last year, the Faculty Senate
decided that finals may not be
given during Dead Week. But this
alone has obviously not created a
true week donated first and
foremost to finals preparation.
The senate must go even fur
ther. It should require that no new
material be covered and no
homework be due during Dead
Week. The respite from the usual
academic obligations would give
students a chance to prepare ade
quately for their final exams.
Right now, every professor has
his or her own Dead Week policy.
Most of the humanities faculty
devote Dead Week to review and
exam preparation. But many in
structors in engineering and the
sciences teach until the last day of
classes â€” and sometimes they
teach more in Dead Week than in
the average week.
These instructors claim they
need all 10 weeks of the quarter
to cover their material and that
there is no time left for review. As
a result, they rarely wrap up the
main concepts of their courses;
they simply arrange for question

and-answer review sessions with
teaching assistants.
The time limitations of the quar
ter system force instructors to
proceed as scheduled even when
their students would like to spend
more time on a specific subject.
The students are denied the chance
to an overall perspective of the the
course and the necessary review
time. Instead, the students are
tested only days after the last lec
ture.
The result is that students'
retention of knowledge is primarily
short-term.
The instructors who feel pres
sured by the quarter system should
include less material in their
courses or distribute it more evenly
among the first nine weeks of the
quarter. The departments should
be willing to adjust the content of
the follow-up courses or offer more
units of credit.
For their part, students should
refrain from requesting to take
finals during Dead Week in order
to extend their holiday break. They
should be prepared to stay here
until the last day of the quarter.
Rescheduling should be limited to
exceptional cases, such as conflicts
with another exam. Dead Week
should be for review, and students
must understand this before they
expect the faculty to accept it.
The University as a whole would
benefit if students and faculty
cooperated to make Dead Week a
time to look back at the quarter,
a time to draw lessons before the
climactic end comes.
