# University considers interview restrictions
## Recruiters who discriminate may be barred 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said yesterday he is "very
seriously" considering a recent
ASSU recommendation to refuse
employers who legally discrimi
nate the right to recruit on
campus.
Currently, the University al
lows employers who are permitted
by law to discriminate on the basis
of sexual orientation — such as
the CIA, armed forces and other
federal government agencies — to
use Career Planning and Place
ment Center facilities to recruit
students.
Lyons said he hopes to resolve
the issue by the end of spring
quarter, and added that he and
CPPC Director Ruth Snyder are
studying the problem.
The long-running fight for a
comprehensive anti-discrim
inatory recruitment policy
received a boost two weeks ago
when the ASSU Senate passed a
bill by a vote of 17-2 that encour
ages the University to change its
policy.
The University modified its
recruitment policy in December
1986 by adding a "sexual orien

tation" clause. But by also adding
the qualifying term "unlawful,"
the policy provides a loophole for
those employers who lawfully dis
criminate.
By allowing those employers
access to University recruiting
facilities, Stanford is "aiding and
abetting discriminadon," accord
ing to senior Daniel Bao, a press
representative for the Stanford
Organization for Lesbian and Gay
Equality.
"The CP PC is, in effect, saying
that discrimination is bad, but
we'll look the other way as long
as it's legal," Bao said.
However, Lyons argues that
"The University should not
restrict students access to
employers, even ones that dis
criminate."
Graduate senator Richard
Vaughan, who drafted the ASSU
bill, said that even if the CPPC
did not allow employers that law
fully discriminate to use its
facilities, they would still be able
to recruit students off campus.
But Vaughan emphasized that
this fact should not discourage
the University from taking a
strong stand against employers
who discriminate. "A change in
CPPC policy would not limit stu

dent access to employers. It would
just limit discriminatory
employers' access to CPPC
facilities that are currently of
fered to recruiters free of charge,"
Vaughan said.
"It's an ethical issue, and Stan
ford should take a stand," he said.
According to Bao, the reason
the University has not yet
changed the recruitment policy is
its fear of alienating the federal
government and losing research
funding.
Indeed, Lyons said Snyder un
covered a federal regulation that
might make the University in
eligible for federal funding if the
recruitment policy is changed to
restrict on-campus armed forces
recruitment.
Vaughan argued that the non
discriminatory policies of the
Graduate School of Business and
the Law School, which unlike the
University's recruitment policy
prohibit even lawful discrimina
tion by recruiters, already give the
federal government a reason to
reduce funding to Stanford.
Vaughan added that there is no
precedent to suggest that the
federal government will cut off
funding if the University recruit
ment policy is changed.
Bao and Vaughan said that by
taking a stance against such dis
crimination, University President
Donald Kennedy and the admin
istration are in a position to es
tablish Stanford as a moral leader
in the academic community.
The University's anti-dis
crimination stance — which af
fects both student admissions as
well as employment University
wide — has undergone several
changes in the past year. Last
June, the University modified this
policy to include a clause prohibit
ing discrimination based on
sexual orientation. However, Uni
versity recruitment policy is a sep
arate issue.
