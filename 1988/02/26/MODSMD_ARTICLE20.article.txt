## A 						case for humanism 
### 
Sometimes the u.s Supreme
Court takes decisive action by doing
absolutely nothing.
Five years ago, Tennessee homemaker
Vicki Frost was helping her daughter
with homework when she noticed the
story "A Visit to Mars" in the sixth grade
Holt, Rinehart and Winston primer. To
Frost, the tale seemed un-Christian and
contrary to Biblical teachings.
She asked Hawkins County school of
ficials to provide other, more wholesome
texts or to excuse her child from the
class. The officials refused. She and a
handful of other parents sued; they
claimed that "forcing" children to read
the nasty Holt series would violate their
First Amendment right to free exercise
of religion, and they demanded that other
suitable books be purchased especially
for their children.
God help us.
The fundamentalists won. At first. U.S.
District Court Judge Thomas Hull, after
twice dismissing similar civil suits, found
for the plaintiffs. Schools, he ruled, would
just have to cater to these small sects of
Bible-thumpers.
Let's back up a step. You might think,
"Hey, maybe those textbooks were
genuinely controversial ones for a sixth
grade audience — Stephen King short
stories, 'Mein Kampf,' that stuff." Nope.
Here, rather, are the sorts of ideas and
texts Vicki Frost and the fun fundamen
talists deemed so very satanic, and why.
"The Wizard of Oz": This infamous
piece of smut deals with magic, portrays
some witches as good and — worst of all
— presents the human qualities of
courage, wisdom and fortitude as being

self-developed rather than God-given.
Evolution: Enough said.
The Italian Renaissance: During this
historical period, "secular humanism" —
that catchall bogeyman phrase meaning
anything offensive to fundamentalists —
first developed, and therefore Leonardo
da Vinci and his contemporaries should
not be celebrated, if mentioned at all.
The metric system: This promotes
"one-world government," which, as all of
us Bible scholars know from the book of
Revelations, characterizes the rule of the
Anti-Christ.
Equality of the sexes: Frost tearfully
told Judge Hull that her daughter would
never be a feminist because, of course,
God meant for women to be subservient
to men. She even objected to a first grade
reader that bore an illustration of a boy
preparing food while a girl reads to him
from a cookbook. Females reading to
males? Males cooking? To Vicki Frost,
that constituted a satanic reversal of the
gender roles ordained by God.
"Freddy Found a Frog," a story in a
second grade Holt reader: Freddy chose
to release his frog rather than to eat it
as his neighbors suggested. Such stories,
Frost testified, could "seduce a child into
a belief in disarmament." Huh? You fig
ure it out.
"The Diary of Anne Frank": Implies
that all religions are valid. Frost objected:
"Diary" fails to acknowledge Jesus Christ
as the only means of salvation.
The list goes on, kids, but I won't. As
Indiana University Education Prof. Ed
ward Jenkinson pointed out last year,
Judge Hull's ruling left crucial questions
unanswered: "Must a public school ac-

comodate 'beliefs' — whatever the size
of the group of believers? Or is the pur
pose of a public school to expose students
to a variety of beliefs, to the thoughts
of humankind as reflected in literature,
in society and in politics?"
The U.S. Court of Appeals in Cincin
nati answered in August. By a vote of
3-0, it overturned Judge Hull's decision,
ruling in essence that students can be
required to read, although not to affirm,
materials that offend their religious
beliefs.
Frost & Co. appealed to the U.S. Su
preme Court. And just this Monday, the
Supreme Court refused even to hear the
case — which means the fundamentalists
lose. Anybody wanna buy some torches,
cheap?
Vicki Frost, in her righteous anger,
may be off visiting Mars. But as for sixth
graders back on Earth, in Tennessee,
they're off to read the "Wizard."
