## Coverage of Achebe, Smeal reflects bad priorities 
### 
I WAS DISAPPOINTED to find, on
picking up the Feb. 16 Daily that
the coverage of Chinua Achebe's
visit appeared on such a small scale.
Achebe is a figure of tremendous
literary stature, not only with respect
to his own country — Nigeria — but
also with respect to the entire African
and Afro-American community and the
world at large.
The article on Achebe's talk was a
short piece, and though The Daily
afforded it front page status, the paper
placed the article in the bottom left
hand corner. The headline did not
include Achebe's name. Most strikingly,
no photograph appeared.
A week earlier, Eleanor Smeal,
former president of the National Or
ganization for Women, came to speak

to the Stanford community. Smeal,
having run NOW from 1977 to 1982
and having been involved in numerous
campaigns, is a woman of prominent
standing in the political world.
Thg Daily, however, gave little
recojjihition to her visit. Coverage of
the event was given over to the inside
pages. Again, no photograph appeared,
though anyone who was at the event
would most surely remember the two
photographers who distractedly walked
up and down the length of Rresge's
stage. Were neither of these photogra
phers from The Daily? If not, why not,
and if so, where are these pictures?
In choosing where and how it'runs
various articles and photographs, a
paper must make choices regarding its
priorities based on the importance of

competing interests and events that
arise for the issue of that particular
day.
If this is the case with the Feb. 16
issue (the day of Achebe's write up),
then how might The Daily justify
running an enourmous photograph
(absorbing the entire top left quadrant
of the paper) of a Stanford student
performing a dance piece and yet
present no photograph of Achebe?
Are we so consumed by our own
student events and talents that we
give them significantly more coverage
than an outside speaker of greater
standing? I would ask our campus
newspaper to reconsider its priorities.
It seems The Daily has done a dis
service to the community in failing to
report with more recognition the

events of Achebe's and Smeal's visit.
Though it did print a book review of
Achebe's latest novel, prior to the
author's arrival, the paper would have
done well to provide more substantive
follow-up acknowledging Achebe's
actual presence on campus — for those
who were unaware of the event, for
those who knew about it but could not
attend and for the more than capacity
crowd who packed their way into
Branner's dining hall.
More importantly, I feel The Daily
has done a disservice to Achebe and to
Smeal. Stanford was lucky to have had
these individuals come to our campus
and speak. Such poor recognition does
little to show our gratitude.
