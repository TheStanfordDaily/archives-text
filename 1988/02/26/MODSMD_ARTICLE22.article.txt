# The
						Axe Committee didn't desert Card
## 
### 
The letter in yesterday's Daily, "Axe
Comm jilts Farm," is based, not on
fact, but on assumption and inference.
First, the Axe Committee did not
desert its seats to get a better view of
the game. We did not have seats in
the Stanford section at all.
A month and a half before the game,
we sought tickets through the Stanford
ticket office. We were told there were
no tickets left. At this point, we con
tacted the California Rally Committee
with whom we have a friendly rivalry
and asked if they could get us into the
game.
The Rally Committee, by using some
of their own tickets, was able to get us
into Harmon Gym. However, the only
seats available to us in the otherwise
sold-out arena were those in the
Berkeley student section where the

Berkeley Rally Committee sits.
We attempted to sit in the Stanford
section, but as the section filled with
persons holding reserved seat tickets, it
was clear there would be no room.
Therefore we sat with the Rally Com
mittee (near the rafters!), taking much
abuse in the process.
Second, far from being "fair weather
fans," the Axe Committee displayed
vociferous support for the Cardinal
from the Berkeley section.
Our departure from the Berkeley
section back to the Stanford section
was for safety reasons, since the game
was taking a distinct turn against
Berkeley. When sitting back in the
Stanford area, we took seats of
Berkeley fans who had already
departed, and, with the help of Stan
ford Band, symbolically tore up a
Berkeley sweatshirt.
Finally, our support for Stanford
athletics is undeniable. We are always
a loud and significant force at Stanford
men's and women's basketball games,

and to suggest that we are "fair
weather fans" is clearly without merit
