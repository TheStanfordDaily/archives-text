## Riders horse around in new barn 
### Ken Ziegler 
The smell of new plywood and oat hay have
masked the horse stench usually associated
with what has become known at Stanford as
"the Old Barn."
A smaller counterpart to the famous Red
Barn owned by Senator Leland Stanford in
the late 1800s, the Old Barn is no longer old
— or smelly.
According to senior Cheryl House, an avid
horse rider, the Old Barn, located off West
Campus Drive, was badly in need of complete
restoration. "It was awful, the roof leaked
everywhere, and the walls between some of
the stalls had fallen apart," she said, adding
that the floors in the old facility had been
dangerously uneven, making it especially dif
ficult to maneuver horses.
But after about four months of work the
Old Barn was completely redone from the
foundation up. The "new" Old Barn has 39
stalls and is roughly twice the size of its
predecessor. The renovated barn will not only
shelter University-owned horses but two gel
dings acquired in the last two weeks by the
Stanford equestrian team.
House is the team's president, and has rid
den with the group since it became a club
sport at Stanford in the fall of last year. Never
having owned her own horse, House said that
the Stanford stables offered her the unique
opportunity to compete while enjoying regular
riding as well.
With the loss of two separate coaches and
the demand of upkeeping the dying Old Barn,
House and the 30 other members overcame
a difficult trial year and have become a com
petitive equestrian team that means business.
All six of the Stanford riders who competed
in a national show at the University of Texas
came home with at least one ribbon last quar
ter. Last May, in an invitational show held
here, the team placed second in overall com
petition and had the top individual English
style rider.
"It's really special the way everyone has
worked together," House said, looking back
on the team's progress over the past year.
A welcome arrival to the growing team are
Cat and Jeremy — a pair of brown geldings.
In the past, the equestrians have ridden on
borrowed horses at intercollegiate shows.
"They mean so much to the team," said
senior Rebecca Dyson, a team member who
has enjoyed riding since the age of four. "Now
people without their own horse have a better
chance to work out regularly."

While Dyson and seven other team members
own or lease their own horses, most riders
practice on horses housed by the University.
Within the next few weeks, the team hopes
to obtain two more horses.
In the Bay Area, upkeep for a horse costs
about $350 a month. This hefty sum makes
team fundraising a high priority. The team
has worked since last November organizing
a brunch and an auction, held last Saturday,
that celebrated the opening of the new barn
and raised money for the team as well. Along
with meeting financial needs, the equestrians
spent much of last spring quarter upkeeping
and upgrading the barn. Although they have
a new, clean barn the team is still busy keeping
the horses groomed and blanketed.
Under the leadership of their new coach,
Constance Kilmartin, a trainer and riding in

structor at nearby Portola Farms riding
school, the team is progressing steadily.
"She's very positive and encouraging . . .
and very firm about the care of the horses.
We have to be more careful than most teams
because our equipment is alive," House said.
Judging for equestrian shows is divided into
two different styles, Western and English.
The differences in the styles date back to
their beginnings — a need for smooth led to
the English and the use of horses to herd
stock animals developed the Western style. In
competition, both riding styles have six com
petition classes designed to test the form of
the horse and the rider on flat terrain, over
fences and around obstacles.
"The English style is what we do most of,"
House explained. "Not many people ride both
styles since they're so different, and the horses
are trained English, too."

The differences in the styles date back to
their beginnings — a need for smooth led to
the English and the use of horses to herd

the horse and the rider on flat terrain, over
fences and around obstacles.
"The English style is what we do most of,"
House explained. "Not many people ride both
styles since they're so different, and the horses
are trained English, too."
