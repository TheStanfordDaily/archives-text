# Teaser intoxicated by catchy beer ads
## 
### Paul de Figueiredo Staff writer 
The beer advertising indus
try is going to the dogs — and
Spuds MacKenzie is leading the
way.
In the never ending series of
jingles, slogans and mascots
that American breweries
parade before the public in an

effort to gain a bigger piece of
the multi-million dollar beer
drinking market, Spuds, a 47
pound, black-eyed, pear-shaped
English bull terrier is An
heuser Busch's latest advertis
ing gimmick — and a very suc
cessful gimmick at that.
Although for the last 10
years beer consumption in the
United States has steadily
decreased, Anheuser Busch's
share of the beer producing
market has almost doubled.
The company is now the largest
brewery in America, if not the
world, and produces 40 percent
of all beer consumed in the U.S.
Anheuser Busch's success is
due largely to a tried and true
marketing strategy — divide
and conquer. Busch targets
their products to specific con
sumers: military personnel,
blue-collar workers, Yuppies
and, of course, sports fans.
Spuds MacKenzie, whose
real name is Honey Tree Evil
Eye, is a product of Anheuser
Busch's efforts to appeal to the
younger beer drinking crowd.
In 1984 Anheuser Busch
Publicity Manager Bill Strol

berg noticed that a poster
featuring Spuds on a fraternity
sweatshirt was extremely
popular. Strolberg quickly
placed Spuds at the head of
Bud Light's national advertis
ing campaign, resulting in an
unprecedented increase in Bud
Light sales.
While an effective mascot is
one element in a successful ad
vertising campaign, catchy beer
slogans are also crucial.
But are these slogans really
effective? See if you can iden
tify the beer and wine cooler
slogans below. Then send your
answers to Brain Teaser c/o
The Stanford Daily, Storke
Publications Building, Stan
ford, Ca 94305. A winner will
be selected at random from the
correct solutions and will
receive a $10 gift certificate
from Unwind, a toy store in
