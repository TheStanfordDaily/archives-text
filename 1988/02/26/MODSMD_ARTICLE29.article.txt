"The Grand Highway"
Aquarius
430 Emerson Ave.
Palo Alto
"The Grand Highway" is a
movie of the "small boy growing
up" genre, a French version of
"My Life as a Dog." It offers the
same appealing blend of humor
and sadness, and it offers it in
the same package.
A boy, Louis, is sent to live in
a small town for a few weeks. He
makes friends with a tomboyish
local girl who bosses him around
and shows him all the best hiding
places.
He learns some lessons about
love, sex and violence, and at the
movie's climax he has a minor
emotional breakdown that brings
all the other characters together.
The ending is bittersweet — but
a little heavy on the sweet. Sound
familiar?
The material is old and well
worn, but apparently still work
able. We've seen this movie
several times before, but it's still
delightful.
The pleasures this genre of
movie offers are small, sweet
pleasures, more like candy than

a full nourishing meal, but there
are times for pleasures like that.
If you like the "small boy growing
up" genre, "The Grand Highway"
is a sure thing.
The actors are exceptional and
unpretentious; Louis is a wistful,
shy boy with great appeal —
children in movies are seldom shy,
and it's refreshing to see a movie
about a child who is not outgoing
or funny.
The adult characters also seem
realistic and appealing, but not
without their truly ugly quirks.
The town is picturesque and beau
tiful, and all the earthy details
are beautiful.
This film isn't as sophisticated
or as moving as "My Life as a
Dog"; it just doesn't pack the
same kind of emotional punch.
Nonetheless, it's a cute and en
joyable show.

"Ironweed"
Century Cinema
Sticrlin Rd. at Fwy 101
Mountain View
Francis Phelan is a man relent
lessly plagued by that which he
hates most — death. Everyone he

comes into contact with seems to
die, whether it be an enemy,
friend, or infant son.
This curse drives him ever
downward into the heart of
Depression-Era America in Hec
tor Babenco's powerful but sadly
uncompelling film "Ironweed."
This adaptation of the Pulitzer
Prize winning novel by William
Kennedy (who also wrote the
screenplay) creates a dreary and
starkly beautiful image of Albany
in 1938. Babenco, as he did in
"Kiss of the Spider Woman,"
mixes such an oppressive environ
ment with mysterious trips of the
imagination. Unlike this earlier
film, however, here the fantasies
become nightmares rather than
escapes, weakening both Francis
and his lover Helen to the threats
of the real world, driving them
into, rather than saving them
from, insanity.
"Ironweed" centers around the
life of Francis (Jack Nicholson),
a former Big-League ball player
who deserts his family after acci
dentally killing his infant son. He
is joined in a decline into the
world of street bums by Helen
(Meryl Streep) who leaves behind
a promising career as a performer

in order to stay with him.
The most powerful parts of
"Ironweed" are Babenco's sup
position of reality and imagina
tion. Francis cannot control his
lapses into insanity, as all of those
he has killed return to pull him
further away from his only ves
tiges of true life. His visions are
filmed in a haunting golden light
which accents the surreal quality
of the scene when contrasted with
the gritty, dark nature of the rest
of the film.
Helen, instead of running from
the past as Francis is forced to
do, plunges into it as an escape
from the present. She falls into
dreams of lost glory, success as a
singer, only to become less able
to deal with the horrors of her
true situation. Babenco handles
all these sequences masterfully,
drawing the audience into each
dream, and making one feel the
brutal oppression of reality upOn
return.
Just as in "Kiss of the Spider
Woman," Babenco maximizes the
effect of color, texture and light
ing to contribute to the dreary
mood of "Ironweed." Much of the
credit must also go to his
cinematographer, Lauro Escorel,
for maintaining such control over
the subtleties of these visuals, as
well as for magnifiscent tracking
shots, moving over, in or around
scenes with a mysterious omnis
cience.
The performances of Nicholson
and Streep are definitely up to
their usual par of excellence. Nic
holson manages to bring life to
his somewhat stereotypical role
as the 'dignified' bum, and

Streep's decline into alcoholic in
sanity is all too realistic. A great
addition to this duo is Tom Waits
("Down by Law") who seems to
be right at home next to these
two superstars in his role as the
lovably childlike bum, Rudy.
Virtually every aspect of Baben
co's film seems to have been
meticulously controlled to reach
a state of debauched perfection,
and yet the film as a whole does
not reflect this. Despite excellent
writing, direction and individual
performances, "Ironweed" is not
the gripping film it should be.
What is lacking is any true
feeling between the characters.
There is no basic connection of
personalities to carry the story,
resulting in little feeling between
viewer and film. There is little or
no impact when characters love,
fight or even die, making the film
feel fiat and lifeless.
Redemption is found however
in the dream sequences, for here
the characters come alive, perhaps
because they are relating to them
selves rather than others. One
honestly feels the fear or relief
which the fantasies provide, and
the incredible helplessness upon
their return to reality.
Indeed, "Ironweed" is by no
means a bad film. Babenco has
created a visual feast from Ken
nedy's novel, and the perform
ances of Nicholson, Streep and
Waits add a strong charisma to
the entire production. The lack of
dynamism between characters is
just a small blemish in what
otherwise must be considered a
powerful and enthralling film.

"Shoot to Kill"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Rd at Fwy 101
Mountain View
After many years, Sidney
Poitier is finally in a movie again,
and he's made a pretty good corn
back in the film, "Shoot to Kill."
Unfortunately, Poitier is about
the only good thing in the movie.
He plays a tough FBI agent who
teams up with a tough mountain
man (played with excessive
broodiness by Tom Berenger) to
track down a killer who has kid
napped Berenger's tough
girlfriend (Kirstie Alley).
The toughness pretext here is
supposed to mean that there's
going to be a lot of action and
violence, and there is, but it
doesn't seem to be enough. This
is supposed to be an action-thriller
but, although there are some good
stunts, everything moves at a
snail's pace.
Too much time is spent con
trasting the city-boy ignorance of
the wilderness of Poitier and the
hearty, backwoods common sense
of Berenger. They're too busy in
sulting each other that they never
have time to develop any sort of
believable relationship.
For some reason, critics are
comparing this movie to "Lethal
Weapon," but the only thing
similar about these two action
thrillers is that a black guy teams
up with a white guy to stop a
killer. Other than that, "Shoot to
Kill" has very little action and too
few thrills.
