# Inspection of student computer accounts to increase
## 
### Jay Bhattacharya Staff writer 
The director of Academic Information
Resources announced last night that AIR
has decided to adopt stricter guidelines
for the inspection of private student com
puter accounts.
Junior Perry Friedman, a LOTS em
ployee, said that prior to this meeting,
there were "no set guidelines" on the
reading of files or electronic mail by AIR
officials.
Director Ralph Gorin, who is also a
computer science professor, said while
policies regarding privacy of accounts

"don't need to be changed, procedures
do."
At an AIR "town meeting," Gorin said
that if AIR staff members wish to exam
ine an account, they must now get per
mission in writing from either an AIR
superior or a peer before doing so.
Gorin also said AIR will notify students
opening new accounts of the policy re
garding privacy of accounts, at the time
the account is opened.
Gorin justified the right of AIR, which
controls all instructional computer re
sources at the University, to look into
private files and electronic mail. "Ac
counts will not be read unless there is

there is a suspicion of wrongdoing," he
said.
According to Gorin, AIR might wish
to inspect an account if they suspect in
appropriate use of computer resources
for commercial purposes, illegal use of
an account by someone other than the
account owner, or illegal collaboration on
a project by an instructor.
However, Gorin said that students will
not necessarily be notified that their ac
counts are being examined either prior
to or after AIR investigations.
"There is no obligation on our part to
inform a person that their account is
under scrutiny," he said.
Gorin argued that the notification

policy is warranted because of the pos
sibility that an allegation against a stu
dent might be untrue. "We want to spare
the student the embarrasment of a for
mal charge if the charge is baseless,"
Gorin said.
In the case of actual violations of policy,
Gorin said it is AlR's responsibility to
reveal all information to which it has
access, even if it means examination of
private accounts.
He stressed, however, that in many of
these cases, actual prosecution takes
place by the Judicial Council and not
AIR. "AIR is not in the position of .. .
downgrading anyone," he said.

During the question-and-answer por
tion of the meeting, an audience member
asked whether AlR's ability to search
accounts violated the section of the honor
code that prohibits proctoring of ex
aminations.
Gorin replied the AIR policy does not
violate the honor code because the code
applies only to examinations.
"If honor code violations are alleged,
we must do all we can to open up the
circumstances," he said.
Gorin said that during an investigation,
only files relevant to the inquiry will be
examined. "All files are private. Only with
great reluctance do we search accounts."
