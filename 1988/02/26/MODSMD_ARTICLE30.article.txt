# Interview
## Director uses 1960s as subject 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
Steve Kovaks has hit the big
leagues as the writer-director of
his first major film, " '68,"
which follows the struggles of
a Hungarian family living in
San Francisco whose lives are
shaped by some of the
events of 1968.
Kovaks is no stranger to the
Bay Area; he was a professor of
communication at Stanford
where he taught film history
and theory from 1973 to 1977.
After being nominated for an
Oscar for his documentary, "Ar
thur and Lillie," Kovaks moved
to Hollywood where he worked
as a producer for Roger Corman
at New World pictures.
Kovaks spoke to The Daily
about his new film:
Daily: Why did you choose
1968 to be the subject matter
of your first film?
Kovaks: I think it's very im
portant for us to re-create those
very exciting years. 1968 was a
year in which so much was hap
pening â€” the Robert Kennedy
and Martin Luther King assas
sinations, our involvement with
Vietnam . . . there was more
idealism. In some ways, things
haven't changed. There are is
sues which are still relevant.
Back then it was Vietnam. Now,
it's Central America.

Daily: Did you base the
movie's story on any real life
experiences?
Kovaks: I'm Hungarian by
background, I came here in 1956
and worked in San Francisco.
Although the film isn't
autobiographical, I was familiar
with the background of what it
was like.

Daily: Are you
satisfied with the
way the film turned
out?
in
Kovaks: There are
always things you
wish you could have
done differently.

Daily: Is that why you chose
a Hungarian family as your sub
jects?
Kovaks: Yes, I think an out
sider can see things as they hap
pen more accurately.
Daily: Did you have any prob
lems getting the film made?
Kovaks: Well, the film was
totally independent and there

was no studio backing. We had
to go out and raise the money
ourselves. People liked the story
and had faith in us as film
makers and that's how we got
money. New World didn't step
in to distribute the film until
after it was shot and after it
had its first preview.
Daily: Are you satisfied with
the way the film turned out?
Kovaks: As a filmmaker,
you're never really satisfied.
There are always things you
wish you could have done dif
ferently. My biggest challenge
was making sure the events of
the time didn't overwhelm the
story I was trying to tell. But
I think it turned out well.
Daily: What are some of your
plans for the future?
Kovaks: I'm currently writing
a comedy, but until I get some
of the details worked out, I can't
discuss it.
Daily: What do you think of
the film program here at Stan
ford?
Kovaks: It may not be as
popular as USC or UCLA, but
it's a good program. It gives you
a good background that one
needs to go on further.
Daily: How do you look back
on your time here at Stanford?
Kovaks: It's where I started
making films. I made my first
documentary there. Stanford is
a very important place for me.
