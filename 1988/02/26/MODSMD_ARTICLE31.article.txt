# Movie Review
## '68 doesn't come alive 
### Jennifer Reese Staff writer 
Old academics tend to remem
ber 1968 with horror and bitter
ness. Those who were younger at
the time, primarily students, may
remember it with nostalgia, as a
time of liberation, shared ideals
and community.
"'6B" is a movie that will gratify
the "true believers" and irritate
all cynics and skeptics. It isn't
the unsentimental and intelligent
look at the 60s that would refresh
us all and draw the disparate
threads together. Instead, it's an
other clumsy, incoherent celebra
tion of the period's radicalism and
"spirit."
The film centers on a Hun
garian immigrant's family run
ning a restaurant in San Fran
cisco. There's a portly, domineer
ing father (Sandor Tecsi) who
believes in all the conservative
ideals: the capitalist system, the
Vietnam War, education as the
means to success. He is also racist,
sexist and authoritarian.
His two sons (filmed to look
strangely tiny against this im
mense man) are prone to the
changes occurring in the society,
and this movie is an exploration
of the conflict that develops as
the older son, Peter (Eric Larson),
becomes politically radical, and
the younger son, Sandy (Robert
Locke), becomes gay.
There is no central plot; the

movie consists of loosely bound
episodes illustrating certain
points about the societal change
and the generational conflict.
The film has no real spine; it
seems to meander from incident
to incident, never building much
dramatic intensity. No character
becomes the central focus, making
the movie hard to hook into.
Peter, the older son, is a free
lance journalist studying at UC-
Berkeley. He explores the Bay
Area, taking in all the odd hap
penings. He meets a blond motor
cycle girl and they have sex on a
motorcycle on a cliff against a
sunlit sky; he gets stoned at a
rock concert; he campaigns for
Bobby Kennedy; he is radicalized
by an angry Chinese woman
whom he falls for. These events
are only loosely strung together.
Meanwhile, his brother Sandy
gets engaged to the daughter of
a family friend, Vera (Terra Van
dergaw), but breaks off the en
gagement when he realizes he's
gay. He escapes the draft by an
nouncing his homosexuality when
he goes in for his physical, then
kisses an officer on the mouth to
prove it, which results in the
clumsiest and most embarrassing
scene in the movie.
One of the biggest problems
with the film is the abcense of
any appealing characters to draw
us in. None of the actors are par
ticularly interesting to watch.
Indeed, a few of the characters

One of the biggest

characters.

are downright annoying.
Alana (Miran Kwun), Peter's
radical girlfriend, is unpleasant
every time she comes on the
screen, which makes it hard to
understand why Peter falls for
her. She spouts off revolutionary
rhetoric and sneers con
temptuously at almost everyone.
In its skewed way the film
makes her out to be some sort of
heroine, bearing the moral weight
of the film, keeping Peter honest.
But she's shrill and preachy, not
warm or charismatic enough to
like. She grated on my nerves bad
ly.
The movie is full of messages
and observations, but it's all sadly
garbled. Because the focus shifts
so often the film doesn't really
hang together, which wouldn't
matter if there were more inter
esting characters to keep us
watching with emotion or inter
est. Cliche follows cliche; this film
says nothing new about the 60s,
or about anything else.
