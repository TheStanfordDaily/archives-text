## Card sharpshooting sinks Ducks, 84-61 Taylor-made victory 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Like a mistaken identity plot twist
in a network sitcom, when the real
Taylor was asked to stand up last
night in Maples Pavilion, both An
thony and Terry rose for the occa
sion.
But in the end, Stanford's scrawny

Terry Taylor got the first and last laugh as the
Cardinal whipped the visiting Oregon Ducks 84-61
in front of a crowd of 6,642.
The Cardinal's Taylor snapped out of a three
game scoring drought with sharpshooting from
three-point land to tally 18 points on the night.
And although Oregon's Anthony Taylor topped that
with 22 points, Terry's contributions were simply
more valuable.
The victory kept Stanford in a second-place tie
with Oregon State in the Pacific 10 Conference and
sets up tomorrow's 3 p.m. showdown with the
Beavers. The Cardinal's record now stands at 18-8
overall, 10-5 in the Pac-10, while Oregon falls to
13-11, 8-7.
"Terry's three-point goals at the beginning gave
us a lift," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"We felt prepared for the zone (defense) and I felt
like we attacked it well."
While Anthony Taylor barely topped his Pac-10
leading 20.5 points per game average, Terry Taylor
pumped in almost 10 more points than his confer
ence norm.
Taylor's outburst, however, was just one spoke
in an impressively balanced Cardinal scoring attack.
Center Greg Butler had 16 points, guard Todd
Lichti chipped in 17, Taylor bombed for 18, and
forward Howard Wright muscled inside for a team
high 19.
"We ran our regular zone offense and tried to
see where the holes were," Taylor said. "If we got
the open shot we took it." And with the Ducks
collapsing inside, Taylor was often the lucky open
man.
In front of a late-night national television audi
ence on ESPN, Stanford blazed out to a 31-13 lead
midway through the first half, and the Fighting
Ducks never got closer than 12 points the rest of
the way.
"It helped us to come out and open up like the
way we did," Montgomery said. "With the lead, it
was nice to be allowed to still make some mistakes
and win."
The Cardinal triumph reversed an 80-66 Duck
victory in Eugene last month.
"It all depends on who's ready to play. We showed
that tonight," Anthony Taylor said after the game.
"We were not ready to play."
Stanford, on the other hand, was more than ready
to go. On the Cardinal's first posession, Howard
Wright had a lay-in and was fouled, and in the next
three minutes Taylor and Lichti hit three-pointers
and Lichti drove in for a three-point play.
With only 3:27 gone in the game, Stanford led
14-5 and the Ducks looked deflated.
"We were really pumped up for this game," Stan
ford forward Bryan McSweeney said. "The nerves

were there."
McSweeney was one of four Cardinal players who
were assigned to control Taylor. It's close to im
possible to stop the Ducks senior guard (before the
game New York Knick scout Dick McGuire said
Taylor may be a first-round NBA pick). Taylor was
covered at one point or another by McSweeney,
Lichti, Scott Meinert and Oliver Cunningham.
"Although he got a lot of points, it took some
time," Montgomery said of Taylor. "We were able
to put McSweeney on him and Bryan's size helped."
Stanford's size with Wright and Butler helped
inside as well, and when the Ducks' defense sagged
too much the Cardinal kicked the ball out to Lichti

and Taylor who canned from the perimeter. On the
night, Stanford shot 57 percent from the field.
On the other end of the court, Oregon was not
able to establish the inside game which helped the
Ducks beat Stanford last time. The Ducks' starting
front line of Randy Grant, Keith Balderston and
Brett Coffey combined for only 17 points.
"The difference was that (at Oregon) we came
out fiat and didn't play hard," Butler said. "A lot
of teams are different — better — at home and
that was the case with Oregon."
In other Pac-10 games, UCLA beat Washington
97-87, Oregon State defeated California 65-54 and
Washington State beat USC 67-57.

Ducks beat Stanford last time. The Ducks' starting
front line of Randy Grant, Keith Balderston and
Brett Coffey combined for only 17 points.
"The difference was that (at Oregon) we came
out fiat and didn't play hard," Butler said. "A lot
of teams are different — better — at home and
that was the case with Oregon."
In other Pac-10 games, UCLA beat Washington
97-87, Oregon State defeated California 65-54 and
Washington State beat USC 67-57.

Like a mistaken identity plot twist
in a network sitcom, when the real
Taylor was asked to stand up last
night in Maples Pavilion, both An
thony and Terry rose for the occa
sion.
But in the end, Stanford's scrawny

Terry Taylor got the first and last laugh as the
Cardinal whipped the visiting Oregon Ducks 84-61
in front of a crowd of 6,642.
The Cardinal's Taylor snapped out of a three
game scoring drought with sharpshooting from
three-point land to tally 18 points on the night.
And although Oregon's Anthony Taylor topped that
with 22 points, Terry's contributions were simply
more valuable.
The victory kept Stanford in a second-place tie
with Oregon State in the Pacific 10 Conference and
sets up tomorrow's 3 p.m. showdown with the
Beavers. The Cardinal's record now stands at 18-8
overall, 10-5 in the Pac-10, while Oregon falls to
13-11, 8-7.
"Terry's three-point goals at the beginning gave
us a lift," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"We felt prepared for the zone (defense) and I felt
like we attacked it well."
While Anthony Taylor barely topped his Pac-10
leading 20.5 points per game average, Terry Taylor
pumped in almost 10 more points than his confer
ence norm.
Taylor's outburst, however, was just one spoke
in an impressively balanced Cardinal scoring attack.
Center Greg Butler had 16 points, guard Todd
Lichti chipped in 17, Taylor bombed for 18, and
forward Howard Wright muscled inside for a team
high 19.
"We ran our regular zone offense and tried to
see where the holes were," Taylor said. "If we got
the open shot we took it." And with the Ducks
collapsing inside, Taylor was often the lucky open
man.
In front of a late-night national television audi
ence on ESPN, Stanford blazed out to a 31-13 lead
midway through the first half, and the Fighting
Ducks never got closer than 12 points the rest of
the way.
"It helped us to come out and open up like the
way we did," Montgomery said. "With the lead, it
was nice to be allowed to still make some mistakes
and win."
The Cardinal triumph reversed an 80-66 Duck
victory in Eugene last month.
"It all depends on who's ready to play. We showed
that tonight," Anthony Taylor said after the game.
"We were not ready to play."
Stanford, on the other hand, was more than ready
to go. On the Cardinal's first posession, Howard
Wright had a lay-in and was fouled, and in the next
three minutes Taylor and Lichti hit three-pointers
and Lichti drove in for a three-point play.
With only 3:27 gone in the game, Stanford led
14-5 and the Ducks looked deflated.
"We were really pumped up for this game," Stan
ford forward Bryan McSweeney said. "The nerves

were there."
McSweeney was one of four Cardinal players who
were assigned to control Taylor. It's close to im
possible to stop the Ducks senior guard (before the
game New York Knick scout Dick McGuire said
Taylor may be a first-round NBA pick). Taylor was
covered at one point or another by McSweeney,
Lichti, Scott Meinert and Oliver Cunningham.
"Although he got a lot of points, it took some
time," Montgomery said of Taylor. "We were able
to put McSweeney on him and Bryan's size helped."
Stanford's size with Wright and Butler helped
inside as well, and when the Ducks' defense sagged
too much the Cardinal kicked the ball out to Lichti

and Taylor who canned from the perimeter. On the
night, Stanford shot 57 percent from the field.
On the other end of the court, Oregon was not
able to establish the inside game which helped the
Ducks beat Stanford last time. The Ducks' starting
front line of Randy Grant, Keith Balderston and
Brett Coffey combined for only 17 points.
"The difference was that (at Oregon) we came
out fiat and didn't play hard," Butler said. "A lot
of teams are different — better — at home and
that was the case with Oregon."
In other Pac-10 games, UCLA beat Washington
97-87, Oregon State defeated California 65-54 and
