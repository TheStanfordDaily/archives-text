# Beavers next obstacle
## 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
If Stanford should finish the frenzy of a race for
second in the Pacific 10 Conference in a tie, the
Cardinal will wear the second-place crown.
It's that "what if time of the season, that time
when Cardinal fans are usually talking about which
team back East will win it all, and more importantly,
which schools will be good buys in the dorm pool.
But not this year. With last night's easy win over
the Fighting Ducks (an all-nickname entry, if there
ever was one), the Cardinal moved its record to a
startling 18-8 overall, 10-5 in conference play, and
eliminated the first "what if."
Beapuse of the team's record in head-to-head play
with Pac-10 teams, Stanford's victory guaranteed
that the Cardinal will win any tie in which it could
finish.
With three conference games left, Stanford looks
better than it has in years, and across the campus,
the NCAA Tournament whispers are growing a bit
louder.

'Every which way you look at it,
it's a big game.'
— Greg Butler

At this point, it's still a possibility worthy of any
Cardinal fan's speculation. However, the road to
anywhere must go through the Oregon State
Beavers and their wily, veteran coach Ralph Miller.
Tomorrow, the Beavers come to Maples for a 3
p.m. game sporting an identical 10-5 record in con
ference play, and similar post-season aspirations.
To claim second place, the Cardinal will have to
beat OSU tomorrow and then win one of two games
next weekend in Southern California.
"OSU becomes the focal point now," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said after last night's
game, "It's an exciting opportunity for our basket
ball program to finish second in the Pac-10."
From a fan's point of view, it could be easy to
look past the Beavers and on to next week's matchup
with UCLA. But the Beavers are no pushover.
Led by their showy sophomore point guard Gary
Payton and the coaching wisdom of Miller, who's
always hard to beat in a rematch, OSU plays a
pesky pressure defense and a quick ball-movement
offense that could very well give the Cardinal prob
lems.
Stanford won the last game in Corvallis, 78-65,
but it took 70 percent shooting and 15 unanswered
points in the last five minutes — two things you
can't expect tomorrow. To win, Stanford will have
to get the ball by the pressure defense, and into
the hands of certter Greg Butler and forward Howard
Wright, who combined for 46 points against the
shorter Beavers last time.
"Every which way you look at it, it's a big game,"
Butler said.
Tomorrow, Butler will be making his final ap
pearance in Maples and would like nothing more
than to finish it on a winning note.
Cross your fingers.
