Yapping at the
apex of the
pyramid of men's
tennis national
rankings this
weekend at Stan
ford Tennis

Stadium are a Torero, a Wolverine
and an Anteater.
The Stanford men's tennis
team (7-1), currently sharing with
Georgia the No. 1 ranking and
entrenched year after year atop
the nation's first echelon, hosts
three upstart challengers in the
University of San Diego (22nd
ranked) today at 1:30 p.m.,
eighth-rated Michigan tomorrow
at 1 p.m. and No. 10 UC-Irvine

Sunday at 1 p.m.
Though not traditional powers
like Stanford, USC and UCLA,
each of this weekend's opponents
check in this year with impressive
credentials. Michigan, narrowly
bowing to Georgia over the week
end, and UC-Irvine, which
thumped No. 6 UCLA last
Thursday, are making bids this
season to shed their second-rung
image and join the Cardinal atop
the pyramid of national rankings.
"Playing Stanford is kind of like
going to a body-building contest
with Arnold Schwarzanager," UC-
Irvine Coach Greg Patton said.
"We are going to see how our
muscles line up with theirs. Our
program is trying to catch up to
the standards set by Stanford,
USC and UCLA."

In a winter homestand,
Stanford continues a murderous
midseason stretch this weekend,
playing in its fifth, sixth and
seventh matches in 11 days.
"We are going to have to play
at the top of our game to beat
any one of these teams," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "This is
the best weekend for Stanford
tennis this year other than USC
UCLA (April 1-2)."
Of the three contests, today's
match against the Toreros of San
Diego promises to be the easiest,
yet may provide the key to the
weekend's success. The Toreros,
6-3 this year, upset Stanford last
season.
"I think if we can get up for
the San Diego match, we'll be in
gear against Michigan and Ir
vine," Cardinal freshman Martin
Blackman said. "We will have to
play well to beat all three teams,
but Michigan is the toughest
team. They have a lot of depth,
experience and confidence."
The Michigan Wolverines are
sparked by two of the nation's
top singles players in junior Dan
Goldberg and senior Ed Nagel.
Goldberg was an NCAA singles
finalist last season, often playing
behind Nagel in the Michigan
lineup during the season.
Stanford's Jeff Tarango and
Patrick McEnroe take on
Goldberg and Nagel tomorrow in
matches involving four of the
nation's finest singles players.
In Sunday's match against the
UC-Irvine Anteaters, the Cardinal
won't get any break whatsoever.
Led by Mark Kaplan and Trevor
Kroneman at No. 1 and No. 2
singles, the Anteaters have al
ready defeated Tennesse, Georgia
Tech and San Diego this year.
Like San Diego, Irvine also
upended Stanford last season.
"When we beat Stanford last
year, it was a milestone in our
development. That was kind of
like getting over the hump," Pat
ton said. "I expect this year we'll
give Stanford a great match on
down the lineup. The Anteaters
are coming; we are going to be
snapping our tongues and wag
ging our snouts. That's what they
want; that's what we want."
