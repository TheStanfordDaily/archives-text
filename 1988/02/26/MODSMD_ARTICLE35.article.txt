# 15-0 USC 'last' in Six-Pac
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The USC base
ball team is un
defeated in 15
games. The
Trojans, who
host Stanford
this weekend in

a three-game series that is the
first Pac-10 Southern Division
action for both teams, are
ranked eighth in one national
poll and 17th in the other.
But USC Coach Mike Gil
lespie isn't fooled.
"We have no delusions of
being an awesome team," he
said in a phone interview from
Los Angeles this week. "We've
played pretty well at times, but
some teams have given us gifts,
and we've benefited from some
controversial calls."
Uh-huh. So is it fair to say
you're pretty surprised by how
well your team has done, coach?
"Well, if anyone had said two
months ago that we would be
doing as well as we are, we could
have certified him insane," Gil
lespie said.

Naturally, Gillespie didn't
blink an eye this week when a
poll of Pac-10 Southern Division
coaches tabbed the Trojans to
finish dead last in the league
this year.
"That was a very fair spot to
place us," he said. "Based on
the way we played last year and
who we had coming back, it only
made sense that we'd be picked
to be chasing people."
Gillespie is probably well
advised to be guarded in his
evaluations of the Trojans. His
team, like most in the nation,
has its share of cupcakes in its
non-conference schedule.
There aren't any cuopakes in
the Six-Pac. %
"The exciting thing roout the
Pac-10 is that every team has
the ability to beat you, whether
you're the Minnesota Twins or
Stanford," Cardinal catcher
Doug Robbins said.
"This is the toughest league
in the country â€” there's no
question about it," Arizona
Coach Jerry Kindall said.
And the Six-Pac may be more
balanced than ever this year.
All six teams are ranked in the

top 25 in both polls. The last
two seasons, the league cham
pion (Stanford last year and
UCLA in 1986) went 21-9 in
league games. It will be difficult
for any team to win that many
this year.
"I think 18 wins might win
it this year," Cardinal second
baseman Frank Carey said.
Although each team has its
own character, all six have a
few things in common: They pile
up hits, they are well-coached
and they are tough to beat at
their home ballparks.
Thus, pitching and defense
will be crucial as the conference
season shakes down. On both
of those counts, Stanford will
be favored.
"Top to bottom, I think we
have the best pitching staff in
the league," Robbins said.
"I still feel like Stanford is
the strongest team in the
league," Kindall said.
The rest of the coaches in the
conference agree with him. All
six coaches picked the Cardinal
to win the league title again.
