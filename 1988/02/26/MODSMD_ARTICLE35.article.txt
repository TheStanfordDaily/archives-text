# 15-0 USC 'last' in Six-Pac
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The USC base
ball team is un
defeated in 15
games. The
Trojans, who
host Stanford
this weekend in

a three-game series that is the
first Pac-10 Southern Division
action for both teams, are
ranked eighth in one national
poll and 17th in the other.
But USC Coach Mike Gil
lespie isn't fooled.
"We have no delusions of
being an awesome team," he
said in a phone interview from
Los Angeles this week. "We've
played pretty well at times, but
some teams have given us gifts,
and we've benefited from some
controversial calls."
Uh-huh. So is it fair to say
you're pretty surprised by how
well your team has done, coach?
"Well, if anyone had said two
months ago that we would be
doing as well as we are, we could
have certified him insane," Gil
lespie said.

Naturally, Gillespie didn't
blink an eye this week when a
poll of Pac-10 Southern Division
coaches tabbed the Trojans to
finish dead last in the league
this year.
"That was a very fair spot to
place us," he said. "Based on
the way we played last year and
who we had coming back, it only
made sense that we'd be picked
to be chasing people."
Gillespie is probably well
advised to be guarded in his
evaluations of the Trojans. His
team, like most in the nation,
has its share of cupcakes in its
non-conference schedule.
There aren't any cuopakes in
the Six-Pac. %
"The exciting thing roout the
Pac-10 is that every team has
the ability to beat you, whether
you're the Minnesota Twins or
Stanford," Cardinal catcher
Doug Robbins said.
"This is the toughest league
in the country — there's no
question about it," Arizona
Coach Jerry Kindall said.
And the Six-Pac may be more
balanced than ever this year.
All six teams are ranked in the

top 25 in both polls. The last
two seasons, the league cham
pion (Stanford last year and
UCLA in 1986) went 21-9 in
league games. It will be difficult
for any team to win that many
this year.
"I think 18 wins might win
it this year," Cardinal second
baseman Frank Carey said.
Although each team has its
own character, all six have a
few things in common: They pile
up hits, they are well-coached
and they are tough to beat at
their home ballparks.
Thus, pitching and defense
will be crucial as the conference
season shakes down. On both
of those counts, Stanford will
be favored.
"Top to bottom, I think we
have the best pitching staff in
the league," Robbins said.
"I still feel like Stanford is
the strongest team in the
league," Kindall said.
The rest of the coaches in the
conference agree with him. All
six coaches picked the Cardinal
to win the league title again.

Arizona State was picked to finish
second, with California and Arizona tied
for third, UCIA in fifth and the Trojans
bringing up the rear.
"Arizona State and Stanford, with
their pitching, have the advantage," Cal
ifornia Coach Bob Milano said. "USC
is the sleeper .. . but there's such a
small difference between first and last,
it's unbelievable."
"It will be a dogfight for the middle
of the pack," Gillespie said.
Following are evaluations and a sub
jective ranking of the teams in the Six
Pac. The team name is followed by its
record thus far this year, its league
record last year, its ranking in the cur
rent Baseball America poll and its
ranking in the current ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball poll.
1. Stanford (11-5, 21-9, 6th/l Ith)
The Cardinal has the deepest pitching
staff in the conference and a starting
lineup that makes up in experience what
it lacks in speed. Stanford's offense has
been schizophrenic, but when the
middle of the order begins to produce
steadily, runs will come fast and furious.
The Cardinal already has three
proven starters in senior Lee Plemel
(2-1 with a 4.13 ERA) and freshmen
Mike Mussina (2-1, 2.03 ERA) and Stan
Spencer (3-1, 2.33). When junior Brian
Keyser, coming off an elbow injury, is
back at full strength, he will battle for
a spot in the top three or settle into a
long-relief role.
Junior bullpen ace Steve Chitren (0-1,
3.57, four saves), an All-Pac-10 selection
last year, has been unhittable at times
this season and unsettling at others.
He'll have to perform well consistently
if the Cardinal is to defend its league

title.
The Cardinal plays the Trojans at
Dedeaux Field at 7 p.m. tonight and 1
p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. All three
games will be broadcast live on KZSU,
90.1 FM.
2. Arizona State (20-2, 16-14,
2nd/2nd)
The Sun Devils return the nucleus
of the team that went to the College
World Series in Omaha, Neb., last June.
They took two of three from UCLA last
weekend in the opening series of Six-Pac
play.
The Sun Devil pitching staff is loaded.
Senior righthander Linty Ingram has
the best name and the best arm in the
league. He's unbeaten in six starts, with
a 1.71 ERA, has thrown five complete
games and has struck out 51 in 52 2/3
innings.
Junior lefthander David Cassidy (4-1,
3.00) and senior lefty Brian Dodd (5-0,
1.53) arc the other top starters. Bias
Minor, a senior righthander, is the bull
pen stopper. In his last five appearances,
ne has recorded a win and four saves.
His season ERA is 0.90.
The Sun Devil's explosive offense is
led by the conference's best outfield trio
— rightfielder Dan Rumsey,
centerfielder John Finn and leftfielder
Ricky Candelari, all juniors. Rumsey is
batting .340 with 23 RBI on the year,
and Candelari has knocked in an eye
opening 33 runs.
Arizona hosts California in Tempe
this weekend.
3. California (12-5, 12-18, 25th/24th)
The Bears were the hottest team in
the conference in the second half of last
season, and return virtually the entire
team. Their offense is potent, but pitch
ing is a question mark.
The top two pitchers are Travis Willis
(4-1, 2.75) and Mark Juhas (2-0, 4.76),
both sophomore righthanders, but

things get murky after that. A consis
tent third starter hasn't emerged yet,
and last year's ace reliever, senior lefty
Fred Corral (10-0 with 5 saves last year)
is still recovering from a nagging
shoulder injury. When Corral is 0.K.,
the pitching picture will look much
rosier.
The Bears have "a lot" of team speed,
according to Milano. "I think that's real
important because [team speedl is some
thing that remains consistent every
game," he said.
California's offense is led by 1987
All-Pac-10 second baseman Darryl Vice,
who is batting a virtuous .380 with 15
RBI, a home run and nine steals, and
designated hitter Bart Frets (.377, 14
RBI, five doubles). Leftfielder Todd
Mayo has stolen 11 bases and junior
college transfer John Kuehl has settled
in at third base with a .347 average, 3
homers and 17 RRI.
4. USC (15-0, 12-18, 17th/Bth)
The Trojans remained undefeated by
scoring seven runs in the bottom of the
ninth inning to beat Chapman College
7-6 on Wednesday. That gives some in
dication of the kind of offensive pro
duction the Trojans can muster.
And at 3.00, the Trojans have the
best team ERA in the conference. That
may change when league play begins.
USC, like California, still hasn't found
a dependable third starter.
"We've got a few good guys, but not
exactly the kind of guy you want to
send out there against Stanford," Gil
lespie said..
The Trojans have some famous names
in their starting lineup: freshman
second baseman Bret Boone is the son
of former Stanford and present major
league great Bob Boone. Leftfielder
Damon Buford, also a freshman, is the
son of former Baltimore Oriole and pre-

sent USC assistant coach Don
Buford and catcher Jim Campanis
is the grandson of former Los An
geles Dodgers executive A 1 Cam
panis. All three have been playing
well this season.
The Trojans have one of the
nation's finest relievers in senior
righthander Brian Nichols. Nic
hols doubled as a catcher and
reliever last year, but still re
corded a nation's best 17 saves.
Arizona (16-4, 13-17, 14th/14th)
The Wildcats score runs. But
then so does everyone else in the
league. Arizona is averaging 13
hits and 12 runs per game, but
the team ERA is a weighty 6.12.
"We're a very fragile team,"
Kindall said. "We could be good,

but we could be bad.... our pitch
ing is shaky. A couple of our vet
eran pitchers have been up and
down."
The lack of solid pitching will
drag the Wildcats down.
UCLA (11-5, 16-14, 18th/21st)
Ditto. The Bruins always have
and always will score a ton of
runs, especially in the cozy con
fines of Jackie Robinson Stadium,
where batting averages and ERAs
both get inflated. Junior desig
nated hitter Joe James leads the
way with a hefty .382 average.
But the Bruin pitching staff
comes into the weekend with a
combined ERA of 5.88. The rota
tion for this weekend's series in
cludes two freshmen and a soph
omore. But things can only get
better, and if the rotation
solidifies at all, UCLA may claw
its way out of the cellar.
