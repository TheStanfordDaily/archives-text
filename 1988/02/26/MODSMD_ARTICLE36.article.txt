# Five splash into NCAAs

Things are looking up all over.
Not only did the Stanford men's
basketball team win tonight, not only
did Debi Thomas move into first
place in the Olympic skating compe
tition, but the Stanford women's
swimming team is doing everything

it wanted to as well.
The Cardinal, ranked second in the nation behind
Texas, qualified five more swimmers for the NCAA
championships, taking the early lead at the Pacific
10 Conference Championships in the process. Stan
ford has a total of 333 points after one day, with
California in second at 318. UCLA has third place
with 287 points, Arizona State has 266 and USC
rounds out the contenders at 237.
The meet continues today and tomorrow in
Tualatin Hills, Oregon. The Pac-10 women's diving

championships begin today at the University of
Arizona.
"I think that the team's doing really well," fresh
man Suzy Buckovich said. "(And) tomorrow, I'm
sure we're going to do a lot better. I think we'll
do really well."
Buckovich was the biggest star for Stanford last
night, winning the 200-yard individual medley in a
Pac-10-record time (and a personal best) of 2:02.79,
a time which also qualifies her for the NCAA meet.
Freshman Jody Smith also qualified for NCAAs in
the 200 IM, ttking fourth place in the final, while
senior Susan Rapp, already an NCAA qualifier, took
sixth. Junior Monica Nielebeck swam an NCAA
qualifying time in the preliminaries to that event,
but was disqualified in the final, as was sophomore
Laurie McLean.
The other event winner for Stanford was junior
Jenna Johnson, who took the 50 freestyle in 23.50.
Junior Aimee Berzins, who hit her qualifying cut

in the 50-free prelims, placed
third in the final.
"Everybody swam really well,"
according to freshman Barb Metz,
who felt that Stanford still has
room for improvement. "I think
[the loss of points due to dis
qualifications] will pull everyone
together. It's going to make us
be so much more tough tomor
row."
Smith, swimming within a mile
of home, was perhaps the happiest
camper. "I'm really happy," she
said. "This is my home pool; that
sort of balanced out my nerves.
[The Stanford swimmers are] all
so very helpful. They start clap
ping and yelling — it gets you
excited."
