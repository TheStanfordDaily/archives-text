# Netters face Pac-10 black sheep
## Arizona, ASU rank high in nation but not in conference 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
Playing in the same league as
Stanford, USC, California and
UCLA, the Arizona and
Arizona State women's tennis
teams must feel like the black
sheep of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.

While each of the other four schools is
ranked in the top five nationally in the most
recent poll, the Wildcats and Sun Devils are
merely 15th and 16th, respectively.
Thus, when the top-ranked Cardinal opens
the Pac-10 season today (at 1:30 p.m.) and
tomorrow (at 1:00) at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, it should have no trouble beating
Arizona and ASU, right?
Well, the Stanford players and coaches need
only think back to last season when the un
heralded Wildcats knocked the No. 1 Cardinal
from the ranks of the undefeated with a 5-4
upset in Tucson.
"We have something to prove with the Uni
versity of Arizona," Stanford Asst. Coach

Caryn Copeland said yesterday.
The Wildcats, 2-2 overall and 0-2 in the
Pac-10, don't have the depth of talent that
the 8-0 Cardinal has, but they have a pair of
aces who have given Stanford headaches in
the past.
Senior Susan Russo and sophomore Betsy
Somerville — figures in the Wildcats'
upset of the Cardinal a year ago — are ac
complished singles players and even better as
a doubles team. Russo and Somerville (ranked
third nationally) have already won two tour
naments this season, and they will provide a
measuring stick for Cari Hagey and Sandra
Birch, Stanford's No. 1 doubles team.
ASU, 4-4 overall and 0-2 in the Pac-10,
played third-ranked USC tough, losing 6-3 to
the undefeated Trojans. Like the Cardinal,
the Sun Devils have several new faces on the
scene this season. "Arizona State is really
young," Copeland said. "I know that they
have five freshmen. (But) they aren't as ex
perienced as our young team. Their freshmen
haven't played in as many tournaments."
Injuries remain a concern for the Cardinal,
as junior Eleni Rossides is questionable for

this weekend's matches. Rossides, the team's
No. 1 singles player, has not played in the
first eight dual matches this season.
"She's coming along slowly," Copeland said.
"I don't think she can play until there's no
more pain."
Rossides — who won one tournament and
was runner-up at the Rolex National Indoor
Intercollegiate Tennis Championships three
weeks ago when she suffered the pulled groin
muscle that has kept her out of the lineup
— is No. 5 in the new singles rankings. Fresh
man Tami Whitlinger, who has been playing
No. 1 in Rossides' absence, is ranked fourth.
Sophomore Lisa Green and freshman Teri
Whitlinger are 15th and 23rd, respectively.
In doubles, the Whitlingers, who play No. 2
for the Cardinal, are ranked No. 8 nationally.
Birch and Hagey are ninth.
