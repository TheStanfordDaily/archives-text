# Women's hoops continues its quest
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Freshman Trisha Stevens and
sophomore Katy Steding hope
to have a happy homecoming
this weekend, when the No. 9
Stanford women's basketball
team travels north to face
Oregon State and Oregon in

its quest for the team's first Pacific 10 Con
ference title.
The Cardinal, 23-1 overall on the season
and 11-1 in the league, is currently tied for
first place in the Pac-10 with No. 11 Wash
ington, the squad responsible for Stanford's
only loss. The Oregon schools have been
relegated to the middle of the conference, but
will be tough opponents at home.
"We play Oregon State first, and as far as
I know, they'll play very aggressive man-to
man defense for the first half and then in
the second half they'll play a trapping, zone

type of defense," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "I think we should be able to
rip it up just like we attacked Cal's trap (in
last week's 94-79 win)."
The Cardinal had little problem with the
Beaver defense last month on the Farm, when
Stanford exploited the weakness of OSU's full
court press to run off with a 71-48 victory.
However, OSU, boasting the Pac-10's second
leading scorer in junior guard Chelle Flamoe,
is not a team to be taken lightly.
"Oregon State is going to play a lot better
at home than they did down here," sophomore
guard Jennifer Azzi said. "They have a pres
sure kind of defense that has given us trouble
all year, but if we come out ready to play we
should win the game."
"Oregon gives you a different problem,"
VanDerveer said. "They're a very big team,
and I hope we're able to run well against
Oregon, and I hope we're able to score well
against their big 2-3 zone."
"Big" is certainly the best adjective for the

Ducks. The team boasts the twin towers of
6-foot-3 forward Kris Glidden and 6-7 center
Stephanie Kasperski, a native of West Ger
many who is tied for first nationally in blocked
shots.
Nonetheless, if Stanford plays the way it
did when it blew out Oregon 84-48 in Maples
Pavilion, the game will be in the bag. The
stingy Cardinal defense held Kasperski to four
points before she fouled out, and on offense
ran circles around the sluggish giants and
bombed away from the outside.
"If they're not covering the outside, we'll
have to take the outside shots and hopefully
that will open up the middle," Azzi said. "If
we communicate well from post to perimeter,
we should do really well against them."
"We must have wins at Oregon and Oregon
State to stay in contention for first place,
because UCLA, USC and Washington have
beaten these schools," VanDerveer added. "We
have that pressure, but I also think people
are really ready to get it rockin' against them."
