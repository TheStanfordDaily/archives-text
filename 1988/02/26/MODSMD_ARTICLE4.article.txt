# Draw program reaches out
## Housing Center initiates five-part educational series 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
Over 60 undergraduates, mostly
freshmen, filled the Madera lounge yes
terday to learn about the Draw through
the Stanford Housing Center's new dor
mitory outreach program, headed by
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of stu
dents and director of Student Housing.
Through a series of five outreach pre
sentations around campus, Whitney
said he hopes to introduce transfers and
freshmen to "the principles behind the
Draw, the Draw process, and the com
puter program" which processes data
from housing preference cards and

Draw numbers.
"It has been [the Housing Center's]
perception over the last few years that
.. . students follow the steps in the
Draw but don't understand how it
works, or people don't go into the book
in detail," Whitney said.
The outreach programs will most
likely become a permanent part of the
Housing Center's Draw education ef
fort, he added.
The Madera presentation was the
second of the series. The first program,
which over 100 students attended, took
place Wednesday at Branner lounge.
The remaining three programs will
take place at 4:30 p.m. next Tuesday,

Wednesday and Thursday at Gavilan,
Ujamaa and Donner houses, respective
ly-
"We have made a concerted effort for
freshmen to understand the Draw,"
Whitney said.
With the outreaches making the an
nual housing draw "less complex," the
first weeks of spring quarter should not
"hit [freshmen] so hard," he said.
Before students pick Draw numbers
in the third week of April, the Housing
Center will distribute at the beginning
of spring quarter a 40- to 50-page book
explaining the Draw, and on-campus
residences will conduct open
houses and informational
meetings.
According to Whitney, the dorm
programs cover the materials ex
plained in the Draw book.
Yet, "the audio/visual... 'road
show' " takes a "more human"
angle in explaining the Draw than
the book, Whitney added.
Undergraduate Housing Super
visor Susan Birkenseer agreed
that the outreaches will improve
the Draw. With the presentations,
"it won't be so astonishing when
[students] get the Draw book,"
she said.
"Students have three weeks to
figure out what will go on for the
next year. The [presentations]
give students more time than

this," Birkenseer added.
Whitney and Birkenseer also
emphasized the importance of the
outreaches in terms of encourag
ing students to explore the diver
sity of housing options available.
"Unless [they] have done some
research," students will not be
knowledgeable about the 60 dif
ferent housing choices, Whitney
said.
Bill Georges, assistant director
of Student Housing, said the pro
grams help "get people interested
in their options."
In addition to an explanation
of the annual housing draw, the
outreaches include comments
from student representatives
living in different types of
housing, such as self-ops, co-ops
and cultural and academic theme
houses.
Whitney said he was "pleased
with . . . the really positive
response to the outreach so far."
