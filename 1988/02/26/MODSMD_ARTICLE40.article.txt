# Men's golf blown astray in Hawaii
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
The normally hal
cyon Hawaii
breezes turned
nasty Thursday,
gusting up to 35
mph and nearly
blowing the Stan-

ford men's golf team off the
course. After a fine first round of
294 in the 12th annual John
Burns Invitational in Oahu, the
Cardinal ballooned up to 307 in
the second 18-hole round.
The good news for Stanford is
that the wind was unfriendly to
all teams. Oklahoma State moved
into the top spot, with a 36-hole
total of 574. First round co-leader
Arizona State trails by one stroke
at 575, with USC close behind at
576. The middle of the pack is
also tightly bunched, with Fresno
State at 599 in 14th place, Stan
ford with 601 in 15th and New
Mexico in 16th with 602. In order
to have a chance at a postseason
tournament birth, the Cardinal
must break out of that pack.
As the individual scores reflect,
most golfers were hindered by the
conditions. James Kim of USC
leads the tournament with a 36-
hole total of 7-under-par 137,
while Carl Senneson of Oklahoma

State and Devin Dahlin are tied
for second at 5-under 139.
Murk Funseth continues to lead
the Cardinal. He faltered slightly
on Wednesday, carding a 78, but
still leads with a two round total
of 149. Sophomore walk-on Chris
Weyand kept his hold on second
place with a 79 (152). Close be
hind at 153 are sophomores Mike
Hubly, who roared back into con
tention with a one-over-par 73
after an 80 in the first round,
and Brad Joondeph (76-77).
Junior John Mahon slipped to 156
with an 82 yesterday.
The big story for Stanford is
still the surprising performance
of Weyand. Although the sopho
more complained about the heavy
winds which made his ball
"wobble back and forth in the
fairway" and made it difficult to
putt, he still remains in second
place for the team.
The Cardinal kept in sight of
its goal of 12th to 15th place in
the tournament, but it must come
back to beat teams such as FSU
and San Jose State in the final
round in order to keep its NCAA
tournament hopes alive. However,
Goodwin remains proud of his
players' performance thus far.
"Overall we're about where we
thought we'd be."
