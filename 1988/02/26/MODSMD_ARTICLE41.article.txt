# Wrestlers grapple at Pacific 10 meet
## 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
Stanford's wres
tling team has an
other long week
end ahead of it.
This road trip,
however, is "do or
die" for members

of the squad who intend to extend
their season beyond the upcoming
Pacific 10 Conference tournament
that is being held Saturday and
Sunday at Fullerton State. Of the
wrestlers who will participate in
the competition, only the top
three finishers in each of the 10
weight brackets will qualify for
the NCAA tournament.
Qualifying for the national
tournament is no easy task. Only
one wrestler on this year's Car
dinal team, Terry Mclntyre,
managed to qualify for the NCAAs
last season. Mclntyre finished
fourth in the Pac-10 in the 1987
meet, but qualified for the NCAA
tournament as one of four
"wildcards," who are selected by
the participating coaches.
Wrestling's Pac-10 is actually
composed of 11 schools, only four
of which are "real" Pac-10 par
ticipants. Other than Stanford,
the other Pac-10 schools that still
support wrestling programs are
Oregon, Oregon State and
Arizona State. The conference is

rounded out by Boise State, Cal
Poly-Pomona, Cal State-
Bakersfield, Utah State, Fresno
State, San Jose State and Fuller
ton. Arizona State has been na
tionally ranked all year.
"I think that our upper weights,
158-190, have the best chances to
qualify for the NCAAs," said
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel.
"Whatever happens, all of our
wrestlers will have to beat their
seeds to make it."
The wrestlers Horpel refers to,
and their overall records, are: 158-
pound Steve Yarbrough (20-6-1),
167-pound Steve Buddie (21-6-1),
177-pound Ron Perry (19-9-0) and
190-pound Mclntyre (21-9-0).
Although these four grapplers
have done well in West Coast com
petition this year, there are na
tionally ranked wrestlers in each
of their weight brackets who will
be in attendance at Fullerton.
At best, the Stanford con
tenders can hope for a fourth
place seed going into the tourna
ment. From then on, anyone in
each bracket can advance to the
final round, which will be held
Monday.
"It ail comes down to how well
each wrestler handles the compe
tition of the meet, and to how
well they actually perform during
the matches," said Horpel. "Some
surprising things have happened
in the past."
