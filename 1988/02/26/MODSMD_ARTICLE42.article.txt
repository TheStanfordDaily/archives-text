# Gymnasts team up to host UCLA
## Stanford men's team faces undefeated defending champions 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Tonight in the men's
gymnastics meet at
Maples Pavilion, there
will be six current
and/or former U.S.
National Team mem
bers competing. With

such an absurd number of elite ath
letes in one place at one time, one
would think that the competition is
a six-team extravaganza or perhaps
a four-way meet. Think again: it's a
dual meet.
That's right, of the 12 gymnasts
who will be competing on each event,
half have been or are ranked among

the nation's top 12 gymnasts, col
legiate or otherwise. The teams
sporting these standouts along with
impressive supporting casts are the
No. 2, defending national champion
UCLA Bruins (18-0) and the nation
ally ranked Stanford Cardinal (11-4).
The 7:30 p.m. meet is the last big
time home competition for the Car
dinal. The Bruins have a team best
of 284, and boast a strong, but vul
nerable, lineup which makes them
one the favorites — along with host
school Nebraska — to take the na
tional title at April's NCAAs in Lin
coln.
The meet will showcase gymnastics
at its best. NCAA titles have been
won by Bruin David Moriel on the

high bar and teammate Curtis
Holdsworth on the pommel horse.
Cardinal Chuck Gerardo's pommel
routine is known for its remarkably
smooth rhythm and has been scored
at 9.9 in the past. Stanford co-captain
Mike Matzek's floor routine is replete
with a double layout and scary feats
of strength, while his work on the
still rings remains beguiling.
Both the Bruins and the Cardinal
have been plagued by injuries of late.
UCLA, whose vulnerability is that it
has little-to-no depth, may be enter
ing only five gymnasts on some
events, with a freshman being the
sixth on the others. Two of those
five gymnasts, according to UCIA
Coach Art Shurlock, will be ham

pered by restricitive injuries tonight.
The Cardinal has been holding
back somewhat in recent meets by
not entering its best lineup on each
event in order to protect minor in
juries which could be aggravated. Be
cause this has meant limiting 1985
and 1986 National Team Member
Randy Besosa to three events, Stan
ford has been a couple points behind
the pace it may be capable of.
Besosa's injury was recently
diagnosed as possible torn knee car
tilage which would need surgery. The
senior co-captain will go four events
tonight, reporting that the doctor
told him that the injury would not
be affected by the impact felt during
the competition.
