# Women battle Washington after challenging top-ranked Bruins
## 
### Chris Kendrick Staff writer 
The Stanford wo
men's gymnastics
team is going after the
gold this weekend —
the blue and gold and
the purple and gold,
that is.

In back-to-back meets, the team
faces two of its toughest opponents
of the season. Tonight, the No. 1
UCLA Bruins descend upon Maples
Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. Tomorrow
night, the Cardinal will be in Seattle

to compete against Washington, who
will be eager to avenge a loss to
Stanford suffered earlier this season
at Maples.
The gymnasts, however, are
prepared for the intense competition.
Stanford Coach Homer Sardina has
not yet determined the lineup for the
individual events, but Dina Amoroso,
Alison McGann and Jinny Rhee will
compete in the all-around.
"We'll obviously put in our
strength," Sardina said. "We're going
to put all the able-bodied, high
scoring athletes on the floor."
Chasing UCLA, an undisputedly

"awesome team," according to Sar
dina, will require the gymnasts to
give virtually flawless performances.
The Bruins have a solid base of six
international stars, including Tanya
Service, Kim Anderson and Jill
Andrews. All six have competed
either in a national championship or
in the Olympics. The remainder of
the roster contributes to the depth
that has maintained UCI-A's position
atop the national rankings with an
average team score of 188.88.
"You look at their lineup and
wonder, 'How can't they win a na
tional championship?' " Sardina said.

In the Washington meet, the gym
nasts do not have to he as sharp to
get the scores, which explains why
the team is competing in back-to
back meets at this crucial point in
the season. After the UCLA meet,
the gymnasts will be over the initial
nervousness that often causes costly
mistakes.
And this week, the squad's efforts
will be aided by the return of junior
Cheryl Doo, who was not able to
complete the Fullerton meet after
bruising her heel while landing after
her vault routine.
