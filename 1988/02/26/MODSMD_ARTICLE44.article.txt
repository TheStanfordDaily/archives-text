# Track runs in San Jose meet
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Bay Area bragging rights will be at
stake when Stanford's track and field
team competes Saturday at the San
Jose State Relays. The competition
begins at 9 a.m.
This will be Stanford's first out
door meet and largest engagement.

The Cardinal's complement of almost 50 competitors
will take on the best the Bay Area can offer, in
cluding California and Fresno State.
For some, this meet will be the first of the season,
while others will be seeking confirmation of earlier
performances at Louisiana State and Washington.
Sophomore Carol Gray is coming off a double win
last weekend at Washington, while several others
have already qualified for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.
The two most notable absences from the lineup
will be Marc Olesen and Lisa Bernhagen. Olesen,
a fifth-year senior with one year of track eligibility
left, has already run an NCAA qualifying 3:41.90
in the 1500 meters.
Bernhagen has also qualified for the NCAA out
door meet with a high jump of 6 feet, 1 inch.
Bernhagen won the NCAA indoor track and field
championship meet last year before suffering an
injury, and will be focusing on a win again this year.
Stanford will be competing in a local race this
weekend rather than flying to another out-of-state
competition, foregoing some of competition to race
locally and scout Cal's team. The team will not race
together until the March 20 Stanford Triangular
Meet. This will allow athletes to prepare for the
NCAA indoor championship meet and let others get
in a solid three-week training period.
The first field events start at 9 a.m. with the
men's hammer throw, while the running events
begin at 11 a.m. with the 3000 meters.
