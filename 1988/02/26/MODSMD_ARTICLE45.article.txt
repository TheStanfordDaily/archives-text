# Card seniors swim in final 'Big Meet'
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Tomorrow's 1 p.m. meet
against traditional rival
California is important
for the entire Stanford
men's swimming team,
but especially so for the
seniors on the squad.

While all swimmers will be trying to
make Pacific 10 Conference and NCAA
cuts in this last dual meet of the season
to gain momentum for the upcoming
championship meets, the graduating
seniors will also be competing at
deGuerre pool for the final time.
"It would definitely be nice to give
something to the seniors in return for
everything they've done this year," soph
omore backstroker Rick Gould said. "It'd
be great to let them go out on top."
For tri-Captains Sean Murphy, An
thony Mosse and Matt Nance, as well
as Dave Lederman and Bart Wells, the
contest with the nationally ranked Bears
will be their final collegiate two-squad
meet. And although they are basically

just considering the competition a reg
ular dual meet and an important chal
lange for the squad's NCAA champion
ship hopes, each admits to being a little
sentimental.
"I really can't believe it's all over,"
Mosse said. "All of a sudden it is our
turn to leave. I just want to beat Cal."
"Although getting our times down is
the most important aspect of the meet,
winning is really important to the
seniors," Nance said. "It's putting a little
more pressure on me and making me a
little more nervous."
"Of course as seniors we want to win
it," Murphy said, "but aside from that,
it would be nice to go out with a good
meet with fast swimming."
The contest is especially important to
the Cardinal as it is coming off slow
meets against USC and UCLA. This will
be the team's last opportunity to qualify
swimmers for the Pac-10 Champion
ships, and is the swimmers' last chance
to make NCAA cuts without shaving.
The teams are giving the competitors
an extra opportunity to qualify by hold
ing a championship format.
