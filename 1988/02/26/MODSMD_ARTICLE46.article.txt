# Golfers tee off at Lady Spartan
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
After posting its lowest
round of the year last
week despite the absence
of its leader, the Stan
ford women's golf team
is hoping it can go even
further at this weekend's

Lady Spartan in Monterey.
The tournament will be held today,
Saturday, and Sunday at the Fort Ord
Golf Course, a narrow but fair 6,032-
yard par-72. Its course rating, 75.6 from
the women's tees, makes it the toughest
course they will play all year, according

to Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin.
"It's a tremendously tough golf course
and a super field," Baldwin said.
"It's an excellent course," said senior
Kay Cornelius, who is looking to
rebound after entering the hospital on
the opening day of last week's Arizona
Intercollegiate with a viral flu.
Comprised of long par-3's and tight,
doglegged par-4's, the course demands
good management, according to fresh
man Jodi Figley. "You have to play it
smart," she said. "On some holes you
have to be on a certain side of the
fairway to have a good shot at the
green."
"You can't let up or else you'll get

in trouble," sophomore Stephanie Parel
added.
Most of the players agree that driving
and putting will be the keys to low
scoring this weekend. "I want to keep
the ball in the fairway," Figley said.
"If I have problems, it will be with
my putting," added freshman Kristin
Ryan, whose scores have been consis
tently improving this year as she has
become more confident in her game.
For all the Stanford players except
Cornelius, this will be their first tour
nament at the Fort Ord course. Baldwin
had his players take an extra practice
round last Saturday to better prepare
them for the tournament.
