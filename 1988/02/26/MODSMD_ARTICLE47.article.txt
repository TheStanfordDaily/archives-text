They need the time off.
Stanford's young
men's volleyball team,
still smarting from a
tough five-game defeat
at the hands of UC-
Santa Barbara Wednes-

day night, will not return to league
action until next weekend, when the
Cardinal plays conference foes Cal
State-Northridge and UCLA. But in the

interim lies a good warmup match for
the No. 13 Cardinal.
Sunday, Stanford travels across the
Bay to play rival California. Although
the Golden Bears are simply a young
club team, Stanford (8-10 overall, 3-4
in league play) will not take this non
conference matchup lightly.
"Sure, it's the kind of match we'll go
into confidently," Stanford Asst. Coach
Ruben Nieves said, "but we have to
remember what a big match it is on
their schedule. An upset of Stanford
would make their whole season."

Stanford cannot afford to let that hy
pothetical upset to occur. Although this
is simply a non-league match, it is the
type of contest that the Cardinal needs
to win to keep up its confidence.
"We need to continue to work hard
in every match," Nieves said. "The more
we are able to improve outside of con
ference play, the more competitive we'll
be in WIVA (Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association)."
"I'll expect that they will have im
proved substantially, just as we have,"
Nieves said.
