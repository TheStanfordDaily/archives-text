# BOATHOUSE ROCK
## 
### Berkowitz Lujan 
The Daily apologizes for yesterday's "Boathouse Rock," in which Chicano leader
Cesar Chavez was portrayed as a cockroach-like insect. "Roach" is sometimes
used as a derogatory term for members of the Chicano-Latino community. The
Dally and the authors of "Boathouse Rock" failed to recognize that the strip could
be interpreted as racially offensive. While comic strips represent the views of their
authors and not necessarily those of The Daily, in running the strip The Daily
undercut its commitment not to publish racially derogatory material.
