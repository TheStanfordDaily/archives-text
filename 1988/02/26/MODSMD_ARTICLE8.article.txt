## GSB tops salary survey 
### Dave Kazanjian 
A recent survey showed that students at
Stanford's Graduate School of Business
have the highest starting salaries in the
country, yet some Business School admin
istrators and students were skeptical of
the findings.
The survey, organized by the New York
University Graduate School of Business
Administration, reported that Stanford
graduates received an average salary of
$50,725 in 1987.
Assoc. Dean of the Business School John
Roberts said it is "disfunctional to focus
on salaries" because there are many other
factors that come into play when students
"decide on graduate schools and jobs, in
cluding location and field of interest.
According to Roberts, salaries are af
fected by how much experience students
have prior to graduation and where they
choose to work. Roberts pointed out that
New York firms on the average pay higher
salaries than Bay Area companies.
Roberts also said that the Business
School tends to deemphasize salary as the
priority for choosing a job. Instead, the
Business School tries to encourage students
to consider ethics in business and requires
them to take an ethics class.
Kate Duhamel, student co-chair of the
career management committee, said the
No. 1 ranking by the NYU survey was not
"a huge positive" for the Business School
because the result overshadowed the
smaller number of students who choose to

work in the non-profit business sector or
with smaller, less paying firms.
According to Elizabeth Meyer, director
of the Business School Career Management
Center, the NYU survey might cause some
employers to believe that Stanford
graduates are overpaid for having just left
school. "The average age of our graduates
is about 30," which means that they are
entering the job market with years of ex
perience, she explained.
Meyer cited a survey conducted by her
office which showed that graduate students
ranked field of interest, work atmosphere
and location above salary.
Although they were skeptical about the
survey result, both Roberts and Meyer said
that there is a high demand for Stanford
graduates, which is reflected by the fact
that many firms recruit vigorously on
campus.
"American business must believe that
the kind of people who come out of the
top schools are impressive," Roberts said.
Duhamel said, however, that salary can
be a big factor for graduates choosing jobs,
especially when graduates find themselves
in debt from so many years of education.
While the survey did not break down
the average salary figure into catagories of
race or gender, Duhamel and Meyer said
that although women enter professional
business in fewer numbers, they have the
same starting salaries as men on the
average.
Meyer speculated that gendered
discrepencies might appear in
later years of employment. Nei
ther Meyer or Duhamel had fig
ures showing the average starting
salaries of graduates from differ
ent ethnic backgrounds.

Meyer and Roberts said they
question the accuracy of the
report because the Business
School does not release informa
tion on avarage salaries for their
classes. She said that the survey
results could have come from in
formation that the Business
School releases on average
salaries bas(M on the varied fields
students enter.
