# Legal panelists:
## Senate weariness benefited Kennedy

"Had (Justice Anthony) Kennedy
been under the same intense scrutiny"
as Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork,
he would not have passed the Senate
confirmation, attorney Mary Dunlap
said last night at a panel discussion on
Bork's defeat in Cubberley Auditorium.
The Black Graduate Students' Asso
ciation sponsored the discussion, led by
legal experts from around the country,
in order to determine the significance
of Bork's defeat for different interest
groups.
Dunlap said Kennedy "benefited in
an unfair way" from the defeat of Bork
and the subsequent defeat of Judge Alan

Ginsburg. She said the key difference
between Kennedy and Bork was that
Bork had more concrete proof against
him, in the form of written decisions,
than Kennedy.
The panelists, who said they found
the Kennedy appointment unsatisfac
tory, also c'pnfied their particular op
position to the Bork nomination.
Calling Bork a "smug, arrogant,
wishy-washy . . . person given to erratic
reversals of decisions," University of
Tennessee Law School Dean Marilyn
Yarbrough said he was a dangerous
nominee because of his inconsistency.

If the Senate had been as tough on Supreme Court nominee Anthony Kennedy

sion," altering his past views sim
ply to satisfy the Senate Selectiun
committee. While Bork appeared
to change his stance during the
hearings, his values were still
"diametrically opposed to black
people," Sanyika said.
Indiana University Law Prof.
John Baker aired concerns that
white liberals used blacks to
legitimize the opposition to Bork.
"Blacks were made part of a
struggle where the stakes for
blacks were relatively low, but for

[white liberals] high," he said.
Baker pointed out that Ken
nedy is as likely to oppose affirm
ative action as Bork, even though
no liberals of any race opposed
him during the selection process.
Baker said blacks should be more
concerned about poverty, unem
ployment and other issues directly
affecting the black community.
Citing the fact that 17 key Sen
ate votes were swayed by pressure
from black voters, Sanyika argued
that the defeat of Supreme Court
nominee Robert Bork was signif
icant because blacks were per
ceived as a strong political force
as a result of the decision.
