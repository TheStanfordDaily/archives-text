# Police panel resurrected
## Minority concerns an issue 
### Joe Metcalfe Staff writer 
After a delay of almost two years, the Panel on'
Student and Police Relations met Thursday for the
first time in an attempt to increase communication
between the Stanford community and its police
department, although the panel will not receive and
investigate individual allegations of police harass
ment.
The committee's charge calls for the panel to
bring safety and security matters to the attention
of the police, make recommendations about policies
and practices to 'the University president, and
facilitate communication and understanding about
public safety and security matters.
Alex Danel, a student serving on the panel, said
the committee was not formulated to handle com
plaints because of "the existence of other channels"
in which students can air grievances concerning
improper police behavior.
Such channels include internal investigations
within the police department and the University
Department of Public Safety, according to Danel, a
senior.
It is not clear, however, whether there exists any
public forum within the University in which to air
grievances about alleged improper police behavior,
Danel said.
The committee is not going to be a "watchdog"
over the Stanford Police Department, according to
junior Amy Francetic, another student representa

munication" between the police and the Stanford
community, she said.
The panel, chaired by Assoc. Dean of Campus
Affairs Michael Jackson, is presently comprised of
three students, two members of the Stanford Police
Department and two administrators.
The panel's charge, originally drawn up a year
and a half ago, makes no specific mention of police
minority relations, a divisive issue in the Stanford
community in recent years.
But Stanford Police Captain Marvin Moore, also
on the panel, stressed that educating students about
normal police procedure was a crucial step in ad
dressing the concerns of minority students, since
many charges of police harassment stem from what
he said were misunderstandings.
Students urged the formation of a police oversight
committee after concern over police actions grew
in 1985 from allegations of police brutality by stu
dents arrested while protesting the University's in
vestments in South Africa.
Students on the panel blame the lengthy delay
of the committee's formation on a number of factors,
including organizational problems and difficulty in
finding faculty members to serve.
