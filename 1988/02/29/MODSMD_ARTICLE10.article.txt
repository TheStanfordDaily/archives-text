## Talks fight homophobia 
### Leslie Hatamiya Staff writer 
Although homosexuality is a sensitive
topic of discussion in a society concerned
with the growing threat of AIDS, the Stan
ford lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Speakers'
Bureau is slowly, but surely, doing its best
to open up the lines of communication
between the homosexual and heterosexual
communities on campus.
Established in the mid-1970s by students
conerned about the misconceptions and
tensions between gays and non-gays, the
speakers' bureau has grown to become one

of the most visible educational programs
in student residences, fostering discussion
on people's attitudes toward gay people
and issues facing the lesbian, gay and
bisexual community at Stanford.
In an attempt to battle homophobia, "the
most valuable thing the bureau does is to
let students actually see and talk with gay
people," according to sophomore Steve Sas
saman, president of the Gay and lesbian
Alliance at Stanford and a member of the
speakers' bureau.
"It is a lot easier to hate and stereotype
a group without a face," he said.
"It's a lot more difficult when you
see real individuals, people in your
classes and dorms," participating
in the speakers' bureau.
Although the Speakers' Bureau
principally speaks in dorms, its
recent program at the Sigma Chi
fraternity on Feb. 17 was a "very
positive" step in reaching out to
other groups on campus, said
senior Adam Aronson, a Speakers'
Bureau member.
The three hour program, which
about 90 percent of the fraternity
members attended, was "a step
toward better relations and better
understanding between the fra
ternity community and the gay
community, and, hopefully, a step
toward a better life for gay people
in fraternities," Aronson said.
Because fraternities are many
times stereotyped as being homo
phobic, Aronson said that "Sigma
Chi was really courageous to in
vite us. There's not much
precedence of other fraternities
inviting us. In the past four years
only Sigma Chi and SAE have
asked us to speak in their houses."
"Both sides gained a lot from
the program," according to senior
Tom Shoaf, a member of Sigma
Chi. Schoaf said that there "has
been an increase in tolerance"
toward homosexuality at Sigma
Chi because of the program.
He added that Sigma Chi mem
bers "resent" being labeled as ho
mophobic and hoped that the pro
gram between GLAS and the fra
ternity would "break down" this
misconception of the Sigma Chi
members.
Despite the successful program
at Sigma Chi, Interfraternity
Council President Vinny Frost
said he "is disappointed that more
fraternities haven't invited the
speakers' bureau."
According to Frost, the IFC, as
well as Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Joe Pisano, has urged fraternities
to invite the speakers' bureau to
their houses and come to terms
with homophobia. Few fraterni
ties have acted on the IFC's re
quest.

Shoaf attributed the lack of
response on the part of fraterni
ties to the fact that less program
ming occurs in fraternities than
in dorms. Instead, members spend
much of their time working on
other fraternity activities, includ
ing parties and public service proj
ects, Shoaf said.
Another reason that fraterni
ties may be hesitant to invite the
speakers' bureau, according to
Sassaman, is that "homosexuality
might be thought of as a threat
to a fraternity, which is based on
brotherhood and unity."
Although homophobia exists in
both fraternities and dorms, the
atmosphere at Stanford has been
conducive to the speakers'
bureau's efforts to encourage in
formal and candid discussion be
tween gays and non-gays.
"There's a willingness here at
Stanford, which you don't find in
mainstream life, to question and
change one's beliefs," Sassaman
said.
"Even if a person is homopho
bic, but is willing to talk and listen
to us, we can make real progress
in changing attitudes here," he
said. "The speakers' bureau is a
constructive way of working to
change people's attitudes, rather
than just saying: [being gay] is
bad."
Speakers' bureau programs are
always by invitation, and despite
the misconception that the
bureau has come to recruit or con
vert the audience, their main pur
pose is to break down stereotypes
and answer questions about gay
people, said junior Peter Olson, a
member of the speakers' bureau.
Before each program, dorm res
idents fill out questionnaires so
the speakers can get a sense of
the dorm's attitude toward
homosexuality. In each program,
the speakers introduce them
selves and tell a little about their
experiences as gays. Then the pro
gram is opened up for questions
and discussion.
The speakers encourage stu
dents attending their programs
not to be afraid to ask questions
and to say how they really feel
about homosexuality, bringing

out their hostility, fears and
stigma about gays.
"In dorms there's a pressure
for people to avoid confrontational
questions, to be more open,"
Aronson said. "In one sense that's
fine, but if it prevents people from
discussing concerns they have,
then it is not good. It holds back
the communication that we are
trying to open up."
The atmosphere and tone of any
particular speakers' bureau pro
gram varies from dorm to dorm,
but generally programs in all
freshmen residences are usually
more tense than programs in
four-class or upperclass dorms,
Aronson said.
Just out of high school, many
freshmen have had little or no
contact with gay people. As a
result, "they tend to believe a lot
of misconceptions and media
stereotypes about gays," Aronson
said.
According to Sassaman, fresh
men tend to ask questions that
are "a little more naive and less
enlightened. They tend to ask
questions about what we do
sexually."
In four-class and upperclass
dorms, on the other hand, discus
sion tends to focus on "some of
the more subtle issues of being
gay," Aronson said.
Older students tend to ask
questions about how being gay
affects employment opportunities
as well as having children. Up
perclass students also want to
know how non-gay people can
help gays feel more comfortable
in the dorms.
While the campus attitude
toward homosexuality has slowly
become more accepting, the
speakers' bureau has also under
gone a number of changes in
recent years.
In the past two years, the num
ber of speakers has grown from
a handful to 49 current members,
according to Aronson. In addition
to Stanford students and alumni,
the group includes five parents of
gay children, three fraternity
alumni who are gay and three
members of the University faculty
and staff.

and to say how they really feel
about homosexuality, bringing

out their hostility, fears and
stigma about gays.
"In dorms there's a pressure
for people to avoid confrontational
questions, to be more open,"
Aronson said. "In one sense that's
fine, but if it prevents people from
discussing concerns they have,
then it is not good. It holds back
the communication that we are
trying to open up."
The atmosphere and tone of any
particular speakers' bureau pro
gram varies from dorm to dorm,
but generally programs in all
freshmen residences are usually
more tense than programs in
four-class or upperclass dorms,
Aronson said.
Just out of high school, many
freshmen have had little or no
contact with gay people. As a
result, "they tend to believe a lot
of misconceptions and media
stereotypes about gays," Aronson
said.
According to Sassaman, fresh
men tend to ask questions that
are "a little more naive and less
enlightened. They tend to ask
questions about what we do
sexually."
In four-class and upperclass
dorms, on the other hand, discus
sion tends to focus on "some of
the more subtle issues of being
gay," Aronson said.
Older students tend to ask
questions about how being gay
affects employment opportunities
as well as having children. Up
perclass students also want to
know how non-gay people can
help gays feel more comfortable
in the dorms.
While the campus attitude
toward homosexuality has slowly
become more accepting, the
speakers' bureau has also under
gone a number of changes in
recent years.
In the past two years, the num
ber of speakers has grown from
a handful to 49 current members,
according to Aronson. In addition
to Stanford students and alumni,
the group includes five parents of
gay children, three fraternity
alumni who are gay and three
members of the University faculty
and staff.
Although homosexuality is a sensitive
topic of discussion in a society concerned
with the growing threat of AIDS, the Stan
ford lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Speakers'
Bureau is slowly, but surely, doing its best
to open up the lines of communication
between the homosexual and heterosexual
communities on campus.
Established in the mid-1970s by students
conerned about the misconceptions and
tensions between gays and non-gays, the
speakers' bureau has grown to become one

of the most visible educational programs
in student residences, fostering discussion
on people's attitudes toward gay people
and issues facing the lesbian, gay and
bisexual community at Stanford.
In an attempt to battle homophobia, "the
most valuable thing the bureau does is to
let students actually see and talk with gay
people," according to sophomore Steve Sas
saman, president of the Gay and lesbian
Alliance at Stanford and a member of the
speakers' bureau.
"It is a lot easier to hate and stereotype
a group without a face," he said.
"It's a lot more difficult when you
see real individuals, people in your
classes and dorms," participating
in the speakers' bureau.
Although the Speakers' Bureau
principally speaks in dorms, its
recent program at the Sigma Chi
fraternity on Feb. 17 was a "very
positive" step in reaching out to
other groups on campus, said
senior Adam Aronson, a Speakers'
Bureau member.
The three hour program, which
about 90 percent of the fraternity
members attended, was "a step
toward better relations and better
understanding between the fra
ternity community and the gay
community, and, hopefully, a step
toward a better life for gay people
in fraternities," Aronson said.
Because fraternities are many
times stereotyped as being homo
phobic, Aronson said that "Sigma
Chi was really courageous to in
vite us. There's not much
precedence of other fraternities
inviting us. In the past four years
only Sigma Chi and SAE have
asked us to speak in their houses."
"Both sides gained a lot from
the program," according to senior
Tom Shoaf, a member of Sigma
Chi. Schoaf said that there "has
been an increase in tolerance"
toward homosexuality at Sigma
Chi because of the program.
He added that Sigma Chi mem
bers "resent" being labeled as ho
mophobic and hoped that the pro
gram between GLAS and the fra
ternity would "break down" this
misconception of the Sigma Chi
members.
Despite the successful program
at Sigma Chi, Interfraternity
Council President Vinny Frost
said he "is disappointed that more
fraternities haven't invited the
speakers' bureau."
According to Frost, the IFC, as
well as Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Joe Pisano, has urged fraternities
to invite the speakers' bureau to
their houses and come to terms
with homophobia. Few fraterni
ties have acted on the IFC's re
quest.

Shoaf attributed the lack of
response on the part of fraterni
ties to the fact that less program
ming occurs in fraternities than
in dorms. Instead, members spend
much of their time working on
other fraternity activities, includ
ing parties and public service proj
ects, Shoaf said.
Another reason that fraterni
ties may be hesitant to invite the
speakers' bureau, according to
Sassaman, is that "homosexuality
might be thought of as a threat
to a fraternity, which is based on
brotherhood and unity."
Although homophobia exists in
both fraternities and dorms, the
atmosphere at Stanford has been
conducive to the speakers'
bureau's efforts to encourage in
formal and candid discussion be
tween gays and non-gays.
"There's a willingness here at
Stanford, which you don't find in
mainstream life, to question and
change one's beliefs," Sassaman
said.
"Even if a person is homopho
bic, but is willing to talk and listen
to us, we can make real progress
in changing attitudes here," he
said. "The speakers' bureau is a
constructive way of working to
change people's attitudes, rather
than just saying: [being gay] is
bad."
Speakers' bureau programs are
always by invitation, and despite
the misconception that the
bureau has come to recruit or con
vert the audience, their main pur
pose is to break down stereotypes
and answer questions about gay
people, said junior Peter Olson, a
member of the speakers' bureau.
Before each program, dorm res
idents fill out questionnaires so
the speakers can get a sense of
the dorm's attitude toward
homosexuality. In each program,
the speakers introduce them
selves and tell a little about their
experiences as gays. Then the pro
gram is opened up for questions
and discussion.

dents attending their programs

about homosexuality, bringing
