# Grant to fund peace studies
## 
### Angie Kim Staff writer 
Stanford graduates from all ac
ademic disciplines will soon have
the chance to compete for portions
of a new $1 million grant designed
to support innovative work on is
sues of arms control, interna
tional peace and security.
According to Sidney Drell, co
director of the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Con
trol, the funds will strengthen the
training of mid-career or postdoc
toral researchers in a wide range
of departments under the general
topic of peace and security.
"We'll be able to award a num
ber of fellowships annually to the
future experts in these areas,"
Drell said. "These funds will
generate new knowledge and ex
pertise by giving these intelligent
people what they need — money."
The Arms Control Center
received the fellowship money
from the John D. and Catherine
T. Mac Arthur Foundation, which
in 1985 began to award institu
tions for research in these areas.
The foundation established this
recent grant to renew its initial
commitment to Stanford's work
on international peace, according
to Drell. Each year, for five years,
$20,000 of the grant will be dis-

tributed to students based on
their needs and the merit of their
projects, he said.
According to Coit Blacker, act
ing co-director of the Arms Con
trol Center, the purpose of the
foundation is to stimulate inves
tigation into the origins of inter
societal violence, lack of interna
tional cooperation and, eventu
ally, to develop new solutions to
these problems.
"We hope to attract scholars
from many fields, not just inter
national relations or political sci
ence which are usually associated
with our center," Drell said. "Eth
ics, psychology, economy, science
and technology — these are all
important aspects of the interna
tional scene today and need to be
explored with the idea of peace
and security in mind."
In addition to drawing Stanford
graduates, the center also plans
to attract postdoctoral scholars
from other institutions, Blacker
said. "The emphasis must remain
on advancing the field of interna
tional peace studies, and the best
proposals will be chosen for the
fellowships."
Some of the money from the
grant will be applied to mid-career
science fellows at Stanford. The
Carnegie Corporation in New
York, which began funding the

mid-careeer fellowship program in
1984, will also continue to support
the program for five years.
In coiyuction with the Knight
Fellowship Program, the Mac A
rthur Foundation may also fund
journalists' work on arms control
issues.
Past recipients of Mac Arthur
scholarship awards have repre
sented a wide variety of disciplines
and nations. "Bringing these
bright minds together is in itself
significant," Drell said. "Interna
tional and inter-disciplinary
cooperation is a first step in bring
ing international peace and arms
control."
Several scholars who came to
Stanford as a result of the schol
arship have remained here after
the award expired in order to join
faculty or center staff. Daniel
Okimoto and Condoleezza Rice,
both associate professors of polit
ical science, are among this group.
Drell and Blacker urged stu
dents from every field to apply
for the Mac Arthur fellowships.
"This fund was instituted to sup
port the training programs," Drell
said. "And that's what we need
to do — train — in order to get
those new experts and move
toward international peace. It's
important, and innovative ideas
are needed."
