Two die in Armenian clashes
MOSCOW — A teen-ager and a young man
in Azerbaijan were killed in clashes growing
out of a territorial dispute involving their So
viet republic and neighboring Armenia, a So
viet prosecutor disclosed yesterday.
Alexander Katusev also said that several
people suffered bruises and other injuries
when "isolated hooligan elements" in the dis
puted region of Nagorno-Karabakh got out of
control.
Public protests continued yesterday in the
mountainous region governed from Baku, the
capital of Azerbaijan.
The Armenian capital of Yerevan, however,
was described as "absolutely calm" at the out
set of a one-month moratorium on demon
strations that drew hundreds of thousands of
persons to the streets over a weeklong period.
This truce was accepted after an appeal for
a return to normalcy by Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev. It did not apply in Nagorno-
Karabakh, located within Azerbaijan.
Beatings, rock-throwing at vehicles, setting
of fires and damage to state property were
reported in Azerbaijan.
But Katusev said in an interview with Baku
radio that was monitored by the British Broad
casting Corp.: "The state of affairs in Azer
baijan as a whole is quiet."
Iraq warns it will bomb Iran
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraq said yesterday it
will start bombing all Iranian cities "until
further notice" in retaliation for heavy Iranian
artillery and rocket barrages that killed "large
numbers" of civilians in five Iraqi border cities.
Baghdad Radio made the announcement
after several sorties by both countries, includ
ing an Iraqi air raid on an oil refinery near
Tehran and three Iranian fighter-bomber at
tacks against petrochemical installations and
strategic bridges in southern Iraq.
Iran had served notice to Iraqi civilians to
flee their homes before it starts what it de
scribed as retaliatory bombardment against
Baghdad and other major cities.
Iran charged that Iraqi aircraft had inflicted
"hundreds" of civilian casualties Saturday
during a raid on the northern border town of
Saqez.
Iraq denied the charge, asserting that Iran
was deliberately sparking a new round in a
"War of Cities" to pave the way for another
massive ground offensive against the key river
port of Basra.
Bangladesh protesters kill 3
DHAKA, Bangladesh — Three people were
killed and 35 injured as police opened fire to
disperse crowds that were throwing home
made bombs during election protests in the
Bangladesh capital of Dhaka yesterday, an op
position leader said.
The clashes took place as Sheikh Hasina
Wazed, leader of the Awami League and an
eight-party alliance, and Begum Khaleda Zia,
chairman of a seven-party alliance, made
renewed calls at separate protest rallies for a
national boycott of Thursday's parliamentary
elections.
Sheikh Hasina later claimed that three
people, including a trade union leader, were
killed in the clashes.
Police said one person died under the wheels
of a bus during a stampede as mobs hurled
home-made bombs.
