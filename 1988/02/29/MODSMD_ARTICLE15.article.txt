# Dukakis, Bush victorious in Maine

### 
PORTLAND, Maine â€” Gov. Michael
Dukakis and Vice President George
Bush won expected victories in
Maine's presidential caucuses yester
day, but Dukakis' triumph was shared
by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who dem
onstrated an ability to attract wide
spread support among white voters.
Dukakis and Bush profited from
their victories in New Hampshire two
weeks ago, as their principal rivals
virtually ceded the race to them, al
lowing Dukakis and Bush to use their
extensive organizations and regional
ties to consolidate their hold on their
native New England.
Jackson, who finished with 27 per
cent of the state's delegates to 46 per
cent for Dukakis, took advantage of
the void, launching a last-minute tele
vision advertising campaign to help
broaden the support he had already

received from the state's union leaders
and workers. Other totals, with about
two-thirds of the state's precincts
reporting were: Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon, 4 percent; Missouri Rep. Rich
ard A. Gephardt, 3 percent, Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., 1 percent; former
Colorado Sen. Gary Llart, 1 percent;
and uncommitted, 18 percent.
On the Republican side, Bush out
polled Pat Robertson 65 percent to 14
percent, successfully facing down what
was viewed as a serious threat because
of the Robertson campaign's ability to
drum up grass-roots support, which
he had used to great advantage in
previous caucus states. The GOP fig
ures were provided by the Bush cam
paign, although they were not con
tested by any other candidate. Because
scattered caucuses have not been held,
the state party has not released official
figures. Other unofficial figures were

Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, 8 percent; and
New York Rep. Jack Kemp, 1.5 per
cent, and uncommitted, 12 percent.
While both Jackson and Robertson
showed strength in unfamiliar terri
tory, their support appeared too scant
to translate into a significant bloc of
delegates to the national convention,
who will be elected at state conven
tions later this spring.
Rival Republican campaigns
conceded that Bush would almost cer
tainly win all 22 of Maine's delegates
to the GOP convention. While
Dukakis' narrower margin of victory
and complicated Democratic party
rules makes his delegate count more
difficult to predict, party leaders here
said that he is likely to win at least
20 of the state's 27 Democratic na
tional delegates if he continues to run
strongly elsewhere in the country.

The influence of delegates elected
from Maine is likely to be scant, as
their numbers represent 0.6 percent
of the delegates to the Democratic na
tional convention and 1 percent of Re
publican delegates.
Because of the Bush and Dukakis
victories in New Hampshire Feb. 16,
several candidates drastically reduced
their efforts in Maine in order to focus
their attention elsewhere. The Repub
lican campaign of Sen. Bob Dole
reduced its staff from 13 to 2, while
Democrats Rep. Richard A. Gephardt
and Sen. Paul Simon canceled planned
commercials.
Aides to the victorious Dukakis and
Bush campaigns hailed the Maine
result as important evidence that their
competitors are not pursuing a na
tional stategy.
