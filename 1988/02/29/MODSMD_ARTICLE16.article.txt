# Shultz says Egypt supports peace plan
## 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt — Secretary of
State George Shultz, registering
the first success of his Middle East
shuttle, said yesterday President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt agreed
that the new U.S. peace package
was a "promising" one.
With Egyptian Foreign Minister
Esmat Abdel Meguid standing at
his side after a three-hour
meeting with Mubarak, Shultz
said, "I think I can say we both
feel we have a package that is
promising."
Possibly recalling the skep
ticism he encountered earlier
from Israeli, Jordanian, Syrian
and Palestinian leaders, Shultz
added with a rueful chuckle, "At
least we think it's promising —
whether anybody else will think
it's promising is the question."

Meguid stood silently while
Shultz made his comments. U.S.
officials said later, however, that
Egypt fully endorsed Shultz's as
sessment.
Shultz was preaching to the
choir in Egypt. Although the
government-controlled press re
cently has complained that the
U.S. initiative does not go far
enough, Mubarak is so closely as
sociated with the plan that one
U.S. official called him a "consult
ing architect" of the American
package.
Recalling Mubarak's visit to
Washington last month, Shultz
said, "President Mubarak urged
the president (Reagan) to send
me on a mission to the Middle
East. We have taken his advice."
Earlier in the day, Shultz con

ferred separately in Jerusalem
with Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Min
ister Shimon Peres. Spokesmen
for both men said later that their
positions were unchanged as a
result of the talks. Peres generally
supports the U.S. initiative but
Shamir opposes important parts
of it.
In his public statements since
he began his current campaign,
Shultz has referred to the U.S.
plan as a "package," carefully
balanced to be fair to all sides.
He said it aims at a "compre
hensive" peace which would in
clude all of the region's an
tagonists. That is the formula
publicly advocated by all of the
Arab parties.
