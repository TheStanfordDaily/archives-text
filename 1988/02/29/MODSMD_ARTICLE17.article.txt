# General reprimands Israeli commanders
## 
### 
JERUSALEM - Gen. Am
ram Mitzna, military chief of
the occupied West Bank, or
dered his senior troop com
manders yesterday to watch a
television news tape showing
soldiers brutalizing Palestinian
prisoners and then told them
he would not let the Israeli
army become "a mob force."
At the same time, the army
announced that three soldiers
will be court-martialed on
charges of burying alive four
young Arabs earlier this month
near the West Bank village of
Kafr Salim. The Arabs were
later rescued.
The harsh TV tape and the
burial incident, along with
other news reports of excessive
force used by Israeli soldiers,
have drawn widespread con
demnation from other nations
and from dozens of human
rights groups and has made

many senior military officers,
Mitzna among them, extremely
sensitive to charges of
brutality.
He forced his field com
manders to watch all 40
minutes of the uncut CBS tape,
not just the 60 seconds
originally shown on U.S. tele
vision. What they saw was a
graphic depiction of four Israeli
soldiers beating two hand
cuffed demonstrators with
fists, boots, clubs and stones.
Afterwards, a military source
said, Mitzna refused let any of
the other officers make com
ments and told them that noth
ing like that was to happen in
the future. He also announced
that the four soldiers have been
arrested and will be prosecuted
and that their commanding of
ficer, an unnamed captain, has
been suspended from duty.
