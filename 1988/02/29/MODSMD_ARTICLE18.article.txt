# Panamanians plan strike

### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama — Timidly and
in fear of reprisals, opponents of Panama's
military strongman Manuel Noriega made
preparations yesterday to mount a general
strike today, while the country's deposed
civilian president remained in hiding and
vowed to stay in Panama.
Moves to get ready for the strike were
painstaking. Because Gen. Noriega's
regime has shuttered opposition newspa
pers and radio and television stations, or
ganizers depended on a small army of
women to make telephone calls throughout
the day to persuade merchants and in
dustrialists to close their businesses.
Logistics, however, were only part of the
problem. Fears tended to erode the will
ingness of protesters to display opposition
to Noriega.
"People are afraid. It is a problem that
they think is a problem — they think that
death could come at any moment," said
Roberto Brenes, a leader of the Civic
Crusade, a group of some 200 business
and trade organizations that has spear
headed the opposition to Noriega.
Crusade leaders say that they must make
an impact with the general strike or face
embarrassment not only inside Panama but
abroad. "We have to show that Panama
nians are solidly against the government,"
Brenes said.

The government indirectly cautioned
against the strike by publishing stories in
its own newspapers asserting that "the
gringos" had ordered the work stoppage.
Noriega's opponents were clearly ner
vous. A small impromptu rally at a Roman
Catholic Church yesterday broke up in
panic when word spread that police were
coming. No policemen showed up.
The Civic Crusade has been trying to
overthrow Noriega's military rule of
Panama since last June. The resulting tur
bulence has not only created immense local
political tensions and severe economic prob
lems, but has also seriously taxed relations
between Panama and the United States.
The ongoing political crisis suddenly
deepened last week when President Eric
Delvalle, who had never previously func
tioned as much more than a civilian
figurehead in Noriega's shadow, tried to
fire Noriega as commander of the nation's
Defense Forces. The National Assembly
promptly ousted Delvalle, replacing him as
president with Education Minister Manuel
Solis Palma.
Delvalle's defiance has become a rallying
point for the Civic Crusade, even though
he and the crusade were long at odds,
because while he held office, Delvalle acted
as a front for Noriega's rule.
