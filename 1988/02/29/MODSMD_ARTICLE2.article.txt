## Thomas slips to third

jump combination less than half a min

Thomas then broke into a tremendous
smile and never looked back on the way

But, when that very same triple jump
combination ended with a less than per
fect two-foot landing Saturday night in
Calgary, Thomas' spirits seemed to fall,
and the collective hearts of thousands
of Stanford students — and several mil
lion Americans — sank with her.

times she is merely super
human by settling for the
bronze medal in the Olympic
ladies' figure skating competi
tion.
The 20-year-old Thomas, a
San Jose resident who is tem
porarily stopped out of Stan
ford, was skating well all week
and seemed at the top of her
form.
If all went right, Thomas had
a good chance of knocking off
defending Olympic and world
champion Katarina Witt of
East Germany and winning the
much ballyhooed battle of the
"Carmens." Instead, some
thing went wrong and the bat
tle was upstaged by Canadian
Elizabeth Manley, who won the
silver.
While the top two skaters in
the world staged a shootout to
music from Bizet's "Carmen,"
Manley was so sensational in
the freestyle that she finished
first with seven judges.
Because she was only fourth
in compulsory figures and third
in the short program, however,
Manley couldn't do better than
second overall.
"It's over. Back to school,"
said Thomas, who won the
bronze medal despite three
faulty landings. "I'm not going
to make any excuses. I was
really skating well this week.
It wasn't supposed to happen,
I guess. But I tried."
Thomas, who received con
troversially low artistic marks
for the short program, was
relying on her technical merit
to maintain her slim lead over
Witt.
Thomas seemed nervous
before her performance, in
sharp contrast to Witt's appar
ent poise and Manley's effer
vescence. However, she denied
that she fell under the pres
sure.
"I just couldn't do it. It just

wasn't there. I just gave it
away.... It was hard to stay
psyched up for the whole
thing."
Thomas transferred to the
University of Colorado at
Boulder this fall so that she
could concentrate on her train
ing and escape the academic
rigor of her pre-med work at
Stanford. The intense pres
sure, as well as several nagging
injuries, contributed to her
losing her national and world
titles in 1987.
The medical microbiology
major said now that the
"nightmare" is over, she wants
to get on with her life.
"It's been eating on me, and
I'm glad it's over," she said
after her performance.
As in the opera, Witt's char
acter died at the end of her
four-minute routine. Thomas'
Carmen survived.
But it was Witt who went
from lying flat on the ice to
standing on the gold medal
podium at the end of the night.
Clearly, though, the pressure
had gotten to both Witt and
Thomas. Witt skated conserva
tively, passing on several triple
jumps, and was generally un
inspiring. When her marks
flashed on the scoreboard it
was clear the judges left the
door ajar for Thomas to cap
ture the moment.
But it was Manley, not
Thomas, who seized the oppor
tunity, and in grand fashion.
Despite being the home favor
ite, Manley was able to escape
all the media attention
showered on Witt and Thomas
during the past two weeks.
Manley's upbeat and
dynamic program was mistake
free, and she brought the house
down at the Olympic Sad
dledome. The crowd cheered,
hooted and stamped their feet
after she landed each and every
element of her program.

much ballyhooed battle of the
"Carmens." Instead, some
thing went wrong and the bat
tle was upstaged by Canadian
Elizabeth Manley, who won the
silver.
While the top two skaters in
the world staged a shootout to
music from Bizet's "Carmen,"
Manley was so sensational in
the freestyle that she finished
first with seven judges.
Because she was only fourth
in compulsory figures and third
in the short program, however,
Manley couldn't do better than
second overall.
"It's over. Back to school,"
said Thomas, who won the
bronze medal despite three
faulty landings. "I'm not going
to make any excuses. I was
really skating well this week.
It wasn't supposed to happen,
I guess. But I tried."
Thomas, who received con
troversially low artistic marks
for the short program, was
relying on her technical merit
to maintain her slim lead over
Witt.
Thomas seemed nervous
before her performance, in
sharp contrast to Witt's appar
ent poise and Manley's effer
vescence. However, she denied
that she fell under the pres
sure.
"I just couldn't do it. It just

wasn't there. I just gave it
away.... It was hard to stay
psyched up for the whole
thing."
Thomas transferred to the
University of Colorado at
Boulder this fall so that she
could concentrate on her train
ing and escape the academic
rigor of her pre-med work at
Stanford. The intense pres
sure, as well as several nagging
injuries, contributed to her
losing her national and world
titles in 1987.
The medical microbiology
major said now that the
"nightmare" is over, she wants
to get on with her life.
"It's been eating on me, and
I'm glad it's over," she said
after her performance.
As in the opera, Witt's char
acter died at the end of her
four-minute routine. Thomas'
Carmen survived.
But it was Witt who went
from lying flat on the ice to
standing on the gold medal
podium at the end of the night.
Clearly, though, the pressure
had gotten to both Witt and
Thomas. Witt skated conserva
tively, passing on several triple
jumps, and was generally un
inspiring. When her marks
flashed on the scoreboard it
was clear the judges left the
door ajar for Thomas to cap
ture the moment.
But it was Manley, not
Thomas, who seized the oppor
tunity, and in grand fashion.
Despite being the home favor
ite, Manley was able to escape
all the media attention
showered on Witt and Thomas
during the past two weeks.
Manley's upbeat and
dynamic program was mistake
free, and she brought the house
down at the Olympic Sad
dledome. The crowd cheered,
hooted and stamped their feet
after she landed each and every
element of her program.
