## Hustle free speech 
### 
Hustler magazine may
be rude, crude and socially
unacceptable, but Thurs
day the Supreme Court made it a
hero of the First Amendment.
The latest round in the battle
to guarantee free speech in this
country has been won — and by
none other than one of the nation's
most offensive publications.
The sexually explicit magazine
won a unanimous Supreme Court
reversal of a Virginia court's ruling
that it pay $200,000 to the Rev.
Jerry Falwell for the "emotional
distress" he allegedly suffered from
seeing an ad parody of him printed
in the magazine.
Falwell's attorneys tried to limit
the magazine's freedom of speech
with an old con artists' trick: They
tried to change the rules of the
game. Instead of arguing that the
magazine had libeled Falwell's rep
utation, they set out to prove the
magazine had inflicted emotional
harm upon him.
If the attorneys had been suc
cessful, the constituitional protec
tions for free speech would have
been seriously undermined. In
stead, the court saw through the
attempt and reaffirmed its com
mitment to free speech — which
some had suspected was wavering
in recent years.
Hustler's 1983 parody was
modeled after a series of Campari
liqueur ads. In each of the ads, a
celebrity is interviewed about his
or her "first time" (drinking Cam
pari, of course). The Hustler ver
sion contains a mock interview in
which Falwell talks about the first
time he and his mother got drunk
and had sex in an outhouse.
In small print, the parody also
includes the line: "Ad parody —
not to be taken seriously."
The line protects Hustler from
a libel suit because of the Sullivan
rule, a legal standard the Supreme
Court set in 1964 with its ruling

in New York Times Company v.
Sullivan. Claims of libel by public
figures are limited by the rule to
false information published with
either actual malice or with reck
less disregard for the possibility
that the information may be un
true.
The Sullivan rule is not a license
to print untruths, but it does rec
ognize that in free discourse, mis
takes are inevitable. In order to
encourage vigorous exchange in
the marketplace of ideas, the
country has to grant that its
citizens are subject to human er
ror.
Without this "breathing space,"
Chief Justice William Rehnquist
wrote in the court's opinion last
week, it is likely that debate on
public issues and public figures will
be inhibited — people will hesitate
to say or print what they really
believe. In a country where free
discourse is vital to the political
system, such a chilling effect would
be unacceptable.
To protect the Sullivan rule, the
court recognized that it needs to
protect those like Hustler pub
lisher Larry Flynt who abuse it.
Hustler's ad, which includes
lines like "Mom looked better than
a Baptist whore with a $100 do
nation," is what Rehnquist called
"gross and repugnant." But the
court realized that it is impossible
to set fair standards defining what
is legitimate political satire and
what is not, and the ruling wisely
recognizes that even the gross and
repugnant must be protected.
It took a publisher like Flynt,
whom Falwell calls a "sleaze mer
chant," to test the limits of judicial
commitment to free speech. It is
an encouraging testimony to the
strength of our nation's constitu
tional principles that even this, the
most conservative Court in
decades, did not flinch in choosing
free speech over public morality.
