## Pledge unnecessary 
### 
SENIOR Leland's hand trembles as
he signs "The Pledge." He has just
agreed to investigate the environ
mental and social consequences of any
job opportunity that he considers. Reach
ing into his coat pocket, Leland slowly
takes out the acceptance letters from Cor
porate America and starts to rip them
in half.
Senior Jane, another Pledge signatory,
screams out: "Wait Leland! Don't reject
your invitations into Socially Productive
and Environmentally Conscious Corpo
rate America. I've just looked at the
Career Planning and Placement Center's
Environment and Social Impact Report
folder for your future jobs, and they all
have beneficial consequences for
America "
Hearing "CPPC" and "jobs," Senior
Chaz adds, "Yo, dude. Don't worry about
The Bogus Pledge. I signed it too, and
it doesn't say anywhere that your job
has to have any socially or environmen
tally good consequences."
"I'm working for a strip-mining com
pany," he adds. "I'm sure there are going
to be consequences from it."
Perplexed, Leland looks at them and
asks, "What good is The Pledge if it's so
vague that it can mean anything to
anyone? I feel like a presidential candi

date making great promises that will
never happen."
"Like promising to lower taxes, in
crease defense spending and balance the
budget," Chaz opines.
Senior Steve pops his head out from
his books just long enough to inteiject,
"The Pledge reminds me of the 1928
Kellogg-Briand Pact in which nations
renounced war for all time."
"Thanks for that word from the history
corner," responds Leland. "But let's face
it, The Pledge is just a poorly worded
call for social responsibility."
"Social responsibility!" exclaims Chaz.
"Well, count me as a 'no-show' on that
yy
one.
"What do you mean, a 'no-show'? The
Pledge just asks us to stop thinking about
ourselves and our future long enough to
use our education as an advantage to
benefit society."
Senior Jane, shaking her head, said
"Leland, that is the beauty of The Pledge:
One person's Bechtel Corporation is an
other person's Sierra Club."
Disgusted with Stanford "double
speak," Leland decides to sneak into the
Sacred Pledge Chamber and redo the wor
ding of The Pledge. The next morning,
the Pledge reads:
"I pledge to: 1. not take any job produc
ing detrimental environmental and social

renounced war for all
time.'

consequences; 2. work within my job to
make it more environmentally and so
cially productive; 3. encourage others to
make their jobs environmentally and so
cially productive."
The Pledge signing lines the next day
shortened, but social responsibility does
not need a crowd; it requires a commit
ment rather than an investigation.
