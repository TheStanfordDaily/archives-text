## Housing priorities are based on objective criteria 
### 
A FEB. 23 LETTER from Sylvia
Castro contained an inaccuracy
which may have been based in
part on a Feb. 17 Daily article on the
same subject that contained the same
inaccuracy. The Daily corrected its
error in a later issue, but I would like
to clear up any confusion or misper
ceptions on this matter that students
may have.
In her letter, Sylvia Castro stated
that in the Draw students are given
priorities to some houses based on
"applications that are subjectively
judged by current residents." This is
not the case.
As stated in the University's publica
tion, Undergraduate Draw Housing
1987-88 (the Draw Book): "Access to
special priorities is dependent solely
upon the objective criteria noted in the

special priorities section of this booklet.
No student may be refused a special
priority because of a subjective judg
ment made by one or more individuals.
If you believe that you have been
denied a special priority to which you
are entitled, notify the Stanford
Housing Center or the Row Office
immediately."
To my knowlege, there has not been
a single student complaint against a
priority process in the Draw under this
stated policy. As this policy on
priorities indicates, special priorities in
the Draw are objectively based.
Examples of such objective conditions
for obtaining priorities are: "students
who agree to enroll in at least one
house-based class and who agree to be
active participants in theme related

programs"; "students of the same sex
and guarantee status who jointly visit
the house, sign a request to be room
mates if assigned, and draw their
number in a group"; and "students
who submit a one-paragraph proposal
for a house program activity and sign
a house agreement."
In each of these cases of special
priority Draw houses, the option to
obtain the priority is open to any
student who is willing to meet the
criteria specified. These priorities are
available and could potentially be given
to every undergraduate student who
enters the Draw, if solicited.
In summary, conditions for obtaining
special priorites are not subjective in
nature, and students are not "judging
other students to allocate housing," as
the Feb. 23 letter states. This is one of

the reasons why Draw-assigned Univer
sity housing is "different" from the
University's fraternity-filled housing.
This distinction forms the basis for
part of the conclusions made by the
Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities about how the valuable
resource of student housing at Stan
ford should be allocated.
I hope that this information clarifies
an important issue regarding the Draw
and fraternities that has been misun
derstood, and that ensuing discussions
about the task force report and its
recommendations regarding fraternity
housing can be conducted in the most
informed and principled manner possi
ble.
