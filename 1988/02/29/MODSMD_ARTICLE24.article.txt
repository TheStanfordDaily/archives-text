# Faculty at Hoover has diverse views
## 
### 
When I read opinions that advocate
the "severing of connections" between
Hoover and Stanford, such as the one
written by Prof. John Manley Feb. 23, I
wonder what one means by "conserva
tive."
I believe that the labelling of a
person's (let alone an institution's)
entire set of political beliefs by a
catch-all term like "conservative" is
hardly useful and possibly distorting.
How useful is a word like "conserva
tive" when it is meant to categorize a
very differentiated group of people,
especially when individuals within this
group have a myriad of interests rang
ing from abortion to SDI. Further
more, the individuals themselves do
not hold "conservative" viewpoints in
every arena of debate.
A person may be labelled a conserva

tive when it comes to defense spending
and a liberal when it comes to school
prayer.
So what is a conservative? Is it a
George Will or a P.W. Botha? This
type of question is like asking "What
is a Stanford student?" Obviously,
these types of generalizations are
difficult to make.
Moreover, terms like conservative
and liberal become value-laden words,
and often disagreements over issues
denigrate into name calling, where the
word conservative is sometimes meant
to imply that the person is elitist or
closed-minded.
Instead of trying to put Hoover on
the defensive by calling it conservative,
I suggest that people like Manley come
right out and disagree with Hoover on
specific issues.
Finally, I find the uproar over
Hoover's "political activities" to be
almost amusing because there seems to
be an implication that there is some
thing wrong with these "activities."

The fact of the matter is that everyone
from a person who writes to his/her
congressman to a political science
professor who writes books for publica
tion is trying to influence government
action just as the Hoover scholars do.
During the past few years, however,
individuals at Hoover have been more
successful in getting their opinions
heard than professors at Stanford. And
that is hardly Hoover's fault.
