# Daily fails to cover senior class events
## 
### 
I am very disappointed with The
Daily's lack of coverage of senior class
activities.
On Feb. 11, the senior class held a
talent show featuring over 50 talented
seniors; approximately 500 seniors
attended this popular event.

The Daily called the show organizers
to get the time and place of the event,
but then did not even bother to show
up or print a word or picture about
the event.
Last Sunday, I helped organize a
senior service project in which 30
seniors volunteered part of their day to
spend with young kids from the com
munity who have not yet been
matched in the Big Brothers/ Big
Sisters program.
Everyone had a great time and
though a Daily photographer was
there, again, not a picture or word was
printed about this event.
These specific senior events were
created this year by our class and I
think we have started some great
traditions.
In our last year it would be nice to
receive some respect and interest from
The Daily.
