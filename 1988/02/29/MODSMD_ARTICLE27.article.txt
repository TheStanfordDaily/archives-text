## Stanford community libels its fraternities 
### 
«T HAVE A LIST of known
I communists in the State De
-1- partment!"
The immortal words of the infamous
Senator Joe McCarthy still echo today
on the Stanford campus.
Just substitute "sexist," "racist" or
"rapist" for "communist" and the
"Stanford fraternity system" for "State
Department." There is a string of
accusations, but little to support them.
I have been libeled.
I, along with my friends, have been
accused of being rapists. I resent and
emphatically denounce this allegation
and those who perpetuate the
stereotyped image of the sexist male.
I have no doubt that the problem of
date rape is real, but calling date rape
an "inherently fraternal" problem
seems to make about as much sense as
calling AIDS a "homosexual problem."
We seem to be inundated with
blanket statements, blind accusations
and quick fixes. These are not
answers, but knee-jerk reactions
emanating from an uninformed group
of self-styled rebels searching for a
cause.
Unfortunately, the phenomenon of
witch hunts against fraternities is not
an unusual one. For example, some
time ago, there was an attack on
fraternities instigated by resident
fellows. Some RFs explicity warned
freshmen not to consider joining fra
ternities.
This sort of activity is out of line.
People in positions of authority in the
University should not exercise that
authority in a way that is detrimental
to a student group. This is clearly
unethical.
The many zealots of this University,
both within and without the adminis
tration, seem to be convinced of two
things, both equally repugnant.
One is that the members of the
freshman class do not have the mental
capacity to judge for themselves which

living arrangement would suit them
best — hence the active anti-fraternity
lobbying, which is usually anti
intellectual in nature, as it endorses a
limitation of options and negation of
free choice.
The second conviction is the attitude
that fraternities are somehow alien to
the nature of Stanford University and
should be abolished.
I reject both of these convictions.
The first is dismissed easily. Obviously
the freshman class is pretty bright; I
believe they have the wisdom to decide
how they want to live.
The second conviction is a good
example of what happens when one
allows preconceived notions to blind
one to the obvious truth. Fraternities
(and sororities) are very much a part
of the "Stanford Experience," and they
have been since the very beginning.
The first Stanford fraternity was char
tered in 1891.
My own fraternity, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, was started here in 1902.
Today, approximately 20 percent of
Stanford students are affiliated with
fraternities and sororities.
These people are very involved indi
vidually, and as groups. Fraternity and
sorority members are active members
of most all student organizations, and
fraternities and sororities contribute to
the Stanford experience by their al
most unmatched enthusiasm at sport
ing and other events, and by their
numerous and varied community ser
vice activities. Unfortunately, much of
this goes unnoticed by campus publica
tions.
The anti-fraternity proclamations of
uninformed zealots, in addition to
being wrong and closed-minded, are
furthermore dangerous because they
may amount to a self-fulfilling prophe
cy.
As spring quarter and Rush ap
proach, the propaganda will doubtless
increase. The problem is that this

hyperbole may frighten away those
potential fraternity members who
would add to the strength and diver
sity of the system, leaving a poorer
selection of candidates.
Do the critics really want the quality
of fraternities to go down in this
manner?
I now urge friends of fraternities
and fraternity members to combat the
negative stereotype by supporting the
fraternity system, whether by writing
to The Daily, wearing Greek letters or
simply in day-to-day conversation.
I invite those with an anti-fraternity
bent to take a closer look at fraterni
ties. Please come in person to see for
yourself the campus and community
leaders you are unfairly maligning.
I do not naively expect an end to the
hysterical anti-fraternity hyperbole, but
I do hope and expect that the fresh
man class will look past the
propaganda and decide for themselves
whether or not they have a future in
the Greek system.
