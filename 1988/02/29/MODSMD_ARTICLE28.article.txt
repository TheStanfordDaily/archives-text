## Fraternities a valuable aspect of residential life 
### 
Amid the multitude of
opinions put forth recently re
garding fraternities, Leslie Kauf
man's Feb. 23 column "Politics Sustain
Frats" distinguishes itself as one
deserving a reponse.
She introduces two new elements
into the "debate" (if some of the mind
less fraternity-bashing merits the
term), raising the issue of equitable
distribution of housing and calling into
question the University's motivations
in addressing the question. Neither her
arguments nor her innuendoes have
much justification, but at least they're
a refreshing change.
Kaufman says that the benefits
fraternities offer to the community
(charitable, social and educational)
could be offered just as well by un
housed organizations and that what
little fraternities do offer does not
justify their privilege of guaranteed
housing, a benefit which should carry
with it strong obligations.
She is half right: Guaranteed
housing and self-determined member
ship are privileges which fraternitites
must justify and which create a re
sponsibility on their behalf to the
campus and community.
But her assertion about unhoused
groups, even if it were true (which I
do not concede), misses the mark.
Fraternities do not preclude the
existence of unhoused groups, and
that's not what they would be replaced
by if housing were revoked; they would
be replaced by residences governed by
the draw, with none of the obligations
to which Kaufman refers.
Therefore a better comparison would
be between the current contributions
of fraternities and dorms. The fact is
that a fraternity offers more to the
campus in terms of social, philanthro
pic and service activities than the
typical dorm.
Growing or not, their efforts beat
those of the average dorm hands down.

Why disband them as housed entities
and equalize everyone at the lowest
common denominator?
The real crux of Kaufman's article,
however, is that the University is
deliberately obfuscating the housing
issue for political reasons, because
fraternity alumni provided the funds
for the construction of the houses and
are also the continuing source of
sizable contributions to Stanford.
First of all, since when is it political
to honor an agreement? The houses
were built with the understanding that
they would be used for fraternities. Yet
Kaufman suggests that the University
can "escape" this agreement, as has
been done elsewhere, in response to
pressure from faculty who do not see
fraternities as conducive to educational
goals and from students who want
better housing.
Second, the fact that the current
fraternity houses were built with funds
donated from fraternity alumni is
strong evidence of these groups' value.
Can anyone seriously argue that in 20
years he or she would be interested,
committed and supportive enough to
donate thousands of dollars to, say,
Twain? Fraternities are criticized in
the task force report for "subjectivity"
in their selection of members.
Well, the opposite of "subjective" is
not "random," neither is the random
ness or disunity of the draw system a
constructive alternative for fraternity
housing. Fraternities' selectiveness, in
my experience, has taken the form of
choosing those students most inter
ested in joining and thus most likely
to contribute to the organization.
Both the current accomplishments of
fraternities on campus and the demon
strated commitment of past members
prove that this is the most productive
and enduring basis on which housed
groups should exist.
