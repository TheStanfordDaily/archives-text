# Federal report indicts Teller
## Physicist distorted truth, GAO finds 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
A Federal report released
Thursday affirmed allegations
that Senior Hoover Fellow Ed
ward Teller misled Reagan admin
istration officials about the
feasibility and importance of a
component of the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
In a statement released Friday,
Rep. George Brown, D-Riverside,
related the findings of a three
month General Accounting Office
investigation of Teller and an
other scientist at Lawrence Liver
more National Laboratory.
The investigation was prompted
by allegations made by Livermore
physicists that Teller and Liver
more scientist Lowell Wood over
stated the viability of a nuclear
boosted X-ray laser as an SDI
component.
In his statement, Brown said
the classified GAO report fully
supports the physicists' claims of
political maneuvering and scien
tific misrepresentation of the X
ray laser by Teller and Wood.
The GAO investigators deter
mined that "Teller's and Wood's
letters and briefings to adminis
tration officials were misleading,
particularly to individuals with
out a technical background," ac
cording to Brown's statement.
"Teller and Wood gave the im
pression that the nuclear-pumped
laser was on schedule for near
term deployment," the statement
reads.
Brown has asked the GAO to
provide the report to the House
Armed Services Committee for
further investigation.
According to Josie Stein,
Brown's press representative for
science, this investigation may
eventually lead to congressional
hearings.
Roy Woodruff, former director
of nuclear-pumped X-ray laser re
search at Livermore, and Ray Kid
der, a physicist at the facility who
has worked on the project, denied
that the X-ray research was that
far along. "If anyone had asked
me at that time if the X-ray laser
was (as Teller has argued) in the
'engineering phase,' " Kidder

said, "after i stopped laughing I
would have said 'no.' "
According to Brown's state
ment, the X-ray laser's
"feasibility" as a "weapon capable
of destroying" Soviet missiles will
not be known for at least a decade.
"If policy-makers were led to be
lieve otherwise," he writes, "it
was a result of overly optimistic
hypothetical statements."
Teller admitted that he wrote
a classified letter to the White
House in 1984, stating that "the
scientific principle of the X-ray
laser is proven and that we only
have to solve the engineering
details."
However, Kidder, in a letter to
Brown in January, said that at
the time of Teller's letter to the
White House, "basic questions of
physics remained to be answered"
regarding the X-ray laser project.

The GAO inves
tigation also estab
lished that Liver
more Director
Roger Batzel
prevented
Woodruff from
sending "correct
ing letters" to ad
ministration offi
cials who had

received inaccurate information
from Teller and Wood, according
to Brown's statement.
"The correspondence prepared
by Woodruff would have provided
a more balanced and realistic view
of the X-ray laser research pro
gram," Brown's statement
argues.
Hugh Dewitt, a scientist, at
Livermore, said a correcting letter
Woodruff wrote — which Batzel
forbade him to send — was "care
fully written and respectful of Tel
ler."
Woodruff contends that Teller,
a consultant to the Livermore X
ray laser project, was not qualified
to advise the administration di
rectly on the status of the
laboratory's research.
Teller, however, said he had no
duty to check with Woodruff —
who was at the time director of
laser research — before advising


Teller
