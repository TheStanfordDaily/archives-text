## Ram's Head prepares for spring musical 'Superstar,' spiced up 
### Thomas Shepard 
Striving for the conservative '80s look in a
show written for the '60s, 35 Stanford students
are busy rehearsing for Ram's Head's spring
musical, Jesus Christ Superstar.
According to director Allan Blue, a junior,
people usually associate Jesus Christ Superstar
with "sandy deserts, lots of yellow, dirty people
with long white beards, holding hands and danc
ing in circles."
But "there won't be any of that," in this
spring's musical, Bloom said. Instead, the cast
is working hard to capture the "sharp, clean look
of the '80s," he said.
The performers hope that Ram's Head's new
approach to Jesus Christ Superstar, a loose in
terpretation of Jesus' last week in Jerusalem,
will lead to a "dynamic" musical — more powerful
than the hippy version, according to Blue.
Senior Lisa Larragoite, who plays the lead role
of Mary, said, that Stanford's production has
"potential to be a lot more thought-provoking
than most shows."
Blue agreed, "it (the show) makes some really
distinct statements .. . about Christianity and
human interaction."

According to producer Michelle Stewart, a
junior, most Broadway shows today are "fluff"
that follow an "I speak now, the orchestra comes
up, and I feel a song coming on" pattern. But
Jesus Christ Superstar will be a fresh change
that does not follow the conventions.
Blue explained that plans for upbeating the
show include changing the '60s beat associated
with the musical into a "cleaner sound with
greater synthesization." He explained that Mu
sical Director John Mannion will avoid the drum
beat associated with the '60s and focus his at
tention on incorporating a variety of different
musical styles, including sounds from YES's new
Big Generator album and Billy Joel's later music.
Choreographer Judy Krieth, a Stanford grad
uate, said she wants the dance numbers to look
different and excite the audience as well. "To
keep it (the dancing) exciting there has to be
some level of complexity. However, I am trying
to stay away from the break dancing and moon
walking," she said.
Ram's Head's jived up, '80s interpretation of
the '60s musical will help the audience gain per
spective on both eras and "will give people a
clearer view on what the show is all about," Blue
said.
