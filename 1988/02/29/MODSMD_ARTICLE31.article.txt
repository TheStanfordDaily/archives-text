## Card takes Pac-10 lead 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Uregon seems to
be the good luck
state for Stanford
athletics. Not only
did the women's
swimming team
win the Pacific 10

Conference title this weekend in
the Beaver State, but the No. 9
women's basketball team secured
itself a top spot in the league with
a 65-57 win over Oregon State
and a 65-56 victory over Oregon.
Thanks to USC's three-point
decision over No. 11 Washington
in Los Angeles, Stanford is one
game ahead of the Huskies and
now has sole possession of first
place in the Pac-10 with only four
games left to play — guaranteeing
the Cardinal at least a third place
conference finish and, devoid of
a bizarre turn of events, the
team's first NCAA tournament
berth in six years.
This weekend's sweep improves
Stanford's record to an incredible
25-1 overall, 13-1 in league.
"It was a happy homecoming
for the Oregon women (sopho
more Katy Steding and freshman
Trisha Stevens)," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "Last year
when we played in Oregon we lost
both games, and it was not a
happy sight."
As OSU discovered Friday
night, times have certainly
changed. Though the Beaver
defense was characteristically
tough, a Steding-led Stanford
squad slipped by for the win.
"Oregon State played us really
hard defensively, which shows us
we need more practice against a
pressure defense," VanDerveer
said. "It was not an especially well
played game, but a lot of fans
were out to see Trisha and Katy."
Both gave the spectators a good
show. Steding led the team with
16 points, while a seemingly
nervous Stevens shot three-for

five from the field and two-for-two
from the line.
Oregon State junior guard
Chelle Flamoe, the Pac-10's
second-leading scorer, amassed a
game-high 22 points, but it was
not enough to counter the Cardi
nal.
Saturday was much tougher for
Stanford, due to Oregon's 6-7 cen
ter Stephanie Kasperski. The
West German sophomore, who is
tied for first nationally in blocked
shots, vindicated her poor four
point Maples Pavilion showing by
recording 26 points, 10 rebounds
and four blocks.
"They were really dominant in
side," VanDerveer recalled.
In fact, the only person who
could muster up some scoring was
sophomore guard Jennifer Azzi,
who bombed away from three
point range to keep the Cardinal
in the race. Stevens was held to
two points in the period, while
junior center Jill Yanke was score
less, leaving Stanford behind at
the half 26-21.
Halftime worked wonders.
When the teams returned to the
floor, the Cardinal took control,
getting ahead 27-26, moving out
to a 50-40 lead and tallying the
squad's 25th win.
"Basically, the play that really
did it for us was getting the ball
inside to Trisha and Jill," Van-
Derveer said. Stevens accum
ulated eight more points in the
second half, Yanke score her game
total of 10, and Steding added 11
to reach her team-leading total of
16.
The key difference, however,
was defense. The Stanford players
transformed a benign first-half
showing into an aggressive defen
sive outing, forcing 11 turnovers
to spark the Cardinal's trademark
fast-break.
"Our defense was really lacking
in the first half," senior co-captain
Charli Turner said. "When we're
not playing good defense, we're
not running "

Enjoying her Oregon homecoming to the fullest, sophomore Katy
Steding exploded with 16 points against both Oregon State Friday
night and Oregon on Saturday. No. 9 Stanford is now 25-1 on the
season.
