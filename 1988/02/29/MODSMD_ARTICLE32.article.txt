# No. 6 baseball rains on the Trojans' parade
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - In its
first series of Pacific 10
Southern Division play,
the Stanford baseball
team won two games over
USC and lost one to rain.
The No. 6 Cardinal beat

the previously undefeated Trojans 13-4
Friday night and 7-6 Saturday. Yester
day's game, scheduled for 1 p.m. at
Dedeaux Field, was postponed because of
rain.
With no break in the weather
forecasted, the Cardinal returned to
campus yesterday afternoon. The game
will be rescheduled, probably for mid-
April, when the Cardinal returns to Los
Angeles for a series with UCLA.
The two-game mini-sweep of the
Trojans is a promising start for the Car
dinal. Stanford, which has now won eight
games in a row and is 13-5 on the year
and 2-0 in conference play, did it all
against the Trojans, hitting the ball well
and receiving two strong pitching

performances from starters Lee Plemel
and Mike Mussina.
If there were any lingering doubts
about the Cardinal offense, which started
the year slowly, they were banished Fri
day. Stanford jumped all over Trojan
starter Randy Powers, with the previ
ously erratic middle of the order provid
ing particular power.
In the first inning, junior Ron Wit
meyer, who had eight home runs last
year but none this year going into the
USC series, drilled a 2-0 fastball over
the 365 sign in right-center field.
It was deja vu time in the third inning,
as Witmeyer launched an almost identical
drive to tally his second home run of the
game and put the Cardinal up 2-0.
Stanford really came on in the fourth.
Senior designated hitter Jeff Saenger
drew a walk to lead off the inning. Senior
catcher Doug Robbins laced a double into
the left-field corner, and when Trojan
leftfielder Damon Buford played hot
potato with the ball, Saenger came
around to score Stanford's third run.
One out later, junior Eric DeGraw
bounced a single up the middle to score

Robbins. Junior second baseman Frank
Carey then doubled into the left-center
gap to score DeGraw and make the score
5-0.
After a bloop single by Troy Paulsen
and a sacrifice fly by Witmeyer to score
Carey, Ed Sprague came up. Sprague,
who already had two singles in the game,
turned on a Powers fastball and sent a
screaming liner to left.
In any other park it would have been
a home run. At Dedeaux Field, where
the outfield wall is over 12 feet high, it
was a double, hitting about a foot below
the top of the fence. Paulsen came home
to put Stanford up 7-0 and the rout was
on.
The Cardinal added two more in the
inning and two in the seventh to go up
11-0. Plemel had surrendured only four
hits up to that point, but in the bottom
of the seventh the Trojans struck with
a home run, a double, a triple and a
single to score three times.
Stanford scored two more runs in the
eighth, however, and Plemel set down
the side in the bottom of the inning,
then coasted to victory, earning his third

win against one loss. It was Plemel's
third complete game in five starts. He
struck out six and walked only one.
The Cardinal offense, meanwhile, piled
up a total of 17 hits off seven different
Trojan pitchers.
Sprague, who had been in something
of a slump, was 4-for-5.
Witmeyer had been long overdue for a
power surge. "It's about time," he said.
"I've been hitting behind in the count a
lot, having to hit pitcher's pitches. I was
able to get ahead in the count tonight."
"This is a great start for us," he said.
"We're hitting the ball as well as we have
all year — but tomorrow's the crucial
game. It doesn't do us any good to come
down here and win one game."
The Cardinal won again Saturday, but
it was a bit more suspenseful than the
first game in the series.
Stanford starter Mussina, a freshman
from Montoursville, Pa., clearly didn't
have his best stuff, and the Trojans were
hiting the ball hard from the start.
Still, Mussina worked his wav out of

jams repeatedly while the Cardinal of
fense, so powerful the night before,
turned into a singles club.
In the first four innings, Stanford put
together seven singles to go with four
walks and two Trojan errors, scoring five
runs but stranding eight runners.
The Cardinal picked up two insurance
runs in the seventh which turned out to
be important.
Mussina tallied the win to improve his
season record to 3-1, but he wasn't
satisfied with his performance.
"It was a very average performance,"
he said. "I didn't have good velocity,
didn't have my good curve, and didn't
have good control."
Mussina said the lack of velocity par
ticularly hurt him. Most of the Trojans
big hits came when he got the ball up
in the strike zone. "Usually, when I get
the ball up there, I don't get hurt if I
have my good velocity — they'll pop it
up," he said. "Without good velocity, I'm
very vulnerable."
The Cardinal hosts San Jose State in
non-conference play at 2 p.m. tomorrow
at Sunken Diamond.

runs in the seventh which turned out to
be important.
Mussina tallied the win to improve his
season record to 3-1, but he wasn't
satisfied with his performance.
"It was a very average performance,"
he said. "I didn't have good velocity,
didn't have my good curve, and didn't
have good control."
Mussina said the lack of velocity par
ticularly hurt him. Most of the Trojans
big hits came when he got the ball up
in the strike zone. "Usually, when I get
the ball up there, I don't get hurt if I
have my good velocity — they'll pop it
up," he said. "Without good velocity, I'm
very vulnerable."
The Cardinal hosts San Jose State in
non-conference play at 2 p.m. tomorrow
at Sunken Diamond.

LOS ANGELES - In its
first series of Pacific 10
Southern Division play,
the Stanford baseball
team won two games over
USC and lost one to rain.
The No. 6 Cardinal beat

the previously undefeated Trojans 13-4
Friday night and 7-6 Saturday. Yester
day's game, scheduled for 1 p.m. at
Dedeaux Field, was postponed because of
rain.
With no break in the weather
forecasted, the Cardinal returned to
campus yesterday afternoon. The game
will be rescheduled, probably for mid-
April, when the Cardinal returns to Los
Angeles for a series with UCLA.
The two-game mini-sweep of the
Trojans is a promising start for the Car
dinal. Stanford, which has now won eight
games in a row and is 13-5 on the year
and 2-0 in conference play, did it all
against the Trojans, hitting the ball well
and receiving two strong pitching

performances from starters Lee Plemel
and Mike Mussina.
If there were any lingering doubts
about the Cardinal offense, which started
the year slowly, they were banished Fri
day. Stanford jumped all over Trojan
starter Randy Powers, with the previ
ously erratic middle of the order provid
ing particular power.
In the first inning, junior Ron Wit
meyer, who had eight home runs last
year but none this year going into the
USC series, drilled a 2-0 fastball over
the 365 sign in right-center field.
It was deja vu time in the third inning,
as Witmeyer launched an almost identical
drive to tally his second home run of the
game and put the Cardinal up 2-0.
Stanford really came on in the fourth.
Senior designated hitter Jeff Saenger
drew a walk to lead off the inning. Senior
catcher Doug Robbins laced a double into
the left-field corner, and when Trojan
leftfielder Damon Buford played hot
potato with the ball, Saenger came
around to score Stanford's third run.
One out later, junior Eric DeGraw
bounced a single up the middle to score

Robbins. Junior second baseman Frank
Carey then doubled into the left-center
gap to score DeGraw and make the score
5-0.
After a bloop single by Troy Paulsen
and a sacrifice fly by Witmeyer to score
Carey, Ed Sprague came up. Sprague,
who already had two singles in the game,
turned on a Powers fastball and sent a
screaming liner to left.
In any other park it would have been
a home run. At Dedeaux Field, where
the outfield wall is over 12 feet high, it
was a double, hitting about a foot below
the top of the fence. Paulsen came home
to put Stanford up 7-0 and the rout was
on.
The Cardinal added two more in the
inning and two in the seventh to go up
11-0. Plemel had surrendured only four
hits up to that point, but in the bottom
of the seventh the Trojans struck with
a home run, a double, a triple and a
single to score three times.
Stanford scored two more runs in the
eighth, however, and Plemel set down
the side in the bottom of the inning,
then coasted to victory, earning his third

win against one loss. It was Plemel's
third complete game in five starts. He
struck out six and walked only one.
The Cardinal offense, meanwhile, piled
up a total of 17 hits off seven different
Trojan pitchers.
Sprague, who had been in something
of a slump, was 4-for-5.
Witmeyer had been long overdue for a
power surge. "It's about time," he said.
"I've been hitting behind in the count a
lot, having to hit pitcher's pitches. I was
able to get ahead in the count tonight."
"This is a great start for us," he said.
"We're hitting the ball as well as we have
all year — but tomorrow's the crucial
game. It doesn't do us any good to come
down here and win one game."
The Cardinal won again Saturday, but
it was a bit more suspenseful than the
first game in the series.
Stanford starter Mussina, a freshman
from Montoursville, Pa., clearly didn't
have his best stuff, and the Trojans were
hiting the ball hard from the start.
Still, Mussina worked his wav out of

jams repeatedly while the Cardinal of
fense, so powerful the night before,
turned into a singles club.
In the first four innings, Stanford put
together seven singles to go with four
walks and two Trojan errors, scoring five
runs but stranding eight runners.
The Cardinal picked up two insurance
runs in the seventh which turned out to
be important.
Mussina tallied the win to improve his
season record to 3-1, but he wasn't
satisfied with his performance.
"It was a very average performance,"
he said. "I didn't have good velocity,
didn't have my good curve, and didn't
