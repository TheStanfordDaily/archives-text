# Stanford wears conference crown

Did anyone get the
number of that
truck?
The Stanford
women's swim
ming team left a
lot of shaken and

confused people in its wake this
weekend as the Cardinal steam
rolled its way to an easy win at
the Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionships. Stanford took 12 of the
20 events contested this weekend
between the swimming champion
ships, in Beaverton, Oregon, and
the diving championships, held in
Tuscon, Arizona.
The Cardinal's final tally was
1488.5 points; distant runner-up
California finished with 1206.
UCLA (1045), Arizona State (972)
and USC (945.5) rounded out the
top five.
Arizona led the also-rans, total
ing 719.5 points, followed by
Washington at 406.5, Oregon
State at 254 and Washington
State with 246. Oregon does not
sponsor women's swimming.
"I think we all had a good
meet," junior Aimee Berzins said.
Berzins definitely had a good meet
herself, posting three top-three
finishes, swimming legs on two
victorious relays, and most impor
tantly, qualifying for the NCAA
Championships. With two more
qualifiers Friday, plus the five
who qualified Thursday, Stanford
now has 16 swimmers set to go

to Austin, Texas, Mar. 17-19, one
fewer than the NCAA maximum.
"Everyone went in with a good
mood and left with a good mood,"
Berzins added. "As a whole I think
everyone swam well."
And if all went well at the swim
ming championships, things were
even better at the diving venue.
Sophomore Katie Connors won
both the one- and three-meter
diving competitions by huge mar
gins, 22-plus points in the former
and 42-plus points in the latter.
Additionally, senior Leslie
Kleinheksel took third off the one
meter board and sixth off the
three-meter board, while junior
Amy Biehl took 11th and eighth
in the two competitions.
"I thought it was going to be
closer," Connors said. The soph
omore also won the platform
diving competition Sunday, al
though that is not a Pac-10 event.
With the dual springboard wins,
Connors automatically qualifies
for NCAAs, allowing her to bypass
the zone qualifying meet in two
weeks.
"It just gives me a little more
time before nationals," she said.
She feels gymnastics training has
helped the divers to their fine
performances this season. "We've
been doing a lot of gymnastics —
we've been working out with
Sadao (Hamada, the Stanford
mer a gymnastics coach) a lot. I
think that's helped a lot."
The other multiple winner for
Stanford was Jenna Johnson, who
swept the 50-yard freestyle, the

with a good mood
and left with a good
mood.'

100 free and the 100 butterfly.
The 50, an event Johnson hasn't
lost all year was the closest. The
junior swam a 23.50, edging
UCLA's Jenny Susser and her
23.51. Berzins took third at 23.60.
Johnson's other victories
weren't so close. Her 100 free time
was a meet-record 50.30, .32
seconds ahead of runner-up Ber
zins. Freshman Suzy Buckovich
took fifth for Stanford as well. In
the 100 fly, Johnson's meet record
of 54.11 put her more than half
a-second ahead of the rest of the
field. Again, Buckovich swam
well, pulling out fourth.
Junior Michelle Donahue, the
defending Pac-10 champion in
both backstroke events, led a
dominant Cardinal contingent.
Donahue won the 100 back with
a meet record 56.32, while soph
omore Laurie McLean took third,
junior Jenny Shannon placed
fourth and senior Jen Pokluda
finished sixth.
Things went even better in the
200. McLean unseated her team
mate, swimming a 1988 Stanford
best of 2:00.83. Donahue took
second, freshman Jody Smith
fourth, sophomore Susannah Mil
ler sixth and Shannon seventh.

Additionally, Buckovich won
the 200 individual medley, junior
Monica Nielebeck won the 400
IM, and Stanford won three
relays.
The team of Berzins, McLean,
Smith and Susan Rapp won the
200 free relay, McLean, Buck
ovich, Berzins and Johnson took
the 400 free relay, and Donahue,
Rapp, Johnson and Berzins rolled
in the 400 medley relay.
In addition to the 16 individuals
going to NCAAs, all five Stanford
relay teams were well under
NCAA-qualifying time this week
end. The Cardinal also has two
meets this weekend in which to
qualify swimmers, and junior
Dana Anderson and sophomores
Lisa Gillespie and Amy Jo Rein
hold all have strong shots at hit
ting a cutoff time.
The end result of this is that
Stanford Coach George Haines
may have to leave as many as two
qualifiers off the NCAA traveling
team, but that would only mean
sending a stronger team to chal
lenge four-time defending na
tional champion Texas in what
appears to be a two-team race.
"A lot of people are swimming
fast at Pac-lOs without having
rested," Berzins said. "We know
.. . we're going to get a lot faster.
We are really going to give Texas
a hard time.
"We have people who are un
shaved and not rested who are
winning.... We still have more
time to let our bodies recuperate.
Who knows what might happen."

Sophomore diver Katie Connors' first place finishes In both the
one- and three-meter events added greatly to Stanford's sizable
margin of victory at the Pac-10 championships.
